            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>

                     <salute>My dear Friends,</salute>

                  <p>
                     <seg rend="decorInit">I</seg>F either I or my labors have any thing of pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>like use or worth, it is wholly (though not onely) yours. And I am convinced by Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vidence, That it is the Will of God it should be so. This I clearly discerned in my first coming to you, in my former abode with you, and in the time of my forced absence from you. When I was separated by the miseries of the late unhappy war, I durst not fix in any other Congregation, but lived in a military unpleasing state, lest I should forestal my return to you; for whom I took my self reserved. The offers of greater worldly accommodations, with five times the means which I receive with you, was no temptation to me once to question whether I should leave you: Your free invitation of my return, your obedience to my Doctrine, the strong affection which I have yet towards you above all people, and the general hearty return of Love, which I finde from you, do all perswade me, that I was sent into this world, especially for the service of your souls. And that even when I am dead, I might
<pb facs="tcp:61132:3"/>
yet be a help to your salvation; the Lord hath forced me quite besides my own resolution, to write this Treatise and leave it in your hands. It was far from my thoughts ever to have become thus publike, and burdened the world with any writings of mine: Therefore have I oft resisted the requests of my reverend Brethren, and some Superiors, who might else have commanded much more at my hands. But see how God over ruleth and crosseth our resolutions.</p>
                  <p>Being in my quarters far from home, cast into extream languish<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing (by the sudden loss of about a Gallon of blood<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> after many yeers foregoing weakness) and having no acquaintance about me, nor any Books, but my Bible, and living in continual expectation of death, I bent my thoughts on my Everlasting Rest: And because my memory through extream weakness was imperfect, I took my pen, and began to draw up my own funeral Sermon; or some helps for my own Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ditations of Heaven, to sweeten both the Rest of my life, and my death. In this condition, God was pleased to continue me about five moneths from home, where being able for nothing else, I went on with this work, which so lengthened to this, which here you see. It is no wonder therefore, if I be too abrupt in the beginning, seeing I then intended but the length of a Sermon or two: Much less may you wonder, if the whole be very imperfect, seeing it was written, as it were, with one foot in the grave, by a man that was betwixt living and dead, that wanted strength of nature to quicken Invention or Affection, and had no Book but his Bible, while the chief part was finished; nor had any minde of humane ornaments, if he had been furnished. But, O how sweet is this Providence now to my review! which so happily forced me to that work of Meditation, which I had formerly found so profitable to my soul! and shewed me more mercy in depriving me of other helps, then I was aware of! and hath caused my thoughts to feed on this Heavenly Subject, which hath more benefited me, then all the studies of my life!</p>
                  <p>And now, dear Friends, such as it is, I here offer it you; and upon the bended knees of my soul, I offer up my thanks to the merciful God, who hath fetched up, both me and it, as from the grave, for your ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vice: Who reversed the sentence of present death, which by the ablest Physitians, was past upon me! who interrupted my publike labors for a time, that he might force me to do you a more lasting service, which else I had never been like to have attempted! That God do I heartily bless and magnifie, who hath rescued me from the many dangers of four yeers
<pb facs="tcp:61132:3"/>
war, and after so many tedious nights and days, and so many doleful fights and tidings, hath returned me, and many of your selves, and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prived us till now to serve him in peace! And though men be ungrate<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful, and my body ruined beyond hope of recovery, yet he hath made up all in the comforts I have in you! To the God of mercy, do I here offer my most hearty thanks, and pay the vows of acknowledgment which I oft made in my distress, who hath not rejected my prayers, which in my dolor I put up, but hath by a wonder delivered me in the midst of my duties; and hath supported me this fourteen yeers in a languishing state, wherein I have scarce had a waking hour free from pain; who hath above twenty several times delivered me, when I was neer to death: And though he hath made me spend my days in groans and tears, and in a constant expectation of my change, yet hath he not wholly dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>abled me to his service; and hereby hath more effectually subdued my pride, and made this world contemptible to me, and forced my dull heart to more importunate requests, and occasioned more rare dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>coveries of his Mercy, then ever I could have expected in a prosperous state. For ever blessed be the Lord, that hath not onely honored me to be a Minister of his Gospel, but hath also set me over a people so will<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to obey, and given me that success of my labors, which he hath denied to many more able and faithful; who hath kept you in the zeal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous practice of godliness, when so many grow negligent, or despise the Ordinances of God; who hath kept you stable in his Truth, and saved you from the spirit of Giddiness, Levity, and Apostacy of this age; who hath preserved you from those scandals, whereby others have so hainously wounded their profession; and hath given you to see the mis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chief of Separation and Divisions, and made you eminent for Vnity and Peace, when almost all the Land is in a flame of contention, and so many, that we thought godly, are busily demolishing the Church<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> and striving in a zealous ignorance against the Lord. Beloved, though few of you are rich, or great in the world, yet for this riches of mercy to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards you, I must say, Ye are my Glory, my Crown, and my Joy: And for all these rare favors to my self and you, as I have oft promised to publish the praises of our Lord, so do I here set up this stone of re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>membrance, and write upon it, <hi>Glory to God in the highest: Hither<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to hath the Lord helped us: My flesh and my heart failed, but God is the strength of my heart, and my portion for ever.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>But have all these Deliverances brought us to our Rest? No: We are as far yet from it, as we are from Heaven. You are yet under

oppression and troubles, and I am yet under consuming sickness: And feeling that I am like to be among you but a little while, and that my pained body is hastening to the dust: I shall here leave you my best advice for your immortal souls, and bequeath you this counsel as the legacy of a dying man, that you may here read it, and practise it, when I am taken from you: And I beseech you receive it as from one that you know doth unfainedly love you, and that regardeth no honors or happiness in this world, in comparison of the welfare and salvation of your souls; yea, receive it from me, as if I offered it you upon my knees, beseeching you for your souls sake, that you would not reject it, and beseeching the Lord to bless it to you; yea, as one that hath received authority from Christ to command you, I charge you in his name, as ever you will answer it, when we shall meet at judgment, and as you would not have me there be a witness against you, nor all my labors be charged against you to your condemnation, and the Lord Jesus your Judg to sentence you as rebellious, that you faithfully and constantly practise these ten directions.</p>

                     <hi>1.</hi> Labor to be men of knowledg and sound understandings. A sound judgment is a most precious mercy, and much conduceth to the soundness of heart and life. A weak judgment is easily corrupted; and if it be once corrupt, the will and conversation will quickly follow. Your understandings are the in-let or entrance to the whole soul; and if you be weak there, your souls are like a Garison that hath open or il-guarded Gates; and if the enemy be once let in there, the whole City will quickly be his own. Ignorance is virtually every error; therefore let the Bible be much in your hands and hearts: Remember what I taught you on <hi>Deut. 6.6, 7.</hi> Read much the writings of our old solid Divines; such as <hi>Perkins, Bolton, Dod, Sibbs,</hi> especially Doctor <hi>Preston</hi>: You may read an able Divine, when you cannot hear one; especially, be sure you learn well the Principles of Religion. Begin with the Assemblies lesser Catechism, and then learn the great<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er; and next Master <hi>Balls,</hi> with the Exposition; and then Doctor <hi>Ames</hi> his Marrow of Divinity (now Englished) or <hi>Ushers.</hi> If you see men fall on Controversies, before they understand these, never wonder if they are drowned in errors. I know your povertie and labors will not give you leave to read so much as others may do; but yet a willing minde will finde some time, if it be when they should sleep, and especially it will spend the Lords day wholly in these things.
<pb facs="tcp:61132:4"/>
O be not ignorant of God in the midst of such light! as if the matters of your salvation were less worth your study, then your trading in the world.</p>
                  <p n="2">
                     <hi>2.</hi> Do the utmost you can to get a faithful Minister, when I am taken from you; and be sure you acknowledg him your Teacher, Overseer, and Ruler, <hi>1 Thess. 5.12, 13.

Had not weak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness confined me, and publike labors forbidden me, I should judg my self hainously guiltie in neglecting this. In the Primitive times, every Church of so many souls as this Parish, had many Ministers, whereof the ablest speakers did preach most impublike, and the rest did the more of the less publike work (which some mistake for meer Ruling Elders:) But now Sacriledg and Covetousness will scarce leave maintenance for one in a Church; which is it that hath brought us to a loss in the nature of Government.</p>

How many of these or Antinomists, &amp;c. have you known, who have not proved palpably guiltie of lying, perfidiousness, covetousness, malice, contempt of their godly Brethren. licenciousness, or seared Consci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ences?

You know I have had as much opportunitie to try their strength, as most: And I never yet met with any in Garison, or Army, that could say any thing which might stagger a solid man. You heard in my late publike dispute at <hi>Bewdley, January 1.</hi> with Mr. <hi>Tombs,</hi> who is taken to be the ablest of them in the Land, and one of the most moderate, how little they can say even in the hardest point of Baptism; what gross absurdities they are driven to, and how little tender Consciencious fear of erring is left among the best.</p>

Remember what I taught you on <hi>Heb. 12.14.</hi> He that is not a son of Peace, is not a son of God. All other sins destroy the Church consequentially; but Division and Separation demolish it directly. Building the Church is but an order<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly joyning of the materials; and what then is disjoyning, but pulling down? Many Doctrinal differences must be tolerated in a Church: And why? but for Vnitie and Peace? Therefore Disunion and Separation is utterly intolerable. Beleeve not those to be the Churches Friends, that would cure and reform her by cutting her throat. Those that say, No Truth must be concealed for Peace have usually as little of the one, as the other. Study <hi>Gal. 2.2. Rom. 14.1.</hi> &amp;c. <hi>Acts 21.24, 26. 1 Tim 1.4. and 6.4.

and Divisions? To think what a wound we have hereby given to the very Christian name? How we have hardened the ignorant? Confirmed the Papists? And are our selves become the scorn of our enemies, and the grief of our friends? And how many of our dearest, best esteemed Friends, are faln to notorious Pride, or Impietie? yea, some to be worse then open Infidels? These are Pillars of Salt; see that you remember them. You are yet eminent for your Vnitie, Stedfastness, and Godliness; hold fast that you have, that no man take your Crown from you. Temptations are now come neer your doors; yet many of you have gone through greater, and therefore I hope will scape through these: Yet least your temptations should grow stronger, let me warn you, That though of your own selves men should arise, speaking perverse things, to draw disciples after them, <hi>Acts 20.30.</hi> yea, though an Angel from Heaven should draw you to divisions, see that you follow him not. If there be erronious practises in the Church, keep your selves innocent with moderation and peace: Do your best to reform them; and rather remove your dwellings, if you cannot live innocently, then rend the Church. It must be no small Error that must force a Separation. <hi>Justin</hi> a holy learned Martyr <hi>(In Dialog<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> cum Tryphone)</hi> (who was converted within thirtie one yeers of <hi>Johns</hi> death, and wrote his first Apologie within fiftie one; and therefore it is like saw <hi>Johns</hi> days,) professeth, That if a Jew should keep the Ceremonial Law (so he did not perswade the Gentiles to it as necessary) yet if he acknowledg Christ, he judgeth that he may be saved, and he would embrace him, and have communion with him as a Brother: And <hi>Paul</hi> would have him received that is weak in the faith, (and not unchurch whole Parishes of those that we know not, nor were ever brought to a just trial,) You know I never con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formed to the use of Mystical, Symbolical Rites, my self, (but onely to the determination of Circumstantials necessary <hi>in genere,</hi>) and yet I ever loved a godly, peaceable Conformist, better then a turbulent, Non-Conformist.

And for all the interest I have in your Judgments and Affections, I here charge you, That if God should give me up to any factious Church-rending course (against which I daily pray) that you forsake me, and follow me not a step.</p>
                  <p>And for Peace with one another, follow it with all your might: If it be possible, as much as in you lieth, live peaceably with all men, <hi>Rom. 12.18.</hi> (mark this) When you feel any sparks of discontent in your brest, take them as kindled by the Divel from Hell, and take heed you cherish them not. If the flames begin to break forth in Censoriousness, Reproaches, and hard Speeches of others; be as speedy and busie in quenching it, as if it were fire in the Thatch of your houses: For why should your houses be dearer to you then the Church, which is the house of God? or, then your souls, which are the Temples of the Holy Ghost? If any heart-burnings arise, do not keep strange, but go together, and lovingly debate it, or pray together, that God would reconcile you; or refer the matter to your Minister or others; and let not the Sun go down on your wrath. Hath God spoke more against any sin, then unpeaceableness? If ye forgive not men their trespasses, neither will your heavenly Father forgive you (which made <hi>Endovicus Crocius</hi> say, That this is the measure and essential propertie of the lest degree of true Faith, <hi>Syntag. lib. 4. cap. 16.</hi>) If you love not each other, you are no Disciples of Christ; nay, if you love not your enemies, and bless not them that curse you, and pray not for them that hurt and persecute you, you are no Children of God. <hi>The Wisdom from above, is first pure, then peaceable, gentle, easie to be intreated,</hi> &amp;c. <hi>Jam. 3.17.</hi> O remember that piercing example of Christ, who washed his Disciples feet, to teach us, that we must stoop as low to one another. Sure God doth not jest with you in all these plain Scriptures? I charge you in the Name of Christ, if you cannot have peace otherwise, That you suffer wrongs and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proaches, that you go and beg peace of those that should beg it of you, yea, that you beg it on your knees of the poorest beggar, rather then lose it. And remember <hi>Rom. 16.17, 18.</hi>

                  <p n="7">
                     <hi>7.</hi> Above all, be sure you get down the pride of your hearts. For<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>get not all the Sermons I preached to you against this sin.

discontent. If once you grow wise in your own eyes, and love to be valued and preferred, and love those best that think highliest of you, and have secret heart-risings against any that disregard you, or have a low esteem of you, and cannot endure to be flighted, or spoke evil of<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> never take your selves for Christians, if this be your case. To be a true Christian without Humilitie, is as hard as to be a man without a Soul. O poor <hi>England!</hi> How low art thou brought by the Pride of Ignorant Zealots! Dear Friends! I can foretel you, without the gift of prophecy, That if any among you do fall from the Truth, mark which are the proudest, that cannot endure to be contradicted<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> and that vilifie others, and those will likely be they: And if ever you be broke in pieces, and ruined, Pride will be the cause.</p>
                  <p n="8">
                     <hi>8.</hi> Be sure you keep the mastery over your flesh and senses. Few ever fall from God, but flesh-pleasing is the cause: Many think that by [flesh] the Scripture means onely our in-dwelling sin, when alas, it is this sensitive appetite that it chargeth us to subdue. Nothing in the world damneth so many as flesh-pleasing, while men generally chuse it as their Happiness in stead of God. O remember who hath said, If ye live after the flesh ye shall die; and Make no provision for the flesh<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> to satisfie its desires, <hi>Rom 8.5 6, 7. and 13.14.</hi> Think of this when you are tempted to drunkenness, and gluttony, and lustfulness, and worldliness; and when you would fain have your dwellings, and states more delightful. You little think what a sin it is, even to please your flesh, further then it tends to help you in the service of God.</p>
                  <p n="9">
                     <hi>9.</hi> Make conscience of the great duty of reproving, and ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>horting those about you: Make not your souls guilty of the oaths, ignorance, and ungodliness of others, by your silence. Admonish them lovingly and modestly, but be sure you do it, and that seriously. This is the first step in Discipline. Expect not that your Minister should put any from the Sacrament, whom you have not thus admonished once and again. Punish not before due process.</p>
                  <p n="10">
                     <hi>10.</hi> Lastly, Be sure to maintain a constant delight in God, and a seriousness and spirituality in all his Worship. Think it not enough to delight in Duties, if you delight not in God: Judg not of your duties by the bulk and number, but by this sweetness. You are never stable Christians till you reach this. Never forget all those Sermons I preached to you on <hi>Psal 37.4.</hi> Give not way to a customary dulness in duty: Do every duty with all thy might; especially, be not slight in secret Prayer and Meditation: Lay not out the chief of your

zeal upon externals, and opinions, and the smaller things of Religion. Let must of your daily work be upon your hearts: Be still suspicious of them; understand their mortal wickedness, and deceitfulness, and trust them not too far. Practise that great duty of daily watching; pray earnestly, That you be not lead into temptation. Fear the begin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings and appearances of sin. Beware lest Conscience once lose its tenderness. Make up every breach between God and your consciences betime. Learn how to live the life of Faith; and keep fresh the sense of the love of Christ, and of your continual need of his Blood, Spirit, and Intercession: And how much you are beholden and en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gaged to him. Live in a constant readiness and expectation of death; and be sure to get acquainted with this Heavenly Conversation, which this Book is written to direct you in; which I commend to your use, hoping you will be at the pains to read it, as for your sakes I have been to write it: And I shall beg for you of the Lord, while I live on this Earth, That he will perswade your souls to this blessed Work, and that when death comes it may finde you so imployed, that I may see your faces with joy at the Bar of Christ, and we may enter together into the Everlasting Rest. <hi>Amen.</hi>

Nor do I intend this Epistle for the publishing of your Vertues: You know to whose judgment you stand or fall. It is a small thing to be judged by mans judgment: If you be sentenced as Righteous at the Bar of Christ, and called by him the Blessed of his Father; it matters not much, by what name or title you are here called. All Saints are low in their own esteem, and therefore thirst not to be highly esteemed by others: He that knows what Pride hath done in the World, and is now doing, and how close that hainous sin doth cleave to all our Natures, will scarce take him for a friend, who will bring fewel

to the fire, nor that breath for amicable, which will blow the coal. Yet he that took so kindly a womans box of oyntment, as to affix the History to his Gospel, that where-ever it was read, that good Work might be remembred, hath warranted me by his example, to annex the mention of your Favors to this Treatise, which have many times far exceeded in cost that which <hi>Judas</hi> thought too good for his Lord. And common ingenuity commandeth me thankfully to ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>knowledg, That when you heard I was suddenly cast into extream weakness, you sent into several Counties to seek me in my quarters, and missing of me, sent again, to fetch me to your house, where for many moneths I found a Hospital, a Physitian, a Nurse, and real Friends, and (which is more then all) daily and importunate Prayers for my recovery; and since I went from you, your kindnesses still following me in abound<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance: And all this for a man that was a stranger to you, whom you had never seen before, but among Souldiers, to burden you: And for one that had no witty insinuations for the extracting of your favors, nor impudency enough to return them in flatteries; yea, who had such obstructions betwixt his heart and his tongue, that he could scarce handsomly express the least part of his thankfulness; much less able to make you a requital. The best return I can make of your love, is in commending this Heavenly Duty to your Practice; wherein I must intreat you to be the more diligent and unwearied, because as you may take more time for it then the poor can do, so have you far stronger temptations to divert you; it being extreamly difficult for those that have fulness of all things here, to place their happiness really in another life, and to set their hearts there, as the place of their Rest; which yet

Man hath now a heart too suitable to his estate: A low state, and a low spirit. And (as some expound that of <hi>Luk.</hi> 18.8.) when the Son of God comes with Recovering Grace, and discoveries and
<pb n="2" facs="tcp:61132:14"/>
tenders of a spiritual and eternal Happiness and Glory, he findes not faith in man to beleeve it. But as the poor man that would not beleeve that any one man had such a sum as an hundred pound, it was so far above what he possessed: So man will hardly now be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leeve, that there is such a Happiness as once he had, much less as Christ hath now procured. When God would give the <hi>Israelites</hi> his Sabbaths of Rest, in a Land of Rest, he had more ado to make them beleeve it, then to overcome their enemies, and procure it for them: And when they had it, only as a small intimation &amp; earnest of a more incomparably glorious Rest through Christ, they stick there, and will yet beleeve no more then they do possess, but sit down and say, as the Glutton at the feast, <hi>Sure there's no other Heaven but this.</hi> Or if they do expect more by the Messiah, it is only the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crease of their earthly felicity. The Apostle bestows most of this Epistle against this distemper, and clearly and largely proves unto them, That it's the end of all Ceremonies and Shadows, to direct them to Jesus Christ the Substance; and that the Rest of Sabbaths and <hi>Canaan,</hi> should teach them to look for a further Rest, which indeed is their Happiness. My Text is his Conclusion after divers Arguments to that end; a Conclusion so useful to a Beleever, as containing the ground of all his comforts, the end of all his duty and sufferings, the life and sum of all Gospel-promises, and Christian-priviledges, that you may easily be satisfied why I have made it the subject of my present Discourse. What more welcome to men, under personal afflictions, tiring duty, successions of sufferings, then Rest? What more welcom news to men under publick calamities, unpleasing employments, plunderings, losses, sad tydings &amp;c. (which is the common case) then this of Rest? Hearers, I pray God your attentions, intention of spirit, entertainment, and improvement of it, be but half answerable to the verity, necessity and excellency of this Subject, and then you will have cause to bless <hi>God,</hi> while you live, that ever you heard it, as I have, that ever I studied it.</p>

But God hath a Peculiar People, that are his by special vocation, cordial acceptation of Christ, internal, sincere covenanting, sanctified by the blood of the Covenant, and Spirit of Grace, so far, as not only to be separated from open Infidels, but from all unregenerate Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stians being Branches in Christ, bearing fruit; and for these remains the Rest in my Text.</p>

                           <hi>Quest.</hi> BUt is it to a determinate number of persons by name, or onely to a people thus and thus qualified, <hi>viz.</hi> persevering Beleevers, without determining by Name who they are?</p>
                        <p>
                           <hi>Ans.</hi> I purposely in this Discourse omit controversies; onely in a word thus: 1. It is promised only to persevering Beleevers, and not to any particular persons by name. 2. It is purposed with all the conditions of it, and means to it, to a determinate Number, called the Elect, and known by name; which I prove thus.</p>
                        <p n="1">1. There's few will deny, that God foreknows from eternity who these are, and shall be, numerically, personally, by name.</p>
                        <p n="2">2. To purpose it only to such, and to know that only these will be such, is in effect to purpose it only to these.</p>
                        <p n="3">3. Especially, if we know, how little Knowledg and Purpose in God do differ.</p>
                        <p n="4">4. However, we must not make his knowledg active, and his purpose idle, much less to contradict each other, as it must be, if from eternity he purposed salvation alike to all, and yet from eternity knew that only such and such should receive it.</p>
                        <p n="5">5. To purpose all persevering Beleevers to salvation, and not to purpose faith and perseverance absolutely to any particular persons, is to purpose salvation absolutely to none at all.</p>

It's not a note of a Legalist neither: It hath been the ground of a multitude of Late mistakes in Divinity, to think that [<hi>Do this and Live</hi>] is onely the language of the Covenant of Works. It's true, in some sence it is; but in other, not. The Law of Works onely saith [<hi>Do this</hi> (that is, perfectly fulfil the whole Law) <hi>and Live</hi>] (that is, for so doing): But the Law of Grace saith, [<hi>Do this and Live</hi>] too; that is, Beleeve in Christ, seek him, obey him sincerely as thy Lord and King; forsake all, suffer all things, and overcome; and by so doing, or in so doing, as the Conditions which the Gospel propounds for Salvation, you shall live. If you set up the abrogated duties of the Law again, you are a Legalist: if you set up the duties of the Gospel in Christs stead, in whole or in part, you err still. Christ hath his place and work: Duty hath its place, and work too: Set it but in its own place, and expect from it, but its own part, and you go right. Yea more (how unsavory soever the phrase may seem); you may, so far as this comes to,
<pb n="9" facs="tcp:61132:17"/>
trust to your Duty and Works, that is, for your own part: and many miscarry in expecting no more from them, (as to pray and to expect nothing the more,) that is, from Christ in a way of Duty: For if duty have no share, why may we not trust Christ as well in a way of disobedience as duty? In a word, you must both use and trust duty in Subordination to Christ, but neither use them nor trust them in Co-ordination with him: So that this derogates no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing from Christ, for he hath done and will do all his work per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fectly, and enableth his people to Theirs; Yet he is not properly said to do it himself; he <note n="*" place="margin">Believed for us legally, or so far as the Law required Faith; but not as it is the Condition or Command of the New Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venan<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

The glori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fying himself, and the saving his people, (as I judg) are not two Decrees with God; but one Decree, to glorifie his mercy in their salvation: So I think they should be with us, one Intention: We should aim at the glory of God (not alone considered, without our salvation, but) in our salvation. Therefore I know no warrant for putting such a Question to our selves, as some do, Whether we could be content to be damned, so God were glorified <note n="*" place="margin">Christ hath put no such questions to us, nor bid us put such to our selves. Christ had ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther that men would enquire after their true willing<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness to be sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved, then their willingness to be damned.</note>? Sure I am, Christ himself is offered to faith in terms, for the most part respecting the welfare of the sinner, more then his own abstracted glory: he would be received as a Saviour, Mediator, Redeemer, Reconciler, Intercessor, &amp;c. And all the precepts of Scripture, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing backed with so many promises and threatenings, every one in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tended of God as a motive to us, do imply as much.

IN the Definition,<note place="margin">§. 10.</note> I call a Christians Happiness, the end of [his Course] thereby meaning, as <hi>Paul,</hi> 2 <hi>Tim.</hi> 4.7. the whole scope of his life. For as Salvation may and must be our end, so not onely the end of our faith (though that principally) but of all our actions; for as whatsoever we do, must be done to the glory of God, whether eating, drinking, &amp;c. so must they all be done to our Salvation. That we may beleeve for Salvation, some will grant, who yet deny that we may do, or obey for it. <note n="*" place="margin">The Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures before cited do prove both.</note> I would it were well understood, for the clearing of many controversies, what the Scripture usually means by Faith. Doubtless the Gospel takes it not so strictly as Philosophers do; but, in a larger sence, for our obedience to all Gospel precepts. To beleeve in his name, and to receive him, are all one:<note place="margin">Joh. 1.12.</note> but we must receive him as King, as well as Saviour: therefore beleeving doth not produce subjection as a fruit,<note place="margin">See more of this hereafter.</note> but con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain it as an essential part, except we say that Faith receives Christ as a Saviour first, and so justifies before it take him for King (as some think,) which is a maimed, unsound, and no Scripture faith. I doubt not, but the Soul more sensibly looks at Salvation from Christ, then Government by him, in the first work; yet (what<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever precedaneous act there may be) it never conceives of Christ to Justification, nor knows him with the knowledg which is eternal life, till it conceive of him, and know him for Lord and King. There<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore there is not such a difference between Faith and Gospel-obedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence, or Works, as some judg: Obedience to the Gospel is put for Faith, and Disobedience put for Unbelief usually in the New Testament.</p>

Though some talk of losing onely a temporal, earthly, felicity; sure I am, it was God we fell from, and him we lost, and since said to be without him in the world; and there would have been no death, but for sin; and to enjoy God without death, is neither an earthly, nor temporal enjoyment: Nay, in all men at Age, here is supposed, not onely a distance from God, but also a contrary motion: For sin hath not overthrown our Being, nor taken away our Motion; but

our well-being, and the Rectitude of our motion.

The case is clear in Good Actions: If God move us not, we cannot move: Therefore is it a most necessary part of our Christian Wisdom, to keep our subordination to God, and depend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance on him; To be still in the path where he walks, and in that way where his Spirit doth most usually move. Take heed of being estranged or separated from God, or of slacking your dayly expecta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions of renewed help, or of growing insensible of the necessity of the continual influence and assistance of the Spirit.

A multitude of such difficulties occur, which will be difficulties while the Doctrine of Spirits and Spirituals is so dark to us; and that will be while the dust of mortality and corruption is in our eyes. This is my comfort, that death will shortly blow out this dust, and then I shall be resolved of these, and many more.

                        <p>I have seen this Doctrine also thrown by with contempt by o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers, who say; What, do you set us a working for heaven? Doth our duty do any thing? Hath not Christ done all? Is not this to make him a half Saviour? and to preach Law?</p>
                        <p>
                           <hi>Ans.</hi> It is to preach the Law of Christ; his Subjects are not Lawless; It is to preach Duty to Christ: No more exact requirer of duty, or hater of sin, then Christ. Christ hath done, and will do all his work, and therefore is a perfect Saviour; but yet leaves for us a work too: He hath paid all the price, and left us none to pay; yet he never intended his purchase should put us into absolute, im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mediate personal title to glory in point of Law, much less into im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mediate possession: What title we may have from his own, and his Fathers secret counsel, is nothing to the Question. He hath pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chased the Crown to bestow, only on Condition of beleeving, deny<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing all for him, suffering with him, persevering and overcoming. He hath purchased Justification to bestow only on condition of our beleeving, yea repenting and beleeving <note n="*" place="margin">See Doctor <hi>Jennison</hi> on this Subject.</note>. That the first Grace hath any such Condition, I will not Affirm; but all following mercies have: Though 'tis Christ that enableth also to perform the Condi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion. It is not a Saviour offered, but received also, that must save: It is not the blood of Christ shed only, but applyed also, that must fully deliver: Nor is it applyed to the Justification, or Salvation of a sleepy Soul: Nor doth Christ carry us to heaven in a chair of se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>curity. Where he will pardon, he will make you pray, <hi>Forgive us our trespasses</hi>; and where he will give Righteousness, he will give hungering and thirsting: It is not through any imperfection in Christ, that the Righteous are scarcely saved; no nor that the wick<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed perish, as they shall be convinced one day. In the same sence as the prayer of the faithful, if fervent, availeth for outward mercies, in the same sence it prevaileth for Salvation also;<note place="margin">James 5.16.</note> For Christ hath purchased both. And as Baptism is said to save us, so other duties too:<note place="margin">1 Pet. 3.21.</note> Therefore say not, It is not duty, but Christ: For it is Christ in

The Souls motion is not that which we call violent or constrained, (none can force it) but natural, <hi>viz.</hi> according to our new nature. As every thing inclines to its proper Center, so the Rational Creature is carryed on in all its motion, with desires after its end. This end is the first thing intended, and chiefest desired, though last obtained. Observe it, and beleeve it, who ever thou art; there was never Soul that made Christ and glory the principal end; nor that obtained Rest with God, whose desire was not set upon him, and that above all things else in the world whatsoever: Christ brings the heart to heaven first, and then the person: His own mouth spoke it; <hi>Where your treasure is, there will your heart be also,</hi> Mat. 6.21. A sad conclusion to thousands of professed Christians. He that had truly rather have the enjoyment of God in Christ, then any thing in the world, shall have it; and he that had rather have any thing else, shall not have this, (except God change him.)

With what panting and weariness doth a feeble man ascend that hill, which the sound man runs up with ease! We are all, even the best, but feeble. An easie, dull profession of Religion, that never encountereth with these difficulties and pains, is a sad sign of an un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sound heart.

Nay, if I never saw that creature, which contains not something unsearchable; nor the worm so small, which afforded not matter for Questions to puzzle the greatest Phylosopher that ever I met with, no wonder then if mine eye fail when I would look at God, my tongue fail me in speak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of him, and my heart in conceiving. As long as the Athenian Superscription doth so too well suite with my sacrifices, [<hi>To the unknown God,</hi>] and while I cannot contain the smallest rivelet;
<pb n="24" facs="tcp:61132:25"/>
It's little I can contain of this immense Ocean. We shall never be capable of clearly knowing, till we are capable of fully enjoying, nay nor till we do actually enjoy him. What strange conceivings, hath a man born blind, of the Sun, and its light? or man born deaf, of the nature of sounds and musick? So do we yet want that sense, by which God must be clearly known. I stand and look upon a heap of Ants, and see them all with one view, very busie to little purpose; They know not me, my being, nature, or thoughts, though I am their fellow creature: How little then must we know of the great Creator, though he with one view continually beholds us all. Yet a knowledg we have, though imperfect, and such as must be done away: A Glimpse the Saints behold, though but in a glass; Which makes us capable of some poor, general, dark apprehensions of what we shall behold in Glory. If I should tell a Worldling but what the holiness and Spiritual Joys of the Saints on earth are, he cannot know it; for grace cannot be clearly known without grace: how much less could he conceive it, Should I tell him of this Glory? But to the Saints I may be somewhat more encoura<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ged to speak; for Grace giveth them a dark knowledg, and slight taste of Glory.</p>
                        <p>As all Good whatsoever is comprised in God, and all in the creature are but drops of this Ocean: So all the Glory of the blessed is com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prised in their enjoyment of God; and if there be any mediate Joys there, they are but drops from this. If men and Angels should study to speak the blessedness of that estate in one word, what can they say beyond this, That it is the nearest enjoyment of God? Say they have God, and you say they have all, that's worth a having. O the full Joys offered to a beleever in that one sentence of Christs, I would not for all the world, that one verse had been left out of the Bible: <hi>Father, I will that those whom thou hast given me, be with me where I am, that they may behold my Glory which thou hast given me,</hi> John 17.24.

Could they yet aspire higher? And was there yet room for discontent? What is it then that would satisfie them? Indeed the distance that we sinners and mortals are at from our God, leaves us some excuse for discon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tent with our estate. The poor soul out of the depth cries, and cries aloud, as if his Father were out of hearing: sometime he chides the interposing clouds, sometime he is angry at the vast gulf that's set between, sometime he would fain have the vail of mortality drawn aside, and thinks death hath forgot his business; he ever quarrels with this Sin that separates, and longs till it be separated from his Soul, that it may separate God and him no more: Why, poor Christian, be of good chear; the Time is Near, when God and thou shall be Near, and as Near as thou canst well desire: Thou shalt dwell in his family, is that enough? It's better to be a door-keeper in his house, then enjoy the portion of the wicked. Thou shalt ever stand before him, about his Throne, in the room with him, in his presence chamber. Wouldst thou yet be nearer? Thou shalt be his child, and he thy Father; thou shalt be an heir of his Kingdom; yea more, the Spouse of his Son; and what more canst thou de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sire?

If Grace make a Christian differ so much from what he was, that the Christian could say to his Companion, <hi>Ego non sum ego, I am not the man I was</hi>; how much more will Glory make us differ?

But because we have no other name for them, let us call them Senses, call them Eyes and Ears, Seeing and Hearing: But thus much conceive of the differ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence; That as much as a Body Spiritual, above the Sun in Glory, exceedeth these frail, noisom, diseased Lumps of flesh or dirt, that now we carry about us; so far shall our sense of Seeing and Hear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing exceed these we now possess: For the change of the senses must be conceived proportionable to the change of the body. And doubtless as God advanceth our sense, and enlargeth our capacity; so will he advance the happiness of those senses, and fill up with himself all that capacity.<note place="margin">Yea, the Body.</note> And certainly the body should not be raised up, and continued, if it should not share of the Glory: For as it hath shared in the obedience and sufferings, so shall it also do in the blessedness: And as Christ bought the whole man, so shall the whole partake of the everlasting benefits of the purchase: The same difference is to be allowed for the Tongue.<note place="margin">The Tongue in praising.</note> For though per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>haps that which we now call the tongue, the voyce, or language, shal not then be: Yet, with the forementioned unconceiveable change, it may continue.

It can compass the Earth: It can measure the Sun, Moon, Stars, and Heaven: It can fore-know each Eclipse to a minute, many years before: Yea, but this is the top of all its excellency, It can know God who is infinite, who made all these; a little here, and more, much more hereafter. Oh the wisdom and goodness of our Blessed Lord! He hath created the Understanding with a Natural Byas, and inclination to Truth, as its object; and to the Prime Truth, as its Prime Object: and lest we should turn aside to any Creature, he hath kept this as his own Divine Prerogative, not communicable to any Creature, <hi>viz.</hi> to be the Prime Truth. And though I think not (as <note n="*" place="margin">Lord <hi>Brook,</hi> Union of the Soul &amp; Truth.</note> some do) that there is so neer a close, between the Understanding and Truth, as may produce a proper Union or Identity: Yet doubtless it's no such cold touch, or disdainful embrace, as is between these gross earthly Heterogeneals. The true, studious, contemplative man, knows this to be true; who feels as sweet embraces between his Intellect and Truth, and far more, then ever the quickest sense did in possessing its desired object. But the true, studious, contempla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tive Christian, knows it much more; who sometime hath felt more sweet embraces between his Soul and Jesus Christ, then all inferior Truth can afford. I know some Christians are kept short this way, especially the careless in their watch and walking; and those that are ignorant or negligent in the dayly actings of Faith, who look when God casts in Joys while they lie idle, and labor not to fetch them in by beleeving: But for others, I appeal to the most of them; Christian, dost thou not sometime, when, after long gazing heaven<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward, thou hast got a glimpse of Christ, dost thou not seem to have been with <hi>Paul</hi> in the third Heaven, whether in the body or out, and to have seen what is unutterable?

Didst thou never look so long upon the Sun of God, till thine Eyes were dazled with his astonishing glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry? and did not the splendor of it make all things below seem black and dark to thee, when thou lookest down again? Especi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally in thy day of suffering for Christ; (when he usually appears most manifestly to his people:) Didst thou never see one walking in the midst of the fiery furnace with thee, like to the Son of God? If thou do know him,<note place="margin">Hosea 6.2, 3.</note> value him as thy life, and follow on to know him, and thou shalt know incomparably more then this. Or if I do but renew thy grief to tell thee of what thou once didst feel, but now hast lost; I counsel thee to <hi>Remember whence thou art fallen, and Repent, and do the first works, and be watchful, and strengthen the things which remain</hi>;<note place="margin">Rev. 2 5. and 3.2.</note> and I dare promise thee, (be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause God hath promised,) thou shalt see, and know, that which here thine Eye could not see, nor thy Understanding conceive. Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leeve me Christians, yea, beleeve God, You that have known most of God in Christ here, it is as nothing to that you shall know; It scarce, in comparison of that, deserves to be called Knowledg. The difference betwixt our knowledg now, and our knowledg then, will be as great, as that between our fleshly bodies now, and our spiritual glorified bodies then. For as these bodies, so that knowledg must cease, that a more perfect may succeed. Our silly childish thoughts of God, which now is the highest we reach to, must give place to a manly knowledg. All this saith the Apostle, 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 13.8, 9, 10, 11, 12. <hi>Knowledg shall vanish away: For we know in part, &amp;c. But when that which is perfect is come, then that which is in part shall be done away. When I was a childe, I spake as childe, I thought as a childe, I understood as a childe; but when I became a man, I put away childish things. For now we see through a glass darkly, but then face to face: Now I know in part, but then I shall know, even as also I am known.</hi>

For our parts, we say with that knowing Apostle (though the speech may seem presumptuous) 1 <hi>John</hi> 5.19, 20. <hi>We know that we are of God, and the whole world lieth in wickedness: And we know that the Son of God is come, and hath given us an understanding, that we may know him that is True; and we are in him that is True, in his Son Jesus Christ: This is the true God, and eternal Life.</hi> Here one verse contains the sum of most that I have said. <hi>The Son of God is come</hi> (to be our Head and Fountain of Life) <hi>and so hath given us an under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>standing</hi> (that the Soul may be personally qualified and made capa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble) <hi>to know him</hi> (God) <hi>that is True,</hi> (the Prime Truth,) <hi>and we are</hi> (brought so near in this enjoyment, that) <hi>we are in him that is True</hi> (not properly by an essential or personal union, but we are in him, by being) <hi>in his Son Jesus Christ.

Didst thou make me to question the truth of this Glory? Didst thou shew me Improbabilities, and draw me to distrust the Lord? Didst thou question the Truth of that Scripture which promised this? Why my soul! art thou not now ashamed, that ever thou didst question that Love that hath brought thee hither? That thou wast Jealous of the faithfulness of thy Lord? That thou suspectest his Love, when thou shouldst only have suspected thy self?

Christian, thou wilt be then brim full of Love; yet love as much as thou canst, thou shalt be ten thousand times more beloved. Dost thou think thou canst overlove him? What! love more then Love it self? Were the Arms of the Son of God open upon the Cross, and an open passage made to his Heart by the Spear, and will not Arms and Heart be open to thee in Glory? Did he begin to love before thou lovedst, and will he not continue now? Did he love thee an enemy? thee a sinner? thee who even loathedst thy self? and own thee when thou didst disclaim thy self?

It's that, which all the rest lead to, and conclude in: even the unconceiveable Complacency which the Blessed feel in their seeing, knowing, loving, and being beloved of God. The delight of the Senses Here, cannot be known by expressions, as they are felt! How much less this Joy? This is the <hi>white stone, which none knoweth but he that receiveth:</hi>

All Christs ways of mercy tend to, and end in the Saints Joys. He wept, sorrowed, suffered, that they might rejoyce: He sendeth the Spirit to be their Comforter; He multiplieth pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mises, he discovers their future happiness; that their Joy may be full:<note place="margin">Joh. 15.11. and 16.24. and 17.13.</note> He aboundeth to them in mercies of all sorts; he maketh them lie down in green pastures, and leadeth them by the still wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters; yea, openeth to them the fountain of Living Waters; That their Joy may be full: That they may thirst no more; and that it may spring up in them to everlasting life: Yea, he causeth them to suffer,<note place="margin">Psa 94.12, 13</note> that he may cause them to rejoyce; and chasteneth them, that he may give them Rest; and maketh them (as he did himself) <hi>to drink of the brook in the way,</hi>

From All Sorrow to more then All Joy? Thou poor Soul, who prayest for Joy, waitest for Joy, complainest for want of Joy, longest for Joy; why, then thou shalt have full Joy, as much as thou canst hold, and more then ever thou thoughtest on, or thy heart desired: And in the mean time walk carefully, watch constantly, and then let God measure out thy times and degrees of Joy. It may be he keeps them till thou have more need: Thou mayst better lose thy comfort, then thy safety: If thou shouldst dye full of fears and sorrows, it will be but a moment and they are all gone, and concluded in Joy unconceiveable: As the Joy of the Hypocrite, so the fears of the upright, are but for a moment. And as their hopes are but golden dreams, which, when death awakes them, do all perish, and their hopes dye with them; so the Saints doubts and fears are but terrible dreams, which<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> when they dye, do all vanish; and they awake in Joyful Glory.

Oh blessed morning, thrice blessed morning! Poor, humble, drooping Soul, how would it fill thee with Joy now, if a voyce from Heaven should tell thee of the Love of God? of the pardon of thy sins? and should assure thee of thy part in these Joys? Oh, what then will thy Joy be, when thy actual Possession shall convince thee of thy Title, and thou shalt be in Heaven before thou art well aware; When the Angels shall bring thee to Christ, and when Christ shall (as it were) take thee by the hand, and lead thee into the purchased possession, and bid thee welcom to his Rest, and present thee unspotted before his Father, and give thee thy place about his Throne? Poor Sinner; what sayest thou to such a day as this? Wilt thou not be almost ready to draw back, and to say, What, I Lord? I the unworthy Neglecter of thy Grace! I the unworthy dis-esteemer of thy blood, and slighter of thy Love! must I have this Glory? Make me a hired servant, I am no more worthy to be called a son: But Love will have it so; therefore must thou enter into his Joy.</p>

Yea, it is the Joy of Jesus Christ: For now he hath the end of his under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taking, labor, suffering, dying, when we have our Joys; When he is Glorified in his Saints,<note place="margin">2 Thes. 1, 10.</note> and admired in all them that beleeve. We are his seed, and the fruit of his Souls travel, which when he seeth, he will be satisfied, <hi>Isa.</hi> 53.10, 11. This is Christs Harvest, when he shall reap the fruit of his labors, and when he seeth it was not in vain, it will not repent him concerning his sufferings; but he will rejoyce over his purchased inheritance, and his people shall rejoyce in him.</p>
                        <p>Yea, the Father himself puts on Joy too, in our Joy; As we grieve his Spirit, and weary him with our iniquities; so is he re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>joyced in our Good: Oh how quickly Here, doth he spy a Return<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing Prodigal, even afar off? how doth he run, and meet him? and with what compassion falls he on his neck, and kisseth him? and puts on him the best robe, and ring on his hands, and shoes on his feet, and spares not to kill the fatted Calf, that they may eat and be merry: This is indeed a happy meeting; But nothing to the Embracements, and the Joy, of that last and great Meeting.</p>

Can he make a Camel go through the eye of a needle? Can he make such a blinde Sinner, as thou, to see? and such a proud heart, as thine, to stoop? and such an Earthly minde, as thine, Heavenly? And subdue all that, thy fleshly foolish wisdom? And is not this as great a work, as to Raise thee from the Dust? Wast thou any unlikelier to Be, when thou wast Nothing, then thou shalt be when thou art Dust? Is it not as easie to raise the Dead, as to make Heaven, and Earth, and all, of Nothing? But if thou be unperswadeable, all I say to thee more is, as the Prophet to the Prince of <hi>Samaria,</hi> (2 <hi>King.</hi> 7.20.) Thou shalt see that day with thine Eyes, but little to thy Comfort; for that which is the day of relief to the Saints, shall be a day of Revenge on thee: There is a Rest prepared, but thou canst not <hi>enter in, because of unbelief, Heb.</hi> 3.19. But for thee, O Beleeving Soul, never think to comprehend in the narrow capa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>city of thy shallow brain, the Counsels, and ways of thy Maker: No more then thou canst contain in thy fist the vast Ocean. He ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver intended thee such a Capacity, when he made thee, and gave thee that measure thou hast; no more then he intended to enable that worm, or this post, or stone, fully to know thee. Therefore when he speaks, dispute not, but beleeve. As <hi>Abraham,</hi> who <hi>consider<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed not his own body now dead, when he was about an hundred years old, nor yet the deadness of Sarahs womb; He staggered not at the Promise of God through unbelief: but was strong in faith, giving Glory to God: And being fully perswaded, that what he had promised, he was also able to perform.</hi> And so <hi>against Hope, beleeved in Hope, Rom.</hi> 4.18, 19, 20, 21. So look not thou on the dead bones, and dust, and difficulties, but at the Promise: <hi>Martha</hi> knew her Brother should rise again at the Resurrection; But if Christ say, he shall rise before, it must be beleeved. Come then, fellow Christians let us contentedly commit these Carcasses to the dust: That prison shall not long contain them. Let us lie down in peace and take our Rest: It will not be an Everlasting Night,

As sure as we awake in the Morning, when we have slept out the Night; so sure shall we then awake. And what if in the mean time we must be loathsom Lumps, cast out of the sight of men, as not fit to be endured among the Living? What if our Carcasses become as vile as those of the Beasts that perish? What if our bones be digged up, and scattered about the pit brink, and worms consume our flesh? Yet we know our Redeemer liveth, and shall stand the last on earth, and we shall see him with these eyes. And withal, it is but this flesh that suffers all this; which hath been a Clog to our Souls so long: And what is this comely piece of flesh, which thou art loath should come to so base a state? It is not an hundred years since it was either Nothing, or an invisible Something. And is not most of it for the present, if not an Appear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing Nothing, seeming something to an imperfect sense; yet at best a Condensation of Invisibles, which that they may become sensible, are become more gross, and so more vile? Where is all that fair mass of flesh and blood which thou hadst, before sickness consumed thee? Annihilated it is not: onely resolved into its Principles: shew it me if thou canst. Into how small a handful of dust, or ashes, will that whole mass, if buried or burnt, return? And into how much smaller can a Chymist reduce that little, and leave thee all the rest Invisible? What if God prick the Bladder, and let out the wind that puffs thee up to such a substance? and resolve thee into thy Principles? Doth not the seed thou sowest dye, before it spring? and what cause have we to be tender of this body? Oh, what care, what labor, what grief, and sorrow, hath it cost us? How many a weary, painful, tedious hour? Oh my Soul, Grudg not that God should disburden thee of all this! Fear not lest he should free thee from thy fetters! Be not so loath that he should break down thy prison, and let thee go! What though some ter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rible Earthquake go before! It is but that the foundations of the prison may be shaken, and so the doors fly open: The terror will be to thy Jaylor, but to thee Deliverance. Oh therefore at what

                        <p>It's a Question much debated, Whether a Resurrection be onely an effect of Christs Death and Resurrection?

That the Sin under the Covenant of Nature, or Works, did deserve onely the separation of Soul and Body; and not Eternal Torments. Whence also follows, that the Soul is (or, at least, then was) Mor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tal; or that it hath no Being, or no Sense, when it's separated from the Body. As also, that Christ dyed to Redeem us onely from the Grave, and not from Hell. And so their Doctrine of Universal Redemption, in this sence asserted, doth neither so much honor the merits of Christ, nor advance his mercy, as they pretend: For it maketh him to raise us onely from the Grave, and bring all the world into a Capacity of Eternal Torment: He fore-knowing the same time, that most would certainly reject him, and so perish. But, as I confess these of weight and difficulty; so, having profess<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed in this Discourse, to handle matters less controverted; I preter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mit them.</p>
                        <p>This sufficeth to the Saints Comfort, That Resurrection to Glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry, is onely the fruit of Christs Death; and this fruit they shall cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainly partake of. The Promise is sure: <hi>All that are in the Graves shall hear his voyce, and come forth, Joh.</hi> 5.28. <hi>And this is the Fathers will which hath sent Christ, that of all which he hath given him, he should lose nothing, but should Raise it up at the last Day, Joh.</hi> 6.39. <hi>And that every one that beleeveth on the Son may have Everlasting Life, and he will raise him up at the last Day,</hi> Vers. 40. If the prayers of the Prophet could raise the <hi>Shu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>namites</hi> Dead Childe: and if the dead Souldier revive at the touch of the Prophets bones:<note place="margin">2 King 13.21</note> How certainly shall the will of Christ, and the power of his death raise us? That voyce that said to <hi>Jairus</hi> Daughter, <hi>Arise,</hi> and to <hi>Lazarus, Arise, and come forth,</hi> can do the like for us. If his death immediately raised the dead bodies of many Saints in <hi>Jerusalem</hi>; If he gave power to his Apostles to raise the Dead: Then what doubt of our Resurrection? And thus, Christian, thou seest that (Christ having sanctified the Grave by his burial, and conquered Death, and broke the Ice, for us,) a dead Body, and a Grave, is not now so horrid a spectacle to a be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leeving Eye: But as our Lord was neerest his Resurrection and Glory, when he was in the Grave, even so are we. And he that hath promised to make our bed in sickness, will make the dust as a bed of Roses: Death shall not dissolve the Union betwixt him and us; nor turn away his affections from us: But in the morning of Eternity, he will send his Angels, yea, come himself, and roll away

When an hundred Sermons, Sab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>baths, Mercies, shall each step up and say, I am witness, against the Prisoner, Lord; I was abused, and I was neglected! Oh which way will the wretched sinner look? Oh who can conceive the ter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rible thoughts of his heart?

The time was, Sinner, when Christ would, and you would not; and now, Oh how fain would you, and he will not. Then he followed thee in vain with entreaties, Oh poor Sinner, what dost thou?

Will it do thee good to think how rich thou wast? and how honorable thou wast? or will it not rather wound thy very Soul to remember thy folly? and make thee, with anguish of heart, and rage against thy self, to cry out, Oh Wretch! where was thine understanding?

How couldst thou slight such warnings? and rage against the Minister, and say, he preacheth Damnation? Had it not been better to have heard and prevented it, then now to en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dure it? Oh now for one offer of Christ, for one Sermon, for one day of Grace more!

                           <hi>before God, and the Lord Jesus Christ, who shall judg the quick and the dead at his appearing, and his Kingdom</hi>; that thou make hast and get alone, and set thy self sadly to ponder on these things: Ask thy heart, Is this true, or is it not? Is there such a day? and must I see it? Oh what do I then? Why trifle I? Is it not time, full time, that I had made sure of Christ and comfort long ago? should I sit still another day, who have lost so many? Had I not at that day rather be found one of the Holy, faithful, watchful Christians, then a worldling, a good-fellow, or a man of honor? Why should I not then choose it now? Will it be best then, and is it not best now? Oh think of these things. A few sad hours spent in serious fore-thoughts, is a cheap prevention. It's worth this, or It's worth nothing. Friend, I profess to thee, from the Word of the Lord, That of all thy sweet sins, there will then be nothing left, but the sting in thy Conscience, which will never out through all eternity; except the blood of Christ beleeved in, and valued above all the world, do now, in this day of grace, get it out. Thy sin is like a Beautiful Harlot; while she is young and fresh, she hath many followers: but when old and withered,

Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stian, Did he come down, and suffer, and weep<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> and bleed, and dye for thee; and will he now condemn thee?

Nay, hath he begun, and will he not finish? Hath he interceded so long for thee to the Father? and will he cast thee away himself? If all these be likely, then fear, and then rejoyce not. Oh what an unreasonable sin is unbelief, that will charge our Lord with such unmercifulness and absurdities? Well then, fellow Christians, let the terror of that day be never so great, surely our Lord can mean no ill to us in all. Let it make the Devils tremble, and the wicked tremble; but it shall make us to leap for Joy. Let Satan accuse us, we have our answer at hand, our surety hath dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>charged the debt. If he have not fulfilled the Law, then let us be charged as breakers of it: If he have not suffered, then let us suffer: but if he have, we are free.

ready to speak against it self (<hi>Lord, when did we see thee hungry, and feed thee, &amp;c.</hi>) yet will not Christ do so. This is the day of the Beleevers full Justification. They were before made just: and esteemed Just: and by Faith justified in Law: and this evidenced to their consciences. But now they shall both by Apology be main<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tained Just, and by Sentence pronounced Just actually, by the live<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly voyce of the Judg himself; which is the most perfect Justificati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on.

Therefore well may it be called, <hi>the Time of Refreshing,</hi> as being to the Saints the perfecting of all their for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer Refreshments. He who was vexed with a quarrelling Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>science, an Accusing World, a Cursing Law, is solemnly pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nounced Righteous by the Lord the Judg. Though he cannot plead, Not Guilty, in regard of fact; yet being pardoned, he shall be ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quit by the proclamation of Christ. And that's not all: But he that was accused, as deserving Hell, is pronounced a member of Christ, a Son of God, and so adjudged to Eternal Glory. The Sentence of pardon, past by the spirit and conscience within us, was wont to be exceeding sweet: But this will fully and finally resolve the questi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on; and leave no room for doubting again for ever. We shall more rejoyce that our names are found written in the Book of Life, then if men or Devils were subjected to us. And it must needs affect us deeply with the sense of our mercy and happiness, to behold the contrary condition of others: To see most of the world tremble with Terror, while we triumph with Joy: To hear them doomed to everlasting flames, and see them thrust into Hell; when we are proclaimed heirs of the Kingdom: To see our neighbors that lived in the same Towns, came to the same Congregation, sate in the same seats, dwelt in the same houses, and were esteemed more ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>norable in the world then our selves; to see them now so differ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>enced from us, and by the Searcher of hearts eternally separated. This, with the great magnificence and dreadfulness of the day, doth the Apostle pathetically express in 2 <hi>Thess.</hi> 1.6, 7, 8, 9, 10. <hi>It is Righteous with God to recompence tribulation to them that trouble you: and to you who are troubled, Rest with us: when the Lord

Jesus shall be revealed from Heaven with his mighty Angels; In flaming fire, taking vengeance on then that know not God, and obey not the Gospel of our Lord Jesus Christ; who shall be punished with everlasting destruction from the presence of the Lord, and from the Glory of his power, &amp;c.</hi> And now is not here enough to make that day a welcom day, and the thoughts of it delightful to us? But yet there's more. We shall be so far from the dread of that Judgment, that our selves shall become the Judges. Christ will take his people, as it were, into Commission with him; and they shall sit and approve his Righteous Judgment: Oh fear not now the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proaches, scorns and censures of those that must then be judged by us: Did you think, Oh wretched worldlings, that those poor de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>spised men, whom you made your dayly derision, should be your Judges? Did you beleeve this, when you made them stand as of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fenders before the Bar of your Judgment? No more then <hi>Pilate,</hi> when he was judging Christ, did beleeve that he was condemning his Judg; Or the Jews, when they were whipping, imprisoning, killing the Apostles, did think to see them sit on twelve Thrones Judging the twelve Tribes of <hi>Israel.

Hookers</hi> Dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>course of Ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stification, how far <hi>Works</hi> concur.</note> I shall, in another Book, add, to what is said before, certain brief Positions, containing my thoughts on this Subject; which may tend to the clearing of these and many other difficulties hereabouts.</p>
                        <p>But that the plain constant language of Scripture may not be per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verted or disregarded, I onely premise these Advertisements by way of caution, till thou come to read the full Answer:</p>
                        <p n="1">1. Let not the names of men draw thee one way or other, nor make thee partial in Searching for Truth: Dislike the men for their unsound doctrine; but call not doctrine unsound, because it is theirs; nor sound, because of the repute of the Writer.</p>
                        <p n="2">2. Know this, That as an unhumbled Soul is far apter to give too much to Duty and personal Righteousness, then to Christ: So a humble self-denying Christian is as likely to err on the other hand, in giving less to duty then Christ hath given, and laying all the work from himself on Christ, for fear of robbing Christ of the honor: and so much to look at Christ without him, and think he should look at nothing in himself; that he forgets Christ within him. As <hi>Luther</hi> said of <hi>Melancthons</hi> self-denying humility, <hi>Soli Deo omaia deberi tam obstinaté asserit, ut mihi plané vidcatur saltem in hoc errare quòd Christum ipse fingat longiùs abesse cordi suo, quam sit reverâ—Certé nimis nullus in hoc est Philippus.</hi> He so constantly ascribes all to God, that to me he seems directly to err at least in this, that he feigneth or imagineth Christ to be fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
<pb n="68" facs="tcp:61132:50"/>
off from his own heart, then indeed he is—Certainly he is too much Nothing in this.</p>
                        <p n="3">3. Our giving to Christ more of the work then Scripture doth, or rather our ascribing it to him out of the Scripture way and sence; doth but dishonor, and not honor him; and depress, but not exalt his Free Grace: While we deny the inward sanctifying work of his Spirit, and extol his free Justification, which are equal fruits of his merit, we make him an imperfect Saviour.</p>
                        <p>And thus we have, by the line and plummet of Scripture, fathom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed this four-fold stream, and seen the Christian safely landed in Para<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dise; and in this four-wheeled fiery Charet conveyed honorably to his Rest. Now let us a little further view those Mansions, consider his priviledges, and see whether there be any Glory like unto his Glory; Read, and judg, but not by outward appearance, but judg Righteous Judgment.</p>

And first before we speak of them parti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cularly, let us try this Happiness by the Rules of the Philosopher, and see whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther they will not approve it the more transcendently Good: Not as if they were a sufficient Touchstone; but that both the Worldling and the Saint may see, when any thing stands up in competition with this Glory for the preheminence, Reason it self will conclude a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainst it. Now, in order of good, the Philosopher will tell you, that by these Rules you may know which is Best.</p>

                        <p n="1">1. THat which is desired and sought for it self,<note place="margin">§. 1.</note> is better then that which is desired for something else: or the End, as such, is better then all the Means. This concludeth for Heavens preheminence: All things are but means to that end. If any thing here be excellent, it is because it is a step to that: and the more conducible thereto, the more excellent. The Salvation of our Souls is the end of our Faith,<note place="margin">1 Pet. 1.5, 9. 1 Thess. 5.8. 2 Tim. 2.10.</note> of our Hope, our Diligence, of all Mercies, of all Ordinances, as before is proved: It is not for themselves, but
<pb n="70" facs="tcp:61132:51"/>
for this Rest, that all these are desired and used. Praying is not the end of Praying; nor Preaching the end of Preaching; nor Beleev<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the end of Beleeving; these are but the way to him who is the way to this Rest.<note place="margin">John 14 6.</note> Indeed Christ himself is both the way and the Rest, the means and the end; singularly desireable as the way, but yet more as the end. If any thing then that ever you saw or enjoyed appear lovely and desireable, then must its end be so much more.</p>

Now this Rest is the Saints last estate: Their beginning was as a Grain of Mustard-seed, but their perfection will be an estate high and flourishing. They were taken with <hi>David</hi> from the sheep-fold, to reign as Kings for ever. Their first Day was a day of small things; but their last will be an everlasting perfection: They sowed in tears,<note place="margin">Psa. 126.5.</note> but they reap in Joy. If their prosperity here, their <hi>res secundae,</hi> were desireable; much more their <hi>res ultimae,</hi> their final Blessedness. <hi>Rondeletius</hi> saw a Priest at <hi>Rome,</hi> who would fall down in an Extasie when ever he heard those words of Christ,<note place="margin">
                              <hi>Rondeletius in Method Curan. cap. de Catal. pag.</hi> 98.</note> 
                           <hi>Consummatum est,</hi> It is finished: but observing him careful in his fall ever to lay his head in a soft place, he suspected the dissimulati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, and by the threats of a cudgel quickly recovered him. But me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thinks the fore-thoughts of that Consummation, and last estate we speak of, should bring a considering Christian into such an unfeign<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed Extasie, that he should even forget the things of the flesh, and no care or fear should raise him out of it. Surely that is well, which ends well; and that's Good, which is Good at last; and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore Heaven must needs be Good.</p>

<pb n="71" facs="tcp:61132:51"/>
tell you more sensibly then I can. For as none know the sweetness like those who enjoy it, so none know the loss like those that are deprived of it. Wicked men are here sensless of the loss, because they know not what they lose, and have the delights of flesh and sense to take them up, and make them forget it: But when they shall know it to their Torment, as the Saints do to their Joy, and when they shall see men from the East and West sit down with <hi>A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>braham,</hi>

He that loseth Riches may have more; and he that loseth honor, may repair it; or if not, yet he is not undone: He that loseth life,<note place="margin">Mark 8.35.</note> may save it: But what becomes of him that loseth God? and who or what shall repair his loss? We can bear the loss of any thing below: if we have it not, we can either live without it, or dye, and live eternally without it: But can we do so without God in Christ?<note place="margin">Mat. 6.33.</note> As God gives us outward things, as auctuaries, as over-plus, or above measure, into our bargain; so, when he takes them from us, he takes away our superfluities rather then our necessaries; and pareth but our nails, and toucheth not the quick: But can we so spare our part in Glory? You know whose Question it is,<note place="margin">Mat 16.26.</note>

Or, what shall a man give for the ransom of his Soul? Christians, com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pare but all your losses with that loss, and all your sufferings with that suffering, and I hope you will lay your hand upon your mouth, and cease your repining thoughts for ever.</p>

                        <p n="4">4. ANother Rule is this, That which cannot be given by man, or taken away by man, is ever better then that which can; And then I hope Heaven will carry it. For who hath the Key of the everlasting Treasures? And who is the Disposer of the Dignities of the Saints? Who saith, <hi>Come ye Blessed, and go ye Cursed?</hi> Is it the voyce of God, or of meer man? If every good and perfect gift cometh from above,<note place="margin">Jam. 1.17.</note> from the Father of Lights; whence then cometh the gift of Eternal Light with the Father? Whose privi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledg
<pb n="72" facs="tcp:61132:52"/>
soever it is, to be Key-keepers of the visible Churches here be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low; sure no meer man, but the Man of Sin, will challenge the Keyes of that Kingdom, and undertake to shut out, or take in, or to dispose of that Treasure of the Church. We may be beholden to men, as Gods instruments, for our Faith, but no fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther: For <hi>what is Paul, or who is Apolio? but Ministers by whom we beleeved,</hi>
                           <note place="margin">1 Cor. 3.5.</note> 
                           <hi>even as the Lord gave to every man?</hi> Surely every step to that Glory, every gracious gift and act, every deliverance and mercy to the Church, shall be so clearly from God; that his very name shall be written in the forehead of it, and his excellent Attributes stampt upon it, that he who runs may read, it was the work of God: and the Question may easily be answered, whether it be from Heaven, or of men? Much more evidently is that Glory the gift of the God of Glory. What? can man give God? or earth and dust give Heaven? Surely no! And as much is it beyond them to deprive us of it. Tyrants and persecutors may take away our Goods, but not our chief Good, our Liberties here, but not that state of Freedom; our Heads, but not our Crown. You can shut us up in Prisons, and shut us out of your Church and Kingdom; but now shut us out of Heaven if you can. Try in lower attempts: Can you deny us the light of the Sun, and cause it to forbear its shining? Can you stop the influences of the Planets? or deny us the dew of Heaven? or command the Clouds to shut up their womb? or stay the course of the flowing streams? or seal up the passages of the deep? how much less can you deprive us of our God, or deny us the light of his countenance, or stop the influ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ences of his Spirit, or forbid the dew of his Grace to fall, or stay the streams of his Love, and shut up his overflowing ever-flowing Springs, or seal up the bottomless depth of his bounty? You can kill our Bodies (if he permit you) but try whether you can reach our Souls. Nay, it is not in the Saints own power to give to, or take away from themselves this Glory. So that according to this Rule, there's no state like the Saints Rest. For no man can give this Rest to us, and none can take our Joy from us, <hi>Joh.</hi> 16.22.</p>

                        <p n="5">5. ANother Rule is this, That is ever better or best, which maketh the owner or possessor himself better or best. And
<pb n="73" facs="tcp:61132:52"/>
sure according to this Rule, there's no state like Heaven. Riches, honor, and pleasure, make a man neither better nor best: Grace here makes us better, but not best: That is reserved as the Prero<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gative of Glory. That's our Good, that doth us Good: and that doth us Good, which makes us Good: Else it may be Good in it self, but no good to us. External Good is at too great a distance to be our Happiness. It is not bread on our Tables, but in our stomacks that must nourish: nor blood upon our clothes or skin, but in the Liver, heart and veins which is our Life. Nay, the things of the world are so far from making the owners Good, that they prove, not the least impediments thereto; and snares to the best of men. Riches and honor do seldom help to humility; but of pride they occasionally become most frequent fomentors. The difficulty is so great of conjoyning Graciousness with Greatness, that it's next to an impossibility: And their conjunction so rare, that they are next to inconsistent. To have a heart taken up with Christ and Heaven, when we have health and abundance in the world, is neither easie nor ordinary. Though Soul and Body compose but one man, yet they seldom prosper both together. Therfore that's our chief Good, which will do us Good at heart: and that's our true Glory, that makes us all Glorious within: and that the Blessed day, which will make us holy and blessed men: which will not onely beautifie our House, but cleanse our Hearts: nor onely give us new Habitations, and new Relations, but also new Souls, and new Bodies. The true knowing living Christian complains more frequently and more bit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terly of the wants and woes within him, then without him. If you over-hear his prayers, or see him in his tears, and ask him, what aileth him? he will cry out more, Oh my dark understanding! Oh my hard, my unbeleeving heart! rather then, Oh my dishonor! or Oh my poverty! Therefore it is his desired place and state which af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fords a relief suitable to his necessities and complaints. And surely that is onely this Rest.</p>

By necessity is meant here, that which we cannot live without; and by abundance, is meant, a more perfect supply, a comfortable, not a useless abundance. Indeed it is suitable to a Christians state and use, to be scanted here, and to have onely from hand to mouth: And that not onely in his corporal, but in his spiritual comforts; Here we must not be filled full, that so our emptiness may cause hungering and our hungering cause seeking and craving, and our craving testifie our dependance, and occasion receiving, and our receiving occasion thanks-return<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, and all advance the Glory of the Giver. But when we shall be brought to the Well-head, and united close to the overflowing
<pb n="74" facs="tcp:61132:53"/>
Fountain, we shall then thirst no more, because we shall be empty no more. Surely if those Blessed Souls did not abound in their Bless<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>edness, they would never so abound in praises. Such Blessing, and Honor, and Glory, and Praise to God, would never accompany common mercies: All those <hi>Alleluja's</hi> are not sure the language of needy men.<note place="margin">Prov. 18.23.</note> Now, we are poor, we speak supplications: And our Beggars tone discovers our low condition: All our Language al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>most is complaining and craving; our breath sighing, and our life a laboring. But sure where all this is turned into eternal praising and rejoycing, the case must needs be altered, and all wants suppplied and forgotten. I think their Hearts full of Joy, and their mouthes full of thanks, proves their estate abounding full of Blessedness.</p>

Though, it's true, the Judgment of imperfect man, can be no perfect Rule of Truth or Goodness: Yet God revealeth this Good to all on whom he will bestow it; and hides not from his people the end they should aim at and attain. If the Holiest men are the Best and Wisest, then their Lives tell you their Judgments; and their unwearied labor and suf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferings for this Rest, shews you, they take it for the perfection of their Happiness. If men of greatest experience be the wisest men, and they that have tryed both estates; then surely, it's vanity and vexation that's found below, and solid Happiness and Rest above. If dying men are wiser then others; who by the worlds forsaking them, and by the approach of Eternity, begin to be undeceived; then surely Happiness is hereafter, and not here: For though the deluded world in their flourishing prosperity can bless themselves in their fools paradise, and merrily jest at the simplicity of the Saints; yet scarce one of many, even of the worst of them, but are ready at last to cry out with <hi>Balaam, Oh that I might dye the death of the righteous, and my last end might be like his.</hi> Never take heed therefore what they think or say now, for as sure as they shall dye, they will one of these days think and say clean contrary.

why should we regard what wicked men say now, who are drunk with security and fleshly delights? When we know before hand for certain, that when they have slept the sleep of death, at the fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thest, they will awake in another minde. Onely pity the perverted understandings of these poor men who are beside themselves; knowing, that one of these days, when too late experience brings them to their right mindes, they will be of a far different Judgment. They ask us, What, are you wiser then your fore-fathers? then all the Town besides? then such and such Great men, and learned men? And do you think in good sadness we may not with better reason ask you, What? are you wiser then <hi>Henoch,</hi> and <hi>Noah?</hi> then <hi>Abraham, Isaac, Jacob, Samuel?</hi> then <hi>David</hi> and <hi>Solomon?</hi> then <hi>Moses</hi> and the Prophets? then <hi>Peter, Paul,</hi> all the Apostls, and all the Saints of God, in all Ages and Nations, that ever went to Heaven? yea, then Jesus Christ himself? Men may be deceived, but we appeal to the unerring Judgment of Wisdom it self, even the wise All-Knowing God, whether <hi>a day in his Courts be not better then a thousand elsewhere?</hi>

And where do you think in Reason, that all the streams of Good<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness do finally empty themselves? Is it not in God, from whom by secret springs they first proceed? Where else do all the Lines of Goodness concenter? Are not all the sparks contained in this fire? and all the drops in this Ocean? Surely the time was, when there was nothing besides God: and then all Good was onely in him. And even now the creatures essence and existence is secondary, deri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved, contingent, improper, in comparison of his, <hi>who Is, and Was, and Is to Come</hi>; whose Name alone is called, <hi>I AM.</hi> What do thine eyes see, or thy heart conceive desireable, which is not there to be

Brethren, do you fear losing or parting with any thing you now enjoy? What? do you fear you shall want when you come to Heaven? shall you want the drops, when you have the Ocean? or the light of the Candle, when you have the Sun? or the shallow Creature, when you have the perfect Creator? <hi>Cast thy bread upon the waters, and after many days,</hi>

Cast away Friends, House, Lands, Life, if he bid thee: Leap into the Sea,<note place="margin">Mark 8.35.</note> as <hi>Peter,</hi> if he command thee: Lose thy life, and thou shalt save it everlastingly; when those that saved theirs, shall lose them everlastingly: Venture all, man, upon Gods Word &amp; Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mise: There's a Day of Rest coming will fully pay for all. All the pence and the farthings thou expendest for him, are contained, with infinite advantage, in the massie Gold and Jewels of thy Crown. When <hi>Alexander</hi> had given away his Treasure, and they asked him where it was; he pointed to the poor, and said, <hi>in scriniis,</hi> in my chests. And when he went upon a hopeful expedition, he gave a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>way his Gold; and when he was asked, what he kept for himself, he answers, <hi>spem majorum &amp; meliorum,</hi> The hope of greater and better things. How much more boldly may we lay out all, and point to Heaven, and say it is, <hi>in scriniis,</hi> in our everlasting treasure: and take that hope of greater and better things, in stead of all. Nay, lose thy self for God, and renounce thy self; and thou shalt at that day finde thy self again in him.

To think that in the streams of this Blood we have swam through the violence of the world, the snares of Satan, the seducements of flesh, the curse of the Law, the wrath of an offended God, the accusations of a Guilty Conscience, and the vexing doubts and fears of an un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>beleeving heart, and are passed through all, and here arrived safely at the brest of God! Now we are stupified with vile and sensless hearts, that can hear all the story of this Bloody Love, and read all the dolors and sufferings of Love, and hear all his sad complaints, and all with dulness, and unaffected. He cries to us, <hi>Behold and see; Is it nothing to you, O all ye that pass by? Is there any sorrow like unto my sorrow?</hi> (<hi>Lamen.</hi> 1.12.) and we will scarce hear or re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gard the dolorous voyce; nor scarce turn aside to view the wounds of him, who turned aside, and took us up, to heal our wounds at this so dear a rate. But Oh then our perfected Souls will feel as well as hear, and with feeling apprehensions flame again in Love for Love. Now we set his picture wounded and dying before our eyes, but can get it no neerer our hearts, then if we beleeved nothing of what we read. But then when the obstructions between the eye and the understanding are taken away, and the passage opened be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween the head and the heart; surely our eyes will everlastingly af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect our heart: and while we view with one eye our slain-revived Lord, and with the other eye our lost-recovered Souls, and transcen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent Glory, these views will eternally pierce us, and warm our very Souls. And those eyes, through which folly and lust hath so often stole into our hearts, shall now be the Casements to let in the Love of our dearest Lord for ever. Now, though we should (as some do) travel to <hi>Jerusalem,</hi> and view the Mount of <hi>Olives</hi> where he prayed and wept; and see the Dolorons way by which he bare his Cross, and enter the Temple of the Holy Grave; yea, if we should with <hi>Peter</hi> have stooped down and seen the place where he lay, and behold his Relicts; yet these Bolted doors of sin and flesh would have kept out the feeling of all that Love.

But we shall behold, as it were, the wounds of Love, with eyes and hearts of Love for ever. Suppose (a little to help our apprehensions) that a Saint, who hath partaked of the Joys of Heaven, had been translated from as long an abode in Hell, and after the experience of such a change, should have stood with <hi>Mary</hi> and the rest by the Cross of Christ, and have seen the Blood, and heard the Groans of his Redeemer: What think you? Would love have stirred in his Brest or no? Would the voyce of his dying Lord have melted his heart, or no? Oh that I were sensible of what I speak! With what astonishing apprehensions then, will Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deemed Saints everlastingly behold their Blessed Redeemer? I will not meddle with their vain audacious Question, who must needs know, whether the glorified body of Christ do yet retain either the wounds or scars. But this is most certain, that the memory of it will be as fresh, and the impressions of Love as deep, and its work<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings as strong, as if his wounds were still in our eyes, and his complaints still in our ears, and his blood still streaming afresh. Now his heart is open to us, and ours shut to him: But when his heart shall be open, and our Hearts open, Oh the Blessed Congress that there will then be! What a passionate meeting was there be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween our new-risen Lord, and the first sinful silly woman that he appears to?

What a meeting of Love then will there be, between the new glorified Saint, and the Glorious Redeemer? But I am here at a loss: my apprehensions fail me, and fall so short.

But we shall value these waters more highly, and yet drink them the more sweetly, because they are the Blood of Christ, not jeoparded onely, but shed for them. They will be the more sweet and dear to us, because they were so bitter and Dear to him. If the buyer be judicious, we estimate things by the price they cost. If any thing we enjoy were purchased with the life of our dearest friend, how highly should we value it? Nay, if a Dying Friend deliver us but a token of his Love, how carefully do we preserve it? and still remember him when we behold it, as if his own name were written on it?

                        <p>Yet understand this rightly; Not that this highest Glory was in strictest proper sense purchased, or that it was the most immediate Effect of Christs death: We must take heed that we conceive not of God as a Tyrant, who so delighteth in cruelty, as to exchange mercies for stripes, or to give a Crown on condition he may tor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment men. God was never so pleased with the sufferings of the Innocent, much lesse of his Sonne, as to sell his mercy properly for their sufferings. Fury dwelleth not in him; nor doth he willingly correct the sons of men; nor take pleasure in the death of him that dieth. But the sufferings of Christ were primarily and immediatly to satisfie the justice that required blood, and to bear what was due to the sinner, and to receive the blow that should have fallen upon him, &amp; so to restore him to the life he lost, and the happiness he fell from. But this dignity, which surpasseth the first, is, as it were, from the redundancy of his merit, or a secondary fruit of his death. The work of his Redemption so well pleased the Father, that he gave him power to advance his chosen to a higher dignity then they fell from; and to give them the glory which was given to himself, and all this according to his counsell, and the good pleasure of his own will.</p>

                        <p>THirdly.<note n="8" place="margin">It is the Saints pecu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liar.</note> The third comfortable Attribute of this Rest is, That it is the Saints prop and peculiar possession. It belongs to no other of all the sons of men; not that it would have de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tracted from the greatness or freeness of the gift, if God had so pleased, that all the world should have enjoyed it: But when God hath resolved otherwise, that it must be enjoyed but by few; to finde our names among that number, must needs make us the more to value our enjoyment. If all <hi>Egypt</hi> had been light, the <hi>Israelites</hi> should not have had the less; but yet to enjoy that light alone, while their neighbors live in thick darkness, must make them more sensible of their priviledg. Distinguishing, separating Mercy, affecteth more then any Mercy. If it should rain on our grounds alone; or the Sun shine upon our alone habitations; or the blessing of Heaven divide between our flocks, and other mens, as between <hi>Jacobs</hi> and <hi>Labans</hi>; we should more feelingly ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>knowledg Mercy, then now, while we possess the same in com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon. Ordinariness dulleth our sense; and if Miracles were com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon, they would be slighted. If <hi>Pharoah</hi> had passed as safely as <hi>Israel,</hi> the Red Sea would have been less remembred. If the first-born of <hi>Egypt</hi> had not been slain, the first-born of <hi>Israel</hi> had not been the Lords peculiar. If the rest of the World had not been drowned, and the rest of <hi>Sodom</hi> and <hi>Gomorrah</hi> burned, the saving of <hi>Noah</hi> had been no wonder, nor <hi>Lots</hi> deliverance so much talked of. The lower the weighty end of the ballance de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>scends, the higher is the other lifted up; and the falling of one of the sails of the Wind-Mill, is the occasion of the rising of the other. It would be no extenuation of the Mercies of the Saints here; if all the world were as holy as they, and the communica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of their Happiness is their greatest desire; yet it might per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>haps dull their thankfulness, and differencing grace would not be known. But when one shall be illightened, and another left in darkness; one reformed, and another by his lusts enslaved; it makes them cry out with the Disciple,<note place="margin">John 14.22. Luk 4.24, 25, 26, 27.</note> Lord what is it, that thou wilt reveal thy self to us, and not unto the world? When the Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phet shall be sent to one Widow onely of all that were in <hi>Sama<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ria,</hi> and to cleanse one <hi>Naaman</hi> of all the Lepers; the Mercy is
<pb n="82" facs="tcp:61132:61"/>
more observable. O that will sure be a day of passionate sense on both sides; when two shall be in a Bed, and two in the field, the one taken, and the other forsaken. For a Christian who is con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>scious of his own undeserving, and il-deserving, to see his com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>panion in sin perish; his Neighbor, Kinsman, Father, Mother, Wife, Childe, for ever in Hell, while he is preferred among the Blessed! To see other mens sins eternally plagued, while his are all pardoned! To see those that were wont to sit with us in the same seat, and eat with us at the same Table, and joyn with us in the same Duties, now to lie tormented in those flames, while we are triumphing in Divine Praises! That <hi>Lot</hi> must leave his sons in law in the flames of <hi>Sodom,</hi> and the wife of his bosom as a Monu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of Divine Vengeance, and escape with his two Daughters alone. Here is chusing, distinguishing Mercy! Therefore the Scripture seems to affirm, That as the damned souls shall from Hell, see the Saints Happiness to increase their own torments; so shall the Blessed from Heaven, behold the wickeds misery, to the increase of their own Joy. And as they looked on the dead bodies of Christs two Witnesses slain in their streets, and they that dwell on the Earth rejoyced over them and made merry; and as the wicked here behold the calamities of Gods people with gladness, so shall the Saints look down upon them in the burning lake, and in the sense of their own happiness, and in the approbation of Gods just proceedings,<note place="margin">Rev. 11.9.10.</note> they shall rejoyce and sing. <hi>Thou art righ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teous, O Lord, which art, and wast, and shalt be, because thou hast thus judged: For they have shed the blood of Saints and Prophets, and thou hast given them blood to drink for they are worthy. Alle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>luja, Salvation,</hi>

And why cannot you do, and live as the World about you? Even because they are full loath to speed as those others, or to be damned with the VVorld about them. Sincere singularity in Holiness, is by this time known to be
<pb n="83" facs="tcp:61132:61"/>
neither Hypocrisie nor Folly. If to be singular in that Glory be so desirable, surely to be singular in godly living is not contempt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ible. As every one of them now knows his own sore, and his own grief, so shall every one then feel his own Joy: and if they can now call Christ their own,<note place="margin">2 Chro. 6.29. Psal. 67.6. &amp; 33.12. &amp; 78.71. &amp; 16.5.</note> and call God their own God, how much more then upon their full possession of him? For as he takes his people for his inheritance; so will he himself be the inheritance of his people of ever.</p>

                        <p>A Fourth comfortable adjunct of this Rest is, that it is in the fellowship of the Blessed Saints and Angels of God.<note n="4" place="margin">It is a Rest with Angels and perfect Saints.</note> Not so singular will the Christian be, as to be solitary. Though it be pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per to the Saints only, yet is it common to all the Saints. For what is it, but an Association of Blessed spirits in God? A cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poration of perfected Saints whereof Christ is the head? the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>munion of Saints compleated? Nor doth this make those joyes to be therefore mediate, derived by creatures to us, as here: For all the lines may be drawn from the center, and not from each other, and yet their collocation make them more comely, then one alone could be. Though the strings receive not their sound and sweet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nes from each other, yet their concurrence causeth that harmony, which could not be by one alone. For those that have prayed, and fasted, and wept, and watcht, and waited together; now to joy and enjoy and praise together: methinks should much advance their pleasure. Whatsoever it will be upon the great change that will be wrought in our natures perfected; sure I am according to the present temperature of the most sanctified humane affections, it would affect exceedingly: And he who mentioneth the qualifica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions of our happiness of purpose that our joy may be full, and maketh so oft mention of our consociation and conjunction in his praises, sure doth hereby intimate to us that this will be some ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vantage to our joyes. Certain I am of this, Fellow-Christians; that as we have been together in the labour, duty, danger and distress; so shall we be in the great recompence and deliverance; and as we have been scorned and despised, so shall we be crowned and honored together, and we who have gone through the day
<pb n="84" facs="tcp:61132:62"/>
of sadness, shall enjoy together that day of Gladness: and those who have been with us in persecution and prison, shall be with us also in that palace of consolation.

Oh the Blessed day, Dear friends, when we that were wont to enquire together, and hear of heaven, and talk of heaven together, shall then live in Heaven together; When we who are wont to complain to one another, and open our doubts to one another, and our feares whether ever we should come there or no; shall then rejoyce with one another, and tri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>umph over those doubts and feares! when we who were wont formerly in private to meet together for mutual edification, shall now most publikely be conioyned in the same consolation! Those same disciples who were wont to meet in a private house for fear of the <hi>Jews</hi>; are now met in the Celestial habitations without fear: and as their fear then did cause them to shut the door against their enemies, so will Gods Justice shut it now. Oh when I look in the faces of the pretious people of God, and believingly think of this day, what a refreshing thought is it? shall we not there re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>member, think you, the pikes which we passed together here? our fellowship in duty and in sufferings? how oft our groanes made as it were one sound, our conjunct teares but one stream, and our conjunct desires but one prayer? and now all our prayses shall make up one melody; and all our Churches one Church; and all our selves but one body: for we shall be one in Christ, even as he and the father are one. Its true, we must be very carefull in this case, that in our thoughts we look not for that in the Saints which is alone in Christ, and that we give them not his own prerogative; nor expect too great a part of our comfort in the fruition of them: we are prone enough to this kinde of Idolatry. But yet he who Commands us so to love them now, will give us leave in the same subordination to himself to love them then, when himself hath made them much more lovely. And if we may love them, we shall surely reioyce in them; for love and enjoyment cannot stand with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out an answerable Joy. If the forethoughts of sitting down with <hi>Abraham, Isaac, Jacob,</hi> and all the Prophets in the Kingdom of God, may be our lawful Joy; then how much more that real
<pb n="85" facs="tcp:61132:62"/>
fight, and actual possession? It cannot chuse but be comfortable to me to think of that day, when I shall joyn with <hi>Moses</hi> in his song, with <hi>David</hi> in his Psalms of praise; and with all the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deemed in the song of the Lamb for ever: When we shall see <hi>He<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>noch</hi> walking with God; <hi>Noah</hi> enjoying the end of his singularity; <hi>Joseph</hi> of his Integrity; <hi>Job</hi> of his patience, <hi>Hezekiah</hi> of his up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rightness; and all the Saints the end of their faith. Will it be no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing conducible to the compleating of our comforts, to live e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ternally with <hi>Peter, Paul, Austin, Chrysostom, Jerome, Wickliffe, Luther, Zuinglius, Calvin, Beza, Bullinger, Zanchius, Pareus, Pisca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tor?</hi> with <hi>Hooper, Bradford, Latimer, Glover, Saunders, Philpot?</hi> with <hi>Reignolds, Whitaker, Cartwright, Brightman, Bayne, Brad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>shaw, Bolton, Ball, Hildersham, Pemble, Twisse, Ames, Preston, Sibbes? O faelicem diem</hi> (said old <hi>Grynoeus,</hi>) <hi>quum ad illud ani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>morum concilium proficiscar, &amp; ex hac turba &amp; Colluione disce<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dam</hi>! O happy day when I shall depart out of this crown and sink, and go to that same counsell of soules! I know that Christ is all in all: and that it is the presence of God that maketh Heaven to be Heaven. But yet it much sweeteneth the thoughts of that place to me, to remember that there are such a multitude of my most dear and pretious friends in Christ; with whom I took sweet counsell, and with whom I went up to the house of God; <hi>who walked with me in the fear of God, and in integrity of their hearts:</hi> in the face of whose conversations, there was written the name of Christ; whose sweet and sensible mention of his Excellencies, hath made my heart to burn within me: To think of such a friend died at such a time, and such a one at another time, such a pretious Christian slain at such a fight, and such a one at such a fight (oh what a number of them could I name) and that all these are entered<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> into rest; and we shall surely go to them, but they shall not return to us. Its a Question with some, Whether we shall know each other in Heaven or no? Surely there shall no knowledg cease which now we have, but only that which implyeth our imperfection: And what imper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fection can this imply? Nay our present knowledg shall be increa<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>sed beyond belief: It shall indeed be done away, but as the light of the candle and stares is done away by the rising of the Sun; which is more properly a doing away of our ignorance then of our know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge. Indeed we shall not know each other after the flesh;<note place="margin">2 Cor. 5.16.</note> not by stature, voice, colour, complexion, visage, or outward shape; if we
<pb n="86" facs="tcp:61132:63"/>
had so known Christ we should know him no more: not by parts and gifts of learning, nor titles of honour and worldly dignity; nor by tearmes of affinity and consanguinity, nor benefits, nor such Relations; not by youth, or age; nor, I think, by sex. But by the Image of Christ, and spiritual relation, and former faithful<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness in improving our Talents, beyond doubt, we shall know and be known. Nor is it only our old acquaintance: but all the Saints of all ages, whose faces in the flesh we never saw, whom we shall there both know and comfortably enjoy. <hi>Luther</hi> in his last sickness being asked his Judgment whether we shall know one another in Heaven, answered thus: <hi>Quod accidit Adam? nunquam ille vider at Evam &amp;c. i. e.</hi> How was it with <hi>Adam?</hi> He had never seen <hi>Eve</hi>: yet he asketh not who she was? or whence she came, but saith, She is flesh of my flesh, and bone of my bone. And how knew he that? Why, being full of the Holy Ghost, and indued with the true knowledge of God, he so pronounced. After the same sort shall we be renewed by Christ in another life, and shall know our pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rents, wives,<note place="margin">
                              <hi>Melchi. Adam in vita Luthe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ri.</hi>

We have every one now our owne Angels, there beholding our Fathers face: And those who now are willingly ministring Spirits for our good, will wil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lingly then be our companions in joy for the perfecting of our good:<note place="margin">Act. 12.15. Matt. 18.10. Luke 16.22. Luke 15.10. Heb. 1.7. &amp;c.</note> And they who had such joy in heaven for our conver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sion, will gladly reioyce with us in our glorification. I think Christi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>an, this will be a more honourable assembly then you ever here be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>held: and a more happy society then you were ever of before. Surely <hi>Brooke,</hi> and <hi>Pim,</hi> and <hi>Hambden,</hi> and <hi>White, &amp;c.</hi> are now members of a more knowing, unerring, well ordered, right-aym<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, self-denying, unanimous, honourable, Triumphant Senate, then this from whence they were taken is, or ever Parliament will be. It is better be doore-keeper to that Assembly, whether <hi>Twisse,</hi> &amp;c. are translated, then to have continued here the Moderator of this.<note place="margin">Psal. 119.63.</note> That is the true <hi>Parliamentum Beatum,</hi> the Blessed Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liament, and that is the only Church that cannot erre. Then we shall truly say as <hi>David,</hi> I am a companion of all them that fear thee: when we are come to Mount <hi>Sion,</hi> and to the City of the living God, the Heavenly <hi>Jerusalem,</hi> and to an innumerable company of Angels;<note place="margin">Heb. 12.22, 23, 24.</note> to the General Assembly and Church of the
<pb n="87" facs="tcp:61132:63"/>
first-born, which are written in Heaven, and to God the Judg of all, and to the Spirits of Just men made perfect, and to <hi>Jesus</hi> the Mediator of the new Covenant, and to the blood of Sprinkling; We are come thither already in respect of title, and of earnest and first-fruits; but we shall then come into the full possession. O Beloved, if it be a happiness to live with the Saints in their imper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fection, when they have sin to imbitter, as well as holiness to sweeten their society; what will it be to live with them in their perfection, where Saints are wholly and onely Saints? If it be a delight to hear them pray or preach; what will it be to hear them praise? If we thought our selves in the Suburbs of Heaven, when we heard them set forth the Beauty of our Lord, and speak of the excellencies of the Kingdom; what a day will it be, when we shall joyn with them in praises to our Lord, in, and for that Kingdom. Now we have corruption, and they have corruption; and we are apter to set awork each others corruption, then our Graces; and so loose the benefit of their company while we do enjoy it, because we know not how to make use of a Saint: But then it will not be so. Now we spend many an hour which might be profitable, in a dull silent looking on each other, or else in vain and common conference: But then it will not be. Now the best do know but in part, and therefore can instruct and help us but in part: But then we shall with them make up one perfect man. So then I conclude, This is one singular excellency of the Rest of Heaven, <hi>That we are fellow citizens with the Saints, and of the houshold of God,</hi> Eph. 2.19.</p>

Nor doth this con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tradict the former, as I have before made plain. Whether Christ (who is God as well as man) shall be the Conveyor of all from the Divine Nature to us? And whether the giving up the King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom to the Father, do imply the ceasing of the Mediators Office? And consequently, the laying aside of the humane Nature? (though I believe the Negative in these last, yet) are Questions which I will not now attempt to handle. But this is sure; we shall
<pb n="88" facs="tcp:61132:64"/>
God face to face; and stand continually in his presence; and consequently derive our life and comfort immediately from him. Whether God will make use of any Creatures for our service then? or if any, of what Creatures? and what use? is more then I yet know. It seems by that <hi>Rom.</hi> 8.21. that the Creature shall have a day of Deliverance, and that into the glorious Liberty of the sons of God: But whether this before, or at the great and full Deliverance? or whether to endure to Eternity? or to what particular imployment they shall be continued? are Questions yet too hard for me. When God speaks them plainer, and mine understanding is made clearer, then I may know these. But its certain that, at least, our most and great Joyes will be immediate, if not all. Now we have nothing at all immediately; but at the second, or third, or fourth, or fifth hand; or how many, who knows? From the Earth, from Man, from Sun and Moon, from the influence of the Planets, from the Ministration of Angels, and from the Spirit, and Christ; and doubtless the farther the Stream runs from the Fountain, the more impure it is. It gathers some defilement from every unclean Channel it passeth through<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> Though it savors not in the hand of Angels, of the imperfection of sinners, yet it doth of the imperfection of Creatures; and as it comes from man, it savors of both. How quick and piercing is the Word in it self? Yet many times it never enters, being man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>aged by a feeble Arm. O what weight and worth is there in every passage of the Blessed Gospel? Enough, one would think, to enter and force the dullest Soul, and wholly possess its thoughts and affections; and yet how oft doth it fall as water upon a stone? And how easily can our hearers sleep out a Sermon time <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                              <desc>•</desc>
                           </gap> and much, because these words of Life do die in the delivery, and the Fruit of our Conception is almost Still-born. Our peoples Spirits remain congealed, while we who are entrusted<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> with the Word that should melt them, do suffer it to freez between our Lips. We speak indeed of Soul-concerning Truths, and set before them Life and Death; But it is with such Self-seeking affectation, and in such a lazy, formal, customary strain, (like the pace the <hi>Spaniard</hi> rides) that the people little think we are in good sadness, or that our Hearts do mean as our Tongues do speak. I have heard of some Tongues that can lick a co<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                              <desc>•</desc>
                           </gap>l of fire till it be cold. I fear these Tongues are in most of our Mouths, and that the Breath
<pb n="89" facs="tcp:61132:64"/>
that is given us to blow up this fire, till it flame in our Peoples Souls, is rather used to blow it out. Such Preaching is it that hath brought the most to hear Sermons, as they say their Creed and <hi>Pater Nosters,</hi> even as a few good words of course. How many a cold and mean Sermon, that yet contains most precious Truths? The things of God which we handle are Divine; but our maner of handling too Humane: And there's little or none that ever we touch, but we leave the print of our fingers behinde us; but if God should speak this Word himself, it would be a piercing, melt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing Word indeed. How full of comfort are the Gospel Promises? yet do we oft so heartlesly declare them, that the broken, bleed<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing-hearted Saints, are much deprived of their Joyes. Christ is indeed a precious Pearl, but oft held forth in Leprous hands: And thus do we disgrace the Riches of the Gospel, when it is the Work of our Calling to make it honorable in the eyes of men; and we dim the glory of that Jewel, by our dull and low expres<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sions, and dunghil conversations, whose lustre we do pretend to discover; while the hearers judg of it by our expressions, and not its proper, genuine worth. The truth is, the best of men do appre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hend but little of what God in his Word expresseth, and what they do apprehend, they are unable to utter. Humane language is not so copious as the hearts conceivings are; and what we possi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bly might declare, yet through our own unbelief, stupidity, lazi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness, and other corruptions, we usually fail in; and what we do declare, yet the darkness of our peoples understandings, and the sad senslesness of their hearts, doth usually shut out, and make voyd. So that as all the Works of God are perfect in their sea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son, as he is perfect; so are all the works of man as himself, im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perfect: And those which God performeth by the hand of man, will too much savor of the instrument. If an Angel from Heaven should preach the Gospel, yet could he not deliver it according to its glory; muchless we who never saw what they have seen, and keep this Treasure in Earthen Vessels. The comforts that flow through Sermons, through Sacraments, through Reading, and Company, and Conference, and Creatures, are but half comforts; and the Life that comes by these, is but a half life, in comparison of those which the Almighty shall speak with his own mouth, and reach forth to us with his own hand. The Christian knows by ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perience now, that his most immediate Joyes are his sweetest
<pb n="90" facs="tcp:61132:65"/>
Joyes; which have least of man, and are most directly from the Spirit. Thats one reason, as I conceive, why Christians who are much in secret prayer, and in meditation and contemplation (ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther then they who are more in hearing, reading and conference) are men of greatest life and joy; because they are nearer the Well-head, and have all more immediately from God himself. And that I conceive the reason also, Why we are more undisposed to those secret duties, and can easilier bring our hearts to hear, and read, and confer, then to secret Prayer, Self-examination, and Meditation; because in the former is more of man, and in these we approach the Lord alone, and our Natures draw back from the most spiritual and fruitful Duties. Not that we should therefore cast off the other, and neglect any Ordinance of God: To live above them while we use them, is the way of a Christian: But so to live above Ordinances, as to live without them, is to live with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out the compass of the Gospel Lines, and so without the Govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of Christ. Let such beware least while they would be higher then Christians, they prove in the end lower then men. We are not yet come to the time and state where we shall have all from Gods immediate hand. As God hath made all Creatures, and instituted all Ordinances for us; so will he continue our need of all. We must yet be contented with Love-tokens from him, till we come to receive our All in him. We must be thankful if <hi>Joseph</hi> sustain our lives, by relieving us in our Famine with his Provisions, till we come to see his own face. There's joy in these remote re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceivings; but the fulness is in his own presence. O Christians, you will then know the difference, betwixt the Creature and Creator, and the content that each of them affords. We shall then have Light without a Candle; and a perpetual day without the Sun: <hi>For the City hath no need of the Sun, neither of the Moon to shine in it; for the glory of God doth lighten it, and the Lamb is the light thereof, Revel.</hi> 21.23. Nay, <hi>There shall be no night there, and they need no candle, nor light of the Sun; for the Lord God giveth them light, and they shall reign for ever and ever, Revel.</hi> 22.5. We shall then have rest without sleep, and be kept from cold without our cloath<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, and need no Fig-leaves to hide our shame: For God will be our Rest, and Christ our cloathing, and shame and sin will cease together. We shall then have health without Physick, and strength without the use of food; for the Lord God will be our strength,
<pb n="91" facs="tcp:61132:65"/>
and the light of his countenance will be health to our souls, and marrow to our bones. We shall then (and never till then) have enlightened understandings without Scriptures, and be governed without a written Law: For the Lord will perfect his Law in our hearts, and we shall be all perfectly taught of God; his own will shall be our Law, and his own face shall be our light for ever. Then shall we have joy, which we drew not from the promises, nor was fetcht us home by Faith or Hope: Beholding and posses<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sing, will exclude the most of these. We shall then have Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>munion without Sacraments, when Christ shall drink with us of the fruit of the Vine new, that is, Refresh us with the comfort<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing Wine of immediate fruition, in the Kingdom of his Father. To have necessities, but no supply, is the case of them in Hell; to have necessity supplied by the means of Creatures, is the case of us on Earth; to have necessity supplied immediately from God, is the case of the Saints in Heaven; to have no necessity at all, is the prerogative of God himself. The more of God is seen and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived with, and by the means, and Creature here, the neerer is our state like that in glory. In a word, We have now our Mercies, as <hi>Benjamin</hi> had <hi>Josephs</hi> cup;<note place="margin">Gen. 44.12.</note> we finde them at a distance from God, and scarcely know from whence they come, and understand not the good will intended in them, but are oft ready to fear they come in wrath, and think they will but work our ruine. But when we shall feed at <hi>Josephs</hi> own house, yea, receive our portion from his own hand; when he shall fully unbowel his love unto us, and take us to dwell in <hi>Goshen</hi> by him; when we shall live in our Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers house and presence, and God shall be All, and in All; then are we indeed at home in Rest.</p>

When we have (as <hi>Paul</hi>) sailed slowly many days,<note place="margin">Acts. 27.7, 9.</note> and much time spent, and sailing now grown more dangerous; and when neither Sun nor Stars in many days appear, and no small tempest lieth on us, and all hope that we shall be saved, is almost taken away, do you think the Haven of Rest is not then seasonable? When we have passed a long and tedious Journey, and that through no small dangers; is not Home then seasonable? When we have had a long and perilous War, and have lived in the midst of furious Ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mies, and have been forced to stand on a perpetual watch, and received from them many a wound; would not a Peace with Victory be now seasonable?

Surely, a man would think who looks upon the face of the World, that Rest should to all men seem seasonable. Some of us are languishing under continual weakness, and groaning under most grievous pains, crying in the morning, Would God it were evening, and in the evening, Would God it were morning; weary of going,
<pb n="93" facs="tcp:61132:66"/>
weary of sitting, weary of standing, weary of lying, weary of eating, of speaking, of waking, weary of our very friends, weary of our selves: O, how oft hath this been mine own case; and is not Rest yet seasonable? Some are complaining under the pres<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sures of the times; weary of their Taxes, weary of their Quarter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, weary of Plunderings, weary of their fears and dangers, weary of their poverty and wants; and is not Rest yet season<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able? Whither can you go, or into what company can you come, where the voyce of complaining doth not shew, that men live in a continual weariness? but especially the Saints, who are most weary of that which the world cannot feel. What godly society almost can you fall into, but you shall hear by their moans that somewhat aileth them? some weary of a blinde minde, doubting concerning the way they walk in, unsetled in almost all their thoughts; some weary of a hard heart, some of a proud, some of a passionate, and some of all these, and much more some weary of their daly doubt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings, and feares concerning their spiritual estate; and some of the want of spiritual Joyes, and some of the sense of Gods wrath and is not Rest now seasonable? when a poor Christian hath desired, and prayed, and waited for deliverance many a year, is it not then seasonable? When he is ready almost to give up, and saith, I am a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fraid I shall not reach the end, and that my faith and patience will scarce hold out; is not this a fit season for Rest?

Will not <hi>Canaan</hi> be seasonable after so many years travel, and that through a hazardous and grievous Wilderness? Indeed to the world its never in season: they are already at their own home; and have what they most desire: they are not weary of their present State; the Saints sorrow is their Joy; and the
<pb n="94" facs="tcp:61132:67"/>
Saints weariness is their Rest; Their weary day is coming, where there is no more expectation of Rest: But for the thirsty soul to en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>joy the fountain; and the hungry to be filled with the bread of Life; and the naked to be cloathed from above, for the children to come to their Fathers house, and the dis-joyned members, to be conjoy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned with their Head; me thinks this should be seldom unseason<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able. When the Atheistical world began to insult, and question the Truth of Scripture promises, and ask us, Where is now your God? where is your long lookt for glory? where is the promise of your Lords coming? O, how seasonable then, to convince these unbe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lievers, to silence these scoffers, to comfort the dejected, waiting believer, will the appearing of our Lord be? we are oft grudging now, that we have not a great share of comforts; that our deli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verances are not more speedy and eminent; that the world pros<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pers more then we; that our prayers are not presently answered; not considering, that our portion is kept to a fitter season; that these are not always Winter fruits, but when Summer comes we shall have our Harvest. We grudg that we do not finde a <hi>Canaan</hi> in the VVilderness; or cities of Rest in <hi>Noahs</hi> Ark; and the songs of <hi>Sion</hi> in a strange Land; that we have not a harbor in the main Ocean; or finde not our home in the middle way; and are not crowned in the midst of the fight; &amp; have not our Rest in the heat of the day; and have not our inheritance before we are at age; and have not Heaven, before we leave the Earth; and would not all this be very unreasonable? I confess in regard of the Churches service, the removing of the Saints may sometimes appear to us unseasonable; therefore doth God use it as a Judgment<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore the Church hath ever prayed hard before they would part with them, and greatly laid to heart their loss? Therefore are the great mournings at the Saint departures, and the sad hearts that accompany them to their graves; but this is not especially for the departed, but for themselves and their children, as Christ bid the weeping women; Therefore also it is that the Saints in danger of death, have oft begged for their lives with that Argument; <hi>What profit is there in my blood when, I go down to the Pit?</hi> Psal. 30.9. <hi>Wilt thou shew wonders to the dead? shall the dead arise and praise thee? shall thy loving kindness be declared in the grave? or thy faithfulness in destruction? shall thy wonders be known in the dark? and thy righteousness in the land of forgetfulness?</hi> Psal. 88.10.
<pb n="95" facs="tcp:61132:67"/>
                           <hi>for in death there is no remembrance of thee; in the grave who shall give thee thanks</hi>? Psal. 6.5. And this was it that brought <hi>Paul</hi> to a streight, because he knew it was better for the church that he should remain here; I must confess it is one of my saddest thoughts, to reckon up the useful instruments, when God hath lately called out of his Vineyard, when the Loyterers are many, and the Har<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vest great, and very many Congregations desolate, and the peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple as sheep without shepherds, and yet the laborers called from their work, especially when a door of Liberty and oppor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tunity is open, we cannot but lament so sore a judgment, and think the removal in regard of the Church, unseasonable: I know I speak but your own thoughts; and you are too ready to over-run me in application: I fear you are too sensible of what I speak, and therefore am loath to stir in your sore. I perceive you in the posture of the <hi>Ephesian</hi> Elders, and had rather abate the violence of your passions: our applications are quicker about our sufferings then our sins; and we will quicklier say, This loss is mine, then This fault is mine. But O consider, my dear friends, hath God any need of such a worme as I? cannot he a 1000 wayes supply your wants? you know when your case was worse, and yet he provi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded. Hath he work to do and will he not finde instruments? And though you see not for the present where they should be had; they are never the further off for that. Where was the world before the creation? and where was the promised seed, when <hi>Isaac</hi> lay on the Altar? Where was the Land of Promise, when <hi>Israels</hi> burden was increased? or when all the old stock save only two were con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sumed in the Wilderness? Where was <hi>Davids</hi> Kingdom when he was hunted in the Wilderness? or the Glory of Christs Kingdom when he was in the Grave? or when he first sent his 12. Apostles? How suddenly did the number of Labourers encrease immediately upon the Reformation by <hi>Luther?</hi> and how soon were the rooms of those filled up, whom the rage of the papists had sacrificed in the flames? Have you not lately seen so many difficulties overcome, and so many improbable works accomplished, that might silence unbelief, one would think, for ever? But if all this do not quiet you (for sorrow and discontent are unruly passions) yet at least remember this; suppose the worst you fear should happen, yet shall it be well with all the Saints; your own turnes will shortly come; and we shall all be hous'd with Christ together; where you
<pb n="96" facs="tcp:61132:68"/>
will want your Ministers and friends no more. And for the poor world which is left behind, whose unregenerate state causeth your grief; why consider; shall man pretend to be more merciful then God? Hath not he more interest then we both in the Church and in the world? and more bowels of compassion to commise<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rate their distress? There is a season for Judgment as well as for mercy: and if he will have the most of men to perish for their sin, and to suffer the eternal tormenting flames; must we question his goodness, or manifest our dislike of the severity of his judgments? I confess we cannot but bleed over our desolate congregations; and that it ill beseems us to make light of Gods indignation: but yet we should (as <hi>Aaron</hi> when his sons were slain) hold our peace,<note place="margin">Levit. 10.3. Psal. 39.9.</note> and be silent, because it is the Lords doing: And say as <hi>David, If I</hi> (and his people) <hi>shall finde favor in the eyes of the Lord,</hi>

I say, usually, because I know that a very Saint may have a death in <note n="*" place="margin">
                              <hi>Secundum quid.</hi>

He may dye in Judgment as good <hi>Josiah</hi>: he may die for his sin:<note place="margin">1 Cor. 11.30, 32.</note> For the abuse of the Sacrament many were weak and sickly, and many fallen asleep, even of those who were thus Judged and chastened by God, that they might not be condemned with the world: He may die by the hand of publike Justice; or die in a way of publike scandal: He may die in a weak degree of grace, and consequently have a less degree of glory. He may die in smal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ler improvements of his talents,<note place="margin">Luk. 19.17, 18, 19.</note> and so be Ruler but of few Cities. The best Wheat may be cut down before its ripe; Therefore it is promised to the Righteous as a blessing, that they shall be brought as a shock of Corn into the Barn in season.<note place="margin">Job 5.26.</note> Nay its possible he may die by his own hands; Though some Divines think such Doctrine not fit to be taught, least it encourage the tempted to commit the same sin;<note place="margin">Mr. <hi>Capell Temp.</hi>
                           </note> but God hath left preservatives enough a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainst sin, without our devising more of our own; neither hath he need of our lie in his glory. He hath fixed that principle so deep in Nature, that all should endeavor their own preservation; that I never knew any whose understanding was not crazed or lost,
<pb n="97" facs="tcp:61132:68"/>
much subject to that sin: even most of the Melancholly are more fearful to die then other men. And this terror is preservative enough of that kinde, That such committing of a hainous known Sin, is a sad sign, where there is the free use of Reason: That there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore they make their Salvation more questionable: That they die most woful scandals to the Church: That however, the sin it self should make the godly to abhor it, were there no such danger or scandal attending it, &amp;c. But to exclude from salvation of all those poor creatures, who in Feavers, Phrensies, Madness, Melan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cholly, &amp;c. shall commit this sin, is a way of prevention which Scripture teacheth not, and too uncomfortable to the friends of the deceased. The common argument which they urge, drawn from the necessity of a particular repentance, for every particular known sin; as it is not universally true, so, were it granted, it would ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clude from salvation all men breathing: For there was never any man (save Christ) who died not in some particular sin, either of Commission, or Omission, great or small, which he hath no more time to repent of, then the sinner in Question; But yet, this may well be called, <note n="*" place="margin">

                           </note> untimely death: But in the ordinary course of Gods dealings, you may easily observe, that he purposely maketh his peoples last hour in this life, to be of all other to the flesh most bitter, and in the Spirit most sweet, and that they who feared death through the most of their lives, yet at last are more willing of it then ever; and all to make their Rest more seasonable. Bread and drink are alway good; but at such a time as <hi>Samarias</hi> siege, to have plenty of food in stead of Doves dung, in one nights space; or in such a thirst as <hi>Ishmaels</hi> or <hi>Sampsons,</hi> to have supply of water by miracle in a moment; these are seasonable. So this Rest is al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ways good to the Saints, and usually also is most seasonable Rest.</p>

suitable. Every good agrees not with every nature. To live in a free and open air, under the warming Rayes of the Sun, is ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cellent to man, because suitable: But the flesh which is of an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>other nature, doth rather chuse another element; and that which is to us so excellent, would quickly be to it destructive. The choicest dainties which we feed upon our selves, would be to our Beast, as an unpleasing, so an insufficient sustenance. The Iron which the <hi>Ostrich</hi> well digests, would be but hard food for man: Even among men, contrary appetites delight in contrary objects. You know the Proverb, One mans meat, is another mans poyson. Now here is suitableness and excellency conjoyned. The new na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture of the Saints, doth suit their Spirits to this Rest: And in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed their holiness is nothing else, but a sparke taken from this Element, and by the Spirit of Christ kindled in their hearts, the flame whereof as mindful of its own Divine original, doth ever mount the soul aloft, and tend to the place from whence it comes: It worketh towards its own Center, and makes us Restless, till there we Rest. Gold and earthly Glory, temporal Crowns and Kingdoms could not make a rest for Saints.<note place="margin">1 Pet. 1.18, 23.</note> As they were not Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deemed with so low a price, so neither are they indued with so low a nature. These might be a portion for lower spirits, and fit those whose natures they suit with; but so they cannot a Saint-like nature. As God will have from them a Spiritual VVorship, suitable to his own Spiritual Being; so will he pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vide them a spiritual Rest, suitable to his peoples spiritual nature. As Spirits have not fleshly substances, so neither delight they in fleshly pleasures: These are too gross and vile for them. When carnal persons think of Heaven, their conceivings of it are also carnal; and their notions answerable to their own natures: And were it possible for such to enjoy it, it would sure be their trouble, and not their Rest, because so contrary to their dispositions. A Heaven of good-fellowship, of wine and wantonness, of gluttony and all voluptuousness, would far better please them, as being more agreeing to their natures. But a heaven of the knowledg of God and his Christ; a delightful complacency in that mutual love: an everlasting rejoycing in the fruition of our God; a perpetual singing of his high praises; this is a heaven for a Saint, a spiritual Rest, suitable to a spiritual nature. Then, dear friends, we shall live in our own element. We are now as the fish in some small
<pb n="99" facs="tcp:61132:69"/>
vessel of water, that hath only so much as will keep him alive; but what is that to the full Ocean? we have a little Air let in to us, to afford us breathing; but what is that to the sweet and fresh gales upon Mount <hi>Sion?</hi> we have a beam of the Sun to lighten our darkness, and a warm Ray to keep us from freezing; but then we shall live in its light, and be revived by its heat for ever. O blessed be that hand which fetcht a coal, and kindled a fire in our dead hearts, from that same Altar, where we must offer our Sacrifice everlastingly. To be lockt up in Gold and in Pearl, would be but a wealthy starving; to have our Tables with Plate and ornament richly furnished without meat, is but to be richly famished; to be lifted up with humane applause, is but a very airy felicity; to be advanced to the Soveraignty of all the Earth, would be but to wear a Crown of Thorns; to be filled with the knowledg of Arts and Sciences, would be but to further the conviction of our unhap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>piness: But to have a nature like God, his very Image, holy as he is holy, and to have God himself to be our happiness, how well do these agree? Whether that in 2 <hi>Pet.</hi> 1.4. be meant (as is common<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly understood) of our own inherent renewed nature, figuratively called <hi>Divine,</hi> or rather of <hi>Christs Divine Nature</hi> without us, properly so called; wherof we are also made partakers, I know not: But certainly were not our own in some sort Divine, the enjoy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of the true Divine Nature could not be to us a suitable Rest.</p>

It is suitable also to the desires of the Saints:<note n="2" place="margin">To our Desires.</note> For such as their natures, such be their desires; and such as their desires, such will be their Rest. Indeed, we have now a mixed Nature; and from contrary principles, do arise contrary desires: As they are flesh, they have desires of flesh, and as they are sinful, so they have sinful desires. Perhaps they could be too willing whilest these are stirring, to have delights and riches, and honor, and sin it self. But these are not their prevailing Desires, nor such as in their de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liberate choice they will stand too; therefore is it not they, but sin and flesh. These are not the desires that this Rest is suited to, for they will not accompany them to their Rest. To provide con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tents to satisfie these, were to provide food for them that are dead. <hi>For they that are in Christ,</hi>

Whilest our desires remain corrupted and mis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guided,
<pb n="100" facs="tcp:61132:70"/>
it is a far greater Mercy to deny them, yea, to destroy them, then to satisfie them: But those which are Spiritual, are of his own planting, and he will surely water them, and give the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crease. Is it so great a work to raise them in us; and shall they after all this, vanish and fail? To send the Word and Spirit, Mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cies and Judgments, to raise the sinners desires from the Creature to God, and then to suffer them so raised, all to perish without success; this were to multiply the Creatures misery: And then were the work of Sanctification, a designed preparative to our torment and tantalizing; but no way conducible to our happy Rest. He quickened our hungering and thirst for Righteousness, that he might make us happy in a full satisfaction. Christian, this is a Rest after thine own heart; it containeth all that thy heart can wish; that which thou longest for, prayest for, laborest for, there thou shalt finde it all. Thou hadst rather have God in Christ, then all the world; why there thou shalt have him. O what wouldst thou not give for assurance of his love? why there thou shalt have assurance beyond suspicion; Nay, thy desires cannot now extend to the height of what thou shalt there obtain. Was it not an high favor of God to <hi>Solomon,</hi> to promise to give him whatsoever he would ask? why every Christian hath such a pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mise. Desire what thou canst, and ask what thou wilt as a Christi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>an, and it shall be given thee; not onely to half of the Kingdom, but to the enjoyment both of Kingdom and King. This is a life of desire and prayer; but that is a life of satisfaction and enjoy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment. O therefore, that we were but so wise, as to limit those desires, which we know shall not be satisfied; and those which we know not, whether or no they will be satisfied, and especially those which we know should not be satisfied; and to keep up continually in heat and life, those desires which we are sure shall have full satisfaction. And O that sinners would also consider, That seeing God will not give them a felicity suitable to their sensual desires, it is therefore their wisdom, to endevor for de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sires suitable to the true felicity, and to direct their Ship to the right Harbor, seeing they cannot bring the Harbor to their Ship.</p>

And thus do doubtings and fears accompany darkness, and we are ready to stumble at every thing in our way. But then will all this darkness be dispelled, and our blinde understandings fully open<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, and we shall have no more doubts of our way: VVe shall know which was the right side, and which the wrong; which was the Truth, and which the Error. O what would we give to know cleerly, all the profound Mysteries in the Doctrine of Decree, of Redemption, of Justification, of the nature of Grace, of the Covenants, of the Divine Attributes, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> VVhat would we not give to see all dark Scriptures made plain, to see all seeming con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tradictions reconciled! Why when Glory hath taken the vail from our eyes, all this will be known in a moment; we shall then see clearly into all the controversies about Doctrine or Discipline that now perplex us. The poorest Christian is presently there a more perfect Divine, then any is here. We are now through our Igno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rance, subject to such mutability; that in points not fundamental, we change as the Moon; that it is cast as a just reproach upon us; that we profess our Religion with Reserves, and resolvedly settle upon almost nothing; that we are to day of one opinion, and
<pb n="104" facs="tcp:61132:72"/>
within this week, or moneth, or yeer, of another; and yet alas! we cannot help it: The reproach may fall upon all mankinde, as long as we have need of daily growth: Would they have us be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leeve before we understand? or say, we beleeve when indeed we do not? shall we profess our selves resolved, before we ever throughly studied? or say, we are certain, when we are conscious that we are not? But when once our Ignorance is perfectly heal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, then shall we be setled, resolved men; then shall our reproach be taken from us, and we shall never change our judgment more; then shall we be clear and certain in all, and cease to be Scepticks any more. Our Ignorance now doth lead us into Error, to the grief of our more knowing Brethren, to the disturbing of the Churches quiet, and interrupting her desireable harmonious consent, to the scandalizing of others, and weakning of our selves. How many an humble faithful Soul, is seduced into Error, and little knows it? Loath they are to erre, God knows, and therefore read, and pray, and confer, and yet erre still, and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firmed in it more and more: And in lesser and more difficult points, how should it be otherwise? He that is acquainted amongst men, and knows the quality of Professors in <hi>England,</hi> must needs know, the generality of them are no great Scholars, nor have much read, or studied Controversies, nor are men of profoundest natural parts, nor have the Ministers of <hi>England</hi> much preached Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>troversies to them, but were glad if their hearers were brought to Christ, and got so much knowledg as might help to Salvation, as knowing that to be their great work. And can it be expected, That men voyd of Learning, and strength of parts, unstudied and untaught, should at the first on set know those Truths, which they are almost uncapable of knowing at all? when the greatest Di<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>vines of clearest Judgment, acknowledg so much difficulty, That they could almost finde in their hearts, sometimes to profess them quite beyond their reach? Except we will allow them to lay aside their divine Faith, and take up an humane, and see with other mens eyes, the weight and weakness of Arguments, and not with their own; It cannot be thought, That the most of Christians, no, nor the most Divines, should be free from erring in those difficult points, where we know they have not Head-peeces able to reach. Indeed, if it were the way of the Spirit to teach us miraculously, as the Apostles were taught the knowledg of Tongues, without
<pb n="105" facs="tcp:61132:72"/>
the intervening use of Reason; or if the Spirit infused the acts of Knowledg, as he doth the immediate knowing Power, then he that had most of the Spirit, would not onely know best, but al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>so know most; but we have enough to convince us of the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary to this. But O that happy approaching day, when Error shall vanish away for ever! VVhen our understandings shall be filled with God himself, whose light will leave no darkness in us! His face shall be the Scripture, where we shall read the Truth; and himself instead of Teachers and Councels, to perfect our un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derstandings, and acquaint us with himself, who is the perfect Truth. No more Error, no more Scandal to others, no more Dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quiet to our own spirits, no more mistaking zeal for falshood, because our understandings have no more sin. Many a Godly man hath here in his mistaken zeal, been a means to deceive and pervert his Brethren, and when he sees his own Error, cannot again tell how to undeceive them. But there we shall all conspire in one Truth, as being one in him, who is that Truth.</p>
                        <p>And as we shall rest from all the sin of our understandings,<note n="2" place="margin">From sin of Will, Af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fection, and Conversation.</note> so of our wills, affection and conversation: VVe shall no more retain this rebelling principle, which is still withdrawing us from God, and addicting us to backsliding: Doubtless we shall no more be oppressed with the power of our corruptions, nor vexed with their presence: No Pride, Passion, Sloathfulness, Senselesness shall enter with us; no strangness to God, and the things of God; no coldness of affections, nor imperfection in our love; no uneven walking, nor grieving of the Spirit; no scandalous action, or un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>holy conversation; we shall Rest from all these for ever. Then shall our understandings receive their Light from the face of God, as the full Moon from the open Sun, where there is no Earth to interpose betwixt them; then shall our wills correspond to the Divine VVill, as face answers face in a Glass; and the same his will shall be our Law and Rule, from which we shall never swerve again. Now our corruptions, as the <hi>Anakims,</hi> dismay us; and as the <hi>Canaanites</hi> in <hi>Israel,</hi>

Sometime cruel thoughts of God; sometime under-valuing thoughts of Christ; sometime unbelieving thoughts of Scripture; sometime injurious thoughts of Providence; to be tempted sometime to turn to present things; sometime to play with the baits of sin; some<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>time to venture on the delights of flesh; and sometime to flat Atheism it self? Especially, when we know the treachery of our own hearts, that they are as Tinder, or Gunpowder, ready to take fire, as soon as one of these sparks shall fall upon them. O, how the poor Christian lives in continual disquietness, to feel these mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions? But more, that his heart should be the soyl for this seed, and the too fruitful mother of such an off-spring? And most of all through fear, least they will at last prevail, and these cursed motions should procure his consent. But here is our comfort; as we now stand not by our own strength, and shall not be charged with any of this; so when the day of our deliverance comes, we shall fully Rest from these Temptations: Satan is then bound up; the time of tempting is then done; the time of torment to him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>self, and his conquered captives, those deluded souls, is then come; and the victorious Saints shall have Triumph for Temptation.

Or if he should, yet all the Kingdoms of the world, and the glory of them, will be but a poor despised bait to the soul, which is possessed of the Kingdom of our Lord, and the Glory of it. No, no; here is no more work for Satan now. Hopes he might have of deceiving poor Creatures on Earth, who lived out of sight, and onely heard and read of a Kingdom, which they never beheld, and had onely Faith to live upon, and were in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>compassed with flesh, and drawn aside by sense. But when once they see the Glory they read of, and taste the joyes they heard of and possess that Kingdom which they then believed and hoped for, and have laid aside their fleshly sense: its time then for Satan to have done; its in vain to offer a Temptation more. What? draw them from that glory? draw them from the Arms of <hi>Jesus Christ?</hi> draw them from the sweet praises of God? draw them from the blessed Society of Saints and Angels? draw them from the bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>som of the Fathers Love? and that to a place of Torment among the damned, which their eyes behold? why, what charms, what perswasions can do it? to entice them from an unknown Joy, an unknown God, were somewhat hopeful; but now they have both seen and enjoyed, there is no hope.

If we see beauty, its a bait to lust; if deformity, to loathing and disdain. VVe can scarcely hear a word spoken, but containes to us matter of temptation. How soon do slanderous reports, vain jests, wanton speeches by that passage creep into the Heart?

that which we do not know? and to erre with confidence, because of our Ignorance? and if conceitedness and pride do but strike in, to become a zealous enemy to Truth? and a leading troubler of the Churches peace, under pretences of truth and holiness?

To for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>get our selves, our poor brethren, and the publick good? How hard to devote our power to his Glory, from whom we have re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived it? How prone to make our wills our law? and to cut out all the enjoyments of others, both religious and civil, by the cursed rules and model of our own interest and policy? Are we Inferiors and subject? How prone to grudg at others preheminence? and to take liberty to bring all their actions to the bar of our incom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>petent Judgment? and to censure, and slander them, and mur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mure at their proceedings?

So that what a sad case are we poor Christians in? And especially they that discern them not? for its almost impossible they should escape them? It was not for nothing that our Lord cryes out, What I say to one, I say to all; Watch. We are like the Lepers at <hi>Samaria,</hi> if we go into the City, there's nothing but famine: if we sit still we perish.</p>

the snare of the fouler;<note place="margin">Psal. 124.6, 7.</note> the snare is broken, and we are escaped. Now our Houses<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> our Cloaths, our Sleep, our Food, our Physick, our Father, Mother, Wife, Children, Friends, Goods, Lands, are all so many Temptations; and our selves the greatest snare to our selves. But in Heaven, the danger and trouble is over; there is nothing but what will advance our joy. Now every old compani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, and every loose-fellow is putting up the finger, and beckning us to sin, and we can scarce tell how to say them nay: What, say they, will not you take a cup? will you not do as your neigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bors? must you be so precise? do you think none shall be saved but Puritans? what needs all this strictness, this reading, and pray<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, and preaching? will you make your self the scorn of all men? Come, do as we do; take your cups, and drink away sor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>row. O how many a poor Christian hath been haunted and vexed with these Temptations? and it may be Father, or Mother, or neerest Friends will strike in, and give a poor Christian no rest: And alas, how many to their eternal undoing, have hearkened to their seducements? But this is our comfort, dear Friends, our
Rest will free us from all these. As Satan hath no entrance there, so neither any thing to serve his malice; but all things shall there with us conspire the high praises of our great Deliverer.</p>

But we shall then be as much gazed at for our glory, and they will be shut out of the Church of the Saints, and separated from us, whether they will or no. They now think it strange, that we run not with them to all excess of riot, speaking evil of us, 1 <hi>Pet.</hi> 4.4. they will then think more strange, that they ran not with us, in the despised ways of God, and speak evil of themselves; and more vehemently befool themselves for their carelesness, then ever they did us for our heavenliness. A poor Christian can scarce go along the streets now, but every one is pointing the finger in scorn, but then they would be glad of the Crums of his Happiness. The rich man would scarce have be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieved him, that would have told him, That he should beg for water from the tip of <hi>Lazarus</hi> finger. Here is a great change! We can scarce now pray in our Families, or sing praises to God, but our voyce is a vexation to them. How must it needs torment them then, to see us praising and rejoycing, while they are howl<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing and lamenting? How full were their prisons a while ago, and how bitter their rage? How did they scatter the carkasses in the fields? and delight themselves in the blood of Saints? How glad would they have been, if they could have brought them to ruine, and blotted out their name from off the Earth? How did they prepare, like <hi>Haman,</hi> their Gallows? and if God had not gain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>said it,<note place="margin">Psal. 2.4.</note> the execution would have been answerable. But he that sit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth in Heaven, did laugh them to scorn, the Lord had them in de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rision.

How much more comfortable to see them perfected, then now to see them wounded, weak, sick, and afflicted? To stand by the bed of their languishing as silly comforters, being overwhelmed and silenced with the greatness of their griefs, conscious of our own disability to relieve them, scarce having a word of comfort to refresh them: or if we have, alas, they be but words, which are a poor relief, when their suf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferings are real: Faine we would ease or help them, but cannot: all we can do, is to sorrow with them, which alas, doth rather increase their sorrows.

that mine eyes have seen in four yeers space! In this fight, a dear friend fall down by me; from another, a precious Christian brought home wounded or dead; scarce a moneth, scarce a week without the sight or noise of blood.

O, how hardly can my heart now hold, when I think of such, and such, and such a dear Christian Friend, slain or departed? O, how glad must the same heart needs be, when I see them all alive and glori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fied? But a far greater grief it is to our Spirits, to see the spiritual miseries of our Brethren: To see such a one with whom we took sweet councel, and who zealously joyned with us in Gods wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ship, to be now fallen off to sensuality, turned drunkard, worldling, or a persecutor of the Saints. And these trying times have given us too large occasion for such sorrows: To see our dearest and most intimate friends, to be turned aside from the Truth of Christ, and that either in or neer the Foundation; and to be raging con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fident in the grossest Errors? To see many neer us in the flesh con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinue their neglect of Christ and their souls, and nothing will waken them out of their security?

And though this may seem a small thing, to those that live in continual ease, and abound in all kinde of prosperity; yet me thinks, to the daily afflicted soul, it should make the fore-thoughts of Heaven delightful: And I think we shall meet with few of the Saints, but will say, That this is their own case. O, the dying life that we now live? As full of suffer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings, as of days and hours! We are the Carkasses that all Cala<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mities prey upon: As various as they are, each one will have a snatch at us; and be sure to devour a morsel of our comforts: When we bait our Bulls and Bears, we do but represent our own condition; whose lives are consumed under such assaults, and spent in succession of fresh encounters. All Creatures have an enmity against us, ever since we made the Lord of all our enemy. And though we are reconciled by the blood of the Covenant, and the price is paid for our full deliverance; yet our Redeemer sees it fit, to leave this measure of misery upon us, to make us know for what we are beholden, and to minde us of what we would else forget; to be serviceable to his wise and gracious designes, and advantagious to our full and final Recovery. He hath sent us as Lambs among Wolves; and sure there is little Rest to be expect<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed. As all our Senses are the inlets of sin; so are they become the inlets of our sorrow. Grief creeps in at our eyes, at our ears, and almost every where: It seiseth upon our head, our hearts, our flesh, our Spirits, and what part doth escape it? Fears do devour us, and darken our Delights, as the Frosts do nip the tender Buds: Cares do consume us, and feed upon our Spirits, as the scorching Sun doth wither the delicate Flowers. Or, if any Saint or Stoick have fortified his inwards against these, yet is he naked still with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out;
<pb n="126" facs="tcp:61132:83"/>
and if he be wiser then to create his own sorrows, yet shall he be sure to feel his share: he shall produce them as the meritorious, if not as the efficient cause. What tender pieces are these dusty bodies? what brittle Glasses do we bear about us? and how many thousand dangers are they hurried through? and how hard<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly cured, if once crackt? O the multitudes of slender Veins, of tender Membranes, Nerves, Fibres, Muscles, Arteries, and all sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject to Obstructions, Exesions, Tensions, Contractions, Resoluti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, Ruptures, or one thing or other to cause their Grief! Every one a fit subject for pain, and fit to communicate that pain to the whole. What noble part is there that suffereth its pain or ruine alone? whatever it is to the sound and healthful, methinks to such as my self, this Rest should be acceptable, who in ten or twelve yeers time have scarce had a whole day free from some dolor. O the weary nights and days! O the unserviceable languishing weak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness! O the restless working vapors! O the tedious nauseous me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dicines! besides the daily expectations of worse! and will it not be desireable to Rest from all these? There will then be no crying out, O my Head, O my Stomack, or O my Sides, or O my Bowels: No, no, sin and flesh, and dust and pain, will be all left behinde together. O what would we not give now for a little ease, much more for a perfect cure? how then should we value that perfect freedom? If we have some mixed comforts here, they are scarce enough to sweeten our crosses; or if we have some short and smiling intermissions, it is scarce time enough to breathe us in, and to prepare our tacklings for the next storm. If one wave pass by, another succeeds: And if the night be over, and the day come, yet will it soon be night again. Some mens Feavers are continual, and some intermittent; some have Tertians, and some Quartans; but more or less, all have their fits. O the blessed tranquillity of that Region, where there is nothing but sweet con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinued Peace! No succession of Joy there, because no intermissi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on.

And when Here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sies must of necessity arise, how few of them do appear approved?

And I shall suit my speech unto the quality of the subject. While I was in the Mount, I felt it was good being there, and therefore tarried there the longer; and were there not an extream disproportion between my conceivings, and that Subject, yet much longer had I been. And could my capacity have contained, what was there to be seen,
<pb n="135" facs="tcp:61132:87"/>
I could have been contented to have built me a Tabernacle there: Can a prospect of that happy Land, be tedious? or a discourse of eternity be too long? except it should detain us from actual pos<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>session, and our absence move us to impatiency. But now I am de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>scended from Heaven to Earth, from God to man; and must dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>course of a Worm not six foot long, whose life is but a span, and his yeers as a post that hasteth by; my discourse also shall be but a span, and in a brief touch I will post it over. Having read of such a high and unspeakable Glory, a stranger would wonder for what rare Creature this Mighty Preparation should be, and expect some illustrious Sun should now break forth; but behold onely a shell full of Dust, animated with an invisible rational soul, and that rectified with as unseen a restored power of Grace; and this is the Creature that must possess such Glory. You would think, it must needs be some deserving piece, or one that bringeth a valuable price: But behold, One that hath nothing, and can deserve no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing, and confesseth this; yet cannot of himself confess it nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, yea, that deserveth the contrary misery, and would if he might, proceed in that deserving; but being apprehended by Love, he is brought to him that is All, and hath done, and deserved All, and suffered for all that we deserved; and most affectionate<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly receiving him, and resting on him, he doth, in, and through him, receive All this. But let us see more particularly yet, what these People of God are.</p>
                        <p>[They are a small part of lost mankinde,<note place="margin">

                           </note> whom God hath from Eternity predestinated to this Rest, for the Glory of his Mercy; and given to his Son, to be by him in a special maner Redeemed, and fully recovered from their lost estate, and advanced to this higher Glory; all which, Christ doth in due time accomplish ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cordingly by himself for them, and by his Spirit upon them.] To open all the parts of this half-description to the full, will take up more time and room then is allowed me; therefore briefly thus.</p>
                        <p n="1">1. I meddle onely with [<hi>Mankinde</hi>] not with Angels; nor will I curiously enquire, whether there were any other World of men created and destroyed before this had Being; nor whether there shall be any other, when this is ended. All this is quite above us, and so nothing to us. Nor say I [the sons of <hi>Adam</hi>] onely, because <hi>Adam</hi> himself is one of them.</p>
                        <p n="2">
                           <pb n="136" facs="tcp:61132:88"/>2. And as its no more excellent a creature then Man that must have this possession; so is it that man who once was lost, and had scarcely left himself so much as man. The heirs of this Kingdom were taken,<note place="margin">2 Tim. 2.26.</note> even from the Tree of execution, and rescued by the strong hand of love from the power of the Prince of Darkness, who having taken them in his snares, did lead them captive at his will: They were once within a step of Hell, who must be now advanced as high as Heaven. And though I mention their lost condition before their predestination, yet I hereby intend not to signifie any precedency it hath, either in it self, or in the divine consideration. Though I cannot see yet, how Dr. <hi>Twisses</hi> Argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments against the corrupted mass being the object of predestinati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, can be well Answered upon the common acknowledged grounds; Yet that Question I dare not touch, as being very sus<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>picious that its high Arrogancy in us to dispute of precedency in the Divine Consideration; and that we no more know what we talk of, then this paper knows what I write of: VVhen we con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fess, that all these Acts in God are truly one, and that there is no difference of time with him; Its folly to dispute of priority or posteriority in nature.</p>
                        <p n="3">3. That they are but a small part of this lost Generation, is too apparent in Scripture and experience. Its the little flock to whom its the fathers good pleasure to give the Kingdom. If the sancti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fied are few,<note place="margin">Luke. 12.32.</note> the saved must needs be few. Fewer they are then the world imagines; yet not so few as some drooping Spirits deem, who are doubtful that God will cast off them, who would not reject Him for all the world; and are suspitious that God is unwilling to be their God, when yet they know themselves will<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to be his people.</p>
                        <p n="4">4. It is the design of Gods eternal decree to glorifie his Mercy and Grace to the highest in this their salvation; and therfore needs must it be a great salvation. Every step of mercy to it was great, how much more this end of all those mercies; which stands next to Gods ultimate end, his Glory? God cannot make any low or meane worke to be the great business of an eternal purpose.</p>

And to affirm that the Spirit calls or teacheth men where the word is not, and where the Creature or nature speaks not, is, I think, a groundless fi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction. There is the light of the eye, and the light of the Sun, or some other substitute external light necessary to our seeing any ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject: The Scripture and certain revelations from Heaven (when and where such are) is the sun or external light: the understanding is our eye or internal light: This eye is become blinde, and this internal light in the best is imperfect; but the external light of Scripture is now perfected: Therefore the work of the Spirit now, is, not to perfect Scripture, or to add any thing to its disco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>very, or to be in stead of a Scripture where it is wanting, much less where the Scripture is: But to remove the darkness from our understanding, that we may see clearly what the Scripture speaks clearly: Before the Scripture was perfected, the Spirit did en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lighten the Prophets and penmen of Scripture both wayes: But now I know no teaching of the Spirit, save only by its illumina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting or sanctifying work; teaching men no new lesson, nor the old

without book; but to read with understanding, what Scripture, Nature, Creatures and providences teach. The asserting of any more is proper to the Enthusiasts, if the spirits teachings did with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out Scripture or tradition reveal Christ, surely some of those milli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons of poor blinde <hi>Pagans</hi> would have before this believed, and the Christian faith have been propagated among them: Or if the Spirit did teach them any step toward Christ, upon the receiving whereof, he would teach them more, and so more and more till they resist this teaching (which is the evading doctrine of some) then sure some of those Kingdoms of Infidels would have harken<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed to the spirits teaching, and being taught would have taught others; especially if there be a sufficiency in that grace for the ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taining of its end. Therefore how to apprehend a verity in their doctrine of universal sufficient grace to believe, I know not: Yet will I not affirm that the faith that is absolutely necessary among poor <hi>Indians,</hi> is of the same extent in all its acts and dimensions, with that required among us; no more then that required of the world before Christs coming, was. Upon what tearmes then God will deal with those dark parts of the world, I cannot yet reach to know. The scripture speaks of no other way to life but Christ, and of no way to Christ but faith: But we are not their Judges, they stand or fall to their own master: But sure that great difference betwixt them and us, must arise from Gods own plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sure: For they have not abused Christ and Gospel, which they never heard of:<note place="margin">Object. from Rom. 2 16.

And the Apostle tells us those that have sinned without Law, shall be judged without Law.

Dr. <hi>Ames</hi> seemes to resolve it in the Affirmative, that they are infused again, but with this difference. 1. That faith in our vocation is not proper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly considered as a quality, but in relation to Christ. 2. Nor is Repentance there looked at, as a change of the disposition, but as a change of the purpose and intent of the minde: but in sancti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fication a reall change of qualities and dispositions is looked at. <hi>Answer.</hi> Strange doctrine for an <hi>Anti-Arminian.</hi> However you consider it, sure the habit or disposition is infused, before those Acts are excited: <hi>Act.</hi> 26.18. Or else what need we assert any habits at all? If the spirit excites those holy acts of faith and repen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance in an unholy Soul, without any change of its disposition, at the first, why not ever after as well as then? and so the soul be disposed one way, and act another: and so the Libertines doctrine be true, That it is not we that believe and repent, but the Spirit. Or if these two solitary habits be infused in vocation, why not the rest? And why again in sanctification? Doubtless that internal effectual [<hi>Call</hi>] of the spirit, metaphorically so called, is pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perly a real operation: and that work hath the understanding and will for its object; both being the Subject of faith in which the Habit is planted, and faith now generally acknowledged to be an act of both: And surely an unholy understanding and will cannot believe; nor is faith an act of a dead, but of a living soul: Espe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cially considering that a true spiritual knowledge, is requisite, either as a precedent act, or essential part of true faith.</p>
                        <p>All which doth also warrant, my putting of<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> this Renewing work of the spirit in the first place; and placing Sanctification (in the sense before explained) before justification. The Apostle placeth clearly vocation before justification, <hi>Rom.</hi> 8.30. Which vocation I have shewed, is the same thing in a metaphorical term, with this first Sanctification or Regeneration: Though I know the stream of Interpreters do in explaining that Text, make Sancti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fication to be included in Glorification; when yet they can shew no real difference between it, and effectual vocation before-named.

Certainly if Sanctification precede faith, and faith precede Justification, then Sanctification must needs precede Justification: But if we may call that work of the spirit which infuseth the prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciple of life, or holiness, into the soul, [<hi>Sanctification</hi>;] then sanctification must needs go before faith.<note place="margin">Act. 26.18. explained,</note> For faith in the habit is part of that principle, and faith in the act is a fruit of it: Gods order is clearly set down in <hi>Acts</hi> 26.18.

The common shift is apparently vain, to say, That it works neither Phy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sically, nor Morally, but Hyperphysically; for though it may proceed from a supernatural cause, and the work be such as nature cannot produce, yet the kinde of operation is still either by a proper and real efficiency (which is the meaning of the phrase of <hi>Physical operation</hi>) or else improper and moral; So that their Hy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perphysical working, is no third member, nor overthrows that long received distinction; if it were, yet is not the water the capable instrument of this Hyperphysical operation.

It hath been a great Questi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, and disputed in whole Volumns, which Grace is the first in the Soul; where Faith and Repentance are usually the onely com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>petitors. I have shewed you before, that in regard of the prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciple, the power or habit (whichsoever it be that is infused) they are all at once, being indeed all one; and onely called several Graces, from the diversity of their subject, as residing in the seve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral faculties of the soul; the life and rectitude of which several faculties and affections, are in the same sense several Graces, as the <hi>Germane, French, British</hi> Seas, are several Seas. And for the Acts, it is most apparent, that neither Repentance, nor Faith (in the ordinary strict sense) is first, but Knowledg. There is no act of the Rational Soul about any object preceding Knowledg. Their eva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sion is too gross, who tell us, That Knowledg is no Grace, or but a common act: When a dead Soul is by the Spirit enlivened, its first act is to know: and why should it not exert a sincere act of Knowing, as well as Believing, and the sincerity of Knowledg be requisite as well as of Faith, especially, when Faith in the Gospel-sense, is sometime taken largely, containing many acts, whereof Knowledg is one? in which large sense, indeed Faith is the first Grace. This Conviction implyeth also, the subduing and silencing in some measure of all their carnal Reasonings, which were wont to prevail against the Truth, and a discovery of the fallacies of all their former Argumentations.</p>

As there must be Conviction, so also Sensibility: God works on the Heart, as well as the Head; both were corrupted, and out of order. The principle of new Life doth quicken both. All true Spiritual Knowledg doth pass into Affections. That Religion which is meerly traditional, doth indeed swim loose in the Brain; and the Devotion which is kindled but by Men and Means, is hot in the mouth,<note place="margin">Necessity of sensibility.</note> and cold in the stomack. The Work that had no higher rise, then Education, Example, Custom, Reading, or Hear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, doth never kindly pass down to the Affections. The Under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>standing
<pb n="147" facs="tcp:61132:94"/>
which did receive but meer notions, cannot deliver them to the Affections as Realities. The bare help of Doctrine upon an unrenewed Soul produceth in the Understanding, but a super<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficial apprehension, and half Assent, and therefore can produce in the Heart but small sensibility. As Hypocrites may know many things (yea, as many as the best Christian) but nothing with the clear apprehensions of an experienced man; so may they with as many things, be slightly affected, but they give deep rooting to none. To read and hear of the worth of Meat and Drink, may raise some esteem of them; but not such as the hungry and thirsty feel, (for by feeling they know the worth thereof.) To view in the Map of the Gospel, the precious things of Christ, and his Kingdom, may slightly affect: But to thirst for, and drink of the living waters; and to travel, to live in, to be heir of that King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom, must needs work another kinde of Sensibility. It is Christs own differencing Mark (and I had rather have one from him, then from any) that the good ground gives the good Seed deep root<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing; but some others entertain it but into the surface of the soyl, and cannot afford it depth of Earth. The great things of Sin, of Grace, and Christ, and Eternity, which are of weight one would think to move a Rock, yet shake not the heart of the carnal Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fessor, nor pierce his soul unto the quick. Though he should have them all ready in his Brain, and be a constant Preacher of them to others, yet do they little affect himself: When he is pressing them upon the hearts of others most earnestly, and crying out on the senslesness of his dull hearers; you would little think how in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sensible is his own soul, and the great difference between his tongue and his heart: His study and invention, procureth him zealous and moving expressions; but they cannot procure him answerable affections. It is true, some soft and passionate Natures may have tears at command, when one that is truly gracious hath none; yet is this Christian with dry eyes, more solidly apprehensive and deeply affected, then the other is in the midst of his tears; and the weeping Hypocrite will be drawn to his sin again with a trifle, which the groaning Christian would not be hired to commit, with Crowns and Kingdoms.</p>

Corol. 1. So Papists then confess the damning merit of every sin.</note>1. The evil of sin. The sinner is made to know and feel, that the sin which was his delight, his sport, the support of his credit, and estate, is indeed a more loathsom thing then Toads or Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pents; and a greater evil then Plague or Famine, or any other calamity: It being a breach of the righteous Law of the most high God, dishonorable to him, and destructive to the sinner. Now the sinner reads and hears no more the reproofs of sin, as words of course, as if the Minister wanted something to say, to fill up his Sermon; but when you mention his sin, you stir in his wounds; he feels you speak at his very heart, and yet is contented you should shew him the worst, and set it home, though he bear the smart. He was wont to marvel what made men keep such a stir against sin; what harm it was for a man to take a little for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bidden pleasure: he saw no such hainousness in it, that Christ must needs die for it, and most of the world be eternally tormented in Hell: He thought this was somewhat hard measure, and greater punishment then could possibly be deserved, by a little fleshly liberty, or worldly delight, neglect of Christ, his Word, or Wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ship, yea, by a wanton thought, a vain word, a dull duty, or cold affection. But now the case is altered; God hath opened his eyes to see that unexpressable vileness in sin, which satisfies him of the reason of all this.</p>

The Soul in this great work is convinced and sensible, as of the evil of sin, so of its own misery by reason of sin. They who before read the threats of Gods Law, as men do the old stories of forraign wars, or as they behold the wounds and blood in a picture or piece of <hi>Arras,</hi> which never makes them smart or fear; Why now they finde its their own story, and they perceive they read their own doom, as if they found their names written in the curse, or heard the Law say as <hi>Nathan,</hi> Thou are the man. The wrath of God seemed to him before, but as a storm to a man in the dry house; or as the pains of the sick to the healthful stander<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by; or as the Torments of Hell to a childe, that sees the story of <hi>Dives</hi> and <hi>Lazarus</hi> upon the wall: But now he findes the disease is his own, and feels the pain in his own bowels, and the smart of

the wounds in his own soul. In a word, he findes himself a con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demned man, and that he is dead and damned in point of Law, and that nothing was wanting but meer execution to make him most absolutely and irrecoverably miserable.<note place="margin">Whether this be the work of the Law or Gospel.</note> Whether you will call this a work of the Law or Gospel (as in several senses it is of both, the Law expressing, and the Gospel intimating and implying our for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer condemnation.<note place="margin">Necessity of this sense of sin and misery.</note>) Sure I am it is a work of the Spirit, wrought in some measure in all the regenerate: And though some do judg it an unnecessary bondage, yet it is beyond my conceiving, how he should come to Christ for pardon that first found not himself guilty and condemned; or for life, that never found himself dead. <hi>The whole need not the Physitian,</hi>

So doth the spirit also convince the soul,<note n="3" place="margin">Of the Creatures va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sufficiency.</note> of the creatures vanity and insufficiency.

He ascribeth to it the Divine prerogatives, and alloweth it the highest room in his soul; Or if ever he come to be convinced of misery, he flyeth to it as his Saviour and sup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ply. Indeed God and his Christ have usually the name; and shall be still called both Lord and Saviour: But the reall expecta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion is from the Creature, and the work of God is laid upon it; (how well it will perform that work, the sinner must know hereafter.<note place="margin">☜ Pride is the great sin against the first and great Command<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment.</note>) It is His Pleasure, his profit, and his Honour, that is the natural mans Trinity; and his Carnal self, that is these in unity. Indeed it is that Flesh that is the Principal Idol; the other three are deified in their relation to our selves. It was our first sin, to as<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pire to be as Gods; and its the greatest sin that runs in our blood, and is propagated in our nature from Generation to Generation.

When God should guide us,<note place="margin">Man natural<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly is his own Idol.</note> we guide our selves; when he should be our Soveraign, we rule our selves. The Laws which he gives us, we would correct and finde fault with; and if we had the making of them, we would have made them otherwise: When he should take care of us, (and must, or we perish) we will care for our selves; when we should depend on him in daily receivings, we had rather keep our stock our selves, and have our portion in our own hands; when we should stand to his disposal, we would be at our own; and when we should submit to his provi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence, we usually quarrel at it; as if we knew better what is good, or fit for us, then he; or how to dispose of all things more wisely: If we had the disposal of the events of Wars, and the ordering of the affairs of Churches and States, or the choice of our own outward condition, it would be far otherwise then now it is; and we think we could make a better disposal, order and choice, then God hath made. This is the Language of a carnal heart, though it do not always speak it out. When we should study God<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> we study our selves; when we should minde God, we minde our selves; when we should love God, we love our carnal selves; when we should trust God, we trust our selves; when we should honor God, we honor our selves; and when we should ascribe to God, and admire him, we ascribe to, and admire our selves: And instead of God, we would have all mens eyes and dependance on us, and all mens thanks returned to us, and would gladly be the onely men on Earth, extolled, and admired by all.

                           </note> But down falls this Dagon, when God doth once renew the soul: It is the great busi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness of that great work, to bring the heart back to God himself. He convinceth the sinner. 1. That the Creature or himself, can neither be his God, to make him happy. 2. Nor yet his Christ, to recover him from his misery, and restore him to God, who is his happiness. This God doth, not onely by Preaching, but by Providence also: Because words seem but winde, and will hardly take off the raging senses; therefore doth God make his Rod to speak, and continue speaking, till the sinner hear and hath learned by it this great lesson. This is the reason, why affliction doth so ordinarily concur in the work of Conversion: These real Argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments which speak to the quick, will force a hearing, when the most convincing and powerful words are slighted. When a sinner
<pb n="151" facs="tcp:61132:96"/>
made his credit his God, and God shall cast him into lowest dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>grace; or bring him that idolized his riches, into a condition, wherein they cannot help him; or cause them to take wing and flie away, or the rust to corrupt, and the thief to steal his a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dored god in a night, or an hour; what a help is here to this work of Conviction? When a man that made his pleasure his god, whether ease, or sports, or mirth, or company, or gluttony, or drunkenness, or cloathing, or buildings, or whatsoever a raging eye, a curious ear, a raging appetite, or a lustful heart could desire; and God shall take these from him, or give him their sting and curse with them, and turn them all into Gall and Wormwood; what a help is here to this Conviction? When God shall cast a man into languishing sickness, and inflict wounds and anguish on his heart, and stir up against him, his own Conscience, and then, as it were, take the sinner by the hand, and lead him to credit, to riches, to pleasure, to company, to sports, or whatsoever was dearest to him, and say, Now try if these can help you; can these heal thy wounded conscience? can they now support thy tottering cot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>age? can they keep thy departing soul in thy body? or save thee from mine everlasting wrath? will they prove to thee eternal pleasures? or redeem thy Soul from the eternal flames? cry aloud to them, and see now, whether these will be instead of God, and his Christ unto thee. O how this works now with the sinner! When sense it self acknowledgeth the truth? and even the flesh is convinced of the Creatures vanity? and our very deceiver is un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deceived? Now he despiseth his former Idols, and calleth them all but silly Comforters, Wooden, Earthen, Dirty gods, of a few days old, and quickly perishing: He speaketh as contemptu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ously of them, as <hi>Baruck</hi> of the <hi>Pagan</hi> Idols, or our Martyrs of the Papists god of Bread, which was yesterday in the Oven, and is to morrow on the Dunghil: He chideth himself for his former folly, and pitieth those that have no higher happiness. O poor <hi>Craesus, Caesar, Alexander,</hi> (thinks he) how small? how short was your happiness? Ah poor riches! base honors! woful pleasures! sad mirth! ignorant learning! defiled, dunghil, counterfeit righ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teousness! poor stuff to make a god of! simple things to save souls!

Now the sinner findes himself in another case, then ever he was before aware of; he feels an in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>supportable burden upon him, and sees there is none but Christ can take it off; he perceives that he is under the wrath of God, and that the Law proclaims him a Rebel and Out-law, and none but Christ can make his peace; he is as a man pursued by a Lyon, that must perish if he finde not present sanctuary; he feels the curse doth lie upon him, and upon all he hath for his sake, and

Indeed, should they take up here without Christ, or take such change in stead of Christ, in whole or in part; the reprehension were just, and the danger great. But can Christ be the way, where the Creature is the end? Is he not onely the way to the Father? And must not a right end be intended, before right means?

cometh to God, must believe that God is, and that he is a reward<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er of them that diligently seek him. The belief of the Godhead must needs precede the belief of the Mediatorship; and the taking of the Lord for our God, must in order precede the taking of Christ for our Saviour; though our peace with God do follow this: Therefore <hi>Paul</hi> when he was to deal with the <hi>Athenian</hi> Idolaters, teacheth them the knowledg of the Godhead first, and the Mediator afterwards.

True; and so may he also believe there is a Christ: But he can no more cordially accept of the Lord for his God, then he can accept of Christ for his Saviour.

The truth is, where the work is sincere, there it is intire; and all these parts are truly wrought: And as turning from the Creature to God, and not by Christ, is no true turning; so believing in Christ, while the Creature hath our hearts, is no true believing. And therefore in the work of Self-examination, whoever would finde in himself a through-sincere work, must finde an entire work; even the one of these as well as the other. In the review of which intire work, there is no doubt but his soul may take com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fort. And it is not to be made so light of, as most do, nor put by with a wet finger, That Scripture doth so ordinarily put Repent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance before Faith, and make them joyntly conditions of the Gospel: Which Repentance contains those acts of the Wills aversion, from sin and Creatures, before exprest.

I make Christ himself the Object of this Accepting, it being not any Theological Axiom concerning himself, but himself in person. I call it [an Accepting him for Saviour and Lord.<note place="margin">Justifying Faith is the Accepting Christ both for Saviour and Lord.

Indeed, those that have verbally Covenanted, and not cordially, may yet tread under foot the blood of the Covenant, as an un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>holy thing, wherewith they were sanctified by separation from those without the Church: But the elect cannot be so deceived. Though this perseverance be certain to true believers; yet is it made a condition of their Salvation, yea, of their continued life and fruitfulness, and of the continuance of their Justification, though not of their first Justification it self. But eternally blessed be that hand of Love, which hath drawn the free promise, and subscribed and sealed to that which ascertains us, both of the Grace which is the condition, and the Kingdom on that condition offered.</p>

And though it will be part of the following Application, to put you upon tryal; yet because the Description is now before your eyes, and these e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>videncing works are fresh in your memory, it will not be unsea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sonable, nor unprofitable for you, to take an account of your own

estates, and to view your selves exactly in this glass, before you pass on any further. And I beseech thee, Reader, as thou hast the hope of a Christian, yea, or the reason of a man, to deal throughly, and search carefully, and judg thy self as one that must shortly be judged by the righteous God; and faithfully answer to these few Questions which I shall here propound.</p>
                        <p>I will not enquire whether thou remember the time or the or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der of these workings of the spirit; There may be much uncer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainly and mistake in that; But I desire thee to look into thy Soul, and see whether thou finde such works wrought within thee; and then if thou be sure they are there, the matter is not so great, though thou know not when or how thou camest by them.</p>
                        <p>And first; hast thou been throughly convinced of an universal depravation, through thy whole soul? and an universal wickedness through thy whole life? and how vile a thing this sin is? and that by the tenor of that Covenant which thou hast transgressed, the least sin deserves eternal death? dost thou consent to this Law, that it is true, and righteous? Hast thou perceived thy self sentenced to this death by it? and been convinced of thy natural undone con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dition? Hast thou further seen the utter insufficiency of every Creature, either to be it self thy happiness, or the means of curing this thy misery, and thee happy again in God? Hast thou been convinced, that thy happiness is only in God as the end? And only in Christ as the way to him? (and the end also as he is one with the Father;) and perceived that thou must be brought to God by Christ, or perish eternally? Hast thou seen hereupon an absolute necessity of thy enjoying Christ? And the full sufficiency that is in him, to do for thee whatsoever thy case requireth, by reason of the fulness of his satisfaction, the greatness of his power, and dig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity of his person, and the freeness and indefiniteness of his pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mises? Hast thou discovered the excellency of this pearl, to be worth thy selling all to buy it? Hath all this been joyned with some sensibility? As the convictions of a man that thirsteth, of the worth of drink? and not been only a change in opinion, produced by reading or education, as a bare notion in the understanding? Hath it proceeded to an abhorring that sin? I mean in the bent and pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vailing inclination of thy will, though the flesh do attempt to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>concile thee to it? Have both thy sin and misery been a burden to thy soul? and if thou couldest not weep, yet couldest thou hearti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
<pb n="162" facs="tcp:61132:102"/>
groan under the insupportable weight of both? Hast thou re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nounced all thine own Righteousness? Hast thou turned thy Idols out of thy heart? So that the Creature hath no more the sove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>raignty? but is now a servant to God and to Christ? Dost thou accept of Christ as thy only Saviour? and expect thy Justification, Recovery, and glory from him alone? Dost thou take him also for Lord and King? and are his Laws the most powerful com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manders of thy life and soul? Do they ordinarily prevail against the commands of the flesh, of Satan, of the greatest on earth that shall countermand? and against the greatest interest of thy credit, profit, pleasure or life? So that thy conscience is directly subject to Christ alone? Hath he the highest room in thy heart and af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fections? So that though thou canst not love him as thou wouldest, yet nothing else is loved so much? Hast thou made a hearty <note place="margin">

Is it thy utmost care and watchful endeavor, that thou maist be found faithful in this Covenant? and though thou fall into sin, yet wouldst not renounce thy bargain, nor change thy Lord, nor give up thy self to any other government, for all the world? If this be truly thy case, thou art one of these People of God which my Text speaks of: And as sure as the Promise of God is true, this Blessed Rest remaines for thee.

O that the Lord would now open your eyes, and your hearts, to discern, and be affected with the Glory Revealed! That he would take off your hearts from these dunghil delights, and ravish them with the views of these Everlasting Pleasures! That he would bring you into the state of this Holy and Heavenly People, for whom alone this Rest remaineth! That you would exactly try your selves by the fore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>going Description; That no Soul of you, might be so damnably deluded, as to take your natural or acquired parts, for the Cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>racters of a Saint!

                  <p>
                     <seg rend="decorInit">I</seg>T was far from my thoughts, when I first be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gun it, to have so enlarged this as to be a Part entire: Most of it dropt from my Pen, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sides my first purpose. Had I intended to say so much of the Authority of Scripture, I should have stayed till I had the benefit of a Library, that I might have furnished it bet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter with Humane Testimony, which I here in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sist on as so necessary. Though our History of the first and second Century be lamentably imperfect, yet much for the ends here men<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tioned may be produced. I would not have young Students begin with the large Volumns of later Fathers; but I could wish they would read betime the Writers of the three first Centuries, especially those that argue for the Christian Faith, or mix matters of Fact with their Doctrinals; as <hi>Justin Martyr, Irenaeus, Origen</hi> against <hi>Celsus, Tertullians Apolog. &amp;c.</hi> As Also <hi>Philo, Josephus, Eusebi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>us,</hi> and others for History. Me thinks it is preposterous to see men study so long the meaning of Gods Word, before they know whether it be Gods Word, or not: As the <hi>Italians Melancthon</hi> mentioneth, That would prove Christ was in the Bread, before they believed well that he was in Heaven. It is no questioning the Truth of Scripture, to perswade men to the rightest course, to be assured of its Truth. I confess my self much offended at some mens doctrine, who cry down
<pb facs="tcp:61132:106"/>
Reason and Tradition here, as if they were enemies to God, and his Word; and cry up nothing but Scripture and the Spirit. Just like the Antinomians in the doctrine of Certainty of Salvation; who cry up the Witness of the Spirit, and cry down the trying by Signes and Evidences of Sanctification: As if these were contrary, which are co-ordinate! If I had wanted either Reason, Tradition, or the help of the Spirit, I should never have beleeved the Truth of the Scripture. I confess, for my part, I cannot boast of any such Testi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mony or Light of the Spirit (nor Reason neither) which without Tradition, would have made me beleeve, that the Book of <hi>Canticles</hi> is Canonical, and writ by <hi>Solomon</hi>; and the Book of <hi>Wisdom,</hi> A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pocryphal, and writ by <hi>Philo</hi> (as some think;) or that Saint <hi>Pauls</hi> Epistle to the <hi>Loadiceans</hi> (which is in the end of <hi>Bruno,</hi> and others,) were not Canonical, as well as <hi>Johns</hi> second and third. Some men as soon as they hear talk of Reason and Tradition here, they zealously cry out, It is Socinianism and Popery. Scripture is [Gods written infallible Law:] Reason is [the Eye] by which I must read it<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> The Spirit is [the Physitian to cure the blindness of this Eye,] (and in a common sense, The very Life and Spirits:) The Church is the chief (but not the onely) [House where these Records are kept.] Tradition hath chiefly three Offices: It is to the unlearned where Scripture is, [The Proclaimer of it.] It is to the learned, [the Hand] that delivereth it to them. It is to some that never heard of Scripture, [a Herauld to proclaim] the doctrine which it containeth<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> And why must these needs be set together by the ears? May they not? yea, must they not stand together? and further each other? The name of Antichrist, Socinianism, Arminianism (for the things I renounce my self) hath almost affrighted some men out of their Faith, and others out of their Wits. Is it any derogation from the Law, to say, A man must receive it from the hand that bringeth it? and read it with his eyes? <hi>&amp;c.</hi> A learned, godly Divine is offended with <hi>Canterbury,</hi> for these words, [Reason and ordinary Grace superadded, by the help of Tradition, do sufficiently enlighten the Soul to discern, That Scriptures are the Oracles of God;] and he saith, [Here is the Socinians sound or right Reason before the Illumi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nation of the Spirit; and to please the Arminians ordinary or uni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>versal Grace comes in; and the name of Tradition to please the Popish party: And what all these are like to do, without the special Grace of the Holy Spirit, I leave it to any Protestant to judg.] But
<pb facs="tcp:61132:106"/>
what? will any Christian deny, that there is such a thing as ordinary Grace? or, that Tradition is necessary to deliver us the Scriptures? or, hath every man special Grace who beleeveth Scripture to be Gods Word? Is it not possible for an unregenerate man to beleeve that? What kinde of Preaching would such a man use to Indians, Turks, or Infidels? Are not men sanctified by the Word? and must they be sanctified by a Word which they beleeve not, that so they may beleeve it? Indeed, he that saith we may not onely know but know per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fectly, or know to Salvation without special Grace, is mistaken. But usually a common Grace, and common Knowledg, go before Special. The same godly Divine against these words of Master <hi>Chilling<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>worth</hi> [The Scripture is not to be beleeved finally for it self, but for the matter contained in it: So that if men did beleeve the Doctrine contained in the Scripture, it should no way hinder their Salvation, not to know whether there were any Scripture, or no] saith, [I thought it had been necessary to have received those material Objects or Articles of our Faith, upon the Authority of God, speaking in the Scriptures: I thought it had been Anabaptistical to have expected any Revelation but in the Word of God. <hi>&amp;c.</hi>] I should rather for my part think thus, That the immediate Revelation of Scripture from God, was not to me, but to the first Witnesses and Penmen: The way of Conveyance to us is another thing; and is a Revelation too. The best way is by Scripture, (which without Tradition no man would ever see, or hear of.) Where this is not to be had<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> there meer Tradition may save; and is a Revelation sufficient to Salvation, and not Anabaptistical. (Though Traditional unwritten doctrines to make up the defects of Scripture, I abhor.) And I should ask the Dissenter, first, Whether men were not saved before <hi>Moses</hi> without Scripture? And as Doctor <hi>Usher</hi> well observeth, One reason why they might then be without it, was the facility and certainty of Tra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dition: For <hi>Methuselah</hi> lived many hundred yeers with <hi>Adam,</hi> and <hi>Sem</hi> lived long with <hi>Methuselah</hi>; and <hi>Isaac</hi> lived fiftie yeers with <hi>Sem</hi>: So that three men saw all from the Beginning of the World, till <hi>Isaacs</hi> fiftieth yeer. Secondly, And were not many saved by the Apostles doctrine many yeers before the New Testament was written? And <hi>Jews</hi> before, while the old was almost lost? Thirdly, What if some Ethiopians, Armenians, or Papists, should by meer Tradition beleeve in Christ, (and who dare say, That they may not?) should they not be saved? He that saith, No, contradicteth Christ, who
<pb facs="tcp:61132:107"/>
saith, <hi>That whosoever beleeveth in him, shall not perish,</hi> (which way soover he came by it.) Will you hear <hi>Irenaeus</hi> in this? who lived before Popery was born. <hi>Lib. 3. cap. 4. Quid enim &amp; siquib. de aliqua modica quaestione disceptatio esset? Nonne oporteret in antiquissimas recurrere Ecclesias</hi> (Mark, he saith not <hi>Ad Romanam Ecclesiam, vel ad unam principem</hi>) <hi>in quibus Apostoli conversati sunt, &amp; ab eis de praesenti quaestione sumere quod cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tum &amp; re liquidum est? Quid autem si neque Apostoli quidem Scripturas reliquissent nobis? nonne oportebat ordinem sequi Traditionis, quam tradiderunt iis quibus committebant Ecclesi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>as? Cui Ordinationi assentiunt multae gentes barbarorum eorum qui in Christum credunt, sine charactere vel atramento Scriptam habentes per spiritum in cordibus suis salutem, &amp; veterem Tra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ditionem diligenter custodientes, &amp;c. Hanc fidem, qui sine literis crediderunt, quantum ad Sermonem nostrum barbari sunt; quan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tum autem ad sententiam &amp; consuetudinem &amp; conversationem, propter fidem perquam sapientissimi sunt, &amp; placent Deo, &amp;c. Sic per illam veterem Apostolorum Traditionem ne in concepti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>onem quidem mentis admittunt quodcunque (Haereticorum) portentiloquium est.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>I have been the larger in proving an Immortal Life after this, because I finde none doubt of the Authority of Scripture, but they doubt of the Immortality of the Soul too (among us.) This joyned with the Evident Vanity of all other Religions, is an excellent <hi>medi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>um</hi> to confirm us in the Christian Religion: For if we must be happy or miserable for ever, sure there is some true Religion teaching the way to Happiness. That all other Religions are false, any man that lives out of the dust and smoke of prejudice, may see with one eye. That there is a future Happiness or Misery, is evident to Nature, or else how would all Nations so universally acknowledg it? The Ancient <hi>Barbarians</hi> beleeved the Immortality of the Soul, as of the <hi>Getae Herodotus</hi> witnesseth, <hi>Lib. 4.</hi> And of the <hi>Egyptians, Dio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dorus Siculus, l. 1. Biblioth. numb. 93.</hi> The very Inhabitants of <hi>Guiny, Virginia, Guiana, Peru, Chyna, Mexico, &amp;c.</hi> do beleeve a happiness and misery hereafter. As <hi>Descrip. Reg. Afric. Guineae, cap. 21.44. Acosta, lib. 5. c. 7, 8. Hug. Linscot. part. 1. cap. 25. Jo. Lerius, cap. 16.</hi> Sir <hi>Walter Rawleigh, &amp;c.</hi> witness. What Poet speaks not <hi>De Tartaro, Campis Elisiis, manibus</hi>? And Philo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sophers of best note, except <hi>Galen, Epicurus, Plinius, &amp;c.</hi> As
<pb facs="tcp:61132:107"/>
for <hi>Pythagoras,</hi> and his Master <hi>Pherecides,</hi> the <hi>Druides,</hi> the <hi>Indian Brachmanes, Socrates, Plato, Cicero, Seneca,</hi> they all acknowledg it. <hi>Lege Marsil, Ficinum de Immort. Animae.</hi> Yea, <hi>Aristotle</hi> him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>self as is evident, <hi>De anima, lib. 1. context. 65, 66. Lib. 2. con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>text. 21. Lib. 3. context. 4, 6, 7, 19, 20.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Yet we must not take the same course with all men, to convince them of Scripture Authority. We must first deal with an Atheist, <hi>In habitu Philosophico,</hi> before we plead, or directly prove Scripture Authority; of which, see learned <hi>Ludovicus Crocius, Syntagm. l. 1. p. 126.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>The validity of that Humane Testimony, which here we have most use for, dependeth not on any Authority thereto conferred from God, (as <hi>Romanists</hi> fondly imagine,) but on men as sensible, rational, and of common honesty. The Testimony of the enemies, is more strong then of friends. <hi>Strabo</hi> witnesseth, <hi>Lib. 16. Geogra.</hi> of <hi>Moses,</hi> and the ancient <hi>Israelites,</hi> That they were truly righteous and godly men. So doth <hi>Josephus</hi> testifie of <hi>John Baptist,</hi> and <hi>James</hi>: And <hi>Pliny</hi> of the Primitive Christians, <hi>Lib. 10. Epist. 101.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>But I pass these, as not intending a full handling of this subject. The best that I know already extant on it, is <hi>Grotius</hi> and <hi>Du Plessis</hi>; and I would some able man would do yet more. For my own part, I have had so many rare convincing experiences of the fulfilling of Promises to me, and answering Prayers, by wonders of unusual Providences, That serve mightily to conform me, by seconding my Arguments: And were it fit to speak so much of my own matters, I would produce them for the confirming of others.</p>
                  <p>Were it not to digress, I should here express my admiration, That so many learned men should lean towards <hi>Rome,</hi> meerly upon a con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceit, That there is a flat necessity of some Vltimately Decisive, Ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dicial Expounder of Scripture, and that must needs be their Church. For they think it abominable, that every man should be Judg. At present I would but know of them, <hi>First,</hi> Whether they speak of Fundamental plain places of Scripture? or of more obscure, and of less moment? For the former; First, Where there is such Plainness, there needs a Teacher to the Ignorant, but not a Judg: Among Christians, Fundamentals are no Controversies. Secondly, And if the Judg mistake in Fundamentals, if we obey him, we must renounce our Faith. <hi>Secondly,</hi> If the Pope, or his Councel of Prelates be
<pb facs="tcp:61132:108"/>
Judg; how shall all people in the Kingdoms of the World know, what Exposition they give? Hear their voices they cannot: If by their written Canons<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> who shall expound them to the people? If another Pope or Councel, who shall expound their Exposition? and so in <hi>Infinitum.</hi> I do not see, but God speaks as plainly as the Councel of <hi>Trent</hi>; and as easie to be understood. <hi>Thirdly,</hi> Doth the Pope and Prelates know the meaning of Scripture by rational means? or by Euthusiasm? or by some Superior Judg? If by rational means, why may not as learned Doctors know it as well by the same? If by some other Judg, Who is it? If they beleeve Scripture, or the Sense of it, upon their own Authority, who will regard such self idolizing wretches? <hi>Fourthly,</hi> If there be a means left of God, for a true de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciding all Controversies, and resolving all difficulties in Scripture; then why are not all resolved? and why are we not perfect in know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledg? The plain Truth is, Christ is the onely proper Judg himself, and hath left us his Laws, and Magistrates to see that we obey them, and Ministers to teach us the meaning of them. Every man of these is bound to judg rightly of the Sense of these Laws; every particular man, that he may obey them: And if he mistake, he sin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth, and must answer it to God, and (in some cases) to Magistrates and Overseers. The Magistrate is to judg rightly, when any is punishable; and if he erre, he must answer it to the Supream, and he to God. The Ministers are to judg rightly of the Sense of Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, that they may teach them others, and admonish, and censure accordingly; and if they mistake, they are in Synods to consult for Information, and in cases of difficulty, beyond their own reach, to obey the Decrees of such a lawful Synod: But to expect a final decisive Judgment of all Controversies on Earth, is vain: And that Synods should be too bold in determining, what God hath left doubt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful, and utterly uncertain, is destructive to the Vnitie and Peace of the Church, rather then conducible. And for men to beleeve any of their Conclusions, or obey any of their Canons, when we are sure, That they are contrary to the Word of God; this were to change our Master, and take them for Christ, the Prophet, who are but his Am<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bassadors and Vshers in his School. When we have disputed and contended our selves aweary, and wrangled the Church into flames and ashes; yet that which God hath spoken obscurely, and so left difficult in it self, will remain obscure and difficult still: And that which is difficult, through the weakness and incapacity of the Readers

What difference is there betwixt buying liberty to the prisoner, and buying the prisoner to liberty? betwixt buying life to a condemned malefactor, and buying him to life? Or betwixt purchasing Reconciliation to an enemy, and purchasing an enemy to Reconciliation? But in this last they have found a difference, and tell us, that God never was at enmity with man, but man only at enmity with God, and therefore need not be reconciled: Directly contrary to Scripture, which tels us that God hateth all the workers of iniquity,<note place="margin">Exod. 23.22.

If it be an undeniable maxime, that God and nature do nothing in vaine; then is it as true of God and his Grace. All these means and motions, implie some End to which they tend, or else they cannot be called means, nor are they the motions of Wisdom or Reason. And no lower End then this [Rest] can be imagined. God would never have command<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed his people to repent and beleeve, to fast and pray, to knock and seek, and that continually, to read and study, to conferr and meditate, to strive and labor, to run and fight, and all this to no purpose. Nor would the Spirit of God work them to this, and create in them a supernaturall power, and enable them and excite them to a constant performance; were it not for this end where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to it leads us. Nor could the Saints reasonably attempt such em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ployments, nor yet undergo so heavy sufferings, were it not for this desirable end. But whatsoever the folly of man might do, cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainly Divine Wisdom cannot be guilty of setting awork such fruitless motions. Therefore whereever I read of duty required, whenever I finde the Grace bestowed, I take it as so many pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mises of Rest. The Spirit would never kindle in us such strong desires after Heaven, nor such a love to Jesus Christ, if we should not receive that which we desire and love.

The very King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom of God is within them, <hi>Luke</hi> 17.21. They here (as is be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore said) take it by force. They have a beginning of that know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledg which Christ hath said is eternall life, <hi>John</hi> 17.3. I have fully manifested that before, that the Rest and Glory of the peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple of God, doth consist in their Knowing, Loving, Rejoycing, and Praising; and all these are begun (though but begun) here: therefore doubtless so much as we here know God; so much as we Love, Rejoyce and Praise, so much we have of Heaven on earth, so much we enjoy of the Rest of Souls. And do you think that God will give the Beginning, where he never intends to give the End? Nay God doth give his people oftentimes, such fore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sights and foretasts of this same Rest, that their spirits are even transported with it, and they could heartly wish they might be present there. <hi>Paul</hi> is taken up into the third Heaven, and seeth things that must not be uttered. <hi>The Saints are kept by the power of God through faith unto that salvation, ready to be revealed in the last time, wherein they can greatly Rejoyce even in temptations:</hi> 1 <hi>Pet.</hi> 1.5, 6. And therefore the Apostle also tells us, <hi>That they who now see not Christ, nor ever saw him; yet love him, and Believing do Rejoyce in him, with joy unspeakable and full of Glory: Receiving the end of their faith, the salvation of their souls,</hi> 1 <hi>Pet.</hi> 1.8.9. Observe here. First, How God gives his people this foretasting joy. Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>condly, How this joy is said to be full of Glory, and therefore must needs be a beginning of the Glory. Thirdly, How immediatly upon this there follows, Receiving the end of their Faith, the Sal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vation of the soul. And <hi>Paul</hi> also brings in the Justified, Rejoyc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing in hope of the Glory of God, <hi>Rom.</hi> 5.2. And I doubt not but some poor Christians amongst us, who have little to boast of appearing without, have often these foretasts in their souls. And do you think God will Tantalize his people? Will he give them the first fruits, and not the crop? Doth he shew them Glory to set them a longing, and then d<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

To which end I give them some of the Reasons of my request: entreating the Lord to enable and perswade some of them to the work.</p>
                        <p n="1">1. I desire them to consider, whether any thing yet published, be neer compleat, or such as the weight of the subject requires? Whether much more may not be said, and is <note n="a" place="margin">I mean not an absolute necessity, as if what is said were not con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vincing</note> necessary to be said, then is yet said by any that hath writ on this subject?</p>

And (as I said before) without some Arguments to demonstrate to them the verity of Scripture; how are we furnished for such a work? Or what have we to say but naked affirmation? Yea how can we maintain the credit of Christianity, if we were put to dispute the case with an unbeliever?</p>
                        <p n="3">3.

As if we confessed to them, we have not Arguments to convince you, but you must be convinced by the Spirit without Arguments; as if the Spirit did not deal with us as rationall creatures: and did perswade without Argument, and not by it! As if many wicked men did not believe the truth of Scripture! Yet I confesse ther's great difference, betwixt na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turall and Spirituall beliefe.</p>

                           </note>5. Is not Faith a rational Act of a rational Creature? And so the Understanding proceeds discursively in its production? And is not that the strongest Faith which hath the strongest Reasons to prove the Testimony to be valid upon which it resteth, and the clearest apprehension and use of those Reasons? And the truest Faith which hath the truest Reasons truly apprehended and used? And must not that on the contrary be a weak or false faith which receives the Verity and Validity of the Testimony from weak or false Grounds, though the Testimony of it self be the truest in the world? Our Divines use to say concerning love to Christ, that it is not to be measured by the degree of Fervor, so much as by the Grounds and Motives: so that if a man should love Christ upon the same Reasons as a <hi>Turk</hi> loves <hi>Mahomet,</hi> it were no true love: if he love him upon false grounds, it must needs be a false love; and if upon common grounds, it can be but a common love. And is it not then as clear, that to believe in Jesus Christ upon the grounds that a <hi>Turk</hi> believes in <hi>Mahomet,</hi> or to believe Scripture upon the same reasons that the <hi>Turk</hi> believes the <hi>Alcoran,</hi> is no true Faith? Supposing that both have the like verity of their Reasons.</p>
                        <p n="6">6. Is the generality of Christians able to give any better then some such common reason to prove the verity of Scripture? Nay, are the more exercised, Understanding sort of Christians able by sound Arguments to make it good, if an Enemy, or a Temptation put them to it? Nay, are the ordinary sort of Ministers in <hi>England</hi> able to do this? Let them that have tried, judg.</p>
                        <p n="7">7. Can the Superstructure be firm where the Foundation is Sandy? And can our Affections and Actions be sound and strong, when our belief of Scripture is unsound or infirm? Sure this Faith will have influence into all. For my own part, I take it to be the greatest cause of coldness in Duty, weakness in Graces, boldness in Sinning, and unwillingness to die, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> that our Faith is either unsound or infirm in this point. Few Christians among us for ought I finde, have any better then the Popish implicit faith in this point;<note place="margin">See this more fully in Dr. <hi>Preston</hi> on the <hi>Attributes, pag.</hi> 61, 62, 63, 64.</note> nor any better Arguments then the Papists have to prove Scripture the Word of God. They have received it by Tradition; godly Ministers and Christians tell them so; it is im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pious to doubt of it, and therefore they believe it. And this worm lying at the root, causeth the languishing and decay of the whole:
<pb n="177" facs="tcp:61132:114" rendition="simple:additions"/>
yet is it usually undiscerned,<note place="margin">Yet we ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>knowledg it belongs to the Church; first, To be a Wit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness and Keeper of the Scriptures: secondly, To judg and dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cern betwixt Scriptures which are true and genuine, and which are false and sup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>posititious or Apocryphal: thirdly, To divulge and preach the Scriptures: fourthly, To expound and interpret them.

There may be great weakness and un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>soundness of belief, where yet no doubtings are perceived to stir. Therefore though we could perswade people to believe never so confidently, that Scripture is the very Word of God, and yet teach them no more reason why they should believe this then any other book to be that Word; as it will prove in them no right way of believing, so is it in us no right way of teaching.</p>
                        <p n="8">8. There is many a one who feels his faith shake here, who ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver discovers it; To doubt of our Evidences, is taken for no great disgrace, and therefore men more freely profess such doubts; nay, and some perhaps who are not much troubled with them, because they would be thought to be humble Christians. But to question the truth of Scripture is a reproachful Blalphemy, and therefore all that are guilty here speak not their doubts.</p>

                        <p>The Libertines among us think it necessary that we should have such a Toleration to discover the unsound, who hold their faith upon Tradition and Custome.

                        <p>THus much I have purposely spoken, as to stir up Christians to look to their faith, so especialiy to provoke some choise ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vant of Christ, among the multitudes of Books that are written, to bestow their labors on this most needful Subject: and all Ministers to preach it more frequently and clearly to their people. Some think it is Faiths honor to be as credulous as may be, and the weaker are the rational grounds, the stronger is the faith; and therefore we must believe and not dispute. Indeed when its once known to be a Divine Testimony, then the most credulous soul is the best; But when the doubt is, whether it be the Testimony of God or no? a man may easily be over-credulous; Else why are we bid believe not every spirit, but try them whether they be of God or not? And how should the false Christs, and false Prophets be known, who would deceive, were it possible, the very Elect? to be given up of God to believe a lye, is one of the sorest of Gods Judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments.</p>

And I think the direction is very good, so it be used with some distinction and caution. The Rule holds good against reall Blasphemy, known to be such; but if the person know it not, how shall he make use of this Rule against it? Further, it is supposed, that he who knows it to be Blasphemy, hath Arguments whereby to prove it such; else how doth he know it? Therefore here lyes the sin; when a man is by sufficient evidence convinced, (or at least hath Evidence suf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficient for conviction) that it is a Divine Testimony, and yet is still cherishing doubts, or hearkning to temptations which may feed those doubts: when a man (like <hi>Balaam</hi>) will take no answer. But he who will therefore cast away all doubts, before he hath Arguments sufficient against them, or could ever prove the thing in Question, he doth indeed cast aside the temptation, but not overcome it, and may expect it should shortly return again: It is a methodicall cure which prevents a relapse. Such a neglecter of temptations may be in the right, and may as well be in the wrong, but however, it is not right to him, because not rightly believed. Faith alwayes implies a Testimony, and the knowledg usually of

An implicite Faith in God, that is, a believing that all is true which he testifieth, though we see no reason for it from the evidence of the matter, this is necessary to every true Believer: But to believe implicitly, that the Testimony is Divine, or that Scripture is the Word of God, this is not to believe God, but to resolve our faith into some humane Testimony; even to lay our foundation upon the sand where all will fall at the next as<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sault.</p>
                        <p>Its strange to consider, how we all abhor that piece of Popery, as most injurious to God of all the rest, which resolves our faith into the Authority of the Church: And yet that we do for the ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nerality of professors content our selves with the same kinde of faith!

                        <p>If any think that these words tend to the shaking of mens faith, I answer: First, Onely of that which will fall of it self: Secondly, And that it may in time be built again more strongly: Thirdly, Or at least that the sound may be surer setled. <note n="*" place="margin">He that doubts of this, let him see Dr. <hi>Jackson</hi> of <hi>Saving Faith pag.</hi> 146.147.

                        <p>Yet would I not drive into causless doubtings the soul of any true Believer, or make them believe their faith is unsound, because it is not so strong as some others; Therefore I add, some may perhaps

First, If the Arguments which we have for believing the Scripture, be in themselves more suffici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ent to convince of its truth, then any Arguments of the enemies of Scripture, can be to perswade a man of the contrary: And do accordingly discover to us, a high degree at least of probabili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty. Secondly, And if being thus far convinced, it prevailes with us to chuse this as the onely way of life, and to adventure our souls upon this way, denying all other, and adhering (though to the losse of estate and life) to the Truth of Christ thus weakly apprehended. This (I think) God will accept as a true Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liefe.</p>
                        <p>But though such a faith may serve to salvation, yet when the Christian should use it for his consolation, he will finde it much faile him: even as leggs or arms of the weak or lame, which when a man should use them, do faile him according to the degrees of their weakness or lameness: so much doubting as there remaines of the Truth of the word, or so much weakness as there is in our be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieving, or so much darkness or uncertainty as there is in the evi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence which perswades us to believe; so much will be wanting to our Love, Desires, Labors, Adventures, and especially to our joyes.</p>
                        <p>Therefore I think it necessary to speak a little (and but a little) to fortifie the believer against temptations, and to confirme his faith in the certain Truth of that Scripture which containes the promises of his Rest.</p>

The subject matter of Scripture, or the doctrine which it con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tains; 2. And the words or writings con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taining or expressing this doctrine. The one is as the blood, the other as the veins in which it runs. Secondly, We must distinguish betwixt 1. the substantiall and fundamentall part of Scripture<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                              <desc>•</desc>
                           </gap> doctrine, without which there is no salvation, and 2. the circum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stantiall, and less necessary part, as Genealogies, Successions, Chronology, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> Thirdly, Of the substantiall fundamentall part 1. Some may be known and proved even without Scripture, as being written in nature it self; 2. some can be known onely by the assent of Faith to Divine Revelation. Fourthly, Of this last sort, 1. some things are <hi>above Reason</hi> (as it is without Divine Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>velation) both in respect of their Probability, existence and fu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turity: 2. others may be known by meer Reason, without Divine Testimony, in regard of their Possibility and Probability; but not in regard of their existence or futurity.</p>
                        <p>Fifthly, Again matter of Doctrine must be distinguished from matter of fact.</p>
                        <p>Sixthly, Matter of fact is either 1. such as God produceth in an ordinary way: or 2. extrordinary and miraculous. Seventhly, History and Phophesie must be distinguished. Eighthly, We must
<pb n="183" facs="tcp:61132:117" rendition="simple:additions"/>
distinguish also the books and writings themselves: 1. between the maine scope and those parts which express the chief contents, and 2. particular words and phrases, not expressing any sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stantialls. Ninthly, Also its one question 1. whether there be a certain number of books, which are Canonicall, or of Divine Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thority? and 2. another question, what number there is of these? and which particular books they are? Tenthly, The direct expresse sense, must be distinguished from that which is only implyed or consequentiall. Eleventhly, We must distinguish Revelation un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>writen from that which is writen. Twelfthly, and Lastly, We must distinguish that Scripture which was spoke or written by God immediatly, from that which was spoke or writ immediatly by man, and but mediatly by God. And of this last sort 1. Some of the instruments or penmen are known: 2. Some not known. Of those known 1. Some that spoke much in Scripture, were bad men: 3. others were godly. And of these some were 1. More eminent and extraordinary, as Prophets and Apostles, 2. Others were per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sons more inferiour and ordinary.</p>
                        <p>Again, as we must distinguish of Scripture, and Divine Testi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mony, so must we also distinguish the apprehension or Faith by which we do receive it.</p>
                        <p n="1">1. There is a Divine Faith, when we take the Testimony to be Gods own, and so believe the thing testified as upon Gods word. Secondly<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> There is a Human Faith, when we believe it meerly upon the credit of man.</p>
                        <p n="2">2. Faith is either first, implicit, when we believe the thing is true though we understand not what it is, or secondly, explicit, when we believe, and understand what we believe. Both these are again Divine or humane.</p>
                        <p n="3">3. It is one thing to believe as Probable, another thing to be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve it as certain.</p>
                        <p n="4">4. Its one thing to believe it to be true conditionally, another to believe it absolutely.</p>
                        <p n="5">5. We must distinguish betwixt the bare assent of the under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>standing to the truth of an Axiome, when it is only silenced by force of Argument (which will be stronger or weaker as the Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gument seemeth more or lesse demonstrative) and secondly, that deep apprehension and firme assent which proceedeth from a well stablished, confirmed Faith, backed by experience.</p>

But its onely the substance and tenor of the Covenants, and the things necessarily supposed to the knowing and keeping of the Covenant of Grace, which are of absolute ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cessity to the beeing of Faith, and to Salvation. A man may be saved though he should not believe many things, which yet he is bound by God to believe. 3. Yet this must be onely through ignorance of the Divineness of the Testimony: For a flat unbelief of the smallest truth, when we know the Testimony to be of God, will not stand with the beeing of true Faith, nor with Salvation. For Reason layes this ground [That God can speak nothing but Truth] and Faith proceeds upon that supposition. 4. This Doctrine so absolutely necessary hath not been ever from the beginning the same, but hath differed according to the different Covenants and Administrations. That Doctrine which is now so necessary, was not so before the Fall: And that which is so necessary since the coming of Christ, was not so before his coming. Then they might be saved in believing in the Messiah to come of the seed of <hi>David</hi>: but now its of necessity to believe, that this Jesus the Son of <hi>Mary</hi> is He, and that we look not for another. I prove it thus. That which is not revealed can be no object for Faith, much less so necessary: But Christ was not Revealed before the Fall; nor this Jesus Revealed to be He before his coming, there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore

                           </note> primarily and for it self. 6. That it be revealed is also of absolute necessity; but secondarily, and for the Doctrines sake, as a means without which Believing is neither possible nor a duty. And though where there is no Revelation. Faith is not necessary as a duty; yet it may be necessary (I think) as a means, that is, our natural mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sery may be such as can no other way be cured (but this con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerns not us that have heard of Christ) 7. Nature, Creatures, and Providence, are no sufficient Revelation of this tenor of the Covenants. 8. It is necessary not onely that this Doctrine be Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vealed, but also that it be Revealed with Grounds or Arguments rationally sufficient to evince the verity of the Doctrine or the Divineness of the Testimony, that from it we may conclude the former. 9. The Revelation of Truth is to be considered in re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>spect of the first immediate delivery from God, or secondly, in respect of the way of its coming down to us. It is delivered by God immediatly either by writing, (as the two Tables) or by in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>forming Angels (who may be his Messengers) or by inspiring some choise particular men; So that few in the world have received it from God at the first hand. 10. The only ways of Revelation that (for ought I know) are now left, are Scripture and Tradition: For though God hath not tied himself from Revelations by the Spirit, yet he hath ceased them, and perfected his Scripture Revelations; so that the Spirit onely Reveales what is Revealed already in the Word; by illuminating us to understand it. 11. The more im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mediate the Revelation, <hi>caeteris paribus,</hi> the more sure: and the more succession of hands it passeth through, the more uncertain, especially in matter of Doctrine. 12. When we receive from men by Tradition the Doctrine of God as in the Words of God, there is less danger of corruption, then when they deliver us that Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrine in their own words, because here taking liberty to vary the expressions<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> it will represent the Truth more uncertainly and in more various shapes. 13. Therefore hath God been pleased when he ceased immediate Revelation, to leave his Will written in a form of words, which should be his standing Law, and a Rule to
<pb n="186" facs="tcp:61132:119"/>
try all other mens expressions by. 14. In all the forementioned respects therefore the written Word doth excell the unwritten Tradition of the same Doctrine. 15. Yet unwritten Tradition, or any sure way of Revealing this Doctrine, may suffice to save him who thereby is brought to believe. As if there be any among the <hi>Aba<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                                 <desc>•</desc>
                              </gap>sines</hi> of <hi>Ethiopia,</hi> the <hi>Coplies</hi> in <hi>Egypt,</hi> or elsewhere that have the substance of the Covenants delivered them by unwritten Tradition, or by other Writings, if hereby they come to believe, they shall be saved. For so the Promise of the Gospel runs, giving salvation to all that believe, by what means soever they were brought to it. The like may be said of true Believers in those parts of the Church of <hi>Rome,</hi> where the Scripture is wholly hid from the vulgar (if there be any such parts.) 16. Yet where the written Word is wanting, salvation must needs be more difficult and more rare, and Faith more feeble, and mens conversations worse or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dered, because they want that clearer Revelation, that surer Rule of Faith and Life, which might make the way of salvation more easie. 17. When Tradition ariseth no higher, or cometh original<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly but from this written Word, and not from the verbal Testimo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nies of the Apostles before the Word was written, there that Tradition is but the preaching of the Word, and not a distinct way of Revealing. 18. Such is most of the Tradition (for ought I can learn) that is now afoot in the world, for matter of Doctrine, but not for matter of fact. 17. Therefore the Scriptures are not onely necessary to the well-beeing of the Church, and to the strength of Faith, but [ordinarily] to the very beeing of Faith and Churches. 20. Not that the present Possession of Scripture is of absolute necessity to the present beeing of a Church: not that it is so absolute necessary to every mans salvation, that he read or knew this Scripture himself: But that it either be at present, or have been formerly in the Church: that some knowing it, may teach it to others, is of absolute necessity to most persons and Churches, and necessary to the well-beeing of all. 21. Though negative un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>belief of the authority of Scripture may stand with salvation, yet positive and universal (I think) cannot. Or, though Tradition may save where Scripture is not known, yet he that reads or hears the Scripture, and will not believe it to be the Testimony of God, (I think) cannot be saved, because this is now the clearest and surest Revelation: And he that will not believe it, will much<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>less
<pb n="187" facs="tcp:61132:119" rendition="simple:additions"/>
believe a Revelation more uncertain and obscure. 22. Though all Scripture be of Divine Authority, yet he that believeth but some one Book, which containeth the substance of the Doctrine of salvation, may be saved: much more they that have doubted but of some particular Books. 23. They that take the Scripture to be but the Writings of godly honest men, and so to be only a means of making known Christ, having a gradual precedency to the Writings of other godly men; and do believe in Christ upon those strong grounds which are drawn from his Doctrine, Miracles, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> rather then upon the Testimony of the Writing, as being purely infallible and Divine, may yet have a Divine and saving faith. 24. Much more those that believe the whole Writing to be of Divine inspiration where it handleth the substance, but doubt whether God infallibly guided them in every circumstance. 25. And yet more those that believe that the Spirit did guide the Writers to Truth, both in Substance and Circumstance, but doubt whether he guided them in Orthography; or whether their Pens were as perfectly guided as their minds? 26. And yet more may those have saving Faith, who onely doubt whether Providence infallibly guided any Transcribers, or Printers, as to retain any Copy that perfectly agreeth with the Autograph. 27. Yet do all these (in my judgment) cast away a singular prop to their faith, and lay it open to dangerous assaults, and doubt of that which is a certain truth. 28. As the Translations are no further Scripture, then they agree with the Copies in the Original Tongues; so neither are those Copies further then they agree with the Autographs, or Original Copies, or with some Copies perused and approved by the Apostles. 29. Yet is there not the like necessity of having the Autographs to try the Transcripts by, as there is of having the Original Transcripts to try the Translations by. For there is an impossibility that any Translation should perfectly express the sense of the Original: But there is a possibility, probability, and facility of true Transcribing, and grounds to prove it true <hi>de facto,</hi> as we shall touch anon. 30. That part which was written by the Finger of God; as also the substance of Doctrine through the whole Scriptures, are so purely Divine, that they have not in them any thing humane. 31. The next to these are the words that were spoken by the mouth of Christ, and then those that were spoken by Angels, 32. The Circumstantials are many of
<pb n="188" facs="tcp:61132:120"/>
them so Divine, as yet they have in them something Humane, as the bringing of <hi>Pauls</hi> Cloak and Parchments, and (as it seems) his counsel about Marriage, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> 33. Much more is there some<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing Humane in the Method and Phrase, which is not so immedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>atly Divine as the Doctrine. 34. Yet is there nothing sinfully Hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mane, and therefore nothing false in all. 35. But an innocent im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perfection there is in the Method and Phrase, which if we deny, we must renounce most of our Logick and Rhetorick. 36. Yet was this imperfect way (at that time, all things considered) the fittest way to divulge the Gospel: That is the best Language which is best suited to the Hearers, and not that which is best simply in it self, and supposeth that understanding in the Hearers which they have not. Therefore it was Wisdom and Mercy to fit the Scripture to the capacity of all: Yet will it not therefore follow that all Preachers at all times should as much neglect Definition, Distincti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, Syllogisme, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> as Scripture doth. 37. Some Doctrinal pas<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sages in Scripture are onely Historically related, and therefore the relating them is no asserting them for truth; and therefore those sentences may be false, and yet not the Scripture false: yea, some falshoods are written by way of reproving them, as <hi>Gehezies</hi> Lye, <hi>Sauls</hi> Excuse, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> 38. Every Doctrine that is thus related onely Historically, is therefore of doubtful credit, because it is not a Divine assertion (except Christ himself were the Speaker:) and therefore it is to be tried by the rest of the Scripture. 39. Where ordinary men were the Speakers, the credit of such Doctrines is the more doubtful, and yet much more when the Speakers were wicked: of the former sort are the Speeches of <hi>Jobs</hi> friends, and divers others: of the later sort are the Speeches of the Pharisees, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> and perhaps <hi>Gamaliels</hi> counsel, <hi>Act.</hi> 5.34, 40. Yet where God doth testifie his Inspiration, or Approbation, the Doctrine is of Divine Authority, though the Speaker be wicked: As in <hi>Balaams</hi> Prophesie.<note place="margin">
                              <hi>A facto ad jus ad licitum vel debitum non valet Argum.</hi>
                           </note> 41. The like may be said of matter of Fact; for it is not either necessary or lawful to speak such words, or do such actions meerly because men in Scripture did so speak or do, no, not though they were the best Saints; for their own speeches or actions are to be judged by the Law, and therefore are no part of the Law themselves. And as they are evil where they cross the Law (as <hi>Josephs</hi> swearing, the Ancients Polygamy, <hi>&amp;c.</hi>) so are they doubtful where their congruence with the Law is doubtful.
<pb n="189" facs="tcp:61132:120"/>
42. But here is one most observable exception. (conducing much to resolve the great doubt, whether Examples binde?) Where men are designed by God to such an Office, and act by Commissi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, and with a promise of Direction, their Doctrines are of Divine Authority, though we finde not where God did dictate, and their Actions done by that Commission are currant and Exemplary, so far as they are intended or performed for Example, and so Exam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple may be equivalent to a Law, and the Argument, <hi>a facto ad jus,</hi> may hold. So <hi>Moses</hi> being appointed to the forming of the old Church and Commonwealth of the <hi>Jews,</hi> to the building of the Tabernacle, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> his Precepts and Examples in these works, (though we could not finde his particular direction) are to be taken as Divine. So also the Apostles having Commission to Form and Order the Gospel Churches, their Doctrine and Examples therein, are by their general Commission warranted, and their practice in stablishing the Lords Day, in setling the Officers and Orders of Churches, are to us as Laws, (still binding with those limitations as Positives onely, which give way to greater<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>) 43. The ground of this Position is, because it is inconsistent with the Wisdom and Faithfulness of God, to send men to a work, and promise to be with them, and yet to forsake them, and suffer them to err in the building of that House, which must indure till the end of the world. 44. Yet if any of these Commissioners do err in their own particular conversations, or in matters without the ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tent of their Commission,<note place="margin">As <hi>Peter,</hi> Gal. 2.11, 12.13.</note> this may consist with the faithfulness of God; God hath not promised them infallibility and perfection: the disgrace is their own: but if they should miscarry in that wherein they are sent to be a rule to others, the Church would then have an imperfect Rule, and the dishonor would redound to God. 45. Yet I finde not that ever God authorized any meere man to be a Lawgiver to the Church in Substantials, but onely to deliver the Laws which he had given, to Interpret them, and to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>termine Circumstantials not by him determined. 46. Where God owneth mens Doctrines and Examples by Miracles, they are to be taken as infallibly Divine: much more when Commission, Promise, and Miracles do concur, which confirmeth the Apostles Examples for currant. 47. So that if any of the <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                              <desc>•</desc>
                           </gap>ings or Prophets<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> had given Laws, and formed the Church as <hi>Moses,</hi> they had not been binding, because without the said Commission: or if any
<pb n="190" facs="tcp:61132:121"/>
other Minister of the Gospel shall by Word or Action arrogate an Apostolical priviledg. 48. There is no verity about God, or the chief happiness of man written in Nature, but it is to be found written in Scriptures. 49. So that the same thing may in these several respects, be the object both of Knowledg and of Faith. 50. The Scripture being so perfect a Transcript of the law of Nature or Reason, is much more to be credited in its superna<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tural Revelations. 51. The probability of most things, and the possibility of all things contained in the Scriptures, may well be discerned by Reason it self, which makes their Existence or Futu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity the more easie to be believed. 52. Yet before this Existence or Futurity of any thing beyond the reach of Reason can be soundly believed, the Testimony must be known to be truly Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vine. 53. Yet a belief of Scripture Doctrine as probable, doth usually go before a belief of certainty, and is a good preparative thereto. 54. The direct, express sense, must be believed di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rectly and absolutely, as infallible, and the consequences (where they may be clearly and certainly raised:) but where there is danger of erring in raising consequences, the assent can be but weak and conditional. 55. A Consequence raised from Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture being no part of the immediate sense, cannot be called any part of Scripture. 56. Where one of the premises is in Nature, and the other onely in Scripture, there the Conclusion is mixt, partly known, and partly believed. That it is the Consequence of those premises, is known; but that it is a Truth, is, as I said, appre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hended by a mixt Act. Such is, a Christians concluding himself to be justified and sanctified, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> 57. Where through weakness we are unable to discern the Consequences, there is enough in the express direct sense for salvation. 58. Where the sense is not un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stood, there the belief can be but implicit. 59. Where the sense is partly understood, but with some doubting, the Belief can be but conditionally explicit: that is, we believe it, if it be the sense of the Word. 60. Fundamentals must be believed Explicitly and Absolutely.</p>

First, I will therefore shew you that there is such a certainty in some Humane Testimony. Both experience and Reason will confirme this. First, I would desire any rationall man to tell me, Whether he that never was at <hi>London,</hi> at <hi>Paris,</hi> or at <hi>Rome,</hi> may not be certaine by a Humane faith, that there are such Cities? For my own part, I think it as certaine to me, nay more certaine then that which I see: and I should sooner
<pb n="194" facs="tcp:61132:123"/>
question my own sight alone, then the eyes and credit of so many thousands in such a case. And I thinke the Scepticks Arguments against the certainty of sense, to be as strong as any that can be brought against the certainty of such a Testimony. Is it not somewhat more then probable, think you, to the multitudes that never saw either Parliament or King, that yet there is such an Assembly and such a person? May we not be fully certaine that there was such a person as King <hi>James,</hi> as Queen <hi>Elizabeth,</hi> as Queen <hi>Mary,</hi> &amp;c. here in <hi>England</hi>? Yea, that there was such a man as <hi>William</hi> the Conqueror? May we not be certaine also that he conquered <hi>England</hi>? With many other of his actions? The like may be said of <hi>Julius Caesar,</hi> of <hi>Alexander</hi> the Great, &amp;c. Sure those that charge all humane Testimony with uncertain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty, do hold their lands then upon an uncertaine tenure. Second<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, It may be proved also by reason. For if 1. the first testifiers may infallibly know it, and 2. also by an infallible means transmit it to posterity, and 3. have no intent to deceive, then their Testimony may be an infallible Testimony. But all these three may be easily proved (I had thought to have laid down here the Rules by which a certaine Humane Testimony may be discerned from an uncer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taine, but you may easily gather them from what I shall lay down for the confirmation of these three Positions.) For the first, I sup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pose none will question, whether the first testifiers might infalliby know the truth of what they testifie? If they should, let them consider, First, If it be not matter of Doctrine (much lesse ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>struse and difficult points) but only matter of fact, then its be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>yond doubt it may be certainly known. Secondly, If it be those also who did see and hear, and handle, who do testifie it. Thirdly, If their senses were sound and perfect, within reach of the object, and having no deceiving medium. Fourthly, Which may be dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerned 1. If the witnesses be a multitude, for then it may be known they are not blind or deaf, except they had been culled out of some Hospitalls: especially when all present do both see and hear them 2. When the thing is done openly in the day<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>light. 3. When it is done frequently, and neer at hand: for then there would be full opportunity to discover any deceit. So that in these cases it is doubtless, sense is infallible, and conse<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quently those that see and hear are most certaine witnesses.</p>
                        <p n="2">2. Next let us see, whether we may be certaine that any Testi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mony
<pb n="195" facs="tcp:61132:123"/>
is sincere, without a purpose to deceive us. And I take that for undoubted in the following cases. 1. Where the party is of ingenuity and honesty. 2. And it is apparent he drives on no de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>signe of his own, nor cannot expect any advantage in the world. 3. Nay of his Testimony will certainly undo him in the world, and prove the overthrow of his ease<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> honour, estate and life. 5. And if it be a multitude that do thus testifie, How can they do it with an intent to deceive? 6. And if their severall Testimonies do agree. 7. And if the very enemies deny not this matter of fact, but only refer it to other causes; then there is no possibility of deceit (as I shall further anon evince when I apply it to the Question.)</p>
                        <p>Thirdly, VVe are to prove, that there are infallible means of transmitting such Testimony down to posterity, without deprav<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing any thing substantiall. And then it well remaine an undoubt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed truth, that there is a full certainty in some humane Testimony, and that to posterity at a remote distance. Now this tradition is infallible in these cases. 1. If it be (as beforesaid) in matter of fact only, which the meanest understandings are capable of ap<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>prehending. 2. If it be also about the substance of actions, and not every small circumstance. 3. And also if those Actions were famous in their times, and of great note and wonder in the world, and such as were the cause of publike and eminent altera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions. 4. If it be delivered down in writing and not only by word of mouth, where the change of speech might alter the sense of the matter. 5. If the Records be publike, where the very enemies may see them: yea published of purpose by Heralds and Ambassadors, that the world may take notice of them. 6. If they are men of greatest honesty in all Ages, who have both kept and divulged these Records. 7<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> And if there have been also a multitude of these. 8. And this multitude of severall countries, where they could never so much as meet to agree upon any de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiving councells: much lesse all accord in such a design: and lest of all be able to manage it with secrecy. 9. If also the after preservers and divulgers of these records could have no more self-advancing ends, then the first testifiers. 10. Nay if their divulg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing and attesting these records did utterly ruinate in the world, their states and lives, as well as it did the first testifiers. 11. If there be such a dispersing of the copies of these records all over the world, that the cancelling and abolishing them is a thing im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>possible.
<pb n="196" facs="tcp:61132:124"/>
12. If the very histories of the enemies do never af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firme any universall abolishing and consuming of them. 13. If all these dispersed copies through the world, do perfectly agree in every thing materiall. 14. If it were a matter of such moment in the judgement of the preservers, neither to add nor diminish, that they thought their eternall Salvation did lye upon it. 15. If the histories of their enemies do generally mention their attesting these records to the losse of their lives; and that successively in every age. 16. If these records and attestations are yet visible to the world; and that in such a form as none could counterfeit. 17. If the enemies that lived neer or in those times when the things were done, do 1. write nothing against them of any moment, 2. but oppose them with fire and sword in stead of Argument, 3. nay if they acknowledge the fact, but deny the cause <note n="*" place="margin">

And if all the enemies were incompetent witnesses, 1. wit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nessing to the Negative, of which they could have no certain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty, 2. and carryed on with apparent malice and prejudice, 3. and having all worldly advantages attending their cause, 4<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> and being generally men unconscionable and impious. 19. If all these ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mies having all these worldly advantages, could neither by Argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments nor Violence, hinder people from believing these famous and palpable matters of fact, in the very age wherein they were done, when the truth or falshood might most easily be discovered, but that the generality of beholders were forced to assent. 20. If multitudes of the most ingenuous and violent enemies, have in every age from the very acting of these things to this day, been forced to yield, and turned as zealous defenders of these records and their doctrine, as ever they were opposers of them before. 21. If all these Converts do confesse upon their coming in, that it was ignorance, or prejudice, or worldly respects that made them oppose so much before. 22. If all the powers of the world, that can burn the bodies of the witnesses, that can overthrow Kingdoms, and change their Laws, could never yet reverse or abol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ish these Records. 23. Nay if some notable judgement in all ages, have befallen the most eminent opposers thereof. 24. And Lastly, if successions of wonders (though not Miracles as the first,) have in all ages accompanied the attestation of these records. I say, if all these twenty four particulars do concurre, or most of these, I leave it to the judgement of any man of understanding,

Fourthly, This is appa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rent: first, Because they were great multitudes, even that were present, and therefore could not all be blinde, if they had, how did they walk about? Fifthly, These Miracles were not done by night, nor in a corner, but in the open light in the midst of the people. Sixthly, They were not once or twice onely performed, but very oft, of several kindes, by several persons, even Prophets,
<pb n="198" facs="tcp:61132:125"/>
and Christ himself and his Apostles in many Generations; so that if there had been any deceit,<note place="margin">

                        <p>So that it remains certain, That the first Eye witnesses them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves were not deceived.</p>
                        <p n="2">2. Let us next consider, whether it be not also as certain that they never intended the deceiving of the world?</p>
                        <p>First, It is evident that they were neither fools nor knaves, <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 word">
                              <desc>〈◊〉</desc>
                           </gap> but men of ingenuity, and extraordinary Honesty: There needs no more to prove this then their own Writings, so full of enmity against all kinde of vitiousness, so full of conscientious zeal, and heavenly affections: Yet is this their Honesty also attested by their enemies; sure the very remnants of Natural Honesty are a Divine off-spring, and do produce also certain effects according to their strength and nature: God hath planted and continued them in man, for the use of societies, and common converse; for if all Honesty were gone, one man could not believe another, and so could not converse together. But now supernatural extraordinary Honesty will produce its effect more certainly: If three hundred, or three thousand honest godly men should say, they saw such things with their eyes, he is very incredulous that would not be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve it. 2. It is apparent that neither Prophets, Apostles, nor Disciples in Attesting these things could drive on any designs of their own. Did they seek either Honor, or Ease, or Profits, or worldly Delights? Did their Master give them any hopes of these? or did they see any probability of their attaining it? or did they see any of their fellows attain it before them? 3. Nay, was it not a certain way to their ruine in the world? Did not their Master tell them when he sent them out, That they should be persecuted of all for his sake and the Gospels? Did they not finde it true, and therefore expect the like themselves? <hi>Paul</hi> knew that in every City Bonds and Afflictions did abide him: and they lay it down as a granted Rule, <hi>That he that will live godly in Christ Jesus, must suffer persecution.</hi> Now I would fain know, whether a mans Self, his State, his Liberty, his Life, be not na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turally so neer and dear to all, that they would be loath to throw it away, meerly to deceive and cosen the world? All that I know
<pb n="199" facs="tcp:61132:125"/>
can be objected, is, That they might do it out of a desire to be admired in the world for their godliness and their suffering. <hi>Answ.</hi> First, Go see were you can finde thousands, or mil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lions of men that will cast away their lives to be talked of. Second<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, Did they not on the contrary renounce their own Honor and Esteem, and call themselves Vile and Miserable Sinners, and speak worse of themselves then the most impious wretch will do, and ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>toll nothing but God and his Son Jesus? Thirdly, Did not their Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ster foretell them, that they should be so far from getting credit by his Service, that they should be hated of all men, and their names cast out as evil doers? Did they not see him spit upon, and hanged on a Cross among theeves before their eyes, some of them? Did they not finde by experience, that their way was every where spoken against? And the reproach of the Cross of Christ was the great stumbling block to the world? And could men possibly chuse such a way for Vainglory? I am perswaded it is one great reason why Christ would have the first Witnesses of the Gospel to suffer so much, to confirm their Testimony to future Ages, that the world may see that they intended not to deceive them. 5. Consider also what a multitude these Witnesses were: How could so many thou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sand of several Countreys lay the plot to deceive the world? They were not onely thousands that believed the Gospel, but thou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sands that saw the Miracles of Christ, and many Cities and Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tries that saw the Miracles of the Apostles. 6. And the Testimony of all doth so punctually accord, that the seeming contradiction in some smaller circumstances, doth but shew their simplicity, and sincerity, and their agreement in the main.<note n="*" place="margin">

                           </note> 7 And lastly, The very enemies acknowledg this matter of Fact; onely they ascribe it to other causes. They could not deny the Miracles that were wrought: Even to this day the <hi>Jews</hi> acknowledg much of the works of Christ, but slanderously father them upon the power of the Devil, or upon the force of the name of God sewed in Christs thigh, and such like ridiculous Stories they have: even the <hi>Turks</hi> confess much of the miracles of Christ, and believe him to be a great Prophet, though they are profest enemies to the Christian name.</p>
                        <p>So that I think by all this it is certain, That the first Witnesses of the Miracles of Christ and his Apostles, as they were not deceived themselves, so neither had they any intent to deceive the world.</p>

Yea, God made it the office of his Ministers to publish it what<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever came of it to all the world, and pronounced a wo to them if they Preach not this Gospel; which Preaching was both the di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vulging of the Doctrine and Miracles of Christ, and all out of these authentick Records; And how then is it possible, there should be an universal depravation, and that even in the narration of the matters of Fact, when all Nations almost, in all the Ages since the Original of the History, have had these Heralds, who have proclaimed it to the death. 6. And it is most apparent that the Keepers and Publishers of these Records, have been men of most eminent Piety and Honesty.

All the Copies of those sacred Writings do yet accord (in all things material) which are found through the world. And consider then if they had been depraved, whether multitudes of Copies, which had escaped that depravation, would not by their diversity or contradiction have bewrayed the rest? 14. It was a matter of such a hainous quality, both by the sen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tence of the Law, and in the Consciences of the Preservers and Divulgers of it, for to add or diminish the least title, that they
<pb n="202" facs="tcp:61132:127"/>
thought it deserved eternall damnation. And I refer it to any man of reason, whether so many thousands of men through the world, could possibly venture upon eternal torment, as well as upon temporal death, and all this to deceive others by depraving the Laws which they look to be judged by; or the History of those Miracles which were the grounds of their Faith? Is not the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary somewhat more then probable? 15. Furthermore, The Histories of the Enemies do frequently mention that these Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures have been still maintained to the flames.

the Miracles to other causes, or an opposing the Doctrine delivered by the Christians, rather then these miraculous actions in question? I leave those to judg who have read their VVritings. Yea, whether their common Arguments have not been Fire and Sword? 18. It is an easie matter yet to prove, that the enemies of Scripture have been incompetent VVitnesses: First, Being men that were not present, or had not the opportunity to be so well acquainted with the Actions of Christ, of the Prophets and Apostles, as themselves and others that do attest them. Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>condly, Being men of apparent malice, and possessed with much prejudice against the persons and things which they oppose. This I might easily and fully prove if I could stand upon it. Thirdly, They had all worldly advantages attending their Cause, which they were all to lose, with life it self, if they had appeared for Christ. Fourthly, They were generally men of no great Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>science, nor Moral Honesty, and most of them of most sensual and vitious conversation. This appears by their own Writings, both Doctrinal and Historical. What sensual Interpretations of the Law, did the very strict Sect of the Pharisees make? What fleshly Laws have the followers of <hi>Mahomet?</hi> VVhat Vices did the Laws of the Heathens tolerate? Yea what foul errors are in the <hi>Ethicks</hi> of their most rigid Moralists? And you may be sure that their lives were far worse then their Laws: And indeed their own Histories do acknowledg as much; To save me the labor of mentioning them, Read Dr. <hi>Hackwels</hi> Apology on that Subject. Sure such men are incompetent Witnesses in any cause between man and man, and would so be judged at any impartial Judicature. And indeed, how is it possible that they should be much better, when they have no Laws that teach them either what true Happi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness is, or what is the way and means to attain it? Fifthly, Besides all this, their Testimony was onely of the Negative, and that in such cases as it could not be valid.</p>
                        <p n="19">19. Consider also, that all the Adversaries of these Miracles and Relations, could not with all their Arguments or violence hinder thousands from believing them, in the very time and Countrey where they were done: but that they who did behold them, did generally assent, at least to the matter of Fact: So that we may say with <hi>Austin,</hi> Either they were Miracles, or not: If they were, why do you not believe? If they were not, behold the
<pb n="204" facs="tcp:61132:128"/>
greatest Miracle of all, that so many thousands (even of the be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>holders) should be so blinde, as to believe things that never were, especially in those very times when it was the easiest matter in the world to have disproved such falshoods. If there should go a Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>port now of a man at <hi>London,</hi> That should raise the Dead, cure the Blinde, the Deaf, the Sick, the Possessed; feed thousands with five Loaves, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> And that a multitude of his Followers should do the like, and that a great many times over and over, and that in the several parts of the Land, in the presence of Crouds, and thousands of people: I pray you judg, whether it were not the easiest matter in the world to disprove this if it were false? And whether if were possible that whole Countries and Cities should believe it? Nay, whether the easiness and certainty of disproving it, would not bring them all into extreamest contempt? Two things will be here objected: First, That then the Adversaries not believing, will be as strong against it, as the Disciples believing is for it. <hi>Answer,</hi> Read what is said before of the Adversaries in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>competency, and it may satisfie to this. <note n="*" place="margin">

The recitall here of those multitudes of Testimonies that might be produced from Antiquity, is a work that my streight time doth prohibit; but is done by others far more able. Onely that well known pas<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sage in <hi>Josephus</hi> I will here set down. In the time of <hi>Tiberias</hi> there was one Jesus, a wife man (at least if he was to be called a man) who was a worker of great Miracles, and a teacher of such who love the truth, and had many, as well <hi>Jews</hi> as <hi>Gentiles</hi> who clave unto him. This was Christ. And when <hi>Pilate</hi> upon his being ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cused by the chief men of our Nation, had sentenced him to be cru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cified, yet did not they who had first loved him forsake him: For he appeared to them the third day alive again, according to what the Prophets Divinely inspired, had foretold concerning him; as they had done an innumerable number of very strange things be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sides. And even to this day, both the name and sort of persons called Christians, so named from him, do remain.

Tom.</hi> 1. <hi>lib.</hi> 4 <hi>c.</hi> 13 And <hi>Justin Martyr</hi> saith, That the gift of Prophesying was famous in the Church in his time, <hi>Dialog. ad Tryphon.</hi>
                           </note> VVitnesses, who before were most bitter and violent enemies; And divers of these men of note for Learning and place in the world. How mad was <hi>Saul</hi> against the Truth? Surely it could be no favour to the Cause, nor over-much credulity that caused such men to witness to the death, the truth of that for which they had persecuted others to the death but a little before. Nor could childish Fables, or common flying Tales have so mightily wrought with men of Learning and Understanding. (For some such were Christians in all Ages) 21. Nay, observe but the Confessions of these Adversaries, when they came to believe: How generally and ingenuously they acknowledg their former ignorance and prejudice to have been the cause of their unbelief. 22. Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sider also how unable all the enemies of the Gospel have been to abolish these sacred Records. They could burn the Witnesses by thousands, but yet they could never either hinder their succession, or extinguish these Testimonies. 23. Nay, the most eminent Adversaries have had the most eminent ruine: As <hi>Antio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chus, Herod, Julian</hi> with multitudes more: This stone having faln upon them hath ground them to powder. 24 It were not difficult here to collect from unquestioned Authors, a constant succession of VVonders (at least) to have in several Ages accompanied the Attestation of this Truth: and notable judgments that have be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>faln the persecutors of it. And though the Papists by their Fictions, and Fabulous Legends have done more wrong to the Christian Cause, then ever they are able to repair; yet unquestionable Histo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry doth afford us very many Examples; And even many of those actions which they have deformed with their fabulous additions, might yet for the substance have much truth: And God might even in times of Popery work some of these wonders, though not to confirm their Religion as it was Popish, yet to confirm it as the Christian Religion; for as he had then his Church, and then his Scripture, so had he then his special Providences to confirm his Church in their<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> belief, and to silence the several enemies of the
<pb n="206" facs="tcp:61132:129"/>
Faith. And therefore I advise those, who in their inconsiderate zeal are apt to reject all these Histories of Providences meerly because they were written by Papists, or because some Witnesses to the Truth were a little leavened with some Popish errors, that they would first view them, and consider of their probability of Truth or Falshood, that so they may pick out the Truth, and not reject all together in the lump, least otherwise in their zeal against Popery, they should injure Christianity.</p>
                        <p>And now I leave any man to judg whether we have not had an infallible way of receiving these Records from the first VVit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesses?</p>
                        <p>Not that every of the particulars before mentioned, are ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cessary to the proving or certain receiving the Authentick Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cords without depravation, for you may perceive, that almost any two or three of them might suffice; and that divers of them are from abundance for fuller confirmation.</p>

Yet this means, or some other equivalent, I acknowledg so necessary, that without it, I had never been like to have believed. 2. This shews you also that I argue not in the Popish Circle, nor take my faith on their common Grounds: For First, When you ask them, How know you the Testimony of the Church to be Infallible? They prove it again by Scripture; and ther's their Circle. But as I trust not on the Authority of the Romish Church onely, as they do; no nor properly to the Authority of any Church; no nor onely to the Testimony of the Church, but also to the Testimony of the enemies themselves: So do I prove the validity of the Testimony I bring from Nature, and well known Principles, in Reason, and not from Scripture it self, as you may see before. 3. There is a Humane Testimony which is also di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vine, and so an Humane Faith which is also divine. Few of Gods extraordinary Revelations have been immediate,; (The <note n="*" place="margin">

You will acknowledg if God reveal it to an Angel, and the Angel to <hi>Moses,</hi> and <hi>Moses</hi> to <hi>Israel,</hi> this is a divine Revelation to <hi>Israel:</hi> For that is called a divine Revelation, which we are certain that God doth any way Reveal. Now I would fain know, why that which God doth naturally and certainly Reveal to all men<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> may not as properly be called a Divine Revelation, as that which he Reveales by the Spirit to a few. Is not this Truth from God [That the Senses apprehension of their Object (rightly stated)s certain] as well as this [Jesus Christ was born of a Virgin, <hi>&amp;c.</hi>] Though a Saint or Angel be a fitter Messenger to Reveal the things of the Spirit, yet any man may be a Messenger to reveal the things of the flesh. An ungodly man if he have better Eyes and Ears may be a better Messenger or Witness of that matter of Fact, which he seeth and heareth, then a godlier man that is blinde or deaf; especially in cases wherein that ungodly man hath no provocation to speak falsly; and most of all, if his Testimony be against himself. I take that Revelation whereby I know that there was a fight at <hi>York, &amp;c.</hi> to be of God, though wicked men were the chief
<pb n="208" facs="tcp:61132:130"/>
witnesses. For I take it for an undeniable Maxime, That there is no Truth but of God, onely it is derived unto us by va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rious means.</p>

                        <p n="2">2. ANd as I have evideently discovered the full certainty of this Testimony of man concerning the forementioned matter of Fact: So I will shew you why I chuse this for my first and main Argument; and also that no man can believe without the fore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>said Humane Testimony. First then, I demanded with my self; By what Argument did <hi>Moses</hi> and <hi>Christ</hi> evince to the world the verity of their Doctrine? And I finde, it was chiefly by this of Miracles; and sure Christ knew the best Argument to prove the di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vine Authority of his Doctrine, and that which was the best then, is the best still. If our selves had lived in the dayes of Christ, should we have believed a poor man to have been God, the Saviour, the Judg of the world, without Miracles to prove this to us? Nay, would it have been our duty to have believed? Doth not Christ say, <hi>If I had not done the Works that no man else could do, ye had not had sin?</hi> That is, Your not believing me to be the Messias, had been no sin: For no man is bound to believe that which was never con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vincingly revealed:<note place="margin">What the sin against the Holy Ghost is.</note> And (to tell you my thoughts, If you will but pardon the novelty of the Interpretation) I think that this is it which is called the sin against the Holy Ghost, when men will not be convinced by Miracles, that Jesus is the Christ. That which some Divines judg to be the sin against the Holy Ghost (an op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>posing the known Truth onely out of malice against it) Its a Question whether Humane Nature be capable of it. And whether all Humane opposition to Truth be not through ignorance, or pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>valency of the sensual lusts? And so all malice against Truth, is one<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly against it as conceived to be Falshood, or else as it appeareth an enemy to our sensual desires; Else how doth mans Understanding, as it is an Understanding, naturally chuse Truth (either real or appearing) for its object? So that I think none can be guilty of malice against Truth as Truth; And to be at emnity with Truth for opposing our sensuality, is a sin that every man in the world hath been in some measure guilty of: And indeed our Divines do so define the sin against the Holy Ghost, that I could
<pb n="209" facs="tcp:61132:130"/>
never yet understand by their definition what it might be: some placing it in an Act incompatible with the Rational soul; and others making it but gradually to differ from other sins, <note n="*" place="margin">

                              <p>And it is stil a common temptation. Matth. 12.24. <hi>&amp;c.</hi> Mar 3.28. Joh 5.39 33. 45, 46, 47. Joh. 15 22.24.</p>
                           </note> which hath cast so many into terror of soul, because they could never finde out that graduall difference.</p>
                        <p>The sense of the place (which the whole context if you view it deliberately will shew you, seems to me to be this; As if Christ had said; While you believed not the Testimony of the Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phets, yet there was hope: The Testimony of <hi>John</hi> Baptist might have convinced you; yea, when you believed not <hi>John,</hi> yet you might have been convinced by my own Doctrine: Yea, though you did not believe my Doctrine, yet there was hope you might have been convinced by my Miracles: But when you accuse them to be the works of Beelzebub, and ascribe the work of the Divine Power, or Spirit, to the Prince of Devils, what more hope? I will after my Ascention send the Holy Ghost upon my Disciples, that they may work Miracles to convince the world, that they who will believe no other Testimony, may yet through this believe; But if you sin against this Holy Ghost (that is, if they will not believe for all these Miracles) (for the Scripture frequently calls<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> Faith by the name of Obedience, and Un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>belief by the name of sin,) there is no other more con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vincing Testimony left, and so their sin of (unbelief) is in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>curable, and consequently unpardonable: And therefore he that speaketh against the son of Man (that is, denieth his Testimony of himself) it shall be forgiven him (if he yet believe by this Testimony of the Spirit) but they that con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinue unbelievers for all this (and so reproach the Testimony that should convince them, as you do) shall never be for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>given (because they cannot perform the condition of forgiveness.)</p>
                        <p>This I think to be the sense of the Text; And the rather when I consider what sin it was that these Pharisees committed; for sure that which is commonly judged to be the sin against the Holy Ghost, I no where finde that Christ doth accuse them of; but the Scripture seemeth to speak on the contrary <note n="a" place="margin">Act 3.17.</note> that through ignorance they did it, <note n="b" place="margin">1 Cor. 2.8.</note> for had they known they would not have crucified the Lord of Glory. And indeed it is a thing to me altogether incredible, that these Pharisees should know Christ to be the Messiah whom they so desirously expected, and to
<pb n="210" facs="tcp:61132:131"/>
be the Son of God, and judg of all men, and yet to crucifie him through meer malice: charge them not with this, till you can shew some Scripture that chargeth them with it.</p>
                        <p>
                           <hi>Obiect.</hi> Why then there is no sin against the Holy Ghost now Miracles are ceased.</p>
                        <p>

                           </note> humane Testimony, to consider of what necessity it is for the producing of our Faith. Something must be taken upon trust from man whether they will or no: and yet no uncertainty in our Faith neither. First. The meer illiterate man, must take it upon trust, that the book is a Bible which he heares read, for els he knows not but it may be some other book. Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>condly, That those words are in it, which the Reader pronounceth. Thirdly, That it is translated truly out of the originall languages. Fourthly, That the Hebrew and Greek Copies, out of which it was translated, are true Authentick Copies. Fifthly, That it was originally written in these languages. Sixthly, Yea and the meaning of divers Scripture passages, which cannot be under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stood without the knowledg of Jewish customes, of Chronologie, of Geography, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> though the words were never so exactly tran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>slated.
<pb n="211" facs="tcp:61132:131"/>
All these with many more the vulgar must take upon the word of their Teachers. And indeed a faith meerly humane, is a necessary preparative to a faith Divine, in respect of some means and <hi>Praecognita</hi> necessary thereto. If a Scholar will not take his masters word, that such letters have such or such a power, or do spell so or so: or that such a Latine or Greek word hath such a signification; when will he learn, or how will he know? Nay how do the most learned linguists know the signifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cation of words in any language, and so in the Hebrew and Greek Scriptures, but only upon the credit of their Teachers and Authors? And yet certaine enough too in the maine. Tradition is not so useles to the world or the Church as some would have it; Though the Papists do sinfully plead it against the sufficiency of Scripture, yet Scriptures sufficiency or perfection is only in <hi>suo genere,</hi> in its owne kind, and not in <hi>omni genere,</hi> not sufficient for every pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pose. Scripture is a sufficient rule of Faith and life, but not a suf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficient means of conveying it self to all generations and persons. If humane Testimony had not been necessary, why should Christ have men to be witnesses in the beginning? And also still instru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments of perswading others, and attesting the verity of these sacred records to those that cannot otherwise come to know them?

So that the matters which we must receive upon trust from our teachers, are those which we cannot reach to know our selves: and therefore must either take them upon the word of others, or not receive them at all: so that if these Rulers and Stewards do require us to believe, when we know not our selves whether it be truth or not; or if they require us to obey, when we know not our selves whether it be a duty commanded by God or not; here it is that we ought to obey them: For though we know not whether God hath revealed such a point, or commanded such an action, yet that he hath com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manded us to obey them that Rule over us, who preach to us the word of God, this we certainly know, <hi>Heb.</hi> 13.7. Yet I think not we are so strictly tyed to the judgement of a weak Minister of our own, as to take his word before anothers that is more Judi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cious in a neighbour congregation. Nor do I think, if we see but an appearance of his erring, that we should carelessely go on in believing and obeying him, without a diligent searching after the Truth<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> even a liklyhood of his mistake must quicken us to further enquiry, and may during that enquiry suspend our belief and obe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dience: For where we are able to reach to know probabilities in divine things, we may with diligence lightly reach to that de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gree of certainty which our Teachers themselves have attained, or at least to understand the Reason of their Doctrine.

                        <p>If the Scriptures be neither the invention of Devils,<note place="margin">I take it for granted, that good Angels could not be guilty of forging the Scripture.</note> nor of men, then it can be from none but God: But that it is neither of Divels, nor meerly of men, I shall now prove (for I suppose none will question the major proposition) First, Not from Divels; for first they cannot work Miracles to confirm them. Secondly, It would not stand with Gods Soveraignity over them, or with his good<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness, Wisdome and Faithfulness in governing the world, to suffer Satan to make Laws, and confirm them with wonders, and obtrude them upon the world in the name of God, and all this without his disclaiming them, or giving the world any notice of the forgery. Thirdly, Would Satan speak so much for God? So seek his Glory as the Scripture doth? would he so vilifie and reproach himself? and make known himself to be the hatefullest, and most miserable of all creatures? would he so fully discover his own
<pb n="215" facs="tcp:61132:133"/>
wiles? his Temptations? his methods of deceiving? and give men such powerfull warning to beware of his snares? and such excellent means to conquer himself? would the Devil lay such a design for mens salvation? would he shew them their danger? and direct them to escape it? would he so mightily labor to pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mote all Truth and goodness, and the happiness of mankinde as the Scripture doth? Let any man tell me, what book or project in the world, did ever so mightily overthrow the Kingdome of Satan, as this book, and this Gospell-designe? And would Satan be such an enemy to his own Kingdome? Fourthly, If Satan were the author, he would never be so unweariedly, and subtilly industrious, to draw the world to unbelief, and to break the Laws which this book conteineth, as his constant temptations do sensibly tell many a poor soul, that he is. Would he be so earnest to have his own words rejected? or his own Laws broken? I think this is all clear to any man of Reason.</p>

To devise Laws and father them upon God: to feign Miracles, and father them upon God: to set themselves up in the place of God: to say their word is the word of the Lord; to promise eternal sal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vation to those that obey them: to threat damnation to those that obey them not: to draw the world into a course so destru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctive to all their worldly happiness, upon a promise of happiness in another world, which they cannot give; to endeavor so egregi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ously to couzen all mankind; If all this, or any of this, be con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sistent with common honesty, nay if it be not as horrible wick<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>edness as can be committed, then I confesse I have lost my reason.

                           <hi>Mahomets</hi> ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ample indeed comes neerest to such a villany: Yet doth not be pretend to the hundreth part so many Miracles, nor so great, as the Scripture relateth, nor doth pretend to be God, nor any more then a great Prophet: trusting more to his sword for suc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cesse, then to the Authority or truth of his pretended Revelations. Not denying the truth of much of the Scriptures; but add<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing his Alcoran, partly drawn from Scripture, and partly fitted with fleshly liberties and promises to his own ends. And doth not every man among us take that act of <hi>Mahomet</hi> to be one of the vilest that the Sun hath seen? And judg of the man himself accordingly? So that I think it beyond doubt, that no one good man, much lesse so great a number as were the penmen of Scripture, could devise it of their own brain, and thrust it on the world.</p>
                        <p>Secondly, And it is as certaine, that no bad men did devise the Scriptures. Could wicked deceivers so highly advance the glory of God? and labour so mightily to honour him in the world? Would they have so vilified themselves, and acknowledged their faults? Could such an admirable undeniable spirit of holiness, righteousness, and self-deniall, which runs through every veine of Scripture, have been inspired into it from the invention of the wicked? Would wicked men have been so wise, or so zealous for the suppressing of wickedness? Or so earnest to bring the world to Reformation? Would they have been such bitter adversaries to their own wayes? and such faithfull friends to the ways that they hate? Would they have vilified the ungodly, as the Scripture
<pb n="217" facs="tcp:61132:134"/>
doth? And pronounced eternall damnation against them? Would they have extolled the godly, who are so contrary to them? And proclaimed them a people eternally blessed? Would they have framed such perfect and such Spirituall laws? And would they have laid such a design against the flesh? And against all their worldly happiness, as the scope of the Scripture doth carry on? Its needless sure to mention any more particulars: I think every man of the least ingenuity, that considers this, or deli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>berately vieweth over the frame of the Scriptures, will easily con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fesse, that it is more then probable, That it was never devised by any deceiving sinner; much less, that all the penmen of it in seve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rall Ages were such wicked deceivers.</p>
                        <p>So then, if it was neither devised by good men, nor by bad men; then sure, by no men: and consequently must of necessity proceed from God.</p>

                        <p>SEcondly, That it proceeded not meerly from man, I also <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="2"/> prove thus.

                        </p>
                        <p>It is only the Antecedent that here requires proof: which consists of these two branches, both which I shall make clear.</p>
                        <p>First,<note place="margin">
                              <hi>Vid. Wigandum in Method. ante comment. in mino pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phetas.</hi>
                           </note> That the doctrine of Scripture was compiled, and the Mir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>acles done, without the help of much humane learning, or any ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>traordinary naturall endowments.</p>
                        <p>Secondly, That yet the most learned Philosophers never could reach neer the Gospel Mysteries, nor ever work the Miracles that were then done.</p>
                        <p>But I shall say most to the Doctrine. For the proof of the former, consider;</p>
                        <p>First, The whole world was in the times of <hi>Moses,</hi> and the Prophets comparatively unlearned. A kinde of learning the Egyp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tians then had (and some few others) especially consisting in some small skill in Astronomy: But it was all but barbarous igno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rance,
<pb n="218" facs="tcp:61132:135"/>
in comparison of the Learning of <hi>Greece</hi> and <hi>Europe.</hi> Those Writings of greatest Antiquity, yet extant, do shew this. See also Dr. <hi>Hackwell,</hi> as before.</p>
                        <p n="2">2. As rare as Learning then was, yet did God chuse the un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>learned of that unlearned time, to be instruments and Penmen of his choisest Scriptures: <hi>David,</hi> who was bred a Shephard, is the Penman of those divine unmatchable Psalms. <hi>Amos</hi> is taken from a Heardsman to be a Prophet.</p>
                        <p n="3">3. But especially in those latter Ages when the world was grown more wise and learned, did God purposely chuse the weak, the foolish, the unlearned to confound them; A company of poor Fishermen, Tentmakers, and such like, must write the Laws of the Kingdom of Christ; must dive into the Spiritual Mysteries of the Kingdom; must silence the Wise, and Disputers of the world; and must be the men that must bring in the world to be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve. Doubless, as Gods sending <hi>David,</hi> an unarmed Boy, with a Sling and a Stone against an armed Gyant, was to make it appear, that the victory was from himself: So his sending these unlearned men to Preach the Gospel, and subdue the world, was to convince both the present and future generations, that it was God, and not man that did the work.</p>
                        <p n="4">4. Also the course they took in silencing the learned adversaries, doth shew us how little use they made of these Humane helps. They disputed not with them by the precepts of Logick: Their Arguments were to the <hi>Jews</hi> the Writings of <hi>Moses</hi> and the Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phets; and both to <hi>Jews</hi> and <hi>Gentiles,</hi> the miracles that were wrought; They argued more with deeds, then with words: The blinde, the lame, the sick that were recovered, were their visible Arguments. The Languages which they spake, the Prophesies which they uttered, and other such supernatural gifts of the holy Ghost upon them; these were the things that did convince the world. Yet this is no president to us, to make as little use of Learning as they, because we are not upon the same work, nor yet supplied with their supernatural furniture.</p>
                        <p n="5">5. The reproaches of their enemies do fully testifie this, who cast it still in their teeth, that they were ignorant and unlearned men. And indeed this was the great rub that their Doctrine found in the world: it was to the <hi>Jews</hi> a stumbling block, and to the <hi>Greeks</hi> foolishness, and therefore it appeared to be the power of
<pb n="219" facs="tcp:61132:135" rendition="simple:additions"/>
God, and not of man: This was it that they discouraged the people with,<note place="margin">Joh. 7 48.49.</note> 
                           <hi>Do any of the Rulers, or Pharisees believe on him? but this people that know not the Law are accursed</hi>
                        </p>
                        <p n="6">6. To conclude, The very frame and stile of these sacred Wri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tings, doth fully tell us, that they were none of the Logicians, nor eloquent Orators of the world that did compose them. This is yet to this day, one of the greatest stumbling blocks in the world, to hinder men from the reverencing and believing the Scriptures. They are still thinking, sure if they were the very words of God, they would excell all other Writings in every kinde of excellency, when indeed it discovereth them the more certainly to be of God, because there is in them so little of man: They may as well say, If <hi>David</hi> had been sent against <hi>Goliah</hi> from God, he would sure have been the most compleat souldier, and most compleatly armed. The words are but the dish to serve up the sense in: God is content that the words should not onely have in them a savor of Humanity, but of much infirmity, so that the work of convincing the world may be furthered thereby. And I verily think, that this is Gods great design<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> in permitting these pretious spirits of divine Truths, to run in the veines of infirm Language, that so men may be convinced in all succeeding ages, that Scripture is no device of Humane Policy. If the Apostles had been learned and subtil men, we should sooner have suspected their finger in the contrivance. Yea, It is observable, that in such as <hi>Paul,</hi> that had some Humane Learning, yet God would not have them make much use of it, least the excellency of the Cross of Christ should seem to lye in the inticing words of mans wisdom; and least the success of the Gospel should seem to be more from the ability of the Preacher, then from the Arm of God.</p>
                        <p>Besides all this, It may much perswade us, that the Apostles never contrived the Doctrine which they Preached, by their sudden and not premeditated setting upon the work. They knew not whether they should go, nor what they should do, when he calls one from his Fishing, and another from his Custome; They knew not what course Christ would take with himself or them, no not a little be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore he leaves them. Nay, they must not know their imployment till he is taken from them. And even then is it revealed to them by parcels and degrees, and that without any study or invention of their own; even after the coming down of the Holy Ghost;
<pb n="220" facs="tcp:61132:136"/>
                           <hi>Peter</hi> did not well under stand that the <hi>Gentiles</hi> must be called.<note place="margin">Acts 10.</note> All which ignorance of his Apostles, and suddenness of Revelation, I think was purposely contrived by Christ, to convince the world that they were not the contrivers of the Doctrine which they Preached.</p>

                        <p n="2">2. LEt us next then consider, how far short the learned Philoso<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phers have come of this. They that have spent all their days in most painful studies; having the strongest natural endow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments for to enable them, and the learned Teachers, the excellent Libraries, the bountiful incouragement, and countenance of Princes to further them; and yet after all this, are very Novices in all spiritual things. They cannot tell what the happiness of the Soul is, nor where that happiness shall be enjoyed; nor when, nor how long, nor what are the certain means to attain it; nor who they be that shall possess it. They know nothing how the world was made, nor how it shall end; nor know they the God who did create, and doth sustain it: but for the most of them, they multiply feighned Deities.</p>
                        <p>But I shall have occasion to open this more fully anon, under the last Argument.</p>

                           <seg rend="decorInit">M</seg>Y third Argument, whereby I prove the Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vine Authority of the Scriptures, is this. Those Writings which have been owned and fulfilled in several Ages by apparent ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>traordinary Providences of God, must needs be of God. But God hath so owned and fulfilled the Scriptures; <hi>Ergo,</hi> They are of God.</p>
                        <p>The <hi>Major</hi> Proposition will not sure be denied. The direct consequence is, That such Writings are approved by God; and if approved of him, then must they needs be his own, because they affirm themselves to be his own. It is beyond all doubt, that God will not interpose his Power, and work a succession of Wonders in the world, for the maintaining or countenancing of any for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gery; especially such as should be a slander against himself.</p>
                        <p>All the work therefore will lye in confirming the <hi>Minor:</hi> Where I shall shew you; first, By what wonders of Providence God hath owned and fulfilled the Scriptures: And secondly, How it may appear that this was the end of such Providences.</p>
                        <p n="1">
                           <pb n="222" facs="tcp:61132:137"/>1. The first sort of Providences here to be considered, are those that have been exercised for the Church universal. Where these three things present themselves especially to be observed: first, The Propagating of the Gospel, and raising of the Church: secondly, The Defence and continuance of that Church: thirdly, The improbable ways of accomplishing these.</p>
                        <p>And first, Consider, what an unlikely design in the judgment of man, did Christ send his Apostles upon? To bid a few ignorant Mechanicks, Go, Preach, and make him Disciples of all Nations! To send his Followers into all the world, to make men believe him to be the Saviour of the world, and to charge them to expect salvation no other way! Why, almost all the world might say, They had never seen him: And to tell them in <hi>Britain, &amp;c.</hi> of one cru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cified among theeves at <hi>Jerusalem,</hi> and to charge them to take him for their eternal King, this was a design very unlikely to prevail. When they would have taken him by force, and made him a King, then he refused, and hid himself. But when the world thought they had fully conquered him, when they had seen him dead, and laid him in his Sepulchre, then doth he rise and subdue the world. He that would have said, when Christ was on the Cross, or in the Grave [that within so many weeks many thousands of his Mur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derers should believe him to be their Saviour, or within so many years, so many Countries and Kingdoms should receive him for their Lord, and lay down their Dignities, Possessions, and Lives <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 word">

                              <desc>〈◊〉</desc>
                           </gap> needs be from the Finger of God alone. That the Kingdoms of the world should become the Kingdoms of Christ, was then a matter exceeding improbable.<note place="margin">
                              <hi>Object.</hi>
                           </note> But you may Object, That first, It is but a small part of the world that believes; And secondly, Christ himself saith, that his Flock is little. I Answer, First, It is a very great part of the world that are Believers at this day, if we consider besides <hi>Europe,</hi> all the <hi>Greek</hi> Church, and all the Believers that are disper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed in <hi>Egypt, Judea,</hi> and most of the <hi>Turks</hi> Dominions; and the vast Empire of <hi>Prester Jehan</hi> in <hi>Africa.</hi> Secondly, Most Countries of the world have Received the Gospel; but they had but their time, they have sinned away the light, and therefore are now given up to darkness. Thirdly, Though the Flock of Christs Elect are small,
<pb n="223" facs="tcp:61132:137"/>
that shall receive the Kingdom, yet the called, that profess to be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve his Gospel, are many.</p>
                        <p n="2">2. Consider also, as the wonderful raising of the Kingdom of Christ in the world, so the wonderful preservation and continu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance of it. He sends out his Disciples as Lambs among Wolves, and yet promiseth them deliverance and success. His followers are every where hated through the world: their enemies are nu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>merous as the sands of the sea: The greatest Princes and Po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tentates, are commonly their greatest enemies, who, one would think might command their extirpation, and procure their ruine with a word of their mouths: The learned men, and great wits of the world, are commonly their most keen and confident adversaries; who, one would think, by their wit should easily over-reach them, and by their Learning befool them, and by their policy contrive some course for their overthrow. Nay, (which is more wonderful then all) the very common professors of the Faith of Christ are as great haters of the sincere and zealous Professors, almost (if not altogether) as are the very <hi>Turks</hi> and <hi>Pagans:</hi> And those that do acknowledg Christ for their Saviour, do yet so abhor the strictness and spirituality of his Laws and ways, that his sincere subjects are in more danger of them, then of the most open enemies: whereas in other Religions, the forwardest in their Religion are best esteemed of. Besides, the temptations of Satan, the unwillingness of the Flesh, because of the worldly comforts which we must renounce, and the tedious strict conver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sation which we must undertake, these are greater opposers of the Kingdom of Christ then all the rest; yet in despite of all these, is this Kingdom maintained, the subjects increased, and these spiritual Laws entertained and obeyed; and the Church remains both firm and stedfast, as the rocks in the Sea, while the waves that beat upon it do break themselves in pieces.</p>
                        <p n="3">3. Consider also in what way Christ doth thus spread his Gospel, and preserve his Church. First, Not by worldly might and power, not by compelling men to profess him by the Sword. Indeed when men do profess themselves voluntarily to be his sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jects, he hath authorised the Sword to see in part to the execution of his Laws, and to punish those that break the Laws which they have accepted. But to bring men in from the world into his Church; from Paganism, Turcism, or Judaism to Christianity, he never gave

the Sword any such commission; He never levied an Army to advance his Dominion; nor sent forth his Followers as so many Commanders, to subdue the Nations to him by force, and spare none that will not become Christians: He will have none but those that voluntarily list themselves under him: He sent out Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nisters, and not Magistrates or Commanders, to bring in the world; Yea, though he be truly willing of mens happiness in receiving him, and therefore earnestly inviteth them thereto, yet he lets them know, that he will be no loser by them; as their service can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not advantage him, so their neglect cannot hurt him: He lets them know that he hath no need of them, and that his beseeching of them is for their own sakes, and that he will be beholding to none of them all for their service; if they know where to have a better Master, let them take their course: Even the Kings of the earth shall stoope to his Tearms, and be thankful too, or else they are no servants for him: His House is not so open as to welcome all comers, but onely those that will submit to his Laws, and accept of him upon his own conditions; therefore hath he told men the worst as well as the best, that if they will be discouraged or frighted from him, let them go: He tells them of poverty, of disgrace, of losing their lives, or else they cannot be his Disciples. And is not this an unlikely way to win men to him? Or to bring in so much of the world to worship him? He flatters none, he humoreth none, he hath not formed his Laws and Ways to please them. Nay, which is yet more, he is as strict in turning some men out of his Service, as other Masters would be ready to take them in. Therefore he hath required all his Followers to disclaim all such as are obstinate offenders, and not so much as to eat, or be familiar with them. How contrary to all this is the course of the great Commanders of the world, when they would enlarge their Dominions, or procure themselves followers? They have no course but to force men, or to flatter them. How contrary was <hi>Mahomets</hi> course in propagating his Kingdom? He levieth an Army, and conquereth some adjoyning parts; and as his success increaseth, so doth his presumption; he inticeth all sorts to come to his Camp; he maketh Laws that would please their fleshly lusts; he promiseth them beautiful sights, and fair women, and such carnal delights in another world: In a word, as his Kingdom was planted, so hath it been preserved, by no other
<pb n="225" facs="tcp:61132:138" rendition="simple:additions"/>
ways, but force and flattery. But Christ hath not one word for either of these: His compelling men to come in, is but rational perswading.</p>
                        <p n="2">2. Nay, yet more then this, he makes his Church to grow by sufferings; when others increase their Dominions by the destroy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of their enemies, he increaseth his, by suffering them to kill his subjects; An unlikely way one would think, to make the world either love or serve him. There have been few Ages since the first appearing of the Gospel in the world, wherein the earth hath not drunk in the blood of Believers. In the be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginning it was a rare case to be a faithful Pastor, and not a Martyr: Thirty, Three <hi>Romane</hi> Bishops successively were Mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tyred; thousands, yea ten thousand slaughtered at a time; In so much that <hi>Gregory</hi> and <hi>Cyprian</hi> cry out, that the witnesses who had dyed for the Truth of the Gospel were to men innumerable, that the world was all over filled with their blood, and they that were left alive to behold it, were not so many as those that were slain, that no war did consume so many: And the Histories of the Enemies acknowledg almost as much.</p>
                        <p>Now whether this be a likely course to gain disciples, and to subdue the world, you may easily judg. Yet did the Church never thrive better then by persecution; what they got not in number, yet they got in the zeal and excellency of Professors; and seldom hath it lost more, then in prosperity, yea when the vulgar pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fessors have enjoyed prosperity, yet persecution hath almost ever been the lot of the zealous and sincere.</p>
                        <p>And thus I have shewed you those wonders of Providence, which have been exereised for the Church universal.</p>

                           <hi>Rome,</hi> may see most apparent discoveries of the hand of God, yea even in those wars where the enemy hath at last prevailed, as in <hi>Bohemia,</hi> in <hi>Zisca's</hi> time, in <hi>France</hi> at <hi>Merindol</hi> and <hi>Cabriers.</hi> The History of <hi>Belgia</hi> will shew it clearly: so will the strange preservation of the poor City of <hi>Geneva.</hi> But all these are further from us: God hath brought such experiments home to our hands. If we should overlooke the strange providences that produced the reformation in the times of <hi>Henry</hi> the eight, <hi>Edward</hi> the sixt, Queen <hi>Mary,</hi> Queen <hi>Elizabeth,</hi> and King <hi>James</hi>; yet even the strange passages of these yeers past, have been such, that might silence an Atheist, or an Antiscripturist; To see the various streights that God hath brought his people through! The unlikly means by which he still performed it. The unexpected events of most undertakings! The uncontrived and unthought-of wayes which men have been lead in! The strange managing of our counsels and our actions! The plain appearance of an extraordinary providence, and the plain inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>position of an Almighty arme, which hath appeared in almost every fight, even where it went against us was this apparent; and our overthrows were but preparatives to some eminent good; and the means of carrying on the designs of God, whose Issues shewed us what we could not see before. VVe have as plainly discerned the successe of prayer, and our unsuccessfulness when we grew secure, almost, as if we had stood by <hi>Moses, Aaron</hi> and <hi>Hur</hi> in the Mount. How confident were the enemies still before their overthrows? When did we win a field (for the most part) but we lost it first? How little did we prosper when our Armies were fresh, and flourishing, and strong? When was it that we were revived, but when we took our selves for dead? And when we gave up all for lost, then did God most evidently restore it. When it was thought about a yeer or two before; that the whole Kingdome would not have afforded enough, to have resisted the power of the persecuters in one County, they were so oppressed and banished into <hi>America</hi>; then did God arise and his enemies did flie before him; they melted as the waxe before the fire, they were scattered as the chaffe before the wind.</p>
                        <p>Not that I make a meer successe, any evidence of a good cause;
<pb n="227" facs="tcp:61132:139"/>
But successes that have the apparent finger of God, and are brought about by such wonders of providence, I am sure do teach us much of God, and tend exceedingly to confirm us, in the ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity of his promises. Some men are so strongly possest with pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>judice, and others so unobservant of Divine providence, and o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers such Atheists, that they think all things fall out by chance, that it is no wonder if nothing work upon them: Miracles from Heaven had no better successe with most of the beholders in times of old. Sure the strange providences for the Church in the times of <hi>Judges,</hi> of the <hi>Kings,</hi> of <hi>Hester,</hi> of <hi>Nehemiah,</hi> were very convinc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, though they were not miracles. And ours have been as strange as most of theirs. For my own part, having been an eye witness of a very great part of these eminent providences, from the first of the war; I have plainly seen something above the course of nature, and ordinary way of Gods workings, in almost every fight that I have beheld. And many of the adversaries that be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore would not see, yet have seen the hand of God, and have been ashamed, because of their envyings at his people, <hi>Isay</hi> 26.10. Many do yet suspend their judgement of all this, till they see the full Issue: so cannot I: whatever the end may yet prove, I am sure I have seen the Lord in the means: And we may yet set up <hi>Samuels</hi> stone,<note place="margin">1 Sam. 7.12.</note> and say, Hitherto hath the Lord helped us. Hither<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to the end hath not been such as the enemy hoped. If we will see the end before we judg, for ought I know you may stay till the end of the world; and till you are judged your selves. For Gods work is a chaine of many links: every age hath one link, but the last reacheth to eternity, and you cannot see the end till then. If you wait to know the full Issue, why, you shall not see it till the Issue of all things: This folly causeth a succession of enemies to the Church, and of men of deluded and perverse understandings; who will become wiser altogether, when they see the full end indeed: but then it will be too late. It is true, that things are still in a sad confusion, and in the eye of the carnal, worse then they were: But I have so often seen such a cloudy morning to go be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore a Sunshine day, and that God delighteth to work by con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>traries, and to walk in the clouds, and to hide the birth in the womb, till the very hour of deliverance, that I am the less afraid of all this: Our unbelief hath been silenced with wonders so oft, that I hope we shall trust him the better while we live. I know the
<pb n="228" facs="tcp:61132:140"/>
Sword is a most heavy plague; and War is naturally an enemy to Vertue and Civility, and wo be to them that delight in bloud, or use the Sword, but as the last remedy, and that promote not Peace to the utmost of their power: I know also how unsatisfied many are, concerning the lawfulness of the war which hath been man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>aged. This is not a time or place to satisfie such, I have attempt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed that largely in another audience. And as I cannot yet perceive by any thing which they object, but that we undertook our de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fence upon most warrantable grounds; so am I most certaine that God hath wonderfully appeared through the whole. And as I am certain by sight and sense, that the extirpation of Piety was the enemies great designe; which had so far succeeded, that the generality of the most able Ministers were silenced, Lectures and Evening Sermons on the Lords Day suppressed, Christians imprisoned, dismembred, and banished, the Lords Day reproach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, and devoted to Pastimes, that it was as much as a mans estate at lest was worth, to hear a Sermon abroad, when he had none (or worse) at home; to meet for prayer, or any godly exercise, and that it was a matter of credit, and a way to preferment, to revile at, and be enemies against those that were most consciencious; and every where safer to be a Drunkard, or an adulterer, then a painfull Christian; and that multitudes of humane Ceremonies took place, when the worship of Christs institution was cast out (besides the slavery that invaded us in civil respects) so am I most certain, that this was the work which we took up Arms to resist; and these were the offenders whom we endeavoured to offend. And the generality of those that scruple the lawfulness of our war, did never scruple the lawfulness of destroying us, nor of that dolefull havock and subversion that was made in the Churches of Christ among us; though now perhaps they will ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>knowledg some of our persecutors miscariages. The fault was, that we would not dye quietly; nor lay down our necks more gently on the block; nor more willingly change the Gospel for the Mass-book, and our Religion for a fardle of Ceremonies; nor be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tray the hopes of our Posterity to their wils As <hi>Dalilah</hi> by <hi>Samp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son,</hi> so do they by us: They accuse us, that we do not love them, because we will not deliver up our strength, that they may put out our eyes, and make us their slaves. Now the former dangers and miseries are forgotten, and the groans of the godly under
<pb n="229" facs="tcp:61132:140"/>
persecution, and of the land under the departure of their free<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>domes, are not heard, men begin to forget the state they were in, and to be incompetent judges of the former engagement. And as bad as they deeme the successe hath yet been; sure I am many hundred congregations that were in darknesse, and are now in light; and multitudes of souls who by these means have been al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ready converted and brought to the knowledge and love of Christ, are real Testimenies of our happy change: Beside the high hopes of the far greater <note n="*" place="margin">To speak my heart. All that I fear is lest Master <hi>Her<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bert</hi> be a true Prophet, and the Gospel be in its solar motion tra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>velling for the West and <hi>A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>merican</hi> parts, and qultting its present places of resi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence, and un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>worthy pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fessours and possessours: And then fare<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>well England, But else not.</note> spreading of the Gospel; and the foundation that is laid for the happiness of Posterity. I am no Prophet: nor well skilled in the interpretation of Scripture pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phesies: yet the clear and deep engagements of God in this work which I have so evidently discerned, do strongly perswade me, that in despite of all the policy and hopes of our enemies; and of all our own unworthiness, folly, miscarriages and errors, yet God will end this work in mercy, and make the Birth which we travell with more beautifull, then our slanderous enemies or our unbelieving hearts do yet imagine: and that the records of the wonders of this our Age, shall even convince the world of the truth of the Promises, and consequently, That the Scripture is the very word of God. In the mean time, me thinks I hear Christ, as it were, saying to me (as in my personall, so) in the Churches dangers and distresses, as he did to <hi>Peter,</hi> What I do thou know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>est not now, but thou shalt know hereafter.</p>

                        <p>THirdly, Consider also of the strange judgements, which in all ages have overtaken the most eminent of the enemies of the Scriptures.

<pb n="230" facs="tcp:61132:141"/>
Yea our own times have afforded us most evident examples. Sure God hath forced many of his enemies to acknowledg in their an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guish the truth of his threatnings, and to cry out, as <hi>Julian, Vicisti Galilee.</hi>

                        <p>FOurthly, Consider also the eminent Judgements of God that have befallen the vile transgressors of most of his Laws.

                        <p>FIfthly, Consider further of the eminent providences that have been exercised for the bodies and states of particular belie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vers. The strange deliverance of many intended to Martyrdome; As you have many instances in the Acts and Monuments: besides those in <hi>Eusebius</hi> and others, that mention the stories of the first persecutions. If it were convenient here to make particular mention of mens names, I could name you many, who in these late wars have received such strange preservations, even against the common course of nature, that might convince an Atheist of the finger of God therein. But this is so ordinary, that I am perswad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed there is scarce a godly experienced Christian, that carefully observes, and faithfully recordeth the providences of God toward him, but is able to bring forth some such experiment; and to shew you some such strange and unusuall mercies, which may plainly dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cover an Almighty disposer making good the promises of this Scripture to his servants, some in desperate diseases of body, some
<pb n="231" facs="tcp:61132:141" rendition="simple:additions"/>
in other apparent dangers, delivered so suddenly, or so much against the common course of nature, when all the best remedies have failed, that no second cause could have any hand in their deliverance.</p>
                        <p>Sixthly, And Lastly, Consider the <note n="*" place="margin">Was it not neer a Miracle that God wrought for Mistris <hi>Hony<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wood,</hi> when she threw the glass up to the wall, saying, if this glassbreak not, I may be saved, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> and yet took it up whole.</note> strange and evident deal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings of God with the souls and consciences both of believers and unbelievers. What pangs of hellish despaire have many enemies of the truth been brought to? How doth God extend the spirits of his own people? Bruising, breaking, killing them with terrors, and then healing, rasing, and filling them with Joys which they cannot utter? How variously doth he mould them? sometimes they are brought to the gates of Hell; sometime they are ravished with the foretasts of Heaven: The proudest spirits are made to stoop: the lowest are raised to an invincible cour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>age. In a word, The workings of God upon the souls of his peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple, are so clear and strange, that you may trace a supernaturall causality through them all.</p>

                        <p>SEcondly, But though it be undeniable, that all these are the extraordinary workings of God, yet how do they confirm the authority of Scripture? How doth it appeare that they have any such end? <hi>Answ.</hi> That is it I come to shew you next.</p>
                        <p>First<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> Some of these works do carry their end apparently with them, and manifest it in their event. The forementioned provi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dences for raising and preserving the Church, are such as shew us their own ends.</p>
                        <p>Secondly, They are most usually wrought for the friends and followers of Scripture, and against the enemies and disobeyers of it.</p>
                        <p>Thirdly, They are the plain fulfilling of the Predictions of Scripture. The Judgements on the offenders are the plain ful<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>filling of its threatnings: And the mercies to believers are the plain fulfilling of its Promises. As for example; as unlikely as it was, yet Christ foretold his Apostles, that when he was lifted up, he would draw all men to him: He sent them upon an errand
<pb n="232" facs="tcp:61132:142"/>
as unlikely to be so succesfull as any in the world; and yet he told them just what success they should find; how good to their message and how hard to their persons:<note place="margin">Psal. 2.2, 3, 4, 5.</note> The promise was of old, to give Christ the heathen for his inheritance, and the uttermost parts of the earth for his possession.

                           </note> Judgments have been usually executed on offenders, at the very time when they have been either opposing or violating Scripture: And these mercies bestowed chiefly upon believers at such a time when they have been most engaged in de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fence of, or obedience to the Scriptures.</p>
                        <p>Fifthly, They usually proceed in such effectuall sort, that they force the enemies and ungodly to confesse the cause: yea and oft times the very standers by: so do they force believers also to see, that God makes good his word in all their mercies.</p>
                        <p>Sixthly, They are performed in answer to the prayers of be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lievers: while they urge God with the promises of Scripture, then doth he appeare in these evident providences. This is a common and powerfull Argument, which most Christians may draw from their own experiences. Had we no other Argument to prove Scripture to be the word of God, but only the strange successe of the prayers of the Saints, while they trust upon, and plead the promises with fervency; I think it might much confirm experi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>enced men. What wonders, yea what apparent miracles did the prayers of former Christians procure? <note n="c" place="margin">The Legion of <hi>Malta</hi> in the time of <hi>Mar.

But what need I fetch examples so far off? or to recite the multitudes of them which Church history doth afford us? Is there ever a pray<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing Christian here who knoweth what it is importunately to strive with God, and to plead his promises with him believingly, that cannot give in his experiences of most remarkable answers? I know mens atheisme and infidelity will never want somewhat to say against the most eminent providences, though they were Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>racles themselves. The nature which is so ignorant of God, and at enmity with him, will not acknowledg him in his clear discove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries to the World, but will ascribe all to fortune or nature, or some such Idoll, which indeed is nothing: But when mercies are granted in the very time of prayer, and that when to reason there is no hope, and that without the use or help of any other means or creatures, yea and prehaps many times over and over, Is not this as plaine as if God from heaven should say to us, I am ful<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>filling to thee the true word of my promise in Christ my Son?

                           <seg rend="decorInit">M</seg>Y Fourth and last Argument which I will now produce to prove the Scripture to be the Word and perfect Law of God, is this;</p>
                        <p>Either the Scriptures are the written Word and Law of God, or else there is no such extant in the world. But there is a written Word and Law of God in the world. <hi>Ergo</hi> This is it.</p>
                        <p>Here I have these two Positions to prove. First, That God hath such a written Word in the world. Secondly, That it can be no other but this.</p>
                        <p>That there is such a Word, I prove thus: If it cannot stand with the welfare of mankinde, and consequently with that honor which the wisdom and goodness of God hath by their welfare, that the world should be without a written Law; then certainly there is such a written Law. But that it cannot stand with the welfare of the creature, or that honor of God, appears thus. That there be a certain and sufficient Revelation of the VVill of God to man, more then meer Nature and Creatures do teach, is necessary to the welfare of man, and the aforesaid honour of God. But there is now no such certain and sufficient Revelation unwritten in the
<pb n="236" facs="tcp:61132:144"/>
world; therefore it is necessary that there be such a Revelation written. The proof of the <hi>Major</hi> is the main task, which if it be well performed will clearly carry the whole cause; for I believe all the rest will quickly be granted, if that be once plain: There<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore I shall stand a little the more largely to prove it, <hi>viz.</hi> That there is a necessity for the welfare of man, and the honor of Gods VVisdom and Goodness, that there be some further Revelation of Gods VVill, then is in meer Nature or Creatures to be found. And first, I will prove it necessary to the welfare of man; And that thus. If man have a Happiness or Misery to partake of after this life, and no sufficient Revelation of it in Nature or Creatures, then it is necessary that he have some other Revelation of it, which is sufficient. But such a Happiness or Misery man must par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>take of hereafter, which Nature and Creatures do not sufficiently reveal, (either end or means) therefore some other is necessary. I will stand the largelier on the first Branch of the Antece<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent, because the chief weight lyeth on it; and I scarce ever knew any doubt of Scripture, but they also doubted of the immortal state and recompence of souls; and that usually is their first and chiefest doubt.</p>
                        <p>I will therefore here prove these three things in order thus. First, That there is such a state for man hereafter. Secondly, That it is necessary that he know it, and the way to be so happy. Thirdly, That Nature and Creatures do not sufficiently reveal it.</p>
                        <p>For the first, I take it for granted, that there is a God, because Nature teacheth that, and I shall pass over those Arguments drawn from his righteousness and just dispensations, to prove the variety of mens future conditions, because they are commonly known; and I shall now argue from sense it self, because that works best with sensual men: and that thus. If the devil be very diligent to deceive men of that Happiness, and bring them to that misery, then sure there is such a Happiness and Misery; but the former is true, <hi>Ergo</hi> the later. They that doubt of the <hi>Major</hi> Proposition do most of them doubt whether there be any devil, as well as whether he seek our eternal undoing. I prove both toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther. First, By his Temptations: Secondly, Apparitions. Thirdly, Possessions and dispossessions. Fourthly, His Contracts with Witches. I hope these are palpable Discoveries.</p>
                        <p n="1">1. The temptations of Satan are sometime so unnatural, so
<pb n="237" facs="tcp:61132:144" rendition="simple:additions"/>
violent, and so importunate, that the tempted person even feels something besides himself, perswading and urging him: He cannot go about his calling, he cannot be alone, but he feels somewhat fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowing him, with perswasions to sin, yea, to sins that he never found his nature much inclined to, and such as bring him no ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vantage in the world, and such as are quite against the temperature of his body. Doth it not plainly tell us that there is a Devil, la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bouring to deprive man of his Happiness, when men are drawn to commit such monstrous sins? Such cruelty as the <hi>Romans</hi> used to the <hi>Jews</hi> at the taking of <hi>Jerusalem:</hi> So many thousand Christians so barbarously murdered; such bloudy actions as those of <hi>Nero, Caligula, Sylla, Messala, Caeracalla,</hi> the Romane <hi>Gladiatores</hi> the <hi>French</hi> Massacre, the Gunpowder Plot, the <hi>Spanish</hi> Inquisition, and their murdering fifty millions of <hi>Indians</hi> in fourty two years, ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to the Testimony of <hi>Acosta</hi> their Jesuite. Men invading their own neighbours and brethren, with an unquenchable thirst after their blood, and meerly because of their strictness in the common professed Religion, as the late cruel wars in <hi>England</hi> have declared: I say, how could these come to pass, but by the instigation of the Devil? When we see men making a j<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                              <desc>•</desc>
                           </gap>st of such sins as these, making them their pleasure, impudently, and im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>placably against Knowledg and Conscience proceeding in them, hating those ways that they know to be better, and all those per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sons that would help to save them: yea, chusing sin, though they believe it will damn them, despairing, and yet sinning still; Doth not this tell men plainly that there is a Devil, their enemy? When men will commit the sin which they abhor in others, which Rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son is against, when men of the best natures, as <hi>Vespasian, Julian,</hi> &amp;c. shall be so bloody murderers, when men will not be stirred from sin by any intreaty, though their dearest friends should beg with teares upon their knees; though Preachers convince them, and beseech them in the name of the Lord, though wife and children, body and soul be undone by it: Nay, when men will be the same under the greatest judgments, and under the most won<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derful convincing Providences, as appears in <hi>England,</hi> yea, under Miracles themselves.</p>
                        <p>Surely I think all this shews that there is a Devil, and that he is diligent in working out ruine. Why else should it be so hard a thing to perswade a man to that which he is convinced to be good?</p>

These things with meny such more, saith <hi>Lavater,</hi> were then fre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quently and undoubtedly done, and that where the doors were fast locked and the room searched, that there could be no deceit.</p>

Such was the Original of All Souls Day, and other Holidays, as <hi>Tritenhemius, Petrus de Natalibus, l.</hi> 10. <hi>c.</hi> 1. <hi>Polyd. Virg. de inv. l.</hi> 6. <hi>c</hi> 9. do declare. Also praying for the dead, pray<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to Saints, Purgatory, Merits of good Works, Satisfaction, Pil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>grimages, Masses, Images, Reliques, Monastical Vows, Auricular Confession, and most of the Popish Ceremonies have had their life and strength from these Apparitions and Delusions of the Devil. But especially the Cross hath been so magnified hereby, that it is grown the commonest remedy to drive away devils of any in the world for many hundred years. The Churchyard must have one to keep the devil from the graves of the dead, and the Church, and almost every Pinacle, Window, and part of it to keep him thence; the childe Baptized must have one to keep him thence; the High ways also must have them, that he mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lest not the Traveller; yea, when morning and evening, and in times of danger, and in the beginning of any work or duty, men must sign themselves with the Cross, to keep away devils; Inso<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>much that the learned Doctors do handle it among their pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>found Questions, which makes the devil so afraid of the Cross, that he shuns it above all things else? So that you may easily see what great advantage the devil hath got over the souls of a great

part of the world by these Apparitions; and consequently that (this being the end of his endeavors) there is certainly a Happi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness which he would deprive us of, and a Misery that he would bring us to when this life is ended.</p>

IT is manifest also by the devils Possessing and Tormenting the bodies of men; for if it were not more for the sake of the soul then the body, why should he not as much possess or tor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment a beast? Certainly it is not chiefly the outward torment of the person that he regardeth, (though he desire that too) for then he would not labor to settle his Kingdom generally in peace and prosperity, and to make men chuse iniquity for its worldly ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vantages.

But yet if any doubt whether there is any such thing at all, credible History, and late experience may sufficiently satisfie him. The History of the dispossession of the devil out of many persons to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether in a room in <hi>Lancashire,</hi> at the prayer of some godly Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nisters, is very famous; for which these Ministers, being Noncon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formists, were questioned in the High Commission Court, as if it had been a device to strengthen the credit of their cause. Read the Book and Judg. Among the Papists, Possessions are common; (though I believe very many of them are the Priests and Jesuits delusions.)</p>
                        <p>What possession is? and how the devil is confined to a body, or whether circumscribed there in whole or in part, are things be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>yond my reach to know. But that the strange effects which we have seen on some bodies,<note place="margin">The devil had the power of death, saith the holy Ghost. <hi>Heb.</hi> 2.14.</note> have been the products of the special power of the devil there, I doubt not.

And indeed such strange things are oft said and done by the Melancholy and mad, that many learned Physitians think, that the Divel is frequently mixt with such distempers, and hath a maine hand in many of their symptomes.

contracts with them: For that he might procure by other means as likely. Beside, it is some kinde of prosperity, or fulfilling of their desires, which he conditioneth to give them. It is a childish thing to conceit, that the Divel cares so much for a few drops of their blood: Is not the blood of a beast or other creature as sweet? Neither can it be onely the acknowledgement of his power that he amies at; nor a meer desire of being honoured or worshipped in the world, as <hi>Porphyrius</hi> and other Pagans have thought, For he is most truly served, where he is least discerned, and most abhorred, when he most appears. His Apparitions are so powerfull a means to convince the Atheist, who believes not that there is either God, or Devil, or Heaven, or Hell, that I am per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>swaded he would far rather keep out of sight, and that for the most part he is constrained by God to appear against his will.<note place="margin">

So that it is apparent, Satan seeks something more then the honour of domineering, that is, the ruine of the party with whom he deals; And that it is not their bodily and temporall ruine only, appears further by this; that he will heal as well as hurt, and give power to his confederates to do the like, and this tends not to the ruine of mens bodies. Though there be a great deal of deceit among them, yet doubt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>less many have been cured by Popish spels, and Pilgrimages, and Exorcismes. <hi>Carolus Piso</hi> mentions one of his patients, who was incurably deaf a yeer together, and was suddenly cured in the midst of his devotion to the Lady of <hi>Lauretto.

A great deal more to the same purpose he hath; <hi>De abditis re<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

If any should doubt whether there be any such Witches, who thus work by the power of the divel, or have any compact with him, he hath as good opportunity now to be easily resolved, as hath been known in most Ages.

<pb n="245" facs="tcp:61132:148"/>
and he may quickly be informed. Sure it were strange, if in an age of so much knowledg and conscience, there should so many score poor creatures be put to death, as Witches, if it were not clearly manifest that they were such. We have too many examples lately among us, to leave any doubt of the truth of this.</p>
                        <p>So that by these attempts of Satan, to deceive and destroy souls, it is evident, That there is an estate of happiness or misery for every man after this life.</p>

                        <p>THe second thing that I am to clear to you, is, That it is ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cessary <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="2"/> for man to know this happiness, and the way to ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain it; and to know the misery, and the way to escape it; This appears thus.</p>
                        <p>First, If he must go that way, and use those means, then he must needs first know both the end and way, But he that will ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain the end, must use the means; therefore he must ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cessarily know them. All this is so evident, that I believe few will deny it. That man must use the means, before he attain the end, is evident,</p>
                        <p>First, From the nature of the motion of the Rationall soul, which is, to seek the attainment of its propounded end by a voluntary use of means conducing thereto; For as it hath not at its first infusion, that height of perfection, whereof it is capable, so neither is it carryed thereto by violence, or by blind instinct, for then it were not a Rationall motion.</p>
                        <p>Secondly, Yea the very enjoyment of the end, and the seeking of it, are actions of the same nature: It is enjoyed by Knowing,
<pb n="246" facs="tcp:61132:149"/>
Loving, Rejoycing, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> And these actions are the means to at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain it.</p>
                        <p>Thirdly, And if the means were not necessary to the end, the wicked were as capable of it, as the godly: but that will not stand with the Justice of God.</p>
                        <p>Fourthly, If knowledg of the end, and use of means, were not of necessity to the obtaining of that end, then a beast, or a block were as fit a subject for that blessedness, as a man: But these can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not be.</p>
                        <p>And, That man cannot seek a happiness, which he never knew; nor shun a misery, which he was not aware of; nor use means thereto, which he was never acquainted with; I think would be lost and needless labor for me to prove.</p>

                           <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="3"/> THe third thing that I am to prove, is this; That meer nature and creatures, contain no sufficient revelation of the fore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mentioned end and means. This appears thus. First, Nature by the help of creatures, though it tell us that there is a God, yet what he is, or how he will be worshipped, or how he came to be so displeased with the world, or how he must be reconciled, of all this it tels us nothing. Again, though it may possibly acquaint us with an immortall state, yet what the happiness there is, and what the misery, or how we are naturally deprived of that happiness, and how it must be recovered, and who they be that shall enjoy it, of all this it tels us little: Much less of the Resurrection of our bodies from the grave. So also, though nature may possibly finde it self depraved, yet how it came to be so, or how to be healed, or how to be pardoned, it cannot tell. Secondly, If nature, by the meer book of the creatures could learn all things ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cessary, yet first it would be so slow, and by so long study, Second<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, and so doubtfully and uncertainly, Thirdly, and so rarely, that it appears by this, the means of revelation is not sufficient. All this is apparent by event and successe. For what nature and creatures do sufficiently teach, that their Scholars have certainly learned.</p>
                        <p>First, Then observe, how long did the most learned Philoso<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phers study, before they could know those few rude imperfect notions, which some of them did attain to concerning eternity?
<pb n="247" facs="tcp:61132:149"/>
They were gray with age and study, before they could come to know that which a childe of seven year old may now know by the benefit of <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                           </gap>cripture. But all men live not to such an age, therefore this is no sufficient means.</p>
                        <p>Secondly, Observe also how uncertain they were, when all was done; what they speak rightly concerning God, or the life to come in one breath, they are ready to unsay it again in another, as if their speeches had faln from them against their wils, or as <hi>Caiphas</hi> his confession of Christ. They raise their Conclusions from such uncertain Premises, that the Conclusions also must needs be uncertain.</p>
                        <p>Thirdly, Observe also how rare that Knowledg was among them. It may be in all the world there may be a few hundreds of learned Philosophers, and among those there is one part Epicures, another Peripateticks, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> that acknowledg not a future Happi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness or Misery: And of those few that do acknowledg it, none knows it truly, nor the way that leads to it. How few of them could tell what was mans chief good? And those few, how im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perfectly? with what mixtures of falshood? we have no certain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty of any of them that did know so much, as that there was but one God.

So had the Fathers the Doctrine of Sacrificing, for Nature could teach them nothing of that, therefore even the Heathens had it from the Church.

Thirdly, And there are many Truths necessary now to be known, which then were not revealed, and so not necessary.</p>

So that here is no Rest for any but the people of God, except you will call the intollerable everlasting flames of Hell, a Rest.</p>
                        <p>And it were easie to manifest this also by Reason: For first, Gods Justice requires an inequality of mens state hereafter as there was of their lives here. And secondly, They that walk not in the way of Rest, and use not the means, are never like to obtain the End; They would not follow Christ in the Regeneration, nor ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cept of Rest upon his conditions; they thought him to be too hard a Master, and his way too narrow, and his Laws too strict: They chose the pleasures of sin for a season, rather then to suffer affliction with the people of God: They would not suffer with Christ, that so they might raign with him. What they made choise of, that they did injoy: They had their good things in this life; and what they did refuse, it is but reason they should want: How oft would Christ have gathered them to him, and they would not? And he useth to make men willing before he save them, and not to save them against their wils.</p>
                        <p>Therefore will the mouths of the wicked be stopped for ever, and all the world shall acknowledg the Justice of God. Had the ungodly but returned before their life was expired, and been heartily willing to accept of Christ for their Saviour and their King, and to be saved by him in his way, and upon his most reaso<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nable tearms, they might have been saved.</p>

Mens souls are in a doleful case when they have no hope of Happiness, except the Word of God prove false.

Whether then the threats against unbelievers be meant of Unbelief privative and positive only, and not negative?

The Soci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nians and many others of late among us, think that the soul separated from the body, is either nothing, or at least not capable of happiness or misery. Truly, if it should be so, it would be somewhat a sad uncomfortable doctrine to the godly at their death, to think of being deprived of their glory till the resurrection; and somewhat comfortable to the wicked, to think of tarrying out of hell so long. But I am in strong hopes that this doctrine is false; yea very confident that it is so. I do believe, that as the soul separated from the body, is not a perfect man, so it doth not enjoy the Glory and happiness so fully and so perfectly as it shall do after the Resurrection, when they are again conjoined. What the difference is, and what de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gree of Glory souls in the mean time enjoy, are too high things

Accordingly I have been hitherto present<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to your understandings. First, the excellency of the Rest of the Saints, in the first part of this book; and then the verity in the second part. I hope your understandings have now tasted this food, and tryed what hath been expressed. Truth fears not the light, This perfect beauty abhorreth darkness; Nothing but Ig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>norance of its worth can disparage it. Therefore search, and spare not; Read, and read again, and then Judge. What think you? Is it good? Or is it not? Nay is it not the chiefest good? And is there any thing in goodness to be compared with it? And is it true, or is it not? Nay is there any thing in the world more cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain, then that there remaineth a Rest to the people of God? Why if your understandings are convinced of both these, I do here in the behalf of God and his Truth, and in the behalf of your own souls and their Life, require the further entertainment here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of; and that you take this blessed subject of Rest, and commend it as you have found it to your wills and affections; Let your hearts now cheerfully embrace it, and improve it, as I shall pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sent it to you, in its respective Uses.</p>
                        <p>And though the Laws of Method do otherwise direct me, yet because I conceive it most profitable; I will lay close together in the first place all those uses, that most concern the ungodly, that they may know where to finde their lesson, and not to pick it up and down intermixt with Uses of another straine. And then I shall lay down those Uses that are more proper to the Godly by themselves in the end.</p>

                           <hi>Jonas,</hi> that the threatnings of God are not executed upon thee, that on the contrary I should bless the day that ever God made me so happy a Messenger, and return him hearty thanks upon my knees, that ever he blessed his Word in my mouth with such desired success. But if thou end thy days in thy present condition, (whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther thou be fully resolved never to change; or whether thou spend thy days in fruitless purposing to be better hereafter, all is one for that; I say,) if thou live and die in thy unregenerate estate, as sure as the heavens are over thy head, and the earth under thy feet; as sure as thou livest and breathest in this air, so sure shalt thou be shut out of the Rest of the Saints, and receive thy portion in everlasting fire. I do here expect that thou shouldest in the pride and scorn of thy heart, turn back upon me, and shew thy teeth, and say, Who made you the door-keeper of heaven? when were you there? and when did God shew you the Book of Life? or tell you who they are that shall be saved, and who shut out?</p>
                        <p>I will not Answer thee according to thy folly; but truly and plainly as I can discover this thy folly to thy self, that if there be yet any hope, thou mayest recover thy understanding, and yet re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turn to God and live. First, I do not name thee, nor any other: I do not conclude of the persons individually, and say, This man shall be shut out of heaven, and that man shall be taken in: I one<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly conclude it of the unregenerate in general, and of thee condi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tionally, if thou be such a one. Secondly, I do not go about to determine who shall repent, and who shall not; much less, that thou shalt never repent, and come in to Christ: These things are unknown to me; I had far rather shew thee what hopes thou hast before thee, if thou wilt not sit still and lose them, and by thy wilful carelesness cast away thy hopes: And I would far rather perswade thee to hearken in time, while there is hope, and oppor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tunity, and offers of Grace, and before the door is shut against thee, that so thy soul may return and live; then to tell thee, that, there is no hope of thy repenting and returning. But if thou lye hoping that thou shalt return, and never do it; if thou talk of repenting and believing, but still art the same; if thou live and die with the world, and thy credit, or pleasure nearer thy heart then Jesus Christ: In a word, If the foregoing description of the people of God do not agree with the state of thy soul; Is it then a hard question, whether thou shalt ever be saved? Even as hard a question,
<pb n="267" facs="tcp:61132:161"/>
as whether God be true? or the Scripture be his Word? Cannot I certainly tell that thou shalt perish for ever, except I had seen the Book of Life? Why, the Bible also is the Book of Life, and it describeth plainly those that shall be saved, and those that shall be condemned; Though it do not name them, yet it tels you all those signs and conditions, by which they may be known. Do I need to ascend up into heaven, to know, <hi>That without holiness none shall see God?</hi> Heb. 12.14. Or, <hi>That it is the pure in heart who shall see God?</hi> Matth. 5.8. Or, <hi>That except a man be born again, he cannot enter into the Kingdom of God?</hi> Joh. 3.3. Or, <hi>That he that be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieveth not</hi> (that is, stoops not to Christ as his King and Saviour) <hi>is condemned already? and that he shall not see life, but the wrath of God abideth on him?</hi> Joh. 3.18.36. <hi>And that except you repent,</hi> (which includeth reformation) <hi>you shall all perish?</hi> Luke 13.3, 5. With a hundred more such plain Scripture Expressions? Cannot these be known without searching into Gods Counsels? Why, thou ignorant or wilful self-deluding Sot! Hath thy Bible layn by thee in thy house so long, and didst thou never read such words as these? Or hast thou read it, or heard it read so oft, and yet dost thou not remember such passages as these? Nay, Didst thou not finde, that the great drift of the Scripture is, to shew men who they are that shall be saved, and who not? and let them see the condi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions of both estates? And yet dost thou ask me, How I know who shall be saved? what need I go up to heaven to inquire that of Christ, which he came down to earth to tell us? and sent his Spirit in his Prophets and Apostles to tell us? and hath left upon Record to all the world? And though I do not know the secrets of thy heart, and therefore cannot tell thee by name, whether it be thy state, or no; yet, if thou art but willing and diligent, thou maist know thy self, whether thou be an heir of heaven, or not? And that is the main thing that I desire; that if thou be yet mise<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rable, thou mayest discern it and escape it. But canst thou possibly escape if thou neglect Christ and salvation? <hi>Heb.</hi> 2.3. Is it not re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>solved on, That if thou love father, mother, wife, children, house, lands,<note place="margin">Matth. 10.31. Luke 14.26.</note> or thy own life better then Christ, thou canst not be his disciple? and consequently, canst never be saved by him? Is this the word of man, or of God? Is it not then an undoubted con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cluded case, that in the case thou art now in, thou hast not the least title to heaven? Shall I tell thee from the Word of God? It is
<pb n="268" facs="tcp:61132:162"/>
as impossible for thee to be saved, except thou be born again and made a new creature, as it is for the devils themselves to be saved. Nay, God hath more plainly and frequently spoken it in the Scripture, that such sinners as thou shall never be saved, then he hath done, that the devils shal never be saved. And doth not this ti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dings go cold to thy heart? Me thinks, but that there is yet life and hope before thee, and thou hast yet time and means to have thy soul recovered, or else it should kill thy heart with terror, and the sight of thy doleful discovered case, should even strike thee dead with amazement and horror. If old <hi>Ely</hi> fell from his seat and dyed, to hear that the Ark of God was gone, which was but an outward sign of his presence, how then should thy heart be asto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nished with this tidings, that thou hast lost the Lord God himself, and all thy title to his eternal presence and delights? If <hi>Rachel</hi> wept for children, and would not be comforted, because they were not; How then shouldst thou now sit down and weep for the happiness and future life of thy soul, because to thee it is not? VVhen King <hi>Belshazzar</hi> saw but a piece of a hand sent from God, writing over against him on the wall, it made his counte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nance change, his thoughts trouble him, his loyns loosed in the joynts, and his knees smite one against another, <hi>Dan.</hi> 5.6. VVhy, what trembling then should seaze on thee, who hast the hand of God himself against thee? not in a Sentence or two onely, but in the very tenor and scope of the Scriptures? not threatning thee with the loss of a Kingdom onely, as he did <hi>Belshazzar,</hi> but with the loss of thy part in the everlasting Kingdom<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> But because I would fain have thee, if it be possible, to lay it close to thy heart, I will here stay a little longer, and shew thee, first, The greatness of thy loss; and secondly, The aggravations of thy unhappiness in this loss; thirdly, And the Positive miseries that thou maist also en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dure, with their aggravations.</p>

And perhaps their experience and too late understanding may restrain much of the evil motions of their wils which they had formerly here on earth; but the evil disposition is never the more changed, so also wil the conversation of the damned in hel be voyd of many of those sins which they commit here on earth: They will be drunk no more, and whore no more, and be gluttonous no more nor oppress the innocent, nor grind the poor, nor devour the houses and estates of their brethren, nor be revenged on their ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mies, nor persecute and destroy the members of Christ: All these, and many more actual sins will then be laid aside.

No thanks to them, that they sin not as much as ever; Their hearts are as bad, though their actions are restrained.

                        <p>These wretches had no delight in Praising God on earth; their recreations and pleasures were of another nature: and now, when the Saints are singing his prayses, and imployed in magnifying the Lord of Saints; then shall the ungodly be denyed this happiness, and have an imployment suitable to their natures and deserts: Their hearts were full of Hell upon earth: in stead of God, and his Love, and Fear, and Graces, there was Pride, and self-love, and lust, and unbelief; And therefore Hell must now entertain those Hearts, which formerly entertained so much of it. Their Houses on Earth were the resemblances of Hell: in stead of worshipping God, and calling upon his name, there was scorning at his worship, and swearing by his name: And now Hell must therefore be their habitation for ever, where they shall never be troubled with that worship and duty which they abhorred, but joyn with the rest of the damned in blaspheming that God who is avenging their for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer impieties and blasphemies. Can it probably be expcted, that they who made themselves merry while they lived on earth, in deriding the persons and families of the godly, for their frequent worshiping and praising God, should at last be admitted into the Familie of Heaven, and joyn with those Saints in those more per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect praises? Surely without a sound change upon their hearts be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore they go hence, it is utterly impossible. It is too late then to

You should have joyned in it on earth, if you would have joyned in Heaven. As your eyes must be taken up with other kinde of sights; so must your hearts be taken up with other kinde of thoughts, and your voices turned to another tune. As the doors of heaven will be shut against you; so will that joyous imployment be denied to you. There is no singing the songs of Zion in the land of your thraldome: Those that go down to the pit do not praise him; Who can rejoyce in the place of sorrows? And who can be glad in the land of con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fusion? God suits mens imployments to their natures; The bent of your spirits was another way, your hearts were never set upon God in your lives: you were never admirers of his Attributes and works, nor ever throughly warmed with his love: you never longed after the enjoyment of him; you had no delight to speak or to hear of him: you were weary of a Sermon or Prayer an hour long, you had rather have continued on earth, if you had known how; you had rather yet have a place of earthly preferment, or lands and lordships, or a feast, or sports, or your cups, or whores, then to be interessed in the Glorious Praises of God, and is it meet then that you should be members of the Celestiall Quire?

If you would have shined with them as Stars in the Firmament of their Father, you should have joyned with them in their holiness, and faith, and painfulness, and patience: you should have first been ingraffed with them into Christ, the common stock, and then incorporated into the fraternity of the members, and walked with them in singleness of heart, and watched with them with oyl in your Lamps, and joyned with them in mutuall exhortation, in faithfull admonitions, in conscionable reformation, in prayer, and in praise; you should have travelled with them out of the Egypt of your naturall estate, through the Red Sea, and Wilderness of humiliation and affliction, and have cheerfully taken up the Cross of Christ, as well as the name &amp; pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fession of Christians, and rejoyced with them in suffering persecu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, and tribulation: All this, if you had faithfully done, you might now have been triumphing with them in glory, and have possessed with them their masters joy. But this you could not, you would not endure: your souls loathed it, your flesh was a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainst it, and that flesh must be pleased, though you were told plainly and frequently what would come of it: and now you pertake of the fruit of your folly, and endure but what you were foretold you must endure; and are shut out of that company, from which you first shut out your selves; and are separated but from them, whom you would not be joyned with.

You scarce ever heard them pray or sing praises in their families, but it was a ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>xation to you; And you envyed their liberty in the worshipping of God.

Psal. 138 6.</note> as God beholdeth them afar off, so they shal they behold God afar off: Oh how happy men would they now think themselves, if they did not know that there is such a place as hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven, or if they could but shut their eyes, and cease to behold it: Now when their knowledg would help to prevent their misery, they will not know, or will not read and study, that they may know: Therefore then when their knowledg will but feed their consum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing fire, they shall know whether they will or no; as Toads and Serpents know not their own vile and venemous nature, nor the excellent nature of man or other creatures, and therefore are nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther troubled at their own, nor desirous of ours; so is it with the wicked here; but when their eyes at death shall be suddenly open<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, then the case will be suddenly altered. They are now in a dead sleep, and they dream that they are the happiest men in the world, and that the godly are but a company of precise fools, and that ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther heaven will be theirs as sure as anothers, or else they may make shift without it, as they have done here; but when death smites these men, and bids them awake, and rowseth them out of
<pb n="279" facs="tcp:61132:167"/>
their pleasant dreams, how will they stand up amazed and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>founded? How will their judgments be changed in a moment? and they that would not see, shall then see, and be ashamed.</p>

ANother reason to prove that the loss of heaven will more torment them then, is this, Because as the Understanding will be cleared, so it will be more enlarged, and made more ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pacious to conceive of the worth of that Glory which they have lost. The strength of their apprehensions, as well as the truth of them, will be then encreased. What deep apprehensions of the wrath of God, of the madness of sinning, of the misery of sinners, have those souls that now endure this misery, in comparison of those on earth that do but hear of it? what sensible apprehensions of the worth of life hath the condemned man that is going to be executed, in comparison of what he was wont to have in the time of his prosperity? Much more will the actual deprivation of eternal blessedness make the damned exceeding apprehensive of the greatness of their loss; and as a large Vessel will hold more water then a shell, so will their more enlarged understandings con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain more matter to feed their torment, then now their shallow capacity can do.</p>

                        <p n="3">3. ANd as the damned will have clearer and deeper apprehen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sions of the Happiness which they have lost, so will they have a truer and closer application of this Doctrine to themselves, which will exceedingly tend to encrease their torment. It will then be no hard matter to them, to say, This is my loss, and this is my everlasting remediless misery. The want of this, is the main cause, why they are now so little troubled at their condition. They are hardly brought to believe, that there is such a state of misery; but more hardly to believe that it is like to be their own. This makes so many Sermons to them to be lost, and all threatnings and warnings to prove in vain. Let a Minister of Christ shew
<pb n="280" facs="tcp:61132:168"/>
them their misery never so plainly and faithfully, and they will not be perswaded that they are so miserable: Let him tell them of the Glory they must lose, and the sufferings they must feel, and they think it is not They whom he means; such a Drunkard, or such a notorious sinner they think may possibly come to such a doleful end, but they little think that they are so neer it themselves. We finde in all our Preaching by sad experience, that it is one of the hardest things in the world to bring a wicked man to know that he is wicked; and a man who is posting in the way to Hell, to know that he is in that way indeed, or to make a man see himself in a state of wrath and condemnation: Yea, though the Preacher do mark him out by such undoubted signs which he cannot deny, yet will he not apply them, nor be brought to say, It is my case; Though we shew them the Chapter and the Verse where it is written,<note place="margin">Joh. 3.3<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> Heb. 12.14.</note> that without Regeneration and Holiness, none shall see God; and though they know no such work that was ever wrought upon themselves; nay, though they might easily finde by their strangeness to the new Birth, and by their very enmity to Holi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness, that they were never partakers of them, yet do they as verily expect to see God and to be saved, as if they were the most san<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctified persons in the world: It is a most difficult work to make a proud person know that he is proud, or a covetous man to know that he is covetous or an ignorant, or erronious heretical man to know himself to be such a one indeed; But to make any of these to confess the sin, and to apply the threatning, and to believe them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves the children of wrath, this is to Humane strength an impos<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sibility. How seldom do you hear men after the plainest discovery of their condemned state, to cry out and say, I am the man? or to acknowledg, that if they dye in their present condition, they are undone for ever? And yet Christ hath told us in his Word, That the most of the world are in that estate; yea, and the most of those that have the preaching of the Gospel, <hi>For many are called but few are chosen</hi>; so that it is no wonder that the worst of men are not now troubled at their loss of Heaven, and at their eternal misery: because if we should convince them by the most undeniable Arguments, yet we cannot bring them to acknowledg it: If we should Preach to them as long as we have breath, we cannot make them believe that their danger is so great; except a man rise from the dead, and tell them of that place of torments, and tell them
<pb n="281" facs="tcp:61132:168"/>
that their merry Jovial friends, who did as verily think to be sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved as they, are now in hell in those flames, they will not believe. Nay more, though such a Messenger from the dead should appear and speak to them, and warn them that they come not to that place of torments, and tell them that such and such of their dear, beloved, worshipfull, or honorable friends are now there, desti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tute of a drop of water, yet would they not be perswaded by all this. For Christ hath said so, <hi>That if they will not hear</hi> Moses <hi>and the Prophets,</hi>
                           <note place="margin">Luke 16.31.</note> 
                           <hi>neither will they be perswaded, though one should rise from the dead.</hi>
                        </p>
                        <p>There is no perswading them of their misery till they feel it, except the Spirit of the Almighty do perswade them.</p>
                        <p>Oh, but when they finde themselves suddenly in the land of dark<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness, and perceive by the execution of the sentence that they were indeed condemned and feel themselves in the scorching flames, and see that they are shut out of the presence of God for ever, it will then be no such difficult matter to convince them of their misery: This particular Application of Gods Anger to themselves, will then be the easiest matter in the world: then they cannot chuse but know and apply it whether they will or no. If you come to a man that hath lost a leg or an arm, or a childe, or goods, or house, or his health, is it any hard matter to bring this man to apply it? and to acknowledg that the loss is his own? or that the pain which he feels in his sickness is his own? I think not. Why, it will be far more easie for the wicked in hell, to apply their misery in the loss of heaven, because their loss is incomparably greater. O this Ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plication which now if we should dye we cannot get them to, for prevention of their loss, will then be part of their torment it self: O that they could then say, It is not my case! But their dolourous voyces will then rore out these forced confessions; O my misery! O my folly! O my unconceiveable unrecoverable loss!</p>

Judgment will be no longer so blinded, nor Conscience stifled and bribed, as now it is; so the Affections will be no longer so stupified and dead. A hard heart now makes Heaven and Hell to seem but trifles; And when we have shewed them everlasting Glory and Misery, they are as men half asleep, they scarce take notice what we say, our words are cast as stones against a hard wall, which fly back in the face of him that casteth them, but make no impression at all where they fall We talk of terrible astonish<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing things, but it is to dead men, that cannot apprehend it: We may rip up their wounds, and they never feel us; we speak to Rocks rather then to men, the earth will as soon tremble as they: O but when these dead wretches are revived, what passionate sensibility! what working Affections! what pangs of horror! what depth of sorrow will there then be! How violently will they fly in their own faces! How will they rage against their former mad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness! The lamentations of the most passionate wife for the loss of her husband, or of the tenderest mother for the loss of her children, will be nothing to theirs for the loss of heaven. O the self-accusing, and self-tormenting fury of those forlorn wretches! How they will even tear their own hearts, and be Gods Executio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ners upon themselves! I am perswaded, as it was none but them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves that committed the sin, and themselves that were the onely meritorious cause of their sufferings, so themselves will be the chiefest executioners of those sufferings: God will have it so for the clearing of Justice, and the aggravating of their distress: even Satan himself, as he was not so great a cause of their sinning as themselves, so will he not be so great an instrument as themselves of their torment. And let them not think here, that if they must torment themselves, they will do well enough, they shall have wit enough to ease and favor themselves, and resolution enough to command down this violence of their passions: Alas poor souls, They little know what passions those will be! and how much be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>yond the power of their resolutions to suppress! Why have not lamenting, pining, self-consuming persons on earth so much wit or power as this? Why do you not thus perswade despairing soul, who lye as <hi>Spira,</hi> in a kinde of Hell upon earth, and dare not eat, nor drink, nor be merry, but torment themselves with continual terrors? Why do you not say to them, Sir, why will you be so mad, as to be your own Executioner? and to make your own life
<pb n="283" facs="tcp:61132:169"/>
a continual misery, which otherwise might be as joyful as other mens? Cannot you turn your thoughts to other matters, and ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver think of Heaven or Hell? Alas, how vain are all these per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>swasions to him? how little do they ease him? you may as well perswade him to remove a mountain, as to remove these hellish thoughts that feed upon his spirit, it is as easie to him to stop the stream of the Rivers, or to bound the overflowing waves of the Ocean, as to stop the stream of his violent passions, or to restrain those sorrows that feed upon his soul. O how much less then can those condemned souls, who see the Glory before them which they have lost, restrain their heart-renting, self-tormenting Passions! So some direct to cure the Toothach, Do not think of it, and it will not grieve you; and so these men think to ease their pains in Hell: O, but the loss and pain will make you think of it whether you will or no. You were as Stocks or Stones under the threatnings, but you shall be most tenderly sensible under the ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ecution: O how happy would you think your selves then, if you were turned into Rocks, or any thing that had neither Passion nor Sense! O now how happy were you, if you could feel as lightly as you were wont to hear! and if you could sleep out the time of Execution, as you did the time of the Sermons that warned you of it!

But as they cannot lay by their life and beeing, though then they would account an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nihilation a singular mercy; so neither can they lay aside any part of that beeing: Understanding, Conscience, Affections, Memory, must all live to torment them, which should have helped to their Happiness: And as by these they should have fed upon the Love of God, and drawn forth perpetually the Joys of his Presence;
<pb n="284" facs="tcp:61132:170"/>
so by these must they now feed upon the wrath of God, and draw forth continually the dolours of his absence. Therefore never think, that when I say the hardness of their hearts, and their blindness, dulness, and forgetfulness shall be removed, that therefore they are more holy or more happy then before: No, but Morally more vile, and hereby far more miserable.

Now they have no leasure to consider, nor any room in their Memories for the things of another life: Ah, but then they shall have leasure enough, they shall be where they have nothing else to do but consider it; their Memories shall have no other imployment to hinder them; it shall even be engraven upon the Tables of their Hearts.<note place="margin">Deut. 6 9.</note> God would have had the Doctrine of their eternal State to have been written on the posts of their doors, on their houses, on their hands, and on their hearts; He would have had them minde it, and mention it, as they rise and lye down, as they sit at home, and as they walk abroad, that so it might have gone well with them at their latter end: And seeing they rejected this counsel of the Lord, therefore shall it be written always before them in the place of their thraldom, that which way soever they look, they may still behold it.</p>

O how deserved<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly do I now suffer these flames, who was so forewarned of them, and so intreated to escape them! Nay my friends, my parents, my godly neighbours did admonish and exhort me; They told me what would come of my wilfulness and negligence at last, but I did neither believe them, nor regard them; Magistrates were fain to restrain me from sinning by Law and punishment; Was not the foresight of this misery sufficient to restraine me!— Thus wil the Remembrance of all the means that ever they enjoy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, be fuell to feed the flames in their consciences. O that sinners would but think of this, when they sit under the plain instruction and pressing exhortations of a faithfull Ministry! How dear they must pay for all this, if it do not prevaile with them! And how they will wish a thousand times in the anguish of their souls, that they had either obeyed his doctrine, or had never heard him. The melting words of exhortation which they were wont to hear, will be hot burning words to their hearts upon this sad review. It cost the Minister dear, even his daily study, his earnest prayers, his compassionate sorrows for their misery, his care, his sufferings, his spending, weakning, killing pains; But O how much dearer will it cost these rebellious sinners? His lost tears, will cost them blood, his lost sighs, will cost them eternall groans, and his lost exhortations, will cause their eternall lamentations.

                        <p>SEventhly, Again, it will be a most cutting consideration to these damned sinners, to remember on what easie tearms they might have escaped their miserie; and on what easie conditions the Crown was tendered to them. If their work had been, to remove Mountains, to conquer Kingdoms, to fulfill the Law to the smallest tittle, then the impossibility would somewhat asswage the rage of their self-accusing conscience: If their conditions for heaven had been, the satisfying of Justice for all their transgressi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, the suffering of all that the Law did lay upon them, or bear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing that burden which Christ was fain to bear; Why this were nothing but to suffer Hell, to escape hell: but their conditions were of another nature; The yoke was light, and the burden was easie which Jesus Christ would have laid upon them,<note place="margin">Mat. 11.28, 29. 1 John 5.3.</note> his command<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments were not grievous. It was but to repent of their former
<pb n="292" facs="tcp:61132:174"/>
transgressions, and cordially to accept him for their Saviour and their Lord; to study his will, and seek his face; to renounce all other happiness, but that which he procureth us, and to take the Lord alone for our Supream Good: to renounce the government of the world and the flesh, and to submit to his meek and gratious go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernment; to forsake the wayes of our own devising, and to walk in his holy delightfull way, to engage our selves to this by Covenant with him, and to continue faithfull in that Covenant. These were the tearms on which they might have enjoyed the Kingdom: And was there any thing unreasonable in all this? Or had they any thing to object against it? Was it a hard bargain to have Heaven upon these conditions? When all the price
that is required, is only our Accepting it in that way that the Wisdom of our Lord thinks meet to bestow it? And for their want of ability to perform this, it consisteth chiefly in their want of will: If they were but willing, they should finde that God would not be backward to assist them, If they be willing, Christ is much more willing.</p>
                        <p>O when the poor tormented wretch, shall look back upon these easie tearms which he refused, and compare the labour of them with the pains and loss which he there sustaineth, it cannot be now conceived how it will rent his very heart! Ah (thinks he) how justly do I suffer all this, who would not be at so small cost and pains to avoid it! Where was my understanding when I neglect<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed that gratious offer! When I called the Lord, a hard Master! and thought his pleasant service to be a bondage, and the service of the Divel and my flesh, to be the only delight and freedom! Was I not a thousand times worse then mad, when I censured the holy way of God, as needless preciseness! And cryed out on it as an intollerable burden! When I thought the Laws of Christ, too strict! and all too much that I did for the life to come! O, what had all the trouble of duty been, in comparison of the trouble that I now sustain? Or all the sufferings for Christ and wel-doing, in comparison of these sufferings that I must undergo for ever? What if I had spent my dayes in the strictest life that ever did Saint? what if I had lived still upon my knees? What if I had lost my credit with men? and been hated of all men for the sake of Christ? and born the reproach and scorn of the foolish? What if I had been imprisoned, or banished, or put to death? O what
<pb n="293" facs="tcp:61132:174"/>
had all this been to the miseries that I now must suffer? Then had, my sufferings now been all over, vvhereas they do but now begin but vvill never end: Would not the heaven vvhich I have lost, have recompenced all my losses? and should not all my sufferings have been there forgotten? What if Christ had bid me do some great matter? as to live in continual tears and sorrow, to suffer death a hundred times over? (vvhich yet he did not) should I not have done it? How much more, vvhen he said but, Believe and be saved? Seek my face, and thy soul shall live: Love me above all, vvalk in my sweet and holy vvay, take up thy Cross and follow me, and I vvill save thee from the vvrath of God, and I vvill give thee everlasting life. O gracious offer! O easie tearms! O cursed wretch, that vvould not be perswaded to accept them.</p>

                        <p>NInthly, Yet much more will it add unto their torment, when they consider that all this-was their own doings, and that they most wilfully did procure their own destruction: Had they been forced to sin whether they would or no, it would much abate the rage of their consciences; Or if they were punished for an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>other mans transgressions; or if any other had been the chiefest author of their ruine; But to think, that it was the choice of their own will; and that God had set them in so free a condition, that none in the world could have forced them to sin against their wils, this will be a griping thought to their hearts. What (thinks this wretched creature) had I not enemies enough in the world, but I must be an enemy to my self? God would neither give the devil nor the world so much power over me, as to force me to commit the least transgression: if I had not consented, their temprations had been in vain, they could but intice me, it was my self that yielded, and that did the evil; and must I needs lay hands upon mine own soul? and imbrew my hands in my own blood? who should pitty me, who pittied not my self, and who brought all this upon mine own head? When the enemies of Christ did pull down his Word and Laws, his Ministry and Worship, the news of it did rejoyce me; when they set up dumb, or seducing, or ungodly Ministers, in stead of the faithful Preachers of the Gospel, I was glad to have it so; when the Minister told me the evil of
<pb n="295" facs="tcp:61132:175"/>
my ways, and the dangerous state that my soul was in, I took him for mine enemy, and his Preaching did stir up my hatred against him and every Sermon did cut me to the heart, and I was ready to gnash my teeth in indignation against him. If a drunken Ceremonious Preacher did speak me fair, or read the Common Prayer, or some toothless Homily instead of a searching plain-dealing Sermon, why, this was according to my own heart; never was I vvilling of the means of mine own welfare; never had I so great an enemy as my self; never did God do me any good, or offer me any for the wel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fare of my soul, but I resisted him, and vvas utterly unwilling of it: he hath heaped mercy upon me, and renewed one deliverance after another, and all to intice my heart unto him, and yet vvas I never heartily willing to serve him: He hath gently chastized me, and made me groan under the fruit of my disobedience, and yet, though I promised largely in my affliction, I was never unfainedly vvilling to obey him: Never did a good Magistrate attempt a Reformation, but I vvas against it, nor a good Minister labour the saving of the Flock, but I vvas ready to hinder as much as I could; nor a good Christian labour to save his soul, but I vvas ready to discourage and hinder him to my power, as if it vvere not enough to perish alone, but I must draw all others to the same destruction. O vvhat cause hath my vvife, my children, my servants, my neighbours, to curse the day that ever they saw me! As if I had been made to resist God, and to destroy my own and other mens souls, so have I madly behaved my self. Thus will it gnaw upon the hearts of these wretches, to remember that they were the cause of their own undoing; and that they vvilfully and obsti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nately persisted in their Rebellion, and were meer Voluntiers in the service of the Devil; They vvould venture, they vvould go on, they would not hear him <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

To resist God, to conquer the Spirit, to overcome the power of Mercies, Judgments, and the Word it self, to silence Conscience! all this did they take upon them, and perform. What a number of sins did they manage at once? vvhat difficulties did they set upon? even the conquering of the power of Reason it self. What dangers did they adven<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture on? Though they walked in continual danger of the wrath of God, and knew he could lay them in the dust in a moment; though they knew they lived in danger of eternal perdition, yet would they run upon all this.

If they could but have kept their present enjoyments, they would not much have cared for the loss of Heaven: let them take it that have more minde of it; But catching at the shadow and loosing the sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stance, they now finde that they have lost both, and that when
<pb n="300" facs="tcp:61132:178"/>
they rejected Christ, they rejected all things. If they had lost and forsaken all for Christ, they would have found all again in him; for he would have been all in all to them: But now they have forsaken Christ for other things, they shall lose Christ and that al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>so for which they did forsake him.</p>

                        <p>FIrst, They shall lose their present presumptuous conceit and belief, of their Interest in God, and of his favour towards them, and of their part in the merits and sufferings of Christ. This false Belief doth now support their spirits, and defend them from the terrors that else would seiz upon them; and fortifie them against the fears of the wrath to come. Even as true Faith doth afford the soul a true and grounded support and consolation, and enableth us to look to Eternity with undaunted courage: So also a false ungrounded Faith doth afford a false ungrounded comfort; and abates the trouble of the considerations of Judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment and damnation. But alas, this is but a palliat salve, a deceitful comfort; what will ease their trouble when this is gone? VVhen they can Believe no longer, they will be quieted in minde no long<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er, and rejoyce no longer. If a man be neer to the greatest mischief, and yet strongly conceit that he is in safety; his conceit may make him as cheerfull as if all were well indeed, till his misery comes, and then both his conceit and comforts vanish. An ungrounded per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>swasion of happiness, is a poor cure for reall misery. VVhen the mischief comes, it will cure the mis-belief; but that belief can nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther prevent nor cure the mischief. If there were no more to make a man happy, but to believe that he is so, or shall be so, happiness would be far commonner then now it is like to be. It is a won<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der, that any man who is not a stranger both to Gospel and Reason, should be of the Antinomian faith in this; who tell us that faith is but the believing that God loveth us, and that our sins are already pardoned through Christ; that this is the cheif thing that Ministers should preach; that our Ministers preach not Christ, because they preach not this; that every man ought thus to believe, but no man to question his Faith, whether he
<pb n="301" facs="tcp:61132:178"/>
believe truly or not, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> But if all men must believe that their sins are pardoned, then most of the world must believe a lye; And if no man ought to question the truth of his faith, then most men shall rest deluded with an ungrounded belief. The Scripture command<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth us first to believe for remission of sins, before we believe that our sins are remitted: If we believe in Christ, that is, accept him cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dially for our Saviour, and our King, then we shall receive the par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>don of sins. The truth is, we have more ado to Preach down this Antinomian faith, then they have to Preach it up; and to Preach our people from such a believing, then they have to preach them to it. I see no need to perswade people so to believe, the generality are strong and confident in such a belief already. Take a congregation of 5000. persons, and how few among them all will you finde, that do not believe that their sins are pardoned, and that God loves them? Especially of the vilest sinners, who have least cause to believe it? Indeed, as it is all the work of those men to perswade people to this belief<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

I know men cannot believe Christ, or believe in, or upon Christ, either too soon, or too much. But they may believe, or judg that themselves are pardoned, adopted, and in favour with God, too soon, and too much. For a false judgment is always too much and too soon. As true grounded Faith is the master grace in the Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>generate, and of greatest use in the Kingdom of Christ; so is a false ungrounded faith, the master vice in the unregenerate soul, and of greatest use in the Kingdom of Satan. Why do such a multitude sit still, when they might have pardon for the seeking? but that they verily think they are pardoned already? Why do men live so con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tentedly in the power of the devil, &amp; walk so carelesly in the certain way to Hel? but that they think their way wil have no such end, and that the Divel hath nothing to do with them? they defie him, they spit at the mention of his name. If you could aske so many 1000 as are now in Hell, What madness could cause you to come hither vo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>luntarily? or to follow Satan to this place of torment? when you might follow Christ to the land of Rest? They would most of them
<pb n="302" facs="tcp:61132:179"/>
answer you, VVe believed that we had followed towards Salvati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on; and that the way which we were in, would have brought us to Heaven: VVe made sure account of being saved, till we found our selves damned; and never feared Hell, till we were suddenly in it<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> we would have renounced our sinfull courses and companions, but that we thought we might have them, and heaven too; VVe would have sought after Christ more heartily, but that we thought we had part in him already; VVe would have been more earn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>est seekers of Regeneration, and the power of godliness, but that we verily thought we were Christians before O if we had known as much as now we know! what lives would we have led! what persons would we have been! But we have flattered our selves in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to these unsufferable torments: VVe were told of this before from the word of God: but we would not believe it, till we felt it; and now there is no remedy. — Reader, do but stop, and think here with thy self, how sad a Case this is? That men should so resolutely cheat themselves of their Everlasting Rest? The Lord grant it never prove thy own case. I would be very loath to weaken the true faith of the meanest Christian, or to perswade any man that his faith is false, when it is true: God forbid, that I should so disparage that pretious grace which hath the stamp of the spirit! or so trouble the soul that Christ would have to be comforted! But I must needs in faithfullness tell thee, that the confident belief of their good estate and of the pardon of their sins, which the careless, unholy, unhumbled multitude amongst us, do so commonly boast of, will prove in the end but a soul-damning delusion. It hath made me ready to tremble many a time, to hear a drunken, ungodly, unfaithful Minister, as confi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dently in his formall prayers in the Pulpit, give God thanks for Vocation, Justification, Sanctification, and assured hope of Glori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fication, as if he had been a most assured Saint! when it may be his Sermon was intended to reproch the Saints,<note place="margin">Luk. 18.11. Num. 16.3.5.</note> and to jeer at Sancti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fication! Me thoughts I even heard the Pharisee say, I thank thee that I am not as other men: Or <hi>Corah</hi>; Are not all the people holy, every one? How commonly do men thank God for these, which they never received, nor ever shall do? How many have thanked God for pardon of sin, who are now tormented for it! and for Sanctification and assured hope of Glory, who are now shut out of that Inheritance of the Sanctified? I warrant you,
<pb n="303" facs="tcp:61132:179"/>
ther's none of this believing in hell: nor any perswasions of pardon or happiness, nor any boasting of their honesty, nor ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stifying of themselves: This was but Satans stratagem, that being blindfold they might follow him the more boldly, but then he will uncover their eyes, and they shall see where they are.</p>

                        <p n="2">2. ANother addition to the misery of the damned will be this; That with the loss of heaven, they shall lose also all their hopes. In this life, though they were threatned with the wrath of God, yet their hope of escaping it did bear up their hearts; And when they were wounded with the terrors of the Word, they lick't all whole again with their groundless hopes; but then they shall part with their hopes and heaven together: We can now scarce speak with the vilest Drunkard, or Swearer, or covetous Wordling, or scorner at Godliness, but he hopes to be saved for all this: If you should go to all the Congregation, or Town, or Countrey, and ask them one by one, whether they hope to be saved? how few shall you meet with, that will not say yea? or that make any great question of it? But, O happy world, if Salvation were as common as this Hope! Even those whose hellish nature is written in the face of their conversation, that he that runs may read it, whose tongues plead the cause of the devil, and speak the language of hell<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> and whose delight is in nothing but the works of the flesh, yet these do strongly hope for heaven, though the God of heaven hath told them over and over again in his Word, that no such as they shall ever come there. Though most of the world shall eternally perish, and the Judg of the world himself hath told us, that of the many that are called, yet but few are chosen, yet almost all do hope for it, and cannot endure any man that doth but question their hopes: Let but their Minister Preach against their false hopes; or their best friend come to them, and say. <hi>I am afraid your present hopes of heaven will deceive you, I see you minde not your soul, your heart is not set upon Christ and heaven, you do not so much as pray to God, and worship him in your Family; and the Scripture gives you not the least hope of being saved in such a condition as this is:</hi> How ill would they take such an admonition as this? and bid the Admonisher look to himself, and let them alone,
<pb n="304" facs="tcp:61132:180"/>
he should not answer for them, they hope to be saved as soon as these preciser men, that pray, and talk of heaven so much.—Nay, so strong are these mens hopes, that they will dispute the case with Christ himself at Judgment, and plead their eating and drinking in his presence, their Preaching in his Name, and casting out de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vils, (and these are more probable Arguments, then our Baptism, and common Profession, and name of Christians) they will stifly deny that ever they neglected Christ in hunger, nakedness, prison, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> (and if they did, yet that is less then stripping, imprisoning, banishing, or killing Christ in his Members,) till Christ confute them with the sentence of their condemnation: Though the heart of their hopes will be broken at their death, and particular Judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, yet it seems they would fain plead for some hope at the general Judgment. But O the sad state of these men, when they must bid farewell to all their Hopes! when their Hopes shall all perish with them! Reader, if thou wilt not believe this, it is because thou wilt not believe the Scriptures. The holy Ghost hath spoke it as plain as can be spoken, <hi>Prov.</hi> 11.7. <hi>When a wicked man dieth, his expectation shall perish, and the hope of unjust men perisheth,</hi> Prov. 10.28. <hi>The hope of the righteous shall be gladness, but the ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pectation of the wicked shall perish.</hi> See Isai. 28.15, 18. Job 27.8, 9. <hi>For what is the hope of the Hypocrite, though he hath gained, when God taketh away his soul? Will God hear his cry when trouble cometh upon him?</hi> Job 8.12, 13, 14. <hi>Can the Rush grow up without mire? Can the Flag grow without water? whilst it is yet in its greeness, not cut down, it withereth before any other herb; So are the paths of all that forget God, and the Hypocrites hope shall perish; whose hope shall be cut off, and whose trust shall be a Spiders Web; He shall leane upon his house, but it shall not stand, he shall hold it fast, but it shall not endure.</hi> Job 11.20. <hi>But the eyes of the wicked shall fail, and they shall not escape, and their hope shall be as the giving up of the Ghost</hi>: The giving up of the Ghost is a fit, but terrible re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>semblance of a wicked mans giving up of his hopes. For first, As the soul departeth not from the body without the greatest terror and pain, so also doth the hope of the wicked depart. O the dire<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful gripes and pangs of horror that seize upon the soul of the sinner at Death and Judgment, when he is parting with all his former hopes! Secondly, The soul departeth from the body sud<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>denly, in a moment, which hath there delightfully continued so
<pb n="305" facs="tcp:61132:180"/>
many years; Just so doth the hope of the wicked depart. Thirdly, The soul which then departeth, will never return to live with the body in this world any more; and the hope of the wicked when it departeth, taketh an everlasting Farewel of his soul. A miracle of Resurrection shall again conjoyn the soul and body, but there shall be no such miraculous Resurrection of the damned's hope. Me thinks it is the most doleful Spectacle that this world affords, to see such an ungodly person dying, and to think of his soul, and his hopes departing together! and with what a sad change he pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sently appeares in another world? Then if a man could but speak with that hopeless soul, and ask it; what, are you now as confident of salvation as you were wont to be? Do you now hope to be sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved as soon as the most godly? O what a sad answer would he re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turn<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> They are just like <hi>Corah Dathan,</hi> and their Companions; while they are confident in their Rebellion against the Lord<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> and cry out, <hi>Are not all the people holy?</hi> They are suddenly swallowed up, and their hopes with them: Or like <hi>Ahah,</hi> who hating and imprisoning the Prophet for foretelling his danger, while he is in confident hopes to return in peace, is suddenly smitten with that mortal Arrow, which let out those hopes, together with his soul: Or like a Thief upon the Gallows, who hath a strong conceit that he shall receive a Pardon, and so hopes, and hopes, till the Ladder is turned: Or like the unbelieving sinners of the world before the Flood, who would not believe the threatnings of <hi>Noah,</hi> but per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>haps deride him for preparing his Ark so many years together, when no danger appeared, till suddenly the Flood came and swept them all away. If a man, had asked these men when they were climbing up into the tops of Trees and Mountains, VVhere is now your hope of escaping? Or your merry deriding at the painful preventing preparations of godly <hi>Noah?</hi> Or your contemptuous unbelief of the warnings of God? What do you think these men would then say? when the waters still pursued them from place to place, till it devoured their hopes and them together? Or if one had asked <hi>Ahab,</hi> when he had received his wound, and turned out of the battel to die; what think you now of the Prophesie of <hi>Micaiah</hi>? will you release him out of prison? do you now hope to return in peace? Why, such a sudden overthrow of their hopes will every unregenerate sinner receive. While they were upon earth, they frustrated the expectations (as I may say) of God and man:
<pb n="306" facs="tcp:61132:181"/>
God sent his messengers to tell them plainly of their danger, and said, It may be they will hear, and return and escape: but they stiffened their necks and hardened their hearts: The Mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ster studied, and instructed and perswaded, in hope: And when one Sermon prevailed not, he laboured to speak more plainly and piercingly in the next, in hope that at last they would be perswad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed and return: till their hopes were frustrate, and their labor lost, and they were fain to turn their exhortation to lamentation, and to sit down in sorrow for mens wilful misery; and take up the sad exclamation of the Prophet, <hi>Isai.</hi> 53.1. <hi>Who hath be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieved our report? And to whom is the arm of the Lord revealed?</hi> So did godly parents also instruct their children in Hope; and watch over them, and pray for them, hoping that at last their hearts would turn to Christ. And is it not meet that God should frustrate all their hopes, who have frustrated the hopes of all that desired their welfare? O that careless sinners would be awaked to think of this in time? If thou be one of them, who art reading these lines, I do here as a friend advise thee from the word of the Lord, that, as thou wouldst not have all thy Hopes deceive thee when thou hast most need of them, thou presently try them whether they will prove currant at the touchstone of the Scripture; and if thou finde them unsound, let them go, what sorrow soever it cost thee. Rest not till thou canst give a reason of all thy hopes:<note place="margin">1 Pet. 3.15.</note> till thou canst prove that they are the hopes which grace and not nature only hath wrought,<note place="margin">Markes of sound Hope.</note> that they are grounded upon Scripture-pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mises and sound evidences, that they purifie thy heart: that they quicken, and not cool thy endeavours in godliness; that the more thou hopest, the lesse thou sinnest; and the more pain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful thou art in following on the work; and not grow more loose and careless by the increasing of thy hopes: that they make thee set lighter by all things on earth, because thou hast such hopes of higher possessions: that thou art willing to have them tryed, and fearfull of being deceived: that they stir up they desires of en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>joying what thou hopest for, and the deferring thereof is the trouble of thy heart, <hi>Prov.</hi> 13.12. If thou be sure that thy hopes be such as these; God forbid that I should speak a word against them, or discourage thee from proceeding to hope thus to the end: No, I rather perswade thee to go on in the strength of the Lord; and what ever men or devils, or thy own unbelieving
<pb n="307" facs="tcp:61132:181" rendition="simple:additions"/>
heart shall say against it, go on, and hold fast thy hope, and be sure, it shall never make thee ashamed. But if thy hope be not of this spiritual nature, and if thou art able to give no better reason why thou hopest, then the worst in the world may give, That God is mercifull; and thou must speed as well as thou canst, or the like; and hast not one sound evidence of a saving work of grace upon thy soul to shew for thy hopes; but only hopest that thou shalt be saved because thou wouldest have it so, and because it is a terrible thing to despaire; If this be thy case, delay not an hour; but presently cast away those hopes, that thou mayest get into a capacity of having better in their stead. But it may be thou wilt think this strange doctrine, and say, VVhat, would you per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>swade me directly to despaire? <hi>Answ.</hi> Sinner; I would be loath to have thy soul destroyed by wilful self-delusion. The truth is, There is a hope (such as I have before shewed thee of) which is a singular grace and duty<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> and there is a hope which is a noto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rious dangerous sin. So consequentely there is a despaire which is a grievous sin: and there is a despaire which is absolutely neces<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sary to thy salvation.

I would not have thee doubt of any of these in the least measure, much less despaire.<note place="margin">John 3.3. Heb 12.14. Luke 13.3, 5. Luke 14.24, 25, 26, 27, &amp;c. Mat. 6.21.

Luke 16.13.</note> But this is the despaire that I would perswade thee to, as thou lovest thy soul: That thou despaire of ever being saved, except thou be born again; or of seeing God without Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liness: or of escaping perishing, except thou soundly Repent: Or of ever having part in Christ, or salvation by him, or ever being one of his true Disciples, except thou love him above Father, mother, or thy own life: Or of ever having a Treasure in Heaven, except thy very heart be there: Or of ever scaping eternal death, if thou walk after the flesh, and dost not by the spirit mortify the
<pb n="308" facs="tcp:61132:182"/>
deeds of the flesh; or of ever truly loving God, or being his ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vant, while thou lovest the world, and servest it. These things I would have thee despair of; and what ever else God hath told thee shall never come to passe. And when thou hast sadly searched into thy own heart, and findest thy self in any of these cases, I would have thee despair thy self of ever being saved in that state thou art in; Never stick at the sadness of the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clusion, man, but acknowledg plainly, If I die before I get out of this estate, I am lost for ever. It is as good deal truly with thy self as not: God will not flatter thee, he will deal plainly, whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther thou do or not. The very truth is, This kinde of despair is one of the first steps to Heaven. Consider, if a man be quite out of his way, what must be the first means to bring him in again? Why, a despair of ever coming to his journies end in the way that he is in. If his home be Eastward, and he be going Westward, as long as he hopes he is the right, he will go on; and as long as he so goes on hoping<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> he goes further amiss. Therefore when he meets with some body who assures him that he is clean out of his way, and brings him to despair of coming home, except he turn back again; then he will return, and then he may hope and spare not. Why, sinner, Just so it is with thy soul: Thou art born out of the way to Heaven; and in that way thou hast proceeded many a yeer; Yet thou goest on quietly, and hopest to be saved, because thou art not so bad as many others. Why, I tell thee, ex<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>cept thou be brought to throw away those hopes, and see that thou hast all this while been quite out of the way to Heaven, and hast been a childe of wrath, and a servant of Satan, unpardoned, unsanctified, and if thou hadst dyed in this state, hadst been certain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly damned; I say, till thou be brought to this, thou wilt never return and be saved. Who will turn out of his way, while he hopes he is right? And let me once again tell thee, that if ever God mean good to thy soul, and intend to save thee, this is one of the first things he will work upon thee: Remember what I say, till thou feel God convincing thee, that the way which thou hast lived in, will not serve the turn, and so breaking down thy for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer hopes, there is yet no saving work wrought upon thee; how well soever thou mayest hope of thy self. Yea, this much more, If any thing keep thy soul out of Heaven (which God forbid) there is nothing in the world liker to do it, then thy false hopes of being
<pb n="309" facs="tcp:61132:182"/>
saved, while thou art out of the way to salvation. Why else is it that God cryes down such hopes in his word? Why is it that every faithful, skilful Minister doth bend all his strength against the false faith and hope of sinners? as if he were to fight against neither small nor great, but this prince of iniquity? Why alas, they know that these are the main pillars of Satans Kingdom; Bring down but them two, and the house will fall. They know also the deceit and vanity of such hopes: that they are directly contrary to the Truth of God, and what a sad case that soul is in, who hath no other hope, but that Gods word will prove false: when the truth of God is the only ground of true hope. Alas, it is no pleasure to a Minister to speak to people on such an unwel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come subject; no more then it is to a pitifull Physitian, to tell his patient; I do despair of your life, except you let blood, or there is no hope of the cure, except the gangren'd member be cut off. If it be true, and of flat necessity, though it be displeasing, there is no remedy.<note place="margin">Gal. 5.18, 19, 20, 21, 22, 23, 24. 2 Cor. 5.17.</note> Why, I beseech you think on it reasonably without prejudice or passion, and tell me, Where doth God give any hope of your salvation till you are new Creatures? <hi>Gal.</hi> 6.15. Nay, I have shewed you where he flatly overthroweth all such hope. And will it do you any good for a Minister to give you hope, where God gives you none? or would you desire them to do so? Why, what would you think of such a Minister, when those hopes forsake you? or what thanks will you give him, when you finde your self in Hell? would you not there lye and curse him for a deceiver for ever? I know this to be true, and therefore I had rather you were displeased with me here, then curse me there. For my own part, if I had but one Sermon to preach while I lived, I think this should be it; to perswade down all your un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>grounded hopes of Heaven; not to leave you there in despair, but that you may hope upon better grounds which will never deceive you. God hath told us what we shall say, <hi>Isai.</hi> 3.10, 11. <hi>Say to the Righteous, It shall be well with him, and to the wicked, It shall be ill with him</hi> And if I shall say, it shall be well with thee, when God hath said, it shall be ill with thee, what the better were thou for this? Whose word would stand, think you, Gods or mine? O, little do carnall Ministers know what they do, who strengthen the hopes of ungodly men? They work as hard as they can against God, while they stand there to speak in the
<pb n="310" facs="tcp:61132:183"/>
name of God. God layeth his battery against these false hopes, as knowing that they must now down, or the sinner must perish: And these teachers build up what God is pulling down: I know not what they can do worse to destroy mens souls. There are false teachers in regard of application, though they are true in re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gard of doctrine. This is partly through their flattering men-pleasing temper, partly because they are guilty themselves, and so should destroy their own hopes, as well as others; and partly be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause being graceless, they want that experience which should help them to discern betwixt hope and hope. The same may be said of carnall friends. If they see a poor sinner but doubting whether all be well with him, and but troubled for fear least he be out of the way: What paines do they take to keep up his old hopes? What, say they, If you should not be saved, God help a great many: You have lived honestly, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> Never doubt, man; God is mercifull. — Alas silly creatures! You think you per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>form an office of friendship, and do him much good! Even as much as to give cold water to a man in a Feaver, you may ease him at the present, but it afterward inflames him. What thanks will he give you hereafter, if you settle him upon his former hopes again? Did you never read <hi>Prov.</hi> 24.24. <hi>He that saith to the wicked, Thou art righteous; him shall the people curse, Nations shall abhorre him.</hi> If you were faithful friends indeed, you should ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther say thus to him; Friend, if you perceive the soundness of your hopes for Heaven to be doubtful, O do not smother those doubts; but go and open them to your Minister, or some able friend; and try them throughly in time; and hold no more of them now, then will hold good at Judgment: It is better they break while they may be built more surely, then when the disco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>very will be your torment, but not your remedy. — This were friendly &amp; faithful counsel indeed. The Proverb is, If it were not for hope, the heart would break: And Scripture tels us, that the heart must break that Christ will save. How can it be bound up, till it be broken first? So that the hope which keeps their hearts from breaking, doth keep them also from healing and saving.</p>
                        <p>Well, if these unwise men (who are as we say, penny wise, and pound foolish, who are wise to keep off the smart of a short, con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ditional, necessary, curable despaire, but not wise to prevent an

eternal, absolute, tormenting, uncurable despair) do not change their condition speedily, these Hopes will leave them, which they would not leave; and then they that were now resolved to hold fast their Hopes, let all the Preachers in the world say what they would, shall let them go whether they will or no. Then let them hope for heaven if they can.</p>
                        <p>So that you see it will aggravate the misery of the damned, that with the loss of heaven, they shall lose all that hope of it, which now supporteth them.</p>

                        <p>THirdly, Another Additional loss will be this. They will lose-all that false peace of Conscience, which maketh their present life so easie.

Who would think now that sees how quietly the mul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>titude of the ungodly live, that they must very shortly lye roaring in everlasting flames? They lye down, and rise, and sleep as quiet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, they eat and drink as quietly; they go about their work as cheerfully, they talk as pleasantly as if nothing ailed them, or as if they were as far out of danger as an obedient Believer; like a man that hath the Falling-sickness, you would little think while he is labouring as strongly, and talking as heartily as another man, how he will presently fall down, and lye gasping, and foaming, and beating his brest in torment; So it is with these men: They are as free from the fears of Hell as others, as free from any vexing sorrows, not so much as troubled with any cares for the state of their souls, nor with any sad or serious thoughts of what shall be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come of them in another world; yea, and for the most part they have less doubts or disquiet of minde, then those who shall be sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved. O happy men, if it would be always thus! and if this peace would prove a lasting peace! But alas, there's the misery, it will not. They are now in their own Element, as the Fish in the water, but little knows that silly creature, when he is most fearlesly and delightfully swallowing down the Baite, how suddenly he shall be snatched out, and lye dead upon the Bank! And as little think these careless sinners, what a change they are near. The Sheep, or
<pb n="312" facs="tcp:61132:184"/>
the Ox is driven quietly to the slaughter, because he knows not whither he goes; if he knew it were to his death, you could not drive him so easily. How contented is the Swine, when the Butchers Knife is shaving his throat? little thinking that it is to prepare for his death. Why, it is even so with these sensual care<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>less men: they fear the mischief least, when they are nearest to it, because they feel it not, or see it not with their eyes: <hi>As in the dayes of</hi> Noah (saith Christ) <hi>they were eating and drinking,</hi>
                           <note place="margin">Matth. 24 37, 38 39.</note> 
                           <hi>marrying, and giving in marriage, till the day that</hi> Noah <hi>entered into the Ark, and knew not till the Flood came and took them all away</hi>; So will the coming of Christ be; and so will the coming of their particular judgment be: <hi>For</hi> (saith the Apostle) <hi>when they say peace and safety, then sudden destruction cometh upon them, as travel upon a woman with childe, and they shall not escape,</hi> 1 Thes. 5.3. O cruel Peace, which ends in such a War! Reader, If this be thy own case; if thou hast no other peace in thy Conscience then this ungrounded, self-created peace; I could heartily wish for thy own sake that thou wouldst cast it off. As I would not have any humble gratious soul to vex their own consciences needlesly, nor to dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quiet, and discompose their spirits by troubles of their own ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king, nor to unfit themselves for duty, nor interrupt their com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fortable communion with God, nor to weaken their bodies, or cast themselves into Melancholy distempers to the scandal of Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion: so would I not have a miserable wretch, who lives in daily and hourly danger of dropping into Hell, to be as merry and as quiet, as if all were well with him: It is both unseemly and un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>safe; more unseemly then to see a man go laughing to the Gallows; and more unsafe then to favor the Gangren'd member which must be cut off, or to be making merry when the enemy is entring our Habitations: Mens first peace is usually a false peace; it is a second peace which is brought into the soul upon the casting out of the first, which will stand good, and yet not alway that neither; for where the change is by the halves, the second or third peace may be unsound as well as the first: as many a man that casteth away the peace of his Prophaness, doth take up the peace of meer Civility and morality, or if he yet discover the unsoundness of that, and is cast into trouble, then he healeth all with outward Religiousness, or with a half Christianity, and there he taketh up with peace: This is but driving Satan out of one
<pb n="313" facs="tcp:61132:184"/>
room into another, but till he be cast out of possession, the peace is unsound. Hear what Christ saith, <hi>Luke</hi> 11.21.22. <hi>When a strong man armed keepeth his palace, his goods are in peace; but when a stronger then he shall come upon him, and overcome him, he taketh from him all his Armour wherein he trusted, and devideth his spoils.</hi> The soul of every man by nature is Satans Garrison; all is at peace in such a man, till Christ comes; when Christ storms this heart, he breaks the peace, he giveth it most terrible Alarms of Judgment and Hell, he battereth it with the Ordnance of his Threatnings and Terrors; he sets all in a combustion of Fear and Sorrow, till he have forced it to yield to his meer mercy, and take him for the Governor, and Satan is cast out; and then doth he establish a firm and lasting Peace. If therefore thou art yet but in that first peace, and thy heart was never yet either taken by storm, or delivered up freely to Jesus Christ, never think that thy peace will indure. Can the soul have peace which is at enmity with Christ, or stands out against him, or thinks his Government too severe, and his Conditions hard? Can he have peace against whom God proclaimeth war? I may say to thee, as <hi>Jehu</hi> to <hi>Joram,</hi> when he asked, <hi>Is it peace? What peace while the whordoms of thy mother</hi> Jezabel <hi>remain?</hi> So thou art desirous to hear nothing from the mouth of a Minister but peace; but what peace can there be till thou hast cast away thy wickedness, and thy first peace, and made thy peace with God through Christ? Wilt thou believe God him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>self in this Case? Why, read then what he saith twice over, <hi>Isai.</hi> 48.22. and 57.21. <hi>There is no peace, saith my God, to the wicked.</hi> And hath he said it? and shall it not stand? Sinner, Though thou maist now harden and fortifie thy heart against Fear, and Grief, and Trouble, yet as true as God is true, they will batter down thy proud and fortified spirit, and seize upon it, and drive thee to a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mazement: This will be done either here or hereafter. My coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sel therefore to thee is, that thou presently examine the grounds of thy peace, and say, I am now at ease and quiet in my minde; but is it grounded? and will it be lasting? Is the danger of eternal Judgment over? Am I sure my sins are pardoned, and my soul shall be saved? If not, alas, what cause of peace? I may be in hell before the next day for ought I know. —Certainly, a man that stands upon the Pinacle of a Steeple, or that sleeps on the top of the main Mast, or that is in the heat of the most bloody fight, hath
<pb n="314" facs="tcp:61132:185"/>
more cause of peace and carelesness then thou. Why, thou livest under the wrath of God continually, thou art already sentenced to eternal death, and maist every hour expect the execution, till thou have sued out a pardon through Christ. I can shew thee a hundred threatnings in Scripture which are yet in force against thee; but canst thou shew me one Promise for thy safety an hour? What as<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>surance hast thou when thou goest forth of thy doors, that thou shalt ever come in again? I should wonder, but that I know the desperate hardness of the heart of man, how a man that is not sure of his peace with God, could eat, or drink, or sleep, or live in peace! That thou art not afraid when thou liest down, lest thou shouldst awake in hell; or when thou risest up, lest thou shouldest be in hell before night; or when thou sittest in thy house, that thou still fearest not the approach of death, or some fearful Judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment seizing upon thee, and that the threats and sentence are not alwayes sounding in thy ears. Well, if thou were the nearest friend that I have in the world, in this case that thou art in, I could wish thee no greater good, then that God would break in upon thy careless heart, and shake thee out of thy false peace, and cast thee into trouble; that when thou feelest thy heart at ease, thou wouldest remember thy misery, that when thou art pleasing thy self with thy estate, or business, or labours, thou wouldest still re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>member the approaching wo; that thou wouldest cry out in the midst of thy pleasant discourse and merry company, <hi>O how neer is the great and dreadful change</hi>; that what ever thou art doing, God would make thee read thy sentence, as if it were still written be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore thine eyes: and which way soever thou goest, he would still meet thee full in the face with the sense of his wrath, as the Angel did <hi>Balaam</hi> with a drawn sword, till he had made thee cast away thy groundless peace, and lye down at the feet of Christ whom thou hast resisted, and say, Lord, what wouldest thou have me to do and so receive from him a surer and better peace, which will never be quite broken, but will be the beginning of thy ever<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lasting Peace, and not perish in thy perishing, as the groundless peace of the world will do.</p>

It made a great blaze and unseemly noise for a little while, but it was presently gone, and will return no more. They scorned to entertain any saddening thoughts; the talk of death and Judgment was irksome to them, because it dampt their mirth; they could not endure to think of their sin or danger, because these thoughts did sad their spirits: They knew not what it was to weep for sin; or to humble themselves under the mighty hand of God: They could laugh away sorrow, and sing away cares, and drive away these Melancholy thoughts: They thought, if they should live so austerely, and meditate, and pray, and mourn, as the godly do, their lives would be a continu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>all misery, and it were enough to make them run mad. Alas, poor souls! VVhat a misery then will that life be, where you shall have nothing but sorrow? Intense, heart-piercing, multiplied sorrow?

O what a fall will the proud ambitious man have, from the top of his honors! As his dust and bones will not be known from the dust and bones of the poorest beggar; so neither will his soul be honoured or favoured any more then theirs. VVhat a number of Right Honourable Lords, Right VVorshipful Kinghts and Gentlemen, Right Reverend Fathers and Learned Doctors are now shut out of the presence of Christ? If you say, How can I tell that? VVhy I answer, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause their judg hath told me so: Hath he not said by his Apostle, 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 1.26. That not many wise men after the flesh, not many mighty, not many noble are called? And if they be not called, they be not predestinate, or justified, or glorified. <hi>Rom.</hi> 8.30. Sure that rich man, <hi>Luk.</hi> 16. hath now no humble obeysance done him, nor titles of honor put upon him; nor do the poor now wait at his gates to receive of his scraps. They must be shut out of their wel-contrived houses, and sumptuous buildings; their comely Chambers, with costly hangings, their soft beds, and easie couches. They shall not finde there their gallant walks, their curious Gar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dens, with varity of beauteous odoriferous fruits and flowers; their rich Pastures and pleasant Meadows, and plenteous Harvest, and Flocks, and Herds. Their tables will not be so spread and fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nished, nor they so punctually attended and observed. They have not there variety of Dainty fare, now severall courses, nor tempt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing dishes, prepared to please their appetites to the full: the rich man there fareth not deliciously every day: Neither shall he wear there his purple and fine linnen: The jetting gorgeous well drest gallant, that must not have a pin amiss, that stands as a picture

set to sale, that take themselves more beholden to the Tailor or Semster for their comeliness, then to God, they shall then be quite in a different garb; There is no powdering or curling of the hair, nor eying of themselves, nor desirous expecting the admiration of beholders. Sure our voluptuous youths must leave their Cards and Dice behinde them; as also their Hawks, and Hounds, and Bowls, and all their former pleasant sports: They shall then spend their time in a more sad imployment, and not in such pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stimes as these. Where will then be your Maygames, and your Morrice daunces? your Stage Playes, and your Shewes? What mirth will you have in remembring all the Games, and Sports, and Dauncings which you had on the Lords Days, when you should have been delighting your selves in God and his work? O, what an alteration will our Joviall roaring swaggerers then finde? What bitter draughts they will have in stead of their Wine and Ale? If there were any drinking of healths, the Rich man would not have begged so hard for a drop of water: The heat of their lust will be then abated: They shall not spend their time in courting their Mistresses, in lascivious discourse, in amorous songs, in wanton dalliance, in their lustful embracements, or brutish de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>filements: Yet they are like enough to have each others company there; But they will have no more comfort in that company, then <hi>Zimri</hi> and <hi>Cosbi,</hi> in dying together; or then lewd companions have in being hanged together on the same Gallows: O the dole<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful meeting that these lustful wantons will have there? How it will even cut them to the heart to look each other in the face! And to remember that beastly pleasure for which they now must pay so dear! So will it be with the Fellowship of Drunkards, and all others that were play-fellows together in sin, who got not their pardon in the time of their lives: VVhat a direful greeting will there then be? Cursing the day that ever they saw the faces of one another! Remembring and ripping up all their lewdness, to the aggravation of their torment?

Come, as we have sinned together, let us pray together before we stir, that God would pardon us: And let us enter into a promise to one another, that we will do thus no more, but will meet toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther with the godly in the worship of God, and help one ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther toward Heaven, as oft as we have met for our sinfull metri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments, in helping to deceive and destroy each other.—This would be the way to prevent this sorrow, and a course that would comfort you when you look back upon it hereafter. VVho would spend so many dayes and yeers, and thoughts, and cares, and be at so much cost and pains, and all to please this flesh for a moment, which must shortly be most loathsome stinking rotten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness; and in the mean time neglect our pretious souls, and that state which we must trust to for ever and ever? To be at such pains for that pleasure which dyes in the enjoying, and is almost as soon gone as come, and when we have most need of comfort will be so far from following us as our happiness, that it will be perpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tual fuel to the flames which shall torment us! O that men knew but what they desire, when they would so fain have all things suited to the desires of the flesh! They would have Buildings, VValks, Lands, Cloathes, Diet, and all so fitted as may be most pleasing and delightful. VVhy, this is but to desire their tempta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions to be increased, and their snare strengthened: Their Joyes will be more carnall; and how great an enemy carnal Joy is to spiritual, experienced men can quickly tell you. If we took the flesh so much for your enemy as we do professe, we could not so earnestly desire, and contrive to accommodate it, and so congratu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>late all its contentments as we do.</p>

<pb n="320" facs="tcp:61132:188"/>
and that they will be exceeding great, may appear by these Argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments following.</p>
                        <p>First, From the principal Author of them, which is God him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>self: As it was no less then God whom the sinner had offended, so it is no less then God that will punish them for their offences. He hath prepared those torments for his Enemies; His continued Anger will still be devouring them; His Breath of Indignation will kindle the flames; His Wrath will be an intollerable burden to their souls. O, if it were but a creature that they had to do with, <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                              <desc>•</desc>
                           </gap>hey might better bear it, for the Penalty would be answerable to the Infirmity of him that should inflict it: A childe can give but an easie stroak, but the stroaks of a Gyant will be answerable to his strength: Wo to him that fals under the stroaks of the Al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mighty! They shall feel to their sorrow, That it is a fearful thing to fall into the hands of the living God: It were nothing in com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parison to this, if all the world were against them, or if the strength of all creatures were united in one to inflict their penalty. They had now rather venture upon the displeasure of God, then to displease a Landlord, a Master, a Friend, a Neighbour, or their own Flesh; but then they will wish a thousand times in vain, that they had lost the favor of all the world, and been hated of all men, so they had not lost the favor of God; for as there is no life like his Favor, so is there no death like his displeasure; O what a consum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing fire is his Wrath? If it be kindled here, and that but a little, how do we wither before it, as the grass that is cut down before the Sun? How soon doth our strength decay and turn to weakness? and our beauty to deformity? Churches are rooted up, Common<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wealths are overthrown, Kingdoms depopulated, Armies de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stroyed, and who can stand before his wrath? Even the Heavens and the Earth will melt at his Presence, and when he speaks the word at his great Day of Accompt, they will be burnt up before him as a scrole in the fire. The flames do not so easily run through the dry Stubble, or consume the Houses where its violence hath prevailed, as the wrath of God will feed upon these wretches. O, they that could not bear a Prison, or a Gibbet, or Fire for Christ, no nor scarce a few scorns from the mouths of the ignorant, how will they now bear the devouring fire?</p>

                        <p n="2">2. THe place or state of torment is purposely ordained for the glorifying of the Attribute of Gods Justice. As all the Works of God are great and wonderful, so those above all, which are specially intended for the eminent advancing of some of his Attributes: When he will glorifie his Power, he makes the worlds by his Wisdom: The comely order of all and singular creatures declare his Wisdom; His Providence is shewn in sustain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing all things, and maintaining Order, and attaining his excellent ends, amongst the confused, perverse, tumultuous agitations of a world of wicked, foolish, self-destroying Miscreants: When a spark of his Wrath doth kindle upon the earth, the whole world, save onely eight persons, are drowned; <hi>Sodom Gomorrah, Admah</hi> and <hi>Zeboim</hi> are burnt with fire from heaven to ashes; The sea shuts her mouth upon some; The earth doth open and swallow others; The Pestilence destroyeth them up by thousands: The present de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plorable estate of the <hi>Jews</hi> may fully testifie this to the world: And yet the glorifying of the two great Attributes, of Mercy and Justice, is intended most eminently for the life to come. As there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore when God will purposely then glorifie his Mercy, he will do it in a way and degree that is now incredible and beyond the comprehension of the Saints that must enjoy it; so that the blood of his Son, and the enjoyment of himself immediately in Glory shall not be thought too high an honor for them: So also, when the time comes that he will purposely manifest his Justice, it shall appear to be indeed the Justice of God: The everlasting flames of Hell will not be thought too hot for the Rebellious; and when they have there burned through millions of Ages, he will not re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pent him of the evil which is befaln them. O, wo to the soul that is thus set up for a Butt, for the wrath of the Almighty to shoot at! and for a Bush that must burn in the flames of his Jealousie, and never be consumed!</p>

                        <p n="3">3. THe torments of the damned must needs be extream, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause they are the effect of Divine Revenge: Wrath is terrible, but Revenge is implacable: When the great God shall

Then will he be reven<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ged for ever mercy abused, for his creatures consumed in luxury and excess; for every hours time mispent; for the neglect of his word, for the vilifying of his messengers, for the hating of his people, for the prophanation of his ordinances, and neglect of his worship, for the breaking of his Sabbaths, and the grieving of his Spirit, for the taking of his Name in vain, for unmerciful neg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lect of his servants in distress. O the numberless bils that will be brought in! And the charge that will overcharge the soul of the sinner! And how hotly Revenge will pursue them all to the highest!

Though he had rather men would stoop to Christ and accept of his mercy, yet when they persist in rebellion, he will take pleasure in their execution. Though he desire not the death of him that dyeth, but rather that he repent and live; yet when he will not repent and live, God doth desire and delight in the execution of Justice:<note place="margin">How this is to be understood, reade in my <hi>Treatise of Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demption.</hi>

words, Who would set the bryers and thorns against me in battel? I would go through them, I would burn them together. What a dole<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful case is the wretched creature in, when he shall thus set the heart of his Creator against him? and he that made him will not save him, and he that formed him will not have mercy upon him, <hi>Isai.</hi> 27.11. How heavy a threatning is that in <hi>Deut.</hi> 28.63. As the Lord Rejoyced over you to do you good, so the Lord will Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>joyce over you to destroy you, and to bring you to nought. Wo to the soul which God Rejoyceth to punish. Yea, he tels the simple ones that love simplicity, and the scorners that delight in scorning, and the fools that hate knowledg, That because he called and they refused, he stretched out his hand and no man re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>garded, but set at nought all his counsel, and would none of his reproof, therefore he will also laugh at their calamity, and mock when their fear cometh; when their fear cometh as desolation, and their destruction as a whirlwind, when distress and anguish cometh upon them, Then shall they call upon him, but he will not answer, they shall seek him early, but shall not finde him; for that they hated knowledg, and did not choose the fear of the Lord, <hi>Prov.</hi> 1.22, 23, 24, 25, 26, 27, 28, 29. I would intreat thee, who readest this, if thou be one of that sort of men, that thou wilt but view over seriously that part of the Chapter, <hi>Prov.</hi> 1. from the 20. <hi>verse</hi> to the end, and believe them to be the true words of Christ by his Spirit in <hi>Solomon:</hi> Is it not a terrible thing to a wretched soul, when it shall lie roaring perpetually in the flames of Hell, and the God of mercy himself shall laugh at them? When they shall cry out for mercy, yea, for one drop of water, and God shall mock them in stead of relieving them? When none in Heaven or earth can help them but God, &amp; he shall rejoyce over them in their calamity? why, you see these are the very words of God himself in Scripture: And most just is it, that they who laughed at the Sermon, and mocked at the Preacher, and derided the people that obeyed the Gospel, should be laughed at, and derided by God. Ah poor ignorant Fools, (for so this Text cals them) they will then have mocking enough,<note place="margin">So also Psal. 37.13.</note> till their heart ake with it! I dare warrant them them for ever making a jeast of Godliness more, or making them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves merry with their own slanderous reports. It is themselves then that must be the woful objects of derision, and that of God himself, who would have crowned them with glory. I know when

First, He that was here so successful in drawing them from Christ, will then be the Instrument of their punishment, for yielding to his temptations. It was a pittiful sight to see the man possessed, that was bound with chains, and lived among the Tombs; and that other that would be cast into the fire, and into the water: but alas, that was nothing to the torment that Satan puts them to in Hel: That is the reward he wil give them for all their service; for their rejecting the commands of God, and forsaking Christ, and neglecting their souls at his perswasion. Ah, if they had served Christ as faithfully as they did Satan, and had forsaken all for the love of him, he would have given them a better reward. Secondly, and it is most just also, that they should there be their own tormentors, that they may see that their whole destruction is of themselves; and they who were wil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fully the meritorious cause, should also be the efficient in their own sufferings; and then who can they complain of but themselves? and they will be no more able to cease their self-tormenting, then men that we see in a deep Melancholy, that will by no Arguments be taken off from their sorrows.</p>

COnsider also how that their torment will be universal, not upon one part alone, while the rest are free, but as all have joyned in the sin, so must they all partake of the torment. The soul, as it was the chief in sinning, shall be chief in suffering; and as it is of a more spiritual and excellent nature then bodies are, so will its torments as far exceed our present bodily sufferings. As the joys of the soul do far surpass all sensual pleasures, and corporal contentments, so do the pains of the soul surpass these corporal
<pb n="325" facs="tcp:61132:190"/>
pains; and as the Martyrs did triumph in the very flames, because their souls were ful of joy, though their bodies were in pain; so though these damned creatures could enjoy all their bodily pleasures, yet the souls sufferings would take away the sweetness of them all.</p>
                        <p>And it is not onely a soul, but a sinful soul that must suffer; The guilt which still remains upon it, will make it fit for the wrath of God to work upon; as fire will not burn except the fuel be combu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stible, but if the wood be dry, or it light upon Straw, how fiercely will it burn them? Why, the guilt of all their former sins will be as Tinder or Gunpowder to the damned soul, to make the flames of hell to take hold upon them with fury.</p>
                        <p>And as the soul, so also the body must bear its part; that body that must needs be pleased whatsoever became of its eternal safety, shall new be paid for all its unlawful pleasures: That body which was so carefully looked to, so tenderly cherished, so curiously drest; that body which could not endure heat, or cold, or an ill smell, or a loath<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>some sight; O what must it now endure! How are its haughty looks now taken down! How little will those flames regard its comliness and beauty! But as Death did not regard it, nor the Worms regard it, but as freely feed upon the face of the proud and lustful Dames, and the heart of the most ambitious Lords or Princes, as if they had bin but beggers or bruits; so wil their tormentors then as little pitty their ten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derness, or reverence their Lordliness, when they shall be raised from their graves to their eternal doom.

In this life when a Minister foretold them of Hel, or Conscience begun to trouble their peace, they had Comforters enough at hand to relieve them<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> Their carnal friends were all ready to speak comfort to them, and promise them that all should be well with them, but now they have not a word of comfort, either for him or themselves. Formerly they had their business, their company, their mirth, to drive away their fears, they could drink away their sorrows, or play them away, or sleep them away, or at least time did wear them away; but now all these remedies are vanished: They had a hard, a presumptuous, un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>believing heart, which was a wall to defend them against troubles of minde, but now their experience hath banished these, and left them naked to the fury of those flames: Yea, formerly Satan himself was their comforter<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> and would unsay all that the Minister said against them, as he did to our first Mother; Hath God said, Ye shall not eat? Yea shall not surely dye. So doth he now, Doth God tell you that you shall lye in Hell It is no such matter, God is more merciful, he doth but tell you so to fright you from sinning: Who would lose his present pleasures, for fear of that which he never saw? Or if there be a hell, what need you to fear it? Are not you Christians? And shall you not be saved by Christ? was not his blood shed for you? Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nisters may tell you what they please, they delight to fear men, that they may be masters in their Consciences, and therefore would make men believe that they shall all be damned, except they will fit themselves to their precise humor. —Thus as the Spirit of Christ is the Comforter of the Saints, so Satan is the Comforter of the wicked, for he knows if he should now disquiet them, they would no longer serve him; or if fears and doubts should begin to trouble them, they would bethink themselves of their danger, and so escape it: never was a theif more careful lest he should awake the people when he is robbing the house, then Satan is careful not to awake a sinner: And as a cutpurse will look you in the face, and hold you in a tale,
<pb n="327" facs="tcp:61132:191"/>
that you may never suspect him while he is robbing your pockets, so will Satan labour to keep men from all doubts or jealousies or sor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rowfull thoughts. But when the sinner is dead, and he hath his prey, and his stratagem hath had success, then he hath done flattering and comforting them: VVhile the sight of sin and misery might have helped to save them, he took all the pains he could to hide it from their eyes: but when it is too late, and there is no hope left, he will make them see and feel it to the utmost. O, which way will the forlorn sinner then look for comfort? They that drew him into the snare and promised him safety, do now forsake him, and are forsaken them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves. His ancient comforts are taken from him, and the righteous God, whose forewarnings he made light of, will now make good his word against him to the least tittle.</p>

If thou believe not these, I have nothing here to do with thee, but refer thee to the second part of this book, where I have proved Scripture to be the word of God. But if thou do believe this to be so, and yet dost not believe that the same Scripture is true, thou art far worse then either Infidel or Pagan: For the vilest Pagans durst hardly charge their Idol Gods to be lyars: And darest thou give the lye to the God of Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven?

But if thou darest not stand to this, but dost believe Scripture both to be the word of God, and to be true; then I shall presently convince thee of the truth of these eternall Torments.

Why take it then from <hi>Paul,</hi> 2 <hi>Thess.</hi> 1.7, 8, 9. <hi>The Lord Jesus shall be revealed from Heaven, with his mighty Angels, in flaming fire, taking vengeance on them that know not God, and that obey not the Gospel of our Lord Jesus Christ, who shall be punished with everlasting destruction from the presence of the Lord, and from the glory of his power.</hi> And 2 <hi>Thess.</hi> 2.12. <hi>That they all might be damned, who believed not the truth, but had pleasure in un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>righteousness.</hi> So <hi>Rom.</hi> 2.5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10.

As therefore the Tares are gathered and burnt in the fire, so shall it be in the end of this world: the Son of man shall send forth his Angels, and they shall gather out of his Kingdom all things that offend, and them which do iniquity; and shall cast them into a furnace of fire; there shall be weeping and gnashing of teeth, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> So <hi>Mat.</hi> 18.8, 9.

                        <p>What sayest thou now to all this? Wilt thou not yet believe? If thou wilt not believe Christ, I know not whom thou wilt believe: and therefore it is in vain to perswade thee any further: Only let me tell thee the time is at hand when thou wilt easily believe, and that with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out any preaching or arguing: when thou seest the great and terrible day, and hearest the condemning sentence past, and art thy self thrust down to Hell (as <hi>Luk.</hi> 10.15.) then thou shalt believe, and never doubt again: And do not say but thou wast told so much. Surely he that so much disswades thee from believing, doth yet believe and tremble himself. <hi>Jam.</hi> 2.19.</p>
                        <p>And whereas thou thinkest that God is more merciful; why sure he knowes best his own mercifulness. His mercy will not cross his Truth. Cannot God be infinite in mercy, except he save the wilful and rebellious? Is a judg unmerciful for condemning malefactors? Mercy and Justice have their several objects: Thousands of humble, believing, obedient souls shall know to their eternall comfort that God is merciful, though the refusers of his grace, shall lye under Justice. God will then force thy conscience to confess in Hell, that God who condemned thee was yet merciful to thee. Was it no mercy to be made a reasonable creature? And to have Patience en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dure thy many yeers provocations, and wait upon thee from Sermon to Sermon, desiring and intreating thy repentance and return? Was it no mercy to have the Son of God, with all his blood and merits freely offered thee, if thou wouldest but have accepted him to go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vern and to save thee? Nay when thou hadst neglected and refused Christ once, twice, yea a hundred times, that God should yet follow thee with invitations from day to day? And shalt thou wilfully re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fuse
<pb n="331" facs="tcp:61132:193"/>
mercy to the last hour, and then cry out that God will not be so unmercifull as to condemn thee? Thy conscience will smite thee for this madness, and tell thee, that God was merciful in all this, though such as thou do perish for your wilfulness. Yea the sense of the great<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness of his mercy, will then be a great part of thy torment.</p>
                        <p>And whereas thou thinkest the pain to be greater then the offence, that is because thou art not a competent Judg; Thou knowest what pain is, but thou knowest not the thousand part of the evil of sin; shall not the righteous Judg of the world do justly? Nay, it is no more then thou didst chuse thy self: Did not God set before thee Life and Death? and tell thee, If thou wouldest accept of the Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernment of Christ, and renounce thy Lusts, that then thou shouldest have eternal Life? And if thou wouldest not have Christ<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> but the World or Flesh to rule over thee, thou shouldest then endure eter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal torments? Did not he offer thee thy choice? and bid thee take which of these thou wouldest? yea, and intreat thee to chuse aright? And dost thou now cry out of Severity, when thou hast but the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sequents of thy wilful choice? But it is not thy accusing God of cru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>elty that shall serve thy turn; in stead of procuring thy escape, or the mitigation of thy torments, it will but make thy burthen the more heavy.</p>
                        <p>And whereas thou saist that thou wouldest not so torment thy own enemy; I <hi>Answ.</hi> There is no Reason that thou shouldest: For is it all one to offend a crawling Worm of the earth, and to offend the eternal glorious God? Thou hast no absolute dominion over thine enemy, and there may be some fault in thy self as well as in him, but with God and us the case is contrary: Yet thou makest nothing of killing a Flea if it do but bite thee, yea a hundred of them though they did not touch thee, and yet never accusest thy self of cruelty: Yea, thou wilt torment thy Ox all his life time with toilsome labor, and kill him at the last, though he never deserved ill of thee, nor dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>obeyed thee &amp; though thou hast over him but the borrowed authori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty of a superiour fellow creature, and not the soveraign power of the absolute Creator: Yea, How commonly dost thou take away the lives of Birds and Beasts and Fishes? Many times a great many of lives must be taken away to make for thee but one meal? How many deaths then have been suffered in obedience to thy will from thy first Age to thy last hour? and all this without any desert of the creature? And must it yet seem cruelty, that the Soveraign Creator, who is ten

                        <p>BUt methinks I perceive the obstinate sinner desperately resolving, If I must be damned, there is no remedy, rather then I will live so precisely as the Scripture requireth, I will put it to the venture, I shall scape as well as the rest of my neighbours, and as the most of the world, and we will even bear it as well as we can.— <hi>Answ.</hi> Alas, poor creature! would thou didst but know what it is that thou dost so boldly venture on: I dare say thou wouldest sleep this night but very unquietly. Wilt thou leave thy self no room for Hope? Art thou such a malicious implacable enemy to Christ and thy own soul? And dost thou think indeed, that thou canst bear the wrath of God? and go away so easily with these eternal Torments? Yet let me beg this of thee, that before thou dost so flatly resolve, thou wouldest lend me thine attention to these few Questions which I shall put to thee, and weigh them with the reason of a man, and if then thou think thou canst bear these pains, I shall give thee over and say no more.</p>
                        <p n="1">1. Who art thou, that thou shouldest bear the wrath of God? Art thou a God? or art thou a man? what is thy strength to under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>go so much? Is it not as the strength of Wax or Stubble to resist the Fire? or as Chaffe to the Winde? or as the Dust before the fierce Whirlwinde? Was he not as stout a man as thy self, who cryed to God, <hi>Job</hi> 13.25 <hi>Wilt thou break a leaf driven to and fro? and wilt thou pursue the dry stubble?</hi> and he that confesseth, <hi>I am a worm and no man,</hi> Psal 22.6. If thy strength were as iron, and thy bones as brass, thou couldest not bear; If thy foundation were as the Earth, and thy power as the Heavens, yet shouldest thou perish at the breath of his Indignation: How much more when thou art but a little piece of warm, creeping, breathing Clay, kept a few days from stinking<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> and from being eaten with Worms, by the meer support and favor of him whom thou thus resistest?</p>
                        <p n="2">2. If thou art able to wrastle with the indignation of the Almighty,<note place="margin">Reade Ps. 77.18. Exod. 9.28.</note> why then dost thou tremble at the signs of his Power, or Wrath? Do not the terrible Thunder-claps sometime fear thee? or the Lightning flashes? or that unseen Power which goes with it,
<pb n="333" facs="tcp:61132:194" rendition="simple:additions"/>
in renting in pieces the mighty Oakes, and tearing down the strong<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>est buildings? If thou hadst been in the Church of <hi>Withicombe</hi> in De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vonshire, when the lightning broke in, and scorched and burnt the peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple, and left the brains and haire upon the pillars, would it not have made thee afraid? If thou be but in a place where the plague doth rage, so that it comes to so many thousand a week, doth it not astonish thee to see men that were well within a few dayes to be thrown into the graves by heaps and multitudes? If thou hadst stood by when <hi>Pha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>roah</hi> and his people were so strangely plagued, and at last drowned to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether in the Sea, or when the earth swallowed up <hi>Dathan, Abiram</hi> and their companies, and the people fled away at the cry, lest the earth should swallow them up also: or when <hi>Elias</hi> brought fire from Heaven to consume the Captains and their compaines; would not any of these sights have daunted thy spirit? Why, how then canst thou bear the hellish plagues?</p>
                        <p>Thirdly, Tell me also, if thou be so strong, and thy heart so stout, why do those small sufferings so dismay thee which befal thee here? If thou have but a tooth ake, or a fit of the gout, or stone, what groans dost thou utter? What moan dost thou make? The house is filled with thy constant complaints: Thy friends about thee are grieved at thy pains, and stand over thee condoling thy miserable state: If thou shouldest but lose a leg or an arm, thou wouldest make a greater matter of it; If thou lose but a friend, if thou lose thine estate, and fall into poverty, and beggery, and disgrace, how heavily wouldest thou bear any one of these: And yet all these laid together will be one day accounted a happy state, in comparison of that which is suffered in Hel. Let me see thee shake off the most painful sickness, and make as light of Convulsive, Epileptick, Arthritick, Nephritick pains, or such like diseases when they selfe upon thee, and then the strength of thy spirit will appear. Alas, how many such boasters as thy self, have I seen made stoop and eat their words? And when God hath but let out a little of his wrath<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> that <hi>Pharaoh</hi> who before asked, Who is the Lord, that I should let all go for him? have turned their tune, and cryed, I have sinned.</p>
                        <p>Fourthly, If thy stout spirit do make so light of hel, why then doth the approach of death so much affright thee? Didst thou never finde the sober thoughts of death to raise a kind of dread in thy mind? VVast thou never in a feaver, or a consumption, or any disease wherein thou didst receive the sentence of death? If thou wast not, thou wilt be be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
<pb n="334" facs="tcp:61132:195"/>
long: and then when the Physitian hath plainly told thee that there is no hopes, O how cold it strikes to thy heart? VVhy is death to men the King of terrors else? and the stoutest champions then do abate their courage? O but the grave would be accounted a palace or a Paradise, in comparison of that place of Torment which thou desperately slightest.</p>
                        <p n="5">5. If all this be nothing, go try thy strength by some corporall torment: As <hi>Bilney</hi> before he went to the stake, would first try his finger in the candle: so do thou; Hold thy finger a while in the fire, and feel there whether thou canst endure the fire of Hell: <hi>Austin</hi> men<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                              <desc>•</desc>
                           </gap>tioneth a chast Christian woman who being tempted to uncleanness by a lewd Ruffian, she desireth him for her sake to hold his finger an hour in the fire; he answereth, It is an unreasonable request; How much more unreasonable is it (saith she) that I should burn in Hell for the satisfying of your lust? Lo say I to thee: If it be an intoller<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able thing to suffer the heat of the fire for a yeer, or a day, or an hour, what will it be to suffer ten thousand times more for ever? VVhat if thou were to suffer <hi>Lawrence</hi> his death, to be rosted upon a Grid<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iron? or to be scraped or pricked to death as other Martyrs were? Or if thou were to feed upon toads for a yeer together? If thou couldest not endure such things as these, how wilt thou endure the e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eternal flames?</p>
                        <p n="6">6. Tell me yet again, if Hell be so small a matter, why canst thou not endure so much as the thoughts or the mention of it? If thou be alone, thou darest scarcely think of Hel, for fear of raising disquietness in thy spirit: If thou bein company, thou canst not endure to have any serious speech of it, lest it spoile the sport and mar the mirth, and make thee tremble as <hi>Faelix</hi> did when <hi>Paul</hi> was discoursing of the Judgement to come. Thou canst not endure to hear a Minister preach of Hell, but thou gnashest thy teeth; and disdainest him, and reproachest his Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon, as enough to drive men to desperation or make them mad. And canst thou endure the Torments, when thou canst not endure so much as to hear of them? Alas, man, to hear thy Judgment from the mouth of Christ, and to feel the execution, will be another kinde of matter them to hear it from a Minister.</p>
                        <p n="7">7. Furthermore, what is the matter that the rich man in Hell men<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tioned in, <hi>Luk.</hi> 16. could not make as light of it as thou dost? VVas not he as likely a man to bear it as thy self? VVhy doth he so cry out that he is tormented in the flames? and stoop so low as to beg a
<pb n="335" facs="tcp:61132:195"/>
drop of water of a beggar that he had but a little before despised at his gates? and to be beholden to him that had been beholden to the dogs to lick his sores?</p>
                        <p n="8">8. Also what aileth thy companions who were as resolute as thy self, that when they lye a dying their courage is so cooled, and their haughty expressions are so greatly changed? They who had the same spirits and language as thou hast now, and made as light of all the threats of the word, yet when they see they are going into another world, how pale do they look? how faintly do they speak? how dole<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fully do they complain and groan? They send for the Minister then, whom they despised before, and desire to be prayed for, and would be glad to dye in the state of those, whom they would not be perswad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed to imitate in their lives. Except it be here and there a desperate wretch, who is given over to a more then Hellish hardness of heart. VVhy cannot these make as light of it as thou?</p>
                        <p n="9">9. Yet further, if thou be so fearless of that eternall misery, why is the least foretast of it so terrible? Didst thou never feel such a thing as a tormenting conscience? If thou hast not, thou shalt do. Didst thou never see and speak with a man that lived in desparation? or in some degree of these wounds of spirit, that was neer despair? How uncomfortable was their conference? How burdensome their lives? Nothing doth them good which they possesse; The sight of friends, or house, or goods which refresh others, is a trouble to them: They feel no sweetness in meat or drink: They are weary of life, and fearful of death: VVhat is the matter with these men? If the Misery of the damned it self can be endured, why cannot they more easily endure these little sparks?</p>
                        <p n="10">10. Again, tell me faithfully; VVhat if thou shouldest but see the Devil appear to thee in some terrible shape? VVould it not daunt thee? VVhat if thou shouldest meet him in thy way home? Or he should shew himself to the at night in thy bed-chamber? would not thy heart faile thee? and thy hair stand an end? I could name thee those that have been as confident as thy self, who by such a sight have been so appaled, that they were in danger of being driven out of their wits. Or what if some damned soul of thy former acquaintance should appear to thee in some bodily likeness? Would not this amaze thee? What fears do people live in, whose houses or persons have been but haunted with spirits? Though they have only heard some noises, and seen some sights, but never felt any hurt upon their
<pb n="336" facs="tcp:61132:196" rendition="simple:additions"/>
bodies? Alas, what is this to the Torments of Hell? Canst thou not endure a shadow to appear before thee? O how wilt thou endure to live with them for ever? Where thou shalt have no other company but Devils and the damned; and shalt not only see them but be tor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mented with them, and by them? And as incredible a matter as this seems to thee<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> if thy through conversion prevent it not, thou knowest not how few months thou shalt be out of this estate.</p>
                        <p n="11">11. Lastly, Let me ask thee one more Question: If the wrath of God be to be made so light of, as thou dost; Why did the Son of God himself make so great a matter of it? When he who was per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fectly innocent himself, had taken upon him the payment of our debt, and stood in our room<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> and bore that punishment that we had deserved, it makes him sweat forth water and blood, it makes the Lord of Life to cry, My soul is heavy, even to the death: It makes him cry out upon the cross, <hi>My God, my God Why hast thou forsaken me:</hi> Surely if any one could have born these sufferings easily, it would have been Jesus Christ: He had another measure of strength to bear it then thou hast.</p>
                        <p>And let me tell thee one thing, which every one understandeth not: Thou wilt have sins of a more hainous nature and degree to suffer for, then ever were laid upon Jesus Christ, and consequently a punishment of a sorer degree? <note n="*" place="margin">See this proved in my <hi>Apho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rismes of Justificat.</hi>
                           </note> For Christ suffered only for the breaches of the Covenant of workes, and not for the violation of the Covenant of grace (properly so called, that is, not for the final non-performance of the conditions of this Covenant,) There was no mans final unbelief or impenitencie, or resisting the Spirit, that did lye up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on Christ: Howsoever the aggregation of all mens sins might aggra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vate his burden, yet the punishment due to those sins particularly, was not like the punishment which is due to thine: For as the first Cove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant gave not so great a reward, so neither did it threaten so great a penalty as the later doth: And the penalty which the new Cove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant threateneth, Christ never underwent. So that the punishment which thou must suffer, is that which the Apostle speaks of <hi>Heb.</hi> 10.26. Of how much sorer punishment, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> and that fearful look<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing for of Judgment, and fire which devoureth the adversaries, <hi>Heb.</hi> 6.8. Wo to poor sinners for their mad security! Do they think to finde it tolerable to them, which was so heavy to Christ? Nay, the Son of God is cast into a bitter agony, and bloody sweat, and do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lorous complaints, under the curse of the law alone<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> and yet the
<pb n="337" facs="tcp:61132:196"/>
feeble foolish creature makes nothing to bear also the curse of the Gospel! the good Lord bring these men to their right minds by Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pentance, lest they buy their wit at too dear a rate.</p>

                        <p>ANd thus I have shewed you somewhat of their misery, who miss of this Rest prepared for the Saints. And now Reader, I demand thy resolution, what use thou wilt make of all this? Shall it all be lost to thee? or wilt thou as thou art alone consider of it in good earnest? Thou hast cast by many a warning of God, wilt thou do so by this also? Take heed what thou dost, and how thou so re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>solvest; God will not alwayes stand warning and threatning; The hand of revenge is lifted up; the blow is coming, and wo to him who<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever he be on whom it lighteth; Little thinkest thou how neer thou standest to thy eternal state, and how neer the Pit thou art dancing in thy greatest jollity; if thy eyes were but opened, as they will be shortly, thou wouldest see all this that I have spoken before thine eyes without stirring from the place (I think) in which thou standest. Dost thou throw by the Book, and say, It speaks of nothing but Hell and Damnation? Thus thou usest also to complain of the Minister; but wouldst thou not have us to tell thee of these things? should we be guilty of the blood of thy soul, by keeping silent that which God hath charged us upon pain of death to make known<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> wouldst thou perish in ease and silence? and also have us to perish with thee, rather then to awake thee, or displease thee by speaking the truth? If thou wilt be guilty of such inhumane cruelty, yet God forbid we should be guilty of such most sottish folly! There are few Preachers so simple, but they know that this kinde of Preaching is the ready way to be hated of their Hearers: And the desire of applause, and the favor of men is so natural to all men, that I think there is few that delight in such a displeasing way: Our temptations to flattery and Man-plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sing are too strong for that. But I beseech the consider; Are these things true, or are they not? If they were not true, I would heartily joyn with thee against any Minister that should offer to Preach them, and to affright poor people when there is no cause; and I should think such Preachers did deserve Death or Banishment: But if every word of these threatnings be the words of God, and if they be as true as thou livest and readest this, what a wretch art thou that
<pb n="338" facs="tcp:61132:197"/>
wouldest not hear it, or consider it? Why, what is the matter? If thou be sure that thou art one of the People of God, this Doctrine will be a comfort to thee and not a terror; but if thou be yet carnal and unregenerate, methinks thou shouldest be as fraid to hear of Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven as of Hell, except the bare name of Heaven or Salvation be suffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cient; sure there is no Doctrine concerning heaven in all the Scripture, that can give thee any comfort but upon the supposal of thy conver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sion. What comfort is it to thee to hear that there is a Rest remain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing for the people of God, except thou be one of them? Nay, what more terrible then to read of Christ and Salvation for others, when thou must be shut out? Therefore except thou wouldest have a Mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ster to preach a lye, it is all one to thee for any comfort thou hast in it, whether he Preach Heaven or Hell to thee: His Preaching Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven, and Mercy to thee, can be nothing else but to intreat thee to seek them, and not neglect or reject them, but he can make thee no promise of it, but upon the condition of thy obeying the Gospel; and his preaching Hell<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> is but to perswade thee to avoid it: And is not this Doctrine fit for thee to hear? Indeed if thou were quite past hope of escaping it, then it were in vaine to tell thee of hell, but ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther let thee take a few merry hours whilst thou maist; but as long as thou art alive there is some hope of thy recovery, and therefore all means must be used to awake thee from thy Lethargy. O that some <hi>Jonas</hi> had this Point in hand to cry in your ears [Yet a few days, and the Rebellious shall be destroyed] till you were brought down on your knees in sackcloth and in ashes! Or if some <hi>John</hi> Baptist might cry it abroad, <hi>Now is the Ax laid to the root of the Tree, every tree that bringeth not forth good fruit, is hewen down and cast into the fire</hi>; O that some son of Thunder, who could speak as <hi>Paul,</hi> till the Hearers tremble, were now to Preach this Doctrine to thee! Alas, as terribly as you think I speak, yet is it not the thousand part of what must be felt; for what heart can now possibly conceive, or what tongue can ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>press the dolours of those souls that are under the wrath of God? Ah, that ever blinde sinners should wilfully bring themselves to such unspeakable misery! You will then be crying to Jesus Christ, O mercy! O pitty<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> pitty, on a poor soul,! Why, I do now in the name of the Lord Jesus cry to thee; O have mercy, have pitty, man, upon thine own soul; shall God pitty thee who wilt not be intreated to pitty thy self? If thy horse see but a pit before him, thou canst scarce<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly force him in; <hi>Balaams</hi> Ass would not be driven upon the drawn
<pb n="339" facs="tcp:61132:197"/>
Sword, and wilt thou so obstinately cast thy self into hell, when the danger is foretold thee? <hi>O who can stand before the Lord, and who can abide the fierceness of his anger</hi>? Nah. 1.6. Methinks thou shouldest need no more words, but presently cast away thy soul-damning sins, and wholly deliver up thy self to Christ. Resolve on it immediately, man, and let it be done, that I may see thy face in Rest among the Saints. The Lord perswade thy heart to strike this Covenant without any longer delay: but if thou be hardened unto death, and there be no remedy, yet do not say another day, but that thou wast faithfully warned, and that thou hadst a friend that would fain have prevented thy damnation.</p>

If there be so certain and glorious a Rest for the Saints, why is there no more industrious seeking after it in the world? One would think that a man that did but once hear of such unspeakable glory to be obtained, and did believe what he heareth, to be true, should be transported with the vehe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mency of his desires after it, and should almost forget to eat or drink, and should minde and care for nothing else, and speak of, and enquire after nothing else, but how to get assu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rance and possession of this Treasure! and yet people who hear of it daily, and profess to believe it undoubtedly as a fundamental Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticle of their Faith, do as little minde it, or care, or labour for it, and as much forget and disregard it, as if they had never heard of any such
<pb n="340" facs="tcp:61132:198"/>
thing, or did not believe one word that they hear; And as a man that comes into <hi>America,</hi> and sees the Natives regard more a piece of Glass, or an old Knife, then a piece of Gold, may think, sure these people never heard of the worth of Gold, or else they would not exchange it for toyes: so a man that looked onely upon the lives of most men, and did not hear their contrary confessions, would think, either these men never heard of Heaven, or els they never heard of its excellency and glory; when alas, they hear of it till they are weary of hearing; and it is offered to them so commonly, that they are tired with the tidings, and cry out as the <hi>Israelites,</hi> Numb. 11.6. <hi>Our soul is dried away, because there is nothing but this Manna before our eyes</hi>: And as the <hi>Indians</hi> who live among the golden Mynes do little re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gard it, but are weary of the daily toyl of getting it, when other Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions will compass the world, and venture their lives, and sayl through storms and waves to get it: So we that live where the Gospel grow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth, where heaven is urged upon us at our doors, and the Manna falls about our tents, do little regard it, and wish these Mynes of gold were further from us, that we might not be put upon the toyl of get<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting it, when some that want it, would be glad of it upon harder tearms: Surely, though the Resurrection of the Body and Life ever<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lasting be the last Article in their Creed, it is not the least, nor there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore put last, that it should be last in their desires and endeavors.</p>

And may we not say with more reason to them? May not a man have a little Air, or Earth? a little credit or wealth without so much ado? or at least, may not a man have enough to bring him to his grave without so much ado? O how early do they rowse up their servants to their labour? up, come away to work, we have this to do, or that to do; but how seldom do they call them, Up, you have your souls to look to, you have Everlasting to provide for, up to prayer, to reading of the Scripture; Alas, how rare is this language! what a gad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding up and down the world is here, like a company of Ants upon a Hillock? taking uncessant pains to gather a treasure, which death, as the next passenger that comes by, will spurn abroad? as if it were such an excellent thing, to dye in the midst of wealth and honors! or as if it would be such a comfort to a man at death, or in another world, to think that he was a Lord, or a Knight, or a Gentleman, or a Rich man on earth?

or say to the contrary, I cannot but strongly suspect that in heart they are flat Pagans, and do not believe that there is an eternal glory and misery, nor what the Scripture speaks of the way of ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taining it; or at least, that they do but a little believe it, by the halves, and therefore think to make sure of Earth, lest there be no such thing as Heaven to be had; and to hold fast that which they have in hand, lest if they let go that, in hope of better in another world, they should play the fools and lose all. — I fear, though the Christian Faith be in their mouths, lest that this be the faith which is next their hearts; or else the lust of their Senses doth overcome and suspend their Reason, and prevail with their Wils against the last practical conclusion of their Understanding.

The common entrance into it is through anguish and sorrow: The passage through it is with continual care, and labor, and grief; the passage out of it is with the greatest sharpness and sadness of all. What then doth cause men so much to follow &amp; affect it? O sinful, unreasonable, bewitched men! Will mirth and pleasure stick close to you?

Yea though they are convinced that these duties are commanded by God, and see it before their eyes in the Scripture, yet wil they not be brought to the constant practice of them. If they have the Gospel preached in the town where they dwell, it may be they will give the hearing to it one part of the day, and stay at home the other: or if the master come to the congregation, yet part of his family must stay at home. If they want the plain and powerful preaching of the Gospel, how few are there in a whole Town that will either be at cost or pains to procure a Minister; or travell a mile or two to hear abroad? Though they will go many miles to the market for provision for their bodies. The Queen of the South shall rise up in Judgment with this generation, and condemn them: for she came from the uttermost parts of the earth, to hear the wisdom of <hi>Solomon</hi>; and behold a greater then <hi>Solomon</hi> doth by his messengers preach to them. The King of <hi>Nineve</hi> shall rise up in Judgment with them, and shall condemn them; for he repented at the preaching of <hi>Jonas,</hi> but when Jesus Christ sendeth his Embassa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dors to these men, they will sarce go to hear them, <hi>Mat.</hi> 12.41, 42. And though they know that the Scripture is the very Law of God, by which they must live, and by which they must be acquit or condemned in Judgment, and that it is the property of every blessed man, to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>light in this law, and to meditate in it day and night, <hi>Psal.</hi> 1.2. Yet will they not be at the pains to read a chapter once in a day, nor to acquaint their families with this doctrine of Salvation: But if they
<pb facs="tcp:61132:200"/>
carry a Bible to Church and let it lye by them all the week, this is the most use that they make of it. And though they are commanded, to pray without ceasing. 1 <hi>Thes.</hi> 5.17. And to pray alwayes and not waxe faint, <hi>Luk.</hi> 18.1, 2, 3, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> to continue in prayer, and watch in the same with thanksgiving, <hi>Col.</hi> 4.2. Yet will they not be brought to pray constantly with their families, or in secret: Though <hi>Daniel</hi> would rather be cast to the Lyons, then he would forbear for a while praying openly in his house where his enemies might hear him three times a day; yet these men will rather venture to be an eternal prey to that roaring Lyon that seeks to devour them, then they will be at the pains thus to seek their safety. You may hear in their houses two oathes for one prayer. Or if they do any thing this way, it is usually but the running over a few formal words, which they have got on their tongues end, as if they came on purpose to make a jest of prayer, and to mock God and their own souls. If they be in distress, or want any thing for their bodies, they want no words to make known their mind; but to a Physitian when they are sick, to a griping Landlord when they are oppressed, to a wealthy friend when they are in want, they can lay open their case in sad complaints, and have words at will to press home their requests: Yea every beggar at their door can crave relief, and make it their daily practice and hold on with im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portunity, and take no denyal; necessity filleth their mouthes with words, and teacheth them the most natural prevailing Rhetorike: These beggars will rise up Judgment against them and condemn them. Doubtless if they felt but the misery and necessities of their souls, they would be as forward to beg relief of God, and as frequent, as fervent, as importunate, and as constant till they were past their streights. But, alas, he that only reades in a book that he is miserable, and what his soul stands in need of, but never felt himself miserable, nor felt particularly his several wants, no wonder if he must also fetch his prayer from his book only, or at furthest from the strength of his invention or memory. <hi>Solomons</hi> request to God was, That what prayer or Supplication soever should be made by any man, or by <hi>all the people, when every man shall know his own sore and his own grief, and shall spread forth his hands</hi> before God, that God would then hear and forgive, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> 2 <hi>Chron.</hi> 6.29, 30. If these men did thus know and feel every one the sore and the grief of his own soul, we should neither need so much to urge them to prayer, nor to teach them how to perform it, and what to say: Whereas now they do invite
<pb n="343" facs="tcp:61132:200"/>
God to be backward in giving, by their backwardness in asking; and to be weary of relieving them<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> by their own being weary in begging relief; and to be seldome and short in his favors, as they are in their prayers; and to give them but common and outward favors, as they put up but common and outside requests; Yea their cold and heartless prayers do invite God to a flat denial: for among men it is taken for granted, that he who askes but slieghtly &amp; seldom, cares not much for that he askes. Do not these men judge themselves unworthy of Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven, who think it not worth their more constant and earnest requests? If it be not worth asking for, it is worth nothing. And yet if you should go from house to house through Town and Parish, and enquire at every house as you go, whether they do morning and evening call their family together, and earnestly and reverently seek the Lord in prayer? how few would you finde that constantly and conscionably practice this duty? If every door were marked where they do not thus call upon the name of God, that his wrath might be powred out upon that family, our towns would be as places overthrown by the plague, the people being dead within, and the marke of judgment on the door without: I fear where one house would escape, ther's ten would be marked out for death: and then they might teach their doors to pray, <hi>Lord have mercy on us</hi>; because the people would not pray themselves. But especially if you could see what men do in their secret chambers, how few should you finde in a whole Town, that spend one quarter of an hour morning and night in earnest sup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plication to God for their souls? O how little do these men set by this eternall Rest? Thus do they slothfully neglect all endeavors for their one welfare, except some publike duty in the congregation, which custom or credit doth engage them to. Perswade them to read good books, and they will not be at so much pains: perswade them to learn the grounds of Religion in some Catechisme, and they think it a toilsome slavery, fitter for Schoolboyes or little children then for them: Perswade them to Sanctifie the Lords day in holy exercises, and to spend it wholly in hearing the word, and repeating it with their families, and prayer, and meditation, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> and to forbear all their worldly thoughts and speeches; And what a tedious life do they take this to be? and how long may you preach to them, before they will be brought to it? as if they thought that heaven were not worth all this ado.

THe third sort that fall under this Reproof, are those self-couzening, formal, lazie Professors of Religion, who will be brought to any outward duty, and to take up the easier part of Christianity, but to the inward work, and more difficult part, they will never be perswaded: They will Preach, or hear, or read, or talk of heaven, or pray customarily and constantly in their Families, and take part with the persons or causes that are good, and desire to be esteemed among the godly, but you can never bring them to the more spiritual and difficult duties, as to be constant and fervent in secret Prayer, to be conscionable in the duty of self-examination, to be constant in that excellent duty of Meditation, to be heavenly minded, to watch constantly over his heart, and words, and wayes; to deny his bodily senses their delights, to mortifie the flesh, and not make provision for it to fulfil its lusts, to love and heartily forgive an enemy, to prefer his brethren heartily before himself, and to think meanly of his own gifts and worth, and to take it well of others that think so too, and to love them that have low thoughts of him, as well as those that have high; to bear easily the injuries or underva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>luing words of others against him, to lay all that he hath at the feet

Above all other, two notable sorts there are of these Hypocrites. First, The superficial, opinionative Hypocrite.<note place="margin">Matth. 13.5.</note> Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>condly, The worldly Hypocrite. First, The former entertaineth the Doctrine of the Gospel with Joy, but it is onely into the sur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>face of his soul, he never gives the seed any depth of earth; It changeth his opinion, and he thereupon ingageth for Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion, as the right way, and sides with it as a party in a Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction, but it never melted and new molded his heart, nor set up Christ there in full Power and Authority; but as his Reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gion lyes most in his Opinion, so he usually runs from Opinion to Opinion, and is carried up and down with every winde of Doctrine, by the sleight of men, and cunning craftiness where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by they lye in weight to deceive; and as a childe is tossed too and fro; for as his Religion is but Opinion, so is his Study, and Conference, and chief business all about Opinion: He is usually an ignorant,<note place="margin">Ephes. 4.14.</note>

                        <p>Secondly, The like may be said of the worldly Hypocrite, who choaketh the Doctrine of the Gospel, with the thorns of worldly cares and desires; His Judgment is convinced, that he must be Religious, or he cannot be saved, and therefore he reads, and hears, and prays, and forsakes his former company and courses; but because his belief of the Gospel-Doctrine is but wavering and shallow, he resolves to keep his hold of present things, lest the promise of Rest should fail him, and yet to be religious, that so he may have heaven when he can keep the world no longer, think<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing it wisdom to have two strings to his bow, lest one should break. This mans Judgment may say, God is the chief good; but his heart and affections never said so, but look upon God as a kinde of strange and disproportionate Happiness, to be tollerated rather then the flames of hell, but not desired before the felicity on earth.<note place="margin">Phil. 3.9.</note> In a word, the world hath more of his Af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fections then God, and therefore is his God, and his Coveteous<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness is Idolatry. This he might easily know and feel, if he would judg impartially, and were but faithful to himsef: And though this man do not gad after Opinions and Novelties in his Religion as the former, yet will he set his sails to the winde of worldly ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vantage, and be of that opinion which will best serve his turn<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>

O the formal frozen lifeless Sermons which we daily hear preached upon the most weighty piercing Subjects in the world! How gently do we handle those sins, which will handle so cruelly our poor peoples souls? And how tenderly do we deal with their careless hearts? not speaking to them as to men that must be wakened or damned. We tell them of heaven and hell in such a sleepy tone, and sleighty way, as if we were but acting a part in a Play; so that we usually preach our people asleep with those subjects which one would think should rather endanger the driving of some besides themselves if they were faithfully delivered. Not that I commend, or excuse that reall indiscretion, and unseemly language, and nauseous repetitions, and ridiculous gestures, whereby many do disgrace the work of God, and bring his ordinances in contempt with the peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple, nor think it fit that he should be an Embassador from God on so weighty a business, that is not able to speak sense or rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son: But in a word, our want of seriousness about the things of Heaven, doth charme the souls of men into forma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lity, and hath brought them to this customary, careless hearing, which undoes them: The Lord pardon the great

Or that you have done but as much for them, as that damned Glutton would have had <hi>Lazarus</hi> do for his brethren on earth, to warn them that they come not to that place of Torment? Can your Ministers witness, that they have heard you cry out, What shall we do to be saved? and that you have followed them with complaints against your corruptions, and with earnest enquiries after the Lord?

on these, and talk of them, when thou shouldst greedily entertain them, thou wilt be never the better for them; and if thou loiter when thou shouldst labour, thou wilt lose the Crown.

Thou that art an observing sensible man, who knowest how much thou art beholden to God, I appeal to thee: Is not a loytering performance of a few heartless duties, an unworthy requital of such admirable kindness?

                        <p n="9">9. You are yet to this day in good earnest about the matters of this life: If you are sick, what Serious Groans and Complaints do you utter? All the Town shall quickly know it, if your pain be great. If you are poor, how hard do you labor for your living, lest your Wife and Children should starve or famish? If one fall down in a swoun in the house, or street, or in the Congregation, how seriously will you run to relieve and recover them? And is not the business of your Salvation of far greater moment? Are you not poor? and should you not then be laborers? Are you not in fight for your lives? and is it time to sleep? Are you not in a race? and is not the prize, the Crown of Glory? and should you then sit still, or take your ease?</p>
                        <p n="10">10. There is no Jesting in Heaven, nor in Hell. The Saints have a Real Happiness, and the Damned a Real Misery: The Saints are Serious and high in their Joy and Praise; and the Damned are Serious and deep in their Sorrow and Complaints. There are no remiss or sleepy Praises in Heaven; nor any remiss or sleepy Lamen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tations in Hell: All men there are in good sadness. And should we not then be Serious now? Reader, I dare promise thee, the thoughts of these things will shortly be Serious thoughts with thy self. When thou comest to Death or Judgment, Oh what deep heart-piercing thoughts wilt thou have of Eternity! Methinks I fore-see thee already astonished to think how thou couldst possibly make so light of these things! Methinks I even hear thee crying out of thy stupidity and madness!</p>

If you were to live a thousand years, would you not gladly live as strictly as the precisest Saints? and spend all those years in prayer and duty, so you might but scape the Torment which you suffered?

I have then no more to say to thee: It is as good speak to a post or a Rock. Only as we do by our friends when they are dead, and our words and actions can do them no good, yet to test me our affections we weep and mourn for them; so will I also do for these deplorable Souls. It makes my heart sad, and even tremble to think how they will stand sad and trembling before the Lord! and how confounded and speech<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>less they will be, when Christ shall reason with them concerning their negligence and sloath! When he shall say, as the Lord doth in <hi>Jer.</hi> 2.5, 9, 11, 12, 13. <hi>What iniquity have your fathers</hi> (or you) <hi>found in me, that ye are gone far from me, and have walked after vanity? &amp;c.</hi> Did I ever wrong you? or do you any harm? or ever discourage you from following my service?

Was the world or Satan a better friend to you then I? or had they done for you more then I had done? Try now whether they will save you, or whether they will recompence you for the loss of Heaven; or whether they will be as good to you as I would have been.

That we may not destroy the Souls for whom Christ dyed; That we may not rob them of their everlasting Hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>piness, and God of the Praises that in Heaven they would give him; What manner of persons should we be in our Duties and Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>amples?</p>

                        <p>Is there such a Glorious Rest so neer at hand? and shall none enjoy it but the People of God? What mean the most of the world then, to live so contentedly with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out assurance of their interest in this Rest? and to neglect the trying of their title to it? When the Lord hath so fully opened the Blessedness of that Kingdom, which none but a little flock of obe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dient Beleevers shall possess, and so fully expressed those torments which all the rest of the world must eternally suffer, a man would think now, That they that beleeve this to be certainly true, should never be at any quiet in themselves, till they knew which of these must be their own state, and were fully assured that they were Heirs of the Kingdom! Most men that I meet with say, they be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leeve this Word of God to be true; How then can they sit still in such an utter uncertainty, whether ever they shall live in Rest, or not? One would think they should run up and down from Minister
<pb n="381" facs="tcp:61132:223" rendition="simple:additions"/>
to Minister, enquiring, How shall I know whether I shall live in Heaven or Hell? and that they should even think themselves half in Hell, till they were sure to scape it, and to be possessed of Rest. Lord, what a wonderful strange madness is this? that men who look dayly when sickness summons them, and death calls them a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>way, and know they must presently enter upon unchangeable Joy or Pain, should yet live as uncertain what shall be their doom, as if they had never heard of any such State? yea and live as quietly and as merrily in this uncertainty, as if all were made sure, and nothing ailed them, and there were no danger? Are these men alive or dead? Are they waking, or are they asleep? What do they think on? Where are their hearts? If they have but a weighty Suit at Law, how careful are they to know whether it will go with them or against them? If they were to be tryed for their lives at an earthly Judicature, how careful would they be to know whether they should be saved or condemned? especially if their care might sure<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly save them? If they be dangerously sick, they will enquire of the Physician, What think you Sir, shall I scape or no? But for the bu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>siness of their Salvation, they are content to be uncertain. If you ask most men a reason of their hopes to be saved, they will say it is because God is merciful, and Christ dyed for sinners, and the like general reasons, which any man in the world may give as well as they: But put them to prove their special interest in Christ, and in the special saving Mercy of God, and they can say nothing to the purpose at all; or at least nothing out of their hearts and experi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence, but only out of their reading or invention. Men are desirous to know all things, save God and themselves: They will travel over Sea and Land to know the scituation of Countries, and the Customs of the World: They will go to Schools and Universities, and turn over multitudes of books, and read and study from year to year, to know the creatures, and to be excellent in the Sciences; They will go apprentice seven years to learn a trade which they may live by here: And yet they never read the book of Consci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence, nor study the state of their own Souls, that they may make sure of living for ever. If God should ask them for their Souls, as he did <hi>Cain</hi> for his brother <hi>Abel,</hi> they could return but such an Answer as he did: If God or man should say to them, What case is thy Soul in, man? Is it regenerate, and sanctified, and pardoned, or no? Is it in a state of life, or a state of death? He would be rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy

to say, I know not: Am I my Souls keeper? I hope well; I trust God with my Soul, and trouble not my self with any such thoughts: I shall speed as well as other men do; and so I will put it to the venture: I thank God I never made any doubt of my Sal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vation. <hi>Answ.</hi> Thou hast the more cause to doubt a great deal, because thou never didst doubt: and yet more, because thou hast been so careless in thy confidence. What do these expressions discover, but a wilful neglect of thy own Salvation? As a ship<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>master that should let his Vessel alone, and mind other matters, and say, I will venture it among the rocks, and sands, and gulfs, and waves, and winds; I will never trouble my self to know whether it shall come safe to the harbor; I will trust God with it; it will speed as well as other mens Vessels do. Indeed as well as other mens that are as careless and Idle, but not so well as other mens that are diligent and watchful. What horrible abuse of God is this, for men to pretend that they trust God with their Souls, for to cloak their own wilful negligence! If thou didst truly Trust God, thou wouldst also be ruled by him, and trust him in that way which he hath appointed thee, and upon those terms which he hath promised to help thee on. He requires thee to give all Diligence to make thy Calling and Election sure, and so to trust him, 2 <hi>Pet.</hi> 1.10. He hath lined thee out a way in Scripture by which thou mayst come to be sure, and charged thee to search and try thy self, till thou certainly know. Were he not a foolish traveller that would hold on his way when he doth not know whether it be right or wrong, and say, I hope I am right; I will not doubt of it; I will go on and trust God?

If thou shouldst see a man in despair, or that were certain to be damned for ever when he is dead, wouldst not thou look upon such a man as a pitiful object? Why thou that livest in wilful uncertainty, and dost not know whether thou shalt be saved or no, art in the next condition to such a person; for ought thou knowest to the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary, thy case hereafter may be as bad as his. I know not what thou thinkest of thy own state, but for my part, did I not know what a desperate, blind, dead piece a carnal heart is, I should won<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der
<pb n="383" facs="tcp:61132:225" rendition="simple:additions"/>
how thou dost to forget thy misery, and to keep off continual horrors from thy heart; And especially in these cases following.</p>
                        <p n="1">1. I wonder how thou canst either think or speak of the dread<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful God, without exceeding terror and astonishment, as long as thou art uncertain whether he be thy Father or thy Enemy, and knowest not but all his Attributes may be imployed against thee. If his Saints must rejoyce before him with trembling,<note place="margin">Psa. 2.6, 7, 8, 9</note> and serve him in fear; If they that are sure to receive the unmoveable King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom must yet serve God with reverence and godly fear, because <hi>he is a consuming fire</hi>;<note place="margin">Heb. 12.28.29</note> How then should the remembrance of him be terrible to them that know not but this fire may for ever con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sume them?</p>
                        <p n="2">2. How dost thou think without trembling upon Jesus Christ? when thou knowest not whether his blood hath purged thy Soul or not? and whether he will condemn thee or acquit thee in Judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment; nor whether he be set for thy rising or thy fall, <hi>Luk.</hi> 2.34. nor whether he be the corner Stone and Foundation of thy happi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness, or a stone of stumbling to break thee and grind thee to pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der, <hi>Mat.</hi> 21.44. Methinks thou shouldst be still in that tune as <hi>Job</hi> 31.23. <hi>Destruction from God is a terror to me, and by reason of his Highness I cannot endure.</hi>
                        </p>
                        <p n="3">3. How canst thou open the Bible, and read a Chapter, or hear a Chapter read, but it should terrifie thee? Methinks every leaf should be to thee as <hi>Belshazzars</hi> writing upon the wall,<note place="margin">Dan. 5.5, 6.</note> except only that which draws thee to try and reform: If thou read the Promises, thou knowest not whether ever they shall be fulfilled to thee, because thou art uncertain of thy performance of the Condi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion: If thou read the Threatnings, for any thing thou knowest thou dost read thy own sentence. I do not wonder if thou art an enemy to plain preaching, and if thou say of it, and of the Minister and Scripture it self as <hi>Ahab</hi> of the Prophet, <hi>I hate him, for he doth not prophecy good concerning me, but evil,</hi> 1 <hi>Kings</hi> 22.8.</p>
                        <p n="4">4. I wonder how thou canst without terror approach God in prayer, or any duty. When thou callest him thy Father, thou knowest not whether thou speak true or false: When thou needest him in thy sickness, or other extremity, thou knowest not whether thou hast a friend to go to, or an enemy. When thou receivest the Sacrament, thou knowest not whether thou take thy blessing or
<pb n="384" facs="tcp:61132:226"/>
thy bane. And who would wilfully live such a life as this?</p>
                        <p n="5">5. What comfort canst thou find in any thing which thou pos<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sessest? Methinks friends, and honors, and house, and lands, should do thee little good, till thou know that thou hast the love of God with all; and shalt have Rest with him when thou leavest these. Offer to a prisoner before he know his sentence either musick, or clothes, or lands, or preferment, and what cares he for any of these? till he know how he shall scape for his life, and then he will look after these comforts of life, and not before; for he knows if he must dye the next day, it will be small comfort to dye rich or honorable. Methinks it should be so with thee, till thou know thine eternal state: Dost not thou as <hi>Ezek.</hi> 12.18. <hi>Eat thy bread with quaking, and drink thy drink with trembling and carefulness,</hi> and say, Alas, though I have these to refresh my body now, yet I know not what I shall have hereafter! Even when thou liest down to take thy rest, methinks the uncertainty of thy Salvation should keep thee wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king, or amaze thee in thy dreams, and trouble thy sleep; and thou shouldst say as <hi>Job</hi> in a smaller distress then thine, <hi>Job</hi> 7.13, 14. <hi>When I say, My bed shall comfort me, my couch shall ease my com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plaint; then thou scarest me through dreams, and terrifiest me through visions.</hi>
                        </p>
                        <p n="6">6. Doth it not grieve thee to see the people of God so com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fortable, when thou hast none thy self? and to think of the Glory which they shall inherit, when thou hast no assurance thy self of ever enjoying it?</p>
                        <p n="7">7. What shift dost thou make to think of thy dying hour? Thou knowest it is hard by, and there's no avoyding it, nor any medicine found out that can prevent it: Thou knowest it is the <hi>King of terror, Job</hi> 18.14. and the very inlet to thine unchange<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able state: The godly that have some assurance of their future wel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fare, have yet much ado to submit to it willingly, and find, that to dye comfortably is a very difficult work. How then canst thou think of it then without astonishment, who hast got no assurance of the Rest to come? If thou shouldst dye this day (and <hi>who knows what a day may bring forth,</hi> Prov. 27.1.) thou dost not know whether thou shalt go straight to Heaven or to Hell: And canst thou be merry till thou art got out of this dangerous state? Methinks that in <hi>Deut.</hi> 28.25, 26, 27. should be the looking-glass of thy heart.</p>

                           <pb n="385" facs="tcp:61132:226" rendition="simple:additions"/>8. What shift dost thou make to preserve thy heart from hor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ror, when thou remembrest the great Judgment day, and the Ever<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lasting flames?<note place="margin">Acts 24.25.</note> Dost thou not tremble as <hi>Felix</hi> when thou hearest of it? and as the Elders of the Town trembled when <hi>Samuel</hi> came in it,<note place="margin">1 Sam. 16.4.</note> saying, <hi>Comest thou peaceably?</hi> So methinks thou shouldst do when the Minister comes into the Pulpit: And thy heart, when ever thou meditatest of that day, should meditate ter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ror, <hi>Isai.</hi> 33.18. And thou shouldst be even a terror to thy self, and all thy friends, <hi>Jer.</hi> 20.4. If the keepers trembled, and became as dead men, when they did but see the Angels, <hi>Mat.</hi> 28.3, 4. how canst thou think of living in Hell with Devils, till thou hast got some sound assurance that thou shalt escape it? Or if thou seldom think of these things, the wonder is as great, what shift thou makest to keep these thoughts from thy heart, and to live so quietly in so doleful a state? Thy bed is very soft, or thy heart is very hard, if thou canst sleep soundly in this uncertain case.</p>
                        <p>I have shewed thee the danger; let me next proceed to shew thee the Remedy.</p>

The great means to conquer this Uncertainty is Self-Examination, or the Serious and diligent trying of a mans heart and state by the rule of Scripture. This Scripture tells us plainly who shall be sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved, and who shall not: So that if men would but first search the Word to find out who be these men that shall have Rest, and what be their properties by which they may be known; and then next search carefully their own hearts, till they find whether they are those men or not; how could they chuse but come to some Cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainty? But, alas, either men understand not the nature and use of this duty, or else they will not be at the pains to try. Go through

a Congregation of a thousand men, <q>and how few of them shall you meet with that ever bestowed one hour in all their lives in a close Examination of their title to Heaven?</q>
Ask thy own Conscience, Reader; When was the time, and where was the place, that ever thou solemnly tookest thy heart to task as in the sight of God, and examined it by Scripture Interrogatories, Whether it be Born a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gain and Renewed, or not? Whether it be Holy, or not? Whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther it be set most on God, or on creatures? on Heaven, or on Earth? and didst follow on this Examination till thou hast disco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vered thy Condition, and so past sentence on thy self accord<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ingly?</p>
                        <p>But because this is a Work of so high Concernment, and so com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monly neglected, and mens Souls do so much languish every where under this neglect; I will therefore (though it be Digressive) 1. Shew you, That it is possible by trying to come to a Certainty. 2. Shew you the hinderances that keep men from trying, and from Assurance. 3. I will lay down some Motives to perswade you to it. 4. I will give you some Directions how you should perform it. 5. And lastly, I will lay you down some Marks out of Scripture by which you may try; and so come to an infallible Certainty, Whether you are the People of God for whom this Rest Remain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth, or no.

                        <p>So that Examination containeth severall Acts: 1. There must be the Tryal of the Physical Truth or Sincerity of our Acts; That is, An enquiry after the very Being of them: As whether there be such an Act as Belief, or Desire, or Love to God, within us, or not? This must be discovered by Conscience, and the internal sense of the Soul, whereby it is able to feel and perceive its own Acts, and to know whether they be Real or Counterfeit.</p>

This is the discursive work of Reason, com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>paring our Acts with the Rule: It implyeth the former knowledg of the Being of our Acts; and it implyeth the knowledg of Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture in the point in question; and also the Belief of the Truth of Scripture. This Moral, Spiritual Truth of our Acts, is another thing, far different from the Natural or Physical Truth, as far as a Mans Being differeth from his Honesty. One man loveth his wife under the notion of an harlot, or only to satisfie his lust; Another loveth his wife with a true Conjugal Affection: The former is True Physical Love, or true in point of Being; but the latter only is True Moral Love. The like may be said in regard of all the Acts of the Soul: There is a Believing, Loving, Trusting, Fearing, Rejoycing, all True in point of Being, and not counterfeit, which yet are all false in point of Morality and right-being, and so no gracious Acts at all.</p>

The third thing contained in the Work of Self-Examination is, The Judging or Concluding of our Real Estate, that is, of the habitual temper or disposition of our Hearts by the quality of their Acts: Whether they are such Acts as prove a Habit of Holiness? or only some slight Disposition? or whether they are only by some Accident enticed and enforced, and prove neither Habit nor Dispo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sition? The like also of our Evil Acts. Now the Acts which prove a Habit must be, 1. Free and chearful; not constrained, or such as we had rather not do, if we could help it: 2. Frequent, if there be opportunity: 3. Through and Serious. Where Note al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>so,<note place="margin">lindx;</note> That the Tryal of the Souls Disposition by those Acts which make after the End (as Desire, Love, &amp;c. to God, Christ, Heaven) is always more Necessary and more Certain, then the tryal of its Disposition to the Means only.</p>
                        <p n="4">4. The last Act in this Examination, is, To Conclude or Judg of our Relative Estate, from the former Judgment of our Acts and Habits. As if we find sincere Acts, we may Conclude that we have the Habits, so from both we may Conclude of our Relation. So that our Relations or Habits are neither of them felt, or known immediately; but must be gathered from the knowledg of our Acts which may be felt. As for Example, 1. I enquire whether I Believe in Christ, or Love God? 2. If I find that I do, then I enquire
<pb n="388" facs="tcp:61132:228"/>
next whether I do it sincerely according to the Rule and the Nature of the Object? 3. If I find that I do so, then I conclude that I am Regenerate or Sanctified. 4. And from both these I conclude that I am Pardoned, Reconciled, Justified and Adopted into sonship and title to the Inheritance. All this is done in a way of Reasoning thus:
<list>
                              <item>1. He that Believes in Spiritual Sincerity, or He that Loves God in Spiritual Sincerity, is a Regenerate Man: But I do so Believe, and Love; Therefore I am Regenerate.</item>
                              <item>2. He that Believes in Sincerity, or He that is Regenerate (for the Conclusion will follow upon either) is also Pardoned, Justified and Adopted: But I do so Believe, or I am Regenerate: Therefore I am Justified, &amp;c.</item>
                           </list>

                           <note place="margin">§. 4</note>THus you see what Examination is, Now let us see what this Certainty, or Assurance is. And indeed, It is nothing else but the Knowledg of the forementioned Conclusions (that we are Sanctified,<note place="margin">
                              <hi>Assurance what.</hi>
                           </note> Justified, shall be Glorified) as they arise from the pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mises in the work of Examination.</p>
                        <p>So that here you may observe, how immediately this Assurance followeth the Conclusion in Examination; and so how necessary Examination is to the obtaining of Assurance, and how conducible thereunto.</p>
                        <p>Also that we are not speaking of the Certainty of the Object, or of the thing in it self considered; but of the Certainty of the Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject, or of the thing to our Knowledg.</p>
                        <p>Also you may observe, that before we can come to this Certain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty of the Conclusion, [That we are Justified, and shall be Glorified] there must be a Certainty of the Premises: And in respect of the Major Proposition [He that Believeth sincerely shall be Justified and Saved] there is requisite in us, 1. A Certainty of Knowledg, That such a Proposition is written in Scripture: 2. A Certainty of Assent or Faith, That this Scripture is the Word of God, and True. Also in respect of the Minor Proposition [But I do sincerely Believe, or Love, &amp;c.] there is requisite, 1. A Certainty of the Truth of our Faith in point of Being: 2. And a Certainty of its Truth in
<pb n="389" facs="tcp:61132:228" rendition="simple:additions"/>
point of Morality, or Congruence with the Rule, or its Right-be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing. And then followeth Assurance, which is the Certainty that the Conclusion [Therefore I am Justified, &amp;c.] followeth necessa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rily upon the former Premises.</p>
                        <p>
                           <note n="*" place="margin">

Tom.</hi> 2. <hi>disp.</hi> 8. <hi>q.</hi> 4. <hi>punct.</hi> 4.</note> Here also you must carefully distinguish betwixt the several degrees of Assurance. All Assurance is not of the highest degree. It differs in strength according to the different degrees of Appre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hension in all the forementioned Points of Certainty which are ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cessary thereunto. He that can truly raise the foresaid Conclusion [That he is Justified, &amp;c.] from the Premises, hath some degree of Assurance; though he do it with much weakness, and staggering, and doubting. The weakness of our Assurance in any one point of the premises, will accordingly weaken our Assurance in the Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clusion.</p>
                        <p>Some, when they speak of Certainty of Salvation, do mean only such a Certainty as excludeth all doubting, and think nothing else can be called Certainty, but this high degree. Perhaps some Papists mean this, when they deny a Certainty. Some also maintain, That Saint <hi>Paul</hi>'s Plerophory, or full Assurance, is this Highest de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gree of Assurance; and that some Christians do in this life attain to it. But <hi>Paul</hi> calls it Full Assurance in comparison of lower degrees, and not because it is perfect. For if Assurance be perfect, then also our Certainty of Knowledg, Faith and Sense in the <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="3 letters">
                              <desc>•••</desc>

                           <g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mises must be perfect: And if some Grace perfect, why not all? and so we turn Novatians, Catharists, Perfectionists. Perhaps in some their Certainty may be so great, that it may overcome all sen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sible doubting, or sensible stirrings of Unbelief, by reason of the sweet and powerful Acts and Effects of that Certainty: And yet it doth not overcome all Unbelief and Uncertainty so as to expel or nullifie them; but a certain measure of them remaineth still. Even as when you would heat cold water by the mixture of hot, you may pour in the hot so long till no coldness is felt; and yet the water may be far from the highest degree of heat. So faith may sup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>press the sensible stirrings of unbelief, and Certainty prevail against all the trouble of uncertainty, and yet be far from the highest degree.</p>
                        <p>So that by this which is said you may Answer the Question, What Certainty is to be attained in this Life? and what Certainty it is that we press men to labour for and expect?</p>
                        <p>
                           <pb n="390" facs="tcp:61132:229"/>Furthermore, you must be sure to distinguish betwixt Assurance it self, and the Joy, and Strength, and other sweet Effects which follow Assurance, or which immediately accompany it.</p>
                        <p>It is possible that there may be Assurance, and yet no comfort, or little. There are many unskilful, but self-conceited Disputers of late, fitter to manage a club, then an Argument, who tell us, That it must be the Spirit that must Assure us of our Salvation, and not our Marks and Evidences of Grace; That our comfort must not be taken from any thing in our selves; That our <note n="*" place="margin">
                              <hi>That it is not properly any act of faith at all, (much less the Justify<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing Act) to Believe that my sins are pardoned, or that Christ dyed in a spe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cial sence for Me, or that I am a Believer, or that I shall be saved; Besides what I have said in the Appendix to my Aphorisms of Justification. I refer you for satisfaction to Judicious Mr</hi> Anth: Wotton <hi>de Reconciliat: Part.</hi> 1. <hi>Lib.</hi> 2. <hi>Cap.</hi> 15. <hi>N.</hi> 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8. <hi>Pag.</hi> 87, 88, 89, 90, &amp;c.</note> Justification must be immediately believed, and not proved by our Signs, or Sanctification, &amp;c. Of these in order. 1. It is as wise a Questi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on to ask, Whether our Assurance come from the Spirit, or our Evi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dences, or our Faith, &amp;c? as to ask whether it be our meat, or our stomack, or our teeth, or our hands, that feed us? Or whether it be our Eye-sight, or the Sun-light by which we see things? They are distinct Causes, all necessary to the producing of the same Effect.</p>
                        <p>So that by what hath bin said you may discern, That the Spirit, and Knowledg, and Faith, and Scripture, &amp; inward Holines, and Reason, and inward Sense or Conscience, have all several parts, and necessary uses in producing our Assurances; which I will shew you distinctly.</p>
                        <p n="1">1. To the Spirit belong these particulars: 1. He hath indited those Scriptures which contain the promise of our Pardon and Sal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vation. 2. He giveth us the habit or power of Believing. 3. He helpeth us also to Believe Actually, That the Word is true, and to receive Christ and the priviledges offered in the promise. 4. He worketh in us those Graces, and exciteth those Gracious Acts with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in us, which are the <note n="*" place="margin">
                              <hi>I use the word</hi> Evi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence <hi>all a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>long in the vulgar sence as the same with Signs, and not in the proper sence as the Schools do.</hi>
                           </note> Evidences or Marks of our interest, pardon and Life: He helpeth us to perform those Acts which God hath made to be the Condition of Pardon and Glory. 5. He helpeth us to feel and discover these Acts in our selves. 6. He helpeth us to compare them with the Rule<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> and finding out their qualifications to Judg of their Sincerity and Acceptation with God. 7. He helpeth our Reason to Conclude rightly of our State from our Acts.
<pb n="391" facs="tcp:61132:229" rendition="simple:additions"/>
8. He enliveneth and heighteneth our Apprehension in these par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticulars, that our Assurance may accordingly be strong and lively. 9. He exciteth our Joy, and filleth with comfort (when he pleaseth) upon this Assurance. None of all these could we perform well of our selves.</p>
                        <p n="2">2. The Part which the Scripture hath in this Work is, 1. It af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fordeth us the Major Proposition, [That whosoever Believeth Sin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerely shall be saved.] 2. It is the Rule by which our Acts must be tryed, that we may Judg of their Moral Truth.</p>
                        <p n="3">3. The Part that Knowledg hath in it, is to Know that the fore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>said Proposition is written in Scripture.</p>
                        <p n="4">4. The Work of Faith is to Believe the Truth of that Scripture, and to be the matter of one of our chief Evidences.</p>
                        <p n="5">5. Our Holiness, and true Faith, as they are Marks and Eviden<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces, are the very <hi>Medium</hi> of our Argument, from which we Conclude.</p>
                        <p n="6">6. Our Conscience and internal Sense do acquaint us with both the Being and Qualifications of our inward Acts, which are this <hi>Medium,</hi> and which are called Marks.</p>
                        <p n="7">7. Our Reason or Discourse is Necessary to form the Argument, and raise the Conclusion from the Premises; and to compare our Acts with the Rule, and Judg of their Sincerity, &amp;c.</p>

What the Testimony of Consci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence is.</p>
                        <p>And (if I be not mistaken) the Testimony of the Spirit, and the Testimony of Conscience are two concurrent Testimonies or Cau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ses, to produce one and the same Effect, and to afford the Premises to the same Conclusion, and then to raise our Joy thereupon. So that they may well be said to Witness Together. Not one laying down the intire Conclusion of it self, [That we are the Children

                        <p>But this with Submission to better Judgments, and further Search.</p>

                           <g ref="char:punc">▪</g> A small degree of Certainty, hath some small glimpse of Evidence.

                              <hi>Therefore I say not that our first Comfort, much less our Justification is procured by the sight of Evidences: But our Assu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rance is.</hi>
                           </note> being that Faith which is the Condition of our Justification. But before any man can in the least Assurance con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clude, that he is the Child of God, and Justified, he must have some Assurance of that Mark or Evidence. For who can conclude Ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>solutely, that he shall receive the thing contained in a Conditional Promise, till he know that he hath performed the Condition? For those that say, There is no Condition to the New Covenant, I think them not worthy a word of confutation.</p>
                        <p>And for their Assertion <note n="*" place="margin">
                              <hi>Their com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon Error [That Ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stifying faith is nothing else but a perswasion more or less of the Love of God to us] is the Root of this and ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny more mistakes.

                           </note>, [That we are bound immediately to Believe that we are Justified, and in special Favour with God:] It is such as no man, of competent knowledg in the Scripture, and be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lief of its truth, can once imagine. For if every man must believe this, then most must believe a lye, (for they never shall be Justified:) yea all must at first believe a lye; for they are not Justified till they believe: and the believing that they are Justified is not the faith which Justifieth them. If only some men must believe this, how shall it be known who they be? The truth is, [That we are Justified] is not properly to be Believed at all: For nothing is to be Believed which is not written: but it is no where written that you or I are Justified: only one of those premises is written, from

If God have no where promised to any man Justification immediately without Condition, then no man can so believe it: but God hath no where promised it Absolutely; therefore, &amp;c. Nor hath he declared to any man that is not first a Believer, that he loveth him with any more then a common love: Therefore no more can be believed but a common love to any such. For the Eternal Love and Election is manifest to no man before he is a Believer.</p>

HAving thus shewed you what Examination is,<note place="margin">§. 5.</note> and what Assurance is, I come to the second thing promised; To shew you, That such an Infallible Certainty of Salvation may be attained, and ought to be laboured for, (though a Perfect Certainty cannot here be attained:) And that Examination is the means to attain it. In which I shall be the briefer, because many writers <note n="*" place="margin">
                              <hi>Yet I be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve that their divines have some of them made the difference betwixt us and the Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pists seem wider then it is, as do these words of one of them: Ex hoc unico articulo quantumvis minutus a plerisque reputari queat, universus Papatus &amp; Lutheranismus dependet.

                           </note> against the Papists on this point have said enough already. Yet somewhat I will say, 1. because it is the common conceit of the Ignorant Vulgar, That an Infallible Certainty cannot be attained, 2. and many have taught and printed, That it is only the Testimony of the Spirit that can assure us; and that this proving our Justifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cation by our Sanctification, and searching after Marks and Signs in our selves for the procuring of Assurance, is a dangerous and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceitful way. Thus we have the Papists, the Antinomians, and the ignorant Vulgar conspiring against this doctrine of Assurance and Examination. Which I maintain against them by these Argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments.</p>
                        <p n="1">1. Scripture tells us we may know, &amp; that the Saints before us have

                        <p n="2">2. If we may be certain of the Premises, then may we also be certain of the undenyable Conclusion of them. But here we may be certain of both the Premises. For 1. <hi>That whosoever believeth in Christ shall not perish, but shall have everlasting life,</hi> is the voyce of the Gospel; and therefore that we may be sure of: That we are such Believers, may be known by Conscience and internal Sense. I know all the question is in this, Whether the Moral Truth or Sincerity of our Faith and other Graces can be known thus, or not? And that it may I prove thus.</p>
                        <p n="1">1. From the natural use of this Conscience, and internal Sense; which is to acquaint us not only with the Being, but the Qualifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cations of the Acts of our Souls. All voluntary Motions are Sen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sible. And though the heart is so deceitful, that no man can certainly know the heart of another, and with much difficulty clearly know their own; yet by diligent observation and examination known they may be: for though our inward Sense and Conscience may be depraved, yet not extirpated, or quite <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="4 letters">

                        <p n="2">2. The Commands of Believing, Repenting, &amp;c. were in Vain, especially as the Condition of the Covenant, if we could not know whether we perform them or not.</p>
                        <p n="3">3. The Scripture would never make such a wide difference be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween the Godly and the Wicked, the Children of God and the Children of the Devil, and set forth the happiness of the one and the misery of the other so largely, and make this Difference to run through all the veins of its doctrine; if a man cannot know which of these two estates he is in.</p>
                        <p n="4">4. Much less would the Holy Ghost urge us to <hi>give all dili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gence to make our Calling and Election sure,</hi> if it could not be done, 2 <hi>Pet.</hi> 1.10.

                        <p>And 1. We cannot doubt but Satan will do his part,<note place="margin">1. <hi>Satan.</hi>
                           </note> to hinder us from such a necessary duty as this: If all the power he hath can do it, or all the means and Instruments which he can raise up, he will be sure above all duties to keep you off from this. He is loath the Godly should have that Joy, and Assurance, and Advantage against Corruption, which the faithful performance of Self-Examination would procure them. And for the Ungodly he knows, if they should once fall close to this Examining task, they would find out his deceits, and their own danger, and so be very likely to escape him:
<pb n="396" facs="tcp:61132:232"/>
If they did but faithfully perform this duty, he were likely to lose most of the Subjects of his Kingdom. How could he get so many millions to Hell willingly, if they knew they went thither? And how could they chuse but know if they did throughly try? having such a clear light and sure rule in the Scripture to discover it? If the beast did know that he is going to the slaughter, he would not be driven so easily to it; but would strive for his life before he comes to dye, as well as he doth at the time of his death. If <hi>Bala<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>am</hi> had seen as much of the danger as his Ass, instead of his driving on so furiously, he would have been as loath to proceed as he. If the <hi>Syrians</hi> had known whither they were going, as well as <hi>Elisha</hi> did, they would have stopt before they had found themselves in the hand of their Enemies, 2 <hi>King.</hi> 6.19, 20. So if sinners did but know whither they are hasting, they would stop before they are engulfed in damnation. If every swearer, drunkard, whoremonger, lover of the world, or unregenerate person whatsoever, did certainly know that the way he is in will never bring him to Heaven, and that if he dye in it, he shall undoubtedly perish, Satan could never get him to proceed so resolvedly: Alas, he would then think every day a year till he were out of the danger; and whether he were eating, drinking, working, or what ever he were doing, the thoughts of his danger would be still in his mind, and this voyce would be stil in his ears, <hi>Except thou Repent and be converted thou shalt surely perish.</hi> The Devil knows well enough, that if he cannot keep men from trying their states, and knowing their misery, he shal hardly be able to keep them from Repentance and Salvation: And therefore he deals with them as <hi>Jael</hi> with <hi>Sisera</hi>; she gives him fair words, and food, and layeth him to sleep, and covereth his face, and then she comes upon him softly,<note place="margin">

If the pit be not covered, who but the blind will fall into it? If the snare be not hid, the bird will escape it: Satan knows how to angle for Souls, better then to shew them the hook and the line, and to fright them away with a noise, or with his own appearance.</p>
                        <p>Therefore he labours to keep them from a searching Ministry; or to keep the Minister from helping them to search: or to take off the edg of the Word, that it may not pierce and divide; or to turn away their thoughts; or to possess them with prejudice: Satan is

                           <pb n="401" facs="tcp:61132:234" rendition="simple:additions"/>1. There is such a Confusion and darkness in the Soul of man, especially of an unregenerate man, that he can scarcely tell what he doth, or what is in him. As one can hardly finde any thing in a house where nothing keeps his place, but all is cast on a heap together; so is it in the heart where all things are in disorder, <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                              <desc>•</desc>

                           <g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>specially when darkness is added to this disorder; so that the heart is like an obscure Cave or Dungeon, where there is but a little crevise of light, and a man must rather grope then see. No wonder if men mistake in searching such a heart, and so miscar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry in judging of their estates.</p>
                        <p n="2">2. And the rather because most men do accustom themselves to be strangers at home, and are little taken up with observing the temper and motions of their own hearts: All their studies are imployed without them, and they are no where less acquainted then in their own brests.</p>
                        <p n="3">3. Besides many come to the work with forestalling conclu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sions: They are resolved what to judge before they Try: They use the duty but to strengthen their present conceits of them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves, and not to find out the truth of their condition: Like a bribed Judge, who examines each party as if he would Judge uprightly, when he is resolved which way the cause shall go before hand. Or as perverse disputers, who argue only to maintain their present opinions, rather then to try those opinions whether they are right or wrong. Just so do men examine their hearts.</p>
                        <p n="4">4. Also men are partial in their own Cause: They are ready to think their great sins small, and their small sins to be none; their gifts of nature to be the work of Grace, and their gifts of common grace, to be the special grace of the Saints. They are straight ways ready to say,<note place="margin">Mat. 19.20.</note> 
                           <hi>All these have I kept from my youth: And I am rich and increased, &amp;c. Rev.</hi> 3.17. The first common excellency that they meet with in themselves, doth so dazle their eyes, that they are presently satisfied that all is well, and look no further.</p>
                        <p n="5">5. Besides, most men do search but by the halves. If it will not easily &amp; quickly be done, they are discouraged, and leaveoff. Few set to it and follow it, as beseems them in a work of such moment. He must give all diligence that means to make sure.</p>
                        <p n="6">6. Also men try themselves by false Marks and Rules; not knowing wherein the truth of Christianity doth consist; some
<pb n="402" facs="tcp:61132:235"/>
looking beyond, and some short of the Scripture standard.</p>
                        <p n="7">7. Moreover there is so great likeness betwixt the lowest de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gree of special grace, and the highest degree of Common Grace, that it is no wonder if the unskilful be mistaken. It is a great Question, whether the main difference between special grace and common, be not rather gradual, then specifical: If it should be so (as some think) then the discovery will be much more difficult. However to discern by what principle our affections are moved, and to what ends, and with what sincerity, is not very easie; there being so many wrong Ends and motives which may excite the like Acts. Every grace in the Saints hath its coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terfeit in the Hypocrite.</p>
                        <p n="8">8. Also men use to Try themselves by unsafe Marks: either looking for a high degree of grace instead of a lower degree in sincerity, as many doubting Christians do; or else enquiring only into their outward Actions; or into their inward Affecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons without their ends, motives and other qualifications: The sure evidences are Faith, Love, &amp;c. that are Essential parts of our Christianity, and that lie neerest to the heart.</p>
                        <p n="9">9. Lastly, Men frequently miscarry in this work by setting on it in their own strength. As some expect the Spirit should do it without them, so others attempt it themselves without seeking or expecting the help of the Spirit: both these will certainly miscarry in their Assurance.

                        <p>Because the Comfort of a Christians life doth so much consist in his Assurance of Gods Special Love, and because the right way of obtaining it is so much controverted of late, I will here proceed a little further in opening to you some other Hin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derances which keep true Christians from Comfortable Certain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty, besides the forementioned Errors in the Work of Examina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion: Though I would still have you remember and be sensi<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

<pb n="403" facs="tcp:61132:235" rendition="simple:additions"/>
the most common Hinderance, for ought I have yet found.</p>
                        <p>I shall add now these Ten more, which I find very ordinary Impediments, and therefore desire Christians more carefully to Consider and Beware of them.</p>
                        <p n="1">1. One Common and great Cause of doubting and uncertain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty, is, The weakness and small measure of our Graces. A little Grace is next to None. Small things are hardly discerned. He that will see a small needle, a hair, a mote, or atome, must have clear light and good eyes: But houses, and Towns, and Moun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tains are easily discerned. Most Christians content themselves with a small measure of Grace, and do not follow on to spiritual strength and manhood. They Believe so weakly, and Love God so little, that they can scarce find whether they Believe and Love at all. Like a man in a swoun, whose pulse and breathing is so weak and obscure, that it can hardly be perceived whether they move at all, and consequently, whether the man be alive or dead.</p>
                        <p>The chief Remedy for such would be,<note place="margin">

                           </note> To follow on their du<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty till their Graces be increased: Ply your work: Wait upon God in the use of his prescribed means, and he will undoubtedly bless you with Increase and Strength. Oh that Christians would bestow most of that time in getting more Grace, which they be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stow in Anxious doubtings, whether they have any or none: And that they would lay out those Serious Affections in Praying, and seeking to Christ for more Grace, which they bestow in fruitless Complaints of their supposed Gracelesness! I beseech thee, Christian, take this advice as from God: And then, when thou Believest strongly, and Lovest fervently, thou canst not doubt whether thou do Believe and Love or not: No more then a man that is burning hot can doubt whether he be warm; or a man that is strong and lusty can doubt whether he be alive. Strong Affections will make you feel them. Who loveth his friend, or wife, or child, or any thing strongly, and doth not know it? A great measure of Grace is seldom doubted of: Or if it be, you may quickly find when you seek and try.</p>

Why I beseech thee consider this, Oh doubting Soul: What if all were as b<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

Dost thou not know that thou mayst have Christ and pardon when ever thou wilt? Call not this a loose or strange doctrine. Christ is willing if thou be willing. He offereth himself and all his benefits to thee: He presseth them on thee, and urgeth thee to accept them: He will condemn thee and destroy thee if thou wilt not accept them. Why dost thou therefore stand whining and complaining that thou art not Pardoned and Adopted, when thou shouldst take them being offered thee? Were he not mad that would lie weeping and wringing his hands, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause he is not pardoned, when his Prince stands by all the while offering him a pardon, and intreating; and threatning, and per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>swading, and correcting him, and all to make him take it? What would you say to such a man? Would you not chide him for his folly, and say, If thou wouldst have Pardon and Life, why dost thou not take it? Why then do you not say the like to your selves? Know ye not that Pardon and Adoption are offered you only on the Condition of your Believing?
<q>And this Believing is nothing else but the Accepting of Christ for thy Lord and Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viour, as he is offered to thee with his benefits in the Gospel: And this Accepting is principally (if not only) the Act of thy Will. So that if thou be willing to have Christ upon his own terms, that is, to Save and Rule thee, then thou art a Believer: Thy willingness is thy Faith.</q>
And if thou have Faith, thou hast the surest of all Evidences. Justifying Faith is not thy Perswasi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of Gods special Love to thee, or of thy Justification; but thy Accepting Christ to make thee Just and Lovely. It may be thou
<pb n="405" facs="tcp:61132:236" rendition="simple:additions"/>
wilt say, I cannot Believe; It is not so easie a matter to Believe as you make it. <hi>Answ.</hi> Indeed to those that are not willing, it is not easie: God only can make them willing: But to him that is will<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to have Christ for King and Saviour, I will not say Believing is easie, but it is already performed; for this is Believing. Let me therefore put this Question to every doubting complaining Soul: What is it that thou art complaining and mourning for? What makes thee walk so sadly as thou dost? Because thou hast not Christ and his benefits. Why, art thou willing to have them on the forementioned Condition? or art thou not? If thou be Will<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, thou hast him: Thy Accepting is thy Believing: To <hi>as many as Receive him</hi> (that is, Accept him) <hi>to them he gives power to be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come the Sons of God, even to them that Believe on his Name,</hi> Joh. 1.12. But if thou art not Willing, why dost thou Complain? Methinks the tongue should follow the bent of the heart or Will; And they that would not have Christ, should be speaking against him, at least against his Laws and Ways, and not complaining be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause they do not enjoy him. Dost thou groan and make such moan for want of that which thou wouldst not have? If indeed thou wouldst not have Christ for thy King and Saviour, then have I nothing to say but to perswade thee to be Willing. Is it not madness then to lie complaining that we have not Christ, when we may have him if we will? If thou have him not, take him, and cease thy complaints: Thou canst not be so forward and willing as he is: And if He be Willing, and thou be Willing, who shall break the Match?<note place="margin">

Some Know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledg or Assurance of our Regenerate and Justified Estate the Spirit gives more ordinarily; but that sensible Joy is more seldom and extraordinary. We have cause enough to keep off doubtings and distress of spirit, upon the bare sight of our Evidences, though we do not feel any further Joys. This these complaining Souls under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stand not; and therefore though they cannot deny their willing<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness to have Christ, nor many other the like Graces, which are in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fallible Signs of their Justification and Adoption, yet because they do not feel their spirits replenished with comforts, they throw a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>way all, as if they had nothing.

These men must be taught to know, that the matter of their Comfort is in the Promises, and thence they must fetch it as oft as they expect it: And that if they set themselves dayly and diligently to Meditate of the Truth of those Promises, and of the rare excellency contained in them, and of their own title thereto, in this way they may expect the Spirits assistance for the raising of holy Comfort in their Souls. But if they lie still bewailing their want of Joy, while the full and free Promises lie by them, and never take them, and rip them up, and look into them, and apply them to their hearts by Serious Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ditation, They may complain for want of Comfort long enough before they have it, in Gods ordinary way of conveyance.

This may be the case of a gracious Soul, who hath better grounds, and doth not see them: And then when they grow to more ripeness of Understanding, and come to find out the insuffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciency of their former grounds of Comfort, they cast away their Comfort wholy, when they should only cast away their rotten props of it, and search for better to support it with. As if their Comfort and their Safety were both of a nature, and both built on the same Foundation, they conclude against their Safety, because they have discovered the mistake of their former Comforts. And there are many much applauded Books and Teachers of late who further the delusion of poor Souls in this point, and make them be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve, that because their former Comforts were too Legal, and their perswasions of their good estate were ill grounded, therefore them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves were under the Covenant of Works only, and their spiritual condition as unsound as their Comforts: These men observe not, That while they deny us the use of Marks to know our own state, yet they make use of them themselves to know the states of others: Yea and of false and insufficient Marks too. For to argue from the Motive of our perswasion of a good estate, to the goodness or
<pb n="409" facs="tcp:61132:238" rendition="simple:additions"/>
badness of that estate, is no sound arguing: It followeth not that a man is unregenerate, because he judged himself regenerate upon wrong grounds. For perhaps he might have better grounds, and not know it; or else not know which were good and which bad. Safety and Comfort stand not always on the same bottom. Bad grounds do prove the Assurance bad which was built upon them, but not always the Estate bad. These Teachers do but toss poor Souls up and down as the waves of the Sea, making them believe that their Estate is altered as oft as their conceits of it alter. Alas, few Christians do come to know either what are solid grounds of Comfort, or whether they have any such grounds themselves in the infancy of Christianity. But as an Infant hath life before he know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth it, and as he hath misapprehensions of himself and most other things for certain years together, and yet it will not follow that therefore he hath no life or reason: So is it in the case in hand. Yet this should perswade both Ministers and Believers themselves to lay right grounds for their Comfort in the beginning, as far as may be. For else usually when they find the flaw in their Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>forts and Assurance, they will judg it to be a flaw in their Safety and Real Estates. Just as I observe most persons do who turn to Errors or Heresies: They took up the Truth in the beginning upon either false or doubtful grounds; and then when their grounds are overthrown or shaken, they think the doctrine is also overthrown, and so they let go both together; as if None had solid Arguments, because They had not; or none could manage them better then They. Even so when they perceive that their Arguments for their good estate were unsound, they think that their Estate must needs be as unsound.</p>

One would think that a Soul that lieth under the fears of Wrath, and is so tender as to tremble and complain, should be as tender of sinning, and scarcely adventure upon the appearance of evil: And yet sad experience telleth us that it is frequently o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>therwise: I have known too many such, that would complain and yet sin, and accuse themselves, and yet sin still, yea and despair, and yet proceed in sinning; and all Arguments and means could not keep them from the wilful committing of that sin again and again, which yet they did think themselves would prove their destructi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on. Yea some will be carryed away with those sins which seem most contrary to their dejected temper. I have known them that would fill mens ears with the constant lamentations of their misera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble state, and despairing accusations against themselves, as if they had been the most humble people in the world; and yet be as passion<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ate in the maintaining their innocency when another accuseth them, and as intolerably peevish, and tender of their own reputa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion in any thing they are blamed for, as if they were the proudest persons on earth; still denying or extenuating every disgraceful fault that they are charged with.</p>
                        <p>This cherishing of sin doth hinder Assurance these four ways. 1. It doth abate the degree of our Graces, and so makes them more

undiscernable. 2. It obscureth that which it destroyeth not; for it beareth such sway, that Grace is not in Action, nor seen to stir, nor scarce heard speak for the noise of this Corruption. 3. It put<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth out or dimmeth the eye of the Soul, that it cannot see its own condition; and it benummeth and stupifieth that he cannot feel its own case. 4. But especially it provoketh God to withdraw himself, his Comforts and the Assistance of the Spirit, without which we may search long enough before we have Assurance. God hath made a separation betwixt Sin and Peace:<note place="margin">

Thou mayst steal a spark of false comfort from thy worldly prosperity or delights; or thou mayst have it from some false Opinions, or from the delusions of Satan: But from God thou wilt have no more Comfort, then thou makest Conscience of sinning.

So far as the Spirit is Grieved, he will suspend his Consolations. Assurance and Peace are Christ's great Encouragements to faithfulness and obedience: And therefore (though our Obedience do not Merit them, yet) they usually rise and fall with our Diligence in duty. They that have entertained the Antinomian dotages to cover their Idleness and Viciousness, may talk their non-sence against this at pleasure; but the laborious Christian knows it by experience. As prayer must have Faith and Fervency to procure its success, besides the Bloodshed and Interces<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sion of Christ, (<hi>Jam.</hi> 5.15, 16.) so must all other parts of our Obe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dience.

<q>Grace is never apparent and sensible to the Soul but while it is in Action:</q>
Therefore want of Action must needs cause want of Assurance: Habits are not felt immediately, but by the freeness and facility of their Acts: Of the very Being of the Soul it self, no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing is felt or perceived (if any more Be) but only its Acts. The fire that lyeth still in the flint is neither seen nor felt; but when you smite it, and force it into Act, it is easily discerned. The greatest Action doth force the greatest Observation; whereas the dead or unactive are not remembred or taken notice of. Those that have long lain still in their graves are out of mens thoughts as well as their sight; but those that walk their streets, and bear Rule among them, are noted by all. It is so with our Graces. That you have a
<pb n="413" facs="tcp:61132:240" rendition="simple:additions"/>
Habit of Love or Faith, you can no otherwise know but as a consequence by reasoning: but that you may have the Acts you may know by Feeling. If you see a man lie still in the way; what will you do to know whether he be drunk, or in a swoun, or dead? Will you not stir him or speak to him, to see whether he can go? Or feel his pulse, or observe his breath? Knowing that where there is life their is some kind of motion? I earnestly be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>seech thee, Christian, observe and practise this excellent Rule: Thou now knowest not whether thou have Repentance, or Faith, or Love, or joy: Why be more in the Acting of these, and thou wilt easily know it:<note place="margin">☜</note> Draw forth an Object for Godly sor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>row, or Faith, or Love, or Joy; and lay thy heart flat unto it, and take pains to provoke it into suitable action; and then see whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther thou have these Graces or no.

So long as a Christian hath his Graces in lively Action, so long, for the most part, he is assured of them. How can you doubt whether you love God in the Act of Loving? Or whether you believe in the very Act of Believing? If therefore you would be assured whether this Sacred Fire be kindled in your hearts, blow it up; get it into a fl<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

It is no more wonder for a Consciencious man that is overcome with Melancholly to doubt, and fear, and despair, then it is for a sick man to groan, or a child to cry when he is beater. This is the case with most that I have known lie long in doubting, and distress of Spirit.

this perturbing humour, all your convincing Arguments are for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gotten, and they are as far from comfort as ever they were. All the good thoughts of their estate which you can possibly help them to, are seldom above a day or two old. As a man that looks through a black or blew or red glass, doth think things which he sees to be of the same colour; and if you would perswade him to the contrary he will not believe you; but wonder that you should offer to perswade him against his eye-sight! So a Melan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cholly man sees all things in a sad and fearful plight, because his Reason looketh on them through this black humour, with which his brain is darkened and distempered. And as a mans eyes which can see all things about them, yet cannot see any imper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fection in themselves<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> so is it almost impossible to make many of these men to know that they are Melancholly.

If the Godly be mistaken in judging their state to be worse then it is, the consequents of this mistake will be very sad: But if the ungodly be mistaken, the Danger and Mischief that followeth is unspeakable.</p>
                        <p n="1">1. It will exceedingly confirm them in the service of Satan, and fasten them in their present way of death. They will never seek to be recovered, as long as they think their present state may serve. As the Prophet saith, Isa. 44.20. <hi>A deceived heart will turn them aside, that they cannot deliver their own soul, nor say, Is there not a lye in my right hand?</hi>

And there is no greater strengthener of sin, and destroyer of the soul, then Scripture misapplyed.
<q>Wordly delights, and the deceiving words of sinners, may harden men most desperately in an unsafe way: But Scripture misapplied, will do it far more effectually and dangerously.</q>

Though he be a sad object of pity to every understanding man that beholdeth him, yet will he not be able to pity himself, because he knoweth not his own misery. As I have seen a Physician lament the case of his Patient when he hath discerned his certain death in some small beginning, when the Patient himself feared nothing, because he knew not the mortal nature of his disease. So doth many a Minister or godly Christian lament the case of a carnal wretch, who is so far from lamenting it himself,<note place="margin">Acts 7.54.</note> that he scorns their pity, and biddeth them be sorry for themselves,<note place="margin">Acts 22.22.</note> they shall not answer for him; and taketh them for his enemies because they tell him the truth of his danger. As a man that seeth a beast going to the slaugh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter doth pity the poor creature, when it cannot pity it self because it little thinketh that death is so neer: So is it with these poor siners: and all long of this mistaking their Spiritual state. Is it not a pitiful sight to see a man laughing himself, when his understanding friends stand weeping for his misery? <hi>Paul</hi> mentioneth the voluptuous men of his time and the worldlings with weeping:<note place="margin">Phil. 3.17, 18.</note> but we never read of their weeping for themselves<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>

                           <hi>when they know not of any evil that was towards them,</hi> nor give him any thanks for his pity or his tears.</p>
                        <p n="4">4. It is in a case of greatest moment, and therefore mistaking must needs be most dangerous. If it were in making an ill bargain, yet we might repair our loss in the next:<note place="margin">

Sure in this weighty case, where our ever<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lasting Salvation or Damnation is in Question, and to be determined, every mistake is insufferable and inexcusable which might have been prevented by any cost or pains. Therefore men will chuse the most able Lawyers and Physicians, because the mis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>takes of one may lose them their Estates, and the mistakes of the other may lose them their lives: But mistakes about their Souls are of a higher nature.</p>

Mistake now, and you are undone for ever. Men think to see a man dye quietly or comfortably, is to see him dye happily: But if his comfort proceed from this mistake of his condition, it is the most unhappy case and pittiful sight in the world.

                        <p n="2">2. How sweet may every thought of Christ, and the blood that he hath shed, and the benefits he hath procured, be unto thee who hast got this Assurance? Then will the Name of a Saviour be a sweet Name; and the thoughts of his gentle and loving nature, and of the gracious design which he hath carried on for our Salvation, will be pleasing thoughts: Then will it do thee good to view his wounds by the eye of faith, and to put thy finger, as it were, into his side, when thou canst call him as <hi>Thomas</hi> did, <hi>My Lord, and my God!</hi>
                        </p>
                        <p n="3">3. Every passage also in the Word will then afford thee Comfort: How sweet will be the Promises when thou art sure they are thine own? The Gospel will then be Glad Tydings indeed. The very threatnings will occasion thy Comfort to remember that thou hast escaped them. Then thou wilt cry out with <hi>David, Oh how I love thy Law! It is sweeter then honey; More precious then gold, &amp;c.</hi> And as <hi>Luther, That thou wilt not take all the world for one leaf of the Bible.</hi> When thou wast in thy sin, this Book was to thee as <hi>Micaiah</hi> to <hi>Ahab</hi>; It never spoke Good of thee, but Evil;
<pb n="424" facs="tcp:61132:246"/>
and therefore no wonder if then thou didst hate it: But now it is the charter of thy <hi>Everlasting Rest,</hi> how welcom will it be to thee? and how beautiful the very feet of those that bring it?<note place="margin">Rom, 10.15.</note>
                        </p>
                        <p n="4">4. What boldness and comfort then mayst thou have in prayer? When thou canst say, <hi>Our Father,</hi> in full Assurance; and knowest that thou art welcom and accepted through Christ, and that thou hast a promise to be heard when ever thou askest, and knowest that God is readier to grant thy requests then thou to move them; With what comfortable boldness mayst thou then approach the Throne of Grace?<note place="margin">Heb. 10.22 19</note> Especially when the case is weighty, and thy necessity great, this Assurance in prayer will be a sweet priviledg indeed: A despairing Soul that feeleth the weight of Sin and Wrath, espe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cially at a dying hour, would give a large price to be partaker of this Priviledg, and to be sure that he might have Pardon and Life for the asking for.</p>
                        <p n="5">5. This Assurance will give the Sacrament a sweet relish to thy Soul, and make it a refreshing feast indeed.</p>
                        <p n="6">6. It will multiply the sweetness of every mercy thou receivest, when thou art sure that all proceeds from Love, and are the begin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nings and earnest of Everlasting Mercies: Thou wilt then have more comfort in a morsel of bread, then the world hath in the greatest abundance of all things.</p>
                        <p n="7">7. How comfortably then mayst thou undergo all Afflictions? When thou knowest that he meaneth thee no hurt in it, but hath promised that All shall work together for thy Good;<note place="margin">Rom. 8.28. Heb 12.6, 7. Psal. 75.76.</note> when thou art sure that he chasteneth thee, because he loveth thee, and scour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>geth thee, because thou art a Son whom he will receive, and that out of very faithfulness he doth afflict thee, What a support must this be to thy heart? and how will it abate the bitterness of the Cup? Even the Son of God himself doth seem to take comfort from this Assurance, when he was in a manner forsaken for our sins; and therefore he cries out, <hi>My God, my God, why hast thou forsaken me?</hi> And even the Prodigal under his guilt and misery doth take some Comfort in remembring that he hath a Father.</p>
                        <p n="8">8. This Assurance will sweeten to thee the fore-thoughts of death, and make thy heart glad to fore-think of that entrance into Joy;<note place="margin">Num 23.10.</note> when a man that is uncertain whither he is going, must needs dye with horror.</p>
                        <p n="9">9. It will sweeten also thy fore-thoughts of Judgment, when
<pb n="425" facs="tcp:61132:246"/>
thou art sure that it will be the day of thy absolution and Coro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nation.</p>
                        <p n="10">10. Yea the very thoughts of the flames of Hell will administer matter of Consolation to thee, when thou canst certainly conclude thou art saved from them.</p>
                        <p n="11">11. The fore-thoughts of Heaven also will be more incompara<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bly delightful, when thou art certain that it is the place of thine Everlasting abode.</p>
                        <p n="12">12. It will make thee exceeding lively and strong in the Work of the Lord: With what courage wilt thou run, when thou knowest thou shalt have the prize? and fight, when thou knowest thou shalt conquer?<note place="margin">1 Cor. 15.58.</note> It will make thee always abound in the work of the Lord, when thou knowest that thy labour is not in vain.</p>
                        <p n="13">13. It will also make thee more profitable to others. Thou wilt be a most chearful encourager of them from thine own experience. Thou wilt be able to refresh the weary, and to strengthen the weak, and speak a word of Comfort in season to the troubled Soul: Whereas now without Assurance, in stead of comforting others, thou wilt rather have need of support thy self: So that others are losers by thy Uncertainty as well as thy self.</p>
                        <p n="14">14. Assurance will put life into all thy Affections or Graces. 1. It will help thee to Repent and melt over thy sins, when thou know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>est how dearly God did Love thee whom thou hast abused. 2. It will enflame thy Soul with Love to God, when thou once knowest thy near Relation to him,<note place="margin">Psal. 116.1. &amp; 18.1, 2.</note> and how tenderly he is affected toward thee. 3. It will quicken thy desires after him, when thou art once sure of thy Interest in him. 4. It is the most excellent Fountain of Continual Rejoycing,<note place="margin">1 Thes 4.17, 18</note> 
                           <hi>Hab.</hi>

                           </gap>.17, 18, 19. 5. It will confirm thy Trust and Confidence in God in the greatest straits, <hi>Psal.</hi> 89.26. and 46.1, 2, 3, &amp;c. 6. It will fill thy heart with Thankfulness. 7. It will raise thee in the high delightful work of Praise.<note place="margin">Psal. 118.28. Isai 25.1.</note> 8. It will be the most excellent help to a Heavenly Mind. 9. It will exceed<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ingly tend to thy Perseverance in all this. He that is sure of the Crown will hold on to the End, when others will be tired and give up through discouragement.</p>
                        <p>All these sweet effects of Assurance would make thy Life a kind of Heaven on Earth. Seeing then that Examination of our states is the way to this Assurance, and the Means without which God doth not usually bestow it, doth it not Concern us to fall close to this Searching Work?</p>

And though I am certain that these Motives have weight of Reason in them, yet experience of mens unreasonableness in things of this Nature, doth make me Jealous, lest you should lay by the Book when you have read all this, as if you had done, and never set your selves to the practise of the duty. Reader, Thou seest the Case in hand is of greatest moment: It is to know, Whether thou shalt Everlastingly live in Heaven or Hell? If thou hast lived hitherto in dark uncertainty, it is a pitiful case: but if thou wilfully continue so, thy Madness is unexpressible: And is it not wilfully, when a through Tryal might help thee to be Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>solved, and thou wilt not be perswaded to be at so much pains? What sayst thou now? Art thou fully resolved to fall upon the Work? Shall all this labour that I have bestowed in perswading thee be lost, or no? If thou wilt not obey, I would thou hadst ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver read these lines, that they might not have aggravated thy guilt, and silenced thee in Judgment. I here put this special Request to thee in behalf of thy Soul; nay I lay this charge upon thee in the Name of the Lord, That thou defer no longer, but take the next op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portunity that thou canst have, and take thy Heart to task in good earnest, and think with thy self, Is it so Easie, so Common, and so Dangerous to be Mistaken?

And do I not presently fall on Try<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing my self? Why what a case were I in if I should then miscarry? May I know by a little diligent Enquiry now? and do I stick at the labour? And here set thy self to the duty.— <hi>Object.</hi> But it may be thou wilt say, I know not how to do it. <hi>Ans.</hi> That is the next Work that I come to, to give thee Directions herein: but, alas, it will be in Vain if thou be not resolved to practise them. Wilt thou therefore before thou goest any further here promise be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore the Lord, to set thy self (to thy power) upon the speedy per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>forming of the duty according to these Directions which I shall lay down from the Word? I demand nothing unreasonable or im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>possible
<pb n="427" facs="tcp:61132:247"/>
of thee: It is but That thou wouldst presently bestow a few hours time, to know what shall become of thee for ever. If a neighbor, or common friend, desire but an hours time of thee, in conference, or in labour, or any thing that thou mayst help them in, thou wouldst not sure deny it: How much less shouldst thou deny this to thy self in so great a Case? I pray thee take this request from me, as if upon my knees in the Name of Christ I did prefer it to thee: And I will betake me upon my knees to Christ again, to beg that he will perswade thy heart to the Duty: And in hope that thou wilt practise them, I will here give thee some Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rections.</p>

                           <note place="margin">§. 1.</note>
                           <seg rend="decorInit">I</seg> Will not stand here to lay down the Directions neces<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sary for preparation to this Duty, because you may gather them from what is said concerning the Hinder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ances: For the Contraries of those Hinderances will be most necessary Helps. Only before you set upon it, I advise you moreover to the Observation of these Rules. 1. Come not with too peremptory Conclusions of your selves be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore-hand. Do not Judg too confidently before you Try. Many Godly dejected Souls come with this Pre-judging to the work, concluding certainly that their state is Miserable before they have Tryed it: And most wicked men on the contrary side do conclude most confidently that their state is good, or tolerable at the least. No wonder if these both miscarry in Judging, when they pass the Sentence before the Tryal.</p>
                        <p n="2">2. Be sure to be so well acquainted with the Scripture, as to know what is the Tenor of the Covenant of Grace, and what are the Conditions of Justification and Glorification, and consequently what are sound Marks to Try thy self by, and wherein the Truth of Grace, and Essence of Christianity doth consist.</p>
                        <p n="3">3. And it will not be unuseful to write out some of the chief and those Scriptures withall which hold them forth, and so to bring this Paper with you when you come to Examination.</p>
                        <p n="4">4. Be a constant observer of the temper and motions of thy heart:
<pb n="429" facs="tcp:61132:250" rendition="simple:additions"/>
Almost all the difficulty of the work doth lie in the true and clear discerning of it. Be watchful in observing the Actings both of Grace and Corruption; and the circumstances of their Actings; as how frequent? how violent? how strong or weak were the outward incitements? how great or small the impediments? what delight, or loathing, or fear, or reluctancy, did go with those Acts? by these and the like observations you may come to a more infallible knowledg of your selves.</p>
                        <p n="5">5. Be sure you set upon the work with a serious, rouzed, waken<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed Soul, apprehensive of how great concernment it is.</p>
                        <p n="6">6. And lastly, Resolve to judg thy self impartially; neither bet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter nor worse then thou art, but as the Evidence shall prove thee.</p>

                        <p>BEing thus provided,<note place="margin">§. 2.</note> then set to the business: and therein ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>serve these Directions following; (which I will mention briefly, that lying close together, you may be able to view and ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>serve them the more easily.)</p>
                        <p n="1">1. Empty thy minde of all thy other cares and thoughts, that they do not distract or divide thy mind: This work will be enough at once of it self, without joyning others with it.</p>
                        <p n="2">2. Then fall down before God, and in hearty prayer desire the assistance of his Spirit, to discover to thee the plain truth of thy Condition; and to enlighten thee in thy whole progress in the work.</p>
                        <p n="3">3. Make choyce of the most convenient Time and Place. I shall not stand upon the particular Directions about these, because I shall mention them more largely when I come to direct you in the duty of Contemplation: Only thus in brief. 1. Let the Place be the most private, that you may be free from distractions. 2. For the Time, thus. 1. When you are most solitary and at leasure: You cannot cast accounts, especially of such a nature as these, either in a croud of company, or of imployments. 2. Let it be a set and cho<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                              <desc>•</desc>
                           </gap>en Time, when you have nothing to hinder you. 3. But, if it may be, let it be the present Time, especially if thou have been a stranger hitherto to the work. There is no delaying in matters of such weight. 4. Especially when you have a more special call to search
<pb n="430" facs="tcp:61132:251"/>
your selves: as in publique calamities, in time of sickness, before Sacrament, &amp;c. 5. When God is Trying you by some Affliction, and (as <hi>Job</hi> saith) is searching after your sin,<note place="margin">Job 10.6.</note> then set in with him, and search after them your selves. 6. Lastly, You should specially take such a Time when you are most fit for the work: when you are not secure and stupid on one hand; nor yet under deep deserti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons or Melancholly on the other hand: for else you will be unfit Judges of your own states.</p>
                        <p n="4">4. When you have thus chosen the fittest Time and Place, then draw forth, either from thy Memory, or in writing, the foremen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tioned Marks, or Gospel-Conditions, or Descriptions of the Saints: Try them by Scripture, and convince thy Soul throughly of their infallible Truth.</p>
                        <p n="5">5. Proceed then to put the Question to thy self: But be sure to state it right. Let it not be, Whether there be any Good in thee at all? (for so thou wilt err on the one hand:) Nor yet, Whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther thou have such or such a degree and measure of Grace? (for so thou wilt err on the other hand:) But, Whether such or such a Saving Grace be in thee at all in sincerity, or not?</p>
                        <p n="6">6. If thy heart draw back, and be loath to the work; suffer it not so to give thee the slip: but force it on: Lay thy command upon it: let Reason interpose, and use its authority: Look over the fore-going Arguments, and press them home: Yea, lay the Command of God upon it; and charge it to obey upon pain of his displeasure: Set Conscience a work also: let it do its office, till thy lazy heart be spurred up to the work: For if thou suffer it to break away once and twice, &amp;c. it will grow so head-strong, that thou canst not master it.</p>
                        <p n="7">7. Let not thy Heart trifle away the Time, when it should be diligently at the work: Put the Question to it seriously: Is it thus and t<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                              <desc>•</desc>
                           </gap>us with me, or no? Force it here to an Answer: suffer it not to be silent: nor to jangle and think of other matters: If the Question be hard, through the darkness of thy Heart; yet do not give it over so: but search the closer: and study the case the more exactly: And if it be possible, let not thy Heart give over, till it have Resolved the Question, and told thee off or on, in what case thou art: Ask it strictly (as <hi>Joseph</hi> examined his Brethren, <hi>Gen.</hi> 43.7.) how it stands affected: Do as <hi>David, Psal.</hi> 77.6. <hi>My spirit made Diligent Search:</hi> If thy Heart strive to break away
<pb n="431" facs="tcp:61132:251" rendition="simple:additions"/>
before thou art resolved; wrestle with it, till thou hast prevailed, and say, I will not let thee go, till thou hast Answered. He that can prevail with his own Heart, shall also be a prevailer with God.</p>
                        <p n="8">8. If thou finde the work beyond thy strength, so that after all thy pains thou art never the more resolved; then seek out for help: Go to some that is Godly, experienced, able, and faithful; and tell him thy case, and desire his best advice and help. Not that any can know thy heart, so well as thy self: But if thou deal faith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fully, and tell him what thou knowest by thy self; he can tell thee whether they be sound Evidences, or not; and shew thee Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture how to prove them so; and direct thee in the right use of such Evidences; and shew thee how to conclude from them. Yea, when thou canst get no further, the very Judgment of an able Godly man should take much with thee, as a probable Argument; as the Judgment of a Physician concerning the state of thy body: Though this can afford thee no full certainty, yet it may be a great help to stay and direct thee. But be sure thou do not make this a pretence to put off thy own duty of Examining: But onely use it as one of the last remedies, when thou findest thy own endevors will not serve. Neither be thou forward to open thy case to every one: or to a carnal, flattering, unskilful person: But to one that hath wisdom to conceal thy secrets, and tenderness to compassi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>onate thee, and skill to direct thee, and faithfulness to deal truly and plainly with thee.</p>
                        <p n="9">9. When by all this pains and means thou hast discovered the truth of thy state, then pass the Sentence on thy self accordingly. A meer examination will do thee little good, if it proceed not to a Judgment. Conclude as thou findest: Either that thou art a true Beleever: or that thou art not. But pass not this Sentence rashly; nor with self-flattery, nor from Melancholly terrors and fears: But do it groundedly and deliberately; and truly as thou findest, according to thy Conscience. Do not conclude, as some do, [<hi>I am a good Christian,</hi>] or as others do, [<hi>I am a Reprobate, or a Hypocrite, and shall be damned,</hi>] when thou hast no ground for what thou sayst, but thy own fancy, or hopes, or fears; nay, when thou art convinced by Scripture and Reason of the contrary; and hast nothing to say against the Arguments. Let not thy Judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment be any way by assed, or bribed; and so fore-stalled from sen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tencing aright.</p>
                        <p n="10">
                           <pb n="432" facs="tcp:61132:252"/>10. Labor to get thy heart kindly Affected with its discovered condition, according to the sentence passed on it. Do not think it enough to know: but labor to feel, what God hath made thee see. If thou finde thy self undoubtedly graceless, Oh get this to thy heart; and think what a doleful Condition it is: To be an Enemy to God! to be unpardoned! unsanctified! and if thou shouldst so dye, to be Eternally damned! One would think such a thought should make a heart of stone to quake! On the contrary: If thou finde thy self renewed and sanctified indeed; Oh get this warm and close to thy heart. Bethink thy self; What a blessed state the Lord hath brought thee into! To be his Childe! his Friend! to be pardoned, justified, and sure to be saved! Why what needest thou fear? but sinning against him? Come war, or plague, or sickness, or death, thou art sure they can but thrust thee into Heaven.</p>
                        <p>Thus follow these <hi>Meditations,</hi> till they have left their impres<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sion on thy heart.</p>
                        <p n="11">11. Be sure to Record this Sentence, so passed, write it down: or at least write it in thy Memory: At such a time upon through Examination, I found my state to be thus or thus: This Record will be very useful to thee hereafter. If thou be ungodly: what a damp will it be to thy presumption and security, to go and read the Sentence of thy Misery under thy own hand? If thou be god<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly: what a help will it be against the next Temptation to doubt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing and fear, to go and read under thy hand this Record? Mayst thou not think; If at such a time I found the Truth of Grace, is it not likely to be now the same? and these my doubts to come from the Enemy of my Peace?</p>
                        <p n="12">12. Yet would I not have thee so trust to once discovery, as to Try no more: Especially if thou have made any foul Defection from Christ, and play'd the backslider; See then that thou renew the Search again.</p>
                        <p n="13">13. Neither would I have this hinder thee in the dayly Search of thy ways; or of thy increase in Grace, and fellowship with Christ: It is an ill sign, and desperate vile sin, for a man when he thinks he hath found himself Gracious, and in a happy state, to let down his watch, and grow negligent of his heart and ways, and scarce look after them any more.</p>
                        <p n="14">14. Neither would I have thee give over in discouragement, if
<pb n="433" facs="tcp:61132:252" rendition="simple:additions"/>
thou canst not at once or twice, or ten times trying, discover thy Case: But follow it on till thou hast discovered.

                        <p n="15">15. Lastly, above all take heed, if thou finde thy self to be yet unregenerate, that thou do not conclude of thy Future estate by thy present: nor say, Because I am ungodly, I shall dye so: or be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause I am an Hypocrite, I shall continue so. No: thou hast ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther work to do: And that is, To resolve presently to cleave to Christ, and break off thy Hypocrisie, and thy Wickedness. If thou finde that thou hast been all this while out of the way, do not sit down in despair; but make so much the more haste to turn into it. If thou have been an Hypocrite, or ungodly person all thy life, yet is the promise offered thee by Christ; and he tendereth him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>self to be thy Lord and Saviour: Neither canst thou possibly be so Willing to Accept of him, as he is to Accept thee. Nothing but thy own unwillingness can keep thy Soul from Christ, though thou hast hitherto abused him, and dissembled with him.</p>
                        <p>
                           <hi>Object.</hi> But if I have gone so far, and been a professor so long, and yet finde my self an Hypocrite now after all; what hope is there that I should now become sincere? <hi>Answ.</hi> Dost thou hear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tily Desire to be Sincere? Thy Sincerity doth lie especially in thy Will: As long as thou art unwilling, I confess thy case is sad: But if thou be willing to receive Christ as he is offered to thee, and so to be a Christian indeed, then thou art sincere. Neither hath Christ restrained his Spirit, or Promises, to any set time; or said to thee, Thou shalt finde grace, if thou sin but so much, or so long: But if thou be heartily Willing at any time, I know not who can hin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der thy happiness. (Yet is this no diminution of the sin or danger of delaying.)</p>
                        <p>Thus I have given you these Directions for Examination; which conscionably practised, will be of singular advantage and use to discover your states: But it is not the bare reading of them that will do it. I fear, of many that will approve of this advice, there will but few be brought to use it. However, those that are will<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, may finde help by it: and the rest will be left more unexcuse<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able in Judgment.</p>

                           <note place="margin">§. 3.</note>I Will not digress further to warn you here of the false Rules and Marks of Tryal which you must beware, having opened them to you fullier when I preached on that subject. But I will briefly adjoyn some Marks to try thy Title to this Rest, by: refer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring you for a fuller discovery to the Description of the People of God in the first part of the Book. But be sure you search through<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, and deal plainly, or else you will but lose your labor, and deceive your selves.</p>
                        <p n="1">1. Every Soul that hath Title to this Rest, doth place his chiefest Happiness in it;<note place="margin">
                              <hi>Mark</hi> 1.</note> and make it the chief and ultimate End of his Soul. This is the first Mark: which is so plain a Truth, that I need not stand to prove it. For this Rest consisteth in the full and glori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous enjoyment of God: And he that maketh not God his chief Good, and ultimate End, is in heart a Pagan and vile Idolater; and doth not take the Lord for his God.</p>
                        <p>Let me ask thee then; Dost thou truly in Judgment and Affecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on account it thy chiefest Happiness to enjoy the Lord in Glory? or dost thou not? Canst thou say with <hi>David, Psal.</hi> 16.5. <hi>The Lord is my Portion?</hi>
                           <note place="margin">Psal. 119.57. &amp; 142.5<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> Lam. 3<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> 24.</note> And as <hi>Psa.</hi> 73.25. <hi>Whom have I in Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven but thee? and whom in earth that I desire in comparison of thee?</hi> If thou be an heir of Rest, it is thus with thee. Though the flesh will be pleading for its own delights, and the world will be creeping into thine affections, and thou canst not be quite freed from the Love of it; Yet in thy ordinary, setled, prevailing Judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment and Affections, thou preferrest God before all things in the world. 1. Thou makest him the End of thy Desires and Ende<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vors: The very reason why thou hearest and prayest, why thou de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sirest to live and breathe on earth, is chiefly this, That thou mayst seek the Lord, and make sure of thy Rest. Thou seekest first the Kingdom of God, and its Righteousness: Though thou dost not seek it so desirously and zealously as thou shouldst; yet hath it the chief of thy desires and endevors; and nothing else is desired or preferred before it: <hi>Mat.</hi> 6.33. So that thy very heart is thus far set upon it: <hi>Mat.</hi> 6.21. <hi>Col.</hi> 3.1, 2, 3.</p>
                        <p n="2">2. Also thou wilt think no labor or suffering too great to obtain it. And though the flesh may sometime shrink or draw back, yet
<pb n="435" facs="tcp:61132:253" rendition="simple:additions"/>
art thou resolved and content to go through all. <hi>Mat.</hi> 7.13. 2 <hi>Tim.</hi> 2.5. <hi>Rom.</hi> 8.17. <hi>Luk.</hi> 14.26, 27. 2 <hi>Tim.</hi> 2.12. <hi>Luk.</hi> 14.24.</p>
                        <p n="3">3. Also if thou be an heir of Rest, thy valuation of it will be so high, and thy affection to it so great, that thou wouldst not ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>change thy Title to it, and hopes of it, for any worldly Good what<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>soever. Indeed when the Soul is in doubts of enjoying it, perhaps it may possibly desire rather the continuance of an earthly happi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness, then to depart out of the body with fears of going to Hell. But if he were sure that Heaven should be his own, he would de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sire to depart and to be with Christ, as being the best st<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                           </gap>te of all. And if God would set before him an Eternity of Earthly pleasures and contents on one hand, and the Rest of the Saints on the other hand, and bid him take his choyce; he would refuse the world, and chuse this Rest: <hi>Psal.</hi> 16.9, 10. <hi>Rom.</hi> 8.23. 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 5.2, 3. <hi>Phil.</hi> 3.20. Thus if thou be a Christian indeed, thou takest God for thy chiefest Good, and this Rest for the most amiable and desireable state: and by the foresaid means thou mayst discover it.</p>
                        <p>But if thou be yet in the flesh, and an unsanctified wretch, then is it clean contrary with thee in all these respects: Then dost thou in thy Heart prefer thy worldly happiness and fleshly delights be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore God: And though thy tongue may say, that God is the chief Good, yet thy Heart doth not so esteem him. For, 1. The world is the chief End of thy Desires and Endevors. Thy very heart is set upon it. Thy greatest Care and Labor is to maintain thy estate, or credit, or fleshly delights: But the life to come hath little of thy care or labor. Thou didst never perceive so much excellency in that unseen Glory of another world, as to draw thy heart so after it, or set thee a laboring so heartily for it. But that little pains which thou bestowest that way, it is but in the second place, and not the first: God hath but the worlds leavings; and that time and labor which thou canst spare from the world; or those few cold and careless thoughts which follow thy constant, earnest and delight<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful thoughts of earthly things: Neither wouldst thou do any thing at all for Heaven, if thou knew'st how to keep the world: But lest thou shouldst be turned into Hell when thou canst keep the world no longer, therefore thou wilt do something.</p>
                        <p n="2">2. Therefore it is that thou thinkest the way of God too strict; and wilt not be perswaded to the constant labor of conscionable walking according to the Gospel rule: And when it comes to
<pb n="436" facs="tcp:61132:254"/>
tryal, that thou must forsake Christ or thy worldly happiness, and the wind which was in thy back doth turn in thy face, then thou wilt venture Heaven rather then Earth, and (as desperate Rebels use to say) thou wilt rather trust Gods Mercy for thy Soul, then mans for thy body; and so wilfully deny thy obedience to God.</p>
                        <p n="3">3. And certainly if God would but give thee leave to live in health and wealth for ever on Earth, thou wouldst think it a better state then Rest: Let them seek for Heaven that would, thou wouldst think this thy chiefest happiness. This is thy case if thou be yet an unregenerate person, and hast no Title to the Saints Rest.</p>

                        <p>As thou takest God for thy chief Good, so [<hi>Thou dost heartily accept of Christ for thy onely Saviour and Lord to bring thee to this Rest</hi>].<note place="margin">
                              <hi>Mark</hi> 3.</note> The former Mark was the sum of the first and great Command of the Law of Nature, [<hi>Thou shalt Love the Lord with all thy heart, or above all.</hi>] This second Mark is the sum of the Command or Condition of the Gospel, which saith, [<hi>Beleeve in the Lord Jesus, and thou shalt be saved.</hi>] And the performance of these two is the whole sum or essence of Godliness and Christiani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty. Observe therefore the parts of this Mark, which is but a De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>finition of Faith. 1. Dost thou finde that thou art naturally a lost condemned man for thy breach of the first Covenant? and dost be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leeve that Jesus Christ is the Mediator who hath made a sufficient satisfaction to the Law? and hearing in the Gospel that he is offer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed without exception unto all, dost heartily consent that he alone shall be thy Saviour? and dost no further trust to thy Duties and works, then as conditions required by him, and means appointed in subordination to him? not looking at them as in the least mea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sure able to satisfie the Curse of the Law, or as a Legal Righteous<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness, nor any part of it? But art content to trust thy Salvation on the Redemption made by Christ?</p>
                        <p n="2">2. Art thou also content to Take him for thy onely Lord and
<pb n="437" facs="tcp:61132:254" rendition="simple:additions"/>
King? to govern and guide thee by his Laws and Spirit? And to obey him even when he commandeth the hardest duties? and those which most cross the desires of the flesh? Is it thy sorrow when thou breakest thy resolution herein? and thy Joy when thou keep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>est closest in obedience to him? And though the world and flesh do sometime entice and over reach thee, yet is it thy ordinary De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sire and Resolution to Obey? So that thou wouldst not change thy Lord and Master for all the world? Thus it is, with every true Christian. But if thou be an Hypocrite, it is far otherwise. Thou mayst call Christ thy Lord and thy Saviour: But thou never found<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>est thy self so lost without him, as to drive thee to seek him and trust him, and lay thy Salvation on him alone. Or at least thou didst never heartily consent that he should Govern thee as thy Lord; nor didst resign up thy Soul and Life to be Ruled by him; nor takest his Word for the Law of thy Thoughts and Actions. It is like thou art content to be saved from Hell by Christ when thou dyest: But in the mean time he shall command thee no further then will stand with thy credit, or pleasure, or worldly estate and ends. And if he would give thee leave, thou hadst far rather live after the world and flesh, then after the Word and Spirit. And though thou mayst now and then have a Motion or Purpose to the contrary; yet this that I have mentioned is the ordinary desire and choyce of thy heart: And so thou art no true Beleever in Christ: For though thou con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fess him in words, yet in works thou dost deny him, being dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>obedient, and to every Good Work a Disapprover and a Repro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bate, <hi>Tit.</hi> 1.16. This is the Case of those that shall be shut out of the Saints Rest.</p>
                        <p>But especially I would here have you observe, That it is in all this the Consent of your Hearts or Wills which I lay down in this Mark to be enquired after: For that is the most essential Act of Justifying Faith. Therefore I do not ask, whether thou be Assured of Salvation: nor yet whether thou canst beleeve that thy sins are pardoned, and that thou art beloved of God in Christ: These are no parts of Justifying Faith; but excellent fruits and consequents, which they that do receive, are comforted by them: but perhaps thou mayst never receive them whilest thou livest, and yet be a true heir of Rest. Do not say then, I cannot beleeve that my sin is par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>doned, or that I am in Gods favor, and therefore I am no true Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leever: This is a most mistaking conclusion. The Question is,
<pb n="438" facs="tcp:61132:255"/>
Whether thou canst heartily Accept of Christ that thou mayst be pardoned, reconciled to God, and so saved? Dost thou Consent that he shall be thy Lord who hath bought thee? and take his own course to bring thee to Heaven? This is Justifying Saving Faith; and this is the Mark that thou must try thy self by. Yet still observe, That all this Consent must be Hearty and Real: not feigned, or with reservations. It is not saying, as that dissembling son, <hi>Matt.</hi> 21.30. <hi>I go sir, when he went not:</hi> To say, Christ shall be my Lord, and yet let corruption ordinarily rule thee; or be unwilling that his Commands should encroach upon the interest of the world or flesh. If any have more of the Government of thee then Christ; or if thou hadst rather live after any other Laws then his, if it were at thy choyce, thou art not his Disciple. Thus I have layd you down these two Marks, which I am sure are such as every Christian hath, and no other but sincere Christians. I will add no more, seeing the substance of Christianity is contained in these. Oh that the Lord would now perswade thee to the close perform<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance of this Self-trying Task! That thou mayst not tremble with horror of Soul when the Judg of all the World shall try thee: but have thy Evidence and Assurance so ready at hand, and be so able to prove thy Title to Rest, that the thoughts and approaching of Death and Judgment, may revive thy spirits, and fill thee with Joy, and not apale thee, and fill thee with amazement!</p>

Even so is it with us when God is afflicting us. He giveth us Reasons why we must bear them; so that our Reason is oft convinced and satisfied: And yet we cry and complain still; and we rest satisfied never the more. It is not Reason, but Ease that we must have: What cares the flesh for Scripture and Argument, if it still suffer and smart? These be but winde and words, which do not remove or abate its pain. Spiritual remedies may cure the spirits maladies; but that will not content the flesh. But methinks Christians should have another pallate then that of the flesh, to try and relish providences by: God hath purposely given them the Spirit, to subdue and over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rule the flesh. And therefore I shall here give them some Reasons of Gods dealing in their present sufferings, whereby the equity and mercy therein may appear: And they shall be onely such as are drawn from the reference that these afflictions have to our Rest; which being a Christians Happiness, and ultimate End, will direct him in judging of all estates and means.</p>

A Christians Motion Heaven-wards is Voluntary, and not constrained. Those means therefore are most profitable to him, which help his Understanding and Will in this prosecution. The most dangerous mistake that our Souls are capable of, is, to take the Creature for God, and Earth for Heaven. And yet, alass, how common is this? And in how great a degree are the best guilty of it? Though we are ashamed to speak so much with our tongues, yet how oft do our hearts say, <hi>It is best being here?</hi> And
<pb n="442" facs="tcp:61132:257"/>
how contented are they with an earthly portion? So that I fear God would displease most of us more, to afflict us here, and promise us Rest hereafter, then to give us our hearts desire on earth, though he had never made us a promise of Heaven. As if the Creature without God, were better, then God without the Creature. Alass, how apt are we, like foolish children, when we are busie at our sports and worldly employments, to forget both our Father, and our home? Therefore is it a hard thing for a Rich man to enter into Heaven, because it is hard for him to value it more then Earth, and not to think he is well already. Come to a man that hath the world at will, and tell him, <hi>This is not Your Happiness; You have higher things to look after</hi>; and how little will he regard you! But when Affliction comes, it speaks convincingly; and will be heard when Preachers cannot. What warm, affectionate, eager thoughts have we of the world, till Affliction cool them, and mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derate them? How few and cold would our thoughts of Heaven be, how little should we care for coming thither, if God would give us Rest on Earth? Our thoughts are with God, as <hi>Noahs</hi> Dove was in the Ark; kept up to him a little against their inclinations and desires: but when once they can break away, they fly up and down over all the world, to see if it were possible to finde any Rest out of God: But when we finde that we seek in vain, and that the world is all covered with the waters of instable vanity and bitter vexation, and that there is no Rest for the sole of our foot, or for the foot of our Soul; no wonder then if we return to the Ark again. Many a poor Christian (whom God will not suffer to be drowned in worldliness, nor to take up short of his Rest) is sometime bending his thoughts to thrive in wealth; sometime he is enticed to some flesh-pleasing sin; sometime he begins to be lifted up with applause; and sometime being in health and prosperity, he hath lost his relish of Christ, and the Joys above: Till God break in upon his riches, and scatter them abroad, or upon his children, or upon his consci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence, or upon the health of his body, and break down his mount which he thought so strong:<note place="margin">Psa. 30.6, 7.</note> And then when he lieth in <hi>Manass<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="2 letters">

Alas, if we did not sometime feel the spur, what a slow pace would most of us hold toward Heaven? and if we did not sometimes smart by Affliction, how dead and blockish would be the best mens hearts?

<pb n="446" facs="tcp:61132:259"/>
Reason have we to be so tender of it? In most of our sufferings the Soul is free, further then we do wilfully afflict it our selves. Suppose thou be in poverty: It is thy flesh only that is pinched. If thou have sores or sicknesses: it is but the flesh that they assault. If thou dye: it is but that flesh that must rot in the grave. Indeed it useth also to reach our hearts and Souls, when the body suffereth: but that is, because we pore upon our evils, and too much pity and condole the flesh; and so we open the door, and let in the pain to the heart our selves, which else could have gone no further then the flesh. God smites the flesh; and therefore we will grieve our spirits: and so multiply our grief, as if we had not enough before. Oh, if I could but have let my body have suffered alone in all the pining, paining sicknesses which God laid upon it, and not have foolishly added my own self-tormenting fears, and cares, and sorrows, and discontents; but have quieted and comforted my Soul in the Lord my Rock and Rest; I had escaped the far greater part of the Afflictions. Why is this flesh so precious in our eyes? Why are we so tender of these dusty carcasses? Is flesh so excellent a thing? Is it not our prison? and what if it be broken down? Is it not our Enemy? yea and the greatest that ever we had? and are we so fearful lest it be overthrown? Is it not it that hath so long hampered and clog'd our Souls? and tyed them to earth? and ticed them to forbidden lusts and pleasures? and stoln away our hearts from God? Was it not it that longed for the first forbidden fruit? and must needs be tasting, what ever it cost? And still it is of the same temper: It must be pleased, though God be displeased by it, and our selves destroyed. It maketh all Gods mercies the occasion of our transgressing, and draweth poyson from the most excellent objects. If we behold our food, it inticeth to gluttony; if drink, to drunkenness; if ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parel, or any thing of worth, to pride: if we look upon beauty, it ticeth to lust; if upon money or possessions, to Covetousness. It causeth our very spiritual love to the godly, to degenerate into carnal; and our spiritual Zeal, and Joy, and other graces: It would make all carnal like it self. What are we beholden to this flesh for, that we are so loath that any thing should ail it? Indeed we must not wrong it our selves; for that is forbidden us: Nor may we deny it any thing that is fit for a Servant; that so it may be use<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful to us, while we are forced to make use of it. But if God cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stise
<pb n="447" facs="tcp:61132:259" rendition="simple:additions"/>
it for rebelling against him and the Spirit, and it begin to cry and complain under this chastisement, shall we make the suffering greater then it is, and take its part against God? Indeed the Flesh is very near to us; we cannot chuse but condole its sufferings, and feel somewhat of that which it feeleth. But is it so near as to be our chiefest part? Or cannot it be sore, but we must be so sorry? or cannot it consume and pine away, but our peace and comfort must consume with it? What if it be undone? are we therefore undone? or if it perish and be destroyed, do We therefore perish? Oh fie upon this carnality and unbelief, which is so contradictory to the principles of Christianity! Surely God dealeth the worse with this Flesh, because we so over-value and Idolize it. We make it the greatest part of our care and labour to provide for it, and to satisfie its desires; and we would have God to be of our mind<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> and to do so too. But as he hath commanded us, to <hi>make no provision for the flesh, to fulfil the desires or lusts thereof,</hi> (<hi>Rom.</hi> 13.14) So will he follow the same rule himself in his dealings with us; and will not much stick at the displeasing of the flesh, when it may honour himself, or profit our Souls. The flesh is aware of this; and perceives that the Word and Works of God are much against its desires and delights;<note place="margin">1 Kings 22. 8.</note> and therefore is it also against the Word and Works of God: It saith of the Word (as <hi>Ahab</hi> of <hi>Micaiah,</hi>) <hi>I hate it, for it doth not speak good concerning me, but evil.</hi> There is such an Enmity betwixt this flesh and God, That <hi>they that are in the flesh cannot please him:</hi> and <hi>the carnal mind is Enmity against him; for it is not subject to his Law, nor indeed can be:</hi> So inconsistent is the pleasing of the flesh, and the pleasing of GOD; That he hath concluded, That <hi>to minde the things of the flesh, or to be carnally minded, is Death; and if we live after the flesh, we shall dye; but if by the Spirit we mortifie the deeds of the body, we shall live,</hi> Rom. 8. vers. 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 13.</p>
                        <p>So that there is no likelihood, that ever Gods dealings should be pleasing to the flesh; no more then its works are pleasing to God. Why then (O my Soul) dost thou side with this Flesh? and say as it saith, and complain as it complaineth? It should be part of thine own work to keep it down, and bring it in subjecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on: and if God do it for thee,<note place="margin">1 Cor. 9.26, 27.</note> shouldst thou be discontented?

It maketh us afraid of our dearest friends; and to draw back from the place of our only happiness. So was it with thee towards thy chiefest friends on earth: While thou wast unacquainted with them, thou didst withdraw from
<pb n="449" facs="tcp:61132:260" rendition="simple:additions"/>
their society: but when thou didst once know them throughly, thou wouldst have been loath again to be deprived of their fellow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ship. And even so, though thy strangeness to God &amp; another world, do make thee loath to leave this flesh; yet when thou hast been but one day or hour there, (if we may so speak of that Eternity, where is neither day nor hour) thou wouldst be full loath to return into this flesh again. Doubtless when God, for the Glory of his Son, did send back the Soul of <hi>Lazarus</hi> into its body, he caused it quite to forget the Glory which it had enjoyed, and to leave behind it the remembrance of that happiness, together with the happiness it self: Or else it might have made his life a burden to him, to think of the blessedness that he was fetched from: and have made him ready to break down the prison doors of his flesh, that he might return to that happy state again. Oh then impatient Soul! murmur not at Gods dealings with that body; but let him alone with his work and way. He knows what he doth; but so dost not thou: He seeth the End; but thou seest but the beginning. If it were for want of love to thee, that he did thus chastise thy body, then would he not have dealt so by all his Saints. Dost thou not think he did not love <hi>David,</hi> and <hi>Paul,</hi> or Christ him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>self? Or rather doth he not chasten because he loveth? and scourgeth every Son whom he receiveth? <hi>Heb.</hi> 12.4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11. Believe nor the Fleshes reports of God, nor its commen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taries upon his Providences. It hath neither Will nor Skill to inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pret them aright:<note place="margin">Mat. 16.23. Rom. 8 6, 7, 8. 1 Cor. 2.10, 11, 12, 13, 14.</note> Not Will; for it is an enemy to them: They are against it, and it is against them. Not Skill; for it is darkness: It savoreth only the things of the flesh; but the things of the Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit it cannot understand, because they are spiritually discerned. Never expect then that the flesh should truly expound the mean<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of the rod. It will call Love, Hatred; and say, God is de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stroying, when he is saving; and murmur, as if he did thee wrong, and used thee hardly, when he is shewing thee the greatest mercy of all. Are not the foul steps the way to Rest, as well as the fair? Yea are not thy sufferings the most necessary passages of his providence? And though for the present they are not Joyous, but Grievous; yet in the End do they bring forth the Quiet fruits of Righteousness, to all those that are exercised thereby.<note place="margin">Heb. 12.11.</note> Hast thou not found it so by former experience, when yet this flesh would have perswaded thee otherwise? Believe it then no more, which hath mis-informed
<pb n="450" facs="tcp:61132:261"/>
thee so oft. For indeed there is no believing the words of a wick<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed and ignorant enemy. Ill-will never speaks well. But when malice, viciousness and Ignorance are combined, what actions can expect a true and fair interpretation? This flesh will call Love, Anger; and Anger, Hatred, and Chastisements, Judgments: It will tell thee, That no mans case is like thine; and if God did Love thee,<note place="margin">Psal. 116.11.</note> he would never so use thee: It will tell thee, That the promises are but deceiving words, and all thy prayers and upright<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness is vain:<note place="margin">Psal. 73.13, 14, 15.</note> If it find thee sitting among the ashes, it will say to thee as <hi>Jobs</hi> wife; <hi>Dost thou yet retain thine integrity?</hi> Job 2. 8, 9, 10. Thus will it draw thee to offend against God, and the generation of his Children. It is a party, and the suffering party, and therefore not fit to be the Judg. If your Child should be the Judg, when and how oft you should chastise him, and whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther your chastisement be a token of fatherly love, you may easily imagine what would be his Judgment. If we could once believe God, and Judg of his dealings by what he speaks in his Word, and by their usefulness to our Souls, and reference to our Rest, and could stop our ears against all the clamours of the flesh, then we should have a truer Judgment of our Af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flictions.</p>

LAstly Consider, God doth seldom give his people so sweet a fore-taste of their Future Rest, as in their deep Afflicti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons. He keepeth his most precious cordials for the time of our greatest faintings and dangers. To give such to men that are well and need them not, is but to cast them away: They are not ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pable of discerning their working on their worth. A few drops of Divine Consolation in the midst of a world of pleasure and contents, will be but lost and neglected; as some precious spirits cast into a vessel or river of common waters. The Joys of Heaven are of unspeakable sweetness: But a man that overflows with earthly delights, is scarce capable of tasting their sweetness: They
<pb n="451" facs="tcp:61132:261" rendition="simple:additions"/>
may easilier comfort the most dejected Soul, then him that feeleth not any need of comfort, as being full of other comforts already. Even the best of Saints do seldom-taste of the delights of God, and pure, spiritual, unmixed Joys, in the time of their prosperity, as they do in their deepest troubles and distress. God is not so lavish of his choice favours, as to bestow them unseasonably: Even to his own will he give them at so fit a time, when he know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth that they are needful, and will be valued; and when he is sure to be thanked for them, and his people rejoyced by them. Especi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally when our sufferings are more directly for his cause, then doth he seldom fail of sweetening the bitter cup. Therefore have the Martyrs been possessors of the highest Joys, and therefore were they in former times so ambitious of Martyrdom. I do not think that <hi>Paul</hi> and <hi>Silas</hi> did ever sing more Joyfully, then when they were sore with scourgings, and were fast in the inner prison, with their feet in the stocks, <hi>Acts</hi> 16.24, 25.

When did he appear among them, and say, <hi>Peace be unto you?</hi> but when they were shut up together for fear of the persecuting Jews? When did the room shake where they were, and the Holy Ghost come down upon them, and they lift up their voyces in praising God? but when they were impri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>soned, convented, and threatened for the Name of Christ? <hi>Acts</hi> 4.24, 31. When did <hi>Stephen</hi> see Heaven opened, but when he was giving up his life for the testimony of Jesus? <hi>Acts</hi> 7.55. And though we be never put to the suffering of Martyrdom, yet God knoweth, that in our natural sufferings we need support. Many a Christian that hath waited for Christ (with <hi>Simeon</hi> in the Tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple) in duty and holiness all his days, yet never finds him in his arms till he is dying; though his Love was fixed in their hearts before: and they that wondered that they tasted not of his com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>forts, have then when it was needful received abundance. And indeed, in time of prosperity, that comfort which we have is so mixed according to the mixt causes of it, that we can very hardly discern what of it is carnal, and what is spiritual. But when all worldly comforts and hopes are gone, then that which is left is most likely to be spiritual. And the Spirit never worketh more
<pb n="452" facs="tcp:61132:262"/>
sensibly and sweetly, then when it worketh alone. Seeing then that the time of Affliction, is the time of our most pure, spiritual, heavenly Joy, for the most part, why should a Christian think it so sad a time? Is not that our best estate, wherein we have most of God? Why else do we desire to come to Heaven? If we look for a Heaven of fleshly delights, we shall find our selves mistaken. Conclude then, that Affliction is not so bad a state for a Saint in his way to Rest, as the flesh would make it. Are we wiser then God? Doth not he know what is good for us better then we?

                        <p>I Answer: It seemeth God hath hit the right vein, where thy most inflamed distempered blood did lie: It's his constant course to pull down mens Idols, and take away that which is dearer to them then himself. There it is that his Jealousie is kindled; and there it is that thy Soul is most endangered. If God should have taken from thee that which thou canst let go for him, and not that which thou canst not; or have afflicted thee where thou canst bear it, and not where thou canst not, thy Idol would nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther have been discovered, nor removed: this would neither have been a sufficient Tryal to thee, nor a Cure; but have confirmed thee in thy Soul-deceit and Idolatry.</p>
                        <p>
                           <hi>Object.</hi> 2. Oh, but, saith another, if God would but deliver me out of it, yet I could be content to bear it: but I have an uncure<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able sickness, or I am like to live and dye in poverty, or disgrace, or the like distress.</p>
                        <p>
                           <pb n="453" facs="tcp:61132:262"/>I answer, 1. Is it nothing that he hath promised it shall work for thy Good? <hi>Rom.</hi> 8.28. and that with the affliction he will make a way to escape? that he will be with thee in it? and deliver thee in the fittest manner and season? 2. Is it not enough that thou art sure to be delivered at death? and that with so full an ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vancing deliverance? Oh what cursed Unbelief doth this discover in our hearts? That we would be more thankful to be turned back again, into the stormy tumultuous Sea of the World, then to be safely and speedily landed at our Rest! And would be gladder of a few years inferiour mercies at a distance, then to enter upon the Eternal Inheritance with Christ? Do we call God our chief Good, and Heaven our Happiness? and yet is it no Mercy or Deliverance to be taken hence, and put into that possession?</p>
                        <p>
                           <hi>Object.</hi> 3. Oh, but, saith another, if my Affliction did not dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able me for Duty, I could bear it; but it maketh me useless and utterly unprofitable.</p>
                        <p>
                           <hi>Answ.</hi> 1. For that Duty which tendeth to thy own personal benefit, it doth not disable thee, but is the greatest quickening help that thou canst expect. Thou usest to complain of coldness, and dulness, and worldliness, and security: If affliction will not help thee against all these, by warming, quickening, rouzing thy spirit, I know not what will. Sure thou wilt repent throughly, and pray fervently, and minde God and Heaven more seriously, either now or never. 2. And for Duty to others, and for thy service to the Church; it is not thy Duty when God doth dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able thee. He may call thee out of the Vineyard in this respect, even before he call thee by death. If he lay thee in the grave, and put others in thy place to do the service, is this any wrong to thee? or doth it beseem thee to repine at it? Why so, if he call thee out before thy death, and let thee stand by, and see others do the work in thy stead, shouldst thou not be as well content? Must God do all the work by thee? Hath he not many others as dear to him, and as fit for the employment? But, alass, what de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceitfulness lieth in these hearts! When we have time, and health, and opportunity to work, then we loyter, and do our Master but very poor service: But when he layeth Affliction upon us, then we complain that he disableth us for his work; and yet perhaps we are still negligent in that part of the work which we can do. So, when we are in health and prosperity, we forget the publique, and
<pb n="454" facs="tcp:61132:263"/>
are careless of other mens miseries and wants, and minde almost nothing but our selves: But when God Afflicteth us, though he excite us more to Duty for our selves, yet we complain that he dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ableth us for Duty to others: As if on the sudden we were grown so charitable, that we regard other mens Souls far more then our own!

                           <hi>Answ.</hi> 1. Who ever is the instrument, the Affliction is from God, and the provoking cause from thy self: And were it not fitter then that thou look more to God and thy self? 2. Didst thou not know, that the best men are still sinful in part? and that their hearts are naturally deceitful, and desperately wicked, as well as others? And this being but imperfectly cured, so far as they are fleshly, the fruits of the flesh will appear in them, which are <hi>strife, hatred,</hi>

Or perhaps the observation of the ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cellencies of Grace hath made thee forget the vileness of Nature; and therefore God will have thee take notice of both.

And I know that there is much difference be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween them and the world in this point. But yet, as I said, they are Saints but in part; and therefore <hi>Paul</hi> and <hi>Barnabas</hi> may so fall out, as to part asunder; and upright <hi>Asa</hi> may imprison the Prophet: (call it persecution, or what you please). <hi>Josephs</hi> Bre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thren that cast him into a pit, and sold him to strangers for a slave, I hope were not all ungodly. <hi>Jobs</hi> wife and friends were sad com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>forters. <hi>Davids</hi> Enemy was his familiar friend, with whom he had taken sweet counsel, and they had gone up together to the House of God. And know also, that thy own nature is as bad as theirs; and thou art as likely thy self to be a grief to others. Can such ulcerous, leprous sinners, as the best are, live together, and not infest and molest each other with the smell of their sores? Why if thou be a Christian, thou art a dayly trouble to thy self; and art molested more with thy own corruptions, then with any mans else: And dost thou take it so hainously to be molested with the frailties of others, when thou canst not forbear doing more against thy self? For my part, (for all our Graces) I rather admire at that wisdom and goodness of God, that maintaineth that order and union amongst us, as is: and that he suffereth us not to be still one anothers executioners, and to lay violent hands on our selves, and each other. I dare not think that there is no one gracious, that hath labored to destroy others that were so, in these late dissentions. Sirs, you do not half know yet the mortal wickedness of de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>praved Nature. If the best were not more beholden to the
<pb n="456" facs="tcp:61132:264"/>
Grace of God without them, then to the habitual Grace within them, you should soon see, <hi>That men of low degree are vanity, and men of high degree are a lye; to be put in the ballance, they are lighter then vanity it self, Psal.</hi> 62.7, 8, 9. For <hi>what is man that he should be clean? and he that is born of a woman, that he should be righteous? Behold he putteth no trust in his Saints, and the Heavens are not clean in his sight: How much more abominable and filthy is man, that drinketh up iniquity like water? Job</hi> 15.14, 15, 16.</p>
                        <p>
                           <hi>Object.</hi> 5. Oh but if I had that consolation, which you say God reserveth for our suffering times, I should suffer more contentedly: but I do not perceive any such thing.</p>
                        <p>
                           <hi>Answ.</hi> 1. The more you suffer for Righteousness sake, the more of this blessing you may expect; and the more you suffer for your own evil doing, the longer you must look to stay till that sweetness come. When we have by our folly provoked God to chastise us, shall we presently look that he should fill us with com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fort? That were (as Mr <hi>Paul Bayn</hi> saith) to make Affliction to be no Affliction. What good would the bitterness do us, if it be pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sently drowned in that sweetness? It is well in such sufferings, if you have but supporting Grace; and your sufferings sanctified to work out your sin, and bring you to God.</p>
                        <p n="2">2. Do you not neglect or resist the comforts which you desire? God hath filled Precepts, and Promises, and other of his Providen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces with matter of comfort: If you will over-look all these, and make nothing of them, and pore all upon your sufferings, and ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>serve one cross more then a thousand mercies, who maketh you uncomfortable but your selves? If you resolve, that you will not be comfortable as long as any thing aileth your flesh, you may stay till death before you have comfort.</p>
                        <p n="3">3. Have your Afflictions wrought kindly with you, and fit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed you for comfort? Have they humbled you? and brought you to a faithful confession and reformation of your beloved sin? and made you set close to your neglected Duties? and weaned your hearts from their former Idols? and brought them unfeignedly to take God for their Portion and their Rest? If this be not done, how can you expect Comfort? Should God binde up the sore while it festereth at the bot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tom? It is not meer Suffering that prepares you for Comfort;

And when they fall among the lighter, ignorant, unsounder sort of professors, whose Religion is all in their brain, and on their tongue, they seldom fail of their de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sired success. These men shall shortly know, that to bring a man to the knowledg and Love of Christ, is another kind of work, then to bring him to be Baptized again, or to be of such a Church, or such a side.

                        <p n="3">3. Nor do I perswade you to speak against mens faults behind their backs, and be silent before their faces, as the common custom of the world is. To tell other men of their faults, tendeth little to their reformation, if they hear it not themselves. To whisper out mens faults to others, as it cometh not from Love, or from any ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nest principle, so usually doth it produce no good effect: For if the party hear not of it, it cannot better him: If he do, he will take it but as the reproach of an enemy, tending to disgrace him, and not as the faithful counsel of a friend, tending to recover him; and as that which is spoken to make him odious, and not to make him vertuous. It tendeth not to provoke to godliness, but to raise contention: for <hi>a whisperer separateth the chiefest friends,</hi> Prov. 16.28. And how few shall we find that make conscience of this horrible sin? or that will confess it, and bewail it when they
<pb n="461" facs="tcp:61132:267"/>
are reprehended for it? Especially if men are speaking of their enemies, or those that have wronged them, or whom they suppose to have wronged them; or if it be of one that eclipseth their glory,<note place="margin">Gen. 31.1. Psalm 41 7.</note> or that standeth in the way of their gain or esteem; or if it be one that differeth from them in Judgment, or one that is commonly spoke against by others, who is it that maketh any Conscience of backbiting such as these? And you shall ever observe, that the forwarder they are to backbiting, the more back<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward always to faithful admonishing;<note place="margin">1 Sam 22.9. Dan. 6 3. Rom 1.29 30. John 7.51.</note> and none speak less of a mans faults to his face for his reformation, then those that speak most of them behind his back to his defamation. If ill-will or Envy lie at the heart, it maketh them cast forth disgracing speeches, as oft as they can meet with such as themselves who will hear and entertain them. Even as a corrupt humor in the stomack provo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>keth a man to vomit up all that he taketh, while it self remaineth and continueth the disease.

See that you never hear a man speaking against his neighbor behind his back, (without some special cause or call) but presently rebuke him: ask him, Whether he hath spoke those things in a way of love to his face? if he have not; ask him, how he dare so pervert Gods prescribed order, who commandeth to rebuke our neighbor plainly, and to tell him his fault first in private, and then before wit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness, till we see whether he will be won,<note place="margin">Prov. 25.23.</note> or not, <hi>Levit.</hi> 19.17. <hi>Mat.</hi> 18.15, 16, 17.

If it be an Ignorant carnal person that you have to deal with, who is an utter stranger to the Mysteries of Religion, and to the work of Regeneration on his own Soul, the first thing you have to do, is to acquaint him with these Doctrines. Labour to make him understand wherein mans chief Happiness doth consist: and how far he was once possessed of it: and what Law and Covenant God then made with him: and how he broke it: and what penalty he incurred, and what misery he brought himself into thereby: Teach him what need men had of a Redeemer: and how Christ in mercy did interpose, and <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

Faith and Holiness of life; how impossible it is to have Salvation by Christ without these; and what they are, and the true nature of them. If when he under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>standeth all this, you find his Soul inthralled in presumption and false hopes, perswading himself that he is a true Believer, and pardoned, and reconciled, and shall be saved by Christ, and all this upon false grounds, or meerly because he would have it so, (which is a com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon case:) Then urge him hard to examine his state: shew him the necessity of trying; the danger of being deceived; the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monness and easiness of mistaking through the deceitfulness of the heart; the extream madness of putting it to a blind adventure; or of resting in negligent or wilful uncertainty: Help him in trying himself: Produce some undenyable Evidences from Scripture: Ask him, Whether these be in him or not? Whether ever he found such workings or dispositions in his heart? Urge him to a rational answer: do not leave him, till you have convinced him of his mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sery: and then seasonably and wisely shew him the remedy. If he produce some common gifts, or duties, or works; know to what end he doth produce them? If to joyn with Christ in composing him a Righteousness; shew him how vain and destructive they are: If it be by way of Evidence to prove his title to Christ; shew him how far a common work may reach; and wherein the Life of Christianity doth consist; and how far he must go further if he will be Christ's disciple. In the mean time, that he be not discouraged with hearing of so high a measure; shew him the way by which he must attain it: be sure to draw him to the use of all means: set him a hearing and reading the Word, calling upon God, accom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>panying the godly: perswade him to leave his actual sin, and to get out of all ways of temptation; especially to forsake ungodly company; and to wait patiently on God in the use of means: and shew him the strong hopes, that in so doing he may have of a bles<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sing; this being the way that God will be found in.</p>

                        <p n="1">1. Set upon the work sincerely, and with right intentions. Let thy Ends be the Glory of God in the parties Salvation.

But be sure thy main end be to recover them from misery, and bring them into the way of eternal Rest.</p>

                        <p n="2">2. DO it Speedily: As you would not have them Delay their returning, so do not you Delay to seek their return. You are purposing long to speak to such an Ignorant neighbor, and to deal with such a scandalous sinner, and yet you have never done it. Alas, he runs on the score all this while: he goes deeper in debt: wrath is heaping up: Sin taketh rooting: Custom doth more fasten him: Engagements to sin grow stronger and more numerous: Conscience grows seared: the heart grows hardened: while you delay, the Devil rules and rejoyceth: Christ is shut out: the Spirit is repulsed: God is dayly dishonored: his Law is violated: he is without a Servant, and that service from him which he should have: the Soul continueth in a doleful state: time runs on: the day of visitation hasteth away: death and judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment are even at the door: and what if the man dye and miss of Heaven, while you are purposing to teach him and help him to it? What if he drop into hell while you are purposing to prevent it? If in case of his bodily distress, you must not bid him, go and come again to morrow, when you have it by you, and he is in want, <hi>Prov.</hi> 3.27, 28. how much less may you delay the succor of his Soul: If once death snatch him away, he is then out of the reach of your Charity.</p>

                           <note place="margin">§. 6.</note>3. LEt thy Exhortation proceed from Compassion and Love: and let the manner of it clearly shew the person thou deal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>est with, that it hence proceedeth. It is not jeering, or scorning, or reproaching a man for his faults, that is a likely way to work his reformation: Nor is it the right way to convert him to God, to rail at him, and vilifie him with words of disgrace. Men will take them for their enemies that thus deal with them: And the words of an enemy are little perswading. Lay by your Passion therefore, and take up compassion, and go to poor sinners with tears in your eyes, that they may see you indeed believe them to be miserable; and that you do unfeignedly pity their case: Deal with them with earnest humble intreatings: Let them see that your very bowels do yearn over them, and that it is the very de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sire of your hearts to do them good: Let them perceive that you have no other end but the procuring of their everlasting Happiness; and that it is your sense of their danger, and your love to their Souls that forceth you to speak; even because you know the terrors of the Lord, and for fear lest you should see them in eternal torments. Say to them: Why friend, you know it is no advantage of my own that I seek: The way to please you, and to keep your friendship, were to sooth you in your way, or to speak well of you, or to let you alone: but Love will not suffer me to see you perish, and be silent: I seek nothing at your hands, but that which is necessary to your own happiness: It is your self that will have the gain and comfort if you come in to Christ, &amp;c. — If men should thus go to eve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry ignorant wicked neighbor they have, and thus deal with them, Oh what blessed fruits should we quickly see! I am ashamed to hear some lazy hypocritical wretches, to revile their poor igno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rant neighbors, and separate from their company and communion, and proudly to judg them unfit for their society, before ever they once tryed with them this compassionate Exhortation! Oh you little know what a prevailing course this were like to prove!
<pb n="467" facs="tcp:61132:270" rendition="simple:additions"/>
and how few of the vilest drunkards or swearers would prove so obstinate, as wholy to reject or despise the Exhortations of Love! I know it must be God that must change mens hearts: But I know also that God worketh by means; and when he meaneth to prevail with men, he usually fitteth the means accord<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ingly, and stirreth up men to plead with them in a prevailing way, and so setteth in with his grace, and maketh it successful. Certainly those that have tryed can tell you by experience, that there is no way so prevailing with men as the way of Compas<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sion and Love. So much of these as they discern in your Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hortation, usually so much doth it succeed with their hearts. And therefore I beseech those that are faithful to practise this course.</p>

Do not dawb with men, and hide from them their misery or danger, or any part of it: Do not make their sins less then they are; nor speak of them in an extenuating language: Do not encourage them in a false hope or faith, no more then you would discourage the sound hopes of the righteous. If you see his case dangerous, tell him plainly of it: Neighbor, I am afraid God hath not yet renew<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed your Soul; and that it is yet a stranger to the great work of Regeneration and Sanctification: I doubt you are not yet reco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vered from the power of Satan to God, nor brought out of the state of wrath which you were born in, and have lived in: I doubt you have not chosen Christ above all, nor set your heart upon him, nor unfeignedly taken him for your Soveraign Lord. If you had, sure you durst not so easily disobey him; you could not so neglect him and his worship in your family and in pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lique: you could not so eagerly follow the world, and talk of almost nothing but the things of this world, while Christ is sel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom mentioned or sought after by you. If you were in Christ, you would be a new Creature: old things would be passed away, and all things would become new: you would have new thoughts, and new talk, and new company, and new endeavors and a new conversation: Certainly without these you can never be saved: You may think otherwise, and hope better as long as you will, but your hopes will all deceive you, and perish with you: Alas, it is not as you will, nor as I will, who shall be saved; but it is as God will:<note place="margin">Heb. 12.14. Joh. 3 3. Luk. 19 27.</note> and God hath told us, That without holiness none shall see him, and except we be born again we cannot enter into his Kingdom; and that all that would not have Christ raign over them, shall be brought forth and destroyed before him. Oh therefore look to your state in time. — Thus must you deal roundly and faithfully with men, if ever you intend to do them good: It is not hovering at a distance in a
<pb n="469" facs="tcp:61132:271" rendition="simple:additions"/>
general discourse that will serve the turn: It is not in curing mens Souls as in curing their bodies, where they must not know their danger, lest it sadden them, and hinder the cure. They are here agents, in their own cure; and if they know not their misery, they will never bewail it, nor know how much need they have of a Saviour: If they know not the worst, they will not labour to prevent it; but will sit still or loiter till they drop into perdi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, and will trifle out their time in delays till it be too late: And therefore speak to men as Christ to the Pharisees, till they knew that he meant them. Deal plainly, or you do but deceive and destroy them.</p>

                        <p n="5">5. ANd as you must do it Plainly,<note place="margin">§. 8.</note> so also Seriously, Zealously, and Effectually. The exceeding stupidity and deadness of mens hearts is such, that no other dealing will ordinarily work. You must call loud to awake a man in a Swoun or Lethargy. If you speak to the common sort of men, of the evil of their sin, of their need of Christ, of the danger of their Souls. and of the ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cessity of Regeneration, they will wearily and unwillingly give you the hearing, and put off all with a sigh, or a few good wishes, and say, [<hi>God forgive us, we are all sinners,</hi>] and there's an end. If ever you will do them good therefore, you must sharpen your exhortation, and set it home, and follow it with their hearts, till you have rouzed them up, and made them begin to look about them. Let them know that thou speak not to them of indifferent things, not about childrens games, or worldlings vanities, or mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters of a few days or years continuance; nor yet about matters of uncertainty, which perhaps may never come to pass: But it is about the saving or damning of their Souls and bodies; and whether they shall be Blessed with Christ, or tormented with Devils, and that for ever and ever without any change; It is, how to stand before God in Judgment, and what answer to give, and how they are like to speed: And this Judgment and eternal state they shall very shortly see; they are almost at it; yet a few more nights and days, and they shall presently be at that last day;
<pb n="470" facs="tcp:61132:272"/>
a few more breathes they have to breathe, and they shall breathe out their last; and then as certainly shall they see that mighty change, as the Heaven is over their heads, and the earth under their feet. Oh labour to make men know, that it is mad jesting about Salvation or Damnation; and that Heaven and Hell be not mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters to be playd with, or passed over with a few careless thoughts! Is it most certain that one of these days thou shalt be either in everlasting unchangeable Joy or Torments, and doth it not awake thee? Is there so few that find the way of life? so many that go the way of death? so hard to escape? so easie to miscarry? and that while we fear nothing but think all is well? and yet do you fit still and trifle! Why what do you mean? what do you think on? The world is passing away: its pleasures are fading: its honours are leaving you: its profits will prove unprofitable to you: Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven or Hell are a little before you: God is Just and Jealous: his Threatenings are true: the great day of his Judgment will be terrible: your time runs on: your lives are uncertain: you are far behind hand: you have loitered long: your case is dangerous: your Souls are far gone in sin: you are strange to God: you are hardened in evil customs: you have no assurance of pardon to shew: if you dye to morrow, how unready are you? and with what terror will your Souls go out of your bodies? And do you yet loiter for all this? Why consider with your selves: God stand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth all this while waiting your leasure: his patience beareth: his Justice forbeareth: his Mercy intreateth you: Christ standeth offering you his blood and merits: you may have him freely, and life with him: the Spirit is perswading you: Conscience is accusing and urging you: Ministers are praying for you, and calling upon you: Satan stands waiting when Justice will cut off your lives, that he may have you: This is your time: Now or Never. What! had you rather lose Heaven then your profits or pleasures? had you rather burn in Hell, then repent on Earth? had you rather howl and roar there, then pray day and night for mercy here? or to have Devils your Tormentors, then to have Christ your Governor? Will you renounce your part in God and Glory, rather then renounce your cursed sins? Do you think a holy life too much for Heaven? or too dear a course to prevent an endless misery? Oh friends; What do you think of these things? God hath made you men, and endued you with Reason;
<pb n="471" facs="tcp:61132:272" rendition="simple:additions"/>
do not renounce your Reason where you should chiefly use it.— In this manner you must deal roundly and seriously with men. Alas, it is not a few dull words between Jest and earnest, between sleep and waking, as it were, that will waken an ignorant dead-hearted sinner? When a dull hearer and a dull speaker meet toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, a dead heart and a dead exhortation, it is far unlike to have a lively effect. If a man fall down in a Swoun, you will not stand trifling with him, but lay hands on him presently, and snatch him up, and rub him, and call loud to him: If a house be on fire, you will not in a cold affected strain go tell your neighbor of it, nor go make an oration of the nature and danger of fire; but you will run out, and cry, Fire, Fire: Matters of moment must be seri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ously dealt with.

Oh Sirs, deal with Sin as Sin, and speak of Heaven and Hell as they are, and not as if you were in Jest. I confess I have failed much in this my self; the Lord lay it not to my charge. Loathness to displease men, makes us undo them.</p>

Some men would take this to be a sinful complying with their Corruption, to yield so far to their pride and bashfulness, as to teach them only in private, because they would be a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>shamed to own the Truth in Publique: But <hi>PAVL</hi> knew how great a hinderance mens reputation is to their entertain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of the Truth; and that the remedy must not only be fitted to the disease, but also to the strength of the Patient; and that in so doing the Physician is not guilty of favoring the disease, but is praise-worthy for taking the right way to cure; and that learners and young-beginners, must not be dealt with as open professors. Moreover, means will work easily if you take the opportunity; when the Earth is soft, the Plow will enter. Take a man when he is under afflicti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, or in the house of mourning, or newly stirred by some moving Sermon, and then set it home, and you may do him good. Christian Faithfulness doth require us, not onely to do good when it falls in our way, but to watch for opportunities of doing good.</p>
                        <p n="2">2 Be wise also in suiting your Exhortation to the quality and temper of the person. All meats are not for all stomacks: One man will vomit that up again in your face, which another will digest. 1. If it be a learned, or ingenious, rational man, you must deal more by convincing Arguments, and less by passionate perswasi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons: 2. If it be one that is both ignorant and stupid, there is need of both: 3. If one that is convinced, but yet is not converted, you must use most those means that rouze up the affections. 4. If they be obstinate and secure, you must reprove them sharply. 5. If they be of timorous, tender natures, and apt to dejections or distracti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, they must be tenderly dealt with. All cannot bear that rough dealing as some can. Love, and Plainness, and Seriousness, takes with all: but words of terror some can scarce bear. This is (as we say of stronger Physick, <hi>Hellebore, Colloquintida,</hi> &amp;c. <hi>nec puero, nec seni, nec imbecillo, sed robusto, &amp;c.</hi>) not fit for every com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plexion and state.</p>

harsh, and unseemly language, that it makes the hearers loath the food that they should live by, and laugh at a Sermon that might make them quake: Especially if they be men of curious ears, and carnal hearts; and have more common wit and parts then the speaker. And so it is in private <hi>Exhortation,</hi> as well as publique: If you cloath the most amiable beautiful Truth in the sordid rags of unbeseeming language, you will make men disdain it as monstrous and deformed, though it be the off-spring of God, and of the highest nature.</p>

STrive to bring all your Exhortations to an Issue: Stick not in the work done, but look after the success, and aim at that end in all your speeches. I have long observed it in Ministers and private men, that if they speak never so convincing powerful words, and yet their hearts do not long after the success of them with the hearers, but all their care is over when they have done their speech, pretending that having done their duty, they leave the Issue to God, these men do seldom prosper in their labors: But those whose very heart is set upon the work, and that long to see it take for the hearers conversion, and use to enquire how it speeds, God usually blesseth their labors, though more weak. Labor therefore to drive all your speeches to the desired Issue. If you are reproving a sin, cease not till (if it may be) you have got the sinner to promise you to leave it, and to avoyd the occasions of it: If you are exhorting to a Duty; urge the party to promise you presently to set upon it. If you would draw them to Christ, leave not till you have made them confess, that their present unre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>generate state is miserable, and not to be rested in; and till they have subscribed to the necessity of Christ, and of a change; and till they have promised you to fall close to the use of means.

If you tell others of the admirable Joys of Heaven, and your selves do nothing but drudg for the world, and are as much taken up in striving to be rich, or as quar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>relsom with your Neighbors in a case of commodity, as any others; who will then beleeve you? or who will be perswaded by you to seek the everlasting riches? Will they not rather think, that you perswade them to look after another world, and to neglect this, that so you might have the more of it to your self?

If I were not known to be quite beyond their exceptions my self, I might not say so much, lest I were thought to plead my own interest: Especially a dying man should be out of the reach of such accusations. But the Lord knoweth, that it is not a desire that Ministers should be rich, that maketh me speak this; but an earnest desire of the Happiness of the Church: Nor do I mean the Ministry only by the word [<hi>Church:</hi>] It is the people that are robbed and bear the loss, more then the Mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sters: Ministers must and will have maintenance, or else men will set their Children to other studies: When there is no other, the people must allow it themselves, or be without: What Minister can well over-see and watch over more then a thousand Souls? nor I think so many. Many Congregations have four thousand, ten thousand, twenty thousand, some fifty thousand, yea seventy thousand. How many Officers will the State maintain in an Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>my of thirty thousand? I had almost said, the work of governing the Church is greater, and hath need of as many. I would all Scripture and primitive patterns were well viewed in this. Oh happy Reformation, if Popish superstitious Clergy men, had been only taken down, and able godly men put in their places, or in right offices, without such diminution of the number or the maintenance! Or if a supply at present could not be had, yet should they not have overthrown the hopes of posterity. But to leave this Digression: I hope those that God hath called to his work, will labour never the less for the shortness of their mainte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nance: And those of the people that can do no more, can yet pray the Lord of the harvest that he will send forth labourers. And he that hath put that petition into our mouths, I hope will put the answer into our hands.</p>

YEt is it not enough that you seek after Teachers, but espe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cially you must seek after such as are fittest for the work. An ignorant Emperick that killeth more then he cureth, doth not so much differ from an able Physician, as an unskilful Minister from one that is able. Alas, this is the great defect among us: Men that are fitted for the work indeed are almost wonders: One or two, or three, or four in a County is much. <note n="*" place="margin">And almost as few that are well skilled in managing known truths upon the Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>science.</note> How few that have dived into the Mysteries of Divinity? or have throughly studied the most needful controversies? or are able to explain or main<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain the Truth? But only they store their Memories with the Opi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nions and Phrases of those Teachers that are in most credit, in common cases; and then they think they are Divines: And every man that steps out of their common rode, they can say he is Erro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neous or Heretical; but how to confute him they cannot tell. Alas, whence cometh this misery to the Church? The late Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lates discountenancing the godly learned, is one main cause; and their filling the Ministry with the vilest that did best fit their ends: And so great a Corruption of the Ministry cannot suddenly be cured. And another great cause is this: There is not a choice made of the most excellentest wits, and those youths that are ripest in learning and Religion: but some of them are so rich, that the Ministry is too mean for them; and some so poor, that they have no maintenance to subsist on at the Universities. And so every one that is best furnished to make a trade of the Ministry, or whose parents have best affection to it, how unfit soever the Child is, must be a Minister: and those few, very few, choice wits that would be fittest, are diverted.</p>

It were but keeping a few superfluous attendants the less; or a few horses or dogs the less: If they had hearts to it, it were easily spared out of their sports, or rich apparel, or superfluous dyet: or what

To which end you must draw them con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stantly to hear and attend it: Mind them often of what they have heard: Draw them, if it be possible, to repeat it in their families: If that cannot be, then draw them to come to others that do repeat it; that so it may not dye in the hearing. The very drawing of men into the company and acquaintance of the godly, besides the benefit they have by their endeavors, is of singular use to the reco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>very of their Souls.

the Word which you have heard in publique; to pour out your joynt prayers for the Church and pour selves; to joyn in chearful singing the praises of God; to open your scruples, and doubts, and fears, and get resolution; to quicken each other in Love, and Heavenliness, and Holy walking, and all this not as a separated Church, but as a part of the Church more diligent then the rest in redeeming time, and helping the Souls of each other Heaven<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward.</p>

Oh how many Souls may curse these wretches in Hell for ever, that have by them been brought to contemn the means that should save them! By many years experience in my conversing with these men, I can speak it knowingly, that the chiefest of their zeal is let out against the faithful Ministers of Christ: he is the ablest of their preachers that can rail at them in the most devillish language: it is their most common discourse in all companies, both godly and prophane to vilifie the Ministry, and make them odious to all partly by slanders, and partly by scorns: Is this the way to win Souls? Whereas formerly they thought, that if a man were won to a love of the Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nistry and Ordinances, he was in a hopeful way of being won to God; now these men are as diligent to bring all men to scorn them, as if this were all that were necessary to the saving of their Souls, and he only shall be happy that can deride at Ministers and Discipline. If any doubt of the truth of what I say, he is a stran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger in <hi>England</hi>; and for his satisfaction let him read all the books

                           <note place="margin">§. 18.</note>ANd now, Christian Reader, seeing it is a Duty that God hath laid upon every man according to his ability, thus to exhort and reprove, and with all possible diligence to labour after the Sal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vation of all about him; judg then whether this work be conscion<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ably performed. Where shall we find the man almost among us, that setteth himself to it with all his might, and that hath set his heart upon the Souls of his brethren, that they may be saved?</p>
                        <p>Let us here therefore a little enquire, What may be the Causes of the gross neglect of this Duty, that the Hinderances being dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>covered, may the more easily be overcome.</p>
                        <p n="1">1. One Hinderance is, Mens own Gracelesness and Guiltiness. They have not been ravished themselves with the heavenly delights; how then should they draw others so earnestly to seek them? They have not felt the wickedness of their own natures, nor their lost condition, nor their need of Christ, nor felt the trans<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>forming renewing work of the Spirit: How then can they dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cover these to others? Ah that this were not the case of many a
<pb n="483" facs="tcp:61132:279" rendition="simple:additions"/>
learned Preacher in <hi>England!</hi> and the causes why they preach so frozenly and generally! Men also are guilty themselves of the sins they should Reprove; and this stops their mouth, and maketh them ashamed to reprove.</p>
                        <p n="2">2. Another Hinderance is, A Secret Infidelity prevailing in mens hearts: Whereof even the best have so great a measure, that causeth this duty to be done by the halves. Alas, Sirs, we do not sure believe mens Misery. We do not believe sure that the threat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nings of God are true. Did we verily believe, that all the unrege<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nerate and unholy shall be eternally tormented, as God hath said, Oh how could we hold our tongues when we are among the un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>regenerate? How could we chuse but burst out into tears when we look them in the face, as the Prophet did when he looked upon <hi>Hazael?</hi> Especially when they are our kindred or friends that are near and dear to us? Thus doth secret unbelief of the truth of Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, consume the vigour of each grace and duty. Oh Christians, if you did verily believe, that your poor, carnal, ungodly neighbors, or wife, or husband, or child, should certainly lie for ever in the flames of Hell, except they be throughly recovered and changed, and that quickly before death do snatch them hence, Would not this make you cast off all discouragements, and lie at them day and night till they were perswaded? and give them no rest in their carnal state? How could you hold your tongue, or let them alone another day, if this were soundly believed? If you were sure that any of your dear friends that are dead, were now in Hell, and per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>swading to repentance would get him out again, would you not perswade him day and night, if you were in hearing? And why should you not do as much then to prevent it, while he is in your hearing, but that you do not believe Gods Word that speaks the danger? Why did <hi>Noah</hi> prepare an Ark so long before, and per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>swade the world to save themselves, but because he believed God, that the flood should come? and therefore saith the Holy Ghost, <hi>By faith Noah prepared the Ark.</hi>
                           <note place="margin">Heb. 11.7.</note> And why did not the world hearken to his perswasion, and seek to save themselves as well as <hi>Noah,</hi> but because they did not believe there would be any such deluge? They see all fair and well, and therefore they thought that threatenings were but wind. The rich man in Hell cries out;
<pb n="484" facs="tcp:61132:280"/>
                           <hi>Send to my brethren to warn them, that they come not to this place of torment:</hi> He felt it, and therefore being convinced of its truth would have them prevent it: But his brethren on earth they did not see and feel as he, and therefore they did not believe, nor would have been perswaded <hi>though one had risen from the dead.</hi>
                           <note place="margin">Luke 16.31.</note> I am afraid most of us do believe the predictions of Scripture, but as we believe the predictions of an Almanack, which telleth you that such a day will be rain, and such a day wind; you think it may come to pass, and it may be not; and so you think of the predictions of the damnation of the wicked. Oh were it not for this cursed Un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>belief, our own Souls and our neighbors would gain more by us then they do.</p>
                        <p n="3">3. This faithful dealing with men for their Salvation, is much Hindered also by our want of Charity and Compassion to mens Souls. We are hard-hearted and cruel towards the miserable; and therefore (as the Priest and the Levite did by the wounded man) we look on them and pass by. Oh what tender heart could en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dure to look upon a poor, blind, forlorn sinner, wounded by sin, and captivated by Satan, and never once open our mouths for his recovery? What though he be silent, and do not desire thy help himself; yet his very misery cries aloud: Misery is the most ef<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fectually suitor to one that is compassionate. If God had not heard the cry of our Miseries before he heard the cry of our prayers, and been moved by his own pity before he was moved by our im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portunity, we might have long enough continued the slaves of Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tan. Is it not the strongest way of arguing that a poor <hi>Lazare</hi> hath, to unlap his sores, and shew them the passengers? all his words will not move them so much as such a pitiful sight. Alas, what pitiful sights do we dayly see? The Ignorant, the prophane, the neglecters of Christ and their Souls; their sores are open and visible to all that know them: and yet do we not pity them? You will pray to God for them in customary duties, that God would open the eyes, and turn the hearts of your ignorant car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal friends and neighbors: And why do you not endeavor their conversion if you desire it? And if you do not desire it, why do you ask it? Doth not your negligence convince you of hypocrisie in your prayers, and of abusing the high God with your deceitful words?
<pb n="485" facs="tcp:61132:280" rendition="simple:additions"/>
Your neighbors are neer you, your friends are in the house with you, you eat and drink, and work and walk, and talk with them, and yet you say little or nothing to them. Why do you not pray them to consider and return, as well as pray God to convert and turn them? Have you as oft and as earnestly begged of them to think on their wayes, and to reform, as you have taken on you to beg of God that they may do so? What if you should see your neighbor faln into a pit, and you should presently fall down on your knees, and pray God to help him out, but would neither put forth your hand to help, nor once perswade or direct him to help himself? would not any man censure you to be cruell and hypocriticall? What the Holy Ghost saith of mens bodily miseries,<note place="margin">1 John 3.17.</note> I may say much more of the misery of their souls; If any man seeth his brother in need, and shutteth up his compassion from him, how dwelleth the love of God in him? Or what love hath he to his brothers soul? Sure if you saw your friend in Hell, you would perswade him hard to come thence, if that would serve; and why do you not now perswade him to prevent it? The Cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity of our ignorant forefathers may rise up in judgment against us, and condemn us: They would give all their estates almost, for so many Masses or pardons, to deliver the souls of their friends from a feigned Purgatory: And we will not so much as importunately admonish and intreat them, to save them from the certain flames of Hell though this may be effectuall to do them good, and the other will do none.</p>
                        <p n="4">4. Another hinderance is, A base man pleasing disposition that is in us. We are so loath to displease men, and so desirous to keep in credit and favor with them, that it makes us most unconscionably neglect our known duty. A foolish Physitian he is, and a most unfaithful friend, that will let a sick man dye for fear of troubling him. And cruel wretches are we to our friends, that will rather suffer them to go quietly to hell, then we will anger them, or ha<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>zard our reputation with them. If they did but fall in a swoon, we would rub them and pinch them, and never stick at hurting them. If they were distracted, we would binde them with chains, and we would please them<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> in nothing that tended to their hurt. And yet when they are besides themselves in point of salvation, and in <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                              <desc>•</desc>
                           </gap>heir madness posting on to damnation, we will not stop them, for fear of displeasing them. How can these men be Christians, that
<pb n="486" facs="tcp:61132:281"/>
love the praise and favour of men, more then the favor of God, <hi>John</hi> 12.43. For if they yet seek to please men, they are no longer the servants of Christ, <hi>Gal.</hi> 1.10. To winne them indeed they must become all things to all men; but to please them to their destruct<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ion, and let them perish,<note place="margin">1 Cor. 9.20, 21, 22, 23, 24. Prov. 11.36.</note> that we may keep our credit with them, is a course so base and barbarously cruel, that he that hath the face of a Christian should abhorre it.</p>
                        <p n="5">5. Another common hinderance is, A sinful Bashfulness. When we should labor to make men ashamed of their sins, we are our selves ashamed of our duties. May not these sinners condemn us? when they will not <note n="*" place="margin">There is no shame now a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mongst men, but to be poor and ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nest. <hi>Tho. Scot. Projector. p.</hi> 8.</note> blush to swear, or be drunk, or neglect the worship of God, and we will blush to tell them of it, and perswade them from it? <hi>Elisha</hi> looked on <hi>Hazael</hi> till he was ashamed; and we are ashamed to look on, or speak to the offender. Sinners will rather boast of their sins,<note place="margin">2 King. 8.11. Jer. 6.15. &amp; 8.12. Luke 9.26. <hi>Illum ego per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ijsse dico cui perijt pudor.</hi> Curtius.</note> and impudently shew them in the open streets: and shall not we be as bold in drawing them from it? Not that I approve of impudence in any: For (as one saith) I take him for a lost man, that hath lost his modesty. Nor would I have inferiors forget their distance in admonishing their superiors; but do it with all humility, submission, and respect. But yet I would much less have them forget their duty to God and their friends, be they never so much their superiors, it is a thing that must be done. Bashfulness is unseemly in cases of flat necessity. And indeed it is not a work to be ashamed of: to obey God in perswading men from their sins to Christ, and helping to save their souls, is not a business for a man to blush at. And yet, alas, what abundance of souls have been neglected through the prevailing of this sin! Even the most of us are hainously guilty in this point. Reader, is not this thy own case? Hath not thy conscience told thee of thy duty many a time, and put thee on to speak to poor sinners, lest they perish; and yet thou hast been ashamed to open thy mouth to them, and so let them alone to sink or swim? Believe me, thou wilt ere long be ashamed of this shame. O read those words of Christ,<note place="margin">Luke 9.26. Mark. 8.38.</note> and tremble. He that is ashamed of me and of my words be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore this adulterous generation, of him will the son of man be ashamed before his father and the Angels.</p>
                        <p n="5">5. Another hinderance is, impatiency, laziness, and favouring
<pb n="487" facs="tcp:61132:281" rendition="simple:additions"/>
of the flesh. It is an ungrateful work, and for the most part maketh those our enemies that were our friends: And men cannot bear the reproaches and unthankful returns of sinners. It may be they are their chief friends on whom is all their dependance, so that it may be their undoing to displease them. Besides, it is a work that seldom succeedeth at the first, except it be followed on with wisdom and unweariedness: you must be a great while teaching an ignorant person, before they will be brought to know the very fundamentals: and a great while perswading an obstinate sinner, before he will come to a full resolution to return. Now this is a tedious course to the flesh, and few will bear it. Not considering what patience God used towards us when we were in our sins, and how long he followed us with the importunities of his Spirit, hold<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing out Christ and life, and beseeching us to accept them. Wo to us if God had been as impatient with us, as we are with others. If Christ be not weary nor give over to invite them, we have little reason to be weary of doing the message, See 2 <hi>Timothy</hi> 2.24, 25,</p>
                        <p n="6">6. Another hinderance is, self-seeking, and self-minding. Men are all for themselves,<note place="margin">Phil. 2.20.</note> and all minde their own things, but few the things of Christ and their brethren. Hence is that Cainish voice, <hi>Am I my brothers keeper?</hi> Every man must answer for himself. Hence also it is that a multitude of ignorant professors do think only, where they may enjoy the purest ordinances, and thither they will go over sea and land, or what way of discipline will be sweet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>est to themselves, and therefore are prone to groundless separation: But where they have the fairest opportunity to win the souls of o<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>thers, or in what place or way they may do most good; these things they little or nothing regard. As if we had learned of the Monks, and were setting up their principles and practice, when we seem to oppose them.</p>
                        <p>If these men had tryed what some of their brethren have done, they would know, that all the purest ordinances and Churches will not afford that solid comfort, as the converting of a few sin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ners by our unwearied compassionate exhortations. Two men in a frosty season come where a company of people are ready to starve; the one of them laps himself, and taketh shelter, for fear lest he should perish with them; the other in pity falls to rub them, that
<pb n="488" facs="tcp:61132:282"/>
he may recover heat in them, and while he laboreth hard to help them, he getteth far better heat to himself then his unprofitable companion doth.</p>
                        <p n="7">7. With many also pride is a great impediment. If it were to speak to a great man, they would do it, so it would not displease him. But to go among the poor multitude, and to take pains with a company of ignorant beggars, or mean persons, and to sit with them in a smoaky nasty cottage, and there to instruct them, and exhort them from day to day; where is the person almost that will do it? Many will much rejoyce if they have been instruments of converting a Gentleman (and they have good cause) But for the common mul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>titude, they look not after them: As if God were a respecter of the persons of the rich, or the souls of all were not alike to him. Alas these men little consider how low Christ did stoop to us! When the God of Glory comes down in flesh, to wormes, and goeth Preaching up and down among them from City to City! Not the sillyest woman that he thought too low to confer with.<note place="margin">John 4. 1 Cor. 1.26.</note> Few rich, and noble, and wise are called. It is the poor that receive the glad tidings of the Gospel.</p>
                        <p n="8">8. Lastly, With some also their <hi>Ignorance</hi> of the duty doth hinder them from performing it. Either they know it not to be a duty, or at least not to be their duty. Perhaps they have not consi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dered much of it, nor been prest to it by their teachers; as they have been to hearing, and praying, and other duties. If this be thy case who readest this, that meer Ignorance, or inconsiderateness hath kept thee from it; then I am in hope now thou art acquainted with thy duty, thou wilt set upon it. <hi>Object.</hi> O but, saith one, I am of so weak parts and gifts that I am unable to manage an exhorta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion;<note place="margin">
                              <hi>Object.</hi> 1.</note> especially to men of strong natural parts and understand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing. <hi>Answ.</hi> First, Set those upon the work who are more able, Secondly, Yet do not think that thou art so excused thy self, but use faithfully that ability which thou hast; not in teaching those of whom thou shouldst learn, but in instructing those that are more ignorant then thy self, and in exhorting those that are negligent in the things which they do know. If you cannot speak well your self, yet you can tell them what God speaketh in his word: It is not the excellency of speech that winneth souls, but the authority of
<pb n="489" facs="tcp:61132:282" rendition="simple:additions"/>
God manifested by that speech, and the power of his word in the mouth of the instructer. A weak woman may tell what God saith in the plain passages of the word, as well as a learned man. If you cannot preach to them, yet you can turn to the place in your Bible, or at least remember them of it, and say, Thus it is written. One of mean parts may remember the wisest of their duty when they forget it. <hi>David</hi> received seasonable advice from <hi>Abigail,</hi> a woman. When a mans eyes are blinded with passion, or the de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceits of the world, or the lusts of the flesh, a weak instructer may prove very profitable: for in that case he hath as much need to hear of that he knoweth, as of that which he doth not know.</p>
                        <p>
                           <hi>Object.</hi> It is my superiour that needeth advice and exhortation: and is it fit for me to teach or reprove my betters? must the wife teach the husband, of whom the Scripture biddeth them learn? or must the childe teach the parents, whose duty it is to teach them?</p>
                        <p>
                           <hi>Answ.</hi> First, It is fit that husbands should be able to teach their wives, and parents to teach their children; and God expecteth they should be so, and therefore commandeth the inferiours to learn of them. But if they through their own negligence do disable themselves, or through their own wickedness do bring their souls into such misery, as that they have the greatest need of advice and reproof themselves, and are objects of pity to all that know their case, then it is themselves, and not you, that break Gods order, by bringing themselves into disability and misery.</p>
                        <p>Matter of meer order and manners must be dispensed with in cases of flat necessity. Though it were your Minister, you must teach him in such a case. It is the part of parents to provide for the children, and not children for the parents: and yet if the pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rents fall into want, must not the children relieve them? It is the part of the husband to dispose of the affaires of the family and e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>state; and yet if he be sick or besides himself, must not the wife do it? The rich should relieve the poor: but if the rich fall into beg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gery, they must be relieved themselves. It is the work of the Phy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sitian to look to the health of others: and yet if he fall sick, some body must help him, and look to him. So must the meanest servant admonish his master, and the childe his parents, and the wife her husband, and the people their Minister, in cases of necessity. Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>condly, yet let me give you these two cautions here.</p>
                        <p n="1">
                           <pb n="490" facs="tcp:61132:283"/>1. That you do not pretend necessity when there is none, out of a meer desire of teaching: There is scarce a more certain disco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>very of a proud heart, then to be forwarder, and more desirous to Teach, then to Learn: especially toward those that are fitter to Teach us.</p>
                        <p n="2">2. And when the Necessity of your superiors doth call for your advice, yet do it with all possible humility, and modesty, and meek<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness: Let them discern your reverence and submission to their superiority, in the humble maner of your addresses to them: Let them perceive, that you do it not out of a meer teaching humor,<note place="margin">1 Tim. 5.1.</note> or proud self-conceitedness. An Elder must be admonished, but not rebuked. If a wife should tell her husband of his sin in a masterly railing language; or if a servant reprove his master, or a childe his father in a sawcie disrespective way, what good could be expected from such reproof? But if they should meekly and humbly open to him his sin and danger, and intreat him to bear with them in what God commandeth, and his misery requireth, and if they could by teares testifie their sense of his case; What father, or master, or husband; could take this ill?</p>

                           <hi>Object.</hi> But some may say, This will make us all Preachers, and cause all to break over the bounds of their callings: every boy and woman then will turn preacher.</p>

                           <hi>Ans.</hi> 1. This is not taking a Pastoral charge of souls, nor mak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing an office or calling of it, as Preachers do.</p>
                        <p n="2">2. And in the way of our callings, every good Christian is a Teacher, and hath a charge of his neighbors soul. Let it be only the voice of a <hi>Cain</hi> to say, <hi>Am I my brothers keeper</hi>? I would have one of these men, that are so loath that private men should teach them, to tell me, What if a man fall down in a swoon in the streets, though it be your father or superior; would you not take him up presently, and use all means you could to recover him? Or would you let him lye and dye, and say, It is the work of the Physitian, and not mine: I will not invade the Physitians calling? In two cases every man is a Physitian. First, In case of necessity<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> and when a Physitian cannot be had: and secondly, in case the hurt be so small, that every man can do it as well as the Physitian. And in the same two cases every man must be a Teacher.</p>
                        <p>
                           <hi>Object.</hi> Some will further object, to put off this duty, That the party is so ignorant, or stupid, or careless, or rooted in sin, and hath

been so oft exhorted in vain; that there is no hope. <hi>Ans.</hi> How know you when there is no hope? Cannot God yet cure him? and must it not be by means? and have not many as far gone been cured? should not a mercifull Physitian use means while there is life? and is it not inhuman cruelty in you to give up your friend to the divel and damnation as hopeless, upon meer backwardness to your duty, or upon groundless discouragements? What if you had been so given up your self when you were ignorant? <hi>Object.</hi> But we must not cast pearls before Swine, nor give that which is holy to Dogs. <hi>Ans.</hi> That is but a favorable dispensation of Christ, for your own safety: When you are in danger to be torn in pieces, Christ would have you forbear, but what is that to you that are in no such danger? As long as they will hear, you have encouragement to speak, and may not cast them off as contemptuous Swine. <hi>Obj.</hi> O but it is a friend that I have all my dependance on, and by telling him of his sin and misery, I may lose his love, and so be undone. <hi>Answ.</hi> Sure no man that hath the face of a Christian will for shame own such an objection as this: Yet I doubt it oft prevaileth in the heart. Is his love more to be valued then his safety? or thy own benefit by him, then the salvation of his soul? Or wilt thou con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nive at his damnation, because he is thy friend? Is that thy best re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quital of his Friendship? Hadst thou rather he should burn for ever in Hell, then thou shouldst lose his favor, or the maintenance thou hast from him? <hi>Object.</hi> But I hope, though he be not rege<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nerate and holy, that he is in no such danger. <hi>Ans.</hi> Nay then, if thou be one that dost not believe Gods word, I have no more to say to thee, <hi>Joh.</hi> 3.3. <hi>Heb.</hi> 12.14. I told you before, that this un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>belief was the root of all.</p>
                        <p>TO conclude this Use,<note place="margin">§. 6.</note> that I may prevaile with every soul that feareth God, to use their utmost diligence to help all about them, to this blessed Rest, which they hope for themselves, let me intreat you to consider of these following Motives.</p>
                        <p n="1">1. Consider, Nature teacheth the communicating of good: and grace doth especially dispose the soul thereto. The neglect there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore of this work is a sin against both Nature and Grace. He that should never seek after God himself, would quickly be concluded graceless by all: And is not he as certainly graceless, that doth
<pb n="492" facs="tcp:61132:284"/>
not labor the salvation of others, when we are bound to love our neighbour as our self? Would you not think that man or woman unnaturall, that would let their own children or neighbors famish in the streets, while they have provision at hand? And is not he more unnatural that will let his children or neighbors perish eter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nally, and will not open his mouth to save them? Certainly this is most barbarous cruelty. Pity to the miserable is so natural, that we account an unmerciful cruel man, a very monster, to be abhor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed of all. Many vicious men are too much loved in the world: but a cruel man is abhorred of all. Now that it may appear to you what a cruel thing this neglect of souls is, do but consider of these two things. First, How great a work it is. Secondly, And how small a matter it is that thou refusest to do for the accomplishing of so great a work. First, It is to save thy brother from eternal flames: that he may not there lye roaring in endless remediless torments. It is to bring him to the Everlasting Rest, where he may live in unconceivable happiness with God. Secondly; And what is it that you should do to help him herein? Why, it is to teach him, and perswade him<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> and lay open to him his sin, and his duty, his misery and the remedy, till you have made him willing to yield to the offers and commands of Christ. And is this so great a matter for to do, to the attaining of such a blessed End? If God had bid you give them all your estates to win them, or lay down your lives to save them, sure you would have refused; when you will not be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stow a little breath to save them! Is not the soul of a Husband, or Wife, or Childe, or Neighbor worth a few words? It is worth this, or it is worth nothing. If they did lye dying in the streets, and a few words would save their lives, would not every man say, that he were a cruel wretch that would let them perish, rather than speak to them? Even the covetuous hypocrite, that <hi>James</hi> reproveth, would give a few words to the poor; and say, go, and be warmed, &amp; be cloathed: What a barbarous unmerciful wretch then art thou, that wilt not vouchsafe a few words of serious sober admonition, to save the soul of thy neighbor or friend? Cruelty and unmerci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fulness to mens bodies is a most damnable sin: but to their souls much more, as the soul is of greater worth then the body; and as eternity is of greater moment then this short time. Alas, you do not see or feel what case their souls are in, when they are in Hell, for want of your faithful admonition! Little know you what many
<pb n="493" facs="tcp:61132:284" rendition="simple:additions"/>
a soul may now be feeling, who have been your neighbors and ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quaintance, and dyed in their sins; on whom you never bestowed one hours sober advice for the preventing of their unhappiness. If you did know their misery, you would now do more to bring them out of hell: but alas it is too late, you should have done it while they were with you,<note place="margin">

                           </note> it is now too late. As one said in re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proach of Physitians; that they were the most happy men because all their good deeds and cures were seen above ground to their praise, but all their mistakes and neglects were buried out of sight: so I may say to you, many a neglect of yours to the souls about you may be now buried with those souls in Hell, out of your sight and hearing, and therefore now it doth not much trouble you: but alas they feel it though you feel it not. May not many a Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pist rise up in judgment against us and condemn us? They will give their lands and estates to have so many Masses said for the souls of their deceased friends (when it is too late) to bring them out of a feigned Purgatory: And we will not ply them with per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>swasions while we may, to save them from real threatned condem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nation: Though this cheaper means may prove effectual, when that dearer way of Papists will do no good: <hi>Jeremy</hi> cryed out, <hi>My bowels, My bowels, I cannot hold my peace,</hi> because of a temporall destruction of his people: And do not our bowels yearn? and can we hold our peace at mens eternall destru<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ction?</p>
                        <p n="2">2. Consider, What a rate Christ did value souls at, and what he hath done towards the saving of them: He thought them worth his blood and sufferings: and shall not we then think them worth the breath of our mouths? VVill you not set in with Christ for so good a work? Nor do a little, where he hath done so much?</p>
                        <p n="3">3. Consider, What fit objects of pity they are. It is no small misery, to be an enemy to God, unpardoned, unsanctified, strangers to the Churches special priviledges, without hope of salvation if they so live and dye. And which is yet more, they are dead in these their trespasses and miseries, and have not hearts to feel them, or to pity themselves.

                           <pb n="494" facs="tcp:61132:285"/>4. Consider, It was once thy own case.

                        <p n="5">5. Consider, The Relation that thou standest in toward them. It is thy neighbor, thy brother, whom thou art bound to be tender of, and to love as thy self. He that loveth not his brother whom <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                           </note>6. Consider, What a deal of guilt this neglect doth lay upon thy soul. First, Thou art guilty of the murder, and damnation of all those souls whom thou dost thus neglect. He that standeth by, and seeth a man in a pit, and will not pull him out if he can, doth drown him. And he that standeth by while theeves rob him, or murderers kill him, and will not help him if he can, is accessory to the fact. And so he that will silently suffer men to damn their souls, or will let Satan and the world deceive them, and not offer to help them, will certainly be Judged guilty of damning them. And is not this a most dreadful consideration? O Sirs, how many souls then have every one of us been guilty of damning! What a number of our neighbors and acquaintance are dead, in whom we discerned no signs of sanctification, and we never did once plainly tell them of it, or how to be recovered! If you had been the cause but of burning a mans house through your negligence, or of un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>doing him in the world, or of destroying his body, how would it trouble you as long as you lived? If you had but killed a man un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>advisedly, it would much disquiet you. We have known those that have been guilty of murder, that could never sleep quietly after, nor have one comfortable day, their own consciences did so vex and torment them. O then what a heart maist thou have, that hast been guilty of murdering such a multitude of pretious souls? Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>member this when thou lookest thy friend or carnal neighbor in the face: and think with thy self: Can I finde in my heart, through
<pb n="495" facs="tcp:61132:285" rendition="simple:additions"/>
my silence and negligence, to be guilty of his everlasting burning in Hell? Me thinks such a thought should even untye the tongue of the dumb.</p>
                        <p n="2">2. And as you are guilty of their perishing, so are you of every sin which in the mean time they do commit. If they were con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verted they would break off their course of sinning: and if you did your duty, you know not but they might be converted. As he that is guilty of a mans drunkenness, is guilty of all the sins which that drunkenness doth cause him to commit. So he that is guilty of a mans continuing unregenerate, is also guilty of the sins of his un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>regeneracie. How many curses, and oathes, and scornes at Gods wayes, and other sins of most hanious nature, are many of you guil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty of, that little think of it?

                        <p n="3">3. You are guilty also, as of the sin, so of all the dishonor that God hath thereby. And how much is that? And how tender should a Christian be of the Glory of God? the least part whereof is to be valued before all our lives.</p>
                        <p n="4">4. You are guilty also of all those Judgments which those mens sins do bring upon the town or countrey where they live. I know you are not such Atheists, but you believe it is God that sendeth sickness, and famine, and war; and also that it is only sin that mov<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth him to this indignation. What doubt then is there but you are the cause of Judgments, who do not strive against those sins which do cause them? God hath stayed long in patience, to see if any would deal plainly with the sinners of the times, and so free their own souls from the guilt: But when he seeth that there is almost none, but all become guilty, no wonder then if he lay the Judgment up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on all. We have all seen the drunkards, and heard the swearers in our streets, and we would not speak, to them, we have al lived in the midst of an Ignorant, worldly, unholy people; and we have not spoke to them with earnestness, plainness, and love: No wonder then if God speak in his wrath both to them and us. <hi>Eli</hi> did not commit the sin himself, and yet he speaketh so coldly against it, that he also must bear the punishment. Guns and Canons speak
<pb n="496" facs="tcp:61132:286"/>
against sin in <hi>England,</hi> because the inhabitants would not speak. God pleadeth with us with fire and sword, because we would not plead with sinners with our tongues. God locketh up the clouds, because we have shut up our mouthes. The earth is grown hard as Iron to us, because we have hardened our hearts against our miser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able neighbors. The cryes of the poor for bread are lowd, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause our cryes against sin have been so low. Sicknesses run apace from house to house, and sweep away the poor unprepared inha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bitants, because we swept not out the sin that breedeth them. When you look over the woful desolations in <hi>England,</hi> how ready are you to cry out on them that were the causers of it? But did you consider how deeply your selves are guilty? And as Christ said in another case, <hi>Luk.</hi> 19 40. <hi>If these should hold their peace, the stones would speak:</hi> So because we held our peace at the Ignorance, un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>godliness, and wickedness of our places, therefore do these plagues and Judgments speak.</p>
                        <p n="7">7. Consider, What a thing it will be to look upon your poor friends eternally in those flames, and to think that your neglect was a great cause of it? and that there was a time when you might have done much to prevent it? If you should there perish with them, it would be no small aggravation of your torment: If you be in Heaven, it would sure be a sad thought, were it possible that any sorrow could dwell there. To hear a multitude of poor souls there cry out for ever, O if you would but have told me plainly of my sin and danger, and dealt roundly with me, and set it home, I might have scaped all this torment, and been now in Rest! O what a sad voice will this be!</p>
                        <p n="8">8. Consider, What a Joy is it like to be in Heaven to you, to meet those there whom you have been means to bring thither! To see their faces, and joyn with them for ever in the praises of God, whom you were instruments to bring to the knowledge and obe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence of Christ. What it will be then we know not: But sure ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to our present temper, it would be no small Joy.</p>
                        <p n="9">9. Consider, how many souls have we drawn into the way of damnation, or at least hardened, or setled in it? And should we not now be more diligent to draw men to life? There is not one of us, but have had our companions in sin, especially in the dayes of our Ignorance and unregeneracy. We have enticed them, or encouraged them to Sabbath-breaking, drinking, or revellings,
<pb n="497" facs="tcp:61132:286"/>
or dancings, and stageplayes, or wantonness, and vanities, if not to scorn and oppose the godly: We cannot so easily bring them from sin again, as we did draw them to it: Many are dead already without any change discovered, who were our companions in sin: we know not how many are and will be in hell that we drew thi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, and there may curse us in their torments for ever. And doth it not beseem us then to do as much to save men, as we have done to destroy them? and be merciful to some, as we have been cruel to others?</p>
                        <p n="10">10. Consider, how diligent are all the enemies of these poor souls to draw them to Hell? And if no body be diligent in help<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing them to Heaven, what is like to become of them? The Divel is tempting them day and night: Their inward lusts are still working and withdrawing them: The flesh is still pleading for its delights and profits; Their old companions are ready to entice them to sin, and to disgrace Gods wayes and people to them, and to contradict the doctrine of Christ that should save them, and to encrease their prejudice, and dislike of holiness. Seducing Teach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers are exceeding diligent in sowing tares, and in drawing off the unstable from the doctrine and way of life: so that when we have done all we can, and hope we have won men, what a multitude of late have after all been taken in this snare? And shall a seducer be so unwearied in Proselyting poor ungrounded souls to his Fancies? And shall not a sound Christian be much more unwearied in labor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to win men to Christ and Life?</p>
                        <p n="11">11. Consider, The neglect of this doth very deeply wound when conscience is awaked. When a man comes to dye, conscience will ask him, VVhat good hast thou done in thy life time? The saving of souls is the greatest good work, what hast thou done towards this? How many hast thou dealt faithfully with? I have oft ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>served, that the consciences of dying men, do very much wound them for this omission. For my own part (to tell you my ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perience) when ever I have been neer death, my conscience hath ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cused me more for this then for any sin: It would bring every ig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>norant prophane neighbor to my remembrance<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> to whom I never made known their danger: It would tell me, Thou shouldst have gone to them in private, and told them plainly of their desperate danger, without bashfulness or dawbing; though it had been when thou shouldest have eaten or slept, if thou hadst no other
<pb n="498" facs="tcp:61132:287"/>
time: Conscience would then remember me, how at such a time, or such a time I was in company with the ignorant, or was riding by the way with a wilful sinner, and had a fit opportunity to have dealt with them, but did not: or at least did it by the halves, and to little purpose. The Lord grant I may better obey conscience hereafter while I live and have time, that it may have less to accuse me of at death.</p>
                        <p n="12">12. Consider further, It is now a very seasonable time which you have for this work. Take it therefore while you have it. There are times wherein it is not safe to speak, it may cost you your li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>berties, or your lives; It is not so now with us. Besides, your neighbours will be here with you but a very little while: They will shortly dye, and so must you. Speak to them therefore while you may; set upon them, and give them no rest till you have pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vailed. Do it speedily, for it must be now or never. A Roman Emperor when he heard of a neighbor dead, he asked, And what did I do for him before he dyed? and it grieved him that a man should dye neer him, and it could not be said that he had first done him any good. Me thinks you should think of this when you hear that any of your neighbors are dead; But I had far rather while they are alive you would ask the question: There is such and such a neighbor (alas how many) that are ignorant and ungodly, what have I done or said that might have in it any likely-hood of re<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>covering them? They will shortly be dead, and then it is too late.</p>
                        <p n="13">13. Consider, this is a work of greatest charity, and yet such as every one of you may perform. If it were to give them moneys, the poor have it not to give: if to fight for them, the weak cannot: if it were to suffer, the fearful will say, they cannot: But every one hath a tongue to speak to a sinner. The poorest may be thus chari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>table, as well as the rich.</p>
                        <p n="14">14. Consider also the happy consequences of this work where it is faithfully done: To name some;</p>
                        <p n="1">1. You may be instrumental in that blessed work of saving souls, a work that Christ came down and died for, a work that the Angels of God rejoyce in; for saith the holy Ghost, <hi>If any of you do erre from the truth, and one convert him, let him know, that he which converteth the sinner from the error of his way, shall save a soul from death, and shall hide a multitude of sins,</hi> Jam. 5:19, 20.
<pb n="499" facs="tcp:61132:287"/>
And how can God more highly honor you, then to make you in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>struments in so great a work?</p>
                        <p n="2">2. Such souls will bless you here and hereafter: They may be angry with you at first; but if your words prevail and succeed, they will bless the day that ever they knew you, and bless God that sent you to speak to them.</p>
                        <p n="3">3. If you succeed, God will have much glory by it; He will have one more to value and accept of his Son, on whom Christs bloud hath attained its ends; He will have one more to love him, and daily worship and fear him, and to do him service in his Church.</p>
                        <p n="4">4. The Church also will have gain by it; There will be one less provoker of wrath, and one more to strive with God against Sin and Judgment, and to engage against the Sinners of the Times, and to win others by Doctrine and Example. If thou couldest but convert one persecuting <hi>Saul,</hi> he might become a <hi>Paul,</hi> and do the Church more service then ever thou didst thy self; however, the healing of Sinners is the surest method for preventing or re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moving of Judgments.</p>
                        <p n="5">5. It is the way also to the purity and flourishing of the Church, and to the right erecting and executing the Discipline of Christ; if men would but do what they ought with their neighbours in private, what a help would it be to the success of the Publike en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deavors of the Ministry? and what hope might we have that daily some would be added to the Church? and if any be obstinate, yet this is the first course that must be taken to reclaim them; who dare separate from them, or excommunicate them before they have been first throughly admonished, and instructed in private? according to Christs Rule, <hi>Matth.</hi> 18.15, 16.</p>
                        <p n="6">6. It bringeth much advantage to your selves: First, It will increase your graces; both as it is a course that God will bless, and as it is an acting of them in this perswading of others; He that will not let you lose a cup of water which is given for him, will not let you lose these greater works of Charity; Besides, those that have practised this duty most conscionably, do finde by experience, that they never go on more speedily and prosperously towards heaven,<note place="margin">Dan. 11.33.</note> then when they do most to help others thither with them: It is not here as with worldly treasure, the more you give away, the less you have; but here, the more you give, the more
<pb n="500" facs="tcp:61132:288"/>
you have: The setting forth Christ in his fulness to others, will warm your own hearts, and stir up your love; The opening of the evil and danger of sin to others will increase your hatred of it, and much engage your selves against it. Secondly, And it seemeth that it will increase your Glory as well as your Grace, both as a duty which God will so reward, (<hi>For those that convert many to Righte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ousness, shall shine as the stars for ever and ever,</hi> Dan. 12.3.) and also as we shall there behold them in heaven, and be their associates in blessedness, whom God made us here the instruments to convert. Thirdly, However, it will give us much peace of Conscience, whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther we succeed or not, to think that. we vvere faithful, and did our best to save them, and that vve are clear from the bloud of all men, and their perishing shall not lye upon us. Fourthly, Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sides, that is a vvork, that if it succeed, doth exceedingly rejoyce an honest heart: He that hath any sense of Gods Honor, or the least affection to the soul of his brother, must needs rejoyce much at his conversion, vvhosoever be the Instrument, but especially vvhen God maketh our selves the means of so blessed a vvork: If God make us the Instuments of any temporal good, it is very com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fortable, but much more of eternal good? There is naturally a re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>joycing followeth every good work, answerable to the degree of its goodness; <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                              <desc>•</desc>
                           </gap>e that doth most good, hath usually the most happy and comfortable life: If men knew the pleasure that there is in doing good, they vvould not seek after their pleasure so much in evil; for my own part, it is an unspeakable comfort to me, that God hath made me an instrument for the recovering of so many from bodily diseases, and saving their natural lives: but all this is yet nothing to the comfort I have in the success of my labors, in the conversion and confirmation of souls; it is so great a joy to me, that it drowneth the painfulness of my daily duties, and the trouble of my daily languishing and bodily griefs! and maketh all these, with all oppositions and difficulties in my work to be easie and as nothing: and of all the personal mercies that ever I received, next to his love in Christ, and to my soul, I must most joyfully bless him for the plenteous success of my endeavors upon others; O what fruits then might I have seen, if I had been more faithful, and plied the work in private and publike as I ought! I know we have need to be very jealous of our deceitful hearts in this point, lest our rejoycing should come from our pride, and self-ascribing.
<pb n="501" facs="tcp:61132:288" rendition="simple:additions"/>
Naturally we would every man be in the place of God, and have the praise of every good work ascribed to our selves: but yet, to imitate our Father in goodness and mercy, and to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>joyce in that degree we attain to, is the part of every childe of God. I tell you therefore, to perswade you from my own experi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence, that if you did but know what a joyful thing it is to be an in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>strument for the converting and saving of souls, you would set up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on it presently, and follow it night and day through the greatest discouragements and resistance. Fifthly, I might also tell you of the honorableness of this work, but I will pass by that, lest I excite your pride instead of your zeal.</p>
                        <p>And thus I have shewed you what should move and perswade you to this duty. Let me now conclude with a word of Intreaty: First, to all the godly in general. Secondly, To some above others in particular, to set upon the conscionable performance of this most excellent Work.</p>

And is it not Hypocrisie to pray, That Gods Name may be Hallowed, and never to endeavor to bring men to Hallow it, nor hinder them from prophaning it?

To them therefore more particularly I will address my exhortation: Whether they be such as have more opportunity and advantages for this work, or such as have better abilities to per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>form it, or such as have both. And these are of severall sorts.</p>

All you that God hath given more learning and knowledg to, and endued with better parts for utterance, then your neigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bors, God expecteth his duty especially at your hand. The strong are made to help the weak; and those that see must direct the blind.

Christ himself did eat and drink with Publi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cans and sinners, but it was only to be their Physitian, and not their companion. Who knows but God gave you interest in them, to this end, that you might be means of their recovery. They that will not regard the words of another, will regard a brother, or sister, or husband, or wife, or neer friend, Besides that the bond of friendship doth engage you to more kindness and compassion then ordinary.</p>

First, They are at hand. Secondly, They are with men in sickness and dangers, when the ear is more open, and the heart less stubborn then in time of health. He that made a scorn of godli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness before, well then be of another minde, and hear counsel then, if ever he will hear it. Thirdly, Besides, they look upon their Phy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sitian as a man in whose hand is their life: or at least may do much to save them, and therefore they will the more regardfully hear his advice. O therefore you that are of this honourable profession, do not think this a work besides your calling, as if it belonged to none but Ministers; except you think it besides your calling to be com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>passionate, or to be Christians. O help therefore to fit your pati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ents for heaven: and whether you see they are for Life or for Death, teach them both how to live and to dye, and give them some Physick for their souls, as you do for their bodies. Blessed be God that very many of the chief Physitians of this Age have by their eminent piety vindicated their profession from the common imputation of Atheism and prophaness.</p>

ANother sort that have excellent advantages for this duty, is men that have wealth and authority, and are of great place and command in the world, especially that have many that live in dependance on them. O what a world of good might Gentlemen, and Knights, and Lords do, that have a great many of Tenants, and that are the leaders of the Country, if they had but hearts to improve their interest and advantage. Little do you that are such think of the duty that lies upon you in this! Have you not all your honor and riches from God? and is it not evident then that you must employ them for the best advantage of his service? Do you not know who hath said, that to whom men commit much, from them they will expect the more? You have the greatest op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portunities
<pb n="506" facs="tcp:61132:292"/>
to do good of most men in the world; Your Tenants dare not contradict you, lest you dispossess them or their children, of their habitations; They fear you more then they do God him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>self; Your frown will do more with them, then the threatnings of the Scripture, They will sooner obey you, then God: If you speak to them for God and their souls, you may be regarded, when even a Minister that they fear not, shall be despised. If they do but see you favor the way of Godliness, they will lightly counterfeit it at least, to please you, especially if they live within the reach of your observation. O therefore, as you value the honor of God, your own comfort, and the Salvation of souls, improve your in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terest to the utmost for God. Go visit your Tenants and neigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bors houses, and see whether they worship God in their families; and take all opportunities to press them to their duties. Do not despise them, because they are poor or simple: Remember, God is no respecter of persons, your flesh is of no better mettal then theirs, nor wil the worms spare your faces or hearts any more then theirs; nor will your bones or dust bear the badge of your Gentility, you must all be equals when you stand in Judgment. And therefore help the soul of a poor man as well as if he were a Gentleman: And let men see that you excell others as much in piety, heavenliness, compassion, and diligence in Gods work, as you do in riches and honor in the world.</p>

I intend not these instructions so much to teachers, as to o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers, and therefore I shall say but little to them: and if all, or most Ministers among us were as faithfull and diligent as some, I would say nothing.

O do not propound any low and base ends to your selves. This is the end of your calling, let it be also the end of your endeavors.<note place="margin">Act. 20. &amp; 26.18.</note> God forbid that you should spend a weeks study to please the people; or to seek the advancing of you own reputations. Dare you appear in the Pulpit on such a business, and speak for your selves, when you are sent, and pretend to speak for Christ? Dare you spend that time, and wit, and parts for your selves? And wast the Lords day in seeking applause, which God hath set apart for himself? O what notorious sacriledge is this! Set out the work of God as skilfully and adornedly as you can: But still let the winning of souls be your end, and let all your studies and labors be serviceable thereto. Let not the window be so painted, as to keep out the light; but alwayes Judg that the best means, that most conduceth to the end. Do not think that God is best served by a neat, starched, laced Oration: But that he is the able, skilful Minister, that is best skilled in the art of instructing, convincing, perswading, and so winning of souls: and that is the best Sermon that is best in these. When you once grow other<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wise minded, and seek not God, but your selves, God will make you the basest and most contemptible of men, as you make your selves the most sinfull and wretched. Hath not this brought down the Ministery of England once already? It is true of your reputa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, as Christ saith of your lives; They that will save them shall lose them. O let the vigor also of your perswasions shew, that you are sensible on how weighty a business you are sent. O Preach with that seriousness, and fervor, as men that believe their own doctrine; and that know their hearers must either be prevailed with, or be damned. What you would do to save them from E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verlasting burning, that do, while you have the opportunity, and price in your hand: that people may discern that you are in good sadness, and mean as you speak: and that you are not stageplayers, but preachers of the doctrine of Salvation. Remember what <hi>Cicero</hi> saith, that if the matter be never so combustible, yet if you put not fire to it, it will not burn: And what <hi>Erasmus</hi> saith, that a hot Iron will pierce when a cold one will not; And if the wise men of the world account you mad, say as <hi>Paul,</hi>

THe second and chief word of advice that I would give you, is this, Do not think that all your work is in your studies, and in the Pulpit. I confesse that is great, but alas, it is but a small part of your task. You are Shepheards, and must know every sheep, and what is their disease, and mark their strayings, and help to cure them, and fetch them home. <hi>If the paucity of Ministers in great congregations (which is the great unobserved mischief in Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land, that cryes for reformation)</hi> did not make it a thing impossible in many places, I should charge the Ministers of England with most notorious unfaithfulness, for neglecting so much the rest of their work, which calleth for their diligence as much as publike Preaching. O learn of <hi>Paul, Act.</hi> 20.19, 20, 31. to preach publik<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, and from house to house night and day with tears. Let there not be a soul in your charge that shall not be particulary instructed and watched over. Go from house to house daily, and enquire how they grow in knowledg, and holiness, and on what grounds they build their hopes of salvation: and whether they walk uprightly, and perform the duties of their severall relations; and use the means to increase their abilities. See whether they daily worship God in their families, and set them in a way, and teach them how to do it: Confer with them about the doctrines and practice of Religion, and how they receive and profit by publike teaching: and answer all their carnal objections; keep in familiarily with them, that you may maintain your interest in them, and improve all your interest for God. See that no seducers do creep in among them, or if they do, be diligent to countermine them, and preserve your people from infection of Heresies or Schismes: or if they be infected, be diligent to procure their recovery; Not with passion and lordliness, but with patience and condescension: As <hi>Musculus</hi> did by the Anabaptists, visiting them in Prison where the Magistrate had cast them, and there instructing and relieving them, and though they reviled him when he came, and called him a false prophet, and Antichristian seducer, that thirsted for their blood, yet he would not so leave them, till at last by his meekness
<pb n="509" facs="tcp:61132:293" rendition="simple:additions"/>
and love he had overcome them, and recovered many to the truth and to unity with the Church.</p>
                        <p>Have a watchful eye upon each particular sheep in your flock: Do not do as the lazy separatists, that gather a few of the best to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether, and take then only for their charge, leaving the rest to sink or swim, and giving them over to the Divel and their lusts, and except it be by a Sermon in the Pulpit, scarce ever endeavoring their salvation, nor once looking what becomes of them. O let it not be so with you! If any be weak in the faith, receive him, but not to doubtful disputations. If any be too careless of their duties, and too little savor the things of the Spirit, let them be pittied, and not neglected;<note place="margin">Rom. 14.1.</note> If any walk scandalously, and disorderly, deal with them for their recovery with all diligence, and patience; and set before them the hainousness and danger of their sin: If they prove obsti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nate after all, then avoid them and cast them off; But do not so cruelly as to unchurch them by hundreds &amp; by thousands and separ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ate from them as so many Pagans, and that before any such means hath been used for their recovery. If they are ignorant, it may be your fault as much as theirs; and however, they are fitter to be in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>structed then rejected; except they absolutely refuse to be taught. Christ will give you no thanks for keeping, or putting out such from his School, that are unlearned, when their desire or will is to be taught. I confesse it is easier to shut out the ignorant, then to bestow our pains night and day in teaching them; but wo to such slothful, unfaithful servants! Who then is a faithful and a wise servant,<note place="margin">Mat. 24 45.46</note> whom his Lord hath made Ruler over his houshold, to give them their meat in due season, according to every ones age and capacity? Blessed is that servant, whom his Lord, when he cometh, shall finde so doing. O, be not asleep while the woolfe is waking! Let your eye be quick in observing the dangers and strayings of your people. If jealousies, heart burnings, or contentions arise a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mong them, quench them before they break out into raging, un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>resistible flames: As soon as you discern any turn worldly, or proud, or factious, or self-conceited, or disobedient, or cold, and sloth<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful in his duty; delay not, but presently make out for his recovery: Remember how many are loosers in the loss of a soul.</p>

make an noise on it: And that other Proverb, <hi>Multi sunt qui Boves stimulant, pauci aratores,</hi> Many can prick the Oxen, but few can Plow; so many Preachers can talk loud and earnestly, but few can guide their Flock aright, or open to them solidly the mysteries of the Gospel, and shew the true mean betwixt the extreams of con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary errors: I know both must be done; Holding the Plow with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out driving the Oxen, doth nothing and driving without holding, maketh mad work, and is worse then nothing: But yet remember, that every Plow-boy can drive, but to guide is more difficult, and therefore belongeth to the Master Workman; The violence of the Natural motion of the Windes can drive on the Ship; but there is necessary a Rational motion to guide and govern it, or else it will quickly be on the Rocks or Shelves, either broke or sunk, and had better lye still in the Harbor, or at Anchor: The horses that have no Reason can set the Coach or Cart a going, but if there be not some that have reason to guide them, it were better stand still. O therefore let me bespeak you, my brethren, in the Name of the Lord, especially those that are more young and weak, that you tremble at the greatness of this holy Imployment, and run not up into a Pulpit as boldly as into the Market place; Study and Pray, and Pray and Study, till you are become Workmen that need not be ashamed,<note place="margin">2 Tim. 2.15.</note> rightly dividing the Word of Truth, that your people may not be ashamed, or aweary to hear you; But that besides your clear unfolding of the Doctrine of the Gospel, you may also be Masters of your peoples Affections, and may be as potent in your divine Rhetorick, as <hi>Cicero</hi> in his Humane, who, as it is is said, while he pleaded for <hi>Ligarius, Arma de impe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ratoris quantumvis irati manu excusserit, &amp; misero supplici veniam impetrarit.</hi> Or as it said of excellent <note n="*" place="margin">Bucholcerus <hi>in rostra sua &amp; mediae concio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nis suggestum nunquam as<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cendit, quin de cordibus hominum ipsis quos fere vellet affectus excuteret.

One party would pluck up the hedge of government, as if the vine-yard could not be fruitful, except it lye wast to the pleasure of all the beasts of of the Forest.

where is that peaceable association of waters?

Lord, if this be the case of England, let us rather be whipt and whipt again, then turned out of thy School, and from under thy government. We feel now how those are mistaken, that think the way for the Churches unity, is to dig up the banks and let all loose, that every man in Religion may do what his list.</p>

It striketh me sometimes into an amazement with admiration, that it should be possible for such mountains of pride, to remain in the hearts of many godly, reverend Ministers!

The same God is the God both of Truth and Peace: the same Christ is the Prince of Peace, and Author of Salvation; the same Word is the Gospel of Peace and Salvation: both have the same causes, both are wrought and carried on by the same Spirit, the same Persons are the Sons of Peace and Salvation: so inseparably do they go hand in hand together.

THe last whom I would perswade to this great Work of helping others to the Heavenly Rest, is Parents, and Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sters of Families: All you that God hath intrusted with Children or Servants, O consider what Duty lyeth on you for the furthe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring of their Salvation. That this Exhortation may be the more ef<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fectual with you, I will lay down these several Considerations for you seriously to think on.</p>

And how well is God pleased with this in <hi>Abraham,</hi> Gen. 18.19. <hi>Shall I hide from</hi> Abraham <hi>that thing which I do? For I know him, that he will com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mand his Children, and his Houshold after him, that they shall keep the way of the Lord,</hi> &amp;c. And it is <hi>Joshuaes</hi> Resolution, <hi>That he and his Houshold will serve the Lord.</hi>

                        <p n="2">2. It is a duty that you ow, your children in point of Justice; from you they received the defilement and misery of their natures; and therefore you ow them all possible help for their recovery<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> If you had but hurt a stranger, yea, though against your will, you would think it duty to help to cure him.</p>
                        <p n="3">3. Consider how neer your children are to you, and then you will perceive, that from this Natural Relation also, they have in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terest in your utmost help: your children are, as it were, parts of your selves; If they prosper when you are dead, you take it almost as if you lived and prospered in them. If you labor never so much, you think it not ill bestowed, nor your buildings, or purchases too dear, so that they may enjoy them when you are dead: and should you not be of the same minde for their everlasting Rest?</p>
                        <p n="4">4. You will else be witnesses against your own souls: your great care<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> and pains, and cost for their bodies, will condemn you for; your neglect of their pretious souls; you can spend your selves in toyling and caring for their bodies, and even neglect your own souls, and venture them sometimes upon unwarrantable courses, and all to provide for your Posterity; and have you not as much reason to provide for their souls? Do you not believe that your children must be everlastingly happy or miserable when
<pb n="529" facs="tcp:61132:304" rendition="simple:additions"/>
this life is ended? and should not that be fore-thought of in the first place?</p>
                        <p n="5">5. Yea, All the very bruit creatures may condemn you; Which of them is not tender of their young? How long will the Hen sit to hatch her Chickens? and how busily scrape for them? and how carefully shelter and defend them? and so will even the most vile and venemous Serpent; and will you be more unnatural and hard-hearted then all these? will you suffer your children to be ungodly and profane, and run on in the undoubted way to damnation, and let them alone to destroy themselves without controll?</p>
                        <p n="6">6. Consider, God hath made your children to be your charge; yea, and your servants too: Every one will confess they are the Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nisters charge, and what a dreadful thing it is for them to neglect them, when God hath told them, That if they tell not the wicked of their sin and danger, their blood shall be required at that Mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sters hands; and is not your charge as great and as dreadful as theirs? Have not you a greater charge of your own Families then any Minister hath? Yea doubtless<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> and your duty, it is to reach, and admonish, and reprove them, and watch over them, and at your hands else will God require the bloud of their souls: The greatest charge it is that ever you were entrusted with, and we to you if you prove unfaithful and betray your trust, and suffer them to be ignorant for want of your teaching, or wicked for want of your admonition or correction!

                        <p n="7">7. Look into the dispositions and lives of your children, and see what a work there is for you to do. First, It is not one sin that you must help them against, but thousands; their name is Legion, for they are many; It is not one weed that must be pulled up, but the field is overspread with them. Secondly, And how hard is it to prevail against any one of them? They are Hereditary diseases, bred in their Natures. <hi>Naturam expell<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

Besides, the things you must teach them are quite above them, yea, &amp; clean contrary to the interest and desires of their Flesh; how hard is it to teach a man to be willing to be poor, and despised, and destroyed here for Christ! to deny themselves, and displease the flesh, to forgive an Enemy, to love those

that hate us, to watch against temptations, to avoid occasions and appearance of evil, to believe in a crucified Saviour, to rejoyce in tribulation, to trust upon a bare word of Promise, and let go all in hand (if call'd to it) for something in hope that they never saw, nor ever spake with man that did see; to make God their chief delight and love, and to have their hearts in heaven while they live on earth; I think none of this is easie; they think otherwise let them try and Judg; yet all this must be learned, or they are undone for ever. If you help them not to some Trade, they cannot live in the world, but if they be destitute of these things, they shall not live in hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven; If the Marriner be not skilful he may be drowned, and if the Souldier be not skilful he may be slain; but they that cannot do the things above mentioned will perish for ever; <hi>For without holiness none shall see God,</hi> Heb. 12.14. O that the Lord would make all you that are Parents sensible what a work and charge doth lye upon you! You that neglect this important work, and talk to your Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>milies of nothing but the world, I tell you, the bloud of souls lyes on you, make as light of it as you will, if you repent not and amend, the Lord will shortly call you to an account for your guilti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness of your childrens everlasting undoing; and then you that could finde in your hearts to neglect the souls of your own children, will be judged more barbarous then the <hi>Irish</hi> or <hi>Turks,</hi> that kill the children of others.</p>
                        <p n="8">8. Consider also what a world of sorrows do you prepare for your selves by the neglect of your children: First, You can ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pect no other but that they should be thorns in your very eyes, and you may thank your selves if they prove so, seeing they are thorns of your own planting. Secondly, If you should repent of this your negligence, and be saved your selves, yet is it nothing to you to think of the damnation of your children? You know, God hath said, <hi>That except they be born again they shall not enter into the Kingdom of God.</hi> Methinks then it should be a heart-breaking to all you that have unregenerate children; Methinks you should weep over them every time you look them in the face, to remember that they are in the way to eternal fire! Some people would lament the fate of their children, if but a Wizard should foretel them some ill fortune to befall them; and do you not regard it, when the Living God shall tell you, <hi>That the wicked shall be turned into hell, and all they that forget God?</hi> Psal. 9.17. Thirdly, Yet all this

were not so doleful to you, if it were a thing that you had no hand in, or could do nothing to help; but to think that all this is much long of you! that ever your negligence should bring your childe to these everlasting torments, which the very damned man (<hi>Luke</hi> 16.) would have had his brethren been warned to escape; if this seem light to thee, thou hast the heart of a hellish Fiend in thee, and not of a man. Fourthly, But yet worse then all this will it prove to you, if you die in this sin; for then you shall be miserable as well as they; and O what a greeting will there be then between un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>godly Parents and children! what a hearing will it be to your tormented souls, to hear your children cry out against you, All this that we suffer was long of you, you should have taught us better, and did not; you should have restrained us from sin, and corrected us, but you did not; what an addition will such out-cries be to your misery?</p>
                        <p n="9">9. On the other side, do but think with your selves; what a world of comfort you may have if you be faithful in this duty: First, If you should not succeed, yet you have freed your own souls, and though it be sad, yet not so sad, for you may have peace in your own consciences, Secondly, But if you do succeed, the comfort is unexpressible. For first, Godly children will be truly loving to your selves that are their Parents; when a little riches or matters of this world, will oft make ungodly children to cast off their very natural affection: secondly, Godly children will be most obedient to you; They dare not disobey and provoke you, because of the command of God, except you should command them that which is unlawful, and then they must obey God rather then men: thirdly, And if you should fall into want, they would be most faithful in relieving you, as knowing they are tied by a double bond, of Nature, and of Grace: fourthly, And they will also be helpers to your souls, and to your spiritual comforts; they will be delighting you with the mention of heaven, and with all holy con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ference and actions; when wicked children will be grieving you with cursing, and swearing, or drunkenness, or disobedience: fifthly, Yea, when you are in trouble, or sickness, and at death<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> your godly children will be at hand to advise and to support you; they will strive with God in prayers for you; O what a comfort is it to a Parent, to have a childe that hath the Spirit of Prayer, and interest in God? how much good may they do you by their im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portunity
<pb n="532" facs="tcp:61132:306"/>
with God? And what a sadness is it to have children, that when you lye sick, can do no more but ask you how you do, and look on you in your misery? sixthly, Yea, all your Family may fare the better, for one childe or servant that feareth God; (yea per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>haps all the Town where he liveth:) As <hi>Josephs</hi> case proveth, and <hi>Jacobs,</hi> and many the like; when one wicked childe may bring a Judgment o<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                        <p n="10">10. Consider further, That the very welfare of Church and State lyeth mainly on this duty, of well educating children; and without this, all other means are like to be far less successful. I seri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ously profess to you, that I verily think all the sins and miseries of the Land, may acknowledg this sin for their great Nurse and Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pagator. O what happy Churches might we have, if Parents did their duties to their children! then we need not exclude so many for ignorance or scandal, nor have our Churches composed of mem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bers so rude! then might we spare most of the quarrels about Dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cipline, Reformation, Toleration, and Separation; any reasona<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble government would do better with a well-taught people, then the best will do with the ungodly. It is not good Laws and Or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders that will reform us, if the men be not good, and Reformation begin not at home; when children go wicked from the hands of their Parents, thence some come such to the Universities, and so we come to have an ungodly Ministry; and in every profession they bring this fruit of their Education with them; when Gentlemen teach their children onely to Hunt, and Hawk, and game, and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ride the godly, what Magistrates, and what Parliaments, and so what Government, and what a Commonwealth are we like to have? when all must be guided by such as these? some perverse in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>considerate persons, lay the blame of all this on the Ministers, that
<pb n="533" facs="tcp:61132:306" rendition="simple:additions"/>
people of all sorts are so ignorant and profane, as if one man can do the work of many hundreds! I beseech you that are Masters and Parents, do your own duties, and free Ministers from these unjust aspersions, and the Church from her reproach and confusion; Have not Ministers work enough of their own to do? O that you knew what it is that lieth on them! And if besides this, you wil cast upon them the work of every Master and Parent in the Parish, it is like indeed to be well done: How many sorts of Workmen must there be to the building of an house? and if all of them should cast it upon one, and themselves do nothing, you may judg how much were like to be done! If there be three or four Schoolmasters in a School, amongst three or four hundred Scholars; &amp; all the lower that should fit them for the higher Schools, should do nothing at all, but send all these Scholars to the highest Schoolmaster as ignorant as they re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived them, would not his life be a burden to him, and all the work be frustrate and spoiled? Why so it is here: The first work towards the reforming and making happy of Church and Commonwealth lies in the good education of your children; the most of this is your work; and if this be left undone, and then they come to Ministers raw and ignorant, and hardned in their sins; alas what can a Minister do! whereas if they came trained up in the Principles of Religion, and the practice of godliness, and were taught the fear of God in their youth; O what an encouragement would it be to Ministers! and how would the work go on in their hands! I tell you seriously, this is the cause of all our miseries and unreformedness in Church and State; even the want of a holy education of children! Many lay the blame, on this neglect, and that but there is none hath so great a hand in it as this: what a School must there needs be where all are brought raw, as I said, to the highest School? what a house must there needs be built, when Clay is brought to the Masons hands in stead of Bricks? What a Commonwealth may be expe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cted, if all the Constables and Justices should do nothing but cast all upon King and Parliament? And so, what a Church may we expect, when all the Parents and Masters in the Parish shall cast all their duty on their Ministers? Alas, how long may we Catechise them, and preath to them, before we can get them to understand the very Principles of the Faith? This, this is the cause of our Churches deformities, and this is the cause of the present difficulty of Reformation.

if the persons that live under it be not prepared. Perhaps you'l say, the Apostles had not their hearers thus prepared to their hands: Is not the word the first means of conversion?</p>
                        <p>
                           <hi>Answ.</hi> 1. The Apostles preached to none at first but Infidels and Pagans: And are you no better? Will you do no more for your children then they?</p>
                        <p n="2">2. All the success of their labors, was to gather here and there a Church from among the world of unbelievers: but now the Kingdoms of the world are become the Kingdoms of the Lord and his Christ.</p>
                        <p n="3">3. And yet the Apostles were extraordinarily qualified for the work, and seconded it by Miracles, for the convincing of their hearers.</p>
                        <p n="4">4. I do verily believe that if Parents did their duty as they ought<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> the word publikly preached would not be the ordinary means of Regeneration in the Church, but only without the Church, among Infidels. Not that I believe Doctor <hi>Burges,</hi> and Master <hi>Bedfords</hi> doctrine of Baptismal Regeneration: But God would pour out his grace so upon the children of his peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple, and hear prayers for them, and bless such endeavors for their holy education, that we should see the promises made good to our seed; and the unthankful Anabaptists, that will not confesse that the children of the Saints are any neerer God, or more beholden to him then Pagans, so much as for the favor to be visible Church-members, should by sweet experience be convinced of their error, and be taught better how to understand, that our children are holy.</p>
                        <p n="2">II. I intreat you that are parents also to consider, what ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cellent advantages you have above all others for the saving of your children.</p>
                        <p n="1">1. They are under your hands while they are young and tender and flexible; But they come to Ministers when they are grown eld<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er, and stiffer, and settled in their wayes, and think themselves too good to be catechised, and too old to be taught. You have a twigg to bend, and we an oake. You have the young plants of sin to pluck up, and we the deep rooted vices. The consciences of children are not so seared with a custome of sinning and long resisting grace, as others. You have the soft and tender earth to plow in, and we have the hard and stony wayes, that have been

trodden on by many yeers practice of evil. When they are young' their understandings are like a sheet of white paper, that hath no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing written on; and so you have opportunity to write what you will. But when they are grown up in sin, they are like the same paper written over with falshoods; which must all be blot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed out again, and truth written in the place: and how hard is that? We have a double task, first to unteach them, and then to teach them better; but you have but one. We must unteach them all that the world, and flesh, and wicked company, and the divel have been diligently teaching them in many yeers time. We have hardened hearts to beat on, like a Smiths Anvile, that will not feel us: We may tell them of death and Judgment, heaven and hell, and they hear us as if they were asleep or dead; you have the soft clay to mold, and we the hardened burned bricks. You have them be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore they are possessed with prejudice, and false conceits against the truth: but we have them to teach, when they have many yeers lived among those that have scorned at godliness, and taught them to think Gods wayes to be foolish preciseness.

Why now what an advantage have you, to use all this for the further<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance of their happiness? and possess them as strongly beforehand against sin, as else <hi>Satan</hi> would do for it; and so <hi>Satan</hi> should come to them upon some of those disadvantages that now Christ comes on.</p>
                        <p n="2">2. Consider also, that you have the affections of your Children more then any others: None in the world hath that interest in their hearts as you. You will receive that counsel from an un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>doubted friend, that you would not do from an enemy, or a strang<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er. VVhy now, your children cannot choose but know that you are their friends, and advise them in love: and they cannot choose but love you again. Their love is loose and arbitrary to others: but
<pb n="536" facs="tcp:61132:308"/>
to you it is determinate and fast; nature hath almost necessitated them to love you. O therefore improve this your interest in them for their good.</p>
                        <p n="3">3. You have also the greatest authority over them. You may command them, and they dare not disobey you; or else it is your owne fault, for the most part; for you can make them obey you in your business in the world. Yea you may correct them to in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>force obedience. Your authority also is the most unquestioned authority in the world. The authority of Kings and Parliaments, hath been disputed, but yours is past dispute. And therefore if you use it not to constrain them to the works of God, you are with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out excuse,</p>
                        <p n="4">4. Besides, their whole dependance is on you for their mainte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nance and livelihood. They know you can either give them, or deny them what you have; and so punish or reward them at your pleasure. But on Ministers or neighbors they have no such depen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dance.</p>
                        <p n="5">5. Moreover, you that are parents, know the temper, and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clinations of your children, what vices they are most inclined to, and what instruction or reproof they most need; But Ministers that live more strange to them, cannot know this.</p>
                        <p n="6">6. Above all you are ever with them, and so have opportunity as to know their faults, so to apply the remedy, You may be still talking to them of the word of God, and minding them of their state and duty; and may follow and set home every word of advice: as they are in the house with you, or in the shop, or in the feild at work; O what an excellent advantage is this, if God do but give you hearts to use it. Especially you mothers, remember this: you are more with your children while they are little ones then their fathers; be you therefore still teaching them as soon as ever they are capable of learning. You cannot do God such eminent service your selves, as men, but you may train up children that may do it, and then you will have part of the comfort and honor. <hi>Bathsheba</hi> had part of the honor of <hi>Solomons</hi> wisdom <hi>Pro.</hi> 31.1. for she taught him.

What a deal of pains are you at with the bodies of your children more then the fathers? And what do you suffer to bring them into the world? and will not you be at as much pains for the saving of their souls? You are naturally of more tender affections then men: and will it not move you to think that your children, should perish for ever? O therefore I beseech you for the sake of the children of your bowels, teach them, admonish them, watch over them, and give them no rest till you have brought them over to Christ.</p>
                        <p>And thus I have shewed you reason enough to make you dili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gent in teaching your children, if reason will serve, as me thinks a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mong reasonable creatures it should do.</p>

                        <p>LEt us next hear what is usually objected against this by negli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gent men.</p>
                        <p>
                           <hi>Object.</hi> 1. We do not see but those children prove as bad as others, that are taught the Scriptures and brought up so holily: And those prove as honest men and good neighbors, that have none of this ado with them.</p>
                        <p>
                           <hi>Answ.</hi> 1. O who art thou man that disputest against God? Hath God charged you to teach your children diligently his word, speaking of it as you sit at home, and as you walk abroad, as you lye down and as you rise up, <hi>Deut.</hi> 6.6, 7, 8. and dare you reply that it is as good let it alone? VVhy this is to set God at defiance; and as it were to spit in his face, and give him the lye. VVill you take it well at your servants, if when you command them to do a thing, they should return you such an answer, that they do not see but it were as good let it alone? VVretched worm! darest thou thus lift up thy head against the Lord that made thee and must judg thee? Is it not he that commandeth thee? If thou dost not believe that this Scripture is his word, thou dost not believe in Je<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sus Christ: for thou hast nothing else to tell thee that there is a Christ. And if thou do believe that this is the word of God, how darest thou say, It is as good disobey it? This is devillish pride in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed, when such sottish sinful dust shall think themselves wiser then the living God, &amp; take upon them to reprove and cancel his word.</p>
                        <p n="2">
                           <pb n="538" facs="tcp:61132:309"/>2. But alas, you know not what honesty is, when you say, that the ignorant are as honest as others: You think those are the honestest men, that best please you: But I know those are the most honest, that best please God. Christ saith in <hi>Luk</hi> 8.15. that an ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nest heart is that which keepeth the word of God; and you say, they are as honest that reject it. God made men to please him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>self, and not to please you: And you may know by his Laws who please him best. The Commandments have two Tables; and the first is, Thou shalt love the Lord with all thy heart: and the se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cond, Thou shalt love thy neighbor as thy self. First seek the Kingdom of God, and his Righteousness, <hi>Mat.</hi> 6.33.</p>
                        <p n="3">3. And what if some prove naught that are well brought up? It is not the generality of them: will you say that <hi>Noahs</hi> family was no better then the drowned world, because there was one <hi>Chaus</hi> in it? Nor <hi>Davids,</hi> because there was one <hi>Absalom</hi>? Nor Christs, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause there was one <hi>Judas</hi>?</p>
                        <p n="4">4. But what if it were so? Have men need of the less teaching, or the more? you have more wit in the matters of this world: you will not say, I see many labor hard, and yet are poor, and therefore it is as good never labor at all; you will not say, Many that go to School learn nothing, and therefore they may learn as much though they never go. Or, many that are great trades<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men break, and therefore it is as good never trade at all. Or many great eaters are as lean as others, and many sick men recover no strength, though they eat; and therefore it is as good for men ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver to eat more. Or, many plow and sow, and have nothing comes up; and therefore it is as go <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 span">

                           </gap> thus? And is not he a thousand times worse, that shall reason thus for mens souls? <hi>Peter</hi> reasons the clean contrary way, <hi>If the righteous be scarcely saved, where shall the ungodly and the sinner appear?</hi> 1 <hi>Pet.</hi> 4.18. And so doth Christ, <hi>Luk.</hi> 13.24. <hi>Strive to enter in at the strait gate, for many shall seek to enter, and not be able.</hi> Other mens miscariages should quicken our diligence; and not make us cast away all. VVhat would you think of that man, that should look over into his neighbors garden, and because he sees here and there a nettle or weed among much better stuffe should say; Why, you may see, these men that bestow so much pains in digging and weeding, have weeds in their garden as well as I that do nothing, and therefore
<pb n="539" facs="tcp:61132:309" rendition="simple:additions"/>
who would be at so much pains? Just thus doth the mad world talk. You may see now, those that pray, and read, and follow Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mons, have their faults as well as we, and have wicked persons among them as well as we; Yea, but that is not the whole garden, as yours is, it is but here and there a weed, and as soon as they spy it, they pluck it up, and cast it away.</p>
                        <p n="4">4. But however, if such men be as wicked as you im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>agine, can you for shame lay the fault upon the Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, or Ordinances of God? Do they finde any thing in the Scriptures to encourage them to sin? You may far better say, It is long of the Judg and the Law which hangs them, that there are so many Theeves. Did you ever read a word for sin in the Scripture? Or ever hear a Minister, or godly man perswade people to sin, or from it rather? (I speak not of Sectaries, who usually grow to be enemies to Scripture) Lord, what horrible im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pudence is in the faces of ungodly men? When a Minister hath spent himself in studying and perswading his people from sin; or when Parents have done all they can to reform their children, yet people will say, it is long of this that they are so bad. What? will reproving and correcting for sin bring them soonest to it? I dare challenge any man breathing, to name any one Ruler that ever was in the world, that was so severe against sin as Jesus Christ, or to shew me any Law that ever was made in the world so severe against sin as the Laws of God! And yet must it be long of Christ and Scripture that men are evil? When he threatneth damnation against impenitent sinners, is it yet long of him? Yea, see how these wicked men contradict themselves? What is it that they hate the Scripture for, but that it is so strict and precise, and forbids them their pleasures and fleshly liberties? that is, their sins. And yet if any fall into sin, they will blame the Scripture, that forbids it. I know in these late yeers of licenciousness and Apostacy, many that talk much of Religion, prove guilty of grievous crimes: But then they turn away so far from Christ and Scripture. As bad as the godly are, I dare yet challenge you to shew me any society un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der Heaven like them that most study and delight in the Scriptures: or any School like the Scholars of Christ. Because parents cannot by all their diligence get their children to be as good as they should be, shall they therefore leave them to be as bad as they will? Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause they cannot get them to be perfect Saints, shall they there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
<pb n="540" facs="tcp:61132:310"/>
leave them to be as incarnate divels? Certainly your children untaught, will be little better.</p>

                        <p>
                           <hi>Answ.</hi> 1. It is first your duty, and then the Ministers; It will be no excuse for you, because it is their Work, except you could prove it were onely theirs: Magistrates must govern both you and your children, doth it therefore follow that you must not govern them? It belongs to the Schoolmaster to correct them, and doth it not belong also to you? There must go many hands to this great Work, as to the building of a house there must be many Work<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men, one to one part, and another to another; and as your corn must go through many hands before it be bread; the Reapers, the Threshers, the Millers, the Bakers, and one must not leave their part, and say it belongs to the other: so it it is here in the instru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cting of your children: first, you must do your work, and then the Minister must do his; you must be doing it privately night and day; the Minister must do it publikely, and privately as oft as he can.</p>
                        <p n="2">2. But as the case now stands with the Ministers of <hi>England,</hi> they are disabled from doing that which belongs to their Office, and therefore you cannot now cast your work on them. I will in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stance but in two things. First, It belongs to their Office to govern the Church, and to teach with authority, and great and small are commanded to obey them, <hi>Heb.</hi> 3.7.17. <hi>&amp;c.</hi> But now this is un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>known, and Hearers look on themselves as free men, that may o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bey or not, at their own pleasure: A Parents teaching which is with authority, wil take more, then ones that is taken to have none; People think we have authority to speak to them when they please to hear, and no more. Nay, few of the godly themselves do un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derstand the authority that their Teachers have over them from Christ: They know how to value a Ministers gifts, but not how they are bound to learn of him and obey him, because of his Office. Not that they should obey him in evil, nor that he should be a final decider of all controversies, nor should exercise his authority in things of no moment: But as a Schoolmaster
<pb n="541" facs="tcp:61132:310" rendition="simple:additions"/>
may command his Scholars when to come to School, and what Book to read, and what form to be of; and as they ought to obey him, and to learn of him, and not to set their wits against his, but to take his word, and beleeve him as their Teacher, till they under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stand as well as he, and are ready to leave his School: Just so are people bound to obey and learn of their Teachers, and to take their words, while they are learners, in that which is beyond their present capacity, till they are able to see things in their proper evidence. Now this Ministerial Authoritie is unknown, and so Ministers are the less capable of doing their Work, which comes to pass, first, From the pride of mans nature, especially Novices, which makes men impatient of the Reins of Guidance and Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mand; secondly, From the Popish error of implicite Faith; to avoid which we are driven as far into the contrary extream: thirdly, From the usurpation of the late Prelates, who took almost all the Government from the Ministers, and thereby overthrew the very essence of the Office, by robbing it of that part which is as essential, at least, as preaching; fourthly<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> And from the modesty of Ministers, that are loth to shew their Commission, and make known their Authoritie, lest they should be thought proud: As if a Schoolmaster should let his Scholars do what their list; or a Pilot let the Seamen run the Ship whither they will, for fear of being thought proud in exercising their authoritie. Secondly, But a far greater clog then this yet, doth lie upon the Ministers, which <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                              <desc>•</desc>
                           </gap>ew take notice of; and that is, The fewness of Ministers, and the great<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness of Congregations. In the Apostles times every Church had a multitude of Ministers (and so it must be again, or we shall never come neer that Primitive patern;) and then they could preach publikely, and from house to house: But now, when there is but one or two Ministers to many thousand souls, we cannot so much as know them, much less teach them one by one: It is as much as we can do to discharge the publike Work. So that you see, you have little reason to cast your Work on the Ministers, but should the more help them by your diligence, in your several families, because they are already so over burdened.</p>

teach them the Scriptures; we have somewhat else for them to do. <hi>Answ.</hi> And are not poor men subject to God, as well as rich? and are they not Christians? and must they not give account of their ways? and have not your children souls to save or lose, as well as the rich? cannot you have while to speak to them as they are at their work? have you not time to instruct them on the Lords day? you can finde time to talk idlely, as poor as you are; and you can finde no time to talk of the way to Life! you can finde time on the Lords day for your children to play, or walk or talk in the streets, but no time to minde the life to come. Me thinks you should rather say to your children, I have no Lands or Lordships to leave you; nothing but hard labor and povertie in the world; you have no hope of great matters here; be sure therefore to make the Lord your portion, and to get interest in Christ, that you may be happy hereafter; if you could get riches, they would shortly leave you, but the riches of Grace and Glory will be everlasting. Me thinks, you should say as <hi>Peter, Silver and gold I have none, but such as I have, I give you.</hi> The Kingdoms of the world cannot be had by beggers, but the Kingdom of Heaven may. O what a terrible reckon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing will many poor men have, when Christ shall plead his cause, and judg them! May not he say, I made the way to worldly honors un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>accessible to you, that you might not look after it for your selves, or your children; but Heaven I set open, that you might have nothing to discourage you: I confined riches and honors to a few, but my Blood and Salvation I offered to all, that none might say, I was not invited: I tendered Heaven to the poor, as well as the rich; I made no exception against the meanest begger, that did not wilfully shut out themselves: Why then did you not come your selves, and bring your children, and teach them the way to the eternal Inheritance? Do you say you were poor? Why, I did not set Heaven to sale for money, but I called those that had nothing, to take it freely; onely on condition they would take me for their Saviour and Lord, and give up themselves unfeignedly to me, in obedience and love. What can you answer Christ, when he shall thus convince you? Is it not enough, that your children are poor and miserable here, but you would have them be worse for everlasting too? If your chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren were beggers, yet if they were such beggers as <hi>Lazarus,</hi> they may be conveyed by Angels into the presence of God. But be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leeve it, as God will save no man, because he is a Gentleman, so
<pb n="543" facs="tcp:61132:311" rendition="simple:additions"/>
will be save no man because he is a begger. God hath so ordered it in his providence, that riches are exceeding occasions of mens damnation, and will you think poverty a sufficient excuse? The hardest point in all our work, is to be weaned from the world, and in love with heaven: and if you will not be weaned from it, that have nothing in it but labor and sorrow, you have no excuse. The poor cannot have while, and the rich will not have while, or they are ashamed to be so forward, the young think it too soon, and the old too late: and thus most men in stead of being saved, have somewhat to say against their salvation: and when Christ sendeth to invite them, they say<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> I pray thee have me excused; O unworthy guests of such a blessed feast! and most worthy to be turned into the everlasting burnings.</p>

You know it is not: Do not you think then, that it is so hateful a thing in Satan to entice your children to sin and hell, and to discourage and disswade them from holiness and from heaven, as it is in you. You are bound to love them by nature, more then Satan is. O then what people are those that will teach their children in stead of holiness, to curse and swear, and raile and backbite, to be proud and revengeful, to break the Lords day, and to despise his wayes, to
<pb n="546" facs="tcp:61132:313"/>
speak wantonly, and filthily, to scorn at holiness, and glory in sin! O when God shall ask these children, Where learned you this lan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guage and practice? and they shall say, I learned it of my father or mother; I would not be in the case of those parents for all the world! Alas, is it a work that's worth the teaching, to undo them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves for ever? Or can they not without teaching learn it too easily of themselves? Do you need to teach a Serpent to sting, or a Lyon to be fierce? Do you need to sow weeds in your garden? will they not grow of themselves? To build a house requires skill and teaching: but a little may serve to set a town on fire. To heal the wounded, or the sick, requireth skill: but to make a man sick, or to kill him, requireth but little. You may sooner teach your chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren to swear then to pray; and to mock at godliness, then to be true godly. If these parents were sworn enemies to their chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren, and should study seven yeers how to do them the greatest mischief; they could not possibly finde out a surer way, then by drawing them to sin, and withdrawing them from God.</p>

                        <p>I Shall therefore conclude with this earnest request to all Christi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>an parents that read these lines; that they would have com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>passion on the souls of their poor children, and be faithful to the great trust that God hath put on them. O Sirs, if you cannot do what you would do for them; yet do what you can. Both Church and State, Cities and Countrey, do groan under the neglect of this weighty duty: your children know not God nor his Laws, but take his name in vain, and slieght his worship, and you do neither instruct them nor correct them: and therefore doth God correct both them and you. You are so tender of them, that God is the le<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="2 letters">
                              <desc>••</desc>
                           </gap> tender both of them and you. Wonder not if God make you smart for your childrens sins: for you are guilty of all they commit, by your neglect of doing your duty to reform them, even as he that maketh a man drunk, is guilty of all the sin that he committeth in his drunkenness. VVill you resolve therefore to set upon this duty, and neglect it no longer? Remember <hi>Eli</hi>; your children are like <hi>Moses</hi> in the basket in the water, ready to perish if they have not help. As ever you would not be charged before God for murderers of their souls, and as ever you would not have them
<pb n="547" facs="tcp:61132:313" rendition="simple:additions"/>
cry out against you in everlasting fire, see that you teach them how to escape it, and bring them up in holiness and the fear of God. You have heard that the God of heaven doth flatly command it you: I charge every one of you therefore, upon your allegiance to him, and as you will very shortly answer the contrary at your peril, that you neither refuse nor neglect this most necessary work. If you are not willing now you know it to be so plain and so great a duty, you are flat Rebels, and no true subjects of Christ. If you are willing to do it, but know not how, I will adde a few words of direction to help you. 1. Teach them by your own example, as well as by your words. Be your selves such as you would have them be; practice is the most effectual teaching of children, who are addict<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed to imitation, especially of their parents. Lead them the way to prayer, and reading, and other duties. Be not like base Commanders, that will put on their Soldiers, but not go on them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves. Can you expect your children should be wiser or better then you? Let them not hear those words out of your mouths, nor see those practices in your lives, which you reprove in them. No man shall be saved because his children are godly, if he be un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>godly himself: Who should lead the way in holiness, but the father and master of the family? It is a sad time when he must be account<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed a good master or father, that will not hinder his family from serving God, but will give them leave to go to heaven without him.</p>
                        <p>I will but name the rest for your direct dutie for your Family. 1. You must help to inform their understandings. 2. To store their memories. 3. To rectifie their wills. 4. To quicken their affections. 5. To keep tender their consciences. 6. To restrain their tongues, and help them to skill in gracious Speech. 7. And to reform and watch over their outward conversation.</p>
                        <p>To these ends: First, Be sure to keep them, at least, so long at School, till they can read English. It is a thousand pities that a reasonable Creature should look upon a Bible, as upon a Stone, or a piece of Wood. Secondly, Get them Bibles and good Books, and see that they read them. Thirdly<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> Examine them often what they learn. Fourthly, Especially bestow the Lords day in this work; and see that they spend it not in sports or idleness. Fiftly, Shew them the meaning of what they read and learn, <hi>Josh.</hi> 4 6, 21, 22. <hi>Psal.</hi> 78.4, 5, 6<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> &amp; 34.11. Sixthly, Acquaint them with the godly, and keep them in good company, where they may learn
<pb n="548" facs="tcp:61132:314"/>
good; and keep them out of that company that would teach them evil. Seventhly, Be sure to cause them to learn some Catechism, containing the chief Heads of Divinity; as those made by the Assembly of Divines, or Master <hi>Balls.</hi>

                        <p>THe Heads of Divinity which you must teach them first, are these. 1. That there is one onely God, who is a Spirit, in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>visible, infinite, eternal, Almighty, good, merciful, true, just, holy <hi>&amp;c.</hi> 2. That this God is one in three, Father, Son, and holy Ghost. 3. That he is the Maker, Maintainer, and Lord of all 4. That mans happiness consisteth in the enjoying of this God, and not in fleshly pleasure, profits, or honors. 5. That God made the first man upright and happy, and gave him a Law to keep, with Conditions, that if he kept it perfectly, he should live happy for ever; but if he broke it, he should die. 6. That man broke this Law, and so forfeited his welfare, and became guilty of death, as to himself, and all his Posterity. 7 That Christ, the Son of God, did here interpose, and prevent the full execution, undertaking to die in stead of man, and so to Redeem him: whereupon all things were delivered into his hands as the Redeemer, and he is under that relation the Lord of all. 8. That Christ hereupon did make with man a better Covenant or Law, which proclaimed pardon of sin to all that did but repent and believe &amp; obey sincerely. 9. That he reveal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed this Covenant and Mercy to the world by degrees, first, in dark<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er Promises, Prophecies, and Sacrifices; then in many Ceremonious Types, and then by more plain foretellings by the Prophet<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                              <desc>•</desc>
                           </gap>. 10. That in the fulness of time Christ came, and took our Nature into Union with his Godhead, being conceived by the holy Ghost, and born of the Virgin <hi>Mary.</hi> 11. That while he was on earth, he lived a life of sorrows, was crowned with Thorns<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> and bore the pains that our sins deserved; at last being Crucified to death, and buried, and so satisfied the Justice of God. 12. That he also Preached himself to the <hi>Jews,</hi> and by constant Miracles did prove the truth of his Doctrine and Mediatorship, before thousands of Witnesses: That he revealed more fully his New Law or Covenant, That whosoever will believe in him, and accept him for Saviour,
<pb n="549" facs="tcp:61132:314" rendition="simple:additions"/>
and Lord, shall be pardoned and saved, and have a far greater glory then they lost, and they that will not, shall lye under the curse and guilt, and be condemned to the everlasting fire of hell. 13. That he rose again from the dead, having conquered death, and took fuller possession of his Dominion over all, and so ascended up into heaven, and there reigneth in glory. 14. That before his Ascention he gave charge to his Apostles, to go Preach the foresaid Gospel to all Nations and persons, and to offer Christ and Mercy, and Life, to every one without exception, and to in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>treat, and perswade them to receive him; and that he gave them authority to send forth others on the same Message, and to Baptise, and to gather Churches, and confirm and order them, and to settle a course for a succe<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="3 letters">
                              <desc>•••</desc>
                           </gap>on of Ministers and Ordinances to the end of the world. 15. That he also gave them power to work frequent and evident Miracles for the confirmation of their Doctrine, and the convincing of the world; and to annex their writings to the rest of the Scriptures, and so to finish and seal them up, and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liver them to the world as his infallible Word and Laws, which none must dare to alter, and which all must observe. 16. That for all this free Grace is offered to the world, yet the heart is by Nature so desperately wicked, that no man will believe and enter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain Christ sincerely, except by an Almighty power he be changed and born again; and therefore doth Christ send forth his Spir<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                              <desc>•</desc>
                           </gap>t with his Word, which secretly and effectually worketh holiness in the hearts of the Elect, drawing them to God, and the Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deemer. 17. That the means by which Christ worketh and pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>serveth this Grace, is the Word Read and Preached, together with frequent <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                              <desc>•</desc>
                           </gap>ervent Prayer, Meditation, Sacraments, gracious Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ference; and it is much furthered also by special Providences, keeping us from temptations, fitting Occurrences to our ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vantage, drawing us by Mercies, and driving us by Afflictions; and therefore it must be the great and daily care of every Christian to use faithfully all the said Ordinaces, and improve the said pro<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>vidences. 18. That though the new Law or Covenant be an easie yoak, and there is nothing to be grievous in Christs Commands, yet so bad are our hearts, and so strong our temptations, and so diligent our enemies, that whosoever will be saved, he must strive, and watch, and bestow his utmost care and pains, and deny his flesh, and forsake all that would draw him from Christ, and herein
<pb n="550" facs="tcp:61132:315"/>
continue to the end, and overcome. And because this cannot be done without continual supplies of Grace, whereof Christ is the onely Fountain, therefore we must live in continual dependance on him, by Faith, and know, That our life is hid with God in him. 19. That Christ will thus by his Word and Spirit gather him a Church of all the elect out of the world, which is his body and spouse, and he their head and husband, and will be tender of the<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                              <desc>•</desc>
                           </gap> as the apple of his eye, and preserve them from dangers; and continue among them his presence and ordinances, And that the members of this Church must live together in most entire Love and Peace, delighting themselves in God and his worship, and the fore-thoughts and mention of their everlasting happiness; for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bearing and forgiving one another, and <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="3 letters">
                              <desc>•••</desc>
                           </gap>ieving each other in need, as if that which they have were their brothers. And all men ought to strive to be of this society. Yet will the visible Churches be still mixt of good and bad. 20. That when the fall number of these elect are called home, Christ will come down from heaven again, and raise all the dead, and set them before him to be judged: And all that have loved God above all, and be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieved in Christ, and been willing that he should reign over them, and have improved their mercies in the day of grace, them he will Justifie, and sentence them to inherit the Everlasting Kingdom of Glory, and those that were not such, he will condemn to Ever<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lasting fire; Both which sentences shall be then executed accord<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ingly.</p>

And here shew them. 1. The Autho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity commanding, that is, the Almighty God, by Christ the Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deemer. They are not now to look at command, as coming from God immediatly, meerly as God, or the Creator, but as coming
<pb n="551" facs="tcp:61132:315"/>
from God by Christ the Mediator, who is now the Lord of all, and only Lawgiver; seeing the father now Judgeth no man, but hath committed all Judgment to the Son, <hi>John</hi> 5.22, 23, 24. 2. Shew them the tearms on which duty is required, and the ends of it. 3. And the nature and duties, and the way to perform them aright. 4. And the right order, that they first love God above all, and then their neighbor: first seek the Kingdom of God and his righteousness. 5. Shew them the excellencies and delights of Gods service. 6. And the flat necessity. 7. Especially labor to get all their hearts, and teach them not only to speak the words.</p>
                        <p>And for sin, shew them its evil and danger, and watch over them against it. Especially 1. The sins that youth is commonly addicted to. 2. And which their nature and constitution most leads them to. 3. And which the time and place do most strongly tempt to, 4. But specially be sure to kill their killing sins: those that all are prone to, and are of all most deadly; as Pride, Worldliness, Igno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rance, Profaneness, and Flesh-pleasing.</p>
                        <p>And for the manner, you must do all this. 1. Betime, before sin get rooting. 2. Frequently. 3. Seasonably. 4. Seriously and diligently. 5. Affectionatly and tenderly. 6. And with authori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty; compelling, where commanding will not serve, and adding correction where instruction is frustrate,</p>

It is a Truth too evident, which an incon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>siderate Zealot reprehended in Master <hi>CULVERWELL</hi> as an Error, That many of Gods Children do not enjoy that sweet Life, and blessed Estate in this World, which God their Father hath provided for them: That is, Which he offereth them in his Promises, and chargeth
<pb n="556" facs="tcp:61132:319"/>
upon them as their duty in his Precepts, and bringeth even to their hands in all his Means and Mercies. God hath set open Heaven to us in his Word, and told every humble sincere Christian, That they shall shortly there live with himself, in unconceiveable Glory; and yet where is the person that is affected with this Promise? whose heart leaps for joy, at the hearing of the news? or that is willing, in hopes of Heaven, to leave this World? But even the godly have as strange un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>savory thoughts of it, as if God did but delude us, and there were no such Glory? and are almost as loath to die, as men without hope. The consideration of this strange disagree<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, between our Professions and Affections, caused me to suspect, that there was some secret lurking unbelief in all our hearts; and therefore I wrote those Arguments in the second Part, for the Divine Authority of the Scripture. And because I finde another cause to be the carelesness, forgetful<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness, and idleness of the Soul, and not keeping in action that Faith which we have: I have here attempted the removal of that cause, by prescribing a course for the daily acting of those Graces, which must fetch in the Celestial Delights into the heart. O the Princely, joyful, blessed Life, that the god<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly lose through meer idleness? As the Papists have wronged the merits of Christ, by their ascribing too much to our own Works; so it is almost incredible, how much they on the other extream, have wronged the safety and consolation of mens Souls, by telling them, that their own endevors are onely for Obedience and Gratitude, but are not so much as Conditions of their Salvation, or Means of their increased Sanctification or Consolation. And while some tell them, That they must look at nothing in themselves, for Acceptation with God, or Comfort, (and so make that Acceptance and Comfort to be equally belonging to a Christian, and a Turk:) And others tell them, That they must look at nothing in themselves, but onely as signes of their good Estate: This

hath caused some to expect onely Enthusiastick Cons<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

How should the Heir of a Kingdom, have the comfort of his Title, but by fore-thinking on it? Its true, God must give us our Comforts by his Spirit: But how? by quickening up our souls to beleeve and consider of the promised Glory; and not, by comforting us we know not how, nor why; or by giving men the foretasts of Heaven, when they never think of it.</p>

Where shall we finde the Christian that de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>serves not this Reproof? Surely we may all cry guilty to this accusation. We know not how to enjoy convenient Houses, Goods, Lands and Revenues; but we seek Rest in these enjoyments. We seldom, I fear, have such sweet and heart contenting thoughts of God, and Glory, as we have of our earthly delights. How much Rest do the volup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tuous seek, in Buildings Walks, Apparel, Ease, Recreations, Sleep, pleasing Meats and Drinks, merry Company, Health and Strength, and long Life? Nay, we can scarce enjoy the necessary Means that God hath appointed for our Spiritual good, but we are seeking Rest in them. Do we want Minister, Godly Society, or the like helps? O, think we, if it were but thus and thus with us, we were

well. <note n="*" place="margin">These must be delighted in; but as means onely to help us to God, not as a happiness to content us without God.</note> Do we enjoy them? O, how we settle upon them, and bless our selves in them, as the rich fool in his wealth? Our Books, our Preachers, Sermons, Friends, Abilities for Duty? do not our hearts hug them, and quiet themselves in them, even more then in God? Indeed, in words we disclaim it, and God hath usually the preheminence in our tongues, and professions; but its too appa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rent, that its otherwise in our hearts, by these Discoveries. First, Do we not desire these more violently, when we want them, then we do the Lord himself? Do we not cry out more sensibly, O, my Friend, my Goods, my Health! then, O my God! Do we not miss Ministry, and Means more passionately, then we miss our God? Do we not bestir our selves more to obtain and enjoy these, then we do to recover our communion with God? Secondly, Do we not delight more in the Possession of these, then we do in the fruition of God himself? Nay, be not those mercies and duties, most pleasant to us, wherein we stand at greatest distance from God? We can read, and study, and confer, preach and hear, day after day, without much weariness, because in these we have to do with Instruments and Creatures; but in secret Prayer, and con<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>versing with God immediately, where no Creature interposeth; how dull? how heartless and weary are we? Thirdly, And if we lose Creatures or Means, doth it not trouble us more then our loss of God? If we lose but a friend, or health, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> all the Town will hear of it; but we can miss our God, and scarce bemoan our misery. Thus its apparent, we exceedingly make the Creature our Rest. Is it not enough, that they are sweet delights, and refresh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing helps in our way to Heaven; but they must also be made our Heaven it self? <hi>Christian Reader,</hi> I would as willingly make thee sensible of this sin, as of any sin in the world, if I could tell how to do it: For the Lords greatest quarrel with us, is in this point. Therefore I most earnestly beseech thee, to press upon thine own Conscience, these following Considerations.</p>

                           </gap>ettle the Soul upon it, and say, Now I am well, upon the bare enjoyment of the Creature; what is this, but to make it our god? Certainly, to be the Souls Rest, is Gods own Prerogative.
<pb n="561" facs="tcp:61132:321" rendition="simple:additions"/>
And as it is palpable Idolatry to place our Rest in Riches and Honors; so it is but a more spiritual and refined Idolatry, to take up our Rest in excellent Means, in the Churches prosperity, and in its Reformation. When we would have all that out of God, which is to be had onely in God; what is this but to turn away from him to the Creature, and in our hearts to deny him? when we fetch more of our comfort, and delight from the thoughts of prosperity, and those mercies which here we have at a distance from God, then from the fore-thoughts of our everlasting Blessed<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness in him. Nay, when the thoughts of that day, when we must come to God, is our greatest trouble, and we would do any thing in the world to escape it; but our enjoyment of Creatures, though absent from him, is the very thing our souls desire. When we had rather talk of him, then come to enjoy him; and had rather go many miles to hear a powerful Sermon of Christ and Heaven, then to enter and possess it. O, what vile Idolatry is this? when we dispute against Epicures, Academicks, and all Pagans, how earnestly do we contend; That God is the chief Good, and the fruition of him our chief Happiness? what clear Arguments do we bring to evince it? but do we beleeve our selves? or are we Christians in judgment, and Pagans in affection? or do we give our senses leave to be the chusers of our Happiness, while Reason and Faith stand by? O Christians, how ill must our dear Lord needs take it, when we give him cause to complain, as sometime he did of our fellow Idolaters. <hi>Jer.</hi> 50.6. That we have been lost sheep, and have forgotten our Resting place. When we give him cause to say, Why my people can finde rest in any thing, rather then in me! They can finde delight in one another, but none in me; they can rejoyce in my Creatures and Ordinances, but not in me: yea, in their very labors and duty, they seek for rest, and not in me; they had rather be any where, then be with me: Are these their gods? have these delivered, and redeemed them? will these be better to them, then I have been, or then I would be? If your selves have but a wife, a husband, a son, that had rather be any where, then in your company, and is never so merry, as when furthest from you, would you not take it ill your selves? Why so must our God needs do. For what do we but lay these things in one end of the bal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance, and God in the other, and foolishly in our choice, prefer them before him?<note place="margin">1 Sam. 1.8.</note> As <hi>Elkanah</hi> said to <hi>Hannah, Am not I better to

Thou dost not onely contradict God herein, but losest that benefit which thou mightest receive by them, yea, and makest them thy great hurt and hinder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance.

They are not that Rest (as <hi>John</hi> pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fesseth he was not the Christ) but they are voices crying in this Wilderness, to bid us prepare; for the Kingdom of God, our true Rest, is at hand.

                        <p n="3">3. COnsider whether it be not the most probable way to cause God; either, first, to deny these Mercies which we desire; or secondly, to take from us those which we do enjoy; or thirdly, to imbitter them at least, or curse them to us. Certainly, God is no where so jealous as here: If you had a servant, whom your own wife loved better then she did your self, would you not both take it ill of such a wife, and rid your house of such a servant? You will not suffer your childe to use a knife, till he have wit to do it without hurting him. Why so, if the Lord see you begin to settle in the world, and say, Here I will rest; no wonder if he soon in his jealously unsettle you. If he love you, no wonder if he take that from you, wherewith he sees you about to destroy your selves. It hath been my long observation of many,
<pb n="563" facs="tcp:61132:322" rendition="simple:additions"/>
That when they have attempted great works, and have just finished them, or have aimed at great things in the world, and have just obtained them, or have lived in much trouble and unsettlement, and have just overcome them, and begin with some content to look upon their condition, and rest in it; they are usually neer to death or ruine. You know the story of the fool in the Gospel: When a man is once at this language, Soul take thy ease, or rest; the next news usually is, Thou fool, this night, or this moneth, or this yeer, shall they require thy soul, and then whose shall these things be? O, what house is there, where this fool dwelleth not? Dear Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stian friends, you to whom I have especially relation, Let you and I consider, whether this be not our own case. Have not I after such an unsettled life, and after almost five yeers living in the weary con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dition of war, and the unpleasing life of a Souldier, and after so many yeers groaning under the Churches unreformedness, and the great fears that lay upon us, and after so many longings, and pray<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers for these days: Have I not thought of them with too much con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tent? and been ready to say, Soul take thy rest? Have not I com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>forted my self more, in the fore-thoughts of enjoying these, then of coming to Heaven, and enjoying God? What wonder then, if God cut me off, when I am just sitting down in this supposed Rest? and hath not the like been your condition? Many of you have been Souldiers, driven from house and home, endured a life of trouble and blood, been deprived of Ministry and Means, longing to see the Churches setling: Did you not reckon up all the Comforts you should have at your return? and glad your hearts with such thoughts, more then with the thoughts of your coming to Heaven? Why what wonder if God now somewhat cross you, and turn some of your joy into sadness? Many a servant of God hath been destroyed from the Earth, by being overvalued and overloved. I pray God you may take warning for the time to come, that you rob not your selves of all your mercies. I am perswaded, our discontents, and murmurings with an unpleasing condition, and our covetous desires after more, are not so pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>voking to God, nor so destructive to the sinner, as our too sweet enjoying, and Rest of Spirit in a pleasing State. If God have crossed any of you, in Wife, Children, Goods, Friends, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> either by taking them from you, or the comfort of them, or the benefit and blessing, Try whether this above all other, be not the cause; for
<pb n="564" facs="tcp:61132:323"/>
wheresoever your desires stop, and you say, Now I am well; that condition you make your god, and engage the jealousie of God against it. Whether you be friends to God, or enemies, you can never expect that God should wink at such Idolatrie, or suffer you quietlie to enjoy your Idols.</p>

                        <p n="5">5. COnsider, thou seekest Rest where it is not to be found; and so wilt lose all thy labor; and (if thou proceed) thy souls eternal Rest too. I think I shall easily evince this, by these clear demonstrations following.</p>
                        <p>First, Our Rest is onely in the full obtaining of our ultimate end: But that is not to be expected in this life; therefore, neither is rest to be here expected. Is God to be enjoyed in the best Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formed Church, in the purest and powerfullest Ordinances here, as he is in Heaven? I know you will all confess, he is not: How little of God (not onely the multitude of the blinde world, but
<pb n="565" facs="tcp:61132:323" rendition="simple:additions"/>
sometimes) the Saints themselves do enjoy, even under the most excellent Means; let their own frequent complainings testifie. And how poor comforters are the best Ordinances and Enjoyments, without God, the truly Spiritual Christian knows. Will a stone rest in the Air in the midst of its fall, before it comes to the Earth? No, because its center is its end. Should a Traveller take up his rest in the way? No, because his home is his journeys end. VVhen you have all that Creatures and Means can afford, have you that you sought for? Have you that you beleeved, pray, suffer for? I think you dare not say so. VVhy then do we once dream of rest<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing here? VVe are like little Children strayed from home; and God is now fetching us home; and we are ready to turn into any house, stay, and play with every thing in our way, and sit down on every green bank; and much ado there is to get us home.</p>
                        <p>Secondly, As we have not yet obtained our end, so are we in the midst of labors and dangers; and is there any resting here? VVhat painful work doth lie upon our hands? Look to our Bre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thren, to godly, to ungodly, to the Church, to our souls, to God; and what a deal of work in respect of each of these, doth lie be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore us? and can we rest in the midst of all our labors? Indeed, we may take some refreshing, and ease our selves sometimes in our troubles; if you will call that Rest: But thats not the setling Rest we now are speaking of; we may rest on Earth, as the Ark is said to have rested in the midst of <hi>Jordan, Josh.</hi> 3.13. A short and small Rest, no question; or as the Angels of Heaven are desired to turn in, and rest them on Earth, <hi>Gen.</hi> 18.4. They would have been loath to have taken up their <note n="*" place="margin">
                              <hi>Quum tran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sierit tempus pugnae, &amp; ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nerit pax illa quae praecellit omnem intel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lectum, (quan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tumcunque enim cogitave<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit de pace illa, minus eam ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pit animus in ista corporis gravedine con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stitutus) cum venerit inquam illa pax &amp; patria, jam domus erit Deo, qui in pugna tabernaculum.

Qui in illam intrant ut inhabitent, ipsi sunt qui intrant ut inhabitentur. In domum tuam intra ut inhabites: In domum Dei ut inhabiter is. Est enim melior Domus: qui cum te caeperit in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>habitare, beatum te facit. Nam si tu ab illo non habitaris, miseres.</hi> August. in Psal 26. &amp; 31.</note> dwelling there. Should <hi>Israel</hi> have setled his Rest in the VVilderness, among Serpents, and enemies, and weariness, and famine? Should <hi>Noah</hi> have made the Ark his home, and have been loth to come forth when the waters were faln? Should the Marriner chuse his dwelling on the Sea? and settle his rest in the midst of Rocks and Sands, and raging Tempests?
<pb n="566" facs="tcp:61132:324"/>
though he may adventure through all these, for a Commodity of worth; yet I think he takes it not for his rest. Should a Souldier rest in the midst of fight? when he is in the very thickest of his enemies? and the instruments of death compass him about? I think he cares not how soon the battle is over: And though he may adventure upon war for the obtaining of peace, yet I hope he is not so mad, as to take that instead of Peace. And are not Christi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans such Travellers, such Marriners, such Souldiers? Have we not fears within, and troubles without? are we not in the thickest of continual dangers? we cannot eat, drink, sleep, labor, pray, hear, confer, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> but in the midst of snares and perils? and shall we sit down and rest here? O Christian, follow thy work, look to thy dangers, hold on to the end, win the field, and come off the ground, before thou think of a setling rest. I read indeed that <hi>Peter</hi> on the mount, when he had seen a glimpse of Glory, said, <hi>Its good for us to be here.</hi> But sure when he was on the Sea, in the midst of waves, he doth not then say, Its good to be here<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> No, then he hath other language, <hi>Save Master, we perish.</hi> And even his desires to rest on the Mount, are noted in Scripture to come from hence, He knew not what he said: It was on Earth, though with Christ in his transfiguration. And I dare say the like of thee, when ever thou talkest of resting on Earth, Thou knowst not what thou sayest. I read that Christ when he was on the Cross, comforted the converted thief with this, <hi>This day shalt thou be with me in Paradise:</hi> But if he had onely comforted him with telling him, That he should rest there on that Cross, would he not have taken it for a derision? Me thinks it should be ill resting in the midst of sicknesses and pains, persecution and distresses: One would think it should be no con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tentful dwelling for Lambs among Wolves. The wicked have some slender pretence for their sin in this kinde; they are among their friends, in the midst of their portion, enjoying all the Happiness that they are like to enjoy: But is it so with the godly? Surely, the world is at best, but a stepmother to them; nay, an open ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>my. But if nothing else would convince us; yet sure the remain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders of sin which doth so easily beset us, should quickly satisfie a beleever, That here is not his rest. What, a Christian, and Rest in a state of sinning? it cannot be: Or do they hope for a perfect freedom here? that's impossible. I say therefore to every one that thinketh of rest on Earth, as <hi>Micah, chapter</hi> 2. <hi>verse</hi> 10.

                        </p>
                        <p>Thirdly, The nature of all these things may convince you, That they cannot be a Christians true rest. They are too poor to make us such; and too low to raise us to happiness; and too empty to fill our souls; and too base to make us blessed; and of too short continuance, to be our eternal contents. They cannot subsist them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves, without support from Heaven; how then can they give sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sistence to our souls? Sure if prosperity, or whatsoever we can here desire, be too base to make us gods of, then are they too base to be our rest.</p>
                        <p>Fourthly, That which is the Souls true rest, must be sufficient to afford it perpetual satisfaction: But all things below do delight us onely with fresh variety. The content which any Creature afford<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth, doth wax old and abate after a short enjoyment: We pine away for them, as <hi>Amnon</hi> for his sister; and when we have satis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fied our desire, we are weary of them, and loath them. If God should rain down Angels food, after a while our souls would loath that dry Manna. The most dainty fare, the most costly clothing would not please us, were we tied to them alone. The most sump<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tuous house, the softest bed, were we confined to them, would be but a prison. One recreation pleaseth not long; we must have supply of new, or our delights will languish, nay, our delight in our society and friendship, especially if carnal, is strongest while fresh. And in the Ordinances of God themselves, (so far as we delight in them for themselves and not for God) if novelty sup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>port not, our delight grows dull. If we hear still the same Minister; or if in Preaching and Praying, he use oft the same expressions; or if he Preach oft the same Sermon? how dull grows our devoti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, though the matter be never so good, and at first did never so highly please us? If we read the most excellent and pleasing Books, the third or fourth reading is usually more heartless, then the first or second<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> Nay, in our general way of Christianity, our first god<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly acquaintance, our first Preachers, our first Books, our first Duties, have too commonly our strongest affections. All Creatures are to us, as the flowers to the Bee. There is but little of that matter which affords them honey on any flower; and therefore they must have supply of fresh variety, and take of each a superficial taste, and so to the next yea, some having gone through variety of States, and <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

If we had conquered to our selves the whole world, we should perhaps do as <hi>Alexander</hi> is Fabled to have done, Sit down and weep because there is never another world to Conquer. If I should send you forth as <hi>Noahs</hi> Dove, to go through the earth, to look for a Resting place, you would return with a confession, that you can finde none: Go ask Honor, Is there Rest here? Why, you may as well rest on the top of the tempestuous Mountains, or in <hi>Etnaes</hi> flames, or on the Pinnacle of the Temple. If you ask Riches, Is there Rest here? Even such as is in a bed of Thorns; or were it a bed of Down, yet must you arise in the mor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning, and leave it to the next Guest that shal succeed you: Or if you enquire of worldly Pleasure and ease, can they give you any tidings of true Rest? Even such as the fish or bird hath in the Net, or in swal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowing down the deceitful bait; when the pleasure is at the sweetest, death is the nearest: It is just such a content and happiness, as the exhilarating vapors of the winde do give to a man that is drunk; it causeth a merry and cheerful heart, it makes him forget his wants and miseries, and conceive himself the happiest man in the world, till his sick vomitings have freed him of his disease, or sleep have asswaged and subdued those vapors which deluded his fantasie, and perverted his Understanding, and then he awakes a more unhappy man then ever he was before. Such is the Rest and Happiness that all worldly pleasures doth afford. As the Phantasie may be de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lighted in a pleasant dream, when all the senses are captivated by sleep; so may the flesh or sensitive appetite, when the reasonable soul is captivated by security, but when the morning comes, the de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lusion vanisheth; and where is the pleasure and happiness then? Or if you should go to Learning, to purest, plentifullest, powerfullest Ordinances, or compass sea and land to finde out the perfectest Church, and holiest Saints, and enquire whether there your soul may rest: You might haply receive from these indeed an Olive-branch of Hope, as they are means to your Rest, and have relation to eternity; but in regard of any satisfaction in themselves, you would remain as restless as ever before.

Go take a view of all estates of men in the world, and see whether any of them have found this Rest.

If then either Scripture, or Reason, or the Experience of your selves and all the world will satisfie us, we may see there is no resting here. And yet how guilty are the generality of Professors of this sin! How many halts and stops do we make, before we will make the Lord our Rest! How must God even drive us, and fire us out of every con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dition, lest we should sit down and Rest there! If he give us Prosperity, Riches, or Honor, we do in our hearts dance before them, as the <hi>Israelites</hi> before their Calf, and say, <hi>These are thy Gods,</hi> and conclude it is good being here. If he imbitter all these to us by Crosses, how do we strive to have the Cross re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moved, and the bitterness taken away, and are restless till our con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dition be sweetned to us, that we may sit down again, and rest where we were? If the Lord, seeing our perversness, shall now proceed in the cure, and take the creature quite away, then how do we labor, and care, and cry, and pray, that God would restore it, that if it may be, we may make it our Rest again? And while we are deprived of its actual enjoyment, and have not our for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer Idoll to delight in, yet rather then come to God, we delight our selves in our hopes of recovering our former state, and as long as there is the least likelihood of obtaining it, we make those very hopes our Rest: if the poor by laboring all their dayes, have but hopes of a fuller estate when they are old (though a hundred to one they dye before they have obtained i<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

Or if God do take away both present injoyments, and all hopes of ever recover<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing them, how do we search about, from creature to crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, to finde out something to supply the room, and to settle upon in stead thereof? Yea, if we can finde no supply, but are sure we shall live in poverty, in sickness, in disgrace, while we are on earth, yet will we rather settle in this misery, and make a Rest of a wretched Being, then we will leave all and come to God. A man would think, that a multitude of poor people, who

If any place in hell were tolerable, the soul would rather take up its Rest there, then come to God. Yea when he is bringing us over to him, and hath convinced us of the worth of his wayes and ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vice, <note n="*" place="margin">I know the means of grace must be loved and valued, and the usual enjoyment of God is in the use of them, and he that delighteth in any worldly thing more then in them, is not a true Christian: But when we are content with duty in stead of God, and had rather be at a Sermon then in Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven, and a member of a Church here, then of that perfect Church, and rejoyce in or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinances but as they are part of our earthly prospe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity; this is a sad mistake</note> the last deceit of all is here; we will rather settle upon those wayes that lead to him, and those ordinances which speak of him, and those gifts which flow from him, then we will come clean over to himself. Christian, marvel not that I speak so much of Resting in these: Beware least it should prove thy own case; I suppose thou art so far convinced of the vanity of Riches, and Honor, and carnal pleasure, that thou canst more easily dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>claim these (and its well if it be so) but for thy more spiritual mercies in thy way of profession, thou lookest on these with less suspicion, and thinkest they are so neer to God, that thou canst not delight in them too much, especially seeing most of the world despise them<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> or delight in them too little. But do not the en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crease of these mercies dull thy longings after heaven? If all were according to thy desire in the Church, wouldst thou not sit down and say, I am well; Soul, take thy Rest, and think it a judgment to be removed to heaven? Surely if thy delight in these excel not thy delight in God, or if thou wouldst gladly leave the most happy condition on earth, to be with God, then art thou a rare man, a Christian indeed. Many a one of us were more willing to go to heaven in the former dayes of persecution, when we had no hopes of seeing the Church reformed, and the Kingdom delivered: But now we are in hopes to have all things almost as we desire, the case is altered, and we begin to look at heaven as strangely and sadly, as if it would be to our loss to be removed to it. Is this the right use of Reformation? Or is this the way to have it continued or per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fected? should our deliverances draw our hearts from God? O, how much better were it, in every trouble<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> to fetch our chief argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments of comfort, from the place where our chiefest Rest remains; and when others comfort the poor with hopes of wealth, or the
<pb n="573" facs="tcp:61132:327" rendition="simple:additions"/>
sick with hopes of health and life, let us comfort our selves with the hopes of heaven. So far rejoyce in the creature, as it comes from God, or leads to him, or brings thee some report of his love; So far let thy soul take comfort in ordinances, as God doth accompany them with quickning or comfort, or gives in himself unto thy soul by them. Still remembring, when thou hast even what thou dost desire, yet this is not Heaven; yet these are but the first fruits. Is it not enough that God alloweth us all the comforts of travellers, and accordingly to rejoyce in all his mercies, but we must set up our staff, as if we were at home? While we are present in the body,<note place="margin">2 Cor. 5.6, 7, 8, 9.</note> we are absent from the Lord; and while we absent from him, we are absent from our Rest. If God were as willing to be absent from us, as we from him, and if he were as loth to be our Rest, as we are loth to Rest in him, we should be left to an Eternal Restless seperation. In a word, as you are sensible of the sinfulness of your earthly discontents, so be you also of your irregular contents, and pray God to pardon them much more.

And because we are apt to make light of this sin, and to plead our common nature for to patronize it; let me here set before you its aggravations, and also propound some further considerations which may be use<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful to you and my self against it.</p>

                        <p>ANd first consider, What a deal of gross infidelity doth lurk in the bowels of this sin? Either paganish unbelief of the truth of that eternal blessedness, and of the truth of the Scripture which doth promise it to us; or at least a doubting of our own interest, or most usually somewhat of both these. And though Christians are usually most sensible of the latter, and therefore complain most against it; yet I am apt to suspect the former to be the main radicall master sin, and of greatest force in this business. O, if we did but verily believe, that the promise of this glory is the word of God, and that God doth truly mean as he speaks, and is fully resolved to make it good; if we did verily believe, that there is indeed such blessedness prepared for believers<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> as the Scripture mentioneth; sure we should be as impatient of living, as we are now fearful of dying and should think every day a yeer till our last day should come: We should as hardly refrain from laying vio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lent hands on our selvs, or from the neglecting of the means of our health and life, as we do now from overmuch carefulness and seek<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of life by unlawful means. If the eloquent oration of a Philoso<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pher
<pb n="576" facs="tcp:61132:329"/>
concerning the souls immortality and the life to come could make his affected hearer, presently to cast himself head long from the rock, as impatient of any longer delay; what would a serious Christians belief do, if Gods Law against self murder did not re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>strain? Is it possible that we can truly believe, that death will re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>move us from misery to such glory, and yet be loth to dye? If it were the doubts of our own interest, which did fear us; yet a true belief of the certainty and excellency of this Rest, would make us restless till our interest be cleared. If a man that is desperately sick to day, did believe he should arise sound the next morning; or a man to day in despicable poverty, had assurance that he should to morrow arise a prince; would they be afraid to go to bed? Or rather think it the longest day of their lives, till that desired night and morning come? The truth is, though there is much faith and Christianity in our mouths, yet there is much infidelity and pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ganisme in our hearts, which is the maine cause, that we are so loth to dye.</p>

Love doth desire the neerest conjunction, the fullest fru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ition, and closest communion; Where these desires are absent, there is only a naked pretence of Love: He that ever felt such a thing as Love working in his brest, hath also felt these desires attend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing it. If we love our friend, we love his company: his presence is comfortable; his absence is troublesome: when he goes from us, we desire his return: when he comes to us, we entertain him with welcome, and gladness: when he dyes, we mourn, and usually over-mourn:<note place="margin">

                           </note> to be separated from a faithful friend, is to us as the renting of a member from our bodyes; And would not our de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sires after God be such, if we really loved him? Nay should it not be much more then such, as he is above all friends most lovely? The Lord teach us to look closely to our hearts, and take heed of self-de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceit in this point: For certainly what ever we pretend or conceit, if we love either Father, Mother, Husband, Wife, Childe, Friend, Wealth,<note place="margin">Mat. 10.37.</note> or life more then Christ, we are yet none of his sincere Disciples. When it comes to the tryall, the question will not be,

Who hath preached most, or heard most, or talked most? but who hath loved most? when our account is given in, Christ will not take Sermons, Prayers, Fastings, no, nor the giving of our goods, nor the burning of our bodies in stead of love, 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 13.1, 2,<note place="margin">

And do we love him, and yet care not how long we are from him? If I be deprived of my bosom friend, me thinks I am as a man in a wilderness, solitary, and disconsolate: And is my absence from God, no part of my trou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble? and yet can I take him for my chiefest friend? If I delight but in some Garden, or Walk, or Gallery, I would be much in it: If I love my Books, I am much with them, and almost unweariedly poaring on them. The food which I love<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> I would often feed on; the clothes that I love, I would often wear; the recreations which I love, I would often use them; the business which I love, I would be much employed in: And can I love God, and that above all these; and yet have no desires to be with him? Is it not a far like<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lier sign of hatred then of love; when the thoughts of our appear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing before God, are our most grievous thoughts; and when we take our selves as undone, because we must die and come unto him? Surely, I should scarce take him for an unfeigned friend, who were as well contented to be absent from me, as we ordinarily are to be absent from God. Was it such a joy to <hi>Jacob</hi> to see the face of <hi>Joseph</hi> in <hi>Egypt?</hi> and shall we so dread the sight of Christ in glory? and yet say we love him? I dare not conclude, that we have no love at all, when we are so loth to die. But I dare say, were our love more, we should die more willingly. Yea, I dare say, Did we love God, but as strongly, as a worldling loves his wealth, or an ambitious man his honor, or a voluptuous man his pleasure; yea, as a drunkard loves his swinish delight, or an unclean person his bruitish lust: We should not then be so exceeding loth to leave the world, and go to God.

Nay, we have seen death raging in Towns and Fields, so many hundred a day dead of the Pesti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lence, so many thousands slam of the Sword and did we not know it would reach to us at last? How many distempers have vexed our bodies? frequent Languishings, consuming Weaknesses, wasting Feavers, here pain, and there trouble, that we have been forced to receive the sentence of death; and what were all these but so many Messengers, sent from God to tell us we must shortly dye, as if we had heard a lively voyce, bidding us, <hi>Delay no more, but make you ready:</hi> And are we unready and unwilling after all this?

Shall he come down to our hell? from the height of glory to the depth of misery? to bring us up to his E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ternal Rest? and shall we be after this unwilling? Sure Christ had more cause to be unwilling, he might have said, What is it to me if these sinners suffer? If they value their flesh above their spirits, and their lusts above my Fathers Love, if they needs will sell their souls for nought; who is it fit should be the loser? and who should bear the blame and curse? Should I whom they have wronged? must they wilfully transgress my Law? and I undergo their deserved pain?

Except you would not die at all, but desire an immortality here on Earth; which is a sin inconsistent with the truth of Grace. If your sorrow be meerly this, That you are mortal; you might as well have lamented it all your lives: For sure you could never be ignorant of this. Why should not a man that would dye at all, be as well willing at thirty or fourty, if God see it meet, as at seventy or eighty? nay, usually when the longest day is come, men are as loth to depart as ever. He that looseth so many yeers, hath more cause to bewail his own neglect, then to complain of the shortness of his time; and were better lament the wickedness of his life, then the brevity. Length of time doth not conquer corruption; it never withers, nor decayes through age. Except we receive an addition of Grace, as well as Time, we naturally grow the older the worse.

As of all other outward things, so also of thy time and life; thou mayest as well have too much, as too little: Onely of God, and eternal life, thou canst never enjoy too much, nor too long. Great receivings, will have great accounts: where the lease is longer, the fine and rent must be the greater. Much time hath much duty. Is it not as easie to answer for the receivings and the duties, of thirty yeers, as of an hundred? Beg therefore for Grace to improve it better; but be content with thy share of time.</p>

God might have made thy life a misery; till thou hadst been as weary of possessing it, as thou art now afraid of loosing it. If he had denyed thee the benefits and ends of living, thy life would have been but a slender comfort. They in Hell have life as well as we, and longer far then they desire: God might have suffered thee to have consumed thy days in ignorance, or to have spent thy life to the last hour, before he brought thee home to himself, and given thee the saving Know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledg of Christ; and then thy life had been short, though thy time long. But he hath opened thine eyes in the morning of thy days,

and acquainted thee betimes with the trade of thy life. I know the best are but negligent loyterers, and spend not their time ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to its worth; but yet he that hath an hundred yeers time, and looseth it all, lives not so long as he that hath but twenty, and bestows it well.

The means are to be valued in reference to their end: Thats the best means, which speediliest and surest obtaineth the end.

I know no reason, but they may expect perfection in all things else, as well as this. VVhen you have done all, you will know this but in part. If your belief of that Scripture, which saith, <hi>Beleeve, and be saved,</hi> be imperfect; and if your knowledg, whether your own deceitful hearts do sincerely beleeve or not, be imperfect; or if but one of these tvvo be imperfect: the result or conclusion must needs be so too. If you vvould then stay till you are perfectly certain, you may stay for ever: if you have obtained assurance but in some degree, or got but the grounds for assurance said; it is then the speediest, and surest vvay, to desire rather to be quickly in Rest: For then, and never till then, vvill both the grounds and assurance be fully perfect.</p>

Secondly, Though such desires are sometimes lawful, yet must they be carefully bounded and moderated; to which end are the form<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er considerations. We must not be too absolute and peremptory in our desires; but cheerfully yield to Gods disposal. The rightest temper is that of <hi>Pauls,</hi> to be in a streight between two; desiring to depart,<note place="margin">Phil. 1.23.</note> and be with Christ, and yet to stay while God will have us, to do the Church the utmost service. But alas, we are seldom in this streight: Our desires run out all one way, and that for the flesh, and not the Church: Our streights are onely for fear of dy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing; and not betwixt the earnest desires of dying, and of living.</p>

Why then, what means all his earnest invitations? why doth he so condemn our earthly-mindedness? and command us to set our affections above? Ah vile hearts! If God were against it, we were likelier to be for it. When he would have us to keep our station, then we are aspiring to be like God, and are ready to invade the Divine Prerogatives: But when he commands our hearts to Heaven, then they will not stir an inch; like our Prede<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cessors, the sinful <hi>Israelites:</hi> When God would have them march for <hi>Canaan,</hi> then they mutiny, and will not stir; either they fear the Gyants, or the walled Cities, or want necessaries, or something hinders them<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> but when <hi>God</hi> bids them not to go<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> then will they needs be presently marching, and fight they will, though it be to their overthrow. If the fore-thoughts of glory were forbidden fruit, perhaps we should be sooner drawn unto them; and we should itch (as the <hi>Bethshemites</hi>) to be looking into this Ark.

We have love enough, if the world require it; and thoughts enough to pursue our profits. How delightfully and unweariedly, can we think of vanity? and day after day im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ploy our mindes about the Creature? And have we no thoughts of this our Rest? How freely, and how frequently can we think of our pleasures, our friends, our labors, our flesh, our lusts, our common studies, or news? yea, our very miseries, our wrongs, our sufferings, and our seats? But vvhere is the Christian, vvhose heart is on his Rest? Why Sirs, vvhat is the matter? vvhy are vve not taken up vvith the vievvs of Glory? and our souls more ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>customed to these delightful Meditations?

hearts that have in them no more of Christ and Glory: As we should not own our duties any further then somewhat of Christ is in them, so should we no further own our hearts: And as we should delight in the creatures no further then they have reference to Christ and Eternity; so should we no further approve of our own hearts. If there were little of Christ and Heaven in our mouths, but the world were the onely subject of our speeches, then all would account us to be ungodly; why then may we not call our hearts ungodly, that have so little delight in Christ and Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven? A holy tongue will not excuse or secure a profane heart. Why did Christ pronounce his Disciples eyes and eares so blessed, but as they were the doors to let in Christ by his Works and Words into their hearts? O blessed are the eyes that so see, and the ears that so hear, that the heart is thereby raised to this blessed heavenly frame. Sirs, so much of your hearts as is empty of Christ and heaven, let it befilled with shame and sorrow, and not with ease.</p>

                        <p>You see the work now before you: This, this is it that I would fain perswade your souls to practise: Beloved friends and Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stian neighbors, who hear me this day, let me bespeak your con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sciences in the name of Christ, and command you by the Autho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity I have received from Christ, that you faithfully set upon this weighty duty, and fix your eye more stedfastly on your Rest, and daily delight in the fore-thoughts thereof. I have perswaded you to many other duties, and (I bless God) many of you have obeyed, and I hope never to finde you at that pass, as to say when you per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive the command of the Lord, that you will not be perswaded, nor obey; if I should, it were high time to bewail your misery: Why, you may almost as well say, we will not obey, as sit still and not obey. Christians, I beseech you, as you take me for your Teacher, and have called me thereto, so hearken to this Doctrine; if ever I shall prevail with you in any thing, let me prevail with you in this, to set your heart where you expect a Rest and Trea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sure. Do you not remember, that when you called me to be your Teacher, you promised me under your hands, that you would faithfully and conscionably endeavor the receiving every truth, and obeying every command, which I should from the Word of God manifest to you? I now charge your promise upon you; I never delivered to you a more apparent Truth, nor prest

upon you a more apparent duty, then this? If I knew you would not obey, what should I do here preaching? Not that I desire you to receive it chiefly as from me, but as from Christ, on whose Mes<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sage I come. Me thinks, if a childe should shew you Scripture, and speak to you the Word of God, you should not dare to disobey it. Do not wonder that I perswade you so earnestly; though indeed if we were truly reasonable in spiritual things, as we are in com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon, it would be a real wonder that men should need so much perswasion, to so sweet and plain a duty; but I know the emply<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment is high, the heart is earthly, and will still draw back, the temptations and hinderances will be many and great, and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore I fear, before we have done, and laid open more fully the na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture of the Duty, that you will confess all these perswasions little enough; The Lord grant they prove not so too little, as to fail of success, and leave you as they finde you: Say not, we are unable to set our own hearts on heaven, this must be the work of God onely, and therefore all your Exhortation is in vain; for I tell you, though God be the chief disposer of your hearts, yet next under him you have the greatest command of them your selves, and a great power in the ordering of your own thoughts, and for de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>termining your own wills in their choice; though without Christ you can do nothing, yet under him you may do much, and must do much, or else it will be undone, and you undone through your neglect; Do your own parts, and you have no cause to distrust whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther Christ will do his: Do not your own consciences tell you, when your thoughts fly abroad, that you might do more then you do to restrain them? and when your hearts lye flat, and neglect Eternity, and seldom minde the Joys before you that most of this neglect is wilful? If you be to study a set Speech, you can force your thoughts to the intended Subject; if a Minister be to study a Sermon, he can force his thoughts to the most saving Truths, and that without any speciall grace: might not a true Christian ther minde more the things of the life to come, if he did not neglect to exerci<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

not how to subsist without it; why then, me thinks a spiritual Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stian should study as constantly the Joys of heaven, because it is the very business he lives for, and that the place he must be in for ever: If the Cook can finde in his heart to labor and sweat about your meat, because it is the trade that maintains him, though perhaps he taste it not himself: Me thinks then, you for whom it is pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pared, should willingly bestow that daily pains, to taste its sweet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness, and feed upon it; and if it were about your bodily food, you would think it no great pains neither; a good stomack takes it for no great labor to eat and drink of the best till it be satisfied, nor needs it any great invitation thereto: Christians, if your souls were sound and right, they would perceive incomparably more delight and sweetness, in Knowing, Thinking, Believing, Loving, and Rejoycing in your future Blessedness in the fruition of God, then the soundest stomack findes in its food, or the strongest senses in the enjoyment of their objects; so little painful would this work be to you, and so little should I need to press you to it: its no great pains to you to think of a friend, or any thing else that you dearly love, and as little would it be to think of Glory, if your love and delight were truly there: if you do but see some Jewel, or Trea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sure, you need not long exhortations to stir up your desires, the very sight of it is motive enough; if you see the fire when you are cold, or see a house in a stormy day, or see a safe harbor from the tempestuous seas, you need not be told what use to make of it: the sight doth presently direct your thoughts: you think, you look, you long, till you do obtain it. Why should it not be so in the present case? Sirs, one would think, to shew you this Crown and Glory of the Saints, should be motive enough to make you desire it; to shew you that Harbor where you may be safe from all dangers, should soon teach you what use to make of it, and should bend your daily studies towards it; but because I know while we have fl<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

Why here is such a one, <hi>Mat.</hi> 6.21. <hi>Where your treasure is, there will your hearts be also.</hi> Know once assuredly where your heart is, and you may easily know that your treasure is there: God is the Saints Treasure and happiness: Heaven is the place where they must ful<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly enjoy him: A heart therefore set upon heaven, is no more, but a heart set upon God, desiring after this full enjoyment: And surely a heart set upon God through Christ, is the truest evidence of saving grace. External actions are easiest discovered; but those of the heart are the surest evidences. When thy learning will be no good proof of thy grace; when thy knowledg, thy duties and thy gifts will fail thee, when Arguments from thy tongue and thy hand may be confuted; yet then will this Argument from the bent of thy heart prove thee sincere. Take a poor Christian that can scarce speak true English about Religion, that hath a weak understanding, a failing memory, a stammering tongue; yet his heart is set on God, he hath chosen him for his Portion, his thoughts are on E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ternity, his desires there, his dwelling there; he cryes out, O that I were there; he takes that day for a time of imprisonment, wherein he hath not taken one refreshing view of Eternity: I had rather dye in this mans condition, and have my soul in his souls case; then in the case of him that hath the most eminent gifts, and is most admired for parts and dutie, whose heart is not thus taken

up with God. The man that Christ will finde out at the last day, and condemn, for want of a wedding Garment, will be he that wants this frame of heart: The question will not then be, How much you have known, or professed, or talked? but, How much have you loved, and where was your heart? Why then, Christians, as you would have a sure testimony of the love of God, and a sure proof of your title to Glory, labor to get your hearts above. God will acknowledg that you really love him, and take you for faith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful friends indeed, when he sees your hearts are set upon him. Get but your hearts once truly in Heaven, and without all question your selves will follow. If sin and Satan keep not thence your affections, they will never be able to keep away your persons.</p>

Can a man be at the fire, and not be warm? or in the Sun-shine, and not have light? Can your heart be in Heaven, and not have comfort? The coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>treys of <hi>Norway, Island,</hi> and all the Northward, are cold and fro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zen, because they are farther from the power of the Sun: But in <hi>Egypt, Arabia,</hi> and the Southern parts, it is far otherwise, where they live more neer its powerful rayes. What could make such frozen uncomfortable Christians, but living so far as they do from heaven? And what makes some few others so warm in comforts,
<pb n="607" facs="tcp:61132:346" rendition="simple:additions"/>
but their living higher then others do? and their frequent access so neer to God? When the Sun in the Spring draws neer our part of the earth, how do all things congratulate its approach? The earth looks green &amp; casteth off her mourning habit: the trees shoot forth; the plants revive, the pretty birds, how sweetly sing they? the face of all things smile upon us, and all the creatures below reioyce. Beloved friends, if we would but try this life with God, and would but keep these hearts above, what a Spring of joy would be within us? and all our graces be fresh and green? How would the face of our souls be changed? and all that is within us rejoyce? How should we forget our winter sorrows? and with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>draw our souls from our sad retirements? How early should we rise (as those birds in the spring) to sing the praise of our Great Cre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ator. O Christian, get above: Believe it, that Region is warmer then this below. Those that have been there, have found it so, and those that have come thence have told us so: And I doubt not but that thou hast sometime tryed it thy self. I dare appeal to thy own experience, or to the experience of any soul that knows what the true Joys of a Christian are: When is it that you have largest comforts? Is it not after such an exercise as this, when thou hast got up thy heart, and converst with God, and talkt with the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>habitants of the higher world, and veiwed the mansions of the Saints and Angels, and filled thy soul with the forethoughts of Glory? If thou know by experience what this practice is, I dare say thou knowest what spiritual Joy is. <hi>David</hi> professeth that the light of Gods countenance would make his heart more glad then theirs that have Corn, and VVine, and Oyl, <hi>Psal.</hi> 4.6, 7. &amp; <hi>Act.</hi> 2.28. out of <hi>Psal.</hi> 16. Thou shalt fill me full of Joy with thy countenance. If it be the countenance of God that fills us with Joy; then sure they that draw neerest, and most behold it, must needs be fullest of these Joyes. Sirs, if you never tryed this Art, nor lived this life of heavenly contemplation, I never wonder that you walk uncomfortably, that you are all complaining, and live in sorrows, &amp; know not what the Joy of the Saints means: Can you have comfort from God, and never think of him? Can Heaven rejoyce you, when you do not re<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

<pb n="608" facs="tcp:61132:347"/>
to the highest dignities and dominions, and never think on it, sure it would never rejoyce you. Whom should we blame then, that we are so void of consolation, but our own negligent unskilful hearts? God hath provided us a Crown of Glory, and promised to set it shortly on our heads and we will so much as think on it: He holdeth it out in the Gospel to us, and biddeth us, Behold and Rejoyce; &amp; we will not so much as look at it: And yet we complain for want of Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fort. What a perverse course is this, both against God and our own Joyes? I confesse, though in fleshly things, the presenting of a com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>forting object, is sufficient to produce an answerable delight, yet in spirituals we are more disabled: God must give the Joy it self, as well as afford us matter for Joy: But yet withal, it must be remem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bred, that God doth work upon us as men, and in a rational way doth raise our comforts: He enableth and exciteth us to minde and study these delightful objects, and from thence to gather our own comforts, as the Bee doth gather her honey from the flowers: There<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore he that is most skilful and painful in this gathering Act, is usual<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly the fullest of this spiritual sweetness. Where is the man that can tell me from experience, that he hath had solid and usual Joy, in any other way but this? and that God worketh it immediatly on his affections, without the means of his understanding and considering? It is by beleeving that we are filled with Joy &amp; Peace, <hi>Rom.</hi> 15.13. and no longer then we continue our believing.<note place="margin">1 Pet. 1.8.</note> It is in hope that the Saints Rejoyce, yea, in this hope of the glory of God, <hi>Rom.</hi> 5.2. and no longer then they continue hoping. And here let me warn you of a dangerous snare, an opinion which will rob you of all your com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fort: some think, if they should thus fetch in their own comfort by believing and hoping, and work it out of Scripture promises, and extract it by their own thinking and studying, that then it would be a comfort only of their own hammering out (as they say) and not the genuine Joy of the Holy Ghost. A desperate mistake, raised up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on a ground that would overthrow almost all duty, as well as this: which is, their setting the workings of Gods Spirit, and their own spirits in opposition, when their spirits must stand in subordination to Gods: They are conjunct causes, cooperating to the producing of one and the same effect. Gods Spirit worketh our comforts, by setting our own spirits awork upon the promises, and raising our thoughts to the place of our comforts. As you would delight a co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vetuous man by shewing him gold, or a voluptuous man with flesh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
<pb n="609" facs="tcp:61132:347" rendition="simple:additions"/>
delights; so God useth to delight his people, by taking them, as it were, by the hand, and leading them into Heaven, and shewing them himself, and their Rest with him. God useth not to cast in our Joys while we are idle, or taken up with other things. It is true, he some<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>time doth it suddenly, but yet usually in the foresaid order, leading it into our hearts by our judgment and thoughts: And his sometime sudden extraordinary casting of comforting thoughts into our hearts, should be so far from hindring our endeavors in a meditate<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing way, that it should be a singular motive to quicken us to it; even as a tast given us of some cordial or choiser food, will make us desire and seek the Rest. God feedeth not Saints as birds do their young, bringing it to them, and putting it into their mouths, while they lye still in the nest, and only gape to receive it. But as he giveth to man the fruits of the earth, the increase of their land in Corn and wine, while we plow, and sow, and weed, and water, and dung, and dress, and then with patience expect his blessing: so doth he give the joys of the soul. Yet I deny not, that if any should so think to work out his own comforts by meditation, as to attempt the work in his own strength, and not do all in subordination to God; nor per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive a necessity of the Spirits assistance; the work would prove to be like the workman, and the comfort he would gather would be like both, even meer vanity: Even as the husband mans labor without the sun, and rain, and blessing of God.</p>
                        <p>So then you may easily see, that close meditation on the matter and cause of our Joy, is Gods way to procure solid Joy. For my part, if I should finde my joy of another kinde, I should be very prone to doubt of its sincerity. If I finde a great deal of comfort in my heart, and know not how it came thither, nor upon what rational ground it was raised, nor what considerations do feed and continue it, I should be ready to question, how I know whether this be from God? And though, as the Cup in <hi>Benjamins</hi> sack, it might come from Love, yet it would leave me but in fears and amazement, because of the uncertainty. As I think our love to God, should not be like that of fond lovers, who love violently, but they know not why: so I think a Christians Joy, should be a grounded rational Joy, &amp; not to rejoyce &amp; know not why. Though perhaps in some extraordinary case, God may cast in such an extraordinary kinde of joy, yet I think its not his usual way. And if you observe the spirits of most forlorn, uncom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fortable, despairing Christians, you shall finde the Reason to be,
<pb n="610" facs="tcp:61132:348"/>
their ungrounded expectation of such unusual kinde of joys:<note place="margin">

Jam jam tactu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ros tartara nig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ra putes.</hi> Ovid.</note> and accordingly are their spirits variously tossed, and most unconstantly tempered: Sometime when they meet with such Joys (or at least think so,) then they are cheerful and lifted up, but because these are usually short-lived Joys, therefore they are strait as low as hell; and ordinarily that is their more lasting temper. And thus they are tossed as a vessel at sea, up and down, but still in extream: whereas, alas, God is most constant, Christ the same, Heaven the same, and the Promise the same, and if we took the right course for fetching in our comfort from these, sure our comforts would be more setled and constant, though not always the same. Who<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever thou art therefore that Readest these lines, I intreat thee in the name of the Lord, and as thou valuest the life of constant Joy, and that good conscience, which is a continual feast; that thou wouldest but seriously set upon this work, and learn this Art of <hi>Heavenly-mindedness,</hi> and thou shalt finde the increase a hundred fold, and the benefit abundantly exceed thy labor. But this is the misery of mans Nature; Though every man naturally abhorreth sorrow, and loves the most merry and joyful life, yet few do love the way to Joy, or will endure the pains by which it is obtained; they will take the next that comes to hand, and content themselves with earthly pleasures, rather then they will ascend to heaven to seek it, and yet when all is done, they must have it there, or be without it.</p>

Nay, if he finde the minde but empty, there's room for any thing that he will bring in; but when he finds the heart in heaven, what hope that any of his motions should take?

of any pleasure, the soul will return <hi>Nehemiaes</hi> Answer, <hi>I am doing a great work, and cannot come,</hi> Neh. 6.3. Several ways will this preserve us against Temptations. First, By keeping the heart imploy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed. Secondly, By clearing the Understanding, and so confirming the Will. Thirdly, By prepossessing the Affections with these highest delights. Fourthly, And by keeping us in the way of Gods blessing.</p>
                        <p>First, By keeping the heart employed; when we are idle, we tempt the devil to tempt us; as it is an encouragement to a Thief, to see your doors open, and no body within; and as we use to say, <hi>Careless persons make Theeves:</hi> or as it will encourage an High<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>way Robber, to see you unweaponed; so may it encourage Sathan, to find your hearts idle; but when the heart is taken up with God, it cannot have while to hearken to Temptations, it cannot have while to be lustful and wanton, ambitious or worldly: If a poor man have a suit to any of you, he will not come when you are taken up in some great mans company or discourse, thats but an ill time to speed.</p>
                        <p>If you were but busied in your lawful Callings, you would not be so ready to hearken to Temptations, much less if you were busied above with God: Will you leave your Plow and Harvest in the Field? or leave the quenching of a fire in your houses, to run vvith children a hunting of Butterflies? vvould a Judg be per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>swaded to rise from the Bench, vvhen he is sitting upon life and death, to go and play among the Boys in the streets? No more will a Christian vvhen he is busie vvith God, and taking a survey of his eternal Rest, give ear to the alluring charms of Sathan, <hi>Non vacat exiguis,</hi> &amp;c. is a Character of the truly prudent man; the children of that Kingdom should never have vvhile for trifles; but especial<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly vvhen they are imployed in the affairs of the Kingdom; and this employment is one of the Saints chief preservatives against tempta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions: For as <hi>Gregory</hi> saith,<note place="margin">
                              <hi>In Homil.</hi>

                           <hi>Nunquam Dei amor otiosus est; opera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tur enim magna, si est: Si verò operari renuit, non est amor</hi>; The Love of God is never idle; it vvorketh great things vvhen it truly is; and vvhen it vvill not vvork, it is not love. Therefore being still thus working, it is still preserving.</p>
                        <p>Secondly, A heavenly minde is the freest from sin, because it is of clearest understanding in spiritual matters of greatest concern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment. A man that is much in conversing above, hath truer and livelyer apprehensions of things concerning God and his soul, then any reading or learning can beget: Though perhaps he may be ig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>norant

in divers controversies, and matters that less concern salva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, yet those truths vvhich must stablish his soul, and preserve him from temptation, he knows far better then the greatest Schol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ars; he hath so deep an insight into the evil of sin, the vanity of the creature, the brutishness of fleshly sensual delights, that temptati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons have little power on him, for these earthly vanities are Satans baites, which though they may take much with the undiscerning world, yet with the clear-sighted, they have lost their force. <hi>In vain,</hi> saith <hi>Salomon, the net is spread in the sight of any bird,</hi> Pro. 1.17. And usually in vain doth Satan lay his snares to entrap the soul that plainly sees them; when a man is on high, he may see the further; we use to set our discovering Centinels on the highest place that's neer unto us, that he may discern all the motions of the Enemy; In vain doth the Enemy lay his Ambuscado's when we stand over him on some high Mountain, and clearly discover all he doth: When the <hi>heavenly-minde</hi> is above with God, he may far easier from thence discern every danger that lyes below, and the whole method of the devil in deceiving; Nay, if he did not discover the snare, yet were he likelier far to escape it then any others that con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verse below: A net or baite that's laid on the ground, is unlike<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly to catch the bird that flyes in the Air: while she keeps above, she's out <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 word">

                           </gap> of the danger, and the higher the safer; so is it with us; Sathans temptations are laid on the earth, earth is the place, and earth the ordinary baite: How shall these ensnare the Christi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>an, who hath left the earth, and walks with God? But alas, we keep not long so high, but down we must to the earth again, and then we are taken.</p>
                        <p>If conversing with wise and learned men, is the way to make one wise and learned, then no wonder if he that converseth with God, become wise: If men that travel about the earth, do think to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turn home with more experience and wisdom,<note place="margin">

                           </note> how much more he that travels to heaven? As the very Air and Climate that we most abide in, do work our bodies to their own temper; no won<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der if he that is much in that sublime and purer Region, have a purer soul, and quicker sight; and if he have an understanding full of light, who liveth with the Sun, the Fountain, the Father of light; as certain herbs and meats we feed on, do tend to make our sight more clear, so the soul that's fed with Angels food, must needs have an<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

feed on earth. And therefore you may easily see, that such a man is in far less danger of temptations, and Satan will hardlier beguile his soul; even as a wise man is hardlier deceived then fools and children. Alas, the men of the world, that dwell below, and know no other conversation but earthly, no wonder if their un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derstandings be darkned,<note place="margin">2 Tim. 2.26.</note> and they be easily drawn to every wickedness; no wonder if Satan take them captive at his will, and leade them about, as we see a Dog leade a blinde man with a string; The foggy Air and Mists of earth do thicken their sight; the smoak of worldly cares and business, blindes them, and the dungeon which they live in, is a land of darkness: How can Worms &amp; Moles see, whose dwelling is alwayes in the earth? while this dust is in mens eyes, no wonder if they mistake gain for godliness, sin for grace, the world for God, their own wils for the Law of Christ, and in the issue hell for heaven; if the people of God will but take notice of their own hearts, they shall finde their experiences con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firming this that I have said. Christians, do you not sensibly per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive, that when your hearts are seriously fixt on heaven, you pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sently become wiser then before? Are not your understandings more solid? and your thoughts more sober? have you not truer ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prehensions of things then you had? For my own part, if ever I be wise, it is when I have been much above, and seriously studied the life to come: Me thinks I finde my understanding after such con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>templations, as much to differ from what it was before, as I before differed from a Fool or Idiot; when my understanding is weakned, and befool'd with common imployment, and with conversing long with the vanities below; me thinks, a few sober thoughts of my Fathers house, and the blessed provision of his Family in Heaven, doth make me (with the Prodigal) to come to my self again: Surely, when a Christian withdraws himself from his earthly thoughts, and begins to converse with God in heaven, he is as <hi>Nebuchadnezzar,</hi>
                           <note place="margin">Dan. 4.36.</note> taken from the beasts of the field to the Throne, and his understanding returneth to him again. O when a Christian hath had but a glimpse of Eternity, and then looks down on the world again, how doth he befool himself for his sin! for neg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lects of Christ! for his fleshly pleasures! for his earthly cares! How doth he say to his Laughter, <hi>Thou art mad</hi>! and to his vain Mirth, <hi>What dost thou?</hi> How could he even tear his very flesh, and take revenge on himself for his folly! how verily doth
<pb n="614" facs="tcp:61132:350"/>
he think that there is no man in <hi>Bedlam</hi> so truly mad, as wiful sin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ners, and lazy betrayers of their own souls, and unworthy sleighters of Christ and glory!</p>
                        <p>This is it that makes a dying man to be usually wiser then other men are, because he looks on Eternity, as neer, and knowing he must very shortly be there, he hath more deep and heart-piercing thoughts of it, then ever he could have in health and prosperity; Therefore it is, that the most deluded sinners that were cheated with the world, and bewitched with sin, do then most ordinarily come to themselves, so far as to have a righter judgment then they had; and that many of the most bitter enemies of the Saints, would give a world to be such themselves, and would fain dye in the condition of those whom they hated; even as wicked <hi>Balaam,</hi> when his eyes are opened, to see the perpetual blessed<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness of the Saints, will cry out, <hi>O that I might dye the death of the righteous, and that my last end might be like his:</hi> As Witches when they are taken, and in prison, or at the Gallows, have no power left them to bewitch any more; so we see commonly the most ungodly men, when they see they must dye, and go to ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther world, their judgments are so changed, and their speech so changed, as if they were not the same men, as if they were come to their wits again, and Sin and Satan had power to bewitch them no more: Yet let the same men recover, and lose their apprehension of the life to come, and how quickly do they lose their understandings with it? In a word, those that were befool'd with the world and the flesh, are far wiser when they come to die, and those that were wise before, are now wise indeed. If you would take a mans judgment about Sin, or Grace, or Christ, or Heaven, go to a dying man, and ask him which you were best to chuse? ask him, whether you were best be drunk or no? or be lustful, or proud, or revengeful or no, ask him, whether you were best pray, and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>struct your Families, or no? or to sanctifie the Lords Day, or no? though some to the death may be desperately hardned, yet for the most part, I had rather take a mans judgment then, about these things, then at any other time. For my own part, if my judgment be ever solid, it is when I have the seriousest apprehensions of the life to come; nay, the sober mention of death sometimes, will a little compose the most distracted understanding. Sirs, do you not think (except men are stark devils) but that it would be a harder matter
<pb n="615" facs="tcp:61132:350" rendition="simple:additions"/>
to intice a man to sin, when he lyes a dying, then it was before? If the devil or his Instruments should then tell him of a cup of Sack, of merry company, of a Stage-play, or Morrice-Dance, do you think he would then be so taken with the motion? If he should then tell him of Riches, or Honors, or shew him a pair of Cards, or Dice, or a Whore, would the temptation, think you, be as strong as before? would he not answer, Alas, whats all this to me, who must presently appear before God, and give account of all my life, and straitways be in another world? Why Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stian, if the apprehension of the neerness of Eternity will work such strange effects upon the ungodly, and make them wiser then to be deceived so easily as they were wont to be in time of health; O then what rare effects would it work vvith thee, and make thee scorn the baits of sin, if thou couldst always dwell in the views of God; and in lively thoughts of thine everlasting state? Surely, a believer, if he improve his faith, may ordinarily have truer and more quickning apprehensions of the life to come, in the time of his health, then an unbeliever hath at the hour of his death.</p>
                        <p>Thirdly, Furthermore, A <hi>Heavenly minde</hi> is exceedingly for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tified against temptations, because the affections are so throughly prepossessed with the high delights of another world. Whether Satan do not usually by the sensitive Appetite prevail with the Will, without any further prevailing with the Reason, then meer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly to suspend it, I will not now dispute: But doubtless when the soul is not affected with good, though the Understanding do ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver so clearly apprehend the Truth, it is easie for Satan to entice that soul. Meer speculations, (be they never so true) which sink not into the affections, are poor preservatives against temptations. He that loves most, and not he that onely knows most, will easilyest resist the motions of sin. There is in a Christian a kinde of spiritual taste, whereby he knows these things, besides his meer discuisive reasoning power: The Will doth as sweetly relish goodness, as the Understanding doth Truth; and here lyes much of a Christians strength: If you should dispute with a simple man, and labor to perswade him that Suger is not sweet, o<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

<pb n="616" facs="tcp:61132:351"/>
of heaven, thou wilt not be so easily perswaded from it; you cannot perswade a very childe to part with his Apple, while the taste of its sweetness is yet in his mouth. O that you would be perswaded to try this course, to be much in feeding on the hidden <hi>Manna,</hi> and to be frequently tasting the delights of heaven. Its true, it is a great way off from our Sense, but Faith can reach as far as that. How would this raise the resolutions? and make thee laugh at the fooleries of the world? and scorn to be cheated with such childish toyes? Reader, I pray thee tell me in good sadness, dost thou think, if the devil had set upon <hi>Peter</hi> in the Mount, when he saw Christ in his Transfiguration, and <hi>Moses</hi> and <hi>Elias</hi> talking with him, would he so <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

No, the devil took a greater advantage, when he had him in the High Priests Hall, in the midst of danger and evil company, when he had forgotten the sight on the Mount, and then he prevails: So if he should set upon a believing soul, when he is taken up in the Mount with Christ, what would such a soul say? <hi>Get th<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

Is there any honor or delight like this? or can that be profit which loseth me this? some such answer would the soul return. But alas, Satan staies till we are come down, and the taste of heaven is out of our mouthes, and the glory we saw is even forgotten, and then he ea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sily deceives our hearts: What if the devil had set upon <hi>Paul,</hi> when he was in the third Heaven, and seeing those unutterable things? could he then do you think, have perswaded his heart, to the plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sures, or profits, or honors of the world? If his prick in the flesh, which he after received, were not affliction, but temptation, sure it prevailed not, but sent him to heaven again for preserving grace; Though the <hi>Israelites</hi> below may be enticed to Idolatry, and from eating and drinking to rise up to play, yet <hi>Moses</hi> in the Mount with God will not do so; and if they had been where he was, and had but seen what he there saw, perhaps they would not so easily have sinned: If ye give a man Aloes after Honey, or some loathsome thing when he hath been feeding on junkets, will he not soon perceive, and spit it out? O if we could keep the taste of our soul continually delighted with the sweetness above, with what disdain should we spit out the baits of sin?</p>
                        <p>
                           <pb n="617" facs="tcp:61132:351" rendition="simple:additions"/>Fourthly, Besides, whilst the heart is set on heaven, a man is un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der Gods protection, and therefore if Satan then assault him, God is more engaged for his defence, and will doubtless stand by us, and say, <hi>My grace is sufficient for thee:</hi> when a man is in the way of Gods blessing, he is in the less danger of sins enticing.</p>
                        <p>So that now upon all this, let me intreat thee, Christian Reader, If thou be a man that is haunted with temptation (as doubless thou art, if thou be a man,) if thou perceive thy danger, and wouldst fain escape it; O use much this powerful remedy, keep close with God by a <hi>heavenly minde</hi>; learn this Art of diversion, and when the temptation comes, go straite to heaven, and turn thy thoughts to higher things; thou shalt finde this a surer help then any other resisting whatsoever: As men will do with scolding women, let them alone and follow their business, as if they heard not what they said, and this will sooner put them to silence, then if they answered them word for word; so do by Satans temptations, it may be he can overtalk you, and over-wit you in dispute, but let him alone, and study not his temptations, but follow your business above with Christ, and keep your thoughts to their <hi>Heavenly im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ployment,</hi> and you will this way sooner vanquish the temptation, then if you argued or talk'd it out with the Tempter: not but that sometime its most convenient to over-reason him, but in ordina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry temptations to known sin, you shall finde it far better to follow this your work, and neglect the allurements, and say as <hi>Grynaeus</hi> (out of <hi>Chrysost.</hi>) when he sent back <hi>Pistorius</hi> letters, not so much as opening the Seal, <hi>Inhonestum est, honestam matronam cum meri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trice litigare</hi>; Its an unseemly thing for an honest Matrone, to be scolding with a Whore: so its a dishonest thing for a Son of God, in apparent cases to stand wrangling with the devil, and to be so far at his beck, as to dispute with him at his pleasure, even as oft as he will be pleased to tempt us. Christian, If thou remember that of <hi>Solomon,</hi> Prov. 15.24. thou hast the summ of what I intend, <hi>The way of life is above to the wise, to avoide the path of hell beneath;</hi> and withall remember <hi>Noahs</hi> example, Gen. 6.9. Noah <hi>was a just man, and perfect in his generation,</hi>

                        <p n="5">5. COnsider, The diligent keeping of your hearts on heaven, will preserve the vigor of all your graces, and put life into all your duties. Its the heavenly Christian, that is the lively Christi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>an. Its our strangeness to Heaven that makes us so dull: Its the end that quickeneth to all the means: And the more frequently and clearly this end is beheld, the more vigorous will all our mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion be. How doth it make men unweariedly labor, and fearelesly venture, when they do but think of the gainful prize? How will the Souldier hazard his life? and the Marriner pass through storms and waves? how cheerfully do they compass sea and land, and no difficulty can keep them back, when they think of an uncertain pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rishing treasure. O, what life then would it put into a Christians en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deavors, if he would frequently forethink of his everlasting Trea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sure? We run so slowly, and strive so lazily, because we so little minde the prize. When a Christian hath been tasting the hidden Manna, and drinking of the streams of the Paradise of God; what life doth this <hi>Ambrosia</hi> and <hi>Nectar</hi> put into him? How fervent will his spirit be in prayer, when he considers that he prayes for no less then Heaven? If <hi>Henoch, Elias,</hi> or any of the Saints, who are now in Heaven, and have partaked of the vision of the living God, should be sent down to the earth again to live on the tearmes as we now do, would they not strive hard? and pray earnestly, rather then lose that blessed Rest? No wonder, for they would know what it is they pray for. Its true, we cannot know it here so throughly as they: yet if we would but get as high as we can, and study but that which may now be known, it would strangely alter both our spirits and our duties. Observe but the man who is much in heaven, and you shall see he is not like other Christians: There is somewhat of that which he hath seen above, appeareth in all his duty and conversation: Nay, take but the same man, immediatly when he is returned from these views of Bliss, and you shall easily perceive that he excels himself, as if he were not indeed the same as before: If he be a Preacher, how heavenly are his Sermons? what clear descriptions? what high expressions? what savory passages hath he of that Rest? If he be a private Christian, what heaven<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly conference? what heavenly prayers? what a heavenly carriage
<pb n="619" facs="tcp:61132:352" rendition="simple:additions"/>
hath he? May you not even hear in a preachers Sermons, or in the private duties of another, when they have been most above? When <hi>Moses</hi> had been with God in the mount, he had derived so much glory from God; that made his face to shine, that the people could not behold him. Beloved friends, if you would but set upon this employment, even so would it be with you: men would see the face of your conversation shine, and say, surely he hath been with God. As the body is apt to be changed into the temper of the air it breaths in, and the food it lives on; so will your spirits receive an alteration according to the objects which they are exercised a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout: If your thoughts do feed on Christ and heaven, you will be heavenly; if they feed on Earth, you will be earthly. Its true, a heavenly Nature goes before this heavenly imployment; but yet the work will make it more heavenly: There must be life, before we can feed, but our life is continued and increased by feeding. Therefore, Reader, let me here inform thee, That if thou lie com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plaining of deadness and dulness, that thou canst not love Christ, nor rejoyce in his Love; that thou hast no life in prayer, nor any other duty; and yet never tryedst this quickning course, or at least art careless and unconstant in it: Why, thou art the cause of thy own complaints; thou deadest and dullest thine own heart; thou deniest thy self that life which thou talkst of? Is not thy life hid with Christ in God?<note place="margin">Col. 3.3.</note> Whither must thou go, but to Christ, for it? and whither is that, but to Heaven, where he is? Thou wilt not come to Christ,<note place="margin">John 5.40.</note> that thou maist have life? If thou wouldst have light and heat, why art thou then no more in the Sunshine? If thou wouldst have more of that Grace which flows from Christ, why art thou no more with Christ for it? Thy strength is in Heaven, and thy life in Heaven, and there thou must daily fetch it, if thou wilt have it. For want of this recourse to heaven, thy soul is as a candle that is not lighted, and thy duties as a sacrifice which hath no fire. Fetch one coal daily from this Altar, and see if thy offering will not burn. Light thy candle at this flame, and feed it daily with Oyl from hence, and see if it will not gloriously shine: Keep close to this reviving fire, and see if thy affections will not be warm. Thou bewailest thy want of love to God, (and well thou maist, for its a hainous crime, a killing sin) why, lift up thy eye of Faith to Heaven, behold his beauty, contemplate his excellencies, and see whether his amiableness will not fire thy affections, and his
<pb n="620" facs="tcp:61132:353"/>
perfect goodness ravish thy heart. As the eye doth incense the sensual affections, by its overmuch gazing on alluring objects; so doth the eye of our Faith in meditation, inflame our affections to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards our Lord, by the frequent gazing on that highest beauty. Whoever thou art, that art a stranger to this imployment, be thy parts and profession never so great, let me tell thee, Thou spendest thy life but in trifling or idleness; thou seemest to live, but thou art dead: I may say of thee, as <hi>Seneca</hi> of idle <hi>Varia, Scis latere, vivere nescis</hi>; Thou knowest how to lurk in idleness, but how to live, thou knowest not. And as the same <hi>Seneca</hi> would say, when he passed by that sluggards dwelling, <hi>Ibi fit<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                        <p>Thou maist many other ways exercise thy parts, but this is the way to exercise thy Graces: They all come from God as their Fountain, and lead to God as their ultimate End, and are exer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cised on God as their chiefest Object; so that God is their All in All. From Heaven they come, and heavenly their nature is, and to Heaven they will direct and move thee. And as exercise maintain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth appetite, strength, and liveliness to the body, so doth it also to the soul. <hi>Vse limbs, and have limbs,</hi> is the known Proverb. And use Grace and Spiritual Life in these heavenly exercises, and you shall finde it quickly cause their increase. The exercise of your meer abilities of Speech will not much advantage your graces; but the exercise of these heavenly soul exalting gifts, will uncon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceivably help to the growth of both. For as the Moon is then most full and glorious, when it doth most directly face the Sun; so will your souls be both in gifts and graces, when you do most neer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly view the face of <hi>God.</hi> This will feed your tongue with matter, and make you abound and overflow, both in Preaching, Praying, and Conferring. Besides, the fire which you fetch from Heaven for your Sacrifices, is no false or strange fire: As your liveliness will be much more, so will it be also more sincere. A man may have a great deal of fervor in Affections and Duties, and all prove but common and unsound, when it is raised upon common Grounds,
<pb n="621" facs="tcp:61132:353" rendition="simple:additions"/>
and motives; your zeal will partake of the nature of those things by which it is acted; The zeal therefore which is kindled by your meditations on Heaven, is most like to prove a heavenly zeal, and the liveliness of the Spirit which you fetch from the face of God, must needs be the Divinest and sincerest life: Some mens fervency is drawn onely from their Books, and some from the pricks of some stinging affliction, and some from the mouth of a moving Minister, and some from the encouragement of an attentive Auditory; but he that knows this way to heaven, and it derives it daily from the pure Fountain, shall have his soul revived with the water of Life, and enjoy that quickning which is the Saints peculiar: By this Faith thou maist offer <hi>Abels</hi> Sacrifice, more excellent then that of common men, and by it obtain winess that thou art righteous, God testifying of thy gifts, (that they are sincere,) <hi>Heb.</hi> 11.4. when others are ready, as <hi>Baals</hi> Priests, to beat themselves, and cut their flesh, because their sacrifice will not burn; then if thou canst get but the spirit of <hi>Elias,</hi> and in the chariot of Contemplati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, canst soar aloft, till thou approachest neer to the quickning Spirit, thy soul and sacrifice will gloriously flame, though the flesh and the world should cast upon them the water of all their opposing enmity. Say not now, How shall we get so high? or how can mor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tals ascend to heaven? For Faith hath wings, and Meditation is its chariot, Its office is to make absent things, as present. Do you not see how a little piece of Glass, if it do but rightly face the Sun, will so contract its beames and heat, as to set on fire that which is behinde it, which without it would have received but little warmth? Why, thy Faith is as the Burning-glass to thy Sacrifice, and Medita<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion sets it to face the Sun onely take it not away too soon, but hold it there awhile, and thy soul will feel the happy effect. The slanderous <hi>Jews</hi> did raise a foolish tale of Christ, that he got into the Holy of Holies, and thence stole the true name of God; and lest he should lose it cut a hole in his thigh, and sewed it therein; and by the vertue of this, he raised the dead, gave sight to the blinde, cast out divels, and performed all his Miracles. Surely, if we can get into the Holy of Holies, and bring thence the Name and Image of God, and get it closed up in our hearts: this would enable us to work wonders; every duty we performed would be a wonder, and they that heard, would be ready to say, Never man spake as this man speaketh. The Spirit would possess us, as those flaming tongues, and make us every one

to speak, (not in the variety of the confounded Languagues, but) in the primitive pure Language of <hi>Canaan,</hi> the wonderful Works of God.

                        <p>Christian Reader, Art thou not thinking when thou seest a lively beleever, and hearest his soul-melting Prayers, and soul-ravish<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing discourse, O how happy a man is this! O that my soul were in this blessed plight! Why, I here direct and advise thee from God: Try this forementioned course, and set thy soul conscion<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ably to this work, and thou shalt be in as good a case: Wash thee frequently in this <hi>Jordan,</hi> and thy Leprous dead soul will revive, and thou shalt know that there is a God in <hi>Israel,</hi> and that thou mayst live a vigorous and joyous life, if thou wilfully cast not by this duty, and so neglect thine own mercies. If thou be not a lazy reserved hypocrite, but dost truly value this strong and active frame of Spirit; shew it then by thy present attempting this hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venly exercise. Say not now, but thou hast heard the way to obtain this life into thy soul, and into thy duties: If thou wilt yet neg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lect it, blame thy self. But alas, the multitude of Professors come to a Minister, just as <hi>Naaman</hi> came to <hi>Elias</hi>; they ask us, How shall I know I am a childe of God? How shall I overcome a hard heart? and get such strength and life of Grace? But they expect that some easie means should do it; and think we should cure them with the very Answer to their Question, and teach them a way to be quickly well; but when they hear of a daily trading in Heaven, and the constant Meditation on the joyes above: This is a greater task then they expected, and they turn their backs, as <hi>Naaman</hi> on <hi>Elias,</hi> or the young man on Christ, and few of the most conscionable will set upon the duty: Will not Preaching, and Praying, and Conference serve (say they) without this dwel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing still in Heaven? Just as Countrey people come to Physitians; when they have opened their case, and made their moan, they look he should cure them in a day or two, or with the use of some cheap and easie Simple; but when they hear of a tedious Method of Physick, and of costly Compositions, and bitter Potions; they will
<pb n="623" facs="tcp:61132:354" rendition="simple:additions"/>
hazard their lives with some sotish Empirick, who tells them an easier and cheaper way, yea, or venture on death it self, before they will obey such difficult counsel. Too many that we hope well of, I fear will take this course here: If we could give them life, as God did, with a word, or could heal their souls, as Charmers do their bodies, with easie stroaking, and a few good words, then they would readily hear and obey. I entreat thee Reader, beware of this folly; fall to the work; the comfort of Spiritual Health will countervail all the trouble of the Duty. It is but the flesh that repines and gain-sayes, which thou knowest was never a friend to thy soul: If <hi>God</hi> had set thee on some grievous work, shouldst thou not have done it for the life of thy soul? How much more when he doth but invite thee Heaven-ward to himself?</p>

First, To sustain our spirits, and make our sufferings far more easie. Secondly, To stay us from repining, and make us bear with patience and joy: And thirdly, to strengthen our resolutions, that we forsake not Christ for fear of trouble. Our very Beast will carry us more chearfully in travel, when he is coming homeward, where he expect<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth Rest. A man will more quietly endure the lancing of his sores, the cutting out the Stone, when he thinks on the ease that will afterwards follow.

Surely, our sufferings trouble not the minde, according to the degrees of bodily pain; but as the soul is more or less fortified with this pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>serving Antidote.

For my own part (if thou regard the experience of one that hath often tryed) had it not been
<pb n="624" facs="tcp:61132:355"/>
for that little (alas too little) taste which I had of Rest, my suffer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings would have been grievous, and death more terrible. I may say as <hi>David, Psal.</hi> 27.13. <hi>I had fainted, unless I had beleeved to see the goodness of the Lord in the Land of the living.</hi> And as the same <hi>David, Psal.</hi> 142.4, 5. <hi>I looked on my right hand, and beheld, but there was no man that would know me; refuge failed me; no man cared for my soul. I cryed unto thee, O Lord, I said, Thou art my re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fuge, and my portion in the Land of the living.</hi> I may say of the promise of this Rest, as <hi>David</hi> of Gods Law; <hi>Vnless this had been my delight, I had perished in mine affliction, Psal.</hi> 119.92. <hi>One thing</hi> (saith he) <hi>I have desired of the Lord, that will I seek after, that I may dwell in the house of the Lord all the days of my life; to behold the beauty of the Lord, and to enquire in his Temple. For in time of trouble he shall hide me in his Pavilion; in the secret of his Tabernacle he shall hide me, he shall set me up upon a rock. And then shall mine head be lifted up above mine enemies round about me; therefore shall I offer in that his Tabernacle sacrifices of joy, and sing, yea, sing praises unto the Lord, Psal.</hi> 27.4, 5, 6. Therefore as thou wilt then be ready with <hi>David</hi> to pray, <hi>Be not far from me, for trouble is neer, Psal.</hi> 22.11. So let it be thy own chiefest care, not to be far from God and Heaven, when trouble is neer; and thou wilt then finde him to be unto thee, a very present help in trouble, <hi>Psal.</hi> 46.1. <hi>Then though the figtree should not blossom, neither should fruit be in the Vines, the labor of the Olive should fail, and the fields should yield no meat, the stock should be cut off from the fold, and there were no heard in the stalls: Yet thou mightest rejoyce in the Lord, and joy in the God of thy Salvation, Hab<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
                           </hi> 3.17, 18. All suffer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings are nothing to us, so far as we have the foresight of this salva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion. No bolts, nor bars, nor distance of place, can shut out these sup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>porting joyes; because they cannot confine our faith and thoughts, although they may confine our flesh. Christ and Faith are both Spiritual; and therefore prisons and banishments cannot hinder their entercourse. Even when persecution and fear hath shut the doors, Christ can come in, and stand in the midst, and say to his Disciples, <hi>Peace be unto you.</hi> And <hi>Paul</hi> and <hi>Silas</hi> can be in Heaven, even when they are locked up in the inner prison, and their bodies scourged, and their feet in the stocks. No wonder if there be more mirth in their stocks, then on <hi>Herods</hi> throne; for there was more of Christ and Heaven. The Martyrs finde more Rest in the
<pb n="625" facs="tcp:61132:355" rendition="simple:additions"/>
flames, then their persecutors can in their pomp and tyranny; be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause they foresee the flames they scape, and the Rest which that fiery Chariot is conveying them too. It is not the place that gives the Rest, but the presence and beholding of Christ in it. If the Son of God will walk with us in it,<note place="margin">Dan. 3.</note> we may walk safely in the midst of those flames, which shall devour those that cast us in. Why then Christian, keep thy soul above with Christ; be as little as may be out of his company, and then all conditions will be alike to thee. For that is the best estate to thee, in which thou possessest most of him. The morall arguments of a Heathen Philosopher may make the burden somewhat lighter; but nothing can make us soundly joy in tribulation, except we can fetch our joy from Heaven. How came <hi>Abraham</hi> to leave his Country, and follow God he knew not whither? Why, because he looked for a City that hath foun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dations, <hi>whose builder and maker is God, Heb.</hi> 11.8, 9, 10. What made <hi>Moses</hi> chuse affliction with the people of God, rather then to enjoy the pleasures of sin for a season? and to esteem the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proach of Christ greater riches then the treasures of Aegypt? Why, because he had respect to the recompence of Reward. <hi>Heb.</hi> 11.24, 25, 26. What made him to forsake Aegypt, and not to fear the wrath of the King? Why, he endured, as seeing him who is invisi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble, <hi>ver.</hi> 27. How did they quench the violence of fire? And out of weakness were made strong,<note place="margin">

Yea, it is most evident that our Lord himself did fetch his encouragement to suf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferings from the fore-sight of his glory: For to this end he both dyed, and rose, and revived, that he might be Lord both of the dead and living, <hi>Rom.</hi> 14.9. <hi>Even Jesus the author and finisher of our faith for the joy that was set before him, endured the Cross, despi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sing the shame, and is set down at the right hand of the Throne of God. Heb.</hi> 12.2. Who can wonder that pain and sorrow, poverty and sickness should be exceeding grievous to that man who cannot reach to see the end? Or that Death should be the King of terrors to him, who cannot see the life beyond it? He that looks not on the end of his sufferings, as well as on the suffering it self, he needs must lose the whole consolation: And if he see not the quiet fruit of righteousness, which it afterward yieldeth, it cannot to him be joyous, but grievous, <hi>Heb.</hi> 12.11. This is the noble advantage of
<pb n="626" facs="tcp:61132:356"/>
faith; it can look on the means and end together. This also is the reason why we oft pitty our selves more then God doth pitty us, though we love not our selves so much as he doth: and why we would have the Cup to pass from us, when he will make us drink it up. We pitty our selves with an ignorant pitty, and would be saved from the Cross, which is the way to save us. God sees our glory as soon as our suffering, and sees our suffering as it conduceth to our glory; he sees our Cross and our Crown at once, and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore pittyeth us the less, and will not let us have our wils. Sirs, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve it, this is the great reason of our mistakes, impatience, and censuring of God; of our sadness of spirit at sickness, and at death, because we gaze on the evill it self, but fix not our thoughts on whats beyond it. We look only on the blood, and ruine, and dan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger in our wars: but God sees these, with all the benefits to Souls, Bodies, Church, State, and Posterity, all with one single view. We see the Ark taken by the Philistines, but see not their god falling before it, and themselves returning it home with gifts. They that saw Christ only on the Cross, or in the Grave, do shake their heads, and think him lost: but God saw him dying, buryed, rising, glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rified, and all this with one view. Surely faith will imitate God in this, so far as it hath the glass of a promise to help it. He that sees <hi>Joseph</hi> only in the pit, or in the prison, will more lament his case, then he that sees his dignity beyond it. Could old <hi>Jacob</hi> have seen so far, it might have saved him a great deal of sorrow. He that sees no more then the burying of the Corn under ground, or the thresh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, the winnowing, and grinding of it, will take both it and the labour for lost; but he that foresees its springing and increase, and its making into bread for the life of man, will think otherwise. This is our mistake: we see God burying us under ground, but we foresee not the spring, when we shall all revive: we feel him thresh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, and winnowing, and grinding us, but we see not when we shall be served to our Masters table. If we should but clearly see Heaven, as the end of all Gods dealings with us, surely none of his dealings could be so grievous. Think of this, I intreat thee, Reader, If thou canst but learn this way to Heaven, and get thy soul ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quainted there, thou needest not be unfurnished of the choisest Cordials, to revive thy spirits in every affliction; thou knowest where to have them when ever thou wantest: thou mayst have ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guments at hand to answer all that the devil or flesh can say to thy

discomfort. Oh, if God would once raise us to this life, we should finde, that though heaven and sin are at a great distance; yet hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven and a prison, or remotest banishment, heaven and the belly of a Whale in the Sea, heaven and a Den of Lions, a consuming sick<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness, or invading death, are at no such distance. But as <hi>Abraham</hi> so far off saw Christs day, and rejoyced, so we in our most forlorn estate, might see that day when Christ shall give us Rest, and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in rejoyce. I beseech thee Christian, for the honor of the Gospel, and for the comfort of thy soul, that thou be not to learn this hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venly Art, when in thy greatest extremity thou hast most need to use it. I know thou expectest suffering dayes, at least thou lookest to be sick and dye: thou wilt then have exceeding need of conso<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lation; why, whence dost thou think to draw thy comforts? If thou broach every other vessel, none will come: its only heaven that can afford thee store; the place is far off, the well is deep; and if then thou have not wherewith to draw, nor hast got thy soul acquainted with the place; thou wilt finde thy self at a fearfull loss. Its not an easie, nor a common thing, even with the best sort of men, to die with Joy. As ever thou wouldst shut up thy dayes in peace, and close thy dying eyes with comfort, dye daily; live now above, be much with Christ, and thy own soul, and the Saints about thee shall bless the day that ever thou tookst this Councell. When God shall call thee to a sick bed, and a grave, thou shalt per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive him saying to thee, as <hi>Isa.</hi> 26.20. <hi>Come my people, enter into thy Chambers, and shut thy doors about thee, hide thy self as it were for a little moment, untill the indignation be overpast.</hi> Its he that with <hi>Stephen</hi> doth see heaven opened, and Christ sitting at the right hand of God, who will comfortably bear the storm of stones, <hi>Acts</hi> 7.56. Thou knowest not yet what tryals thou mayst be called to; The Clouds begin to rise again, and the times to threaten us with fearfull darkness; Few Ages so prosperous to the Church, but that still we must be saved, so as by fire, 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 3.15. and go to heaven by the old road. Men that would fall if the storm should shake them, do frequently meet with that which tryes them. Why, what wilt thou do if this should be thy case? Art thou fitted to suffer imprisonment, or banishment? to bear the loss of goods and life? How is it possible thou shouldst do this, and do it cordially, and chearfully, except thou hast a tast of some greater good, which thou lookest to gain by losing these? will the Merchant throw his
<pb n="628" facs="tcp:61132:357"/>
goods overboard till he sees he must otherwise lose his life? And wilt thou cast away all thou hast, before thou hast felt the sweetness of that Rest, which else thou must lose by saving these? Nay, and it is not a speculative knowledg which thou hast got onely by Reading or Hearing of heaven, which will make thee part with all to get it; as a man that onely heares of the sweetness of pleasant food, or reads of the melodi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous sounds of Musick, this doth not much excite his desires; but when he hath tried the one by his taste, and the other by his ear, then he will more lay out to get them; so if thou shouldst know onely by the hearing of the ear, what is the glory of the inheritance of the Saints, this would not bring thee through sufferings and death; but if thou take this Trying tasting course, by daily exerci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sing thy soul above, then nothing will stand in thy way, but thou wouldest on till thou were there, though through fire and water: What State more terrible then that of an Apostate? when God hath told us, <hi>If any man draw back, his soul shall have no pleasure in him,</hi> Heb. 10.38. <hi>Because they take not their pleasure in God, and fill not themselves with the delights of his wayes, and of his heavenly paths, which drop fatness,</hi> Psal. 65.11. <hi>Therefore do they prove back<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sliders in heart, and are filled with the bitterness of their own wayes,</hi> Prov. 14.14.</p>
                        <p>Nay, If they should not be brought to trial, and so not actually deny Christ, yet they are still interpretatively such, because they are such in disposition, and would be such in action, if they were put to it. I assure thee, Reader, for my part, I cannot see how thou wilt be able to hold out to the end, if thou keep not thine eye up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on the recompence of reward, and use not frequently to taste this cordially; or the less thy diligence is in this, the more doubtful must thy perseverance needs be; for the Joy of the Lord is thy strength, and that Joy must he fetcht from the place of thy Joy; and if thou walk without thy strength, how long dost thou think thou art like to endure?</p>

VVhat pleasant discourse was it to <hi>Joseph</hi> to talk with his Brethren in a strange Land; and to enquire of his Father, and his brother <hi>Benjamin?</hi> Is it not so to a Christian to talk with his Brethren that have been above, and en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quire after his Father, and Christ his Lord? when a worldling will talk of nothing but the world, and a Politician of nothing but the affairs of the State, and a meer Scholar of Humane learning, and a common Professor, of Duties, and of Christians: the Heavenly man will be speaking of Heaven, and the strange Glory which his Faith hath seen, and our speedy and blessed meeting there. I confess, to discourse with able men, of clear Understandings and piercing Wits, about the controverted difficulties in Religion, yea, about some Criticisms in Languages and Sciences, is both pleasant and profit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able; but nothing to this Heavenly discourse of a Beleever. O, how refreshing and savory are his expressions? how his words do peirce, and melt the heart? how they transform the hearers into other men? that they think they are in Heaven all the while? How doth his Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrine drop as the Rain, and his Speech distil as the gentle Dew? as the small Rain upon the tender Herb? and as the showers upon the Grass? while his tongue is expressing the Name of the Lord, and ascribing greatness to his God? <hi>Deut.</hi> 32.2, 3. Is not his feeling, sweet discourse of Heaven, even like that box of precious oyntment, which being opened to pour on the head of Christ, doth fill the house with the pleasure of its perfume? All that are neer may be refresh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed by it. His words are like the precious oyntment on <hi>Aarons</hi> head, that ran down upon his beard, and the skirts of his Garments; Even like the dew of <hi>Hermon,</hi> and as the dew that descendeth from the Celestial Mount <hi>Zion,</hi> where the Lord hath commanded the bless<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, even life for evermore, <hi>Psal.</hi> 133.3. This is the man who is as <hi>Job,</hi> When the Candle of God did shine upon his head; and when by his light, he walked through darkness: When the secret of God was upon his Tabernacle; and when the Almighty was yet with him: Then the ear that heard him, did bless him; and the eye that saw him, gave witness to him, <hi>Job</hi> 29.3, 4, 5, 11.

the people that have a Heavenly Minister: Happy the children and servants that have a Heavenly Father or Master: Happy the man that hath Heavenly Associates; if they have but hearts to know their happiness. This is the Companion, who will watch over thy ways; who will strengthen thee when thou art weak; who will chear thee when thou art drooping, and comfort thee with the same comforts, wherewith he hath been so often comforted him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>self, 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 1.4. This is he that will be blowing at the spark of thy Spiritual Life, and always drawing thy soul to God; and will be saying to thee, as the <hi>Samaritan</hi> woman, Come and see one that hath told me all that ever I did; one that hath ravished my heart with his beauty; one that hath loved our souls to the death: Is not this the Christ? Is not the knowledg of God and Him, Eternal life? Is not it the glory of the Saints to see his Glory? If thou come to this mans house, and sit at his Table, he will feast thy soul with the dainties of Heaven; thou shalt meet with a bet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter then <hi>Plato</hi>'s Philosophical feast, even a taste of that feast of fat things, <hi>Of wines on the lees, of fat things full of marrow, of wine on the lees well refined,</hi> Isai. 25.6. <hi>That thy soul may be satisfied as with marrow and fatness, and thou maist praise the Lord with joy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful lips,</hi> Psal 63.5. If thou travel with this man on the way, he will be directing and quickning thee in thy Journey to Heaven; If thou be buying or selling, or trading with him in the world, he will be counselling thee to lay out for the inestimable Treasure. If thou wrong him, he can pardon thee, remembring that Christ hath not onely pardoned greater offences to him, but will also give him this unvaluable portion; If thou be angry, he is meek, considering the meekness of his heavenly Pattern; or if he fall out with thee, he is soon reconciled, when he remembreth that in heaven you must be everlasting friends: This is the Christian of the right stamp; this is the servant that is like his Lord, these be the innocent that save the Iland, and all about them are the better where they dwell. O Sirs, I fear the men I have described are very rare, even among the Religious; but were it not for our own shameful negligence, such men we might all be: What Families! what Towns! what Commonwealths! what Churches should we have, if they were but composed of such men! but that is more desirable then hopeful, till we come to that Land which hath no other inhabitants, save what are incomparably beyond this: Alas, how empty are

the speeches, and how unprofitable the society of all other sorts of Christians in comparison of these! A man might perceive by his Divine Song, and high Expressions, <hi>Deut.</hi> 32. and 33. that <hi>Moses</hi> had been oft with God, and that God had shewed him part of his Glory. Who could have composed such spiri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tual Psalms, and poured out praises as <hi>David</hi> did, but a man after Gods own heart? and a man that was neer the heart of God, and (no doubt) had God also neer his heart? Who could have preached such spiritual Doctrine, and dived into the precious mysteries of Salvation, as <hi>Paul</hi> did, but one who had been called with a light from heaven, and had been rapt up into the third heavens, in the Spirit, and there had seen the unutterable things? If a man should come down from heaven amongst us, who had lived in the possession of that blessed State, how would men be desirous to see or hear him? and all the Countrey far and neer would leave their business and crowd about him: happy would he think himself that could get a sight of him; how would men long to hear what reports he would make of the other world? and what he had seen? and what the blessed there enjoy? would they not think this man the best companion, and his discourse to be of all most profit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able? Why sirs! Every true believing Saint shall be there in person, and is frequently there in Spirit, and hath seen it also in the Glass of the Gospel: Why then do you value their company no more? and why do you enquire no more of them? and why do you relish their discourse no better? Well; for my part I had rather have the fellowship of a Heavenly minded Christian, then of the most learned Disputers, or Princely Commanders.</p>

Sure, it beseems not the Spouse of Christ, to live among his Scul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lions and Slaves, when they may have daily admittance into his presence Chamber; he holds forth the Scepter, if they will but enter. Sure, we live below the rates of the Gospel, and not as becometh the Children of a King, even of the great King of all the World. We live not according to the height of our Hopes, nor according to the plenty that is in the Promises, nor accord<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to the provision of our Fathers house, and the great prepara<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions made for his Saints. It is well we have a Father of tender Bowels, who will own his Children, even in dirt and rags: It is well the foundation of God stands sure, and that the Lord know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth who are his; or else he would hardly take us for his own, so far do we live below the honor of Saints: If he did not first challenge his interest in us, neither our selves, nor others could know us to be his people. But O, when a Christian can live above, and rejoyce his soul in the things that are unseen; how doth God take himself to be honored by such a one? The Lord may say, Why this man beleeves me; I see he can trust me, and take my Word: He rejoyceth in my promise, before he hath possession; he can be glad and thankful for that which his bodily eyes did never see: This mans rejoycing is not in the flesh; I see he loves me, because he mindes me; his heart is with me, he loves my pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sence; and he shall surely enjoy it in my Kingdom for ever. <hi>Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause thou hast seen</hi> (saith Christ to <hi>Thomas</hi>) <hi>thou hast beleeved; but blessed are they that have not seen, and yet have beleeved,</hi> John 20.29.

But it hath pleased our Father to open his Counsel, and to let us know the very intent of his heart, and to acquaint us with the eternal extent of his Love, and all this that our Joy may be full, and we might live as the heirs of such a Kingdom: And shall we now over-look all, as if he had revealed no such matter?

If you were but banished into a strange Land, how frequent thoughts would you have of home? how oft would you think of your old companions? which way ever you went, or what company soever you came in, you would still have your hearts, and desires there; you would even dream in the night, that you were at home, that you saw your Father, or Mother, or Friends, that you were talking with Wife, or Children, or Neigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bors: And why is it not thus with us in respect of Heaven? Is not that more truly, and properly our home, where we must take up our everlasting abode, then this, which we are looking every hour, when we are separated from, and shall see it no more? VVe are strangers, and that is our Countrey, <hi>Heb.</hi> 11 14, 15. VVe are heirs, and that is our Inheritance; even an Inheritance, incorrupti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble and undefiled, that fadeth not away, reserved in Heaven for us, 1 <hi>Pet.</hi> 1.4. VVe are here in continual distress, and want, and there lies our substance; even that better and more enduring sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stance, <hi>Heb.</hi> 10.34. VVe are here fain to be beholden to others, and there lies our own perpetual Treasure, <hi>Matth.</hi> 6.20, 21. Yea, the very Hope of our souls is there; all our hope of relief from our distresses; all our hope of happiness, when we are here miser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able; all this hope is laid up for us in Heaven, whereof we hear in the true VVord of the Gospel, <hi>Col.</hi> 1.5. VVhy, beloved Christians, have we so much interest, and so seldom thoughts? have we so near relation, and so little affection? are we not ashamed of this? Doth it become us to be delighted in the company of strangers, so as to forget our Father, and our Lord? or to be so well pleased with those that hate and grieve us, as to forget our best and dearest friends? or to be so besotted with borrowed trifles, as to forget our own possession and treasure? or to be so taken up with a strange place, as not once a day to look toward home? or to fall so in love with tears and wants, as to forget our eternal Joy, and
<pb n="638" facs="tcp:61132:362"/>
Rest? Christians, I pray you think whether this become us? or whether this be the part of a wife or thankful man? why here thou art like to other men, as the heir under age, who differs not from a servant; but there it is that thou shalt be promoted, and fully estated in all that was promised. Surely, God useth to plead his propriety in us, and from thence to conclude to do us good; even because we are his own people, whom he hath chosen out of all the world: And why then do we not plead our interest in him, and thence fetch Arguments to raise up our hearts, even be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause he is our own God, and because the place is our own posses<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sion? Men use in other things to over-love, and over-value their own, and too much to minde their own things: O, that we could minde our own inheritance! and value it but half as it doth de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>serve!</p>

If God have them not, who, or what shall have them? if thou minde not thy Rest, what wilt thou minde? As the Disciples said of Christ, (<hi>John</hi> 4.32, 33.) <hi>hath any man given him meat to eat, that we know not of?</hi> So say I to thee; Hast thou found out some other God, or Heaven, that we know not of? or something that will serve thee in stead of Rest? Hast thou found on Earth an Eternal happiness? where is it? and what is it made of? or who was the man that found it out? or who was he that last enjoyed it? where dwelt he? and what was his name? or art thou the first that hast found this treasure? and that ever discovered Heaven on Earth? Ah wretch! trust not to thy discoveries, boast not of thy gain, till experience bid thee boast, or rather take up with the experience of thy forefathers, who are now in the dust, and deprived of all, though sometime they were as lusty and jovial as thou. I would not advise thee to make ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>periments at so dear rates, as all those do that seek after happiness below; least when the substance is lost, thou finde too late, that thou didst catch but at a shadow; least thou be like those men, that will needs search out the Philosophers stone, though none could effect it that went before them; and so buy their experience with the loss of their own estates and time, which they might have had

at a cheaper rate, if they would have taken up with the experi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence of their Predecessors.

                           </gap> which thou mightest have learned at easier terms, even by the warnings of God in his VVord, and loss of thousands of souls before thee. It would pity a man to see, that men will not beleeve God in this, till they have lost their labor, and Heaven, and all: Nay, that many Christians, who have taken Heaven for their resting place, do lose so many thoughts needlesly on Earth; and care not how much they oppress their spirits, which should be kept nimble and free for higher things. As <hi>Luther</hi> said to <hi>Melancthon,</hi> when he over-pressed him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>self with the labors of his Ministery; so may I much more say to thee, who oppressest thy self with the cares of the world. <hi>Vellem te adhuc decies plus obrui: Adeo me nihil tui miseret, qui toties monitus, ne onerares teipsum tot oneribus, &amp; nihil audis, omnia benè monita contemnis.</hi>

Alas, that a Christian should rather delight to have his heart among these thorns and bryars, then in the bosom of his crucified, glorified Lord! Surely, if Satan should take thee up to the Mountain of Temptation, and shew thee the Kingdoms, and glory of the world; he could shew thee nothing thats worthy thy thoughts, much less to be preferred before thy Rest. Indeed so far as duty and necessity requires it, we must be content to minde the things below; but who is he that contains himself within the compass of those limits? And yet if we bound our cares and thoughts, as diligently as ever we can, we shall finde the least to be bitter and burdensom; even as the least VVasp hath a sting, and the smallest Serpent hath his poyson. As old <hi>Hiltenius</hi> said of <hi>Rome, Est proprium Romane potestatis ut sit ferreum, &amp; licet digiti minorentur ad parvitatem acus, tamen manent ferrei:</hi> It is proper to the <hi>Romane</hi> power to
<pb n="640" facs="tcp:61132:363"/>
be of iron, and though the fingers of it be diminished to the smalness of a needle, yet they are iron still; The like may I say of our earthly cares, It is their property to be hard and troublous, and so they will be when they are the least: Verily, if we had no higher hopes then whats on earth, I should take man for a most silly crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, and his work and wages, all his travel and his felicity, to be no better then dreams and vanity, and scarce worth the minding or mentioning, especially to thee a Christian should it seem so, whose eyes are opened by the Word and Spirit, to see the emp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiness of all these things, and the pretious worth of the things a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bove: O then be not detained by these silly things, but if Satan present them to thee in a temptation, send them away from whence they came; as <hi>Pellicanus</hi> did send back the silver bowl (which the Bishop had sent him for a token) with this answer, <hi>Astricti sunt quotquot Tyguri cives &amp; inquilini, bis singulis annis, solenni juramento, ne quis eorum ullum munus ab ullo principe acci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>piat</hi>; All that are Citizens and Inhabitants of <hi>Tigurum,</hi> are so<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lemnly sworn twice a yeer, not to receive any gift from any Prince abroad; so say thou, we the Citizens and Inhabitants of heaven, are bound by solemn and frequent Covenants, not to have our hearts enticed or entangled, with any forraign honors or delights, but only with those of our own Countrey: If thy thoughts should like the laborious Bee, go over the world from flower to flower, from creature to creature, they would bring thee no Honey or sweetness home, save what they gathered from their relations to Eternity.</p>

                           <hi>Object.</hi> But you will say perhaps, Divinity is of larger extent, then onely to treat of the life to come, or the way thereto; there are many controversies of great difficulty, which therefore require much of our thoughts, and so they must not be all of heaven.</p>

I can scarce express my own minde more plain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, then in this Historians expressions of the minde of <hi>Graserus.</hi> While I had some competent measure of health, and look't at death as at a greater distance, there was no man more delighted in the study of controversie; but when I saw dying men have no minde on't, and how unsavory and uncomfortable such conference was to them, and when I had oft been neer to death my self, and found no delight in them, further then they confirmed, or illu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>strated the Doctrine of eternal Glory, I have minded them ever since the less: Though every Truth of God is pretious, and it is the sin and shame of Professors that are no more able to defend the Truth, yet should all our study of controversie be still in rela<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion to this perpetual Rest, and consequently be kept within its bounds, and with most Christians, not have the twentieth part of our time or thoughts: Who that hath tried both studies, doth not cry out, as <hi>Summerhard</hi> was wont to do of the Popish School Divinity, <hi>Quis me miserum tandem liberabit ab ista rixosa Theolo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gia?</hi> Who will once deliver me wretch from this wrangling kinde of Divinity? And as its said of <hi>Bucholcer, Cum eximiis a Deo dotibus esset decoratus, in certamen tamen cum rabiosis illius seculi Theologis descendere noluit. Desii (inquit) disputare, caepi supputare: quoniam illud dissipationem, hoc collectionem significaet.

I have ceased (saith he) my Disputations, and now begin my Supputation; for that signifieth Dissipation, but this Col<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lection: For he saw, that those men were the movers of Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>troversies, who had never been warmed with one spark of the love of God; he saw, That from the continual brawls of Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vines, no benefit, but much hurt did accrue to the Churches; and it is worth the observing which the Historian addes, <hi>Quapropter omnis ejus cura in hoc erat, ut auditores fidei suae com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>missos, doceret bene vivere &amp; beate Mori; Et annotatum in ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>versariis amici ejus repererunt, permultos in extremo agone consti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tutos, gratias ipsi hoc nomine egisse, quod ipsius ductu servatorem suum Jesum agnovissent, cujus in cognitione pulchrum vivere, mori vero longe pulcherrimum ducerent.

And as the study of con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>troversies is not the most pleasant, nor the most profitable; so much less the publike handling of them: For do it with the great<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>est meekness, and ingenuity, yet shall we meet with such unrea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sonable men, as the said <hi>Bucholcer</hi> did, <hi>Qui arrepta ex aliquibus voculis calumniandi materia, haereseos insimulare &amp; traducere opti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mum virum non erubescerent; Frustra obtestante ipso, dextrè data, dextrè acciperent. i. e.</hi> Who taking occasion of reproach from some small words, were not ashamed to traduce the good man, and accuse him of Heresie; while he in vain obtested with them, that they should take in good part, what was delivered with a good intention. <hi>Siracides</hi> saith in <hi>Ecclesiasticus,</hi> Chapter 26.

                        <p>So then its clear to me, That there is nothing worth our mind<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, but Heaven, and the way to Heaven.</p>
                        <p>All the Question will be about the affairs of Church and State? Is not this worth our minding? to see what things will come to? and how God will conclude our differences?</p>
                        <p>
                           <hi>Answ.</hi> So far as they are considered as the providences of God, and as they tend to the setling of the Gospel, and Govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of Christ, and so to the saving of our own, and our posteri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties souls, they are well worth our diligent observation; but these are onely their relations to eternity. Otherwise I should look up on all the stirs and commotions in the world, but as the busie gad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of a heap of Ants, or the swarming of a nest of Wasps or Bees: The spurn of a mans foot destroyes all their labor; or as an Enterlude or Tragedy of a few hours long: They first quarrel, and then fight, and let out one anothers blood, and bring them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves more speedily, and violently to their graves; which how<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever they could not long have delayed, and so come down, and the Play is ended: And the next generation succeeds them in their madness, and make the like bustle in the world for a time; and so they also come down, and lie in the dust. Like the <hi>Roman Gladiatores,</hi> that would kill one another by the hundreds, to make the beholders a solemn shew; or as the young men of <hi>Joab</hi> and <hi>Abner,</hi> that must play before them, by stabbing one another to the heart, and fall down and dye, and there is an end of the sport. And is this worth a wise mans observance?</p>
                        <p>Surely, our very bodies themselves, for which we make all this ado in the world, are very silly pieces: Look upon them (not as they are set out in a borrowed bravery) but as they lie rotting in a ditch, or a grave; and you will say, they are silly things indeed. Why then, sure all our dealings in the world, our buyings and sell<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings, and eating and drinking, our building and marrying, our wealth and honors, our peace and our war, so far as they relate not to the life to come, but tend onely to the support and pleasing of this silly flesh, must needs themselves be silly things, and not worthy the frequent thoughts of a Christian: For the Means (as such) is meaner then their end.</p>

                        <p>THus I have given thee these twelve Arguments to consider of, and if it may be, to perswade thee to a heavenly minde: I now desire thee to view them over, read them deliberately, and read them again, and then tell me, Are they Reason, or are they not? Reader, stop here while thou answerest my Question: Are these Considerations weighty, or not? are these Arguments con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vincing, or not? Have I proved it thy duty, and of flat necessity, to keep thy heart on things above, or have I not? Say, Yea, or Nay, man! If thou say Nay; I am confident thou contradictest thine own Conscience, and speakest against the light that is in thee, and thy Reason tells thee thou speakest falsly: If thou say Yea, and acknowledg thy self convinced of the duty; bear wit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness then, that I have thine own confession: That very tongue of thine shall condemn thee, and that confession be pleaded against thee, if thou now go home, and cast this off, and wilfully neglect such a confessed duty; and these twelve Considerations shall be as a Jury to convict thee, which I propounded, hoping they might be effectual to perswade thee. I have not yet fully laid open to you, the nature and particular way of that duty, which I am all this while perswading you to; that is the next thing to be done: All that I have said hitherto, is but to make you willing to perform it. I know the whole work of mans salvation, doth stick most at his own will: If we could once get over this block well, I see not what could stand before us. Be soundly willing, and the work is more then half done. I have now a few plain Directions to give you, for to help you in doing this great work; but alas, its in vain to mention them, except you be willing to put them in practice. What sayeth thou Reader, Art thou willing, or art thou not? wilt thou obey, if I shew thee the way of thy Duty? However, I will set them down, and tender them to thee, and the Lord perswade thy heart to the Work.</p>

                        <p n="1">1. The first is, The living in a known unmortified sin. Observe this. O, what havock this will make in thy soul! O, the joyes that this hath destroyed! The blessed Communion with God, that this hath interrupted! The ruines it hath made amongst mens graces! The soul-strengthning duties that this hath hindred! And above all others, it is especially an enemy to this great duty.</p>

Art thou a slave to thine appetite, in eating or <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

Art thou a proud Seeker of thine own esteem? and a man that must needs have mens good opinion, or else thy minde is all in a combustion? Art thou a wilfully peevish and passionate per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son? as if thou wert made of Tinder or Gun powder, ready to take fire at every word, or every wry look, or every supposed sleighting of thee? or every neglect of a complement or curtesie? Art thou a knowing deceiver of others in thy dealing? or one that hast set thy self to rise in the world? not to speak of greater sins, which all take notice of: If this be thy case, I dare say, Heaven and thy Soul are very great strangers: I dare say, thou art seldom in Heart with God; and there is little hope it should ever be bet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter, as long as thou continuest in these transgressions: These beams in thine eyes, will not suffer thee to look to Heaven; these will be a cloud between thee and God. When thou dost but attempt to study Eternity, and to gather comforts from the life to come, thy sin will presently look thee in the face, and say, These things belong not to thee: How shouldst thou take comfort from Heaven, who takest so much pleasure in the lusts of thy flesh? O, how this will damp thy joyes! and make the thoughts of that day, and state, to become thy trouble, and not thy delight! Every wilful sin that thou livest in, will be to thy comforts as water to the fire; when thou thinkest to quicken them, this will quench them; when thy heart begins to draw neer to God, this will presently come in thy minde, and cover thee with shame, and fill thee with doubting. Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sides (which is most to the point in hand) it doth utterly indispose thee and disable thee to this work: When thou shouldst wind up thy heart to Heaven, alas, its byassed another way; it is intangled in the lusts of the flesh, and can no more ascend in Divine Meditation, then the bird can flie, whose wings are clipt, or that is intangled in the Lime-twigs, or taken in the snare. Sin doth cut the very sinews of the soul; therefore, I say of this heavenly life, as Master <hi>Bolton</hi> saith of Prayer, Either it will make thee leave sinning, or sin will make thee leave it; and that quickly too: For these cannot con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinue together. If thou be here guilty, who readest this, I require
<pb n="647" facs="tcp:61132:366" rendition="simple:additions"/>
thee sadly to think of this folly. O man! what a life dost thou lose! and what a life dost thou chuse! what daily delights dost thou sell, for the swinish pleasure of a stinking lust! what a Christ! what a glory, dost thou turn thy back upon, when thou art going to the embracements of thy hellish pleasures! I have read of a Gallant addicted to uncleanness, who at last, meeting with a beau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiful Dame, and having enjoyed his fleshly desires of her, found her in the morning to be the dead body of one that he had former<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly sinned with, which had been acted by the devil all night, and left dead again in the morning. Surely all thy sinful pleasures are suche. The devil doth animate them in the darkness of the night; but when God awakes thee, at the farther, at death, the deceit is vanished, and nothing left but a carkass to amaze thee, and be a spectacle of horror before thine eyes. Thou thinkest thou hast hold of some choice delight, but it will turn in thy hand (as <hi>Moses</hi> rod) into a Serpent; and then thou wouldst fain be rid of it, if thou knewest how; and wilt <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="2 letters">

God and Mammon Earth and Heaven, cannot both have the delight of thy heart. This makes thee like <hi>Anselmne</hi>'s Bird, with a stone tyed to the foot, which as oft as she took flight, did pluck her to the Earth again.<note place="margin">The descripti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of a Worldling.</note> If thou be a man that hast fancied to thy self, some content or happiness to be found on Earth, and beginnest to taste a sweetness in gain, and to aspire after a fuller and a higher estate, and hast hatched some thriving projects in thy brain, and art driving on thy rising design; Beleeve it, thou art marching with thy back upon Christ, and art posting apace from this Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venly life. Why, hath not the World that from thee, which God hath from the Heavenly? When he is blessing himself in his God, and rejoycing in hope of the glory to come; then thou art blessing thy self in thy prosperity, and rejoycing in hope of thy thriving here: When he is solacing his soul in the views of Christ, of the Angels and Saints, that he shall live with for ever; then art thou comforting thy self with thy wealth, in looking over thy Bills and Bonds, in viewing thy Money, thy Goods, thy Cattel, thy Buildings, or large Possession; and art recreating thy minde in thinking of thy hopes; of the favor of some great ones, on whom thou dependest; of the pleasantness of a plentiful and commanding state; of thy larger provision for thy children after thee; of the rising of thy house, or the obeisance of thine inferiors: Are not these thy morning and evening thoughts, when a gracious soul is above with Christ? Dost thou not delight, and please thy self with the daily roll<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing these thoughts in thy minde, when a gracious soul should have higher delights?

but, man, remember, thou hast to do with the searcher of hearts. It may be thou holdst on in thy course of duty, and prayest as oft as thou didst before; it may be thou keepest in with good Ministers, and with godly men, and seemest as forward in Religion as ever: But what is all this to the purpose? Mock not thy soul, man; for God will not so be mocked. What good may yet re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>main in thee, I know not; but sure I am, thy course is dangerous, and if thou follow it on, will end in dolor. Methinks I see thee befooling thy self, and tearing thy hair, and gnashing thy teeth, when thou hearest thy case laid open by God: Thou fool, this night shall they require thy soul from thee; and then whose are all these things? Certainly, so much as thou delightest and restest on Earth; so much is abated of thy delights in God. Thine earth<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly minde may consist with thy profession and common duties; but it cannot consist with this Heavenly duty. I need not tell thee all this, if thou wouldst deal impartially, and not be a trai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tor to thy own soul; thou knowest thy self how seldom and cold, how cursory and strange thy thoughts have been of the joyes here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>after, ever since thou didst trade so eagerly for the world. Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thinks I even perceive thy conscience stir now, and tell thee plain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, that this is thy case; hear it, man; O, hear it now; least thou hear it in another maner when thou wouldest be full loth. O the cursed madness of many that seem to be religious! who thrust themselves into multitude of employments, and think they can never have business enough, till they are loaded with labors, and clogged with cares, That their souls are as unfit to converse with God, as a man to walk with a mountain on his back; and till he hath even transformed his soul almost into the nature of his drossie carkass, and made it as unapt to soare aloft, as his body is to leap above the Sun: And when all is done, and they have lost that Heaven they might have had upon Earth, they rake up a few rotten arguments to prove it lawful, and then they think that they have salved all; though these sots would not do so for their bodies, nor forbear their eating, or drinking, or sleeping, or sporting, though they could prove it lawful so to do; though indeed they cannot prove it lawful neither. They miss not the pleasures of this Heavenly Life, if they can but quiet their Consciences, while they fasten upon lower and baser plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sures.

Not that I would disswade thee from necessary converse, or from doing them any office of Love; especially not from endeavouring the good of their souls, as long as thou hast any opportunity or hope: Nor would I have thee conclude them to be Dogs and Swine, that so thou maist evade the duty of Reproof: Nor yet to judg them such at all, as long as there is any hope of better, or before thou art certain they are such indeed; much less can I approve of the practice of those, who, because the most of the world are naught, do therefore conclude men Dogs or Swine, before ever they faithfully and lovingly did admonish them, yea, or perhaps before they have known them, or spoke with them; and hereupon they will not communicate with them in the Lords Supper, but separate from them into distinct Congregations; I perswade thee to no such ungodly separation: As I never found one word in Scripture,
<pb n="651" facs="tcp:61132:368" rendition="simple:additions"/>
where either Christ or his Apostles denied admittance to any man that desired to be a Member of the Church, though but onely pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sessing to Repent and Believe; so neither did I ever there finde that any but convicted Hereticks, or scandalous ones (and that for the most part<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> after due admonition) were to be avoided or de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>barred our fellowship. And whereas it is urged, That they are to prove their interest to the priviledges which they lay claim to, and not we to disprove it; I Answer, if that were granted, yet their meer professing to Repent and Believe in Christ, is a sufficient evidence of their interest to Church member-ship, and admittance thereto by Baptism (supposing them not admitted before:) and their being Baptized persons, or members of the universal visible Church (into which it is that they are Baptized) is sufficient evi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence of their interest to the Supper, till they do by Heresie or Scandal blot that Evidence;<note place="margin">Rom. 14.1.</note> which Evidence if they do produce, yea though they are yet weak in the Faith of Christ, who is he that dare refuse to receive them? And this, after much doubting, dispute, and study of the Scriptures, I speak as confidently, as almost any truth of equal moment; So plain is the Scripture in this point, to a man that brings his Understanding to the model of Scripture, and doth not bring a model in his brain, and reduce all he reades to that model. The door of the visible Church, is incomparably wider then the door of heaven; and Christ is so tender, so boun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiful, and forward to convey his grace, and the Gospel so free an offer and invitation to all, that surely Christ will keep no man off; if they will come quite over in spirit to Christ, they shall be wel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come; If they will come but onely to a visible Profession, he will not deny them admittance there, because they intend to go no further, but will let them come as neer as they will, and that they come no further shall be their own fault; and so it is not his readi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness to admit such, nor the openness of the door of his visible Church that makes men Hypocrites, but their own wickedness; Christ will not keep such out among Infidels, for fear of making Hypocrites; but when the net is drawn unto the shore, the fishes shall be separated, and when the time of Harvest comes, then the Angels shall gather out of his Kingdom all things that offend, and them that work iniquity, <hi>Matth.</hi> 13.41. There are many Saints (or sanctified men) that yet shall never come to heaven, who are onely Saints by their separation from Paganism, into fellowship

                        <p>Thus far I have digressed by way of Caution, that you may not think that I disswade you from lawful converse; but it is the un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>necessary society of ungodly men, and too much familiarity with unprofitable companions, though they be not so apparently un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>godly, that I disswade you from. There are many persons, whom we may not avoid, or excommunicate out of the Church, no nor out of our private society, judicially, or by way of penalty to them, whom yet we must exclude from our too much familiarity in way of prudence for preservation of our selves: It is not onely the open prophane, the swearer, the drunkard, and the enemies of godliness, that will prove hurtful companions to us, though these indeed are chiefly to be avoided; but too frequent society with dead-hearted Formalists, or persons meerly civil and moral, or whose conference is empty, unsavory, and barren, may much di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vert our thoughts from heaven, and do our selves a great deal of wrong; as meer idleness and forgetting God, will keep a soul as certainly from Heaven, as a profane, licentious, fleshly life: so also will the usuall company, of such idle, forgetful, negligent per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sons, as surely keep our hearts from heaven, as the company of men more dissolute and profane. Alas, our dulness and backward<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness is such, that we have need of the most constant and powerful helps: A clod, or a stone that lyes on the earth, is as prone to arise and fly in the Air, as our hearts are naturally to move toward heaven: you need not hold nor hinder the earth and Rocks to keep them from flying up to the skies; it is sufficient that you do not help them: And surely if our spirits have not great assistance, they may easily be kept from flying aloft, though they never should meet with the least impediment: O think of this in the choice of your company; when you spirits are so powerfully disposed for heaven, that you need no help to lift them up; but as the flames you are alwayes mounting upward, and carrying with you all thats in your way; then you may indeed be less careful of our company;
<pb n="653" facs="tcp:61132:369" rendition="simple:additions"/>
but till then as you love the delights of a heavenly life, be careful herein: As its reported of a Lord that was neer to his death, and the Doctor that prayed with him read over the Letany, <hi>For all wo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men labouring with childe, for all sick persons and young children,</hi> &amp;c. <hi>From lightning and tempest, from plague, pestilence and famine; from battel, murder, and sudden death,</hi> &amp;c.

What will it conduce to the raising of thy heart God-ward, to hear that this is an able Minister, or that an able Christian, or that this was an excellent Sermon, or that is an excellent book? to hear a violent arguing, or tedious discourse, of Baptism, Cere<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monies, the power of the Keyes, the order of Gods Decrees, or other such controversies of great difficulty and less importance? Yet this for the most part, is the sweetest discourse, that thou art like to have, of a formal, speculative, dead-hearted Professor. Nay, if thou hadst newly been warming thy heart, in the contempla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of the blessed Joys above, would not this discourse benum thine affections, and quickly freez thy heart again? I appeal to the Judgment of any man that hath tryed it, and maketh observati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons on the frame of his spirit. Men cannot well talk of one thing, and minde another, especially things of such differing natures. You young men who are most lyable to this temptation, think sadly of what I say: Can you have your hearts in Heaven on an Ale-house bench, among your roaring, singing, swaggering com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>panions? or when you work in your Shops with none but such,<note place="margin">Eph. 5.4.</note> whose ordinary language is oaths, or filthiness, or foolish talking, or jesting? Nay, let me tell you thus much more; that if you choose such company when you might have better, and finde most delight and content in such, you are so far from a Heavenly con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>versation, that as yet you have no title to heaven at all, and in that estate shall never come there: For were your Treasure there, your heart would not be on things so distant, <hi>Mat.</hi> 6.21.

our company will be part of our happiness in heaven, and its a sin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gular part of our furtherance to it, or hinderance from it. And as the creatures living in the several Elements, are commonly of the temperature of the Element they live in, as the fishes cold and moist like the water, the worms cold and dry as the earth, and so the rest: So are we usually like the society which we most con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verse in.

If sad examples be doctrinal to you, or the Judgments of God upon us be regarded, I need to say the lesse upon this parti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cular.

You that have been my companions in Armies and Garrisons, in Cities and Countreyes, I know have been my companions in this observation, That they are usually men least acquainted with a Heavenly life, who are the violent disputers about the circumstantials of Religi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on: He whose Religion is all in his opinions, will be most fre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quently and zealously speaking his opinions; And he whose Religi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on lyes in the Knowledg and love of God in Christ, will be most delightfully speaking of that time when he shall enjoy God and Christ. As the body doth languish in consuming fevers, when the native heat abates within, and an unnatural heat inflaming the ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ternal parts succeeds; so when the zeal of a Christian doth leave the internals of Religion, and fly to ceremonials, externals or inferior things, the soul must needs consume and languish. Yea though you were sure your opinions were true, yet when the chiefest of your zeal is turned thither, and the chiefest of your conference there laid out, the life of grace decays within, &amp; your hearts are turned from this heavenly life. Not that I would perswade you to undervalue the least truth of God, nor that I do acknowledg the hot disputers of

Ah he is a rare and pretious Christian, who is skilled in the improving of well known truths. Therefore let me advise you that aspire after this Joyous Life; spend not too much of your thoughts, your time, your zeal, or your speeches upon quarrels that less concern your souls; But when hypocrits are feeding on huskes or shels, or on this heated food which will burn their lips, far sooner then warm and streng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>then their hearts; then do you feed on the Joys above.

                        <p n="5">5. AS you value the comforts of a heavenly Life, take heed of a proud and lofty spirit. There is such an Antipathy between this sin and God, that thou wilt never get thy heart neer him, nor get him neer thy heart, as long as this prevaileth in it. If it cast the Angels from heaven that were in it, it must needs keep thy heart estranged from it: If it cast our first parents out of Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>radise, and separated between the Lord and us, and brought his curse on all the creatures here below; it must needs then keep our hearts from Paradise, and increase the cursed seperation from our God. Believe it, hearers, a proud heart and a Heavenly heart, are exceeding contrary. Entercourse with God will keep men low
<pb n="657" facs="tcp:61132:371" rendition="simple:additions"/>
and that lowliness will further their entercourse: when a man is used to be much with God, and taken up in the study of his glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rious attributes, he abhors himself in dust and ashes: and that self-abhorrance is his best preparative, to obtain admittance to God a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gain. Therefore after a soul-humbling day, or in times of trouble, when the soul is lowest, it useth to have freest access to God, and savour most of the life above: He will bring them into the wil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derness, and there he will speak comfortably to them, <hi>Hos.</hi> 2.14. The delight of God is in a humble soul even him that is contrite and trembleth at his word; and the delight of a Humble soul is in God:<note place="margin">Isa. 57.15. and 66.2. Psal. 34.18. and 51.17.</note> and sure where there is mutual delight, there will be freest admittance, and heartiest welcome, and most frequent converse. Heaven would not hold God and the proud Angels together; but a humble soul he makes his dwelling: and surely if our dwelling be with him, and in him, and his dwelling also be with us and in us, there must needs be a most neer and sweet familiarity<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> But the soul that is proud cannot plead this priviledg; God is so far from dwelling in it, that he will not admit it to any neer access, but looks upon it afar off. <hi>Psal.</hi> 138.6. The proud he resisteth (and the proud resisteth him) but to the humble he gives this and o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther Graces. 1 <hi>Pet.</hi> 5.5. A proud minde is a high minde in con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceit, self-esteem, and carnal-aspiring: A heavenly minde is a high minde indeed,<note place="margin">James 4.6.</note> in Gods esteem, and in higher (yet holy) aspiring, These two sorts of high-mindedness, are more adverse to one another, then a high minde and a low: As we see that most wars and bloodshed is between Princes and Princes, and not between a Prince and a Plowman. A low spirit and a humble, is not so contrary to a high and heavenly, as is a high and a proud. A grain of Mustard Seed may come to be a tree; A small Acorn may be a great Oake. The sail of the windmil that is now down, may presently be the highest of all; A Subject that is low may be raised high, and he that is high may be yet higher, as long as he stands in subordination to his Prince, who is the fountain of honor but if he break out of that subordination, and become a com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>petitor, or will assume and arrogate honor to himself; he will finde this prove the falling way.

Or if thou hadst had the managing of other mens business, thou wouldst have carried it more honestly and wisely? If these Symtomes be undeniably in thy heart, beyond doubt thou art a proud person. I will not talk of thy following the fashions, of thy bravery and comportment, thy proud gestures, and arrogant speeces, thy living at a rate above thy abilities: Perhaps thy in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>competency of estate, or thy competency of wit, may suffice to restrain these unmanly fooleries; perhaps thou maist rather seem sordid to others, and to live at a rate below thy worth, and yet if thou be guilty of the former accusations, be it known to thee, thou art a person abominably proud, it hath seized on thy heart, which is the principall Fort; there's too much of hell abiding in thee, for thee to have any acquaintance at heaven; thy soul is too like the devil, for thee to have any familiarity with God: A proud man is all in the flesh, and he that will be heavenly must be much in the Spirit. Is it likely that the man whom I have here described, hath either will or skill to go out of Himself, and out of the Flesh, as it were, and out of the world, that so he may have freedom for con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verse above? A proud man make himself his God, and admires and sets up himself as his Idol; how then can he have his affections set on God?

O, if it were onely the exercise of the Body, the moving of the Lips, the bending of the Knee; then it were an easie work indeed, and men would as commonly step to Heaven, as they go a few miles to visit a friend; yea, if it were to spend most of our days in numbering Beads, and repeating certain words and Prayers, in

But it is a work more difficult then all this: To separate thoughts and affections from the world; to force them to a work of so high a nature; to draw forth all our graces in their order, and exercise each on its proper object; to hold them to this, till they perceive success and till the work doth thrive and prosper in their hands! This, this is the difficult task. Reader, Heaven is above thee, the way is upwards. Dost thou think, who art a feeble, short-winded sinner, to travel daily this steep ascent, without a great deal of labor and resolution?

This is to lie a bed and wish, when thou shouldst be up and doing. How many a hundred do read Books, and hear Sermons, in expectation to hear of some easie course, or to meet with a shorter cut to comforts, then ever they are like to finde in the Word! And if they can hear of none from the Preachers of Truth, they will snatch it with rejoycing from the Teachers of Falshood; and presently applaud the excellency of the doctrine, because it hath fitted their lazy temper; and think there is no other doctrine will comfort the soul, because it will not comfort it with hearing, and looking on. They think their Venison is best, though accompanied with a lie, because it is the easiest catched, and next at hand, and they think will procure the chiefest blessing, (and so it may, if God be as subject to mistake as blinde <hi>Isaac.</hi>) And while they pretend enmity onely to the impos<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sibilities of the Law, they oppose the easier conditions of the Gospel, and cast off the burden that is light also, and which all must bear that will finde rest to their souls; and in my judgment, may as fitly be stiled enemies to the Gospel <note n="*" place="margin">

It was an established Law among the <hi>Argi,</hi> That if a man were perceived to be idle and lazy, he must give an account before the Magistrate, how he came by his victuals and maintenance: And sure, when I see these men lazy in the use of Gods appointed means for comfort, I cannot but question how they come by their comforts: I would they would examine it throughly themselves; for God will require an account of it from them. Idleness, and not improving the Truth in painful duty, is the common cause of mens seeking comfort from Error; even as the people of <hi>Israel,</hi> when they had no com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fortable answer from God, because of their own sin and neglect, would run to seek it from the Idols of the Heathens: So when men-were falshearted to the Truth, and the Spirit of Truth did deny them comfort, because they denied him sincere obedience; there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore they will seek it from a lying spirit.</p>

Though the knowledg of excel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lency and suitableness may stir up that love, which worketh by desire; yet there must be the knowledg of our interest or proprie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty, to the setting awork of our love of complacency. We may confess Heaven to be the best condition, though we despair of en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>joying it; and we may desire, and seek it, if we see the obtainment to be but probable and hopeful: But we can never delightfully rejoyce in it, till we are somewhat perswaded of our title to it. What comfort is it to a man that is naked, to see the rich attire of others? or to a man that hath not a bit to put in his mouth, to see a feast which he must not taste of? What delight hath a man that hath not a house to put his head in, to see the sumptuous buildings of others? Would not all this rather increase his anguish, and make him more sensible of his own misery? So for a man to know the excellencies of Heaven, and not to know whether he shall ever enjoy them, may well raise desire, and provoke to seek it, but it will raise but little joy and content. Who will set his heart on another mans possessions? If your houses, your goods, your cattel, your children, were not your own, you would less minde them, and delight less in them.

till you can call this Rest your own; sit not down without assu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rance; get alone, and question with thy self; bring thy heart to the bar of tryal; force it to answer the interrogatories put to it; set the conditions of the Gospel, and qualifications of the Saints on one side, and thy performance of those conditions, and the qualifications of thy soul on the other side; and then judg how neer they resemble: Thou hast the same word before thee, to judg thy self by now, by which thou must be judged at the great day: Thou art there before told the questions that must then be put to thee<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> put these questions now to thy self: Thou mayst there read the very Articles, upon which thou shalt be tryed; why try thy self by those Articles now.

For as groundless hopes do tend to confusion, and are the greatest cause of most mens damnation; so groundless doubtings do tend to discomforts, and are the great cause of the disquieting of the Saints.

we should less need to perswade their thoughts unto it, or to press them to set their delight in it. O if men did truly know, that God is their own Father, and Christ their own Redeemer and Head, and that those are their own Everlasting habitations, and that there it is that they must abide and be happy for ever; how could they chuse but be ravished with the forethoughts thereof? If a Christian could but look upon Sun, and Moon and Stars, and reckon all his own in Christ, and say, These are the portion that my Husband doth bestow, These are the blessings that my Lord hath procured me, and things incomparably greater then these; what holy raptures would his spirit feel? The more do they sin against their own comforts, as well as against the Grace of the Gospel, who are wilful maintainers of their own doubtings, and plead for their unbelief, and cherish distrustful thoughts of God, and scandalous injurious thoughts of their Redeemer who repre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sent the Covenant, as if it were of works and not of grace, and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>present Christ as an enemy, rather then as a Savior; as if he were glad of advantages against them, and were willing that they should keep off from him and dye in their unbelief; when he hath called them so oft, and invited them so kindly, and born the hell that they should bear. Ah wretches that we are! that be keeping up Jealousies of the Love of our Lord, when we should be rejoyc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing and bathing our souls in his love! That can question that love, which hath been so fully evidenced! and doubt still, whether he that hath stooped so low, and suffered so much, and taken up a na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture and office of purpose, be yet willing to be theirs who are willing to be his! As if any man could chose Christ, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore Christ hath chosen him! or any man could desire to have Christ, more then Christ desires to have him! or any man were more willing to be happy, then Christ is to make him happy! Fie upon these injurious (if not blasphemous) thoughts! If ever thou have harboured such thoughts in thy brest; or if ever thou have uttered such words with thy tongue, spit out that venome, vomit out that rancor, cast them from thee, and take heed how thou ever entertainest them more. God hath written the names of his people in heaven, as you use to write your names in your own books, or upon your own Goods, or set your Marks on your own sheep: And shall we be attempting to rase them out, and to write our names on the doors of hell?

ANother help to sweeten thy soul with the foretasts of Rest, is this; Labor to apprehend how neer it is, Think seriously of its speedy approach That which we think is neer at hand, we are more sensible of, then that which we behold at a distance. When we hear of war or famin in another country, it troubleth not so much: or if we hear it prophesied of a long time hence, so if we hear of plenty a great way off, or of a golden age that shall fall out, who knows when; this never rejoyceth us. But if Judgments or Mercies begin to draw neer, then they affect us, If we were sure we should see the golden Age, then it would take with us. When the plague is in a Town but twenty miles off, we do not fear it; nor much prehaps, if it be but in another street: but if once it come to the next door, or if it seaze on one in our own family; then we begin to think on it more feelingly; It is so with mercies as well as Judgments. VVhen they are far off, we talk of them as marvells; but when they draw close to us, we re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>joyce in them as Truths. This makes men think on Heaven so in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sensibly, because they conceit it at too great a distance: They look on it as twenty, or thirty, or fourty yeers off; and this is it that duls their sense.

Do not dayes and nights come very thick? Dost thou not feel that building of flesh to shake? and perceive thy house of clay to totter? Look on thy glass, and see how it runs: Look on thy watch, how fast it getteth? what a short moment is between us and our Rest? what a step is it from hence to Everlastingness?

ANother help is this, Make an advantage of every object thou seest, and of every passage of Divine providence, and of every thing that befals in thy labor and calling, to minde thy soul of its approaching Rest. As all providences and creatures are means to our Rest, so do they point us to that as their end. Every creature hath the name of God and of our final Rest written upon it; which a considerate believer may as truly discern, as he can read upon a post or hand in a cross way, the name of the Town or City which it points to. This spiritual use of creatures and providences, is Gods great End in bestowing them on man; And he that overlooks this End, must needs rob God of his chiefest praise, and deny him the greatest part of his thanks. The Relati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on that our present mercies have to our great Eternal mercies, is the very quintessence and spirits of all these mercies. Therefore do they loose the very spirits of their mercies, and take no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing but the huskes and bran, who do overlook this Relation, and draw not forth the sweetness of it in their contemplations. Gods sweetest dealings with us at the present, would not be half so sweet as they are, if they did not intimate some further sweetness. As our selves have a fleshly and a spiritual substance, so have our mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cies a fleshly and spiritual use, and are fitted to the nourishing of both our parts. He that receives the carnal part and no more, may have his body comforted by them, but not his soul. It is not all one to receive six pence meerly as six pence, and to receive it in earnest of a thousand pound; though the sum be the same, yet I trow the relation makes a wide difference. Thou takest but the bear ear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nest, and overlookest the maine sum, when thou receivest thy mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cies, and forgettest thy crown. O therefore that Christians were skilled in this Art! You can open your Bibles, and read there of God and of Glory: O learn to open the creatures, and to open the several passages of providence, and to read of God and Glory there. Certainly by such a skilful industrious improvement, we might have a fuller tast of Christ and Heaven, in every bit of bread that we eat, and in every draught of Beer that we drink, then most men have in the use of the Sacrament. If thou prosper in the world, and thy labor succeed, let it make thee more sensible of thy perpetual pros<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perity:
<pb n="679" facs="tcp:61132:385" rendition="simple:additions"/>
If thou be weary of thy labors, let it make thy thoughts of Rest more sweet: If things go cross &amp; hard with thee in the world, let it make thee the more earnestly desire that day, when all thy sorrows and sufferings shall cease: Is thy body refreshed with food or sleep? Remember thy unconceivable refreshings with Christ. Dost thou hear any news that makes the glad? Remember what glad tydings it will be, to hear the sound of the trump of God, and the absolving sentence of Christ our Judg. Art thou delight<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing thy self in the society of the Saints? Remember the Everlast<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing amiable fraternity, thou shalt have with perfected Saints in Rest. Is God communicating himself to thy spirit? Why remem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber that time of thy highest advancement, when thy Joy shall be full, as thy communion is full. Dost thou hear the raging noise of the wicked? and the disorders of the vulgar? and the confusions in the world? like the noise in a crowd, or the roaring of the waters? Why think of the blessed agreement in Heaven, and the melodi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous harmony in that Quire of God. Dost thou hear or feel the tempest of wars? or see any cloud of blood arising? Remember the day when thou shalt be housed with Christ, where there is no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing but calmness and amiable union, and where we shall solace our selves in perfect Peace, under the wings of the Prince of Peace for ever. Thus you may see, what advantages to a Heavenly Life, every condition and creature doth afford us, if we had but hearts to apprehend and improve them: As its said of the Turkes, that they'l make bridges of the dead bodyes of their men, to passe over the trenches or ditches in their way: So might Christians of the very ruines and calamities of the times, and of every dead body or misery that they see, make a bridge for the passage of their thoughts to their Rest. And as they have taught their Pigeons which they call carriers in divers places, to bear letters of enter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>course from friend to friend, at a very great distance: so might a wise industrious Christian get his thoughts carried into Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven, and receive, as it were, returns from thence again, by creatures of slower wing then Doves, by the assistance of the Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit the Dove of God. This is the right <hi>Daedalian</hi> flight: and thus we may take from each bird a feather, and make us wings, and fly to Christ.</p>

                        <p n="7">7. ANother singular help is this, Be much in that Angelical work of Praise. As the most heavenly Spirits will have the most heavenly imployment, so the more heavenly the imployment, the more will it make the Spirit heavenly: Though the heart be the Fountain of all our actions, and the actions will be usually of the quality of the heart; yet do those actions by a kinde of re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flexion, work much on the heart from whence they spring: The like also may be said of our speeches. So that the work of prai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sing God, being the most heavenly work, is likely to raise us to the most heavenly temper. This is the work of those Saints and An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gels, and this will be our own everlasting work; if we were more taken up in this imployment now, we should be liker to what we shall be then. When <hi>Aristotle</hi> was asked what he thought of Musick? he answers, <hi>Jovem neque canere, neque citharam pulsare,</hi> That <hi>Jupiter</hi> did neither sing, nor play on the Harp; thinking it an unprofitable art to men, which was no more delightful to God. But Christians may better argue from the like ground, that singing of praise is a most profitable duty, because it is so delightful, as it were, to God himself, that he hath made it his peoples Eternal work; for they shall sing the Song of <hi>Moses,</hi> and the Song of the Lamb. As Desire, and Faith, and Hope, are of shorter con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinuance, then Love and Joy; so also Preaching, and Prayer, and Sacraments, and all means for confirmation, and expression of Faith and Hope, shall cease, when our Thanks and Praise, and tri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>umphant expressions of Love and Joy shall abide for ever.
<q>The liveliest embleme of Heaven that I know upon Earth, is, When the people of God in the deep sense of his excellency and bounty, from hearts abounding with Love and Joy, do joyn together both in heart and voice, in the cheerful and melodious singing of his praises.</q>
Those that deny the lawful use of singing the Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture Psalms in our times, do disclose their unheavenly unexperi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>enced hearts, I think, as well as their ignorant understandings. Had they felt the heavenly delights, that many of their Brethren in such duties have felt, I think they would have been of another minde: And whereas they are wont to question, whether such de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lights be genuine, or any better then carnal or delusive? Surely,
<pb n="681" facs="tcp:61132:386" rendition="simple:additions"/>
the very rellish of Christ and Heaven that is in them, the example of the Saints in Scripture, whose spirits have been raised by the same duty, and the command of Scripture for the use of this means, one would think should quickly decide the controversie. And a man may as truly say of these delights, as they use to say of the testimony of the Spirit, That they witness-themselves to be of God, and bring the evidence of their heavenly parentage along with them. And whereas they allow onely extemporate Psalms, im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mediately dictated to them by the Spirit: When I am convinced, that the gift of extemporate singing, is so common to the Church, that any man who is spiritually merry can use it, <hi>Jam.</hi> 5.13. And when I am convinced, that the use of Scripture Psalms, is abolished, or prohibited, then I shall more regard their judgment. Certainly, as large as mine acquaintance hath been with men of this Spirit, I never yet heard any one of them sing a Psalm <hi>ex tempore,</hi> that was better then <hi>Davids</hi>; yea, or that was tolerable to a judicious hearer, and not rather a shame to himself and his opinion. But sweet experience will be a powerful Argument, and will teach the sincere Christian to hold fast his exercise of this soul-raising duty.</p>
                        <p>Little do we know how we wrong our selves, by shutting out of our prayers the praises of God, or allowing them so narrow a room as we usually do, while we are copious enough in our Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fessions and Petitions. Reader, I entreat thee remember this: Let praises have a larger room in thy duties: Keep ready at hand matter to feed thy praise, as well as matter for Confession and Petition. To this end, study the excellencies and goodness of the Lord, as frequently as thy own necessities and vileness; study the mercies which thou hast received, and which are promised, both their own proper worth, and their aggravating circumstances, as often as thou studiest the sins thou hast committed. O let Gods praise be much in your mouths,<note place="margin">Psal. 34.1. and 35.28.</note> for in the mouths of the upright his praise is comely, <hi>Psal.</hi> 33.1. Seven times a day did <hi>David</hi> praise him. <hi>Psal.</hi> 119.164. Yea, his praise was continually of him, <hi>Psal.</hi> 71.6. As he that offereth praise, glorifieth God, <hi>Psal.</hi> 50.23. So doth he most rejoyce and glad his own soul. <hi>Psal.</hi> 98.4. Offer therefore the sacrifice of praise continually.<note place="margin">and 22.25.</note> 
                           <hi>Heb.</hi> 13.15. In the midst of the Church, let us sing his praise. <hi>Heb.</hi> 2.12. Praise our God, for he is good, sing praises unto his Name, for it is pleasant.

                           <hi>Psal.</hi> 135.3. and 147.1. Yea, let us rejoyce and triumph in his praise, <hi>Psal.</hi> 106.47.</p>
                        <p>Do you think that <hi>David</hi> had not a most heavenly Spirit, who was so much imployed in this heavenly work? Doth it not some<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>time, very much raise your hearts, when you do but seriously read that divine Song of <hi>Moses, Deut.</hi> 32. And those heavenly itera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted praises of <hi>David,</hi> having almost nothing sometime, but praise in his mouth? How much more would it raise and refresh us, to be skilled and accustomed in the work our selves? I confess, to a man of a languishing body, where the heart doth faint, and the spirits are feeble, the cheerful praising of God is more difficult, because the body is the souls instrument; and when it lies unstring<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, or untuned, the musick is likely to be accordingly but dull. Yet a spiritual cheerfulness there may be within, and the heart may praise, if not the voice. But where the body is strong, the spirits lively, the heart cheerful, and the voice at command, what ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vantage have such for this heavenly work? with what alacrity and vivacity may they sing forth praises? O the madness of healthful youth that lay out this vigor of body and minde, upon vain de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lights and fleshly lusts, which is so fit for the noblest work of man! And O the sinful folly of many of the Saints, who drench their spirits in continual sadness, and wast their days in complaints and groans, and fill their bodies with wasting diseases, and so make themselves both in body and minde, unfit for this sweet and hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venly work! That when they should joyn with the people of God in his praises, and delight their souls in singing to his Name; they are questioning their worthiness, and studying their miseries, or raising scruples about the lawfulness of the duty, and so rob God of his praise, and themselves of their solace. But the greatest destroyer of our comfort in this duty, is our sticking in the carnal delight thereof, and taking up in the tune and melody, and suffer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the heart to be all the while idle, which must perform the chief<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>est part of the work, and which should make use of the melody, for its reviving and exhilerating.</p>

IF thou wouldest have thy heart in Heaven, keep thy soul still possessed with true believing thoughts of the exceeding, in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>finite love of God. Love is the attractive of love. No mans heart will be set upon him that hates him, were he never so excel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lent; nor much upon him, that doth not much love him. There is few so vile, but will love those that love them, be they never so mean. No doubt it is the death of our heavenly life, to have hard and doubtful thoughts of God; to conceive of him as a hater of the Creature (except onely of obstinate Rebels,) and as one that had rather damn us, then save us, and that is glad of an oppor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tunity to do us a mischief, or at least hath no great good will to us<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> This is to put the Blessed God into the similitude of Satan. And who then can set his heart and love upon him? When in our vile unbelief and ignorance, we have drawn the most ugly picture of God in our imaginations, then we complain, that we cannot love him, and delight in him. This is the case of many thousand Christians. Alas, that we should thus belie and blaspheme God, and blast our own joyes, and depress our spirits! Love is the very essence of God.<note place="margin">1 John 4.16. Isai. 27.4.

Much more hath he testified his love to his chosen; and his full re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>solution effectually to save them. O, if we could always think of God, but as we do of a friend; as of one that doth unfeignedly love us, even more then we do our selves; whose very heart is set upon us to do us good, and hath therefore provided us an ever<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lasting dwelling with himself, it would not then be so hard to have our hearts still with him! Where we love most heartily, we shall think most sweetly, and most freely: And nothing will quicken our love more then the belief of his love to us. Get therefore a truer conceit of the loving Nature of God, and lay up all the experi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ences, and discoveries of his love to thee; and then see if it will not further thy heavenly-mindedness.</p>

When we consider how frequently men offend on both ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>treams, and how few use their bodies aright, we cannot wonder if they be much hindered in their heavenly conversing. Most men are very slaves to their sensitive appetite, and can scarce deny any thing to the flesh, which they can give it on easie rates, without much shame, or loss, or grief. The flesh thus used, is as unfit to serve you, as a wilde colt to ride on. When such men should converse in Heaven, the flesh will carry them to an Alehouse, or to their sports, to their profits, or credit, or vain company; to wanton practices, or sights, or speeches, or thoughts: It will thrust a whore, or a pair of Cards, or a good bargain into their mindes, in stead of God. Look to this specially, you that are young, and healthful, and lusty: As you love your souls, remember that in <hi>Rom.</hi> 13.14. which con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verted <hi>Austin,</hi> Make not provision for the flesh, to fulfil its desires; and that <hi>Rom.</hi> 8.4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 12, 13, 14. Some few others do much hinder their heavenly joy, by over rigorous denying the body its necessaries, and so making it unable to serve them. But the most by forfeiting and excess; do overthrow and disable it. You love to have your knife keen, and every instrument you use in order: when your horse goes lustily how cheerfully do you travel? As much need hath the soul of a sound and cheerful body. If they who abuse their bodies, and neglect their health, did wrong the flesh onely, the matter were small, but they wrong the soul also: As he that spoils the house, doth wrong the inhabitant. When the body is sick, and the spirits do languish, how heavily move we in these Meditations, and Joyes? Yet where God denieth this mercy, we may the better bear it, because he oft occasioneth our benefit by the denial.</p>

                           </note> Why, it
<pb n="688" facs="tcp:61132:390"/>
is, The set and solemn acting of all the powers of thy soul upon this most perfect object [Rest] by Meditation.</p>
                        <p>I will a little more fully explain the meaning of this description, that so the duty may lye plaine before thee. 1. The general title that I give to this duty is [Meditation] Not as it is precisely distinguish<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed from Cogitation, Consideration and Contemplation, but as it is taken in the larger and usual sense, for Cogitation on things spiritu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>al, and so comprehending consideration and contemplation.</p>
                        <p>That Meditation is a duty of Gods ordaining, not only in his written Law, but also in nature it self, I never met with the man that would deny: But that it is a duty constantly and conscionably practised even by the godly, so far as my acquaintance extends, I must, with sorrow, deny it: It is in word confessed to be a Duty by all, but by the constant neglect denyed by most. And (I know not by what fatal customary security it comes to passe, that) men that are very tender conscienc't towards most other duties, yet do as easily overslip this, as if they knew it not to be a duty at all: They that are presently troubled in minde, if they omit but a Sermon, a Fast, a Prayer in publique or private, yet were never troubled that they have omitted Meditation perhaps all their life time to this very day: Though it be that duty by which all other duties are im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proved, and by which the soul digesteth Truths, and draweth forth their strength for its nourishment and refreshing. Certainly I think, that as a man is but half an hour in chewing and taking into his stomack, that meat which he must have seven or eight hours at least to digest;; so a man may take into his understanding and memory more Truth in one hour, then he is able well to digest in many. A man may eat too much, but he cannot digest too well: Therefore God commandeth <hi>Joshua,</hi> That the book of the Law depart not out of his mouth, but that he Meditate therein day and night, that he may observe to do according to that which is written therein, <hi>Josh.</hi> 1.8. As Digestion is the turning of the raw food into chyle, and blood, and spirits, and flesh: So Meditation right<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly mannaged, turneth the Truths received and remembred, into warm affection, raised resolution, and holy and upright conversa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion. Therefore what good those men are like to get by Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mons or providences, who are unacquainted with, and unaccustom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed to this work of Meditation, you may easily judge. And why so much preaching is lost among us, and professors can run from Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon
<pb n="689" facs="tcp:61132:390" rendition="simple:additions"/>
to Sermon, and are never weary of hearing or reading, and yet have such languishing starved souls; I know no truer nor greater cause, then their ignorance, and unconscionable neglect of Meditation. If a man have the Lientery, that his meat pass from him as he took it in; or if he vomit it up as fast as he eates it, what strength and vigor of body and senses is this man like to have? Indeed he may well eat more then a sounder man, and the small abode that it makes in the stomack, may refresh it at the present, and help to draw it out a lingering, lan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guishing, uncomfortable, unprofitable life: And so do our hear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers that have this disease; perhaps they hear more then otherwise they needed; and the clear discovery and lively delivery of the Truth of God, may warm and refresh them a little, while they are hearing, and perhaps an hour or two after; and it may be it may linger out their Grace, in a languishing, uncomfortable, unprofit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able life: But if they did hear one hour and meditate seven, if they did as constantly digest their Sermons as they hear them, and not take in one Sermon before the former is well concocted, they would finde another kinde of benefit by Sermons, then the ordina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry sort of the forwardest Christians do. I know many carnal persons do make this an Argument against frequent preaching and hearing, who do it meerly from a lothing of the word, and know far less how to Meditate, then they know how understandingly to hear: Only they pretend Meditation against often hearing, because that beeing a duty of the minde, you cannot so easily discern their o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mission of it. These are sick of the Anorexia and Apepsy, they have neither appetite nor digeston: the other of the Boulimos, they have appetite, but no digestion.</p>

BUt because Meditation is a general word, and it is not all Meditation that I hear intend; I shall therefore lay thee down the difference, whereby this Meditation that I am urging thee to, is discerned from all other sorts of Meditation.

I Call it the acting of [<hi>All</hi>] the powers of the soul, To dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ference it from the common Meditation of Students, which is usually the meer imployment of the Brain. It is not a bare thinking, that I mean, nor the meer use of Invention or Memory; but a business of a higher and more excellent nature: when Truth is apprehended only as Truth, this is but an unsavory and loose appre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hension; but when it is apprehended as Good, as well as True, this is a fast and delightful apprehending: As a man is not so prone to live according to the Truth he knows, except it do deeply affect him, so neither doth his soul enjoy its sweetness, except Speculati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on do pass to Affection: The Understanding is not the whole soul, and therefore cannot do the whole work; As God hath made several parts in man, to perform their several Offices for his nou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rishing and life, so hath he ordained the faculties of the soul to perform their several Offices for his spiritual life; the Stomack must chy lisy and prepare for the Liver, the Liver and Spleen must sanguify and prepare for the Heart and Brain, and these must beget the vital and animal spirits <hi>&amp;c.</hi> so the Understanding must take in Truths, and prepare them for the Will, and it must receive them, and commend them to the Affections: The best digestion is in the
<pb n="692" facs="tcp:61132:392"/>
bottome of the Stomack; the Affections are as it were the bot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tome of the soul, and therefore the best digestion is there: While Truth is but a speculation swimming in the Brain, the Soul hath not half received it, nor taken fast hold of it; Christ and Heaven hath various Excellencies, and therefore God hath formed the soul with a power of divers wayes of apprehending, that so we might be capable of enjoying those divers Excellencies in Christ, even as the creatures having their severall uses, God hath given us several senses, that so we might enjoy the delights of them all: What the better had we been for the pleasant oderiferous flowers and perfumes, if we had not possessed the sense of Smelling? or what good would Language or Musick have done us, if God had not given us the sense of hearing? or what delight should we have found in meats or drinks, or sweetest things, if we had been de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prived of the sense of tasting? Why so, what good could all the glory of Heaven have done us? or what pleasure should we have had, even in the goodness and perfection of God himself, if we had been without the affections of Love and Joy, whereby we are capable of being delighted in that Goodness? so also, what be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nefit of strength or sweetness, canst thou possible receive by thy Meditations on Eternity, while thou dost not exercise those Affe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctions, which are the senses of the soul, by which it must receive this sweetness and strength?</p>
                        <p>This is it that hath deceived Christians in this business; They have thought that Meditation is nothing but the bare thinking on Truths, and the rolling of them in the Understanding and Memory? when every School-Boy can do this, or persons that hate the things which they think on.</p>

                        <p>There are two accesses of Contemplation (saith <hi>Bernard</hi>) one in Intellection, the other in Affection, one in Light, the other in Heat, one in Acquisition, the other in Devotion. If thou shouldst study of nothing but Heaven while thou livest, and shouldst have
<pb n="693" facs="tcp:61132:392" rendition="simple:additions"/>
thy thoughts at command, to turn them hither on every occasion, and yet shouldst proceed no further then this; this were not the Meditation that I intend, nor would it much advantage or better thy soul; as it is thy whole soul that must possess God hereafter, so must the whole in a lower measure possess him here. I have shewed you in the beginning of this Treatise, how the soul must enjoy the Lord in Glory, to wit, by knowing, by loving, and joying in him; why, the very same way must thou begin thy enjoyment here.</p>
                        <p>So much as thy Understanding and Affections are sincerely acted upon God, so much dost thou enjoy him: And this is the happy Work of this Meditation. So that you see, here is some<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>what more to be done, then barely to remember and think of Heaven; as Running, and Ringing, and Moving, and such like labors, do not onely stir a hand or a foot, but do strain and ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ercise the whole body, so doth Meditation the whole soul.</p>
                        <p>As the Affections of Sinners are set on the world, and turned to Idols, and faln from God, as well as the Understanding; so must the Affections of men be reduced to God, and taken up with him, as well as the Understanding; and as the whole was filled with sin before, so the whole must be filled with God now; as St. <hi>Paul</hi> saith of Knowledg, and Gifts, and Faith to remove mountains, that if thou have all these without Love,<note place="margin">1 Cor. 13.1, 2.</note> Thou art but as <hi>sounding Brass, or as a tinkling Cymbal</hi>; so I may say of the exercise of these, If in this work of Meditation, thou do exercise Knowledg, and Gifts, and Faith of Miracles, and not exercise Love, and Joy, thou dost nothing, thou playest the childe and not the man, the Sinners part, and not the Saints, for so will Sinners do also: If thy Meditation tends to fill thy Note-Book with notions and good sayings concerning God, and not thy heart with longings after him, and delight in him, for ought I know thy Book is as much a Christian as thou.

                        <p n="4">4. I Call this Meditation [Set and Solemn] to difference it from that which is Occasional and Cursory. As there is Prayer, which is solemn, (when we set our selves wholly to the duty) and Prayer, which is sudden and short, commonly called, Ejaculations, (when a man in the midst of other business doth send up some brief request to God;) so also there is Meditation solemn, (when we apply our selves onely to that work;) and there is Meditation which is short and cursory, (when in the midst of our business we have some good thoughts of God in our mindes.) And as solemn Prayer is either, First, See, (when a Christian observing it as a standing duty, doth resolvedly practise it in a constant course;) or secondly, Occasional, (when some unusual occasion doth put us upon it at a season extraordinary;) so also Meditation admits of the like distinction. Now, though I would perswade you to that Meditation which is mixt with your common labors in your call<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings; and to that which special occasions do direct you to; yet these are not the main thing which I here intend: But that you would make it a constant standing duty, as you do by Hearing, and Praying, and Reading the Scripture; and that you would so<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lemnly set your selves about it, and make it for that time your whole work, and intermix other matters no more with it, then you would do with prayer, or other duties. Thus you see, as it is differ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>enced by its act, what kinde of Meditation it is that we speak of, <hi>viz.</hi> It is the set and solemn acting of all the powers of the Soul.</p>

                        <p>THe second part of the Difference is drawn from its object, which is [Rest] or the most blessed estate of man, in his everlasting enjoyment of God in Heaven. Meditation hath a large field to walk in, and hath as many objects to work upon, as there are matters, and lines, and words in the Scripture, as there are known Creatures in the whole Creation, and as there are par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticular discernable passages of Providence, in the Government of the persons and actions, through the world: But the Meditati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
<pb n="695" facs="tcp:61132:394" rendition="simple:additions"/>
that I now direct you in, is onely of the end of all these, and of these as they refer to that end: It is not a walk from Mountains to Valleys, from Sea to Land, from Kingdom to Kingdom, from Planet to Planet: But it is a walk from Mountains and Valleys, to the Holy Mount <hi>Zion</hi>; from Sea and Land, to the Land of the Living; from the Kingdoms of this world, to the Kingdom of Saints; from Earth to Heaven; from Time to Eternity: It is a walking upon Sun, and Moon, and Stars; it is a walk in the Gar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>den, and Paradise of God<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> It may seem far off; but spirits are quick; whether in the body, or out of the body, their motion is swift: They are not so heavy, or dull, as these earthly lumps; nor so slow of motion, as these clods of flesh. I would not have you cast off your other Meditations; but surely, as Heaven hath the preheminence in perfection, so should it have the preheminence also in our Meditation. That which will make us most happy when we possess it, will make us most joyful when we meditate upon it; especially, when that Meditation is a degree of Possessi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, if it be such affecting Meditation as I here describe.</p>
                        <p>You need not here be troubled with the fears of the world, lest studying so much on these high matters, should craze your brains, and make you mad, unless you will go mad with delight, and joy, and that of the purest and most solid kinde: If I set you to meditate as much on Sin and Wrath, and to study nothing but Judgment and Damnation, then you might justly fear such an issue. But its Heaven and not Hell, that I would perswade you to walk in; its Joy and not Sorrow, that I perswade you to exercise. I would urge you to look upon no deformed object, but onely upon the ravishing glory of Saints, and the unspeakable excellencies of the God of glory, and the beams that stream from the face of his Son. Are these such sadding, and madding thoughts? will it distract a man to think of his onely happiness? will it distract the miserable to think of mercy? or the captive and prisoner, to fore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>s<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="2 letters">

Neither do I perswade your thoughts to matters of great difficulty, or to study thorny and knotty controversies of Heaven, or to search out things beyond your reach: If you should thus set your wit and invention upon the Tenters, you might be quickly distracted or distempered indeed. But it is your Affections, more then your wits and inventions, that must be used
<pb n="696" facs="tcp:61132:395"/>
in this heavenly employment we speak of: They are Truths which are commonly known and professed, which your souls must draw forth and feed upon. The Resurrection of the body, and the Life everlasting, are Articles of your Creed, and not nicer controver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sies. Me thinks it should be liker to make a man mad, to think of living in a world of wo, to think of abiding in poverty and sick<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness, among the rage of wicked men, then to think of living with Christ in bliss: Me thinks, if we be not mad already, it should sooner distract us, to hear the Tempests and roaring Waves, to see the Billows, and Rocks, and Sands, and Gulfs, then to think of arriving safe at Rest. But Wisdom is justified of all her children; Knowledg hath no enemy,<note place="margin">Matth 11.19. Luke 7.35.</note> but the ignorant. This heavenly course was never spoke against by any, but those that never either knew it or used it.

I now proceed to direct you in the work; where I shall first shew you how you must set upon it; and second<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, how you must behave your self in it; and thirdly, how you
<pb n="697" facs="tcp:61132:395" rendition="simple:additions"/>
shall shut it up. And here I suppose thee to be a man that dost conscionably avoyd the forementioned hinderances, and consci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>onably use the forementioned helps, or else it is in vain to set thee a higher lesson, till thou hast first learned that: Which if thou have done, I then further advise thee: First, Somewhat concerning the time and season; secondly, somewhat concerning the place; and thirdly, somewhat concerning the frame of thy Spirit.</p>
                        <p>And first for the time, I advise thee, that as much as may be, it may be set and constant. Proportion out such a part of thy time to the work.</p>
                        <p>Stick not at their scruple, who question the stating of times as superstitious: If thou suit out thy time to the advantage of the work, and place no more Religion in the time it self, thou needest not to fear lest this be superstition. As a workman in his shop will have a set place for every one of his Tools and Wares, or else when he should use it, it may be to seek: So a Christian should have a set time for every ordinary duty, or else when he should practise it, its ten to one but he will be put by it. Stated time is a hedg to duty, and defends it against many temptations to omission. God hath stated none but the Lords day himself, but he hath left it to be stated, and determined by our selves, according to every mans condition and occasions, least otherwise his Law should have been a burden, or a snare. Yet hath he left us general rules, which by the use of Reason, and Christian Prudence, may help us to determine of the fittest times. Its as ridiculous a question of them that ask us, [Where Scripture commands us to pray so oft, or at such hours, privately or in families?] as if they askt, [Where the Scripture commands, that the Church-House, (or Temple) stand in such a place? or the Pulpit in such a place? or my seat in such a place? or where it commands a man to read the Scriptures with a pair of Spectacles, <hi>&amp;c.</hi>] Most that I have known to break this bond of duty, and to argue against a stated time, have at last grown careless of the duty it self, and shewed more dislike against the work, then the time. If God give me so much money or wealth, and tell me not in Scripture, how much such a poor man must have, nor how much my family, nor how much in cloaths, and how much in ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pences; is it not lawful, yea and necessary that I make the divi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sion my self, and allow to each the due proportion? So if God do bestow on me a day or a week of time, and give me such and
<pb n="698" facs="tcp:61132:396"/>
such work, to do in this time, and tell me not how much I shal allot to each work; Certainly, I must make the division my self, and cut my coat according to my cloth, and proportion it wisely and carefully too, or else I am like to leave something undone. Though God hath not told you, at what hour you shall rise in the morning, or what hours you shall eat and drink, yet your own Reason, and experience will tell you, that ordinarily you should observe a stated time. Neither let the fear of customariness and formality deter you from this. That Argument hath brought the Lords Supper from once a week to once a quarter, or once a yeer; and it hath brought family-duties with too many of late, from twice a day to once a week, or once a moneth; and if it were not, that man being proud, is naturally of a Teaching humor, and addicted to works of popularity and ostentation, I beleeve it would dimin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ish Preaching as much: And will it deal any better with secret duties? especially this of Holy Meditation? I advise thee there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore, if well thou maist, to allow this duty a stated time, and be as constant in it, as in Hearing and Praying: Yet be cautious in un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derstanding this. I know this will not prove every mans duty; some have not themselves, and their time at command, and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore cannot set their hours; such are most servants, and many chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren of poor or carnal parents; and many are so poor, that the ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cessity of their Families wil deny them this freedom. I do not think it the duty of such, to leave their labors for this work, at certain set times, no nor for Prayer, or other necessary worship: No such duty is at all times a duty, Affirmatives specially. Positives binde not <hi>semper &amp; ad semper.</hi> When two duties come together, and cannot both be performed, it were then a sin to perform the lesser. Of two duties we must chuse the greater, though of two sins we must chuse neither. I think such persons were best to be watchful, to redeem time as much as they can, and take their vacant oppor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tunities as they fall, and especially to joyn Meditation and Prayer, as much as they can, with the very labors of their callings. There is no such enmity between laboring and meditating, or praying in the Spirit, but that both may conveniently be done together<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> Yet I say (as <hi>Paul</hi> in another case) if thou canst be free, use it ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther: Those that have more time a spare from worldly necessaries, and are Masters to dispose of themselves, and their time, I still ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vise, That they keep this duty to a stated time. And indeed, it
<pb n="699" facs="tcp:61132:396" rendition="simple:additions"/>
were no ill husbandry, nor point of folly, if we did so by all other duties: If we considered of the ordinary works of the day, and <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="2 letters">
                              <desc>••</desc>
                           </gap>ited out a fit season, and proportion of time to every work, and fixed this in our memory and resolution, or wrote it in a Table, and kept in our Closets, and never brake it, but upon unexpected, or extraordinary cause. If every work of the day, had thus its ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pointed time, we should be better skilled, both in redeeming time, and performing duty.</p>

                        </head>
                        <p n="2">2. I Advise thee also, concerning thy time for this duty, That as it be stated, so it be frequent; Just how oft it should be, I cannot determine, because mens several conditions may vary it: But in general,<note place="margin">Psal. 1.2. and 119.97. and 148.99.</note> that it be frequent the Scripture requireth, when it mentioneth meditating continually, and day and night. Circum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stances of our condition, may much vary the circumstances of our duties. It may be one mans duty to hear or pray oftner then an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>others; and so it may be in this Meditation. But for those that can conveniently omit other business, I advise, That it be once a day at least. Though Scripture tell us not, how oft in a day we should eat or drink, yet prudence and experience will direct us, to twice or thrice a day, according to the temper and necessities of our bodies. Those that think they should not tie themselves to order or number of duties, but should then onely meditate or pray, when they finde the Spirit provoking them to it, do go upon uncertain and unchristian grounds. I am sure, the Scripture provokes us to frequency, and our necessity secondeth the voice of Scripture; and if through my own neglect, or resistance of the Spirit, I do not finde it so to excite and quicken me, I dare not therefore dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>obey the Scripture, nor neglect the necessities of my own soul <note n="*" place="margin">In the same sense as <hi>Justin Martyr</hi> said, He would not beleeve Christ himself, if he had preached any other God, besides him who is the Creator of all; so may I say, I would not be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leeve the Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit, that should take me off my duty and obedience to God. <hi>Vid. Nicephor. Ec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cles. histor. tom.</hi> 1. <hi>lib.</hi> 4. <hi>cap.</hi> 6.</note>. I should suspect that Spirit which would turn my soul from con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stancy in duty; if the Spirit in Scripture bid me meditate or pray. I dare not forbear it, because I finde not the Spirit within me, to second the command: if I finde not incitation to duty before, yet I may finde assistance, while I wait in performance. I am afraid of laying my corruptions upon the Spirit, or blaming the want of the Spirits assistance, when I should blame the backwardness of my own heart; nor dare I make one corruption a plea for
<pb n="700" facs="tcp:61132:397"/>
another; nor urge the inward rebellion of my Nature, as a Reason for the outward disobedience of my life: And for the healing of my natures backwardness, I more expect, that the Spirit of Christ should do it in a way of duty, (which I still finde to be his ordinary season of working) then in a way of disobedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence, and neglect of duty. Men that fall on duty according to the frame of their spirits onely, are like our ignorant vulgar, (or if you will, like the Swine) who think their appetite should be the onely rule of their eating: When a wise man judgeth both of quantitie and qualitie, by Reason and Experience; least when his appetite is depraved, he should either surfet or famish. Our Appetite is no sure rule for our times of duty, but the Word of God in general, and our Spiritual Reason, Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perience, Necessitie, and convenience in particular, may truly direct us.</p>
                        <p>Three Reasons especially should perswade thee to frequency in this Meditation on Heaven.</p>
                        <p n="1">1. Because seldom conversing with him will breed a strangeness betwixt thy soul and God: Frequent society breeds familiarity, and familiarity increaseth love and delight, and maketh us bold and confident in our addresses. This is the main end of this duty, that thou maist have acquaintance and fellowship with God there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in. Therefore if thou come but seldom to it, thou wilt keep thy self a stranger still, and so miss of the end of the work. O, when a man feels his need of God, and must seek his help in a time of necessity, when nothing else can do him any good, you would little think what an encouragement it is, to go to a God that we know, and are acquainted with. O, saith the heavenly Christian, I know both whither I go, and to whom; I have gone this way many a time before now: It is the same God that I daily conversed with; it is the same way that was my daily walk: God knows me well enough, and I have some knowledg of him. On the other side, What a horror and discouragement to the soul it will be, when it is forced to flie to God in streights, to think: Alas, I know not whither to go; I never went the way before; I have no acquaint<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance at the Court of Heaven: My soul knows not that God, that I must speak to; and I fear he will not know my soul! But especially when we come to die, and must immediately appear be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore this God, and expect to enter into this Eternal Rest, then the
<pb n="701" facs="tcp:61132:397" rendition="simple:additions"/>
difference will plainly appear: Then what a joy will it be to think, I am going to the place that I daily conversed in; to the place from whence I tasted so frequent delights; to that God whom I have met in my Meditations so oft. My heart hath been at Heaven before now, and tasted the sweetness that hath oft revived it; and (as <hi>Jonathan</hi> by his honey) if mine eyes were so illightened,<note place="margin">1 Sam. 14.29.</note> and my minde refreshed, when I tasted but a little of that sweetness, what will it be when I shall feed on it freely? On the other side, what a terror must it be to think, I must die, and go I know not whi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther; from a place where I am acquainted, to a place where I have no familiarity, or knowledg. O, Sirs, it is an unexpressible horror to a dying man, to have strange thoughts of God and Heaven: I am perswaded there is no cause so common, that makes death even to godly men unwelcome and uncomfortable. Therefore I per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>swade thee to frequency in this duty, That seldomness breed not estrangedness from God.</p>
                        <p n="2">2. And besides that, seldomness will make thee unskilful in the work, and strange to the duty, as well as to God. How un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>handsomly and clumsily do men set their hands to a work that they are seldom imployed in! Whereas frequency will habituate thy heart to the work, and thou wilt better know the way which thou daily walkest; yea, and it will be more easie and delightful also: The Hill which made thee pant and blow at the first going up, thou maist run up easily when thou art once accustomed to it. The heart which of it self, is naturally backward, will contract a greater unwillingness through disuse: And as an untamed Colt not used to the hand, it will hardly come to hand, when thou shouldst use it.</p>
                        <p n="3">3. And lastly, Thou wilt lose that heat and life by long in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>termissions, which with much ado thou didst obtain in duty. If thou eat but a meal in two or three days, thou wilt lose thy strength as fast as thou gettest it; if in holy Meditation thou get neer to Christ, and warm thy heart with the fire of Love; if thou then turn away, and come but seldom, thou wilt soon return to thy former coldness. If thou walk or labor, till thou hast got thee heat, and then sit idle all day after, wilt thou not surely lose thy heat again? especially, it being so spiritual a work, and so against the bent of nature, we shall be still inclining to our natural temper.</p>
                        <p>
                           <pb n="702" facs="tcp:61132:398"/>If water that is heated be long from the fire, it will return to its coldness, because that is its natural temper. I advise thee there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore that thou be as oft as may be in this soul-raising duty, least when thou hast long rowed hard, against the stream or tide, and winde, the boat should go further down by thy intermission, then it was got up by all thy labor; And least when thou hast been long rolling thy stony heart towards the top of the hill, it should go faster down when thou dost slack thy diligence. Its true, the inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mixed use of other duties, may do much to the keeping thy heart above, especially secret prayer; but Meditation is the life of most other duties: and the veiws of heaven is the Life of Medi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation.</p>

                        <p n="3">3. COncerning the Time of this duty, I advise thee that thou chuse the most seasonable Time. All things are beautiful and excellent in their season. Unseasonableness may lose thee the fruit of thy labor; It may rise up disturbances and difficulties in the work; Yea it may turn a duty to a sin: when the seasonable<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness of a duty doth make it easie, doth remove impediments, doth embolden us to the undertaking, and doth ripen its fruit.</p>
                        <p>The seasons of this duty are either first, extraordinary or secondly, ordinary.</p>
                        <p n="1">1. The ordinary season for your daily performance, cannot be particularly determined by man: Otherwise God would have de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>termined it in his word; But mens conditions of imployment, and freedom, and bodily temper are so various, that the same may be a seasonable hour to one, which may be unseasonable to another. If thou be a servant, or a hard laborer, that thou hast not thy self, nor thy time at command, thou must take that season which thy business will best afford thee: Either as thou sittest in the shop at thy work, or as thou travellest on the way, or as thou lyest waking in the night. Every man best knows his own time, even when he hath least to hinder him of his business in the world. But for those whose necessities tye them not so close, but that they may well lay aside their earthly affaires, and chuse what time of the day they will, My advice to such is, that they carefully observe the temper
<pb n="703" facs="tcp:61132:398" rendition="simple:additions"/>
of their body and minde, and mark when they finde their spirits most active, and fit for contemplation, and pitch upon that as the stated time. Some men are freest for all duties when they are fasting, and some are then unfittest of all. Some are fit for duties of humiliation at one season and for duties of exaltation at ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther. Every man is the meetest judg for himself. Only give me leave to tender you my observation, which time I have alway found fittest for my self,<note place="margin">☜</note> and that is, The evening, from Sun setting to the twilight: and sometime in the night when it is warm and clear. Whether it be any thing from the temperature of my body, I know not: But I conjecture that the same time would be seasonable to most tempers; for several natural reasons, which I will not now stand to mention. Neither would I have mentioned my own ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perience in this, but that I was encouraged hereunto by finding it suit with the experience of a better and wiser man then my self, and that is <hi>Isaac:</hi> for it is said in <hi>Gen.</hi> 24.63. <hi>That he went to Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ditate in the field at the eventide:</hi> and his experience I dare more boldly recommend unto you then my own. And as I remember Doctor <hi>Hall</hi> in his excellent Treatise of Meditation, gives you the like account of his own experience.</p>
                     </div>
                     <div n="4" type="section">

                        <p n="2">2. THe Lords day is a time exceeding seasonable for this exer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cise. When should we more seasonably contemplate on Rest, then on that day of Rest which doth typ<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                              <desc>•</desc>
                           </gap>fie it to us? Nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther do I think that typifying use is ceased, because the Antitype is not fully yet come. However it being a day appropriated to Worship and spiritual duties, me thinks we should never exclude this duty which is so eminently spiritual. I think verily this is the chiefest work of a Christian Sabbath, and most agreeable to the intent of its positive institution. What fitter time to converse with our Lord, then on that day, which he hath appropriated to such imployment,<note place="margin">Rev. 1.10.</note> and therefore called it, <hi>The Lords Day</hi>? What fitter day to ascend to heaven, then that on which our Lord did a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rise from earth, and fully triumph over death and hell, and take possession of Heaven before us? The fittest temper for a true be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liever, is to be in the spirit on the Lords Day: This was Saint <hi>Johns</hi>
                           <pb n="704" facs="tcp:61132:399"/>
temper on that day. And what can bring us to this ravishment in the spirit, but the spiritual beholding of our ravishing glory? Surely though an outward ordinance may delight the ear, or tickle the fancy, yet it is the viewes of God that must ravish the soul. There is a great deal of difference betwixt the receiving of the word with joy, <hi>Mat.</hi> 13.20. and being in the spirit on the Lords Day, <hi>Rev.</hi> 1 10.</p>
                        <p>Two sorts of Christians I would entreat to take notice of this especially.</p>
                        <p n="1">1. Those that spend the Lords day only in publique worship; either through the neglect of this spiritual duty of Meditation, or else by their overmuch exercise of the publique, allowing no time to private duty: Though there be few that offend in this last kinde, yet some there are, and a hurtful mistake to the soul it is. They will grow but in gifts, and common accomplishments<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> if they exercise but their gifts in outward performances.</p>
                        <p n="2">2. Those that have time on the Lords day, for idleness, and vain discourse; and finde the day longer then they know how well to spend: Were these but acquainted with this duty of contempla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, they would need no other recreation nor pastime; they would think the longest day short enough, and be sorry that the night hath shortned their pleasure.</p>
                        <p>Whether this day be of positive Divine Institution, and so to us Christians of necessary observation, is out of my way to handle here: I refer those that doubt, to what is in Print on that subject, especially Master <hi>George Abbot</hi> against <hi>Broad,</hi> and (above all) Master <hi>Cawdrey</hi> and Master <hi>Palmer</hi> their <hi>Sabbatum Redivivum.</hi> Its an encouragment to the doubtful, to finde the generality of its rati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>onal opposers, to acknowledg the usefulness, yea necessity of a stat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed day, and the fitness of this above all other days. I would I could perswade those that are convinced of its morality, to spend a greater part of it in this true spirituality. But we do in this as in most things else; think it enough that we believe our duty, as we do the articles of our faith, and let who will put it in practice. VVe will dispute for duty, and let others perform it: As I have known some drunkards upon the Ale bench will plead for godly men, while themselves are ungodly: So do too many for the observa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of the Lords day, who themselves are unacquainted with this spiritual part of its observation. Christians, let heaven have some
<pb n="705" facs="tcp:61132:399" rendition="simple:additions"/>
more share in your Sabbaths, where you must shortly keep your everlasting Sabbath. As you go from stair to stair till you come to the top, so use your Sabbaths as steps to glory, till you have pass<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed them all, and are there arived. Especially you that are poor men, and servants, that cannot take time in the week as you de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sire, see that you well improve this day: Now your labor lies not <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                              <desc>•</desc>
                           </gap>o much upon you, now you are unyoaked from your common business; Be sure as your bodyes Rest from their labors, that your spirits seek after Rest with God. I admonish also those that are possessed with the censorious divel, that if they see a poor Christian walking privately in the fields on the Lords Day, they would not Pharisaically conclude him a Sabbath breaker, till they know more: It may be he takes it as the opportunest place, to withdraw himself from the world to God; Thou seest where his body walkes, but thou seest not where he is walking in the spirit. <hi>Hannah</hi> was censured for a woman drunk, till <hi>Eli</hi> heard her speak for her self; and when he knew the truth, he was ashamed of his censure. The silent spiritual worshipper is most lyable to their censure, because he gives not the world an account of his worship.</p>
                        <p>Thus I have directed thee to the fittest season for the ordinary performance of this heavenly work.</p>

When God doth extraordinarily revive and enable thy spirit. When God hath kindled thy spirit with fire from above, it is that it may mount aloft more freely. It is a choice part of a Christians skill, to observe the temper of his own spirit, and to observe the gales of grace, and how the spirit of Christ doth move upon his.

VVhen should we take our cordials but in our times of fainting? When is it more seasonable to walk to heaven, then when we know not in what corner on earth to live with comfort? or when should our thoughts converse above, but when they have nothing but grief to converse with below? Where should. <hi>Noahs</hi> Dove be but in the Arke,<note place="margin">Gen. 8.8, 9.</note> when the waters do cover all the earth; and she cannot finde Rest for the sole of her foot? What should we think on but our fathers house, when we want even the husks of the world to feed on? Surely God sends thee thy afflictions to this very pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pose. Happy thou poor man, if thou make this use of thy poverty: and thou that art sick, if thou so improve thy sickness. It is seasonable to go to the Promised Land, when our burdens and taskes are in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>creased in Egypt; and when we endure the dolors of a greivous wilderness. Believe it, Reader, if thou knewest but what a cordial in thy griefs and care, the serious views of glory are, thou wouldst less fear these harmles troubles, and more use that preserving revi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving Remedy: I would not have thee, as Mountebanks, take poy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son first, and then their Antidote to shew its power; so to create thy affliction to try this remedy: But if God reach thee forth the bitterest cup, drop in but a little of the Tastes of Heaven, and I

warrant thee it will sufficiently sweeten it to thy spirit; If the case thou art in, seem never so dangerous, take but a little of this An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tidote of Rest, and never fear the pain or danger. I will give thee to confirm this, but the Example of <hi>David,</hi> and the Opinion of <hi>Paul,</hi> and desire thee throughly to consider of both. <hi>In the multi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tude of my thoughts within me</hi> (saith <hi>David</hi>) <hi>thy comforts delight my soul, Psal.</hi> 94.19. As if he should say, I have multitudes of sadding thoughts that crowd upon me, thoughts of my sins, and thoughts of my foes, thoughts of my dangers, and thoughts of my pains; yet in the midst of all this crowd, one serious thought of the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>forts of thy Love, and especially of the comfortable life in Glory, doth so dispel the throng, and scatter my cares, and disperse the clouds that my troubles had raised, that they do even revive and delight my soul.

when Flesh is raising fears and terrors? Surely no men have greater need of supporting joyes, then dying men; and those joyes must be fetcht from our eternal joy. Men that have earthly pleasures in their hands, may think they are well, though they taste no more, but when a man is dying and parting with all other pleasures, he must then fetch his pleasure from Heaven, or have none; when health is gone, and friends lye weeping about our beds, when houses, and lands, and goods, and wealth cannot afford us the least relief, but we are taking our leave of earth for ever, except a hole for our bodies to rot in; when we are daily expecting our final day, its now time to look to heaven, and to fetch in comfort and support from thence; and as heavenly delights are sweetest, when they are unmixed and pure, and have no earthly delights conjoyned with them, so therefore the delights of dying Christians are oft<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times the sweetest that ever they had: Therefore have the Saints been generally observed to be then most Heavenly when they were neerest dying; what a Prophetical blessing hath <hi>Jacob</hi> for his sons, when he lay a dying?

How doth he minde them of the Mansions in his Fathers House? and remember them of his coming again to fetch them thither? and open the union they shall have with him, and with each other? and promise them to be with him to behold his Glory?

It is the general temper of the spirits of the Saints, to be then most Heavenly when they are neerest to Heaven. As we use to say of the old and the weak, that they have one foot in the grave already, so may we say of the godly, when they are neer their Rest, they have one foot (as it were) in Heaven already; When should a Traveller look homewards with joy, but when he is come within the sight of his home? Its true, the pains of our bodies, and the fainting of our spirits may somewhat abate the liveliness of our joy, but the mea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sure we have, will be the more pure and spiritual, by how much the less it is kindled from the Flesh.

That as the pulling down of one end of the ballance is the lifting up of the other, so the pulling down of our bodies might be the lifting up of our souls! that as our souls were usually at the worst when our bodies were at the best, so now they might be at the best when our bodies are at the worst<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> why should we not think thus with our selves? why every one of these gripes that I feel are but the cutting of the stitches for the ripping off mine old attire, that God may cloathe me with the glory of his Saints; Had I rather live in these rotten raggs, then be at the trouble and pains to shift me? Should the Infant desire to stay in the womb, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause of the straitness and pains of the passage? or because he knows not the world that he is to come into? nor is acquainted with the fashions or inhabitants thereof?

And why should the present feeling of these dolors so much diminish the foretasts of Glory, when the remembrance of them will then increase it? All these
<pb n="710" facs="tcp:61132:402"/>
gripes and woes that I feel, are but the farewell of sin and sorrows: As Nature useth to struggle hard a little before death, and as the devil cast the man to the ground and tore him, when he was going out of him, <hi>Mark</hi> 9.26. so this tearing and troubling which I now feel, is but at the departure of sin and misery; for as the effects of Grace are sweetest at last, so the effects of sin are bitterest at the last, and this is the last that ever I shall taste of it: when once this whirlwind and earthquake is past, the still voyce will next succeed; and God onely will be in the voyce, though sin also was in the earthquake and whirlwinde.</p>
                        <p>Thus Christian, as every pang of sickness should minde the wicked of their eternal pangs, and make them look into the bottom of hell, so should all thy wo and weakness minde thee of thy neer ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proaching joy, and make thee look as high as heaven: and (as a Ball) the harder thou art smitten down to earth; the higher shouldst thou rebound up to heaven. If this be thy case who readest these lines, (and if it be not now, it will be shortly) if thou lye in consuming painful sickness, if thou perceive thy dying time draw on, O where should thy heart be now but with Christ? Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thinks thou shouldst even behold him, as is were, standing by thee, and shouldst bespeak him as thy Father, thy Husband, thy Physiti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>an, thy Friend! Methinks thou shouldst even see, as it were, the Angels about thee waiting to perform their last office to thy soul, as thy friends wait to perform theirs to thy body; Those Angels which disdained not to bring the soul of a scabbed Begger to heaven, will not think much to conduct thee thither. O look upon thy sickness, as <hi>Jacob</hi> did on <hi>Josephs</hi> Chariots, and let thy spirit revive within thee, and say, It is enough, that <hi>Joseph,</hi> that Christ, is yet alive, for because he lives I shall live also, <hi>Joh.</hi> 14.19. As thou art sick and needest the daintiest food, and choicest Cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dials, so here are choices then the world affords, here is the food of Angels and glorified Saints; here is all the joyes that heaven doth yield, even the Vision of God, the sight of Christ, and what<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>soever the blessed there possess; This Table is spread for thee to feed on in thy sickness, these dainties are offered thee by the hand of Christ: He hath written thee the Receipt in the Promises of the Gospel, He hath prepared thee all the ingredients in Heaven, onely put forth the hand of Faith, and feed upon them, and rejoyce &amp; live; The Lord saith to thee, as he did to <hi>Elias, Arise and eat, because

                        <p>So you have seen which is the fittest season for this duty:<note place="margin">Read Master <hi>Symmonds Deserted soul. p.</hi> 225, 226, 227.</note> I should here advise thee also of some times unseasonable; but I shall onely add this one Caution; The unseasonable urging of the most spiritual duty, is more from the Tempter then from the Spirit of God: When Satan sees a Christian in a condition wherein he is unable and unfit for a duty, or wherein he may have more advan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tage against us by our performance of it, then by our omitting it, he will then drive on as earnestly to duty, as if it were the very spirit of Holiness: that so upon our omitting or ill performance, he may have somewhat to cast in our teeth and to trouble us with. And this is one of his wayes of deceiving, when he transformes himself into an Angel of Light. It may be when thou art on thy knees in prayer, thou shalt have many good thoughts will come into thy minde: or when thou art hearing the word, or at such un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>seasonable times: Resist these good thoughts as coming from the devil, for they are formally evil, though they are materially good; Even good thoughts in themselves may be sinful to thee. It may be when thou shouldst be diligent in thy necessary la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bors, thou shalt be moved to cast aside all, that thou mayest go to Meditation or to Prayer; These motions are usually from the spirit of delusion: The spirit of Christ doth nothing unseasonably: God is not the God of confusion but of order.</p>

Yet the prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cipal secrecie and silence must be in the soul within, rather then without: that is, that the soul shut out of it self all humane worldly cares; all vaine and hurtful thoughts, and whatsoever may hinder it from reaching to the end which it doth intend. For it oft falls out that a man is alone, separated from the company of men, and yet by fantasies, thoughts, and melancholies doth suffer the most grievous and burdensome company in himself: Which fantasies do beget him various tumults and conferences and pratlings; bringing before the eyes of his understanding sometime one thing, sometime another: leading him sometime into the Kitchin, sometime into the Market; bringing thence to him the unclean delights of the flesh; shewing him dances, and beauties, and songs, and such kinde of vanities drawing to sin. As Saint <hi>Jerom</hi> humbly confesseth of himself, That when he was in the wilderness without any compa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny save wild beasts and Scorpions, yet he was often in his thoughts in dances and in the company of the Ladyes at Rome. So these fantasies will make the soul even when it is alone to be angry and quarrel with some one that is absent, as if he were present: To be counting money; It will pass over the seas, it will fly abroad the land, sometime it will be in high dignities, and so of in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>numerable fancies the like: such a soul is not secret nor alone; Nor is a devout soul in contem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plation alone, For it is never lesse alone. It is in the best company, even with God and Saints by holy desires and cogitations. <hi>Gerson. par.</hi> 3. <hi>fol</hi> 382. <hi>De monte contemplationis cap.</hi> 23.</note> Christ himself thought it not vain to direct in this cir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cumstance of private duty, <hi>Mat.</hi> 6.4, 6, 18, If in private prayer we must shut our door upon us, that our Father may hear us in secret; so is it also requisite in this Meditation. How oft doth Christ himself depart to some mountain, or wilderness, or other so<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>litary place? For occasional Meditation I give thee not this advise, but for this daily set and solemn duty, I advise, that thou withdraw thy self from all society, yea though it were the society of godly men, that thou mayest a while enjoy the society of Christ: If a student cannot study in a crowd, who exerciseth only his invention and memory, much lesse when thou must exercise all the powers of thy soul, and that upon an object so far above nature: When thy
<pb n="713" facs="tcp:61132:403" rendition="simple:additions"/>
eyes are filled with the persons and actions of men, and thine ears with their discourse; its hard then to have thy thoughts and affecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons free for this duty. Though I would not perswade thee to <hi>Pythagoras</hi> his Cave, nor to the Hermets Wilderness, nor to the Monks Cell; yet I would advise thee to frequent solitariness, that thou mayest sometimes confer with Christ and with thy self, as well as with others. We are fled so far from the solitude of superstition, that we have cast off the solitude of contemplative devotion. Friends use to converse most familiarly in private, and to open their Secrets, and let out their affections most freely. Publike con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verse is but common converse. Use therefore (as Christ himself did, <hi>Mark</hi> 1.35.) to depart sometimes into a solitary place, that thou maist be wholly vacant for this great employment. See <hi>Mat.</hi> 14.23. <hi>Mark</hi> 6.47. <hi>Luke</hi> 9.18<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> 36. <hi>John</hi> 6.15, 16. We seldom read of Gods appearing by himself, or his Angels, to any of his Prophets or Saints in a throng; but frequently when they were alone.</p>
                        <p>And as I advise thee to a place of retiredness; so also that thou observe more particularly, what place and posture best agreeth with thy spirit: Whether within doors, or without; whether sit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing still, or walking. I beleeve <hi>Isaacs</hi> example in this also, will di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rect us to the place and posture, which will best suit with most, as it doth with me, <hi>viz.</hi> His walking forth to meditate in the field at the eventide. And Christs own example in the places forecited; gives us the like direction. Christ was used to a solitary Garden, that even <hi>Judas</hi> when he came to betray him, knew where to finde him, <hi>John</hi> 18.1, 2. And though he took his Disciples thither with him, yet did he separate himself from them for more Secret de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>votions, <hi>Luke</hi> 22.41. And though his meditation be not directly named but onely his praying yet it is very clearly implied, <hi>Matth.</hi> 26.38, 39. His soul is first made sorrowful with the bitter medita<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions on his death and sufferings, and then he poureth it out in prayer, <hi>Mark</hi> 14.34. So that Christ had his accustomed place, and consequently accustomed duty, and so must we: Christ hath a place that is solitary, whither he retireth himself even from his own Disciples, and so must we: Christs meditations do go further then his thought; they affect, and p<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                           </gap>erce his heart and soul, and so must ours. Onely there is a wide difference in the object: Christ meditates on the suffering that our sins had deserved, that the wrath
<pb n="714" facs="tcp:61132:404"/>
of his Father even passed through his thoughts upon all his soul; But the meditation that we speak of, is on the glory he hath pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chased; that the love of the Father, and the joy of the Spirit, might enter at our thoughts, and revive our affections, and over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flow our souls. So that as Christs meditation was the sluce or flood<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gate, to let in Hell to overflow his Affections: so our meditation should be the sluce to let in Heaven into our affections.</p>

                        <p>SO much concerning the Time and Place of this duty. I am next to advise thee somewhat concerning the preparations of thy heart. The success of the work doth much depend on the frame of thy heart. When mans heart had nothing in it that might grieve the Spirit, then was it the delightful habitation of his Maker. God did not quit his residence there, till man did expel him by unworthy provocations. There grew no strangeness, till the heart grew sinful, and too loathsom a dungeon for God to delight in. And were this soul reduced to its former innocency, God would quickly return to his former habitation; yea, so far as it is renewed and repaired by the Spirit, and purged of its lusts, and beautified with his Image; the Lord will yet acknowledg it his own, and Christ will manifest himself unto it, and the Spirit will take it for his Temple, and Residence. So far as the soul is qualified for con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>versing with God, so far it doth actually (for the most part) enjoy him. Therefore with all diligence keep thy heart; for from thence are the issues of life, <hi>Prov</hi> 4.23.</p>
                        <p>More particularly, when thou fettest on this duty, First, Get thy heart as clear from the world as thou canst; wholly lay by the thoughts of thy business, of thy troubles, of thy enjoyments, and of every thing that may take up any room in thy soul. Get thy soul as empty as possibly thou canst, that so it may be the more capable of being filled with God. It is a work (as I have said) that will require all the powers of thy soul, if they were a thousand times more capacious and active then they are; and therefore you have need to lay by all other thoughts and affections, while you are busied here. If thou couldst well perform some outward duty with a piece of thy heart, while the other is absent, yet this above
<pb n="715" facs="tcp:61132:404"/>
all I am sure thou canst not. Surely, if thou once address thy self to the business indeed, thou wilt be as the covetous man at the heap of Gold; that when he might take as much as he could carry away, lamented that he was able to bear no more: So when thou shalt get into the Mount in contemplation, thou wilt finde there, as much of God and Glory, as thy narrow heart is able to contain; and almost nothing to hinder thy full possession, but onely the uncapableness of thy own Spirit. O then (wilt thou think) that this understanding were larger, that I might conceive more! that these affections were wider to contain more! it is more my own unfitness, then any thing else, which is the cause, that even this place is not my Heaven! God is in this place, and I know it not. This Mount is full of the Angels of God, but mine eyes are shut and cannot see them. O the words of love that Christ hath to speak! O the wonders of love that he hath to shew! But, alas, I cannot bear them yet! Heaven is here ready at hand for me, but my un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>capable heart is unready for Heaven! Thus wouldst thou lament, that the deadness of thy heart doth hinder thy joyes; even as a sick man is sorry that he wants a stomack, when he sees a feast be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore him.</p>
                        <p>Therefore, Reader, seeing it is much in the capacity, and frame of thy heart, how much thou shalt enjoy of God in this con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>templation; be sure that all the room thou hast be empty: and (if ever) seek him here with all thy soul: Thrust no<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                           </gap> Christ into the stable, and the manger, as if thou hadst better guests for the chiefest rooms. Say to all thy worldly business and thoughts, as Christ to his Disciples, <hi>Sit you here, while I go and pray yonder, Matth.</hi> 26.36. Or as <hi>Abraham</hi> when he went to sacrifice <hi>Isaac,</hi> left his servants and Ass below the Mount, saying, <hi>Stay you here, and I and the Lad, will go yonder and worship, and come again to you:</hi> So say thou to all thy worldly thoughts, Abide you below, while I go up to Christ, and then I will return to you again. Yea, as God did terrifie the people with his threats of death, if any one should dare to come to the Mount, when <hi>Moses</hi> was to receive the Law from God; so do thou terrifie thy own heart, and use violence against thy intruding thoughts, if they offer to accompany thee to the Mount of Contemplation. Even as the Priests thrust <hi>Vzziah</hi> the King out of the Temple, where he presumed to burn incense, when they saw the Leprosie to arise upon him; so do thou thrust
<pb n="716" facs="tcp:61132:405"/>
these thoughts from the Temple of thy heart, which have the badg of Gods prohibition upon them. As you will beat back your dogs, yea, and leave your servants behinde you, when your selves are ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitted into the Princes presence; so also do by these. Your selves may be welcome, but such followers may not.</p>

                        <p n="2">2. BE sure thou set upon this work, with the greatest seriousness that possibly thou canst. Customariness here, is a killing sin. There is no trifling in holy things; God will be sanctified of all that draw neer him. These spiritual, excellent, soul-raising duties, are the most dangerous, if we miscarry in them, of all. The more they advance the soul, being well used, the more they destroy it, being used unfaithfully: As the best meats corrupted, are the worst. To help thee therefore to be serious when thou settest on this work; First, Labor to have the deepest apprehensions of the pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sence of God, and of the incomprehensible Greatness of the Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jesty which thou approachest. If <hi>Rebecca</hi> vail her face at her ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proach to <hi>Isaac</hi>; if <hi>Esther</hi> must not draw neer, till the King hold forth the Scepter; if dust and worms-meat must have such respect, Think then with what reverence thou shouldst approach thy Maker: think thou art addressing thy self to him, that made the Worlds with the word of his mouth; that upholds the Earth as in the palm of his hand; that keeps the Sun, and Moon, and Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vens in their courses; that bounds the raging Sea with the Sands, and saith,<note place="margin">Jer. 5.22.</note> Hitherto go, and no farther: Thou art going about to converse with him, before whom the Earth will quake, and Devils tremble; before whose bar thou must shortly stand, and all the world with thee, to receive their doom. O think, I shall then have lively apprehensions of his Majesty; my drowsie spirits will then be wakened, and my stupid unreverence be laid aside: Why should I not now be rouzed with the sense of his Greatness, and the dread of his Name possess my soul?</p>
                        <p>Secondly, Labor to apprehend the greatness of the work, which thou attemptest, and to be deeply sensible both of its weight and height; of its concernment and excellency. If thou were pleading for thy life at the bar of a Judg, thou wouldst be serious; and yet that were but a trifle to this: If thou were engaged in such a work
<pb n="717" facs="tcp:61132:405"/>
as <hi>David</hi> was against <hi>Goliah,</hi> whereon the Kingdoms deliverance did depend, in it self considered, it were nothing to this. Suppose thou were going to such a wrestling as <hi>Jacobs</hi>; suppose thou were going to see the sight, which the three Disciples saw in the Mount: How seriously! how reverently wouldst thou both approach and behold? If the Sun do suffer any notable Eclipse, how seriously do all run out to see it? If some Angel from Heaven should but appoint to meet thee, at the same time and place of thy contem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plations, how dreadfully, how apprehensively wouldst thou go to meet him? Why, consider then with what a Spirit thou shouldst meet the Lord; and with what seriousness and dread thou shouldst daily converse with him: When <hi>Manoah</hi> had seen but an Angel, he cryes out, <hi>We shall surely die, because we have seen God,</hi> Judg 13.22.</p>
                        <p>Consider also, the blessed Issue of the work, if it do succeed; it will be an admission of thee into the presence of God, a begin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of thy Eternal Glory on Earth; a means to make thee live above the rate of other men, and admit thee into the next room to the Angels themselves; a means to make thee live and die, both joyfully and blessedly: So that the prize being so great, thy preparations should be answerable. There is none on Earth that live such a life of joy and blessedness, as those that are acquainted with this Heavenly conversation: The joyes of all other men are but like a childes play, a fools laughter, as a dream of health to the sick, or as a fresh pasture to a hungry Beast. It is he that trades at Heaven, that is the onely gainer; and he that neglecteth it, that is the onely loser. And therefore how seriously should this work be done!</p>

                        <p>Mans soul as it receives and retains the <hi>Idea's</hi> or Shapes of things, so hath it a power to chuse out any of these deposited <hi>Idea's,</hi> and draw them forth, and act upon them again and again; even as a Sheep can fetch up his meat for rumination; otherwise nothing would affect us, but while the sense is receiving it, and so we should be somewhat below the Bruits. This is the power that here you must use: To this choice of <hi>Idea's</hi> or subjects for your Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gitation, there must necessarily concur the act of the Will, which indeed must go along in the whole Work; for this must be a vo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>luntary,

And so shall the damned consider of Heaven, and of the excellency of Christ whom they once despised, and of the eternal joyes which they have fool<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ishly lost.

                        <p n="2">2. NExt let us see what force Consideration hath for the mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving of the affections, and for the powerful imprinting of things in the heart.</p>
                        <p>Why, First, Consideration doth, as it were, open the door, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween the Head and the Heart: The Understanding having re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived Truths, layes them up in the Memory, now Consideration is the conveyer of them from thence to the Affections: There's few men of so weak Understanding or Memory, but they know and can remember that which would strangely work upon them, and make great alterations in their spirits, if they were not locked up in their brain, and if they could but convey them down to their hearts: Now this is the great work of Consideration. O what rare men would they be, who have strong heads, and much learning, and knowledge, if the obstructions between the Head and the Heart were but opened! and their Affections did but correspond to their Understandings! why, if they would but bestow as much time and pains in studying the goodness and the evil of things, as they be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stow in studying the Truth and Falshood of Enunciations, it were the readiest way to obtain this; he is usually the best Scholar, who hath the quick, the clear, and the tenacious apprehension; but he is usually the best Christian, who hath the deepest, piercing, and affecting Apprehension: He is the best Scholar who hath the readiest passage from the Ear to the Brain, but he is the best Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stian, who hath the readiest passage from the Brain to the Heart; now Consideration is that on our parts that must open the passage,
<pb n="721" facs="tcp:61132:407"/>
though the Spirit open as the principal cause; inconsiderate men are stupid and senseless.</p>
                     </div>

                        <p n="2">2. MAtters of great weight, which do neerly concern us, are aptest to work most effectually upon the Heart; now Meditation draweth forth these working Objects, and presents them to the Affections in their worth and weight: The most de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lectable Object doth not please him that sees it not, nor doth the joyfullest news affect him that never hears it; now Considera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion presents before us those Objects that were as absent, and brings them to the Eye, and the Ear of the soul: Are not Christ and Glory, think you, affecting Objects? would not they work won<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders upon the soul if they were but clearly discovered? and strange<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly transport us, if our apprehensions were any w<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                           </gap>it answerable to their worth! why, by Consideration it is that they are presented to us. This is the Prospective Glass of the Christian, by which he can see from Earth to Heaven.</p>

                        <p n="3">3. AS Consideration draweth forth the weightiest Objects, so it presenteth them in the most affecting way, and presseth them home with enforcing Arguments. Man is a Rational Creature, and apt to be moved in a Reasoning way, especially when Reasons are evident and strong: Now Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sideration is a reasoning the case with a mans own heart; and what a multitude of Reasons both clear and weighty, are always at hand for to work upon the heart? VVhen a Believer would reason his heart to this heavenly work, how many Arguments do offer themselves? from God, from the Redeemer, from every one of the Divine Attributes, from our former Estate, from our pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sent Estate, from Promises, from Seals, from Earnest, from the Evil we now suffer, from the Good we partake of, from Hell, from Heaven? every thing doth offer it self to promote our joy; now Meditation is the Hand to draw forth all these; as when you are weighing a thing in the Ballance, you lay on a little more, and a little more till it weigh down; so if your Affections do hang in a dull indifferency, why, due Meditation will add Reason after
<pb n="722" facs="tcp:61132:408"/>
Reason till the scales do turn: Or as when you are buying any thing of necessity for your use, you bid a little more and a little more till at last you come to the sellers price: so when Medita<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion is perswading you to Joy, it will first bring one Reason, and then another, till it have silenced all your distrust and sorrows, and your cause to rejoyce lyes plain before you. If another mans reasons will work so powerfully with us, though we are uncertain whether his heart do concur with his speeches, and whether his intention be to inform us or deceive us; how much more should our own Reasons work with us, when we are acquainted with the right in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tentions of our own hearts? Nay how much more rather should Gods Reasons work with us, which we are sure are neither fallaci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons in his intent, nor in themselves? seeing he did never yet de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive, nor was ever deceived? Why now Meditation is but the Reading over and repeating Gods reasons to our hearts, and so disputing with our selves in his Arguments and terms: And is not this then likely to be a prevailing way? What Reasons doth the prodigal plead with himself, why he should return to his fathers house? And as many and strong have we to plead with our affecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, to perswade them to our Fathers Everlasting habitations. And by Consideration it is that they must all be set a work.</p>

                        <p n="4">4. MEditation putteth reason in its Authority and prehemi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nence. It helpeth to deliver it from its captivity to the senses, and setteth it again upon the throne of the soul. When Reason is silent, it is usually subject: For when it is asleep, the senses domineer: Now consideration wakeneth our reason from its sleep; till it rowse up it self as <hi>Sampson,</hi> and break the bonds of sensuality wherewith it is fettered: and then as a Gyant refreshed with wine, it bears down the delusions of the flesh before it. What strength can the Lyon put forth when he is asleep? What is the King more then another man, when he is once deposed from his throne and authority? When men have no better Judg then the flesh; or when the joyes of heaven go no further then their fan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tasie, no wonder if they work but as common things: sweet things to the eye, and beautiful things to the ear, will work no more then bitter and deformed: every thing worketh in its own place,
<pb n="723" facs="tcp:61132:408"/>
and every sense hath its proper object: Now it is spiritual reason excited by Meditation, and not the fantasie or fleshly sense, which must favor and judg of those superior Joyes. Consideration exalt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth the objects of faith, and disgraceth comparatively the objects of sense. The most inconsiderate men are the most sensual men.</p>

                        <p n="5">5. MEditation also putteth reason into his strength. Reason is at the strongest when it is most in action: Now Medi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation produceth reason into Act. Before it was as a standing wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter, which can move nothing else when it self moveth not: but now it is as the speedy stream which violently bears down all be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore it. Before it was as the still and silent air, but now it is as the powerful motion of the wind, and overthrows the opposition of the flesh and the devil. Before it was as the stones which lay still in the brook; but now when Meditation doth set it awork, it is as the stone out of <hi>Davids</hi> sling, which smites the <hi>Goliah</hi> of our un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>belief in the forehead. As wicked men continue wicked, not be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause they have not reason in the principle, but because they bring it not into Act and use, so godly men are uncomfortable and sad, not because they have no causes to rejoyce, nor because they have not reason to discern those causes; but because they let their reas<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on and faith lye asleep, and do not labor to set them a going, nor stir them up to action by this work of Meditation. You know that our very dreams will deeply affect: What fears! What sor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rowes! What Joy will they stir up? How much more then would serious Meditation affect us?</p>

A plaister that is never so effectual to cure, must yet have time to do its work, and not to be taken off as soon as its on. Now Meditation doth hold the plaister to the sore: It holdeth Reason and Faith to their
<pb n="724" facs="tcp:61132:409"/>
work, and bloweth the fire till it throughly burn. To run a few steps will not get a man heat, but walking an hour together may: So though a sudden occasional thought of Heaven, will not raise our affections to any spiritual heat; yet Meditation can continue our thoughts, and lengthen our walk till our hearts grow warm.</p>
                        <p>And thus you see what force Meditation or consideration hath, for the effecting of this great elevation of the soul, whereto I have told you it must be the Instrument.</p>

What affections excited? What considerations of their objects are necessary thereto? and in what order we must proceed? I joyn all these together, because though in themselves they are distinct things, yet in the practice they all concurre to the same Action.</p>
                        <p>The matters of God which we are to think on, have their various qualifications, and are presented to the soul of man in divers rela<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tive and Modal considerations: According to these several consi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derations

of the objects, the soul it self is distinguished into its seve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral faculties, powers, and capacities<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> That as God hath given man five senses to partake of the five distinct excellencies of the ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jects of sense; so he hath diversifyed the soul of man either into faculties, powers or ways of acting, answerable to the various qua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lifications and considerations of himself and the inferior objects of this soul: And as, if there be more sensible excellencies in the creatures, yet they are unknown to us who have but these five senses to discern them by, so whatever other excellencies are in God and our happiness, more then these faculties or powers of the soul can apprehend, must needs remain wholly unknown to us, till our souls have senses (as it were) suitable to those objects. <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 word">

This Truth is sometime known by evident Demonstration, and so it is the object of that we call knowledg (which also admits of divers distinctions according to several ways of demonstration, which I am loth here to puzzle you with) Sometime it is received from the Testimony of others, which receiving we call belief. When any thing else would obscure it, or stands up in competition with it; then we weigh their several evi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dences, and accordingly discover and vindicate the Truth, and this we call Judgment. Sometime by the strength, the clearness, or the frequency of the understandings apprehensions, this Truth doth make a deeper impression, &amp; so is longer retained, which imp<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="2 letters">

                           </gap>ssion and retention we call memory. And as truth is thus variously pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sented to the understanding and received by it; so also is the goodness of the object variously represented to the will, which doth accordingly put forth its various acts. When it appeareth on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly as good in it self, and not good for us, or suitable<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> it is not the object of the will at all; but only this Enuntiation [It is good] is passed upon it by the Judgment, and withal it raiseth an admira<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion at its excellency. If it appeare evil to us, then we Nill it. But if it appear both good in it self, and to us, or suitable, then it pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>voketh
<pb n="726" facs="tcp:61132:410"/>
the affection of Love: If the good thus loved do appear as absent from us, then it exciteth the passion of Desire: If the good so Loved and Desired do appear possible and feasible in the attain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, then it exciteth the passion of Hope, which is a compound of Desire and Expectation; when we look upon it as requiring our endeavor to attain it, and as it is to be had in a prescribed way, then it provokes the passion of courage or boldness, and concludes in resolution. Lastly, if this good be apprehended as present, then it provoketh to delight or Joy: If the thing it self be present, the Joy is greatest: If but the Idea of it (either through the remainder or memory of the good that is past, or through the fore-appre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hension of that which we expect) yet even this also exciteth our Joy. And this Joy is the perfection of all the rest.</p>

                        <p>SO that by this time, I suppose you see, both what are the ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jects that must move our affections, and what powers of the soul apprehend these objects: you see also, I doubt not, what af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fections you must excite, and in what order it is to be done: Yet for your better assistance I will more fully direct you in the several particulars.</p>
                        <p n="1">1. Then, you must by cogitation go to the memory (which is the Magazine or Treasury of the understanding) thence you must take forth those heavenly doctrines, which you intend to make the subject of your Meditation; for the present purpose, you may look over any promise of eternal life in the Gospel, any description of the glory of the Saints, or the very Articles of the Resurrection of the body, and the Life everlasting: some one sentence concern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing those Eternal Joyes, may afford you matter for many yeers Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ditation; yet it will be a point of our wisdom here, to have al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ways a stock of matter in our memory, that so when we should use it, we may bring forth out of our treasury things new and old. For a good man hath a good Treasury in his heart, from whence he bringeth forth good things, <hi>Luke</hi> 6.45. and out of this abund<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance of his heart, he should speak to himself as well as to others. Yea if we took things in order, and observed some Method in respect of the matter, and did Meditate first on one Truth concerning
<pb n="727" facs="tcp:61132:410"/>
Eternity, and then another, it would not be amiss. And if any should be barren of Matter through weakness of memory, they may have notes or books of this subject for their further<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance.</p>

                        <p n="2">2. WHen you have fetcht from your memory the matter of your Meditation, your next work is to present it to your Judgment: open there the case as fully as thou canst; set forth the several ornaments of the Crown, the several dignities belong<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to the Kingdom, as they are partly laid open in the beginning of this Book; Let judgment deliberately view them over, and take as exact a survey as it can, Then put the question, and require a de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>termination, Is there happiness in all this? or not? Is not here e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nough to make me blessed? Can he want any thing, who fully possesseth God? Is there any thing higher for a creature to attain? Thus urge thy judgment to pass an upright sentence, and compel it to subscribe to the perfection of thy Celestial happiness, and to leave this sentence as under its hand upon Record. If thy senses should here begin to mutter, and to put in a word for fleshly pleasure or profits; let judgment hear what each can say: weigh the Argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments of the world and flesh in one end, and the Arguments for the preheminence of Glory in the other end, and judg impartially which should be preferred. Try whether there be any comparison to be made; which is more excellent? which more manly? which is more satisfactory? and which more pure? which freeth most from misery? and advanceth us highest? and which dost thou think is of longer continuance? Thus let deliberate judgment de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cide it; and let not Flesh carry it by noise and by violence; And when the sentence is passed and recorded in thy heart, it will be ready at hand to be produced upon any occasion, and to silence the flesh in its next attempt, and to disgrace the world in its next com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>petition.</p>
                        <p>Thus exercise thy Judgment in the contemplation of thy Rest; thus Magnifie and Advance the Lord in thy heart, till a holy admi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration hath possessed thy Soul.</p>

                        <p n="3">3. BUt the great work (which you may either promise or sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>joyn to this as you please,) is, To exercise thy belief of the truth of thy Rest: And that both in respect of the truth of the Promise, and also the truth of thy own Interest and Title. As unbe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lief doth cause the languishing of all our Graces, so Faith would do much to revive and actuate them, if it were but revived and actuated it self: Especially our belief of the verity of the Scripture, I conceive as needful to be exercised and confirmed, as almost any point of Faith. But of this I have spoken in the Second Part of this Book, whither I refer thee for some confirming Arguments. Though few complain of their not believing Scripture, yet I con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive it to be the commonest part of unbelief, and the very root of bitterness, which spoileth our Graces. Perhaps thou hast not a positive belief of the contrary, nor dost not flatly think that Scripture is not the Word of God; that were to be a down-right Infidel indeed: And yet thou maist have but little belief, that Scripture is Gods Word, and that both in regard of the habit, and the act. Its one thing, not to beleeve Scripture to be true; and another thing, positively to beleeve it to be false. Faith may be idle, and suspend its exercise toward the Truth, though it do not yet act against the Truth. It may stand still, when it goes not out of the way; it may be asleep, and do you little service, though it do not directly fight against you. Besides, a great deal of unbelief may consist with a small degree of Faith. If we did soundly be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leeve, That there is such a Glory; that within a few days our eyes shall behold it: O what passions would it raise within us! Were we throughly perswaded, That every Word in the Scripture concerning the unconceivable joyes of the Kingdom, and the un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>expressible Blessedness of the life to come, were the very Word of the Living God, and should certainly be performed to the smallest tittle; O what astonishing apprehensions of that life would it breed! what amazing horror would seize upon our hearts, when we found our selves strangers to the conditions of that life! and utterly ignorant of our portion therein! what love, what longings would it raise within us! O, how it would actuate every affection! how it would transport us with joy upon
<pb n="729" facs="tcp:61132:411"/>
the least assurance of our title! If I were as verily perswaded, that I shall shortly see those great things of Eternity, promised in the Word, as I am, that this is a chair that I sit in, or that this is paper that I write on; would it not put another Spirit within me? would it not make me forget, and despise the world? and even forget to sleep,<note place="margin">John 4.32.</note> or to eat? And say (as Christ) <hi>I have meat to eat, that ye know not of.</hi> O, Sirs, you little know what a through be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lief would work. Not that every one hath such affections, who hath a true Faith: But thus would the acting and improvement of our Faith advance us.</p>
                        <p>Therefore let this be a chief part of thy business in Meditati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on. Produce the strong Arguments for the Truth of Scripture; plead them against thy unbelieving nature; answer, and silence all the cavils of infidelity: Read over the Promises; study all con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firming Providences; call forth thine own recorded experiences: Remember the Scriptures already fulfilled; both to the Church and Saints in former ages, and eminently to both in this present age; and those that have been fulfilled particularly to thee: Get ready the clearest and most convincing Arguments, and keep them by thee, and frequently thus use them. Think it not enough, that thou wast once convinced, though thou hast now forgot the Argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments that did it; no, nor that thou hast the Arguments still in thy Book, or in thy Brain: This is not the acting of thy Faith; but present them to thy understanding in thy frequent meditations, and urge them home, till they force belief. Actual convincing, when it is clear and frequent, will work those deep impressions on the heart, which an old neglected forgotten conviction will not. O, if you would not think it enough, that you have Faith in the habit, and that you did once beleeve, but would be daily setting this first wheel a going: Surely, all the inferior wheels of the Affections would more easily move. Never expect to have Love and Joy move, when the foregoing Grace of Faith stands still.</p>
                        <p>And as you should thus act your assent to the Promise, so also your Acceptation, your Adherence, your Affiance, and your Assurance: These are the four steps of Application of the Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mise to our selves. I have said somewhat among the Helps, to move you to get Assurance: But that which I here aim at, is, That you would daily exercise it. Set before your Faith, the Freeness, and the Universality of the Promise: Consider of Gods offer,
<pb n="730" facs="tcp:61132:412"/>
and urging it upon all; and that he hath excepted from the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ditional Covenant, no man in the world; nor will exclude any from Heaven, who will accept of his offer. Study also the graci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous disposition of Christ, and his readiness to entertain, and wel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come all that will come: Study all the Evidences of his love, which appeared in his sufferings; in his preaching the Gospel; in his condescention to sinners; in his easie conditions; in his exceed<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing patience; and in his urgent invitations: Do not all these dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cover his readiness to save? did he ever yet manifest himself un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>willing? remember also his faithfulness to perform his engage<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments. Study also the Evidences of his Love in thy self; look over the works of his Grace in thy soul: If thou do not finde the degree which thou desirest, yet deny not that degree which thou findest; look after the sincerity, more then the quantity. Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>member what discoveries of thy state, thou hast made formerly in the work of self-examination; how oft God hath convinced thee of the sincerity of thy heart: Remember all the sonner testi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monies of the Spirit; and all the sweet feelings of the favor of God; and all the prayers that he hath heard and granted, and all the rare preservations and deliverances; and all the progress of his Spirit in his workings on thy soul; and the disposals of pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vidence, conducing to thy good: The vouchsafing of means, the directing thee to them, the directing of Ministers to meet with thy state, the restraint of those sins that thy nature was most prone to. And though one of these considered alone, may be no sure evidence of his special love, (which I expect thou shouldst try by more infallible signes) yet lay them altogether, and then think with thy self, Whether all these, do not testifie the good will of the Lord, concerning thy salvation? and may not well be pleaded against thine unbelief? And whether thou maist not conclude with <hi>Sampsons</hi> Mother, when her husband thought they should surely die, <hi>If the Lord were pleased to kill us, he would not have re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived an offering at our hands, neither would he have shewed us all these things; nor would, as at this time, have told us such things as these,</hi> Judg. 13.22, 23.</p>

If these forementioned Arguments will not rouse up thy love, thou hast more enough of this nature at hand: Thou hast all Christs personal excellencies to study: thou hast all his particular mercies to thy self, both special and common: thou hast all his sweet and neer relations to thee, and thou hast the happiness of thy perpetual abode with him hereafter; all these do offer themselves to thy Meditation, with all their several branches and adjuncts. Only follow them close to thy heart; ply the work, and let it not cool: Deal with thy heart, as Christ did with <hi>Peter,</hi> when he asked him thrice over, Lovest thou me? till he was grieved, and answers, Lord, thou knowest that I love thee.

Therefore it is, that they who pray meerly from custom, or meerly from conscience, considering it as a duty onely, but look<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing for no great matters from God by their prayers, are generally formal and heartless therein; whereas the Christian that hath ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>served the wonderful success of prayer, and as verily looks for benefit by it, and thriving to his soul in the use of it, as he looks for benefit by his labors, and thriving to his body in the use of his food, how faithfully doth he follow it? and how cheerfully go through it? O, how willingly do we Ministers study? how cheer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fully do we Preach? What life doth it put into our instructions and exhortations, when we have but hope that our labor will succeed? when we discern a people attend to the Word, and regard the Message, and hear them inquire what they shall do, as men that are willing to be ruled by God, and as men that would fain have their souls to be saved; you would not think how it helpeth us, both for invention and expression! O who can chuse but pray heartily for, and preach heartily to such a people! As the sucking of the young one doth draw forth the milk, so will the peoples desire and obedience draw forth the Word: So that a dull people, make dull Preachers, and a lively people, make a live<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly Preacher. So great a force hath hope in all our duties. As hope
<pb n="740" facs="tcp:61132:417"/>
of speeding encreaseth, so doth diligence in seeking encrease; be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sides the great conducement of it to our joy: Even the false hope of the wicked doth much support, and maintain a kinde of com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fort answerable to their hope; though, its true, their hope and joy will both die with them: How much more will the Saints hopes refresh and support them! All this I have said, to shew you the excellency and necessity of this Grace, and so to provoke you to the more constant acting of it. If your hope dieth, your duties die, yours endevors die, your joyes die, and your souls die. And if your hope be not acted, but lie asleep, its next to dead, both in like<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness and preparation.</p>
                        <p>Therefore, Christian Reader, when thou art winding up thy affections to Heaven, do not forget to give one lift at thy Hope; remember to winde up this peg also. The object of Hope hath four qualifications; First, It must be good, secondly, Future, thirdly, Difficult, fourthly, yet Possible. For the goodness of thy Rest, there is somewhat said before, which thou maist transfer hither as thou findest it useful; so also of the difficulty and futuri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty. Let Faith then shew thee the truth of the Promise, and Judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment the goodness of the thing promised, and what then is want<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing for the raising of thy hope? Shew thy soul from the Word, and from the Mercies, and from the Nature of God, what possi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bility, yea, what probability, yea, what certainty thou hast of possessing the Crown. Think thus, and reason thus with thine own heart: Why should I not confidently, and comfortably hope, when my soul is in the hands of so compassionate a Saviour? and when the Kingdom is at the disposal of so bounteous a God? Did he ever manifest any backwardness to my good? or discover the least inclination to my ruine?<note place="margin">Ezek. 18.32. &amp; 33.11.</note> Hath he not sworn the contrary to me in his Word? that he delights not in the death of him that dieth, but rather that he should repent and live? Have not all his deal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings with me witnessed the same? Did he not minde me of my danger, when I never feared it? and why was this, if he would not have me to escape it? Did he not minde me of my happiness, when I had no thoughts of it? and why was this, but that he would have me to enjoy it? How oft hath he drawn me to himself, and his Christ, when I have drawn backward, and would have broken from him? What restless importunity hath he used in his suit? how hath he followed me from place to place? and his
<pb n="741" facs="tcp:61132:417"/>
Spirit incessantly sollicited my heart, with winning suggestions and perswasions for my good? And would he have done all this, if he had been willing that I should perish? If my soul were in the hands of my mortal foes, then indeed there were small hopes of my salvation; yea if it were wholly in my own hands, my flesh, and my folly would betray it to damnation. But have I as much cause to distrust God, as to distrust my foes? or to distrust my self? Sure I have not. Have I not a sure Promise to build and rest on? and the Truth of God engaged to fulfil it? Would I not hope, if an honest man had made me a promise of any thing in his power? And shall I not hope, when I have the Covenant, and the Oath of God? Its true, the glory is out of sight; we have not beheld the Mansions of the Saints: Who hath ascended up to dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cover it, and descended to tell us what he had seen? why, but the Word is neer me: Have I not <hi>Moses,</hi> and the Prophets? Christ and his Apostles? Is not the promise of God more certain then our sight? it is not by sight, but by hope that we must be saved; and hope that is seen is not hope; for if we see it, why do we yet hope for it? but if we hope for that we see not, then do we with patience wait for it, <hi>Rom.</hi> 8.24, 25. I have been ashamed of my hope in the arm of flesh, but hope in the promise of God, maketh not ashamed, <hi>Rom.</hi> 5.5. I will say therefore in my greatest sufferings, with the Church, <hi>Lam.</hi> 3.24. <hi>&amp;c.</hi> The Lord is my por<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, therefore will I hope in him. The Lord is good to them that wait for him, to the soul that seeketh him. It is good that I both hope, and quietly wait for the salvation of the Lord. It is good for a man, that he bear the yoke in his youth. I will sit alone, and keep silence, because I have born it upon me. I will put my mouth in the dust, if so be there may be hope. For the Lord will not cast off for ever. But though he cause grief, yet will he have com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>passion according to the multitude of his mercies. Though I lan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guish and die, yet will I hope; for he hath said, The righteous hath hope in his death, <hi>Prov.</hi> 14.32. Though I must lie down in dust and darkness, yet there my flesh shall rest in hope, <hi>Psal.</hi> 16.9. And when my flesh hath nothing, in which it may rejoyce, yet will I keep the rejoycing of hope firm to the end, <hi>Heb.</hi> 3.6. For he hath said, The hope of the righteous shall be gladness, <hi>Prov.</hi> 10.28. In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed, if I had lived still under the Covenant of Works, and been put my self to the satisfying of that Justice, then there had been no
<pb n="742" facs="tcp:61132:418"/>
hope; But Christ hath taken down those impossibilities, and hath brought in a better hope, by which<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> we may now draw nigh to God, <hi>Heb.</hi> 7.19. Or if I had to do with a feeble Creature, there were small hope; for how could he raise this Body from the dust? and lift me up above the Sun? But what is this to the A mighty Power, who made the Heavens and Earth of nothing? Cannot that same power that raised Christ, raise me? and that hath glori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fied the Head, also glorifie the Members? Doubtless by the blood of Christs Covenant, will God send forth his prisoners from the pit, wherein is no water; therefore will I turn to this strong hold, as a prisoner of hope, <hi>Zach.</hi> 9.11, 12.</p>
                        <p>And thus you see how Meditation may excite your Hope.</p>

When you have thus mounted your Love, and Desire, and Hope; go on, and think further thus with your selves: And will God in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed dwell with men? And is there such a glory within the reach of hope? O, why do I not then lay hold upon it? where is the cheerful vigor of my spirit?<note place="margin">1 Tim. 6.12, 19. 1 Pet. 1.13. Heb. 12.1. 1 Cor. 9.24. Matth. 11.12.</note> why do I not gird up the loyns of my minde? and play the man for such a prize? why do I not run with speed, the race before me? and set upon mine enemies on every side? and valiantly break through all resistance? why do I not take this Kingdom by force? and my fervent soul catch at the place? do I yet sit still, and Heaven before me? If my Beast do but see his Provender; if my greedy senses perceive but their de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lightful objects, I have much ado to stave them off: And should not my soul be as eager for such a blessed Rest? why then do I not undauntedly fall to work? what should stop me? or what should dismay me? Is God with me, or against me in the work? will Christ stand by me, or will he not? If it were a way of sin that leads to death, then I might expect that God should resist me, and stand in my way with the drawn sword of his displeasure; or at least overtake me to my grief at last: But is he against the obeying of his own commands? is perfect good against any thing but evil? doth he bid me seek, and will he not assist me in it? doth he set

me awork, and urge me to it, and will he after all, be against me in it?<note place="margin">Rom. 8.31.</note> It cannot be. And if he be for me, who can be against me? In the work of sin, all things almost are ready to help us, and God onely, and his Servants are against us; and how ill doth that work prosper in our hands? But in my course to Heaven, almost all things are against me, but God is for me; and how happily still doth the work succeed? Do I set upon this work in my own strength, or rather in the strength of Christ my Lord? And can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not I do all things through him that strengthneth me? was he ever foiled, or subdued by an enemy? He hath been assaulted in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed; but was he ever conquered? Can they take the sheep, till they have overcome the Shepherd? why then doth my flesh lay open to me the difficulties, and urge me so much with the great<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness and troubles of the work? It is Christ that must answer all these Objections; and what are the difficulties that can stay his power? Is any thing too hard for the Omnipotent God? May not <hi>Peter</hi> boldly walk on the Sea, if Christ do but give the word of command? and if he begin to sink, is it from the weakness of Christ, or the smalness of his Faith? The water indeed is but a sinking ground to tread on; but if Christ be by, and countenance us in it, if he be ready to reach us his hand; who would draw back for fear of danger? Is not Sea and Land alike to him? shall I be driven from my God, and from my Everlasting Rest, as the silly Birds are feared from their food, with a man of clouts, or a loud noise, when I know before there is no danger in it? How do I see men daily in these wars, adventure upon Armies, and Forts, and Cannons, and cast themselves upon the instruments of death? and have not I as fair a prize before me? and as much encourage<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment to adventure as they? What do I venture? my life is the most; and in these prosperous times, there is not one of many that ventures that: VVhat do I venture on? are they not unarm<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed foes? A great hazzard indeed, to venture on the hard thoughts of the world! or on the scorns and slanders of a wicked tongue! Sure these Serpents teeth are out; these Vipers are easily shaken into the fire; these Adders have no stings; these Thorns have lost their prickles: As all things below are silly comforters, so are they silly toothless enemies: Bugbears to frighten fools and children, rather then powerful dreadful foes. Do I not well de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>serve to be turned into Hell, if the scorns and threats of blinded
<pb n="744" facs="tcp:61132:419"/>
men, if the fear of silly rotten Earth, can drive me thither? do I not well deserve to be shut out of Heaven, if I will be frighted from it, with the tongues of sinners? Surely my own voice must needs condemn me, and my own hand subscribe the sentence, and common Reason would say that my damnation were just. VVhat if it were Father, or Mother, or Husband, or VVife, or the neerest Friend that I have in the world, (if they may be called Friends that would draw me to damnation) should I not run over all that would keep me from Christ? VVill their friendship countervail the enmity of God? or be any comfort to my condemned soul? shall I be yielding, and pliable to the desires of men, and onely harden my self against the Lord? Let men, let Angels beseech me upon their knees, I will slight their tears, I will scorn to stop my course to behold them, I will shut mine ears against their cryes: Let them flatter, or let them frown; let them draw forth tongues and swords against me, I am resolved to break through in the might of Christ, and to look upon them all as naked dust. If they would entice me with preferment, with the Kingdoms of the world; I will no more regard them, then the dung of the Earth. O Blessed Rest! O most unvaluable Glorious State! who would sell thee for dreams and shadows? who would be enticed or af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>frighted from thee? who would not strive, and fight, and watch, and run, and that with violence, even to the last breath, so he might but have hope at last to obtain thee? Surely none but those that know thee not, and beleeve not thy glory. Thus you see with what kinde of Meditations you may excite your Courage, and raise your Resolutions.</p>

This is so desirable to every man by nature, and is so essentially necessary to the constituting of his happiness, that I hope I need not say much to perswade you to any thing that would make your life delightful.

Well, but yet think a little further with thy self; Though the Real presence do afford the choicest joy, yet the presence of its imperfect Idea or image in my understanding, may afford me a great deal of true delight, Is it nothing to have a deed of gift from God?

                        <p>Here then, Reader, take thy heart once again, as it were, by the hand, Bring it to the top of the highest Mount; if it be possible to some Atlas above the clouds; shew it the Kingdom of Christ and the glory of it; say to it, All this will thy Lord bestow upon thee, who hast believed in him, and been a worshipper of him; It is the Fathers good pleasure to give thee this Kingdom; Seest thou this astonishing Glory above thee? Why all this is thy own inheritance. This Crown is thine, these pleasures are thine, this company, this beauteous place is thine, all things are thine, because thou art Christs, and Christ is thine; when thou wast married to him, thou hadstall this with him.</p>
                        <p>Thus take thy heart into the Land of Promise; shew it the plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sant hills, and fruitful valleys; Shew it the clusters of Grapes which thou hast gathered; and by those convince it that it is a blessed Land, flowing with better then milk and honey; enter the gates of the holy City; walk through the streets of the New Jerusalem, walk about Sion, go round about her, tell the towers thereof; mark well her bulwarks; consider her palaces, that thou mayest tell it to thy soul (<hi>Psal.</hi> 48.12, 13.) Hath it not the Glory of God, and is not her light like to a stone most precious? See the twelve foundations of her walls, and the names of the twelve Apostles of

It hath no need of Sun or Moon to shine in it, for the Glory of God doth lighten it, and the Lamb is the light thereof, and the nations of them which are saved shall walk in the light of it. These sayings are faithful and true; and the Lord God of the holy Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phets, hath sent his Angels (and his own Son) to shew unto his servants the things that must shortly be done, <hi>Rev.</hi> 21.11, 12, 13. <hi>&amp;c.</hi> to the end, &amp; 22.6.

                        <p>The first and maine Instrument of this work, is that Cogitation, or consideration which I be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore have opened, and which is to go along with us through the whole. But because meer Cogitation if it be not prest home, will not so pierce and affect the heart, Therefore we must here proceed to a second step, which is called Soliloquy, which is nothing but a pleading the case with our own souls. As in preach<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ing to others, the bare propounding and opening of truths and du<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties, doth seldome finde that successe as the lively application: so it is also in meditating and propounding Truths to our selves. The moving, pathetical pleadings with a sinner, will make him deeply affected with a common Truth, which before, though he knew it, yet it never stirr'd him: What heart-meltings do we see under powerfull application, when the naked explication did little move them? If any where there be a tender-hearted, affectionate people, it is likely under such a moving, close-applying, Ministry. Why thus must thou do in thy Meditation to quicken thy own heart: Enter into a serious debate with it: Plead with it in the
<pb n="750" facs="tcp:61132:422"/>
most moving and affecting language: Urge it with the most weigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty and powerful Arguments: This soliloquy, or self-conference, hath been the practice of the holy men of God in all times; How doth <hi>David</hi> plead with his soul against its dejections, and argue it into a holy confidence and comfort? <hi>Psal.</hi> 42.5, 11. and 43.5. <hi>Why art thou cast down O my soul, and why art thou so disquieted within me? Trust in God, for I shall yet give him thanks who is the health of my countenance and my God.</hi>

So that this is no new path which I perswade you to tread, but that which the Saints have ever used in their Medita<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion.</p>

                        <p>THis Soliloquy hath its several parts, and its due method where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in it should be managed. The parts of it are, according to the several Affections of the soul, and according to the sever<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>all necessities thereof; according to the various Arguments to be used, and according to the various wayes of Argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing. So that you see if I should attempt the full handling hereof, it would take up more time and room then I intend or can allow it. Only thus much in brief. As every good Master and Father of a Fami<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, is a good Preacher to his own Family; so every good Christian, is a good Preacher to his own soul. Soliloquy is a Preaching to ones self. Therefore the very same Method which a Minister should use in his Preaching to others, should a Christian use in speaking to himself. Dost thou understand the best Method for a publick Preacher? Dost thou know the right parts and order of a Sermon? and which is the most effectual way of application? why then I need to lay it open no further: thou understandest the Method and partes of this soliloquy. Mark the most affecting, heart-melting Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nister; observe his course both for matter and manner; set him as a
<pb n="751" facs="tcp:61132:422"/>
patern before thee for thy imitation; and the same way that he takes with the hearts of his people, do thou also take with thy own heart. Men are naturally addicted to imitation, especially of those whom they most affect and approve of: How neer do some Ministers come in their Preaching to the imitation of others, whom they usually hear, and much reverence and value? so maist thou in this duty of preaching to thy heart: Art thou not ready sometime when thou hearest a Minister, to remember divers things which thou thinkest might be moving and pertinent, and to wish that he would have mentioned and pressed them on the Hearers? why, remember those when thou art exhorting thy self, and press them on thy own heart as close as thou canst.</p>

So, as it respects thy duty for the future, consider how thou maist improve this comfortable Doctrine, which must be by strong and effectual perswasion with thy heart. First, By way of Dehorta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion from the forementioned sins. Secondly, By way of Exhorta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion to the severall duties. And these are either, first, Internal, or secondly, External. First, Therefore admonish thy heart of its own inward neglects and contempts. Secondly, And then of the neg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lects and trespasses in thy practice against this blessed state of Rest. Set home these severall Admonitions to the quick, Take thy heart as to the brink of the bottomless pit, force it to look in, threaten thy self with the theatnings of the Word, tell it of the torments that it draweth upon it self; tell it what joyes it is madly reje<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cting, force it to promise thee to do so no more, and that not with a cold and heartless promise, but earnestly with most solemn asseverations and engagements. Secondly, The next and last is, to drive on thy soul to those positive duties, which are required of thee in relation this to Rest: As first, to the inward duties of thy heart, and there first, To be diligent in making sure of this Rest: second<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, To Rejoyce in the expectation of it. This is called a use of <hi>Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>solation</hi>: It is to be furthered by first laying open the excellency of the State; and secondly, the certainty of it in it self, and thirdly, our own interest in it; by clearing and proving all these, and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>futing all sadning objections that may be brought against them: thirdly, So also for the provoking of Love, of Hope, and all other the Affections in the way, before more largely opened.</p>
                        <p>And secondly, press on thy heart also to all outward duties, that are to be performed in thy way to Rest, whether in worship or in civil conversation, whether publike or private, ordinary, or extra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ordinary; This is commonly called, A use of <hi>Exhortation.</hi> Here bring in all quickning Considerations, either those that may drive
<pb n="753" facs="tcp:61132:423" rendition="simple:additions"/>
thee, or those that may draw; which work by Fear, or which work by Desire: These are commonly called Motives; but above all be sure that thou follow them home: Ask thy heart what it can say against them? Is there weight in them? or is there not? and then, what it can say against the duty; Is it necessary? is it comfortable? or is it not? when thou hast silenced thy heart, and brought it to a stand, then drive it further, and urge it to a Promise: As suppose it were to the duty of Meditation, which we are speaking of: Force thy self beyond these lazy purposes; resolve on the duty before thou stir: Enter into a solemn Covenant to be faithful; let not thy heart go, till it have without all halting and reservations flatly promised thee, That it will fall to the work; write down this promise, shew it to thy heart the next time it loiters; then study also the Helps and Means, the Hinderances, and the Directions that concern thy duty. And this is in brief the exercise of this <hi>Soliloquy,</hi> or the <hi>Preaching of Heaven to thy own Heart.</hi>

I Answer thee, First, There is not that ability required to this, as is to the work of publike Preaching; here thy thoughts may serve the turn, but there must be also the decent Ornaments of Language, here is needful but an honest understanding heart, but there must be a good pronunci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ation and a voluble tongue; here if thou miss of the Method, thou maist make up that in one piece of Application which thou hast neglected in another, but there thy failings are injurious to many, and a scandal and disgrace to the Work of God; thou knowest what will fit thy own heart, and what Arguments take best with thy own Affections, but thou art not so well acquainted with the dispositions of others. Secondly, I answer further, Every man is bound to be skilful in the Scriptures as wel as Ministers: Kings and Magistrates, <hi>Deut.</hi> 17.18, 19, 20. <hi>Josh.</hi> 1.8. And the people also, <hi>Deut.</hi> 6.6, 7, 8. Do you think, if you did as is there commanded, Write it upon thy heart, lay them up in thy soul, binde them upon thy hand, and between thine eyes, meditate in them day and night; I say, if you did thus, would you not quickly understand as much as
<pb n="754" facs="tcp:61132:424"/>
this? See <hi>Psal.</hi> 1.3. <hi>Deut.</hi> 11.18.—6.6, 7. Doth not God com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mand thee, to teach them diligently to thy children? and to talk of them when thou sittest in thy house, when thou walkest by the way, when thou lyest down, and when thou risest up? And if thou must be skilled to teach thy children, much more to teach thy self; and if thou canst talk of them to others, why not also to thine own heart? Certainly our unskilfulness and disability, both in a Metho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dical and lively teaching of our Families, and of our selves, is for the most part meerly through our own negligence, and a sin for which we have no excuse: You that learn the skil of your Trades and Sciences, might learn this also if you were but willing and painful.</p>

ANother step to arise by in our Contemplation, is, from this speaking to our selves to speak to God: Prayer is not such a stranger to this duty, but that ejaculatory requests may be intermixed or added, and that as a very part of the duty it self: How oft doth <hi>David</hi> intermix these in his Psalmes, sometime pleading with his soul, and sometime with God? and that in the same Psalme, and in the next verses? The Apostle bids us speak to our selves in Psalms, and Hymns, and no doubt we may also speak to God in them; this keeps the soul in minde of the Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vine Presence; it tends also exceedingly to quicken and raise it; so that as God is the highest Object of our Thoughts, so our view<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of him, and our speaking to him, and pleading with him, doth more elevate the soul, and actuate the Affections then any other part of Meditation can do. Men that are careless of their carriage and speeches among children and Ideots, will be sober and serious with Princes or grave men<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> so, though while we do but plead the case with our selves, we are careless and unaffected yet when we turn our speech to God, it may strike us with awfulness, and the holiness and Majesty of him whom we speak to,<note place="margin">LXX <hi>Legunt <gap reason="foreign">

Thirdly, The mixture, as in Musick, doth more affect; the one helps on, and puts life into the other. Fourthly, It is not the right order to begin at the top; therefore Meditation and speaking to our selves, should go before Prayer, or speaking to God; want of this makes Prayer with most to have little more then the name of Prayer, and men to speak as lightly and as stupidly to the dreadful God, as if it were to one of their companions, and with far less reverence and affection, then they would speak to an Angel if he should appear to them, yea, or to a Judg or Prince if they were speaking for their lives: and consequently their success and answers are often like their prayers.

Therefore let us yet a little further consider what may be done, to make your thoughts of Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven to be piercing, affecting, raising thoughts.</p>
                        <p>Here therefore you must understand, That the meer pure work of Faith, hath many disadvantages with us, in comparison of the work of Sense. Faith is imperfect, for we are renewed but in part; but Sense hath its strength, according to the strength of the flesh: Faith goes against a world of resistance, but Sense doth not. Faith
<pb n="757" facs="tcp:61132:425"/>
is supernatural, and therefore prone to declining, and to languish both in the habit and exercise, further then it is still renewed and excited; but Sense is natural, and therefore continueth while na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture continueth. The object of Faith is far off; we must go as far as Heaven for our Joyes: But the object of Sense is close at hand. It is no easie matter to rejoyce at that which we never saw, nor ever knew the man that did see it; and this upon a meer promise which is written in the Bible; and that, when we have nothing else to rejoyce in, but all our sensible comforts do fail us: But to rejoyce in that which we see and feel, in that which we have hold of, and pos<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>session already; this is not difficult. Well then, what should be done in this case? Why sure it will be a point of our Spiritual Prudence, and a singular help to the furthering of the work of Faith, to call in our <note n="*" place="margin">

Caution and Limitations before mentioned.) Suppose thou were now beholding this City of God; and that thou hadst been com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>panion with <hi>John</hi> in his Survey of its Glory; and hadst seen the Thrones, the Majesty, the Heavenly Hosts, the shining Splendor which he saw. Draw as strong suppositions as may be from thy sense for the helping of thy affections: It is lawful to suppose we did see for the present, that which God hath in Prophecies reveal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, and which we must really see in more unspeakable brightness before long. Suppose therefore with thy self thou hadst been that Apostles fellow-traveller into the Celestial Kingdom, and that thou hadst seen all the Saints in their White Robes, with Palms in their hands: Suppose thou hadst heard those Songs of <hi>Moses,</hi> and of the Lamb; or didst even now hear them praising and glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rifying the Living God: If thou hadst seen these things indeed, in what a rapture wouldst thou have been? And the more seri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ously thou puttest this supposition to thy self, the more will the Meditation elevate thy heart. I would not have thee, as the Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pists, draw them in Pictures, nor use mysterious, significant Cere<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monies to represent them. This, as it is a course forbidden by God, so it would but seduce and draw down thy heart: But get the liveliest Picture of them in thy minde that possibly thou canst; meditate of them, as if thou were all the while beholding them, and as if thou were even hearing the <hi>Hallelujahs,</hi> while thou art thinking of them; till thou canst say, Methinks I see a glympse of the Glory! methinks I hear the shouts of joy and praise! me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thinks I even stand by <hi>Abraham</hi> and <hi>David, Peter</hi> and <hi>Paul,</hi> and many more of these triumphing souls! methinks I even see the Son of God appearing in the clouds, and the world standing at his bar to receive their doom; methinks I even hear him say, <hi>Come ye blessed of my Father!</hi> and even see them go rejoycing into the Joy of their Lord! My very dreams of these things have deeply affected me; and should not these just suppositions affect me much more? What if I had seen with <hi>Paul,</hi> those unutterable things? should I not have been exalted (and that perhaps above measure) as well as he? What if I had stood in the room of <hi>Stephen,</hi> and seen Heaven opened, and Christ sitting at the right hand of God? Surely, that one sight was worth the suffering his storm of stones. O that I might but see what he did see, though I also suffered what he did suffer! What if I had seen such a sight as <hi>Michaiah

COmpare the things which thou shalt enjoy above, with the excellency of those admirable works of Providence, which God doth exercise in the Church, and in the World.

Would not all these have been wondrous, glorious sights? But we shall see far greater things then these. And as our sights shall be more wonder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful, so also they shall be more sweet: There shall be no blood nor wrath intermingled; we shall not then cry out as <hi>David, Who can stand before this Holy Lord God?</hi> Would it not have been an astonishing sight, to have seen the Sun stand still in the Firmament? or to have seen <hi>Ahaz</hi> Dyal go ten degrees backward?

We shall possess that Pearl and Power it self, through whose vertue all these works were done; we shall our selves be the subjects of more wonderful mercies then any of these. <hi>Jonas</hi> was raised but from a three days burial, from the belly of the Whale in the deep Ocean; but we shall be raised from many yeers rotten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness and dust; and that dust exalted to a Sun-like glory; and that glory perpetuated to all eternity.

favors upon record. The very remembrance and rehearsal of them is sweet: How much more sweet was the actual enjoyment? But all these are nothing to the Mercies which are above. Look over the excellent Mercies of thy Youth and Education; the mercies of thy riper yeers or age; the mercies of thy prosperity, and of thy adversity; the mercies of thy several places and rela<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions; are they not excellent, and innumerable? Canst not thou think on the several places thou hast lived in, and remember that they have each had their several mercies? the mercies of such a place, and such a place; and all of them very rich and engaging Mercies? O how sweet was it to thee, when God resolved thy last doubts? when he overcame and silenced thy fears and unbelief? when he prevented the inconveniences of thy life, which thy own counsel would have cast thee into? when he eased thy pains? when he healed thy sickness, and raised thee up as from the very grave and death? when thou prayedst, and wepst, as <hi>Hezekiah,</hi> and saidst, <hi>My days are cut off, I shall go to the gates of the grave, I am deprived of the residue of my yeers: I said I shall not see the Lord, even the Lord in the Land of the Living, I shall behold man no more with the Inhabitants of the World. Mine age is departed and removed from me as a Shepherds Tent: I have cut off like a Weaver my life; he will cut me off with pining sickness; from day to day wilt thou make an end of me, &amp;c. Yet did he in love to thy soul deliver it from the pit of corruption, and cast thy sins behinde his back; and set thee among the living, to praise him as thou dost this day: That the fathers to the children might make known his Truth: The Lord was ready to save thee, that thou mightest sing the songs of praise to him in his house all the days of thy life,</hi> Isai. 38.10. to the 20. I say, were not all these most precious mercies? Alas, these are but small things for thee in the eyes of God; he intendeth thee far greater things then these, even such as these are scarce a taste of. It was a choice mercy that God hath so notably answered thy prayers; and that thou hast been so oft and so evidently a pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vailer with him: But O think then, Are all these so sweet and precious that my life would have been a perpetual misery without them? Hath his providence lifted me so high on Earth, and his merciful kindness made me great? How sweet then will the Glory of his presence be? And how high will his eternal love exalt me? And how great shall I be made in Communion with his greatness?

If my pilgrimage, and warfare have such mercies, what shall I finde in my home, and in my Triumph? If God will communicate so much to me while I remain a sinner; what will he bestow when I am a perfect Saint? If I have had so much in this strange Country at such a distance from him; what shall I have in Heaven in his im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mediate presence, where I shall ever stand about his Throne?</p>

COmpare thy mercies thou shalt have above, with the mercies which Christ hath here bestowed on thy soul; and the glorious change which thou shalt have at last, with the gracious change which the Spirit hath wrought on thy heart: Compare the comforts of thy glorification, with the comforts of thy sanctification. There is not the smallest grace in thee, which is genuine and sincere, but is of greater worth then the riches of the Indies; not a hearty desire and groan after Christ, but is more to be valued, then the Kingdoms of the VVorld: A renewed nature is the very Image of God; Scripture calleth it by the name of [Christ dwelling in us] and [the Spirit] of God abiding in us: It is as a beam from the face of God himself; it is the Seed of God remaining in us; it is the onely inherent beauty of the rational soul; it innobleth man above all nobility; it fitteth him to understand his Makers pleasure, to do his VVill, and to receive his Glory. VVhy think then with thy self, If this grain of Mustard seed be so precious, what is the Tree of Life in the midst of the Paradise of God? If a spark of life which will but strive against corruptions, and flame out a few desires and groans, be so much worth; how glorious then is the Fountain and End of this life? If we be said to be like God, and to bear his Image, and to be holy as he is holy; when, alas, we are pressed down with a body of sin; Sure we shall then be much liker God, when we are perfectly holy and without blemish, and have no such thing as sin within us. Is the desire after Heaven so precious a thing? what then is the thing it self which is desired? Is the love so excellent? what then is the beloved? Is our joy in foreseeing and believing, so sweet? what will be the joy in the full possessing? O the delight that a Christian hath in the lively exercise of some of these affections! VVhat good do's it to his very heart, when he can feelingly say, He loves his Lord? what sweetness is there in the very act of loving? yea, even those troubling Passions of Sorrow and Fear, are yet delightful, when they are rightly exercised: How glad is a poor Christian, when he feeleth his heart begin to melt? and when the thoughts of sinful unkindness will dissolve it? Even this Sorrow doth yield him matter of Joy. O what will it then be,
<pb n="779" facs="tcp:61132:436"/>
when we shall do nothing but know God, and love, and rejoyce, and praise; and all this in the highest perfection? what a comfort is it to my doubting soul, when I have a little assurance of the sin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerity of my graces? when upon examination I can but trace the Spirit in his sanctifying works? How much more will it comfort me, to finde that this Spirit hath safely conducted me, and left me in the arms of Jesus Christ? what a change was it, that the Spirit made upon my soul, when he first turned me from darkness to light, and from the power of Satan unto God? To be taken from that horrid state of nature, wherein my self and my actions were loathsom to God, and the sentence of death was past upon me, and the Almighty took me for his utter enemy; and to be presently numbred among his Saints, and called his Friend, his Servant, his Son; and the sentence revoked which was gone forth; O what a change was this<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> To be taken from that state wherein I was born, and had lived delightfully so many yeers, and was rivetted in it by custom and engagements, when thousands of sins did lie upon my score; and if I had so died, I had been damned for ever; and to be justified from all these enormous crimes, and freed from all these fearful plagues, and put into the title of an Heir of Heaven; O what an astonishing change was this? Why then consider, how much greater will that glorious change then be? Beyond expressing; beyond conceiving! How oft when I have thought of this change in my Regeneration, have I cryed out, O blessed day! and blessed be the Lord that I ever saw it! why how then shall I cry out in Heaven, O blessed Eternity! and blessed be the Lord that brought me to it! Was the mercy of my conversion so exceeding great, that the Angels of God did rejoyce to see it? Sure then the mercy of my salvation will be so great, that the same Angels will congratulate my felicity. This Grace is but a spark that is raked up in the ashes; it is covered with flesh from the sight of the world, and covered with corruption sometime from mine-own sight: But my Everlasting glory will not so be clouded, nor my light be under a bushel, but upon a hill, even upon <hi>Sion,</hi> the Mount of God.</p>

                           <seg rend="decorInit">S</seg>Ixthly. The sixt and last part of this Directory, is, To guide you in the managing of your hearts through this work, and to shew you wherein you have need to be exceeding watchful. I have shewed before, what must be done with your hearts, in your preparations to the work, and in your setting upon it: I shall now shew it you, in respect of the time of per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formance. Our chief work will here be to discover to you the danger, and that will direct you to the fittest remedy. Let me therefore here acquaint you beforehand, That when ever you set upon this Heavenly employment, you shall finde your own hearts your greatest hinderer, and they will prove false to you in one or all of these four degrees. First, They will hold off, that you
<pb n="782" facs="tcp:61132:438"/>
will hardly get them to the work; secondly, or else they will be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tray you by their idleness in the work; pretending to do it, when they do it not; or thirdly, they will interrupt the work by their frequent excursions, and turning aside to every object; or fourth<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, they will spoil the work by cutting it short, and be gone before you have done any good on it. Therefore I here forewarn you, as you value the unvaluable comfort of this work, that you faith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fully resist these four dangerous evils, or else all that I have said hitherto is in vain.</p>
                        <p n="1">1. Thou shalt finde thy heart as backward to this, I think, as to any work in the world. O what excuses it will make! what evasions it will finde out! and what delays and demurs, when it is never so much convinced! Either it will question, whether it be a duty or not? or if it be so to others, yet whether it be so to thee? It will rake up any thing like reason to plead against it; it will tell thee, That this is a work for Ministers that have nothing else to study on; or for Cloysterers or persons that have more leisure then thou hast: If thou be a Minister, it will tell thee, This is the duty of the people; it is enough for thee to meditate for the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>structing of them; and let them meditate on what they have heard, as if it were thy duty onely to cook their meat, and serve it up, and perhaps a little to taste the sweetness, by licking thy fingers while thou art dressing it for others; but it is they onely that must eat it, digest it, and live upon it. Indeed, the smell may a little refresh thee, but it must be digesting it, that must maintain thy strength and life. If all this will not serve, thy heart will tell thee of other business; thou hast this company stayes for thee, or that business must be done: It may be it will set thee upon some other duty, and so make one duty shut out another; for it had rather go to any duty then to this. Perhaps it will tell thee, that other duties are greater, and therefore this must give place to them, because thou hast not time for both: Publike business is of more concernment; to study, to preach for the saving of souls must be preferred before these private contemplations: As if thou hadst not time to see to the saving of thy own soul, for looking after others! or thy charity to others were so great, that it draws thee to neglect thy comfort and salvation! or, as if there were any better way to fit us to be useful to others, then to make this experience of our doctrine our selves! Certainly Heaven where
<pb n="783" facs="tcp:61132:438"/>
is the Father of Lights, is the best fire to light our candle at, and the best book for a Preacher to study; and if they would be per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>swaded to study that more, the Church would be provided of more heavenly lights: And when their Studies are Divine, and their Spirits Divine, their preaching will then be also Divine; and they may be fitly called Divines indeed. Or, if thy heart have nothing to say against the work, then it will trifle away the time in delayes; and promise this day and the next, but still keep off from the doing of the business. Or lastly, If thou wilt not be so baffled with excuses or delayes, thy heart will give thee a flat denial, and oppose its own unwillingness to thy Reason: Thou shalt finde it come to the work, as a Bear to the stake, and draw back with all the strength it hath. I speak all this of the heart, so far as it is carnal, (which in too great a measure is in the best) for I know so far as the heart is Spiritual, it will judg this work the sweetest in the world.</p>
                        <p>Well then, what is to be done in the forementioned case? wilt thou do it, if I tell thee? Why, what wouldst thou do with a servant that were thus backward to his work? or to thy beast that should draw back when thou wouldst have him go forward? Wouldst thou not first perswade, and then chide, and then spur him, and force him on? and take no denial, nor let him alone, till thou hadst got him closely to fall to his work? Wouldst thou not say, Why, what should I do with a servant that will not work? or with an Ox or Horse that will not travel or labor? Shall I keep them to look on? Wilt thou then faithfully deal thus with thy heart? If thou be not a lazie self deluding Hypocrite, say, I will; by the help of God, I will: Set upon thy heart roundly; perswade it to the work; take no denial; chide it for its backwardness; use violence with it; bring it to the service, willing, or not willing: Art thou master of thy flesh or art thou a servant to it? hast thou no command of thy own thoughts? cannot thy will chuse the subject of thy Meditations, especially when thy judgment thus directeth thy will? I am sure God once gave thee mastery over thy flesh; and some power to govern thy own thoughts: Hast thou lost thy authority? art thou become a slave to thy depraved nature? Take up the authority again which God hath given thee<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> command thy heart; if it rebel, use vio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lence with it, if thou be too weak, call in the Spirit of Christ to
<pb n="784" facs="tcp:61132:439"/>
thine assistance: He is never backward to so good a work, nor will deny his help in so just a cause: God will be ready to help thee, if thou be not unwilling to help thy self. Say to him, Why Lord, thou gavest my Reason the command of my Thoughts and Affections; the authority I have received over them, is from thee, and now, behold they refuse to obey thine authority: Thou commandest me to set them to the work of Heavenly Meditation; but they rebel and stubbornly refuse the duty: Wilt thou not assist me to execute that authority which thou hast given me? O send me down thy Spirit and Power, that I may enforce thy com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mands, and effectually compel them to obey thy Will.</p>
                        <p>And thus doing, thou shalt see thy heart will submit; its re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sistance will be brought under; and its backwardness will be turn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed to a yielding compliance.</p>

                        <p n="2">2. WHen thou hast got thy heart to the work, beware least it delude thee by a loitering formality: Least it say, I go, and go not; least it trifle out the time, while it should be ef<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fectually meditating. Certainly, the heart is as likely to betray thee in this, as in any one particular about the duty: When thou hast perhaps but an hours time for thy Meditation, the time will be spent before thy heart will be serious. This doing of duty, as if we did it not, doth undo as many as the flat omission of it. To rub out the hour in a bare lazie thinking of Heaven, is but to lose that hour, and delude thy self. Well, what is to be done in this case? why, do here also as you do by a loitering servant; keep thine eye always upon thy heart; look not so much to the time it spendeth in the duty, as to the quantity and quality of the work that is done: You can tell by his work, whether your servant hath been painful; ask, what affections have yet been acted? how much am I yet got neerer Heaven? Verily many a mans heart must be followed as close in this duty of Meditation, as a Horse in a Mill, or an Ox at the Plow, that will go no longer then you are calling or scourging: If you cease driving but a moment, the heart will stand still; and perhaps the best hearts have much of this temper.</p>
                        <p>
                           <pb n="785" facs="tcp:61132:439"/>I would not have thee of the judgment of those, who think that while they are so backward, it is better let it alone; and that if meer love will not bring them to the duty, but there must be all this violence used to compel it, that then the service is worse then the omission. These men understand not; first, That this Argument would certainly cashiere all Spiritual obedience, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause the hearts of the best, being but partly sanctified, will still be resisting so far as they are carnal; Secondly, Nor do they under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stand well the corruptness of their own natures; Thirdly, Nor that their sinful undisposedness will not baffle or suspend the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mands of God; Fourthly, Nor one sin excuse another; Fifthly, Especially they little know the way of God to excite their Affecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons; and that the love which should compel them, must it self be first compelled, in the same sense as it is said to compel: Love I know is a most precious grace, and should have the chief inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>est in all our duties: But there be means appointed by God to procure this love; and shall I not use those means, till I can use them from love? that were to neglect the means, till I have the end. Must I not seek to procure love, till I have it already? There are means also for the increasing of love where it is begun; and means for the exciting of it where it lieth dull: And must I not use these means, till it is increased and excited? Why, this reason<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing considering-duty that we are in hand with, is the most singular means, both to stir up thy love, and to increase it; and therefore stay not from the duty, till thou feel thy love constrain thee, (that were to stay from the fire, till thou feel thy self warm) but fall upon the work, till thou art constrained to love; and then love will constrain thee to further duty.</p>
                        <p>My jealously, least thou shouldst miscarry by these sotish opini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, hath made me more tedious in the opening of its error. Let nothing therefore hinder thee while thou art upon the work, from plying thy heart with constant watchfulness and constraint; seeing thou hast such experience of its dulness and backwardness, let the spur be never out of its side; and when ever it slacks pace, be sure to give it a remembrance.</p>

                        <p n="3">3. AS thy heart will be loitering, so will it be diverting. It will be turning aside like a carless servant, to talk with every one that passeth by: When there should be nothing in thy minde, but the work in hand, it will be thinking of thy calling, or thinking of thy afflictions, or of every bird, or tree, or place thou seest, or of any impertinency, rather then of Heaven. Thy heart in this also will be like the Husbandmans Ox or Horse; if he drive not, he will not go; and if he guide not, he will not keep the furrow; and it is as good stand still, as go out of the way. Experience will tell thee, thou wilt have much ado with thy heart in this point, to keep it one hour to the work without many ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>travagancies and idle cogitations. The cure here is the same with that before; to use watchfulness, and violence with your own imaginations, and as soon as they step out, to chide them in. Say to thy heart, What? did I come hither to think of my business in the world? to think of places, and persons, of news, or vanity, yea, or of any thing but Heaven, be it never so good? what? canst thou not watch one hour? wouldst thou leave this world, and dwell in Heaven with Christ for ever? and canst thou not leave it one hour out of thy thoughts, nor dwell with Christ in one hours close Meditation? Ask thy heart as <hi>Absalom</hi> did <hi>Hushai,</hi> Is this thy love to thy friend? Dost thou love Christ, and the place of thy Eternal, Blessed abode, no more then so? When <hi>Pharaohs</hi> Butler dreamed,<note place="margin">Gen. 40.10, 11, &amp;c.</note> That he pressed the ripe Grapes into <hi>Pharaohs</hi> Cup, and delivered the Cup into the Kings hand, it was a happy dream, and signified his speedy access to the Kings pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sence: But the dream of the Baker, That the Birds did eat out of the Basket on his head, the baked meats prepared for <hi>Pharaoh,</hi> had an ill <hi>omen,</hi> and signified his hanging, and their eating of his flesh. So when the ripened Grapes of Heavenly Meditation are pressed by thee into the Cup of Affection, and this put into the hands of Christ by delightful praises (if thou take me for skilful) this is the interpretation, That thou shalt shortly be taken from this prison where thou liest, and be set before Christ in the Court of Heaven, and there serve up to him that Cup of praise (but much fuller, and much sweeter) for ever, and for ever. But if the
<pb n="787" facs="tcp:61132:440"/>
ravenous fowls of wandring thoughts, do devour the Meditations intended for Heaven, I will not say flatly it signifieth thy death, but this I will say, That so far as these intrude, they will be the death of that service; and if thou ordinarily admit them, That they devour the life, and the joy of thy thoughts; and if thou continue in such a way of duty to the end, It signifies the death of thy soul, as well as of thy service. Drive away these birds of prey then from thy sacrifice, and strictly keep thy heart to the work thou art upon.</p>

                        <p n="4">4. LAstly, Be sure also to look to thy heart in this, That it cut not off the work before the time, and run not away through weariness, before it have leave. Thou shalt finde it will be exceed<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing prone to this; like the Ox that would unyoke, or the Horse that would be unburdened, and perhaps cast off his burden, and run away. Thou maist easily perceive this in other duties; If in secret thou set thy self to pray, is not thy heart urging thee still to cut it short? dost thou not frequently finde a motion to have done? art thou not ready to be up as soon almost as thou art down on thy knees? Why, so it will be also in thy contemplati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons of Heaven: As fast as thou gettest up thy heart, it will be down again; it will be weary of the work; it will be minding thee of other business to be done; and stop thy Heavenly walk, before thou art well warm. Well, what is to be done in this case also? why the same authority and resolution, which brought it to the work, and observed it in the work, must also hold it to it, till the work be done. Charge it in the Name of God to stay; do not so great a work by the halves; say to it, VVhy foolish heart! If thou beg a while, and go away before thou hast thy alms, dost thou not lose thy labor? if thou stop before thou art at the end of thy journey, is not very step of thy travel lost? Thou camest hither to fetch a walk to Heaven, in hope to have a sight of the glory which thou must inherit; and wilt thou stop when thou art almost at the top of the Hill? and turn again before thou hast taken thy survey? Thou camest hither in hope to speak with God, and wilt thou go before thou hast seen him? Thou camest to
<pb n="788" facs="tcp:61132:441"/>
bathe thy self in the streams of Consolation, and to that end didst uncloath thy self of thy Earthly thoughts; and wilt thou put a foot in, and so be gone? Thou camest to spie out the Land of Promise; O go not back without the bunch of Grapes, which thou maist shew to thy Brethren, when thou comest home, for their Confirmation and Encouragement; till thou canst tell them by experience, That it is a Land flowing with Wine and Oyl, with Milk and Honey.<note place="margin">Psal. 104.15.</note> Let them see that thou hast tasted of the Wine, by the gladness of thy heart; and that thou hast been anointed with the Oyl, by the cheerfulness of thy countenance: Let them see that thou hast tasted of the Milk of the Land, by thy feeding, and by thy milde and gentle disposition; and of the Honey, by the sweetness of thy words and conversation. The views of Heaven would heal thee of thy sinfulness, and of thy sadness; but thou must hold on the Plaister, that it may have time to work: This Heavenly fire would melt thy frozen heart, and refine it from the dross, and take away the earthy part, and leave the rest more spiritual and pure; but then thou must not be presently gone, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore it have time, either to burn or warm. Stick therefore to the work, till something be done; till thy graces be acted; thy af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fections raised, and thy soul refreshed with the delights above; or if thou canst not obtain these ends at once, ply it the closer the next time, and let it not go till thou feel the blessing. <hi>Blessed is that servant, whom his Lord, when he comes, shall finde so doing,</hi> Matth. 24.46.</p>

especially in meditating on the joyes of Heaven. To this end, Set apart one hour or half hour every day, wherein thou maist lay aside all worldly thoughts, and with all possible seriousness and reverence, as if thou were going to speak with God himself, or to have a sight of Christ, or of that blessed place; so do thou withdraw thy self into some secret place, and set thy self wholly to the following work: If thou canst, take <hi>Isaacs</hi> time and place, who went forth into the Field in the Evening to meditate: But if thou be a servant or poor man that cannot have that leisure; take the fittest time and place that thou canst, though it be when thou art private about thy labors.</p>
                        <p>When thou setst to the work, look up toward Heaven, let thine eie lead thee as neer as it can; remember that there is thine Everlast<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing Rest; study its excellency, study its reality, till thy unbelief be silenced, and thy Faith prevail<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> If thy judgment be not yet drawn to admiration, use those sensible helps and advantages which were even now laid down. Compare thy heavenly joyes, with the choicest on earth, and so rise up from Sense to Faith: If yet this meer con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sideration prevail not (which yet hath much force, as is before expressed,) then fall a pleading the case with thy heart: Preach upon this Text of Heaven to thy self; convince, inform, confute, instruct, reprove, examine, admonish, encourage, and comfort thy own soul from this Celestial Doctrine; draw forth those se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veral considerations of thy Rest, on which thy several affections may work, especially that Affection or Grace which thou intend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>est to act. If it be Love which thou wouldst act, shew it the love<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liness of Heaven, and how suitable it is to thy condition; if it be Desire, consider of thy absence from this lovely object; if it be Hope, consider the possibility and probability of obtaining it; if it be Courage, consider the singular assistance and encourage<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments which thou maist receive from God; the weakness of the enemy, and the necessity of prevailing; if it be Joy, consider of its excellent ravishing glory, of thy interest in it, and of its cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainty, and the neerness of the time when thou must possess it. Urge these considerations home to thy heart; whet them with all possible seriousness upon each affection: If thy heart draw back, force it to the work; if it loyter, spur it on; if it step aside, com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mand it in again; if it would slip away, and leave the work, use thine authority; keep it close to the business, till thou have ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tained

thine end: Stir not away, if it may be, till thy Love do flame, till thy Joy be raised, or till thy Desire or other Graces be lively acted. Call in assistance also from God; mix Ejaculations with thy Cogitations and Soliloquies: Till having seriously plead<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed the case with thy heart, and reverently pleaded the case with God; thou have pleaded thy self from a clod to a flame, from a forgetful sinner, to a mindful lover; from a lover of the world, to a thirster after God; from a fearful coward, to a resolved Christian; from an unfruitful sadness, to a joyful life. In a word, What will not be done one day, do it the next, till thou have pleaded thy heart from Earth to Heaven; from conversing below, to a walking with God; and till thou canst lay thy heart to rest, as in the bosom of Christ, in this Meditation of thy full and Ever<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lasting Rest.</p>

How neer is that most blessed joyful day? it comes apace, even he that comes will come, and will not tarry: Though my Lord do seem to delay his coming, yet a little while and he will be here: What is a few hundred years when they are over? How surely will his sign ap<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>pear? and how suddenly will he seize upon the careless world? Even as the lightning that shines from East to West in a moment!

                        <p>This is that Joy which was procured by Sorrow; this is that Crown which was procured by the Cross; my Lord did weep, that now my tears might be wip't away; he did bleed that I might now rejoyce; he was forsaken, that I might not now be forsaken; he did then dye, that I might now live. This weeping, wounded Lord, shall I behold, this bleeding Saviour shall I see, and live in him that dyed for me: O free Mercy that can exalt so vile a wretch! free to me, though dear to Christ! Free Grace that hath chosen me, when thousands were forsaken! when my companions in sin must burn in hell, and I must here rejoyce in Rest! here must I live with all these Saints! O comfortable meeting of my old acquaintance! with whom I prayed, and wept, and suffered; with whom I spoke of this day and place! I see the Grave could not contain you, the sea and earth must give up their dead; the same love hath redeemed and saved you also: This is not like our Cottages of Clay, nor like our Prisons, or earthly Dwellings: This voyce of Joy is not like our old complainings, our groans, our sighes, our impatient moans; nor this melodious praise like our scorns and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vilings, nor like the oathes and curses which we heard on earth; this body is not like the body we had, nor this soul like the soul we had, nor this life like the life that then we lived: we have chang<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed our place, we have changed our state, our cloathes, our thoughts, our looks, our Language: we have changed our company for the greater part, and the rest of our company is changed it self: Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore a Saint was weak and despised, so full of pride and peevishness

and other sins, that we could scarce oft-times discern their graces: But now how glorious a thing is a Saint! where is now their body of sin, which wearyed themselves and those about them? Where are now our different Judgments? our reproachful titles? our divided spirits? our exasperated passions? our strange looks? our uncharitable censures? Now we are all of one judgment of one name, of one heart, of one house, and of one glory. O sweet re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>concilement!

Now our diffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rences shall be dashed in our teeth no more, nor the Gospel re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proached through our folly or scandall.

O my soul! what wantest thou here to provoke thy love?

It is he that brought thee seasonably and safety into the world: It is he that nursed thee up in thy tender infancy, and helped thee when thou couldst not help thy self: He taught thee to go, to speak, to read, to understand: He taught thee to know thy self and him; he opened thee that first window whereby thou

Hast thou forgotten the time<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> nay the many, very many times, when he found thee in secret all in tears; when he heard thy dolorous sighes and groans; and left all to come and comfort thee? when he came in upon thee, and took thee up, as it were in his armes, and asked thee, Poor soul what doth aile thee? dost thou weep, when I have wept so much? Be of good cheer; thy wounds are saving, and not deadly. It is I that have made them, who mean thee no hurt, Though I let out thy blood, I will not let out thy life.</p>
                        <p>O me thinks I remember yet his voice, and feel those embracing armes that took me up, How gently did he handle me! how care<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fully did he dress my wounds and binde them up! Me thinks I hear him still saying to me, Poor sinner, though thou hast dealt un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kindly with me, and cast me off; yet will not I do so by thee; though thou hast set light by me and all my mercies, yet both I and All are thine; what wouldst thou have, that I can give thee? and what dost thou want that I cannot give thee? If any thing I have will pleasure thee, thou shalt have it; If any thing in heaven or earth will make the happy, why it is all thine own; Wouldst thou have pardon? thou shalt have it, I freely forgive thee all the debt: wouldst thou have grace and peace? thou shalt have them both; wouldst thou have my self? why, behold, I am thine, thy friend, thy Lord, thy brother, thy husband, and thy head; wouldst thou have the Father? why I will bring thee to him; and thou shalt have him in and by me.—These were my Lords reviving words; These were the melting, healing, raising, quickening passages of love.

Have I made my self in the Gospel, a Lyon to thine enemies, and a Lamb to thee, and dost thou so over-look my Lamb like nature? Have I set mine arms and heart there open to thee, and wilt thou not believe but they are shut? why, if I had been willing to let thee perish, I could have done it at a cheaper rate, what need I then have done and suffered so much? what need I follow thee with so long patience and intreating? what dost thou tell me of thy wants? have I not enough for me and thee? and why dost thou foolishly tell me of thy unworthiness, and thy sin? I had not died, if man had not sinned? if thou wert not a sinner, thou wert not for me; if thou wert worthy thy self, what shouldst thou do with my worthiness? Did I ever invite the worthy and the righteous? or did I ever save or justifie such or is there any such on earth? Hast thou nothing? art thou lost and miserable? art thou helpless and for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lorn? dost thou believe that I am a sufficient Saviour? and wouldst thou have me? why then take me, Lo, I am thine; if thou be wil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling I am willing, and neither sin nor devils shall break the match.</p>

Nay how many a weak woman, or poor despised Christian have I seen, mean in parts, but rich in faith, who could rejoyce and triumph in hope of this inheritance? And shall I look upon it with so dim an eye? So dull a heart? So dejected a countenance? some small foretastes also I have had my self (though indeed small and seldome thorow mine own belief) and how much more de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lightful have they been, then ever was any of these earthly things?

                        <p>Consider also, O my soul; What a beauty is there in the im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perfect Graces of the spirit here? so great that they are called the Image of God:<note place="margin">Col. 3.10.</note> and can any created exceellencie have a more ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>norable title? Alas how small a part are these of what we shall enjoy in our perfect state? O how pretious a mercy should I esteem it, if God would but take off my bodily infirmities, and restore me to any comfortable measure of health and strength, that I might be able with cheerfulness to go through his work? How pretious a mercy then will it be; to have all my corruptions, quite removed, and my soul perfected; and my body also raised to so high a state, as I now can neither desire nor conceive? Surely as health of body, so health of soul doth carry an unexpressible sweetness along with it. VVere there no reward besides, yet every gracious act is a reward and comfort. Never had I the least

stirring of Love to God, but I felt a heavenly sweetness accompany<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing it: even the very act of loving was unexpressibly sweet. VVhat a happy life should I here live, could I but love as much as I would? and as oft, and as long as I would? Could I be all love, and always loving! O my soul; what wouldst thou give for such a life! O had I such true and clear apprehensions of God; and such a true understanding of his words as I desire; Could I but trust him as fully in all my streights: Could I have that life which I would have in every duty: Could I make God my constant desire and delight; I would not then envy the world their honors or pleasures; nor change my happiness with a <hi>Caesar</hi> or <hi>Alexander.</hi> O my soul, what a blessed state wilt thou shortly be in, when thou shalt have far more of these then thou canst now desire? and shalt exercise all thy perfected graces upon God in presence and open sight, and not in the dark, and at a distance, as now.</p>
                        <p>And as there is so much worth in one gracious soul, so much more in a gracious society, and most of all in the whole body of Christ on earth: If there be any true beauty on earth, where should it be so likely as in the Spouse of Christ?

Art thou not ashamed to complain so much of an uncomfortable life, and to murmur at God for filling thee with sorrows, when he of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fereth thee in vain the delights of Angels, and when thou treadest under foot these transcendent pleasures? Thou wilfully pinest away in grief, and art ready to charge thy Father with unkindness for making thee onely a vessel of displeasure, a sink of sadness, a skinful of groans, a snow ball of tears, a channel for the waters of affliction to run in, the fuell of fears, and the carcass which cares do consume and prey upon, when in the mean time thou mightest live a life of Joy; Hadst thou now but followed me close, and be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lievingly applyed thy self to that which I have spoken, and drunk in but half the comfort that those words hold forth, it would have made thee revive and leap for joy, and forget thy sorrows and di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>seases and pains of the flesh: but seeing thou judgest thy self un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>worthy of comfort, it is just that comfort should be taken from thee.</p>
                        <p>Lord, whats the matter that this work doth go on so heavily? Did I think my heart had been so backward to rejoyce? If it had been to mourn, and fear, and despair, it were no wonder: I have been lifting at this stone, and it will not stir, I have been pouring <hi>Aqua Vitae</hi> into the mouth of the dead: I hope, Lord, by that time it comes to heaven, this heart by thy Spirit will be quickned and mended, or else even those Joyes will scarce rejoyce me.</p>

O when shall I arrive at that safe and quiet Harbor, where is none of these storms and waves and dangers? when I shall never more have a weary, restless night or day!

When wars, and the calamities attending them, have been over, I have said,<note place="margin">Psal. 116.</note> Return now my soul unto thy Rest: But how restless a condition hath next succeeded? When God had given me the en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>joyment of Peace, and Friends, and Liberty of the Gospel; and had settled me even as my own heart desired; I have been ready to say, Soul take thy ease and rest: But how quickly hath Provi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence called me Fool? and taught me to call my state by another name? When did I ever begin to congratulate my flesh its felici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty, but God did quickly turn my tune? and made almost the same breath to end in groaning which did begin in laughter? I have thoughts oft-times in the folly of my prosperity, [Now I will have one sweet draught of Solace and Content;] but God hath dropped in the Gall, while the Cup was at my mouth. We are still weary of the present condition, and desire a change; and when we have it, it doth not answer our expectation; but our discontent and restlesness is still unchanged. In time of peace, we thought that war would deliver us from our disquietments; and when we saw the Iron red hot, we catched it inconsiderately, thinking that it was Gold; till it burned us to the very bone, and so stuck to our fingers, that we scarce know yet whether we are rid of it, or not. In this our misery, we long for peace; and so long were we strangers to it, that we had forgot its name, and begun to call it REST or HEAVEN: But as soon as we are again grown acquainted with it, we shall better bethink us, and perceive our mistake. O, why am I then no more weary of this weariness?<note place="margin">Jere. 50.6.</note> and why do I so forget my resting place? Up then, O my soul, in thy most raised and fervent desires! Stay not till this Flesh can desire with thee; its Appetite hath a lower and baser object. Thy Appetite is not sensitive, but rational; distinct from its; and therefore look
<pb n="820" facs="tcp:61132:465"/>
not that Sense should apprehend thy blessed object, and tell thee what and when to desire. Believing Reason in the Glass of Scripture may discern enough to raise the flame: And though Sense apprehend not that which must draw thy desires, yet that which may drive them, it doth easily apprehend. It can tell thee, that thy present life is filled with distress and sorrows, though it cannot tell thee what is in the world to come. Thou needest not Scripture to tell thee, nor Faith to discern, that thy head aketh, and thy stomack is sick, thy bowels griped, and thy heart grieved; and some of these, or such like, are thy daily case. Thy friends about thee are grieved to see thy griefs, and to hear thy dolorous groans and lamentations; and yet art thou loth to leave this woful life? is this a state to be preferred before the Celestial glory? or is it better to be thus miserable from Christ, then to be happy with him? or canst thou possibly be so unbelieving, as to doubt whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther that life be any better then this? O my soul! do not the dulness of thy desires after Rest, accuse thee of most detestable ingratitude and folly? Must thy Lord procure thee a Rest at so dear a rate, and dost thou no more value it? Must he purchase thy Rest by a life of labor and sorrow, and by the pangs of a bitter, cursed death? and when all is done, hadst thou rather be here without it? Must he go before to prepare so glorious a Mansion for such a wretch; and art thou now loth to go and possess it? must his blood, and care, and pains be lost? O unthankful, unwor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thy foul! Shall the Lord of glory be willing of thy company, and art thou unwilling of his? are they fit to dwell with God, that had rather stay from him? Must he crown thee, and glorifie thee against thy will? or must he yet deal more roughly with thy darling flesh? and leave thee never a corner in thy ruinous cottage for to cover thee, but fire thee out of all, before thou wilt away? Must every Sense be an inlet to thy sorrows? and every friend become thy scourge? and <hi>Jobs</hi> Messengers be thy daily in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>telligencers? and bring thee the Curranto's of thy multiplied calamities, before that Heaven will seem more desireable then this Earth? Must every joynt be the seat of Pain? and every Member deny thee a room to rest in? and thy groans be indited from the very heart, and bones, before thou wilt be willing to leave this flesh? Must thy heavy burdens be bound upon thy back? and thy so-intolerable Paroxysms become incessant? and thy in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>termittent
<pb n="821" facs="tcp:61132:465"/>
agueish woes be turned into continual burning Feavers? Yea, must Earth become a very Hell to thee, before thou wilt be willing to be with God? O impudent soul, if thou be not ashamed of this! what is loathing, if this be love? Look about thee, O my soul; behold the most lovely Creature, or the most desireable State; and tell me, Where wouldst thou be, if not with God? Poverty is a burden, and riches a snare: Sickness is little pleasing to thee, and usually health as little safe; the one is full of sorrow, and the other of sin. The frowning World doth bruise thy heel; and the smiling World doth sting thee to the heart: VVhen it seemeth ugly, it causeth loathing; when beauteous, it is thy bane; when thy condition is bitter, thou wouldst fain spit it out; and when delightful, it is but sugered misery and deceit: The sweetest poyson doth oft bring the surest death. So much as the world is loved and delighted in, so much it hurteth and endangereth the lover; and if it may not be loved, why should it be desired? If thou be applauded, it proves the most contagious breath; and how ready are the sails of Pride to receive such winds? so that it frequently addeth to thy sin, but not one cubit to the stature of thy worth: And if thou be vilified, slandered or unkindly used, methinks this should not entice thy love! Never didst thou sit by the fire of prosperity and applause, but thou hadst with it the smoke that drew water from thy eyes; never hadst thou the Rose with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out the pricks; and the sweetness hath been expired, and the beauty faded, before the scars which thou hadst in gathering it, were healed. Is it not as good be without the honey, as to have it with so many smarting stings? The highest delight thou hast found in any thing below, hath been in thy successful labors, and thy godly friends: And have these indeed been so sweet, as that thou shouldst be so loth to leave them? If they seem better to thee, then a life with God, it is time for God to take them from thee! Thy studies have been sweet, and have they not been also bitter? My minde hath been pleased, but my body pained; and the weariness of the flesh, hath quickly abated the pleasures of the Spirit.

The most precious Truth not apprehended, doth seem to be Error, and fantastick novelty: Every man that readeth, what I write, will not be at the pains of those tedious studies to finde out the truth, as I have been; but think it should meet their eyes in the very reading. If the meer writing of Truth, with its clearest Evidence, were all that were necessary to the apprehension of it by others, then the lowest Scholar in the School might be quickly as good as the highest. So that if I did see more then others, to reveal it to the lazy prejudiced world, would but make my friends turn enemies, or look upon me with a strange and jealous eye. And yet Truth is so dear a friend it self (and he that sent it much
<pb n="831" facs="tcp:61132:466" rendition="simple:additions"/>
more dear) that what ever I suffer I dare not stifle, or conceal it. O what then are these bitter sweet studies and discoveries, to the everlasting views of the face of the God of Truth? The Light that here I have, is but a knowing in part; and yet it costeth me so dear, that in a temptation I am almost ready to prefer the quiet silent night, before such a rough tempestuous day. But there I shall have Light and Rest together, and the quietness of the night without its darkness. I can never now have the Lightning without the Thunder, which maketh it seem more dreadful then delightful. And shouldst thou be loth then, O my soul, to leave this for the Eternal perfect Light? and to change thy Candle, for the glorious Sun? and to change thy Studies, and Preaching, and Praying, for the Harmonious Praises, and fruition of the Blessed God?</p>
                        <p>Nor will thy loss be greater in the change of thy company, then of thine imployment. Thy friends here have been indeed thy de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>light: And have they not been also thy vexation, and thy grief? They are gracious; and are they not also sinful? they are kinde and loving; and are they not also peevish, froward, and soon displeased? they are humble; but withal, alas, how proud! they will scarce endure to hear plainly of their disgraceful faults; they cannot bear undervaluing, or disrespect; they itch after the good thoughts, and applause of others; they love those best, that high<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liest esteem them: The missing of a curtesie, a supposed sleighting or disrepect; the contradicting of their words or humors, a dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ference in opinion, yea, the turning of a straw, will quickly shew thee the pride, and the uncertainty of thy friend. Their graces are sweet to thee, and their gifts are helpful; but are not their corrup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions bitter, and their imperfections hurtful? Though at a distance they seem to thee most Holy and Innocent; yet when they come neerer thee, and thou hast throughly tryed them, alas, what silly, frail, and froward pieces are the best of men! Then the knowledg which thou didst admire, appeareth clouded with ignorance; and the vertues that so shined as a Glow-worm in the night, are scarce<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly to be found when thou seekest them by day-light. VVhen temp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tations are strong, how quickly do they yield? what wounds have they given to Religion by their shameful falls?

dearest bosome friends, that have prayed and conferred with thee, and helped thee toward Heaven, and by their fervor, for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wardness, and heavenly lives, have shamed thy coldness, and earth<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liness, and dulness; whom thou hast singled out, as the choicest, from a world of professors; whom thou madest the daily com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>panions and delights of thy life; are not some of them faln to Drunkenness, and some to Whordome, some to Pride, Perfidious<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness and Rebellion, and some to the most damnable Heresies and Divisions? And hath thy very heart received such wounds from thy friends? and yet art thou so loth to go from them to thy God? Thy friends that are weak are little useful or comfortable to thee: and those that are strong are the abler to hurt thee; and the best if not heedfully used, will prove the worst. The better and keener thy knife is, the sooner and deeper will it cut thy fingers, if thou take not heed. Yea, the very number of thy friends is a burden and trouble to thee: every one supposeth he hath some in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terest in thee, yea the interest of a friend, which is not a little: and how insufficient art thou to satisfie all their expectations? When it is much if thou canst answer the expectations of one. If thou were divided among so many, as each could have but little of thee, so thy self and God (who should have most) will have none. And almost every one that hath not more of thee then thou canst spare for all, is ready to censure thee as unfriendly, and a neg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lecter of the duty or respects which thou owest them: And shouldst thou please them all, the gain will not be great; nor art thou sure that they will again please thee.</p>
                        <p>Awake then, O my drowsie soul, and look above this world of sorrows! Hast thou born the yoke of afflictions from thy youth, and so long felt the smarting rod, and yet canst no better understand its meaning? Is not every stroke to drive thee hence? and is not the voice of the rod like that to <hi>Elijah,</hi> What dost thou here? Up and away. Dost thou forget that sure prediction of thy Lord, <hi>In the world ye shall have trouble; but in me ye shall have peace?</hi> The first thou hast found true by long ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perience: and of the later thou hast had a small foretaste; but the perfect peace is yet before, which till it be enjoyed cannot be clearly understood.</p>
                        <p>Ah my dear Lord, I feel thy meaning; its written in my flesh; its engraven in my bones: My heart thou aymest at, thy rod doth
<pb n="825" facs="tcp:61132:469" rendition="simple:additions"/>
drive; thy silken cord of love doth draw; and all to bring it to thy self: And is that all, Lord? is that the worst? Can such a heart be worth thy having? Make it so Lord, and then it is thine; Take it to thy self, and then take me. I can but reach it toward thee, and not unto thee: I am too low; and it is too dull; This clod hath life to stir, but not to rise, Legs it hath, but wings it want<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth. As the feeble childe to the tender mother, it looketh up to thee, and stretcheth out the hands, and faine would have thee take it up. Though I cannot so freely say [My heart is with thee, my soul longeth after thee] yet can I say, I long for such a long<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing heart. The twins are yet a striving in my bowels: The spirit is willing; the flesh is weak, the spirit longs, the flesh is loth. The flesh is unwilling to lye rotting in the earth: The soul desires to be with thee. My spirit cryeth, Let thy Kingdom come, or else let me come unto thy Kingdom; but the flesh is afraid least thou shouldest hear my prayer, and take me at my word. VVhat fre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quent contradictions dost thou finde in my requests? because there is such contradiction in my self. My prayers plead against my prayers; and one part begs a denial to the other. No wonder if thou give me such a dying life, when I know not whether to ask for life or death. With the same breath do I beg for a reprival and removal: And the same groan doth utter my desires and my feares. My soul would go, my flesh would stay. My soul would faine be out, my flesh would have thee hold the door. O blessed be thy Grace that makes advantage of my corruptions, even to contradict and kill themselves. For I fear my fears, and sorrow for my sorrows, and groan under my fleshly groans: I loath my loth<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness, and I long for greater longings; And while my soul is thus tormented with fears and cares, and with the tedious means for attaining my desires, it addeth so much to the burden of my troubles, that my wearyness thereby is much increased, which makes me groan to be at Rest. Indeed, Lord, my soul it self also is in a straight, and what to chuse I know not well; but yet thou knowest what to give: To depart and be with thee, is Best; but yet to be in the flesh seems needfull. Thou knowest I am not weary of thy work, but of sorrow and sin I must needs be weary: I am willing to stay while thou wilt here imploy me, and to dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>patch the work which thou hast put into my hands: till these strange thoughts of thee be somewhat more familiar, and thou
<pb n="834" facs="tcp:61132:470"/>
hast raised me into some degree of acquaintance with thy self; But I beseech thee, stay no longer when this is done. Stay not till sin shall get advantage, and my soul grow earthly by dwelling on this earth, and my desires and delights in thee grow dead; But while I must be here, let me be still amending and ascending, make me still better, and take me at the best. I dare not be so impati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ent of living, as to importune thee to cut off my time, and urge thee to snatch me hence unready; because I know my everlasting state doth so much depend on the improvement of this life. Nor yet would I stay when my work is done; and remaine here sin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning when my brethren are triumphing: I am drowning in teares while they swim in joyes: I am weeping, while they are singing; I am under thy feet, while they are in thy bosome: Thy foot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>steps bruise and break this worm, while those Stars do shine in the Firmament of glory: Thy frowns do kill me, while they are quickened by thy smiles: They are ever living, and I am daily dying; Their joyes are raised by the knowledg of their endlesness, my griefs are enlarged by still expecting more; while they possess but one continued pleasure; I bear the successive assaults of fresh calamities; One billow fals in the neck of another, and when I am rising up from under one, another comes and strikes we down. Yet I am thy childe as well as they; Christ is my head as well as theirs: why is there then so great a distance? How differently dost thou use us when thou art Father to us all? They sit at thy table, whilst I must stand without the doors. But I acknowledg the equity of thy ways: Though we all are children, yet I am the Prodigal; and therefore meeter in this remote country to feed on husks, while they are always with thee and possess thy glory. Though we all are members, yet not the same: they are the tongue and fitter to praise thee; They are the hands and fitter for thy service, I am the feet and therefore meeter to tread on earth, and move in dirt; but unfit to stand so neer the head as they. They were once themselves in my condition; and I shall shortly be in theirs. They were of the lowest forme, before they came to the highest; They suffered before they reigned; They came out of great tribulation, who now are standing before thy throne: And shall not I be content to come to the crown as they did? and to drink of their cup, before I sit with them in the Kingdom? The blessed souls of <hi>David, Paul, Austin, Calvin, Perkins,

Bayne, Parker, Ames, Bradshaw, Dod, Preston, Stoughton, Sibbes,</hi> with all the spirits of the just made perfect, were once on earth as I am now, as far from the sight of thy face and glory; as deep in sorrows; as weak and sick and full of pains as I; Their souls were longer imprisoned in corruptible flesh: I shall go but the way that they all did go before me: Their house of clay did fall to dust, and so must mine. The world they are now in, was as strange to them before they were there, as it is to me. And am I better then all these pretious souls? I am contented there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore, O my Lord, to stay thy time, and go thy way, so thou wilt exalt me also in thy season, and take me into thy barn when thou seest me ripe. In the mean time, I may desire, though I may not repine; I may look over the hedge, though I may not break over; I may believe and Wish, though not make any sinful hast; I am content to wait, but not to lose thee; And when thou seest me too contented with thine absence, and satisfying and pleasing my self here below; O quicken up then my dull desires, and blow up the dying spark of love: And leave me not till I am able un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feignedly to cry out,<note place="margin">Psal. 42.1, 2.

And though Death of it self be unwelcome to Nature, yet let thy Grace make thy Glory appear to me so de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sirable, that the King of Terrors may be the Messenger of my Joy; O let not my soul be ejected by violence, and dispossessed of its Habitation against its will, but draw it forth to thy Self by the se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cret power of thy Love, as the Sun-shine in the Spring draws forth the creatures from their Winter Cells; meet it half way, and entice it to thee, as the Loadstone doth the Iron, and as the greater flame doth attract the less: Dispel therefore the Clouds that hide from me thy Love, or remove the Scales that hinder mine Eyes from beholding Thee; for onely the beames that stream from thy Face, and the foresight or taste of thy great Salvation can make a soul unfainedly to say, <hi>Now Let thy Servant depart in peace</hi>; Reading and Hearing will not serve, my meat is not sweet to my Ear, or to my Eye, it must be a taste or feeling that must en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tice away my soul: Though arguing is the means to bend my will, yet if thou bring not the matter to my hand, and by the influence of thy Spirit make it not effectual, I shall never reason my soul to be willing to depart. In the Winter, when its cold and dirty without, I am loth to leave my Chamber and fire; but in the Sum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer, when all is warm and green, I am loth to be so confined; shew me but the Summer fruits and pleasures of thy Paradise, and I shall freely quit my earthly Cell. Some pleasure I have in my Books, my friends, and in thine Ordinances; till thou hast given me a taste of something more sweet, my soul will be loth to part with these: The Traveller will hold his Cloak the faster when the windes do bluster, and the storms assault him, but when the Sun shines hot, he will cast it off as a burthen; so will my soul, when thou frownest, or art strange, be lother to leave this garment of flesh; but thy smiles would make me leave it as my prison; but it is not thy ordinary discoveries that will here suffice; as the work is greater, so must be thy help: O turn these fears into strong de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sires, and this lothness to dye, into longings after thee! while I must be absent from thee, let my soul as heartily groan under thine ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sence, as my pained body doth under its want of health: And let not those groans be counterfeit or constrained, but let them come from a longing, loving heart, unfeignedly judging it best to depart and be with Christ: And if I have any more time to spend on
<pb n="837" facs="tcp:61132:471" rendition="simple:additions"/>
earth, let me live as without the world in thee, as I have sometime lived as without thee in the world. O suffer me not to spend in strangeness to thee another day of this my Pilgrimage! while I have a thought to think, let me not forget thee; while I have a tongue to move, let me mention thee with delight; while I have a breath to breathe, let it be after thee, and for thee; while I have a knee to bend, let it bow daily at thy Footstool: and when by sickness thou confinest me to my Couch, do thou make my bed, and number my pains, and put all my tears into thy Bottle. And as when my spirit groaned for my sins, the flesh would not second it, but desired that which my spirit did abhor; so now, when my flesh doth groan under its pains, let not my spirit second it, but suffer the flesh to groan alone, and let me desire that day which my flesh abhorreth, that my friends may not with so much sorrow wait for the departure of my soul, as my soul with joy shall wait for its own departure, and then let me dye the death of the Righteous, and let my last end be as his, even a removall to that Glory that shall never end: Send forth thy Convoy of Angels for my departing soul, and let them bring it among the perfected spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rits of the Just, and let me follow my dear friends that have died in Christ before me; und when my friends are weeping over my Grave, let my spirit be reposed with thee in Rest; and when my Corps shall lye there rotting in the dark, let my soul be in the Inheritance of the Saints in Light: And O thou that numberest the very hairs of my head, do thou number all the dayes that my body lyes in the dust; and thou that writest all my members in thy Book, do thou keep an account of all my scattered bones: and hasten, O my Saviour, the time of thy return, send forth thine Angels, and let that dreadful, joyful Trumpet sound; de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lay not, lest the living give up their hopes; delay not, lest earth should grow like hell, and lest thy Church by division be crumbled all to dust, and dissolved by being resolved into individual unites: Delay not, lest thine enemies get advantage of thy Flock, and lest Pride and Hypocrisie, and Sensuality, and Unbelief should prevail against thy little Remnant, and share among them thy whole Inheritance, and when thou comest thou finde not Faith on the earth.

                  <p>
                     <seg rend="decorInit">T</seg>Hus, Reader, I have given thee my best advice, for the attaining and maintaining a Heavenly Conver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sation. The maner is imperfect, and too much mine own; but for the main matter, I dare say, I received it from God. From him I deliver it thee, and his charge I lay upon thee, That thou entertain and practise it. If thou canst not do it methodically and fully, yet do it as thou canst; onely, be sure thou do it seriously and frequently. If thou wilt believe a man that hath made some small tryal of it, thou shalt finde, it will make thee another man, and elevate thy soul, and clear thine understanding, and polish thy conversation, and leave a pleasant savor upon thy heart; so that thy own experience will make thee confess, That one hour thus spent will more effectu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally revive thee, then many in bare external duties; and a day in these contemplations will afford thee truer content, then all the glory and riches of the Earth. Be acquainted with this work, and thou wilt be (in some remote sort) acquainted with God: Thy joyes will be spiritual, and prevalent, and lasting, according to the nature of their Blessed Object; thou wilt have comfort in life, and comfort in death: VVhen thou hast neither wealth, nor health, nor the pleasure of this world, yet wilt thou have comfort: Comfort without the presence, or help of any Friend, without a Minister, without a Book, when all means are denied thee, or taken from thee, yet maist thou have vigorous, real comfort. Thy
<pb n="840" facs="tcp:61132:473"/>
graces will be mighty, and active, and victorious; and the daily joy which is thus fetcht from Heaven, will be thy strength. Thou wilt be as one that standeth on the top of an exceeding high Mountain; he looks down on the world as if it were quite below him: How small do the Fields, and VVoods, and Countreys, seem to him? Cities and Towns seem but little spots. Thus despicably wilt thou look on all things here below. The greatest Princes will seem below thee but as Grashoppers; and the busie, contentious, coveteous world, but as a heap of Ants. Mens threatnings will be no terror to thee; nor the honors of this world, any strong enticement: Temptations will be more harm<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>less, as having lost their strength; and Afflictions less grievous, as having lost their sting; and every Mercy will be better known and relished.</p>
                  <p>Reader, it is, under God, in thine own choice now, whether thou wilt live thus blessed, or not; and whether all this pains, which I have taken for thee, shall prosper or be lost. If it be lost through thy laziness, (which God forbid) be it known to thee, thou wilt prove the greatest looser thy self. If thou value not this Heavenly Angelical life, how canst thou say that thou valuest Heaven? And if thou value not it, no wonder if thou be shut out. The power of godliness lieth in the actings of the soul: Take heed that thou stick not in the vain deluding form. O man! VVhat hast thou to minde, but God and Heaven? Art thou not almost out of this world already? Dost thou not look every day, when one disease, or other, will let out thy soul? Doth not the Bier stand ready to carry thee to the Grave? and the VVorms wait to feed upon thy face and heart? What if thy Pulse must beat a few strokes more? and what if thou have a few more breathes to fetch, before thou breathe out thy last? and what if thou have a few more nights to sleep, before thou sleep in the dust? Alas, what will this be, when it is gone? And is it not almost gone already? Very shortly thou wilt see thy glass run out, and say thy self, My life is done! my time is gone! its past recalling! there's nothing now, but Heaven or Hell before me! O where then should thy heart be now, but in Heaven? Didst thou but know what a dreadful thing it is, to have a strange and doubtful thought of Heaven; when a man lies dying, it

would sure rowze thee up. And what other thoughts, but strange, can that man have, that never thought seriously of Heaven, till then? Every mans first thoughts are strange about all things: Familiarity and acquaintance comes not in a moment, but is the consequent of Custom, and frequent Converse. And strange<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness naturally raiseth dread, as familiarity doth delight. What else makes a Fish or a wilde Beast flie from a man; when do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mestick Creatures take pleasure in his company? So wilt thou flie from God (if thou knewest how) who should be thy onely happiness, if thou do not get this strangeness removed in thy life time? And is it not pity, that a childe should be so strange to his own Father, as to fear nothing more, then to go into his pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sence? and to think himself best, when he is furthest from him? and to flie from his face, as a wilde Creature will do from the face of a man? Alas, how little do many godly ones differ from the world, either in their comforts, or willingness to die? and all because they live so strange to the place, and Fountain of their comforts. Besides, a little verbal, or other outside duties, or talking of controversies and doctrines of Religion, or for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bearing the practice of many sins, how little do the most of the Religious differ from other men? when God hath prepared so vast a difference hereafter. If a word of Heaven fall in now and then in their conference, alas, how slightly is it, and customary, and heartless? And if their Prayers or Preaching have heavenly expressions, they usually are fetcht from their meer invention, or memory, or Books, and not from the experience, or feeling of their hearts. O what a life might men live, if they were but willing and diligent! God would have our joyes to be far more then our sorrows; yea, he would have us to have no sorrow, but what tendeth to joy; and no more then our sins have made necessary for our good. How much do those Christians wrong God and themselves, that either make their thoughts of God, the in-let of their sorrows, or let these offered joyes lie by, as neglected or forgotten? Some there be that say, It is not worth so much time and trouble, to think of the greatness of the joyes above; so we can make sure they are ours, we know they are great. But as these men obey not the Command of God, which requireth them to have their Conversation in Heaven, and to set their Affections on things above; so do they wil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fully
<pb n="842" facs="tcp:61132:474"/>
make their own lives miserable, by refusing the delights that God hath set before them. And yet if this were all, it were a smaller matter; if it were but the loss of their comforts, I would not say so much: But see what abundance of other mischiefs do follow the absence of these Heavenly De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lights.</p>
                  <p>First, It will damp, if not destroy, our very love to God; so deeply as we apprehend his bounty and exceeding love to us, and his purpose to make us eternally happy<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> so much will it raise our love: Love to God, and delight in him, are still conjunct. They that conceive of God, as one that desireth their blood and damnation, cannot heartily love him.</p>
                  <p>Secondly, It will make us have seldom and unpleasing thoughts of God; for our thoughts will follow our love and delight.</p>
                  <p>Thirdly, And it will make men to have as seldom and un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pleasing speech of God: For who will care for talking of that which he hath no delight in? What makes men still talking of worldliness or wickedness, but that these are more pleasant to them then God?</p>
                  <p>Fourthly, It will make men have no delight in the service of God, when they have no delight in God, nor any sweet thoughts of Heaven, which is the end of their services. No wonder if such Christians complain, That they are still backward to Duty; that they have no delight in Prayer, in Sacraments, or in Scripture it self: If thou couldst once delight in God, thou wouldst easily delight in duty; especially, that which bringeth thee into the neerest converse with him: But till then, no wonder if thou be weary of all; (further then some external excellency may give thee a carnal delight.) Doth not this cause many Christians to go on so heavily in secret duties? like the Ox in the Furrow, that will go no longer then he is driven, and is glad when he is unyoaked?</p>
                  <p>Fifthly, Yea, it much endangereth the perverting of mens
<pb n="843" facs="tcp:61132:474" rendition="simple:additions"/>
judgments, concerning the ways of God, and means of Grace, when they have no delight in God and Heaven. Though it be said, <hi>Perit omne judicium cum res transit in affectum,</hi> That Judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment perisheth, when things pass into Affection; yet that is but when Affection leadeth the Judgment, and not when it followeth. Affection holdeth its object faster then bare Judgment doth. The Soul will not much care for that Truth, which is not accompanied with suitable goodness; and it will more easily be drawn to believe that to be false, which it doth not delightfully apprehend to be good; which doubtless is no small cause of the ungodlies pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>judice, against the ways of God, and of many formal mens dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>like of extemporate Prayers, and of a strict observation of the Lords day: Had they a true delight in God, and heavenly Things, it would rectifie their judgments better then all the arguments in the world. Lose this delight once, and you will begin to quarrel with the Ordinances and Ways of God, and to be more offended at the Preachers imperfections, then profited by the Doctrine.</p>
                  <p>Sixthly, And it is the want of these Heavenly Delights in God, that makes men so entertain the delights of the flesh: This is the cause of most mens voluptuousness, and flesh-pleasing. The Soul will not rest without some kinde of delights: If it had nothing to delight in, either in hand, or in hope, it would be in a kinde of Hell on Earth, vexing it self with continual sorrow and despair. If a Dog have lost his Master, he will follow somebody else. Men must have their sweet Cups, or delicious Fare, or gay Apparel, or Cards, or Dice, or Fleshly Lasts, to make up their want of de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>light in God: (How well these will serve in stead of God, our fleshly youths will be better able to tell me, when we meet at Judgment.) If men were acquainted with this Heavenly Life, there would need no Laws against Sabbath breaking, and riotous<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness; nor would men need to go for mirth to an Alehouse or a Tavern: They would have a far sweeter pastime, and recreation neerer hand.</p>
                  <p>Seventhly also, This want of Heavenly Delights, will leave men under the power of every Affliction; they will have nothing to comfort them, and ease them in their sufferings, but the empty,
<pb n="844" facs="tcp:61132:475"/>
uneffectual pleasures of the flesh; and when that is gone, where then is their delight?</p>
                  <p>Eighthly, Also it will make men fearful, and unwilling to die: For who would go to a God, or a place that he hath no delight in? or, who would leave his pleasure here, except it were to go to better? O, if the people of God would learn once this Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venly Life, and take up their delights in God, whilest they live, they would not tremble, and be disconsolate at the tidings of death.</p>
                  <p>Ninthly, Yea, this want of Heavenly Delight, doth lay men open to the power of every Temptation: A little thing will tice a man from that which he hath no pleasure in.</p>
                  <p>Tenthly, Yea, it is a dangerous preparative to total Apostacy. A man will hardly long hold on in a way that he hath no delight in; nor use the means, if he have no delight in the end: But as a Beast, if you drive him a way that he would not go, will be turn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing out at every gap. If you be Religious in your actions, and be<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>come over to God in your outward Conversa<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>ion, and not in your delight, you will shortly be gone, if your trial be strong. How many young people have we known, who by good education, or the perswasion of friends, or for fear of Hell, have been a while kept up among Prayers, and Sermons, and good company, as a Bird in a Cage; when, if they durst, they had rather have been in an Alehouse, or at their sports; and at last, they have broke loose, when their restraint was taken off, and have forsaken the way that they never took pleasure in. You see then, that it is not a matter of indifferency, whether you entertain these Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venly Delights, or not; nor is the loss of your present comfort, all the inconvenience that follows the neglect.</p>
                  <p>And now Christian Friends, I have here lined you out a Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venly precious Work; would you but do it, it would make you men indeed: To delight in God, is the work of Angels, and the contrary is the work of devils. If God would perswade you now to make conscience of this duty, and help you in it by the blessed influence of his Spirit, you would not change your lives with the
<pb n="845" facs="tcp:61132:475" rendition="simple:additions"/>
greatest Prince on the Earth. But I am afraid, if I may judg of your hearts by the backwardness of my own, that it will prove a hard thing to perswade you to the work, and that much of this my labor will be lost. Pardon my jealousie; it is raised upon too many and sad experiments. What say you; Do you resolve on this Heavenly course, or no? Will you let go all your sinful fleshly pleasures, and daily seek after these higher delights? I pray thee hear, shut the Book, and consider of it, and resolve on the duty, before thou go further.—Let thy Family perceive, let thy Neighbors perceive, let thy Conscience perceive, yea, let God perceive it, that thou art a man that hast thy daily Conversa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion in Heaven. God hath now offered to be thy daily delight: Thy neglect is thy refusal. What? Refuse delight? and such a Delight? If I had propounded you onely a course of Melan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>choly, and Fear, and Sorrow, you might better have demur'd on it. Take heed what thou dost; Refuse this, and refuse all: Thou must have Heavenly Delights, or none that are lasting. God is willing that thou shouldst daily walk with him, and fetch in con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>solations from the Everlasting Fountain; if thou be unwilling, even bear thy loss: And one of these days, when thou liest dying, then seek for comfort where thou canst get it, and make what shift for contentment thou canst: Then see whether thy fleshly delights will stick to thee, or give thee the slip; and then Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>science, in despight of thee, shall make thee remember, That thou wast once perswaded to a way for more excellent pleasures, that would have followed thee through death, and have lasted thee to Everlasting. What man will go in rags, that may be clothed with the best? or feed on pulse, that may feed of the best? or accompany with the vilest, that may be a companion to the best? and admitted into the presence, and favor of the greatest? And shall we delight so much in our clothing of flesh? and feed so much on the vain pleasures of Earth? and accompany so much with sin and sinners? When Heaven is set open, as it were, to our daily view, and God doth offer us daily admittance into his presence? O how is the unseen God neglected! and the unseen Glory forgotten, and made light of? and all because they are unseen!<note place="margin">Heb. 11.1.</note> and for want of that Faith, which is the Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stance of things hoped for, and the Evidence of things that are not seen?</p>
                  <p>
                     <pb n="846" facs="tcp:61132:476"/>But for you, sincere Beleevers, whose hearts God hath weaned from all things here below, I hope you will value this Heavenly Life, and fetch one walk daily in the New <hi>Jerusalem!</hi> I know God is your Love, and your desire; and I know you would fain be more acquainted with your Saviour; and I know it is your grief, that your hearts are not more neer him; and that they do no more feelingly and passionately love him, and delight in him. As ever you would have all this mended, and enjoy your desires, O try this Life of Meditation on your Everlasting Rest! Here is the Mount <hi>Ararat,</hi> where the fluctuated Ark of your Souls must Rest. O let the World see by your Heavenly Lives, That Religion lieth in something more then Opinions, and Disputes, and a task of outward Duties: Let men see in you, what a Life they must aim at. If ever a Christian be like himself, and answerable to his Principles and Profession, it is when he is most serious, and lively in this Duty, when, as <hi>Moses</hi> before he died, went up into Mount <hi>Nebo,</hi> to take a survey of the Land of <hi>Canaan</hi>; so the Christian doth ascend this Mount of Contemplation, and take a survey by Faith of his Rest. He looks upon the glorious delect<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able Mansions, and saith, Glorious things are deservedly spoken of thee, O thou City of God: He heareth, as it were, the melody of the Heavenly Chore, and beholdeth the excellent employ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of those Spirits, and saith, Blessed are the people that are in such a case, yea, blessed are they that have the Lord for their God: He next looketh to the glorified Inhabitants of that Region, and saith, Happy art thou, O the <hi>Israel</hi> of God, a people saved by the Lord, the Shield of thy Strength, the Sword of thine Excellency. When he looketh upon the Lord himself, who is their Glory, he is ready with the rest, to fall down and worship him that liveth for ever, and say, Holy, holy, holy, Lord God Almighty, which was, and is, and is to come; Thou art worthy, O Lord, to receive Glory, and Honor, and Power. When he looks on the Glorified Saviour of the Saints, he is ready to say, <hi>Amen,</hi> to that new Song, <hi>Blessing, honor, glory, and power be to him that sitteth on the Throne, and to the Lamb for ever and ever</hi>; for he hath redeemed us out of every Nation by his blood, and made us Kings, and Priests to God. When he looketh back on the Wilderness of this VVorld, he blesseth the believing, patient, despised Saints; he pitieth the ignorant, obstinate, miserable
<pb n="847" facs="tcp:61132:476" rendition="simple:additions"/>
World; and for himself, he saith as <hi>Peter, It is good to be here</hi>; or as <hi>David, It is good for me to draw neer to God</hi>; for all those that are far from him, shall perish.</p>
                  <p>Thus as <hi>Daniel</hi> in his captivity, did three times a day open his window toward <hi>Jerusalem,</hi> though far out of sight, when he went to God in his Devotions; so may the believing Soul in this captivity to the flesh, look towards <hi>Jerusalem</hi> which is above: And as <hi>Paul</hi> was to the <hi>Colossians,</hi> so may he be with the Glorified Spirits,<note place="margin">Col. 2.5.</note> Absent in the flesh, but present in Spirit, joying in behold<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing their (Heavenly) Order. And as Divine <hi>Bucholcer</hi> in his last Sermon, before his death, did so sweetly descant upon those comfortable words, <hi>John</hi> 3.16. [<hi>Whosoever beleeveth in him shall not perish, but have Everlasting Life.</hi>] That he raised, and ravish<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed the hearts of his (otherwise sad) hearers: So may the Medi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tating Beleever do, (through the Spirits assistance) by his own heart. And as the pretty Lark doth sing most sweetly, and never cease her pleasant ditty, while she hovereth aloft, as if she were there gazing into the glory of the Sun; but is suddenly silenced when she falleth to the Earth: So is the frame of the Soul, most Delectable and Divine, while it keepeth in the views of God by Contemplation: But, alas, we make there too short a stay, but down again we fall, and lay by our musick.</p>
                  <p>But, O thou, the Merciful Father of Spirits, the Attractive of Love, and Ocean of Delights, draw up these drossie hearts unto thy self, and keep them there, till they are spiritualized and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fined; and second these thy Servants weak Endevors, and per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>swade those that read these lines, to the practice of this Delightful, Heavenly Work. And, O suffer not the Soul of thy most un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>worthy Servant to be a stranger to those Joyes which he unfold<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth to thy people, or to be seldom in that way, which he hath here lined out to others: But, O keep me while I tarry on this Earth, in daily serious Breathings after thee, and in a Believing, Affecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>onate Walking with thee: And when thou comest, O let me be found so doing; not hiding my Talent, nor serving my Flesh, nor yet asleep with my Lamp unfurnished; but waiting, and longing for my Lords return. That those who shall read these Heavenly Directions, may not read onely the fruit of my Studies, and the
<pb n="848" facs="tcp:61132:477"/>
product of my fancy; but the hearty breathings of my active Hope and Love: That if my heart were open to their view, they might there read the same most deeply engraven, with a Beam from the Face of the Son of God; and not finde Vanity, or Lust, or Pride within, where the words of Life appear without: That so these lines may not witness against me; but proceeding from the heart of the Writer, may be effectual through thy Grace, upon the heart of the Reader; and so be the savor of Life to both. <hi>Amen.</hi>
