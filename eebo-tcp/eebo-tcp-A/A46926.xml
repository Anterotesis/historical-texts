            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

So travelling for the space of two days, they came to a Thicket beset about with old withered and hollow Trees, wherein they were entertained with such dismal croaking of Night-Ravens, hissing of Serpents, bellowing of Bulls, and roaring of Monsters, that it rather seemed a Wilderness of Furies than a Worldly Habitation: By which they knew it to be the In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chanted Uale of <hi>Kalyb,</hi> the Lady of the Woods, so pacing to the middle of the Thicket, they came to a Cave, whose Gate and En<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>try was of Iron, whereon hung a Brazen Horn for them to wind that would speak with the Sorceress. First, Offering their Lamb with great Humility before the Postern of the Cave, then exemp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting all fear, they winded the Brazen Horn, the sound whereof seemed to shake the Foundation of the Earth: after which, they heard a loud and hollow voice, that uttered these words following:</p>
                        <l>Sir Knight, from whence thou cam'st, return,</l>
                        <l>Thou hast a Son most strangely born:</l>
                        <l>A Dragon that shall split in twain</l>
                        <l>Thy Ladies Womb with extream pain:</l>
                        <l>A Champion bold, from thence shall spring,</l>
                        <l>And practise many a wondrous thing.</l>
                        <l>Return therefore, make no delay,</l>
                        <l>For it is true what I here say.</l>
                        <p>This dark Riddle, or rather Mystical Oracle, being thrice re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peated in this Order, so much amazed them, that they stood in doubt whether it were best to return, or to wind the Brazen Horn the second time: but being perswaded by the other Knight, not to move the impatience of <hi>Kalyb,</hi> he rested satisfied with the Answer.</p>
                        <p>
                           <pb facs="tcp:29556:5" rendition="simple:additions"/>
Thus he left the Enchanted Cave to the Government of <hi>Kalyb,</hi> and with all speed dispatched his journey to his Native Habitation: but in the mean time his Lady being overcharged with extream pain and bitter anguish of her laboursome Womb, was forced either to the spoil of her Infant, or decay of her own Life: but regard<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing more the benefit of her Country than her own safety, and for the preservation of her Child, she most willingly committed her ten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der Womb to be opened, that her Infant might be taken forth alive.</p>
                        <p>Thus with the consent of many Learned Chirurgions, this most Noble and Magnanimous Lady was cast into a dead sl√©ep, her Womb cut up with sharp Rasors, and the Infant taken from the Bed of his Creation. Upon his Breast Nature had Pic<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tured the lively form of a Dragon, upon his right hand a blood-red Cross, and on his left Leg a Golden Garter: they named him <hi>George,</hi> and provided him thr√©e Nurses, one to give him suck, a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nother to keep him asleep, and the third to provide him Food. Not many days after his Nativity, the fell Enchantress <hi>Kalyb,</hi> being the utter Enemy to true Nobility, by Charms and Witchcrafts, stole this Infant from the careless Nurses: At which time (though all too late) her Noble Lord and Husband returned, in good hope to hear a joyful Delivery of his Lady, and a Comfort of a Son: But his wished Joy was turned into an unlook'd-for Sorrow, for he found not only his Lady dismembred of her Womb, but his young Son wanting, without any news of his abode, which woful spec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tacle bereaved him of his Wits, that for a time he stood sensless like weeping <hi>Niobe,</hi> but at last brake into these bitter Exclamati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons.</p>
                        <p>
                           <hi>O Heavens! why cover you not the Earth with Everlasting Night? Why do these accursed Eyes behold the Sun? O that the Waves of</hi> Oenipus <hi>might end my days, or like an Exile, joy in Banishment, where I may warble forth my Sorrows to the whispering Woods, that sensless Trees may Record my Loss, and untam'd Beasts grieve at my want. What Monster hath bereaved me of my Child? or what Tyrant hath been glutted with this Tragedy? O that the wind would be a Messenger, and bring me happy News of his abode: if he be drench'd in the deepest Seas, thither will I dive to fetch him up: if he be hid in the Caverns of the Earth, thither will I dig to see my son: or if he like a feathered Fowl lie hovering in the Air, yet thither will I flie and embrace him that never yet mine Eyes beheld. But why do I thunder forth my Exclamations thus in vain, when neither Earth nor Seas, nor any thing in Earth nor Seas will grant me Comfort for his Recovery!</hi>
                        </p>
                        <p>
                           <pb facs="tcp:29556:5" rendition="simple:additions"/>
Thus complained he many Months for the loss of his Son, and sent Messengers into every circuit of the Land, but no Man proved so fortunate as to return him happy tydings. He thus be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing frustrate of all good hopes, stored himself with Iewels, and so intended to Travel the wide World, either to speed in his Iourney, or leave his Boues in some Foreign Region. Thus leaving his Native Country, he wandred from place to place, till the Hairs of his Head were grown as white as Silver, and his Beard like the Thistle-down, but at last he ended his Travel in <hi>Bohemia,</hi> where, what for Age, and excessive Grief, he laid himself down un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der a Ruinated Monastery Wall and died, the Commons of that Countrey having knowledge of his name (by a Iewel he wore in his Bosom) engraved it in Marble stone right over his Sepulchre, where we leave him sleeping in peace, and return to his Son re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maining with <hi>Kalyb</hi> the Lady of the Woods in the Inchanted Cave.</p>
                        <p>Now twice seven years were fully finished since <hi>Kalyb</hi> first had in k√©eping the Noble St. <hi>George</hi> of <hi>England,</hi> whose mind many times thirsted after Honourable Adventures, and often attempted to set himself at Liberty, but the fel Enchantress tendering him as the apple of her Eye, appointed twelve sturdy Satyrs to attend his Person, so that neither Force nor Policy could further his in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tent. She kept him not to Triumph in his Tragedy, nor to spend his days in Slavery, but feeding his Fancy with all delights that Art and Nature could afford: for in him she fixed her chief Feli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>city, and Lusted after his Beauty: But he seeking to advance himself by Martial Discipline and Knightly Attempts, utterly re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fused her proffered Courtesie, and highly disdained to affect so wick<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed a Creature. She seeing her Love bestowed in vain, upon a time being in a secret corner of the Cave, began to flatter him in this manner.</p>
                        <p>
                           <hi>Thou knowest (my dear</hi> George) <hi>how worthily I have served thy Love, and how for thy sake I have kept my Viginity unstained, yet, thou more cruel than the Tygers bred in</hi> Libya, <hi>rejectest me. Dear Knight, fulfill my desires, and at thy pleasure, my Charms shall practice wondrous things, as to move Heaven to Rain Showers of Stones upon thy Enemies, to convert the Sun to Fire, the Moon to Blood, or make a Desolation of the whole World.</hi>
                        </p>
                        <p>The Noble Knight St. <hi>George</hi> considered in his mind that Love would make the wisest blind: Therefore by these her fair promises he hoped to obtain Liberty, the which moved him to make her this Answer.</p>

                           <hi>Most Wise and Learned</hi> Kalyb, <hi>thou Wonder of the World, I condescend to all thy desires, upon this condition, that I may be sole Protector and Governor of this Inchanted Cave, and that thou describe to me my Birth, my Name, and Parentage:</hi> Thereto the willingly consented, and began her Discourse in this manner. <hi>Thou art by Birth,</hi> said she, <hi>Son to the Lord</hi> Albert, <hi>High Steward of</hi> England, <hi>and from thy Birth to this day have I kept thee as my Child, within these solitary Woods:</hi> So taking him by the hand, she led him into a Brazen Castle, wherein remained as Prisoners, six of the bravest Knights of the World. <hi>These are,</hi> said she, <hi>Six worthy Champions of Christendom; The first is St.</hi> Dennis <hi>of</hi> France, <hi>the second St.</hi> Iames <hi>of</hi> Spain, <hi>the third St.</hi> Anthony <hi>of</hi> Italy, <hi>the fourth St.</hi> Andrew <hi>of</hi> Scotland, <hi>the fifth St.</hi> Patrick <hi>of</hi> Ireland, <hi>the sixth St.</hi> David <hi>of</hi> Wales; <hi>and thou art born to be the Seventh, thy Name being St.</hi> George <hi>of</hi> England, <hi>for so thou shalt be termed in time to come.</hi> Then leading him a little far<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, she brought him into a large fair Room, where stood seven of the goodliest St√©eds that ever Eye beheld. <hi>Six of these</hi> (said she) <hi>belong to the six Champions, and the seventh will I bestow upon thee, whose Name is</hi> Bayard: likewise she led him to another Room, where hung the Richest Armour in the World: so choosing out the strongest Corsset from her Armory, she with her own hands buckled it about his Breast, laced on his Helmet, and attired him with a Rich Caparison: then fetching forth a mighty Faulchion, she put it likewise in his hand. <hi>Now,</hi> (said she) <hi>thou art Armed in Richer Furniture than was</hi> Ninus <hi>the first Monarch of the World: thy Steed is of such Force and Invincible Power, that whilst thou art mounted on his back, there can be no Knight in all the World so hardy as to Conquer thee: thy Armour is of the purest Lydian Steel, that neither Weapon can pierce, nor Battle-Ax bruise: thy Sword which is called</hi> Ascalon, <hi>is made of the Cyclops, that it will separate and cut the hardest Flint, and hew in sunder the strongest Steel: for in the Pummel lies such precious Vertue, that neither Treason, Witchcraft, nor any other Violence can be offe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red thee, so long as thou wearest it.</hi>
                        </p>
                        <p>Thus the Lustful <hi>Kalyb</hi> was so blinded in her own conceit, that she not only bestowed the Riches of her Cave upon him, but gave him Power and Authority through a Silver Wand which she put in his hand, to work her own Destruction: for coming by a huge great Rock of Stone, this Ualiant Knight struck his Charming Rod thereon: whereupon it opened, and shewed apparently before his eyes a number of sucking Babes, which the Enchantress had
<pb facs="tcp:29556:6" rendition="simple:additions"/>
Murthered by her Witchcraft and Sorceries. <hi>Oh!</hi> (said she) <hi>this is a place of horror, where nought is heard but shrieks and ruful groans of dead Mens Souls: but if thy ears can endure to hear them, and thy eyes behold them, I will lead thee the way.</hi> So the Lady of the Woods, boldly stepping in before, little doubting the pretended policy of St. <hi>George,</hi> was deceived in her own practices: for no sooner entred she the Rock, but he struck his Silver Wand there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, and immediately it closed, where she bellowed forth exclamations to the sensless Stones without all hope of Delivery,</p>
                        <p>Thus this Noble Knight deceived the wicked Enchantress <hi>Kalyb,</hi> and set the other six Champions likewise at Liberty, who rendred him all Knightly Courtesies, and gave him thanks for their safe de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>livery. So storing themselves with all things fitting to their de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sires, took their Iourneys from their Enchanted Grove, whose Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceedings, Fortunes, and Heroical Adventures shall be shewed in the Chapters following.</p>

                        <p>Thus wearied she the time away, one while accusing Fortune of Tyranny, another while blaming the Falshood and Treachery of the English Knight, sometimes tearing her curled Locks of brist<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led Hair, that like a wreath of Snakes hung dangling down her deformed Neck, then beating her Breasts, another while rending her Ornaments, whereby she seemed more like a Fury than an earthly Creature, so impatient was this Enchantress <hi>Kalyb;</hi> but being frustrate of all hopes of Recovery, she began again to thunder forth these terms of Conjuration; <hi>Come, come, you Princes of the Elements; come, come, and tear this Rock in pieces, and let me not be inclos'd in this Eternal Languishment: Appear you shadows of black misty night,</hi> Magol, Cumoth, Helveza, Zontdma: <hi>Come when I call,</hi> venite fastinate inquam.

                        <p>This large proffer so encouraged the <hi>English</hi> Knight, that he vowed either to Redeem the King's Daughter, or else to lose his Life in that honourable Enterprize.

                        <p>After this, the Noble Knight, like a bold adventurous Champion, entred the Valley; where the Dragon had his Residence, who no sooner had a sight of him, but he gave such a terrible<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

Thus weltred he from his hideous Den, and so fiercely Assailed the sturdy Champion with his burnings Wings, that at the first Encounter he had almost felled him to the ground; but the Knight nimbly recovering himself, gave the Dragon such a thrust with his Spear, that it shivered in a thousand pieces; whereat the furious Dragon so fiercely <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

The fruit of the Tree being of such an excellent Uertue, that whosoever tasted thereof, should presently be cured of all manner of Diseases and Infirmities whatsoever. So it was the Noble Champions good and happy Fortune, a little to recover through the vertue of the Tree, and to espy an Drange which a little before had dropped down, wherewith he so refreshed himself, that he was in short time as sound as when he began the Encounter. Then kneeled he down, and made his Diuine Supplication to Heaven, That God would send him (for his dear Sons sake) such strength and agility of Body, as to stay the Furious and Terrible Monster; which being done, with a Bold Couragious Heart, he smo<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

The which being happily performed, the Noble Knight S. <hi>George</hi> for <hi>England,</hi> first yielding due honour to Almighty God for the Uictory, then with his good Sword <hi>Ascalon</hi> cut off the Dragon's Head, and pitched it upon the Trunchion of a Spear, which at the beginning of the Battel shivered against the Dragon's scaly back. During this long and dangerous Combat, his trusty Steed lay al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>together in a Swoon without any moving, which caused the En<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>glish Champion with all speed to crush the juice of an Orange into his mouth; the Uertue whereof presently expelled the Uenomous Poyson, and recovered his former strength again.</p>
                        <p>There was then remaining in the <hi>Aegyptian</hi> Court one <hi>Al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>midor,</hi> the Black King of <hi>Morocco,</hi> who long had prosecuted (in the way of Marriage) the Love of <hi>Sabra</hi> the King's Daughter, but neither by Policy, Means, nor Manhood, could he accomplish what his heart desired: and now finding opportunity to express his Treacherous mind, intended to Rob and spoyl St. <hi>George</hi> of his Uictory, whereby he thought to attain the gracious favour and sin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gular good liking of his Lady and Mistriss, who loathed his com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pany like the detested Crocodiles: even as the Wolf, though all in vain, barks at the Moon, so this Fantastical and Cowardly <hi>Al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>midor,</hi> through many Gifts and fair Promises, hired twelve <hi>Aegyp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tian</hi> Knights to beset the Ualley where St. <hi>George</hi> flew the burning Dragon, and by Force bereave him of his Conquest, and so when this Magnanimous Champion of <hi>England</hi> came riding in Triumph from the Ualley, expecting to have been entertained like a Conque<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ror, with Drums and Trumpets, or to have heard the Bells of <hi>Egypt</hi>

But when he saw the <hi>Egyptians</hi> bloody Tragedies, and how the happy Fortune of the English Knight had won the Honour of the Day, he accursed his Destiny, and accused the Queen of Chance with Cruelty for disappointing his pretended Enterprize: but having a heart still fraught with all wicked moti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, secretly Uowed in his Soul, to pradise by some other Trea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chery, S. <hi>George</hi>'s utter Confusion: so running before to the Court of King <hi>Ptolomy,</hi> not revealing what had hapned to the twelve <hi>Egyptian</hi> Knights, but crying, <hi>Victoria, Victoria,</hi> the Enemy of <hi>Egypt</hi> is slain. Then <hi>Ptolomy</hi> immediately commanded every Street of the City to be hung with Rich Arras and Embroider<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed Tapestry, and likewise provided a sumptuous Chariot of Gold, the wheels and other timber-work of the purest Ebony, the cove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring thereof of pure Silk, cross-barr'd with pure staves of Gold; likewise an hundred of the Noblest Peers of <hi>Egypt</hi> Attired in Crimson Uelvet, Mounted on Milk-white Coursers, with Rich Caparisons attended the coming of St. <hi>George.</hi> Thus were all appointed for his Honourable Entertainment, which they perfor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med in such Solemn Order, that I lack Eloquence to describe it: for when he first entred the Gates of the City, he heard such a melodious Harmony of Heavenly sounding Mulick, that it seem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed in his conceit to surpass the sweetness of all that ever he had heard before. Then they most Royally Presented him with a sump<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tuous and costly Ball of Gold, and after invested him in that E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bony Chariot, wherein he was Conducted to the Palace of King <hi>Ptolomy,</hi> where this Noble and Princely-minded Champion sur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rendred up his Conquest and Uictory to the hands of the Beaute<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous <hi>Sabra:</hi> where she with like Courtesie, and more Humility re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quited his Bounty: For at the first sight of the English Knight, she was so Ravished with his Princely Countenance, that for a time she was not able to speak: Yet at last taking him by the hand, she led him to a Rich Pavillion, where she Unarmed him, and with most Precious Salves imbalmed his Wounds, and with her Tears washed away the Blood: which being done, she furnished a Table with all manner of Delicates for his repast, where her Father was present, who enquired of his Country, Parentage, and Name: After the Banquet was ended, he enstalled him with the Honour of Knighthood, and put upon his feet a pair of Golden Spurs. But <hi>Sabra</hi> who fed upon the Banquet of his Love, con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ducted him to his Nights Repose, where she sate upon his Bed, and warbled forth most Heavenly Melody upon her Lute, till his

Senses were overcome with a sw√©et and sile<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">ÃÑ</g>nt sleep, where she left him for that Night, after his late dangerous Battel. No sooner did <hi>Aurora</hi>'s Radiant Blush display the Beauty of the East, and the Sun shew his Morning Countenance, but <hi>Sabra</hi> repaired to the English Champion's Lodging, and at his first uprising pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sented him with a Diamond of most rare and excellent Uertue, the which he wore upon his finger. The next that entred his Lodging, was the Treacherous <hi>Almidor,</hi> the Black King of <hi>Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rocco,</hi> having in his Hand a Bowl of Graekish Wine, which he offered to the Noble Champion St. <hi>George of England,</hi> but at the receit thereof, the Diamond the Lady gave him, which he wore upon his finger, waxed pale, and from his Nose fell three drops of Blood, whereat he started, which sudden Accident caused the King's Daughter to suspect some secret Poison compounded in the Wine, and thereupon so vehemently shrieked, that a sudden Up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>roar presently overspread the whole Court, whereby it came to the King's Intelligence of the proffered Treachery of <hi>Almidor</hi> against the English Champion: but so dear was the Love of the <hi>Egyptian</hi> King, to the Black King of <hi>Morocco,</hi> that no belief of Treachery could enter into his mind.</p>
                        <p>Thus <hi>Almidor</hi> the second time was prevented of his practice<g ref="char:punc">‚ñ™</g> whereat in Mind he grew more enraged than a chased Bore; yet thinking the third should pay for all, he expected a time wherein to work his wicked purpose, which he brought to pass in this man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner.</p>
                        <p>Many a day remained St. <hi>George</hi> in the <hi>Egyptian</hi> Court, some<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times Revelling among the Gentlemen, Dancing and Sporting with Ladies, other times in Tilts and Tournaments, with other Honourable Exercises: Likewise long and extream was the Love that Beauteous <hi>Sabra</hi> bore to the English Champion, of the which this Treacherous <hi>Almidor</hi> had Intelligence by many secret practises, and many times his Ears were witnesses of their Discourses. So upon an Evening, when the Gorgeous Sun lay level with the Ground, it was his Fortune to wander under a Garden Wall, to take the coolness of the Evenings Air, where unseen of the two Lovers, he heard their Amorous Discourses as they sate dallying under a Bower of Roses, Courting one another in this manner.</p>

Which Letter being no sooner Subscribed and Sealed with the Great Seal of <hi>Egypt,</hi> but St. <hi>George</hi> was dispatched with Embassage for <hi>Persia,</hi> with the Bloody Sentence of his own De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>struction, to the true Delivery whereof, he was sworn by the Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour of his Knighthood, and for his Pawn he left behind him his good Steed and his trusty Sword <hi>Ascalon</hi> in the keeping of <hi>Ptolomy</hi> the <hi>Egyptian</hi> King only taking for his Purvoy, and easie Travel one of the King's Horses.</p>
                        <p>Thus the Innocent Lamb Betrayed by the Wily Fox, was sent to the hunger-starved Lion's Den, being suffered not once to give his Lady and Mistriss understanding of his sudden depar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, but Travelled Day and Night through many a long and So<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>litary Wilderness, without any Adventure worthy the Memory, only hearing the dismal cry of Night-Ravens thundring in his Ears, and the fearful sound of screech-Owls in the Crevices of the Earth, and such like Messengers of Mischance, which foretold some Fatal Accident to be at hand: yet no Fear could daunt his Noble Mind, nor Danger, hinder his intended Travel, till he had sight of the Souldan's Palace, which seemed more like Paradise, than any other Earthly Habitation; for as the History reports, the Walls and Towers of the Palace were of the purist Marble stone, the Windows of Carved Silver-work, Enamelled with Indian Pearl, beset with Latten and Crystal Glass, the outward Walls and Buildings painted with Gold, the Pillars and Gates were all of Brass: about the Palace was a River of great breadth and depth, over the same stood a stately Bridge erected up with sumptu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous workmanship of Graven Images, under the Bridge a hundred Silver Bells were hung by Art, so that no Creature might pass unto the Palace, but they gave warning to the Souldan's Guard: at the end of the Bridge was built an Alabaster Tower, whereon stood an Eagle of Gold, his Eyes like the richest precious Stones, the brightness whereof glittered so much, that all the Palace did shine with the light thereof.</p>
                        <p>The day that St. <hi>George</hi> entred the Souldan's Court, was when the <hi>Persians</hi> Solemnly Sacrificed to their gods, <hi>Mahomet</hi> and <hi>Apollo,</hi> which unchristian Procession so moved the impatience of the English Champion, that he took the Ensigns and Streamers whereon the <hi>Persian</hi> gods were Pictured, and trampled them under his Feet: whereupon the Pagans presently fled to the Souldan for Succour, and shewed him how a strange Knight had despised their <hi>Mahomet,</hi> and trampled their Banners in the Dust. Here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>upon he sent an hundred of his Armed Knights to know the cause of that sudden uproar, and to bring the Christian Champion
<pb facs="tcp:29556:12" rendition="simple:additions"/>
bound, to his Majesty: but the <hi>Persian</hi> Knights were entertained with such a bloody Banquet, that some of their heads tumbled in the miry Str√©ets, and the Channels overflowed with streams of their blood, the Pavements of the Palace were overspread with slaughtered men, and the Walls be-sprinkled with purple gore: so Uidoriously he behaved himself against the Enemies of Christ, that e'er the Sun had declined the West, he brought to ground the most part of the Souldan's Knights, and enforced the rest 'like frighted sheep to flie to the Souldan for aid and succour, which as then re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mained in the Palace with a Guard of a thousand Soldiers: who at the report of this unexpened uproar, furnished his Soldiers with Habiliments of War, and came Marching from his Palace with such a mighty power, as though the strength of Christendom had b√©en to Invade the Territories of <hi>Asia.</hi> But such was the invin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cible Courage of Saint <hi>George,</hi> that he encountred with them all, and made such a Massacre in the Souldan's Court, that the Pave<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments were covered with slaughtered <hi>Persians,</hi> and the Paiace-Gate stuffed with heaps of slaughtered Pagans. At last the Larum Bells were caused to be rung, and the Beacons set on fire, whereat the Commons of the Country rose in Arms, and came flocking about the English Champion like swarms of Bees: whereat through his long Encounter, and the multitude of his Enemies, his never daun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted Courage was forced to yield, and his restless Arm wearied with Fight, constrained to let his Weapon fall to the Ground.</p>
                        <p>Thus he whose Fortitude sent thousands to wander about the Banks of <hi>Acheron,</hi> stood now obedient to the Mercies of his Ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mies, which with their brandishing Weapons and sharp edged Faul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chions environed him about.</p>
                        <p>
                           <hi>Now bloody-minded Monster</hi> (said the Souldan) <hi>what Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trey-man soever thou art, Jew, Pagan, or misbelieving Christian, look for a Sentence of severe punishment for every drop of blood thy unhappy hand hath here shed: first, thy skin with sharp Ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zors shall be pared from thy flesh alive. Next, thy, flesh with burning Irors seared from thy bones: Lastly, thy cursed Limbs drawn in pieces joynt from joynt, with untamed Horses.</hi> This bloody Iudgment pronounced by the Souldan, moved St. <hi>George</hi> to reply in this manner:</p>
                        <p>Great Potentate of <hi>Asia,</hi> I crave the Liberty and Law of Arms, whereto all the Kings of the Earth are by Dath ever bound: First, my Descent in my Native Countrey is of Royal Blood; and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore challenge I a Combate: Secondly, an Embassador am I from <hi>Ptolomy</hi> the King of <hi>Egypt,</hi> and therefore no Uiolence should be proffered me: Lastly, the Laws of <hi>Asia</hi> grant me safe Conduct
<pb facs="tcp:29556:13" rendition="simple:additions"/>
back to <hi>Egypt,</hi> therefore what I have done, <hi>Ptolomy</hi> must answer; And thereupon he delivered the Letter Sealed with the Great Seal of <hi>Egypt,</hi> the which was no sooner broken up and Read, but the Souldan's Eyes sparkled like Fire, and upon his Countenance ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peared the Image of Wrath and Discontent.</p>
                        <p>Thou art by the Report of <hi>Ptolomy</hi> (said the Souldan) a great contemner of our Gods, and despiser of our Laws; therefore his Pleasure is, that I should end thy days by some inhumane death, the which I swear by <hi>Mahomet,</hi> and all my Country Gods to ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>complish: and thereupon he gave him in keeping to an hundred of the Ianisaries, till the day of Execution, which was appointed within thirty days following.

                        <p>Thus Sorrow was his Company, and Despair his chief Soli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>citor, till <hi>Hyperion</hi> with his Golden Coach had thirty times rested in <hi>Thetis</hi>'s purple Palace, and <hi>Cynthia</hi> thirty times danc'dupon the Crystal Waves, which was the very time when as his moans should end, according to the severe and cruel Iudgment of the Souldan of <hi>Persia.</hi> But by what extraordinary means he knew not. So expecting every minute to entertain the wished Messenger of Death, heard afar off the terrible Roaring of two hunger-star<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved Lions, which for the space of four days had been restrained from their Food and natural sustenance, only to devour and staunch their hunger-starved bowels with the body of this thrice Renown<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed Champion: which cry of the Lions so terrified his mind that the Hair of his Head grew stiff, and his Brows sweat water thro' anguish of his Soul, so extreamly he feared the remorsless stroke of Death, that by Uiolence he burst the Chains in sunder where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>with he was bound, and rent the curled Tresses from his Head, that were of the colour of Amber, the which he wrapped about his Arms against the assault of the Lyons, for he greatly suspected them to be the Messengers of his woful Tragedy, which indeed was so appointed, for at the same instant they descended the Dun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>geon, brought thither by the Ianisaries, only to make a full pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riod of the Champion's Life: but such was the Invincible Forti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tude of St. <hi>George,</hi> and so politick was his Defence, that when the starved Lions came running on him with open Iaws, he vali<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>antly thrust his sinewed arms into their throats (being wrapped a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout with the hair of his head, whereby they presently choaked, and so he pulled out their hearts.</p>

This strange and woeful sp√©ech was no sooner ended, but she awaked from her Sleep, and presently reached forth her white hands, thinking to imbrace him, but she catched nothing but brit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle Air, which caused her to renew her former Complaints. <hi>Oh wherefore died I not in this my troublesome Dream</hi> (said the sor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rowful Lady) <hi>that my Ghost might have haunted those inhumane Monsters which have thus falsly betrayed the bravest Champion under the Cope of Heaven! for his sake will I exclaim against the ingratitude of</hi> Egypt, <hi>and like Ravished</hi> Philomel, <hi>fill every corner of the Land with Ecchoes of his wrong: my Woes shall ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceed the Sorrows of</hi> Dido <hi>Queen of</hi> Carthage, <hi>mourning for</hi> E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neas. With such like Passions wearied she the time away: till twelve Months were fully finished: At last her Father under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>standing what fervent Affection she bore to the English Champion, began in this manner to relate:</p>
                        <p>Daughter (said the Egyptian King,) I charge thee by the bond of Nature, and the true obedience thou oughtest to bear my Age, to banish and exclude all fond Affections from thy mind, and not thus to settle thy Love upon a wandring Knight, that is uncon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stant and without habitation: thou seest he hath forsaken thee, and returned into his own Country, where he hath Wedded a Wife of that Land and Nation: therefore I charge thee upon my Displeasure to Affect and Love the Black King of <hi>Morocco,</hi> that rightfully hath deserved thee in Marriage, which shall be short<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly Honourably holden to the Honour of <hi>Egypt;</hi> and so he departed without any Answer at all: By which <hi>Sabra</hi> knew he would not be crost in his Will and Pleasure: therefore she sighed out these lamentable words:</p>
                        <p>O unkind Father to cross the Affection of his Child, and to force Love where no Liking is? Yet shall my mind continue true unto my dear beloved Lord; although my Body be forced against Nature to Obey, and <hi>Almidor</hi> have the Honour of my Marriage-Bed, English <hi>George</hi> shall enjoy my true Uirginity. if ever he return again into <hi>Egypt;</hi> and thereupon she pulled forth a chain of Gold, and wrapped it seven times about her Ivory Neck. This (said she) hath been seven days steept in Tygers Blood, and seven nights in Dragons Milk, whereby it hath obtained such excellent Uertue, that so long as I wear it about my Neck, no Man on Earth can enjoy my Uirginity: though I be forced to the state of Marriage, and lie seven years in Wedlocks Bed, yet by the vertue of this Chain, I shall continue a true Uirgin.</p>
                        <p>Which words were no sooner ended, but <hi>Almidor</hi> entred her sor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rowful Chamber, and presented her with a Wedding Garment,

                           <p>After the Champion was unarmed, his stiff and wearied Limbs were bathed in new Milk and White-wine, he was conveyed to sweet smelling Fire made of Iuniper, and the fair <hi>Eglantine</hi> con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ducted by the Maidens of Honour to a private Chamber, where she was Disrobed of her Silvan Attire, and apparelled in a pall of purple Silk: in which Court of <hi>Thessaly</hi> we will leave this our Champion of <hi>France</hi> with his Lady, and go forward in the Dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>course of the other Champions, discovering what Adventures hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned to them during the seven years: But first how St. <hi>James</hi> the Champion of <hi>Spain</hi> fell in Love with a fair <hi>Jew,</hi> and how for her sake he continued seven years dumb: and after, if <hi>Apollo</hi> grant my Muse the gift, of Scholarism, and dip my Pen in the Ink of Art, I will not rest my weary hand till I have explained the honourable Proceedings of the Knights of <hi>England, France, Spain, Italy, Scotland, Wales,</hi> and <hi>Ireland,</hi> to the honour of Christen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom, and the dishonour of all the professed Enemies of Christ.</p>

in his Ravished Conceit, to shake the Uail of Heaven, and to move the deep Foundations of the fastned Earth: whereat his Horse gave such a sudden start, that he leaped ten foot from the place whereon he stood. After this, he heard the sound of Drums, and the chear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful Ecchoes of brazen Trumpets, by which the Ualiant Champion expected some honourable Pastime, or some great Tournament to be at hand; which indeed so fell out: for no sooner did he cast his vigilant Eyes toward the East-side of the City, but he beheld a Troop of well appointed Horse come marching through the Gates: after them twelve Armed Knights mounted on twelve Warlike Coursers, bearing in their hands twelve blood-red Streamers, whereon was wrought in Silk the Picture of <hi>Adonis</hi> wounded with a Boar: after them the King drawn in a Chariot by <hi>Spanish</hi> Ien<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nets, (which being a certain kind of Steeds ingendred by the Wind). The King's Guard were a <hi>100</hi> naked Moors with <hi>Turkish</hi> Bows and Darts, feathered with Ravens wings: after them marched <hi>Celestine</hi> the King of <hi>Jerusalem</hi>'s fair Daughter, mounted on a tame Unicorn. In her hand a Iavelin of Silver, and Armed with a Breast-plate of Gold, artificially wrought like the Scales of a Por<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cupine, her Guard were an hundred <hi>Amazonian</hi> Dames clad in green Silk: after them followed a number of Esquires and Gentlemen, some upon <hi>Barbarian</hi> Steeds, some upon <hi>Arabian</hi> Palfries, and some on foot, in pace more nimble than the tripping Deer, and more swift than the tamest Hart upon the Mountains of <hi>Thessaly.</hi>
                        </p>
                        <p>Thus <hi>Nebuzaradan</hi> great King of <hi>Jerusalem</hi> (for so was he cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led) solemnly hunted in the Wilderness of <hi>Judah,</hi> being a Country very much annoyed with Wild Beasts, as the Lyon, the Leopard, the Boar and such like; in which exercise, the King appointed, as it was Proclaimed by his chief Herauld at Arms, (the which he heard repeated by the Shepherd in the Fields,) that whosoever slew the first Wild-beast in the Forrest, should have in reward a Corsset of Steel so richly engraven, that it should be worth a thou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sand sheckles of Silver. Of which honourable enterprize when the Champion had understanding, and with what liberal bounty the adventurous Knight would be rewarded, his heart was fraught with invincible courage, thirsting after glorious Attempts, not only for hope of gain, but for the desire of honour, at which his illustrious and undaunted mind aimed, to eternize his Deeds in the memorable Records of Fame, and to shine as a Crystal Mirror to all ensuing Times. So closing down his Bever, and locking on his Furniture, he scoured over the Plains before the Hunters of <hi>Jerusalem,</hi> in pace more swift then the winged Winds, till he ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proached an old unfrequented Forrest, wherein he espied a huge and
<pb facs="tcp:29556:20" rendition="simple:additions"/>
mighty Wild Boar lying before his Mossy Den, gnawing upon the mangled joynts of some Passenger, which he had murthered as he travelled through the Forrest.</p>
                        <p>This Bore was of wonderful length and bigness, and so terri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble to behold, that at the first fight he almost daunted the Courage of the Spanish Knight: for his Monstrous head s√©emed ugly and deformed, his Eyes sparkled like a fiery Furnace, his Tusks more sharp than pikes of Steel, and from his Nostrils fumed such a vio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lent breath, that it seemed like a tempestuous Whirlwind, his Bri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stles were more hard than seven times melted Brass, and his Tail more loathsome than a wreath of Snakes: near whom when St. <hi>James</hi> approached, and beheld how he drank the blood of hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mane Creatures, and devoured their flesh, he blew his Silver Horn, which as then hung at the Pummel of his Saddle, in a Scarf of gr√©en Silk: whereat the furious Monster turned him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>self, and most fiercely assailed the Noble Champion, which most nimbly leaped from his Horse, and with his Spear struck such a violent blow upon the breast of the Boar, that it shivered into twenty pieces: Then drawing his good Fauchion from his side; he gave him a second encounter: but all in vain, for he struck as it were upon a Rock of Stone, or a Pillar of Iron, nothing hurt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful to the Boar: but at last with staring Eyes, (which sparkled like burning Steel) and with open Iaws, the greedy Monster as<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sailed the Champion, intending to swallow him alive: but the nimble Knight as then trusted more upon policy, than to fortitude, and so for advantage skipped from place to place, till on a sudden he thrust his keen-edged Cuttle-ax down his intestine throat, and so most valiantly split his heart in sunder. The which being ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>complished to his own desire, he cut off the Boar's head, and so pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sented the honour of the Combat to the King of <hi>Jerusalem,</hi> who was then with his mighty Train of Knights but now entred the Forrest: who having graciously received the gift, and bountifully fulfilled his promises, demanded the Champion's Country, his Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion, and place of his Nativity: who no sooner had intelligence that he was a Christian Knight, and born in the Territories of <hi>Spain,</hi> but presently his patience exchanged into a great fury, and by these words expressed his cankered stomach toward the Christian Champion.</p>
                        <p>
                           <hi>Knowest thou not, bold Knight</hi> (said the King of <hi>Jerusalem</hi>) <hi>that it is the Law of</hi> Iudah <hi>to harbour no uncircumcised Man, but either to banish him the Land, or end his days by some untimely Death?

So like a true enno<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">
                              <desc>‚Ä¢</desc>
                           </gap>led Knight, fearing neither the Threats of the Iews, nor the impartial stroke of the fatal Sisters, he gave this Sentence of his own Death. First, he requested to be bound to a Pine-tree with his Breast laid open naked against the Sun; then to have an hours respite to make his supplication to his Creator, and afterwards to be shot to death by a true Uirgin.</p>
                        <p>Which words were no sooner pronounced, but they disarmed him of his Furniture, bound him to a Pine-tree, and laid his Breast open, ready to entertain the bloody stroke of some unrelenting Maiden: but such pity, meekness, mercy and kind lenity lodged in the heart of every maiden, that none would take in hand or be the bloody Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ecutioner of so bravea Knight. At last the Tyrannous <hi>Nabuzaradan</hi> gave strict Commandment upon pain of Death, that Lots should be east betwixt the Maids of <hi>Juda</hi> that were there present, and so whom the Lot fell, she should be the fatal Executioner of the Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demned Christian. But by chanee the Lot fell to <hi>Celestine</hi> the King's own Daughter, being the Paragon of Beauty, and the fairest Maid then living in <hi>Jerusalem,</hi> in whose heart no such deed of cruelty could be harboured, nor in whose hand no bloody Wea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pon could be entertained. Instead of Death's fatal Instrument, she shot towards his Breast; a deep strained sigh, the true messenger of Love, and afterwards to Heaven, she thus made her humble supplication.</p>
                        <p>
                           <hi>Thou great Commander of Coelestial moving Powers, convert the cruel motions of my Father's mind, into a spring of pitiful tears, that they may wash away the Blood of this innocent Knight, from the habitation of his stained purple Soul. O</hi> Iudah <hi>and</hi> Ie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rusalem, <hi>within whose Bosoms live a Wilderness of Tygers, de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>generate from Nature's kind, more cruel than the hungry Cannibals, and more obdurate than untamed Lions! what merciless Tygers can unrip that Breast, where lives the Image of true Nobility, the very Pattern of Kinghthood, and the Map of a noble Mind? No, no, before my hand shall be stained with Christians Blood, I</hi>
                           <pb facs="tcp:29556:21" rendition="simple:additions"/>
                           <hi>will like</hi> Scilla, <hi>against all Nature, sell my Country's safety, or like</hi> Medea, <hi>wander with the Golden Fleece to unknown Nations.</hi>
                        </p>
                        <p>Thus, and in such manner complained the beauteous <hi>Celestine</hi> the King's Daughter of <hi>Jerusalem,</hi> till her sighs stopped the pas<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sage of her Speech, and her Tears stained the natural Beauty of her Rosie Cheeks: her Hair which glistred like to Golden Wires, she besmeared in dust, and disrobed her self of her costly Garments, and then with a Train of her Amazonian Ladies, went to the King her Father, where after a long suit, she not only obtained his Life, but Liberty, yet therewithall his perpetual Banishment from <hi>Jerusalem,</hi> and from all the Borders of <hi>Judah,</hi> the want of whose sight more grieved her heart, than the loss of her own life. So this Noble and Praise-worthy <hi>Celestine</hi> returns to the Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stian Champion that expected every minute to entertain the Sen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tence of Death, but this expectation fell out contrary: for the good Lady after she had sealed two or three Kisses upon his pale Lips, being changed through the fear of Death, cut the bands that bound his Body to the Tree into many pieces, and then with a flood of salt Tears, the motives of true Love, she thus revealed her mind.</p>
                        <p>
                           <hi>Most Noble Knight, and true Champion of Christendom, thy Life and Liberty I have gained, but therewith thy Banishment from</hi> Iuda, <hi>which is a Hell of Plorror to my Soul: for in thy bosome have I built my happiness, and in thy heart I account the Paradise of my true Love, thy first sight and lovely Countenance did ravish me, for when these eyes beheld thee mounted on thy Princely Palfry, my heart burned in Affection towards thee: therefore dear Knight, in reward of my Love, be thou my Champion, and for my sake wear this Ring, with this Poesie engraven in it, Ardeo affectione:</hi> and so giving him a Ring from her Finger, and therewithal a Kiss from her Mouth, she departed with a sorrowful sigh, in company of her Father and the rest of his honourable Train, back to the City of <hi>Jerusalem,</hi> being as then near the Setting of the Sun. But now St. <hi>James</hi> the Champion of <hi>Spain,</hi> having escaped the danger of Death, and at full liberty to depart from that unhappy Nation, he fell into many cogitations, one while thinking upon the true Love of <hi>Celestine</hi> (whose name as yet he was ignorant of) another while upon the cruelty of her Father: then intending to depart into his own Country, but looking back to the Towers of <hi>Jeru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>salem,</hi> his mind suddenly altered, for thither he purposed to go, haping to have sight of his Lady and Mistriss, and to live in some
<pb facs="tcp:29556:22" rendition="simple:additions"/>
disguised sort in her presence, and be his Loves true Champion a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainst all Comers. So gathering certain Black-berries from the Trees he coloured his Body all over like a Blackmoor: but yet considering that his Countrey Speech would discover him, inten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded likewise to continue dumb all the time of his Residence in Je<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rusalem.</p>
                        <p>So all things ordered according to his desire, he took his Iour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ney to the City, where with signs and other motions of dumbness he declared his intent, which was to be entertained in the Court, and to spend his time in the Service of the King. Whose Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tenance when the King beheld, which seemed of the natural colour of the Moors, he little mistrusted him to be the Christian Champi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on whom before he greatly envied, but accounted him one of the bravest Indian Knights that ever his eye beheld: therefore he in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stalled him with the honour of Knighthood, and appointed him to be one of his Guard, and likewise his Daughters only Champi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on. Thus when St. <hi>James</hi> of <hi>Spain</hi> saw himself invested in that honourable place, his soul was ravished with such exceeding joy, that he thought no pleasure comparable to his, no place of <hi>Elysium</hi> but the Court of <hi>Jerusalem,</hi> and no goodness but his beloved <hi>Ce<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lestine.</hi>
                        </p>
                        <p>Long continued he dumb, casting forth many a loving sigh in the presence of his Lady and Mistress, not knowing how to reveal the secrets of his mind.</p>
                        <p>So upon a time, there arrived in the Court of <hi>Nabuzaradan,</hi> the King of <hi>Arabia,</hi> with the Admiral of <hi>Babylon,</hi> both presuming upon the Love of <hi>Celestine,</hi> and craving her in the way of Mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riage, but she exempted all their motions of Love from her chast mind, only building her thoughrs upon the <hi>Spanish</hi> Knight, which she supposed to be in his own Countrey.</p>
                        <p>At whose melancholy passions her importunate Suitors, the King of <hi>Arabia,</hi> and the Admiral of <hi>Babylon</hi> marvelled: and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore intended upon an Evening to present her with some rare devi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed Mask. So choosing out fit Consorts for their Courtly Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stimes, of which number the King of <hi>Arabia</hi> was chief, and first Leader of the Train, the great Admiral of <hi>Babylon</hi> was the second, and her own Champion St. <hi>James,</hi> the third, who was called in the Court by the name of the <hi>Dumb Knight;</hi> in this manner the Mask was performed.</p>
                        <p>First entred a most excellent Consort of Musick, after them the aforesaid Maskers in cloath of Gold, and most curiously imbroi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dered, and daunced a course about the Hall, at the end whereof the King of <hi>Arabia</hi> presented <hi>Celestine</hi> with a costly Sword, at the Hilt
<pb facs="tcp:29556:22" rendition="simple:additions"/>
whereof hung a Silver Glove, and upon the point was erected a Golden Crown: Then the Musick sounded another Course, of which the Idmiral of <hi>Babylon</hi> was Leader, who presented her with a Uesture of pure Silk of the colour of the Rain-bow, brought in by <hi>Diana, Venus</hi> and <hi>Juno:</hi> which being done, the Musick sounded the third time, in which course St. <hi>James,</hi> tho' unknown, was the Leader of the Dance, who at the end thereof presented <hi>Celestine</hi> with a Garland of sweet Flowers, which was brought in by the three Graces, and put upon her head. Afterwards the Christian Champion intending to discover himself unto his Lady and Mistress, took her by the lilly-hand, and led her a stately Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>risco Dance. which was no sooner finished, but he offered her the Diamond Ring which she gave him at his departure in the Woods, the which she presently knew by the Poesic, and shortly after had intelligence of his long continued Dumbness, his counterfeit Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lour, his changing of Nature, and the great danger he put himself to for her sake: which caused her with all the speed she could possi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bly make, to break off Company, and to retire into a Chamber which she had by, where the same Evening she had a long Conference with her true and faithful Lover and adventurous Champion: and to conclude, they made some agreement betwixt them, that the same night unknown to any in the Court, she bad <hi>Jerusalem</hi> adieu, and by the light of <hi>Cynthia's</hi> glistering Beams stole from her Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther's Palace, where in company of none but St. <hi>James,</hi> she took her Iourney towards the Countrey of <hi>Spain.</hi> But this Noble Knight by Policy prevented all ensuing Dangers, for he shod his Horse backwards, whereby when they were missed in the Court, they might be followed the contrary way.</p>
                        <p>By this means escaped the two Lovers from the Fury of the Jews, and arrived safely in <hi>Spain,</hi> in the City of <hi>Sevil,</hi> wherein the brave Champion St. <hi>James</hi> was born: where now we leave them for a time to their own contented minds.

                        <p>IT was the same time of the year when the Earth was newly deckt with the Summer's Livery, when the Noble and Heroical minded Champion St. <hi>Anthony</hi> of <hi>Italy</hi> Arrived in <hi>Thracia,</hi> where he spent his seven years Travels to the Honour of his Country, the Glory of God, and to his own still lasting Memory: for after he had wandred through Woods and Wildernesses, by Hills and Dales, by Caves and Dens, and other unknown Passages, he ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rived at last upon the top of an high and steep Mountain, whereon stood a wonderful huge and strong Castle, which was kept by the most Mighty Gyant under the cope of Heaven, whose puissant force all <hi>Thrace</hi> could not overcome, nor once attempt to withstand, but with the danger of their whole Countrey. The Gyant's name was <hi>Blanderon,</hi> his Castle of the purest Marble-stone, his Gates of yellow Brass, and over the principal Gate were graven these Uer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ses following.</p>
                        <lg>
                           <l>Within this Castle lives the Scourge of Kings,</l>
                           <l>A surious Gyant, whose unconquer'd Power,</l>
                           <l>The <hi>Thracian</hi> Monarch in Subjection brings,</l>
                           <l>And keeps his Daughters Prisoners in his Power:</l>
                           <l>Seven Damsels fair this Monstrous Gyant keeps,</l>
                           <l>That sings him Musick while he Nightly sleeps.</l>

                           <l>This most Intestine Gyant still survives:</l>

                           <l>When up this steep Mountain they do clime.</l>

                        <p>After he had read what was written over the Gate, desire of Fame so incouraged him, and the thirst of Honour so imboldned his Ualiant mind, that he either vowed to redeem those Ladies from their servitude, or die with honour by the fury of the Gyant. So going to the Castle Gate, he struck so vehemently thereon, with the Pummel of his Sword, that it sounded like a Thunder-clap: whereat <hi>Blanderon</hi> suddenly started up being fast asleep close by a Fountains side, and came pacing forth of the Gate, with an Dak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tree upon his Neck: who at the sight of the <hi>Italian</hi> Champion so lightly flourished it about his head, as though it had been a little Cuttle-ax, and with these words gave the Noble Champion enter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainment.</p>
                        <p>What Fury hath incensed thy overboldned mind (proud Pincock) thus to adventure thy f√©eble force against the violence of my strong Arms? I tell th√©e hadst thou the strength of <hi>Hercules,</hi> who bore the Mountain <hi>Atlas</hi> on his shoulders, or the policy of <hi>Ulvsses</hi> by which the City of <hi>Troy</hi> was ruinated, or the might of <hi>Xerxes,</hi> whose Multitudes drank up the Rivers as they passed; yet all too feeble, weak, and impotent, to encounter with the mighty Gyant <hi>Blanderon;</hi> thy force I esteem as a blast of wind, and thy stroaks as a few drops of Water: Therefore betake thee to thy Weapon, which I compare to a Bulrush, for on this ground will I mea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sure out thy Grave, and after cast thy feeble Palfry with one of my hands headlong down this steep Mountain.</p>
                        <p>Thus boasted the vain-glorious Gyant upon his own strength. During which time, the valorous and hardy Champion had alight<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed from his Horse, where after he had made his humble supplicati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on to the Heavens for his good speed, and committed his Fortune to the imperial Queen of Destiny, he approached within the Gy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ant's reach, who with his great Oak so nimbly bestirred him with such vehement blows, that they seemed to shake the Earth, and to rattle against the Wall of the Castle like mighty Thunder-claps, and had not the politick Knight continually skipped from the fury of his blow, he had been bruised as small as flesh unto the pot, for every stroak the Gyant gave, the root of his Oak entred at the least
<pb facs="tcp:29556:24" rendition="simple:additions"/>
two or three inches into the Ground. But such was the Wisdom and Policy of the worthy Champion, not to withstand the force of his Weapon, till the Gyant grew breathless, and not able through his long labour to lift the Oak above his head, and likewise the heat of the Sun was so intolerable (by reason of the extream heighth of the Mountain, and the mighty weight of his Iron Coat) that the sweat of the Gyant's brows ran into his eyes, and by reason he was so extream fat, he grew so blind, that he could not see to endure Combat with him any longer, and as far as he could perceive, would have retired or run back again into his own Castle, but that the <hi>Italian</hi> Champion with a bold Courage assailed the Gyant so fiercely, that he was forced to let his Oak fall, and stand gasping for breath, which when this Noble Knight beheld, with a fresh supply he redoubled his blows so couragiously, that they fell on the Gyant's Armour like a Storm of Winter's Hail, whereby at last <hi>Blanderon</hi> was compelled to ask the Champion Mercy, and to crave at his hands some respite of breathing: but his demand was in vain, for the Ualiant Knight supposed now or never to obtain the honour of the day; and therefore rested not his weary Arm, but redoubled blow after blow, till the Gyant for want of breath, and through the anguish of his deep gashed wounds, was forced to give the World a farewell, and to yield the Riches of his Castle to the most Renowned Conqueror St. <hi>Anthony</hi> the Champion of <hi>Italy:</hi> But by that time the long and dangerous Encounter was finished, and the Gyant <hi>Blanderon</hi>'s Head was dissevered from his Body, the Sun sate mounted on the highest part of the Elements, which caused the day to be extream hot and sultry, the Champion's Armour so scalded him, that he was constrained to unbrace his Cors<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>let, and to lay aside his Burgonet, and to cast his Body upon the cold Earth, only to mitigate his over-burdened heat. But such was the unnatural coolness of the Earth, and so unkindly to his over-laboured Body, that the melted grease of his inward parts was cooled suddenly, whereby his Body received such unnatural Distemper, that the Uapours of the Earth struck presently to his heart, by which his vital air of Life excluded; and his body without sense or moving: where at the mercy of pale Death he lay bereaved of feeling for the space of an hour.</p>
                        <p>During which time fair <hi>Rosalinde</hi> (one of the Daughters of the <hi>Thracian</hi> King, being as then Prisoner in the Castle) by chance looked over the Walls, and espied the body of the Gyant headless, under whose subjection she had continued in great servitude, for the time of seven Months, likewise by him a Knight unarmed as she thought panting for breath, the which the Lady judged to be
<pb facs="tcp:29556:24" rendition="simple:additions"/>
the Knight that had slain the Gyant <hi>Blanderon,</hi> and the man by whom her Delivery should be recovered; she presently descended the Walls of the Castle, and ran with all speed to the adventurous Champion, whom she found dead. But yet being nothing discou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>raged of his Recovery, feeling as yet a warm blood in every Mem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber, retired back with all speed to the Eastle, and fetcht a Box of precious Balm, the which the Gyant was wont to pour into his wounds after his encounter with any Knight: with which Balm this courteous Lady chafed every part of the breathless Champion's body, one while washing his stiff Limbs with her salt tears, the which like pearls fell from her Eyes, another while drying them with tresses of her golden hair, which hung dangling in the wind, then chafing his lifeless body again with a Balm of a contrary nature, but yet no sign of life could she espie in the dead Knight, which caused her to grow desperate of all hope of his recovery. Therefore like a loving, meek, and kind Lady, con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sidering he had lost his life for her sake, she intended to bear him company in Death, and with her own hands to finish her days, and to die upon his Breast, as <hi>Thisbe</hi> died upon the Breast of her true <hi>Pyramis:</hi> therefore as the Swan sings a while before her death, so this sorrowful Lady warbled forth this Swan-like Song over the body of the Noble Champion.</p>

                        <p>This woful Ditty was no sooner ended, but the desperate Lady unsheathed the Champion's Sword, which was as yet all besprink<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led with the Gyant's Blood, and being at the very point to exe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cute her intended Tragedy, and the sharp edged Weapon directly against her Ivory Breast, she heard the distressed Knight give a grievous and terrible groan, whereat she stopped her remorseless hand, and with more discretion tendred her own safety: for by this time the Balm wherewith she anointed his Body, by wonderful operation, recovered the dead Champion, insomuch that after some few gasps and deadly sighs, he rais'd up his stiff Limbs from the cold Earth, where like one cast into a Trance, for a time he gazed up and down the Mountain, but at the last having recovered his lost Senses, espied the <hi>Thracian</hi> Damsel stand by, not able to speak one word, her joy so abounded: but after some continuance of time he revealed to her the manner of his dangerous encounter, and suc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cessful Uictory; and she the cause of his recovery, and her inten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded Tragedy. Where after many kind Salutations, she courte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ously took him by the hand, and led him into the Castle, where for that night she lodged his weary Limbs in an easie Bed stuffed with Turtle-feathers, and softest Thistle-down: the Chamber where he lay, had as many Windows as there were Months in the Year, and as many Doors as there were Quarters in the Year, and to describe the curious Architecture, and the artificial Work<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manship of the place, were too tedious, and a work without end.</p>

of the Castle: but the Lady <hi>Rosalinde</hi> all the morning was bufied in looking to his Horse, preparing Delicates for his Repast, and in making a fire against his uprising, where after he had refreshed his weary steps with a dainty Banquet, and carowsed down two or three Bowls of <hi>Greekish</hi> Wine, he after by the advice of <hi>Ro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>salinde,</hi> stripped the Grant from his Iron Furniture, and left his naked body upon a craggy Rock, to be devoured of hungry Ravens, which being done, the <hi>Thracian</hi> Uirgin discovered all the Castle to the adventurous Champion: first she led him to a Leaden Tower, where hung a hundred well approved Corssers, with other Martial Furniture, which were the spoils of such Knights as he had vio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lently slain: after that, she brought him to a Stable, wherein stood a hundred pampered Iades, which daily fed upon nothing but humane flesh, against it was directly placed the Gyant's own Lod<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ging, his Bed was of Iron, corded with mighty Bars of Steel, the Testern or Covering of carved Brass, the Curtains were of leaves of Gold, and the rest of a strange and wonderful substance of the colour of the Element: after this, she led him to a broad Pond of Water, more clear than Quick-silver, the Streams whereof lay continually as smooth as Crystal, whereon swam six milk-white Swans, with Crowns of Gold about their Necks.</p>

So when this Monstrous Gyant saw that his intent was crost, and how there was none left behind to supply his want, but my unfortunate self, he restrain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed his filthy Lust, not violating my Honour with any stain of In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>famy, but kept me ever since a most pure Uirgin, only with sweet inspiring Muslck to bring him to his sleep.</p>

Whereat the Knight being oppressed then with like sorrow, em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>braced her about the slender Wast, and thus kindly began to comfort her:</p>
                        <p>Most dear and kind Lady, within whose countenance I see how Uertue is enthroned, and in whose mind lives true Magnanimity, let these few words suffice to comfort thy sorrowful cogitations.

                              <hi>How St</hi> Andrew, <hi>the Champion of</hi> Scotland, <hi>Travelled into a Vale of Walking Spirits, and how he was set at Liberty by a going Fire, after his Journey into</hi> Thracia, <hi>where he recovered the Six Ladies to their natural shapes, that had lived seven years in the likeness of milk-white Swans, with other Accidents that be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fell the most Noble Champion.</hi>

                        </argument>
                        <p>NOw of the honourable Adventures of St. <hi>Andrew,</hi> the famous Champion of <hi>Scotland,</hi> must I discourse, whose seven years Travels were as strange as any of the other Champions: For af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter he had departed from the brazen Pillar, as you heard in the beginning of the History, he travelled through many strange and unknown Nation, beyond the circuit of the Sun, where but one time in the year he shews his brightsome Beams, but continual darkness overspreads the whole Country, and there lives a kind of People, that have heads like Dogs, that in extremity of hunger do devour one another, from which People this Noble Champion was strangely delivered, where after he had wandred some certain days, neither seeing the gladsome brightness of the Sun, nor the comfortable countenance the Moon, but only guided by duskye Pla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nets of the Elements, he hapned to a Uale of walking Spirits. which he supposed to be the very Dungeon of burning <hi>Acheron:</hi> there he heard the blowing of uns√©en Fires, boyling of Furnaces, ratling of Armour, trampling of Horses, <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

But yet having an undaunted Courage, exempting all fear, he humbly made his supplication to Heaven, that God would deliver him from that discontented place of terror; and so presently as the Champion kneeled down upon the barren ground, (whereon grew neither herb, flower, grass, or any other green thing) he beheld a certain flame of Fire, walking up and down before him, whereat he grew into such an extasie of fear, that he stood for a time amazed, whether it were best to go forward, or to stand still: but yet retaking his Senses, he remembred himself, how he had read in former times of a go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing Fire, called <hi>Ignis fatuus,</hi> the fire of Destiny: by some, <hi>Will with the Wisp,</hi> or <hi>Jack with the Lanthorn:</hi> and likewise, by some simple Countrey People. <hi>The fair Maid of Ireland,</hi> which common<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly used to lead wandring Travellors out of their ways: the like
<pb facs="tcp:29556:29" rendition="simple:additions"/>
Imaginations entred into the Champion's mind. So incoura<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ging himself with his own conceits, and chearing up his dull Senses, late oppressed with extream fear, he directly followed the going Fire, which so justly went before him, that by that time the guider of the night had climbed twelve-Degrees in the Zodiack, he was safely delivered from the Uale of walking Spirits, by the di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rection of the going Fire,</p>
                        <p>Now began the Sun to dance about the Firmament, which he had not seen in many months before, whereat his dull senses much rejoyced, being long covered before with darkness, that every step be trode, was as pleasurable, as though he had walked in a Garden bedecked with all kind of fragrant Flowers.</p>
                        <p>At last, without any further molestation, he arrived within the Territories of <hi>Thracia,</hi> a Country as you have heard in the for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer Chapter, adorned with the beauty of many fair Woods and Forrests, through which he Travelled with small rest, and less sleep, till he came to the foot of the Mountain, whereupon stood the Castle wherein the woful King of <hi>Thracia,</hi> in company of his sor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rowful Subjects, still lamented the unhappy Destinies of his six Daughters turned into Swans, having Crowns of Gold about their Necks; when the Ualiant Champion St. <hi>Andrew</hi> beheld the lofty situation of the Castle, and the invincible strength it seemed to be of, he expected some strange Adventure to befall him in the said Castle, so preparing his Sword in readiness, and buck<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling close his Armour, which was a shirt of Silver Maile for lightness in Travel, he climbed the Mountain, whereupon he espied the Gyant lying upon a craggy Rock, with his Limbs and Mem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bers all rent and torn, by the fury of hunger-starved Fowls: which loathsome Spectacle was no little wonder to the worthy Champion, considering the mighty stature and bigness of the Gyant: where leaving his putrified Body to the Winds, he approached the Gates: where after he had read the Superscription over the same, without any interruption, entred the Castle, whence he expected a fierce encounter by some Knight that should have defended the same; but all things fell out contrary to his imagination, for after he had found many a strange novelty and hidden secret closed in the same, he chanced at last to come where the <hi>Thracians</hi> duly observed their ceremonious Mournings, which in this order were daily performed: First upon Sundays, which in that Country is the first day in the Week, all the <hi>Thracians</hi> attired themselves after the manner of <hi>Bacchus</hi>'s Priests, and burned persumed Incense, with sweet <hi>Arabian</hi> Frankincense upon a Religious Shrine, which they offered to the Sun as chief Governor of that day, thinking
<pb facs="tcp:29556:29" rendition="simple:additions"/>
thereby to appease the angry Destinies, and to recover the unhap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>py Ladies to their former shapes: upon Mondays, clad in Gar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments after the Silvans, a colour like to the Waves of the Sea, they offered up their tears to the Moon, being the guider and Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>striss of that day: Upon Tuesdays like Souldiers trailing their banners in the Dust, and Drums sounding sad and doleful melody, in sign of Discontent, they committed their proc√©edings to the pleasures of <hi>Mars,</hi> being Ruler and Guider of that Day; Upon Wednesday like Scholars unto <hi>Mercury:</hi> Upon Thursday like Po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tentates, to <hi>Love;</hi> Upon Frydays like Lovers with sweet sound<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing Musick to <hi>Venus;</hi> and upon Saturday like manual professors, to the angry and discontented <hi>Saturn.</hi>
                        </p>
                        <p>Thus the woful <hi>Thracian</hi> King, and his sorrowful Subjects, consumed seven Months away, one while accursing Fortune of de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>spite, another while the Heavens of Injustice: the one for his Children's Trausformations, the other for their long limited Pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nishments. But at last when the <hi>Scottish</hi> Champion heard what bitter moan the <hi>Thracians</hi> made about the River, he demanded the cause, and to what purpose they observed such Ceremonies, con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>temning the Majesty of <hi>Jehovah,</hi> and only Worshipping but out<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward and vain Gods: to whom the King, after a few sad tears Tears strained from the Conduits of his aged Eyes, Replyed in this manner.</p>
                        <p>Most Noble Knight, for so you s√©em by your gesture and other outward appearance, (quoth the King,) if you desire to know the cause of our continual grief, prepare your ears to hear a Tragick and woful tale, whereat methinks I s√©e the Elements begin to mourn, and cover their azured countenance with fable Clouds: These Milk-white Swans you see, whose Necks are beautified with Golden Crowns, are my six natural Daughters, transformed into this Swan-like Substance, by the appointment of the God's: for of late this Castle was kept by a cruel Gyant, named <hi>Blande<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ron,</hi> who by violence would have Ravished them, but the Heavens to preserve their Chastities, prevented his Lustful Desires: and transformed their beautiful bodies to these milk-white Swans: and now seven years the chearful Spring hath renewed the Earth with a Summer's Livery, and seven times the nipping Winter Frosts have bereaved the Tr√©es of Leaf and Bud, since first my Daughters lost their Uirgin-shapes: seven Summers have they swam upon this Crystal Stream, where instead of Rich Attire, and embroidered Uestments, their smooth Silver-coloured Feathers adorn their comely Bodies: Princely Palaces, wherein they were wont, like tripping Sea-Nymphs, to dance their measures up and
<pb facs="tcp:29556:30" rendition="simple:additions"/>
down, are now exchanged into cold streams of water: where in their chiefest melody is the murmuring of cold liquid bubbles, and their joyful pleasure to hear the harmony of humming B√©es which some Poets call the Muses Birds.</p>
                        <p>Thus have you heard (most worthy Knight) the woful Trage<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy of my Daughters, for whose sakes I will spend the remnant of my days heavily, complaining of their long appointed Punish<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments, about the Banks of this unhappy River. Which sad Dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>course was no sooner ended, but the <hi>Scottish</hi> Knight (having a mind furnished with all Princely thoughts<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

                        <p>Most Noble King (quoth the Champion) your heavy and do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lorous discourse hath constrained my heart to a wonderful Passion and compelled my very soul to rue your Daughters miseries: But yet a greater grief and deeper sorrow than that, hath taken possessi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of my breast, whereof my eyes have b√©en witnesses, and my ears unhappy hearers of your misbelief, I mean your unchristian Faith: For I have s√©en since. my first arrival into this same Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stle, your Prophane and Uain Worship of strange and false Gods, as of <hi>Phoebus, Luna, Mars, Mercury,</hi> and such like Poetical Names, which the Majesty of high <hi>Jehovah</hi> utterly contemns. But Magni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficent Governor of <hi>Thracia,</hi> if you seek to recover your Daughters by humble Prayer, and to obtain your soul's content by true tears, you must abandon all such vain Ceremonies, and with true Hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mility believe in the Christian's God, which is the God of Won<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders, and chief Commander of the rouling Elements, in whose Quarrel this unconquered Arm, and this undaunted Heart of mine shall fight: and how be it known to thee, great King of <hi>Thrace,</hi> that I am a Christian Champion, by Birth a Knight of <hi>Scotland,</hi> bear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing my Countrey's Arms upon my Breast, (for indeed thereon he bore a Silver Cross, set in blue Silk) and therefore in the ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour of Christendom, I Challenge forth the proudest Knight at Arms, against whom I will maintain that our God is the true God, and the rest fantastical and vain Ceremonies.</p>
                        <p>Which sudden and unexpected Challenge, so daunted the <hi>Thra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cian</hi> Champions, that they stood amazed for a time, gazing upon one another, like Men dropt from the Clouds: but at fast consult<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing together, how the Challenge of the strange Knight was to the dishonour of their Country, and utter scandal of all Knightly Dig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity; they with a general consent craved leave of the King, that the Challenge might be taken, who as willingly condescended as they demanded. So both time and place was appointed,
<pb facs="tcp:29556:30" rendition="simple:additions"/>
which was the next morning following, by the King's Command<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, upon a large and plain Meadow close by the River-side, whereon the six Swans were swimming, whereupon after the Christian Champion had cast down his steely Gauntlet, and the <hi>Thracian</hi> Knight accepted thereof, every one departed for that night, the Challenger to the East-side of the Castle to his Lodging, and the Defendants to the West, where they slept quietly till the next morning, who by the break of day, were wakened by a Herald of Arms: but all the passed night, our <hi>Scottish</hi> Champion never en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tertained one motion of rest, but busied himself in trimming his Horse, buckling on his Armour, lacing on his Burgonet, and making prayers to the Divine Majesty of God, for the Conquest and Uictory, till the Morning's beauty chased away the darkness of the Night, and no sooner were the Windows of the day full opened, but the Ualiant and Noble-minded Champion of Christendom en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tred the List, where the King in company of the <hi>Thracian</hi> Lords was present to behold the Combat: and so after St. <hi>Andrew</hi> had twice or thrice traced his Horse up and down the Lists, bravely flourishing his Launce, at the top whereof hung a Pendant of Gold, whose Poesie was thus written in Silver Letters, <hi>This day a Mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tyr or a Conqueror</hi> Then entred a Knight in exceeding bright Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mour, mounted upon a Courser as white as the Northern Snow, whose Caparison was of the colour of the Elements, betwixt whom was a fierce Encounter: but the <hi>Thracian</hi> had the Foil and with disgrace departed the List.

Thirdly, Entred a Knight in a black Corslet, mounted upon a big-boned Paltry, covered with a vail of sable Silk, in his hand he bore a Launce nailed round about with plates of Steel: which Knight amongst the <hi>Thracians</hi> was accounted the strongest in the World, except it were those Gyants that descended from a monstrous Lineage: but no sooner encountred these hardy Cham<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pions, but their Launces shivered in sunder, and flew so violently into the Air, that it much amazed the beholders, then they alighted from their Steeds, and so valiantly bestirred them with their kee<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

<pb facs="tcp:29556:31" rendition="simple:additions"/>
with a wrathful coimtenance threatned the Champions Death in this manner.</p>
                        <p>Proud Christian (said the King) thou shalt repent his death, and curse the time that ever thou camest to <hi>Thracia:</hi> his blood we will revenge upon thy head, and quit thy committed cruelty with a sudden death: and so in company of a hundred Armed Knights, he encompassed the <hi>Scottish</hi> Champion, intending by multitudes to murder him. But when the valiant Knight St. <hi>Andrew</hi> saw how he was suppressed by Treachery, and environed with mighty Troops, he called to Heaven for succour, and animated himself by these words of encouragement: <hi>Now for the honour of Christendom, This day a Martyr or a Conqueror:</hi> and therewithal he so Ualiantly behaved himself with his Cuttle-Axe, that he made Lanes of mur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dered Men, and felled them down by multitudes like as the Harvest men do mow down Ears of ripened Corn, whereby they fell before his face like leaves, from trees when the Summer's Pride de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clines her Glory. So at the last after much bloodshed, the <hi>Thracian</hi> King was compelled to yield to the <hi>Scottish</hi> Champion's Mercy, who swore him for the safety of his Life, to forsake his prophane Religion, and become a Christian, whose living true God the <hi>Thracian</hi> King vowed for evermore to Worship, and thereupon he kissed the Champion's Sword.</p>
                        <p>This Conversion of the Pagan King, so pleased the Majesty of God, that he presently gave end to his Daughters punishments, and turned the Ladies to their former shapes. But when the King beheld their smooth Feathers, which were as white as Lillies, ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>changed to natural fairness, and that their black Bills and slender Necks were converted to their first created Beauty (where for ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ternal fairness the Queen of Love might build her Paradise) he bad adieu to his grief and long continued sorrows, protesting ever after to continue a true Christian for the <hi>Scottish</hi> Champion's sake, by whom and by whose Divine Orisons, his Daughters obtained their former Features; so taking the Christian Knight in compa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny of the six Ladies, to an excellent Rich Chamber prepared with all things according to their wishes, where first the Christian Knight was unarmed, then his wounds washed with Whitewine, new Milk, and Rose-water, and so after some dainty Repast, conveyed to his nights Repose. The Ladies being the joyfullest Creatures under Heaven, never entertained one thought of sleep, but pas<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed the night in their Father's company, (whose mind was ravished with unspeakable pleasures) till the morning's messengers bad them good morrow.</p>
                        <p>
                           <pb facs="tcp:29556:31" rendition="simple:additions"/>
Thus all things being prepared in a readiness, they departed the Castle, not like Mourners to a heavy Funeral, but in triumphing manner, marching back to the <hi>Thracian</hi> Palace, with streaming Banners in the Wind, Drums and Trumpets sounding joyful Melody, and with sweet inspiring Musick, caused the Air to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sound with Harmony: But no sooner were they entred the Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lace which was in distance from the Gyant's Castle, some ten miles, but their Triumphs turned to exceeding Sorrow, for <hi>Ro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>salinde</hi> with the Champion of <hi>Italy,</hi> as you have heard before, was departed the Court; which unexpected news so daunted the whole company, but especially the King, that the Triumphs for that time were deferred, and Messengers were dispatched in pursuit of the Adventurous <hi>Italian,</hi> and lovely <hi>Rosalinde.</hi>
                        </p>
                        <p>Likewise when St. <hi>Andrew</hi> of <hi>Scotland</hi> had intelligence how it was one of those Knights which was Imprisoned with him under the wicked Enchantress <hi>Kalyb,</hi> as you heard in the first beginning of the History, his heart thirsted for his most honourable compa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny, and his eyes seldom closed quietly, nor took any rest, untill he was likewise departed in the pursuit of his sworn Friend, which was the next night following, without making any acquainted with his intent: Likewise when the six Ladies understood the se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cret departure of the <hi>Scottish</hi> Champion, whom they asserted dearer than any Knight in the World, they stored themselves with suffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cient Treasure, and by stealth took their Iourneys from their Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther's Palace, intending either to find out the Uictorious and ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proved Knight of <hi>Scotland,</hi> or to end their Lives in some Foreign Region.</p>
                        <p>The Rumour of whose Departure, no sooner came to the King's Ears, but he purposed the like Travel, either to obtain the sight of his Daughters again, or to make his Tomb beyond the circuit of the Sun. So attiring himself in homely Russet, like a Pilgrim, with an Ebon staff in his hand, tipt with Silver, took his Iour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ney all unknown from his Palace, whose sudden and secret depar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture struck such an extream and intolerable heaviness in the Court, that the Palace Gates, were fealed up with sable mourning-cloth, the <hi>Thracian</hi> Lords exempted all pleasure, and like Flocks of sheep strayed up and down without Shepherds, the Ladies and Courtly Gentiles sate sighing in their private Chambers: where we will leave them for this time, and speak of the success of the other Champions, and how Fortune smiled on their Adventurous Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceedings.</p>

                              <hi>How St.</hi> Patrick, <hi>the Champion of</hi> Ireland, <hi>Redeemed the Six</hi> Thracian <hi>Ladies out of the hands of thirty bloody-minded</hi> Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tyrs, <hi>and of their purposed Travel in a Pursuit after the Cham<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pion of</hi> Scotland.</p>
                        </argument>
                        <p>BUT now of that Ualiant and hardy Knight at Arms, S. <hi>Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trick</hi> the Champion of <hi>Ireland,</hi> must I speak, whose Adventu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rous Accidents were so Nobly performed, that if my Pen were made of Steel, I should wear it to the stumps to declare his Prowess, and worthy Adventures. When he departed from the Brazen Pillar, from the other Champions, the Heavens smiled with a kind Aspect, and sent him such a Star to be his Guide, that it lead him to no Courtly pleasures, nor to vain delights, but to the Throne of Fame, where, Honour sate enstalled upon a Seat of Gold. Thither Travelled the Warlike Champion of <hi>Ireland,</hi> whose Illustrious Battels the Northern Isses have Chronicled in leaves of Brass: Therefore <hi>Ireland</hi> be proud, for from thy Bowels did spring a Champion, whose Prowess made the Enemies of Christ to tremble, and watered the Earth with streams of Pagans Blood: witness whereof the Isse of <hi>Rhodes,</hi> the key and strength of Christendom, was recovered from the Turks, by his Martial and Invincible Prowess; where his dangerous Battels, fierce Encounters, bloody Skirmishes, and long Assaults would serve to fill a mighty Uolume, all which I pass over, and wholly dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>course of things appertaining to this History. For after the Wars of <hi>Rhodes</hi> were fully ended, <hi>St. Patrick</hi> (accounted idle ease the Nurse of Cowardise) bad <hi>Rhodes</hi> farewell, being then strongly For<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tified with Christian Soldiers, and took his Iourney through ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny an unknown Country, where at last, it pleased so the Queen of Chance, to direct his steps into a solitary Wilderness, inhabited only by Wild Satyrs, and a People of inhumane Qualities, giv<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing their wicked minds only to Murder, Lust, and Rapine: where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in the Noble Champion Travelled up and down many a weary step, not knowing how to qualifie his hunger, but by his own in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dustry in killing of Uenison, and pressing out the blood between two flat stones, and daily roasted it by the heat of the Sun, his Lodging was in the hollow Trunk of a Blasted Tree, which nightly preser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved him from the dropping showers of Heaven, his chief Compani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons
<pb facs="tcp:29556:32" rendition="simple:additions"/>
were sweet resounding Ecchoes, which commonly re-answered the Champions words.</p>
                        <p>In this manner lived St. <hi>Patrick</hi> the <hi>Irish</hi> Knight, in the Woods, not knowing how to set himself at Liberty, but wandring up and down as it were in a maze wrought by the curious workmanship of some excellent Gardiner, it was his chance at last to come into a dismal shady Thicket, beset about with baleful Mistletoe. a place of horror, wherein he heard the cries of some distressed Ladies, whose bitter Lamentations seemed to pierce the Clouds, and to crave suc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cour of the hands of God, which unexpected cries not a little daunted the <hi>Irish</hi> Knight, so that it caused him to prepare his Weapon in readiness against some sudden encounter: so crouching himself un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der the Root of an old withered Oak (which had not flourished with green leaves many a year) he espied afar off, a crew of bloody<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minded Satyrs, haling by the hair of the head six unhappy Ladies, through many a thorny brake and bryar, whereby the beauty of their crimson cheeks was all besprent with purple gore, and their eyes, (within whose clear Glasses one might behold the God of Love dancing) all to be rent and torn by the fury of the Bryars, whereby they could not see the light of Heaven, nor the place of their unfortunate abiding: which woful spectacle forced such a ter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ror in the heart of the <hi>Irish</hi> Knight, that he presently made out for the Rescue of the Ladies, to Redeem them from the fury of the merciless Satyrs, which were in number about some thirty, every one having a Club upon his Neck, which they had made of the Roots of young Oaks and Pine-trees; yet this Adventurous Champion being nothing Discouraged, but with a Bold and Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>solute Mind, let drive at the <gap reason="illegible: bleedthrough" extent="3 letters">

Satyrs, who Cruelly and Tyrannically attempted the Ruine and endless Spoil of their unspotted Uirginities. To which courteous demand one of the Ladies, after a deep-fetcht sigh or two (being strained from the bottom of her most sorrowful heart) in the behalf of her self and the other distressed Ladies, replied in this order:</p>
                        <p>
                           <hi>Know, brave minded Knight, that we are the unfortunate Daughters of the King of</hi> Thrace, <hi>whose Lives have been unhap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>py ever since our Births, for first we did endure a long Imprison<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment under the hands of a Cruel Gyant, and after the Heavens to preserve our Chastities from the wicked desire of the said Gyant, transformed us into the shape of Swans, in which likeness we re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mained seven years, but at last recovered by a worthy Christian Knight, named St.</hi> Andrew <hi>the Champion of</hi> Scotland, <hi>after whom we have Travelled many a weary step, never crossed by any Vio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lence, until it was our angry Fates to arrive in this unhappy Wil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derness, where your eyes have been true witnesses of our Misfor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tunes.</hi> Which sad Discourse was no sooner finished, but the Wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thy Champion thus began to comfort the distressed Ladies.</p>
                        <p>
                           <hi>The Christian Champion after whom you take in hand this weary Travel</hi> (said the <hi>Irish</hi> Champion) <hi>is my approved Friend, for whose Company and wished for Sight, I will go more weary miles than there be Trees in this vast Wilderness, and number my steps with the Sands hidden in the Seas: Therefore, most excellent La<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dies, true Ornaments of Beauty, be sad Companions in my Tra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vels, for I will never cease till I have found our Honourable Friend, the Champion of</hi> Scotland, <hi>or some of those brave Knights, whom I have not seen these seven Summers.</hi>

                        <p>These words so contented the sorrowful Ladies, that without any exception they agr√©ed, and with as much willingness consented as the Champion demanded.

                              <hi>How St.</hi> David <hi>the Champion of</hi> Wales, <hi>slew the Count</hi> Palatine <hi>in the</hi> Tartarian <hi>Court, and after how he was sent to the En<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chanted Garden of</hi> Drmandine, <hi>wherein by Magick Art he slept seven years.</hi>
                           </p>
                        </argument>
                        <p>SAint <hi>David</hi> the most Noble Champion of <hi>Wales,</hi> after his depar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture from the Brazen Pillar, whereat the other Champions of Christendom divided themselves severally to seek Foreign Ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ventures, he atchieved many memorable things, as well in Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stendom, as in those Nations that acknowledged no true God: which as for this time I omit, and only discourse what hapned un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to him among the <hi>Tartarians:</hi> for being in the Emperor of <hi>Tarta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry's</hi> Court (a place very much honoured with Ualorous Knights, highly graced with a Train of Beautiful Ladies) where the Em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peror upon a time Drdained a Solemn Iust and Tournament to be holden in the honour of his Birth-day: whither resorted at the time appointed, (from all the Borders of <hi>Tartary</hi>) the best and the hardiest Knights there remaining. In which Honourable and Princely Exercise, the Noble Knight St. <hi>David</hi> was appointed Champion for the Emperor, who was Mounted upon a <hi>Morocco</hi> St√©ed, betrapped in a rich Eaparison, wrought by the curious work of Indian Women, upon whose Shield was set a Golden Griffen rampant in a Field of Blue.</p>
                        <p>Against him came the Count <hi>Palatine,</hi> Son and Heir apparent to the <hi>Tartarian</hi> Emperor; brought in by twelve Knights, Richly furnished with Habiliments of Honour, who paced thr√©e times a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout the Lists before the Emperor and many Ladies that were present to behold the honourable Tournament. The which being done, the twelve Knights departed the Lists, and the Count <hi>Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>latine</hi> prepared himself to Encounter with the Christian Knight, (being appointed chief Champion for the Day) who likewise pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pared himself, and at the Trumpet's Sound by the Herald's ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pointment, they ran so fiercely each against other, that the Ground s√©emed to shake under them, and the Skies to resound Ecchoes of their mighty strokes.</p>
                        <p>At the second Race the Champions ran, St. <hi>David</hi> had the worst, and was constrained through the forcible strength of the Count <hi>Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>latine</hi> to lean backward, almost beside his Saddle, whereat the Trumpets began to sound in sign of Uictory: but yet the Ualiant
<pb facs="tcp:29556:34" rendition="simple:additions"/>
Christian nothing dismayed, but with a Courage (within whose eyes sate Knightly Revenge) ran the third time against the Count <hi>Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>latine,</hi> and by the Uiolence of his Strength, he overthrew both Horse and Man, whereby the Count's Body was so extreamly bruised with the fall of his Horse, that his heart-blood issued forth by his mouth, and his vital spirits pressed from the mansion of his breast, so that he was forced to give the World Farewell.</p>
                        <p>This fatal Overthrow of the Count <hi>Palatine,</hi> abashed the whole Company, but especially the <hi>Tartarian</hi> Emperor, who having no more Sons but him, caused the Lists to be broken up, the Knights to be unarmed, and the murdered Count to be brought, by four Esquires, into his Palace, where after he was despoiled of his Furniture, and the Christian Knight received in honour of his Uictory, the woeful Emperor bathed his Son's Body with Tears, which dropped like Crystal Pearls from the congealed blood, and after many sad sighs he breathed forth this woful Lamentation.</p>
                        <p>
                           <hi>Now are my Triumphs turned into Everlasting Woes, from a Comical Pastime, to a direful and Bloody Tragedy; O most un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kind Fortune, never Constant but in Change! why is my Life de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferred to see the downfall of my dear Son, the Noble Count</hi> Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>latine? <hi>Why rends not this accursed Earth whereon I stand, and presently swallow up my Body into her hungry Bowels? Is this the use of Christians? For true Honour to repay Dishonour? Could not base blood serve to stain his deadly hands withall, but the Royal blood of my dear Son, in whose Revenge the face of the Heavens is stained with Blood, and cries for Vengeance to the Majesty of Mighty Jove. The dreadful Furies, the direful daugh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters of dark Night, and all the baleful company of burning</hi> Ache<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ron, <hi>whose Loins shall be girt with Serpents, and Hair be hanged with Wreaths of Snakes, shall haunt, pursue, and follow that ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cursed Christian Champion, that hath bereaved my Country</hi> Tar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tary <hi>of so precious a Jewel as my dear Son the Count</hi> Palatine <hi>was, whose Magnanimous Prowess did surpass all the Knights of our recovery.</hi>
                        </p>
                        <p>Thus sorrowed the woful Emperor for the Death of his Noble Son: Sometimes making the Ecchoes of his Lamentations pierce the Elements: Another while forcing his bitter Curses to sink to the deep Foundations of <hi>Acheron:</hi> One while intending to be Revenged on St. <hi>David</hi> the Christian Champion, then presently his intent was crossed with a contrary imagination, thinking it was against the Law of Arms, and a great Dishonour to his Country, by Uiolence to Oppress a strange Knight, whose Anions
<pb facs="tcp:29556:34" rendition="simple:additions"/>
had ever been guided by true Honour; but yet at last this firm Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>solution entred into his Mind.</p>
                        <p>There was adjoyning upon the Borders of <hi>Tartary,</hi> an Enchan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted Garden, kept by Magick Art, from whence never any returned that attempted to enter; the Governour of which Garden was a Notable and Famous Necromancer, named <hi>Ormandine,</hi> to which Magician the <hi>Tartarian</hi> Emperor intended to send the Adventurous Champion St. <hi>David,</hi> thereby to Revenge the Count <hi>Palatine</hi>'s Death. So the Emperor after some few days passed, and the Ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sequies of his Son being no sooner performed, but he caused the Christian Knight to be brought into his Presence, to whom he com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitted this heavy Task, and weary Labour.</p>
                        <p>Proud Knight (said the Angry Emperor) thou knowest since thy Arrival in our Territories, how highly I have Honoured thee, not only in granting liberty of Life, but making thee chief Cham<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pion of <hi>Tartary,</hi> which high Honour thou hast repayed with great Ingratitude. and blemished true Nobility, in Acting my dear Son's Tragedy: for which unhappy Deed thou rightly hast de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>served Death, But yet know Accursed Christian, that Mercy har<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>boureth in Princely minds, and where Honour sits Enthronized, there Justice is not too Severe: Although thou hast deserved Death, yet if thou wilt adventure to the Enchanted Garden and bring hither the Magician's Head, I grant thee not only Life, but therewithal the Crown of <hi>Tartary</hi> after my Decease: because I see thou hast a mind furnished with all Princely thoughts, and A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dorned with true Magnanimity.</p>
                        <p>This heavy Task and strange Adventure not a little pleased the Noble Champion of <hi>Wales,</hi> whose mind ever thirsted after Worthy Adventures: And so after some considerate thoughts, in this man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner reply'd:</p>
                        <p>Most High and Magnificent Emperor, (said the Champion) were this Task which you enjoyn me to, as wonderful as the La<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bours of <hi>Hercules,</hi> or as fearful as the Enterprize which <hi>Jason</hi> made for the Golden Fleece, yet would I attempt to finish it, and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turn with Triumph to <hi>Tartary,</hi> as the <hi>Macedonian</hi> Monarch did to <hi>Babylon,</hi> when he had Conquered part of the wide World.

Thus the Ualiant Christian Champion, being bound to his Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mise, within three days prepared all Necessaries in readiness for his departure: and so Travelled West-ward, till he approached the sight of the Enchanted Garden, the Situation whereof somewhat daunted his Ualiant Courage: For it was encompassed with a Hedge of withered Thorns and Bryars, which seemed continually to burn: Upon the top thereof fate a number of strange and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formed things, some in the likeness of Night-Owls, which won<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dred at the Presence of St. <hi>David,</hi> some in the shape of <hi>Progne</hi>'s Transfo<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

                        <p>So the Noble Knight St. <hi>David</hi> with a Ualiant Courage went to the Garden Gate, by which stood a Rock of Stone, overspread with Moss: In which Rock by Magick Art was enclosed a Sword, nothing outwardly appearing but the Hilt, which was the Richest in his Iudgment, that ever his Eyes beheld, for the Steel-work was engraven very curiously, beset with Iaspers and Saphire-Stones; the Pummel was in the fashion of a Globe, of the purest Silver that the Mines of Rich <hi>America</hi> brought forth: about the Pummel, was engraven with Letters of Gold, these Uerses following.</p>

These Uerses drave such a conceited imagination into the Cham<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pions mind, that he supposed himself to be the Northern Knight by whom the Necromancer should be Conquered; Therefore without any further advisement, he put his hand into the Hilt of the Rich Sword, thinking presently to pull it out from the En<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chanted Rock of <hi>Ormandine:</hi> but no sooner did he attempt that vain enterprize, but his Ualiant Courage and Invincible Fortitude failed him, and all his Senses were overtaken with a sudden and heavy sleep, whereby he was forced to let go his hold, and to fall flat upon the barren ground, where his eyes were so fast locked up by Magick Art, and his waking Senses drowned in such a dead slumber, that it was as much impossible to recover himself from sleep, as to pull the Sun out of the Firmament. The Necro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mancer, by his Magick skill had intelligence of the Champion's unfortunate success, who sent from the Enchanted Garden four Spirits, in the similitude and likeness of four beautiful Damsels, which wrapped the drousie Champion in a sheet of fine <hi>Arabian</hi> Silk, and conveyed him into a Cave, directly placed in the middle of the Garden, where they laid him upon a soft Bed, more softer than the Down of <hi>Culvers:</hi> where those beautiful Ladies through the Art of wicked <hi>Ormandine,</hi> continually kept him sleeping for the Term of seven years: One while singing with sweet sugared Songs, more sweet and delightful than the Syrens Melody: Ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther while with rare conceited Musick, surpassing the sweetness of <hi>Arion's</hi> Harp, which made the Dolphins in the Sea dance at the sound of his sweet inspiring melody; or like the Harmony of <hi>Orpheus</hi> when he Iourneyed down into Hell, where the Devils rejoyced to hear his admired Notes, and on Earth Trees and Stones leaped when he did but touch the silver strings of his Ivory Harp.</p>
                        <p>Thus was St. <hi>David</hi>'s Adventure cross'd with a wonderful bad Success, whose Days Travels was turned into √° Nights Repose; whose nights repose was made a heavy sleep, which endured until seven years were fully finished, where we will leave St. <hi>David</hi> to the Mercy of the Necromancer <hi>Ormandine,</hi> and return to the most Noble and Magnanimous Champion St. <hi>George,</hi> where we left him Imprisoned in the Sculdan's Court.

But at last, when seven years were fully ended, it was the Champion's lucky Fortune to find in a secret corner of the Dun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>geon a certain Iron Engine, which time had almost consumed with Rust, wherewith, with long Labour, he digged himself a passage through the Ground, till he ascended just in the middle of the Soul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dan's Court, which was at that time of the night, when all things were silent: The Heavens he then beheld beautified with Stars, and bright <hi>Cynthia,</hi> whose glistring Beams he had not seen in many hundred nights before, seemed to smile at his safe delivery, and to stay her wandring course, till he most happily found means to get without the compass of the <hi>Persian's</hi> Court, where danger might no longer attend him, nor the strong Gates of the City hinder his flight, which in this manner was performed. For now the No<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble Knight being as fearful as the Bird newly escaped from the Fowlers Net, gazed round about, and listened where he might hear the voice of People, at last he heard the Grooms of the Soul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dan's Stable, furnishing forth Horses against the next Morning for some Noble Atchievement. Whereupon the Noble Champion St. <hi>George</hi> taking the Iron Engine, wherewith he redeemed him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>self out of Prison, he burst open the Doors, where he slew all the Grooms in the Souldan's Stable: Which being done, he took the strongest Palsrey, and the Richest Furniture, with other ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cessaries appertaining to a Knight at Arms, and so rode in great comfort to one of the City Gates, where he saluted the Porter in this manner.</p>
                           <p>
                              <hi>Porter, Open the Gates, for St.</hi> George <hi>of</hi> England <hi>is escaped, and hath murdered the Grooms, in whose Pursuit the City is in Arms.</hi> Which words the simple <hi>Persian</hi> believed for truth, and so with all speed opened the Gates, whereat the Champion of <hi>England</hi> departed, and left the Souldan in his dead sleep, little mistrusting his sudden Escape.</p>
                           <p>But by that the purple spotted morning had parted with her grey, and the Sun's bright countenance appeared on the Mountain tops, S. <hi>George</hi> had Ridden twenty Miles from the <hi>Persian</hi> Court, and before his departure was bruted in the Souldans Palace, the <hi>English</hi> Champion had recovered the sight of <hi>Grecia,</hi> past all danger of the <hi>Persian</hi> Knights that followed him with a swift pursuit.</p>
                           <p>By this time the extremity of Hunger so sharply tormented him; that he could Travel no further, but was constrained to sustain himself with certain wild Chesnuts instead of Bread, and sower Oranges instead of Drink, and such faint Food as grew by the way as he Travelled, where the necessity and want of Uictuals compelled the Noble Knight to breath forth this pitiful complaint.</p>
                           <p>
                              <pb facs="tcp:29556:37" rendition="simple:additions"/>
Oh hunger! hunger, (said the Champion) more sharper than the stroke of Death. thou art the extreamest punishment that ever Man endured; If I were now King of <hi>Armenia,</hi> and chief Poten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tate of <hi>Asia,</hi> yet would I give my Diadem, my Scepter, with all my Provinces, for one shiver of brown Bread: O that this Earth would be so kind, as to open her Bowels and cast up some Food, to suffice my want: Or that the Air might be choaked with Mists, whereby feathered Fowl for want of breath might fall, and yield me some Succour in this my Famishment, and extream Penury: Or that the Oceans would out-spread their branched Arms, and cover these Sun-burnt Ualleys with their Treasures, to satisfie my hunger; but Oh! now I see both Heaven and Earth, Hills, and Dales, Skies, and Seas, Fish and Fowls, Birds and Beasts, and all things under the cope of Heaven, conspire my utter overthrow: Better had it been if I had ended my days in <hi>Persia,</hi> than here to be famished in the broad World, where all things by Nature's appointment are ordained for Man's use. Now instead of Courtly Delicates, I am forced to eat the fruit of Trees, and instead of <hi>Greekish</hi> Wines, I am compelled to quench my thirst with Morning-dew, which nightly falls upon the blades of Grass.</p>
                           <p>Thus complained St. <hi>George,</hi> till glistring <hi>Phoebus</hi> had mounted the top of Heaven, and drawn the Misty Uapours from the Ground, whereby he might behold the Prospects of <hi>Grecia,</hi> and which way to Travel most safely. And as he looked, he espied directly before his face a Tower, standing upon a chalky Cliff, distant from him some three miles, whither the Champion intended to go, not to seek for Adventures, but to Rest himself after his weary Iour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ney, and get such Uictuals as therein he could find to suffice his want.</p>
                           <p>So setting forward with a speedy pace, the Heaven seemed to smile, and the Birds to Ring chirping Peals of Melody, as though they did prognosticate a fortunate event. The way he found so plain, and the Iourney so easie, that in half an hour he ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proached before the said Tower; where upon the Wall stood a most Beautiful Woman, attired after the manner of a distressed La<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy, and her looks heavy like the Queen of <hi>Troy,</hi> when she be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>held her Palace on Fire.

Sir Knight (quoth she) I advise thee with all speed to depart, for here thou gettest but a cold Dinner: my Lord is a mighty Gy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ant, and believeth in <hi>Mahomet,</hi> and if he once do but understand that thou art a Christian Knight, not all the Gold of higher <hi>India,</hi> nor the Riches of wealthy <hi>Babylon,</hi> can preserve thy Life.

                           <p>These words so abashed the Lady, that she went with all speed from the Tower, and told the Gyant, how a Christian Knight re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mained at the Gate, which had sworn to suffice his hunger in de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>spite of his will: Whereat the furious Gyant suddenly started up, being as then in a sound sleep, for it was the middle of the day, who took a bar of Iron in his hand, and came down to the Tower Gate. His stature was in heighth five yards, his head bristled like a Bore, a foot there was betwixt each Brow, his Eyes hollow, his Mouth wide, his Lips werelike to flaps of Steel, in all his proportion more like a Devil than a Man. Which deformed Mon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ster so daunted the Courage of St. <hi>George,</hi> that he prepared him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>self for Death: Not through fear of the Monstrous Gyant, but for hunger and feebleness of body: but here God provided for him, and so restored to him his decayed strength, that he endured Bat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tel untill the closing up of the Evening, by which time the Gyant grew almost blind, through the sweat that ran down from his monstrous Brows, whereat St. <hi>George</hi> got the advantage, and wounded the Gyant so cruelly under the short Ribs, that he was compelled to fall to the Ground, and to give end to his Life.</p>
                           <p>After which happy event of the Gyant's slaughter, the invin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cible Champion St. <hi>George</hi> first gave the Honour of his Uictory unto God, in whose power all his Fortune consisted.

                           <p>And so leaving the Tower in keeping of the Lady, he committed his Fortune to a new Travel; where his revived Spirits never entertained longer Rest, but to the refreshing of himself and his Horse; so Travelled he through part of <hi>Grecia,</hi> the Confines of <hi>Phrygia,</hi> and into the Borders of <hi>Tartory,</hi> within whose Territo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries

What I report, write in brazen Lines, for the time will come when this Dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>course shall highly benefit thee. Take heed thou observe three things: first, that thou take to Wife a pure Maid: Next that thou erect a Monument over thy Father's Grave: And lastly, That thou continue a professed Enemy to the Foes of Christ Iesus, bearing Arms in the Honour and Praise of thy Country. These things being truly and justly observed, thou shalt attain such Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour, that all Kingdoms of Christendom shall admire thy Dig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity: what I speak is upon no vain imagination sprung from a frantick Brain, but pronounced by this Mystical and deep Art of Necromancy.</p>
                           <p>These words were no sooner ended, but the most Honourable Fortunate Champion of <hi>England,</hi> requested the Magician to describe his passed Fortunes, and by what means he came to be Governor of the Enchanted Garden.</p>
                           <p>
                              <hi>To tell the Discourse of my own Life (replyed</hi> Ormandine) <hi>will breed a new sorrow in my heart, the remembrance of which will read my very Soul: but yet most Noble Knight, to fulfil thy Request, I will force my Tongue to declare what my Heart denies to utter: Therefore prepare thine Ear to entertain the wofullest Tale that ever Tongue delivered.</hi>

                           <p>These unkind speeches drove <hi>Castria</hi> into such extream passion of mind, that she with a shameful look and blushing cheeks, after this manner revealed her sorrows unto him:</p>

                           <p>Which reproachful speeches being no sooner ended, but <hi>Floridon</hi> departed her Presence, not leaving behind him so much as a kind look: whereat the distressed Lady by being oppressed with intolerable grief, sunk down dead, not able to speak for a time, but at last re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>covering her senses, she began anew to complain.</p>

                        <p>Most Noble Knight, for so I guess you are, by your Furniture and outward appearance, you are now in the Confines of <hi>Barbary,</hi> the City opposite before your eyes is called <hi>Tripoly,</hi> remaining un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der the Government of <hi>Almidor,</hi> the black King of <hi>Morocco</hi> in which City he now keepeth his Court, attended on by as many gal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lant Knights as any King under the Cope of Heaven.</p>
                        <p>At which words the Noble Champion of <hi>England</hi> suddenly start<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, as though he had intelligence of some baleful news, which deeply discontented his Princely mind: his heart was presently incens<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

                        <p>
                           <hi>I have heard</hi> (quoth he) <hi>the Princely Atchievements and Mag<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nanimous Adventures of that Honoured English Knight, which you so dearly Affected, bruited through many Princes Court, and how for the Love of a Lady, he hath endured a long Imprisonment, from whence he never looked to return, but to spend the remnant of his days in lasting misery:</hi> At which the Queen let fall from her eyes such a shower of Pearled Tears, and sent such number of strained Sighs from her grieved heart, that her Sorrow s√©emed to exceed the Queen's of <hi>Carthage,</hi> when she had for ever lost the sight of her beloved Lord. But the brave-minded Champion purposed no longer to continue secret, but with his Discovery to convert her sorrowful moans to smiling joy: And so casting off his Palmers Weed, acknowledged himself to the Queen, and therewithal shewed the half Ring whereon was engraven this Poesie <hi>Ardeo Affectione:</hi> which Ring in former time (as you may read before) they had ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry equally divided betwixt them to be kept in remembrance of their plighted Faith.</p>
                        <p>Which unexpected sight highly pleased the Beauteous <hi>Sabra,</hi> and her Ioy so exceeded the bounds of Reason, that she could not speak one word, but was constrained through her new conceited pleasure to breath a sad sigh or two into the Champion's Bosom, who like a true ennobled Knight, entertained her with a loving Kiss, where after these two Lovers had fully Discoursed each to other the se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crets of their Souls, <hi>Sabra</hi> how she continued for his Love a pure Uirgin, through the secret vertue of a Golden Chain steept in Ty<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger's Blood, the which she wore seven times double about her I<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vory Neck, took him by the gentle hand, and led him into her Hus<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>band's Stables, where stood his approved Palfrey, which she for seven years had fed with her own hands: who no sooner espied the return of his Master, but he was more proud of his Presence, than <hi>Bucephalus</hi> of the <hi>Macedonian</hi> Monarch, when he most joyfully re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turned in Triumph from any Uictorious Conquest.</p>
                        <p>Now is the time (said the excellent Princess <hi>Sabra</hi>) that thou mayest seal up the quittance of our former Loves; therefore with all convenient sp√©ed take thy approved Palfrey, and thy trusty

Sword <hi>Askalon</hi> which I will presently deliver into thy hands, and with all celerity convey me from this unhappy Countrey: for the King my Husband with all his adventurous Knights, are now rode forth on Hunting, whose absence will further our flight: but if you stay till his return, it is not a hundred of the hardiest Knights in the World can bear me from this accursed Palace. At which words St. <hi>George</hi> having a mind graced with all excellent Uertues, replyed in this manner.</p>
                        <p>
                           <hi>Thou knowest, my Divine Mistress, that for thy Love I would endure as many Dangers, as</hi> Iason <hi>suffered in the Isle</hi> Calcos, <hi>so I might at last enjoy the pleasure of true Virginity. For how is it possible thou canst remain a pure Maid, when thou hast been a Crowned Queen these seven years, and every night hast enter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tained a King into thy Bed?</hi>
                        </p>
                        <p>If thou findest me not a true Maid (quoth she) in all that thou canst say or do, send me back hither again unto my Foe, whose Bed I count more loathsome than a Den of Snakes, and his sight more Ominous than the Crocodiles. As for the <hi>Morocco</hi> Crown, which by force of Friends was set upon my head. I wish that it might be turned into a blaze of quenchless Fire, so it might not endanger my Body: and for the Name of Queen, I account it a vain Title; for I had rather to be the English Lady, than the greatest Empress in the World.</p>
                        <p>At which speeches St. <hi>George</hi> willingly condescended, and with all speed purposed to go into <hi>England:</hi> And therewithal sealed an assurance with as sweet a kiss as <hi>Paris</hi> gave to lovely <hi>Hellena,</hi> when she consented to forsake her Native Countrey, and to Travel from her Husband <hi>Menelaus</hi> into <hi>Troy.</hi> So losing no time, lest delay might breed danger, <hi>Sabra</hi> furnished her self with sufficient Trea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sure, and speedily delivered to St. <hi>George</hi> his trusty Sword, which she had kept seven years for his sake, with all the Furniture be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>longing to his approved Steed; who no sooner received her proffered gifts, which he accounted dearer than the <hi>Asian</hi> Monarchy, but presently he Sadled his Horse, and beautified his strong Limbs with rich Caparisons. In the mean time, <hi>Sabra</hi> through fair Speeches and Promises obtained the good will of an Eunuch, that was appointed for her Guard in the King's absence, to ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>company them in their Travel, and to serve as a trusty Guide, if occasion required; which with the Lady stood ready at the Cham<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pion's commandment: who no sooner had furnished himself with Habiliments of War, belonging to so dangerous a Iourney, but he set his beloved Mistriss upon a gentle Palfrey, which always

                        <p>
                           <hi>Faint not my dear Lady,</hi> (said he) <hi>here is that good Sword that once preserved thee from the burning Dragon; and before thou shalt die for want of Sustenance, it shall make way to every corner of the Wilderness; where I will either kill some Venison to refresh thy hungry Stomach, or make my Tomb in the Bowels of some Monstrous Beast: Therefore abide thou here under this Tree in company of thy faithful Eunuch, till I return either with the flesh of some wild Deer, to else some flying Bird to refresh thy Spirits for a new Travel.</hi>

Thus left he his beloved Lady with the Eunuch to the mercy of the Woods, and Travelled up and down the Wilderness, till he espied a Herd of fatted Deer, from which company he fingled out the fairest, and like a tripping Satyr coursed her to Death: then with a keen-edged Sword cut out the goodliest Haunch of Ue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nison that ever Hunters eye beheld; which Gift he supposed to be most welcome to his beloved Lady. But mark what hapned in his absence to the two weary Travellers under the Tree: Where after St. <hi>George</hi>'s departure, they had not long sitten discoursing, one while of their long Iourneys, another while of their safe Delivery from the Blackamoor King, spending the stealing time away with many an ancient Story, but there appeared out of a Thicket two huge and monstrous Lions, which came directly pacing towards the two Travellers: Which fearful spectacle when <hi>Sabra</hi> beheld, ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving a heart over-charged with the extream fear of Death, wholly committed her Soul into the hands of God, and her Body almost Famished for want of Food to suffice the hunger of the two furious Lions, who by the appointment of Heaven; proffered not so much as to lay their wrathful paws upon the smallest part of her Gar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, but with eager mood assailed the Eunuch, until they had bu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ried his Body in the empty Uaults of their hungry Bowels: Then with their Teeth lately imbrued in Blood, rent the Eunuch's Steed into small pieces: Which being done, they came to the Lady, which sate quaking half dead with fear, and like two Lambs couched their Heads upon her Lap, where with her hands she stroaked down their bristled hairs, not daring almost to breathe, till a heavy sleep had over-mastered their furious Senses, by which time the Princely-minded Champion St. <hi>George</hi> returned with a piece of Uenison upon the point of his Sword: Who at that unexpected sight, stood in a Maze, whether it was best to flie for safeguard of his Life or to venture his Fortune against the Furious Lions. But at last the Love of his Lady encouraged him to a forwardness whom he beheld quaking before the dismal Gates of Death: So laying down his Uenison, he like a Uictorious Champion sheathed his approved Faulchion most furiousty in the Bowels of one of the Lions. <hi>Sabra</hi> kept the other sleeping in her Lap till his prosperous hand had likewise dispatched him: Which Adventure being performed, he first thanked Heaven for Uictory, and then in this kind manner saluted his Lady.</p>

                        <p>He had in his Pocket a Firelock, wherewith he struck fire, and kindled it with Sun-burnt Moss, and encreased the Flame with other dry wood, which he gathered in the Wilderness: Against which they Roasted the Uenison, and sufficed themselves to their own contentments. After which joyful Repast, these two Princely Persons set forward to their wonted Travels, whereby the happy Guide of Heaven so conducted their steps, that before many days passed, they arrived in the <hi>Grecian</hi> Court, even upon that day when the Marriage of the <hi>Grecian</hi> Emperor should be solemnly holden: Which Royal Nuptials, in former times had been brui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted into every Nation in the World, as well in <hi>Europe,</hi> as <hi>Africa</hi> and <hi>Asia:</hi> At which honourable Marriage the bravest Knights then living on Earth were present: For Golden Fame had bruited the Report thereof to the Ears of the Seven Champions: In <hi>Thessaly,</hi> to S. <hi>Denis</hi> the Champion of <hi>France,</hi> there remaining with his beau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teous <hi>Eglantine;</hi> into <hi>Sevil</hi> to St. <hi>James</hi> the Champion of <hi>Spain,</hi> where he remained with his lovely <hi>Celestine:</hi> To St. <hi>Anthony</hi> the Champion of <hi>Italy,</hi> then Travelling into the Borders of <hi>Scythia,</hi> with his Lady <hi>Rosalinde:</hi> likewise to St. <hi>Andrew,</hi> the Champion of <hi>Scotland,</hi> to St. <hi>Patrick</hi> the Champion of <hi>Ireland,</hi> and to St. <hi>David</hi> the Champion of <hi>Wales,</hi> who all Atchieved many Memorable Ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ventures in the Kingdom of <hi>Tartary,</hi> as you have heard before dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>coursed at large.</p>
                        <p>But now Fame, and smiling Fortune consented to make their Knightly Atchievements to shine in the Eyes of the whole World, therefore by the Conduction of Heaven, they generally arrived in the <hi>Grecian</hi> Emperor's Court: Of whose Tilts and Tourna<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments therein performed, to the honour of his Nuptials, my weavy Muse is bound to discourse.</p>

                           </p>
                        </argument>
                        <p>TO speak of the number of the Knights, that Assembled in the <hi>Grecian</hi> Court together, were a Labour over-tedious, re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quiring the Pen of <hi>Homer:</hi> Therefore will I omit the ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nourable Train of Knights and Ladies that did attend them to the Church; their costly Garments and glistring Ornaments, ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceeding the Royalty of <hi>Hecuba,</hi> the Beauteous Queen of <hi>Troy.</hi> And also I pass over the sumptuous Banquets, the Honourable Services, and Delicious Chear that Beautified the Emperor's Nuptials, with the stately Masks and Courtly Dances performed by many Noble Personages, and chiefly discourse of the Knightly Atchievements of the Seven Champions of <hi>Christendom,</hi> whose Honourable Proceedings, and Magnanimous Encounters have deserved a Golden Pen to relate: For after some few days spent in Chamber-sports, to the great pleasure of the <hi>Grecian</hi> Prince, the Emperor presently Proclaimed a solemn Iusting to be holden for the space of seven days, in the Honour of his Marriage, and ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pointed for his chief Champions the seven Christian Knights; whose Names as then were not known by any one except their own Attendants.</p>
                        <p>Against the appointed day the Turnaments should begin, the Emperor caused a wonderful large Frame of Timber-work to be erected, whereon the Empress and her Ladies might stand, for the better view of the Tilters, and at pleasure behold the Cham<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pions Encounters, most Nobly performed in the Honour of their Mistresses: likewise in the compass of the Lists were pitched se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven Tents of seven several Colours, wherein the Seven Cham<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pions might remain till the sound of the Silver Trumpets sum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moned them to appear.</p>
                        <p>Thus every thing prepared in readiness, fitting so great a Roy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>alty, the Princes and Ladies placed in their Seats, the Emperor with his new Married Empress invested on their lofty Thrones, strongly Guarded with an hundred Armed Knights, the King's
<pb facs="tcp:29556:48" rendition="simple:additions"/>
Heralds Solemnly Proclaimed the Turnaments, which in this most Royal manner began.</p>
                        <p>The first day S. <hi>Denis</hi> of <hi>France</hi> was appointed chief Champion against all Comers, who was called by the Title of the <hi>Golden Knight,</hi> who at the sound of the Trumpet entred the Lists, his Tent was of the colour of the Marigold, upon the top an artificial Sun framed, that seemed to Beautifie the whole Assembly: his Horse of an Iron-grey graced with a spangled Plume of Fea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers: Before him rode a Page in purple silk, bearing upon his Crest three Golden <hi>Flower-de-<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

Thus in this Royal manner entred St. <hi>Denis</hi> the Lists; where after he had traced twice or thrice up and down, to the open view of the whole Company, he prepared himself in readiness to begin the Turnament: Against whom ran many <hi>Grecian</hi> Knights, which were foiled by the <hi>French</hi> Champion, to the wonderful admiration of all the beholders: But to be brief, he so worthily behaved him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>self, and with such Fortitude, that the Emperor applauded him for the bravest Knight in the World.</p>
                        <p>Thus in great Royalty, to the exceeding pleasure of the Emperor, was the first day spent, till the dark Evening caused the Knights to break off Company, and repair to their Nights Repose. And the next Morning no sooner did <hi>Phoebus</hi> shew his splendid bright<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness, but the King of Heralds under the Emperor, with a noise of Trumpets awaked the Champions from their silent sleep, who with all speed prepared for the second days Exercises. The chief Cham<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pion appointed for that day, was the Uinorious Knight St. <hi>James</hi> of <hi>Spain:</hi> Which after the Emperor and Empress had seated them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves with a stately Train of Beautiful Ladies, entred the Lists upon a <hi>Spanish</hi> Gennet, betrapt with a rich Caparison: Directly over against the Emperor's Throne his Tent was pitcht, which was of the colour of Quick-silver, wherein was pourtrayed many fine Devices: Before the Tent attended four Esquires, bearing four several Escutcheons in their hands, whereon were curiously painted the four Elements: Likewise he had the Title of the <hi>Sil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver Knight;</hi> who behaved himself no less worthy of all Princely Commendations than the <hi>French</hi> Champion the day before. The third day. St. <hi>Anthony</hi> of <hi>Italy</hi> was chief Challenger in the Turna<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, whose Tent was of the Colour of the Skies, his Steed fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nished with costly Habiliments, his Armour after the <hi>Barbarian</hi> manner, his Shield plated round about with: Steel whereon was painted a Golden Eagle in a Field of Blue, which signified the an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cient Arms of <hi>Rome:</hi> Likewise he had the Title of the Azure Knight, whose matchless Chivalry for that day, won the Prize

The fourth day by the Emperor's appointment, the Ualiant and Worthy Knight St. <hi>Andrew</hi> of <hi>Scotland</hi> obtained the Honour as to be chief Challenger for the Turnament: His Tent was framed in the manner of a Ship swimming upon the Waves of the Sea, invironed about with Dolphins, Tritans, and many strange contrived Mermaids: Upon the top stood the Pi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cture of <hi>Neptune</hi> the God of the Seas, bearing in his hand a Stream<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er, whereon was wrought in Crimson Silk, a corner Cross, which seemed to be his Countrey's Arms: He was called the <hi>Red Knight.</hi> because his Horse was covered with a bloody Ueil, his worthy At<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chievements obtained such favour in the Emperor's Eyes, that he threw him his silver Gauntlet. which was prized at a thousand Portagues. where after his Noble Encounters he enioyed a sweet Repose.

Upon the sixth day the Heroical and Noble-minded Cham<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pion of <hi>Wales</hi> obtained such favour at the Emperor's hands, that he likewise was chief Challenger, who entred the Lists upon a <hi>Tar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tarian</hi> Palsrey, covered with a veil of Black, to signifie a black and Tragical day should befall those <hi>Grecian</hi> Knights, that durst approve his invincible Fortitude: His Tent was pitcht in the marmer and form of a Castle in the West side of the Lists, before the entry whereof hung a Golden Shield, whereon was lively pour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trayed a silver Griffin Rampant, upon a Golden Helmet, which signified the Ancient Arms of <hi>Britain.</hi> His Srmcely Atchieve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments not only obtained due commendations at the Emperor's hands but of the whole Assembly of the <hi>Grecian</hi> Ladies where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>with they applauded him to be the most Noble Knight that ever <gap reason="illegible" extent="1 letter">

Upon the seventh and last day of these Honourable Turnaments and most Noble Sroceedings, the Famous and Ualiant Knight at Arms, St. <hi>George</hi> of England, as Chief Challenger, entred the Lists upon a Sable-coloured Steed,

But when they behold his Uictorious Encoun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters against the <hi>Grecian</hi> Knights, they supposed him to be the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vincible. Tamer of that seven-headed Monster that climbed to the Elements, offering to pull <hi>Jupiter</hi> from his Throne. His St√©ed never gave Encounter with any Knight, but he tumbled Horse and Man to the Ground, where they lay for a time berest of Sense. The Tournaments dured for that day, from the Suns rising, till the cole-black Evening-Star appeared, in which time he Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quered five hundred of the hardiest Knights then living in <hi>Asia,</hi> and shivered a thousand Launces, to the wonderful admiration of the Beholders.</p>
                        <p>Thus were the seven days brought to an end by the Seven wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thy Champions of Christendom, in reward of whose Noble At<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chievements, the <hi>Grecian</hi> Emperor being a Man that highly favou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red Knightly Proceedings, gave them a Golden Tree with seven Branches, to be divided equally amongst them.

There likewise remained in the Court the six <hi>Thracian</hi> Uirgins that in former time lived in the shape of Swans, which were as Beautiful Ladies as ever eye beheld, also many other Ladies attended the Empress, in whose Companies the Seven Champions daily delighted: Sometimes discoursing of Amorous conceits, other times delighting themselves with sweet sounding Musick: Then spending the day in Banque<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting, Revelling, Dancing, and such like pastimes, not once inju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring their true betrothed Ladies. But their Courtly pleasures continued not long, for they were suddenly dashed with a certain News of open Wars Proclaimed against all Christendem, which fell out contrary to the expectation of the Christian Knights.

of <hi>Barbary,</hi> before <hi>Almidor</hi> the black King of <hi>Morocco,</hi> with his scattered Troops of <hi>Moors</hi> and <hi>Negroes</hi> returned from <hi>Hungary,</hi> and by Fire and Sword had wasted many of their chiefest Towns and Forts, whereby the Countrey was much weakned, and the Commons compelled to sue for Mercy at the Champions hands, who bearing true Christian minds, within their hearts continu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally pity harboured, vouchsafed to grant mercy to those that yielded their Lives to the pleasure of the Christian Knights: But when St. <hi>George</hi> had intelligence of <hi>Almidor</hi>'s approach with his weak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned Troops, he presently prepared his Soldiers in readiness to give the Moors a bloody Banquet, which was the next Morning by break of day performed, to the high honour of <hi>Christendom:</hi> but the night before, the Moors knowing the Countrey better than the Christians, got the advantage both of Wind and Sun: whereat St. <hi>George</hi> being something dismayed, but yet not discouraged, im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>boldned his Soldiers with many Heroicat Speeches, proffering them frankly the Enemies Spoils,: and so with the Sun's upri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sing entred Battel, where the Moors fell before the Christians Swords as ears of Corn before the Reapers Sickles.</p>
                        <p>During this Conflict, the Seven Champions still in the fore Front of the Battel, so adventurously behaved themselves, that they slew more <hi>Negroes</hi> than a hundred of the bravest Knights in the Christian Armies.

The Army of the Moors s√©eing their King taken, Prisoner, presently would have fled: but that the Christians being the lighter of foot, overtook them, and made the greatest slaughter of them that ever hapned in <hi>Barbary.</hi>

                        <p>Thus after the Battel ended, and the joyful sound of Uictory rang through the Christian Army, the Soldiers furnished them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves with the Enemies Spoils, and Marched by St. <hi>George</hi>'s direction to the City of <hi>Tripoly,</hi> being then almost unpeopled through the late slaughter which was there made: In which City after they had rested some days, and, refreshed themselves with wholesome food, the <hi>English</hi> Champion, in Revenge of his former proffered Injuries by the <hi>Morocco</hi> King, gave this severe Sentence of Death.</p>
                        <p>First, He commanded a brazen Cauldron to be filled with boil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing Lead and Brimstone: Then <hi>Almidor</hi> to be brought to the pl<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="2 letters">

                        <p>These words pricked the Negro's to the gall, and caused them to commit the wickedest Deed that ever was practised under the Ce<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lestial Globe of Heaven: First, they sheathed their Poniards in the Breasts of all the Merchant's Children, whose guiltless blood stained all the Chamber with a crimson colour, then with their Faulchions did they cut their Bodies in sunder, and caused seven Pies to be made of their flesh, and after served in a Banquet to their woful Parents, whom the merciless <hi>Moors</hi> set at a square Ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble, the Merchant placed directly opposite against his Wife, where they were constrained either to feed upon their own Children, or starve for want of other Sustenance.</p>

                        <p>At which words the Soldiers gave a general shout, in sign of their willing minds.

                        <p>With this Resolution marched the Christians, purposing the ut<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter confusion of the <hi>Egyptian,</hi> and the woful Ruine and Destruction of <hi>Ptolomy's</hi> sumptuous Palace.

                        </p>
                        <p>This penitent Lamentation of the Egyptian King caused the Christian Champions to relent, but especially St. <hi>George,</hi> who having a heart beautified with a well-spring of Pity, not only granted Mercy to the whole Country, but vouchsafed <hi>Ptolomy</hi> li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>berty of Life, upon condition that he would perform what he had promised; which was to forsake his false Gods, and believe in our true God, Christ Iesus.</p>
                        <p>This kindness of St. <hi>George,</hi> almost ravished <hi>Ptolomy</hi> with joy, and the whole Land, both Peers and Commons, more rejoyced at the friendship of the Christians, than if they had been made Lords of the Western World. The News of this happy Union was bruited in all the parts of <hi>Egypt;</hi> whereby the Commons that before fled for fear into Woods and Wildernesses, Dens and Caves, Hills and Mountains, returned joyfully to their own Dwellings, and caused Bonefires to be made in every City, Town, and Uillage; the Bells of <hi>Egypt</hi> rung day and night, for the space of a week; in every place was seen Banketting, Dancing and Masking; Sorrow was Banished, Wars forgotten, and Peace Proclaimed.</p>
                        <p>The King at his own Charges ordained a sumptuous and costly Banket for the Christian Champions, wherein for Bounty it ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>c√©eded that which the Trojans made, when <hi>Paris</hi> returned from

                           </gap>: As for the variety of Services which graced forth the Banquet, it were too tedious to repeat; but to be brief, what both the Land and Sea could afford, was there present. The Servitors that attended the Champions at the Banquet, were attired in Damask Uestments wrought with the purest Silk the Indian Uirgins spun upon their silver Wheels; at every Course the Servitors brought in a Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sort of Egyptian Ladies, who on their Ivory Lutes strained forth such admired Harmony, that it surpassed <hi>Orion</hi>'s Musick, which when he was cast into the Sea, caused the Dolphins to bring him safe to the shore, or the swiftness of <hi>Orpheus</hi> his silver Harp, which made both Stones and Trees to dance; or the melody of <hi>Apollo</hi>'s inspiring Musick, when he descended to the lower parts for the love of <hi>Daphne.</hi> These pleasures so ravished the Christian Champions, that they forgot the sound of Warlike Drums, which were wont to call them fortly to bloody Battels. But these delights continued but a short time, for there arrived a Knight from <hi>En<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gland,</hi> that brought such unexpected News to St. <hi>George,</hi> that changed his Ioys into extream sorrow; for after this manner be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gun the Messenger to tell his woful Tale:</p>

In this manner spent he the night away, till the Sun's bright conuienance summoned him from his restless Bed: From whence being no sooner risen, but he sent for the Steward of his House, and gave him a charge to provide a most sumptuous and costly Banquet, for he intended to invite thereunto all the principal Ladies in <hi>Coventry:</hi> What bountiful cheer was provided, I think it needless to repeat; but to be short, at the time and hour appointed the invited Ladies re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>paired; the Banquet was brought in by the Earl's Servants, and
<pb facs="tcp:29556:62" rendition="simple:additions"/>
placed upon the Table by the Earl himself: Who after many Wel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>comes given, began thus to move the Ladies to delight.</p>
                        <p>I think my House most highly honoured (said he) that you have vouchsafed to grace it with your presence, for methinks you beautifie my Hall, as the twinkling Stars beautifie the Ueil of Heaven: But amongst the number of you all, you have a <hi>Cynthia,</hi> a glistring silver Moon that for brightness exceeded all the rest; for she is fai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rer than the Queen of <hi>Cypress,</hi> lovelier than <hi>Dido,</hi> when <hi>Cupid</hi> sate upon her knee, wiser than the Prophetess of <hi>Troy,</hi> of Personage more comely than the <hi>Grecian</hi> Dame, and of more Majesty than the Queen of Love: So that all the Muses with their Ivory pens may write continually, and yet not sufficiently describe her excel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lent Ornaments of Nature.</p>
                        <p>This Commendation caused a general smile of the Ladies, and made them look one upon another whom it should be. Many other Courtlike discourses pronounced the Earl to move the Ladies de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>light, till the Banquet was ended, which being finished, there came in certain Gentlemen by the Earl's appointment, with most excel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lent musick: other some that danced most curiously, with as much Majesty as <hi>Paris</hi> in the <hi>Grecian</hi> Court. At last the Earl requested one of them to choose out his beloved Mistress, and lead her some stately Corants: Likewise requesting that none should be offended what Lady soever he did affect to grace with that Courtly pastime: At which request all them were silent, and silence is commonly a sign of consent; therefore he emboldned himself the more to make his desires known to the beholders. Then with exc√©eding courte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sie, and great humisity, he kissed the beauteous hand of <hi>Sabra,</hi> who with a blushing countenance and bashful look, accepted his courtesie, and like a kind Lady disdained not to dance with him. So when the Musicians strained forth their inspiring Melody, the Lustful Earl led her a first Course about the Hall, in as great Majesty as <hi>Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vors</hi> did the Queen of <hi>Paphos</hi> to gain her Love, and she followed with as much Grace, as if the Queen of Pleasure had been pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sent to behold their Courtly Delights: and so when the first Course was ended, he found fit opportunity to unfold his secret Love, and reveal unto the Lady his extream Passion of mind which were in these Speeches expressed.</p>

                           <hi>Most Divine and Peerless Paragon,</hi> (said he) <hi>thou only Wonder of the World for Beauty and excellent Ornaments of Nature, know that thy two twinkling Eyes that shine more brighter than the Lights of Heaven, being the true Darts of Love, have pierced my heart, and those thy crimson Cheeks, as lovely as</hi> Aurora's
<pb facs="tcp:29556:62" rendition="simple:additions"/>
                           <hi>Countenance, when she draws the Curtains of her purple Bed to entertain her wandring Lover, those Cheeks I say have wounded me with Love: therefore except thou grant me kind comfort, I am like to spend the remnant of my Life in Sorrow, Gare, and Discontent: I blush to speak what I desire, because I have setled my Love where it is unlawful, in a bosome where Kings may sleep and surfeit with delight, thy Breast I mean, most Divine Mistress, for there my Heart is kept Prisoner, Beauty is the Keeper, and Love the Key, my Ransome is a constant Mind: Thou art my</hi> Uenus, <hi>I will be thy</hi> Mars; <hi>thou art my</hi> Helen, <hi>I will be thy</hi> Mahomet: <hi>thou art my</hi> Cressida, <hi>I will be thy</hi> Croilus, <hi>thou art my</hi> Love, <hi>and I will be thy</hi> Paramour. <hi>Admit thy Lord and Husband be alive, yet hath he most unkindly left thee to spend thy young years in solitary Widow-hood? He is unconstant like</hi> Eneas, <hi>and thou more hapless than</hi> Dido. <hi>He marcheth up and down the world in glistring Armour, and never doth intend to return: He abandoneth thy presence, and lieth sporting in strange Ladies Laps; therefore, dear</hi> Sabra, <hi>live not to consume thy youth in singleness, for Age will overtake thee too soon, and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vert thy Beauty to wrinkled Frowns.</hi>
                        </p>
                        <p>To which words, <hi>Sabra</hi> would have presently made answer, but that the Musick called them to Dance the second Course, which be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing ended, she replyed in this manner.</p>
                        <p>
                           <hi>Most Noble Lord</hi> (said she) <hi>for our bounteous Banquet, cour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teous Entertainment, I give the humble thanks of a poor Lady; but for your Suit and unlawful desire, I do detest as much as the sight of a Crocodile, and your flattering Glosses I esteem as much as doth the Ocean of a drisling shower of Rain: your Syrens Songs shall never enrice me to listen to your fond Requests: but I will, like</hi> Ulyffes, <hi>stop my ears, and bury all your flattering intice<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments in the Lake of Forgetfulness. Think you that I will stain my Marriage-Bed with the least spot of Infamy, that will not proffer me one thought of wrong, for all the Treasures of the wealthy Seas? Surely the gorgeous Sun shall lose his light by Day, and the silver Moon by Night, the Skies shall fall, the Earth shall sink, and every thing shall change from Kind and Nature, before I will falsifie my Faith, or prove Disloyal to my beloved</hi> George; <hi>attempt no more, my Noble Lord, to batter the Fortress of my good Name with the Gun-shot of your Flattery, nor seek to stain my Honour with your Lustful desires. What if my Lord and Hus<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>band prove Disloyal and chose out other Loves in Foreign Lands?</hi>
                           <pb facs="tcp:29556:63" rendition="simple:additions"/>
                           <hi>yet will I prove as constant to him, as</hi> Penelope <hi>to her</hi> Ulysses; <hi>and if it be his pleasure never to return, but spend his days among strange Ladies, yet will I live in single Solitariness like to the Turtle Dove when she hath lost her Mate<g ref="char:punc">‚ñ™</g> abandoning all company, or as the mournful Swan that swims upon</hi> Meander<hi>'s Silver Streams, where she records her dying tunes to raging Billows; so will I spend away my lingering days in grief, and die.</hi>
                        </p>
                        <p>This Resolution of the vertuous Lady so daunted the Earl, that he stood like a senseless Image gazing at the Sun, not know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing how to reply: but yet when they had danced the third Course, he began anew to assault her unspotted Chastity, in these terms.</p>
                        <p>
                           <hi>Why, my dear Mistriss, have you a heart more hard than flint, that the tears of my true Love can never mollifie? Can you be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hold him plead for grace, that hath been sued unto by many wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thy Dames? I am a Man that can Command Countries, yet can I not command thy stuboorn heart.

                        </p>
                        <p>These vain Promises caused the beauteous <hi>Sabra</hi> to blush with bashfulness, and to give him this sharp Answer: <hi>Think you, my Lord, with Golden Promises to obtain the precious Gem, the which I will not lose for</hi> Europe's <hi>Treasury? Henceforth be silent in that Enterprize, and never after this, attempt to practise my dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>honour,</hi>

                           <hi>which if you do, I vow by Heaven to make it known to every one within the City, and to fill all places with the rumour of thy wilful Lust: A troop of modest Maids I will procure to haunt thee up and down the streets, to wonder at thee like an Owl, that never comes abroad but in the darkest night, this I am resolved to do, and so farewel.</hi>
                        </p>
                        <p>Thus departed <hi>Sabra</hi> with a sad Countenance, whereby the rest of the Ladies suspected the Earl had attempted her dishonour by secret conference, but they all assuredly knew that she was as far from yielding to his desires, as is the aged man to be young again, or as the Azure Firmament to be a place for Silvane Swains to inhabit. In such like Imaginations they spent away the day, till the dark night caused them to break off Company. The Earl smothered his Grief under a smiling Countenance, till the Ladies were every one departed, whom he courteously caused his Servants to conduct homewards with Torch-lights, because it began to be very dark, After their departure he accursed his own Fortune, and like a Lyon wanting food, raged up and down his Chamber, and filling euery corner with bitter exclama<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions, rending his Garments from his back, tearing his hair, beating his breast, and using all the violence he could against him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>self.</p>
                        <p>In this manner spent he away the night, suffering no sleep to close the windows of his body: His melancholy and extream pas<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sion so discontented his mind, that he purposed to give end to his sorrows by some untimely death: So when the morning appeared, he made his repair to an Drchard, where <hi>Sabra</hi> commonly once a day walked to take the Air. The place was very Belancholy, and far from the noise of People: where after he had spent some cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain time in exclaiming against the unkindness of <hi>Sabra,</hi> he pulled his Poimard from his back, and prepared his Breast to entertain the stroke of death: but before the pretended Tragedy, with his Dagger he engraved these Uerses following, upon the bark of a Walnut-tree.</p>

The Furies did incense him to a wicked Deed; the which my trembling tongue faints to report: For af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter she had walked to the farthest side of the melancholy Orchard, he rigorously ran unto her with his Dagger drawn, and catching her about the slender wast, thus frightfully threatned her.</p>

Then was he conducted to the Royal Palace, where for ten days he remained among his Lords and Knights, spending the time in great joy and pleasure; the which being fi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nished, his Lady's distress constrained him to a sudden departure, therefore he left the Guiding of his Land to twelve <hi>Egyptian</hi> Lords, binding them all by Oath to deliver it at his return; like<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wise charging them to interr the Body of <hi>Ptolomy</hi> in a sumptuous Tomb, be fitting the Body of so Royal a Potentate: Also appoint<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed the six Champions to raise their Tents, and muster up anew their Soldiers, and with all speed march into <hi>Persia,</hi> and there by dint of Bloody War, Revenge his former Injuries upon the ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cursed Souldan.</p>
                        <p>This Charge being given, the next morning by break of day he buckled on his Armour, mounted on his swift-footed Steed, and bad his Friends in <hi>Aegypt</hi> for a season, adieu; and so in company of the Knight that brought him that unlucky News, he took his Iourney with all speed toward <hi>England;</hi> in which Travel we will leave him for a time: Also passing over the speedy provision made by the Christian Champions in <hi>Egypt,</hi> for the Invasion of <hi>Persia,</hi> and return to sorrowful <hi>Sabra</hi> being in Prison, awaiting each Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nute to receive the final stroke of impartial Death: for now had the rowling Planets brought their years Iourney to an end; yet <hi>Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bra</hi> had no Intelligence of any Champion that would defend her Cause, therefore she prepared her delicate Body to receive her latest breath of Life. The time being come, she was brought to the place of Execution, whither she went as willingly, and with as much joy, as ever she went before time unto her Marriage: she had made humble submission to the World, and unfeignedly com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitted her Soul to God.

The Champion was called the Baron of <hi>Chester,</hi> a bolder and hardier Knight they thought lived not then upon the face of the whole Earth; he so advanced himself up and down as though he had b√©en able to encounter with an hundred Knights. Then the King caused the Herauld to summon in the Defendant, if there were any to defend her Cause; both Drums and Trumpets sounded three several times up and down the Fields, betwixt every rest, was a full quarter of an hour, but yet no Defendant did appear, there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore the King commanded the Executioner to set the Stake on fire.</p>

But if my hands were stained with the blood about some wicked Enter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prize, then Heaven shew present Vengeance upon me, else by some Noble Champion save my body alive.</hi> At which instant she heard the sound of a shrill Trumpet, the which S. <hi>George</hi> caused to be winded (for as then he was near:) which caused the Execution a while to be deferred. At last, they beheld afar off a stately Ban<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner waving in the Air, the which a Squire carried before S. <hi>George;</hi> then they espied near unto the Banner a most Ualiant Armed Knight, mounted upon a coal-black Palfrey, with a Warlike Launce standing in his Rest: by which sudden approach they knew him to be the same Champion that would defend the distressed Lady's Life. Then the King commanded the Drums and Trumpets to

And when the Trumpets sounded Death's Alarm, the two Knights set Spurs to their Horses, and made them run so fiercely, that at the first encounter they shivered both their Launces to their hands then rushed they together so rigorously with their Bodies and Helmets, that they fell down both to the Earth; but St. <hi>George</hi> who was the more Lusty Knight, nimbly leap'd upon his feet without any hurt, but the Baron of <hi>Chester</hi> lay still with his head downward, cast<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing from his mouth abundance of blood, for he was mightily brui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed with the fall; but when he revived from his Trance, he took his Shield, drawing out a mighty Faulchion, and with wrathful countenance ran at St. <hi>George.</hi> Now, proud Knight (quoth he) I swear by all the Saints of Heaven, to Revenge my Blood which thou hast shed: and therewithal he struck so violently upon St. <hi>George</hi>'s Shield, that it cleaved quite asunder. Then began he to wax angry, and took his Sword in great wrath and gave the Baron of <hi>Chester</hi> such a stroke, that he cut away Arm and Shoul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der and all the flesh of his side to the bare Kibs, and likewise cut his Leg almost quite in sunder, in the thickest place of his Thigh, and yet for all that, the Sword entred half a foot into the earth: then fell the Baron of <hi>Chester</hi> to the Ground, and breathed forth this lamen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>table cry.</p>

                        <p>In this manner went he to the King's Palace not known by any what he should be, but that he was a Knight of a strange Countrey: Yet <hi>Sabra</hi> many times as they passed along, desired to see his Face, and know his Name, for that he had adventured so far for her sake, and that for her Delivery he had vanquished the bravest Knight in <hi>England.</hi> Yet for all her perswasions, he kept himself undiscovered till a Troop of Ladies in company of <hi>Sabra,</hi> got him into a Chamber richly hung with Arras cloath, and there unlaced his Bever; whose Countenance when she beheld, and saw that it was her Lord and Husband which had redeemed her from Death, she sell into a dead swoon for very Ioy, but St. <hi>George</hi> sprinkled a little cold water on her face and revived her presently. After this he gave her many a kind and loving kiss, calling her the most true, and the most Loyal Lady that ever Nature framed, that to the very death would not lose one jot of her unspot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted Honour.

                        <p>AFter St. <hi>George</hi> with his vertuous Lady departed from <hi>Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land,</hi> and had Travelled through many Countreys, taking their direct Courses towards <hi>Aegypt,</hi> and the Confines of <hi>Persia,</hi> where the other six Champions remained with the Warlike Legions, at last they arrived in the Countrey of the <hi>Amazonians,</hi> a Land in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>habited by none but Women: In which Region St, <hi>George</hi> At<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chieved many brave and Princely Adventures, which are most wonderful to rehearse, as after is declared: for Travelling up and down the Countrey they found every Town and City desolate of People, yet very sumptuously built, the Earth likewise untilled, the Pastures uncherished, and every Field overgrown with Weeds, whereby he deemed that some strange Accident had befallen the Countrey, either by War, or Mortality of some grievous Plague, for they could neither set Eye of Man, Woman, nor Child, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by they were forced to feed upon Roots, and instead of brave Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>laces, they were constrained to lie on broad Pastures, upon the banks of Moss, and instead of Curtains of Silk, they had black and dark Clouds to cover them.</p>
                        <p>In this extremity they Travelled up and down for thirty days, but at last it was their happy Fortunes to arrive before a Rich Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vilion, situated and standing in the open Fields, which seemed to be the most glorious sight that ever they beheld, for it was wrought of the Richest works in the World, all of green and crimson Sat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tin, bordered with Gold, and Azure, the Posts that bare it up were of Ivory, the Cords of green Silk, and on the top thereof there stood an Eagle of Gold, and at the two Corners, two green Silver Griffons shining against the Sun, which seemed in richness to exceed the Monument of <hi>Mausolus,</hi> being one of the worlds twelve Wonders. They had not there remained long, admiring at the Beauty of the Workmanship, but at the Entry of the Pavilion there appeared a Maiden Queen Crowned with an Imperial Dia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dem, who was the fairest Creature that ever he saw. On her at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tended
<pb facs="tcp:29556:70"/>
                           <hi>Amazonian</hi> Dames, bearing in their hands Silver Bows of the Turkish Fashion, and at their backs hung Quivers full of Golden Arrows, upon their Heads they wore Silver Coronets, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>set with Pearls and precious Stones, their Attire Comely and Gallant, their Faces fair and gentle to behold, their Foreheads plain and white, the Tramels of their Hair like burnished Gold: their Brows small and proper, somewhat drawing to a brown co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lour, their Uisage plain, neither too long nor too round<g ref="char:punc">‚ñ™</g> but colou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red like Roses mixed with Lillies, their Noses long and streight, their Ruddy Cheeks somewhat smiling, their Eyes Lovely, and all the rest of their Parts and Lineaments, by Nature framed most Excellent, who had made them in Beauty without compare: The Queen her self was cloathed in a Gown of Green, strait girt un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to her Body with a Lace of Gold, so that somewhat her round and Lilly-white Breast might be seen which became her wonder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful well; beside all this, she had on a crimson Kirtle, lined with Uiolet-coloured Uelvet, and her wide Sleeves were likewise of green Silk, embroidered with flowers of Gold, and with rich Pearls. When St. <hi>George</hi> had sufficiently beheld the Beauty of this Maiden Queen, he was almost entrapped in her Love, but that the dear Affection he bare so his own Lady prevented him, whom he would not wrong for all the Treasures betwixt the high<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>est Heaven and the lowest Earth. At last, he alighted from his Horse and humbled himself unto her Excellency, and thus cour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teously began to question with her after this manner:</p>
                        <p>
                           <hi>Most Divine and Fair of all Fairs, Queen of sweet Beauty</hi> (said he) <hi>let a Travelling Knight obtain this favour at your hands, that both himself and his Lady whom you behold here wearied with Travel, may take our rest within your Pavilion for a night.

                        </p>
                        <p>This Question being Courteously demanded by St. <hi>George,</hi> caused the <hi>Amazonian</hi> Queen as kindly to reply: <hi>Sir Knight,</hi> (quoth she) <hi>(for so you seem both by your Behaviour and gallant Stature) what Favour my Pavilion may afford, be assured off; but the remembrance of my Country's Desolation which you speak of, breeds a Sea of Sorrow in my Soul, and maketh me sigh when I</hi>

                           <hi>remember it; but because you are a Knight of a strange Land, I will report it, though unto my grief: About some twelve years since, it was a Necromancer's chance to arrive within this Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trey, his name is</hi> Osmond; <hi>the cunningest Artist this day living upon the Earth, for he can at his call raise all the Spirits out of Hell, and with his Charms make Heaven to Rain continually showers of blood: my beauty at that instant tempted him to Love, and drowned his Senses so in desire, that he assailed by all perswasi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons that either Wit or Art could devise, to win me to his Will; but I having vowed my self to</hi> Diana<hi>'s Chastity, to live in singleness among these</hi> Amazonian <hi>Maids, contemned his Love, despised his Person, and accounted his perswasions as ominous Snakes; for which he wrought the destruction of this my Realm and Kingdom; for by his Magick Art and damned Charms, he raised from the Earth a mighty Tower, the Mortar whereof he mingled with Virgins Blood, wherein are such Enchantments wrought, that the light of the Sun, and the brightness of the Skies is quenched, and the Earth blasted with a terrible Vapour, and black Mist, that ascendeth from the Tower, whereby a general darkness overspread our Land, the compass of four and twenty Leagues, so this Countrey is clean wasted and destroyed, and my People fled out thereof. This Tower is haunted day and night with ghastly Fiends; and at his departure into</hi> Persia, <hi>where he now by Enchantment aids the Souldan in his Wars against the Christians, he left the guarding of the same to a mighty and ter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rible Gyant, for shape the ugliest Monster that ever Eye beheld, or ever Ear heard tell of, for he is thirty foot in length; his head three times larger than the head of an Ox: his eyes bigger than two Pewter Dishes, and his teeth standing out of his mouth more than a Foot, wherewith he will break both Iron and Steel: his Arms big and long without any measure, and his Body as black as any Coal, and as hard as Brass; also of such a strength, that he is able to carry away at once three Knights Armed: And he never eateth any other meat, but raw flesh of Mankind: he is so light, and swift, that a Horse cannot run from him; and often<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times he hath hath assailed vvith great Troops of Armed Men, but all of them could never do him any harm, neither vvith Svvord, Spear, Cross-bovv, nor any other Weapon.</hi>

                           <hi>Thus have you heard, most Noble and Courteous Knight, the true Discourse of my utter Ruine, and the Vengeance shevved upon my Countrey by this vvicked Necromancer; for vvhich I</hi>

                           <hi>Now as I am a true English Knight, (replied St.</hi> George) <hi>no sooner shall the Morning Sun appear, but I will take my Jour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ney to that Inchanted Tower, in which I'll enter in despite of the Gyant, and break the Enchantment, or make my Grave with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in the Monsters Bowels; which if I happily perform, then will I travel into</hi> Persia, <hi>and fetter up the most wicked Necromancer, and like a Bloud-hound lead him up and down the World in Chains.</hi>
                        </p>
                        <p>
                           <hi>Most dangerous is the Adventure (quoth the</hi> Amazonian <hi>Queen) from whence as yet did never Knight return; but if you be so Resolute and Noble-minded, as to attempt the Enterprize, then happy be your Fortune, and know, brave Knight, that this Tower lyeth Westward from hence some thirteen miles.</hi> And thereupon she took him by the hand, and caused <hi>Sabra</hi> likewise to alight from her Palfrey, and led them both into her Pavilion, where they were Feasted most Royally, and for that night slept securely. But when the day's bright Windows opened, and the Morning-Sun began to glister, in all haste St. <hi>George,</hi> that valiant-minded Champion arose from his sweet content, and Armed himself; where, after he had taken his Leave of the Queen, and gave her thanks for his courteous Entertainment, he also took his leave of <hi>Sabra,</hi> whom he left in company of the Queens Maidens till his return with Conquest, and so rode forth till it was Noon, and then he entred into a deep Ualley, and ever he rode lower and lower. It was then a fair Day, and the Sun shined clear; but by that time he had ridden ten Miles and a half, he had lost both the Light and the Sun, and al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>so the sight of Heaven, for it was there as dark as night, and more dismal than the deepest Dungeon.</p>
                        <p>At last he found a mighty River with streams as black as pitch, and the Banks were so high, that the Water could scarce be seen running underneath, and it was so full of Serpents, that none could enter among them that ever returned back with Life: about his head flew monstrous Birds, and d<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

                        <p>In this dangerous manner rode he on, till he came to the Gates of the Inchanted Tower, whereas the Gyant sate in his Iron Coat, upon a Block with a Mace of Steel in his hand, who at the first fight of St. <hi>George.</hi> beat his Teeth so mightily together, that they rang like the stroke of an Anvil, and he ran raging like a Fiend of Hell, thinking to have taken the Champion's Horse and all in his long Teeth that were as sharp as Steel, and to have born them presently into the Tower: but when St. <hi>George</hi> perceived his Mouth open, he took his Sword and thrust it therein so far, that it made the Gyant to roar aloud, that the Elements seemed to thun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der, and the Earth to Tremble, his Mouth smoak'd like a Fiery Furnace, and his Eyes rowled in his Head like brands of flaming Fire; the wound was so great, and the blood issued so fast from the Gyant's Mouth, that his Courage began to quail, and against his will he was forced to yield to the Champion's Mercy, and to beg for Life; to which St. <hi>George</hi> agreed, but upon condi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion that the Gyant would discover all the secrets of the Tower, and ever after be sworn his true Servant, and attend on him with all diligence: to which the Gyant swore by his own Soul, never to leave him in extremity, and to answer him truly to all Questi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons whatsoever. Then St. <hi>George</hi> demanded the cause of the Darkness, and how it might be ceased. To which the Gyant an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>swered in this manner.</p>
                        <p>
                           <hi>There was in the Country about some Twelve years since, a cunning Necromancer, that by Inchantment built this Tower, the which you now behold, and therein caused a terrible Fire to spring from the Earth, that cast such a smoak over the whole Land, whereby the People that were wont to dwell therein are fled and farnished for Hunger: Also this Enchanter by his Art made the River that you have passed, the which did ever Man before this time, without Death: Also within the Tower, near unto the fire, there stands a fair and pleasant Fountain, to which if any Knight be able to attain and cast the Water thereof into the Fire, then shall the Darkness ever after cease, and the Inchantment end, for which cause I have been bound to guard and keep the Tower from the Atchievement of any Knight.</hi>
                        </p>
                        <p>Then when the Gyant had ended his Discourse, St. <hi>George</hi> commanded him to remain at the Gate, for he would adventure to end the Inchantment, and deliver the Country from so grievous a Plague. Then went he close by the Windows of the Tower, the

which were sixteen yards in length and breadth, till he came to a little Wicket, through which he must needs enter: yet was it set as thick with Pikes of Steel as the prickles of an Urchin's skin, to the intent that no Knight should approach near unto the Door, nor once attempt to enter into the Tower; yet with great danger he opened the Wicket, whereout came such abundance of smoak, that the darkness of the Country doubled, so that neither Torch nor Candle would burn in that place; yet nevertheless St. <hi>George</hi> entred, and went downwards upon stairs, where he could see no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing, but yet felt so many great blows upon his Burgonet, that he was constrained to kneel upon his Knees, and with his Shield to defend himself or else he had been bruised to pieces. At last he came to the bottom, and there he found a fair great Uault, where he felt so terrible a heat that he sweat exceedingly, and as he felt about him, he perceived that he approached near the Fire, and go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing a little further, he espied out the Fountain, whereat he greatly rejoyced: and so he took his Shield, and bare therein as much Water as he could, and cast it into the Fire: In conclusion, he laboured so long till the fire was clean quenched: then began the Skies to receive their perfect lightness, and the Golden Sun to shine most clearly about him, where he plainly perceived how there stood upon the Stairs many great Images of Brass, holding in their hands mighty Maces of Steel, the which had done him much trouble at his coming down, but then their power was ended, the fire quenched, and the Inchantment finished.</p>
                        <p>Thus when St. <hi>George,</hi> through his Invincible Fortitude had performed this dangerous Adventure, he grew weary of Travel, what with heat and sweating, and the mighty blows he received from the brazen Images, that he returned again to the Wicket, whereat the deformed Gyant still remained: who when he beheld the Champion returned both safe and sound, he fell upon his knees before him, and said,</p>
                        <p>
                           <hi>Sir Knight, you are most welcome, and happily returned, for you are the Flower of Christendom, and the bravest Champion of the World.

                        </p>
                        <p>This humble submission of the Gyant caused the Champion to rejoyce, not for his Overthrow, but that he had gotten so mighty a Seruant; then unlaced he his Helmet, and lay down after his wea<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

But on the sudden, before the Queen and her Uirgins were aware, St. <hi>George</hi> arrived before the Davilion, dutifully attended on by the Gyant, who bore upon his shoulder the Body of a tall Oak, by which the Qu√©en knew that his Prowess had red√©emed her Country from darkness, and delivered her from her Sorrow, Care, and Trouble: so in company of her Maids, very gorge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ously attired, she conducted the Champion to a Bower of Roses, intermingled with creeping Uines, the which in his absence they planted for his Lady's delight. There found he <hi>Sabra</hi> at her Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vine Prayers, like to a solitary Widow, clad in mourning Habi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liments; but when she beheld her Lord return in safety, she ba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nished Grief, and in haste ran unto him, and in his bosom ravished her self with pleasure.</p>
                        <p>But to speak how the <hi>Amazonian</hi> Queen feasted them, and in what manner she and her Maids devised Pastime for their con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tents, were too tedious to repeat, but when night gave end to their pleasures, and sleep summoned all things to a quiet silence, the Queen brought them to a very sumptuous Lodging, wherein stood a Bed framed with Ebony-wood, over-hung with many pendants of Gold, the Tick was stuffed with Down of Turtle-Doves, the Sheets of <hi>Median</hi> Silk, thereon <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

But all this while the Gyant ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver entred the Pavilion, but slept as soundly at the root of a Pine-tree, as St. <hi>George</hi> did in his imbroidered Bed, for he knew not what pleasures belonged thereunto, nor never before that time be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>held any Womans Face. At last, the Night withdrew her black Curtains, and gave the Morning leave to appear, whose pleasant light caused St. <hi>George</hi> to forsake his Bed, end to walk some few miles to over-view the Countrey; in which Iourney he took such exceeding pleasure, that he thought it the goodliest Realm that ever he saw, for he perceived well how it was full of Worldly Wealth.</p>
                        <p>At last, he climbed up to the top of an high Mountain being some two miles from the Queens Pavilion, whereon he stood and beheld many stately Towns and Towers, high and mighty Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stles, many large Woods and Meadows, and many pleasant Ri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vers; and about the Towns, fair Uines, goodly Pastures and Fields. At last, he beheld the City of <hi>Argenia</hi> shining against the Sun, the place where the Queen in former time was wont to keep her Court; which City was invironed with deep Ditches, the Wall strongly builded, and more than five hundred Towers made of Lime and Stone; also he saw many fair Churches covered with Lead, having Tops and Spires of Gold, shining most gor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>geously; with Weather-cocks of Silver, glistring against the Sun. Also he saw the Burgesses Houses stand like Palaces closed with high and strong Walls, Barred with Chains of Iron from House to House, whereat in his heart he praised much the Nobleness and Richness of the City, and said to himself, that it might well be cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led <hi>Argenia,</hi> for it seemed to be of <hi>Argen<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

                        </p>
                        <p>At which Speeches she took her Chain which was doubled twenty times about her Neck, and left it lying all besmeared in the blood of those Uirgins whom the Gyant had Ravished and slain, and so be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>took her self to a sad solitary Life, intending never to come in the sight of Men, but to spend her days wandring in the Woods: where we will likewise leave her for a time, and speak of St. <hi>George,</hi> who by this, was returned to the Queen's Pavilion, where he missed his Lady, and had intelligence, how that she in company of seven other Ladies, walked in the Morning into a pleasant Grove to hear the Melody of Birds, and since that time no News hath been heard of them; for as then it grew toward night, which caused St. <hi>George</hi> greatly to mistrust that some Mischance had befallen his Lady. Then he demanded what was become of the Gyant, but answer was made, that he was never seen nor heard of since Morning; which caused him greatly to suspect the Gyant's Treachery, and how by his means the Ladies were prevented of their purposed plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sures.</p>
                        <p>Therefore in all haste, like a frantick man he ran into the Thicket, filling every corner with Clamors and resounding Ecchoes of her name, and calling for <hi>Sabra,</hi> through every Bramble Bush: but there he could neither hear the voice of <hi>Sabra,</hi> nor the answer of any other Lady, but the woful Ecchoes of his Exclamations, which ratled through the leaves of the Trees. Then began he to wax somewhat Melancholy and Passionate, passing the time away till bright <hi>Cynthia</hi> mounted on the Hemisphere, by whose glistring Beams he saw the ground besprinkled with purple gore; and found the Chain that <hi>Sabra</hi> was wont to wear about her Neck, all be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>smeared in Blood: he bitterly complained against his own Fortune, and his Ladies hapless Destiny, for he supposed then that the Gy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ant had Murdered her.</p>

Here is the chain besmeared in blood, which at our first Acquaintance I gave her in a Courtly Mask: this Golden Chain, I say, stained with the blood of my dear Lady, shall for evermore be kept within my Bosome, near unto my bleeding heart, that I may still remember her true Love, Faith, and Constancy. But fond fool that I am, why do I talk in vain? it will not recompence her murthered Soul, the which methinks I hear how it calls for Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venge in every corner of the Grove. It was I that left her care<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lesly within the danger of the Gyant, whom I little mistrusted, therefore I will meet her in</hi> Elysium <hi>shades, and crave remission for my committed Trespass, for on this Oak I will abridge my Life, as did the worthy Knight</hi> Melmeropolion <hi>for the Love of</hi> Sillara.</p>
                        <p>Which Lamentation being no sooner ended, but he took the Chain of Gold, and fastned one end to the Arm of a great Oak, and the other end to his Neck, intending presently to strangle himself; but Heaven prevented his desperate intent after a strange manner: for under the same Tree the brained Gyant lay, not yet fully dead, who in this manner spake to St. <hi>George.</hi>

At last, her hunger increased, and her desire thirsted so much after food, that except she received some comforta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble sustenance, her life were in danger.

                           <hi>Sabra</hi> caused St. <hi>George</hi> to buckle on his Armour, and to unsheath his trusty sword, ready to goar the Intrails of some Deer: who swore by the honour of true Knighthood, never to rest in peace, till he had purchased her hearts content.</p>
                        <p>

                        <p>At which sight <hi>Sabra</hi> like one berest of Sense, started from her Bed, and to her weak power offered to follow the Beasts, but all in vain; for before she could get without her Cabine, they were past fight, and the Childrens cry without her hearing: then like a Dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>contented Woman she turned back, beating her Breast, rending her Hair, and Raging up and down her Cabine, using all the Ri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gour she could devise against her self; and had not St. <hi>George</hi> re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turn'd the sooner, she had most violently committed her own slaughter; but at his return, when he beheld her face stained with tears, her head disrobed of Ornaments, and her Ivory Breast all to be-rent, he cast down his Uenison in all hast, and asked the cause of her Sorrow.</p>
                        <p>
                           <hi>Oh</hi> (said she) <hi>this is the wofullest day that ever hapned to me, for in the time of your unhappy Hunting, a Lioness, a Ty<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gress, and a Wolf came into the Cabin, and took my Children from their Cradles; what is become of them I know not, but greatly I fear by this time they are intombed within their hungry Bowels.</hi>

                        <p>Many ways wandred St. <hi>George,</hi> sometimes in Ualleys where Wolves and Tygers lurk; sometimes in Mountain tops, where Lyons whelps do sport and play, and many times in dismal Thickets, where Snakes and Serpents live.</p>
                        <p>Thus wandred St. <hi>George</hi> up and down the Wilderness for the space of two days hearing no news of his unchristened Children. At last he approached the sight of a pleasant River, which smoothly glided down betwixt two Mountains, into whose streams he pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>posed to cast himself; and so by a desperate death give end to his Sorrows; but as he was committing his body to the mercy of the Waters, and his Soul to the pleasure of the Heavens, he heard a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>far off the rusul shriek, as he thought, of a comfortless Babe: which sudden noise caused him to refrain from his desperate purpose, and with more discretion to tender his own safety: then casting his eyes aside, it was his happy Destiny to espy three inhumane Beasts lying at the foot of a Hill, tumbling themselves against the warm Sun, and his three pretty Babes sucking from their Dugs, their most unkind Milk; which spectacle so encouraged the Cham<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pion, that without farther advisement, with his single Sword, he assailed at one time the three Monsters, but so furiously they pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sued him, that he little prevailed; and being almost breathless, was forced to get into an Orange-tree, else he had been buried in their merciless Bowels: but when the three wild Beasts perceived him above their reaches, and that by no means they could come near him, with their wrathful Iaws, they so rent and tore the root of the tree, that if by policy he had not prevented them, the Tree, had
<pb facs="tcp:29556:79" rendition="simple:additions"/>
b√©en pulled in pieces, for at that time it was so full of ripe Oran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ges, and so overladen, hat the branches seemed to bend, and the bows to break, of which fruit he cast such abundance down to the Beasts, whereby they restrained their furies, and fed so fast thereon that in short time they grew drunk, and quite overcome with a dead and heavy sleep: this good and happy fortune caused St. <hi>George</hi> nimbly to leap off the Tree, and with his keen edged Sword, cut off ther heads from ther bodies, the which being done, he went to his Children, lying comfortless upon a Mossie bank; who so pleasantly smiled in his face, that they made him greatly to rejoyce, and to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive as great pleasure in their sights, as though he had been honou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red with the Conquests of <hi>Caesar,</hi> or the Royalty of <hi>Alexander;</hi> therefore after he had given them his Blessing, he took them up in his Arms, and spake these words following.</p>
                        <p>
                           <hi>Come, come, my pretty Babes, your safe Deliveries from these inhumane Monsters, will add long Life unto your Mother, and hath preserved your Father from a desperate Death; from hence<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>forh let Heaven be your guide, and send you as happy Fortunes as</hi> Remus <hi>and</hi> Romulus <hi>the first Founders of Imperious</hi> Rome, <hi>which in their Infancies were Nursed with the Milk of a Ravenous Wolf, and as Prosperous in your Adventures, as was that</hi> Persi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>an <hi>Potentate, which fed on the Milk of a Bitch.</hi>
                        </p>
                        <p>At the end of which speeches, he approached the Cabine, where he left his Lady mourning for the loss of her Children; but at his return he found her without sense or moving; being not able to give him a joyful welcome, whereat he fell into this extream passi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of Sorrow,</p>

                           <hi>Christendom,</hi> where after some few days Travel, they arrived in the Bohemian Court, where the King of that Countrey, with two other Bordering Princes, most Royally Christened his Children. The Eldest they named <hi>Guy,</hi> the Second <hi>Alexander,</hi> and the Third <hi>David;</hi> the which being performed, and the Triumphs ended, which in most sumptuous manner continued for the space of one Month, then the <hi>Bohemian</hi> King, for the great Love he bare to St. <hi>George</hi> provided most honourably for his Childrens bringing up.</p>
                        <p>First, He appointed thr√©e several Embassadors, with all things necessary for so Princely a Charge, to conduct the three Infants to three several Countries. The first, and eldest, whose Fortune was to be a Soldier, he sent to the Imperial City of <hi>Rome,</hi> (be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing then the Wonder of the World for Martial Discipline) there by the Emperor to be Trained up. The Second, whose Fortune was to be a Courtly Prince, he sent to the Rich and Plentiful Countrey of <hi>England,</hi> being the Pride of <hi>Christendom</hi> for all de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lightful pleasures, The Third and Last, whose Fortune was to be prove a Scholar, he sent into <hi>Germany,</hi> unto the University of <hi>Wit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tenburg,</hi> being thought at that time to be the excellentest place of Learning that remained throughout the whole World.</p>
                        <p>Thus were St. <hi>George</hi>'s Children provided for by the <hi>Bohemian</hi> King, for when the Embassadors were in Readiness, the Ships for their Passage furnished, and Attendance appointed, St. <hi>George,</hi> in Company of his Lady, the King of <hi>Bohemia</hi> with his Qu√©en, and a Train of Lords, and Gentlemen, and Ladies, Conducted them to Ship-board, where the Wind served them prosperously, that in a short time they had bad adieu to the Shore, and Sailed chearfully away. But as St. <hi>George</hi> returned back to the <hi>Bohe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mian</hi> Court, it was his chance to come by an old Ruinated Mona<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stery, under whose Walls in former time his Father was Buried, the which he knew by certain Uerses carved in Stone over his Grave, by the Commons of the Countrey (as you may read be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore in the beginning of this History.) Over the same he requested of the King that he might Erect a Stately Monument, that the remembrance of his Name might live for ever, and not be Buried in the Grave of Obscurity. To which reasonable Demand, the King most willingly consented, and presently gave special com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mandment that the cunningest Architectors that remained within his Dominion, should forthwith be sent for, and withal, gave a Tun of Gold forth of his own Treasury, towards the performance thereof. The sudden report of this memorable Deed being bruited abroad, caused Workmen to come from every place of their own

under the Subjection of the <hi>Egyptian</hi> Monarchy, and the greatest City in the World, for it was in breadth full threescore Miles, and had by just account, within the Walls, Twelve Thousand Churches, besides Abbies, Priories, and Houses of Religion; but when St. <hi>George</hi> with his stately Attendants entred the Gates, they were presently entertained with such a joyful sound of Bells, Trum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pets, and Drums, that it seemed like the inspiring Musick of Heavenly Angels, and to exceed the Royalty of <hi>Caesar</hi> in <hi>Rome,</hi> when he returned from the World's Conquest.

Come, Souldiers, come you Followers of those coward<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly Champions; unsheath your warlike Weapons, and follow him whose Soul hath vowed either to redeem them from the Necromancer's Charms or die with honour in that Enterprize. If ever mortal Creatures war<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red with damned Furies, and made a passage to enchanted Dales, where Devils dance, and warlike Shadows in the Night: Then Souldiers let us march unto that Pavilion, and chain the cursed Charmer to some blasted Oak, that hath so highly dishonoured Christendom.</hi>

                        <p>First, When we beheld them discoved of their warlike Attire, their Furniture hung up, and themselves secretly Sleeping upon the laps of Ladies, he fell into these discontented Speeches:</p>
                        <p>

These heroical Speeches were no sooner finished, but the cham<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pions like Men amazed, rose from their Ladies bosoms, and be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing ashamed of their follies, they submissively crabed Pardou, and vowed by Protestations, never to sleep in Beds of Down, nor never unbuckle their Shields from their weary arms, till they had won their Credits in the Fields again, nor never would be counted his deserved followers, till their Triumphe were enro<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

But why exclaim I thus in vain, when Heaven itself preserves their Happiness? Now all my Magick Charms are ended, and all my Spirits forsaken me in my need, and here am I fast chained up to starve and dye. Have I had power to rend the Vales of Earth, and shake the mighty Mountains with my Charms? Have I had power to raise up dead Mens shapes from kingly Tombs, and can I not unchain myself from this accursed Tree? O no, for I am fettered up by the immortal Power of the Christians God; against whom because I did rebel, I am now condemned to everlasting Fire. Come all ye Necromancers in the World, come all you Sorce<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rers and Charmers, come all you Schollars from the learned Universi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties, come all you Witches, Beldams, and Fortune-tellers, and all that practice devilish Arts, come, take example by the story of my Eyes.</hi>

Seven days the Battle continued without ceasing; they slew two hundred thousand Souldiers, besides a number that fled away and drownded them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves; some cast themselves headlong down from the top of high Trees; some made slaughter of themselves, and yielded to the mercies of the Christians; but the Souldan with his Princes riding in their Iron Chariots, endured the Christians Encoun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters, till the whole Army was discomfitted, and then by force and violence they were compelled to yield. The Souldan hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned into the hands of St. <hi>George,</hi> and six Uice-roys to the other six Champions; where after they had sworn Allegiance to the Christian Knights, and had promised to forsake their Mahomet, they were not only set at liberty, but used most honourably; but the Souldan himself having a Heart fraught with despight and tyranny, contemned the Champions Courtesies, and utterly disdained their Christian Governments, protesting, that the Heavens should first lose their wonted Brightness, and the Seas forsake their sooelling Tides, before his Heart should yield to their intended Desires; whereupon St. <hi>George</hi> being resolved to revenge his Injuries, commanded that the Souldan should be disrobed from all his princely Attire, and in base Apparel sent to Prison, then to the Dungeon where he himself had endured so long Imprisonment, as you heard in the beginning of this Hi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>story, which strict Commandment was presently performed; in which Dungeon the Souldan had not long continued, sufficing his hungry Stomach with the Bread of musty Bran, and stanch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing his thirst with Channel-water, but he began to grow despe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rate, and weary of his Life, and at last fell into this woful Lamentation:</p>

                        <p>This being said, he desperately ran his head against a Mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble pillar, standing in the middle of the Dungeon, and dasht his Brains from out of his hateful Head; the news of whose death when it was bruited in the Champions ears, they profered no violence to his liveless Body, but in tombed him in a sumptuous Sepulchre; and after that St. <hi>George</hi> took upon him the Govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of <hi>Persia,</hi> and there established good and Christian Laws; also he gave to the other six Champions, six several Kingdoms belonging to the Crown of <hi>Persia,</hi> and six named them six Uice<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>roys or petty Kings. This being done, he took Trute with the World, and triumphantly marched towards Christendom with the Conquest of three imperial Diadeuis, that is to say, of <hi>Ae<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gypt, Persia,</hi> and <hi>Morocco;</hi> in which Iourney he erected many stately Monuments, in remembrance of his Uictories and hero<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ical Atchievements; and through every Country that they mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ched, there flocked to them an innumerable company of Pagans, that desired to follow him into Christendom, and to be christened in their Faith, protesting to forsake their Gods, whose Worship<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pers were none but Tyrants, and such as delighted in nothing but shedding of Blood: to whose Requests, St. <hi>George</hi> present<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly condescended, not only in granting them their Dellres, but also in honouring them with the favour of his princely Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tenance. This Courtesie of the English Champion mecited, such a glistering Glory through the World, that as far as ever the golden Globes of Heaven extended their Lights, St. <hi>George</hi>'s Honour was bruited; and not only his marchless Adventures charactered in brazen Tables, but his martial Exploits painted in every Temple, so that the Heathen Poets <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 word">

Well, what they say of me I do not care, thy Delight only is my Desire; Accept it, and I am satisfied; Reject it, and this shall be my Pennance, never again to come in Print. But ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving better hope, I boldly lead thee to the Main, from this doubtful Flood of Suspition, where I rest. Walk on in the History, as in an overgrown and ill husbanded Garden; if a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mong all the Weeds thou finds one pleasing Flower, I have my Wish.</p>

                        <p>But at last, St. <hi>George</hi>'s three Sons, <hi>Guy, Alexander,</hi> and <hi>David,</hi> being all three born at one Birth, as you heard before, in the Wilderness, and sent into three several Kingdoms by their careful Father to be trained up; the one in <hi>Rome,</hi> to the warlike Romans, another into <hi>Wittenburg,</hi> to the learned Germans, the third unto <hi>Britain,</hi> to the valiant English. But now being grown to some ripeness of Age, and agility of Strength, they desired much to visit their Parents, whom they had not seen from their Infancies, lying in their Cradles; and to crave at his hands the honour of true Knighthood, and to wear the gol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>den Spur of Christendom.</p>
                        <p>This earnest and princely Request so highly pleased their Tutors, that they furnished them with a stately Train of Knights, and sent them honourably into <hi>England,</hi> where they arrived all three at one time in the famous City of <hi>London,</hi> where their Entertainments were most princely, and their Welcome so ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nourable, that I want Art to describe, and Memory to express.</p>

to be short, St. <hi>George</hi> (whose Love was dear unto his Chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren) in his own Perlon conducted them unto their Lodgings, whereas they spent that day and the night following in royal Banquetting amongst their princely Friends.</p>

                        <p>Thus, in this gallant manner, rode forth these Hunters to their princely Pastimes, where after they had ridden some six Miles from the City of <hi>London,</hi> there fell from St. <hi>George</hi>'s Nose thr√©e drops of purple Blood; whereat he suddenly start<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, and therewithal he heard the croaking of a flight of Night-Ravens, that hovered by the Forrest's side, all which he judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed to be dismal signs of some ensuing Stratagem; but having a princely Mind, he was nothing discouraged thereat, nor lit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle mistrusted the woful Accident that after happned, but with a noble Resolution entered the Forrest, accounting such fore-tel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling Tokens for old Wives Ceremonies, wherein they had not passed the compass of half a Mile, but they started a wild swift Stagg, at whom they uncoupled their Hounds, and gave Bridle to their Horses, and followed the Game more swifter than Py<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rates pursue the Merchants Ships upon the Seas; but now be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hold how frowning Fortune changed their pleasant Pastime to a sad and bloody Tragedy; for <hi>Sabra</hi> proffering to keep pace with them, delighted to behold the valiant Encounters of her young Sons, and being careless of herself, through the over swiftness of her Steed, she slipped beside her Saddle, and so fell directly

And now to you my Sons this Blessing do I leave behind, even by the Pains that forty Weeks I once endured for your sakes, when as you lay enclosed in my Womb, and by my Travels in the Wilderness, whereas my Groans upon your Birth-day did (in my thinking) cause both Trees and Stones to drop down Tears, when as the merciless Tygers and tameless Lyons did stand like gentle Lambs, and mourned to hear my Lamentations, and by a Mother's Love that ever since I have born you, imitate and follow your Father in all his honourable Attempts, harm not the silly Infant, nor the help<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>less Widow, defend the Honour of distressed Ladies, and give freely unto wounded Souldiers, seek not to stain the unspotted Virgins with your Lust, and adventure evermore to redeem true Knights from Cap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tivity, live evermore professed Enemies to Paganism, and spend your Lives in the Quarrel and Defence of Christ, that Babes (as yet unborn)</hi>

                        <p>These words were no sooner ended, but with a heavy sigh she yielded up the Ghost; whereat St. <hi>George</hi> (being impatient in his sorrows) fell upon her liveless Body, tearing his Hair, and rending his Hunter's Attire from his back into many pieces; and at last when his Griefs were some what diminished, he burst out into these bitter Lamentations:</p>

                           <hi>Gone is the Star</hi> (quoth he) <hi>that lighted all the Nothern World; whithered is the Rose that beautified our Christian Fields; dead is the Dame that for her beauty stained all Christian Women, for whom I'll fill the Air with everlasting Mones. Let this day henceforth be fatal to all times, and counted for a dismal day of Death: let never the Sun shew forth his Beams thereon again, but Clouds as black as pitch cover the Earth with fearful Darkness: let every Tree in this accursed For<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rest, henceforth be blasted with unkindly Winds: let Brambles, Herbs and Flowers consume and wither: let Grass and blooming Buds perish and decay, and all things near the place where she was slain be turned to dismal, black and ghastly colour, that the Earth itself in mourning Garments may lament her loss: let never Bird sing chearfully on tops of Trees; but like the mournful Musick of the Nightingale, fill all the Air with fatal Tunes: let bubling Rivers murmure for her loss, and silver Swans that swim thereon sing doleful Melody: let all the Dales be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>longing to these fatal Woods be covered with green bellied Serpents, croaking Toads, hissing Snakes, and sigh-killing Cockatrices: in blast<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed Trees, let fearful Ravens shrick, let Howlets cry, and Crickets sing, that after this it may be called a place of dead Mens wandring Ghosts. But fond Wretch, why do I thus Lament in vain, and bath her bleed<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing Body with my Tears, when Grief by no means will recal her Life? yet this shall satisfie her Soul, for I will go a Pilgrimage unto</hi> Ierusa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lem, <hi>and offer up my Tears to Jesus Christ upon his blessed Sepulchre, by which my stained Soul may be washt from this bloody Guilt, which was the cause of this sorrowful day's mishap.</hi>

                        <p>Thus in this sorrowful manner wearied they the time away, filling the Woods with echoes of their Lamentations, and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording their Dolours to the whistling Winds; but at last when black Night began to approach, and with her cable Mantle to overspread the crystal Firmament, they retired with her dead Body, back to the City of <hi>London,</hi> where the report of this Tragical Accident, drowned their Friends in a Sea of Sorrow; for the news of her untimely Death was no sooner bruited abroad, but the same caused both Did and Young to lament the loss of so sweet a Lady. The silver-headed Age that had wont in scar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>let Gowns to meet in Counsel, sat now in discontented Griefs; the gallant Youth and comely Uirgins, that had wont to beau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tifie the Streets with costly Garments, went drooping up and down in mournful Uestures; and those remorseless Hearts that seldom were oppressed with Sorrow, now constrained their eyes like Fonutains to destil floods of brinish and pearly Tears.</p>
                        <p>This general Grief of the Citizens continued for the space of thirty Days; at the end whereof, St. <hi>George</hi> with his Sons and the other Champions interred her Body very honourably, and erected over the same a rich and costly Monument (in sum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ptuons State, like the Tomb of <hi>Mausolus,</hi> which was called one of the Wonders of the World, or like to the Pyramids of <hi>Greece,</hi> which was a stain to all Architects) for thereon was portray<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed the Queen of Chastity with her Maidens, bathing them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves in a crystal Fountain, as a witness of her wonderous Chastity, against the lustful Assailments of all lastivious At<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tempts.</p>
                        <p>Thereon was also most lively pictured a Turtle dove sitting up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on

a Tree of Gold, in sign of the true Love that she bore to her betrothed Husband.</p>
                        <p>Also a silver coloured Swan swimming upon a crystal River, as a token of her Beauty; for as the Swan excelleth all other Fowls in Whiteness, so she excelled all the Ladies in the World for Beauty.</p>
                        <p>I leave to speak of the curious Workmanship of the Pinacles that were framed all of the purest Ieat, enamelled with Silver and Iasper-stanes: and I omit the Pendants of Gold, the Es<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cutcheous of Princes, and the Arms of Countries that beauti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fied her Tomb, the Discourse whereof requires an Oratour's G<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>loquence, or a Pen of Gold dipt in the Dew of <hi>Helicon,</hi> flowing from <hi>Parnassus</hi>'s Hill, where all the Muses do inhabit.

                           </p>
                        </argument>
                        <p>THe swift footed Steeds of <hi>Titan</hi>'s fiery Car had almost finished a Year, since <hi>Sabra</hi>'s Funeral was solemnized; in which time St. <hi>George</hi>'s three Sons had visited their Mother's Tomb oftner than were Days in the Year, and had shed more sorrowful Tears thereon, in remembrance of her Love, than are Stars in the glistering Horizon; but at last these thr√©e young Princes fell at a civil Discord and mortal Strife, which of them should bear the truest Love to their Mother's dead Body, and which of them should be held in greatest Esteem: for before many Days were expired, they concluded to offer up their several Devotions at her Tomb; and he that devised a Gift of the rarest Price, and of the straugest Quality, should be held worthy of the greatest Honour, and accounted the Noblest of them all. This Determination was sp√©edily performed, and in so short a time accomplished, that it was wonderful to Discourse.</p>
                        <p>The first thinking to exceed his Brothers in the strangeness of his Gift, made repair unto a cunning Enchantress, which had a biding in a secret Cave adjoyning to the City, whom he procured (through many rich Gifts and large Promises) by Art to devise a means to get the Honour from his Brethren, and to give a Gift of that strange nature, that all the World might wonder at the report thereof.</p>
                        <p>The Enchantress (being won with his Promises) by Art and Magick Spells, devised a Garland containing a<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

                        <p>Lastly, The third Brother likewise repaired with no outward Devotion or worldly Gift; but clad in a Uesture of white Silk, bearing in his hand an Instrument of Death, like an innocent Lamb going to Sacrifice; or one ready to be offered up for the love of his Mother's Soul.</p>
                        <p>This strange manner of repair caused his other Brothers to stand attentively, and with diligent Eyes to be hold his purpose.</p>

                        <p>
                           <hi>I have not without great wonder (most reverend and courteous old Man) heard the strange Discourse of thy admirable Fountain, and do not a little lament that one of so kind and liberal a Disposition should be dispossessed of such exceeding Riches, neither am I less sorry that so in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>humane a Monster, and known Enemy to all Courtesie and kindness, should have the Fruition of so exceeding great Treasure; for to the Wicked, Wealth is the cause of their more Wickedness. But that which most grieveth me, is, That having had so many valiant Knights to his Sons, they all were so unfortunate to fall into the hands of that relentless Monster; but be comforted, kind old Man, for I hope by the Power of my Maker, we were directed hither to Punish that hate<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful Giant, Revenge the Injuries offered to thine Age, satisfie with his Death, the Death of thy Children, if they be Dead, and restore to thy bounteous Possession that admirable rich Fountain again.</hi>
                        </p>
                        <p>
                           <hi>And now to you my valiant Champions I speak, that with me through many Dangers have adventured; let us couragiously attempt this rare Adventure, wherein such Honour to our Names, such Happiness to our Friends, such Glory to God consists, in recovering Right to the Wrong<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, and punishing rightfully the Wrongers of the Oppressed; and that there be no Contention among us who shall begin this Adventure, for I know all you thirst after Honour, therefore let Lots be made, and to whomsoever the chief Lot falleth, let him be foremost in Assayling the Giant, and so good Fortune be our Guides.</hi>
                        </p>
                        <p>The exceeding Ioy which the old Iew conceived at the sp√©ech<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>es of St. <hi>George,</hi> had near-hand bereft him of the use of Sense, for above measure was he over-joyed; but at length recovering use of Speech, he thus thankfully brake forth:</p>

                           <hi>How infinitely I find myself bound unto you, you famous and undoubt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed Christian Champions, all my Ableness is not able to express, only Thankfulness from the depth of a true Heart shall to you be rendred.</hi>

                        <p>The Champions without more words, discoving themselves from their Pilgrims Attire, every one elected forth an Armour fitting to their portly Bodies, then ready in the Iew's House; instead of their Ebon Staves tipt with Silver, they wielded in their Hands steeled Blades, and their Feet that had wont to in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dure a painful Pilgrimage upon the bare Ground, were now
<pb facs="tcp:29556:101" rendition="simple:additions"/>
ready drest to mount the lofty stirrop; but as I said, they pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>posed not generally to assail the Giant, but singly every one to try his one Fortune, thereby to obtain the greater Honour, and their Deeds to merit the higher Fame; therefore the Lots being cast among themselves which should begin the Adventure, the Lot fell first to St. <hi>Dennis</hi> the noble Champion of <hi>France,</hi> who greatly rejoyced at his fortune, and so departed for y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> night to get things in readiness; but the next morning no sooner had the gold<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>en Sun displayed his Beauty in the East, but St. <hi>Dennis</hi> arose from his sluggish bed, and attired himself in costly Armour, and mounted upon a Steed of Iron-gray, with a spangled Plume of purple Feathers on his Butgonet, spangled with Stars of Gold, resembling the Azure Firmament beautified with glistering Stars. Where ofter he had taken leave of the other Champi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, and had demanded of the Iew where the Giant had his re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sidence, he departed forward on his Iourney, and before the Sun had mounted to the top of Heaven, he approached to the Giant's presence, who as then sate upon a Block of Steel direct <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="2 letters">

                        <p>The first sight of his ugly and deformed proportion almost daunted the valour of the <hi>French</hi> Champion, that he stood in a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maze, whether it was better to try the Adventure, or return with dishonour back to his other Fellow-knights; but having a heart furnished with true magnanimity, he chose rather to die in the Encounter, then to return with Infamy; so committing his Trust to the unconstant Queen of Chance, he s<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

the Fountain, in a Ualley betwixt two mighty Mountains; in which Prison he closed the <hi>French</hi> Champion, amongst fourteen o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther Knights, that were Sons to the courteous Iew, as you heard before discoursed, and being proud of that Attempt, he re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turned to the block of Steel, where we will leave him sitting glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rying in his own Conceit, and speak of the other Champions remaining in the Iew's house, expecting the <hi>French</hi> Knight's fortunate return; but when the sable Curtains of Darkness were drawn before the crystal Windows of the Day, and Night had taken possession of the Elements, and no news was heard of the Champion's Success, they judged presently that either he was slain in the Adventure, or else discomfitted and taken Prisoner; therefore they cast Lots again which of them the next morning should try his Fortune, and revenge the <hi>French</hi> Knight's Quar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rel; so the Lot fell to St. <hi>James,</hi> the noble Champion of <hi>Spain,</hi> whereat his princely Heart rejoyced more than if he had been made King of the western World. So in like manner on the next morning by break of day he attired himself in rich and cost<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly Armour like the other Champion, and mounted upon a Span<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nish Gennet, in pace most swift and speedy, and in portly state like to <hi>Bucephalus</hi> the proud St√©ed of <hi>Macedonian Alexander;</hi> his Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parison was in colour like to the Waves of the Sea; his Burgo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>net was beautified with a spangled Plume of sable Feathers, and upon his Breast he bore the Arms of <hi>Spain,</hi> Thus in this gallant manner departed he from the Iew's habitation, leaving the other Champions at their divine Contemplations for his happy Success; but his Fortune chanced contrary to his Wishes, for at the Giant's first Encounter he was likewise born to the Rock of Stone, to accompany St. <hi>Dennis.</hi>

The fifth Lot fell to St. <hi>Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trick</hi> of <hi>Ireland,</hi> as brave a Knight as ever Nature created, and as adventurous in his Atchievements: If ever <hi>Hector</hi> upon his Phrygian Steed pranced up and down the Streets of <hi>Troy,</hi> and made that Age admire his Fortitude, this Irish Knight might countervail his Ualour: For no sooner had the Moon forsook the azure Firmament, and had committed her Charge to the gol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>den burnish'd Sun; but St. <hi>Patrick</hi> approached the sight of the Giant, mounted upon his Irish Hobby, clad in a Corsser of Proof, beautified with silver Nails; his Plume of feathers of the co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lour of Uirgin's Hair; his Horse covered with a Uail of Orange<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tawny-silk, and his saddle bound about with Plates of Steel, like an Iron Chair. The sight of this valiant Champion so dounted the Courage of the Giant, that he thought him to be the Knight that the Uision had revealed, and by whom the Ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venture should be accomplished; therefore with no cowardly For<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>titued he assassed the Irish Knight, who with as princely Ua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lour indured the encounter; but the unkind Destinies not intend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to give him the honour of the Uictory, compelled the Cham<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pion to yield to the Giant's force, and like a Captive to accom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pany the other imprisoned Champions. The next Lot fell to St. <hi>David</hi> of <hi>Wales,</hi> who nothing discouraged at the other Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stian Knights, but at the morning Sun's uprise into the azure Firmament glistered in his silver Armour before the Fountain, with a golden Griffon shining on his Breast, where he endured a long and dangerous Combat with the Giant, making the Skies refound with ecchoes of their Stroaks; but at last when the Giant perceived that St. <hi>David</hi> began to grow almost breath<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>less, in defending the huge and mighty Blows of his st√©eled Bat,

But when the valiant Champion St. <hi>George</hi> was alighted from his Horse, and sufficiently beheld the deformed proportion of the Giant, how the Hair of his Head stood staring upright like the bristles of a wild wore, his Eyes gazing open like two blazing Comets, his Teeth long and sharp like to Spikes of Steel, the Nails of his Hands like the Tal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lants

The Temple where in it was erected, stood seven Degrees of Stairs down within the Ground, the Gates where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of were of vurnisht Gold, and the Portals of refined Silver, cut as did seem out of a most excellent beautified Alabasset Rock: But in it continually burned a sweet smelling Taper, always maintained by twelve of the noblest Uirgins dwelling in <hi>Judea</hi> at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tending still upon the Sepulchre, clad in silken Druaments, in colour like to Lillies in the flourishing pride of Summet; the which costly Attire they continually more as an evident sign of their pure and unspotted Uirginities: Many days offered up these worthy Champions their ceremonious Devotions to that sacred Tomb, washing the Marble Pavements with their true and unfained Tears, and witnessing their true and hearty Zeal, with their continual Ualleys of discharged Sighs. But at last upon an evening, when <hi>Titan</hi>'s golden Beams begin to descend the western Element, as those princely minded Champions, in

                        <p>Whereupon they concluded, and so generally entered the Giant's House, which was in the same manner of a great Barn cut out of hard Stone, and wrought out of a Rock: therein they found a very large Copper Cauldron standing upon a Trevet of Steel, the feet and supporters thereof were as big as great Iron Pillers, under the same burned such a huge flaming Fire, that it spark<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led like the fiery Furnace in burning <hi>Acheron.</hi>

                        <p>This <hi>Leoger,</hi> I say, was so intangled with the Beauty of my Daughters, that he desired me to give him one of them in Mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riage; when I little mistrusting the Treason and Cruelty that after followed, but rather considering the great Honour that might redound thereof, for that he was a worthy Knight, as I thought, and of much fortitude, I quickly fulfilled his Desire, and granted to him my eldest Daughter in Marriage, where after <hi>Hymen</hi>'s holy Rites were solemnized in great Pomp and State, she was conducted in company of her new wedded Lord to the black Castle, more like a Princess in State, than a Shepherd's Daughter of such low Degree.</p>

                        </p>
                        <p>
                           <hi>Then the piece which remained in the Wild-man's keeping, turned into a hard Stone, and the piece which remained in the power of the Knight, converted into red Blood, and so they vanished away. Then straight after this, there appeared before mine eyes the Image of my murthered Daughter, in the self same manner and form as you behold her portrayed, who with a naked Body all besmared in Blood, report<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed unto me the true Discourse of her unhappy Fortunes, and told me what place, and where her Body lay in the Woods, dishonoured for want of Burial: also desiring me not of myself to Attempt the Revenge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, for it was unpossible, but to intomb her Corpse by her Mother, and cause the picture of her Body to be most lively portrayed and wrought of fine Crystal, in the same manner that I found it in the Woods, and after erect it near unto a common Passage, where Adventurous Knights do usually Travel. And assuring me that thither would come some certain Christian Champions that should revenge this Injury and inhumain Murther. Which words being finished, me thought she va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nished away with a grievous and heavy Groan, leaving behind her cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain drops of Blood sprinkled upon the Grass: Whereat with great perplexity and Sorrow, I awaked out of my Dream, bearing it in my grieved Mind, not telling it to one, not so much as to the vast Air, but with all expedition performed her bleeding Souls request. Where ever since, most courteous and noble Knights, I have here lamented her un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>timely Death, and my unhappy Fortune, spending the time in writing her doleful Tragedy in Blood-red Lines, the which I see with great grief you have read in this Book of Gold. Therefore most curious Knights, if ever Honour encouraged you to fight in noble Adventures, I now most earnestly intreat you with your Magnanimous Fortitudes to assist me to take Revengement, for that great cruelty that hath been used against my unfortunate Daughter.</hi>

O you Clouds! why do you not cast some fiery Thunder-bolt down upon my Head? or why doth not the Earth gape and swallow my infamous Body? oh false and deceived Lord, I would thy loving and amorous Words had never been spoken! nor thy quick-sighted Eyes ever gazed upon my Beauty, then had I flourisht still with Glory and Renown, and lived a happy Virgin of chaste</hi> Diana<hi>'s Train.</hi>

Therefore without making any Excuse, I here surrender up my Body into your Powers, that you may (as an evil Queen) sacrifice me unto our Gods, for now my Lords you shall understand, that I am dishonoured by the Knight of the Black Castle, he hath planted a Vine within my fruitful Garden, and also sown a Seed within my ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cursed Womb, that hath made</hi> Armenia <hi>Infamous; he it is that hath committed hourly Evils in the World, he it is that delights in Virgins Spoyls, and he it is that hath bereaved me of my Honour, but with my Consent I must needs confess, and left me for a Testimony of this my evil Deed, big with Child, by which my Virgin's Glory is con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verted to a monstrous Scandal:</hi> and with this she made an end of her lamentable Speech, and being grievously oppressed with the pain of her burthenous Womb, she fat her down upon her rich Bed, and attended their Wills.</p>

                        <p>Likewise she told me, that many times in my Infancy, when she wanted Milk in her Breasts to nourish me, there would come a Lyoness, and sometimes a she-Beat, and gently give me suck, and contrary to the Nature of wild Beasts, they would many times sport with me, whereby she conjectured that the immortal Powers had preserved me for some strange For<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tune: Likewise at my Birth Nature had pictured upon my Breast directly betwixt my two Paps the lively form of a pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple Rose, which as yet doth beautifie my Bosom with a Uermi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lion colour, and this was the cause that my Mother named me <hi>Rosana,</hi> answerable to my Natures Mark.

So the Necromancer fell to his Magick Spells and Charms, by which the Christian Champi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons were mightily troubled and molested, and brought in dan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger of their Lives, by afearful and strange manner, as shall be hereafter shown: For as they stood after their long Encounters, unbuckling their Armours to take the fresh Ayr, and their bloo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy Wounds received in their last conflict: the Magirian caused by his Art a Spirit in the likeness of a Lady of a marvellous and fair Beauty, to look through an Iron Grate, who seemed to lean her fair Face upon her white Hand very pensively, and distilled from her crystal Eyes great abundance of Tears. When the Cham<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pions saw this beautiful Creature, they remained in great Ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miration, thinking with themselves that by some hard Misfor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tune she was imprisoned in those Iron Grates: at which this Lady did seem to open her fair and crystaline Eyes looking earnestly upon St. <hi>George,</hi> and giving a grsevous and sorrow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful Sigh, she withdrew herself from the Grate; which sudden departure caused the Christian Knights so have a great desire to know who it should be, suspecting that by the force of some En<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chantment, they should be overthrown: but casting up their Eyes again to see if they could see her, they could not, but they saw in the very same place, a Woman of a great and prince<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly Stature, who was all armed in silver Plates, with a Sword girded at her Waste, sheathed in a golden Scabberd, and had hang<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing at her Neck an ivory Bow and a gilt Quiver: this Lady was of so great Beauty, that she s√©emed almost to exc√©ed the other, but in the same sort as the other did, upon a sudden she vanish<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed away, leaving the Champions no less troubled in their thought than before they were. The Christian Knights had not long time bewailed the absence of the two Ladies, but that without seeing any body, they were stricken with such furious blows up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on their Backs, that they were constrained to stoop with one Knee upon the ground; yet with a trice they rose again, and looking then to see who they were that struck them, they percei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved

But when the furious beast saw that there was a prey whereon she might employ her sharp teeth, she struck with her invenomous Wings and with her piercing Claws she griped, and laid fast hold upon St. <hi>George</hi>'s hard shield, pretending to have swallowed whole this couragious Warriour, and fastning her sharp Tusks upon his Helmet, which she found so hard that she let go her hold, and furiously pulled at his Tar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>get with such a strength that she drew it from his Arm; With that the English Knight struck at her head a mighty and strong blow with his Sword, but in no wise it could hurt her by rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son of the hard Scales wherewith it was Covered, and though he gave her no Wound, yet for all that she felt the blow in such sort, that it made her to recoyl to the ground, and to fall upon her long and hideous Tail: then this valliant Knight made great hast to redouble his force to strike her another blow, but all was in vain, for that upon a sudden she stretched her self so high, that he could not reach her head: but yet kind Fortune so fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>voured his hand, that he struck her upon the Belly, whereas she had no Defence with Scales, nor any other thing but Fea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers, whereout Issued such abundance of black Blood, that it sprinkled all the Den about.</p>

Here Saint <hi>George</hi> having a great confidence in his strength, performed such a valiant Exploit, that all former Adventures that have been ever done by any Knight, may be put in oblivion, and this kept in perpertual memory: for that he threw his Sword out of his hand, and can unto the Serpent, and caught her betwixt his Arms, and did so squeeze her, that the furious Beast could not help her self with her sharp Claws, but only with her wings she beat him on every side.

                        <p>But no sooner approached he unto that enchamed bed, and set him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>self down upon the one end thereof, and thinking to begin his dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>course, but he presently fell into a heavy and dead slumber.</p>

                        <p>Whereupon by his devilish Arts he caused Lamps to burn continually before the entry of the Cave, the properties whereof were so strange, that so long as the Lamps continued burning, the Cham<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pions should never be waked, and the fires should never be quench<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed but by the water of an enchanted Fountain, the which he like<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wise by Magick Art had erected in the middle of the Court guarded most strongly with Sprights: and the water should never be ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tained but by a Uirgin which at her birth should have the form of a Rose lively pictured upon her breast.</p>
                        <p>These things being performed by the secrets of the Magicians skill, added such a pleasure to <hi>Leogers</hi> heart, that he thought him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>self elevated higher than the Towers of his dwelling; for he accoun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted no joy so pleasing unto his Soul, as to see his mortal Enemies captivated in his power, and that the Magician had done by his Art, than all the Knights in Asia could perform by Prowess.

                        <p>This Monster directed his way towards certain Rocks of Stone which stood in the Island, and by reason of the stragling and great noise that the Horses made, he cast his Head a<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="2 letters">

                        <p>These valiant Knights never dismay'd at the sight of this deform<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed Creature, but against his coming, they chear'd up their Horses, and pricked their sides with their golden Spurs, giving a great shout, as in sign of encouragement, and withal drawing forth their sharp cutting Swords, they stood attending the fury of the Monster, who came roaring like a Bull, and discharged his knotty Tree a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mongst the magnanimous Knights, who with light leaps cleared themseves from his violent Blows, so that his Club fell down to the ground with a terrible fall: as though with the violence it would have overthrown a Castle.</p>

Walls they found seven portly Steeds, feeding within a green Pasture, and by them an ancient man, bearing in his face the true picture of Sorrow, and carving in the Barks of Trees the true sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject of all his passed grief: this man was the old Shepherd which the seven Champions of Christendom (before their inchanted sleeps in the Castle) left without the Gates to over-see their Horses, as you heard before in the last Chapter.</p>
                        <p>But S. <hi>George</hi>'s Sons (after they had a while beheld the manner of the Shepherds silent lamentations) demanded the cause of his grief, and wherefore he remained so near the danger of the Castle? to whose demands, the courteous old man answered in this manner.</p>
                        <p>Brave Knights (said he) for you seem to be no less by your Princely demeanors, within this Castle remaineth a Bloody Ty<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rant, &amp; a wicked Homicide called <hi>Leoger,</hi> whose Tyranny &amp; Lust hath not only ravished, but murthered two of my Daughters, with whom I was honoured in my young years, in whole revenge there came with me seven Christian Knights of seven several Countreys, that entered his accursed Castle about seven days since, appointing me to stay without the Gates, and to have a vigilant care of their Hor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ses till I heard either news of the Tyrants confusion, or their over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>throws: but never since by any means could I learn whether good or bad were befallen them.</p>
                        <p>These words struck such a terror to their hearts, that for a time they stood speechless, imagining that those seven Knights were the seven Champions of Christendom, in whose pursuits they have travelled so many Countrys. But at last, when S. <hi>George</hi>'s Sons had recovered their former speeches, one of them (though not inten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding to reveal what they imagined) said to the old Shepherd: that likewise they came to be revenged upon that accursed Knight, for the spoil of a beauteous and worthy Uirgin Queen, done by the same lust-inflamed Tyrant.</p>
                        <p>Then the Lady and the three Knights alighted from their Hor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ses, and likewise committed them to the keeping of the old Shep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>herd: who courteously received them, and earnestly prayed for their prosperous proceedings. So the three Knights buckled close their Armours, laced on their Helmets, and put their Shields up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on their Arms, and in company of <hi>Rosana</hi> they went to the Castle Gate, the which glistered against the Sun like burnisht Gold: whereat hung a mighty Copper Ring, wherewith they beat so vehe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mently against the Gate, that it seemed to rattle like a violent tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pestuous storm of Thunder in the Element.</p>
                        <p>Then presently there appeared (looking out of a Marble-pillar'd
<pb facs="tcp:29556:125" rendition="simple:additions"/>
window) the Magician, newly risen from his Bed, in a wrought shirt with black Silk, and covered with a Night-gown of Damask Uelver: and seeing the Knights with the Lady standing before the Gate, he thus discourteously greeted them.</p>
                        <p>You Knights of strange Countries (said he) for so doth it appear by your strange demeanours, if you desire to have the Gates opened, and your Bones buried in the Uaults of our Castle, turn back unto the Iasper Pillar behind you, and sound the silver trumpet that hangs upon it, so shall your entry be easie, but your coming forth miracu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lous. And thereupon the Magician left the Window.</p>
                        <p>Whereupon one of the Knights went unto the Iasper Pillar, and with a vehement Breath sounded the Enchanted Trumpet, as Sr. <hi>George</hi> did before; whereat the Gates flew open in like manner: where into (without disturbance) they entered: and coming into the same Court where the Champions had fought with the Giants, they espyed the Enchanted Lamps, which hung burning before the entry of the Cave where the Champions lay upon the Enchanted Bed. Under the Lamps hung a silver Tablet in an Iron Chain, in it was written these words following:</p>

                           <l>The fatal Lamps with their enchanted Lights,</l>

                           <l>A Fountain fram'd by Furies rais'd from Hell,</l>
                           <l>About whose Spring doth fear and terrour dwell.</l>
                        </lg>
                        <lg>
                           <l>No Earthly Water may suffice but this,</l>
                           <l>To quench the Lamps where Art commander is;</l>
                           <l>No Wight alive this Water may procure,</l>
                           <l>But she that is a Virgin chast and pure,</l>

                        <p>These Uerses being perused by the three Knights, and finding them as it were, contrived in the manner of a mystical Oracle, they could not imagine what they should signifie: but <hi>Rosana</hi> being sin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gular well conceited, and of a quick understanding, presently knew that by her the adventures should be finished, and therefore

                        <p>This importunate desire of <hi>Rosana,</hi> caused the three young Knights not to lose any time, but to search in every corner of the Castle, till they had found the place wherein the Fountain was: for as they went towards the North-side of the Court, they espyed another lit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle door standing in the Wall, and when they came to it, they saw that it was made all of very strong Iron, with a Portal of Steel, and in the Key-hole thereof there was a Brazen key, with the which they did open it, whereat presently (unto their wonderful amaze<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments) they heard a very sad and sorrowful voice breath forth these words following:</p>
                        <p>
                           <hi>Let no Man be so fool-hardy, as to enter here, for it is a place of Terrour and Confusion.</hi>
                        </p>
                        <p>Yet for all this they entred in thereat, and would not be daunted with any ceremonious fear, but like Knights of heroical estimation<g ref="char:punc">‚ñ™</g> they went forward: wherein they were no sooner entered, but they saw that it was wonderful dark, and it seemed unto them that it should be a very large Hall, and there they heard very fearful how<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lings, as though there had been a Legion of Hell-hounds, or that <hi>Pluto's</hi> Dog had been Uicegerent of that place. Yet for all this these valiant Knights did not lose any of their accustomed courage, nor would the Lady leave their companies for any danger at all, but they entred in further, and took off their Gauntlers from their left hands, whereon they wore marvellous great and fine Diamonds which were set in Rings, that gave so much light that they might plainly see all things that were in the Hall, the which was very great and wide, and upon the Walls were painted the Figures of many furious Fiends, Devils, with other strange Uisions framed by Magick Art, only to terrifie the Beholders. But looking very circumspectly about them on every side, they espyed the Enchanted Fountain standing directly in the middle of the Hall, towards which they went with their shields braced on their left Arms, and their good Swords charged in their right hands, ready to withstand any dangerous accident whatsoever should happen.</p>
                        <p>But coming to the Fountain, and offering to fill their Hel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mets with water, there appeared before them a strange and ter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rible Griphon, which seemed to be all of slanting fire, who struck all the three Knights one after another in such <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 word">
                              <desc>„Äà‚óä„Äâ</desc>

<pb facs="tcp:29556:126" rendition="simple:additions"/>
were forced to recoyl back a great way: yet notwithstanding with discretion they kept themselves upright, and with a wonderful lightness accompanied with no less anger, they threw their Shields at their backs<g ref="char:punc">‚ñ™</g> and taking their Swords in both their hands, they began most fiercely to assays the Griphon with mortal and strong blaws. Then presently there appeared before them a whole Le<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gion of Devils with flesh hooks in their hands, spitting forth flames of Fire, and breathing from their Nostrils smoaking Sulphur and Brimstone. In this terrible sort tormented they these three variant Knights, whose years although they were but young, yet with great wrath &amp; redoubled force adventured they themselves amongst this Hellish Crew, striking such terrible flows, that in spight of them they came unto the Fountain, and prossered to take of the water: but all in vain, for they were not only put from it by this Devilish company, but the water it self glided from their hands.</p>

                        <p>But during the time of all these dangerous encounters, <hi>Rosana</hi> stood like one berest of sense, through the terrour of the same: but at last remembring her self of the superscription written in the silver Tablet, the which the Knights pecused by the enchanted Lamps; the signification of which was that the quenching of y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> lights should be accomplished by a pure Uirgin that had the lively form of a Rose naturally pictured upon her breast, all the which <hi>Rosana</hi> knew most certainly to be comprehended in her self, therefore whilst they con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinued in their dangerous fight, she took up a Helmet that was pulled from one of the Knights Heads by the furieus force of the Griphon, and ran unto the Fountain, and filled it with water, wherewith she quenched the enchanted Lamps, with as much case as though one had dipped a waxen Torch in a mighty River of water.</p>
                        <p>This was no sooner done and finished, to <hi>Rosana's</hi> chiefest con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tentment, but then the Skies began to war dark, and immediate<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly to be overspread with a black and thick Cloud, and it came with great thundring and Lightnings, and such a terrible noise as tho' the earth would have sunk: and the longer it endured, the more was the fury therefore, in such sort that the Griphon with all that de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>luded generation of Spirits vanished away, and the Knights forsook their encounters, and fell upon their knees. and with great humility they desired in their hearts to be delivered from the fury of
<pb facs="tcp:29556:126" rendition="simple:additions"/>
that exceeding and terrible Tempest. By this sudden alteration of the Heavens the Knight of the Castle knew that the Lamps were extinguished, the Champions redeemed from their enchanted sleeps, the Castle yielded to the pleasure of the three Knights, and his own life to the fury of their Swords, except he preserv'd it by a sudden flight, so presently he departed the Castle, and secretly fled out of the Island unsuspected by any one: of whose after Fortunes, Miseries, and Death, you shall hear more hereafter in the course of the History following.</p>
                        <p>The Necromancer by his art likewise knew that the Castle was yielded unto his Enemies Power, and that his charms and magick Spels nothing prevailed: therefore he caused two airy Spirits in the likeness of two Dragons to carry him swiftly through the Air in an Ebon Chariot.</p>
                        <p>Here we likewise will leave him in his wicked and devillish at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tempts, and damned enterprizes, which shall be discoursed hereafter more at large: because it appertaineth to our History now to speak of the seven renowned Champions of Christendom, that by the quenching of the Lamps, were awakened from their Enchant<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments, wherein they had sain in obscurity for the space of seven days. For when they were risen from their sl√©ep, and had rowzed up their drowsie Spirits, like Men newly recovered from a Trance, being ashamed of that dishonourable enterprize, they long time gazed on each others Face, being not able to express their minds, but by blushing looks, being the silent speakers of their extream sorrows. Yet at last, St. <hi>George</hi> began to express the extremity of his grief in this manner:</p>
                        <p>
                           <hi>What is become of you brave</hi> Europe <hi>Champions (said he,) Where is now your wonted Valours, of late so much renowned through the World? What is become of your surmounted strengths, that hath bruised enchanted Helmets, and quail'd the power of mighty Multitudes? What is become of your terrible blows, that have subdued Mountains, hewed in sunder Diamond Armours, and brought whole Kingdoms under your subjections? Now I see that all is forgotten, and nothing worth, for that we have buried all our Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nours, Dignities, and Fames, in slothful flumbers, upon a silken Bed.</hi>
                        </p>
                        <p>And thereupon he fell upon his kn√©es, and said, <hi>Thou that art the Guider of all our Fortunes, unto th<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

These and such like Speeches pronounced this discontented Cham<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pion, till such time as the Elements cleared, and that golden fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ced <hi>Phoebus</hi> glistered with splendant brightness into the Cave through a secret hole, which seemed in their conceits to dance about the Uail of Heaven, and to rejoice at their happy Deliveries.</p>
                        <p>In this joyful manner returned they up into the Court of the Castle, with their Armours buckled fast unto their Bodies, which had not b√©en unbraced in seven days before, where they met with the three Knights coming to salute them, and to give them the cour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tesies of Knighthood.</p>
                        <p>But when Saint <hi>George</hi> saw his Sons, whom he had not seen in two years before, he was so ravished with joy, that he swounded in their bosoms, being not able to give them his blessing; so great was the pleasure he took in their sights.</p>
                        <p>Here I leave the joyful greeting betwixt the Father and his Sons, to those that know the secret love of Parents to their Children, and what dear affection long absence br√©edeth.</p>
                        <p>For when they had sufficiently opened the integrity of their Souls to each other, and had at large explained how many dangers every Knight and Champion had passed since their departure from <hi>England,</hi> when as they began their first intended Pilgrimage to <hi>Jerusalem,</hi> as you heard in the beginning of this Book, they determi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned to search the Castle, and to find out <hi>Leoger</hi> with his associate the wicked Enchanter, that they might receive due punishments for their committed offences, but they like wily Foxes were fled front the Hunters traps and had left the empty Castle to the spoil of the Christian Champions: but when <hi>Rosana</hi> saw her dismist from her purpose, and that she could not perform her Mothers will against her disloyal Father, she protested by her Mothers name never to close up her chearful eyes with quiet slumbers, nor ever rest her weary Limbs in bed of Town, but travel up and down the circled Earth, till she enjoyed a sight of her disloyal Father, whom as yet her eyes did never see. Therefore she conjured the Champions by the love and honour that Knights do bear unto poor distressed La<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vie, to gran<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

                        <p>The Knights considered with themselves that she was a Lady of a divine Inspiration; born unto some strange Fortune, &amp; one by the hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vens appointed, which had redeemed them from a wonderful misery.</p>
                        <p>Therefore they condescended to her desires, and not only gave hee leave to depart, but furnished her with all things belonging to a Lady of so brave a mind.</p>
                        <p>

First, they found within the Castle an Armour fit for a Woman, the which the Enthanter had caused to be made by magick Art, of such a singular nature, that no weapon could pierce it, and so light in wearing, that it weighed no heavier than a Tygers Skin, it was contrived after the <hi>Amazonian</hi> fashion, plated before with silver plates, like the Scales of a Dolphin, and riveted together with golden Nails: so that when she had it upon her back, she seemed like to <hi>Diana,</hi> hunting in the Forrest of transformed <hi>Acteon.</hi>
                        </p>
                        <p>Likewise they found standing in the Stable at the East side of the Castle, a lusty limbed Steed big of stature, and of a very good hair, for the half parts forwards was of the colour of a Wolf, and the other half was all black, saving that here and there it was spor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted with little white spors: his feet were cloven, so that he needed not at any time to be shod: his neck was somewhat long, having a little head, with great ears hanging down like a hound: his pace was with great Majesty, and he so doubled his neck, that his mouth touched his brest, there came out of his mouth two great tusks like unto an Elephant, and he did exceed all Horses in the World in lightness, and did run with an exceeding good grace. This likewise bestowed they upon the Lady, the which did more con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tent her mind, than any thing that ever her eyes bad seen before that time: Also the ten Christian Knights gave her at her departure ten Diamond Rings, continually to wear upon her Fingers, in per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>petual remembrance of her courtesie.</p>
                        <p>This done without any longer tarryance, but only thanking them for great kindness shewed unto her in distress she leapt into the Sad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dle without the help of stirrup or any other thing, &amp; so rode speedily away from their sights, as a shower of rain driven by a violent Tempest.</p>
                        <p>After her departure, the Champions remembred the old Shep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>herd, whom they had almost forgotten, through the joy that they took in their happy Meetings, he as yet remained without the Castle Gates, carefully keeping their Horses; whom now they caused to come in, and not only gave him the honour due unto his age, but bestowed frankly upon him the state and government of the Castle, with store of Iewels, Pearls, and Treasure, only to be maintained and kept for relief of poor Travellers.</p>
                        <p>This being performed with their general consents, they spent the remnant of the day in banquering and other pleasant conference of their passed adventures: &amp; when the night with her sable Clouds had over-spread the days delightful countenance, they betook them to their rests: the seven Champions in a Chamber that had as

many Windows as there were days in the year, the old Shepherd by himself in a rich furnished Parlor, and St. <hi>George's</hi> three Sons in the greatest Hall in the Castle.</p>

                              <hi>How after the Christian Knights were gone to bed in the Black Castle, Saint</hi> George <hi>was awaked from his sleep in the dead time of the Night, after a most fearful manner, and likewise how he found a Knight lying upon a Tomb that stood over a flaming Fire, with other things of note that hapned upon the same.</hi>

                        </argument>
                        <p>MOst sweet were the sleeps that these Princely minded Cham<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pions took in the Castle all the first part of the night, without molestation either by disquiet dreams or disturbing motions of their minds, till such time as the Queen of Night had run half her weary journey, and had spent the better part of the night: for betwixt twelve and one, being the chiefest time of fear and terrour in the night, such a strange alteration did work in Saint <hi>George's</hi> thought, that he could not enjoy the benefit of sweet sleep, but was forced to Iye broad awake, like one disquieted by some sudden fear; but as he lay with wakeful eyes, thinking upon his passed Fortunes, and numbring the minutes of the night with his cogitations, he heard as it were a cry of Night-Ravens which flew beating their fatal Wings against the Windows of his Lodging, by which he imagined that some direful accident was near at hand: yet being not frighted with this fearful noise, nor daunted with the croking of these Ravens, he lay still silently, not revealing it to any of the other Champions that lay in the six several Beds in the same chamber: but at last being between sleeping and waking, he heard as it were the voice of a sorrowful Knight, that constrained these bitter passions from his tormented soul, &amp; they contained these words following:</p>
                        <p>
                           <hi>O thou invincible Knight of England, thou that art not frighted with this sorrowful dwelling, wherein thou canst see nothing but Torments, rise up I say, from thy sluggish bed, and with thy undaunted courage and strong Arm, break the charm of my Enchantment.</hi>
                        </p>
                        <p>And therewithal he seemed to give a most terrible groan, and so ceased. This unexpected noise caused Saint <hi>George</hi> (without the knowledge of any of the other Champions) to arise from his Bed, and to buckle on his Armour, and to search about the Castle to see
<pb facs="tcp:29556:128" rendition="simple:additions"/>
if he might find the place that harboured the Knight that made such sorrowful lamentations.</p>
                        <p>So going up and down by-corners in the Castle, all the latter part of the night, without finding the adventure of this strange voice or disturbance by any other means, but that he was hindred from his natural and quiet sleep, by the break of day, when the dark night began to withdraw her sable Curtains, and to give <hi>Aurora</hi> liberty to display her purple brightness, he entered into a four square Parlor, hung round about with black cloth, and other mourn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful habiliments, where on the one side of the same he saw a Tomb all covered likewise with black, and upon it there lay a Man with a pale colour, who at certain times, gave most marvellous and grie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vous Sighs, caused by burning flames that proc√©eded from under the Tomb, being such that it seemed that his Body therewith should be converted into Coals: the flame thereof was so stinking, that it made Saint <hi>George</hi> somewhat to retire himself from the place where he did s√©e that most horible and fearful spectacle.</p>
                        <p>He which lay upon the Tomb, casting his eyes aside, espyed Saint <hi>George,</hi> and knowing him to be a humane creature, with an afflicted voice he said, <hi>Who art thou Sir, Knight, that art come into this place of Sorrow, where nothing is heard but clamours of Fear and Ter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rour?</hi>
                        </p>

                           <hi>Nay, tell me (said Saint</hi> George,) <hi>who thou art, that with so much Grief dost demand of me, that which I stand in doubt to reveal to thee.</hi>

And so with this conclusion they took leave one of the other, and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parted away with as great secresie as might possibly be devised.</p>
                        <p>After this, within a few days, the Magitian by his Enchant<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment caused a Chariot to be made, that was drawn by the flying Dragons into the which without being espyed of any one, they put themselves, together with their trusty Waiting-Maid, and in great secresie they departed out of the Kings Pallace, and took their journey towards the Country of <hi>Armenia:</hi> into the which Country in a short time they arrived, and came without any misfortune unto a place where as deep Rivers did continually strike upon a Rock, upon the which stood an old ancient building, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in they intended to inhabit, as a most convenient place for their dwelling, whereas they might without all fear of being found, live peaceably, enjoying each others love.</p>
                        <p>Not far from that place there was a small Uillage, from whence they might have necessary provision for the maintaining of their bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dies. Great joy and pleasure these two Lovers received when they found themselves in such a place whereas they might take their fill of each others loves.</p>
                        <p>The Magician delighted in no other thing but to go a hunting with certain Country Dwellers that inhabited in the next Uillage, lea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving his sweet <hi>Angelica</hi> accompanied with her trusty <hi>Fidelia</hi> in that house, so in this order they lived together four years, spending their days in great pleasure, but in the end, time (who never <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

                        <p>Four years he passed away in great heaviness, filling the Court with Ecchoes of his beloved Daughter, and making the Skies to resound his lamentations: sorrow was his food, salt tears his drink, and grief his chief Companion.</p>
                        <p>But at last, upon a time as he sate in his Chair, lamenting her
<pb facs="tcp:29556:130" rendition="simple:additions"/>
absence with great heaviness, and being over-charged with grief, he chanc'd to fall into a troublesome dream, for after quiet sleep had closed up the closers of his Eyes, he dreamed that he saw his Daugh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter standing upon a Rock by the Sea-side, offering to cast her Body into the Waves before she would return to <hi>Babylon,</hi> and that he be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>held her Lover with an Army of Satyrs and Wild-men ready fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nished with habiliments of War to pull him from his Throne, and to deprive him of his Kingdom.</p>
                        <p>Out of this Uision he presently started from his Chair, as though it had been one frighted with a Legion of S<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

                        <p>None could withdraw him from his Determination, though it was to the prejudice of the whole Land: therefore within twen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty Days he furnished himself with all necessaries, as well of Armour and Martial Furniture, as of Gold and Treasure, and so departed from <hi>Babylon</hi> privately and alone, not suffering any other (though many desired it humbly and very earnestly) to bear him com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pany.</p>
                        <p>But he travelled not as he told his Lords, after any Ceremoni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous Order, but like a Blood Hound searching Country after Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>try, Nation by Nation, and Kingdom by Kingdom, that after a barbarous manner he might be revenged upon his Daughter for her Disobedience; And as he travelled, there was no Cave, Den, Wood, or Wilderness, but he furiously entred, and diligently searched for his <hi>Angelica.</hi>
                        </p>
                        <p>At last, by strauge Fortune he hapned into <hi>Armenia,</hi> near unto the place whereas his Daughter had her residence, where after he had intelligence by the Commons of the Country, that she remained in an old ruinated Building on the top of a Rock near at hand, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out any more delay he travelled unto that place, at such a time as the Magician her Husband was gone about his accustomed Hunt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, where coming to the Gate and finding it lockt, he knockt there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>at so furiously that he made the noise resound all the House over with the redoubling Eccho.</p>
                        <p>When <hi>Angelica</hi> heard one knock, she came unto the Gate, and with all speed she did open it, where when she thought to imbrace him

                        <p>So he followed her till he came to the Chamber where her wait<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing-Maid <hi>Fidelia</hi> was, who likewise presently knew the King: up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on whose wrathful countenance appeared the Image of pale Death, and fearing the harm that might happen unto her Lady, she put her self over her Ladies Body, and gave most terrible, loud and la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mentable shrieks.</p>
                        <p>The King, as one kindled in Wrath, and forgetting the natural love of a Father towards his Child, he laid hands upon his Sword and said: It doth not profit thee <hi>Angelica,</hi> to flie from thy death, for thy desert is such, that thou canst not escape from it: for here mine own arm shall be the killer of my own flesh, and I unnaturally hate that which nature it self commandeth me especially to love.</p>
                        <p>Then <hi>Angelica</hi> with a Countenance more red than Scarlet an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>swered and said: Ah my Lord and Father, will you be now as cruel unto me, as you had wont to be kind and pitiful?

You shall understand, my Lord and Father, that I was overcome and constrained by love, for to love, forgetting all fatherly Love and Duty towards your Majesty: yet for all that, having power to accomplish the same, it was not to your dishonour, in that I live honourably with my Husband: then the King (with a visage fraught with terrible <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

                        <p>Thou virerous Brat, degenerate from Natures kind, thou wicked Traytor to thy generation: what reason hast thou to make this false excuse, when as thou hast committed a Crime that de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>serves more punishment than humane nature can inflict? And in saying these Words, he lift up his Sword, in<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

                        <p>But when the furious King saw her in this sort make her de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fence,
<pb facs="tcp:29556:131" rendition="simple:additions"/>
he pulled her off by the hair of her Head, offering to tram<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple her delicate Body under his feet, thereby to make a way, that he might execute his determined purpose without resistance of any.</p>
                        <p>
                           <hi>Fidelia,</hi> when she saw the King determined to kill his Daughter, like unto a Lioness, she hung about his neck, and said: Thou <hi>Monstrous Murtherer, more cruel than the mad Doggs in Aegypt, why dost thou determine to slaughter the most chast and loyallest Lady in the World, even the within whose lap untamed Lions will come and sleep.</hi>
                        </p>
                        <p>
                           <hi>Thou art thy self (I say) the occasion of all this evil, and thine only is the fault, for that thy self wert so malicious, and so full of mischief, that she d<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

                        </p>
                        <p>These Words and Tears of <hi>Fidelia</hi> did little profit to molifie the Kings heart, who rather like a wild Boar in the Wilderness being compassed about with a company of Dogs, most irefully shook his Limbs, and threw <hi>Fidelia</hi> from him, in such sort, that he had al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>most dasht her Brains against the Chamber Walls, and with dou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble Wrath he did proceed to execute his fury. Yet, for all this Fidelia with terrible shrieks sought to hinder him, till such time as with his cruel hand he thrust his Sword into her Ladies Breast, so that it appeared forth at her back, whereby her Soul was forced to leave her terrestrial habitation, and flie into the wide Air, after those which dyed for true loves sake.</p>
                        <p>Thus this unhappy <hi>Angelica</hi> when she was most at quiet, and content with her mean kind of Life, then Fortune turned her un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>constant Wheel, and cast her from a glorious delight to sudden death.</p>
                        <p>The ireful King, when he beheld his Daughters blood sprinkled about the Chamber, and that by his own Hands it was committed, he repented himself of the Deed, and cursed the Hour where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in the first motion of such a Trime entred into his mind, wish<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the hand that did it, ever after might be same, and the heart that did contrive it, to be plagued with more extremities than was mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>serable <hi>Oedipus,</hi> or to be terrified with her Ghostly Spirit, as was the Macedonian <hi>Alexander</hi> with <hi>Clitus</hi> Shadow, whom he caustelly murthered.</p>
                        <p>In this manner the unfortunate King repented his Daughters bloody Tragedy, with this determination, not to stay till the Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gician returned from his Hunting Exercise, but to <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="2 letters">

Farewel thou liveless Body of my <hi>Angelica,</hi> and may thy blood which I have spilt, crave vengeance of the Fates against my guilty Soul, for my Earthly Body shall indure a miserable punishment.

                           <hi>Fidelia</hi> (after the departure of the King) used such violent fury against her self, both by rending the golden Tranunels of her Hair, and <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

But when <hi>Fidelia</hi> had certified him, how that by the hands of her own Father she was slaughtered, he began like a Frantick Tyrant to rage against black Destiny, and to fill the Air with terrible Exclamations.</p>
                        <p>
                           <hi>Oh cruel Murtherer! (said he,) crept from the Womb of some untamed Tyger: I will be so revenged upon thee, O unnatural King, that all Ages shall wonder at thy misery.</hi>
                        </p>
                        <p>
                           <hi>And likewise thou unhappy Virgin shalt endure like punishment, in that thy accursed Tongue hath bruited this fatal Deed unto my Ears, the one for commit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting the Crime, and the other for reporting it.</hi>
                        </p>
                        <p>
                           <hi>For I will cast such deserved vengeance upon your Heads, and place your Bodies in such continual Torments, that you shall lament my Ladies Death, leaving alive the Fame of her with your Lamentations.</hi>
                        </p>
                        <p>And in saying these Words, he drew a Book out of his Bosom, and in reading certain Charms, and Enchantments, that were there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in contained, he made a great and very black Cloud appear in the

skies, which was brought by terrible and hasty winds, in the which he took them up both, and brought them into the Enchanted Castle, where ever since they have remained in this Tomb cruelly torment<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed with unquenchable Fire, and must for ever continue in the same extremity, except some courteous Knight will vouchsafe to give but three blows upon the Tomb, and break the Enchantment.</p>
                        <p>Thus have you heard you magnanimous Knight, the true dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>course of my unhappy Fortunes. And the Uirgin which for the true love she bore unto her Lady, was committed to this torment as my self, and this pale Body lying upon the Tomb, is the unhap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>py <hi>Babylonian</hi> King which unnaturally murthered his own Daugh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter: and the Magician which committed all these villanies, is that accursed wretch which by his Charms and Devillish Enchantments hath so strongly withstood your Encounters.</p>
                        <p>These Words were no sooner finished, but Saint <hi>George</hi> drew out his sharp cutting Sword, and gave three blows upon the Enchanted Tomb, whereat presently appeared the <hi>Babylonian</hi> King standing be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore him, attyred in rich Robes, with an Imperial Diadem upon his Head, and that Lady standing by him, with a countenance more beautiful than the Damask Rose.</p>
                        <p>When Saint <hi>George</hi> beheld them, he was not able to speak for joy, nor to utter his mind, so exceeding was the pleasure, that he took in their sights, so without any long circumstance he took them betwixt both his hands, and led them into the Chamber, whereas he found the other Knights newly risen from their Beds. To whom he revealed the true discourse of the passed Adventure, and by what means he redeemed the King and Lady from their Enchant<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments; which to them was as great joy as before it was to Saint <hi>George.</hi>

                        <p>YOu do well remember when that the Christian Champions had slain the seven Giants in the Enchanted Castle, and had made conquest thereof, disloyal <hi>Leoger,</hi> being Lord of the same, secretly fled, not for anger of the loss, but for the preservation of his life. So in grief and terrour of Conscience he wandred like a fugitive up and down the World; sometimes remembring of his passed prosperity, other times thinking upon the Rapes he had commit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted, how disloyally in former times he had left the Queen of <hi>Armenia</hi> big with Child, bearing in her Womb the stain of honour, and the confusian of her reputation. Sometimes his guilty Mind im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>agined that the bleeding Ghosts of the two Sisters (whom he both ravished and murthered) followed him up and down, haunting his ghost with fearful Exclamations, and filling each corner of the earth with clamours of Revengement.</p>
                        <p>Such fear and terror raged in his Soul, that he thought all places where he travelled, were filled with multitudes of Knights, and that the strength of Countries pursued him to heap vengeance upon his guilty head for those wronged Ladies.</p>
                        <p>Whereby he cursed the hour of his Birth, and blamed the cause of his creation, wishing the Fates to consume his Body with a Fire, or that the Earth would gape and swallow him.</p>
                        <p>In this manner he travelled up and down, filling all places with Ecchoes of his Sorrow and Grief, which brought him into such a perplexity, that many times he would have slain himself, and have <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

                        <p>But it hapned that one morning very early, by the first light of <hi>Titans</hi> golden Torch, he entred into a narrow and straight Path which conducted him into a very thick and solitary a Forrest, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in with much sorrow he travelled till such time as glistring <hi>Phoebus</hi> had passed the half part of his journey.</p>
                        <p>And being weary with the long way and the great weight of his Armour, he was forced to take some rest and case under certain fresh a green Myrtle Trees; whese large leaves did shadow a very fair

and clear Fountain, whose stream made a bubling murmur on the Pibbles.</p>
                        <p>Being set, he began anew to have in remembrance his former committed Cruelty, and complaining of Fortune, he thus publish<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed his great grief: and although he was weary of complaining, yet seeing himself without all remedy, he resolved like unto the Swan to sing a while before his death: and so thinking to give some ease unto his tormented Heart, he warbled forth these Uerses following.</p>

Lady, whom you remember likewise departed from the Black Castle (clad with Enchanted Armour) in the pursuit of her disloyal Father whom she never in her life beheld. This courteous Lady (to perform her Mothers Will) travelled up and down strange Countries with many a weary step, yet never could she meet with her unkind Father, unto whom she was commanded to give her Mothers Letter, neither could she here in any place wheresoever she came, where she might go to seek him. In which travel she met with strange Adventures, which with great honour to her Name she finished, yet still she wandred over Hills and Dales, Moun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tains and Ualleys, and through many solitary Woods, till at last she hapned by fortune into the Wilderness whereas this discontent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed Knight lay sleeping upon the green grass, near to which place she likewise reposed her self under the branches of a Chess-nut Tree, desiring to take some rest after her long travel.</p>
                        <p>But upon a sudden being betwixt waking and sleeping, she heard towards her left hand a very dolorous groan, as it were of some sorrowful Knight, which was so terrible, heavy and bitter, that it made her to give an attentive car unto the sound, and to see if she could hear and understand what it should be.</p>
                        <p>So with making the least noise that she could possibly, she arose up, and went toward the place, whereas she might see who it was, and there she beheld a Knight very well armed, lying upon the green grass, under a certain fair and green Myrtle Tree, his Armour was all Russet, and full of bars of black Steel, which shewed to be a very sad, sorrowful, and heavy Enamelling, agreeable to the inward sad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness of his heart.</p>
                        <p>He was somewhat of a big stature of body, and well proportioned, &amp; there seemed by his disposition to be in his heart great grief: where after she had a while stood in secret, beholding his sorrowful counte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nance in a woful manner, he tumbled his restless body upon the green grass, &amp; with a sad and heavy look he breathed forth this lamentation.</p>
                        <p>Oh heavy and perverse Fortune (said he) why dost thou consent that I so vile and cruel a wretch do breath so long upon the Earth, upon whose wicked head the Golden Sun disdains to shine, and the glittering Elements deny their chearful lights.</p>
                        <p>Oh that some ravenous Harpy would welter from his Den, and make his loathsome bowels my fatal Tomb, or that my eyes were sightless, like the miserable King of <hi>Thebes,</hi> that I never might again behold this Earth, whereon I have long lived and committed so many cruelties.</p>

that Maiden Queen of <hi>Armenia,</hi> in the spoil of whose Uirginity I made a triumphant Conquest.</p>
                        <p>O <hi>Leoger, Leoger,</hi> What fury did induce thee to commit so great sin, leaving her stained with thy Lust, and dishonoured by thy dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>loyalty? O cruel, and without Faith, thou wert nursed with some unkindly milk of Tygers, and born into the World for thine own torment. Where was thine Understanding when thou forsookest that gracious Princess, who not only yielded to thee her Liberty, Love, and Honour, but therewith a Kingdom and a golden Diadom? and therefore woe unto me Traytor, and more woes fall upon my soul than there be hairs upon my head, and may the sorrows of old <hi>Priam</hi> be my last punishment.</p>
                        <p>What doth it profit me to fill the Air with Lamentations, when that the Crime is already past, without all remedy or hope of comfort? this being said, he gave a grievous and terrible sigh, and so held his peace.</p>
                        <p>
                           <hi>Rosana</hi> by those heavy and sorrowful Lamentations, together with his Reasons which she heard, knew him to be her disloyal Father, whom she had so long travelled after to find out: but when she re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>membred how that his unfaithfulness and unkindness was the death of her Mother, her heart endured such extream pain and sorrow, that she was constrained (without any feeling) to fall down to the ground.</p>
                        <p>But yet her couragious heart could not remain long in that pas<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sion, but straightways she rose up again upon her feet, with a de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sire to perform her Mothers Will, but yet not intending to dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cover her Name, nor to reveal unto him that she was his Daugh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter. So with this thought and determination, she went unto the place where <hi>Leoger</hi> was, who when he heard the noise of her coming, straight ways started upon his feet.</p>
                        <p>Then <hi>Rosana</hi> did salute him with a voice somewhat heavy, and <hi>Leoger</hi> did return his salutations with no less shew of grace.</p>
                        <p>Then the <hi>Amazonian</hi> Lady took forth the Letter from her naked Breast, where so long time she had kept it, and she delivered it into his hands, and said:</p>
                        <p>Is it that thou art that forgetul and disloyal Knight, which left the unfortunate Queen of <hi>Armenia</hi> (with so great pain and sor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>row) big with child among those unmeriful Tyrants her Country Men, which banished her out of her Country in revenge of thy committed Crime, where ever since she hath been companion with Wild Beasts, that in their natures have lamented her Banish<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment.</p>

                           <hi>Leoger,</hi> when he heard her say these Words, began to behold her, and although his eyes were all to be blubbred and weary of waeping, yet he most earnestly gazed in her face, and answered her in this manner:</p>
                        <p>I will not deny to thee gentle <hi>Amazonian</hi> (said he) that which the very clouds do blush at, and the low earth doth mourn for. Thou shalt understand that I am the same Knight whom thou hast demand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed after, tell me therefore what is thy Will.</p>
                        <p>My Will is, said she, thou most ungrateful Knight, that thou read here this Letter, the last Work of the white hand of the unhap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>py <hi>Armenian</hi> Queen.</p>
                        <p>At which Words the Knight was so troubled in thought, and grieved in mind, that it was almost the occasion to dissolve his Soul from his Body, and therewithal putting forth his hand somewhat trembling, he took the Letter, and set himself down very sorrow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful upon the green grass, without any power to the contrary, his grief so abounded the bounds of reason.</p>
                        <p>No sooner had he opened the Letter, but he presently knew it to be written by the hands of his wronged Lady, the <hi>Armenian</hi> Queen, and with great alteration both of heart and mind he read the sor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rowful Lines, which contained these Words following:</p>

                        <p>Oh Messenger from her, with the remembrance of whose wrong my heart is wounded, being undeservedly of me evil rewarded: tell me (even by the nature of true love) if thou dost know where she is: shew unto me her abiding place, that I may go thither, and give a discharge of this my great fault by yielding unto Death.</p>
                        <p>Oh cruel and without love (answered <hi>Rosana</hi>) What discharge canst thou give unto her that already (through thy Cruelty) is dead and buryed, only by the occasion of such a forsworn Knight?</p>
                        <p>This penitent and grieved Knight, when he understood the cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainty of her Death, with a sudden and hasty fury he struck himself on the Breast with his fist, and lifting his Eyes unto the Clouds, in manner of Exclamation against the Fates, giving deep and sorrow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful sighs, he threw himself to the ground: tumbling and wallow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing from one side unto the other, without taking any ease, or having any power or strength to declare the inward grief which at that time he felt. but with lamentation, which did torment his heart, he called continually on the <hi>Armenian</hi> Queen, and in that Devilish fury wherein he was, drew out his Dagger, and lifting up the skirt of his shirt of Mail, he thrust it into his Body, and giving himself this unhappy death (with calling upon his wronged Lady) he finish<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed his life, and fell to the ground.</p>
                        <p>This sad and heavy Lady when she beheld him so desperately to gore his Martial Breast, and to fall lifeless to the Earth, she great<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly repented her self, that she had not discovered her Name, and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vealed to him how that she was his unfortunate Daughter, whose face before that time he had never beheld, and as a Lion (though all too late) who seeing before her Eyes a young Lioness evil intreat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed of the Hunter, even so she ran unto her murthered Father, and with great speed pulled off his Helmet from his wounded head, and unbraced his Armour, the which was in colour according to his passi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, but yet as strong as any Diamond, made by Magick Art.</p>
                        <p>Also she took away his Shield which had on it a Russet Flag, and in the midst thereof was pourtrayed the God of Love with two faces. the one was very fair and baund with a cloth about his eyes, and the other was made marvellous fierce and furious.</p>
                        <p>
                           <pb facs="tcp:29556:137" rendition="simple:additions"/>
This being done with a fair linnen cloath she wiped off the blood from his wounded Body.</p>
                        <p>And when she was certain that it was he after whom she had tra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>velled so many steps, and that he was without life, with a furious madness she <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="2 letters">

                        <p>Then she took his Head betwixt her hands, striving to lift it up, and to lay it upon her Lap, but seeing for all this, that there was no moving him, she joyned her face unto his pale and dead Cheeks, and with sorrowful Words she said:</p>
                        <p>Dear Father, open thine eyes and behold me, open them sweet Father, and look upon me thy sorrowful Daughter: If Fortune be so favourable, let me receive some contentment whilst Life remain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth: Oh strengthen thy self to look upon me, wherein such delight may come to me, that we may one accompany the other.</p>
                        <p>Oh my Lord and only Father, seeing that in former times my unfortuate Mothers <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

                           </gap>ears were not sufficient to reclaim thee, make me satisfaction for the great travel which I have taken in seeking thee out.</p>
                        <p>Come now in death and joy in the sight of thy unhappy Daughter, and die not without seeing her: open thine eyes that she may grati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fie thee in dying with thee.</p>
                        <p>This being said, <hi>Rosana</hi> began again to wipe his Body, for that it was again all to be bathed in blood, &amp; with her white hands she felt his eyes and mouth, and all his Face and Head, till such time as she touched his Breast, and put her hand on the mortal Wound, where she held it still, and looked upon him whether he moved or no.</p>
                        <p>But when she felt him without sense or feeling, she began anew to complain, and crying out with most terrible Exclamations, she said:</p>
                        <p>Oh my hapless Father, how many Troubles and great Travels hath thy Daughter passed in seeking thee, watering the Earth with her Tears, and always in vain calling for thee? Oh how many times in naming thy name hath she been answered with an Ercho, which was unto her great dolor and grief? And now that Fortune hath brought her where thou art, to rejoyce her self in thy presence, the same Fortune hath converted her wishes into grief and dolour. O cruel and unconstant Queen of Chance, hath <hi>Rosana</hi> deserved this, to be most afflicted when she expected some joy? O <hi>Leoger,</hi> if ever thou will open thine eyes, now open them, or let the glasses
<pb facs="tcp:29556:137" rendition="simple:additions"/>
of mine be closed eternally.</p>
                        <p>Herewith she perceived his dim eyes to open, and his senses now a little gathered together: and when he saw himself in her Arms, and understood by her Words, that she was his Daughter, whom he had by the unfortunate Queen of <hi>Armenia,</hi> he suddenly strove against Weakness, and at last recovering some strength, he cast his yielding Arms about the milk-white neck of the fair <hi>Rosana,</hi> and they joined their Faces the one with the other, distilling betwixt them many salt and bitter Tears, in such sort that it would have moved the very wild Beasts unto compassion; and then with a feeble and weak voice the wounded Knight said:</p>
                        <p>O my Daughter, unfortunate by my Dissoyalty, let me recreate and comfort my self, in injoying this thy mouth, the time that I shall remain alive, and before my silly Soul doth depart the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pany of my dying Body: I do confess that I have been pittiless unto thy Mother, and unkind to thee, in making thee to travel with great sorrow in seeking me, and now thou hast found me, I must leave thee alone in this sorrowful place with my dead Body pale and wan, yet before my death sweet Girl give me some few gentle kis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ses: this only delight I crave for the little time I have to carry, and afterwards I desire thee to intomb my Body in thy Mothers Grave, though it be far in distance from this unlucky Country.</p>
                        <p>O my dear Lord (answered she) do you request me to give your Body a Sepulchre? I think it more requisite to seek some to give it unto us both: for I know my life cannot continue long, if the angry Fates deprive me of your living company. And without strength to proceed any further in Speeches, she kissed his Face with many sobbings and sighs, and having within her self a terrible conflict, she carryed for the answer of her dying Father, who with pain and great anguish of Death, said:</p>
                        <p>
                           <hi>O my Child, how happy should I be, that thus imbracing one in anothers Arms, we might depart together? then should I be joyful in thy company, and account my self happy in my death: but alas, I must leave thee unto the World. Daughter farewel, good Fortune preserve thee, and for ever may she take thee into her Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vour.</hi> And when he had said these Words, inclining his neck upon the Face of <hi>Rosana,</hi> he dyed.</p>
                        <p>When this sorrowful Lady saw that the Soul had got the victory, and departed from the Body, she kissed his pale lips; and giving deep and dolorous sighs, she began a marvellous and most heavy la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mentation, calling her self unhappy and unfortunate, and laid her self upon the dead Body, cursing her destinies, so that it was lamen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>table to hear.</p>
                        <p>
                           <pb facs="tcp:29556:138" rendition="simple:additions"/>
O my dear Father (said she) what small benefit have I received for all my travel and pain, the which I have suffered in seeking thee and now in the finding of thee, the more is my grief, for that I came to see thee die? O most unhappy that I am, where was my mind when I saw that fatal Dagger pierce thy tender Breast: Whereon was my Thoughts? Wherefore did I stand still, and did not with courage make resistance against that terrible and fatal Blow?</p>
                        <p>If my strength would not have served me, yet at the least I should then have born thee company. You furious Beasts that are hid in your Dens and deep Caves, where are you now? Why do you not come and take pity upon my Grief in taking away my life? doing so you shew your selves pittiful, for that I do abhor this dolorous Life.</p>
                        <p>Yet all this while she did not forget the promise that she made him, which was to give his Body burial in her Mothers Tomb: Which was the occasion that she did somewhat cease her lamentati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, and taking unto her self more courage than her sorrowful grief would consent unto, she put the dead Body under a broad branched Pine-apple Tree, and covered it with leaves and green grass, and withal hung his Armour upon the boughs, in hope, that the sight thereof would cause some adventurous Knight to approach her pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sence, that in kindness would assist her to in tomb him. This done, here we will leave <hi>Rosana</hi> weeping over her Fathers Body, and speak of the Necromancer after his flight from the Black Castle.</p>

                        </argument>
                        <p>I Am sure you do well remember, when the Christian Knights had conquered the Black Castle, which was kept by Enchant<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, how the furious Necromancer to preserve his life, fled from the same, carried by his Art through the Air in an Iron Chariot, drawn by two flying Dragons: in which charmed Chariot, he cros<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed over many parts and plains of the Eastern Climates.</p>
                        <p>At last, being weary of his Iourney, he put himself into the thickest of a Forrest, wherein travelling with his whirling Dra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gons,
<pb facs="tcp:29556:138" rendition="simple:additions"/>
he never rested till he came unto a mighty and broad River, the which seemed to be an arm of the Marble-coloured Ocean: there he alighted from his Chariot for to refresh himself, and took Water with his hands and drunk thereof, and washed his face: and as he found himself all alone, there came into his mind many thoughts of his torepaised site, and how he was vanquished by the Christian Knights, for which with great anger he gave terrible sighs, and began to curse not only the hour of his Birth, but the whole World, and all the generations of Mankind.</p>
                        <p>Likewise he remembred the great sorrow and travel that he ever since had induced, and what to<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

                        <p>The which being seen by the Magician, with a trice he arose up, and intending to prosecute his Journey, but lifting up his eyes towards the Elements, he discovered hanging upon a high and mighty Pine-apple Tree the Armour of <hi>Leoger.</hi>
                        </p>
                        <p>This Armour was hung there by <hi>Rosana,</hi> in the remembrance of his death, as you heard in the last Chapter. And although it had almost lost the wonted colour, and began to rust through the abundance of rain that had fallen thereon, yet for all that it seem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed of a great value and of a wonderful richness, so without any fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther circumspection or regard, he took down the Knights Armour, and armed himself therewith, and when he had lacked no more to put on but the Helmet, he heard a voice that said: <hi>Be not so hardy thou Knight as to undo this Trophie, except thou prepare thy self to win it by the Sword.</hi>
                        </p>
                        <p>The Magician at this unexpected Nosse, cast his Head on the one side, and espyed Rosana newly awaked from a heavy sleep most richly Armed with a strong Enchanted Armour, after the manner of the <hi>Amazonians,</hi> but for all that, he did not let to make an end of arming himself, and having laced on his Burgoner, he went to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards the Demanvet with his Sword ready drawn in his hand, inviting her to a mortal Bartel.</p>
                        <p>
                           <hi>Rosana,</hi> who saw his determination, did provide to defend her self, and offend her Enemy.</p>

O my Muse! that I had but learned Eloquence for to set out and declare the noble Encounters of these two Gallant Warriours: <hi>Rosana</hi> though she was but a Feminine by nature, yet was she as bold in Heroical Adventures as any Knight in the World, except the invincible Christian Champions.</p>
                        <p>But now return we to our History. The valiant <hi>Amazonian</hi> when her Enemy came unto her, she struck him so terrible a blow upon the visour of his Helmet, that with the fury thereof she made sparkles of fire to issue out with great abundanee, and forced him to bow his head unto his Breast.</p>
                        <p>The Magician did return unto her his salutation, and struck her such a blow upon her Helmet, that with the great noise thereof, it made a sound in all the Mountains. And so began between them a marvellous and fearful Battel, Fortune not willing to use her utmost extremity, enclined the foyl to neither party, nor as yet gave the Conquest to any, all the time of the Conflict, the furious Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gician and the valiant <hi>Amazonian</hi> thought on no other thing, but either of them endeavoured to bring the other to an overthrow, stri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king each at other such terrible blows, and with so great fury, that many times it made either of them senseless, and both seeing the great force one of another, were marvellously incenst with anger.</p>
                        <p>Then the valiant Lady threw her Shield at her back, that with more force she might strike and hurt her Enemy, and therewithal gave him so strong a blow upon the Burgonet, that he fell quite a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stonished to the Earth without any feeling.</p>
                        <p>But when the Magician came again to himself, he returned <hi>Rosana</hi> such a terrible blow, that if it had chanced to hit right upon her, it would have cloven her head in pieces, but with great <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

                        <p>Then thus furious Devil (blaspheming against his hard hap) ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving his sharp Sword very fast in his hand, ran towards his enemy, who (without any fear of his Fury) went forth to receive him: and when they met together, they discharged their <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

<pb facs="tcp:29556:139" rendition="simple:additions"/>
which was wrought of the strongest Steel, it was not sufficient to make defence, but with the rigorous force wherewith it was charg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, it bended in such sort that it brake into pieces: and the Magi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cians head was so grievously wounded, that streams of blood ran down his Armour, and he was forced for want of strength to yield to the mercy of the valiant Lady, who quickly condescended to his request, upon this condition, that he would be a means to convey her Fathers dead Body to an Island near adjoyning to the Borders of <hi>Armenia,</hi> and there to Intomb it in her Mothers Grave, as she promised when that his Ayr of life fleeted from his body.</p>
                        <p>The Magician for safeguard of his life, presently agreed to per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>form her Desires, and protested to accomplish whatsoever she de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manded.</p>
                        <p>Then presently by his Art he prepared his Iron Charriot with his flying Dragons in a readiness, wherein he laid the murthered Bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy of Leoger upon a pillow of Mys<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">
                              <desc>‚Ä¢</desc>

                        <p>The Wonders that he performed by the way, be so many and mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>raculous, that I want an Orators Eloquence to describe them, and a Poets skill to express them.</p>
                        <p>But to be short, when <hi>Rosana</hi> was desirous to eat, and that her hunger encreased, by his Charms he would procure Birds (of their own accords) to fall out of the Skies, and yield themselves unto their pleasure, with all things necessary to suffice their wants.</p>
                        <p>Thus <hi>Rosana</hi> with her Fathers dead Body, carryed through the air by Magick Art, over Hills and Dales, Mountains and Ual<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leys, Woods and Forrests, Towns and Cities, and through ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny both wonderful and strange Places and Countries.</p>
                        <p>And at last, they arrived near unto the Confines of <hi>Armenia,</hi> be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the place of their long desired rest. But when they approached near unto the Queen of <hi>Armenia's</hi> Grave, they descended from their Enchanted Chariot, and bore <hi>Leoger's</hi> body to his burying place, the which they found (since <hi>Rosana</hi> departed) overgrown with Moss and withered Brambles: Yet for all that they opened the Sepulchre and laid his Body yet freshly bleeding) upon his La<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dies consumed Carkass: which being done, the Magician cover<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed the Grave again with earth, and laid thereon green Turfs, which made it seem as though it never had been opened.</p>

                           <hi>Oh cruel Destinies (said she) sith your rigours have bereaved me of both my Parents, and left me to the World a comfortless Orphan, receive the Sacri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fice to my Chastity, in payment of your Vengeance, and let my blood here shed upon this Grave, shew the singleness of my heart.

                        <p>This sudden mischance so amazed him, and so grieved his Soul that his Heart (for a time) would not consent that his Tongue should speak one word to express his Passion. But at last (ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving taken truce with Sorrow, and recovering his former Speech,) he took up the dead Body of <hi>Rosana,</hi> bathed all in Blood, and likewise buried her in her Parents Grave: and over the same hung an Epitaph that did declare the occasion of all their Deaths.</p>
                        <p>This being done, to express the sorrows of his heart for the de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sperate Death of such a magnanimous Lady, and the rather to ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>empt himself from the company of all humane creatures, he erected over the Grave, by Magick Art, a very stately Tomb, which was in this order framed: First, there were fixed four Pillars, every one of a very fine Rubie: upon which was placed a Sepulchre of Crystal: within the Sepulchre there seemed to be two fair La<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dies; the one having her breast pierced thorow with a Sword, and the other with a Crown of Gold upon her Head, and so lean of body that she seemed to pine away: and upon the Sepulchre there lay a Knight all along, with his Face looking up to the Heavens, and armed with a Corsset of fine Steell of a russet Enamelling: under the Sepulchre there was spread abroad a great Carpet of Gold and upon it two Pillars of the sam<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

The Sepulchre was compassed about with a Wall of Iron, with four Gates for to enter in thereat: the Gates were after the manner and colour of fine Diamonds: and directly over the top of the chiefest Gate stood a Marble Pillar, whereon hung a Table written with red Letters, the Contents whereof were as follow:</p>

                        <l>The Framer of this stately Monument,</l>

                        <p>This Monument was no sooner framed by the assistance of <hi>Pluto's</hi> Legions, and maintained by their Devillish Powers, but the Necromancer inclosed himself within the Walls, where he consorted chiefly with Furies and walking Spirits, that continually fed upon his blood, and left their damnable seals sticking upon his left side, as a sure token and witness that he had given both his Soul and Bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy to their Governments after the date of his mortal Life was finished.</p>

                           </gap>ucstion of peaceful and Princely entertainment, there was neither sign of peace nor likelihood of joyful and friendly Welcome, for all the Country raged with intestine War, four several Competitors unjust<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly striving for what unto the King properly and of right belonged.</p>
                        <p>The unnatural Causers and stirrers up to this Blood-devouring Controversie, were four Noble men, unto whom the King unad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>visedly committed the Government of his Realm, when he went in the Tragical pursuit of his fair Daughter, after his dreamed il<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lusion that caused him so cruelly to seek her Death. And the breaking our into this hurliburly grew first to head in this manner follow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing:</p>
                        <p>Two years after the Kings departure, these Deputies gover<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned the publick State in great peace, and with prudent Policy, till after no tydings of the King could be heard, notwithstanding so many Messengers as were into every quarter of the World sent to enquire of him: then did Ambition kindle in all their hearts, each striving to wrest into his hand the sole possession of the <hi>Babylonian</hi> Kingdom.</p>
                        <p>To this end, they all made several Friends: for this had they contended in many fights; and now lastly, they intended to set all their hopes upon this main chance of War, intending to fight till three fell, and one remained Uictor over the rest: whose Head should be beautified with a Crown.</p>
                        <p>But to Traytors and Treason the end is sudden and shameful, for no sooner had S. <hi>George</hi> (placing himself between the Battels) in a brief Oration shewed the Adventures of the King, and he him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>self to the People discovered his reverend Face, but they all shouted for joy, and hauling the Usurpers presently to Death, they re-in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stalled him in his antient Dignity, their true, lawful, and long<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lookt for King.</p>
                        <p>The King being thus restored, married <hi>Fidelia</hi> for her faithful<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness: and after the Nuptial Feasts, the Champions (at the ear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nest request of S. <hi>Anthony</hi>) departed towards <hi>Italy:</hi> where in <hi>Rome</hi> the Emperor spared no cost honourably and m√≤st sumptuously to en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tertain those never-daunted Knights, the famous Wonders of Christendom.</p>
                        <p>At that time of the year when the Summers Queen had beauti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fied the Earth with interchangable Ornaments; S. <hi>George</hi> (in company of the Emperor with the rest of the Champions, chanced to walk along by the side of the River <hi>Tybur,</hi> to delight themselves with the pleasant Meads, and beautiful prospect of the Country.</p>

Before they had walked half a mile from the City, they ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proached unto an ancient Nunnery, which was very fair and of a stately Building, and likewise encompassed about with Chrystal streams and many green Meabows, furnished with all manner of beautiful Tr√©es and fragrant Flowers.</p>
                        <p>This Nunnery was consecrated to <hi>Diana</hi> the Queen of Chastity, and none were suffered to live therein, but s<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="2 letters">

                        <p>This vertuous <hi>Lucina</hi> (for so was she called) having intelligence before, by the Dvers√©ers of the Nunnery, how that the Emperor her Father with many other knights, were coming to visit their Religious Havitation, against their approach she attyred her self in a Gown of white Satin, all laid over with gold Lace, having also her golden locks of Hair somewhat laid forth. And upon her head was knit a Garland of sweet smelling Flowers, which made her seem like some Celestial or Divine Creature.</p>
                        <p>Her beauty was so excellent, that it might have quailed the heart of <hi>Cupid,</hi> and her bravery exc√©eded the <hi>Paphi<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

Never could nature with all her cunning, stream more beauty in any one Creature, than was upon her Face: nor never could the flattering Syrens more beguile the Traveller, than did her bright counte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nance enchant the English Champion: for at his first entrance in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to the Nunnery, he was so ravished with her sight, that he was not able to withdraw his eyes from her beauty, but stood gazing upon her rosie coloured Cheeks, like one bewitched with <hi>Medusi's</hi> sha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dows. And to be short, her beauty seemed so Angelical, and the burning flames of love so fired his heart, that he must either en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>joy her company, or give end to his life by some untimely means.</p>

the mornings brightness in at the Chamber Window, but he arose from his restless Bed, and attyred himself in Watchet Uelver, to signifie his true Love, and wandred all alone unto the Monastery, where he revealed his deep affection unto the Lady, who was as far from granting to his Request, as the Skies from the Earth, or the deepest Seas the highest Elements: for she protest<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed while life remained within her Body, never to yield her Love in the way of Marriage to any one, but to remain a pure Uirgin, and of <hi>Diana's</hi> Train.</p>
                        <p>No other resolution could Saint George get of the chaste Nun, which caused him to part in great discontent, intending to seek by some other means to obtain her love, so coming to the rest of the Christian Champions, he revealed to them the truth of all things that had hapned: who in this manner counselled him, that he should provide a multitude of Armed Knights, every one bearing in their hands a Sword ready drawn, and to enter the Monastery at such time as she little mistrusted, and first with Promises and fair and kind Speeches to seek her love, but if she yielded not, to fill her ears with cruel threatnings, protesting that if she will not grant to requite his love with like Affections, he would not leave one Stone of that Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nastery standing upon another, and likewise make her a bloody offer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing up to <hi>Diana.</hi>
                        </p>
                        <p>This Policy liked well Saint <hi>George,</hi> though he intended not to prosecute such Cruelty: so the next morning by break of day he went unto the Nunnery in company of no other but the Christian Cham<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pions, armed in bright Armour, with their glistering Swords rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy drawn, which they carryed under their side Cloaks to prevent su<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>spition.</p>
                        <p>But when they came to the Monastery, and had entered into the Chamber of Lucina (whom they found kneeling upon the bare ground at her Ceremonious Orisons) Saint <hi>George</hi> first proffered her kind<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness by fair Promises, but finding that thereby he nothing prevail<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, he then made known his pretended unmerciful Purpose, and thereupon all of them shaking their bright Swords against her ver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tuous Breast, they protested (though contrary to their intents) that except she would yield to Saint <hi>George</hi> her unconquered Love, they would bathe their Weapons in her dearest Blood.</p>
                        <p>At which Words the distressed Uirgin being overcharged with fear, sunk down presently to the ground, and lay for a time in a dead Agony, but in the end recovering her self, she lifted up her Angelical Face, shrouded under a cloud of pale sorrow, and in this manner declared her mind:</p>

Therefore I request you by honour of true Knighthood, and by the loves you bear to your Native Countries, to grant me the liberty of seven days, that I may at full consider with my heart before I give an answer to your demands, and to the intent that I may make some publick Sacri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fices, as well to appeafe the Wrath which the chast Goddess <hi>Diana</hi> may conceive against me, as to satisfie my own Soul for not ful<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>filling my Uow.</p>
                        <p>These Words were no sooner ended, but the Champions inconti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nently without any more delay joyfully consented, and moreover proffered themselves to be all present at the same sacrifice, and so de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parted from the Monastery with exceeding great comfort.</p>

                        <p>The next morning after six days were finished, no sooner did bright <hi>Phoebus</hi> shew his golden Beams abroad, but the Nuns began to prepare all things in readiness for the Sacrifice: for directly be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore the door of the Monastery they hired cunning Work-men to erect a Scaffold, all very richly covered with Cloth of Gold, and upon the Scaffold (about the middle thereof) was placed a fair Table, covered also with a Carpet of Cloth of Gold, and upon it a Chasing<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dish of Coals burning: all this being set in good order, the Em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peror with the Christian Champions, and many other Roman Knights being present to behold the Ceremonious Sacrifice, little mistrusted the doleful Tragedy that after hapned.</p>

                           <hi>O</hi> Diana, <hi>accursed be this Chance, because thou hast consented to so bloody a Tragedy: for I do here protest, that never more shalt thou be worshipped, but in thy stead every Land and Country where the</hi> English <hi>Champion cometh, shall Lucina be adored. For from henceforth will I seek to diminish thy Name, and blot it from the Godral of the Firmament; yea, and utterly extinguish it for e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver, so that there shall never more memory remain of thee for this thy bloody Tyranny, in suffering so lamentable a Sacrifice.</hi>
                        </p>
                        <p>No sooner had he delivered these Speeches, but incensed with fury, he drew his Sword and parted the Image of <hi>Diana</hi> into two pieces, protesting to ruinate the Monastery within whose Wall's the device of this bloody Sacrifice was concluded.</p>
                        <p>The Sorrow and extream Grief of the Roman Emperour so exceeded for the murther of his Daughter, that he fell to the Earth in a senseless swound, and was carried by certain of his Knights half dead with grief home to his Palace, where he remained speechless by the space of thirty days.</p>
                        <p>The Emperour had a Son as valiant in arms as any born <hi>Italian,</hi> except S. <hi>Anthony.</hi> This young Prince whose Name was <hi>Lucius</hi> seeing his sisters timeless death, and by what means it was commit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted, he presently intended with a Train of an hundred armed Knights which continually attended upon his Person, to assail the discontented Champions, and by force of arms to revenge his Sisters death.</p>
                        <p>This resolution so encouraged the Roman Knights, but espe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cially the Emperors Son, that betwixt these two companies began as terrible a Battel as ever was fought by any Knights; the fierce<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness of their blows so exceeded the one side against the other, that they did resound Ecchoes, which yielded a terrible Noise in the Neighbouring Woods.</p>
                        <p>This Battel did continue betwixt them both sharp and sierce for the space of two hours, by which time the valour of the incensed Champions so prevailed, that most of the Roman Knights were dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>comfited and slain: some had their Heads parted from their shoul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders, some had their Arms and Legs lopped off, and some lay breath<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>less, weltring in their own blood, in which encounter many a <hi>Roman</hi> Lady lost her Husband, many a Widow was bereaved of her Son, and many a Child left Fatherless, to the great sorrow of the whole Country.</p>
                        <p>But when the valiant Poung Prince of <hi>Rome</hi> saw his Knights dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>comfited, and he left alone to withstand so many Noble Champions, he presently set spurs to his Horse, and fled from them like a heap of dust forced by a Whirle-wind.</p>
                        <p>
                           <pb facs="tcp:29556:144" rendition="simple:additions"/>
After whom the Champions would not pursut, accounting it no glory to their Names to triumph in the overthrow of a single Knight but remained still by the Scaffold, where they buryed the sacrificed Uirgin, under a Marble stone close by the Monastery Wall. The which being done to their contentments, S. <hi>George</hi> engraved this Epitaph upon the same Stone with the point of his Dagger, which was in this wise following:</p>
                        <l>Under this Marble Stone interr'd doth lye,</l>
                        <l>Luckless <hi>Lucina,</hi> yet of Beauty bright:</l>
                        <l>Who to maintain her spotless Chastity,</l>
                        <l>Against the assailment of an English Knight,</l>
                        <l>Upon a Blade her tender Breast she cast;</l>
                        <l>A bloody Offering to <hi>Diana</hi> chaste.</l>
                        <p>So, when he had written this Epitaph, the Christian Champions mounted upon their swift-footed Steeds, and bad adue to the unhap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>py confines of <hi>Italy,</hi> hoping to find better Fortunes in other Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tries. In which Travel we will leave them for a time, and speak of the Prince of <hi>Rome:</hi> who after the discomfiture of the Roman Knights, fled in such haste from the furies of the Warlike Cham<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pions. After which, he like a raging Lyon traversed along by the River of <hi>Tybris,</hi> filling all places with his melancholy passions, un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>till such time as he entred into a thick Grove, wherein he purposed to rest his weary Limbs, and lament his misfortunes. After he had in this solitary place unlaced his Helmet, and hurled it scornfully against the ground, the infernal Furies began to visit him, and to sting his Breast with motions of fiery revenge. In the end he cast up his wretched Eyes unto the Skies, and said:</p>
                        <p>
                           <hi>O you fatal Torches of the Elements, why are you not clad in mournful Ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>biliments, to cloak my wandring steps in eternal darkness? Or shall I be made a scorn in</hi> Rome <hi>for my Cowardize? Or shall I return and accompany my Ro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man Friends in death, whose Blood methinks I see sprinkled about the Fields of</hi> Italy? <hi>Methinks I hear their bleeding Souls fill each corner of the Earth with my base flight: therefore will I not live to be termed a fearful Coward, but die couragiously by mine own hands, whereby those accursed Champions shall not obtain the Conquest of my Death, nor triumph in my Fall.</hi>
                        </p>
                        <p>This being said, he drew out his Dagger and clave his heart in sunder. The News of whose desperate Death, after it was bruited to his Fathers ears, he interred his Body with his sister <hi>Lucina's,</hi> and erected over them a stately Chappel, wherein the Nuns and ceremo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nious

Monks during all their lives, sung Dirges for his Chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>drens Souls.</p>
                        <p>After this, the Empero: made Proclamations through all his Dominions, that if any Knight were so hardy as to travel in pursuit after the English Champion, and by force of Arms to being him back, or deliver his head un<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

This charge of the Grecian Emperour (as he commanded) was speedily performed with such diligence, that in a short time it came to the ears of the Christian Knights, as they travelled betwixt the Provinces of <hi>Asia</hi> and <hi>Africa,</hi> who at the time appointed, came in great Pomp and Majesty to <hi>Constantinople,</hi> to furnish forth the honou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rable Triumphs.</p>
                        <p>At the Fame whereof likewise resorted thither a great number of Knights of great valour and strength, among whom was the Prince of <hi>Argier</hi> with a goodly company of Noble Persons, and the Prince of <hi>Fez</hi> with many well proportioned Knights: likewise came thither the King of <hi>Arabia</hi> in great state; and with no less Maiesty came the King of <hi>Sicilia,</hi> and a Brother of his, who were both Gia<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

And as they came to honour the Tri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>umphs, so likewise they came to prove their Foritudes, and to get Fame and Name, and the praise that belongeth to adventurous Knights. It was supposed of all the company that the King of <hi>Sici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lia</hi> would gain by his Prowess the Dignity from the rest, for that he was a Giant of very big Limbs, although his Brother was taken to be the more furious Knight, who determined not to just, for that his Brother should get the honour and praise from all the Knights that came, but it fell out otherwise, as hereafter you shall understand.</p>
                        <p>For when the day of Turnament was come, all the Ladies and Damsels put themselves in places to behold the justing, and attired themselves in the greatest bravery that they could devise, and the great Court swarmed with People that came thither to behold the triumphant Turnament.</p>
                        <p>What shall I say here of the Emperours Daughter, the fair <hi>Alci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>da?</hi> who was of so great beauty that she seemed more like a Divine substance than an earthly Creature, and sate glistering in rich Dr<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>naments amongst the other Ladies, like unto <hi>Phoebus</hi> in the Crystal Firmament, and was noted of all beholders to be the fairest Prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cess that ever mortal eye beheld: so when the Emperour was seated upon his Imperial Throne under a Tent of green Uelver: The Knights began to enter into the Lists: and he that first entred was the Knight of <hi>Arabia,</hi> mounted upon a very fair and well adorned Courser, he was armed with black Armour, all to bespotted with silver knobs, and he brought with him fifty Knights all apparelled with the same Livery, and thus with great Majesty he rode round about the Palace, making great obedience unto all the honourable Ladies and Damsels.</p>

                        <p>Which being done, he beheld the King of <hi>Arabia</hi> tarrying to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive him at the Iust: and the Trumpets began to sound, giving them to understand, that they must prepare themselves ready to the encounter! whereto these two Knights were nothing unwilling, but spurred their Couriers with great fury, and closed together with couregious Ualour.</p>
                        <p>The King of <hi>Arabia,</hi> most strongly made his Encounter, and strook the Pagan without missing upon his breast: but the Pagan at the next Race (being heated with fury) strook him so surely with his Lance, that he heaved him out of his Saddle, and he sell presently to the ground, after which the Pagan Knight rode up and down with great pride and gladness.</p>
                        <p>The <hi>Arabian</hi> King being thus overthrown, there entred into the Lists the King of <hi>Argier,</hi> armed with no other Furniture but with silver Mail, and a Breast-plate of might steel before his Breast; his pomp and pride exceeded all the Knights that were then present, but yet to small purpose his pride and arrogancy served; for at the first Encounter he was overthrown <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

                        <p>But at the same instant there entred the noble minded Prince of <hi>Fez,</hi> being for courage the only pride of his Country, he was a marvellous well-proportioned Knight, and was armed all in white Armour, wrought with excellent knots of Gold, and he brought in his company a hundred Knights, all attyred in white Sat<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

                        <p>At the noise whereof the two Knights spurred their Coursers, and made their Encounters so strong, and with such great fury, that
<pb facs="tcp:29556:146" rendition="simple:additions"/>
the proud Pagan was cast to the Ground, and so departed the Lists with great dishonour.</p>
                        <p>Straight way entred the brave King of <hi>Sicilia;</hi> who was ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med in a glistering Corslet of very fine steel, and was mounted up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on a mighty and strong Courser, and brought in his company two hundred Knights, all apparelled with rich cloth of Gold, having every one a several Instrument of Musick in their hands, sounding thereon a most delightsome Melody.</p>
                        <p>And after the <hi>Sicilian</hi> King had made his accustomed compass, and courtesie in the place, he locked down his Beavor and put him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>self in readiness to just.</p>
                        <p>So when the sign was given by the chief Herald at Arms, they spurred their Horses and made their Encounters so valiantly, that the first Race they made, their Lances shivered in the air, and the pieces therefore scattered abroad like aspen leaves in a whirl-wind.</p>
                        <p>At the second course the young Prince of <hi>Fez</hi> was carryed over his Horse buttocks, and the saddle with him betwixt his Legs, which was a great grief unto the Emperour and all the company that did see him, for that he was well-beloved of them all, and he held for a Knight of great estimation.</p>
                        <p>The <hi>Sicilian</hi> King grew proud at the Prince of <hi>Fezes</hi> overthrow, and was so enraged and furious, that in a small time he left not a Knight remaining on Horse-back in the saddle that durst attempt to Just with him: but every one of what Countrey or Nation soever he unhorsed in the attempt: so that there was no question, among either Nobles or the Multitude, but that unto him the undoubted honour of the Uictory in triumph would be attributed.</p>
                        <p>But being in this arrogant Pride, he heard a great Noise in the manner of a Tumult drawing near, which was the occasion that he stood still, and expecting some strange accident, and looking about what it should be, he beheld St. <hi>George</hi> entring the Lists, as then come from the Gallery, who was armed with his rich and strong armour all of purple, full of Golden stars, and before him rode the Champions of <hi>France, Italy, Spain and Scotland,</hi> all on state<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly Coursers, bearing in their hands four silken streamers of four several Colours; and there followed him the Champion of <hi>Wales</hi> carrying his shield, whereon was portrayed a Golden Lion in a fable Field; and the Champion of <hi>Ireland</hi> likewise carried his spear, being of knotty Ash strongly bound about with plates of steel: all which shewed the highness of his descent, in that so many b<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

                        <p>So when St. <hi>George</hi> had passed by the Royal seat whereon
<pb facs="tcp:29556:147" rendition="simple:additions"/>
the Emperour sate invested, in whose company were many Princes of great power, he rode along by the other side, whereas <hi>Alcida</hi> the Emperours fair Daughter sate amongst many gallant Ladies and fair Damsels; richly apparalled in a Uesture of Gold, to whom he Uailed his Bonner, shewing them the Courtesie of a Knight, and so passed by <hi>Alcida,</hi> who at the sight of this noble Champion could not refrain her self, but with an high and bold voice she said unto the Emperour: <hi>Most mighty Emperour, and my Royal Father, this is the Knight in whose power and strength all Christendom do put their Fortunes, and this is he whom the whole world admires for Chivalry.</hi>
                        </p>
                        <p>Which Words of the lovely Princess, although Saint <hi>George</hi> heard them very well, yet passed he on: as though he had heard no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing. Now when he was come before the Face of his adversary, he took his Shield and his Spear, and prepared himself in readiness to Iust, and so being both provided, the Trumpets began to sound, whereat with great fury these two Warlike Knights met together, and neither of them missed their Blows at their Encounter, but yet by reason that Saint <hi>George</hi> had a desire to extol his Fame, and to make his Name resound through the World, he strook the Giant such a mighty blow upon his Breast, that he presently overthrew him to the ground, and so with great State and Majesty he passed along without any shew of disdain, whereat the People gave so great a Shout, that it resounded like an Eccho in the Air, and in this manner he said: <hi>The great and furious Boaster is overthrown, and his mighty strength hath little availed him.</hi>
                        </p>
                        <p>After this many Princes proved their Adventures against the English Champion, and every Knight that was of any estimation Iusted with him, but with great ease he overcame them all in less than the space of two hours. So at such time as bright <hi>Phoebus</hi> be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gan to make an end of his long Iourney, and the day to draw to an end, there appeared to enter into the Lists the brave and mighty Giant, being Brother to the <hi>Sicilian</hi> King, with a mighty great Spear in his hand, whose glimmering point of steel glistered through all the Court, he brought with him but only one Squire, attyred in silver Mail, bringing in his hand another Lance.</p>
                        <p>So this furious Gyant, without any care or courtesie due unto the Emperour, or any of his Knights there present, en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tered the place, which being done, the Squire that brought the other Spear, went unto the English Champion, and said: <hi>Sir Knight, yonder brave and valiant Giant, my Lord and Master, doth send unto thee this Warlike Spear, and therewithal he willeth thee to defend thy self to</hi>
                           <pb facs="tcp:29556:147" rendition="simple:additions"/>

                        </p>
                        <p>This braving Message caused Saint <hi>George</hi> to smile, and bred in his Breast a new desire of honour, and so returned him this answer: <hi>Friend, go thy ways, and tell the Giant that sent thee, that I do accept his De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mand, although it do grieve my very Soul to hear his arrogant Defiance, to the great disturbance of this Royal Company, in presence of so mighty an Emperour: but seeing his Stomach is gorged with so much pride, tell him that</hi> George of England <hi>is ready to make his defence, and also that shortly he shall repent him by the pledge of my Knighthood.</hi>
                        </p>
                        <p>In saying these Words, he took the Spear from the Squire, and delivered him his Gauntler from his hand to carry to his Master, and so putting himself to the standing, awaiting for the Encounter. At that time he was very nigh the place where the Emperour sate, who heard the Answer which the English Knight made unto the Squire, and was much displeased that the Giant in such sort would defie St. <hi>George</hi> without any occasion.</p>
                        <p>But it was no time as then to speak, but to keep silence, and to mark what event came to his great Pride and Arrogancy.</p>
                        <p>All this time the two Warriours (mounted upon their Steeds) tarryed the sign to be made by the Trumpets, which being given they set forwards their Coursers, with their Spears in their Rests, with so great fury and desire, the one to unhorse the other, that they both fail'd in their Encounter.</p>
                        <p>The Giant who was very strong and proud, when he saw that he had missed his intent, he returned against Saint <hi>George,</hi> carrying his Spear upon his Shoulder, and coming nigh unto him, upon a sudden before he could clear himself, he struck him such a mighty blow upon his Corslet, that his Staff brake in pieces, by reason of the <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="2 letters">

                        <p>But when he saw the great villany that the Giant used against him, his anger increased very much, and so taking his Spear in the same sort, he went towards the Giant and said:</p>
                        <p>
                           <hi>Thou furious and proud Beast, thou scorn of Nature and enemy to true Knight<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hood, thinkest thou for to entrap me treacherously, and to gore me at unawanes, like to a savage Boar? Know as I am a Christian Knight, if my knotty Spear have good success, I will revenge me on thy incivility.</hi>
                        </p>
                        <p>
                           <pb facs="tcp:29556:148" rendition="simple:additions"/>
And in saying this, he struck him so furiously on the breast, that the Spear passed thorow the Giants body, and appeared forth at his back, whereby he fell presently down dead to the ground, and yield<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed his life to the Conquest of the fatal Sisters: all that were present were very much amazed thereat, and wondred greatly at the strength and sorce of St. <hi>George,</hi> accounting him the fortunatest Knight that ever wielded Lance, and the very pattern of true Nobility.</p>
                        <p>At this time the golden Sun had finished his course, having no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing above the Horisen but his glistering Beams, whereby the Iudge of the Turnament commanded with sound of Trumpets, that the Iusts should cease, and make an end for that day.</p>
                        <p>So the Emperour descended from the Imperial Throne into the Tilting place, where all the Knights and Gentlemen were, for to receive the Noble Champion of <hi>England,</hi> and desired him, that he would go with them into his Palace, there to receive all Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nours due unto a Knight of such desert: to the which he could not make any denyal, but most willingly consented: After this the Emperours Daughter (in company of many Courtly Uirgins) likewise descended from her place, where <hi>Alcida</hi> bestowed upon Saint <hi>George</hi> her Glove, the which he wore for her favour many a day after in his Burgoner.</p>
                        <p>The other six Christian Champions, although they merited no ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour by his Turnament, because they did not try their Adventures therein, yet obtained they such good liking among the <hi>Grecian</hi> Ladies, that every one had his Mistress; and in their presence they long time fixed their chief delights: where we must leave the Cham<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pions in the Emperours Court for a time, surfeiting in pleasures, and return to St. <hi>George's</hi> Sons travelling the World to seek out Adventures.</p>

                        </argument>
                        <p>This Renowned Emperour within whose Court the Christian Champions made their abodes) of late years had a Son named <hi>Pollemus,</hi> in all vertues and Knightly demeanours, equal with any living.

This <hi>Dulcippa</hi> (for so was she called) being but Daughter to a Country Gentleman, was restrained from the Emperours Court, and denyed the sight of her beloved <hi>Pollemus,</hi> and he forbidden to set his Affection so low, upon the Displeasure of the Emperour his Father: for he being the Son of so mighty a Potentate, and she, the Daughter of so mean a Gentleman, was thought to be a match unfit and disagreeable to the Laws of the Countrey: and therefore they could not be suffered to manifest their loves as they would, but were constrained by stealth to enjoy each others beloved and much desired company.</p>
                        <p>So upon a time these two Lovers concluded to meet together in a Ualley betwixt two Hills, in distance from the Emperours Court some three miles, whereas they might in secret (devoid of all su<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>spition) unite and fix both their hearts in one knot of true love, and to prevent the determination of their Parents that so unkindly thought to cross them.</p>

                        <p>And in this manner entered she the Ualley, at such time as the Sun began to appear out of his Golden Horison, and to shew himself upon the face of the Earth, glistering with his bright beams upon the sil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver-floating Rivers. Likewise the calmy Western Winds did very sweetly blow upon the green leaves, and made a delicate harmony at such time as the fairest <hi>Dulcippa</hi> (accompanied with high thoughts) approached the place of their appointed meeting.</p>
                        <p>But when she found not Prince <hi>Pollemus</hi> present, she determi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned to spend the time away till he came, in trimming of her golden hair, and decking her delicate Body, and such like delightful plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sures for her contentment and recreation.</p>
                        <p>So sitting down upon a green Bank under the shaddow of a Mir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle Tree, she pulled a golden Cawl from her Head, wherein her hair was wrapped, letting it fall and disperse it self all abroad her back, and taking out from her Cristalline breast an Ivory Comb, she be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gan to comb her hair, her hands and fingers seemed to be of white Alabaster, her Face staining the beauty of Roses and Lillies mixed together, and the rest of her Body comparable to <hi>Hyrens,</hi> upon whose love and beauty <hi>Mahomet</hi> did somewhat do<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

Knight with two Heads, who was a Ravisher of Uirgins, an Op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pressor of Infants, and an utter Enemy to vertuous Ladies and strange travelling Knights.</p>
                        <p>This Tyrant was bodied like unto a man, but covered all over with locks of Hair; He had two Heads, two Mouths, and four Eyes, but all red as blood. Which deformed creature presently ran unto the Uirgin, and caught her up under his Arms, and carried her a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>way over the Mountain into another Country, where he intended to torment her, as you shall hear more at large hereafter.</p>
                        <p>But now return we to Prince <hi>Pollemus,</hi> who at the time appoint<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed likewise prepared to meet his betrothed Love; but removing to the place, he found nothing but a silver Scarf, <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

                        <p>No sooner found he her Scarf, but he was oppressed extreamly with sorrow, fearing <hi>Dulcippa</hi> was murthered by some inhumane means, and had left her Scarf as a Token that she infringed nor her promise, but performed it to the loss of her own life: There<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore taking it up, and putting it next his heart, he breathed forth this woful Lamentation:</p>
                        <p>
                           <hi>Here rest thou near unto my true loving heart, thou precious Token, and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>membrance of my dearest Lady, never to be hence removed till such time as my eyes may either behold her Body, or my ears hear certain News of her untimely Death, that I may in death consort with her.</hi>

                        </p>
                        <p>In which resolution, he returned home to the Emperour his Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers Palace, dissembling his grief in such manner, that none could suspect his discontented Sorrows, nor the strange accident that unto beauteous <hi>Dulcippa</hi> had hapned.</p>
                        <p>And so upon a day as he was meditating with himself, seeing the small comfort that he took in the Court, considering the want of her presence, whom he so much desired, he determined in great secrecy, as soon as it was possible, to depart the Court.</p>
                        <pb facs="tcp:29556:149"/>
                        <pb facs="tcp:29556:150"/>

                           <pb facs="tcp:29556:150" rendition="simple:additions"/>
Which determination he straightways put in practice, and took out of the Emperours Armory very secretly, an exceeding good Cornet, the which was all Russet, and Enamelled with black, and embroidered round about with a gilded edge, very curiously and artificially gra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven and carved.</p>
                        <p>Also he took a Shield of the same making, saving that it was not graven as the Armour was; and commanded a young Gentleman that was Son to an ancient Knight of <hi>Constantinople,</hi> of a good disposition and hardy, that he should keep them safely, and gave him to understand of his determined precence.</p>
                        <p>Although it did grieve the young man very much, yet for all that, seeing the great friendship that he used towards him, in uttering his secrets unto him before any other, without replying to the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary, he very diligently took the Armour and hid it, till he found convenient time to put it into a ship very secretly.</p>
                        <p>So likewise, he put into the same Ship two of the best Horses which the Emperour had; and forthwith he gave the Prince to un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derstand, that all things were then in a readiness, and in good or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der: <hi>Pollemus</hi> dissembling with the accustomed sorrow that he used, withdrew himself into his Chamber, till such time as the dark Night came.</p>
                        <p>Which when it was come, he made himself ready with his ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parel, and when all the People of the Court were at their rest and in their sleep, he alone with his Page, who was named <hi>Mercutio,</hi> departed the Palace, and went to the Sea-side. His Page did call the Marriners of the Ship, who straightway brought unto them their Boat, into the which they entred, and went straight aboard.</p>
                        <p>And being therein, for that the Wind was very fair, he comman<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded to waigh their Anchors, and to hoise up Sails, and to commit themselves to the mercy of the Waters; as he commanded all was done, and so in short time they found themselves ingulphed in the main Ocean, far from the sight of any Land.</p>
                        <p>But when the Emperour his Father understood of his secret de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parture, the Lamentation which he made was very much; and he commanded his Knights to go unto the Sea-side to know if there were any Ship that departed that night? and when it was told them that there was a Barque that haled Anchor, and hoised Sail, they supposed straightway that the Prince was gone away.</p>
                        <p>I cannot here declare the great grief and sorrow which the Em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perour felt in his woful heart for the absence of his Son, which a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>long time he always suspected and feared. But when the departure of <hi>Pollemus</hi> was bruited through all <hi>Constantinople,</hi> all sports and
<pb facs="tcp:29556:151" rendition="simple:additions"/>
Feasts ceased, and all the people of the Country were overcome with a general sorrow.</p>
                        <p>So <hi>Pollemus</hi> sailed through the deep Seas three days and three nights, with a very fair and prosperous forewind.</p>
                        <p>The fourth day in the evening being calm, and no Wind at all, the Mariners went to take there relts, some on the Poop, and some on the fore Ship, for to case their weary Bodyes. The Prince (who sate upon the Poop of the Ship) asked his Page for his Lute, the which straight way was given him: and lung so sweetly, that it seemed to be a most Heavenly melody, and being in this sweet Mu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sick, he heard a very samentable try as it were of a Woman, and leaving his delicate Musick, he gave a listning attentive ear to hearken what this sorrowful creature said, and by reason of the stil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness of the Night, he might easily hear as it were a Woman utter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing these Words:</p>
                        <p>It <hi>will little profit thee, thou cruel Tyrant, this thy bold hardiness, for that I am beloved of so worthy a Knight, as will undoubtedly revenge this tyranous Cruelty proffered me.</hi>
                        </p>
                        <p>Then he heard another Uoice which seemed to answer:</p>
                        <p>
                           <hi>Now I have thee in my power, there is no humane creature of strength able enough to deliver or redeem thee from the torments that (in my determination) I have purposed thou shalt endure.</hi>
                        </p>
                        <p>
                           <hi>Pollemus</hi> could hear no more, by reason that the Back wherein they were, passed by so swiftly; but he supposed that it was his Ladies voice which he heard, and that she was carried by force away. So (laying down his Lute) he began to fall into a great thought, and was very heavy and sorrowful, in that he knew not how to adventure for her Recovery.</p>
                        <p>Being in this cogitation, he returned to his Page which was asleep, and struck him with his foot, and awaked him, saying: <hi>What, didst thou not hear the great Lamentation that my Lady</hi> Dulcippa <hi>made (as to me it seemed) being in a small Barque that is passed by, and gone forwards along the Seas?</hi> To which the Page <hi>Mercutio</hi> answered nothing, for he was still in a sound sleep. To which the Prince called again, saying: <hi>Arise I say, bring forth my Armour, call upon the Marriners that they may launch their Boat into the Sea; for by the omni potent</hi> Iupiter, <hi>I swear that I will not be called the Son of my Father, if I do suffer such violence to be done against my Love, and not procure with all my strength to revenge the same.</hi>
                        </p>
                        <p>
                           <hi>Mercutio</hi> would have replyed unto him, but the furious countenance of the Prince would not give him leave, no, not once to look upon his face: so he brought forth his Armour, and buckled it on.</p>
                        <p>In the mean time the Marriners had lanched their Boat into the
<pb facs="tcp:29556:151" rendition="simple:additions"/>
sea, whereinto he leaped with a hasty fury, and carryed with him his Page and four of the Marriners for to row the Barque, and he commanded them to take their way towards the other company that passed by them.</p>
                        <p>So they laboured all the night, till such time as bright Phoebus with his glistering beams gave unto them such light, that they might dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cover and see the other Barque, although somewhat afar off.</p>
                        <p>So they laboured with great courage till two parts of the day was spent, at which time they saw come after them a Gally which was rowed with eight Dars upon a side, and it made so great speed, that with a trice they were with them, and he saw that there was in her three Knights, in bright Armour, to whom <hi>Pollemus</hi> called with a soud Uoice, saying: <hi>Most courteous Knights, I request you to take me into your Gally that being in her, I may the better accomplish my desire.</hi>
                        </p>
                        <p>The Knights which were in the Gally passed by the Prince with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out making return of any answer, but rather shewed that they made but little account of him.</p>
                        <p>These three Knights were the sons of the English Champion, who departed from their Father in his Iourney towards <hi>Babylon,</hi> to set the King again in his Kingdom.</p>
                        <p>But now to follow our History, the Prince of <hi>Constantinople</hi> see<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the little account they made of him, with the great anger and fury that he received, he took an Oar in one hand, and another in the other hand, and with such strength he struck the Water, that he made the slothful Barque to flie, and laboured so sore at the Oars, that with a trice they were equal with the Bally.</p>
                        <p>So leaving the Oars, with a light leap he put himself into the Gally with his Helm on, and his Shield at his Shoulder, and be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing within, he said: <hi>Now shall you do that by force, which before (I using great courtesie) you would not yield unto.</hi>
                        </p>
                        <p>This being said, one of S. <hi>Georges</hi> Sons took the Encounter in hand, thinking it a blemish to the honour of Knighthood by multi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tudes to assail him; so they two brave Knights without any advan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tage the one of the other, made their Encounters so valiantly, that it was a wonder to all the Beholders.</p>
                        <p>The Prince of <hi>Constantinople</hi> struck the English Knight such a furious blow, that he made him decline his head to his Breast, and forced him to recoil backwards two or three steps, but he came quick<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly again to himself, and returned him so mighty a blow upon his Helmer, that he made all his Teeth to charter in his head, which was pittiful to see.</p>
                        <p>
                           <pb facs="tcp:29556:152" rendition="simple:additions"/>
Then began betwixt them a marvellous and well-fought Bat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tel, that all that beheld them greatly admired: with great Policy and strength they endured the <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="2 letters">

                              <desc>‚Ä¢</desc>
                           </gap>brous night come upon them, they scrove with more courage and strength to finish their Battel.</p>
                        <p>The Prince of <hi>Constantinople,</hi> pussing and blowing like an enra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ged Bull, lift up his Sword with both his hands, and discharged it so strongly upon his Enemy, that perforce he made him to fall to the ground, and therewithal offered to pull his Helmet from his Head. But when the English Knight saw himself in that sort, he threw his Shield from him, and very strongly caught the other a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout the Neck, and held him fast, so that betwixt them began a mighty and terrible Wrestling, tumbling and wallowing up and down the Galley, breaking their Planks and Dars, that it was strange to behold.</p>
                        <p>At this time the Night began to be very dark, wherefore they called for Lights, which presently were brought them by the Mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riners; in the mean time these Knights did somewhat breath them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves, although it was not much. So when the lights were brought they returned to their old combate with new force and strength.</p>
                        <p>
                           <hi>O Heavens, said</hi> Pollemus, <hi>I cannot believe to the contrary, but that this is</hi> Mars <hi>the God of War, that doth contend in a Battel with me, and for the great envy he bears against me, he goeth about to dishonour me:</hi> And with these Words they thickned their Blows with great desperateness.</p>
                        <p>And although this last assault continued more than two hours, yet neither of them did faint, but at the last, they both together lift up their Swords, and charged them together, the one upon the others Helmet, with so great strength, that both of them fell down upon the Hatches without any remembrance.</p>
                        <p>The rest that looked upon them, did verily believe that they were both dead, by reason of the abundance of blood which came forth at their Uisours, but quickly it was perceived that there was some hope of life in them. Then presently there was an agreement made betwixt the Knights of the Gally and Marriners of the Bark, that they should conjoyn together and travel whither Fortune should con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duct them; in this order as you have heard, carried they these two Knights without any remembrance.</p>
                        <p>But when the Prince of <hi>Constantinople</hi> came to himself, with a loud Uoice, he said: <hi>O Love, is it possible to be true, that I am overthrown in this first Encounter and Assault of my Knighthood? Here I curse the day of my Creation, and the hour when first I merited the</hi>
                           <pb facs="tcp:29556:152" rendition="simple:additions"/>
                           <hi>name of Knight; henceforth I'le bury all my honours in disgrace, and spend the remnant of my life in base Cowardize:</hi> and in speaking these Words, he cast his eye aside, and beheld the English Knight as one newly risen from a trance, who likewise breathed forth these discontented speeches: <hi>O unhappy Son of St.</hi> George, <hi>now a Coward and of little Valour, I know not how thou caust name thy self to be the Son of the valiantest Knight in the World, for that thou hast lost thy honour in this last Assault.</hi>
                        </p>
                        <p>This being said, the two weary Knights concluded a peace betwixt them, and revealed each to the other their Names and Living, and therefore they adventured to travel; the which when it was known, they sailed forward that way whereas the dolorous Woman went, so in this sort they travelled all the rest of the Night that remained, till such time as the day began to be clear, and straight way they descryed Land, to which place with great haste they rawed.</p>
                        <p>And coming a Land, they found no used way, but one narrow path, the which they kept: wherein they had not travelled long when they met with a poor simple Country Man, with a new ground Ha<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

                        <p>
                           <hi>This Countrey (said he) is called</hi> Armenia, <hi>but yet most courteous Knight, you must pardon me, for that I do request you to return again, and proceed no further, if you do esteem of your Lives, for in going this way there is nothing to be had but Death.</hi>
                        </p>
                        <p>
                           <hi>For that the Lord of this Countrey is a furious Monster, called the Two-headed Knight, and he is so furious in his Tyranny, that never any stranger could as yet escape out of his hand alive: And for proof of his Cruelty, no longer than yesterday he brought hither a Lady Prisoner, who at her first coming on shoar, he all to bewhipt and beat her in such sort, that it would make the most tyrannous tyrant that is, to relent and pity her distress, swearing that every day he would so torment her, till her life and body did make their separation.</hi>
                        </p>
                        <p>
                           <hi>Pollemus</hi> the Prince of <hi>Constantinople,</hi> was very attentive to the old Mans Words, thinking the Lady to be his <hi>Dulcippa,</hi> after whom he so long travelled; the grief he received at this report, struck such a terrour to his heart, that he fell into a swound, and was not able to go any further, but St. <hi>George's</hi> Sons, who knew him to be a Knight of much valour, encouraged him, and protested by the ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour of their Knight-hoods, never to forsake his company, till they saw his Lady delivered from her torments, and he safely conducted home into his own Countrey.</p>
                        <p>
                           <pb facs="tcp:29556:153" rendition="simple:additions"/>
So travelling with this resolution, the night came on, and it was so dark, that they were constrained to seek some convenient place to take their rests, and laying themselves down under a broad branched Oak Tree, they passed the night, pondering in their minds a thousand imaginations.</p>
                        <p>So when the morning was come, and that the Diamond of Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven began to glister with his beams upon the Mountain tops, these martial Knights were not slothful, but rose up and followed their Iourneys.</p>
                        <p>After this, they had not travelled scarce half a mile, when that they heard a pittiful Lamentation of a Woman, whose voice by reason of her low shrieks, was very hoarse: so they staid to hear from whence that lamentable Noise should come.</p>
                        <p>And presently afar off, they beheld a high Pillar of stone, out of the which there came forth a spout of fair and clear Water, and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>at was bound a Woman all naked, her back fastned to the Pillar, her arms backwards embracing it, with her hands fast bound be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hind her. Her skin was so fair and white, that if it had not been that they heard her lamentation, they would have judged her to have been an Image made artificially of Alabaster, and joyned to the Pillar.</p>
                        <p>These Warlike Knights laced on their Helmets, and came unto the place where she was, but when the Prince of <hi>Constantinople</hi> saw her, he presently knew her to be his Lady and lovely Mist<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ress.</p>
                        <p>For by reason of the coldness of the Night and with her great La<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mentation and Weeping, she was so full of sorrows and affliction, that she could scarce speak. Likewise the Princes heart so yerned at the sight of his unhappy Lady, that almost he could not look up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on her for Weeping.</p>
                        <p>But yet at last, with a sorrowful sigh he said: O cruel hands: is it possible that there should remain in you so much mischief, that whereas there is such great beauty and fairness, you should use such baseness and villany? she doth more deserve to be loved and served, than to be in this sort so evil intreated.</p>
                        <p>This woful Prince with much sorrow did behold her white skin and back all to bespotted with her blood, and taking a Cloak from one of the Marriners, he threw it upon her, and covered her body, and took her in his arms whilst the other Knights unbound her.</p>
                        <p>This unhappy Lady never felt nor knew what was done unto her, till such time as she was loosed from those bands, and in
<pb facs="tcp:29556:153" rendition="simple:additions"/>
the Arms of her Lover. But yet she thought that she had been in the Arms of the Monstrous Two-headed Knight, and therefore she gave a terrible sigh, saying: <hi>Oh</hi> Pollemus, <hi>my true betrothed Husband, where art thou now, that thou comest not to succour me?</hi> and there withal ceased her Speeches.</p>
                        <p>The Prince hearing these Words, would have answered her, but he was disturbed by hearing or a great Noise of a Horse, which seemed to be in the Woods amongst the Trees.</p>
                        <p>The rest of the Knights intending to see what it should be, left the Lady lying upon the green Grass in the keeping of Prince <hi>Polle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mus</hi> and the Marriners, and so St. <hi>George's</hi> Sons went towards the place whereas they heard that rushing Noise, and as they dili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gently lookt about them, they beheld the Two-headed Monster mounted upon a furious and great Palfrey, who returned to see if the Lady were alive, for to torment her anew.</p>
                        <p>But when he came to the Pillar and saw not the Lady, with an ireful look he cast his eyes, looking round about him on every side, and at last he saw the three Knights coming towards him with a slow and quiet pace, and how the Lady was untied from the Pillar where he left her, and in the arms of another Knight, making her sorrowful complaint.</p>
                        <p>The Two-headed Knight seeing them in this order, with great Wrath he came riding upon his furious Horse towards them: and when he was near them, he said: <hi>Fond Knights, what wretched folly and madness hath bewitched you, that without any leave you have adventured to untye the Lady from the Pillar, where I left her, or come you to offer up your Blood in sacrifice upon my Fauchin?</hi> To whom one of the three valiant Bro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers answered, and said: <hi>We be Knights of a strange Country, that at the sorrowful complaint of this Lady arrived at this place, and seeing her to be a fair and beautiful Woman, and without any desert to be thus evil intreated, it moved us to put our persons in adventure against them that will seem farther to misuse her.</hi>
                        </p>
                        <p>In the mean time that the Knight was speaking these Words the ugly deformed Monster beheld him very precisely, knitting his brows with the great anger he had received in hearing his Speeches, and with great fury he spurred his monstrous Beast, that he made him give so mighty a leap, that he had almost fallen on the English Knight: who with great lightness did deliver himself, and so drawing out his Sword, he would have strucken him, but the Beast passed by with so great swiftness that he could not reach him.</p>
                        <p>Here began as terrible a Battel between the Two-headed Knight and Saint <hi>George's</hi> Sons, as ever was fought by any Knights,
<pb facs="tcp:29556:154" rendition="simple:additions"/>
their mighty blows seemed to rattle in the Elements like a terrible thunder, and their Swords to strike sparkling fire in such abundance, as though it had been from a Smiths Anvil.</p>
                        <p>During this Conflict, the English Knights were so grievously wounded, that all their bright Armour was stained with a bloody gore, and their Helmets bruised with the terrible stroaks of the Monsters Fauchion, whereat they grew more inraged, and their strength began to increase in such sort, that one of them struck an overthwart blow with his trusty Sword upon his knee, and by rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son that his Armour was not very good, he cut it clean asunder, so that Leg, and all fell to the ground, and the Two-headed Knight fell on the other-side to the Earth, and with great roaring he began to rage and stare like a Beast, and to blaspheme against the Fates for this his sudden mishap.</p>
                        <p>The other two Brethren seeing this, presently cut off his two heads, whereby he was forced to yielded the mercy of imperious Death.</p>
                        <p>There was another Knight that came with this Monster, who when he saw all that had passed, with great fear returned the way from whence he came.</p>
                        <p>These Uictorious Conquerours, when they saw that with so great ease they were delivered from the Tyrants Cruelty, with joyful hearts they departed with Conquest to the Prince of <hi>Constantinople,</hi> where they left him comforting his distressed Lady.</p>
                        <p>So when they were altogether, they commanded the Marriners to provide them somewhat to eat, for that they had great need there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of, who presently prepared it, for that continually they bore their Provision about them: of this banquet the Knights were very glad, and rejoiced much at that which they had archieved, and commanded that the Lady should be very well looked to, and healed of her harm received.</p>
                        <p>So at the end of three days, when the princely Lady had recover<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed Health, they left the Country of <hi>Armenia,</hi> and departed back to the Seas, whereas they had left their Ships lying at road, that tarried there until their coming.</p>
                        <p>Whereinto they had no sooner entred, but the Marriners hoised sail, and took their way towards <hi>Constantinople,</hi> as the Knights commanded. The Winds served them to prosperously, that within a small time they arrived in <hi>Greece,</hi> and Landed within two days Iourney of the Court, which lay then at <hi>P<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

For, saith he, unless I may with the Emperour my Fathers consent, enjoy my dearest <hi>Dulcippa,</hi> I will live unknown in her company, rather than delight in the Heritage of ten such Empires.</p>
                        <p>At last, they concluded that the Lady should be covered in a black vail for being known, and <hi>Pollemus</hi> in black Arms, and the other Knights, all suitable should ride together: which accordingly they did, and about ten in the morning entred the Pallace: where they sound the Emperour, the seven Champions, with many other Prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces in the great Hall: to whom one of Saint <hi>George's</hi> Sons thus spake:</p>
                        <p>
                           <hi>Great Emperour and Noble Knights, this Knight that leadeth the Lady, hath long loved her: in their Births there is great difference, so that their Parents croft their affections: for him she hath indured much sorrow, and for her he will and hath suffered many hazards.

                        </p>
                        <p>The Emperour condescended, and on the Green before the Pal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lace, those four overthrew more than four hundred Knights: so that Saint <hi>George</hi> and three other of the Champions entred the Lists, and ran three violent Courses against the Black Knights, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out moving them: who never suffered the points of their Spears to touch the Armour of the Champions: which the Emperour per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiving, guessed them to be of acquaintance: wherefore giving judgment, that the Knight should possess his Lady, at his request they discovered themselves.</p>

                        <p>The Ualiant Champion S. <hi>Patrick</hi> feeling himself weakned with Time and Age, not able any longer to endure the bruises of Prince<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly Atchievements, became an Hermite, and wandring up and down the World in poor Habiliments; he came at last to the Country of his Birth, which is now called <hi>Ireland,</hi> but in former times <hi>Hibernia,</hi> where instead of Martial Atchievements, he offered up (in the name of his Redeemer) devout Orisons, daily making petitions to the Dei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty of Glory, in behalf of his desired peace: a life more delightful to his aged Heart, than all his former accomplishments: And now willing to bid farewel to the World, he desired a reclosure to be made, and to be pent up in a stony Wall from the sight of all Earthly O<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

                           </gap>jects. To which request of this Holy Father (now no Souldier but a man of Peace) the Inhabitants wholly condescended, and builded him a four-square House of Stone, without either Window or Door, only a little hole to receive his Food in, wherein they closed him up, never to be seen more alive by the eyes of mortal Men. Also appointing divers of the Country to bring him at conve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nient times Food to maintain Nature, which they delivered in at the aforesaid hole, which they thought to be a deed of more than com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon charity, and he (the receiver) to be an honour to their Country by the severe and strict course of life he put himself to. Thus lived he, the servant of his God day and night, kneeling on the bare ground, till thrice the Winters cold had taken departure, and as oft the Summers warmth had cheared up the cold Earth, making his knees hard with kneeling, and his eyes dim with Lamentations
<pb facs="tcp:29556:156" rendition="simple:additions"/>
for his former offences. In which time the Hairs of his Head were all over-grown and deformed, and the Nails of his Fingers (as it were) seemed like the Talons and Claws of an old Raven, with the which by little and little he digged his own Grave, prepa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red against the hour of his death to be buried in: the which by pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cess of time came thus to effect as followeth.</p>
                        <p>When he had wasted (as I said before) thrice twelve months in Divine Contemplations, by Inspiration (as it seemed) he laid him down in the Grave that his own Nails had digged: and feeling his body weak and feeble, ready to deliver up the ayre of Life, he be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gan to speak as followeth.</p>
                        <p>World (quoth he) thou hast been long my kind Friend, &amp; hast graced my Name with many Titles of Honour, and making me Famous in thy large circumference: thou hast given me Uictories over all mine Enemies, and weakned the boldness of all my withstanders, that my Life and Name might be charactered amongst the rest of our Christian Champions, for which I have thought my self predestinated to a lasting happiness, in that the Title of my Fortunes challenge so long a Memory. World (I say) fare thou well, my life lingereth now to her last minute, which as willingly I here deliver up, as e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver I brandisht Wrapon against powerful Pagan. I need no Pom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pal Train of Princes to attend my Funeral, nor solemn Chimes of Bells to Ring me to my Grave, nor Troops of Mourners in Sable Garments, to furnish out my Obsequy: my self here buries up my self, and all Offices of Lamentations belonging to so bad a business as my own hand Labour. Earth, I imbrace thee: thou gentle Mould, my Bodies covering, with humility I kiss thee: no difference is between thy cold Nature and my Lifes warm sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stance, we are both one, Emperours are but Earth, so am I. Thou Earth, gently do I yield my self into thy mouldy bosom. I come, I come, sweet Comforter, into thy hands I commend my Spirit. These and such like were the last Words that ever this good Cham<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pion delivered, so yielding to death, the Earth of it self as it were buried up his Body in the Grave, which his own hands had digged.</p>
                        <p>Thus being changed from a lively substance to a dead Picture, his Attenders, as their usual custom was, came with Food to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve him, and calling at the hole where he had wont to receive it, they heard nothing but empty ayre blowing in and out, which made them conjecture presently that death had prevailed, and the fatal Si<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sters finished up their labours: so calling together more company, they made an entrance thereinto, and finding what had hapned, how he had buried his own self, they reported it for a wonder up and

                        <p>Whereupon, by a common consent of the whole Kingdom, they pulled down the aforesaid House or Tower, and in the same place, builded in process of time a most sumptuous Chappel, casting it St. <hi>Patricks</hi> Chappel, and in the place where this Holy Father had buri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed himself, they likewise erected a Monument of much richness, framed upon Pillars of pure Gold, beautified with many artificial sights, most pleasant to behold; whereunto for many years after resorted distressed People, such as were commonly molested with loathsom Diseases, where making their Orisons at Saint <hi>Patricks</hi> Tomb, they found help, and were restored to their former Healths.</p>
                        <p>By which means, the Name of Saint <hi>Patrick</hi> is grown so famous through the World, that to this day he is intituled one of our Christi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>an Champions, and the Saint for <hi>Ireland,</hi> where in remembrance of him, and of his honourable atchievments done in his life time, the <hi>Irish-men</hi> as well in <hi>England</hi> as in that Country, do as yet in honour of his Name, keep one day in the year Festival, holding upon the same a great Solemnity, wearing upon their Hats each of them a Cross of red silk, in token of his many Adventures, un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der the Christian Cross, as you have heard in the former History at large discoursed.

as he went the poor and needy such small pieces of Silver as he well could spare; he arrived at last upon the Consines of <hi>Spain:</hi> Where in honour of that God, for whom he had fought so many Battels, he builded up at his own charge a most sumptuous Chappel, to this day bearing the Name of Saint <hi>Jacque's</hi> Chappel: and for the main<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tenance thereof, purchased divers Lands adjoining: with Quiristers to sing a Day and Night therein <hi>Allelujah</hi> to his Redeemer.</p>
                        <p>This Celestial gift and glorious customs so prepared, begot such love of the meaner sort of People, that they esteemed him more than a Man, with a reverence of such regard bestowed upon him, that the very Name of this Noble Champion won greater admirations than the high Tilts of their Countries King, who being then a cruel Tyrant and proud King, maintaining Atheism by his Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernment, grew so envious thereat, that he caused good Saint <hi>Jacques,</hi> with the whole Quire of his Celestial Singers, to be closed up together in the Chappel which the Champion had erected, &amp; so starved them to death. Oh bloody butchery, and inhumane cruel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty! a death of more terrour than ever was heard of. <hi>Nero</hi> in rip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ping up his Mothers Womb to see the Bed of his Creation, was not half so cruel. But to be short, hunger prevailed, and they dead, their Bodies purrified, and in time consumed away to dust and mould, whereupon the Lord to shew how they died in his favour, and the love of Heaven, inflicted such a light in the Chappel, that it shined Day and Night with such a glorious brightness, as if it had been the glorious Palace of the Sun: and likewise continually was heard therein (though no Creature remaining) such a Quire of melodi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous Harmony, as if it had been the sound of Celestial Musick. Which strange pleasures both to the eyes and ear, bred so great an a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mazement to the whole Countrey, that all with the common consent accused their King for the tyrannous putting to death of these good men so cruelly murthered; but especially the noble S. <hi>Jacques,</hi> that they purposed to hold him for their Countrys Saint and Champion till the Worlds dissolution. The proud King perceiving now his own rashness, and his common hate against him for this deed doing, took an inward conceit of grief, that without taking any food ever after, he languished away and died: Thus have you heard the Tragedy of the <hi>Spanish</hi> Champion, whom we likewise commit to the sweet sleeps of Eternity, and pass on further to more dreadful Accidents.</p>

First with great wonder he stood gazing upon the Monuments that were erected in the honour of all their famous Emperours, Councels, Orators, and Conquerours, things which yielded him great Pleasure. The next thing that his eyes delighted in, was the Temple of the twelve <hi>Sibyls,</hi> a most miraculous build<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing: in which Temple were all their Prophecies inroled, as also the beginning and ending of the whole Catalogue of the Heathen Gods, as <hi>Mars, Jupiter, Saturn, Apollo,</hi> and such like; with their manner of Worship.

He likewise decreed by the consent of the whole Kingdom, that the Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tron of the Land should be named Saint <hi>George,</hi> our Christian Champion, in that he had fought so many Battles in the Honour of Christendom.

one of his paws, and with the same grasped so hard on the arm of Sir <hi>Guy,</hi> that he had well near siezed on him, had not Sir <hi>David</hi> at that instant come in, ond with his sword cut the Mon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sters paw quite off, leaving the claws so firmly fixt on Sir <hi>Guy's</hi> Arm, that notwithstanding the goodness of his armour, it was very hard to be gotten off; In the mean time the valiant and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nowned Knight Sir <hi>Alexander,</hi> with great force sot upon the mon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ster, giving him such a blow upon the head as made him to reel, who with his tail striking of Sir <hi>Alexander,</hi> so wrapped the same about his horses legs, that not able to stand he came over and over with the Kniht; The Monster seeing him on the ground, was making towards him, whom Sir <hi>David</hi> met with such a lusty thrust on his breast, that though it pierced not the same, it laid the Monster flat on his back; which was no sooner done, but Sir <hi>Guy</hi> nimblp leaping from off his horse thrust his sword down the Monsters Throat, who lay gasping for breath, whereby he rived his heart in sunder; yet notwithstanding the same, the Monsters Teeth were so k√©en, that he bit the Knights sword in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>two, leaving the one half in his Throat, and withal sent forth such a hideous yell, as surpassed the roaring of the Cataracts of <hi>Nilus,</hi> or the greatest crack of the loudest Thunder; but having received his deaths wound, with some little strugling he yielded his life up to the Uictors, who surveying his Body, found it to be from the head to the end of the tail, full ten yards in length, his bulk at least a Tun weight, having paws and claws answer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able unto it, and each part so armed with scales, as scarcely pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>netrable witd any sword.</p>

                        <p>The Hermit concluding his speech with a deep sigh for a period, the Ualiant Knight Sir <hi>Guy,</hi> with a smiling countenance thus an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>swered him; Now then (said he) are the Stars so benigne unto <hi>Sicily,</hi> that your Country is fr√©ed from this direful misery, for the cause being taken away the effects must needs cease; Know then, that by the victorious Armes of me, and my two Brothers, the Monster is dead; and no more dread of your affrighting dead <hi>Pongo,</hi> then is to be feared from a living Grashopper or Butter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fly. Scarcely had Sir <hi>Guy</hi> ended his speech, when the Hermit transported with an excessive joy fell down at his feet, being al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>most in as great an extasie for joy, as was that Father, who ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving three Sons returned Uictors from the <hi>Olympick</hi> Games; his overjoyed spirit could not contain its self in the bounds of reason, but by the excessiveness thereof yielded up the ghost: And is our Land (said he) capable of so great a benefit, does so good Fortune attend our Country! Then thanks to the immortal powers above, who hath sent you hither to be the means of our future happiness; how is our Nation bound to your Manhood, and what victims shall we offer for your fortunate success? As the Hermit was thus dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>coursing, there was passing by the Cell a Herald at Arms: well accontered, and attended on by four Knights clad all in mourning Armour, who were sent by the King into Forreign Countries, to proclaim in every place where they came, that if any Knight would be so hardy as to encounter with the <hi>Pongo;</hi> and overcome him, he should be made a Peer of the Realm, and have a golden Helmet for a reward. This their errand being made known to the three Knights, they declared unto them how <hi>Pongo</hi> was al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ready

All this while the Princess <hi>Urania</hi> fed her Eyes with beholding of Sir <hi>Guy,</hi> whose perfections she so contemplated, that Love entering in at her Eyes, so wound<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed her heart, as she became wholly captivated in the Bonds of <hi>Cu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pid.</hi> Sir <hi>Guy</hi> on the other side was so pierced with her transcen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dant Beauty, and her other rare accomplishments, that he wholly resigned up himself to her devotion, she being the loadstone of his affections, attracting all the faculties of his Soul in obedience to her commands. Thus did these two Princely persons recipro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cally bear true love to each other, though neither of them knew the others mind; but as fire will not be long hid under combusti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble matter, so Love where it is ardent will show its self through all the disguises they can put upon it.

                        <p>As Sir <hi>Guy</hi> was listening to this Harmonious Uoice, there passed by him one of the Princess <hi>Uranias</hi> Ladies, which put a

That night the Ladies had provided a stately Mask, which at the end of every Scene was attended with most rare Musick, and ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cellent Dancing, to which Mask the three Brothers were invi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted. The time being come for the Mask to begin, it was perform<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed on this manner.</p>
                        <p>First began a most excellent Consort of Musick, then enter'd sour Maskers in Cloth of Gold, most richly Embroidered; three of them personated the three Goddesses, <hi>Juno, Pallas,</hi> and <hi>Venus,</hi> when they strove for the Golden Apple on the Mount of <hi>Ida;</hi> the fourth represented the Shepherd <hi>Paris,</hi> who having heard their se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veral Pleas which they made for the obtaining of the Apple, he adjudged it to <hi>Venus,</hi> and then having danced a Course about the Room, they all withdrew.</p>
                        <p>After a little space the Musick playing again, according as it was appointed; the three Knights took each of them a Lady by the hand to lead them a dance, and now had Sir <hi>Guy</hi> the happiness to converse with his dear Lady and Mistress; for taking the Prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cess <hi>Urania</hi> by the hand, he with great courtesie and humility kissed it, and she kindly accepting his proffer, he led her a Course a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout the Room in as great Majesty and state as did <hi>Aeneas,</hi> when he reveled it in the Court of Queen <hi>Dido,</hi> and she following him with as much grace as might become the Queen of Love to have acted it; and so having shewed to the Spectators that he could as w<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

                           <hi>Most Peerless Princess,</hi> (said Sir <hi>Guy) if the bleeding wounds of my heart could speak, which you have pierced by the beams of your matchless Beauty, then would it save my Tongue the labour to declare the affection which I bear to your Noble Person: If I have aim'd too high, blame your matchless Beauty and Vertues that have caused it; Let me therefore conjure you by all the Rites and</hi>

                        <p>Although this Speech were very welcome to the Love-sick Prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cess, yet that she might not seem too forward, with a Maidenly modesty she thus replyed:</p>

                        <p>She would have proceeded further, but Sir <hi>Alexander</hi> and the Lady <hi>Alsatia</hi> having finished their dance, the Cornets and other Wind-Musiek sounding aloud, they were called away to beheld another Scene of fresh Maskers, which in this sort entertained the beholders, First entered the likeness of a stately Fabrick, made of Paste-board, and adorned with many golden streamers, which represented the Temple of <hi>Honour;</hi> this was drawn to the further side of that spatious Room, wherein being placed, soon after entered another Fabrick, but more lower, and not so richly a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dorned, which represented the Temple of <hi>Vertue,</hi> and was so pla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ced, that none could enter the Temple of <hi>Honour,</hi> but must first pass through the Temple of <hi>Vertue.</hi> After entered several per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sons who attempted to get into the Temple of <hi>Honour,</hi> but were loath to go through the Temple of <hi>Vertue,</hi> therefore they missed of their aim: Those who went through the Temple of <hi>Vertue,</hi> were richly adorned and rewarded, and greatly honoured of the people. But those who would climb up to the Temple of <hi>Honour,</hi> and not enter it by the Temple of <hi>Vertue,</hi> it was made so slip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pery on the top, that with the least treading awry, they fell down and brake their Necks.</p>

                        <p>Most Noble Prince, my coming hither to you, is to desire of you assistance for our distressed Country of <hi>Thessaly,</hi> opprest, and almost desolated by the Encroachments and Tyranny of the King of <hi>Thrace</hi>: The cause of which quarrel he pretends to be, for that our King having but one Daughter named <hi>Mariana,</hi> the Heiress to his Crown and dominions: Being a Lady not only endued with excellency of Natures gifts; but withal so vertuous, affable, and every way compleat in knowledge, that she may well be said to be the darling of her Sex, and admiration of all that know her.

In the Ualley of <hi>Tempe</hi> they joyned battle, where notwithstand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing our men did what in them lay, as fighting for the Liberty of their Country, yet being overpowered, and bore down by the strength and valour of the Gyant <hi>Predo,</hi> they received a dismal overthrow, the greatest part of their Army slain, and most of the rest taken Prisoners, amongst whom our woful King was one, who encountering <hi>Predo,</hi> who had on him a Coat of Mail, and over that an Armour of two hundred pound weight, being on foot, for no Horse was able to bear him; Our King running a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainst him with his Lance, it shiver'd in a thousand pieces, nor could his Sword ought avail against the Gyants Armour, al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>though he laid so on load that the sparkles flew from it as from a piece of hot Iron, when a Smith is working it.

                        <p>The distressed estate of the <hi>Thessalians</hi> was such, as called aloud for help and succour, which made the <hi>Sicilians</hi> to make such hast, that in four days time they were gotten into the bounds of pleasant <hi>Thessaly,</hi> a Country formerly enriched with all the delights that Art and Nature could afford, but now by the miseries of War so ruinated and devasted, that it looked like to a barren Wilderness. The first place they made to was the City of <hi>Larissa,</hi> wherein the Princess <hi>Urania</hi> was besieged; for the relief of which Sir <hi>Alex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ander</hi> was sent before with a choice part of the Army to give them a Camisado in the night season, the rest of the Army marching at more leisure to second them, if they should be over-power'd: And one of the <hi>Thessalians</hi> who was well acquainted with the Country, was sent into the City to give them notice of their coming, and that at such a time they should make what strength they could, and give a salley out upon the <hi>Thracians.</hi> This <hi>Thes<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>salian</hi> who was thus sent in brought great comfort unto the besieg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, who accordingly prepared against the time, and so about mid<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>night, when Sir <hi>Alexander</hi> with his Army was come within sight of the City, and holding up a blazing Torch to give them notice of their approach, they issued out of their Gates, and manfully set upon the <hi>Thracians:</hi> Sir <hi>Alexander</hi> on the other side coming upon their Backs, fell on them with such fury, as sent such num<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bers of the <hi>Thracians</hi> souls to the lower Regions, that <hi>Charons</hi> Boat was overburthened with their numbers. Sir <hi>Alexander</hi> laid about him with such incredible valour, that he made a Lane of slaughtered Carcasses, till he came to the <hi>Thracian</hi> Kings Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vilion, who not dreaming of any Enemies approach, was at that time asleep in his Bed; but being ala<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

his Cloaths, Sir <hi>Alexander</hi> was entered his Pavilion, and took him Prisoner. Then fell the hearts of the <hi>Thracians,</hi> nothing being heard but cryes and lamentations of wounded men: Here was one who would have run away, but had one Leg cut off, and the other deeply wounded; here another entangled in his fellows guts, which he could not disentangle; having both his Arms cut off. Here lay the Trunk of a Body without a Head, and there a Head gasping, as if it would speak to what Body it belonged: In some Death appeared in so many shapes, and all of them so horrid, that to any but a very unrelenting heart indeed, the sight would appear very pitiful.</p>
                        <p>By this time was Sir <hi>Guy</hi> come up with the rest of the Forces, where he found an absolute Uictory obtained to his hand, so that all which they had to do, was only to take Prisoners, and divide the spoil amongst the Souldiers. By this time <hi>Hiperion</hi> with his Golden Chariot had enlightened our lower Hemisphear. Wherefore the Army marched into the City to refresh themselves; Sir <hi>Alexander</hi> as he worthyly deserved the Honour of the Uicto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry, leading his Royal Prisoner, to present him to the Princess <hi>Mariana,</hi> who was ready to receive him, with all due acknowledg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments to the three Brothers, but in an especial manner to Sir <hi>Alexander,</hi> for his Magnanimity, and Martial Conduct, in the rescuing of her and the Kingdom, from so implacable an Enemy. <hi>Most Heroick Knight,</hi> (said the Lovely Princess) <hi>although my Tongue is not able to express how much I am indebted to your Victorious Arm, nor to set forth your due deserved merits, whose worth transcends all E<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

I am sure if you did, you might well think it was not the way to come a speeding; And now Sir, since we have you, (and I must confess, rather as an Enemy then a Lover) you must not be angry if we safe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly secure you, until we hear how Our Royal Father is used by those that belong unto you;</hi> And so committed him to the Custody of the Marshal of her Houshold, to be kept Prisoner in a strong Tower,

This being done, she invited the three Brothers, with many of the other Chief Commanders into her Palace, where having disarmed themselves, and refreshed with some Bowls of Greekish Wine; there was provided for them a Banquet of the choicest fare which they had about them at that time, the long and strait Siege which they had endured, having eaten up the most part of their Provision, The Banquet being ended, they were entertained with most excellent Musick, inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mixed with Songs in praise of the <hi>Sicilians</hi> Ualour, for in the Art of Poetry the <hi>Thessalians</hi> are very expert.

                           <hi>Most Courteous Knight, to whom I stand so much obliged for former courtesies, that all which I can do will not stand in compe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tition of your deserts, yet the natural affection which I bear to my Aged Father, compels me at this time humbly to implore your fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther assistance, which as I doubt not (the Gods being just in right<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full</hi>
                           <pb n="25" facs="tcp:29556:180"/>

                        </p>
                        <p>Their Minds thus made known to each other, gave great con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tentment to them both, especially to Sir <hi>Alexander,</hi> who humbly kissing the hands of the Princess, replyed thus unto her.</p>
                        <p>
                           <hi>Madam, There is no danger in the World so great which I shall not adventure on for your sake; were it to perform the twelve la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bours of</hi> Hercules; <hi>or with Aeneas to encounter with the Gyant</hi> Turnus: <hi>Be pleased therefore to accept me as your Knight and Servant, and I hope to behave my self so hereafter, as you shall have no cause to repent you thereof.</hi> To whom the Princess smi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling, said, <hi>Sir, I do accept you for my Knight, and hope the Gods will be so propitious to you for my sake, that you shall not have an enemy able to withstand you.</hi> With which words, taking a rich Diamond Ring from off her Finger, and giving it him, she said, <hi>wear this for my sake, that whensoever hereafter you look on it, it may add fresh courage into your breast by the remembrance of me.</hi> Much other Discourse they had, but the Army being now upon their march, summoned Sir <hi>Alexander</hi> to march along with them. Wherefore taking a gentle farewel of the Princess, having vow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed constancy on both sides, he joyned himself unto the Army, whose Knightly adventures, with those of his two Brothers, we shall prosecute in the next Chapter.</p>

                        </argument>
                        <p>THE Negromancer <hi>Soto</hi> who lived with the Gyant <hi>Predo,</hi> in the <hi>Inchanted Castle,</hi> knowing by his Magick spells, that the <hi>Sicilian</hi> Army had given their King a total overthrow, and
<pb n="26" facs="tcp:29556:181"/>
taken him Prisoner; as also how they were marching towards the Country of <hi>Thrace,</hi> he acquainted the Gyant with his know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge, who thereupon bestired himself in all haste to their resistance; sending for his two Brothers, <hi>Brandamore the</hi> stout, and <hi>Pan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>daphilo the cruel,</hi> to come with all speed unto his assistance, who no sooner had notice thereof, but that with their Forces belonging unto them they hastned away. In like manner he sent unto Count <hi>Brandamil,</hi> whom the King of <hi>Thrace</hi> had left his Deputy, at such time as he made his expedition in <hi>Thessaly,</hi> to raise what power he could against the <hi>Sicilians.</hi> And now nothing was heard but the loud sound of the thundering Drum, and the shrill noise of the sounding Trumpet, horrour and amazement siczed on the stoutest heart, and the fore-boding Ravens foretold the fall of flaughtered Carcasses; Whilst these things were acting in <hi>Thrace,</hi> the <hi>Sieilian</hi> Army being jonyed with the <hi>Thessalians,</hi> and making in all to the number of forty thousand men, armed with a just cause, marched in great confidence of an assured Uictory. And now being entered into the Territories of <hi>Thrace,</hi> the first that marched against them was Count <hi>Brandamil,</hi> with an Army of fif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty thousand <hi>Thracians,</hi> where joyning Battel together, it was fought with much eager Courage on both sides, each of them stri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving to outvie the other in Ualour the one side to defend their Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tive Country, the other to revenge the losses they had sustained by their enemy: Uictory thus for a long while stood hovering over the heads of both Armies, till in the end, the valiant Knight Sir <hi>David,</hi> who had the honour that day to lead the Uaunt-guard, en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>countering with Count <hi>Brandamil,</hi> by main strength overthrew him, bearing him with his Lance quite over the Crupper of his Horse, whereby his fall was so great, that the blood gushed forth of his mouth, whereupon the <hi>Sicilians</hi> gave such a shout, that the Earth rang with the sound thereof, and the <hi>Thracians</hi> courage was quite cast down; for the loss of a General is a general loss: And now the <hi>Thracians</hi> began to turn their backs and flee, when in the instant came to their rescue the two Gyants, <hi>Brandamore</hi> and <hi>Pandaphilo,</hi> with the Forces they had, which though but few yet, gave such proof of their valour, that they almost routed <hi>Thracians</hi> rallying again, set so fiercely upon the <hi>Sicilians,</hi> that in great dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>order they began to give back. And now did Sir <hi>Guy</hi> bestir him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>self, encouraging those who were about to flee, to stand to it man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fully, himself, doing such execution upon his enemies, that they
<pb n="27" facs="tcp:29556:181"/>
flew from before his conquering sword, as a flock of Sh√©ep from the devouring Wolf. Whilst thus he drove the <hi>Thracians</hi> before him, he at last met with the Gyant <hi>Brandamore,</hi> to whom he cry<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, defend thy self thou mishapen Fiend, whose bulk is a weight too heavy for the Earth to bear; and therefore prepare thy self, for I intend that thou shalt this night <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

And finding by this he had a stronger Foe to encounter withal then he thought for, he waxed more wary, not only to as<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sail, but also to defend himself. And now the Gyant began to use his Club, which was of a wondrous length, and withal so weighty, that had it lighted on Sir <hi>Guy,</hi> it would at one blow have crushed him to pieces. After long fighting, the Gyant be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing angry to be thus repulsed, which never before in his life he had b√©en, <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

Then Sir <hi>Guy</hi> nimbly alighting from his Horse, intended with his Sword to have smitten off the Gyants head, but at that instant Pandaphilo the other Gyant came running in to his Brothers res<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cue, and undoubtedly had done Sir <hi>Guy</hi> much prejudice, being then almost spent with fighting, had not Sir <hi>David</hi> timely suc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cor'd him, who searching out for <hi>Pandaphilo,</hi> finding his Brother so hard bestead, he coupled with him in fight, which was perform<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed with such Manhood on both sides, that I want Art to describe the same. <hi>Pandaphilo</hi> trusting to his strength, laid on load with great fury, which blows Sir <hi>David</hi> nimbly avoided, and withal gave his adversary ever and anon such lusty knocks, that he well perceived he had a valiant Foe to encounter withal. In the mean time the Gyant <hi>Brandamore</hi> was scrambled up, and began a fresh encounter with Sir <hi>Guy:</hi> Whilst these four were thus busied in

Know then that I am a Native of this Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>try, and at such time when Fortune smiled on me, Wife to a Noble Knight named <hi>Fonteious,</hi> a Man Renowned through all <hi>Thrace,</hi> for his Learning and Liberality, two special Ornaments of a noble Mind: Rich he was both in Wealth and Uertue, which two though they seldom go together, yet in him had they their re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sidence. At the age of sixteen years I was married unto him; now whether likeness be the cause of Love, or Love she cause of liking, I know not, but so it was that reciprocal Love passed betwixt us, I loving him because he was kind unto me, and he being kind to me, because I loved him; long time thus lovingly lived we together, until <hi>Atropos</hi> cutting off the thread of his Life, gave an ultimum vale to my good fortune; for my Husband leav<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing me very rich, and I being withal young and beautiful, you may be sure such a Widow would not be long without suiters: And indeed it was not long before I had plenty of them; so that the famous <hi>Ulysses</hi> House during his ten years absence at the siege of <hi>Troy,</hi> was not more thronged with them to court the chaste <hi>Pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nelope,</hi> then was my House to gain my favour. Amongst others

of this gallant Crew was one Sir <hi>Vylon;</hi> a man who had he been endued with internal vertues, as he was adorned with a comely out-side, he might have been a match fit for a Princess: The mul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiplicity of his vows, the protestations of his love, his gifts up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on gifts, were as so many snares to entrap me. To be short, with the catching Oratory of his words, and Language strowed with flowers, he wone me, and matcht me: But long had not we been Married together, (although no cause given on my part) but his smiles were returned into frowns; no just pretence could he make therefore, though many were pretended, at last he found a means to accomplish his desire, which he brought to pass in this manner.</p>
                        <p>He hearing of the Fame of this Inchanted Castle, with the dire effects attending upon those which came near it: Pretended a Letter as come from a Brother of mine, who had been long ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sent, and was thought (as indeed he then was) dead.

Scarcely had she ended her Song, when Sir <hi>Guy</hi> came to take his leave of her, finding her sitting in such a given over manner, one would have thought silence, solitariness and melancholly, were come under the ensign of mishap to conquer delight, and drive him from his natural seat of Beauty. But now to describe the grief of these two Lovers at their parting, I must implore the help of <hi>Melpomene,</hi> the mournfullest of the nine Muses to guide my Pen; the sorrow of <hi>Orpheus</hi> for his beloved <hi>Euridice, An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dromache</hi> for <hi>Hector, Aegens</hi> for his supposed dead <hi>Theseus, An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tigone</hi> leading her blind Father <hi>Oedipus,</hi> or that of weeping <hi>Ni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>obe</hi> for the loss of her Children, compared to this, deserve not the names of grief.

Hath my Prayers pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vailed so far with the Divine Powers, to bring you unto me again in safety, and now will you leave me to enter again into fresh dan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gers: Did you not swear by all that is Divine and Humane, sooner should Phaebus cease to shine by day, or Luna lend us her light by night, then that your heart should be separated from mine, which then you pretended to be dearer unto you then victuals to the al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>most famisht Soul, or drink to those whose Throats are parcht with thirst. If my Love was so dear unto you then, what change have you found, in me, that after the accomplishment of your</hi> Thes<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>salian <hi>Journey, we should not then enjoy the fruition of our Loves, but that you will adventure again on new engagements, preferring your honour and desire of Fame, before my unstained Love, which hath been as true and constant to you, as ever was that of the chast</hi> Penelope <hi>to wandering</hi> Ulysses.</p>

The rest of the Army were Pioneers, Waggoners, Uictuallers, and such others as are commonly attendant on an Army.

Divers Captains of other Nations came also in aid of the Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stians Army; as Sir <hi>Lando the Warlike,</hi> with five thousand stout Swedish Souldiers; Sir <hi>Pandrasus the Dane,</hi> having in his Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pany a Gyant named <hi>Wonder,</hi> for his unmatchless strength, which was such that he would lift a weight which twelve ordina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry men could hardly stir, besides divers others too many to enumerate, the whole sum amounting to thr√©e hundred thousand. After they had consulted a while together, it was concluded unani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mously among them all, that every Captain should have the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mand of those Souldiers he brought out of his own Country, but that in difficult matters and wherein diversity of opinions might breed confusion, it should be referred to Sir <hi>Guys</hi> ordering, who was made Generalissimo of the whole Army. And now having nothing else to do but to march against their Enemies: Sir <hi>Guy</hi> to incourage them the more, being all the chief of them assembled together, made unto them this following Oration.</p>

                           <hi>Fellow Souldiers and Brethren in Arms, I think I shall not need many words to stir you up to Magnanimity, the justness of our Cause being such as rightly considered, is enough to make a coward valiant; I hope you are not so forgetful, that you now go to fight for your Parents, your Wives, your Children, your Country, and what should be most dear unto you, the Christian Religion; against Pagans, Infidels, and Miscreants, enemies to God and goodness; whose delight is only in Blood and Rapine, whose trade and pra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctice is the burning and destroying of Towns and Villages, mur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thering of Matrons, ravishing VVives and Virgins, tossing of sprawling Infants on the tops of their mercyless Pikes; In sum, such people as act all what barbarism and cruelty prompts them to. Therefore if ye are not willing to see these miseries fall upon ye, be valiant and couragious, and so let us willingly go on, arm<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed with a just cause, and doubt not in the least, but the just God will give us victory.</hi>

                        <p>No sooner had he ended his Oration, but it was received with a general Acclamation, each one vowing to live and dye in such a Cause, and under the conduct of such a General.

                        <p>NOW notwithstanding this great preparation to withstand the Pagan Army, a great fear and consternation still con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinued in the hearts of the people, for the report of the vastness of the Pagans Army, was spread abroad in each place, so that it was deemed so numerous as not to be encountered withal: The best remedy therefore as they thought was by Prayers to God to crave his assistance against such potent Enemies; so that in every place intercessions were sent up to Heaven for succour in this or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>igeney of time. Now it so chanced that at the same time there lived in the North Country a certain Holy Hermit nam'd <hi>Sylva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nus:</hi> To this man it was revealed in a Dream, how that the se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven famous Champions were not wholly dead, but that for the good of <hi>Christendom</hi> they should again awake, and holy to overcome the Pagan Army: And that by opening their Tombs, and laying the Herb <hi>Bazil</hi> to the Roots of their Tongues, they should revive again in good strength and vigour. This Dream he declared un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to an Abbot of an Abby near adjoying, and he to the Governour of that Province, who altogether went to the English Court, and declared the same unto the King; whereupon it was determined that the experiment should soon be tryed, and accordingly Messen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gers

were dispatched into <hi>France, Spain, Italy, Scotland, Ireland</hi> and <hi>VVales,</hi> which Message was no sooner delivered in those several Countries, but that they soon applyed the same, and found the effect answerable to what the Hermit had dreamed; for im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mediately thereupon the Champions arose as out of a sweet sleep, and having a while discoursed of those matters we have in the former Chapters declared unto you, the Messengers were return<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed back again with this agreement, that with all expedition they should meet together in the Country of <hi>Naples</hi> aforesaid, that with the better celerity they might overtake and joy<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

of their approach, who thereupon instantly armed themselves, and put themselves in as good a posture as on the sudden they could.

On the other side Sir <hi>Turpin</hi> with his <hi>French</hi> gave a lusty charge on the King of <hi>Egypt,</hi> insomuch that he was in great danger of a total rout, had he not been time<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly succor'd by the King of <hi>Morocco,</hi> who stoutly interposing, drove the <hi>French</hi> back in much confusion; whereupon Sir <hi>Lando</hi> the <hi>Warlike</hi> set upon them with an undaunted courage, which gave a check to their proc√©edings, which with his warlike <hi>Swedes</hi> he so stoutly followed, that coming up to the King of <hi>Morocco,</hi> after a fierce encounter betwixt them two, in which <hi>Mars</hi> him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>self might have been a looker on, at length the King of <hi>Morocco</hi> being deadly wounded, surrendred up his Life and Body to the Uictors disposal. And now the main Battle came forwards, by which time the Sun with his Beams had guilded the Hemis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phear, so that they could see to fight with more eagerness than they did before. The valiant Sir <hi>Guy</hi> charged strongly upon the <hi>Persians,</hi> who with great courage and skill defended themselves: Count <hi>Primaleon</hi> with his <hi>Germans</hi> encountered the <hi>Arabians,</hi> and now generally both Armies were fully engaged, so that death began to appear in its greatest horrour: Then was cutting, hack<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, and flashing on every side; The Renowned Christian Cap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tains dealing such blows with their swords, and giving so many <hi>Mahumetans</hi> their deaths, as if they intended to overcharge <hi>Cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rons</hi> boat in ferrying them over the <hi>Stygian</hi> River: The Infidels on the other side held out with great obstinacy, not shrinking for any danger, although they were ready to be carried away in streams of their own blood.

Next Morning no sooner had <hi>Aurora</hi> usher'd in the day, but both armies met again in the Field, and as if their stock of Ua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lour were afresh renewed, fell to it with more eagerness and earnestness than before, unto their work of Mankinds destruction, the thundring Drums beat alarums of Death, and the shrill Trumpets sounded forth many thousands that day their knell; horrour, death and destruction, surrounded the <hi>Pagans</hi> on every side, yet still their fresh number made more work for the Christi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans valour. In the heat of this Fight it was Sir <hi>Guys</hi> chance to meet with the Horse-faced <hi>Tartar</hi> (whom we told you of in the first Chapter of this Third Part) whom he resolved to en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>counter, but the sight of him so frighted the other Horses, that not one of them would endure to come near him; whereupon Sir <hi>Guy</hi> alighted from his Stood, and with his Cuttle axe approach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed the Monster, whose very looks would have affrighted any but such a one whose heart was fraught with true Magnanimity: The Monster was readier to assail then be assailed, so that betwixt them two began a most fierce and terrible Combat. The Mon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ster was so nimble, and laid on load so strangely, that Sir <hi>Guy</hi> was never so put to it all the days of his Life; at last spying his advantage, he gave the Monster such a Wound on his Thigh, that sending forth a hideous Yell, he ran from him with a nimble pace to the Rear of his Army: And now the <hi>Pagans</hi> began to shrink, and the Christians to gain ground, when the Wizzards and In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chanters which the <hi>Egyptian</hi> King had brought with him, began to show their skill, so that on a sudden there was such a fear and consternation throughout all the Host of the Christians, as put a stop to their full carreer of Uictory; for immediately such a dark<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness overspread them, that they could hardly discern one from the other, and withal they received divers blows, yet could not per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive who it was that gave them. This continued for three hours space together, which much daunted the Christians courage, but making their hearty Supplications to God, they were not only delivered from their unseen blows, but also the darkness turn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed upon the Pagan Army, from whence was heard such hi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deous shrieks and howlings, with such other dreadful noise, as if Hell were broke loose, and the Devils gone to Barley<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>break. Upon this the Christians not daring to pursue them any further, retreated to their Camp, and having set a strong Watch, they Reposed themselves for that Night.</p>

The next Morning preparing themselves again to fight, they heard behind them a sound of Trumpets, as it were of an Army upon a march; whereupon Sir <hi>Guy</hi> sent out a Party to discover what they were, who sound them to be the thrice Renowned Champions of <hi>Chrystendom,</hi> that after their departure from <hi>Thes<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>saly,</hi> having a prosperous Wind, they Arrived on the Coasts of <hi>Asia,</hi> where hearing by the report of Fames loud sounding Trum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pet, where these Sons of <hi>Mars</hi> were assembled together, they with a speedy march made up unto them: But now to express the great joy mixed with wonder and amazement betwixt these No<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble <hi>Heroes,</hi> at this their meeting, it would require the skill of <hi>Homer,</hi> and the aid of <hi>Calliope,</hi> that sweet Tongu'd Sister of the nine Muses, for to express; to see such near and dear Relations, who were supposed to be dead, and to see them at such a time when as their help was so needful, it far surpassed the joy of that <hi>Gre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cian</hi> Father, when his three Sons returned home Uictors from the <hi>Olympick</hi> Games. Whilst they were thus congratulating the happy sight of each other, they had an Alarum from the Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gan Camp, who being conducted by the thr√©e Gyants, with an assured confidence of Uictory, came marching up to the Christi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans Army, thinking them so shattered and dismayed, as not able to endure another Fight, and therefore came rather as to a spoil then to be encountered withal; but they found the Christians rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy to entertain them with a bloody Banquet, for coming in disor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der, they were received with such a lusty charge, as sent many of their Souls to the Infernal Regions. St. <hi>George</hi> perceiving the three Gyants, the only stop of the Christians Uictory, he singled out one of the chiefest of them; the Ualiant Champion St. <hi>Denis</hi> encountered with another, and the Couragious St. <hi>Anthony</hi> with the third: Whilst they were thus engaged against each other, dealing such blows, as if <hi>Alcides</hi> were again living, and fight<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing with the Gyant <hi>Anteus;</hi> it was Sir <hi>Guys</hi> Fortune to m√©et with the <hi>Egyptian</hi> King, accompanied with his Magicians and Soothsayers, who began afresh to use their Inchantments, and first they raised up the likeness of a mighty black Bear, which running hither and thither in the Christians Army, put them in great disorder: At last she ran violently against Sir <hi>Guy,</hi> who laying Manfully about him, he thought he cut off one of her Legs, when she vanishing away, it proved only a leg of a stool. Next came running amongst them a mighty wild Bore, with Tusks
<pb n="52" facs="tcp:29556:194"/>
as large as an ordinary Cows horns; this Bore so frighted the Soldiers, that wheresoever he came they tumbled over one ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther in heaps; and having thus played his wreaks amongst the <hi>English,</hi> he next ran into the Army of the <hi>Spaniards,</hi> snorting and tearing up the ground with his Tusks. The Ualiant Knight Sir <hi>Pedro</hi> hearing the shout of the Soldiers, and wondring what was the matter, came riding in haste to the place, and viewing the Bore, he ran against him with all his might, but notwithstand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing his Sword was made of the purest <hi>Lydian</hi> Steel, yet made it no impression on the sides of the Bore; wherefore Sir <hi>Pedro</hi> seeing that way would not do, the Bore coming towards him with open mouth, he ran his Sword down his <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

Whilst thus these Negromancers were practising their Devilish Inchantments, in the mean time the three Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nowned Champions had by their Magnanimous Prowess con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quered the Gyants, with whose fall fell also the courage of the whole Pagan Army, so that in great disorder they began to run. And now all hands were bathed in blood, and the thirsty Soyl ran with a Purple Stream: In one place lay disinherited heads, dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>possest of their natural Seignories, there lay Armes, whose Fin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gers yet moved, as if they would feel for him that made them feel, and Legs which contrary to common reason, were made heavier by being discharged of their burthens. And now the Christians ore-wearied with killing, had with the day brought many thou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sand Pagans to their ends, when the Sable Night drawing her black Curtain over the Hemisphear, put a period to the pursuit. The next Morning the Soldiers arose betimes to pillage the Field, which they found exceeding rich; most of the Pagan Comman<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders were slain, and the whole Army so shattered, that scarce a hundred of them were left together in one company. The Horse-faced Monster with some others made their escape, being so swift that no Horse could overtake him; amongst the rest of the Pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>soners that were taken was one of the chief <hi>Egyptian</hi> Magicians, who being stript of his uppermost Robe, there was found about him a number of Spells, Charmes, and other Negromansick Characters, amongst others was the Picture of a Devil, with this Label proceeding out of his Month;</p>

This dreadful Tempest continued near the space of an hour, when all on a sudden it began to calm, and the winds to retire, and sink into their seat, <hi>Phoebus</hi> sent forth his lightsome Rayes, which dispelled the darkness of the pitchy Clouds; when the Christians looking upon them, saw the rufullest spectacle that ever mortal eye beheld; the Field was strewed with pieces of mangled Carcases, and those as black as Pitch, stinking of Sulphur and Brimstone; for the term of years being expired, wherein they had Covenanted with the Devil, he now sent his Spirits to fetch their Souls, who had mangled their Bodies in that dispiteous manner we told you of; a just reward for all such as devote themselves to the service of the Devil.</p>
                        <p>The Christians having obtained this signal Uictory, gave thanks to God throughout all the Army; and now victuals grow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing scarce, by reason of the great number of the Soldiers, they resolved for to break up Camp, and those that would to depart

Sir <hi>Turpin</hi> seeing himself thus overmatched by strength, thought to use policy, and therefore counterfeiting a slight, retreated to a place, where advantaged by the ground, and his chiefest Captains, he might the better deal with him; but Providence had ordained a better remedy, for at that very in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stant it so happened that Sir <hi>Pedro</hi> with his Army of <hi>Spaniards,</hi> having been sorely weather-beaten at Sea, were by stress of wea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther forced to that Island for succour, where no seener landed but they had information of this Battle, and therefore after a short refreshing they made up to them; and now slaughter and destru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction fell heavy on both sides, the devouring sword making ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny windows in their bodies for death to enter in at; much cou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rage was shown on both parts, each striving to gain honour by the others ruine.

towards the City; but there he found but cold entertainment, for the Citizens hearing how the <hi>Frenchmen</hi> were landed; and that the Gyant with the Kings Guard were gone to fight with them, they took the opportunity of the time, and making a ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neral Insurrection, siezed upon the King, secured the Gates of the City, and stood upon their own defence, and immediately dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>patched a Messenger to the <hi>French</hi> and <hi>Spaniards,</hi> to inform them what they had done, who upon the hearing of the News, sent forth such a shout, that the Earth rang with the noise thereof. The Gyant with his company hearing the loud shout of the <hi>French</hi> and <hi>Spaniards,</hi> were in a wonderful amaze, and seeing themselves surrounded with danger before and behind, they saw there was no other way but to secure themselves by flight; which proved the more advantagious to them, by reason the <hi>French</hi> were so enfee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bled through lack of sustenance, and long fighting, that they were not able to pursue them; wherefore leaving the Chace, they marched directly to the City, being of the Citizens entertained with much joy, who presently sent forth fresh men after the Gy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ant, whom Sir <hi>Pedro</hi> would n√©eds head, whilst the rest refreshed themselves in the City. These fresh men by intelligence of the Country people, had soon notice whether the Gyant with the greatest part of his men were gone, whereupon Sir <hi>Pedro</hi> taking along with him a choice party of the swiftest Horsemen, pursued him so fast, that in a short space they had a view of him; but the envious Destinies had so ordered it, that near thereunto there was a strong Castle, into which he was entered before he could be over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taken; wherefore they resolved for to besiege it, and either force him by Famine to submit himself, or to gain his fr√©edom by ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zard of battle.</p>
                        <p>Whilst they were thus busied in besieging the Gyant, and the Army refreshing themselves in the City, it happened that the Captain of the Guard, with a party of such as fled with him, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing joyned to some others whose despicable fortunes made them desperate, having intelligence that the <hi>French</hi> and <hi>Spanish</hi> Ships were but weakly guarded, he with incredible celerity siezed on them, forcing those Seamen that were in them to weigh Anchor, and hoise Sail into the Sea, intending to go unto the Island <hi>Zey<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lon,</hi> near thereunto adjoyning, to raise Forces to withstand the Enemy, or if that failed, to s√©ek a habitation in some other re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mote Country.

Sir <hi>Owen</hi> with great valour defended himself, notwithstanding he were oppressed with the multitude of his enemies, which were so many in number above his men, that he had b√©en in some danger of being worsted, had not in the very nick of opportunity Sir <hi>Phelim</hi> with his <hi>Irish</hi> come timely to his rescue; but now being strengthened with this recruit, they so re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>solutely charged on the <hi>Cypriots,</hi> that first they began to retreat, and afterwards sought to shift away the best they could by flight: But these Soldiers were so unskilful in Sea-affairs, and the Sea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men whom they had forced to go along with them being joyful to be relieved by the <hi>Welsh</hi> and <hi>Irish,</hi> they so ordered the business that the Ships were all taken, and the Soldiers in them carried back to the Port from whence they had b√©en forced away.</p>

                        <p>
                           <hi>Gyant, leave thy proud boasting, for know it will behove thee more to use thy hands then thy Tongue.

                        </p>
                        <p>And now Sir <hi>Owen</hi> seeing the Gyant on foot, alighted from his Horse, that it should not be said advantage added any thing to his Uictory; then drawing their swords, they laid on load with great courage, dealing such blows, that to the beholders sight the least of them would leave death behind it, and those laid on so thick, as if that every blow would have been foremost. Thus continued they for some time, their Swords like Canons, batter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing down the Walls of their Armour, making breaches almost in every place for troops of wounds to enter. At last the Gyant be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gan to saint, the weightiness of his great Iron Club, together with the heat of the Sun which then shined forth in its brightest lustre, made him so sweat, as if he had been working at the <hi>Cy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clops</hi> Forge, or hammering at the sooty God <hi>Vulcans</hi> Anvile; yet like the dying Taper willing to give one flash of valour before his fall, taking his Iron Club in both his hands, he struck at Sir <hi>Owen</hi> with all his might, but his Eyes being blinded with the sweat, he mist his blow, and with the force thereof tumbled down upon his Face, giving Sir <hi>Owen</hi> thereby a fit opportunity to fi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nish his Uictory, which soon he did, by cutting off his Head from his Body.</p>
                        <p>The <hi>Cyprians</hi> seeing their Champion slain, presently yielded up the Castle, and the news being bruited abroad the Country, they came from all places, and submitted themselves unto these valiant Captains mercy, who received their submissions with much gentleness and courtesie; soon after they caused an Assem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bly to be made of the chiefest persons of all the Realm, before whom, the Usurper <hi>Isakius</hi> was brought, where the Counsel being set, one of the chiefest Advocates of the Land spake as followeth;</p>
                        <p>
                           <q>Right Honourable, you may please to understand that this
<pb n="60" facs="tcp:29556:198"/>
                              <hi>Isakius</hi> here before you, the pretended King of <hi>Cyprus</hi> was Brother to <hi>Amadeus</hi> our Lawful King, and whose Ancestors have for many descents enjoyed this Crown. This <hi>Amadeus</hi> when he dyed left behind him one only Son, a Child of two years old, named also <hi>Amadeus,</hi> to whom he bequeathed his Crown, making his Brother <hi>Isakius</hi> a Guardian and Protector to him during his minority; but he instead of a Guardian to defend, proved a Wolf to destroy; in stead of a Protector to nourish, became a Tyger to devour; for he having gotten into Authority, and secured the chiefest strengths of the Realm in his hand, he soon picked a quarrel with all the Nobility, whom he thought in the least-wise favoured <hi>Amadeus,</hi> and by surmi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zed faults bereft them of their Lives, and siezed on their Estates; and that he might not be brought to account for these his lawless actions, he gained to his support the assistance of the Gyant <hi>Guylon,</hi> which by your unmatchable sorce hath been brought to his end. And now being secured as he thought in his Tyranny, he soon disposed of young <hi>Amadeus,</hi> but how, or which ways, is to us unknown; Our Request therefore is (most Noble Captains) that he may by force be made to confess what he hath done with him; that if alive he may be restored unto us, but if otherwise (which the Gods forbid) he may be punished for the same according to his deserts</q>
                        </p>
                        <p>Then was <hi>Isakius</hi> called to answer for himself, who trembling for fear, having a load of guilt upon his Conscience, with a pale Countenance, and faultring Sp√©ech, made this reply;</p>
                        <p>
                           <q>If a fair acknowledgment may mitigate my Crime, I shall hereby fr√©ely give it you, confessing the uttermost to my know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge, that by imparting the same, I may in some measure un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>burthen my Conscience, which doth now grievously oppress me. Know then that an ambitious desire of sitting in the Throne, made me make a Ladder of mischief to ascend there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>unto; in order hereof, having level'd my way, by destroying all those who I thought would oppose my designs, yet thought I not my self sure, until I had so disposed of the Heir that he might not be heard of, knowing that people have always a great affection to the Lawful Successor, yet resolved not to murther him, that if afterwards I should be called to account, by pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>serving his Life I might the better secure my own. Therefore by the help of a trusty Servant, I placed him with a Shepherd

Thus Gentle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men have I given you a true Relation of what I have done with the Prince, which it you please to send to the Shepherd, you will have the Truth confirmed by Eye-sight, he being at this present in good health; as I am informed by the same Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vant which placed him there, and who (if you please) shall con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duct those whom you send unto the place where he now resides.</q>

                           <hi>Isakius</hi> having ended his Speech, it was concluded the Prince should be immediately sent for, whereupon two Gentlemen of Quality were deputed to be the Messengers, who being attended with divers servants, and guided by <hi>Isakius</hi> Confident, in a short space came unto the Shepherds house, who seeing such a company before his door, was in a Bodily fear, but at last spying <hi>Beno,</hi> (for so was Isakius servant named) his heart waxed more chear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful; but when he heard them demand where the Prince then was, mistrusting by <hi>Beno's</hi> presence that young <hi>Ornus</hi> (such had they named the Prince <hi>Amadeus)</hi> to be the party they enquired for, he was almost fallen into a swound, expecting no other but that he should be hanged up; but being a little come to himself, he in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formed them that the Prince was at that present k√©eping of sh√©ep not past a half mile distant from that place; whereupon two of the chief of them being guided by the Shepherd, went to s√©ek him; now as they came near him, being entered into a little Thicket, they heard a voice which with great harmony uttered forth this Sonnet;</p>

fruitful Countries of <hi>Greece,</hi> they at last took shipping in a Haven Town of <hi>Peloponesus,</hi> when after thr√©e days sailing they saw before them a goodly Island, from whence they heard most terrible shrieks, as it were of tortured persons, and people in great distress; whereupon Sir <hi>Orlando</hi> and Sir <hi>Ewin</hi> command<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed the Marriners to make up to it, which they endeavoured to do, but coming near to it, it moved so from them, that notwith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>standing all their endeavours they could not reach it. Whilst thus they stood amazed at this strange adventure, there appeared unto them from out the Sea, a certain <hi>Tryton</hi> or Sea God, in the likeness of those which they call <hi>Mear-men,</hi> who shaking his shaggy locks, spake to them in the ship in this manner.</p>

In the mean space the souldiers landed themselves, and in a Warlike posture came to the rescue of the two Champions, who by this time through the scorching heat of the fire, and the strength of the Monster began to faint.

After these words spoken, with many other expressions of Love, and forgetfulness of what is past, they all went to view the Body of the Magician, which they found so fearfully dismembred as can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not without horrour be expressed; here lay his Brains in one place, in another an Eye, there a piece of his Iaw-bone; here an Arm, there a Leg, in another place a piece of his Buttocks, wrapped up with some of his rotten Guts, and all stinking so abominably, as the smell thereof was not possible to be endured. And now there being no entertainment in that Island for so ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny people as they had with them, they resolved upon their depar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, but before they went, they Erected up a high Pillar near to the place where the Magician was rent in pieces, on which Pillar these Uerses were inscribed;</p>

But these two valiant Captains, in whose Breasts were sown the seeds of true Magnanimity, soon grew weary of these Carpet delights, and therefore informed the Duke of their intention to depart, who though much loth do it, as persons to whom he

                        <p>To Sir <hi>Ewin</hi> he presented a rich Silver Target, beset on the sides with Emeraulds, Saphires, and other Stones of great va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lue, of such a Refulgent Lustre, as gave a light in the Night like unto so many Wax-Candles: In the middle thereof was por<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trayed <hi>Hector</hi> and <hi>Achilles</hi> in a single Turnament, the one breath<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing forth these words out of his mouth;</p>

                        <p>To the other Captains and Soldiers was also given gifts of great value, so that they departed away all of them very well sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tisfied. In their way homewards they met with certain Py<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rates, who roving upon the Coasts of <hi>Italy,</hi> took many of the Inhabitants Prisoners, amongst others was the Beautiful <hi>Cy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ropa,</hi> Sister unto Sir <hi>Orlando.</hi> With these Pyrates they en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gaged with much resolution, who made a very stout resistance, so that the Air was made dark with their flying Darts, and the Sea coloured with blood issuing from the scoop-holes; many were slain, and more wounded, before the Pyrats would hearken to yielding; but at last seeing themselves not able to hold out, they cryed for mercy, which the generous Captains Sir <hi>Orlando</hi> and Sir <hi>Ewin</hi> freely granted them. And so the Pyrats delivering up their Weapons to the Conquerours hands, they entered their Ships; but when Sir <hi>Orlando</hi> beheld his Sister amongst the Captives, he was intranced with wonder, and stood like a Stag at a gaze, as if his Soul had been gone upon some serious Errand, and left

the Corps in pawn till it came back. She on the other side was as much surprised to behold her Brother, and deliverer, whom she ran unto and kindly embraced. But if Sir <hi>Orlando</hi> was surprised with admiration, Sir <hi>Ewin</hi> was stricken into an exta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sie in beholding of her divine perfections, esteeming her to be Natures chief Masterpiece, whose rare composure modellized forth the height of all Beauty, so transcendantly did she show in this low estate, that he esteemed her to be the Magazine or Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon-Wealth of all Perfections, and the very true Elixir of Beauty.</p>
                        <p>These Excellencies shot a thousand Darts of <hi>Cupid</hi> into the heart of Sir <hi>Ewin,</hi> so that being emholdened by Love, he accosted her in this manner.</p>

                        </p>
                        <p>This Oration of St. <hi>George</hi> much comforted the hearts of all that heard him, but soon after greater comfort appeared, for on a sudden the Sky began to clear, and the Sun whom they had not beheld in many days, began to appear, and to shoot forth his en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lightening Rayes; Their ship now did not move of it self, nor knew the Marriners in what Coast they were, yet was their joy exceeding great to behold the lightsome beams of the Sun, and to converse with their Companions as well with their Eyes as with their Ears. Soon after they espyed Land, unto which they made with all the sp√©ed they could, and having landed, found it a very fruitful Country, stored abundantly with all sorts of Beasts, Birds, and other living Creatures; but neither Men, Women, nor Houses, nor any signs of any that had ever been there. This struck them all into wonder and amazement, but that which most of all amazed them, was to see these Beasts and Birds flock a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout them, and with bellowing, bleating, chirping, crying, and other signs, seem to make their moans unto them.

After Dinner having refreshed themselves with some bowls of <hi>heatick.</hi> Wine, he led, them up to the top of his Palace, which had a Galtery round about it to overlook, the Platns: Here having placed the Champions so that they might have a full prospect of the whole Country, sitting down in a Chair by them, he thus began.</p>
                        <p>Know worthy Knights at Arms, that this Country wherein you now are is called <hi>Scobellum,</hi> of such a fruitful Soyl, that it may well be stiled the Garden of <hi>Ceres,</hi> and Uintage of <hi>Bacchus;</hi> such is the plenty of all things therein; nor was it less Populous of Inhabitants then fruitful of necessaries for to maintain them; but this their plenty caused pride, and abundance of all things caused abundance of all manner of vices amongst them, so that as if they had ingrossed the Corruptions of all Nations to them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves, they could not have been a more desiled people then they were, exceeding the <hi>Cannibals</hi> for Cruelty, the <hi>Persians</hi> for Pride, the <hi>Egyptians</hi> for Luxury, the <hi>Cretians</hi> for Lying, the <hi>Germans</hi> for Drunkenness, and all Nations together for a generality of all manner of vices.

Drunkards were changed into swine, who still retain the same nature, there being no differ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence betwixt a drunkard and a swine. Leacherous persons were changed into Goats, and some of those finer sort of lustful people into Sparrows, whose Lives are short through too much Copu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lation.

In brief, Worthy Champions (for I would not trouble your Patience too long) there was a general Metamorphosis made of them all, each one accord<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to the degree wherein they had formerly lived, and this their punishment destined by the Fates for to endure until such time as some hardy Knight shall be so bold as to attempt the Conquest of the <hi>Golden Cave,</hi> which if he overcome, then shall their trans<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formations cease, and they return again to their proper shape.</p>
                        <p>Now worthy Knights, the Adventure of the <hi>Golden Cave</hi> is this; About six miles from this place lieth a Cave, the entrance whereinto is through divers windings and turnings, like unto a Labyrinth; in which Cave is kept a continual fire, made by such art as nothing shall quench it but only the water of a Cistern at the entrance of the said Cave, which is guarded by two Gyants, and two Centaurs, with whom they must combat before they can attain to the Cistern. Now worthy Chirstains, if there be any amongst you so adventurous, as for the sakes of these poor transformed people, will adventure your Lives, the enterprize will not only be honourable to your selves, but you will also ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lige thousands in thankful gratitude to your memories for so in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>estimable a benefit.</p>
                        <p>Now by the honour of my Country <hi>England</hi> said St. <hi>George,</hi> never let me buckle on Armour if I make not one in this enter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prize; so likewise said the other six Champions, each striving who should have the honour so accompany St. <hi>George</hi> in so noble an enterprize; wherefore that emulation might not cause any strife, they agreed to cast Lots amongst the sir, which of the three should accompany him; so accordingly they did, and the Lots tell upon the three famous Champions, St. <hi>Anthony</hi> of <hi>Italy,</hi> St. James of <hi>Spain,</hi> and St. <hi>Patrick</hi> of <hi>Ireland,</hi> who glad of their good Fortunes, propared themselves against the next day to try the ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venture, and on the Morning no sooner did <hi>Aurora</hi>

And taking a Guide with them from the Palmer, they traced to the <hi>Golden Cave,</hi> where they alighted, and gave the Guide their Horses to lead, resolving to try the adventure on foot, where approaching the Gate, they were met by a Dwarf, who spake to them in these words; <hi>Proud Knights, presume not to come within the compass of these Gates, least you repent your folly, and with the loss of your lives pay for your presumption:</hi> To whom St. <hi>George</hi> answered, <hi>Dwarf, go tell your Masters, we come to try our skills with them, to prove which of our Sword, cuts sharpest.</hi> That shall you soon see said the Dwarf, and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turning to the Cave told the Gyants what St. <hi>George</hi> said, who presently came marching out to them, with each an Oak upon his Shoulder, which when they came near unto the Champions, they brandisht over their heads, as if they had b√©en Hazel twigs <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

The Champions nimbly avoided their blows, and getting within the Compass of their Oaks, made up to the Gyants, whose sides they so thwack<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, and were so liberal of their blows, that the Gyants feeling the weight of them, betook them to their heels, and left their knotty Clubs behind them, to be viewed by the Champions with wonder and admiration, at the strength of those that could wield such massy Weapons; but minding to prosecute the adventure, they followed the Gyants, who were gotten out of sight, and the Champions found themselves at a loss in following them, the mul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiplicity of paths leading each way, making them doubtful which to chuse; at last they resolved each of them to take a several path, and if they met not together at the Cave, then to return each to the same place again. Now it so chanced that as they were going in those paths, each of them to meet with an opposer; and first St. <hi>George</hi> met with one of the Centaurs, being of a terrible shape, and incredible strength, betwixt whom began a most fierce combat, with great Courage and Magnanimity, insomuch as St. <hi>George</hi> was never so put to it in all the battles he had ever fought before; for the Centaur was both nimble and strong, and fought
<pb n="76" facs="tcp:29556:207"/>
with great skill and courage, but St. <hi>George</hi> having with a side blow given him a deep wound on the Ribs, he sent forth such a hideous yell as was like the loud rattle of the drumming wind, or Canons when they disgorge their fiery vomits, and nimbly turn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing him about, fled amain towards the Cave.</p>
                        <p>The Renowned Champion St. <hi>Anthony</hi> of <hi>Italy</hi> had not gone far in his path but he met with one of the Gyants, who came now armed in a Coat of Mail, with a great Bar of Iron on his shoulders, with whom St. <hi>Anthony</hi> encountered with great cou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rage: Nor was the Gyant backwards of his endeavours in ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taining the Conquest, dealing such blows each to other, that who so should have beheld them, would have thought each blow had death attendant on it. This Gyant was of twelve foot height, so that St. <hi>Anthony</hi> with the point of his Sword could hardly reach his Crown, which advantage he supplyed with nimbleness, so that the Gyant spent his blows in vain, and being now weari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed with the weight of his Armour, the Sun also shining in his greatest glory, he sweat so exceedingly, that it entering into his Eyes, he was almost blinded therewith, and endeavouring to wipe it off with his hand, St <hi>Anthony</hi> taking the advantage with a sudden blow cut his hand off by the wrist, whereupon the Gyant yielded himself, and craved mercy.</p>
                        <p>In like manner St. <hi>James</hi> the Noble <hi>Spanish</hi> Champion, as he walked along in his path met with the other Gyant, betwixt whom was fought a most terrible Battle, striking so thick and fast at each other, as if every blow would strive to be for<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

All the while they were at Dinner, melodious Happs and Songs

saluted their Ears, which was breathed forth in such a curious harmony, as charmed their very souls to an extasie. After Din<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner, they fell to dancing, tripping it so nimbly, as if they had been all Air, or some lighter Element. In these delights they wasted about eight or nine days, but the Seven Champions soon grew weary of such pastimes, and desirous to go home to their Native Countries, was minded to take their leaves of the Queen <hi>Mariana,</hi> but Sir <hi>Alexander</hi> and she having concluded their Nup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tials should be celebrated very suddenly, they were with much en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>treaty perswaded to stay until they were over.</p>
                        <p>The prefixed day being come, early that Morning by such time as <hi>Aurora</hi> the blushing Goddess which doth sway the dewy confines of the day and night, began to appear, but both Bride<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>groom and Bride were saluted with most sweet sounding Musick, which being ended, their Ears were accosted with this Epitha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lamium;</p>

                        <p>These Solemnities being over, and the Bridegroom and Bride risen from their Beds, they prepared themselves to go to Church; the Bridegroom was apparelled in a suit of flame coloured Tab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by, to signifie how he burnt in the flames of a chast Love; the Bride was attired all in white, to denote her unspotted Uirgini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty, and Maidenly Modesty. Sir <hi>Alexander</hi> was led by two Dukes Daughters, and the Princess <hi>Mariana</hi> by two of the chief<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>est Barons of the Realm; having her Train born up by four Ladies of Honour: Thus did they walk in great state unto the Temple, where the Priest joyned them together in <hi>Hymens</hi>

Holy Kites, which being done, they returned again in the same order to the Palace, all the way the people showing such great de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>menstrations of joy as was wonderful to behold.</p>
                        <p>To rehearse the great Chear prepared for this Royal Dinner, the Maskings, Revellings, and other costly showes, which were solemnized by the Lords and Ladies, and other Courtiers, would tire the Pen of an industrious Writer. The next day was ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pointed for the Coronation of the Prince <hi>Alexander,</hi> and the Princess <hi>Mariana,</hi> which was performed in great splendour, the multitude of Spectators that came to behold it being so many, that not withstanding great store of Money was thrown about in other str√©ets to divert the people from thronging so thick at the Coronation, yet the people regarded the Money not at all, for the great desire they had to behold their new King.</p>
                        <p>After the usual Ceremonies were ended which appertain to such Solemnities, the Trumpets sounded, and the People with a very loud shout, cryed out, <hi>Long live Alexander and Mariana, King and Queen of Thessaly.</hi> The Knights and Barons to ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour the Solemnity the more, appointed the whose Afternoon to be spent in Iusting and Turneying, wherein was shown very much skill and valour, but above them all Duke <hi>Orsin,</hi> a near <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

And now King <hi>Alexander</hi> being thus solemnly Crowned, was fulfilled that Prophecy which was by the Faiery Queen predicted of him, as you may read in the 14 Chapter of the first Part of this Honour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able History, which contained these words;</p>

                        <p>After some few days passed in Royal Trumphs, the Seven Champions resolved to stay no longer, but to hasten to their own Countries, in pursuance of which their resolution, they acquainted

In the mean time the other villains leaped in, and surrounded him so on every side, that he had no room to wield his Weapon; however, as if he had been a man made all of fire, having a courage that knew not how to fear, he resisted them all, and in a while, (though over-matcht) had sent four of their souls to the <hi>Stygian</hi> Bay; whereof <hi>Lamprido</hi> was the third: Thus for a short space did the Goddess <hi>Victoria</hi> seem favourable to him; and now his man who all this while had done his utmost in defence of his Master, hav<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing grasped one of the Uillains, they chanced both to fall over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>board into the water, when Duke <hi>Ursini</hi> endeavouring to help his man, the other Uillain gave him a mortal Wound on the Head, yet before he fell he tumbled that Uillain also into the wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter, to accompany his fellow, which was no sooner done, but through the loss of so much blood which issued from his Wounds, he fell down in a swound, when at the very instant there came

Whereupon Sir <hi>Guy</hi> set the Trumpet to his mouth, and with a strong breath blew such a blast, as ecchoed in the Air like a peal of Ordinance, when immediately the Gate of its own ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cord flew ope, where stood a Dwarf ready to entertain them, who conducted them into a spacious Hall, which was adorned with many Statues of antick work, and wherein in a huge Frame hung the Picture of <hi>Medea,</hi> how she by letting out <hi>Aesons</hi> old blood, and by infusing new into the room, made him young again.

Knights, my name is <hi>Selindus,</hi> once possessed of the Wealthy Barrony of <hi>Mompelior,</hi> scituate in this Island of <hi>Micomicom,</hi> a place which for the richuefs of the Soyl, and pleasantness of the Scituation, is scarcely parallel'd in all the Country. These fair possessions of mine, left unto me when I was young, soon procured me a Wife, of which yet I had no cause to repent, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing a Lady replenished with all the Ornaments and Endowments of Nature, which might make her in every wise compleat. Hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pily we lived together for some short space of time, when the fruits of her Womb gave us great hopes of more future joyes, but the Fates had decreed otherwise, for upon her delivery, the birth of the Ihfant proved the death of the Parent, and she to bestow a Gem on the Earth, became her self a Pearl in the starry Firmament. What should I say more? I lost a Wife, and gain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed a Daughter, and indeed a Daughter of such super-excellent parts, as might put a cessation of sorrow for the Mother. This Daughter whose name was <hi>Praxida,</hi> did I bring up in all ver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tuous Education, who in short time became the wonder of her Sex, having in her such perfections as did yield subject to admira<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, and as she grew more in years, so did she add more to her perfections, which admirable Endowments attracted to her many adorers, who sued for her favour, amongst whom was one whom she most fancied, whose name was <hi>Euphemius,</hi> a knight of <hi>Placi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>da,</hi> being an Island not far off, under the Queen <hi>Artemia,</hi> who had made him sole Governour thereof.</p>
                        <p>Betwixt this <hi>Euphemius</hi> and my Daughter, unknown to me, had passed a solemn Contract, she belike fearing to disclose it to me, as doubting my consent, his Estate not being answerable to my Revenues, wherefore they got privately Married together. Now it happened not long after, upon some offence against the Queen, <hi>Euphemius</hi> was committed to Prison, and having layn there some few dayes, was brought before the Queen to be exa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mined, who beheld him with great wonder and astonishment, for ind√©ed he was a person of a lovely Countenance, and in whom Dame Nature had done her utmost to the making of him in all parts compleat, which so wounded her heart with an affection to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards him, that instead of his being her Captive, she became his: and in part to manifest the same unto him, she frankly gave him his freedom, and with many kind words entertained him very graciously into her favour; yet could not all this kind<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness

endear her unto him, but the more she shewed love to him on the one side, the more was his hatred to her on the other, and that not so much in respect of his to my Daughter, as the mortal spite he bare to her for his Imprisonment, so that having a sit op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portunity offered him, he fled from the Court, and confederating with some friends, intended to levy War against the Queen.</p>
                        <p>The Queen understanding of his departure, fared like unto a distracted Woman, wringing her hands, and beating on her Ivo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry Breasts, she cast her self upon the ground, tearing the lovely Tresses from her head. Her Ladies comforted her the best wise they could, but that cherisht fire which blindly crept through eve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry Uein of her fluent blood, would suffer her to take no rest; but being at last informed in what place he was, she sent to him this following Letter.</p>

                           <hi>My Lords, I am now taking my last leave of you, the spent Hour-glass of my Life is near at hand, and now at my parting ghost I do adjure ye, as you will answer it before the Higher Pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers, whither I am now going to appear, that ye invest</hi> Euphemius <hi>King when I am dead and gone; and though I doubt not of your performance herein, yet for my more assurance, and that my ghost may quietly rest hereafter; I shall desire you to take an Oath to do it, which if you should fail in the performance, know assuredly you will both wrong your selves and him, him in depriving him of his Crown and your selves of a good King, he being a Prince kind, wise, just and merciful, and only unkind unto me.</hi>
                        </p>
                        <p>The Nobles to satisfie her request, freely took their Oaths to be true to <hi>Euphemius;</hi> and now the Queen being fully satisfied with what was done, willingly yielded up the ghost, whom the Nobles buried in most sumptuous manner; which being done, they sent an Honourable Messenger to <hi>Euphemius,</hi> to certifie him of the Queens death, and how she had bequenthed her Crown to him; which Messenger set forth <hi>Artemia's</hi> love in such pathetical words, as wrought in him a strange alteration, for when he thought upo nher unalterable affection towards him, the constancy of her love, her matchless beauty, rare endowments, and super<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>excellent parts, he began to reflect upon himself, his unkindness

to her, his vile ingratitude, that could wrong her which dyed for love of him. These considerations made him to like where be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore he loathed, and to loath where before he loved; for whereas before he used to give many private visits to my Daughter, pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>testing all constancy and loyalty towards her, now the poyson of hatred entred into his heart against her, as taking her to be the chief obstacle which hindred him from the enjoyment of the Qu√©en, and might be also the same of the Kingdom, if it should be known he were married unto her, wherefore he departed along with the Messenger, never so much as bidding her farewel, or sending any Messenger unto her.</p>
                        <p>The Nobles entertained him very splendidly, and with great solemnity Crowned him King; In the mean time the poor <hi>Prax<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eda</hi> was well near distracted with discontent, finding her self to be with Child, fearing to discover it unto me, and finding such an alteration of love from him; Her case being thus desperate, knowing it impossible to be long concealed, she sent to him this following Letter.</p>

His Armour was blood red, de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>noting terrour to his Enemies, and on his Shield was depensilled a Hawk siezed on a Pigeon, yet hurting it not, the Word was, <hi>True Glory the only prize.</hi> At the sound of the Trumpets (which was by the appointment of two Reverend Iudges) they ran fiercely against each other, breaking their staves with much gallantry, but at the second course <hi>Agelastus</hi> was driven quite from out of the saddle, which disgrace he would have revenged with his sword, but that the Iudges forbid it, it being quite con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary to the order set down.</p>
                        <p>To revenge this disgrace, there entered the Lists a <hi>Laconian</hi> Knight named <hi>Lysander,</hi> riding on a <hi>Barbary</hi> Horse of a cole black, his Armour answerable to the same, representing the dark shades of night, through which yet peeped some stars, as if a comfortable day would ensue: On his Shield was pourtrayed the Goddess <hi>Fortune,</hi> who <hi>Janus</hi> like looked two ways, to denote that nothing in this World is so certain, but that if good went before, as ill might come behind; the word was, <hi>the end Crowns all.</hi> These two encountered each other with such invincible cou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rage, as made the Spectatours to surmize, that the Warlike <hi>Mars,</hi> and invincible <hi>Alcides</hi> were come to try their martial prowess upon Earth, and fighting thus with equal courage a long space, Sir <hi>Alberts</hi> Horse leaning hard upon the other, and win<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing ground, the other Horse f√©eling himself prest, began to rise a little before, as he was wont to do in his Cornet; which ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vantage Sir <hi>Albert,</hi> taking set forward his own Horse with the

At the signal of the Trumpets sounding they set spurs to their Horses, encounter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing each other with such well guided valour and Courage, as showed them each to be a Master of Martial Prowess; but at the third course it was Sir <hi>Alberts</hi> ill fortune to miss his Rest, which he could not recover, before Sir <hi>Selvador</hi> had met him, and by main strength cast him to the ground.</p>
                        <p>The Honour of the day remaining thus to Sir <hi>Selvador,</hi> the approach of night put a period to those Martial exercises for that day, which yet were continued with manly courage and resolu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion for several days after. And now before King <hi>Alexanders</hi> return home to <hi>Thessaly,</hi> the Coronation of <hi>Guy</hi> with his Qu√©en <hi>Urania</hi> was appointed, which was performed with all art and splendour imaginable, which also made good the Prophesie that the Fairy Qu√©en had predicted of him, as we mentioned before in the 14 Chapter of the first part of this History.</p>

                        <p>Sir <hi>David</hi> with tears standing in his Eyes thus answered the Hermit: <hi>Most Reverend Father, we may well be said to come from the Land of</hi> Sorrow, <hi>our excess of grief scarce giving way to the relief of words, such has been our so pinching want of Victuals at Sea, and Death here on land as has deprived me of most of my followers; for coming for succour unto this Island, the</hi>

After congratulations for their happy revival, the Aged Hermit conducted them to his Cell, which was pleasantly seated by a Rivers side, that ran upon so fine and delicate ground, as one could not easily judge whether the River did more wash the Gravel, or the Gravel purifie the River; the Banks on ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>her side were fringed with most beautiful Trees, that resisted the Suns darts from over-much piercing the natural coldness of the River, which ran not forth right, but continually winding, as if it had a delight to play with it self.</p>
                        <p>Here did the old Hermit fetch out what victuals he had, but that nothing suffiring, they killed some Sheep, Goats, and other Beasts, which they dressed in the old mans Cell.

Now from what place these Children came, I am as igno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rant as they themselves, whose tender Age was such as made them incapable of any knowledge, either of Parents or Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>try; yet was I much revived by the Writing, which promised there restoration by an <hi>English</hi> Knight, in which I also hoped my own was included; wherefore ever since I have carefully brought them up, and fostered them in the best manner I could; And now I hope is the time come about, wherein what was promi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed by the Queen of <hi>Chance</hi> will be performed; not doubting but that such magnanimous resolutions as I see seated in your noble breasts, joyned with a just cause, will make you couragi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous to perform the adventure, and to free me from this tedious trouble and thraidom.</p>
                        <p>Sir <hi>David</hi> hearing this story with much admiration, remem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bred how he and his Brothers had freed there Mother from the <hi>Enchanted Castle,</hi> as also of the knight, which told how Sir <hi>Vuylon</hi> had exposed these two Children to the mercy of the Sea, all which he related to the ancient Gentleman, and withal pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mised him his utmost endeavour for finishing the Enchantment, and restoring him again to the Island of <hi>Ancona.</hi>
                        </p>
                        <p>And now was much mirth and joy on all sides: Sir <hi>David</hi> was entertained into the Hermits Cell, together with as many of the prime Commanders as it would sufficiently sustain; the rest of the Soldiers cut down boughs from trees, and therewith made them Hutts to shelter them from the heat of the Sun, when his hot Steeds from their Nostrils vomit flame on the parched Earth: Sheep and Goats they killed abundance, so that there was store of boyling, broyling, frying, roasting, stewing, and other ways of dressing dishes to refresh their Bodies, after their sore and bitter hunger sustained at Sea. This continued for a weeks space together, but then Sir <hi>David</hi> remembring his pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mise made to the Aged Hermit, he buckled on his Armour, and putting himself into his Ship-boat, rowed with two Marriners, and guided by the Old Hermit, he undauntedly landed before the <hi>Inchanted Castle,</hi> and marched directly towards the Gate there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of, whither no sooner he was come, but the Dragon most fiercely issued out, when presently began betwixt them the most fierce encounter that ever was heard of, so that to describe it to the full I want the skill of <hi>Orpheus,</hi> that sweet <hi>Thracian</hi> singer, or the invention of <hi>Homer,</hi> in describing the battles of the <hi>Greeks</hi> and

                        <p>No sooner had they beheld the Castle vanished, but they put forth to land, where Sir <hi>David</hi> on his knees gave thanks to the Immortal Powers for his Uictory, and then going up higher in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to the land, they came to a little Uillage, the Inhabitants whereof were greatly astonished, some of the younger sort there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of

Now you must understand that when we parted from the Seven Champions, as I told you before, we embarked in two Ships, but it chanced that that Ship wherein he was, in the night time, running upon a Rock was split in pieces, most of them perishing in the Sea, only he with some few others getting astride upon the main Mast, by the favourable working of the Sea, were driven on shoar in a small Island near adjoyning, the Inhabitants whereof received them kindly, and furnished them with such necessaries as they wanted.

                        <p>There was growing just by the Chamber window where she lay, a stately Tree, upon which in the dead of the night he used to ascend, and there had parly with his Love: This they conti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nued for some time to their great content and satisfaction; but it so chanced upon a night he was espyed by one of the Servants, who immediately informed his Master thereof, which when he heard, he was so transported with rage, as if all his humours had turned choller, and kindled up in agonies as hot as flames of burning Sulpher; like to the chased Boat whom eager Bounds have at a Bay; and being thus transported with rage, he takes a Cross-bow, and aided with a glimmering light, by Madam <hi>Cynthia</hi> the pale faced Lady of the night, he sent a Bullet into his Belly, which wrought such effect, that tumbling from off the Tree he only said, <hi>my dearest, I dye for love of thee,</hi> and pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sently expired.</p>

                        <p>THE Ualourous and Renowned Champion Sir <hi>David</hi> being now well settled in his kingdom of Ancona, as you heard in the fifteenth Chapter, was very desirous to see Sir <hi>VVonder,</hi> and to experiment the effects of the precious Fountain, as Sir <hi>Pandrasus</hi> had declared unto him; wherefore selecting out a choice number of approved Soldiers, and taking his leave of the Qu√©en <hi>Rosetta,</hi> he took Ship, and having a prosperous Wind, he in few dayes arrived in that fertile Island; but quite contrary to his expectation, instead of being received with great friendship, and acclamation of joy, no sooner was he landed, but a num<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber of Knights and armed Soldiers came marching against him, bidding him either to depart the Land, or to yield up his Arms into their hands, or else to abide what their force could compel him to; for so it was that soon after the departure of Sir <hi>Pan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>drasus;</hi>

that those of the <hi>VVarlike Island,</hi> understanding the rare vertues of the Fountain, and the fruit that grew on the Banks of it, that they resolved to become Masters thereof; and to that purpose in f<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="2 letters">

                        <p>But now was the time of their deliverance come about, for Sir <hi>David</hi> understanding there was no way to be used but force, setting his men in order, gave them such lusty charge, as put them all to the rout, the greatest part of them being slain in the chase; the residue of them that escaped flying to the Fountain, raised all their whole Force, who having arme dthemselves, spee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dily marched against Sir <hi>David;</hi> and now began a most terri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble fight betwixt them, with such a cruel slaughter of Men, that the Earth which was wont to bury the dead, was new its self buried with dead Bodies; the clashing Armour rang the knell of many of those that w<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

And then giving thanks to the Immortal Powers for this great Uictory, they went the next way to the Fountain, and released Sir <hi>VVonder,</hi> and the rest of his men from their Captivity.</p>
                        <p>Great was the joy at this their meeting, for Sir <hi>VVonder,</hi> notwithstanding his vast strenght and invincible Courage, yet was so storngly imprisoned, that he despaired of ever regarding his former liberty, which being so unexpected, made him the highlyer for to prize it. Then did Sir <hi>David</hi> with his Soldiers drink of the Wine of the Fountain, when presently they felt the powerful vertue thereof, being in an instant as fresh and lively, as when they first began the fight.

                        <p>That night they slept soundly, and the next Morning went forth to behold the rarities of the Country. In every place they came they heard the Birds, the Airs winged Choristers, warbling forth their ditties most harmoniously, as if with their chirping they sung Carrols to the rosie Moon, and with their Musick courted the sullen Wood, and invited Mortals to walk abroad. The Earth was beautified with Natuers choicest Tapestry, so that it seemed an <hi>Elizium,</hi> or Earthly Paradise: Here grew Muskmillions, sweet William, Time, Maiden-blush, Peagles, Cowslips, Tulips, Oxlops, Lady-smock, sops in Wine, start up and kiss me, sweet Basil, Marjerum, tufted Daizy, six leaved Primrose, true love, Lillies and Uiolets.

                           <hi>I was then blest with a Beautiful Daughter named</hi> Tremelia, <hi>of whom this Tyrant burned in Lust, who took her from me, pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tending to keep her as a pledge of my fidelity, but having her in his keeping, sought to deflower her, but she resisting his unchaste desires, and giving him some opprobrious words, he in a great</hi>

                           <hi>rage stuck her to the heart with his Dagger. I having notice of what was passed, thought it high time to provide for my self, and daring trust no body, I lay hid for two or three dayes and nights amongst Bushes, Thorns and Brakes, when disguising my self, I went to a village hard by, where I heard of your notable Atchievments in conquering this Island, the Garden of</hi> Ceres, <hi>and Orchard of</hi> Pomona, <hi>hoping according to your former favours to others in distress, that you will afford me some succour in re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dressing my wrongs.</hi>
                        </p>
                        <p>Sir <hi>David</hi> hearing this sad Relation of the ancient Gentleman, was moved to great pity towards him, so that he vowed by the Honour of Knighthood, to which all that bear Arms are sworn unto, either to revenge him of the Tyrant, or to lose his Life in the attempt; and so giving the ancient Gentleman some of the water of the Fountain to drink, and some of the Apples to eat, (which to that purpose they alwayes carried about them) he was so refreshed, as he seemed to forget his former sorrows, and to have new life and vigour inspired into him, as had old <hi>Eson</hi> when the sage <hi>Medea</hi> infused young Blood into his aged Ueins. Next they began to consult which wayes to accomplish this enterprize, for should they take too great a strength along with them, they might endanger the losing of the Island; for well they wist that when the fellows of those who were slain, came to hear of it, they would endeavour not only to revenge their Friends blood, but also if possible to recover again so fruitful an Island; they therefore agr√©ed to send for more succour to Sir <hi>Davids</hi> Country, intending to stay there until their return; but in the mean time this ambitious Tyrant (whose name was <hi>Almantor</hi>) having heard how this Island was conquered by a few persons, and of the rare qualities belonging thereunto, he thought in an instant to surprize it, and to that purpose manned out what force he could make, and with great bravery and ostentation sailed to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards this fruitful Island, having conquered it in conceit before he came thither. Sir <hi>David</hi> s√©eing this Fleet of Ships, which upon a smooth Sea danced Levalto's on the briny Main, not tos<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed by any rage of <hi>Eolus;</hi> he therefore having laid an ambush to surprize them, upon their first landing s√©emed to sly, until he had brought them into the Net prepared for them, when turning head, he gave them such a brisk charge, as gave them a total rout, not sparing any in the chase, but by several wayes of deaths

made passages for their Souls into the other World; so that all the way as they were chased the spectacle was ugly and griefly to behold; here lay Bodies torn in pieces, mangled Limbs cut and hackt in divers manners; so that a man beholding such a sight might say, that War is an e<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

                        <p>The Uictory being thus clearly obtained, and the Soldiers swords glutted in blood; they led <hi>Almantor</hi> towards the Foun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain, where first they refreshed themselves with some of those healing Fruits, and afterwards sat in Iudgment upon him, where was laid to his charge all the Tyrann<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

                        <p>And now did the horrour of a guilty Conscience plainly ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pear in <hi>Almantor,</hi> repenting not so much for his crimes, as ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>claiming against the punishment of them; and yet in that pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nishment might he behold what cruelty he used to others, al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>though the greatest smart to him was to think that he justly de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>served it, whereas they suffered innocently. And now to save his Life what did he not promise, what Protestations use, what Nows, what Oaths, what Asseverations, that he would here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>after use Iustice, mixed with Clemency, not doing nor suffering any wrong to be done by others; that he would deliver up to the ancient Gentleman his former Cstate, and repossess him in all his Inheritance, with many other flattering speeches to move their hearts to be inclinable to pity, but his crimes were of too sanguine a dye to be forgiven, and all his repentance and sorrow only <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

                           <hi>Sad is the choice</hi> (said the wretched <hi>Almantor) chuse which I will: For 1. To be hanged on a Gibbet is to dye the death of a Dog. 2. To be put into a sack and drowned is to be devoured by Fishes, and want decent Burial. 3. To have my Head smitten off, is indeed the death of a Nobleman, but which no Nobleman would willingly have. 4. To be poysoned, is to be a stinking Carcase before I am scarce cold in my Grave. 5. To be burned is of all deaths most cruel. 6. To be stung to death with snakes is a painful lingring death. 7. To be cast down from a high Tower, an uncertain death. What then remains but the last kind of death, to be killed with Arrows, and that is the death of a Soldier, which I shall soonest choose, come then, seeing you think me not fitting to live, quickly dispatch me out of the World.</hi>

                        <p>Then rending open his Doublet, he tyed a Handkerchief before his Eyes, and leaning his Back against a Tr√©e, he cryed out, now <hi>do your worst,</hi> whereupon immediately some Soldiers who were planted on purpose, sent a flight of Arrows into his Breast, so that in an instant he fed down and dyed.

His Armour was milk white, his attiring else all cut in Stars, which made of Cloth of Silver, and Silver Spangles, each way seemed to cast many aspects, In his shield was a sheep feeding in a pleasant Field, with this word, <hi>without fear or envy.</hi> This valiant Knight Sir <hi>Owen</hi> behaved himself so gallantly, and dismounted so many Knights that day, that the Prince <hi>Rosinda</hi> entituled him the mirrour of Chevalry, and pattern of true Magnanimity.</p>
                        <p>After the Justs were finished, the Emperour entertained these nine worthy Knights in most sumptuous manner, spending several days in their company, with great Feasts, Masks, and other stately showes, and in reward of their Martial per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formances, gave unto them 9 most rich precious stones, each of them valued at a Kings Ransom besides other most rich Presents from the Prince and Princess, and so taking their solemn leave of the Emperour and other High Estates then present, with great honour and applause, they returned each to his own Country.</p>
