         <editorialDecl>
            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

having charged the <hi>Engliſh Tilenus</hi> with <hi>making the Try<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers to ask ſuch queſtions of thoſe that come before them, as in all probability never came into all their thoughts to ask,</hi> up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on this his <hi>probable</hi> miſ-de meanour (himſelf making no more of it) he advanceth this <hi>Radamanthine</hi> and ſevere Sentence, both againſt him, and me; <hi>Which</hi> (ſayth he) <hi>Is ſuch a piece of Impudence, as no one hath ventured to imitate him in, but that</hi> Iſhmael <hi>of</hi> Colemanſtreet, <hi>whoſe hand be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing againſt all men, hath provoked all men, even to the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon Pamphleter, to lift up an hand againſt him.</hi> The beſt is, (in caſe Mr. <hi>Hickman</hi>'s reproach here, could, without the help of the Figure <gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap>, be admitted for true) That <hi>Jeremy</hi> of <hi>Jeruſalem</hi> was a man of ſtrife, and a man of contention to the whole Earth, as well as that <hi>Iſhmael</hi> of <hi>Colemanſtreet,</hi> and yet was a true Prophet, and never the leſs like ſo to have been for the numerouſneſs of his Conteſts. <hi>Noah</hi> alſo was a <hi>Preacher of Righteouſneſs,</hi> yet his proportion of Oppoſers in the World, far exceeded mine, and the number of thoſe, who embrace my Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrine with their whole hearts, far exceedeth the number of thoſe, who upon ſuch terms received his. Yea, our Saviour himſelf teſtifieth, that in the Church and Nation of the <hi>Jews,</hi> they who had the more generall approba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion and applauſe, were the falſe Prophets, not the true, <hi>Luk.</hi> 6. 26. <hi>Wo unto them when all men ſhall ſpeak well of them, for ſo did their Fathers to the falſe Prophets.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>But becauſe Mr. <hi>Hickman</hi> judgeth himſelf Orthodox, in charging me with <hi>Impudence:</hi> what if it be found that the Ingredients in the compoſition of his Charge here levied againſt me, and proclaimed as with ſound of Trumpet and Drum in the Ears of the World, be notwithſtanding all Errors, and broad untruths? may he not make a cover<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of ſhame for his own Face of the Accuſation, which he hath here drawn up againſt me? Let us fairly examine the Caſe, and with as much Favour to the Examinate, as he, or his Friends, can reaſonably expect.</p>
            <p>
               <pb facs="tcp:37346:4"/>
Firſt, Whereas he chargeth me with <hi>imitating his Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liſh Tilenus,</hi> is not here a palpable and un-ſcholar-like Jeofail? Did <hi>Shemei</hi> in reviling <hi>David,</hi> when his Condi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion was low and mean in the World, <hi>imitate</hi> Mr. <hi>Hickman,</hi> in reproaching a Miniſter of <hi>Chriſt</hi> being under Hatches, and trampled upon by men; or did not Mr. <hi>Hickman</hi> in this Action rather <hi>imitate</hi> him? He that acteth before another, what ever his Action be, doth not imitate him that followeth him in the ſame kind of acting, but on the contrary, he imitates who follows the Example or Pat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tern that have been ſet before. If there be any ſimilitude between <hi>Tilenus</hi> and me, in our reſpective handling of Mr. <hi>Hickmans Tryers, Tilenus</hi> muſt bear the <hi>Crime</hi> of <hi>I<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitation,</hi> not I, who was before him in what was done by me, relating to thoſe his Clients.</p>
            <p>Secondly, Whereas he chargeth me with <hi>venturing to imitate</hi> Tilenus, <hi>in making the Tryers to ask ſuch Queſtions of thoſe that come before them, as in all probability never came into all their thoughts to ask:</hi> The truth is, that he chargeth me with the Crime of ſuch a Courage, or boldneſs, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of I was never Conſcious. I never made any venture to imitate <hi>Tilenus,</hi> in ſuch an Attempt, as is here charged upon him; nor did I ever go before him in any ſuch. I no where, either challenge them, or charge them, <hi>With asking ſuch queſtions of thoſe that come before them, which in all probability never came into all their thoughts to ask.</hi> If I charge them with asking any queſtions in the Caſe, they are only ſuch, which themſelves and their own Conſci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ences know that they do, or did ask frequently, and from time to time. And for the Queſtions which <hi>Tilenus</hi> him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf maketh them to ask, as far as I remember, if they were not the ſame formally, &amp; <hi>in terminis,</hi> yet they were the ſame materially and in reality of import, which they were wont to ask. And for a man in his own words, to report another mans ſenſe uttered in his, is no ſuch <hi>vente<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rous piece of Impudence:</hi> it is rather a piece of this Calcula<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, ſo to call it. But,</p>
            <p>
               <pb facs="tcp:37346:4"/>
Thirdly, Whereas my Accuſer chargeth me with <hi>ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving my hand againſt all men;</hi> neither is he Orthodox in this, unleſs he takes Sanctuary under the Wing of the good Figure <hi>Synechdoche,</hi> which hath had a priviledge time out of mind, to grant a pardon to men for this Delin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quency in ſpeaking, <hi>viz,</hi> When meaning only ſome, they ſay, all; or, intending only a part, yet mention, or name, the whole. For otherwiſe, Mr. <hi>Hickman</hi> himſelf is (doubtleſs) a man, though (to meaſure him by himſelf, and ſo to pleaſe him, if it may be) one of a thouſand. Yet my hand (certain I am) was never againſt him; no, nor his againſt me, that I know of, untill Mr. <hi>Pierce</hi> of late touched him, where (it ſeems) he was very tender, and hereby provoking his Choler and Scholarſhip together, put him into an Athletick Paſſion: under the fiery and fierce conduct whereof, in his March, his hap was to fall foul upon me, and ſo it fell to my ſhare alſo to feel, as well as others, the weight of his learned Faculty in re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proaching. But it is a good ſign on the Truths ſide, when her Enemies retreat, and flee to their Patheticals. For this argues that their Intellectuals fall ſhort, and that their heart ſerveth them not to confide in them any further. Yet I cannot but mention this by the way, as matter of ſad conſideration, although of too too frequent occurrency; that men, who have competent Gifts and Parts of Wit and Learning, whereby they might ſerve their Genera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, and be uſefull unto many, yet ſuffering themſelves to be over-grown with a Conceit, that theſe Gifts and Parts are far greater then they are, they hereby ſtifle their Opportunity, and give Hoſtages unto ſin, and <hi>Satan,</hi> that they will never do any great matters againſt them. Such a Conceit as this, is a dead Fly in their Oyntment, cau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing it to caſt forth a ſtinking ſavour, and betrayeth them into many, and ſometimes into ſad, inconveniencies. But to return to Mr. <hi>Hickman;</hi> although the Figure <hi>Synech<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>doche</hi> interpoſeth with the beſt of her Authority for the ſalvage of his, both Credit, and Conſcience, in charging
<pb facs="tcp:37346:5"/>
me with the <hi>being of my hand againſt all men;</hi> yet this Fi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gure will prove but a Cypher unto him for any ſuch Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vice, if his words in the Charge be but ſtrictly interpre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted. For in true Conſtruction and propriety of ſpeech, his hand is with men, and for men, not againſt them, which i<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

               </gap>ny other ſenſe, then this. Nor is my ſevere Accuſer able (I believe) to prove the contrary: However, though I am no great Lawyer, yet (me-thinks) Charges and Accuſations againſt men ſhould be of little value, or force, which cannot be verified, or made good, but by the favour of Figures. Yet,</p>
            <p>Fourthly, (and laſtly, for this) the remaining Article of his Charge [Viz. <hi>That I have provoked all men, even to the common Pamphleter, to lift up an hand againſt me]</hi> will keep him out of new <hi>Jeruſalem</hi> alſo, without the media<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of the ſayd Figure, <hi>Senechdoche.</hi> See <hi>Revel.</hi> 21. 27. and <hi>Revel.</hi> 22. 15. I know it would be offenſive to the Gentleman, if I ſhould relate how many Letters, and Meſſages otherwiſe, of thankfull acknowledgments of the Grace of God given unto me, for the clearing of thoſe Doctrines, of Election, Reprobation<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> &amp;c. and of Chriſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>an Encouragements, to proceed in my way, &amp;c, I have received time after time, from ſeverall perſons of conſide<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rable wo th, for Godlineſs, and Knowledge, inhabiting in ſeveral parts of the Nation, ſome of them Miniſters of the <hi>Goſpel,</hi> and others of them Studients in the Univerſity of good ſtanding, &amp;c. But becauſe ſuch a ſtory as this, would (I preſume) be a heavy burthen to a tender and weak ſhoulder, I ſhall forbear it. In the mean time, Mr. <hi>Hickman</hi> muſt give me leave to tell him, and all the Wo ld this plain ſtory, <hi>Viz,</hi> That I know certainly, in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>f<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

               <hi>hand hath provoked all men even to the common Pamphleter,</hi> &amp;c. He is an <hi>Athenian,</hi> and ſeems to have ſome ſympa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thy in blood with him, that <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

               </gap>ayd claim to all the Ships that came into <hi>Pireus,</hi> as his own. But he may know, if he pleaſe, that there are ſeven thouſand (and ſeven thou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſand more to them twice told) amongſt the <hi>Iſrael</hi> of God in this Nation, who either never bowed the Knee of their Judgment, to the bloody <hi>Molech</hi> of his Reproba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, nor, to any of his Confederates, or elſe have repen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted of that ſuperſtitious and unadviſed Homage. But what emphaticall reach, or Deſign he ſhould have in men<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tioning the poor <hi>Common Pamphleter</hi> diſparaging-wiſe (as it is evident enough that he doth) and yet make him one of the Retinue of thoſe, whom I have <hi>provoked to lift up their hands againſt me,</hi> I verily underſtand not<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> Doth he pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent him as an <hi>Index,</hi> or <hi>Significator</hi> of the manners, quali<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty, or condition of the whole Retinue? Would he have an Eſtimate made by him, who, or what ſort and kind of perſons they are, whom I have ſo provoked, as to move them to lift up their hand againſt me? Or is it his mind, in ſingling him out from his Company, and ſhewing him perſonally and particularly, to ſay unto his Reader, <hi>Cri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mine ab uno Diſce omnes;</hi> i. <hi>Know this vile perſons and know all the reſt.</hi> I can hardly think that he ſhould underſtand himſelf no better, then thus to prevaricate with his Inte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reſt and Cauſe, and to aſſociate himſelf, and his beſt-reſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cted Friends with the <hi>Common Pamphleter.</hi> And yet I am to ſeek what other Treaſure he ſhould think to make of him here. However, there is ſomewhat in the old Saying;
<q>
                  <l>Noſcitur ex comite, qui non dignoſcitur ex ſe.</l>
               </q>

            <p>Mens Wayes and Manners when they hidden lye, Are oft betrayed by their Company.</p>
            <p>
               <pb facs="tcp:37346:6"/>
If thoſe whom I have <hi>provoked,</hi> make one <hi>Genius</hi> with the <hi>Common Pamphleter, Res mea eſt in vado,</hi> I am in no danger of juſt blame for doing that, by which they have been provoked. For that Saying of <hi>Seneca</hi> will at this turn guard me round about: <hi>Recti argumentum eſt, peſſimis diſplicere.</hi> The worſt men are commonly moſt diſpleaſed with that which is beſt. And thus we ſee with how great weakneſs, and unworthyneſs, Mr. <hi>Hickman</hi> hath quitted himſelf in levying the ſore Charge mentioned, againſt a perſon, that never did him, nor thought him the leaſt harm.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>But in the Paſſage now examined, he hath only Chaſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zed me with his Rods: elſewhere he makes a Scourge for my Back of Scorpions. For thus my Tranſcription repor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teth him.</hi> And indeed a ſpirit of moſt Childiſh Inſultation ſeems to have poſſeſſed as many as have lift up an Engliſh Pen againſt the Orthodox in this Quinquarticular Controverſie. I'le inſtance only in Mr. <hi>John Goodwin,</hi> who in the Preface of his <hi>Triumviri,</hi> ſayth, That he hath not met with any thing in the Writings of any, or of all the three men conteſting with him, which had in the leaſt ſhaken his Confidence concerning the truth of the things by him aſſerted, or that for the leaſt ſpace of time put him to any ſtond, or loſs in his underſtanding concern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing them, or to ſeek what to anſwer to any thing they offer or ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject againſt any of them. Which Lines the greateſt Charity muſt look upon as ſo much vapouring Rhetorick dropt from his Pen in the abſence of Judgment and Conſcience, or as an Eſſay of the <hi>Spartans</hi> Valour, who being ſtruck down by a mortall blow, uſed to ſtop their mouthes with earth, that they might not be heard to quetch, or groan, thereby to affright their Fel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lows, or animate their Enemies. <hi>Here is work enough for all day: But,</hi>
            </p>
            <p n="1">1. I perceive the truth of the old Saying is not yet out of date;</p>
            <lg>
               <l>Obſequium amicos, veritas odium parit.</l>
               <l>Comply, and Friends thou ſhalt create,</l>

I perceive, if inſtead of ſpeaking the truth in the Paſſage cited by Mr. <hi>Hickman,</hi> I ſhould have comported with him in his ſenſe and notion, and have ſayd that the three men had given my confidence a Mortall wound, and had obje<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cted ſuch things againſt my Tenents, which put me to a ſtand, and that I knew not which way to turn me for an Anſwer unto them, or the like, this might have purchaſed me the right hand of his Fellowſhip, and have reſtored me to the Synagogue of the <hi>Orthodox,</hi> out of which I was caſt long ſince, and have remained an Out-caſt ſeverall years. When the Lord <hi>Chriſt</hi> had ſaid unto the <hi>Jews,</hi> that <hi>God was his Father,</hi> and <hi>that he knew him,</hi> which they did not, this Saying (as it ſeems) was ill reſented by them, their deſire being that he ſhould unſay it, and that he ſhould not aſſume unto himſelf, any other, or any more knowledge of God, then what they had. <hi>If I ſhould ſay,</hi> (ſayth Chriſt) <hi>I know him not, I ſhould be a Lyar like unto you: But I know him,</hi> &amp;c. John 8. 55. If I ſhould have ſayd, that I met with that in the Writings of the three men, of whom Mr. <hi>Hickman</hi> ſpeaks, which did <hi>put me to a ſtand,</hi> &amp;c. I ſhould herewith have pleaſed him, becauſe in ſo ſaying, I ſhould have complyed with him, and made my ſelf like unto him. But,</p>
            <p n="2">2. Mr. <hi>Hickman</hi> Arraigning me for the High Miſdemea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour of ſpeaking untruth, (for his charging me to have written, as I did, <hi>in the abſence of Judgment and Conſcience,</hi> amounteth to no leſs) he ſhould have done well to ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerve the due proceſs of Law and Reaſon, and firſt have made ſubſtantiall proof of the Crime, or matter of Fact objected, before he had proceeded to a ſentence of Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demnation; and have produced ſome Argument, or Ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jection, one, or more, out of the W itings of ſome of the three men, which he ſhould ſubſtantially prove did <hi>put me to a ſtond or loſs in my underſtanding what to anſwer.</hi> If he could name any ſuch Argument, or Ob<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

<pb facs="tcp:37346:7"/>
which did <hi>put me to a ſtond,</hi> &amp;c.) this would not juſtifie him, unleſs he could give a ſufficient account of ſuch his knowledge unto others. For the Rule is; <hi>Non eſſe, &amp; non apparere, aquiparantur in jure:</hi> That which is not, and that which appears not, are of the ſame conſideration in Law. And yet I judge it an eaſie matter for him to give an account of all the knowledge he hath in this kind. But the Law of Conſcience and Chriſtianity, forbids the ſacri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficing of any mans Reputation, at the loudeſt inſtance of Probabilities, or Conjectures; at leaſt or ſuch, which have no more weight, or reaſon in them, then thoſe, upon which Mr. <hi>Hickman</hi> hath offered up mine upon the Service, whether of his pleaſure, or diſpleaſure. But if either he, or any of his Colleagues in Judgment, could, and would be pleaſed, to afford me the inter-view of any ſuch Argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, or Objection, againſt my Tenents (by-named Er<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>roneous) whether out of the Writings of ſome of the three men, or out of their own Treaſuries, or out of the abundance of any of their Judgment, which would <hi>put me to ſuch a ſtond,</hi> that I ſhould not remove, or to ſuch <hi>a loſs in my underſtanding,</hi> that I could never recover, or repaire, they would be the beſt Benefactors unto me in the good things of this World, that I have met with theſe many years; eſpecially they would have been ſuch unto me, had they be-friended me in that kind heretofore, whilſt, and when, I was more capable of the Courteſies and Bene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>factures of the World, then now I am, expecting daily to remove into that Climate, where the Sun-ſhine of this world hath no warming, or cheering influence at all. For certain I am, that thoſe Tenents, from under the Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcience whereof I might well have been delivered by the means ſpecified, have divided between the world, and me, and kept many the good things thereof from me, by reaſon of their inſupportableneſs unto the greater part of men, and more eſpecially unto the great men in the ſtate of my ſojourning, and to thoſe, who by their con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent (yea, they love to have it ſo) exerciſe Dominion

over their Faith, under the importune claim of being <hi>Or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thodox,</hi> and ſound in their Judgments from the one end of them even unto the other, in matters appertaining unto God. I have neither any diſpoſition within, nor occaſion without, to turn Plaintiff againſt the World; a man with a competency of wiſdome may very well be content with my portion in it. For my good God, <hi>(Etiam in vitâ mun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>di Minerva)</hi> hath fed me, and mine, with food conve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nient, yea, and cloathed and harboured us accordingly. And the truth is, that for things greater then theſe, it is beſt receiving them at the Reſurrection. Or,</p>

If it be not matter of untruth (in my words of his angry Obſervation lately mentioned) wherewith, and for which, my Accuſer intended to humble me, but rather the ſubject matter, or inward thought, imported in the words, as that I ſhould arrogate unto my ſelf an attain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment ſo incredible and rare, as not <hi>to be put to a ſtond,</hi> or be <hi>at a loſs in my underſtanding,</hi> what to anſwer to any thing I had met with in any the Writings of the three men; if this (I ſay) be the Sword that paſſed through the Soul of my Accuſer, and be apprehended by him ſo highly Crimi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nall, as to deſerve that heaped meaſure of Indignation, which he hath troubled his Learning to pour upon it, I ſhall, for the compoſure of his Spirit, and for the diſſol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving of the unhappy appearance of ſo much guilt, where none was, adminiſter unto him that well-approved Doſis of <hi>Auguſtine; Non eſt arrogantia, ſed <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

And the truth is that God hath ſo bleſſed me in the labour and travail of my Soul, about thoſe great Points of Election, Reprobation, the Intent, or Extent of the death of <hi>Chriſt,</hi> &amp;c. wherein I have with ſome diligence, and with no leſs integrity and ſimplicity of heart, exerciſed my ſelf for ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verall years paſt, that before the coming forth of any thing Printed by the three men againſt me, I was Maſter
<pb facs="tcp:37346:8"/>
of ſuch Principles and Grounds, partly from the light of Nature, and common Impreſſions found in the Hearts and Conſciences of all men concerning God, partly from the Writings of learned and worthy men, as well of the Contra-remonſtrant party, as <hi>Calvin, Beza, Muſculus,</hi> &amp;c. as the Remonſtrant, but chiefly from the Sriptures, by which I was able to give my ſelf preſent ſatisfaction, about any thing I met with objected in my way by any of thoſe three men. And I partly believe that Mr. <hi>Hickman</hi> him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf, though but a young man (comparatively) yet con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiveth of himſelf at not much a lower rate, then to be able without much ſtudy to maintain the peace of his pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent Judgment, againſt all the Attempts, that either I in any of my Writings, or any other of my Judgment, in theirs, have made upon him to diſturb him. However if he ſhould make a Declaration, or profeſſion of ſuch a Te<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nor, or Import, I judging him to be a man of Conſcience, and ſober minded, ſhould not reflect upon him (nor do <hi>I</hi> judge it my duty ſo to do) as a man ſpeaking that which was not, nor yet conclude him to be a man of a lofty, and confident, arrogating, or ſelf-willed Spirit; much leſs ſhould <hi>I</hi> arraign him openly as a perſon guilty of ſuch miſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demeanours. I confeſs it is very incident to men to a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bound in their own ſenſe to ſuch a degree, as to preſume that they want nothing wherwith to anſwer any man that ſhall oppoſe it. Indeed if he ſhould declare, or profeſs, after this manner, or the like, <hi>Viz,</hi> That he is reſolved, whatſoever hath been written, or whatſoever ſhall be writ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten by any man, or men whatſoever, yea, or whatſoever can be written, in oppoſition to his preſent Judgment in thoſe Points, that yet he will ſtand by this Judgment un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to death, this <hi>(I</hi> confeſs) would put me into thoughts of another nature concerning him. But <hi>I</hi> have not put him to the trouble of any ſuch conſideration as this about me, my Profeſſion, with which notwithſtanding he vex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth his impatient Soul, being of a far different Spirit.

Intending only an Epitome, or Summary Compriſall, of the more materiall Points, or Difficulties relating unto the Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject we ſpeak of; we had no opportunity to inſiſt upon any particular at large. That which was chiefly projected and deſired by this little Piece, was to make diligent and narrow ſearch after the different co-operations of thoſe numerous Cauſes, which God hath judgded meet to imploy (ordinarily) according to their reſpective Natures and Capacities of acting, in, and about the inveſting of a Sinner with that great Bleſſedneſs of Juſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fication, which he hath contrived and provided for him. That knowledge in Matters of Religion, which is ſo commonly preſum'd to be in Profeſſors of this Age, above the former, is rather a Bulk, then a Body of Knowledge: and though it commonly paſſeth under the name of Knowledge, yet in propriety of ſpeaking it is not ſo, but rather a confident perſwaſion, or belief that things are ſo, or ſo, as they apprehend them to be. Which belief, though it anſwers the reality and being of that which is believed, &amp; ſo as it were by accident, be true, yet it is not knowledge, nor doth it argue Knowledge, unleſs the Believer underſtands the Reaſon of what he
<pb facs="tcp:37346:11"/>
thus believeth, or at leaſt, a ſubſtantiall Ground why he thus believeth it. Yea, in all matters of doubtfull Diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>putation from the Scriptures; for men to pretend, or alledge the Scriptures as a Reaſon, or Ground of what they believe, ſignifieth little, unleſs they ſhould give a good and ſubſtantiall Reaſon to prove that to be the true Senſe and meaning of the Scriptures, which muſt Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tenance and confirm their Opinion for truth againſt their Adverſary.

Will, or a willingneſs, that ſuch a thing, as the juſtification of a Sinner, ſhould be. 2. Contrivance. 3. Authority. 4 Aſſiſtance, or help for actuall attainment.</p>
            <p>Firſt, There was no neceſſity either of Juſtice, or E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quity, much leſs of Conſtraint, lying upon God, ever to
<pb facs="tcp:37346:13"/>
permit ſuch a thing, as the Juſtification of a Sinner, to be, or ſuch a ſtate, to be ſo much as once heard, or thought of in the world: Therefore he being at liberty in this caſe, whether he would cauſe the Juſtification of a Creature that had ſinned, to be numbred either amongſt the things that are, or amongſt the things that are not, and there be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing none but he, or without him, able to Umpire, or de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>termine this great Affair; Evident it is, that he gave his Conſent unto it, and that without his contribution of Will and good pleaſure towards the being of it, it never had had being but in his own underſtanding only, where the World of pure Poſſibles, and Things that might have been, but never actually ſhall be, as well as the World of Things that are, and of things that ſhall be, is ſ<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>ituated.</p>
            <p>Secondly, God contributes to the ſaid happy effect of the Sinners Juſtification, contrivement alſo; and this 1. In reſpect of the nature or form of the thing it ſelf. 2. Of ſuch things, or means, which render it fecible or produ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cible with the ſalvage of his own honour, as well in point of Wiſdome, as of Juſtice. 3. And laſtly, In reſpect of ſuch means by which it may be actually attained by the Sinner.</p>
            <p n="1">1. The nature, or form of that Juſtification we ſpeak of, conſiſts in remiſſion of ſins (as is more largely pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved in the ſequel of the diſcourſe) and this by divine con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trivement and diſpoſure only.</p>
            <p n="2">2. God projecteth the method, means, and carriage of all things requiſite for the orderly and regular fecible<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs, or producibility of it; As, That his only begotten Son ſhould take fleſh of a Virgin, and become man; That he ſhould take upon him the form of a Servant; That he ſhould be delivered up, or left unto the wills of ſinfull, wicked, and malicious men, and ſo be obnoxious to ſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fer an ignominious and painfull death; That having ſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fered death, he ſhould lye three Dayes and three Nights in the Grave, and then riſe again (to omit ſeverall other particulars in this kind) without which, could, or ſhould
<pb facs="tcp:37346:13"/>
it be ſuppoſed, that he would, or might have juſtified a ſinner; it would, or muſt have been without ſuch a De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>claration, or manifeſtation, at leaſt, of the Glory both of his Juſtice and Wiſdome therein, as with which he hath now contrived it by the method and means ſpecified.</p>
            <p n="3">3. And laſtly, God hath projected likewiſe (and this with an eye too, to the glory of both thoſe Attributes now mentioned) the way, and means how the ſinner may come to intereſs himſelf in the bleſſed Eſtate of this Juſtification; as, <hi>Viz.</hi> By hearing the Goſpel preached, the Counſell of God concerning his Juſtification opened, by underſtanding, conſidering, and believing it, with a ſound and living Faith, and ſuch which is operative by love. The Scripture gives a loud and diſtinct ſound of all theſe things, and ſomewhat further of them hereafter.</p>
            <p>Thirdly, God contributeth yet further towards the ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtification of a ſinner, by his Soveraign Authority: For by means hereof, that Law, or Decree, according to the Tenor, and by vertue of which, the ſinner is juſtified (of which ſomewhat more preſently) becomes inviolable, uncontrollable, and not lyable to any over-rulement, or nullification, by any power or Authority whatſoever: according to that of the Apoſtle <hi>Paul; It is God that juſtifieth: who is he that condemneth? Rom.</hi> 8. 33. Meaning, that there is no perſon, or creature whatſoever, that hath any authority or power to recind, or make invalid that Act, or rather, that Law of God, wherein, and according unto which he juſtifieth a ſinner, which nevertheleſs might be done, and ſo the juſtification of the believing ſinner fall to the ground, and his perſon, notwithſtanding his juſtifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cation by God, be lyable to condemnation, if the Autho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity of God, by which he is juſtified, were ſubordinate, and not ſoveraign, or ſupream.</p>
            <p n="4">4. And laſtly, God contributeth towards the juſtifica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of a ſinner, <hi>In actu excercito,</hi> that reall help and aſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtance by his Spirit, in conjunction with other means of <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

The death of a Perſon of that tranſcendent worth and dignity, was in true e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſteem, and ſo judged by the un-erring underſtanding and wiſdome of God, a valuable and equitable conſideration, why he ſhould actually, and without any other thing in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tervening, pardon the <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>in of the world (as it is called, <hi>Joh.</hi> 1. 29.) that is, the ſin of <hi>Adam,</hi> as imputed, or commu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nicated in the guilt of it, unto all his Poſterity, together with all the actuall ſins of all ſuch of his Poſterity as ſhould believe in him. To ſay that Chriſt by his ſuffer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings merited either the juſtification, or ſalvation, of thoſe who ſhould believe in him, as it is no Scripture expreſſion, ſo neither is it exegeticall, or explicative of any Scripture expreſſion, nor (as far as at preſent my memory ſerveth me) expreſſive of any Scripture notion: and however, it is too narrow and ſcant an expreſſion of that Grace of of God in the death of <hi>Chriſt,</hi> herein commended by him both unto men and Angels; unleſs we ſhall exclude from this Grace all Infants dying in Infancy, or before they are arriv'd at a capacity of believing. And as it is not ſo proper to ſay, that the blood of Bulls and Goats, &amp;c. under the Law merited thoſe Leviticall purgations, or ſanctifications, which yet they who were ceremonially unclean, obtained by them; as to ſay, that they were a competent and ſufficient ſatisfaction, and ſo eſteemed by God, for ſuch uncleanneſſes, and ſo diſſolved the guilt contracted by them; In like manner, it is more agreea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble to Scripture, both notion, and phraſe, and to the na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture of the thing it ſelf, to ſay, that <hi>Chriſt,</hi> in, or by his death, being ſo highly conſiderable, as it was, made, or gave, ſatisfaction for the ſins of men, and hereby made way for the pardon and remiſſion of them by God, then to ſay, that by his death he merited the pardon of theſe ſins, or the juſtification of a ſinner. For, in propriety of ſpeech, a perſon is not ſayd to merit any thing for another, but for himſelf only. When a man hath unjuſtly taken away any thing from another, or hath any way injured him, his
<pb n="10" facs="tcp:37346:17"/>
friend, by giving a reaſonable, or valuable conſideration to the perſon injured for the damage ſuſtained by him, may properly be ſayd to make ſatisfaction for him, or for the wrong done by him; by reaſon whereof he is in e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quity free from being impleaded, or moleſ<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>ed by Law, or otherwiſe, by him, to whom he had done the wrong. But it is ſomewhat improper to ſay, that a man in this caſe by making ſatisfaction for his friend, merited that freedome for him. So when a man gives a price, or ſumm of mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ney, for the ranſome of a Captive, it is not uſuall nor proper to ſay, that hereby he meriteth his liberty. A man is very unproperly ſayd to merit that which he purchaſeth at a price, whether for himſelf, or for another. Now that which <hi>Chriſt</hi> in, or by his death contributeth to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards the juſtification of a ſinner, is frequently in the Scriptures expreſſed under the notion of a purchaſe, of a price payed, of a ranſome, redemption, &amp;c. but no where, of merit.—<hi>And yee are not your own: for yee are bought with a price</hi> [meaning, out of the hand and power, and from under the guilt, of ſin, by the blood of Jeſus Chriſt, whoſe therefore you are by right of purchaſe, to honour and ſerve him.] 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 6. 20. See alſo the following Chap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter, <hi>v</hi> 23. with 2 <hi>Pet.</hi> 2. 1. So <hi>Mat</hi> 20. 28. and <hi>Mar.</hi> 10. 45.—<hi>And to give his life a ranſome for many.</hi> So again, <hi>Who gave himſelf a ranſome for all men,</hi> 1 <hi>Tim.</hi> 26.

And beſides, I do not ſee any reaſon why it may not be as tru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, and properly ſayd, that God the Father, in giving his only begotten Son out of his boſome, to dye for the ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtification of men (and ſalvation thereupon) contributed by way of merit, towards their juſtification and ſalvation, as <hi>Chriſt</hi> by dying. And verily, why that Act of God the Father ſhould not be reputed every whit as great in point of merit, in reference to the great buſineſs of juſtifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cation,
<pb n="11" facs="tcp:37346:17"/>
as the Act of <hi>Chriſt</hi> in offering up of himſelf by death in order thereunto, I apprehend not. Certain I am, that the Scripture commendeth and ſetteth it forth, upon the ſame, o<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap> as great, terms of grace, honour, and admira<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, as the other, <hi>Joh.</hi> 3, 16 <hi>Rom.</hi> 8. 31, 32. <hi>Rom.</hi> 5. 8. (To o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mit other places of like import.) Now of the two it is (I conceive) leſs probable, and Goſpel-like, that the reſpective contributions of the Father, and the Son, to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards juſtification, ſhould be of the one and the ſame kind, then of a different. Yet of the ſame kind they would be, if both ſhould contribute thereunto by way of merit. Nor do I ſee how any clear place will be left for praiſe and thanks unto God the Father from perſons juſtified, for their juſtification, in caſe it may be ſayd, that <hi>Chriſt</hi> properly merited their juſtification. For to render or give unto a perſon, only that which in rigour, or ſtrict<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs of juſtice, either himſelf, or another hath merited, or deſerved for him, eſpecially where no occaſion, or tenta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion is in the way to perſwade him to do otherwiſe, is ſcarce any matter of praiſe to him that doth it, nor of en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gagement unto thankfulneſs upon him, who receiveth only his own in ſuch a caſe.

               </gap>e conſideration upon a valuable price payd for that which is bought, or purchaſed. If a friend layes down a ſumm of money for the purchaſe, of procurement of my liberty, and this fully commenſurable therewith, and ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to agreement with him, of whom he is to pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chaſe it, I am thus far, or in this reſpect no great Debtor of thanks unto him, who ſets me at liberty upon ſuch terms.

be a ſignall Debtor unto him for my liberty, if he ſhal ſo far commiſerate my miſery, as to move any of his Friends, or Relations, to ſtand by me in this my great Exigent, and to do, or ſuffer that for the procurement of my liberty, upon which he can, and will willingly grant it, and eſpecially he being no wayes engaged unto me by any ſervice done by me, or courteſie received from me.</p>
            <p>Now this is the caſe between God the Father, and men, in the gracious buſineſs of juſtification. Firſt, He was at full liberty, men having ſinned, whether ever to have juſtified any perſon, or not, on what terms ſoever. Secondly, Being by nature infinitely prudent and juſt, he could not judge it meet for him, in caſe he ſhould be willing, or inclinable to juſtifie men, to do it, otherwiſe then upon terms every wayes becoming thoſe his Attri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>butes. Thirdly, Such terms as theſe were not to be pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cured, or had, but only from <hi>Jeſus Chriſt,</hi> and him volun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tarily ſubmitting himſelf unto death for this end. Fourth<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, (and laſtly) <hi>Jeſus Chriſt,</hi> though willing both to do, and to ſuffer, what ever he did in either kind, for the juſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fication of men; yet would not have undertaken the bu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſineſs, nor actually either done, or ſuffered, any thing in order to their juſtification, had not the Father been wil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling to part with him, yea, and actually ſent him into the world with order and commiſſion from himſelf, both to do, and ſuffer, whatſoever ſhould be requiſite on his part thereunto, <hi>Joh.</hi> 3. 16. &amp; 12. 10. 18. 12. 44, 45. 49.

            <p>I anſwer 1. (to the former of theſe demands) in caſe any, or all, the Captives mentioned, ſhould be ſo deſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rately careleſs of their own welfare, as not to accept of their deliverance upon thoſe equitable and eaſie terms, on which it is offered them, and may be enjoyed by them, their Benefactor may notwithſtanding have conſideration for his money, ſatisfactory unto him, as <hi>viz.</hi> both the conſcience and honour of his moſt worthy, and heroick Act, in ſparing no coſt to being men out of miſery and th<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

Nor doth the Scripture any where ſuſpend the glorious and high contentment which God takes in that tranſcendent Act of his Grace in the gift of his Son for the redemption of the world, upon the Faith of thoſe who believe on him by means thereof, or upon the great benefit, which by means of their Faith, they actually re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive from it, but upon the intrinſecall and divine worth and adorableneſs of the Act it ſelf. Yea, the Scripture ſeems to make that great Act of Grace we ſpeak of, of one and the ſame conſideration, or contentment unto<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> God, whethermen reap benefit by it, or no. <hi>For we are unto God</hi> (ſayth the Apoſtle, 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 2. 15.) <hi>the ſweet ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vour of Chriſt, in them that are ſaved, and in them that pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riſh.</hi> So that <hi>Chriſt, i.</hi> His Grace vouchſafed unto the world by <hi>Chriſt,</hi> for their ſalvation, is of the ſame, or like <hi>ſavour [ſweet,</hi> and pleaſing] unto God, whether men

accept it (and ſo are ſaved by it) or whether they reject it, and periſh notwithſtanding it. It is true, upon ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther account God is highly oftended with men<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> when they reject his Grace; as <hi>viz.</hi> Becauſe herein they act moſt fooliſhly, and irrationally, not becauſe they dimi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſh, or make any breach, upon his contentment in vouch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſafing ſuch Grace unto them.</p>
            <p n="2">2. To the latter demand, whether it would not argue want of wiſdome, or providence, &amp;c. I anſwer;</p>
            <p n="1">1. That it argues neither want of wiſdome, or provi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence, in him that ſhall part with a great ſumm of money for the ranſome of many thouſand Captives, although he ſhould know before-hand that the greater part would be never the better for it, nor accept of their freedome upon the terms impoſed on them, in order thereunto, in caſe it be ſuppoſed that he knew that a conſiderable part of them (however) would accept of the favour, to the un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpeakable benefit of their enlargement. Yea (as was lately argued) though he had fore-known that none of them would have accepted their liberty upon the terms required of them, yet had the honour, reputation, and conſcience of ſuch an Act, been a reaſonable compenſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion for the money diſburſed. But</p>
            <p n="2">2. Such a demand as this is unproper to the caſe in hand. For it cannot be truly ſayd, that God fore-knew, or foreſaw that the greater part of men would reject his Grace in Chriſt, and ſo periſh this notwithſtanding, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore this Grace was given unto them at leaſt in his un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>changable counſell, purpoſe, and decree. For his Decree of ſending, or giving <hi>Chriſt</hi> for the tanſome of the world, was from before the world began, I mean, from eternity: and conſequently there could nothing precede, or be be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore it, eſpecially in order of time, it being a Rule of un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>queſtionable truth, that <hi>In aeternis non eſt prius, aut poſterius.</hi> But,</p>
            <p n="2">2. To the firſt Objection, or Demand, I anſwer further; That Gods purpoſe, o<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

               </gap> deſign in the death of <hi>Chriſt,</hi> was
<pb n="17" facs="tcp:37346:20"/>
not ſimply, or abſolutely, either to juſtifie, or ſave, men by it, neither did he judge it agreeable to his wiſdome and righteouſneſs ſo to do; but to do both the one, and the other conditionally, and upon terms ſuch as he judged meet to preſcribe and impoſe upon them for the obtain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of theſe great priviledges and bleſſings by it. <hi>So God loved the World</hi> (ſayth our Saviour himſelf) <hi>that he gave his only begotten Son,</hi> [not, that all men, or that any man, ſimply and without any more ado] but, <hi>that whoſoever believeth in him, ſhould not periſh, but have everlaſting life,</hi> Joh. 3. 16. Now the Collation, Application, or actuall beſtowing of the fruits, or benefits of the death of Chriſt, not depending ſo much upon the intrinſecall worth, value, or ſatisfactorineſs thereof, as upon the will and pleaſure of him, who voluntarily gave him to dye for the juſtifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cation, and ſalvation of men, and conſequently had a right of liberty to make the terms for the collation of theſe benefits, what he pleaſed, he cannot with any co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lour of reaſon be deemed unjuſt, in caſe he denies them unto thoſe, who refuſe, or neglect to perform his terms, notwithſtanding they were by Chriſt purchaſed for them; that is, with a full and clear intent on his part, that they ſhould have poſſeſſed and enjoyed them, upon their be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieving. So that,</p>
            <p n="3">3<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> (And laſtly, for this) When God conſtraineth thoſe who belive not, to pay their own Debts, and to make ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tisfaction themſelves for their ſins, by being eternally pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſhed, he cannot be ſayd to require, or take a double ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tisfaction, or two ſatisfactions, for one and the ſame debt, although it be true in a ſenſe <hi>(viz.</hi> that lately declared) That <hi>Chriſt</hi> ſatisfied for them. For that ſatisfaction which <hi>Chriſt</hi> made for the ſins of any perſon who believes not (I mean, who dies in unbelief) was never received, or accepted, by God in the nature of an appropriate, parti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cular, or actuall ſatisfaction for their ſins; but only as a potentiall ſatisfaction; that is, as a thing of compleat worth, and value, enough to have made a particular and
<pb n="18" facs="tcp:37346:21"/>
actuall ſatisfaction even for ſuch a mans ſins, as <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>ell as for the ſins of thoſe who believe, and which he as fully intended to accept for ſuch a ſatisfaction on his behalf, in caſe he had believed, which he might have done, as he did to accept it upon ſuch terms for them, or for their ſins, who do believe.</p>
            <p>If it be objected; But if Chriſt made ſatisfaction, for the ſins of him, who never believeth, and God accep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teth it not as a ſatisfaction for their ſins; doth not God diſ-approve, or diſ-allow, either Chriſts doings, or his intentions, or both. For if Chriſt in, or by his death, made, or intended to make ſatisfaction for the ſins of Un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>believers, and God refuſeth to accept this ſatisfaction, or that which Chriſt intended for a ſatisfaction, for their ſins, doth he not reject that, which Chriſt deſired, and intended, that he ſhould accept?</p>
            <p>To this, I anſwer, That an Anſwer (in effect) hath been already given. For in ſuch a conſideration, or ſenſe, as <hi>Chriſt</hi> either deſired, or intended, that his death ſhould be a ſatisfaction for the ſins of Unbelievers, dying in un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>belief, doth God the Father accept of it. <hi>Chriſt</hi> neither deſired, nor intended to make ſatisfaction by his death for the ſins of Unbelievers, any otherwiſe, nor upon any o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther terms, then that God the Father ſhould upon the account thereof, juſtifie ſuch perſons from their ſins, in caſe they ſhould have believed: and in this ſenſe he doth accept it as a ſatisfaction for them, being for the ſake thereof, moſt ready and willing, to pardon all the ſins, and ſo to juſtifie the perſons, of all men without exception, as well theirs who never will believe, in caſe they ſhould believe, as theirs, who ſhall believe, and be actually juſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fied thereupon. So that God, in cauſing, or compelling Unbelievers to ſuffer, or to ſatisfie, for their ſins, doth not require, or exact, a ſecond ſatisfaction for them, after a former received; but only puts them upon payment of their debt themſelves, who deſpiſed his Grace in provi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding for them that, which was indeed intended for the
<pb n="19" facs="tcp:37346:21"/>
actuall and reall ſatisfaction hereof, upon condition of their believing, but was never upon theſe terms accepted by him, by reaſon of their non-performance of the ſayd Condition of believing.</p>

                  <seg type="milestoneunit">Sect. </seg>6</label> towards the juſtification of ſinners, hath been in part de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clared already. Under the <hi>Moſaicall</hi> Law, the Beaſt that was to be offered in Sacrifice, to make any of thoſe <hi>Levi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticall</hi> Expiations, was to be <hi>perfect, and without blemiſh;</hi> it was neither <hi>to be blind, nor broken, nor maimed, nor having a Wen, nor ſeurvy, nor ſcabbed, not having any thing ſuperfluous nor any thing lacking in his parts,</hi> &amp;c. If it had any of theſe, or the like imperfections in it, it was not accepted. See <hi>Lev.</hi> 22. 21, 22, 23. Now that which the ſoundneſs, perfecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, and freedom from <hi>blemiſh,</hi> in the Legal Sacrifices, con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tributed towards their acceptation, and conſequently, to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards the efficacy of their reſpective Attonements, or expiations, the ſame, or the like in proportion, doth the active Obedience of <hi>Chriſt</hi> contribute towards the accep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation of his Sacrifice of himſelf, in order to the effica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciouſneſs hereof forthe juſtification of ſinners. This ſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>militude, or proportion is plainly taught and aſſerted by the Apoſtle <hi>Peter,</hi> where he ſayth, <hi>Foraſmuch as yee know yee were not redeemed with corruptible things, as with Silver, and Gold, from the vain converſation received by tradition from your Fathers, but with the pretious blood of Chriſt, as of a Lamb without blemiſh, and without ſpot. [i.</hi> As well without any Naturall Originall deficiency, or imperfe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction, ſignified in the word, <hi>blemiſh,</hi> as without any ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ventitious, or actuall defilement, intimated in the word, <hi>ſpot]</hi> 1 <hi>Pet.</hi> 1. 18, 19. So <hi>John Baptiſt</hi> looketh towards the ſame Analogy, ſaying unto the people concerning him, <hi>Behold the Lamb of God that taketh away the ſins of the world,</hi> Joh. 1. 29. <hi>The Lamb of God, i.</hi> A Perſon highly accepta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble with God, as being every wayes qualified with Inno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cency, Righteouſneſs, Holineſs, &amp;c. and ſo meet by his death, to make Attonement for the ſin of the World.
<pb n="20" facs="tcp:37346:22"/>
So then, as that which the unblemiſhedneſs of the Beaſt for Sacrifice under the Law, exhibited towards that At<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tonement which was made by the offering of it, was the meetneſs of this offering of it for acceptance with God, and conſequently for this acceptance it ſelf, in order to his pardoning, or paſſing by that ceremoniall impurity, or uncleanneſs, for which it was offered, In like manner, the active Obedience of <hi>Chriſt,</hi> in conjunction with the abſolute holineſs and inward purity of his perſon, ren<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dered his death, or the Oblation of himſelf a Sacrifice, every wayes meet and worthy acceptance with God, and conſequently, accepted with him, for the expiation, or Attonement of the ſins of all men.</p>
            <p>If Chriſt had been ſo much as touch'd with the leaſt tincture of defilement with ſin, he had not been a Prieſt af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter the order of <hi>Melchiſedech,</hi> holy, harmleſs, undefiled, ſeparated from ſinners, &amp;c. but rather after the order of <hi>Aaron,</hi> who needed to offer Sacrifice for their own ſins. Neither had he been in any condition, or regular capacity to have made Attonement for the ſins of others, untill he had firſt fully expiated his own. That the active Obedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence of Chriſt doth not operate in, or about, or towards juſtification, in that way, or notion, which ſome have conceived, as, <hi>viz.</hi> by an imputation of the particular acts thereof (in the letter and formality of them) unto thoſe that believe; whereby they ſhould be conſtituted, or made properly and formally righteous, we have demon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrated at large in a juſt treatiſe upon that Subject, where it is made good upon ſeveral accounts, that the ſayd notion, hath neither countenance from the Scriptures, nor any tolerable conſiſtency w<hi rend="sup">th</hi> the cleareſt Principles of reaſon.</p>

and free to it. The Holy Ghoſt ſpeaks plainly e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nough of that comelineſs, which the ſufferings of <hi>Chriſt</hi> put upon the juſtification of a ſinner by God, giving ſome intimation withall, that unleſs this Act had by one means or other been made thus comely for him, he would never have lift up his heart, or hand unto it. <hi>For it became him, for whom are all things, and by whom are all things,</hi> [mean<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing God] <hi>in bringing many Sons unto Glory, to conſecrate,</hi> [or make perfect] <hi>the Captain of their ſalvation through ſufferings,</hi> Heb. 2. 10.

For otherwiſe ſuppoſing them already juſtified, there needed more the <hi>life,</hi> then the <hi>death,</hi> of <hi>Chriſt,</hi> to ſave them; according to that of the Apoſtle <hi>Paul: But God commendeth his love towards us, in that while we were yet ſinners, Chriſt dyed for us. Much more then being now juſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fied by his blood, we ſhall be ſaved from wrath through him. For if when we were Enemies we were reconciled unto God by the death of his Son; much more<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> being reconciled, we ſhall be ſaved by his life,</hi> Rom. 5. 8, 9, 10.

That our ſalvation <g ref="char:punc">▪</g>our juſtification, or reconciliation unto God, preſuppoſed] unto his life, <hi>i.</hi> Unto that power, which is given unto him in that life, which now he lives in glory at the right hand of the Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, to exerciſe for the ſaving of all thoſe that believe in him. Life frequently imports vigour, activity, livelineſs of ſtrength, or power, for action<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> as death imports weak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs and imbecility for action.</p>
            <p>If you ask me, But how, or in what reſpect, doth the paſſive Obedience, or death of <hi>Chriſt,</hi> render the act of juſtification, as now it is exerted, or performed by God, ſo comely, or honourable for him? Or how may we con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive,

that either it would have been uncomely, or leſs comely for him to have appeared in it, in caſe his hand had not been ſtrengthned by the death of <hi>Chriſt</hi> unto it? Or doth it not well enough become the great God to for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>give ſin freely and without ſatisfaction?</p>
            <p>I anſwer, 1. Whether we conceive the import of thoſe words ſpoken by God unto <hi>Adam,</hi> and in him, unto all his Poſterity, being yet in his Loyns, <hi>In the day that thou eateſt thereof, thou ſhalt dye the death,</hi> either in the nature, or notion of a dreadfull threatning in caſe of diſobedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence, or of a moſt ſacred, and ſevere Law, to reſtrain ſin, and diſobedience (the difference, I confeſs, is not much materiall, as far as at preſent I apprehend) it was no wayes honourable, or comely for God to ſuffer either the one, or the other, to be trodden, or trampled under foot by the Creature to whom they were given, without looking af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter them, or calling for ſome ſatisfactory account for the contempt meaſured out unto them. It cannot reaſona<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bly be thought, but that God, by the denunciation of ſuch a threatning, or promulgation, and ſanction of ſuch a Law, awakened and amuſed both Heaven and Earth, and raiſed great expectations in both what the iſſue, or conſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quence would be. Now then, <hi>Adam,</hi> and his Poſterity, being (as was ſayd) now in him, riſing up in diſobedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence in the very face (as it were) and preſence of ſo ter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rible a threatning, if God ſhould have paſſed by, and made no words of this high miſ-demeanour, he might ſeem, either on the one hand to repent that he had ſo ſorely threatned them, and therefore now proceeded not to execution; or elſe on the other hand, that he was content and willing enough to be neglected, or affronted by his Creature: both which, would have been very un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>comely and diſhonourable unto him. Nor would it have been of much more comely an interpretation, had he ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cepted any thing of an inferiour value, or leſs conſidera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble, inſtead of a Compenſation, or ſatisfaction, and had not ſtood upon a juſt and full vindication of his Soveraign

Doubtleſs it is not convenient, or come<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, poſitively to deliver, or aſſert that for a Doctrine of Truth, which is ſo diametrally oppoſite to the frequent, cleer, and expreſs words of the Scripture. If there be a
<pb n="33" facs="tcp:37346:28"/>
limited ſence, to be put upon ſuch paſſages, wherein a Truth is commonly, and from place to place held forth in the Scriptures, this may conveniently and timouſly e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nough be done in the Explication or Opening of the Doctrine: But I judge it very incongruous for any Mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſter of the Goſpel to ſet up a Doctrine as it were in de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fiance of, or in Conteſt againſt any thing ſo frequently, and ſo directly in <hi>terminis</hi> affirmed in the Scriptures, as Juſtification by Faith. And (doubtleſſe) men need not be at all tender, or afraid, to deliver this poſitively for a Doctrine of Evangelical Truth, that men are juſtified by Faith, yea or by Faith alone, if they do but declare or ſig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nifie withall 1. What the Scripture means by that Juſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fication, which it aſcribeth unto Faith. 2 What it means by that Faith unto which it aſcribeth Juſtification. For 1. that Juſtification, which the Scripture attributeth unto Faith, is preciſely that which conſiſteth in Remiſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of ſins, as the Apoſtle plainly teacheth, Rom. 3. 25. but more largely, Rom. 4. 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8. (to omit other places.) Now certain it is, that no kinde of works whatſoever, enjoyned in the Moral Law, have any thing at all, little or much, to doe, about Remiſſion of Sins, or in the procurement or obtaining of it. For in caſe a man ſhould tranſgreſſe the Law, or ſin, only once, and this in the lighteſt manner, and ſhould for ten thouſand years together afterwards, with all poſſible exactneſſe, obſerve and keep this Law, yet this long Tract or Series of Obe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dience, or good Works, would not make his Attone<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment for that Sin, nor bring him off from the Guilt of it with Peace and Safety. The reaſon is ſignified by the Apoſtle, Heb. 9. 22. <hi>Without ſhedding of Bloud there is no Remiſſion.</hi> The Wiſdome and Righteouſneſſe of God did not judge it reaſonable, or meet, that the payment of one Debt by the Creature, though amounting to never ſo great a Summe, ſhould ſatisfie for the Non-payment of another. Now the moſt exact Obedience that can be performed or yielded unto the Law of God by any Crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture,
<pb n="34" facs="tcp:37346:29"/>
whileſt it hath any being, is but a debt due from this Creature unto God: Therefore no Obedience in this kinde can ſatisfie for, or attone<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> either in whole, or in part, the leaſt Diſobedience or Tranſgreſſion. So that Juſtification from ſin (as the Scripture phraſe is, <hi>Act.</hi> 13. 39.) <hi>i.</hi> which ſtandeth in <hi>Remiſion of ſins,</hi> cannot be purchaſed or procured, but by the Death or Blood-ſhed of him, that ſhould undertake the Redemption of Sin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ners. Only God was pleaſed to decree, or make this for a Law (which the Apoſtle calleth, <hi>the Law of Faith,</hi> Rom<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> 3. 27.) that Faith, or believing in him through <hi>Christ,</hi> ſhould intereſs men in the benefit or bleſſing of the Death and Bloud-ſhed of <hi>Chriſt, i.</hi> in that Remiſſion of Sins which was purchaſed by his Death. And in this conſideration Faith juſtifieth, <hi>viz.</hi> by vertue of the So<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veraign Authority of that moſt Gracious Decree, or Law of God, wherein he hath ſaid, or decreed, that it ſhall intitle men unto, or in-right them in, part and fellow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhip of that benefit of the Death of <hi>Chriſt,</hi> which con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiſteth in Forgiveneſſe of Sins; or (which comes much to the ſame) as it is a Qualification, or condition ordain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, covenanted, or appointed by God to bring upon thoſe, in whom it ſhall be found, the great Bleſſing of that Pardon of Sin, which <hi>Christ</hi> hath obtained for Men by his Blood. And becauſe God hath not paſſed any ſuch Decree, nor made any ſuch Law, concerning good works, as <hi>viz.</hi> that theſe ſhall bring men into Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>munion of the benefit of Remiſſion of Sins purchaſed by the Death of <hi>Chriſt<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>

true believing. For otherwiſe, if the caſe ſhould ſo happen, that a true Believer ſhould be taken away by Death, the next moment to that in which he firſt believed, it is not to be thought but that he ſhould die, not ſimply with his ſins pardoned, but under the approbation of God alſo. Therefore Good Works, <hi>in actu exercito</hi> (as the Schoolmen ſpeak) or actually performed, are not abſolutely, univerſally, or in every caſe that may poſſibly happen, neceſſary, no not to that Juſtification it ſelf, which ſimpathizeth (as hath been ſaid) in import with Approbation, Commendation, Vindication from blame imputed, or the like. It is true, <hi>in actu ſignato,</hi> or as they are Radically, Seminally, or Vertually included in that Faith which juſtifieth by Remiſſion of ſins (of which more preſently) ſo they are univerſally, and in all caſes poſſible, if we ſpeak of perſons capable by Years and Diſcretion of Believing, neceſſary thereunto. And God who accepteth the Will for the Deed, when men want opportunity or means, for Action, looketh upon thoſe good Works, which are conceived in the Womb of a true and unfeigned Faith, as actually performed and done, when ſuch a Faith wants means, time, or oppor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tunity to bring forth. In this notion our Saviour him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf muſt be underſtood to ſpeak, at leaſt in reference un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to many of thoſe, to whom he ſpeaketh, if he be con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived to ſpeak unto all ſtanding on his right hand (which I judge to be the more rational to ſuppoſe) Mat. 25. 34, 35, 36. <hi>Come ye Bleſſed of my Father—For I was an hungred, and ye gave me meat; I was thirsty, and ye gave me drink: I was a Stranger, and ye took me in: Naked, and ye cloathed me: I was ſick, and ye viſited me: I was in Priſon, and ye came unto me.</hi> Doubtleſſe ſome, yea a con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiderable party, of thoſe, to whom the Lord Chriſt will expreſſe himſelf thus in that Great Day, will be ſuch, who had been poor in the dayes of their Fleſh, and afflicted, and ſtood in need of being relieved by their <hi>Chriſtian</hi> Bre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thren, better accommodated in the World then they, and
<pb n="36" facs="tcp:37346:30"/>
in whoſe relief <hi>Chriſt</hi> will acknowledge himſelf relieved, <hi>v.</hi> 40. Therefore ſuch as theſe had not been in a condi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion or capacity to miniſter actually unto the wants and neceſſities of other poor Chriſtians in thoſe reſpective Supplies and Accommodations here ſpecified: and yet we finde (according to our late ſuppoſition) that <hi>Chriſt</hi> gives the ſame teſtimony unto them for theſe ſervices of Charity, which he gives unto thoſe that had actually performed them. His meaning then muſt be, that even theſe poor diſtreſſed Saints, who had not wherewith either to cloath the naked, or to give entertainment unto Strangers, <hi>actually,</hi> yet had both one and other the ſame works and ſervices of Chriſtian commiſeration and cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity here mentioned, in the Bowels of the ſame kinde of Faith, out of which they actually proceeded from their better World-provided Brethren, and were performed by them But this occaſionally here, and by the way, for the better Explication of that Juſtification, which the Scripture ſo conſtantly, (as we have heard) aſcribeth unto Faith.</p>
            <p n="2">2. Concerning that Faith, unto which the Juſtifica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion mentioned, is aſcribed, the Scripture deſcribeth it with much variety in reſpect of its object.

Sometimes a <hi>believing on Chriſt,</hi> or, on the Son of God, or <hi>on the Lord,</hi> Act. 11. 17. Joh. 3. 18 &amp; 12. 37. 1 Joh. 5 10.

Sometimes, by a believing that <hi>Chriſt</hi> is <hi>Chriſt, the Son of God that was to come into the World,</hi> Joh. 11. 27. and again a <hi>believing that Jeſus Chriſt is the Son of God,</hi> Act. 8. 37. See alſo Joh. 8. 24. and

again, Joh. 11. 47. Sometimes it is called, <hi>a believing in Chriſts name,</hi> Joh. 1. 12. &amp; Joh. 2. 23. &amp; Joh. 3. 18. It is very poſſible that yet there may be in the Scriptures a greater variety of Denominations or Expreſſions of that Faith, which juſtifieth, in reference to its object, then that now repreſented. But all theſe that have been men<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tioned (and I doubt nor, but thoſe others alſo ſuper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>numerary unto theſe, if any ſuch there be) are of an eaſie and ready reducement into one and the ſame no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion and import. But that diſtinguiſhing character (one, or more) of the juſtifying Faith, which we are at pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent enquiring after, reſpecteth not the Object, but the Intrinſick nature or complexion of it. The Scripture, in reference hereunto, ſometime deſcribeth it to be a <hi>be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieving in the heart,</hi> Rom. 10. 9. Other while, a <hi>believing with the heart,</hi> Rom. 10. 10. Sometimes again, <hi>a be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieving with all the heart,</hi> Act. 8. 37.

<pb n="38" facs="tcp:37346:31"/>
which, withall is ſpiritfull, lively and active in provoking the Soul in which it reſides, to the love of God and Men, and to wayes and works ſuteable to ſuch an affection, is the only thing or means deſigned, authorized and ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pointed by God to bring men into part and fellowſhip of that Juſtification, or Remiſſion of ſins, which hath been purchaſed or procured by the death of <hi>Jeſus Chriſt<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
               </hi> for men. A Faith of this Genius, temper and complexi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, borroweth no aid, help or aſſiſtance from any of her children (I mean from any of thoſe good works, which pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceed from her) for or towards that juſtifying of men with that Juſtification, which ſtandeth in Remiſſion of Sins: ſhe is by vertue of that authority derived unto her by God, ſelf-ſufficient to give this great and happy inveſtiture unto men; yea ſhould ſhe die before ſhe had opportunity to bring forth, ſhe would do that worthy ſervice to him that had conceived her. It is true, as concerning that Juſtifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cation, of which the Apoſtle <hi>James</hi> ſpeaks ſo much in his ſecond Chapter, which is a Juſtification of a perſon teſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fied, declared, publiſhed, or made known, the Faith we ſpeak of ſtandeth in need of the help and Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>operation (as the ſame Apoſtle there ſpeaks <hi>v.</hi> 22.) of her Children. God himſelf will not report any man juſtified (I mean, any man capable of Good works) nor would he have any man (of this capacity) judged or reputed by others a juſtified perſon, who hath not juſtified or commended his Faith by ſuch works. But this by the way to vindi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cate and clear the Intereſt of Faith in the great buſineſs of Juſtification, and to ſever it from that of Works, not more contended for, then confounded with it, by ſome.</p>
            <p>To conclude this Section; The vertue or power, by which Faith juſtifieth, it receiveth from the deſignation, ordinance, appointment, or Decree of God: The man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner how it juſtifieth, is by the giving of men Intereſt or part in the great benefit of Remiſſion of ſins purchaſed by Chriſt, according to the tenor of Gods Ordinance or Decree in that behalf. They who conceive or teach
<pb facs="tcp:37346:31"/>
that Faith juſtifieth as it is an Inſtrument receiving <hi>Chriſts</hi> righteouſneſſe, or <hi>Chriſt</hi> himſelf, unadviſedly ſtamble at that Popiſh notion (as it is frequently charged upon men of that perſwaſion, by Proteſtant Writers) which placeth the juſtifying nature or vertue of Faith in ſomewhat, in ſome worth that is eſſential and intrinſick to it. For evident it is, that there is nothing more in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward or eſſential unto Faith, then the receiving of <hi>Chriſt,</hi> or <hi>Chriſts</hi> Righteouſneſſe, this being the very nature and ſubſtance of it. Whereas the Ordinance, Will, or De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cree of God, which inveſteth Faith, or the receiving of <hi>Chriſt,</hi> with the great priviledge or power of juſtifying men, is apparently extrinſecal and extra-eſſential to it, and ſo miniſtreth no occaſion in the leaſt unto Faith to boaſt of any excellency or conſiderableneſſe of worth in it ſelf, but reſolves that which is of that high and Sacred concernment in it unto men, as <hi>viz.</hi> to juſtifie and to ſave them, into the Grace and good pleaſure of God. But I have given an account of my judgement touching this point ſomewhat more at large elſewhere. And this at preſent may ſerve to clear the Intereſt of Faith in, or a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout Juſtification, and to ſhew particularly and diſtinct<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly what part it acteth in the Inveſtiture of men, who have ſinned, with that Bleſſedneſſe.</p>

               <pb n="41" facs="tcp:37346:32"/>
Rom. 5. 18. that is, a Juſtification, which reſtores a Sin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner unto Life, <hi>i. e.</hi> unto a Right, Title, and Capacity of Eternal Life, who before was under a ſentence of Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demnation, and ſo dead in Law.</p>
            <p>So then the Queſtionis, how <hi>Repentance</hi> may be con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived to operate towards Juſtification, or what it con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tributeth thereunto. I anſwer,</p>

A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gain, Faith being brought into the Soul, by the oppor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tunity of ſuch a Repentance, as a form into matter diſpo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed, or prepared, carries on that Repentance to greater perfection, by means whereof, whileſt it was yet in its Minority, it ſelf was furthered in its being. So that as Faith was diſpoſitively, or preparative-wiſe in Repen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance, whileſt Repentance was imperfect; So is Repen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance <hi>perfectively,</hi> or in reſpect of its conſummation, in Faith. The Scripture ſpeaks evidently of a Repentance precedaneous unto Faith; yea and ſeems to aſſert a
<pb n="42" facs="tcp:37346:33"/>
neceſſity of the precedency of it, in order unto Faith. And ye (ſaith the Lord <hi>Chriſt</hi> to the chief Prieſts, and Elders of the <hi>Jewes) when ye had ſeen it, repented not after<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward, that ye might believe him</hi> (ſpeaking of <hi>Johns</hi> teſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mony concerning him, as that he was the true Meſſiah, and Saviour of the World) Mat. 21. 32. So the Apoſtle <hi>Paul</hi> adviſeth <hi>Timothy</hi> to <hi>inſtruct in meekneſſe thoſe that oppoſe themſelves, if God peradventure will</hi> [or rather, ſhall] <hi>give them Repentance to the acknowledgement of the truth</hi> 
               <note n="k" place="margin">Tim. 2. 25.</note>, <hi>[i. e.</hi> a Repentance, which ſhall diſpoſe, or put them in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to an immediate capacity to believe the truth of the Goſpell. As on the contrary our Saviour expoſtulates thus with the <hi>Jewes: How can ye believe, who receive Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour one of another</hi> (Joh. 5. 44.) clearly implying that there was a neceſſity lying upon them to repent of that their ambitious and ſelf-ſeeking humor, to put them into a regular or hopefull capacity of Believing. Thus then we ſee that, according to the Scriptures, there is a Repentance, which is an Harbinger or Way-preparer unto Faith: In reſpect whereof, Faith may be ſaid to be diſpoſitively (as hath been ſayd) and by way of prepara<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, in Repentance. But this Repentance, notwith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtanding the great ſervice it doth unto men in accommo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dating their way towards believing, yea and proceedeth alſo from the Grace of God, and is to a degree and in its meaſure accepted with him, in whomſoever it is found, yet is it but imperfect, and wants many degrees of that ſtrength and ſoundneſſe, which afterwards it receiveth by its conjuction and communion with Faith. And ſo, in reſpect of this inlargement or additional perfection, it may be ſaid to have a being in Faith. I doe not think it worth the making a Controverſie, or Diſpute, whether that Repentance which goeth before Faith, and qualifies the ſubject for a more ready or willing reception of it, and that which followes and accompanies Faith, be of one and the ſame ſpecies, or of different. Yet I rather incline to think, that they do not only not differ <hi>ſpecie</hi>
               <pb n="43" facs="tcp:37346:33"/>
(unleſſe it be <hi>ſpecie accidentali,</hi> as a Man differs from a Childe, a Man Learned from a Man Illitetate, a Man that is poor, from a man that is rich, and the like,) but not ſo much as <hi>in individuo;</hi> as <hi>Paul</hi> was the ſame <hi>indivi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duum,</hi> when he was a Man, which he was when he was a Child. That the one hath Juſtification, or Remiſſion of ſins, annexed unto it by promiſe from God, and the other, not, doth no more prove them to differ <hi>ſpecie,</hi> no nor yet <hi>individuo,</hi> then <hi>Pauls</hi> proving in time a great and faithfull Apoſtle, and choſen Veſſel unto God, proveth him to have been, either of another <hi>ſpecies,</hi> or another <hi>individuum,</hi> when he was a fierce Perſecutor, and (as himſelf acknowledgeth) <hi>of ſinners the chief.</hi> But this Circle of Diſcourſe, is (I confeſſe) ſomewhat Ec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>centrical to our buſineſſe in hand, which is not to diſtin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guiſh Repentance as preceding, and as accompanying Faith, but to inquire out, and declare, as God ſhall inable and direct, what, or how, Repentance, as included in, or accompanying Faith, operateth towards Juſtification, or Remiſſion of ſins. That which I conceive, is this. God not judging it meet to inveſt a perſon, who yet retains the love and liking of ſinfull and wicked wayes, with ſo great, and ſacred a priviledge, and Grace, as Forgive<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs of ſins, was pleaſed to eſtabliſh it for a Law, that no Man or Woman remaining impenitent, and without unfeigned remorſe of Soul for their ſins paſt, ſhould ever be admitted into part and fellowſhip of that unſpeakable Grace of his in <hi>Jeſus Chriſt,</hi> which conſiſts in pardon, or Remiſſion of ſins. Again, being highly pleaſed with that moſt regular, generous, and worthy deportment of Soul, in whomſoever it ſhould be found, which conſiſts in a genuine and real hatred and abhorrency of all un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>righteouſneſſe, and of whatſoever is ſinfull or unclean, enacted another Law in honour of this Heroick Act and Deportment, <hi>viz.</hi> that whoſoever ſhould with his whole heart and ſoul repent of all his ſinfull miſcarriages and miſdoings, and ſtand reſolved in heart for wayes of purity
<pb n="44" facs="tcp:37346:34"/>
and uprightneſſe for the future, ſhould be tranſlated by him into that bleſſed ſtate, which ſtandeth in Remiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion of all ſin. So that Repentance ſeems to operate two wayes towards Juſtification, or Remiſſion of ſins. Firſt, in the nature, or after the manner, of that kinde of cauſe, which Logicians call <hi>Removens prohibens,</hi> i. e. which contributeth towards an effect, by removing that out of the way, which being not removed, would have hin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dered it. Thus the taking away of the Dignity, place, and power, of the <hi>Roman</hi> Emperors, was the cauſe of the diſcovery or riſing up of the Anti-Chriſtian Race, and their power, 2 <hi>Theſſ.</hi> 2<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> 7, 8. So Repentance, by remo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving that wretched and wicked habit or frame of ſoul, which being un-removed, would have obſtructed the Grace and Bleſſing of pardon of ſin, contributeth to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards the obtaining of it. Secondly, as Repentance includes in the nature and conſtituting Principles of it, a diſpoſition or frame of heart ſo highly pleaſing unto God, that he judgeth it no wayes unworthy of him, to honour and reward it with ſo great a reward, as Remiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion of ſins, ſo it may be conceived to contribute or operate towards Remiſſion of ſins, or Juſtification, <hi>tan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quam cauſa diſpoſitiva, i. e.</hi> as regularly qualifying the ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject for the reception of the form to be brought into it.</p>
            <p>By this (I ſuppoſe) the intereſt of Repentance, or that which it acteth towards, in, or about Juſtification, may be clearly diſtinguiſhed from the Intereſt of Faith, and that which it acteth in reference to the ſame end. When God in Scripture is ſaid to <hi>juſtifie the ungodly,</hi> the meaning is not that he <hi>juſtifies ungodly</hi> perſons, whileſt they are or remain ungodly; but he is ſaid to <hi>juſtifie the ungodly,</hi> in like form of ſpeech, as our Saviour uſeth, Mat. 11. 5. <gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap>, &amp;c. That is, <hi>The blinde ſee, the lame walke, the Leapers are cleanſed, and the deaf hear.</hi> The meaning clearly e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nough is, not that the Blinde, whileſt blinde, did ſee; or
<pb n="45" facs="tcp:37346:34"/>
the Lame, whileſt they remained Lame, did walk, or that the Lepers whileſt their Leproſie was yet upon them, were cleanſed, &amp;c. but that ſuch who had been formerly and untill <hi>Chriſt</hi> relieved them, Blinde, Lame, Lepers, Deaf, were by him miraculouſly reſtored, ſuch as had been Blinde, to their Sight; ſuch as had been Lame, to the uſefulneſſe of their Limbs for walking, &amp;c. In like man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner God is ſaid to <hi>juſtifie the ungodly,</hi> when he juſtifies, or makes ſuch perſons righteous by the pardon of their ſins, who had formerly been <hi>ungodly,</hi> prophane, &amp;c. But he doth not juſtifie them, or make them righteous by the Forgiveneſſe of their ſins, whileſt they remain <hi>ungodly;</hi> but upon the alteration and change of the ſinfull frame of their hearts, by believing, he conferres this Juſtifica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion upon them, <hi>viz.</hi> the Forgiveneſſe of their ſins. And the reaſon why God doth not judge it meet to juſtifie men, or forgive them their ſins, whileſt they remain un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>godly, unrighteous, wicked, prophane, or the like, may be, partly to cut off all occaſion from his Creature to conceive of him as a friend to ſin, or to impenitent and obdurate ſinners; partly alſo to contrive his Grace and high favour in Juſtification, into an alluring Argument, and ſtrong motive to perſwade men out of the love and liking of ſin, and ſinfull wayes, into the love and pra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctiſe of Righteouſneſſe and true Holineſſe. The Apoſtle <hi>Paul</hi> was put to Apologize for his Doctrine of the Grace of God in Forgiveneſſe of ſins, becauſe according to it, this Grace is promiſed and given unto ſinners, though unto ſuch ſinners only, who repent, and bring forth fruits meet for Repentance. <hi>But if</hi> (ſaith he) <hi>whileſt we ſeek to be juſtified by Chriſt, we our ſelves alſo are found ſinners, is therefore Chriſt the Miniſter of ſin? [i. e.</hi> doth <hi>Chriſt</hi> by juſtifying ſuch Sinners, as he juſtifieth, <hi>viz.</hi> ſuch who be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve and repent, countenance, abet, or promote ſin in the world] <hi>God forbid,</hi> Gal. 2. 17. If then inconſiderate and unworthy men conceive that God would be liable to an imputation of favouring or cheriſhing ſin in men, in
<pb n="46" facs="tcp:37346:35"/>
caſe he ſhould juſtifie or pardon all Sinners upon their Repentance, (which now he doth) how much more ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>noxious would he have been, in ſuch mens opinions, to this imputation and charge, in caſe he ſhould have in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dulged this high Priviledge of Juſtification unto ſinners without Repentance? Upon this account then it is moſt probable, that God hath not judged it meet to admit or allow any other kinde of Faith to bring men into com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>munion of the Death of <hi>Chriſt</hi> for the Forgiveneſſe of their ſins, but only that which is accompanyed with an unfeigned Repentance, or which purifieth and cleanſeth the heart (or at leaſt is apt ſo to doe) from the love and liking of all unrighteouſneſſe and uncleanneſſe. If it be thus, then the interpoſure or intereſt of Repentance a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout Juſtification is by way of Qualification, or of ren<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dering the ſubject, the ſinner, regularly capable of that high and ſacred Priviledge. And though it doth not per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>form the office or work of Faith about Juſtification, which is (as hath been ſaid) to bring men into the fel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowſhip of the Death of <hi>Chriſt</hi> where, and where only, Juſtification or Remiſſion of ſins, is to be had, yet it le<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gitimates or authorizeth the perſon for the reception of this bleſſed Accommodation from the hand of Faith: And for this reaſon alſo it may well be conceived to have the promiſe of Juſtification, or Remiſſion of ſins, made unto it, as well as Faith it ſelf.</p>

That good works have their part alſo in the great <note place="margin">How good works are, and may be, ſaid to juſtifie.</note>buſineſſe of Juſtification, is the expreſſe affirmation of the Scripture. <hi>Ye ſee then how that by works a man is justi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fied, and not by Faith only,</hi> Jam. 2. 24.

That that Juſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fication, which conſiſts in Remiſſion of ſins, and which enſtates a perſon in a right of title and claim to Eternal
<pb n="47" facs="tcp:37346:35"/>
Life, is not attained, but by ſinners being brought into Communion with <hi>Chriſt</hi> in his Death; or (which is the ſame) into part and fellowſhip in this Death, which is the only procuring cauſe of this Juſtification, by way of purchaſe. 2. That whatſoever bringeth men hither, (I mean, into Communion of, or with the Death of <hi>Chriſt)</hi> muſt be ſealed and authorized by God hereunto. 3. That a true and unfaigned Faith in God through <hi>Jeſus Christ</hi> (ſometimes called, Faith in <hi>Christ,</hi> yea and ſeveral other wayes expreſſed, as hath been already obſerved) and this Faith only, not any work, or works, of what kinde ſoever, or in what number ſoever, injoyned in the Moral Law, hath a commiſſion or power from God to bring men into, or to give men part and fellowſhip in the Death of <hi>Christ.</hi> Therefore Good works have thus farre no part or intereſt at all in Juſtification, as it ſtandeth in Remiſſion of ſins, being excluded here-from by the ſame Law, by which <hi>Boaſting</hi> alſo is excluded, which the Apoſtle termeth, <hi>the Law of Faith. Where is Boaſting then? It is excluded. By what Law? Of Works? Nay, but BY THE LAW OF FAITH?</hi> Rom 3. 27. By this Law, Faith hath the office or work of juſtifying men in this ſenſe, and with this kinde of Juſtification, ſetled upon, and confirmed unto, it ſelf, alone. There is another kinde of Juſtification, which the Scripture alſo fre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quently ſpeaks of under this name (as was noted §. 11.) which conſiſts in the approbation, commendation, or vindication of a perſon from guilt or blame, whether juſtly, or unjuſtly, imputed unto him. Of this kinde of Juſtification, when it is duely and juſtly given, or pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nounced, Good Works, in one kinde or other, and for the moſt part thoſe of the Moral Law, have a ſpecial and particular intereſt in it, being the only regular ground upon which the act, or ſentence, of ſuch a Juſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fication, can, or ought to proceed. And though God, by means of his appropriate priviledge of <gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap>, or knowing the heart, can, and doth, upon a ſufficient
<pb facs="tcp:37346:36"/>
ground, ſecretly and in himſelf, approve of him, who as yet only believeth (I mean, with a true and unfeigned Faith) and before he hath any wayes juſtified or com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mended this his Faith by good works, yet he is not wont to ſignifie or declare, by one means, or other, this his approbation of any particular perſon, untill he hath ſhewed the World his Faith by his Works. Nor doth he require of any man to judge of any other per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> as a man juſtified in his ſight by a true and unfaign<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed Faith, who hath not given either unto him, or unto ſome others, from whom he may receive the informa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, a fair and reaſonable account by works ſuteable, of ſuch a Faith reſiding in him. And queſtionleſſe it was this kinde of Juſtification, of which the Apoſtle <hi>James</hi> diſcourſeth ſo largely in his Second Chapter, as appear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth all along the Context, from <hi>verſ.</hi> 14. to the end. Therefore when he demands, <hi>verſ</hi> 21. <hi>Was not our Father Abraham juſtified by works, when he had offered his Son Iſaac upon the Altar?</hi> Evident it is, that by <hi>Abrahams</hi> being <hi>juſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fied,</hi> he doth not mean, that <hi>Abraham</hi> had his ſins par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>doned; for he had been thus <hi>juſtified</hi> long before. And beſides, his offering up his Son <hi>Iſaac</hi> upon the Altar, could be no means of obtaining Remiſſion of ſins from God. But when he is ſaid to have been <hi>juſtified by works, when he had offered,</hi> &amp;c. the meaning is, that upon this great teſtimony given by <hi>Abraham</hi> of the truth and ef<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fectualneſſe of his Faith, God highly approved of him, loved him, and dealt by him as by a perſon righteous and juſt, and called him his Friend. The tenour of the ſtory in <hi>Geneſis</hi> fully accordeth herewith.

(i.</hi> Juſtifieth, as hath been been ſhewed.) It appears, that his <hi>Righteouſneſs,</hi> or Juſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fication (paſſively taken) which is the cauſe, or means of his <hi>Bleſſedneſs,</hi> conſiſts in the <hi>forgiveneſs</hi> of his <hi>Iniqui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties,</hi> or which is the ſame in ſubſtance, though differing in conſideration, or reſpect) in the <hi>non-imputation of ſin</hi> unto him.

Now by that <hi>Deſcription</hi> (as the Apoſtle termeth it) which <hi>David</hi> giveth (as we have heard) of the <hi>bleſſedneſs</hi> of the <hi>juſtified</hi> Perſon, placing it in this, that his <hi>Iniquities,</hi> or <hi>ſins,</hi> are remitted, or <hi>forgiven,</hi> It is a clear Caſe, that Remiſsion of ſins juſtifieth <hi>Per modum cau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſae formalis,</hi> as the form, or formall Cauſe is ſayd to give being to that which is cauſed by it. When a Painter ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>keth a Wall white, Whiteneſs is the Form, or formall Cauſe, by which the Wall is made white, or which ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>keth the Wall white. Nor can it be with reaſon reduced to any of the other kinds of Cauſes, as is evident; it be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing no Efficient, or materiall, or <gap reason="illegible" extent="2+ letters">

               </gap>all Cauſe hereof, nor carrying the leaſt ſemblance of any of theſe. In like man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner, when God juſtifieth a ſinner, that which he doth to him, or for him, is preciſely this, He forgiveth him his ſins; this is the very form of that his Action, <hi>i.</hi> The form which by his Act of juſtifying, he introduceth anew upon the ſinner. Nor doth he any other thing, directly and imme<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diatly, unto a perſon, when, and as he juſtifieth him, but
<pb n="53" facs="tcp:37346:38"/>
only forgive him his ſins. Of one and the ſame Act, or Action, there cannot be a plurality of Effects, immedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ate and direct, really differing the one from the other.</p>
            <p>It is true, as there may be ſundry collaterall, conſtru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctive, vertuall, or conſequentiall Acts acted, or done, in the doing of ſome one; ſo there may be, nay, there al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>waies is, an anſwerable variety of Effects produced by, and ſo Attributable unto, this one Act. When a Prince prefers ſome Head of a Family to a great place of profit and power in the State, or any other perſon, who is a Lo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver of his Friends and Relations in blood, he may be ſayd to caſt honour upon this perſon, to better his condition in the World, to raiſe his Family, to give every particular Member hereof hope of being better accommodated in matters of this life; yea, in caſe he doth beſtow this pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferment upon him for his Fathers, or any of his Anceſtors ſake, as for any worth in them, or for any good Service done by them, or the like; in preferring him, he may be ſayd to impute the worth, or faithfulneſs of ſuch an An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſtor unto him. But all ſuch Acts as theſe, are but mediate, conſtructive, or conſequentiall; and ſo are their reſpective effects to be interpreted likewiſe. A Prince when he pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fers a man, in ſtrict propriety of ſpeaking, doth nothing elſe but prefer him, or (which is the ſame) confers ſome place of profit, or of honour upon him. In like manner, when God juſtifieth a man, he may be ſayd to bleſs him, to tranſlate him from Death to Life, to give him a lawfull Title, or Claim to eternall life, and his Heavenly King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome: and becauſe he doth it upon the account, and for the ſake, of the Obedience of Chriſt, as well active, as paſſive (although in a more peculiar manner, upon the account of the latter, the Scripture conſtantly aſcribing Juſtification, unto the blood, death, ſufferings, &amp;c. of Chriſt, and never, to my remembrance, unto his active Obedience, unleſs haply as preſuppoſed unto his paſſive, and as qualifying it for its high Service) I ſay, becauſe God juſtifieth men for the ſake of <hi>Chriſt,</hi> and for what he
<pb n="54" facs="tcp:37346:39"/>
hath done and ſuffered in ſerving his counſell and good pleaſure, he may, when he juſtifieth any man, be ſayd to impute the righteouſneſs, or obedience of <hi>Chriſt</hi> unto him. And becauſe, in order to this Act of his (I mean his Act of juſtifying a man) he requires Faith of him, and Faith only (in the ſenſe formerly declared and aſſerted) when he juſtifieth him, he may be ſayd, to count, or to impute his Faith unto him for righteouſneſs. Again, when he juſtifieth a man, becauſe he graciouſly confers upon him a righteouſneſs of his own Invention and Contri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vance, and doth not juſtifie him, with, for, or upon, any righteouſneſs found in him, whom he juſtifieth, therefore when he juſtifieth him, he is ſayd, <hi>to impute righteouſneſs unto him, i.</hi> (as it were) To gratifie him with a righte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ouſneſs, remiſsion of ſins being a righteouſneſs, properly enough ſo called, in as much as he, who is chargable with no ſin, which is his priviledge, or caſe, who hath all his ſins juſtly and authoritatively remitted, muſt needs be looked upon as an Obſerver of the whole Law. But when God juſtifieth a perſon, he doth none of theſe things to him in a direct, formall, or immediate way, but conſtru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctively, or conſecutively only. All that he doth upon ſuch terms, is only this, he juſtifieth him, <hi>i.</hi> He remitteth unto him all his ſins, remiſsion of ſins being that abſolute and compleat righteouſneſs, wherewith a ſinner is inveſted by God in his juſtification, beſides which, ſuch a perſon is not capable of any, nor ſtandeth in need of any, for the attainment of any end, or benefit of righteouſneſs what<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſoever. And as for thoſe that have been the greateſt ſin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ners, and neither gave Meat unto <hi>Chriſt,</hi> when he was an hungry, nor Drink, when he was thirſty, nor cloathed him when he was naked, &amp;c. If ſo be God ſhould remit theſe, and all other their ſins unto them (which yet he cannot without their timely repentance, and contrary practiſing for a ſeaſon, becauſe this would be to deny himſelf, I mean, his righteouſneſs and truth) they ſhould hereby become as righteous, and as capable of the reward of

For when the Apoſtle <hi>Paul</hi> writeth to <hi>Timothy,</hi> that by doing what he had directed him to do, he ſhould both <hi>ſave</hi> himſelf, and thoſe that heard him, 1 <hi>Tim.</hi> 4. 16. and ſo aſſumeth unto himſelf a capacity of the ſame glorious Service, <hi>Rom.</hi> 11. 14. <hi>If by any means I may provoke to emulation them which are my fleſh, and might ſave ſome of them:</hi> when (I ſay) he aſcribeth that great Act and Service of <hi>ſaving</hi> men unto the Miniſters of the Goſpel, he doth implicitely, and by neer<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>hand conſequence, aſcribe unto them the juſtifying of them likewiſe: For there is no conſideration, or reſpect, wherein a Miniſter can be ſayd to <hi>ſave</hi> men, but by a pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cedaneous, or preſuppoſed Act of juſtifying them. Nor is there any perſon capable of being ſaved by a Miniſter of the Goſpell, in his way, or capacity of ſaving men, who is not as capable (or rather, more capable) of being ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtified by him.

Now in ſuch a ſenſe, wherein men may be ſayd to be made belie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vers by the Miniſters of the Goſpel, they may be ſayd to be <hi>juſtified</hi> alſo by them; inaſmuch as both theſe are ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>compliſhed or effected by one and the ſame Act, the for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer, directly and immediatly, the latter mediatly and conſequentially. If you then ask me, What doth the Miniſter contribute towards the <hi>juſtifying</hi> of men, or in what conſideration may he be ſayd to juſtifie them? My Anſwer is, When he openeth unto them the Councell of God in the Goſpell, concerning the juſtification and ſalva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of men by <hi>Jeſus Chriſt,</hi> ſo effectually, ſo throughly, and with that evidence and demonſtration of the Spirit, (as the Apoſtle ſpeaks) that mens Reaſons, Judgments, and Conſciences are ſo far convinced, or perſwaded of the truth of what is delive ed upon ſuch terms, that they truly, unfeignedly, and with the whole heart believe it: Now, and upon this account, he may be ſayd to juſtifie them. He that makes a man a Believer, <hi>Ipſo facto,</hi> makes him righte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous, that is, juſtifies him. There is nothing more familiar and frequent in the Scripture, then for the ſame Action, and ſo the ſame Effect, to be aſcribed both unto God and Man: to the former, in reſpect of a ſuperiour and more excellent interpoſure, proper unto him<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> to the latter, in reſpect of that ſubordinate Efficiency, or Subſerviency<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>

               <hi>both ſave himſelf, and them that heard him,</hi> (1 <hi>Tim.</hi> 4. 16.) there is an Action aſcribed unto him, in reference unto himſelf, every whit as great, and as incompetent to him, in the ordinary ſignification of the word, as the act of ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtifying. To ſave a mans ſelf, ſounds altogether as high, as to juſtifie a mans ſelf: yea, he that believeth, may by much a neerer-hand conſequence, and with more proprie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty of ſpeaking, be ſaid to juſtifie himſelf, then to ſave him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf. When a man labours<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> in his Calling, and puts forth that ſtrength of power which God hath <hi>given him to get Wealth [Deut.</hi> 8. 18.] for ſuch a purpoſe, and withall thrives and proſpers (through the bleſſing of God) in his way, he may properly enough be ſayd to enrich himſelf, or make himſelf rich; yea, ſomewhat more properly, then when it is ſaid, <hi>that the hand of the diligent maketh rich, Prov.</hi> 10. 4. In like manner, when a man doth that, upon which, or by means wherof, he ſhall certainly be juſtified, this fruit, or reward of his Action, his juſtification, may without the violation of any Rule, either of Grammar, or of Rhetorick, be aſcribed unto him. Hence it follows, God having by a perpetuall and inviolable Decree ſetled the great benefit and priviledge of juſtification upon be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieving, that when ſoever any perſon, man, or woman, ſhall life up his heart hereunto (I mean, to believe) by this Action he may be ſaid to juſtifie himſelf; not indeed after any ſuch manner, or upon any ſuch terms, as God is ſaid to juſtifie men upon their believing, as <hi>viz.</hi> Authori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tatively,
<pb n="60" facs="tcp:37346:42"/>
or as having a ſoveraign right to juſtifie whom, or upon what terms he pleaſeth, or the like; but in ſuch a way, or ſenſe only, wherein a perſon may be ſaid to do that, which, upon his Action, is done unto him by ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther.</p>
            <p>Of this Conſtruction, or Dialect, there are inſtances more then a few in the Scriptures.</p>
            <p>It may be here demanded, but is it meet, or tolerable to ſay, that a man, when he believeth, imputeth righte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ouſneſs unto himſelf, or forgiveth himſelf his ſins<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> and yet both theſe are done unto him by another <hi>(viz.</hi> God) upon his believing<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> yea, theſe are (as hath in effect been formerly ſayd) but interpretative expreſſions of juſtification it ſelf. And therefore it ſeems, that whoſoe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver may in any ſenſe be ſaid to juſtifie, may in the ſame ſenſe be ſaid to do both the one, and the other of theſe; and this in reference to any, or all of theſe perſons, whom they are ſayd to juſtifie.</p>
            <p>To this I anſwer, 1. That the Expreſſions put to the Queſtion in this Demand, are (indeed) uncouth and harſh, grating upon eares, that have any competent taſt of Words; Nor do I judge them fitting to be applied to, or ſpoken of him that believeth. But,</p>
            <p n="2">2. When a man is ſaid by believing to <hi>juſtifie</hi> himſelf, the meaning is not, that he abſolveth himſelf from his ſins, or pronounceth a Sentence of abſolution over him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf, or that he imputeth righteouſneſs unto himſelf, or the like; but only that he levieth, puts forth, or performs ſuch an Act, whereby he prevaileth with God according to his gracious Covenant and promiſe, to juſtifie him, and therein to do all theſe things to him, or for him. As when a man is ſaid to <hi>ſave himſelf</hi> (which, as we heard, is the Apoſtles own expreſſion) the meaning is not ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, that by a ſtrong hand, or by any phyſicall power, he over-matcheth the Devill, and keeps himſelf out of his Clutches, and from being carried, or thruſt by him into Hell, or that he inveſts himſelf with the ſtate of bleſſed<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs

and glory, which is ſignified and meant by Salvation; but that he takes ſuch a courſe, as <hi>viz.</hi> By believing and perſevering in it unto the end, whereby he ſhall find fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vour in the ſight of God, to do theſe things for him. Now to ſay a man by believing takes an effectuall and direct courſe to prevail with God to forgive him his ſins, to im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pute righteouſneſs unto him, &amp;c. are as proper and conve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nient expreſſions, as to ſay, that he prevails with him to juſtifie him: yet,</p>
            <p n="3">3. (and laſty) It may be conſidered, that one and the ſame thing may admit of ſeverall conſiderations, and different reſpects; and in, and under ſome one of theſe conſidera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions and reſpects, may admit of ſome attributions, of which, it is not ſo regularly, or ſmoothly capable under another. As for inſtance, Salvation, or the ſaving of the Soul, is one and the ſame act; yet it may be conſidered, either as it is procurable at the hand of God by men, as, <hi>viz.</hi> by Faith, and continuance in well-doing: or as it is a reſcuing, or vindication of men by ſtrength of Arm, from the power of the Devill; or as it is an actuall inſta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting in, or putting men into a reall poſſeſſion of that bleſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſedneſs and glory, which God hath aſſigned by promiſe unto his Saints, and thoſe that ſhall be ſaved. Now in either of theſe two latter conſiderations, it is not aſcri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bable unto men, but in the firſt of the three, as we have heard, it is.</p>
            <p>In like manner, the act of juſtifying is one and the ſame act; yet it admits of ſundry conſiderations. (1.) It may be conſidered, either as an act of God imputing righte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ouſneſs unto men, or as an act of his forgiving men all their ſins, or as an act of Grace and high favour purchaſed at his hand by <hi>Chriſt</hi> for men: or (laſtly) As an act at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainable from God by men, for themſelves, by perform<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of ſuch conditions, or terms, upon, and according un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to which, he hath covenanted and promiſed the vouch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſafement of it. The former conſiderations of the act we ſpeak of, are of that nature, and import, that in reſpect of
<pb n="62" facs="tcp:37346:43"/>
none of them, it is attributable unto men, they all im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>porting ſuch things which are above the Line of men. But in the conſideration laſt mentioned, it may in very paſſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble and convenient Language, be attributed unto men who believe, in reference to themſelves. Nor need it be offenſive unto any man, to hear it ſaid, that men who believe, in that ſenſe juſtifie themſelves.</p>
            <p>There are two other Cauſes of Juſtification yet remaining, not mentioned in the <hi>Title Page,</hi> amongſt thoſe that have been inſiſted on; <hi>Viz.</hi> The Materiall, and the Finall: of theſe in few words.</p>
            <p>Concerning the <hi>materiall Cauſe</hi> of Juſtification, <label type="milestone">
                  <seg type="milestoneunit">Sect. </seg>18</label> they who make it to be either <hi>Chriſt</hi> himſelf, or the <note place="margin">Concerning the materiall Cauſe of Ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtification.</note>Righteouſneſs of <hi>Chriſt,</hi> either active, or paſſive, or both, expreſs themſelves very unproperly, and confound two Cauſes alwaies diſtinct, and contradiſtinguiſhed; <hi>Viz.</hi> The efficient, and the materiall, the former being alwaies ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trinſecall, the latter, intrinſecall, to the effect, or thing cauſed by them (in conjunction with the other two Cau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes.) And beſides, in ſo notioning the matter, or material Cauſe of Juſtification, they decline the ordinary Rule, by which, men who love exactneſs and propriety, as well in conceiving, as in ſpeaking, are wont to walk in both, in Caſes of like nature and import. For whereas no Action, (as no Accident beſides) hath any matter, or materiall Cauſe (properly ſo called) yet being an effect, or ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>what that is cauſed, there muſt be ſome Vice-matter, or ſomewhat anſwering the nature or conſideration of ſuch a materiall Cauſe, found in it, or relating to it. Now that which relateth unto an Action with greateſt Affinity unto matter, or to a materiall Cauſe<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> properly ſo called, is, <hi>Subjectum recipiens,</hi> or <hi>Circa quod</hi> as Logicians ſpeak) that is, the Subject receiving the Action, or the Object upon which the Action is acted. According to this no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, the believing, or repentant ſinner, or (which is the ſame) the perſon juſtified, or to be juſtified, is the ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teriall
<pb facs="tcp:37346:43"/>
Cauſe of Juſtification. Such a perſon exhibits, or preſents (as it were) unto God, matter duly fitted and prepared according to his mind, for him to work or act upon, or about, juſtifyingly. And when God doth juſtifie ſuch a perſon, he doth introduce a new form, as, <hi>Viz.</hi> Righ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teouſneſs, remiſſion of ſins, or juſtification paſſive (for theſe I take to be much the ſame) into matter rightly and appropriatly diſpoſed for the reception of it; which mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter is (as hath been ſaid) the ſinner now believing. As when fire heateth the water that is hung over it, or other<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe applyed unto it, the water is the matter upon which the fire acteth in this act of calefaction, and the heat which it cauſeth in the water, is the form which it indu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceth, or introduceth into it. This briefly for the materi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>all Cauſe of Juſtification.</p>
            <p>The <hi>finall Cauſe</hi> of Juſtification is commonly diſtingui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhed into that which is ſubordinate, or leſs principal, and <label type="milestone">
                  <seg type="milestoneunit">Sect. </seg>19</label> that which is ultimate, and ſupream. The former, is <note place="margin">Concerning the finall Cauſe of Ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtification.</note>with one conſent affirmed to be the great benefit, or bleſſedneſs of the Creature, or perſon juſtifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed; which Bleſſedneſſe ſtandeth in two particu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lars (chiefly) deliverance from under the guilt of ſin, (with all the miſery conſequentiall hereunto) and an inveſtiture with a regular Title or Claim unto that immor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tall and undefiled Inheritance, which is reſerved in the Heavens, to be enjoyed in due time by all thoſe, who ſhall be found in a due capacity to be admitted into part and fellowſhip therein. The ultimate, or ſupream end, or materiall Cauſe of Juſtification, is concluded with a <hi>Ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mine contradicente</hi> (as far as I know) to be the Glory of God, partly in the juſt vindication of a ſinner from under the guilt of ſin, and from the puniſhment incurred there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by, and partly in the Salvation, and eternall Glorification of the perſon ſo vindicated.</p>
            <p>As for the opinion, or notion of thoſe, who conceive that God deſigneth nothing, acteth nothing (in ſtrictneſs and propriety of conſideration) for himſelf, or for his
<pb facs="tcp:37346:44"/>
own Glory, ultimately; but all for the good and benefit of his Creature: I ſhall not upon this occaſion, either plead, or implead it; only I ſhall crave leave to ſay this, that as far as I have yet looked into it, and converſed with it, I do not find it ſo extravagant, or uncouth, or ſo hard of reconcilement, either with the Scriptures, where they ſeem moſt contradicting it, or with any the received grounds or principles of Chriſtian Religion, as I ſuppoſe it is like to ſeem unto many at its firſt appearance and hearing. And though there may be more in the opinion, were it nar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rowly examined and ſcan'd, from the one end of it unto the other, as well for the glory of God, as for the benefit and comfort of the Creature, yet becauſe ſuch an examina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of it may haply require a juſt Treatiſe, and more of the ordinary rank of Profeſſors are more like to be ſtart<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led or amazed at it, then to embrace it, I ſhall therefore forbear to encumber the commonly received Doctrine concerning the finall Cauſe, or ultimate end of Juſtifica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, with any further mention of it.</p>
            <p>
               <note place="margin">The Conclu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion.</note> Thus we have ſhewed, how great a number, and what variety, as well of things, as of perſons, there are, all, both of the one kind, and the other, joyning hand in hand, and making (as it were) one ſhoulder to bring the great bleſſing of Juſtification upon the head of a poor ſinner. God, who is <hi>wonderfull in counſell, and excellent in working,</hi> 
               <note n="a" place="margin">Iſa. 28, 29.</note>judged it meet, that a matter of ſo gracious and rare, of ſo profound and wonderfull a contrivance, ſhould paſs through many hands, before his Creature, Man, to whom it was meant and intended, ſhould be inveſted with the actuall poſſeſſion and enjoyment of it. There is ſcarce a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny thing of a more humbling conſideration to the height and pride of the Spirit of a man, then to be ſubjected to a multiplicity of dependences, eſpecially upon ſuch, either perſons, or things, which he either judgeth but equal un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to, but moſt of all, if beneath himſelf, for the obtaining of that, of which he ſtands in need, and without which, he fully underſtands that it cannot be well with him. Such
<pb facs="tcp:37346:44"/>
a poſture, or ſubjection as this, ſets him of<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

               </gap> at the great<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eſt diſtance in his condition from God in point of true Greatneſs and Glory. Nor is there any thing in all the unlimited circumference of the bleſſedneſs of God, that renders him greater, or more glorious in the eyes of his Creature, then his <gap reason="foreign">

               </gap>, or ſelf ſufficiency, and his abſolute independency upon all, whether perſons, or things whatſoever, beſides himſelf. And (doubtleſs) in ſuch caſes, where the number of dependencies is not eſta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bliſhed by any indiſpenſable Law, or Decree of God, they that can contract themſelves to the ſmaller number of them, for the enjoyment of themſelves with comfort and contentment, will reduce their preſent conditions to the neareſt affinity, whereof it is capable, with the bleſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſedneſs of God himſelf. But where God hath by any re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vealed appointment, or declared will, ſuſpended the at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainment of any ſpirituall enjoyment, priviledge, or bleſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing, upon mens application of themſelves unto him in the uſe of ſuch and ſuch means, of what number, or kind ſoever, their non-ſubjection to this Law, or appoint<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of his in the neglect of any one of theſe means, is of a very dangerous and ſad preſage, that they will fall ſhort in the attainment of the bleſſing. And for this rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon my Soul cannot but ſadly lament over the caſe and condition, of all thoſe, who have in the ignorance, vanity, and pride of their Spirits, turn'd their backs upon the Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſtry of the Goſpel, ſetting their Faces towards Fancies and conceited Methods of their own (though of Satans Inſpiration) for their juſtification in the ſight of God; whereas it hath been evidently ſhewed and proved from the Mouth of Godhimſelf, that amongſt thoſe various A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctors in and about, the great buſineſs of Juſtification, which have been preſented upon the Theater of this brief Diſcourſe, he hath aſſigned a worthy co-operation, or part, unto the Miniſtry, and Miniſters of the Goſpel. Therefore they, who diſdain to have the royall Robe of

Righteouſneſs, or Juſtification, put upon them by men of this Function and Office, as judging them unworthy, and too mean to ſerve them in ſo high and ſacred a Concern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, for any hope that I am able, upon any good ground, to give them of a better Iſſue, they are never like to wear it.</p>
