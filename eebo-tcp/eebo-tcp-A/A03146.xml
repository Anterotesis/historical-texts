            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

<pb facs="tcp:4215:3"/>deserves to be recorded amongst the
principall Monuments of your <hi>zeale</hi>
and <hi>pietie.</hi> Of the two great and

although <hi>prophanenesse,</hi> in it

is more spreading, and
more quicke of growth. In such a
<hi>Church</hi> as this, so setled in a con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stant
practise of <hi>Religious Offices,</hi>
and so confirmed by godly <hi>Canons,</hi>
for the performance of the same:
there was no feare, that ever the
<hi>Lords Day,</hi> (the day appointed
by Gods <hi>Church</hi> for his <hi>publike
service</hi>) would have beene over-runne
by the <hi>prophane</hi> neglect of any
pious duties, on that day required.
Rather the danger was, lest by the
violent torrent of some mens affecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons,
it might have beene ore-flowne
<pb facs="tcp:4215:3"/>by those <hi>superstitions;</hi> wherewith,
in imitation of the <hi>Iewes,</hi> they be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gan

it farre more burdensome to their
<hi>christian</hi> Brethren, than was the
<hi>Sabbath</hi> to the <hi>Israelites,</hi> by the
Law of <hi>MOSES.</hi> Nor know wee
where they would have staid, had
not your Maiestie been pleased, out
of a tender care of the <hi>Churches</hi>
safetie, to give a checke to their pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceedings;
in <hi>licencing</hi> on that day,
those <hi>Lawfull Pastimes,</hi> which some,
without authority from Gods Word,
or from the practise of Gods Church,
had of late restrained. Yet so it is,
your Maiesties most <hi>pious,</hi> and most
<hi>Christian</hi> purpose, hath not found
answerable entertainment; especi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally
amongst those men, who have so
long <hi>dreamt</hi> of a <hi>Sabbath</hi> day, that
<pb facs="tcp:4215:4"/>now they will not be perswaded, that
it is a <hi>Dreame.</hi> For the awakening
of the which, and their reduction to
more sound and sensible counsailes,
(next to my duty to <hi>Gods Church,</hi>
and your sacred Maiestie) have I
applyed my selfe to compose this
<hi>Story;</hi> wherein I doubt not but to
shew them, how much they have de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived
both themselves and others,
in making the old <hi>Iewish Sabbath,</hi>
of equall age and observation with
the <hi>Law</hi> of <hi>Nature:</hi> and preaching
their new <hi>Sabbath doctrines</hi> in the
<hi>Church</hi> of <hi>Christ,</hi> with which the
<hi>church</hi> hath no acquaintance; wher<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in
I doubt not but to shew them, that
by their obstinate resolution, not to
make <hi>publication</hi> of your Maie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sties
pleasure, they tacitely con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demne,
not onely all the <hi>Fathers</hi>
                           <pb facs="tcp:4215:4"/>of the <hi>primitive</hi> times: the learned

but even <hi>all states</hi> of <hi>Men,
Nations,</hi> and <hi>Churches,</hi> at this

This makes your Maiesties inte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rest
so particular in this present <hi>Hi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>storie,</hi>
that were I not obliged unto

and the direction of <hi>Gods people</hi> in the

A <hi>Story</hi> which shall represent unto you the <hi>con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stant
practise</hi> of <hi>Gods Church</hi> in the present busines,
from the <hi>Creation</hi> to these daies: that so you may
the better see, how you are gone astray from the
paths of <hi>truth,</hi> and tendries of <hi>Antiquity,</hi> and from
the present judgement of all <hi>Men</hi> and <hi>Churches.</hi>
The <hi>Arguments</hi> whereto you trust, and upon see<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ming
strength whereof you have beene embold<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned
to presse these <hi>Sabbatarian Doctrines</hi> upon the

                        <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>

They have beene elsewhere throughly
canvassed, and all those seeming strengths beate
<pb facs="tcp:4215:6"/>downe, by which you were your selves misgui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded;
and by the which you have since wrought
on the affections of unlearned men, or such at
least, that judged not of them by their weight,
but by their numbers. But where you give it
out, as in <hi>matter</hi> of <hi>fact,</hi> how that the <hi>Sabbath</hi> was
ordained by <hi>God</hi> in <hi>Paradise,</hi> and kept according<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
by all the <hi>Patriarkes,</hi> before <hi>Moses</hi> time; or
otherwise ingraft by <hi>nature</hi> in the soule of man,
and so in use also amongst the <hi>Gentiles:</hi> in that,
I have adventured to let men see, that you are
very much mistaken, and tell us things directly
contrary unto <hi>truth</hi> of <hi>Story.</hi> Next, where it is the
ground-worke of all your building, that the
<hi>Commandement</hi> of the <hi>Sabbath,</hi> is <hi>morall, naturall,</hi>
and <hi>perpetuall;</hi> as punctually to be observed, as
any other of the first or second Table: I doubt
not but it will appeare by this following <hi>History,</hi>
that it was never so esteemed of by the <hi>Iewes</hi>
themselves; no not when as the observation of
the same, was most severely pressed upon them
by the <hi>Law</hi> and <hi>Prophets,</hi> nor when the day was
made most burdensome unto them, by the <hi>Scribes</hi>
and <hi>Pharisees.</hi> Lastly, whereas you make the
<hi>Lords day</hi> to be an institution of our Saviour <hi>Christ,</hi>
confirmed by the continuall usage of the holy
<hi>Apostles,</hi> and both by him and them imposed, as
a perpetuall ordinance, on the <hi>Christian Church;</hi>
making your selves beleeve, that so it was obser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved
in the times before, as you have taught us to
observe it in these latter dayes: I have made ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nifest
to the world, that there is no such matter
<pb facs="tcp:4215:6"/>to be found at all, either in any writings of the <hi>A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>postles,</hi>
or monument of true <hi>Antiquity,</hi> or in the
practise of the middle or the present <hi>Churches:</hi>
What said I, of the present <hi>Churches?</hi> so I said
indeed; and doubt not but it will appeare so in
this following <hi>Storie:</hi> the present <hi>Churches,</hi> all
of them, both <hi>Greeke</hi> and <hi>Latin,</hi> together with the

follow; but they found <hi>Calvin,</hi> and <hi>Geneva,</hi> and
those other <hi>Churches,</hi> directly contrary unto them.

                  <p>For you my Brethren, and beloved in our <hi>Lord</hi>
and <hi>Saviour,</hi> as I doe willingly beleeve, that you
have entertain'd these <hi>tenets</hi> upon <hi>misperswasion,</hi>
not out of any ill intentions to the <hi>Church,</hi> your
Mother; and that it is an errour in your judge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments
onely, not of your affections: so upon
<pb facs="tcp:4215:7"/>
that beliefe, have I spared no paines, as much as
in me is, to remove that errour, and rectifie what
is amisse in your opinion. I hope you are not of
those men, <hi>Quos non persuadebis, etiamsi persuaseris,</hi>
who either hate to be reformed; or have so farre
espoused a quarrell, that neither truth nor reason,
can divorce them from it. Nor would I gladly
you should be of their resolutions, <hi>Qui volunt id
verum esse quod credunt, nolunt id credere quod verum
est;</hi> who are more apt to thinke all true which
themselves beleeve, than be perswaded to beleeve
such things as are true indeed. In confidence
whereof, as I was first induced to compose this
<hi>Historie;</hi> so in continuance of those hopes, I
have presumed to addresse it to you, to tender it
to your perusall, and to submit it to your censure:
that if you are not better furnished, you may
learne from hence, that you have trusted more
unto other men, than you had just reason. It is
my chiefe endeavour, as it is my prayer, that
possibly I may <hi>behold Ierusalem in prosperity, all my

some of you at the least, to such conformity
with the <hi>practise</hi> of the <hi>Catholicke Church;</hi> that

                        </gap>rity,</hi> which
I so desire. This that I may the better doe, I
shall present you, as I said, with the true <hi>Story</hi> of
the <hi>Sabbath:</hi> and therin lay before your eyes, both
what the <hi>Doctrine</hi> was, and what the <hi>practise,</hi> of all
former times; and how it stands in both respects,
with all <hi>Gods Churches,</hi> at this present. First, for
<pb facs="tcp:4215:7"/>the <hi>Sabbath,</hi> I shall shew you, that it was not <hi>in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stituted</hi>
by the <hi>Lord</hi> in <hi>Paradise,</hi> nor <hi>naturally</hi> im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>printed
in the <hi>soule</hi> of man, nor ever kept by any
of the <hi>antient Fathers,</hi> before <hi>Moses</hi> time: and
this, not generally said, and no more but so; but
proved particularly and successively, in a continu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
descent of times and men. Next, that being
given unto the <hi>Iewes</hi> by <hi>Moses,</hi> it was not so <hi>obser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved</hi>
or reckned of, as any of the <hi>morall precepts;</hi>
but sometimes kept, and sometimes not; accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding
as mens private businesses, or the necessi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties
of the state, might give way unto it: and
finally was for ever abrogated, with the other
<hi>ce<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                           <desc>•</desc>
                        </gap>emonies,</hi> at the destruction of the <hi>Temple.</hi> As
for the <hi>Gentiles</hi> all this while, it shall hereby ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peare,
that they tooke no more notice of it, (ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cept
a little, at the latter end of the <hi>Iewish State</hi>)
than to deride both it, and all them that kept it.
Then for the <hi>Lords day,</hi> that it was not instituted
by our Saviour <hi>Christ,</hi> commanded by the <hi>Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stles,</hi>
or ordained first by any other <hi>authority,</hi> than
the <hi>voluntary consecration</hi> of it, by the <hi>Church,</hi> to
<hi>religious uses:</hi> and being consecrated to those u<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ses,
was not <hi>advanced</hi> to that <hi>esteeme,</hi> which it now
enjoyes, but <hi>leisurely</hi> and by <hi>degrees,</hi> partly by the
<hi>Edicts</hi> of sec<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

                     </gap>lar <hi>Princes,</hi> partly by <hi>Canons</hi> of par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticular
<hi>Councels,</hi> and finally by the <hi>Decretals</hi> of
severall <hi>Popes,</hi> and <hi>
                        <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

                        </gap>rders</hi> of inferiour <hi>Prelates:</hi>
and being so advanced, is <hi>subject</hi> still, as many
Protestant <hi>Doctors</hi> say, to the <hi>Authority</hi> of the
<hi>Church,</hi> to be <hi>retained,</hi> or <hi>changed,</hi> as the <hi>Church</hi>
thinkes fit. Finally, that in all <hi>Ages</hi> heretofore,
<pb facs="tcp:4215:8"/>
                     <gap reason="duplicate" extent="1 page">

                     </gap>
                     <pb facs="tcp:4215:9"/>
and in all <hi>Churches</hi> at this present, it neither was
nor is esteemed of as a <hi>Sabbath day:</hi> nor reckned
of so neere a kin to the former <hi>Sabbath,</hi> but that
at all such leisure times, as were not destinate by
the <hi>Church</hi> to <hi>Gods</hi> publike <hi>service;</hi> men might
apply their mindes and bestow their thoughts,
either about their <hi>businesses,</hi> or upon their <hi>plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sures,</hi>
such as are <hi>lawfull</hi> in themselves, and not
prohibited by those powers, under which they
lived. Which shewed and manifestly proved
unto you, I doubt not but those <hi>paper-walls,</hi> which
have beene raised heretofore to defend these <hi>Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrines,</hi>
how faire soever they may seeme to the
outward eye, and whatsoever colours have beene
laid upon them; will in the end appeare unto you
to be but <hi>paper-walls</hi> indeed: some beaten downe

have successively beene <hi>mounted</hi> in the <hi>Church</hi> of
<hi>God;</hi> either to fortifie the <hi>Lords day,</hi> which it

sanctified it, because that in it hee had rested from all his
worke, which God created and made.</hi> Vnto this passage of
the text, and this point of time, some have referred the
<hi>institution</hi> and <hi>originall</hi> of the <hi>Sabbath;</hi> taking these
words to be a plain narration of a thing then done, accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding
to that very time, wherein the Scripture doth re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>port
it: And that the <hi>sanctifying</hi> of the <hi>seventh day</hi> there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in
mentioned, was a Commandement given by God to
our Father <hi>Adam,</hi> touching the <hi>sanctifyng</hi> of that <hi>day</hi> to
his publick worship. Conceiving also that there is some
speciall <hi>mystery</hi> and <hi>morality</hi> in the number of <hi>seven,</hi> for
which that day, and none but that, could be designed and
set apart for this employment. Others and those the an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cienter,
and of more authority, conceive these words to
have been spoken by a <hi>Prolepsis</hi> or <hi>Anticipation;</hi> and to
relate unto the times wherein <hi>Moses</hi> wrote. And that it
was an intimation onely of the reason why God imposed
upon the <hi>Iewes,</hi> the sanctifying rather of the <hi>seventh day,</hi>
then of any other: no precept to that purpose being gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven
to <hi>Adam</hi> and to his posterity; nor any mystery in
that number, why of it selfe it should be thought most
proper for Gods publick service. The perfect stating of
these points, will give great light to the following sto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry.
And therefore wee will first crave leave to remoove
these doubts before we come to matter of fact, that after<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards
I may proceed with the greater <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                              <desc>•</desc>

and satisfaction to the Reader. The ground-worke or
foundation laid, the building will be raysed the surer.</p>
                        <p>(2) And first it is conceived by many learned men,
that <hi>Moses</hi> in the second of <hi>Genesis</hi> relates unto the times
in the which hee lived, and wrote the History of the
Creation: when God had now made known his holy will
unto him, and the Commandement of the <hi>Sabbath</hi> had
by his Ministery been delivered to the house of <hi>Israel.</hi>
This is indeed the ancienter and more generall tendry,
unanimously delivered both by <hi>Iew</hi> and <hi>Christian;</hi> and
not so much as questioned til these later dayes. And how<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>soever
<pb n="4" facs="tcp:4215:24"/>
some ascribe it to <hi>Tostatus,</hi> as to the first inventer
of it; yet is it ancienter farre then he: though were it so, it
could not be denyed, but that it had an able and a learned
Author. A man, considering the times in which he lived,
and the short time of life it pleased God to give him; that
hardly ever had his equall.<note place="margin">I<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                                 <desc>•</desc>
                              </gap> Gen. 2.</note> Its true, <hi>Tostatus</hi> thus resolues
it. He makes this <hi>quaere</hi> first, <hi>Num Sabbatum cum à Deo
sanctificatum fuerit in primordio mundi rerum, &amp;c.</hi> Whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
the <hi>Sabbath</hi> being sanctified by God in the first in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fancy
of the World, had beene observed of men, by the
<hi>Law of nature.</hi> And thereunto returns this answere, <hi>quod
Deus non dederit praceptum illud de observatione Sabbati
in principio, sed per</hi> Mosen <hi>datum esse, &amp;c.</hi> That God
commanded not the <hi>Sabbath</hi> to be sanctified in the be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginning
of the World, but that it was commanded after<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards
by the Law of <hi>Moses;</hi> when God did publickly
make known his will upon Mount <hi>Sinai.</hi> And that wheras
the Scripture speaketh of <hi>sanctifying the seventh day,</hi> in the
second of <hi>Genesis,</hi> it is not to be understood, as if the Lord
did then appoint it, for his publick worship; but is to be
referred unto the time wherein <hi>Moses</hi> wrote, which was
in the Wildernesse. <hi>Et sic</hi> Moses <hi>intendebat dicere quod
Deus illum diem sanctificavit sc. nobis, &amp;c.</hi> And so the
meaning of the Prophet will be briefly this, that God did
sanctifie that day, that it to us, to us that are his people of
the house of <hi>Iacob,</hi> that we might consecrate it to his ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vice.
So farre <hi>Tostatus.</hi> In which I must confesse, that I
see not any thing, but what <hi>Iosephus</hi> said before him,
though in other words: who speaking of the Worlds
Creation, doth conclude it thus, <gap reason="foreign">

                           </gap>, &amp;c. <hi>So
that</hi> Moses <hi>saith,</hi>
                           <note place="margin">Antiqu. l. 1. 2.</note> 
                           <hi>that the World and all that is therein was
made in six whole dayes and that upon the seventh day God
took rest, and ceased from his labours.</hi>
                           <gap reason="foreign">
                              <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>

whereof wee likewise desist from travaile on that day,
which we call the Sabbath, i. e. repose.</hi> So that the institu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
of the <hi>Sabbath</hi> by <hi>Tostatus;</hi> and the observation of
<pb n="5" facs="tcp:4215:24"/>
it, by <hi>Iosephus;</hi> are both of them referred, by their <hi>us,</hi> and
<hi>wee,</hi> unto the times of <hi>Moses,</hi> and the house of <hi>Israel.</hi>
Nor is <hi>Iosephus</hi> the only learned man amongst the <hi>Iewes,</hi>
that so interpreteth <hi>Moses</hi> meaning <hi>Solomon Iarchi,</hi> one
of the principall of the <hi>Rabbins</hi> speaks more expresly to
this purpose; and makes this Glosse or Comment upon
<hi>Moses</hi> words<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>

of the week, an <hi>Homer</hi> of it fell upon the earth, &amp; a double

fell not on the seventh day at al. <hi>Et scriptura loquitur de re<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>futura.</hi>
And in this place (saith he) the Scripture speaks as
of a thing that was to come. But what need more be said.
<hi>Mercer</hi> a learned <hi>Protestant,</hi>
                           <note place="margin">In Gen. 2.</note> &amp; one much co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>versant in the
<hi>Rabbins,</hi> co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>fesseth that the <hi>Rabbins</hi> generally referred this
place &amp; passage to the <hi>following times,</hi> even to the sancti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fication
of the <hi>Sabbath,</hi> established by the Law of <hi>Moses.
Hebreifere ad futuru<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> referunt, i.e. sanctificationem Sabbati
postea lege per</hi> Mosen <hi>sancitam: unde &amp; Manna eo die non
descendit.</hi> And howsoever for his own part, he is of opi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion,
that the first Fathers being taught by God, kept the
seventh day holy: yet he conceives withall, that the <hi>Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mandement</hi>
of keeping holy the <hi>Sabbath day,</hi> was not
made till afterwards. <hi>Nam hinc</hi> (from Gods own resting
on that day) <hi>postea praeceptum de Sabbato natum est,</hi> as hee
there hath it. Doubtlesse, the <hi>Iewes,</hi> who so much doted
on their <hi>Sabbath,</hi> would not by any means have robbed
it of so great antiquity; had they had any ground to ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prove
thereof, or not known the contrary. So that the
scope of <hi>Moses</hi> in this present place, was not to shew the
time <hi>when;</hi> but the occasion, <hi>why</hi> the Lord did <hi>after</hi> san<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctity
the <hi>seventh day</hi> for a <hi>Sabbath day: viz.</hi> because that
<hi>on that day he rested from the works which he had created.</hi>
                        </p>
                        <p>(3) Nor was it otherwise conceived, then that <hi>Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ses</hi>
here did speak by way of <hi>Prolepsis,</hi> or <hi>Anticipation,</hi> till
<hi>Ambrose Catharin,</hi> one of the great sticklers in the <hi>Trent-Councell,</hi>
opined the contrary. Hee in his Comment on
<pb n="6" facs="tcp:4215:25"/>
that text fals very foule upon <hi>Tostatus;</hi> and therein leads
the dance to others, who have since taken up the same o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pinion.

                           <q>It

                              <note place="margin">In Gen. 2.</note> (as a certain Writer
fancieth) the sanctification of that day which <hi>Moses</hi>
speaks of, should not be true as of that very point of
time whereof he speaks it, but rather is to be referred
unto the time wherein he wrote: as if the meaning
onely were, that then it should be <hi>sanctified</hi> when it
was ordered and appointed by the Law of <hi>Moses.</hi>
                           </q>
And this he calls <hi>Commentum ineptum, &amp; contra literam

Behold, saith he, how that which was not done as yet,

for the purpose, <hi>Origen</hi> on the first of <hi>Genesis,</hi> and <hi>Gre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gory</hi>
the <hi>Great, Moral. lib. 32. cap.</hi> 9. both which take no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tice

For the creation of the woman he brings in Saint <hi>Ierome,</hi>

assents, and thinks that thereupon the Lord is said to
have finished all his works on the seventh day; that being
the last that he created. This seemes indeed to be the old
tradition, if it be lawfull for me to digresse a little: it be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing

If so, if God himselfe did breake the <hi>Sabbath,</hi> as Saint
<hi>Hierome</hi> turns upon the <hi>Iewes:</hi> wee have small cause to

<hi>Church</hi> is still disquieted. He determines thus. <q>I deny
saith he, but that the Scripture speaketh often of things,
as though they had been so before, because they were
so then, when the things were written. As when it is
said of <hi>Abraham,</hi> that <hi>hee remooved unto a Mountaine
Eastward of Bethel,</hi> whereas it was not called <hi>Bethel</hi>
till above a hundred yeares after. The like may be said
of another place in the Booke of <hi>Iudges</hi> called <hi>Bochin,</hi>
&amp;c. yet in this place of <hi>Genesis</hi> it is not so. And why
not so in this, as well as those? Because (saith he) <hi>Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ses</hi>
entreateth there of the sanctification of the Sabbath,
not onely because it was so then when hee wrote that

the contrary whereof is already proved. After more
warily, and in particular, <hi>de hujusmodi institutione Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leptica,</hi>
that no such <hi>institution</hi> is set down in <hi>Scripture,</hi>
by way of a <hi>Prolepsis</hi> or <hi>Anticipation,</hi> either in that Book,
<pb n="9" facs="tcp:4215:26"/>
or in any other. And herein, as before I said, he is not like
to find any seconds. We find it in the sixteenth of <hi>Exo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dus,</hi>

that <hi>as the Lord commanded</hi> Moses,<note place="margin">Vers. 34.</note> 
                           <hi>so</hi> Aaron <hi>laid it up

the place affirmes expresly, that it is spoken there <hi>per

<hi>children of Israel did eat Mannah forty yeares,</hi>
                           <note place="margin">Vers. 35.</note> which is

We co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>clude then, that for this passage of the Scripture, we

find not any thing unto the contrary, but that it was set
down in that place and time, by a plain and meer <hi>antici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pation;</hi>
and doth relate unto the time wherein <hi>Moses</hi>
wrote: And therefore no sufficient warrant to fetch the
<hi>institution</hi> of the <hi>Sabbath,</hi> from the <hi>first beginnings.</hi> One
onely thing I have to adde, and thats the reason which
moved <hi>Moses,</hi> to make this mention of the <hi>Sabbath,</hi> even
in the first beginning of the Booke of God, and so long
time before the <hi>institution</hi> of the same. Which doubtlesse
was, the better to excite the <hi>Iewes</hi> to observe that day,
from which they seemed at first to be much averse: and
therefore were not onely to be minded of it, by a <hi>Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mento</hi>
in the front of the Commandement; but by an inti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mation
of the <hi>equity</hi> and <hi>reason</hi> of it, even in the entrance

though some have laboured what they could, to make the

that he hath alleaged, to prove the observation of the

particularly, I will make bold to lay before you some two
or three; that so out of <hi>the mouthes of two or three witnes<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ses

<hi>Tertullian,</hi>
                           <note place="margin">Adv. Iudaeos.</note> who resolves it thus. <hi>Namque in principio

                           <q>In the beginning
of the World, the Lord commanded <hi>Adam</hi> and <hi>Eue</hi>
that they <hi>should not eat of the fruit of the tree, which is

been sufficient for their justification, had it been obser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved.

which afterwards were given by <hi>Moses.</hi>
                           </q>

&amp;c. the first Commandement given by <hi>God</hi> to <hi>A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dam,</hi>
was that he should not eate of the tree of know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge.
The very same, which is affirmed by <hi>Saint Am<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brose</hi>
in another language,<note place="margin">Lib. de Elia &amp; jejunio c.<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

both of <hi>African,</hi> the <hi>Easterne,</hi> and the <hi>Westerne</hi> Churches.
If so, if that the <hi>law of abstinence</hi> had been <hi>alone</hi> sufficient
for the justification of our Father <hi>Adam,</hi> as <hi>Tertullian
thinks;</hi> or if it were the <hi>first law,</hi> given by God unto him,
as both <hi>Saint Basil</hi> and <hi>Saint Ambrose</hi> are of opinion: then
was there no such law at all then made, as that of <hi>sancti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fying
of the Sabbath;</hi> or else not made according to that
time and order, wherein this passage of the Scripture is
laid down by <hi>Moses.</hi> And if not then, there is no other
ground for this <hi>Commandement</hi> in the Booke of God, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
the wandring of Gods people in the Wildernesse,
and the fall of <hi>Mannah.</hi> A thing so cleere, that some of
those, who willingly would have the <hi>Sabbath</hi> to have bin
kept from the first Creation; and have not the confidence
to ascribe the keeping of it, to any ordinance of God, but
onely to the voluntary imitation of his people. And this

                           <q>First,
saith the Doctor,<note place="margin">Ib. p. 69.</note> I doe not see that proved, that there
is any such mysticall signification, rather than of any
other. And though that were granted, yet doe I not
find that to be any cause at all in Scripture, why the

then the <hi>sixth,</hi> or <hi>eighth.</hi> And in the former page.
The speciall reason why the <hi>seventh day</hi> should be ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
kept than any other, is not the <hi>excellencie or per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fection</hi>
of that <hi>number,</hi> or that there is any mystery in
it, or that God delighteth more in it, than in any other:
though, I confesse (saith hee) that much is said that

<hi>two</hi> feet, <hi>two</hi> hands, <hi>two</hi> armes. There were <hi>two</hi> Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions

from whence so many heresies had their first
originall. For oftentimes (that out of our abundance
we may fit their fancies) wee finde the even or equall
number no lesse commemorated in holy Scripture, as
when God sent out his Disciples by <hi>two,</hi> and <hi>two:</hi>
when he chose <hi>twelve</hi> Apostles, and left <hi>foure</hi> Evange<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lists.
But these things it were needles to suggest to you,

to stop your eares against such follies.
Saint <hi>Augustine</hi> also, though hee had descanted a while
upon the mysteries of this number:<note place="margin">De Civil. Dei, l. 11. c. 31.</note> yet he cuts off him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selfe,
in the very middle, as it were, <hi>Ne scientiolam
suam leviter magis quam utiliter, jactare velle videa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tur;</hi>
lest hee should seeme to shew his reading, with
more pride, then profit. And thereupon he gives this
excellent rule, which I could wish had beene more pra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctised
in this case; <hi>Habenda est itaque ratio moderatio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nis
&amp; gravitatis, ne forte cum de numero multum loqui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mur,
mensuram &amp; pondus negligere judicemur.</hi> Wee
must not take, saith hee, so much heed of numbers,
that wee forget at the last, both weight and measure.
And this wee should the rather doe, because that gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rally
there is no rule layd downe, or any reason to be gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven
in nature, why some particular numbers have been
set apart for particular uses, when other numbers might
have served: why <hi>Hiericho</hi> should be rather compassed
<hi>seven</hi> times, then <hi>sixe</hi> or <hi>eight;</hi> why <hi>Abraham</hi> rather
trained three hundred and eighteene of his servants, then
three hundred and twenty; or why his servant tooke
ten Camels with him into <hi>Padan Aram,</hi> and not more or
lesse: with infinite others of this kind in the <hi>Law Leviti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>call.</hi>
Yet I deny not, but that some reason may be given,
why in the Scripture, things are so often ordered by <hi>se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vens</hi>
and <hi>sevens: viz<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>

from doing his Fathers businesse, <hi>ne Sabbatis quidem,</hi>
no though it were upon the Sabbath. By which it see<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>meth,
that when the Sabbath was observed, and that if

still it were in force, it was not then, and would not be un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lawfull
unto any now, to look to his estate on the Sabbath
day, and to take care that all things thrive and prosper
which belong unto him: though he increase it not, or
adde thereto by following, on that day, the workes of
his daily labour. And this according to their rules, who
would have Gods example so exactly followed, in the
Sabbaths rest: who rested, as we see, from creation one<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly,
not from preservation. So that the rest here mentio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned,
was as before I said, no more then a cessation or a

that I have met with, untill <hi>Zanchies</hi> time. Indeed hee
tels us, a large story of his owne making, how God the

                           <q>(I will speake onely what I thinke, without

the Sonne of God, taking the shape of man upon him
was busied all this day in most holy conferences with
<hi>Adam;</hi> that he made known himselfe both to him, and
<hi>Eve;</hi> taught them the order that he used in the Worlds
creation; exhorted them to meditate on those glorious
works; in them to prayse the Name of God, acknow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledging
him for their Creatour; &amp; after his example, to
spend that day for ever, in these pious exercises. I doubt
not, finally, saith hee, but that hee taught them on that
<pb n="29" facs="tcp:4215:36"/>
day the whole body of divinity: and that he held them
busied all day long, in hearing him, and celebrating
with due prayses their Lord and God; and giving

Such strange conceptions, though they miscarry not in
the birth: yet commonly they serve to no other use, then
monsters in the works of nature, to be seen and shewne;
with wonder at all times, and sometimes with pitie. Had
such a thing occurred in <hi>Pet. Comestors supplement,</hi> which
he made unto the Bible, it had been more tolerable. The
<hi>Legendaries</hi> and the <hi>Rabbins</hi> might fairely also have been
excused, if any such devise had been extant in them. The
gravity of the man makes the tale more pittifull, though
never the more to be regarded. For certainly, had there
been such a weighty conference between God and Man;

observe it, before the Law. These two I have the rather
cited, because they have beene often vouched in the pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>like
controversie, as men that wished well to the cause,
and say somewhat in it.</p>
                        <p>(5) We are now come unto particulars. And first we
must begin with the first man <hi>Adam.</hi> The time of his
Creation as the Scriptures tels us, the sixt day of the week,
being as <hi>Scaliger</hi> conjectured in the first Edition of his
Worke,<note place="margin">Emend. temp. l. 5.</note> the three and twentieth day of <hi>Aprill;</hi> and so the
first <hi>Sabbath, Sabbatum primum,</hi> so hee calls it, was the
foure and twentieth.<note place="margin">Doctrina temp. l 4 c. 6</note> 
                           <hi>Petavius,</hi> by his computation, makes
the first <hi>Sabbath</hi> to be the first day of <hi>November;</hi> and
<hi>Scaliger,</hi> in his last Edition, the five and twentieth of
<hi>October:</hi> more neere to one another then before they
were. Yet saith not <hi>Scaliger,</hi> that that <hi>primum Sabbatum</hi>
had any reference to <hi>Adam,</hi> though first he left it so at
large, that probably some might so conceive it: for in his
later thoughts he declares his meaning to be this, <hi>Sabba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tum
primum in quo Deus requievit ab opere Hexa<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                                 <desc>•</desc>

Indeed the <hi>Chaldee paraphrase</hi> seemes to affirme of <hi>A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dam,</hi>
that he kept the <hi>Sabbath.</hi> For where the 92 Psalme
doth beare this Title, <hi>A Song or Psalme for the Sabbath
day:</hi> the Authors of that <hi>paraphrase</hi> doe expound it thus,
<hi>Laus &amp; Canticum quod dixit homo primus pro die Sabbati,</hi>
the Song or Psalme which <hi>Adam</hi> said for the <hi>Sabbath</hi>
day. Somewhat more wary in this point was <hi>Rabbi
Kimchi,</hi> who tels us how that <hi>Adam</hi> was created upon
Friday about three of the clocke; fell at eleven, was
censured and driven out of <hi>Paradise</hi> at twelve, that all the
residue of that day, and the following night he bemoned
his miseries; was taken into grace next morning, being
<hi>Sabbath</hi> day; and taking then into consideration all the
works of God, brake out into such words as those, al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>though
<pb n="34" facs="tcp:4215:39"/>
though not the same. A tale that hath as much foundati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on,
as that narration of <hi>Zanchie,</hi> before remembred. Who
though he seeme to put the matter out of doubt with his
three <hi>non dubito's,</hi> that <hi>Christ</hi> himselfe did sanctifie the
first <hi>Sabbath,</hi> with our Father <hi>Adam;</hi> and did command
him ever after to observe that day: yet in another place, he
makes it onely a matter of probability, that the comman<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dement
of the <hi>Sabbath,</hi>

So easily doth he overthrow his former structure.
But to return unto the <hi>Rabbins,</hi> and this dreame of theirs,
Besides the strangenesse of the thing, that <hi>Adam</hi> should
continue not above eight houres in Paradise, and yet give

And so <hi>Tertullian</hi> in a Treatise written against the <hi>Iewes,</hi>

he offered <hi>Sacrifice:</hi> but yet the Scriptures do not tell us,
that in his Sacrifices he had more regard unto the <hi>seventh
day,</hi> then to any other. To offer Sacrifice, he might learne
of <hi>Adam,</hi> or of naturall reason, which doth sufficiently
instruct us, that we ought all to make some publick testi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mony
of our subjection to the Lord. But neither <hi>Adam</hi>
did observe the <hi>Sabbath,</hi> nor could <hi>nature</hi> teach it, as be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore

have conjectured, and conjectured onely, that <hi>Abel</hi> in
his Sacrifices might have respect unto the <hi>Sabbath:</hi> yet
those whom we may better trust, have affirm'd the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary.
For <hi>Iustin Martyr</hi> disputing against <hi>Trypho,</hi> brings
<hi>Abel</hi> in for an example; that neither <hi>Circumcision</hi> nor the
<hi>Sabbath,</hi> the two great glories of the <hi>Iewes,</hi> were to be
counted necessary. For if they were, saith hee, God had
not had so much regard to <hi>Abels Sacrifice,</hi> being as hee

Deo,</hi> saith his first Edition. Which were enough
to cause some men, who infinitely admire his Dictates,
from thence to have derived a <hi>Sabbath:</hi> had hee not
changed his minde in the next Edition, and placed this
memorable action, not on the <hi>seventh</hi> day, but the <hi>fourth.</hi>
I say it might have caused some men, for all men would
not so have doted, as from a special accident to conclude a
<pb n="41" facs="tcp:4215:42"/>
practice. Considering especially that there is no ground
in Scripture to proove that those before the Law, had in
their Sacrifices any regard at all to set times and dayes;
either unto the sixt day, or the seventh, or eighth, or any
other: but did their service to the Lord, I mean the pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lick
part thereof, and that which did consist in externall
action, according as occasion was administred unto
them. The offerings of <hi>Cain</hi> and <hi>Abel,</hi> for ought we can
informe our selves, were not very frequent. The Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture
tels us that it was in <hi>processe of time;</hi>
                           <note place="margin">Gen 4. 3.</note> at the yeares
end as some expound it. For at the yeares end, as <hi>Ains<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>worth</hi>
noteth; men were wont in most solemne manner,
to offer <hi>sacrifice</hi> unto God, with thanks for all his bene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fits,
having then gathered in their fruits.<note place="margin">Exod. 23. 16.</note> The Law of <hi>Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ses</hi>
so commanded; the ancient Fathers so observed it, as
by this place we may conjecture: and so it was accusto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med
too among the <hi>Gentiles;</hi> their ancient Sacrifices and
their Assemblies to that purpose,<note place="margin">Ethic. l. 8.</note> (as <hi>Aristotle</hi> hath infor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med
us) being after the gathering in of fruits. No day
selected for that use, that we can heare of. This Sacrifice
of <hi>Noah,</hi> as it was remarkable, so it was occasionall: an
<hi>Eucharisticall Oblation</hi> for the great deliverance, which
did that day befall unto him. And had it hapned on the
seventh day, it were no argument that hee made choice
thereof as most fit and proper, or that he used to sacrifice
more upon that day, then on any other. So that of <hi>A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>braham</hi>
in the twelfth of <hi>Genesis,</hi> was occasionall only.
The Lord appeared to <hi>Abraham</hi> saying,<note place="margin">Gen. 12. 7.</note> 
                           <hi>unto thy seed will

that <hi>Abraham</hi> builded there an <hi>Altar unto the Lord,</hi>
who appeared unto him. The like hee did when hee first

                        <p>(2) To ruinate these vain attempts<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> it pleased the
Lord first to confound the language of the people, which
before was o<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                              <desc>•</desc>
                           </gap>e; and after to disperse them over all the
earth. By meanes of which dispersion, they could not
possibly have kept one and the same day for a <hi>Sabbath,</hi>
had it been commanded: the dayes in places of a different
<hi>longitude,</hi> which is the distance of a place from the first
<hi>Meridian,</hi> beginning at such different times, that no one
day could be precisely kept amongst them. The proofe
and ground whereof, I will make bold to borrow from
my late learned friend <hi>Natha: Carpenter;</hi> that I may
manifest in some sort the love I bore him: though pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bably
I might have furnished out this argument, from
mine own wardrope; at least have had recourse to many
other learned men, who have written of it. For that
the difference of time, is varied according to the diffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rence
of <hi>longitudes,</hi> in divers places of the earth may be
made manifest to every mans understanding, out of these
two principles: First, if the earth is sphaericall, and se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>condly,
that the Sunne doth compasse it about it twenty
foure houres. From hence it comes to passe, that places
<pb n="46" facs="tcp:4215:45"/>
situate <hi>Eastward</hi> see the Sunne sooner then those do, that
are placed <hi>Westward.</hi> And that with such a different pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portion
of time, that unto every houre of the <hi>Sunnes</hi> mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion,
there is assigned a certaine number of miles upon
the <hi>Earth:</hi> every fifteen degrees<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> which is the distance of
the <hi>Meridians,</hi> being computed to make one houre; and
every fifteene miles upon the earth, correspondent to one
minute of that houre. By this wee may perceive, how
soone the noon-tide hapneth in one City before another.
For if one City stands <hi>Eastward</hi> of another, the space of
three of the aforesaid <hi>Meridians,</hi> which is 2700. miles;
it is apparant that it will enjoy the noon-tyde, no lesse
then three houres before the other: and consequently in
10800. miles, which is halfe the compasse of the earth,
there will be found no lesse then twelve houres difference
in the rising and setting of the Sunne, as also in the noon
and midnight. The reason of which difference of times,
is as before we said the difference of <hi>longitudes,</hi> wherein
to every houre, <hi>Cosmographers</hi> have allotted fifteene de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>grees
in the Suns diurnall motion: so that fifteen degrees
being multiplied by twenty foure houres, which is the
naturall day, the product will be 360, which is the num<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber
of degrees in the whole circle. Now in these times,
wherein the sonnes of <hi>Noah</hi> dispersed themselves, in case
the <hi>Sabbath</hi> was to have been kept, as simply <hi>morall;</hi> it
must needs follow, that the <hi>morall Law</hi> is subject unto
manifold mutations and uncertainties, which must not be
granted. For spreading as they did over all the <hi>earth,</hi> some
farther, some at shorter distance; and thereby chang<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                              <desc>•</desc>
                           </gap>ng
<hi>Longitudes</hi> with their habitations: they must of meet ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cessity
alter the difference of times and daies, and so could
keepe no day together. Nor could their issue since their
time observe exactly and precisely the self-same <hi>day,</hi> by
reason of the manifold transportation of <hi>Colonies,</hi> and
transmigration of Nations from one Region to another;
whereby the times must of necessity be supposed to vary.
The Authour of the <hi>Practice of Pietie,</hi> though he plead
<pb n="47" facs="tcp:4215:45"/>
hard for the <hi>moralitie</hi> of the <q>
                              <hi>Sabbath,</hi> cannot but confesse,
that <hi>in respect of the diversitie of the Meridians, and the
unequall rising and setting of the Sunne, every day va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rieth
in some places a quarter, in some halfe, in others an
whole day: therefore the Iewish Sabbath cannot</hi> (saith he)
<hi>be precisely kept in the same instant of time, every where
in the World.</hi>
                           </q> Certainly if it cannot now, then it never
could: and then it will be found, that some at least of
<hi>Noahs</hi> posterity, and all that have from them descend<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                              <desc>•</desc>
                           </gap>d,
either did keep at all no <hi>Sabbath,</hi> or not upon the day ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pointed;
which comes all to one. Or else it needs must
follow that God imposed a Law upon his people, which
in it selfe without relation to the frailty, <hi>ne dum</hi> to the
iniquity of poore man, could not in possibility have been
observed: Yea, such a Law, as could not generally have
been kept, had <hi>Adam</hi> still continued in his perfect inno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cence.</p>
                        <p>(3) To make this matter yet more plaine, It is a <hi>Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rollary</hi>
or conclusion in <hi>Geographie,</hi> that if two men doe
take a journey from the self-same place, round about the
earth; the one <hi>Eastward,</hi> the other <hi>Westward,</hi> and meet
in the same place againe: it will appeare that hee which
hath gone <hi>East,</hi> hath gotten; and that the other going
<hi>Westward,</hi> hath lost a day, in their accompt. The reason
is, because hee that from any place assigned doth travaile
<hi>Eastward,</hi> moving continually against the proper motion
of the Sunne, will shorten somewhat of his day: taking so
much from it, as his journey in proportion of distance
from the place assigned, hath first opposed, and so antici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pated
in that time, the diurnall motion of the Sunne. So
daily gaining something from the length of day; it will a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mount
in the whole circuit of the Earth to twenty foure
houres, which are a perfect naturall day. The other go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
<hi>Westward,</hi> and seconding the course of the <hi>S<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

                           </gap> as much
proportionably, unto his day, as the other lost, and in the
end will lose a day in his accompt. For demonstration of
<pb n="48" facs="tcp:4215:46"/>
the which, suppose of these two Travellers, that the for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer
for every fifteen miles, should take away one minute
from the length of the day: and the latter adde as much
unto it, in the like proportion of his journey. Now by the
<hi>Golden Rule,</hi> if every fifteene miles substract or adde one
minute in the length of the day; then must 21600. miles,
which is the compasse of the Earth, adde or substract 1440
minutes, which make up twenty foure houres, a just na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turall

now in hand, suppose we that a <hi>Turk,</hi> a <hi>Iew,</hi> &amp; a <hi>Christian,</hi>

unto the <hi>Iew;</hi> and a <hi>Sunday</hi> to the <hi>Christian;</hi> in case
they calculate the time exactly, from their departure to
their returne. To prove this further, yet by a matter of
fact. The <hi>Hollanders</hi> in their Discovery of <hi>Fretu<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> le Maire,
Anno</hi> 1615.<note place="margin">1615.</note> found by comparing their accompt, at their

had trauailed <hi>Westward</hi> in that tedious Voyage:) that
which was <hi>Munday</hi> to the one, being the <hi>Sunday</hi> to the
other. And now what should these people do when they
were returnd? If they are bound by <hi>nature,</hi> and the <hi>mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rall
Law,</hi> to sanctifie precisely one day in <hi>seven,</hi> they must
then sanctifie a day a part from their other Countrymen;
and like a crew of <hi>Schismaticks,</hi> divide themselves from
the whole body of the Church: or to keepe order, and
comply with other men, must of necessity be forced to go
against the <hi>law of nature,</hi> or the <hi>morall law;</hi> which ought
not to be violated for any by-respect-whatever. But to

return unto <hi>Noahs</hi> sonnes, whom this case concernes; It
might, for ought we know, be theirs in this dispersion, in

And lastly, <hi>Rabbi Maimony,</hi> makes the matter yet

they neither could have time to rest, nor to keepe

                        <p>(9) Indeed it easily may be beleeved, that the people

that accused the <hi>Israelites</hi> to have been wanton, lazy, and

have done, had they desisted every <hi>seventh day</hi> from the
works imposed upon them. Doubtlesse, they had beene
carried to the house of Correction, if not worse handled.
I say in all that time they were not permitted to offer <hi>sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crifice</hi>
in that Country: and therefore when they purpo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed
to escape from thence,<note place="margin">Exod. 8.</note> they made a suite to <hi>Pharaoh,</hi>
that he would suffer them to go <hi>three dayes journey into

them for that once, to <hi>sacrifice unto the Lord in the land

both towards one another and amongst the <hi>Egyp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tians;</hi>
framing their lives agreeably to the will of God,
and the law of nature. Therefore we may conclude with
safety, that hitherto no <hi>Sabbath</hi> had been kept in all the
World from the creation of our first Father <hi>Adam,</hi> to this
very time; which was above 2500. yeares: no nor com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manded
to be kept amongst them in their generations.</p>
                        <p>(10) I say there was none kept, no nor none com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manded:
for had it been co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>manded, sure it had been kept.
It was not all the pride of <hi>Pharaoh,</hi> or subtle tyranny of
his subjects, that could have made them violate that sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cred
day, had it bin commended to them from the Lord.
The miseries which they after suffered under <hi>Antiochus,</hi>
rather then that they would prophane the <hi>Sabbath;</hi> and
those calamities which they chose to fall upon them by

upon that day, when lawfully they might have done it:
are proofes sufficient, that neither force, nor feare, could
now have wrought upon them not to keepe the same,
had such a duty been commanded. Questionlesse, <hi>Ioseph</hi>
for his part, that did preferre a lothsome prison before

to them by a speciall miracle, which had so long beene
hidden from their Ancestors. The falling of a double por<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
of <hi>Mannah</hi> on the sixt day, and the not <hi>putrifying</hi> of
it on the seventh; was the first light that <hi>Moses</hi> had to
descry the <hi>Sabbath:</hi> which he accordingly commended
unto all the people, to be a day of rest unto them; that as
God ceased that day from sending, so they should rest
from looking after their daily bread. But what need <hi>Phi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lo</hi>
be produced, when wee have such an ample testimony
from the word it selfe. For it is manifest in the story, that
when the people, on the sixt day, had gathered twice as
much <hi>Mannah,</hi> as they used to doe;<note place="margin">Exod. 16. 5.</note> according as the Lord
had directed by his servant <hi>Moses:</hi> they understood not
what they did,<note place="margin">Vers. 22.</note> at least why they did it. <hi>The Rulers of the
Congregation,</hi> as the Text informes us, <hi>came and told</hi> Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ses
<hi>of it:</hi> and he as God before had taught him, acquain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted
them,<note place="margin">Vers. 23.</note> that <hi>on the morrow should be the rest of the holy
Sabbath unto the Lord;</hi> and that they were to keepe the
over-plus untill the morning. Nay, so farre were the
people from knowing any thing of the <hi>Sabbath,</hi> or of
Gods rest upon that day, that though the <hi>Prophet</hi> had thus
preached unto them of a <hi>Sabbaths</hi> rest, the people gave
small credit to him. For it is said, that some of <hi>the people
went out to gather on the seventh day,</hi>

but onely so farre forth, as it is consonant to the <hi>law of

that if the <hi>Decalogue</hi> as given by <hi>Moses</hi> to the <hi>Iewes,</hi> did
concerne the <hi>Gentiles;</hi> the <hi>Gentiles</hi> had been bound by

<hi>Hesychius</hi> was deceived, in taking this Commandement
to be onely ceremoniall, whereas it is indeed of a mixt or

Authors in these later times, grounding themselues upon
the Fathers, have resolued it generally. <hi>Morall</hi> it is as to

that <hi>Philo</hi> being a learned <hi>Iew,</hi> or any learned Christian
Writer, leaving the cause expressed in the Law it selfe,
should seeke some secret reason for it, out of the nature of
the day,<note place="margin">De Abrahamo.</note> or of the number. First, <hi>Philo</hi> tels us, that the
<hi>Iewes</hi> doe call their seventh day by the name of <hi>sabbath,</hi>
which signifieth repose and rest. Not because they did rest
that day from their weekly labours: <gap reason="foreign">

but because <hi>se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven</hi>

between the <hi>Gentiles,</hi> and the <hi>Iewes,</hi> that diverse Cities

might be, considering that <hi>Homer</hi> who was the oldest of

How this interpretation was thus generally recei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved,

do prove quite contrary to what some would have them.
The Text and Context both make it plaine and manifest
that the <hi>Iewes</hi> baked their <hi>Mannah</hi> on the <hi>Sabbath day.</hi>
The people on the sixt day had gathered twice as much
as they used to do, whereof the <hi>Rulers of the Congregati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on</hi>

rest of the holy Sabbath unto the Lord: bake that which
yee will bake to day, and seeth what yee will seeth, and that
which remayneth over, lay up to be kept untill the morning.</hi>
i. e. As much as you conceive will be sufficient for this
present day; that bake or boyle, according as you use to
<pb n="101" facs="tcp:4215:73"/>
doe: and for the rest, let it be laid by, to be baked or boy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led

up unbaked: for otherwise what wonder had it been at all,
that it did neither breed worme, nor stinke, had it been
baked the day before. Things of that nature so preserved,
are farre enough from putrifying in so short a time. This,

the <hi>jejunia sabbatariorum</hi> in the Poet <hi>Martial,</hi> might
reflect on this. But that they fasted on the <hi>Sabbath</hi> is a

good antiquity: except in one case onely, which was

that those before remembred, had some ground or rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son,

touching the man that <hi>gathered sticks upon the Sabbath.</hi>
The case is briefly this:<note place="margin">Numb. 15. Vers. 32. ad 37.</note> the people being in the <hi>wildernes,</hi>
found a man <hi>gathering sticks</hi> on the <hi>Sabbath day,</hi> and
brought him presently unto <hi>Moses. Moses</hi> consulted with
the Lord, and it was resolued that the offender should be
<hi>stoned to death,</hi> which was done accordingly. The Law
before had ordered it, that he who so offended should be
put to death; but the particular manner of his death was
not knowne till now. The more remarkable is this case,
<pb n="112" facs="tcp:4215:79"/>
because it was the onely time that wee can heare of, that
execution had been done upon any one, according as the
Law enacted: and thereupon the Fathers have took some
pains,<note place="margin">De vit. Mos. l. 3</note> to search into the reasons of so great severity. <hi>Philo</hi>

where it was before commanded, that there should be no

labour on the day of rest; but also laboured in the ga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thering

smarted so for his first offence; not having otherwise of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fended

the greatnesse of them, <gap reason="foreign">

but onely in his disobedience to the will of God. But we
must have a more particular motive yet then this. And

                           <hi>per superbiam illud quod videbatur

an high hand against the Lord: and therefore God de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>creed
he should die the death: God not regarding either
what or how great it was, <hi>sed qua mente fecerat,</hi> but
with what minde it was committed. But this, is more, I
think, then <hi>Rupertus</hi> knew, being no searcher of the heart.
Rather I shall subscribe herein unto Saint <hi>Chrysostome.</hi>

observant of the <hi>Sabbath,</hi> then they would have beene:
who were at first but backwards in the keeping of it, as
is apparant by that passage in the sixteenth of <hi>Exod. v.</hi> 27.
And therefore stood the more in need, not onely of a
watch-word or <hi>Memento,</hi> even in the very front of the
Law it selfe; but of some sharper course to stirre up their
memory. Therefore this execution was the more reqvi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>site
at this instant, aswell because the <hi>Iewes</hi> by reason of
their long abode in a place of continual servile toyle, could
not be suddainly drawne unto contrary offices without
some strong impression of terrour: as also because no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing

it is placed in the yeare 2548. of the Worlds Crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion;

may know the better what we are to looke for at the peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ples

the Lord commanded in his holy Scripture, that concern

the <hi>Priest</hi> might do his part, without the <hi>people,</hi> and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary

<hi>Sabbath duties,</hi> which were to be performed betweene
them; wherein the <hi>Priest</hi> and <hi>people</hi> were to joyne toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther:
the Scriptures are directly silent. As for these seve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rall
duties, that of the <hi>Priest,</hi> the <hi>Shew-bread,</hi> and the <hi>sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crifice,</hi>
was not in practice till they came to the Land of
<hi>Canaan:</hi> and then, though the <hi>Priest</hi> offered for the <hi>peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple;</hi>
yet he did not, with them. So that for forty yeares to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether,
all the life of <hi>Moses,</hi> the <hi>sanctifying</hi> of the <hi>Sab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bath</hi>
did consist onely, for ought we finde, in a <hi>bodily rest,</hi>
a ceasing from the works of their <hi>weekly labours:</hi> and af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terwards
in that, and in the <hi>sacrifices</hi> which the <hi>Priest</hi>
made for them. Which as they seeme to be the greater of
the two, so was there nothing at all therein, in which the
<hi>people</hi> were to doe; no not so much, except some few,
as to be <hi>spectatours:</hi> the <hi>sacrifices</hi> being offered onely in

                              </gap>, and
spending it in meditation of the works of nature,
as before is said. And not so only, but that upon that
day they should consider of their actions in the weeke
before, if happily they had offended against the Law:

might correct what was done amisse, and be the bet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter

learne: especially considering the resemblance that was
betweene them in all manner of circumstances. Was
<hi>circumcision</hi> made to be a <hi>token of the Covenant betweene
the Lord of heaven,</hi> and the seed of <hi>Abraham? Genes. 17.

with the seed of <hi>Abraham</hi> in <hi>their generations?
Gen.</hi> 17. 7. So was the <hi>Sabbath</hi> to be kept <hi>throughout their
generations, for a perpetuall covenant</hi> also. <hi>Exod.</hi> 31. 16.
Was <hi>circumcision</hi> so exacted, that whosoever was not
<hi>circumcised,</hi> that <hi>soule should be cut off from the people of
God? Gen.</hi> 17. 14. So God hath said it of his <hi>Sabbath,</hi> that
whosoever breakes it, or <hi>doth any manner of worke there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in,
that soule shall be cut off from among the people. Exod.
31.</hi> 14. In all these points there was a just and plaine e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>qualitie
betweene them: but had the <hi>Sabbath</hi> beene a
part of the <hi>Morall law,</hi> it must have infinitely gone be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
<hi>Circumcision.</hi> What then should move the <hi>Iewes</hi> to

to a further day. Hence grew it into a common

that Circumcision drives away the Sabbath; as be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
<pb n="123" facs="tcp:4215:85"/>
I noted. Nor could it be that they conceived a grea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
or more strict necessitie to be in <hi>circumcision,</hi> then in
the <hi>Sabbath;</hi> the penaltie and danger, as before we shew<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
you, being alike in both: for in the Wildernesse, by
the space of 40. yeares together, when in some sort they
kept the <hi>Sabbath;</hi> most certaine that they <hi>circumcised</hi>
not one, not one of many hundred thousands that were
borne in so long a time. Againe, had God intended <hi>Cir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cumcision</hi>
to have beene so necessarie, that there was no
deferring of it for a day or two: he either had not made
the <hi>Sabbaths rest</hi> so exact and rigid; or else out of that
generall rule had made exception in this case. And on the
other side, had he intended that the <hi>Sabbaths rest</hi> should
have beene literally observed, and that <hi>no manner of worke</hi>
should be done therein:<note place="margin">Iust. Mar<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

yea though it fell upon the <hi>Sabbath;</hi> but would
have respited the same till another day. The Act of <hi>cir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cumcision</hi>
was not restrained unto the eight day so pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cisely,
but that it might be, as it was sometimes, deferred
upon occasion; as in the case of <hi>Moses</hi> children, and the

it was not to be hastened, and performed before.

in holy Scripture, reducible unto the businesse now
in hand, is that so famous miracle of the <hi>Sunne's standing

as long as two?</hi> The like, to take them both together in
this place, was that great miracle of mercy shewed to
<hi>Hezekiah,</hi>
                           <note place="margin">2 King 20.</note> by bringing of <hi>the shadow ten degrees back<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward,
by which it had gone downe in the diall of Ahaz.</hi>
In each of these there was a signall alteration in the course
of nature, and the succession of time: so notable, that it
were very difficult to finde out the <hi>seventh day</hi> precisely
from the worlds creation; or to proceed in that account
since the late giving of the law. So that in this respect,
the <hi>Iews</hi> must needs be at a losse in their calculation: and
though they might hereafter set apart one day in <hi>seven,</hi>
for rest and meditation; yet that this day so set apart, could
be precisely the <hi>seventh day</hi> from the first creation, is not
so easie to be proved. The Author of the <hi>Practise of Piety,</hi>
as zealously as he pleads for the <hi>morality</hi> of the <hi>sabbath,</hi>
confesseth, that in these regards the <hi>sabbath</hi> could not be
observed, precisely, on the day appointed. <q>And to speake
properly, saith he, as we take a day for the distinction
<pb n="125" facs="tcp:4215:86"/>
of time, called either a day naturall consisting of 24.
houres, or a day artificiall, consisting of 12. houres
from Sunne-rising to Sunne-setting: And withall con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sider
the Sunne standing still at noone, the space of an
whole day in the time of <hi>Iosuah;</hi> and the Sunne going
backe ten degrees (viz. five houres which is almost
halfe an artificiall day) in <hi>Hezekiahs</hi> time: the <hi>Iewes</hi>
themselves could not keepe their <hi>Sabbath,</hi> on that pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cise
and just distinction of time, called at the first, the
<hi>seventh</hi> day from the creation.</q> If so, if they observed
it not at the punctuall time, according as the law com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manded:
it followeth then, on his confession, that from
the time of <hi>Iosuah,</hi> till the destruction of the Temple,
there was no <hi>Sabbath</hi> kept by the <hi>Iewes</hi> at all; because
not on the day precisely, which the law appointed.</p>
                        <p>(9) This miracle, as it advantaged those of the house
of <hi>Israel</hi> in the present slaughter of their enemies: so
could it not but infinitely astonish all the <hi>Canaanites;</hi> and
make them faint, and flie before the conquerours. Inso<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>much
that in the compasse of five yeares, as <hi>Iosephus</hi> tels
us, there was not any left to make head against them. So
that the victory being assured, and many of the Tribes in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vested
in their new possessions:<note place="margin">Ios. 8. 1.</note> it pleased the <hi>Congrega<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
of Israel to come together at Shilo, there to set up the
Tabernacle of the Congregation.</hi> And they made choice
thereof,<note place="margin">Antiqu. Iud. l 5. c. 1.</note> as <hi>Iosephus</hi> saith, because it seemed to be a very
convenient place, by reason of the beauty of the place.
Rather because it sorted best with <hi>Iosuahs</hi> liking, who
being of the Tribe of <hi>Ephraim,</hi> within whose lot that
Citie stood, was perhaps willing to conferre that honour
on it. But whatsoever was the motive, here was the <hi>Ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

finally here the <hi>legall ceremonies</hi> were to take beginning:
God having told them many times, these and these things

of his <hi>Sabbaths rest;</hi> or to take joy in any thing but his
larger fees, and that he had discharged his duty. As for
the <hi>people</hi> though they might all partake of the fruits
hereof: yet none but those that dwelt in <hi>Shilo,</hi> or
neere unto it at the least, could behold the sight; or note
what paines the <hi>Priests</hi> tooke for them, whilest they
themselues sate still and stirred not. Had the Comman<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dement
beene <hi>morall,</hi> and every part thereof of the same
condition: the <hi>Priests</hi> had never done so <hi>many manners
of worke,</hi> as that day they did. However, as it was,
our blessed Saviour did account these works of theirs, to
be a publick prophanation of the <hi>Sabbath day.</hi>

                        <p>(10) These were the Offices of the <hi>Priest,</hi> on the
<hi>Sabbath day;</hi> and questionlesse they were sufficient to
take up the time. Of any other <hi>Sabbath duties</hi> by them
performed, at this present time, there is no <hi>Constat</hi> in the
Scripture: no nor of any place, as yet, designed for the
<pb n="128" facs="tcp:4215:88"/>
performance of such other duties, as some conceive to
pertain unto the <hi>Levites.</hi> That they were scattered and
dispersed over all the <hi>Tribes,</hi> is indeed most true. The
Curse of <hi>Iacob,</hi> now was become a blessing to them. For<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty
eight Cities had they given them for their inheritance
(whereof thirteen were proper onely to the Priests:) be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sides

them from the publick Sacrifices, to an infinite value.
Yet was not this dispersion of the Tribe of <hi>Levi,</hi> in refe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rence
to any <hi>Sabbath duties,</hi> that so they might the better
assist the people in the solemnities and sanctifyng of that
day. The Scripture tels us no such matter. The reasons ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nifested
in the word were these two especially. First, that
they might be neere at hand to instruct the people, and
teach them <hi>all the statutes,</hi>
                           <note place="margin">Levit. 10. 10, 11</note> 
                           <hi>which the Lord had spoken by the
hand of</hi> Moses: as also to let them know the <hi>difference
betweene the holy and unholy, the uncleane and cleane.</hi> Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny
particular things there were in the <hi>Law Leviticall,</hi>
touching pollutions, purifyings, and the like legall Ordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nances,
which were not necessary to be ordered by the
<hi>Priests,</hi> above, those that attended at the <hi>Altar,</hi> and
were resorted too in most difficult cases: Therefore both
for the <hi>peoples</hi> ease, and that the Priests, above, might not
be troubled every day in matters of inferiour moment;
the <hi>Priests</hi> and <hi>Levites</hi> were thus mingled amongst the
Tribes. A second reason was, that there might be aswell
some nursery to train up the <hi>Levites,</hi> untill they were of
age fit for the service of the <hi>Tabernacle;</hi> as also some re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tirement
unto the which they might repaire, when by the
Law they were dismissed from their attendance. The
number of the Tribe of <hi>Levi,</hi> in the first generall muster
of them, from a moneth old and upwards, was 22000.
just: out of which number, all from 30 yeares of age to
50, being in all 8580 persons, were taken to attend the
publicke Ministery. The residue with their wives and
daughters, were to be severally disposed of in the Cities
<pb n="129" facs="tcp:4215:88"/>
allotted to them: therein to rest themselues with their
goods and cattaile, and do those other Offices above re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>membred.
Which Offices as they were the works of eve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry

informed them answerably unto their knowledge. But
this was but occasionall onely, no constant duty. Indeed
it is conceived by Master <hi>Samuel Purchas,</hi>

<hi>That the forty eight Cities of the Levites had their

the people on the <hi>Sabbath dayes,</hi> as after in the <hi>Syna<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gogues.</hi>
For where those Cities were but foure in every
Tribe, one with another, the people must needs travaile
further then six Furlongs, which was a <hi>Sabbath dayes

that nice restriction was not then in use. And were it

were. Put these together, and it will amount in all to two

how in the Festivall of the <hi>New-moon</hi> his place was

declared his malicious purpose, which in his heart he had

that his Father did seeke his life. <hi>David</hi> on this makes

it plaine, it could be no other. The <hi>Shew-bread</hi> was
changed every <hi>Sabbath,</hi> in the morning early: that which
was brought in new, not to be stirred off from the Table
till the Week was out: the other which was taken away,
being appropriated to the <hi>Priests,</hi> and to be eaten by
them onely. Being so stale before, wee may the easier
thinke it lay not long upon their hands: and had not <hi>Da<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vid</hi>
come, as he did, that morning; perhaps hee had not
found the <hi>Priest</hi> so well provided, in the afternoon. Had
<hi>David</hi> thought that breaking of the <hi>Sabbath</hi> in what case
soever, had been a sinne against the <hi>eternall Law</hi> of <hi>Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture:</hi>
he would, no doubt, have hid himselfe that day in
the field,<note place="margin">1. Sam. 20. Verse 19, 24,</note> by the <hi>stone Ezel,</hi> as he had done two dayes be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore;
rather then so have run away, as well from God, as
from the King. Especially considering that on the <hi>Sab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bath</hi>
day hee might have lurked there with more safetie,
then before he did: none being permitted, as some say, by
the Law of God, to walke abroad that day, if occasion
were. Neither had <hi>David</hi> passed it over in so light a
manner, had he done contrary to the <hi>Law.</hi> That heart of
his which smote him for his <hi>murder</hi> and <hi>adultery,</hi> and for
his <hi>numbring</hi> of the <hi>people</hi> would sure have taken some
impression, upon the breaking of the <hi>Sabbath;</hi> had hee
conceived that Law to be like the rest. But <hi>David</hi> knew
<pb n="135" facs="tcp:4215:91"/>
of no such matter: neither did <hi>Ionathan,</hi> as it seemes. For
howsoever <hi>Davids</hi> fact might be excused by reason of the
imminent perill; yet surely <hi>Ionathans</hi> walking forth with
his <hi>bow</hi> and <hi>arrowes,</hi> was of a very different nature. Nor
did he doe it fearfully, and by way of stealth, as if he were
affraid to avow the action: but tooke his Page with him
to bring back his arrowes, and called aloud unto him to
doe thus and thus, according as he was directed; as if it
were his usuall custome. <hi>Ionathan</hi> might have thought
of some other way to give advertisement unto <hi>David,</hi>
of his Fathers anger: rather then by a publick breaking of
the <hi>Sabbath,</hi> to provoke the Lords. But then, as may from
hence be gathered, <hi>shooting</hi> and such like <hi>manlike exer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cises,</hi>
were not accounted things unlawfull on the <hi>Sab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bath

were appointed in the times before, to beare about
the <hi>Tabernacle,</hi> as occasion was: the <hi>Tabernacle</hi> now be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
fixed and setled in <hi>Hierusalem,</hi> there was no further
use of the <hi>Levites</hi> service,<note place="margin">1. Chron 23. 4, 5</note> in that kind. Therefore King
<hi>David</hi> thought it good to set them to some new employ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments;
and so he did: some of them to assist the <hi>Priests,</hi>
in the publick Ministery; some to be <hi>Overseers</hi> and <hi>Iudges</hi>
of the people, some to be <hi>Porters</hi> also in the house of
God, and finally, some others to be singers to <hi>prayse the
Lord with instruments that he had made, with Harps, with
Viols and with Cymballs.</hi> Of these the most considerable
were the first and last. The first appointed to assist at the
daily Sacrifices:<note place="margin">Vers. 31.</note> as also at the <hi>Offering of all burnt Offe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rings
unto the Lord, in the Sabbaths, in the moneths, and
at the appointed times according to the number and ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording
to their custome continually before the Lord.</hi> The
other were instructed in <hi>the songs of the Lord.</hi>
                           <note place="margin">Chap. 25. 7.</note> The other

chiefly which were made for the <hi>Sabbath dayes,</hi> and the
other <hi>Festivals:</hi> and one hee made himselfe, of his owne
enditing, entituled a <hi>Song or Psalme for the Sabbath day.
Calvin</hi> upon the 92 Psalme is of opinion,<note place="margin">Psal. 92.</note> that hee made
many for that purpose; as no doubt hee did; and so
he did for the <hi>Feasts</hi> also.<note place="margin">Antiq Iud. l. 7. c. 10.</note> 
                           <hi>Iosephus</hi> tels us, that hee com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>posed

as well upon the <hi>Annuall,</hi> as the <hi>weekly Sabbath.</hi> Where
note, that in the distribution of the <hi>Levites</hi> into severall
<hi>Offices,</hi> there was then no such Office thought of, as to be
<hi>Readers of the Law;</hi> which prooves sufficiently that the
Law was not yet read publickly unto the people on the
<hi>Sabbath day.</hi> Nor did he onely appoint them their <hi>Songs</hi>
and <hi>Instruments,</hi> but so exact and punctuall was hee, that
he prescribed what <hi>habit</hi> they should weare, in the dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>charging
of their Ministery, in singing prayses to the
Lord; which was <hi>a white linnen rayment,</hi> such as the <hi>Sur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plice,</hi>
                           <note place="margin">2. Chron. 5. 12, 13.</note>
now in use, in the Church of <hi>England. Also the Le<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vites,</hi>
saith the Text, <hi>which were the singers, being arrayed
in white linnen, having Cymbals and Psalteries and Harps,
stood at the East end of the Altar, &amp;c. praysing and thank<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
God, for his Grace and mercies.</hi> And this he did not by
commandement from above, or any warrant but his own
as we finde, and that he thought it fit, and decent. <hi>David</hi>
the <hi>Prophet</hi> of the Lord knew well, what did belong to
<hi>David</hi> the <hi>King</hi> of <hi>Israel,</hi> in ordering matters of the
<hi>Church,</hi> and setling things about the <hi>Sabbath.</hi> Nor can it
be but worth the notice, that the first <hi>King</hi> whom God
raised up to <hi>be a nursing Father</hi> unto his <hi>Church,</hi> should
exercise his regall power in dictating what hee would
have done on the <hi>Sabbath day,</hi> in reference to Gods pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lick
worship. As if in him, the Lord did meane to teach
all others of the same condition, as no doubt he did, that
it pertaines to them to vindicate the day of his publicke
<pb n="137" facs="tcp:4215:92"/>
service, as well from superstitious fancies, as prophane
contempts: and to take speciall order that his name be
glorified, as well in the performances of the Priests, as
the devotions of the people. This speciall care wee shall
find verified in <hi>Constantine,</hi> the first <hi>Christian Emperour,</hi>
of whom more hereafter in the next Booke, and third
Chapter. Now what was there ordained by <hi>David,</hi> was
afterwards confirmed by <hi>Solomon</hi> (wherof see 2. <hi>Chron.</hi> 8
14) Who as he built a Temple for Gods publick worship;
for the <hi>New-moones,</hi> and <hi>weekly Sabbaths,</hi> and the <hi>solemne
Feasts,</hi> as the Scripture tels us: so hee, or some of his
Successours, built a faire seat within the Porch thereof,
wherein the Kings did use to set, both on the <hi>Sabbaths</hi>
and the <hi>annuall Festivals.</hi> The Scripture calls it <hi>tegmen
sabbati, the covert for the Sabbath;</hi>
                           <note place="margin">2 Kings 16.</note> that is, saith <hi>Rabbi
Solomon, locus quidam in porticu templi gratiose coopertus,
in quo Rex sedebat die sabbati, &amp; in magnis festivitati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bus,</hi>
as before was said. So that in this too, both were
equall.</p>

great Prophet to another: both persecuted, and both
faine to flie, and both to flie upon the Sabbath. <hi>Elijah</hi> had
made havock of the Priests of <hi>Baal,</hi> and <hi>Iezebel</hi> sent a

to turn unto the Lord, &amp; amend their lives, &amp; observe
his <hi>Sabbaths:</hi> his <hi>sabbata annorum, Sabbaths</hi> of <hi>years,</hi> aswel
as either his <hi>weekly</hi> or his <hi>yearly Sabbaths.</hi> The <hi>Iewes</hi>
had been regardlesse of them all, &amp; for neglect of all, God
resolued to punish them. First, for the <hi>weekly Sabbath,</hi>
that God avenged himselfe upon them for the breach
thereof, is evident by that one place of <hi>Nehemiah. Did
not your Fathers thus,</hi>
                           <note place="margin">Ch. 13. v. 18</note> saith he, <hi>and our God brought this

wrath upon Israel, in breaking the Sabbath.</hi> Next for the
<hi>Annuall Sabbaths,</hi> God threatned that he would deprive
them of them, by his Prophet <hi>Hosea;</hi> as before was said.
And lastly, for his <hi>Sabbaths</hi> of <hi>yeares,</hi> they had been long
neglected &amp; almost forgotten; if observed at all. <hi>Torniel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lus</hi>
finds three onely kept in all the Scripture. Nor are
more specified in particular, but sure more were kept: the
certain number of the which may easily be found by the
proportion of the punishment. God tels them that they
should remayn in bondage,<note place="margin">2. Chron. 36. <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 word">

as they were in bondage, so many <hi>sabbaths</hi> of <hi>yeares</hi> they
had neglected. Now from the yeare 2593 which was
the seventh yeare after their possession of the Land of <hi>Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>naan,</hi>
unto the yeare 3450, which was the yeare of their
<hi>Captivitie:</hi> there passed in all 857 yeares just; of which
122 were yeares <hi>Sabbaticall.</hi> By which account it is ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parant,
that they had kept in all that time, but fifty two
<hi>sabbaticall yeares:</hi> and for the <hi>seventy sabbaths of yeares</hi>
which they had neglected, God made himselfe amends,
by laying desolate the whole Country, <hi>seventy</hi> yeares to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether,
<hi>till the earth had enjoyed her sabbaths.</hi> Not that the
earth lay still all that while, and was never tilled; for those
that did remayne behinde, and inhabit there, must have
meanes to live: but that the tillage was so little, and the

somewhat that they went so farre in the <hi>reformation,</hi> as
to revive the <hi>sabbaths</hi> and the publick <hi>Festivals.</hi> I say the
<hi>sabbaths,</hi> amongst others; for so <hi>Iosephus</hi> doth expresse it,
<q>They celebrated at that time, saith he, the feast of <hi>Ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bernacles,</hi>

not so well performed, as it was agreed. For <hi>Nehemiah</hi>
who was principall on the peoples part, being gone for

he looked for. <hi>I saw,</hi>

a most strange disorder. So generall was the crime
become, that the chiefe <hi>Rulers of the people</hi> were most
guilty of it. So that to rectifie this misrule, <hi>Nehemiah</hi> was
not onely forced to shut up the <hi>Gates,</hi> upon the <hi>Even</hi> be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
the <hi>sabbath,</hi> yea, and to keepe them shut all the <hi>sab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bath
day;</hi> whereby the Merchants were compelled, to rest
with their commodities, without the walls: but to use
threatning words unto them, that if from that time for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards,
they came with Merchandise on the <hi>sabbath,</hi> hee
would forbeare no longer, but lay hands upon them. A
course not more severe, then necessary, as the case then
stood. Nor had those mischiefs been redressed, being now
countenanced by custome, and some chiefe men among
the people: had they not met a man, both resolved and
<pb n="146" facs="tcp:4215:97"/>
constant; one that both knew his worke, and had a will
to see it finished. This reformation of the <hi>sabbath,</hi> or ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
of those foule abuses which had of late defiled it, and
even made it despicable; is placed by <hi>Torniellus, An.</hi> 3629:
which was above an hundred yeares after the restitution
of this people to their Native Country. So difficult a thing
it is to overcome an evill custome.</p>
                        <p>(10) Things ordered thus, and all those publick
scandals being thus remooved: there followed a more
strict observance of the <hi>Sabbath day,</hi> then ever had beene
kept before. The rather since about these times, began
the reading of the <hi>Law</hi> in the <hi>Congregation.</hi> Not every
<hi>seventh yeare</hi> onely, and on the Feast of <hi>Tabernacles,</hi> as
before it was, or should have been at the least, by the law
of <hi>Moses;</hi> but every <hi>sabbath day,</hi> and each <hi>solemne mee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting:</hi>
nor onely in the <hi>Temple</hi> of <hi>Hierusalem,</hi> as it used to
be; but in the Townes and principall places of each seve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rall
Tribe. <hi>Ezra</hi> first set this course on foot, a <hi>Priest</hi> by

for manner of the reading, it was not onely published, as
it had beene formerly, but expounded also. Whereof, as

because the <hi>Hebrew</hi> tongue wherein the Scriptures were
first written, was now growne strange unto the people;
the <hi>Chaldee</hi> or the <hi>Syriack</hi> being generally received in
the place thereof. And last of all, for the continuance of
this exercise, it held out eight dayes, all the whole time
the Feast continued: whereas it was appointed by the
Law of <hi>Moses,</hi> that onely the first and last dayes of the
Feast of <hi>Tabernacles</hi> should bee esteemed and solemni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zed,
as <hi>holy convocations</hi> to the Lord their God. <hi>Levit. 23

custome; and a faire overture to the <hi>Priests,</hi> who
were then <hi>Rulers</hi> of the people to beginne a new:
a faire instruction to them all, that reading of the
Law of God was not confined to place, or time; but
that all times, and places were alike to his holy
word. <hi>Every seventh day</hi> as fit for so good a du<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty,
as <hi>every seventh yeare</hi> was acounted in the former
times: the Villages and Townes as capable of the Word
of God, as was the great and glorious Temple of <hi>Hieru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>salem:</hi>
and what prerogative had the Feast of <hi>Taberna<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cles,</hi>
but that the Word of God might be as necessary to
be heard on the other <hi>Festivals,</hi> as it was on that? The
<pb n="148" facs="tcp:4215:98"/>
law had first been given them on a <hi>Sabbath day,</hi> and ther<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
might be read unto them every <hi>Sabbath day.</hi> This
might be pleaded in behalfe of this alteration, and that
great change which followed after, in the <hi>weekly Sab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>baths;</hi>
whereon the Law of God was not onely read un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to
the people, such of them as inhabited over all <hi>Iudea;</hi>
but publickly made knowne unto them, in all the Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uinces
and Townes abroad, where they had either <hi>Syna<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gogues</hi>
or habitations. God certainly had so disposed it,
in his heavenly counsailes, that so his holy Word might
be more generally knowne throughout the World; and a
more easie way layed open, for the admittance and receipt
of the <hi>Messiah,</hi> whom he meant to send: that so <hi>Hieru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>salem</hi>
and the <hi>Temple,</hi> might by degrees be lesned in their
reputation;<note place="margin">Iohn 4. <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

was the <hi>onely place, where they ought to worship.</hi> This I am
sure of, that by this breaking of the custome, although an
institute of <hi>Moses,</hi> the Law was read more frequently,
then in times of old: there being one other <hi>reading</hi> of it,
publickly and before the people related in the thirteenth
of <hi>Nehemiah,</hi> when it was neither Feast of <hi>Tabernacles,</hi>
nor <hi>Sabbaticall</hi> yeare, for ought we finde in holy Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture.
Therefore most like it is that it was the <hi>Sabbath,</hi>
which, much about those times, beganne to be ennobled
with the constant reading of the Word in the <hi>Congre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gation,</hi>
First in <hi>Hierusalem,</hi> and after by degrees, in most

that the Book of the Law had as then been extant, and ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tant

could possibly have beene such a stranger to the
Law, of God; or that the finding of the Booke had
beene related for so strange an accident, when there
was scarce a Towne in <hi>Iudah,</hi> but was funished with
them. Or what need such a suddain calling of all the El<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders,
and on an extraordinary time, to heare the Law; if
they had heard it <hi>every Sabbath,</hi> and that of ordinary
course? Nay, so farre were they at this time, from ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving
the <hi>Law</hi> read amongst them every <hi>weekly Sabbath,</hi>
that as it seemes, it was not read amongst them in the
<hi>sabbath</hi> of <hi>yeares,</hi> as <hi>Moses</hi> had before appointed. For if it
had been read unto them once in seven yeares onely; that
vertuous Prince had not so soone forgotten the content<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

thereof. Therefore there was <hi>no synagogue,</hi> no <hi>weekly rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding</hi>
of the <hi>law,</hi> in <hi>Iosiahs</hi> dayes. And if not then, and not
<pb n="151" facs="tcp:4215:99"/>
before, then not at all till <hi>Ezras</hi> time. The finding of the
booke of God before remembred, is said to happen in the
yeare 3412. of the worlds creation: not forty yeares be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
the people were led <hi>Captives</hi> into <hi>Babylon;</hi> in which
short space, the Princes being carelesse, and the times
distracted, there could be nothing done that concern'd
this businesse. Now from this reading of the Law in the
time of <hi>Ezra,</hi> unto the Councell holden in <hi>Hierusalem,</hi>
there passed 490. yeares, or thereabouts. Antiquitie suffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cient

                           <hi>being read in the Synagogues every Sabbath

times wherein we are, there was no <hi>reading</hi> of the <hi>Law</hi>
unto the <hi>people</hi> on the <hi>Sabbath dayes:</hi> and in these times,
when it was taken up amongst them, it was by <hi>Ecclesia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sticall
institution</hi> onely, no divine authoritie.</p>
                        <p>(12) But being taken up, on what ground soever, it
did continue afterwards, though perhaps sometimes in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terrupted,
untill the finall dissolution of that Church and
State: and therewithall grew up a libertie of interpreta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
of the holy words, which did at last divide the peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple
into sects and factions. <hi>Petrus Cunaeus</hi> doth affirme,
that howsoever the Law was read amongst them in the
former times,<note place="margin">De republ. l. 2. ca. 17.</note> either in publike or in private; yet the bare
text was onely read, without <hi>glosse</hi> or descant. <hi>Interpre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tatio
magistrorum, commentatio nulla.</hi> But in the <hi>second
Temple,</hi> when there were no <hi>Prophets,</hi> then did the
<hi>Scribes</hi> and <hi>Doctors</hi> begin to comment, and make their
severall expositions on the holy Text: <hi>Ex quo natae dispu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tationes
&amp; sententiae contrariae;</hi> from whence, saith he,
sprung up debates, and doubtfull disputations. Most pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bable
it is, that from this liberty of interpretation, sprung
up diversity of judgements, from whence arose the seve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rall
sects of <hi>Pharisees, Essees</hi> and <hi>Sadduces,</hi> who by their
difference of opinions did distract the multitude, and
<pb n="152" facs="tcp:4215:100"/>
condemne each other. Of whom, and what they taught
about the <hi>Sabbath,</hi> we shall see next Chapter. Nor is it
to be doubted, but as the <hi>reading</hi> of the <hi>Law,</hi> did make
the people more observant of the <hi>Sabbath,</hi> then they
were before: so that <hi>libertas prophetandi,</hi> which they had
amongst them, occasioned many of those rigours, which
were brought in after. The <hi>people</hi> had before neglected

up; but it continued a long time, yea and was every day

men, who tooke upon them to declare the meaning of it.
But howsoever it was with those of <hi>Iewrie,</hi> such of their

made no such scruple of the <hi>Sabbath,</hi> but that they were

for the whole at large. Two brethren, <hi>Asinaeus,</hi> and
<hi>Anilaeus,</hi> borne in <hi>Nearda,</hi> in the territory of <hi>Babylon,</hi> be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gan
to fortifie themselves, and commit great outrages:
which knowne, the Governour of <hi>Babylon</hi> prepares his
forces to suppresse them. Having drawne up his Army,
he layes in ambush neere a marish: and the next day,
which was the <hi>Sabbath,</hi> (wherein the <hi>Iews</hi> did use to rest
from <hi>all manner of worke</hi>) making account that without
stroke stricken, they would yeeld themselues, he march<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
against them <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

                           </gap>aire and softly, to come upon them un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>awares.
But being discovered by the scouts of <hi>Asinaeus,</hi>
it was resolved amongst them to be farre more safe, vali<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>antly
to behave themselues in that necessitie, yea though
it were a breaking of the very Law; then to submit them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selues,
and make proud the enemy. Whereupon all of
them at once marched forth, and slaughtered a great
<pb n="157" facs="tcp:4215:102"/>
many of the enemies; the residue being constrained to
save themselues by a speedy flight. The like did <hi>Anilaeus,</hi>
after; being provoked by <hi>Mithridates,</hi> another Chiefe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taine
of those parts. This happened much about the yeare
3957. that of the <hi>Maccabees</hi> before remembred, Ann.
3887. or thereabouts. Happy it was these brethren lived
not in <hi>Indaea;</hi> for had they done so there, the <hi>Scribes</hi> and
<hi>Pharisees</hi> would have tooke an ord<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

cast them out of the <hi>Synagogues,</hi> if not used them
worse.</p>
                        <p>(2) For by this time those Sects which before wee
spake of, began to shew themselues, and disperse their
doctrines. <hi>Iosephus</hi> speakes not of them till the time of
<hi>Ionathan,</hi> who entred on the Government of the <hi>Iewish</hi>
Nation, Ann. 3894. Questionlesse they were knowne
and followed in the former times; though probablie not
so much in credit, their dictates not so much adored, as
in the ages that came after. Of those the <hi>Pharisees</hi> were
of most authoritie, being most active in their courses, se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vere
professours of the Law, and such as by a seeming san<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctitie
had gained exceedingly on the affections of the
common people. The <hi>Sadduces</hi> were of lesse repute,
(though otherwise they had th<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

                           </gap>ir dependants) as men
that questioned some of the common principles: denying
the resurrection of the dead, the hope of immortalitie. As
for the <hi>Essees</hi> or <hi>Essens,</hi> they were a kinde of <hi>Monkish</hi>
men, retyred and private; of farre more honestie then the
<hi>Pharisees,</hi> but of farre lesse cunning: therefore their ten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dries
not so generally received, or hearkened after, as the
others were. In matters of the <hi>Sabbath</hi> they were strict
alike; but with some difference in the points wherein
their strictnesse did consist. In this the <hi>Essee</hi> seemes to go
beyond the <hi>Pharisee,</hi>

                           </note> that they not onely did abstaine
from <hi>dressing meat,</hi> and <hi>kindling fire</hi> upon the <hi>Sabbath,</hi>
as probably the others did:

remove a dish or any other vessell out of the place, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in
<pb n="158" facs="tcp:4215:103"/>
they found it, yea or to go aside to ease nature. And
on the other side, the <hi>Pharisee</hi> in the multiplicitie of his
<hi>Sabbath</hi>-speculations, went beyond the <hi>Essee:</hi> all which
were thrust upon the people, as prescribed by God, and
grounded in his holy Law; the perfect keeping of the
which seemed their utmost industry. There is a dictate in
the Scripture,<note place="margin">Exod. 16.</note> that <hi>No <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                                 <desc>•</desc>

the words and letter: therefore there must be some de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vice
to expound this Text, and make the matter feasible.
Hereupon <hi>Achiba, Simeon,</hi> and <hi>Hillel,</hi> three principall
<hi>Rabbins</hi> of these times, found out a shift to satisfie the
Text, and yet not binde the people to impossible bur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dens.
This was to limit out the <hi>Sabbaths journey,</hi> allow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing

and therefore to be reckoned of these times in the which
we are. The other two, for ought we know, were his
<hi>Coaetanei,</hi> and lived about the same times also. So for the
other Text, <hi>Thou shalt not kindle fire on the Sabbath day,</hi>
this also must be literally understood: and then compa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring
this with that in <hi>Exodus, Bake that which ye will

into the Kingdome of Heaven: our Saviour never
had commanded the poore lame man, to <hi>take up his

have so dallied with this Text, that they have made both

that men should carry nothing at all about them,

that which a man
did carry on one shoulder onely was a burden to him; not
what he carried upon both, as <hi>Origen</hi> informs us of them.

no though it were to save ones life: neither to heale the

Because the Law permits us to defend our selves,
in case at any time we are assailed, and urged to fight;
but not to set upon them or disturbe them, when they
have other worke in hand. Which when the <hi>Romans</hi>
found, saith he, they neither gave assault, or proferd any
skirmish on the <hi>Sabbath</hi> dayes, but built their Towers
and Bulwarks, and planted Engines thereupon: and
the next day put them in use against the <hi>Iewes.</hi>

For at this time our Saviour came into the world. And
had there beene no other businesse for him to do: this

abused the <hi>sabbath,</hi> and made it of an ease to become a

God of man? Not so. The <hi>Sabbath</hi> was not made for a
lazie idoll, which all the Nations of the world should fall
downe, and worship: but for the ease and comfort of the
labouring man, that he might have some time to refresh
his spirits. <hi>Sabbatum propter hominem factum est,</hi> the <hi>Sab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bath,</hi>

spoke the word, touching the <hi>sanctifying</hi> of the <hi>Sabbath,</hi>
that he had left himselfe no power to repeale that Law;
in case he saw the purpose of the Law perverted: the
<hi>Sonne of man,</hi> even he that was the Sonne both of God
and Man, being <hi>Lord</hi> also of the <hi>Sabbath.</hi> Nay it is rightly
marked by some, that Christ our Saviour did more works
of charitie on the <hi>Sabbath day,</hi> then all dayes else.

Our Saviours purpose, saith the Father, was not to
take away the Law, but to expound it.</p>
                        <p>(7) Not then to take away the Law; it was to last a
little longer. He had not yet pronounced, <hi>Consummatum
est,</hi> that the Law was abrogated. Nor might it seeme so
proper for him, to take away one <hi>Sabbath</hi> from us, which
was <hi>rest</hi> from <hi>labour;</hi> untill he had provided us of ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther,
which was <hi>rest</hi> from <hi>sinne.</hi> And to provide us such
a <hi>Sabbath</hi> was to cost him dearer, then words and argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments.
He healed us by his word before. Now he must
heale us by his stripes, or else no entrance into his <hi>rest,</hi>
the <hi>eternall Sabbath.</hi> Besides the <hi>Temple</hi> stood as yet,
and whilest that stood, or was in hope to be <hi>rebuilt,</hi> there
was no end to be expected of the legall ceremonies. The
<hi>Sabbath,</hi> and the <hi>Temple</hi> did both end together; and
which is more remarkable, on a <hi>Sabbath day.</hi> The <hi>Iews</hi>
were still sicke of their old disease, and would not stirre
a foot on the <hi>Sabbath</hi> day, beyond their compasse: no,
though it were to save their Temple, and in that their
<hi>Sabbath.</hi> or whatsoever else was most deare unto them.
Nay they were more superstitious now, then they were
before. For whereas in the former times it had beene
thought unlawfull, to take armes and make warre on the
<hi>Sabbath</hi> day,<note place="margin">Ios<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

some amongst us see into what dangers they are falling.

for granted, which they cannot proove, that the Lords
Day succeeds into the place and rights of the <hi>Iewish
sabbath,</hi> and is to be observed by vertue of the fourth
Commandement: have trenched too neere upon the

which neither we nor our Fore-fathers were e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver
able to endure. But with what warrant they have
made a <hi>sabbath day,</hi> in the Christian Church, where there
was never any knowne in all times before; or upon what
authoritie they have presumed to lay heavy <hi>burthens</hi> upon
the <hi>consciences</hi> of poore men, which are <hi>free</hi> in <hi>Christ:</hi>
wee shall the better see by tracing downe the story from
our Saviours time, unto the times in which wee live.
But I will here set down and rest, beseeching God, who
enabled me thus farre, to guide me onwards to the end. <q>Tu qui principio medium, medio adjice finem.</q>

Our former Book wee destinated to the <hi>Iewish</hi>

was before we found it, yet at the last we found
a <hi>Sabbath.</hi> A <hi>Sabbath</hi> which began with that
state and Church, and ended also when they
were no longer to be called a Nation; but a
dispersed and scattered ruine of what once they
were. In that which followeth, our enquirie must
be more diffused, of the same latitude with the

good hopes, that by presenting to their view, the
constant practise of Gods Church in all times
before, and the consent of all Gods Churches at
this present; they may be dispossessed thereof
without great difficulty. It is but <hi>anima super<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flua,</hi>
as <hi>Buxdorfius</hi> cals it; and may be better
spared, then kept, because <hi>superfluous.</hi> Howe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver
<hi>I</hi> shall easily perswade my selfe, that by this
generall representation of the estate and practise
of the Church of Christ, <hi>I</hi> may confirme the wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vering,
<pb facs="tcp:4215:117"/>
in a right perswasion; and assure such
as are already well affected, by shewing them the
perfect harmonie and agreement, which is be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tweene
this Church and the purest times. It is
our constant prayer to almighty God, aswell that
he would <hi>strengthen such as do stand,</hi> and
<hi>confirme the weake,</hi> as to <hi>raise up</hi> those men
which are <hi>fallen</hi> into sinne and errour. As are
our prayers, such should be also our endeavours;
as universall to all sorts of men, as charitable to
them in their severall cases and distresses. Happy
those men, who do aright discharge their duties,
both in their prayers, and their performance.
The blessing of our labours we must leave to him,
who is <hi>all</hi> in <hi>all:</hi> without whom all <hi>Pauls plant<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing,</hi>
and <hi>Apollos watering,</hi> will yeeld poore <hi>in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crease.</hi>
In which of these three states soever thou
art, good Christian Reader, let me be seech thee
kindly to accept his pains; which for thy sake
were undertaken: that so be might, in some poore
measure, be an instrument, to <hi>strengthen</hi> or
<hi>confirme,</hi> or <hi>raise</hi> thee, as thy case requires.
This is the most that I desire, and lesse then this
thou couldst not do, did I not desire it. And so
fare thee well.</p>

do, both when he lived a private life, to frequent the
<hi>Synagogue;</hi> that other men might do the like, by his good
example: and after when he undertooke the <hi>ministerie,</hi>
to expound the Law unto them, there; that they might
be the better by his good instructions. Yet did not be

dayes the like prerogative, with the <hi>sabbath;</hi> so many
other wayes, did he abate that estimation, which gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rally
the people had conceived of the <hi>sabbath</hi> day. And
howsoever the opinion which the people generally had
conceived thereof, was grounded, as the times then were,
on superstition rather, then true sence of pietie: yet that
opinion once abated, it was more easily prepared for a
dissolution; and went away at last, with lesse noise and

because <hi>Christ,</hi> that day, did rise again from death to life,

in holy <hi>Scripture,</hi> touching the <hi>first day of the weeke,</hi> is
that upon that day, the <hi>Holy Ghost</hi> did first come downe
on the <hi>Apostles:</hi> and that upon the same Saint <hi>Peter</hi>
preached his first Sermon unto the <hi>Iewes,</hi> and baptized
such of them as beleeved: there being add<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

the Feast of <hi>Pentecost,</hi> which fell that yeare upon the
Sunday, or <hi>first day of the weeke,</hi> as elsewhere the Scripture
calls it: but as it was a speciall and a casuall thing, so can
it yeeld but little proofe, if it yeeld us any, that the <hi>Lords
Day</hi> was then observed; or that the <hi>Holy Ghost</hi> did by se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lecting
of that day for his descent on the <hi>Apostles,</hi> intend
<pb n="14" facs="tcp:4215:124"/>
to dignifie it for <hi>Sabbath.</hi> For first it was a casuall thing,
that <hi>Pentecost</hi> should fall that yeare upon the <hi>Sunday.</hi> It
was a <hi>moveable Feast</hi> as unto the day, such as did change
and shift it selfe, according to the position of the Feast of

                           <hi>Scaliger</hi> hath

<hi>Pentocost</hi> 
                           <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                              <desc>•</desc>

did chance to fall upon the <hi>Tewsday,</hi> the <hi>Pentecost</hi> fell that
yeare, upon the <hi>Wednesday: &amp; sic de coeteris.</hi> And if the

                                 <desc>•</desc>
                              </gap>t
can be drawne from a casuall fact;</hi> and that the falling of
the <hi>Pentecost,</hi> that yeare, upon the <hi>first day of the weeke,</hi>
be meerly <hi>casuall:</hi> the comming of <hi>the Holy Ghost</hi> upon
that day, will be no argument nor authority, to state the
<hi>first day of the weeke,</hi> in the place and honour of the <hi>Iewish
sabbath.</hi> There may be other reasons given, why God
made choice of that time, rather then of any other: as first
because about that very time before, he had proclaimed
the <hi>Law</hi> upon Mount <hi>Sinai;</hi> and secondly, that so hee
might the better countenance and grace the <hi>Gospel,</hi> in the
sight of men, and adde the more authority unto the do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrine
of the <hi>Apostles.</hi> The Feast of <hi>Pentecost</hi> was a great
and famous Festivall, at which the <hi>Iewes,</hi> all of them,
were to come unto <hi>Hierusalem,</hi> there to appeare before
the Lord: and amongst others, those which had their
hands in our Saviours <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="3 letters">

                           </gap>ud. And therefore as S. <hi>Chry<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sostome</hi>
notes it, did God send down the Holy Ghost, at
that time of <hi>Pentecost;</hi>
                           <note place="margin">In Act. 2.</note> because those men that did con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sent

as that Father
hath it. So that the thing being <hi>casuall,</hi> as unto the <hi>day;</hi>
and <hi>speciall,</hi> as unto the <hi>businesse</hi> then by God intended:
it will afforde us little proofe, as before I said, either that
the <hi>Lords Day</hi> was, as then, observed; or that the <hi>Holy
Ghost</hi> did select that day for so great a worke, to dignifie
it for a <hi>sabbath.</hi>
                        </p>
                        <p>(6) As for Saint <hi>Peters preaching</hi> upon that day, and
the baptizing of so many, as were converted to the faith,
upon the same: it might have been some proofe, that now
at lest, if not before, the <hi>first day of the weeke</hi> was set a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>part
by the <hi>Apostles</hi> for <hi>religious exercises:</hi> had they not
honoured <hi>all dayes</hi> with the same performances. But if
we search the <hi>Scriptures</hi> we shall easily find that all dayes
were alike to them, in that respect: no day, in which they
did not preach the word of life, and administer the Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>craments
of their Lord and Saviour, to such as either
wanted it, or did desire it. Or were it that the <hi>Scriptures</hi>
had not told us of it, yet <hi>naturall reason</hi> would informe
us, that those who were imployed in so great a worke, as
the <hi>conversion</hi> of the <hi>World,</hi> could not confine themselues
unto times and seasons; but must take all advantages,
whensoere they came. But for the <hi>Scripture,</hi> it is said in
termes expresse, first generally, that the <hi>Lord added</hi> daily
<hi>to the Church, such as should be saved;</hi>

<hi>first day of the weeke;</hi> and so it was no <hi>Lords day</hi> dutie:

more convenient time, and indeed <hi>opus diei in die suo,</hi> the

hapned in the forty sixt yeare of Christs Nativity; some

after this, did the <hi>Apostle</hi> shew himselfe in the <hi>Iewish

of here together, that so wee may go on unto the rest of

those many texts of Scripture, when it is said of him that
he went into the <hi>Synagogues,</hi> and therefore probably that
it was upon the <hi>Sabbath,</hi> as before wee said. Not that
Saint <hi>Paul</hi> was so affected to the <hi>Sabbath,</hi> as to preferre
that day before any other: but that he found the people at
those times assembled, and so might preach the Word,
with the greater profit.<note place="margin">In Acts 13. 14.</note> Saint <hi>Chrysostome,</hi> for the <hi>Anci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ents</hi>

we can finde nothing yet, by that name at least. The
Scripture tels us somewhat, that S. <hi>Paul</hi> did at <hi>Troas,
upon the first day of the weeke:</hi> Which happening much
about this time, comes in this place to be considered.
The passage in the Text stands thus: <hi>Vpon the first day of
the weeke when the disciples came together to breake bread,<note place="margin">Act. 20. 7.</note>
Paul preached unto them ready to depart on the morrow,
and continued his speech untill midnight.</hi> Take notice here,
that <hi>Paul</hi> had tarried there, <hi>seven dayes,</hi> before this hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pened.
Now in this Text there are two things to be con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sidered;
first what was done upon that day; and second<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
what day it was, that is there remembred. First for the
action, it is said to be <hi>breaking of bread:</hi> which some con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clude,
to be <hi>administring</hi> the <hi>Sacrament</hi> of the <hi>Lords Sup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per;</hi>
and <hi>Pauls</hi> discourse which followed on it, to be a
<hi>Sermon.</hi> But sure I am Saint <hi>Chrysost<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

&amp;c. <q>Their meeting at that time, saith he,
was not especially to receive instruction from Saint
<hi>Paul,</hi> but to <hi>eate bread</hi> with him: and there, upon oc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>casion
given, he discoursed unto them. See, saith the
Father, how they all made bold with S. <hi>Pauls</hi> table,
as it had beene common to them all: and as it seemes
to me, saith he,</q> 
                           <hi>Paul</hi> sitting at the table did discourse
thus with them. Therefore it seemes by him, that as the
meeting was at an ordinary supper; so the discourse there
happening was no Sermon properly, but an occasionall
dispute. <hi>Lyra</hi> affirmes the same, and doth glosse it thus.
<hi>They came together to breake bread,</hi> i. e. saith he, <hi>Pro re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fectione
corporali,</hi> for the refection and support of their
bodies onely: and being there, <hi>Paul preached unto them,</hi>
or as the <hi>Greeke</hi> and <hi>Latine</hi> have it, hee <hi>disputed</hi> with
them; <hi>prius eos reficiens pane verbi divini,</hi> refreshing of
them first with the bread of life. This also seemes to be
the meaning of the <hi>Church</hi> of <hi>England,</hi>

Or if they did not meet till the day it selfe, since it is

that it was in use in <hi>Ignatius</hi> time, (who suffered in the

this, that at a certaine day, (but what that day was

If any one did fast either upon the

as <hi>Ignatius</hi> is, onely because it speakes against the <hi>Satur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dayes</hi>
fast. Whereof consult the <hi>Annales</hi> Ann. 102.
Now as <hi>Ignatius</hi> labours here, to advance the <hi>sabbath,</hi> in
opposition of those hereticks before remembred, making
it equally a festivall with the <hi>Lords day:</hi> so being to deale
with those, which too much magnified the <hi>sabbath,</hi> and
thought the <hi>Christians</hi> bound unto it, as the <hi>Iews</hi> had

thus. <gap reason="foreign">

                           </gap>, &amp;c.
<q>Let us not keep the <hi>Sabbath</hi> in a <hi>Iewish</hi> manner, in sloth

shall not eate,</hi> and <hi>in the sweat of thy brows shalt
thou eate thy bread.</hi> But let us keepe it after a spirituall
fashion, not in bodily ease, but in the studie of the law:
not eating meat drest yesterday, or drinking luke<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>warme
drinks, or walking out a limited space, or set<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling
our delights,</q> as they did, on dancing; but in the
contemplation of the works of God. <gap reason="foreign">

So that we see, that he would have both dayes
observed: the <hi>Sabbath</hi> first, though not as would the

which he so much magnifieth, the better to abate that
high esteeme, which some had cast upon the <hi>Sabbath.</hi>
Agreeable unto this we finde that in the <hi>Constitutions</hi> of
the <hi>Apostles,</hi> for by that name they passe, though not
made by them, both dayes are ordered to be kept <hi>holy,</hi>

Some which have looked more nearely into the reasons

Magus,</hi> which being to be done on <hi>a Sunday</hi> follow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing,
the <hi>Church</hi> of <hi>Rome</hi> ordained a solemne fast on the
day before, the better to obtaine Gods blessing in so great
a businesse: which falling out as they desired, they kept it
for a fasting day for ever after. Saint <hi>Austin</hi> so relates it,
as a generall and received opinion, but then he adde<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

<hi>Quod eam esse falsam perhibeant plerique Romani;</hi> That
very many of the <hi>Romans</hi> did take it onely for a fable. As
for Saint <hi>Austin,</hi> he conceives the reason of it, to be the
severall uses which men made of our Saviours resting in
the grave, the whole <hi>Sabbath</hi> day. For thence it came to
passe, saith he, that some, especially the <hi>Easterne</hi> people,
<hi>Adrequiem significandam mallent relaxare jejunium,</hi> to
signifie and denote that rest, did not use to fast: where on
the other side, those of the <hi>Church</hi> of <hi>Rome</hi> and some
<hi>Westerne Churches,</hi> kept it alwayes fasting, <hi>Propter hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>militatem
mortis Domini,</hi> by reason that our Lord, that
day, lay buried in the sleepe of death. But as the Father
comes not home unto the reason of this usage, in the
<hi>Easterne</hi> countries; so in my minde, Pope <hi>Innocent</hi> gives
a likelier reason for the contrary custome, in the <hi>Westerne,</hi>

expresse some difference, between <hi>Iewes</hi> and <hi>Christians.</hi>
A thing of great importance in the present case. For the
<hi>Christians</hi> of the <hi>East</hi> reflected not upon the <hi>Sunday</hi> in
the Annuall returne of so great a Feast; but kept it on
the fourteenth day of the moneth, be it what it will: it
may be very strongly gathered, that they regarded not
the Lords Day so highly, which was the weekly memory
of the resurrection, as to preferre that day before any o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther,
in their publick meetings. And thereupon <hi>Baronius</hi>
pleads it very well, that certainly Saint <hi>Iohn</hi> was not the
Authour of the contrary practice, as some gave it out.

of good credit in the <hi>Church,</hi> had it not got that name

                           </hi> with
the <hi>Iewes,</hi> on what day soever. Rather we may conceive
that Saint <hi>Iohn</hi> gave way unto the current of the times,

the customes of the <hi>Iewes:</hi> most of the <hi>Christians</hi> of

doth thus relate,<note place="margin">Apolog <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

&amp;c. <q>Vpon the <hi>Sunday</hi> all of us assemble in
the Congregation: as being that first day wherein
God separating the light and darknesse, did create the
world; and <hi>Iesus Christ</hi> our Saviour rose againe from
the dead. This for the day; then for the service of the
day, he describes it thus. Vpon the day called <hi>Sunday,</hi>

<hi>Apostles,</hi> and writings of the <hi>Prophets,</hi> as much as is
appointed, are read unto us. The <hi>Reader</hi> having done,
the Priest or Prelate ministreth a word of exhortation,
that we do imitate those good things which are there
repeated. Then standing up together, we send up our
prayers unto the Lord; which ended, there is delive<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red
unto every one of us,</q> bread, and wine with water.
After all this the Priest or Prelate offers up our prayers and
thanksgiving as much as in him is, to God; and all the

during our whole lives, and on all occasions.
The Royall Prophet tels us that he praysed God seven

much lesse on any Festivals, or dayes assigned; but in all
places honours God, though he be alone. And a little
after, <gap reason="foreign">

                              </gap>, &amp;c. making our
whole lives a continuall Festivall, and knowing God
to be every where, wee prayse him sometimes in the
fields, and sometimes sailing on the Seas, and finally in
all the times of our life what ever. So in another place
of the self-same book, <gap reason="foreign">
                                 <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>

then keeps the <hi>Lords Day,</hi> when he casts away every
evill thought, and doing things with knowledge and
understanding, doth glorifie the Lord in his resurre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction.</q>
By which it seemes, that whatsoever estimati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
the <hi>Lords Day</hi> had attained unto, at <hi>Rome,</hi> and <hi>Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rinth:</hi>
yet either it was not so much esteemed at <hi>Alex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>andria,</hi>
or else this <hi>Clemens</hi> did not thinke so rightly of it,
as he should have done.</p>
                        <p>(7) Now in the place of <hi>Iustin Martyr</hi> before re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>membred,
there is one speciall circumstance to be consi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red
in reference to our present search: for I say nothing
here of mingling water with the Wine, in the holy Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crament,
<pb n="52" facs="tcp:4215:143"/>
as not conducinng to the businesse which wee
have in hand. This is, that in their <hi>Sundayes</hi> service, they
did use to <hi>stand,</hi> during the time they made their <hi>prayers</hi>
unto the Lord: <gap reason="foreign">
                              <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                           </gap>,
as his words there are. Such was the custome of
this time, and a long time after; that though they <hi>kneeled</hi>
on other dayes, yet on the <hi>Lords day</hi> they prayed alwayes
<hi>standing.</hi> Yet not upon the <hi>Lords day</hi> onely, but <hi>every day</hi>
from <hi>Easter</hi> unto <hi>Pentecost.</hi> The reason is thus given by
him who made the <hi>Responsions</hi> ascribed to <hi>Iustin;</hi> 
                           <q>that so
saith he, we might take notice, as of our fall by sin, so of
our restitution by the grace of <hi>Christ.</hi>
                              <note place="margin">Resp<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

But on the <hi>Lords Day</hi> wee bow not the knee in token
of the Resurrection; by which according to the Grace
of Christ, wee are set free from sinne, and the powers
of death.</q> The like saith he, is to be said of the dayes of
<hi>Pentecost,</hi> which custome as he tels us, and cites <hi>Irenaus</hi>
for his Authour, did take beginning even in the times of
the <hi>Apostles.</hi> Rather wee may conceive that they used
this Ceremony, to testifie their faith in the <hi>resurrection</hi> of
our Lord and <hi>Saviour:</hi> which many <hi>Heretick<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

                           </hi> of those
times did publickly gain-say, as before we noted, and shall
speak more thereof hereafter. But whatsoever was the
reason, it continued long; and was confirm'd particular<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
by the great Synod of <hi>Nice,</hi> what time so<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                              <desc>•</desc>
                           </gap>e people
had begun to neglect this custome. The Synod therefore
thus determined, <gap reason="foreign">
                              <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                           </gap>,<note place="margin">C<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

&amp;c. that forasmuch as some did use to kneele on
the <hi>Lords Day,</hi> and the time of <hi>Pentecost,</hi> that all things,
in all places, might be done with an uniformity, it pleased
the holy Synod to decree it thus; <gap reason="foreign">
                              <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                           </gap>,
that men should <hi>stand,</hi> at those times, when
they made their prayers. For Fathers which avow this
custome, consult <hi>Tertullian, lib. de corona mil. S. Basil. l.

by, I can hardly say: but sure I am it was not layed aside in
a long time after;<note place="margin">Decret. l. 2. tit. 9. c. 2.</note> not till the time of Pope <hi>Alexander</hi> the
third, who lived about the yeare 1160<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> For in a <hi>Decre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tall</hi>
of his, confirmatorie of the former custome; it was
prohibited to <hi>kneele</hi> on the times remembred; <hi>Nisi aliquis
ex devotione id velit facere in secreto,</hi> unlesse some out of
poore devotion, did it secretly. Which dispensation pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bablie
occasioned the neglect thereof, in the times succee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding:
the rather since those hereticks who formerly had
denied the resurrection, were now quite exterminated.
This circumstance we have considered the more at large,
as being the most especiall difference, whereby the <hi>Sun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dayes
service</hi> was distinguished from the <hi>weeke-dayes</hi>
worship, in these present times whereof we write. And
yet the difference was not such, but that it was proper to
the <hi>Lords day</hi> onely: but, if it were a badge of honour,
communicated unto more then forty other dayes: of
which more anon. But being it was an Ecclesiasticall and
occasionall custome; the Church which first ordained it,
let it fall againe by the same authoritie.</p>
                        <p>(8) In the third <hi>Centurie,</hi> the first we meete with is
<hi>Tertullian,</hi> who flourished in the very first beginnings
of it: by whom this day is called by three severall names.
For first he cals it <hi>Dies solis, Sunday,</hi> as commonly we
now call it; and saith, that they did dedicate the same un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to
mirth and gladnesse; not to devotion altogether:<note place="margin">Cap. 16.</note> 
                           <hi>Diem
solis laetitiae indulgemus,</hi> in his <hi>Apologetick.</hi> The same
name is used by <hi>Iustin Martyr</hi> in the passages before re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>membred:
partly because being to write to an heathen
<hi>Magistrate,</hi> it had not beene so proper, to call it by the
name of the <hi>Lords day,</hi> which name they knew not; and
partly that delivering the forme and substance of their
service done upon that day, they might the better quit
themselues, from being worshippers of the <hi>Sunne,</hi> as the
<hi>Gentiles</hi> thought. For by their meetings on this day for
<pb n="54" facs="tcp:4215:144"/>
religious exercises, in greater numbers, then on others,
in Africke and the West especially; and by their use of
turning towards the <hi>East,</hi> when they made their prayers,
the world was sometimes so perswaded. <hi>Inde suspic<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

quod innotuerit nos ad Orientis regionem precari,</hi> as he
there informed us. Whereby we may perceive of what
great antiquitie that custome is, which is retained in the
<hi>Church</hi> of <hi>England,</hi> of bowing, kneeling, and adoring
towards the <hi>Easterne</hi> parts. The second name by which

yet to be considered, which is the name wherby the <hi>Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stians</hi>

according as they found the time divided. The rather be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause
some are become oftended, that wee retaine those
names amongst us, which were to us commended by our
Ancestours, and to them, by theirs. Where first we must
take notice, that the <hi>Iewes</hi> in honour of their <hi>Sabbath,</hi> u<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed
to referre their times to that; distinguishing their
dayes by <hi>Prima Sabbati, Secunda Sabbati,</hi> and so untill
they came to the <hi>Sabbath</hi> it selfe: as on the other side the
<hi>Gentiles,</hi> following the motions of the <hi>Planets,</hi> gave to
each day the name of that particular <hi>Planet,</hi> by which the
first houre of the day was governed, as their <hi>Astrologers</hi>
had taught them, Now the <hi>Apostles</hi> being <hi>Iewes,</hi> retai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned
the custome of the <hi>Iewes;</hi> and for that reason called

Gods service on that day; at least not bee a meanes to

that <hi>Artificers</hi> without any publicke discommodity,
might for that time forbeare their ordinary labours: hee

comming to the Emperours notice, who was a friend of
liberty, and could not but well understand, how accep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>table
a thing it was to God, that workes of charity and

him to send out a second Edict, in the <hi>Iuly</hi> following,

but he affirmes this of them, <hi>divinis canticis personantis,

solemnized with spirituall Hymnes, and religious Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mons:
and that the people used to emptie out their soules
to God in fervent and affectionate Prayers, <hi>non sine lachry<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mis

<hi>Theodoret,</hi> he lived and flourished in the yeare 420. and
speakes of these <hi>Festivalls</hi> (S. <hi>Peter</hi> and S. <hi>Thomas</hi> and S.

which had beene setled and established a long time be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore:

                        <p>(7) Next let us looke upon the <hi>Sunday,</hi> what they
did on that. For though it pleased the Emperour, by his
royall edict to permit workes of <hi>husbandry</hi> in the <hi>Country</hi>
and <hi>manumissions</hi> in the <hi>Citties,</hi> on that sacred day: yet
probably there were some pure and pious soules, who
would not take the benefit of the declaration; or thinke
themselves beholding to him for so injurious and pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fane
a dispensation. This we will search into exactly,
that so the truth may be discovered. And first beginning
with the Councell of <hi>Eliberis,</hi> (a Towne of <hi>Spaine)</hi> in
the beginning of this Age, it was thus decreed. <hi>Si quis

                           <note place="margin">Can. 21.</note> 
                           <hi>per tres dominicas ecclesiam non accesserit

inhabitant of the Citties absent himselfe from <hi>Church,</hi>
three Lords dayes together, let him be kept as long from
the holy Sacrament, that he may seeme corrected for it.

<hi>Hierome</hi> have observed it, as a thing notable in his

<hi>Paula,</hi> a most devout and pious woman, who lived in

<hi>Widdowes,</hi> in manner of a Nunnery. Of whom he saith
that every <hi>Lords day</hi> they repared to the Church of
God: <hi>Et inde pariter revertentes instabant operi distribu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to,

for a man to looke unto his worldly businesse,
on the <hi>Lords day,</hi> after the congregation was dismissed:
so here the Fathers seeme to dispense with those, who
went unto the <hi>common shewes,</hi> being worldly pleasures,
though otherwise of no good name, as before we sayd,
in case they did not pretermit Gods publicke ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vice.
Therefore wee safely may conclude, that they

conceived it not unlawfull for any man to follow his ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nest

a thing more questionable; and probably as the <hi>dauncings</hi>
were in the former times, it might not be suffered: nay,
which is more, it had beene infinite scandall to the
<hi>Church,</hi> if they had permitted it. For we may please
to know, that in the <hi>dancings</hi> used of old, throughout the
principall Citties of the <hi>Roman</hi> Empire, there was much
impurity and immodesty; such as was not to bee beheld
by a <hi>Christian</hi> eye. Some times they <hi>danced</hi> starke <hi>naked,</hi>
and that not privately alone,<note place="margin">Orat. in Pis. Art. 3. in verrem.</note> but in publicke feasts. This
<hi>Cicero</hi> objects against <hi>Lucius Piso, quod in convivio salta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ret
nudus;</hi> the same he also casts in the teeth of <hi>verres:</hi> and
<hi>Deiotarus</hi> was accused of the like immodesty, whereof
perhaps he was not guilty. As for the <hi>Women</hi> they had
armed themselves with the like strange impudency and
though they <hi>daunced</hi> not naked in the open streetes, yet
would be hired to attend naked at publicke feasts, and af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
prostitute themselves unto those guests, for entertein<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
of the which, they were thither brought, whereof
see <hi>Athenaeus Dipnos. l. 12. &amp; Sueton. in Tiberio, cap 42.
43.</hi> And for their <hi>dancings</hi> in the publicke, they studied
all those cunning and provoking Arts<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> by which they
might entice young men to wantonnesse, and inflame
their lusts; using lascivious gestures, and mingling with
their <hi>dances</hi> most <hi>immodest</hi> songs: nay, which is more
than this, sometimes of purpose laying open to the eye
and view of the spectatour, those parts which woman<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hood
and common honesty would not have uncovered.

Yet thinke not that all <hi>women</hi> were so lewdly given,

which most used those arts to increase their custome,
such as were mustered up by<note n="a" place="margin">Athen. Dip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nos. l. 12. c 13.</note>

Now to these common publicke <hi>dancings,</hi> the
people in the <hi>Roman</hi> Empire had beene much accusto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med,
especially in their height of fortune, wherein they
were extreamely riotous and luxurions. And unto these
too many innocent soules both young men and women,
in the first ages of the <hi>Church</hi> used to repare sometimes
for their recreation, onely to looke upon the sport: and
seeing those uncomely gestures, and uncivill sights,
went backe sometimes possessed with unchaste desires
<pb n="87" facs="tcp:4215:161"/>
and loose affections, which might perhaps breake out at
last in dishonest actions. This made the Fathers of this
Age, and of some that followed, inveigh, as generally a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainst
all <hi>dancings,</hi> as most unlawfull in themselves; so
more particularly, against the sport it selfe, and behol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding
of the same, upon those dayes which were appoin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted

in the Church, for such a custome may be gathered both
out of <hi>Origen</hi> and <hi>Tertullian,</hi> in the age before: but that
this age affords us the most cleare and perfect evidence,
for the proofe thereof. So for the musicke used in the
Congregation, it grew more exquisite in these times
than it had beene formerly: that which before was one<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
a melodious kind of pronunciation, being now or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dered
into a more exact and artificiall harmonie. This
change was principally occasioned by a Canon of the
Councell of <hi>Laodicea,</hi> in the first entrance of this age<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
For where before it was permitted unto all promiscu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ously
to sing in the Church; it was observed that in such
dissonancie of voyces, and most of them unskilfull in the
notes of musicke, there was no small jarring and unplea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sant

that none should sing hereafter in the Congregation, but
such as were Canonically appointed to it, and skilfull in
it. By meanes whereof before the shutting up of

very perfect and harmonious;<note place="margin">Confess. l. 10. cap. 33.</note>

that it did worke exceedingly on the affections of the

inflame their mindes with a more lively flame of
piety; taking them prisoners by the eares, and so con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ducting
them unto the glories of Gods kingdome.<note place="margin">Ibid.</note> S.
<hi>Austin</hi> attributes a great cause of conversion, to the pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers

The like he also tells us, in his ninth Booke of
<hi>Confessions,</hi> and sixth Chapter. Nor doubt we but it did
produce the same effect on divers others; who comming
to the Churches, as he then did, to bee partaker of the
musicke return'd prepared in minde, &amp; well disposed in
their intentions, to be converted unto God. Now that

that none should goe to other places, under

                        </p>
                        <p>(12) Thus doe wee see upon what grounds the <hi>Lords
day</hi> stands; on <hi>custome</hi> first, and voluntary consecration of
it to <hi>religious meetings;</hi> that <hi>custome</hi> countenanced by
the <hi>authority</hi> of the Church of God, which tacitely ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proved
the same; and finally confirmed and ratified by
<hi>Christian</hi> Princes throughout their Empires. And as the
day, so <hi>rest</hi> from <hi>labours</hi> and restraint from businesse up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
that day, received its greatest strength from the su<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preme
<hi>magistrate,</hi> as long as hee reteined that power
which to him belonged, as after from the <hi>Canons</hi> and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crees
of <hi>Councells,</hi> the <hi>Decretalls</hi> of <hi>Popes,</hi> and orders of
particular <hi>Prelates,</hi> when the sole managing of Ecclesia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sticall
affaires was committed to them. I hope it was
not so with the former <hi>Sabbath,</hi> which neyther tooke
originall from custome, that people being not so for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward
to give God a day; nor required any countenance
or authority from the Kings of <hi>Israel</hi> to confirme and ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tifie
it. The <hi>Lord</hi> had spake the word, that hee would
<pb n="94" facs="tcp:4215:165"/>
have one day in seaven, precisely the <hi>seventh day</hi> from
the worlds <hi>creation,</hi> to be a day of rest unto all his peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple:
which sayd, there was no more to doe, but gladly
to submit and obey his pleasure; <hi>nec qui<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                                 <desc>•</desc>
                              </gap>quam reliquum
erat praeter obsequij gloriam,</hi> in the greatest Prince. And
this done all at once, not by degrees, by little and little,
as he could see the people affected to it, or as hee found
it fittest for them; like a <hi>probation Law</hi> made to conti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nue
till the <hi>next session,</hi> and then on further liking, to
hold good for ever; but by a plaine and peremptory or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der
that it should be so, without further tryall. But thus
it was not done in our present businesse. The <hi>Lords day</hi>
had no such command that it should bee <hi>sanctified,</hi> but
was left plainely to Gods people, to pitch on this, or
any other, for the <hi>publicke</hi> use. And being taken up a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mongst
them, and made a day of meeting in the congre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gation
for religious exercises; yet for 300. yeares there
was neyther <hi>Law</hi> to binde them to it, nor any <hi>rest</hi> from
<hi>labour</hi> or from worldly businesses required upon it. And
when it seemed good unto <hi>Christian Princes,</hi> the nursing
Fathers of Gods Church, to lay restraints upon their peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple,
yet at the first they were not generall: but onely
thus, that certaine men in certaine places should lay aside
their ordinary and daily workes, to attend Gods service
in the Church; those whose employments were most
toylesome, and most repugnant to the true nature of a
<hi>Sabbath,</hi> being allowed to follow and pursue their la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bours,
because most necessary to the Common-wealth.
And in the following times, when as the <hi>Prince</hi> and <hi>Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>late,</hi>
in their severall places, indeavoured to restraine
them from that also, which formerly they had permitted,
and interdicted almost all kinde of bodily labour upon
that day; it was not brought about without much strug<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling,
and on opposition of the people: more than a thou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sand
yeares being past, after <hi>Christs ascention,</hi> before the
<hi>Lords day</hi> had attained that state in which now it stan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deth;
as will appeare at full in the following story. And
<pb n="95" facs="tcp:4215:165"/>
being brought unto that state, wherein now it stands, it
doth not stand so firmely and on such sure grounds but
that those powers which raised it up, may take it lower
if they please<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> 
                           <hi>yea take it quite away, as unto the time, and
settle it on any other day, as to them seemes best,</hi> which is
the doctrine of some <hi>Schoole men,</hi> and diverse <hi>Protestant
writers</hi> of great name and credit in the world? A power
which no man will presume to say was ever chalenged
by the <hi>Iewes</hi> over the <hi>Sabbath.</hi> Besides, all things are
plainely contrary in these two dayes, as to the purpose
&amp; intent of the <hi>institution.</hi> For in the <hi>Sabbath,</hi> that which
was principally aimed at, was <hi>rest</hi> from <hi>labour,</hi> that ney<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
they nor any that belonged unto them, should <hi>doe
any manner of worke</hi> upon that day, but sit still, and rest
themselves. Their meditating on Gods Word, or on his
goodnes, manifested in the worlds Creation, was to that
an <hi>accessory:</hi> and as for <hi>reading</hi> of the <hi>Law</hi> in the Congre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gation,
that was not taken up in more than 1000. yeares
after the <hi>Law</hi> was given; and being taken up came in by
<hi>ecclesiasticall</hi> ordinance onely, no <hi>divine</hi> authority. But in
the <hi>institution</hi> of the <hi>Lords day,</hi> that which was principal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
aimed at, was the performance of religious and Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stian
duties hearing the <hi>Word,</hi> receiving of the <hi>Sacra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments,</hi>
praysing the <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

                           </gap>ord for all his mercies, and <hi>praying</hi> to
him joyntly with the <hi>Congregation,</hi> for the continuance
of the same <hi>Rest</hi> and cessation from the workes of <hi>labour,</hi>
came not in till afterwards; and then but as an <hi>accessory</hi>
to the former duties, and that not setled and established
in a 1000. yeare, as before was sayd<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> when all the proper
and peculiar duties of the day, had beene at their perfecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on

or the <hi>authority</hi> by which they were so instituted;
the <hi>end</hi> and <hi>purpose</hi> at the which they principally aimed,
or the <hi>proceedings</hi> in the setling and confirming of them:
the difference will be<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> found so great, that of the <hi>Lords

day</hi> all the honour of an <hi>holy festivall.</hi> Yet was not this
done all at once, but by degrees: the fift and sixt <hi>Centu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries</hi>
being well nigh spent, before it came unto that
height, which hath since continued. The <hi>Emperours</hi> and
the <hi>Prelates</hi> in these times had the same affections; both
earnest to advance this <hi>day</hi> above all others, and to the
<hi>Edicts</hi> of the one, and Ecclesiasticall <hi>constitutions</hi> of the
other, it stands indebted for many of those priviledges
and exemptions, which it still enjoyeth. But by degrees,
as now I sayd, and not all at once: For in S. <hi>Austins</hi> time,
who lived in the beginning of this fift Century, it was
no otherwise with the <hi>Lords day</hi> then as it was before, in
the former Age; accounted one of those set dayes, &amp; pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bably
the principall which was designed, and set apart for
Gods publicke worship. Amongst the writings of that
Father, which are his unquestionably, we finde not much
that doth conduce to our present businesse: but what
we finde, we shall communicate, with as much brevity

populus praesens erat. Facto silentio, divinarum Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turarum
lecta sunt solennia, &amp;c. Easter</hi> was come, and on
<q>the <hi>Lords day</hi> in the morning the people had assembled
themselves together. All being silent and attent, those
<hi>lessons</hi> out of holy Scripture, which were appointed
for the time were read unto them, when wee were
come unto that part of the publicke service,
which was allotted for the <hi>Sermon,</hi> I spake unto
them what was proper for the present festivall, and
most agreeable to the time. Service being done<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> I tooke
the man along to dinner, (a man hee meanes, that had
recovered very strangely in the Church that morning)</q>
who told us all the story of those sad calamities, which
had befallen him. This is not much but in this little
there are two things worth our observation. First, that
the <hi>Sermon</hi> in those times was not accounted eyther the
onely, or the principall part of Gods publicke service;
but onely had a place in the <hi>Common Liturgy:</hi> which
place was probably the same, which it still retaines, <hi>post
Scripturarum solennia,</hi> after the reading of the <hi>Gospel.</hi>
Next that it was not thought unlawfull in this Fathers
time to talke of <hi>secular</hi> and humane affaires upon this
day, as some now imagine; or to call <hi>friends</hi> or stran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gers
to our <hi>Table,</hi> as it is supposed: S. <hi>Austin</hi> being one
of so strict a life, that he would rather have put off the
invitation and the story both to another day; had hee so
conceived it. Nor doth the Father speake of <hi>Sunday,</hi> as
if it were the onely <hi>festivall</hi> that was to be observed of
a <hi>Christian</hi> man.<note place="margin">Cont. Adi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mant. c. <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

tells us of. First generally, <hi>Nos quoque &amp; dominicum di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>em,
&amp; Pascha, solenniter celebramus, &amp; quaslibet alias

hee enumerates some particulars too,<note place="margin">Epi. 118.</note> the <hi>resurrection,
passion,</hi> and <hi>ascention</hi> of our Lord &amp; Saviour, together with
the <hi>comming of the holy Ghost:</hi> which constantly were cele<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brated,
<hi>anniversaria solennitate.</hi> Not that there were
no other <hi>festivalls</hi> then observed in the <hi>Christian Church,</hi>
but that those foure were reckoned to be <hi>Apostolicall<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
                           </hi>
and had beene generally received in all ages past. As
for the <hi>Sacrament,</hi> it was not tyed to any day, but was
administred indifferently, upon all alike, except it were
in some few places, where it had beene restrained to this
day alone. <hi>Alij quotidie communicant corpori &amp; sanguini

As for those workes ascribed unto him, which eyther are
not his, or at least are questionable; they informe us
thus: The tract <hi>de rectitudine Cathol<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> conversationis,</hi> ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viseth
us to be attent and silent all the time of Divine
Service, not telling tales, nor falling into jarres and quar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rells,
as being to answer such of us as offend therein, for
a double fault: <hi>Dum nec ipse verbum Dei audit, nec alios
audire permittit,</hi> as neyther hearkening to the Word of
God our selves, nor permitting others. In the 251.
Sermon, inscribed <hi>De tempore,</hi> wee are commanded to
lay aside all worldly businesses, <hi>in solennitatibus sancto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rum,
&amp; maxime in dominicis diebus,</hi> upon the festivalls of
the <hi>Saints,</hi> but the <hi>Lords day</hi> specially: that wee may
be the readier for divine imployments: Where note, that
whosoever made the <hi>Sermon,</hi> it was his purpose, that
on the <hi>Saints dayes</hi> men were to forbeare all worldly bu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sinesses;
and not upon the <hi>Lords day</hi> onely, though on
that especially. And in the same it is affirmed, that the
<hi>Lords day</hi> was instituted by the <hi>Doctors</hi> of the <hi>Church,
Apostles</hi> and <hi>Apostolicall men;</hi> the honours of the <hi>Iewish

that those who are pressed with so poore a fancie, (and
some such there be) would please to be as carefull of the
<hi>holy dayes,</hi> as of the <hi>Sundayes,</hi> being alike expressed in
the Prohibition: One may conjecture easily both by the
stile, and by the state of things then being, in the Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stian
Church, that neyther of these Sermons (not to say
any thing of the rest which concerne us not) could be
writ by <hi>Austin</hi> the latter, every thing therein considered
by no man of wisedome.</p>
                        <p>(2) I say as things then were in the <hi>Christian Church,</hi>
that <hi>Sermon</hi> was not likely to bee Saint <hi>Austines.</hi> It had
beene too much rashnesse to prohibit <hi>hunting,</hi> being in it
selfe a lawfull sport: when such as in themselves were
extreamely evill, and an occasion of much sinne, were
not yet put downe. The <hi>Cirque</hi> and <hi>Theater</hi> were fre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quented
hitherto, aswell upon the <hi>Lords day</hi> as on any
other: and they were first to be removed, before it could
be seasonable to inhibit a lawfull pleasure. Somewhat
to this effect, was done in the Age before: the Empe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rours
<hi>Gratian, Valentinian,</hi> and <hi>Theodosius,</hi> having made
a law that no man should exhibit any publicke shew up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
the <hi>Sunday,</hi> as before we noted. But this prevailed
not at the first. And thereupon the Fathers of the Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cell
of <hi>Carthage,</hi> in the first yeare of this first Centurie,
did then and there decree by publicke order, to make pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tition
to the Emperour then being: <hi>ut spectacula thea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trorum,
coeterorumque ludorum die dominica, vel coeteris
religionis Christianae diebus solennibus, amoveantur, &amp;c.</hi>
                           <pb n="102" facs="tcp:4215:169"/>
Their suite was double, first that the <hi>shewes</hi> exhibited on
the <hi>theaters,</hi> and other plaies then used, might no more be
suffered on the <hi>Lords day,</hi> or any other <hi>festivall</hi> of the
<hi>Christian</hi> Church, especially on the <hi>Octaves</hi> of the feast
of <hi>Easter,</hi> what time the people used to goe in greater
numbers unto the <hi>Cirque</hi> or shew-place, than the house
of God. Then that for other dayes, no man might bee
<hi>compelled</hi> to repare unto them, (as they had beene for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>merly)
as being absolutely repugnant unto Gods com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mandements:
but that all people should be left at liber<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty
to goe or not to goe, as they would themselves.
<hi>Nec oportere quenquam christianorum ad haec spectacula
cogi &amp;c. Sed uti oportet homo in libera voluntate subsistat,
sibi divinitus concessa;</hi> so the <hi>Canon.</hi> The Emperour
<hi>Theodosius</hi> thereupon enacted, that on the <hi>Lords day,</hi> on
the feast of <hi>Christs Nativity,</hi> and after to the <hi>Epiphanie</hi>
or <hi>twelfth day,</hi> as we call it commonly; as also on the
feast of <hi>Easter,</hi> and from thence to <hi>Whitsontide,</hi> the <hi>Cir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ques</hi>
&amp; <hi>Theaters</hi> in all places should be shut up: that so all

were chased and hunted up and downe, by such as

(for there these sports were sometimes held)
<hi>crudelium &amp; funestorum ludorum diebus,</hi> upon a day
designed to these cruell pastimes. He told them by the
way, that though they haled his body with them, yet
should his eyes and soule bee free from these bloody
spectacles, <hi>cum talia aversaretur &amp; detestaretur,</hi> which
of himselfe he so detested. But thither he went and
tooke his place, and presently closed his eyes that he
might not see those dismall sights, which were before
him. When as the fight waxed hot, <hi>et omnia ferve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bant
immanissimis voluptatibus,</hi> and all were taken up
with those unmorcifull delights, upon a suddaine
<pb n="108" facs="tcp:4215:172"/>
shout, occasioned in the fight, he let loose his eyes
to see what it meant: <hi>Et percussus est graviori
vulnere in anima, quam ille in corpore; ceciditque
miserabilius, quam ille, quo cadente factus est
clamor.</hi> By meanes whereof, he became smitten with
a greater wound in his soule, than the poore fellow
in his body; and fell more miserably by farre, than he,
upon whose death the sayd noyse was raised. How
so, <hi>Vt enim vidit illum sanguinem, immanitatem simul

blood, he sucked in cruelty, and drew in the furies
of the place, being delighted with the wickednesse
the sport, and made drunke as it were with those
bloody spectacles.</q> Such <hi>plaies</hi> and <hi>shewes</hi> as these,
were not unlawfull to be seene on the <hi>Lords day</hi> onely,

enveigh with so much bitternesse: which as they were

he thought them not as lawfull to bee performed

prohibited at this time, to be presented on the <hi>Sunday,</hi>

                        <p>(5) A second thing which this Emperour did, in the
advancing of the <hi>Lords day,</hi> was in relation unto <hi>Civile,</hi>
and <hi>legall</hi> businesses. It was before appointed by the
Emperour <hi>Constantine,</hi> that <hi>Iudges</hi> should not set that
day, in the open <hi>Court,</hi> the Emperours <hi>Gratian, Valenti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nian</hi>
and <hi>Theodosius</hi> added thereunto,<note place="margin">Cod. l 2. de ser. lex. 2.</note> that none should

                           </gap>ame. And whereas, <hi>Valentinian, Theodosius,</hi> and <hi>Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cadius,</hi>
had privileged other dayes, as well as <hi>Sunday,</hi>
from the <hi>suites</hi> of <hi>Court,</hi> which dayes are formerly re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>membred
in their proper place: the Emperour <hi>Theodo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sius</hi>
the younger was pleased to adde the feast of <hi>Christs
Nativity,</hi> and so to the <hi>Epiphany,</hi> or <hi>twelfth-tide</hi> as wee
use to call it, together with seaven dayes before,
and seaven dayes after; <hi>[Diem natalis domini, &amp;
epiphaniae septem qui praecedunt, &amp; septem qui se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quuntur]</hi>
making this <hi>festivall</hi> with the <hi>rest</hi> before re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>membred,
in this case equall with the <hi>Sunday;</hi> where by
the way, we may observe of what antiquity the feast of
the <hi>Epiphany</hi> is to be accounted, as having got unto such
an height in this <hi>Emperours</hi> time, (he entred on the Em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pire
Anno 408) as to be priviledged in the selfe-same
manner, as <hi>Christmasse</hi> was. And not in this respect a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lone,
in respect of <hi>pleadings,</hi> but in a following law of his
Anno 4<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                              <desc>•</desc>
                           </gap>5 he declared his pleasure, that this day, with the
other principall <hi>feasts,</hi> as before we noted, was not to be
prophaned, as it had beene formerly, by the <hi>Cirques</hi> and
<hi>Theaters.</hi> For the antiquity thereof more might be sayd,
were not this sufficient. Onely I adde that in the <hi>Easterne</hi>
Churches from the times of old, they used to lengthen out
the feast of <hi>Christmasse</hi> for 12 <hi>dayes</hi> together; not ending
the solemnities of the same till the <hi>Epiphany</hi> was gone
over: from whence in likeli-hood, that custome came
at last, to these <hi>Westerne</hi> parts! <hi>Nativitatem domini

So <hi>Otho. Frisnigensis</hi> tells us of them. But to proceede,
it seemes that eyther these <hi>Edicts</hi> were not well obser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved;
or else the <hi>ministers</hi> of the <hi>Courts</hi> used to meete
together, for dispatch of businesse on that day, though
the <hi>Iudges</hi> did not. Therefore it seemed good to this

                        <p>(6) Nor stayed they here. The people of this sixt age
wherein now we are, began to <hi>Iudaeize</hi> a little; in the
imposing of so strict a rest upon this day: especially in
the <hi>Westerne</hi> Churches, which naturally are more incli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned
to <hi>superstition,</hi> then the <hi>Easterne</hi> nations. Wherein
they had so farre proceeded, that it was held at last un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lawfull
to travaile on the <hi>Lords day</hi> with <hi>waines</hi> or <hi>horses,</hi>
to <hi>dresse meate</hi> or make cleane the house or meddle with
any manner of <hi>domesticke</hi> businesses. The third Councell

plainely thereupon determined, that since these prohibi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions

the <hi>Iew</hi> than of the <hi>Christian; Die dominico quod ante licu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>it,
licere,</hi> that therefore whatsoever had formerly beene
lawfull on that day, should be lawfull still: Yet so that
it was thought convenient, that men should rest that day
from <hi>husbandry,</hi> and the <hi>vintage,</hi> from sowing, reaping,
hedging, and such servile workes; <hi>quo facilius ad ecclesi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>am

have better leisure to goe unto the <hi>Church</hi> and there say
their Prayers. This was the first restraint which hitherto
we have observed whereby the Husbandman was restrai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned
from the <hi>plough</hi> and <hi>vintage,</hi> or any worke that did
concerne him. And this was yeelded, as it seemes, to
give them some content at least, which aimed at greater
and more slavish prohibitions than those here allowed of;
and would not otherwise be satisfied then by grant of
this: Nay so farre had this superstition, or superstitious
conceit about this day, prevailied amongst the <hi>Gothes</hi>
in <hi>Spaine,</hi> a sad and melancholike people, that min<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gled
and married with the <hi>Iewes,</hi> who then therein
dwelt: that in their dotage on this day, they went be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore

<pb n="113" facs="tcp:4215:174"/>
rigorously observed by one as was the <hi>Lords day</hi> by the
other. The <hi>Romans,</hi> in this age had utterly defeated the
<hi>Vandals</hi> and their power in <hi>Africk:</hi> becomming so bad

The Armies neere together, and occasion faire, the <hi>Ro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mans</hi>

the sword: the <hi>Gothes,</hi> as formerly the <hi>Iewes,</hi> never so
much as laying hand upon their weapons, or doing any
thing at all in their owne defence; onely in reverence to
the day. The <hi>generall History</hi> of <hi>Spaine</hi> so relates the sto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry,
although more at large. A superstition of so suddaine
and so quicke a growth, that whereas till this present
age, we cannot finde that any manner of <hi>Husbandry</hi> or
country labours were forbidden as upon this day, it was
now thought unlawfull on the same to take a sword in
hand for ones owne defence. Better such <hi>doctrines</hi> had

onely thus infected where the <hi>Iewes</hi> now lived: the
<hi>French</hi> we see began to be so inclined. Not onely in
prohibiting things lawfull, which before we specified;
and to the course whereof the Councell held at <hi>Orleans</hi>
gave so wise a checke: but by imputing such calamities,
as had fallen amongst them, to the neglect or ill obser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vance
of this day. A flash of lightning or some other

that it should be observed more carefully for the

amongst us have endeavored to force upon the conscien<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces

snares of sinne. Let no man meddle in litigious contro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>versies,
or deale in actions or law-suites; or put him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selfe
at all upon such an exigent, that needes hee must
prepare his Oxen for their daily worke, but exercise
your selves in hymnes, and singing prayses unto God,
being intent thereon both in minde and body. If any
have a Church at hand, let him goe unto it, and there
powre forth his soule in teares and prayers; his eyes
and hands being all that day lifted up to God. It is
the everlasting day of rest, insinuated to us under the
shadow of the <hi>Seventh day</hi> or <hi>Sabbath,</hi> in the <hi>Law</hi> and
<hi>Prophets:</hi> and therefore it is very meete that wee
should celebrate this day with one accord, whereon
we have beene made what at first wee were not. Let
us then offer unto God our free and voluntary service,
by whose great goodnesse wee are freede from the
<hi>Gaole</hi> of errour: <hi>not that the Lord exacts it of us,
that we should celebrate this day in a corporall abstinence,
or rest from labour;</hi> who onely lookes that wee doe
yeeld obedience to his holy will, by which contem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning
earthly things, he may conduct us to the heavens
of his infinite mercy. However if any man shall set
at naught this our exhortation, be he assured, that God
shall punish him as he hath deserved; and that he shall
be also subject unto the <hi>censures</hi> of the <hi>Church.</hi> In case
he be a <hi>Lawyer</hi> he shall loose his cause; If that he be
an <hi>husbandman,</hi> or servant, he shall be corporally pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nished
for it: but if a <hi>Clergy man</hi> or <hi>Monke,</hi> he shall
bee six moneths separated from the Congregation.</q>
Adde here, that two yeares after this, being the second
yeare of the second <hi>Clotaire</hi> King of <hi>France,</hi> there was
a Synod holden at <hi>Auxxerre,</hi> a towne of <hi>Champaigne,
(concilium Antisiodorense</hi> in the Latin writers) wherein
it was decreed as in this of <hi>Mascon, Non licet die domi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nico
boves jungere, vel alia oper<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                                 <desc>•</desc>
                              </gap> exercare;</hi> that no man
<pb n="116" facs="tcp:4215:176"/>
should be suffered to yoake his Oxen, or doe any manner
of worke upon the <hi>Sunday.</hi> This is the <hi>Canon</hi> so much
urged, (I meane that of <hi>Mascon)</hi> to prove that wee must
spend the <hi>Lords day</hi> holily in religious exercises; and
that there is no part thereof, which is to be imployed un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to
other uses. But there are many things to be conside<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red,
before we yeeld unto this <hi>Canon,</hi> or the authority
thereof: some of them being of that nature that those
who most insist upon it, must be faine to traverse. For
first it was contrived of purpose with so great a strictnes,
to meete the better with those men, which so extreame<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
had neglected that sacred day. A sticke that bends
too much one way cannot bee brought to any straight<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse,
till it be bent as much the other. This Synod se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>condly,
was <hi>Provinciall</hi> onely, and therefore can oblige
none other, but those for whom it was intended: or
such who after did submit unto it, by taking it into their
<hi>Canon.</hi> Nor will some part thereof be approved by them,
who most stand upon it; none being bound hereby to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>paire
to <hi>Church,</hi> to magnifie the name of God in the Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gregation,
but such as have some <hi>Church</hi> at hand: and
what will then become of those that have a mile, two,
three, or more to their <hi>parish Churches,</hi> &amp; no <hi>Chappell</hi> nea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rer?
they are permitted by the <hi>Canon</hi> to abide at home.
As for <hi>religious duties</hi> here are none expressed, as proper
for the Congregation, but <hi>Psalmes</hi> and <hi>hymnes</hi> and sing<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
prayse unto the Lord, and powring forth our soules
unto him in <hi>teares</hi> and <hi>prayers:</hi> and then what shall wee
doe for <hi>preaching,</hi> for <hi>preaching</hi> of the Word which wee
so much call for. Besides, King <hi>Gunthram,</hi> on whose au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thority
this Counsell met, in his <hi>Confirmatory</hi> letters doth

should <hi>abstaine</hi> from every kind of <hi>bodily labour,</hi> save
<pb n="117" facs="tcp:4215:176"/>
what belong'd to dressing meate. But that which needes
must most afflict them; is that the councell doth professe,
this abstinence from <hi>bodily labour</hi> which is there decreed,
to be <hi>no ordinance of the Lords,</hi> that he <hi>exacteth no such du<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty
from us:</hi> and that it is an <hi>ecclesiasticall exhortation</hi>
onely and no more but so. And if no more but so, it were
too great an undertaking, to bring all nations of the
world to yeeld unto the prescript of a private and parti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cular
<hi>Canon,</hi> made onely for a private and particular
cause: and if no more but so, it concludes no <hi>Sabbath.</hi>
                        </p>
                        <p>(8) Yet notwithstanding these restraints from worke
and labour, the <hi>Church</hi> did never so resolve it, that any
worke was in it selfe unlawfull on the <hi>Lords day,</hi> though
to advance Gods publicke service, it was thought good,
that men should bee restrained from some kinde of
worke; that so they might the better attend their
prayers, and follow their devotions. Its true, these cen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turies,
the fifth and sixth, were fully bent, to give the
<hi>Lords day</hi> all fit honour: not onely in prohibiting <hi>un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lawfull
pleasures,</hi> but in commanding a forbearance of
some <hi>lawfull business<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                                 <desc>•</desc>
                              </gap>;</hi> such as they sound to yeeld most
hinderance to religious duties. Yea and some <hi>workes</hi> of
<hi>pietie</hi> they affixt unto it, for its greater honour. The <hi>Pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>soners</hi>
in the common Gaoles had formerly beene kept
in too strictly. It was commanded by <hi>Honorius</hi> and <hi>Theo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dosius</hi>
at that time Emperous Anno 412. that they should
be permitted <hi>omnibus diebus dominicis,</hi> every Lords day
to walke abroade; with a guard upon them: as well to
crave the charity of well disposed persons, as to repaire
unto the <hi>Bathes</hi> for the refreshing of their bodies. Nor
did he onely so command it, but set a mulct of 20 pound
in gold, on all such publicke ministers as should disobey:
the <hi>Bishops</hi> of the Church being trusted to see it done.
Where note, that going to the <hi>Bathes</hi> on the <hi>Lords day,</hi>
was not thought unlawfull; though it required, no que<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stion,
corporall labours; for had it beene so thought, as
some thought it afterwards; the <hi>Prelates</hi> of the Church
<pb n="118" facs="tcp:4215:177"/>
would not have taken it upon them, to see the Empe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rours
will fulfilled, and the law obeyed. A second ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour
affixt in these Ages to the <hi>Lords day,</hi> is that it was
conceived the most proper day for giving holy <hi>Orders,</hi>
in the Church of God: and a law made by <hi>Leo</hi> then Pope
of <hi>Rome,</hi> and generally since taken up in the <hi>Westerne</hi>
Church that they should bee conferred upon no day
else. There had beene some regard of <hi>Sunday</hi> in the
times before: and so much <hi>Leo</hi> doth acknowledge.

their strict devotions; and seemed not unwilling to

the service of the Church became more frequent,

met together: what is expected at their hands? That
they behave themselves there like the Saints of God, in

the Sacraments. These we have touched upon before, as
things that had beene alwayes used from the beginnings

As for the last, it seemed the people in those parts, used
to depart the Church, some of them, before the service
ended, and the blessing given: for otherwise there had
beene no <hi>Canon</hi> to command the contrary. <hi>Ex malis

of this ill custome did arise a law, made in a Synod held

upon the death of <hi>Sidonius Apollinaris,</hi> who dyed

to a solemne feast. Whatever might be sayd of
him, that made the invitation, no doubt but there
were many pious and religious men, that accepted
of it. Of recreations after dinner untill evening prayers;
and after evening prayer till the time of supper: there is
no question to be made but all were practised, which
were not prohibited, <hi>Nam quod non prohibetur, permissum
est,</hi> as <hi>Tertullian.</hi> Of this more annon.</p>
                        <p>(12) Thus have we brought the <hi>Lords day</hi> to the highest
pitch; the highest pitch that hitherto it had enjoyed, both
in relation unto <hi>rest</hi> from worldly businesse<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> and to
the full performance of <hi>religious duties.</hi> What ever was
done afterwards in pursuite hereof, consisted specially
in beating downe the <hi>opposition</hi> of the common people,
who were not easily induced to lay by their businesse:
next in a descant as it were on the fomer plaine-song;
the adding of particular restrictions, as occasion was
which were before conteined, though not plainely spe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cified,
both in the <hi>Edicts</hi> of the former <hi>Emperours,</hi> and
<hi>Constitutions</hi> of the <hi>Churches</hi> before remembred. Yet all
this while we finde not any one who did observe it as
<hi>Sabbath,</hi> or which taught others so to doe: not any, who
affirmed that <hi>any manner of worke</hi> was unlawfull on it,
further than as it was prohibited by the <hi>Prince,</hi> or <hi>Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>late;</hi>
that so the people might assemble with their greater
comfort: not any one, who preached or published, that
any pastime, sport, or recreation of an honest name, such
as were lawfull on the other dayes, were not fit for this.
And thereupon we may resolve, aswell of <hi>lawfull busi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse</hi>
as of <hi>lawfull pleasures:</hi> that such as have not beene
forbidden by supreme authority, whether in <hi>proclama<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions</hi>

are to be counted lawfull still. It matters not, in case
we finde it not recorded in particular termes, that wee

service. All that we are to looke for, is to see how farre
we are <hi>restrained</hi> from <hi>labour,</hi> or from <hi>recreations,</hi> on
the <hi>holy dayes;</hi> and what authority it is, that hath so re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>strained
us: that wee may come to know our dutie,
and conforme unto it. The <hi>Canons</hi> of particular Chur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ches
have no power to doe it, further then they have
beene admitted, into the <hi>Church</hi> wherein we live: for
then being made a part of her <hi>Canon</hi> also, they have
power to binde us to observance. As little power
there is to be allowed unto the <hi>declarations</hi> and <hi>Edicts</hi> of
particular <hi>Princes,</hi> but in their owne dominions onely,
Kings are Gods Deputies on the Earth, but in those
places onely, where the Lord hath set them; their po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wer
no greater than their empire: and though they
may command in their owne estates, yet is it <hi>extra sphae<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ram

they doe preach obedience, unto the publicke ordinan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces

should be lawfull, but what he allowed of: es<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pecially

by Saint <hi>Gregories</hi> doctrine, that in hot weather, one may
lawfully goe into the water, on the <hi>Lords day,</hi> and there
wade or swimme, either to wash or coole his body, as

with all reverence and devotion honour the <hi>Lords day,</hi>
beginning on the <hi>evening</hi> of the day before, at the first
<hi>ringing</hi> of the <hi>bell:</hi> and that they doe abstaine therein,
especially from all kinde of sinne, as also from all car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nall
acts, <hi>Etiam a proprijs conjugibus,</hi> even from the
company of their wives, and all earthly labours: and
that they goe unto the Church devoutly, laying a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>side
all suites of Law, that so they may in love and cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritie
praise Gods name together.</q> You may remember
that some such device as this, was fathered formerly on
Saint <hi>Austine;</hi> but with little reason. Such trimme con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceits,
<pb n="130" facs="tcp:4215:184"/>
as these, had not then beene thought of. And
though it be affirmed in the preamble to these <hi>constituti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons,
nec novas regulas instituimus, nec supervacuas rerum
adinventiones inhianter sectamur;</hi> that they did neither
make new rules, or follow vaine and needlesse fancies;
<hi>Sed sacris paternorum Canonum recensitis folijs, &amp;c.</hi> but
that they tooke example by the antient Canons: yet looke
who will, into all Canons of the Church for the times
before<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> and he shall find no such example. For my part, I
should rather thinke, that it was put into the <hi>Canon,</hi> in
succeeding times, by some misadventure: that some, ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>serving
a restraint, <hi>ab omni opere carnali,</hi> of all carnall
acts, might, as by way of question, write in the Margin,
<hi>etiam a proprijs conjugibus;</hi> from whence, by ignorance,
or negligence of the <hi>Collectours,</hi> it might be put into the
text. Yet if it were so passed at first, and if it chance that
any be so minded, (and some such there be) as to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive
the <hi>Canon</hi> to be pure and pious; and the intent
thereof not to be neglected: they are to be advertised,
that the <hi>holy dayes</hi> must be observed in the selfe same
manner. It was determined so, before, by the false Saint
<hi>Austine.</hi> And somewhat to this purpose saith this <hi>Synod</hi>
now, that all the <hi>greater festivalls</hi> must with all reve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rence
be observed and honoured; and that such <hi>holy dayes</hi>
as by the <hi>priests</hi> were <hi>bidden</hi> in the Congregation, <hi>Omni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bus
modis sunt custodienda,</hi> were by all wayes and meanes
to be kept amongst them; that is, by all those wayes and
means, which in the said <hi>Conon</hi> were before remembred.
In this the <hi>Christian</hi> plainely outwent the <hi>Iew;</hi> amongst

<pb n="132" facs="tcp:4215:185"/>
that now some had begun to thinke that the <hi>Lords day</hi>
was founded on the <hi>fourth Commandement;</hi> and all obser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vances
of the same, grounded upon the <hi>Law</hi> of God. As
long as it was taken onely for an <hi>Ecclesiasticall istitution,</hi>
and had no other ground upon which to stand, then the
authority of the <hi>Church;</hi> we finde not any of these rigours
annexed unto it. But being once conceived to have its
warrant from the Scripture, the Scripture presently was
ransacked, and whatsoever did concerne the old <hi>Iewish
Sabbath</hi> was applyed thereto. It had bin ordered former<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
that men should be restrained on the <hi>Lords day,</hi> from
some kind of labours, that so they might assemble in the

                           <hi>de tempore,</hi> hath resolved it so. And lastly, that wee
goe no further, the superstitious act of the good King
<hi>Olaus,</hi> burning his hand as formerly was related, was
then conceived to be a very just reveng upon himselfe, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause
he had offended, although unawars, <hi>contra divinum
praeceptum,</hi> against Gods Commandement. Nor were
these rigorous fancies left to the naked world, but they
had <hi>miracles</hi> to confirme them. It is reported by <hi>Vincen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tius</hi>
and <hi>Antoninus,</hi> that <hi>Anstregisilus,</hi> one that had pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bably
preached such doctrine, restored a <hi>Miller</hi> by his
power, whose hand had cleaved unto his Hatchet, as he
was mending of his Mill on the <hi>Lords day:</hi> for now you
must take notice that in the times in which they lived;
grinding had beene prohibited on the <hi>Lords day,</hi> by the
<hi>Canon Lawes.</hi> As also how <hi>Sulpitius</hi> had caused a poore
mans hand to wither, onely for <hi>cleaving wood</hi> on the
<hi>Lords day</hi> (no great crime assuredly, save that some pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rallell
must be found for him, that gathered stickes on the
former <hi>Sabbath;)</hi> and after of his speciall goodnesse, made
him whole againe. Of these the first was made Arch-Bishop
of <hi>Burges, Anno. 627. Sulpitius</hi> being successour
unto him in his <hi>See,</hi> and as it seemes too, in his power of
working miracles. Such <hi>miracles</hi> as these they who list
to credit, shall finde another of them in <hi>Gregorius Turo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nensis,
Miracul. l. 1. c.</hi> 6. And some wee shall hereafter
meete with when we come to <hi>England,</hi> forged purpose<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly,
as no doubt these were to countenance some new de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vise
about the keeping of this day; there being no <hi>new
Gospel</hi> preached, but must have <hi>miracles</hi> to attend it, for
the greater state.</p>
                        <p>(4) But howsoever it come to passe, that those foure
Princes, especially <hi>Leo,</hi> who was himselfe a Scholler,
and <hi>Charles</hi> the <hi>Great,</hi> who had as learned men about
him, as the times then bred, were thus perswaded of
this day; that all restraints from worke and labour on the
same, were to be found expresly in the word of God: yet
was the Church and the most learned men therein, of
<pb n="142" facs="tcp:4215:186"/>
another minde. Nor is it utterly impossible, but that those
Princes might make use of some pret<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

Scripture, the better to incline the people to yeeld obe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dience
unto those restraints which were layd upon them.
First for the <hi>Church,</hi> and men of speciall eminence in the
same, for place and learning, there is no question to bee

but that those Princes might make use of some pretence
or shew of <hi>Scripture,</hi> the better to incline the people,
to yeeld obedience unto those restraints which were layd
upon them. The Synod held at <hi>Mascon,</hi> and that in <hi>Aux<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>erre,</hi>

workes of <hi>husbandry</hi> on this day: the former having ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded

found enough to weane the people from their <hi>workes,</hi>
their ordinary labours used before, upon that day, and it is
no marvaile. The <hi>Iewes</hi> were hardly brought unto it,
though they had heard God thundring from the holy
mountaine, that they should <hi>doe no manner of worke upon
their Sabbath:</hi> It being added thereunto, that whosoever
should offend therein, he should <hi>dye the death.</hi> And cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainely
it was very long, before either Prince or Prelate,
or both joyned together, with all their power and policie
could prevaile upon them; either to lay aside their <hi>la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bours,</hi>

thereabouts; there had bin little reformation in this point

owne <hi>Regall edict,</hi> grounding himselfe <hi>secundù quod in lege

commands that all men doe absteine from the workes of

at that time prohibited, we will speake more thereof

all of which it was concluded against the <hi>Husbandman;</hi>
and many others more, as we shall see in the next Section.

it was to weane the people from their labours, and o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
civile businesse unto which they had beene accusto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med;
there being nothing to inforce or induce them to
it, but humane authority.</p>
                        <p>(6) On the same reason as it seemes, <hi>Leo Philosophus
Emp.</hi> of <hi>Constantinople</hi> did make use of Scripture: when in
conformity with the <hi>Westerne Churches,</hi> hee purposed to
restraine the workes of <hi>husbandry,</hi> on that day, which till
his time had beene permitted. The Emperour <hi>Constan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tine</hi>
had ordeined, as before was shewne that all Arti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficers,
and such as dwelt in Citties, should on the <hi>Sunday</hi>
leave their trades: but by the same Edict gave licence to
the <hi>husbandman</hi> to pursue his businesse, aswell upon that
day, as on any other. But contrary this <hi>Leo,</hi> surnamed
<hi>Philosophus</hi> (he began his reigne Anno 886, grounding
himselfe, for so he tells us, on the authority of the <hi>holy

that he tels us not) restrained the <hi>husbandman</hi> from his

to prohibited worke. For if the <hi>Iewes</hi> did so much
reverence their <hi>Sabbath</hi> which onely was a shadow of
ours; are not wee which inhabit light and the
truth of grace, obliged to honour that day which the
Lord hath honoured, and hath therein delivered us,
both from dishonour and from death? Are not wee
bound to keepe it singularly and inviolably, sufficient<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
contented with a liberall grant of all the rest; and
not encroaching on that one, which God hath chosen
for his service? Nay were it not a retchlesse sligh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting
and contempt of all religion, to make that day
common: and thinke that we may doe thereon, as we
doe on others.</q> So farre this Emperour determines of
it first, and disputes it afterwards, I onely note it for the
close, that it was neere 900 yeares from our Saviours
birth, if not quite so much, before restraint of husbandry
on this day, had beene first thought of in the <hi>East:</hi> and
probably being thus restrained, did finde no more obe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dience
there, then it had done before in the <hi>Westerne</hi>
parts.</p>
                        <p>(7) As great a difficulty did it prove to restraine other
things in these times projected, although they carried it
<pb n="141" facs="tcp:4215:189"/>
at the last, The Emperour <hi>Constantine</hi> had before com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manded,
that all <hi>Artificers</hi> in the Citties should surcease
from labour, on the <hi>Lords day;</hi> aswell as those whom he
imployed in his <hi>seates</hi> of <hi>justice:</hi> and questionlesse hee
found obedience answearable to his expectation. But
when the <hi>Westerne</hi> parts became a prey to new Kings and
Nations; and that those Kings and nations had admitted
the <hi>lawes</hi> of <hi>Christ:</hi> yet did they not conceive it necessa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry,
to submit themselves to the <hi>lawes</hi> of <hi>Constantine,</hi> and
therefore followed their imployments, as before they
did. And so it stood untill the time of <hi>Charles</hi> the <hi>Great</hi>
who in the yeare 789, published his regall Edict, in this
forme that followeth. <hi>Statuimus, secundum quod &amp; in

generall had beene before commanded by his father
<hi>Pepin,</hi> in the councell holden in <hi>Friuli</hi> but he now ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plicates
himselfe in these particulars. That is to say,
that neither men imploy themselves in workes of
<hi>husbandry,</hi> in dressing of their Vines, ploughing their
lands, making their hay, fencing their grounds, grub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bing
or felling trees, working in mines, building of
houses, planting their gardens, nor that they pleade
that day, or goe forth on hunting: and that it be not
lawfull for the women, to weave, or dresse cloath,
to make garments, or needle worke, to card their
wool, beate hempe, wash cloathes in publicke, or
sheere sheepe: but that they come unto the Church,
to divine service, and magnifie the Lord their God,
for those good things which on that day he hath done
for them.</q> After considering with himselfe that faires
and markets on this day, were an especiall meanes to
keepe men from Church; he set out his Imperiall Edict,
<hi>de nundinis non concedendis,</hi> as my author tells me. Nor did
he trust so farre, to his owne Edict, as not to strengthen
it, (as the times then were) by the <hi>authority</hi> of the

to another use; not in <hi>relation</hi> to the <hi>day,</hi> but their <hi>diso<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bedience.</hi>
Therefore the councell did advise that first of
all the <hi>Priests</hi> and <hi>Prelates,</hi> then that <hi>Kings, Princes,</hi> and
all <hi>faithfull people,</hi> would doe their best endeavour for the
restoring of that day to its auncient lustre; which had so
fowly beene neglected. Next they adressed themselves
particularly to <hi>Ludovicke</hi> and <hi>Lotharius</hi> then the <hi>Roman</hi>
Emperours, <hi>ut cunctis metum incutiant,</hi> that by some
sharpe injunction, they would strike a terrour into all
their subjects, that for the times to come none should
presume to <hi>plough,</hi> or hold <hi>Law-dayes,</hi> or <hi>Market,</hi> as of
late was used. This probably occasioned the sayd two

(8) Yet were not those <hi>restraints</hi> so strict, as that there
was no <hi>liberty</hi> to be allowed of, either for businesse or
pleasure! A time there was for both, and that time made
use of: there being in the <hi>Imperiall Edicts,</hi> and <hi>Consti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tutions</hi>
of the <hi>Church,</hi> yea and the <hi>decretalls</hi> of the <hi>Popes</hi>
many reservations, whereby the people might have <hi>li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>berty</hi>
to enjoy themselves: They had beene else in
worse condition, then the <hi>lewes</hi> before. In the Edict of
<hi>Charles</hi> the <hi>Great</hi> before remembred, though otherwise

carriages, allowed and licence on the <hi>Lords day: i. e.
Hortalia carra, vel victualia, vel si fortenecesse erit corpus

gardening ware, and Carts of victuals, and such as are to

1226.</hi> summoned by <hi>Stephen</hi> then Bishop there, on the
fourth <hi>Sunday</hi> in Lent, for the condemning of certaine
dangerous and erronious positions, at that time on foote.
I have the rather instanced in these particulars, partly be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause
they hapned about these times, when <hi>Prince</hi> and
<hi>Prelate</hi> were most intent in laying more and more re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>straints
upon their people, for the more honour of this
day<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> and partly because being all of them <hi>publicke actions,</hi>
and such as mooved not forwards but by divers wheeles;
they did require a greater number of people to attend
them. And howsoever Councells in themselves be of
an ecclesiasticall nature; and that the crowning of a King
in the act it selfe, be mixed of <hi>sacred</hi> and of <hi>

the traine and great attendance that belongs unto them,
the pompe the triumphes, and concourse of so many

they were, yet we may well perswade our selves, that
neyther <hi>Actor</hi> or <hi>Spectatour,</hi> thought themselves guilty<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
any wise of offering any the least wrong to the <hi>Lords
day:</hi> though those solemnities no question might with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out

                        <p>(10) For <hi>recreations</hi> in these times, there is no questi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
to bee made, but all were <hi>lawfull</hi> to bee used on the
<hi>Lords day,</hi> which were accounted lawfull upon other
dayes; and had not beene prohibited by <hi>authority:</hi> and
wee finde none prohibited but dancing onely. Not that
all kind of <hi>dancing</hi> was by Law restrained: but either
the <hi>abuse</hi> thereof at times unseasonable, when men
should have beene present in the Church of God; or
else immodest <hi>shamelesse dancings,</hi> such as were those,
against the which the Fathers did inveigh so sharply in the
primitive times. In reference to the first, <hi>Damascen</hi> tells
us of some men,<note place="margin">Parallellorum lib. 3. cap. 47.</note> who onely wished for the <hi>Lords day,
ut ab opere feriati vitiis operam dent,</hi> that being quitted
from their labours, they might enjoy the better their
<q>sinfull pleasures. For looke into the streets (saith he)
upon other dayes, and there is no man to bee found;
<hi>Die dominico egredere, atque alios cithara canentes, alios
applaudentes, &amp; saltantes, &amp;c.</hi> But looke abroad on the
<hi>Lords day,</hi> and you shall finde some <hi>singing</hi> to the
Harpe, others applauding of the Musicke; some <hi>dan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cing,</hi>
others jeering of their Neighbours, <hi>alios deni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>que

                           </q> they <hi>flie,</hi> as they had <hi>wings</hi> to

of <hi>musicke, dancing, publicke sports,</hi> or <hi>manlike exer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cises,</hi>
such as <hi>wrastling</hi> is on the <hi>Lords day;</hi> must certaine<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
have better eyes than <hi>Lynceus,</hi> and more with than
<hi>Oedipus.</hi> Plainely they prove the contrary to what some
alleage them: and shew most clearely, that the <hi>recreati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons</hi>
there remembred, were <hi>allowed</hi> of <hi>publickly;</hi> other<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wise
none durst use them, as wee see they did, in the <hi>open streets.</hi>
Onely the Father seemes offended, that they pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferred
their <hi>pastimes</hi> before their <hi>prayers;</hi> that they made
little or no haste to <hi>Church,</hi> and ranne upon the spurre to
their <hi>recreations:</hi> that where Gods <hi>publicke service</hi> was
to be first considered, in the <hi>Lords day,</hi> and after, on spare
times mens <hi>private pleasures;</hi> these had quite changed
the course of nature, &amp; loved the <hi>Lords day</hi> more for <hi>plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sure</hi>
than for <hi>devotion.</hi> This is the most that can be made,
from this place of <hi>Damascen;</hi> and this makes more for
<hi>dancing,</hi> and such <hi>recreations,</hi> then it doth against them, in
case they be not used at unfitting houres. Much of this
nature, is the <hi>Canon</hi> produced by some, to condemne
<hi>dancing</hi> on the <hi>Lords day,</hi> as unlawfull utterly: which be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
looked into, condemnes alone <hi>immodest</hi> and <hi>unseeme<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
dancings,</hi> such as no <hi>Canon</hi> could allow of upon <hi>any day</hi>
of what name soever. A <hi>Canon</hi> made by Pope <hi>Eugenius</hi>
in a Synod held at <hi>Rome, Anno</hi> 826. what time both
<hi>Prince</hi> and <hi>Prelates</hi> did agree together to raise the <hi>Lords
day</hi> to as high a pitch as they fairely might. Now in this
Synod, there were made three <hi>Canons</hi> which concerne
this day: the first prohibitive of <hi>businesse</hi> and the workes
of labour; the second against <hi>processe,</hi> in causes <hi>criminall;</hi>
the third, <hi>ne mulieres festis diehus vanis ludis vacent:</hi> that
women doe not give themselves on the <hi>holy dayes,</hi> unto
<pb n="150" facs="tcp:4215:194"/>
wanton sports: and is as followeth. <hi>Sunt quidam, &amp;

                              </gap>e are, but chiefly women, which on the <hi>holy dayes,</hi>
and <hi>Festivalls</hi> of the blessed <hi>Martyrs,</hi> upon the which
they ought to rest, have no great list to come to Church,
as they ought to doe: <hi>sed balando, &amp; turpia verba decan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tando,
&amp;c.</hi> but spend the time in <hi>dancing,</hi> and in <hi>shame<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lesse
songs,</hi> leading and holding out their <hi>dances</hi> as the
<hi>Pagans</hi> used, and in that manner, come to the Congre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gation.
These, if they come unto the <hi>Church,</hi> with
few sinnes about them, returne backe with more: and
therefore are to bee admonished by the <hi>parish Priest,</hi>
that they must onely come to <hi>Church</hi> to say their
<hi>prayers;</hi> such as doe otherwise, destroying not them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves
alone; but their neighbours also.</q> Now in this
<hi>Canon</hi> there are these three things to be considered: First
that these <hi>women</hi> used not to come unto the <hi>Church</hi> with
that sobriety and gravity which was fitting, as they ought
to doe; but <hi>dancing, singing, sporting,</hi> as the <hi>Pagans</hi> used,
when they repaired unto their <hi>Temples:</hi> secondly, that
these <hi>dancings</hi> were accompanied with <hi>immodest songs,</hi>
and therefore as unfit for <hi>any day,</hi> as they were for
<hi>Sunday:</hi> and thirdly, that these kind of <hi>dancings</hi>
were not prohibited on the <hi>Lords day</hi> onely, but on
all the <hi>holy dayes.</hi> Such also was the <hi>Canon</hi> of the
third Councell of <hi>Tolledo, Anno.</hi> 589.<note place="margin">Decret. pars. 3. de consectat. distinct. 3.</note> which after<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards became a part of the <hi>Canon Law;</hi> though by
the oversight of the <hi>Collector,</hi> it is there sayd to be the
fourth: and this will make as little to the purpose, as the
other did. It is this that followeth, <hi>Irreligiosa consuetudo

Now lest the feast of <hi>Whit sontide,</hi> might not have some re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>spect,

he left them three <hi>injunctions</hi> for their Christian carriage.
First that they eate no flesh on <hi>Fridayes:</hi> secondly, that
they rest the <hi>Lords day ab omni opere malo,</hi> from every e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vill

and thirdly <hi>Sanctorum solennitates cum vigiliis om<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ni

<hi>Saints dayes,</hi> with the <hi>Eves</hi> attendant. So that in all
these outward matters, we finde faire equality; save that
in one respect the <hi>principall festivals</hi> had prehemi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nence
above the <hi>Sunday:</hi> For whereas <hi>fishermen</hi> were
permitted by the <hi>Decretall</hi> of Pope <hi>Alexander</hi> the
third, as before was sayd, <hi>diebus dominicis &amp; aliis festis,</hi>
on the <hi>Lords day</hi> and other <hi>holy dayes,</hi> to fish for herring,
in some cases: there was a speciall exception of the grea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
festivals, <hi>praeterquam in majoribus anni solennitatibus,</hi>
as the order was. But not to deale in generals onely,
<hi>Isidore</hi> Arch-bishop of <hi>Sevill</hi> in the beginning of the se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venth
Century, making a Catalogue of the principall
festivalls, beginnes his list with <hi>Easter,</hi> and ends it with
the <hi>Lords day,</hi> as before we noted, in the fifth section of
this Chapter. Now lest it should be thought that in sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cred
matters and points of substance, the other <hi>holy dayes</hi>
were not as much regarded, as the <hi>Lords day</hi> was: the
Councell held at <hi>Mentz</hi> Anno 813 did appoint it thus,
that if the Bishop were infirme, or not at home, <hi>Non
desit tamen diebus dominicis, &amp; festivitatibus, qui verbum
dei praedicet juxta quod populus intelligat;</hi> yet there should
<pb n="154" facs="tcp:4215:196"/>
still be some to preach Gods word unto the people, accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding
unto their capacities, both on the <hi>Lords day,</hi> and the
<hi>other festivals.</hi> Indeed why should not both be observed
alike; the <hi>Saints dayes</hi> being dedicated unto God, as the
<hi>Lords day</hi> is; and standing both of them on the same <hi>autho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity:</hi>
on the <hi>authority</hi> of the <hi>Church,</hi> for the <hi>particular insti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tution;</hi>
on the <hi>authority</hi> of Gods <hi>Law,</hi> for the <hi>generall war<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rant.</hi>
It was <hi>commanded</hi> by the <hi>Lord,</hi> and written in the
heart of man by the penne of <hi>nature,</hi> that certaine times
should bee appointed for Gods <hi>publicke worship:</hi> the
choycing of the times, was left to the <hi>Churches</hi> power;
and she designed the <hi>Saints dayes,</hi> as shee did the <hi>Lords;</hi>
both his, and both alotted to his service onely. This
made Saint <hi>Bernard</hi> ground them all, the <hi>Lords day</hi> and

there were besides the <hi>Parish Priest</hi> who had

<hi>festivalls</hi> of the <hi>Saints,</hi> every <hi>Christian</hi> was to be intent
upon his devotions, to watch and pray, and goe to
Masse, and there make his offering. Its true the <hi>Service</hi> of
the <hi>Church</hi> being in the <hi>Latine;</hi> and in these times, that
language being in some <hi>Provinces</hi> quite worne out, and

                           </gap>dification as it should have done. As for the <hi>outward
adjuncts</hi> of Gods publicke service, on the <hi>Churches</hi> part,
the principall was that of <hi>Musicke</hi> which in these Ages
grew to a perfect height. We shewed before that <hi>vo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>call
musicke</hi> in the <hi>Church,</hi> is no lesse antient than the <hi>li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turgie</hi>
of the <hi>Church</hi> it selfe: which as it was begunne
in <hi>Ignatius</hi> time, after the manner of plaine-song, or a
melodious kinde of pronunciation; as before was sayd;
so in S. <hi>Austins</hi> time, it became so excellent, that it drew
many to the Church, and consequently many to the
faith. Now to that <hi>vocall musicke</hi> which was then in
use, and of which formerly we spake; it pleased the
<hi>Church,</hi> in the beginning of these Ages, to adde <hi>instru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mentall:</hi>
the organ being added to the voyce, by Pope
<hi>Vitalian,</hi> Anno 653; almost 1000 yeares agoe, and long
before the aberration of the <hi>Church</hi> from its pristine pie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty.
And certainely it was not done without good ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vise,
there being nothing of that kinde, more power<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full,
than melody both vocall and instrumentall, for
raising of mens hearts, and sweetning their affections
towards God. Not any thing, wherein the <hi>militant
Church</hi> here on <hi>Earth,</hi> hath more resemblance to the
<hi>Church</hi> in <hi>heaven triumphant;</hi> then in that sacred and
harmonious way of singing prayse, and <hi>Allelujahs</hi> to the
Lord our God; which is and hath of long beene used in
the Church of Christ.</p>
                        <p>(13) To bring this Chapter to an end, in all that hath
beene sayd touching the keeping of the <hi>Lords day,</hi> wee
finde not any thing like a <hi>Sabbath</hi> either in the practise
of the Church, or writings of particular men: however
these last Ages grew to such an height, in restraint of la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bours
on this day; that they might seeme to have a
minde, to revive that part of the fourth Commande<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment,
<hi>Thou shalt doe no manner of worke</hi> upon it. For
<pb n="157" facs="tcp:4215:197"/>
where they tell us of this day, as before was sayd, that
it was taken up by <hi>custome,</hi> on the <hi>authority</hi> of the
<hi>Church,</hi> at most on <hi>Apostolicall tradition;</hi> this makes it
plaine, that they intended no such matter as a <hi>Sabbath
day;</hi> though, that the <hi>Congregation</hi> might assemble in
the greater numbers, and men might joyne together in
all christian dueties, with the greater force; it pleased
the <hi>Church</hi> and principall powers thereof, to restraine
men from corporall labours, and binde them to repaire
to the house of God. Or if they did intend the <hi>Lords
day</hi> for a <hi>Sabbath day,</hi> its plaine they must have made
more <hi>Sabbaths</hi> than one day in seven: those <hi>holy dayes,</hi>
which universally were observed in the <hi>Christian
Church,</hi> being no otherwise to be kept than the <hi>Lords
day</hi> was; and those increasing in these Ages to so great
a number, that they became a <hi>burden</hi> to the common
people. Nor is it likely, that being once free from the
bondage of the <hi>Iewish Sabbath,</hi> they would submit
themselves unto another of their owne devising: and
doe therewith, as the <hi>Idolaters</hi> of old with their <hi>woodden
gods,</hi> first make them, and then presently fall downe and
worship them. Rather they tooke a course to restraine
the <hi>Iewes,</hi> from <hi>sanctifying</hi> their <hi>Sab<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

so onely: <hi>Sed ut diebus dominicis &amp; ab opere cessent,</hi> but
that they should refraine from labour on the <hi>Lords day</hi>
also. Of any <hi>Sabbath</hi> to be kept in the <hi>Christian Church,</hi>
some few might dreame perhaps, such filthy dreamers as
Saint <hi>Iude</hi> speakes of; but they did onely <hi>dreame</hi> thereof;
they saw no such matter. They which had better <hi>visions</hi>

Churches; counted a festivall day, or at lest no fast; and
honoured with the <hi>meetings</hi> of the Congregation. In re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ference
to the first we finde how it was charged on the

the learning of the world began to make
a different shew, from what it did: to
such a <hi>period</hi> of time, in which was made
the greatest alteration in the whole fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bricke
of the Church that ever any time
could speake of. The <hi>Schoolemen,</hi> who sprung up in the

which before was diffused and scattered into fine subtil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties,

along with us such passages of especiall note,
as hapned in the Christian world, by which wee
may learne any thing that concernes our businesse. And
first beginning with the <hi>Schoolemen,</hi> they tell us gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rally
of the <hi>Sabbath,</hi> that it was a Ceremony, and that
the fourth Commandement is of a different nature, from
the other nine: That whereas all the other precepts of the
<hi>Decalogue,</hi> are simply <hi>morall,</hi> the fourth which is the
third in their account, is partly <hi>morall,</hi> partly <hi>ceremoniall.

                           <hi>Morall</hi> it is in
this regard, that men must set apart some particular time,
for Gods publicke service: it being naturall to man to
destinate particular times to particular actions, as for his

much as that there is a day appointed in the Law it selfe,

make it, in referrence to the <hi>Allegory;</hi> out Saviours re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sting

fourth Commandement, that it is placed in the <hi>Deca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>logue,
in quantum est praeceptum morale, non in quantum est

In other of the festivalls which had not yet attained to
so great an height, the Councell thought not <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                              <desc>•</desc>
                           </gap>it perhaps
by reason of their numbers, that men should be restrai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned

to it, but left them to themselves, to bestow those
times, as might stand best with their affaires, and the
<pb n="168" facs="tcp:4215:204"/>
Common wealth. For so the Synod did determine,
<hi>Reliquis festivitatibus quae per annum Cunt, non esse ple<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bem
cogendam ad feriandum, sed nec prohibendam.</hi> And in
this state things stood a long time together, there being
none that proferd opposition, in reference to these re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>straints
from labour on the greater festivalls; though
some there were, that thought the festivalls too many, on
which those burden of restraints had unadvisedly beene
imposed on the common people. <hi>Nicholas de Clemangis,</hi>
complained much as of some other abuses in the Church,
so of the multitude of <hi>holy dayes,</hi>
                           <note place="margin">Ap. Hospin. cap. 4. de. fest. Christi.</note> which had of late
times beene brought into it. And <hi>Pet. de Aliaco</hi> Car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinall
of <hi>Cambray,</hi> in a discourse by him exhibited to
the Councell of <hi>Constance,</hi> made publick suite unto the
<hi>Fathers</hi> there assembled, that there might a stop in that
kind, hereafter: as also that excepting <hi>Sundayes</hi> and the
greater festivalls, <hi>liceret operari post auditum officium,</hi>
it might bee lawful for the people, after the end of
Divine Service, to attend their businesses: the poore e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>specially
having little time enough on the working
dayes, <hi>ad vite necessaria procuranda,</hi> to get their livings.
But these were onely the expressions of well-wishing
men. The Popes were otherwise resolved, and did not
onely keepe the <hi>holy dayes,</hi> which they found establish<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed,
in the same state in which they found them; but ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded
others daily, as they saw occasion. At last it came
unto that passe, by reason of that rigorous and exact
kind of rest, which by the Canon Law had beene fast<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned
on them, that both the <hi>Lords day</hi> and the other fe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stivalls
were accounted <hi>holy,</hi> not in relation to the use
made of them, or to the holy actions done on them, in
the honour of God: but in and of themselves considered,
they were avowed to bee <hi>vere alijs sanctiores,</hi> truely and
properly invested with a greater sanctity then the other
dayes.<note place="margin">Bellarm. de cultu S. l. 3. c. 10.</note> Yea so farre did they goe at last, that it is pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lickly

and the <hi>practise,</hi> till men began to looke into the
errors and abuses in the <hi>Roman</hi> Church, with a more se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rious
eye than before they did: and at first sight, they
found what little pleased them, in this particular.
Their doctrine pleased them not, in making one day ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lier
than another, not onely in relation to the use made
of them, but to a naturall and <hi>inherent holiness<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

was intended for the ease, of the labouring man.

for his part, hee thinke it requisite, that men should be

it but a part of the <hi>Iewish leaven; nimis scrupulose diebus

                           <hi>Bucer</hi> goes further yet, and doth not onely call
it a <hi>superstition,</hi> but an <hi>apostasie</hi> from Christ, to thinke
that working on the <hi>Lords day,</hi> in it selfe considered, is
a sinnefull thing. <hi>Si existimetur operari in eo die, per se,
esse peccatum, superstitio, &amp; gratiae Christi, qui ab ele<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mentis
mundi nos suo sanguine liberavit, negatio est:</hi> as
his owne words are. Then addes, that he did very
well approve of the <hi>Lords day</hi> meetings, <hi>si eximatur è
cordibus hominum opinio necessitatis,</hi> if men were once
dispossessed of these opinions, that the day was necessary
to be kept, that it was holier in it selfe then the other
dayes, and that to worke upon that day, in it selfe, was
sinnefull. Lastly, the Churches of the <hi>Switzers</hi> pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fesse
in their Confession, that in the keeping of the
<hi>Lords day,</hi> they give not the least hint to any <hi>Iewish</hi> su<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perstitions.
<hi>Neque enim alteram diem altera sanctiorem
esse credimns,<note place="margin">Cap. 24.</note> nec otium deo, per se, probari existimamus.</hi>
For neither, (as they sayd) doe we conceive one day to
be more holy than another; or thinke that rest from la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bour,
in it selfe considered, is any way pleasing unto
God. By which we plainely may perceive, what is the
judgement of <hi>Protestant Churches</hi> in the present point.</p>
                        <p>(6) Indeede it is not to be thought, that they could
otherwise resolve and determine of it: considering what
their doctrine is of the day it selfe: how different they
make it from a <hi>Sabbath day,</hi> which doctrine that wee
may perceive with the greater ease, we will consider it
<pb n="175" facs="tcp:4215:208"/>
in three propositions, in which most agree: 1. That the
<hi>keeping holy one day of seven, is not the Morall part of the
fourth Commandement, or to be reckoned as a part of the law
of <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                                 <desc>•</desc>
                              </gap>ature;</hi> 2. That the <hi>Lords day is not founded on Divine
Commandement, but onely on the authority of the Church,</hi>
and 3. That the <hi>Church hath still authority to change the
day, and to transferre it to some other.</hi> First for the first, it
seemes that some of <hi>Rome,</hi> considering the restraints be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
remembred, and the new doctrine thence arising,
about the <hi>naturall</hi> and <hi>inherent holinesse</hi> which one day
had above another; had altered what was formerly de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>livered
amongst the <hi>Schoolemen,</hi> and made the keeping
of <hi>one day,</hi> in <hi>seven</hi> to bee the <hi>Morall</hi> part of the fourth
Commandement. This <hi>Calvin</hi> chargeth them withall
that they had taught the people in the former times,<note place="margin">In stit. l. 2. cap. 8. 11. 34.</note> that
whatsoever was <hi>ceremoniall</hi> in the fourth Commande<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment,
which was the keeping of the <hi>Iewes seventh day,</hi>
had beene long since abrogated: <hi>remanere vero quod mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rale
est, nempe unius diei observationem in hebdomade,</hi> but
that the <hi>morall part</hi> thereof which was the keeping of
one day in seven, did continue still. With what else is
it, as before was sayd, then in dishonour of the <hi>Iewes,</hi>
to change the day; and to affixe as great a sanctity
thereunto, as the <hi>Iewes</hi> ever did. And for his owne
part he professeth, that howsoever he approved of the
<hi>Lords day</hi> meetings, <hi>Non tamen numerum septennarium
ita se morari, ut ejus servituti ecclesias astringeret;</hi> yet
stood not he so much for the number of <hi>seven,</hi> as to
confine the Church unto it. If <hi>Calvin</hi> elsewhere be of
another minde, and speake of keeping holy one day in
<hi>seven</hi> as a matter necessary; (which some say he doth)
either they must accuse him of much inconstancy and for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>getfulnesse;
or else interpret him,<note place="margin">In decalog,</note> with <hi>Ryvell,</hi> as speaking
of an <hi>ecclesiasticall custome,</hi> not to be neglected, <hi>non de ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cessitate

us by the law of God. Neither is he the onely one that
hath so determined. <hi>Simler</hi> hath sayd it more expressely.

Both which have also there determined, that in the choo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sing
of this day, the Church did exercise as well her <hi>wis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome,</hi>

As for the <hi>Lutheran</hi> Divines it; it is affirmed
by Doctour <hi>Bound, that <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 word">
                                 <desc>〈◊〉</desc>
                              </gap> the most part they ascribe too
much unto the liberty of the Church in appointing dayes for
the assembly of the people:</hi> which is plain confession. But
for particulars, <hi>Brentius,</hi> as Doctour <hi>Prideaux</hi> tells us,
calls it <hi>civilem institutionem,</hi> a civill institution, and no
<hi>commandement</hi> of the <hi>Gospell<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
                           </hi> which is no more indeed,
then what is elsewhere said by <hi>Calvin,</hi> when he accounts
no otherwise thereof, then, <hi>ut remedium retinendo ordini
necessarium,</hi> as a fit way to retaine order in the Church.
And sure I am <hi>Chemnitius</hi> tells us, that the <hi>Apostles</hi> did
not impose the keeping of this day, as <hi>necessary</hi> upon the
consciences of Gods people by any law or precept what<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>soever:
<hi>sed libera fuit observatio ordinis gratia,</hi> but that
for orders sake, it had been voluntarily used amongst
them, of their own accord.</p>
                        <p>(8) Thus have we proved that by the <hi>D<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

the <hi>Church.</hi> Which proved, the last of the three <hi>Theses,
<pb n="181" facs="tcp:4215:211"/>
that still the Church hath power to change the day, and to
transferre it to some other;</hi> will follow of it selfe, on the for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer
grounds: the <hi>Protestant Doctours</hi> before remembred,
in saying that the Church, did institute the <hi>Lords day,</hi> as
we see they doe; confessing tacitely, that still the Church
hath power to change it. Nor do they tacitely confesse it,
as if they were affraid to speak it out: but some of them
in plaine termes affirme it, as a certaine truth. <hi>Zuinglius,</hi>
the <hi>first reformer</hi> of the <hi>Switzers,</hi> hath resolved it so, in his
Discourse against one <hi>Valentine Gentilis,</hi> a new <hi>Arian</hi> he<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>retick.

that wee conceive it an impietie, it should be
changed unto another; on which as well as upon that,
we may not rest from labour, and harken to the Word
of God, if perhaps such necessity should be: this would
indeed make it become a ceremony.</q> Nothing can be
more plaine then this. Yet <hi>Calvin</hi> is as plain, when hee
professeth, that hee regarded not so much the number of
<hi>seven, ut ejus servituti Ecclesias astringeret,</hi> as to enthrall
the Church unto it. Sure I am, Doctour <hi>Prideaux</hi> recko<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neth
him, as one of them, who teach us that the Church
hath power to <hi>change</hi> the day, and to transfer it to some

since the <hi>Reformation,</hi> have gone further yet, and would
have had all dayes alike, as unto their use, all equally to
be regarded; and reckoned that the <hi>Lords day</hi> as the
Church continued it was a <hi>Iewish</hi> ordinance, thwarting
the doctrine of Saint <hi>Paul,</hi> who seemed to them to ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rogate
that difference of dayes, which the Church re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tained.
This was the fancie, or the frenzie rather of the
<hi>Anabaptist,</hi> taking the hint perhaps from something,
which had beene formerly delivered by some wiser men;
and after them, of the <hi>Swinckfeildian,</hi> and the <hi>Familist:</hi>
as in the times before, of the <hi>Petro-Brusians,</hi> and (if <hi>Wal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>densis</hi>
wrong him not) of <hi>Wiclef</hi> also.</p>
                        <p>(9) Such being the doctrine of those <hi>Churches,</hi> the
<hi>Protestant,</hi> and those of <hi>Rome,</hi> it is not to be thought but
that their <hi>practise</hi> is according: Both make the <hi>Lords day</hi>
onely an <hi>Ecclesiasticall constitution,</hi> and therefore keepe
it so farre forth, as by the <hi>Canons</hi> of their <hi>Churches,</hi> they
are enjoyned. These what they are at <hi>Rome,</hi> and those of
her obedience, we have seene already; and little hath
beene added since. It hath not beene, of late, a time, to
make new restraints; rather to mitigate the old, to lay
downe such which were most burdensome, and grievous
to be borne withall. And so it seemes they do, <hi>Azorius</hi>
the <hi>Iesuite</hi> being more remisse in stating and determining
the restraints, imposed on the <hi>Lords day,</hi> and the other
<hi>holy dayes;</hi> then <hi>Tostatus</hi> was, who lived in safer times by
farre, then these now present: nor is their <hi>discipline</hi> so
severe, as their <hi>Canon,</hi> neither. So that the <hi>Lords day</hi>
there, for ought I could observe, when I was amongst
them, is solemnized much after the same manner as with
us in <hi>England:</hi> repairing to the Church, both at <hi>Masse</hi>
and <hi>Vespers,</hi> ryding abroad to take the ayre, or otherwise
to refresh themselues, and following their honest plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sures
at such leasure times, as are not destinate to the pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>licke
<pb n="184" facs="tcp:4215:213"/>
meetings; the people not being barred from tra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>velling
about their lawfull businesse, as occasion is, so they
reserve some time for their devotions in the publicke.
Which is indeed agreeable to the most antient and most
laudable custome, in the Church of God. Now for the
<hi>Protestant Churches,</hi> the <hi>Lutherans</hi> do not differ much,
from that which we have said before of the <hi>Church</hi> of
<hi>Rome:</hi> and therefore there is nothing to be said of them.

about the <hi>Sabbath;</hi> but that the livelihood of the

any day, <hi>Sunday</hi> no more then any other, from venting
their commodities, and providing others. So that in ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nerall,
the <hi>Lords day</hi> is no otherwise observed with them
(though somewhat better then it was twelue yeares

we may perceive by their Divines, <hi>Calvin,</hi> and <hi>Beza,</hi>
and <hi>Martin Bucer</hi> who do so highly charge the <hi>Roma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nist,</hi>
for the restraint of working on the <hi>Lords day;</hi> that

On the <hi>Lords day</hi> after the end of Divine Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vice,
for any man to follow and pursue his labours; as

Ann. 1578. <hi>Vt Domini in suis ditionibus prohi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>beant

of the Church of <hi>Rome,</hi> under whom they live: then out
of any principle or example of those <hi>Churches,</hi> whom

they chiefly followed. For <hi>recreations</hi> last of all, there is

at that instant time, when men should be at Church to

Now that wee may the better see, how it hath beene

prove, by computation, that that erroneous observation,
came not in amongst the <hi>Brittans,</hi> till 30 yeeres before the

with them. But for the <hi>Brittans</hi> it is most certaine, that
they had longer beene accustomed to that observation:
though for the time thereof, whether it came in with the

that <hi>fishing</hi> on the <hi>Lords day</hi> was restrained by Law: yet sure

this <hi>Edgars</hi> death, the <hi>Danes</hi> so plagued this realme,
that there was nothing setled in it either in Church or state,
till finally they had wonne the Garland, and obteined the
Kingdome. The first of these, <hi>Canutus,</hi> an heroicke Prince;
of whom it is affirmed by <hi>Malmesbury, omnes leges ab an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiquis

them. These are the lawes which afterwards were called
King <hi>Edwards, non quòd ille statuerit, sed quòd observarit,</hi>
not because hee enacted them, but that he caused them to
bee kept. Of these more anon Besides which Lawes so
brought together, there were some others made at <hi>Winche<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ster</hi>
by this King <hi>Canutus:</hi>
                           <note place="margin">Leg. 14. 15.</note> and amongst others, this, that

in S. <hi>Edwards</hi> Lawes; which after were confirmed and ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tified

                        <p>(4) Now goe wee forwards to the <hi>Normans,</hi> and let us
see what care they tooke about the sanctifying of the <hi>Lords
day;</hi> whether they either tooke or meant it for a <hi>Sabbath.</hi>
And first beginning with the reigne of the first six Kings,
wee finde them times of action, and full of troubles, as it
doth use to bee in unsetled states: no Law recorded to bee
made touching the keeping of this day; but many actions
of great note to bee done upon it. These wee will ranke
for orders sake under these 5 heades: 1 <hi>Coronations, 2 Sy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nods
Ecclesiasticall, 3 Councells of Estate, 4 Civill</hi> busi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse,
and 5 <hi>battailes</hi> and assaults; which we shall summe
up briefely in their place and time. And first for <hi>Coronati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons,</hi>
which as before I said, are mixt kinde of actions, com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pound
of sacred and of civill; <hi>William,</hi> surnamed <hi>Rufus,</hi>
was crowned at <hi>Canterbury</hi> by Archbishop <hi>Lanfrancke,</hi> the
25 of Sept. being <hi>Sunday; anno</hi> 1087. So was King <hi>Steven,</hi>
the 21 of Decemb. being <hi>Sunday</hi> too, <hi>anno</hi> 1135. On <hi>Sun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>day</hi>
before <hi>Christmasse</hi> day was <hi>Henry</hi> the second crowned
at <hi>London,</hi> by Archbishop <hi>Theobald. anno</hi> 1155: and on
<pb n="219" facs="tcp:4215:224"/>
the <hi>Sunday</hi> before <hi>Septuagesima,</hi> his daughter <hi>Ioane</hi> was, at
<hi>Palermo,</hi> crowned Queene of <hi>Sicile.</hi> Of <hi>Richard</hi> the first
it is recorded, that hoysing saile from <hi>Barbeflet</hi> in <hi>Nor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mandie,</hi>
hee arrived safely here upon the <hi>Sunday,</hi> before our

of Knightly ranke; by whose advise and Counsaile he
was crowned on a <hi>Sunday,</hi> in September following, <hi>anno</hi>
1189: and after crowned a second time on his returne from

The royall &amp; magnificent forme of his first coronation, they

Duke of <hi>Normandie,</hi> by <hi>Walter</hi> Archbishop of <hi>Roane,</hi> the
<hi>Sunday</hi> after <hi>Easter day, anno</hi> 1200: and on a <hi>Sunday</hi> after
crowned King of <hi>England,</hi> together with <hi>Isabell</hi> his
Queene, by <hi>Hubert</hi> at that time Archbishop of <hi>Canterbury.</hi>
For <hi>Synods</hi> next, <hi>an.</hi> 1070 a Councell was assembled at <hi>Win<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chester,</hi>
by the appointement of King <hi>William</hi> the first, and
the consent of <hi>Alexander</hi> then Pope of <hi>Rome,</hi> for the de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>grading

the <hi>Sunday</hi> next after <hi>Easter.</hi> And wee finde mention of
a <hi>Synod</hi> called by <hi>Richard</hi> Archbishop of <hi>Canterbury. Anno</hi>
1175. the <hi>Sunday</hi> before <hi>holy thursday: ad quod concilium

where were assembled almost all the Bishops and

there was a solemne meeting called on <hi>Trinity Sunday, anno</hi>
1143, in which assembled <hi>Maud</hi> the Empresse, and all the
Lords which held her partie; where the Ambassadours from

that the Earle of <hi>Gloucester</hi> should bee sent thither

his brother <hi>David,</hi> with the Earles and Barons of that coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trey:
<hi>&amp; habito inde cum deliberatione concilio &amp;c.</hi> and then
and there upon mature deliberation, it was concluded, that
though the King accepted not the title, yet he would give
his people leave, to put themselves into the action, and take
up the <hi>Crosse.</hi> For <hi>civill</hi> businesse of another nature, we find
it on record that on the fourth <hi>Sunday</hi> in Lent, next follow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing,
the same King <hi>Henry</hi> Knighted his Sonne <hi>Iohn,</hi> and
sent him forthwith into <hi>Ireland:</hi> Knighthood at those times
being farre more full of ceremonie, then now it is. Which
being but a preparation to warre and military matters,
leades us unto such battailes, as in these times were fought
on <hi>Sunday.</hi> Of which wee finde it in our Annalls, that in
the yeere 1142. upon a <hi>Sunday</hi> being <hi>Candlemasse</hi> day, King
<hi>S<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

that on <hi>Holy-Crosse</hi> day next after, being <hi>Sunday</hi> too,
<hi>Robert</hi> Earle of <hi>Gloucester</hi> Commander of the adverse
forces, was taken prisoner at the battaille of <hi>Winchester.</hi>
So reade wee that on <hi>Sunday</hi> the 25 of August <hi>anno</hi> 1173.
the King of <hi>France</hi> besieged and forced the Castle of <hi>Dole</hi>
in <hi>Brittaine,</hi> belonging to the King of <hi>England:</hi> as also that
on <hi>Sunday</hi> the 26 of September <hi>anno</hi> 1198. King <hi>Richard</hi>
tooke the Castle of <hi>Curceles,</hi> from the King of <hi>France.</hi> More
of this kinde might bee remembred, were not these suffici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ent,
to shew how anciently it hath been the use of the Kings
of <hi>England,</hi> to create Knights, and hold their Councells of
estate, on the <hi>Lords day,</hi> as now they doe. Were not the
others here remembred, sufficient to let us know, that our
progenitours did not thinke so superstitiously of this day,
as not to come upon the same unto the crowning of their
Kings, or the publicke Synods of the Church; or if neede
were, and their occasions so required it, to fight as well or

out of an old booke entituled <hi>de Regibus An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gliae;</hi>
which, now I am fallen upon these fables, shall bee

                              <hi>King Henry the second,</hi> saith the story,
being at <hi>Cardiffe</hi> in <hi>Wales,</hi> and being to take horse, there
stood a certaine man by him having on him a white coate,
and being barefoote, who looked upon the King, and
spake in this wise. Good old King, <hi>Iohn Baptist</hi> and
<hi>Peter</hi> straightly charge you, that on the <hi>Sundaies</hi> through<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out
all your dominions, there bee no buying or selling
nor any other servile businesse, (those onely except
which appertaine to the preparation of meat and drinke:)
which thing if thou shalt observe, whatsoever thing thou
takest in hand, thou shalt happily finish. <hi>Adding withall,
<pb n="224" facs="tcp:4215:227"/>
that</hi> unlesse he did these things, and amend his life, hee
should heare such newes within the twelve moneth, as
would make him mourne till his dying day.</q> But to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clude,
what was the issue of all this, this terrible letter, and
forged miracles? That the historian tells us with no small
regreate,<note place="margin">Hou<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                                 <desc>•</desc>

whereby God did invite the people to observe this
day: <hi>populus plus timens regiam potestatem, quàm divinam,</hi>
the people fearing more the Kings power, then Gods, retur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned
unto their marketting, as before they did.</p>
                        <p>(7) I say that the historian tells it with no small re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>greate;
for in that passionate discontent he had said before,
that <hi>inimicus humani generis,</hi> the Divell enjoying the pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceedings
of this holy man so farre so possessed the King and
the Princes of darkenesse (so hee calls the Councell) that
they forthwith proceeded against them who had obeied
him. Which makes me thinke, that this <hi>Eustathius</hi> was a
familiar of the Popes, sent hither for the introducing of
those restraints, which had been formerly imposed on most
parts of <hi>Christendome;</hi> though here they found no enter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainement;
the Popes had found full well how ill their just<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lings
had succeeded hitherto with the Kings of <hi>England,</hi> of
the <hi>Norman</hi> race: and therefore had recourse to their won<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted
arts, by prodigies and miracles to insnare the people,
and bring them so unto their bent. And this I doe the ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
thinke, because that in the following yeere, <hi>Anno</hi>
1203, there was a <hi>Legate</hi> sent from <hi>Rome,</hi> to <hi>William</hi> King
of <hi>Scots,</hi> with severall presents, and many indulgences.

from the Councell held in <hi>Mentz, anno</hi> 813, If it
went no higher. For in a Catalogue there made of such prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cipall
feasts, as annually were to bee observed; they reckon
<hi>dedicationem templi,</hi> the consecration feast, or wake, as

                           <q>It is to bee understood, that
all manner of obligation of resting on the <hi>legall Sabbath,</hi>
as was required in the Old Testament, is utterly expired
with the other ceremonies. And it is now sufficient in
the New Testament, to attend Gods service upon the
<hi>Lords dayes,</hi> and the other <hi>holy dayes, ad hoc Ecclesiastica
authoritate deputatis,</hi> appointed by the Church to that
end and purpose. The manner of sanctifying all which
dayes, <hi>non est sumendus à superstitione Iudaica, sed à Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nonicis
institutis,</hi> is not to bee derived from any <hi>Iewish</hi>
superstition, but from the <hi>Canons</hi> of the Church.</q> This
was exact and plaine inough; and this was constantly the
doctrine of the Church of <hi>England. Iohannes de Burgo,</hi> who
lived about the end of K. <hi>Henry</hi> the sixt, doth allmost word
for word resolve it so, in his <hi>Pupilla oculi,</hi> part, 10. c. 11. D.</p>
                        <p>(10) Yet finde we not in these restraints, that <hi>Mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ketting</hi>
had beene forbidden, either on the <hi>Lords Day,</hi> or
the other <hi>holy dayes,</hi> and, indeed, it was not; that came
in afterwards by degrees, partly, by Statutes of the Realme,
partly, by Canons of the Church; not, till all Nations else
had long layd them downe. For in the 28. of King <hi>Edward</hi>

<hi>shewing of Wools shall be made at the Staple every day
of the wèeke, except the</hi> Sunday <hi>and the</hi> solemne Feasts <hi>in

<pb n="230" facs="tcp:4215:230"/>
might bee suffered, then certainely in themselves they were
not unlawfull on any other; further then as prohibited by
the higher powers. Now that which the Archbishop had
decreed throughout his Province, <hi>Catworth</hi> Lord Major of
<hi>London,</hi>
                           <note place="margin">Fabians Chro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nicle.</note> attempted to exceed within that cittie. For <hi>in this
yeere,</hi> saith <hi>Fabian, (anno</hi> 1444) <hi>an Act was made by au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thority
of the common Councell of</hi> London, <hi>that upon the</hi> Sun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>day
<hi>should no manner of thing within the franchise of the
Citty bee bought or sold, neither victuall, nor other thing:
nor none Artificer should bring his ware unto any man to be
worne, or occupyed, that day; as Taylers garments, and Cord<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wayners
shooes; and so likewise all other occupations.</hi> But
then it followeth in the story, <hi>the which ordinance held but

Afterwards in the yeere 1451, which was the 28 of
this <hi>Henries</hi> reigne, it pleased the King in Parliament, to
ratifie what before was ordered by that Archbishop; in this
forme that followeth. <hi>Considering the abominable iniu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries

sheweth plainely that the things before prohibited<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
were not esteemed unlawfull in themselves: as also that
this law was made, in confirmation of the former order of
the Arch-bishop, as before was said. Now on this law, I
finde two resolutions made, by my Lords the Iudges. First
Iustice <hi>Brian</hi> in the 12 of King <hi>Edward</hi> the fourth, decla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red,
that no sale made upon a <hi>Sunday,</hi> though in a <hi>fayre</hi> or

                           <hi>that the

either at the</hi> Assises, <hi>or generall Gaole delivery, or</hi> quarter
Sessions <hi>within that County.</hi> If so, in case such Lord may

as being contrary to the Statute: then by the same reason
may hee bee endited, for any <hi>fayre</hi> or <hi>market</hi> kept on any
of the other <hi>holy dayes,</hi> in that Statute mentioned.</p>
                        <p>(11) Nor staied it here. For in the 1465, which was

any</hi> shooes, huseans, <hi>or</hi> Galoches, <hi>upon paine of forfeiture

                        <p>(1) <seg rend="decorInit">T</seg>HVS are wee safely come to these
present times, the times of <hi>reforma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion,</hi>
wherein what ever had beene
taught or done in the former dayes,
was publickely brought unto the
<hi>test,</hi> and if not well approved of,
layed aside, either as unprofitable, or plainely hurt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full.
So dealt the <hi>Reformatours</hi> of the Church of <hi>Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land,</hi>
as with other things, with that which wee have
now in hand, the <hi>Lords day,</hi> and the other <hi>holy dayes:</hi> keep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
the dayes, as many of them as were thought conveni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ent
for the advancement of true godlinesse, and increase of
piety; but paring off those superstitious conceits and matters
of opinion, which had beene enterteined about them. But
first, before wee come to this, wee will by way of prepara<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion,
lay downe the iudgements of some men in the present
point; men of good quality in their times, and such as were
content to bee made a sacrifice, in the Common cause. Of
these I shall take notice of three particularly, according to
to the severall times in the which they lived. And first wee
will beginne with Master <hi>Fryth,</hi> who suffered in the yeere
1533 who in his <hi>declaration of Baptisme,</hi> thus declares
himselfe.<q>
                              <note place="margin">P. 96.</note> Our forefathers (saith hee) which were in the
beginning of the Church, did abrogate the <hi>Sabbath,</hi> to
<pb n="237" facs="tcp:4215:233"/>
the intent that men might have an ensample of <hi>Christian
liberty; &amp;c.</hi> Howbeit because it was <hi>necessary</hi> that <hi>a day</hi>
should be reserved in which the people should come to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether,
to heare the word of God, they ordayned insteed
of the <hi>Sabbath</hi> which was <hi>Saturday,</hi> the next day fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowing
which is <hi>Sunday.</hi> And although they might have
kept the <hi>Saturday</hi> with the <hi>Iew,</hi> as a thing indifferent;
yet they did much better.</q> Some three yeeres after him,
<hi>anno</hi> 1536 being the 28 of <hi>Henry</hi> the eight suffered Master
<hi>Tyndall,</hi> who in his answer to Sir <hi>Thomas More,</hi> hath re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>solved
it thus.<note place="margin">Pag. 287.</note> 
                           <q>As for the <hi>Sabbath</hi> we be <hi>Lords over the
Sabbath,</hi> and may yet <hi>change it into Munday,</hi> or into <hi>any
other day,</hi> as wee see neede; or may make every <hi>tenth
day holy day onely,</hi> If we see cause why. Neither was there
any cause <hi>to change it from the Saturday,</hi> but to put a diffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rence
betweene us and the <hi>Iewes;</hi> neither need wee any
<hi>holy day</hi> at all, if the people might bee taught without it.</q>
Last of all Bishop <hi>Hooper,</hi> sometimes Bishop of <hi>Gloucester,</hi>
who suffered in Queene <hi>Maries</hi> reigne, doth in a treatise
by him written on the <hi>ten Commandements,</hi> and printed in
the yeere 1550, goe the selfe same way.<note place="margin">Pag 103.</note> 
                           <q>Wee may not thinke (saith hee) that God gave any more <hi>holinesse</hi> to
the <hi>Sabbath,</hi> then to the <hi>other dayes.</hi> For if yee consider
<hi>Friday, Saturday,</hi> or <hi>Sunday,</hi> in as much as they be <hi>dayes,</hi>
and the worke of God, the one is no more <hi>
                                 <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                                    <desc>•</desc>
                                 </gap>oly</hi> then the
other: but that day is alwayes most <hi>holy,</hi> in the which we
most apply and give our selves unto holy works. To that
end did hee <hi>sanctify the Sabbath day,</hi> not that wee should
give our selves to illenesse, or such <hi>Ethnicall pastime</hi> as is
now used amongst <hi>Ethnicall people:</hi> but being free that
day from the travailles of this world, wee might consi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der
the works and benefits of God, with thankesgiving;
heare the word of God, honour him and feare him; then
to learne who, and where bee the poore of Christ, that
want our helpe.</q> Thus they: and they amongst them have
resolved on these foure conclusions. First, <hi>
                              <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                                 <desc>•</desc>
                              </gap>hat one day is no
more holy then another,</hi> the <hi>Sunday</hi> then the <hi>Saturday</hi> or the
<pb n="238" facs="tcp:4215:234"/>
                           <hi>Friday;</hi> further than they are set apart for holy uses. Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>condly,
<hi>that the Lords day hath no institution from divine
authority,</hi> but was ordained by our <hi>fore fathers</hi> in the be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginning
of the Church, that so the people might have a Day
to come together, and heare Gods Word: thirdly, <hi>that still
the Church hath power to change the day,</hi> from <hi>Sunday</hi> unto
<hi>Monday,</hi> or what day shee will. And lastly, <hi>that one day in
seven, is not the</hi> Morall part <hi>of the fourth Commandement:</hi>
for M. <hi>Tyndall</hi> faith expressely, that by the Church of God,
each <hi>tenth day onely</hi> may be kept <hi>holy,</hi> if wee see cause why.
So that the mervaile is the greater, that any man should
now affirme, as some men have done, that they are willing
to lay downe both their Lives and Livings, in maintenance
of those contrary Opinions, which in these latter dayes
have been taken up.</p>
                        <p>(2) Now that which was affirmed by them, in their par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticulars,
was not long afterwards made good by the gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rall
Bodie of this Church and State, the King, the Lords
Spirituall and Temporall, and all the Commons met in
Parliament,<note place="margin">5. &amp; 6. Edw. 6. cap. 3.</note> 
                           <hi>anno</hi> the fift and sixt of King <hi>Edward</hi> the sixt;
where, to the <hi>honour of Almighty God,</hi> it was thus enacted:
<hi>For as much as men bee not at all times so mindfull to
laud and praise God, so readie to resort to heare Gods
Holy Word, and to come to the holy Communion,</hi> &amp;c. <hi>as
their bounden dutie doth require: therefore, to call men
to remembrance of their dutie, and to helpe their infinni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie,
it hath beene wholesomely provided, that there should
be some</hi> certaine times and dayes appointed, <hi>wherein the</hi>
Christians <hi>should cease</hi> from all kind of labour, <hi>and apply
themselves only and wholly unto the aforesaid</hi> holy works,
<hi>properly pertaining to true Religion,</hi> &amp;c. <hi>Which workes
as they may well be called</hi> Gods Service, <hi>so the</hi> times <hi>espe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cially
appointed for the same, are called</hi> holy dayes: <hi>Not
for the</hi> matter <hi>or the</hi> nature <hi>either of the</hi> time <hi>or</hi> day, &amp;c.
<hi>for so all</hi> dayes and times <hi>are of like holinesse, but for the</hi>
nature and condition <hi>of such</hi> holy workes, &amp;c. <hi>whereunto
such</hi> times and dayes <hi>are sanctified and hallowed;</hi> that is
<pb n="239" facs="tcp:4215:234"/>
to say, <hi>separated from all</hi> prophane uses, <hi>and dedicated not
unto any Saint or Creature, but onely unto</hi> God, <hi>and his
true worship. Neither is it to bée thought that there is any</hi>
certaine time <hi>or</hi> definite number of dayes, <hi>prescribed in</hi>
holy Scripture; <hi>but the</hi> appointment <hi>both of the</hi> time <hi>and

many godly Prelates, was confirmed and authorized;
wherein, so much of the said Act, as doth concerne the
names and number of the <hi>holy dayes,</hi> is expressed, and as it
were incorporate into the same. Which makes it manifest,
that in the purpose of the Church, the <hi>Sunday</hi> was no other<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wise

                        </p>
                        <p>(3) This Statute, as before wee said, was made in <hi>anno</hi>
5. <hi>&amp;</hi> 6. of <hi>Edward</hi> the sixt. And in that very Parliament,
as before wee said, the <hi>Common Prayer-Booke</hi> was confir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med,
which still remaines in use amongst us: save, that
there was <hi>an alteration or addition of certaine Lessons to
be used on every</hi> Sunday <hi>of the yéere;</hi>

that had the altering and revising of it, that the Comman<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dements,
which were not in the former <hi>Liturgie,</hi> allowed

added, and accounted as a part of this; the people being

Law.</hi> Which being used accordingly, as well upon the hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring
of the fourth Commandement, as of any others; hath
given some men a colour to perswade themselves, that cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainely
it was the meaning of the Church, that wee should
keepe a <hi>Sabbath</hi> still, though the day be changed; and that
wee are obliged to doe it, by the fourth Commandement.
<pb n="241" facs="tcp:4215:235"/>
Assuredly, they who so conclude, conclude against the mea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning
of the Booke, and of them that made it. Against the
meaning of the Booke: for if the Booke had so intended,
that that ej<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                              <desc>•</desc>
                           </gap>culation was to be understood in a literall
sence, according as the words are layd downe <hi>in terminis;</hi>
it then must be the meaning of the Booke, that wee should
pray unto the Lord, to keepe the <hi>Sabbath</hi> of the <hi>Iewes,</hi> even
the <hi>seventh day</hi> precisely, from the Worlds Creation, and
keepe it in the selfe-same manner, as the <hi>Iewes</hi> once did;
which no man, I presume, will say was the meaning of it.
For, of the changing of the <hi>day,</hi> there is nothing said, nor
nothing intimated; but the whole Law laid downe <hi>in ter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minis,</hi>
as the Lord delivered it. Against the meaning also
of them that made it: for they that made the Booke, and
reviewed it afterwards, and caused these Passages and Pray<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers
to be added to it; <hi>Cranmer,</hi> Archbishop of <hi>Canterbury;
Ridley,</hi> Bishop of <hi>London;</hi> and certaine others of the Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lates,
then and there assembled; were the same men, by
whose advice and counsaile, the <hi>Act</hi> before remembred,
about keeping <hi>holy dayes,</hi> was in the selfe-same Parliament
drawne up, and perfected. And is it possible, wee should
conceive so ill of those reverend persons, as that they
would erect a <hi>Sabbath</hi> in the one <hi>Act,</hi> and beat it downe
so totally in the other: to tell us in the <hi>Service-Booke,</hi> that
wee are bound to keepe a <hi>Sabbath,</hi> and that the time and
day of Gods publike worship, is either pointed out in the
<hi>fourth Commandement,</hi> or otherwise ordained by <hi>D<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                                 <desc>•</desc>
                              </gap>vine
Authoritie;</hi> and in the selfe-same breath, to tell us, that
there is neither <hi>certaine time,</hi> nor <hi>definite number of dayes.</hi>
prescribed in Scripture, but all this left unto the <hi>libertie</hi> of
the <hi>Church?</hi> I say, as formerly I said, it is impossible wee
should thinke so ill of such Reverend persons: nor doe I
thinke, that any will so thinke hereafter, when they have
once considered the <hi>non sequitur</hi> of their owne Conclusi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons.
As for the <hi>Prayer</hi> there used, wee may thus expound
it, according to the <hi>doctrine</hi> and the <hi>practice</hi> both, of those
very times; <hi>viz<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
                           </hi> that their intent and meaning was, to

hearts to keepe that Law,</hi> as farre as it <hi>contained</hi> the <hi>Law</hi>
of <hi>Nature,</hi> and had beene <hi>entertained</hi> in the <hi>Christian
Church;</hi> as also to have mercie on them for the neglect
thereof, in those <hi>holy dayes,</hi> which by the <hi>wisdome</hi> and <hi>au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thoritie</hi>
of his <hi>Church,</hi> had beene set apart for Gods pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>like
Service. Besides, this Prayer was then conceived,
when there was no suspition, that any would make use
thereof, to introduce a <hi>
                              <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

                              </gap>ewish Sabbath;</hi> but when men ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
were inclined to the contrarie errour, to take away
those certaine and appointed times, <hi>Lords dayes,</hi> and other
<hi>holy dayes,</hi> which by the wisdome of the Church had beene
retained in the <hi>Reformation.</hi> The <hi>Anabaptists</hi> were strong<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
bent that way, as before wee shewed: and if wee looke
into the <hi>Articles</hi> of our Church,<note place="margin">S<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="2 letters">

speciall care was taken, to suppresse their errours in other
points, which had tooke footing, as it seemes, in this Church
and Kingdome. Therefore the more likely is it, that this
Clause was added, to crush their furious fancies in this par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticular,
of not hallowing certaine dayes and times to Gods
publike Service. Yet I conceive withall, that had those Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verend
Prelates fore-seene how much their pious purpose
would have beene abused, by wresting it to introduce a
<hi>Sabbath,</hi> which they never meant; they would have cast
their meaning in another mould.</p>

intent of holy Church, who in her <hi>publike Liturgie</hi> is as

designed for both, the same devout attendance requi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red

And therefore by this statute, and the Common
Prayer-Booke, wee are to keepe more <hi>Sabbaths</hi> then the
<hi>Lords day Sabbath,</hi> or else none at all.</p>
                        <p>(5) <hi>Next looke we on the</hi> Homilies, <hi>part of the publicke
monuments of the Church of</hi> England, <hi>set forth and au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thorized</hi>
an. 1562. <hi>being the fourth of that Queenes reigne.
In that entituled</hi> Of the place and time of prayer, <hi>wee shall
finde it thus.</hi> As concerning <hi>the time</hi> in which God hath
appointed his people to assemble together solemnly, it doth
appeare by the fourth <hi>Commandement &amp;c.</hi> And albe it this
<hi>Commandement</hi> of God doth not <hi>binde Christian people</hi>
so straitely to observe and keep the utter ceremonies of <hi>the
Sabbath day</hi> as it did the <hi>Iewes,</hi> as touching the forbearing
of worke and labour in the time of great necessity, and as
touching the precise keeping of the seventh day, after the
manner of the Iewes: (for wee keepe now the first day,
which is our Sunday, and make that our Sabbath, that
is, <hi>our day of rest,</hi> in honour of our Saviour Christ, who
as upon that day rose from death conquering the same most
triumphantly.) Yet notwithstanding whatsoever is
found in the <hi>Commandement</hi> apperteining to <hi>the law of
nature,</hi> as a thing most godly, most iust, and needfull for
the setting forth of Gods glory, ought to bee retained and
kept of all good <hi>Christian people.</hi> And therefore by this
<hi>Commandement</hi> we ought to have a time, <hi>as one day in
the weeke,</hi> wherein we ought to rest yea from our lawfull
and needfull works. For like as it appeareth by this <hi>Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mandement,</hi>
that no man in the six dayes ought to be sloth<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full
and idle, but diligently to labour in that state wherein
God hath set him, even so God hath given expresse charge
to all men, that upon the <hi>Sabbath day,</hi> which is now our
<hi>Sunday,</hi> they should cease from all weekely and workeday
labour: to the intent that like as God himselfe wrought
six dayes and rested the seaventh, and blessed and sanctified
it, and consecrated it to quietnesse and rest from labour;
<pb n="245" facs="tcp:4215:237"/>
evenso Gods obedient people should use <hi>the Sunday</hi> holily,
&amp; rest from their <hi>Common and daily businesse,</hi> and also give
themselves <hi>wholy</hi> to heavenly exercises of Gods true reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gion
and service. So that God doth not onely command
the observation of this <hi>holy day;</hi> but also by his owne ex<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ample
doth stirre and provoke us to the diligent keeping
of the same, &amp;c. Thus it may plainely appeare that Gods
will and Commandement was to have a solemne time
and standing day <hi>in the weeke,</hi> where in the people should
come together, and have in remembrance his wonderfull
benefits, and to render him thankes for them, as apper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teineth
to loving, kinde, and obedient people. This ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ample
<hi>and Commandement</hi> of God, <hi>the godly Christian
people beganne to follow</hi> immediatly <hi>after the Ascension
of our Lord Christ, and</hi> beganne to choose them <hi>a standing
day of the weeke to</hi> come together in: yet not the <hi>seaventh
day,</hi> which the <hi>Iewes</hi> kept, but the <hi>Lords day,</hi> the day of the
Lords resurrection the day after the seaventh day, which
is the <hi>first day of the weeke, &amp;c.</hi> Sithence which time,
Gods people hath alwayes in all Ages, without any gain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>saying<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
used to come together on the <hi>Sunday,</hi> to celebrate
and honour the Lords blessed Name, and carefully to keep
that day in holy rest and quietnesse, both man, and woman,
childe, servant and stranger. <hi>So farre the</hi> Homilie: <hi>and this
is all thereof which is</hi> doctrinall. <hi>The residue consists in re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prehension
of two sorts of men: one of the which,</hi> if they had
any businesse to doe, though <hi>there were no extreme neede,</hi>
would not spare <hi>the Sunday,</hi> but used all dayes alike, <hi>the
holy dayes and worke-dayes</hi> all as one; <hi>the other so consu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med
the day</hi> in gluttony and drunkennesse, and such fleshly
filthinesse, <hi>that as it is there said,</hi> the Lord was more dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>honoured
and the Devill better served <hi>on the Sunday,</hi> then
upon all the dayes in the weeke besides.</p>
                        <p>(6) This saith the <hi>Homily,</hi> and this hath often beene
alleaged, as well to prove a <hi>Lords day Sabbath,</hi> to bee al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowed
of by the doctrine of the Church of <hi>England;</hi> as at
this present time, to iustifie the disobedience of those men,
<pb n="244" facs="tcp:4215:238"/>
who have refused to publish the Princes pleasure, in point
of <hi>recreations.</hi> But this if well examined, will as little helpe
them; as <hi>Lord have mercy upon us,</hi> in the <hi>Common Prayer
booke.</hi> For first it is here said, that there is no more of the
fourth Commandement to bee retained and kept of good
Christian people, then <hi>whatsoeuer is found in it appertaining
to the law of Nature.</hi> But wee have proved before, that
there is nothing in the fourth Commandement of the <hi>law</hi>
of <hi>Nature,</hi> but that some time be set apart for Gods publick
service: the precept, so farre forth, as it enjoynes <hi>one day
in seaven,</hi> or the seaventh day precisely from the worlds
creation, being avowed for <hi>ceremoniall</hi> by all kinde of wri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters.
Secondly it is said, not that the <hi>Lords day</hi> was enjoy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned
by <hi>Divine authority,</hi> either by <hi>Christ</hi> himselfe, or his
<hi>Apostles;</hi> but <hi>chosen</hi> for a standing day to come together in,
by <hi>godly Christian people,</hi> immediately <hi>after the Ascension</hi>
of our Lord Christ: If <hi>chose</hi> by them, then not enjoyned by
the <hi>Apostles:</hi> if not till <hi>after the Ascension</hi> of our Saviour
Christ, then not at all by him <hi>commanded.</hi> Thirdly, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>as
they chose themselves a <hi>standing day</hi> in the weeke to
come together in, they did not this by any <hi>obligation</hi> layed
upon them by the fourth <hi>Commandement,</hi> but onely by a vo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>luntary
following of Gods <hi>example,</hi> and the <hi>analogie</hi> or

that <hi>this example and commandement of God, the godly Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stian
people beganne to follow after Christs ascension:</hi> so that
it seemes they might have chosen, whether they would have
followed them, or not. Fourthly, when they had chose this
day, which wee now observe, for their publicke meetings,
they did not thinke themselves obliged by the fourth Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mandement,
to <hi>forbeare worke and labour in time of great
necessity,</hi> or to the <hi>precife keeping</hi> of the same, <hi>after the man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner</hi>
of the <hi>Iewes:</hi> both which they must have done, had they
<pb n="245" facs="tcp:4215:238"/>
conceived the keeping of one day in seaven, to be the <hi>morall</hi>

us. Now whereas some have drawne from hence these two
Conclusions. First, that according to this <hi>Homilie,</hi> we ought
to <hi>keepe one day in <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                                 <desc>•</desc>

                              </gap>ment;</hi> and
secondly, <hi>that we must spend it wholy in religious exercises:</hi> I
would faine know how those conclusions can be raised from
the former premisses. It's true, the <hi>Homilie</hi> hath told us that
by the fourth <hi>Commandment</hi> we ought to have a time, <hi>as one
day in the weeke,</hi> wherein wee ought to rest from our need<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full
works. Where note, that there it is not said, that by
the fourth <hi>Commandement</hi> wee ought to have <hi>one day in the
weeke,</hi> which is plaine and peremtory; but that wee ought
to have a time, <hi>as one day in the weeke,</hi> which was plainely
arbitrary. A <hi>time</hi> wee ought to have by the fourth <hi>Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mandement,</hi>
as being that part of <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 word">
                              <desc>〈◊〉</desc>
                           </gap> which perteines to the
<hi>law</hi> of <hi>Nature:</hi> but for the next words <hi>as one day in the
weeke,</hi> they are not there layd downe, as imposed on us by
the law; but onely instanced in, as setled at that time in the
Church of God. So where it is affirmed in another place,
that Gods will and commandement <hi>was</hi> to have a <hi>solemne
time</hi> and <hi>standing day in the weeke;</hi> wee grant indeed that
so it <hi>was:</hi> and that the <hi>Godly Christian people</hi> in the Primi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tive
times, were easily induced to give God no lesse, then
what hee formerly commanded. But had the meaning of
the <hi>Homilie</hi> beene this, that wee were bound to have a
<hi>standing day in the weeke,</hi> by the fourth Commandement;
they would have plainely said, <hi>it is Gods will and pleasure
that it should bee so,</hi> and not have told us what it <hi>was,</hi> in
the times before. Its true, the <hi>Homilie</hi> hath told us, that
wee should rest our selves, on <hi>Sunday,</hi> from our common
businesse, <hi>and also give our selves</hi> wholie to <hi>heavenly exer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cises
of Gods true religion and service.</hi> Where note, it is
not said, that wee should spend the day <hi>wholly</hi> in heavenly
exercises; for then there were no time allowed us to eate
and drinke, which are meere naturall employments: but
<pb n="248" facs="tcp:4215:239"/>
that wee give <hi>our selves wholly,</hi> that is our <hi>whole selves</hi> bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy
and soule, to that performance of those heavenly exer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cises,
which are required of us in the way of true religion,
and Gods publike service. It is accounted, as wee have for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>merly

is expressely said in the Act of Parliament about keeping

the other <hi>holy dayes,</hi> as the <hi>Sunday, Christians should cease

those parts thereof especially which tend to the correction

to those times, wherein they were first published. If
in those times, men made no difference between the <hi>working

<hi>Sunday,</hi> as well as on the <hi>other dayes,</hi> when <hi>there was no
such need</hi> but that they might have tarryed longer: they
were the more to blame, no doubt, in trespassing so wilful<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
against the <hi>Canons</hi> of the <hi>Church,</hi> &amp; <hi>Acts</hi> of <hi>Parliament,</hi>
which had restrained many of the things there specified:
The <hi>Homilie</hi> did well to reprove them for it. If on the o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
side, they spent the day <hi>in ungodlinesse</hi> and <hi>filthinesse,</hi>
in <hi>gluttony</hi> and <hi>drunkennesse,</hi> and such like other crying
sinnes, as are there particularly noted: the <hi>Prelates</hi> of the
Church had very ill discharged their duetie, had they not
tooke some course to have told them of it. But what is that
to us, who doe not spend the <hi>Lords day</hi> in such <hi>filthy steshli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse,</hi>
(what ever one malicious <hi>Sycophant</hi> hath affirmed
therein): or what is that to <hi>dancing, shooting, leaping,

ungodlie and filthie Acts as are therein mentioned.</p>
                        <p>(7) Thus upon due search made, and full examination
of all parties, we finde no <hi>Lords day Sabbath</hi> in the booke
of <hi>Homilies:</hi> no nor in any writings of particular men, in
more then 33 yeeres after the <hi>Homilies</hi> were published. I
find indeed that in the yeere 1580 the Magistrates of the
Cittie of <hi>London</hi> obtained from Queene <hi>Elizabeth,</hi> that
playes and enterludes should no more bee acted on the
<hi>Sabbath day,</hi> within the liberties of their Cittie. As also
that in 83. on the 14 of Ianuary being <hi>Sunday,</hi> many were
hurt, and eight killed outright by the suddaine falling of the
Scaffolds in <hi>Paris-garden.</hi> This shewes that <hi>Enterludes</hi> and
<hi>Beare-baitings</hi> were then permitted on the <hi>Sunday,</hi> and so

they were a long time after, though not within the Cittie
of <hi>London:</hi> which certainely had not beene suffered, had
it beene then conceived that <hi>Sunday</hi> was to bee accounted
for a <hi>Sabbath.</hi> But in the yeere 1595, some of that faction
which before had laboured with small profit, to overthrow
the <hi>Hierarchy</hi> and government of this Church of <hi>England;</hi>
now set themselves on worke to ruinate all the orders of it:

the <hi>wisdome</hi> and <hi>authority</hi> of the Church, had beene ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pointed
for Gods service, and in the steed thereof to erect
a <hi>Sabbath,</hi> of their owne devising. These <hi>Sabbath specula<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions,</hi>
and presbyterian directions, as mine Authour calls
them, they had beene hammering more then ten yeeres
before; though they produced them not till now: and in
producing of them now, they introduced, saith hee, <hi>a
more then either</hi> Iewish <hi>or</hi> Popish <hi>superstition into the Land,</hi>

of the true servants of God, and therewith doctrine most er<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>roneous,
dangerous, and Antichristian.</hi> Of these, the
principall was one Doctor <hi>Bound,</hi> who published first his
<hi>Sabbath Doctrines Anno 1595,</hi> and after with additions
to it and enlargements of it, <hi>Anno</hi> 1606. Wherein he hath
affirmed in generall over all the booke, that the Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mandement
of <hi>sanctifying every seaventh day, as in</hi> the Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>saicall
decalogue, <hi>is</hi> naturall, morall, and perpetuall: <hi>that
where all other things in the</hi> Iewish Church <hi>were so</hi> chan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ged,
<hi>that they were cleane taken away, as the Priesthood,
the sacrifices, and the Sacraments; this day,</hi> the Sabbath,
<hi>was so cha<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ged,</hi> that it still remaineth. p. 91: <hi>that there is great
reason why we</hi> Christians <hi>should take our selves as</hi> straitly
bound <hi>to rest upon</hi> the Lords day, <hi>as the</hi> Iewes <hi>were upo<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> their</hi>

us, as well as them, being all of</hi> equall authority. p. 247.
And for the <hi>Rest</hi> upon this <hi>Day,</hi> that it must be a <hi>notable</hi>
and <hi>singular Rest,</hi> a <hi>most carefull, exact,</hi> and <hi>precise Rest,</hi>
after another manner than men were accustomed, <hi>p.</hi> 124.

to speake or talke of <hi>Pleasures, p.</hi> 272. or any other world<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
matter, 275. Most Magisterially determined; indeed,
more like a <hi>Iewish Rabbin,</hi> than a <hi>Christian Doctor.</hi> Yet
<hi>Iewish</hi> and <hi>Rabbinicall</hi> though his Doctrine were, it car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ried
a faire face and shew of Pietie, at the least in the opi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion
of the common people; and such, who stood not to
examine the true grounds thereof, but tooke it up, on the
appearance; such, who did judge thereof, not by the work<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manship
of the Stuffe, but the glosse and colour. In which,
it is most strange to see, how suddainly men were induced
not onely to give way unto it, but without more adoe, to
abett the same; till in the end, and that in very little time,
it grew the most bewitching Errour, the most popular De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceit,
that ever had beene set on foot in the Church of <hi>Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land.</hi>
And verily I perswade my selfe, that many an honest
and well-meaning man, both of the <hi>Clergie</hi> and the <hi>Laitie,</hi>
either because of the appearance of the thing it selfe, or
out of some opinion of those men, who first endevoured to
promote it; became exceedingly affected towards the
same, as taking it to be a Doctrine sent downe from Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven,
for encrease of Pietie: So easily did they beleeve it,

and grew at last so strongly possessed therewith, that in the
end they would not willingly be perswaded to conceive
otherwise thereof, than at first they did; or thinke they
swallowed downe the Hooke, when they tooke the Bait.
An Hooke indeed, which had so fastned them to those men,
who love to fish in troubled waters; that by this artifice,
there was no small hope conceived amongst them, to for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tifie
their side, and make good that cause, which till this
trimme Deceit was thought of, was almost growne despe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rate.
Once, I am sure, that by this meanes, the <hi>Brethren,</hi>
who before endeavoured to bring all Christian Kings and
Princes under the yoke of their <hi>Presbyteries;</hi> made little
doubt to bring them under the command of their <hi>Sabbath
Doctrines.</hi> And though they failed of that applauded
paritie, which they so much aimed at, in the advancing of
their <hi>Elderships;</hi> yet hoped they, without more adoe, to
bring all <hi>higher Powers,</hi> what ever, into an equall ranke
with the <hi>common people,</hi> in the observance of their <hi>Iewish
Sabbatarian</hi> rigours. So Doctor <hi>Bound</hi> declares himselfe,
<hi>p.</hi> 171. <q>The <hi>Magistrate,</hi> saith hee, and <hi>Governour</hi> in
authoritie, <hi>how high soever,</hi> cannot take any priviledge
to himselfe, whereby he might be occupied about world<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
businesse, when other men should rest from labour.</q>
It seemes, they hoped to see the greatest Kings and Princes
make suit unto their <hi>Consistorie</hi> for a Dispensation, as often
as the great Affaires of State, or what cause soever, induced
them otherwise to spend that <hi>Day,</hi> or any part or parcell of
it, than by the new <hi>Sabbath Doctrine</hi> had beene permitted.
For the endeering of the which, as formerly to endeere
their <hi>Elderships,</hi> they spared no place, or Text of Scripture,
where the word <hi>Elder</hi> did occurre; and without going to
the <hi>Heralds,</hi> had framed a Pedigree thereof, from <hi>

from <hi>Noahs</hi> Arke, and from <hi>Adam</hi> finally: so did these
men proceed in their new Devices, publishing out of holy
Writ, both the antiquitie and authoritie of their <hi>Sabbath</hi>
day: No passage of Gods Booke unransacked, where there
was mention of a <hi>Sabbath,</hi> whether the <hi>legall Sabbath,</hi> char<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ged

the <hi>Iewes,</hi> or the <hi>spirituall Sabbath</hi> of the Soule, from

                              <desc>•</desc>
                           </gap>ne, which was not fitted and applyed to the present pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pose:
though, if examined, as it ought, with no better rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son,
than <hi>Paveant illi, &amp; non paveam ego,</hi> was by an ignorant
Priest alledged from Scripture, to prove that his Parishio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ners
ought to <hi>pave</hi> the Chancell. Yet, upon confidence of
these proofes, they did alreadie begin to sing <hi>Victoria;</hi>
especially, by reason of the entertainment which the said
Doctrines found with the common people. For, thus the
Doctor boasts himselfe, in his second Edition, <hi>anno</hi> 606. as
before was said, <hi>Many godly learned both in their Preach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings,
Writings, and Disputations, did concurre with him in
that argument;</hi> and, <hi>that the lives of many Christians, in
many places of the Kingdome, were framed according to his
Doctrine, p.</hi> 61. Particularly, in the Epistle to the Reader,
that <hi>within few yeeres, three severall profitable Treatises
successively were written, by three godly learned Preachers,
[Greenehams</hi> was one, whose ever were the other two:] <hi>that
in the</hi> mouth of two or three witnesses, the <hi>doctrine of the</hi>
Sabbath <hi>might bee established. Egregiam verò laudem, &amp;
spolia ampla!</hi>
                        </p>
                        <p>(8) But whatsoever cause hee had thus to boast him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selfe,
in the successe of his <hi>new</hi> doctrines; the Church, I am
sure, had little cause to rejoyce thereat. For what did fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low
hereupon but such monstrous paradoxes, and those de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>livered

                           <hi>holy dayes</hi> in this Church established were so shrewdly
shaken, that till this day they are not well recovered of the
blow then given. Nor came this on the by, or besides their
purpose; but as a thing that specially was intended from
the first beginning; from the first time that ever these
<hi>Sabbath</hi> doctrines peeped into the light. For Doctor
<hi>Bound,</hi> the first sworne servant of the <hi>Sabbath,</hi> hath in his
first edition thus declared himselfe,<note place="margin">P. 31.</note> that hee <hi>sees not where
the Lord hath given any authority to his Church, ordinarily
and perpetually to sanctifie any day, except that which hee
hath sanctified himselfe:</hi> and makes it an especiall ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gument
against the goodnesse of the religion in the
Church of <hi>Rome,</hi>
                           <note place="margin">P. 32.</note> that to the <hi>seventh day</hi> they have ioyned
so many other dayes, and made them equall with the
seventh, if not superiour thereunto, as well in the so<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lemnity
of divine offices, as restraint from labour. So that
wee may perceive by this, that their intent from the be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginning,
was to cry downe the <hi>holy dayes,</hi> as superstiti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous,
<hi>Popish</hi> ordinances: that so their new <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

more private effects thereof, of lesse dangerous nature:
the people being so insnared with these new devises, and
pressed with rigours more than <hi>Iewish,</hi> that certaine<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly

in this point I will say nothing without good assurance,)
who in a furious kinde of zeale like the madde Prophetesse
in the Poet, have runne into the open streetes, yea and
searched private houses too, to looke for such as spent those
houres on the <hi>Lords day</hi> in lawfull pastimes, which were
not destinate by the Church to Gods publicke service: and
having sound them out scattered the company, brake the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>struments;
and if my memory faile me not, the musitians; &amp;
which is more, they thought that they were bound in con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>science

Some, that upon the <hi>Sabbath,</hi> will not sell a pint of wine, or
the like Commoditie: though wine was made by God, not
onely for mans <hi>often infirmities,</hi> but to make glad his heart,
and refresh his spirits, and therefore no lesse requisite
on the <hi>Lords day,</hi> then on any other. Others, which have
refused to carrie provender to an horse, on the supposed
<hi>Sabbath day,</hi> though our Redeemer thought it no impietie
on the true <hi>Sabbath day</hi> indeed, to leade poore Cattell to
the water: which was the motive and occasion of <hi>M.
Brerewoods</hi> learned Treatise. So for the female sex, maid
servants I have met with some two or three, who though
they were content to dresse their meate upon the <hi>Sabbath,</hi>
yet by no meanes would be perswaded either to wash their
dishes, or make cleane their kitchen. But that which most of
all affects mee, is, that a Gentlewoman, at whose house I lay
in <hi>Leicester,</hi> the last Northerne Progresse <hi>Anno</hi> 1634. ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pressed
a great desire to see the King and Queene who
were then both there. And when I proferd her my service,
to satisfie that loyall longing, shee thanked mee, but refu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed
the favour, <hi>because it was the Sabbath day.</hi> Unto so
strange a bondage are the people brought, that as before I
said, a greater never was imposed on the <hi>

                        <p>(9) But to goe forwards in my storie, it came to passe
for all the care before remembred, that having such a plau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sible
and faire pretence, as sanctifying a day unto the Lord,
and keeping a Commandement that had long beene silen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ced;
it got strong footing in the Kingdome, as before is
said: the rather because many things, which were indeed
strong avocations from Gods publicke service, were as then
permitted. Therefore it pleased King <hi>Iames,</hi> in the first en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trance
of his reigne, so farre to condescend unto them, as
to take off such things which seemed most offensive. To

béen informed, that there had béen in former times a great
neglect in kéeping</hi> the Sabbath day; <hi>for better observing of
the same, and for avoyding of all impious prophanation of
it, he straitely charged and commanded that</hi> no Beare-bai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting,
Bull-baiting, enterludes, common playes, or other like
disordered or unlawfull exercises or pastimes, <hi>bee frequen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted,
kept or used at any time hereafter upon any Sabbath
day.</hi> Not that his purpose was to debarre himselfe of <hi>law<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full
pleasures</hi> on that day, but to prohibit such <hi>disordered</hi>
and <hi>unlawfull pastimes,</hi> whereby the Common people were
withdrawne from the congregation: they being onely to
bee reckoned for <hi>Common playes,</hi> which at the instant of
their Acting or representing, are studyed onely for the en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tertainment
of the <hi>Common people,</hi> on the <hi>publicke Theaters.</hi>
Yet did not this, though much, content them. And there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
in the <hi>conference at Hampton Court,</hi> it seemed good to
D. <hi>Reynolds</hi> (who had beene made a partie in the cause) to
<hi>touch upon the prophanation of the</hi> Sabbath, <hi>(for so hee called
it) and contempt of his Majesties</hi> proclamation <hi>made for
the reforming of that abuse; of which hee earnestly desired a
straiter course, for reformation thereof: to which hee found
a generall and unanimous assent.</hi> Nor was there an assent on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly,
and nothing done. For presently in the following <hi>Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vocation,</hi>
it pleased the <hi>Prelates</hi> there assembled, to revive
so much of the <hi>Queenes Injunction</hi> before remembred, as
to them seemed fitting, and to incorporate it into the <hi>C<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

up of <hi>May-poles,</hi> or other sports therewith used; so
as the same bee had in due and convenient time, without
impediment or let of <hi>divine service:</hi> and that women
should have leave to carrie rushes to the Church, for the
decoring of it, according to their old custome: withall
prohibiting all unlawfull Games to bee used on the <hi>Sun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dayes</hi>
onely, as <hi>beare-baiting, bull-baiting, enterludes,</hi>
and at all times, in the meaner sort of people, by law
prohibited, bowling.</q> A Declaration which occasioned
much noyse and clamour; and many scandalls spreade a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>broade,
as if these Counsells had been put into that Princes
head, by some great Prelates, which were then of most
power about him. But in that point they might have satis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fied
themselves, that this was no <hi>Court-doctrine:</hi> no <hi>new<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>divinity;</hi>

and out of season,</hi> by publike Writings, private Preachings,
and clandestine insinuations, or whatsoever other meanes
might tend to the promotion of this <hi>Catholike cause:</hi> yet
finde wee none that did oppose it in a publike way, though

from them; and did lay downe indeed the truest and most
justifiable Doctrine of the <hi>Sabbath,</hi> of any Writer in that
time. But being written in the <hi>Latine</hi> Tongue, it came
not to the peoples hands: many of those which under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stood
it, never meaning, to let the people know the Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tents

which afterwards, in the yeere 1625. he published to the
World, with his other Lectures. Now, in this Speech, or
<hi>Determination,</hi> hee did thus resolve it. First, That the <hi>Sab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bath</hi>
was not instituted in the first Creation of the World;
nor ever kept by any of the ancient Patriarkes, who lived
<pb n="262" facs="tcp:4215:248"/>

the sanctifying of <hi>one day</hi> in <hi>seven,</hi> is <hi>ceremoniall</hi> onely,
and obliged the <hi>Iewes;</hi> not <hi>Morall</hi> to oblige us <hi>Christians</hi>
to the like observance, <hi>Sect. 3. &amp;</hi> 4. Thirdly, That the

This was the summe and substance of his resolution, then:

the greater numbers, such as were formerly possessed

I conceive, that he consulted more his owne opinion, and

defended rather. But to proceed, or rather to goe a little:

Thus did it please his excellent and sacred
Majestie to publish his most pious and religious purpose, of
opening to his loyall people that <hi>libertie</hi> of the Day, which
<pb n="269" facs="tcp:4215:251"/>
the Day allowed of; and which all <hi>Christian</hi> States and
Churches, in all times before, had never questioned: with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>all,
of shutting up that Doore, whereat no lesse than <hi>Iuda<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>isme</hi>
would in fine have entred, and so in time have over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ran
the fairest and most beautifull Church, at this day in
Christendome. And certainely, it was a pious and Princely
Act, nothing inferiour unto that of <hi>Constantine,</hi> or any
other Christian King, or Emperour, before remembred: it
being no lesse pious, in it selfe considered, to <hi>keepe</hi> the
<hi>holy-dayes</hi> free from <hi>superstition,</hi> than to <hi>preserve</hi> them
from <hi>prophanenesse;</hi> especially considering, that <hi>permission</hi>
of <hi>lawfull Pleasures</hi> is no lesse <hi>proper</hi> to a <hi>Festivall,</hi> than
<hi>restraint</hi> from labour. Nay, of the two, it is more ancient:
For in his time, <hi>Tertullian</hi> tells us, that they did <hi>diem solis
laetitiae indulgere,</hi> devote the <hi>Sunday</hi> partly unto <hi>Mirth</hi> and
<hi>Recreation,</hi> not to <hi>Devotion</hi> altogether; when, in an hun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dred
yeeres after <hi>Tertullians</hi> time, there was no Law or
Constitution to restraine men from labour on this day, in
the <hi>Christian Church.</hi>
                        </p>
                        <p>14 Yet did not his most excellent Majestie finde such
obedience in some men, and such as should have beene <hi>ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>amples</hi>
unto their <hi>flockes,</hi> as his most Christian purpose did
deserve: there being some so setled in the opinion of a <hi>Sab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bath
day,</hi> a day not heard of in the Church of Christ 40
yeeres agoe, that they chose rather to deprive the Church
of their paines, and ministerie, then yeeld unto his Maje<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sties
most iust Commands. For whose sakes specially, next
to my duetie unto God, my Soveraigne, and the Church my
Mother, I have employed my time and studies, to compose
this Historie: that they may see therein, in briefe, the pra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctise
of Gods Church in the times before them, and frame
themselves to doe thereafter; casting aside those errours in
the which they are, and walking in the way which they
ought to travaile. Which way, when all is done, will bee
<hi>via Regia,</hi> the <hi>Kings high way;</hi> as that which is most safe,
and of best assurance, because most travailed by Gods peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple.
Our private pathes doe leade us often into errour, and
<pb n="270" facs="tcp:4215:252"/>
sometimes also into danger. And therefore I beseech all
those who have offended in that kinde, to lay aside their
<hi>passions,</hi> and their <hi>private interests,</hi> if any are that way mis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guided;
as also not to shut their eyes against those truths,
which are presented to them for their information: that so
the King may have the honour of their due <hi>obedience;</hi> the
<hi>Church,</hi> the comfort of their labours, and <hi>conformable</hi> mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nistery.
For to what purpose should they hope, to be enno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bled
for their sufferings in so bad a cause, that neither hath
the <hi>doctrine</hi> of the <hi>Scripture,</hi> to <hi>authorize</hi> it; or <hi>practise</hi> of
the <hi>Church</hi> of God, the best Expositour of the Scripture,
to confirme and countenance it? or to bee counted con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stant
to their first Conclusions, having such weake and dan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gerous
premisses to support the same; since <hi>constan<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                                 <desc>•</desc>

rightly grounded, is at best but <hi>obstinacy,</hi> and many times
doth end in heresie. Once againe therefore I exhort them,
even in Gods name whose Ministers they are and unto
whom they are to give up an account of their imploiment;
and in the Kings Name, whom as Gods deputie they are
bound to obey, not for wrath only but for conscience sake;
and in the Churches name, whose peace they are to studie
above all things else; and their owne names lastly, whom
it most concernes, that they desist, and goe not forwards
in this disobedience, <hi>l<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

For my part I have done my best, so farre to give them sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tisfaction
in the present point, (so farre forth as the nature
of an Historie would permit;) as<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> they might thinke it no dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>paragement,
to alter their opinions and desert their errors,
and change their resolutions: since in so doing, they shall
conforme themselves unto the practise of Gods Church, in
all times and Ages. The greatest victorie, which a man can
get, is to subdue himselfe, and triumph over sinne, and er<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rour.
