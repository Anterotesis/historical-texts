            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>

I ſhall deſire your Chriſtian attention may accompany me to ſome preceding paſſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ges. In the beginning of this Chapter you may read <hi>Judas</hi> to betray <hi>Jeſus:</hi> in which bold and impious At<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tempt
<pb n="2" facs="tcp:52877:6"/>
the Soldiers fall to the ground, <hi>verſ. 6. Jeſus</hi> is taken and led to <hi>Annas</hi> and <hi>Caiphas, v.</hi> 12. and in the 15. <hi>verſe</hi> begins <hi>Peter's Denial</hi> of him. <hi>v.</hi> 19. according to the Contents of ſome of your Bibles, <hi>Jeſus</hi> is exa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mined before <hi>Caiphas. v.</hi> 18. you may read him arraign'd before <hi>Pilat,</hi> who accoſteth them that brought him be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore him, firſt with this Interrogation, <hi>What Accuſation bring you againſt this Man? v.</hi> 29. they reply, <hi>If he were not a Malefactor, we would not have delivered him up unto thee.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>It is time now, I conceive, as early as it is, by way of Preface to my Text to take them to Task, and to examine the weight of their words, for all was not Goſpel they ſaid, though it be mentioned in the Goſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pel. <hi>If he were not a Malefactor,</hi> as if they ſhould have ſaid, his Crime is ſo manifeſt that he needeth no Ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cuſation; what, do you doubt of the Righteouſneſs of our Proceedings who have done all things with de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liberation? and have found him worthy of Death, and we exſpect that you ſhould proceed to give Sentence: Depth of Hypocriſie! Madneſs! and Malice! as if being a Priſoner, bound, and in Fetters only, was Crime enough, and deſerved Death as a Malefactor? This was handſom indeed, high equity; ſure! who can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not perceive that they diſtruſted their Cauſ, and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore cunningly by way of Anticipation ſpoke what they did, leaſt they ſhould have been compelled to prove him ſo, a Criminal, a Malefactor, as they pronounced him to be? He that runneth may read their Hypocriſy, they would by all means be thought to be Conſoienti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous, as if they never attempted any thing, but what was juſt, and had never ſought the Death of any but
<pb n="3" facs="tcp:52877:6"/>
of Malefactors; when it ſtands upon ſacred Record as a baſe blot in their Eſcutcheon, that they unjuſtly ſlew all the Prophets that went before them.</p>
            <p>O the perfrict brazen Forehead! the Impudence of this Rout, to ſtyle Him a Malefactor, who had done Nothing but Good to their Nation. They ſhould have asked the Blind to whom he reſtored Sight: The Le<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pers whom he had cleanſed: The Lame to whom he gave Limbs, whether he was a Malefactor: But thus it was propheſyed, <hi>Pſal. 35. 12. They rewarded Me Evil for Good to the Deſpoyling of my Soul, and Hatred for my Love.</hi> Yet <hi>Pilat,</hi> as bad as he was, being ſtartled at their unjuſt Proceedings ſeemed to rid his Hands of him, with <hi>Accipite eum, Take ye him and judge him ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to your Law.</hi> The <hi>Roman</hi> Law forbidding to Condemn any before he be heard. Now do but ſee how they elude this, <hi>It is not lawful for us to put any one to Death:</hi> No, Then the Death of <hi>Stephen,</hi> lies at your doores, your preſent judgements confute your former practiſes: beſides, what was it other then to be the Death of Chriſt, ſo violently to beg it, with open Mouth thus to go againſt Him, and like ſo many Blood-hounds to cry him down. It ſeems by their Law he ſhould only have been ſtoned, by the <hi>Roman</hi> Law he muſt be Crucified; it was their in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tent then, not only that he ſhould Dy, but with the greateſt ignominy, pain, and ſhame that mought be. Neither is <hi>Pilat</hi> yet ſatisfied, for being entred into the <hi>Judgment-Hall</hi> again, and having convened Jeſus; he asketh Him, <hi>Art Thou the King of the Jews?</hi> In this he thought to have ſtruck the Nail on the Head: as if
<pb n="4" facs="tcp:52877:7"/>
Chriſt would (upon that Demand of his) have con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſſed Himſelf guilty of Treaſon againſt <hi>Caeſar,</hi> and of diſturbing the Peace of the Nation.</p>
            <p>But what ſaid our Saviour? <hi>Sayeſt thou this of thyſelf, or did others tell it thee of Me?</hi> As if he ſhould have ſaid, Little doſt thou think what thou ſayeſt, the My<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſterie that thoſe few words contain in them. For how couldſt thou ſtyle Me King, <hi>ſince no Man can ſay Jeſus is the Lord but by the spirit?</hi> Have it whence thou wilt, it is of weighty concernment, what thou haſt ſaid, didſt thou but underſtand it. Or we may ſuppoſe this Interrogation to be a Reproof of <hi>Pilat;</hi> as if our Saviour ſhould have ſaid, if this proceedeth from thy own Suſpicion, it is but an injuſt part thou doſt Act, for that is not the Star a Judg ſhould be led by, he ought not to be both the Judg and the Witneſs: If ſome others told thee ſo, why are not my Accuſers brought forth? If to Accuſe be enough to make a man Guilty, none will be Innocent, Judges are to proceed, <hi>ſecundum allegata &amp; probata,</hi> according to what is alledged and proved: Our Saviour probably ſaid this, to give him an occaſion to ſpeak what followed, <hi>Am I a Jew?</hi> This <hi>Pilat</hi> may be ſaid to ask in Scorn to that Nation, hateful to the Heathens for their Difference from them in Religion: as if he ſhould have ſaid, How can I ſpeak this of my ſelf who am not a Jew, but an Ethnick, and what have we Heathens to do with your Rites? The Chief Prieſts of your Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion delivered You to Me, and for This accuſed Thee to Me: they are the men that lay it to thy Charge, I neither Apprehended Thee; neither did
<pb n="5" facs="tcp:52877:7"/>
I Accuſe Thee. Certainly he would not, had he been a Jew, and Chriſt his King; yet, as his Place empowered him, he examins him, <hi>Quid feciſti? What haſt thou done?</hi> Our Saviour thought that Queſtion anſwered it ſelf, and therefore was not ſollicitous to Reply to it, having done nothing worthy ſuch uſage. A <hi>Kingdome</hi> he dreads not to tell him that he had, but it was not <hi>of this World, v.</hi> 36. of this Chap. Therefore he need not be thought to ſtand in their Light who had Kingdoms, they might have room enough to Sway their Scepters in for all him. Yet it is very obſervable, He doth not ſay his <hi>Kingdom</hi> was not <hi>In this World,</hi> but not <hi>Of this World;</hi> whence it follows, That there is another world, which <hi>Pi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lat,</hi> it is probable, dream'd not of; In which he that ſuffers the loſs of never ſo many Kingdoms here, may be riehly rewarded there. This could not but cure <hi>Pilat</hi> of that ſhaking Palſy which Fear had put him into, our Saviour talking of a King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom. Now this our Saviour proceeds to make more manifeſt thus, <hi>If my Kingdom were of this World, then would my Servants fight that I ſhould not be de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>livered to the Jews;</hi> as if he ſhould have ſaid, I would not be ſo imprudent as to go only with a few un-armed Diſciples, I would then be a little better Guarded, my Attendants ſhould be many and mighty, ſuch as know how to uſe their weapons, and to acquit themſelves like Men: Smiling, as it were, at the Vanity, and Impotence of worldly Po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tentates, who of themſelves ſignifie little, but de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pend on the ſtrength of external power, which if it

fail, they fall: but having that they can do any thing, bring Others to their Bent or Bow at plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure, have their Perſons at Command, as they had his; Yet <hi>Pilat</hi> cannot but harp on that String, witneſs his Language, <hi>Art thou a King then?</hi> This could make but harſh Muſic in his ears, who could not but envy him that Title howſoever, where-ever his Kingdom was: He was loth to ask where his King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom was, leaſt he ſhould not be far from Happineſs; ſure: No, take heed of that, Me-thinks I ſee him tremble at what our Saviour anſwered: <hi>Thou ſayeſt that I am a King;</hi> as if he ſhould have ſaid, What need I ſay it, when you your ſelf ſay as much, your own Mouth hath pronounced it; and yet leaſt the Man ſhould be too much dejected at it, our Saviour addeth, <hi>To this end was I born, and for this Cauſ came I into the world;</hi> what? to raign like other Kings? No, but to walk <hi>Antipodes</hi> to them rather; as if he ſhould have ſaid, 'Tis an Error to think that I am Ambitious of any Mundan Reign, any worldly Soveraignty; 'Tis thus, That my Kingdom is Spiritual, I cannot, I will not deny: but will aver it either before thee, or any <hi>Caeſar</hi> on Earth: Only know this, That it is the leſt of my Intention to moleſt other Kings, or pompouſly like them to Reign. But to be a witneſs to the truth am I come: At this <hi>Pilat</hi> ſeems to be pretty well pleaſed, and asketh him, <hi>What is Truth?</hi> But alas! it was more out of Deriſion and Contempt, then to be Informed: As indeed prophane Spirits cannot endure to hear ſavoury words, but they turn them
<pb n="7" facs="tcp:52877:8"/>
off with Scorn: as if he ſhould have ſaid, I hope you will produce no other truth then your High Prieſts do teach, you will not ſeem wiſer then they; will you? If you do, 'tis folly to declare it, I muſt interrupt you, for it is other Buſineſs that we are about, Your Life is in Queſtion: He would not ſtay for an Anſwer, but, <hi>went out,</hi> ſaith the Text, becauſe he thought <hi>Caeſar</hi>'s Laws ſufficient, and the knowledg of any other Truth needleſs: Beſides, he ſaw the Cloud to thicken; The <hi>Jews</hi> it is likely ban<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dying together, ſo that it was no time to hold con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ference any longer with him: and the <hi>Jews</hi> feared, leaſt Chriſt having obtained Liberty to ſpeak for him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf, he might ſo work upon the Judg, and melt the hearts of the reſt on the Bench, as to fruſtrat their Deſign. Well, for all this, He that before went out to hear his Accuſation, now goes out to excuſe him to the People, to his Accuſers. Behold him ſeemingly to heap Civility upon Civility upon our Saviour, even in the mid'ſt of his Severity.</p>
            <p>For firſt, Tho on the one ſide were Perſons of great Rank and Quality, from whom he mought expect a Becoming reward for his Injuſtice, or dread their Diſpleaſure if he did not act as they would have him: And on the other ſide Chriſt, who was mean and contemptible, in outward appearance, forlorn and forfaken, yet he gives it for him a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt the <hi>Jews,</hi> caſting their Malice, as it were, in their Teeth.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="8" facs="tcp:52877:9"/>
Secondly, He ſtands not only up for Chriſt, mau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gre all their eager expectation of the contrary, but Confounds his Adverſaries pronouncing Him innocent: and that not without an Emphaſis, <hi>I find in him no Fault at all.</hi> And yet this <hi>Vulpone,</hi> this Fox, leaſt their teeth ſo ſharp ſet, ſhould (for want of a Prey) faſten on himſelf, he tells them, <hi>you have a Cuſtom;</hi> an ungodly one it was, what ever was the ground of it: Some think it was in memory of <hi>Jonathan,</hi> reſcued by the People from Death, which his Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther had threatned him with. Others, that the Feaſt mought be celebrated with the more Joy and Glad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs. Others more probably ſay, it was in remem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brance of their Deliverance from the <hi>Egyptick Bon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dage.</hi> But if ſo, one would think the Paſchal Lamb ſhould have been Memorial enough for that, but they muſt do ſomewhat additional, though not com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manded by God: Thus Hypocriſie is alwayes buſie in preferring its own Figments before God's Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mands; yet I verily beleive the World would have been more happy then it is, had it not had worſe Judges then <hi>Pilat</hi> was in ſome reſpects: For do but ſee how Induſtrious he ſeems to be for Chriſt's Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leaſe. For this end he rubs up a Cuſtome of theirs, to capacitate them to Releaſe him: he did not per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vert an Old Law, or eſtabliſh a New one: Setting up a High Court of Juſtice to try him by. Then he propounds them two, None is in Competition with him but <hi>Barabbas,</hi> a notorious Miſcreant, whom he thought none would be for; Nay more, he ſeems to Beg him, or at leſt to bid them chooſe him,

But <hi>Pilat,</hi> it ſeems, was deceived, for the great ones before had been at the People to ask <hi>Barabbas,</hi> and to leave <hi>Jeſus</hi> to undergo Death. The Multitude, which not long before was for Him, now unanimouſly bandy againſt him. For they cryed all again, ſay the words immediately preceeding my Text: Envy, you ſee cannot be quiet till it hath made the perſon it ſtrikes at perfectly miſerable: But why again? They cried all again: You may remember they before cryed, <hi>if he were not a Malefactor, we would not have deli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vered him unto thee.</hi> That which they cryed again, was that which I cannot, it being my Text, but repeat again, <hi>Not this Man, but Barrabbas.</hi> Thus Beloved, having preſented you with that Preface, which can be ſtil'd no leſs then Neceſſary.

He was notorious, I. For Rob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bery, he was a Robber, ſaith our Evangeliſt. II. For Sedition, he troubled the whole City, ſaith S. <hi>Luke.</hi> III.

ſets them out in their Colours, characterizeth them to their Heads, <hi>Acts 3. 14. But ye</hi> denied <hi>the Holy one, and the juſt, and</hi> deſired <hi>a Murtherer to be gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven unto you, and killed the Prince of Life.</hi> This was he that was thought only worth naming with them; Chriſt out of contempt, being branded with the Appellation of <hi>This Man:</hi> they had rather cele<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brate their Paſsover with that wretch, then with Jeſus. And no marvel, for they knew this Fellow would prove no eye-ſore them, would patiently permit them to do what they would, give them Liberty of Conſcience, and ſo would be exellent company for them; alas, he was not for their Tooth, who came from Heaven upon Errands of Holyneſs, and Refor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mation, whoſe Example would put Vice out of countenance, and upbraid their madneſs. No, they had too much of Him already, <hi>Not this Man, but Barabbas,</hi> what more intenſe blindneſs, madneſs, and malice could betray it ſelf? What was this but to ſay, what I think, you cannot hear without trem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bling, <hi>Occidatur qui ſuſcitat Mortuos, &amp; dimittatur qui Occîdit vivos,</hi> as one hath it; Let him die, who rais'd the Dead, and him be releas'd whoſe Trade it is to deſtroy the Living: Let Life depart, and Darkneſs remain. The Peace-maker be diſpatcht, and the Seditious repriv'd. How by this Action, or Election of theirs, did the <hi>Jewes</hi> in the ſaddeſt ſenſe, forſake the Fountain of Living waters, and betake themſelves to a muddy, bloody, dirty puddle of water: They did not ſet free the Nocent only in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſteed of the Innocent, but put to death Him, who
<pb n="13" facs="tcp:52877:11" rendition="simple:additions"/>
was a conſtant, and faithfull Benefactor to them. And thus my Diſcourſe all along (if you have ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerv'd it) reſpects the buſineſs of this Day, which is to be humbled for the horrid Murther of an in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nocent Perſon, a good Benefactor to this Nation, under whom it had flouriſht many years. Firſt then, in this the <hi>Jewes</hi> betray'd ſuperlative ingratitude, and high Baſeneſs to preferr ſo vile a perſon before Him, who choſe them from among all Nations, to be His peculiar People, his choice Incloſure. Secondly, here was their Malice, who car'd not how things went, ſo as in this they had their wills. Thirdly, this ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gues them Blind, (indeed Malice is blind) asking what they ſhould have been againſt the death of their Saviour, and the Releaſe of a Thief: and as they paſſionately deſired, ſo it came to paſs, hugging their Bane in Him, whom they were ſo hot to have releas'd. For the Vengeance, which ſuch a Choice merited, did not long ſleep, neither would it, If they had not made uſe of that <hi>Cabell, His Bloud be upon us and our Children,</hi> to pull it down more ſpeedily upon them: For <hi>Titus</hi> (ſaith <hi>Joſephus)</hi> beſieging <hi>Je<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ruſalem,</hi> when the <hi>Jewes</hi> (pincht with <hi>Famine)</hi> came forth in Multitudes to ſeek food for their famiſht Souls, he daily caus'd a number of them to be Cru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cified, in ſo much that at length, ſaith the Hiſtorian There was ſcarce any place to erect Croſſes on, nor Croſſes enough to faſten their Bodiesto. This, this was the Crop of ſeverity, which their ſinful choice yielded them.

by that Tyrant, who cryed again, <hi>Non hune, Not this man, but</hi> Barabbas: But what? had not <hi>Pilate</hi> a Finger at leſt in this, from the guilt of which he cleared him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf, would have been thought to do ſo by waſhing of his hands? as if he ſhould have ſaid by that action, I am innocent, therefore look ye to it; that I condemn this man, O ye <hi>Jews,</hi> I do it not voluntarily, but being compell'd. I am innocent, I call Heaven to witneſs, it is you that are Nocent, and guilty of his Bloud. This Hypocrite he was as Scarlet, or Purple within as without, in Heart as in Habit, notwithſtanding all that Formality of waſhing his hands: acceſſary he was to the Death of the Lord of Life in a high degree, being a faint-hearted Judge, afraid to give Inno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cency its Reward. Had he bore up valiantly againſt the ſtream of the multitude, he had approv'd him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf an honeſt man, and a good Judge. What could be more baſe and dirty, and ſinful, then to confeſs he found no fault at all in Him, and yet not to find in his heart to acquit him, but to curry favour with the people adjudges him to be Crucified. Thus, <hi>Non rarò bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>norum virorism Capitibus, ut Talis aut Teſſeris Ludunt,</hi> ſaith one; 'Tis the Old Game of the world for the Heads, and Lives of good men to be plaid with like Dice, or Cheſs-men, by Great men, that they might ingratiate themſelves with each other. I have read of an Apologue to this purpoſe, it run's thus; The Wolf, the Fox, and the Aſs on a time came toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther to Shrift. The Wolf confeſt, and was diſmiſt, the Fox did likewiſe, and was abſolv'd, but the Aſs confeſt, and his fault was this; that being hungry

he took one ſtraw out of the ſheaf of a poor Pil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>grim travelling to <hi>Rome,</hi> for which he was ſeverely puniſhed; the Fox, and the Wolf ſtraight fall upon him, and devour him, maintaining that the poor Aſſes Crime was ſo great as to deſerve it. The Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble applys it ſelf; To be ſure where <hi>Pilat</hi> is Judge <hi>Barabbas</hi> ſhall be loos'd, and the Innocent condemned. I do believe unjuſt <hi>Syſamnes</hi> whom <hi>Cambiſes</hi> flead, and of his Skin made a Cuſhion for all ſucceeding Judges to lean, and look on, was a Saint to this Judge, as ſubtely as he carried it; And yet as madd, and malicious as the People were, they could not hinder their Priſoner from evading a Glorious King, though nothing but unworthy, baſe uſage came from them. Glorious in his perſonal vertues, Glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rious in his Divine Graces, but moſt Glorious in his Conſtancy, and perſeverance, in his Charity even amidſt all his Sufferings, which nothing could more magnifie then this Choice of theirs, Electing <hi>Barab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bas,</hi> and rejecting <hi>Jeſus,</hi> not before they had done either good or evill; but after One had done all the Evill, and the Other for divers years together all the Good imaginable, then to elect the Robber, and reject the Saviour, what could more make againſt them, and for Him?

II. Let this Competition mind us of that we are ſo much concern'd in. Tho God hath left the Heathen without excuſe, yet he hath not left us without a choice, our Salvation is elective, both on God's part and ours, I would, but yee would not, 'tis God's own language. Hence likewiſe it is no leſs <hi>true,</hi> then a <hi>right</hi> ſaying, he that made thee without thy ſelf, will not ſave thee without thy ſelf; Indeed, were there but one Object within our reach preſented to the Faculty of election in man as <hi>one</hi> Chriſt, <hi>one</hi> Holi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs, our receiving of him could not be call'd choice, but it mought be ſtil'd neceſſity rather. But ſince there are many Chriſts, aſwell as Antichriſts, and diverſ ſorts of holineſs, it will behove us to be wary what choice we make. To ſee that we have not ſo much Faith for the <hi>Alcoran,</hi> as for the Bible; and as much obe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dience for the Devil, as for God, for the Law in our members, as for that of our mind. It muſt need's be more obliging not to ſay meritorious, for a <hi>Joſeph</hi> to be chaſt at Court, than for another to be ſo in a Cottage, or in a Cell. For a Souldier to be tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perat in the Camp, where he is beleagured with Temptations to the contrary, than for another to be ſo at home. To be a Chriſtian in <hi>Nero</hi>'s houſ than at a greater diſtance from danger. Thou art vir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tuous becauſ thou canſt not eaſily be otherwiſe, this is a Commendation that leav's but a flat fare<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>well behind it. 'Tis an Act, not only of Wiſdom, but of God's great Goodneſs thus to order it, to leav the Chriſtian <gap reason="foreign">

               </gap> as it were in the Confines of two moſt diſtant people, improvable unto Good,
<pb n="18" facs="tcp:52877:14" rendition="simple:additions"/>
and capable of Evil. For Righteouſneſs to go for thy refuge, and not for thy choice, as it doth where there is no Rival Sin, is to be content <hi>that</hi> ſhould be without its Crown, and thy ſelf without thy Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward: which conducts mee from the Competition, to the Competitors, Chriſt, and <hi>Barabbas.</hi> From whence learn wee,</p>
            <p n="1">1. Not to build on the multitudes vogue or choice, to eſteem no otherwiſe of its Applau, or Appro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bation than of a whiff of Smoak, the beſt Emblem of its baſe inconſtancy. But <hi>now</hi> they cryed <hi>Hoſannah. Now</hi> they are all for Crucify him, Crucify him. <hi>Vox populi</hi> was not here <hi>Vox Dei,</hi> but <hi>Mors Dei.</hi> The voice of the people was not the voice of God, but the death of God rather. Follow not a multitude to do evil (ſaith the Holy Ghoſt) as if it did little, or nothing elſ, but do ſo. We muſt then get a pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſervative againſt the Infection of the multitude (as well as that of the <hi>Plague)</hi> or elſ it is like to go ill with us. It is the worlds guize to elect what is evil, and to reject what is gaod; It is the nature of that ugly Ape to hug its Brats, as moſt lovely, and Beautiful. What more lively example of this is there, than the carriage of theſe <hi>Jewes</hi> at this time? How unworthily did they write all thoſe Benefits our Saviour conferr'd on them, in water, witneſs their Praeteritition, or paſſing him by, and their Chooſing a bloody Thief and Seditious, prefer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring ſuch a one before him! This is that foul Sin St. <hi>Peter</hi> makes bold to tax them home with in his Sermon, laid it to their Hearts, and were Converted.

I do verily believ there is not a perſon that hears of this, but hate's this Action in the <hi>Jewes,</hi> Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demning it in their Thoughts, and were he askt, would ſay he did ſo. And yet how many are there who knowing the Judgement of God inflicted on them for it, do not only do the ſame thing in effect, but have pleaſure in them that do it, to uſe that of S. <hi>Paul</hi>'s language, <hi>Rom. 1. 32. There is no Sin but is as baſe as Barabbas,</hi> nay worſ, for he had not been ſo vile, and baſe without it. How loudly doth the Swearer make one with theſe, Larding his Diſcourſ with Oaths, damnably confronting that ſtrict Command, <hi>Swear not at all,</hi> for he will do nothing at all but ſwear, and ſo by conſequence cry's, <hi>Non hunc, Not this man, but Barabbas.</hi> I ſhall only deſire of ſuch a Sinner, that he would tell me what fruit he can exſpect, or ever any did reap from that Bramble, beſides Gods Curſ? Hell-fire is the puniſhment of ſuch, whoſe toungs are ſo ſet on fire of Hell. Neither can the Hypocrit excuſe himſelf, who ſeems to be for Chriſt, wearing his Livery on his back, but <hi>Ba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rabbas</hi> his Favour in his Boſom, who was a Thief, and a Robber; ſo is he in his Shop, it may be, though not on the Road. What ſhould I ſay of the unclean perſon, who is one of this Rout, of this Rabble too? <hi>How</hi> by making the Members of Chriſt, the <hi>Members</hi> of a Harlot, doth he day and night cry, <hi>Non hunc, Not this Man, but Barabbas.</hi> My adviſe to ſuch a one ſhall only be this, to labour for a ſaving inverſion of theſe words, as thus, to turn, when tempted, this <hi>Hunc</hi> into <hi>hanc,</hi> I mean, (upon Choice) to ſay,

You would wonder now, if I ſhould prove it poſſible for you to be crying up of <hi>Barabbas,</hi> even while you are hearing of Chriſt preached. Beloved, he that gives way to wanton, luſtful looks, or wordly thoughts at a Sermon, ſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fering them to take up his Mind, crie's with the <hi>Jews, Non hunc, Not this Man, but Barabbas.</hi> But ſee that yee refuſe not Him that ſpeaks, to ſpeak in S. <hi>Paul's</hi> words, <hi>Heb.</hi> 12. 25. <hi>For if they eſcape not, that refuſed him that ſpake on earth, much more ſhall we not eſcape, if we turn away from him that thus ſpeaks from heaven.</hi> The <hi>Jewes</hi> paid for their <hi>Nolumus hunc, We will not have this Man to raign over us,</hi> And for their <hi>Non hunc, Not this Man,</hi> but ſuch a one: And ſo ſhall we too, if we repent not in time of our Recuſancy. Let thoſe then that hate and abhorr the <hi>Jews</hi> for this, indeed, to be lamented Choice, deſcend into themſelvs by Examination, and ſee they be not guil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty of the ſame. What is there ſo baſe, and ſo vile but a corrupt mind will prefer before Chriſt.</p>
            <p n="2">II. Hence as in a Mirrour we may ſee the Preva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lency of the Actions of Great Men, the attractiveneſs of them. If <hi>Herod;</hi> and <hi>Caiphas</hi> do begin, Chriſt ſhall have fiſts enough abought his ears; there will not be wanting that will ſmite him with Toung, as well as with the Hand: Fly blow and bliſter his Fame to purpoſe. With Inferiours example doth more then precept, and like men in a Crowd they do not go, but are carried rather. Do any of the Rulers believ in him? This Queſtion deterr'd many of the Vulgar,
<pb n="21" facs="tcp:52877:15"/>
from adhering to our Saviour: The weightieſt Drops of whoſe blood, I do believ, fell (in the ſaddeſt Senſ) on the Wiſeſt of them: For had not They firſt preacht Him down in their Synagogs, the People had never cryed Him down in the Judgment-Hall: with a <hi>Non hune, Not This Man, but</hi> Barabbas.</p>
            <p n="3">III. Here is matter of Comfort, in our vilified, reproacht Condition here below, As thus. I. That we cannot be lower than our Saviour was in the World's Repute. II. That his Diſreputation hath Sanctified Ours. If ſuch a one who had don ſo much Good could not procure a Good word from thoſe he did it to, why ſhould ſuch Unprofitable Servants, as we are at beſt, be troubled if we be awarded with frowns for our Favors; with Cruelty from others from our kind<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs to them. I'm ſure this Lamb of God opened not his Mouth repiningly, was dumb before the Shearers, who, as much as in them lay, rob'd him of the whole Fleece of his Reputation; yet that which at firſt ſight ſeems to make for his ignominy, realy conduc'd much for his Glory; For his Father would not have him ranſom'd at ſuch a rate, as to be beholding to the peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple's Favour for his Repriev and live under the Notion of a Malefactor, who beeing innocent would be Condemn'd and Dy with more Honor, as he did to the ſtigmatizing of them, who were his Judges, and Perſecutors with the Brand of perpetual infamy. In ſhort, here is matter as of Comfort; ſo of Caution: leaſt at any time we make our Teeth to meet in the rigid Cenſure of that Penſon that die's not a Natu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral, but a violent Death. What is this but to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demn

the Generation of the Righteous? I remember, <hi>Lam.</hi> 4. 20. there is a paſſage to this purpoſe. <hi>The breath of our Noſtrils, the Anointed of the Iord is ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken in their pits.</hi> Which was this that fell as a Morſel into his enemies Mouths, but a good King, one, under whoſe Government they pronoun't themſelvs Happy, as it follows in the ſame verſ. Beloved, it is unchriſtian to judg temporal puniſhments to be judgements due unto Sin. Suffer me to ſpeak it, Thy wickedneſs is too triumphant, who will not acknow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledg that ſome afflictions are for Trials, and in or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der to the increaſ of Grace, and Glory unto God's dear Children. 'Tis as much as to ſay, Chriſt could not be the Sun of Righteouſneſs, becauſe he did ſet in ſuch a Cloud of wretchedneſs (at his Death) as to outward appearance, dying on the Croſs in the midſt of two Theeves, as if the chiefeſt Malefactor. 'Tis not it the manner of one's Death, but the Courſ of one's Life that makes really wretched, or happy. To think otherwiſe is to pronounce thy ſelf as much out in thy judgement, as theſe <hi>Jewes</hi> were in their Choice, when they all cryed, <hi>Non hunc, Not this Man, but Barabbas.</hi> I have now done with my Text, and it may be exſpected I ſhould ſpeak ſomwhat of the Oc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>caſion; For this is not only a Faſt-day, but a Fune<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral, which we Solemnize: The Funeral of as pious a King as ever <hi>England</hi> had to ſway its Scepter: That litle that is to be found in Bad men the holy Ghoſt hath thought good to Regiſter. <hi>David</hi> pen'd <hi>Saul</hi>'s <hi>Epicedium,</hi> which runs thus, <hi>Saul, and Jona<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>than were lovely, and pleaſant in their Lives, and in

their Death they were not Divided, yee Daughters of</hi> Iſrael <hi>weep over</hi> Saul, <hi>who cloath'd you in Scarlet, and other Delights, who put Ornaments of Gold upon your Apparel, 2. Sam.</hi> 1. 23, 24. Which gives a ſufficient warrant to mention, and not only ſo, but to <hi>com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mend</hi> the Dead: which I intend not to do at this time. His incomparable worth want's not the var<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſh of my water-Colours to ſet him off. Neither ſhall I bliſter the air of this ſacred place with men<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tioning of any of thoſe who had a hand in his Death: ſince Juſtice is in purſuit of them, and its Iron<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hand will recompenſ the Slowneſs of its Leaden feet. But becauſe ſome were eminently inſtrumental to bring to paſs the <hi>Death</hi> of that juſt Man, ſhall <hi>Wee</hi> think our ſelves Innocent? <hi>God</hi> forbid. There are none of us of mature years, but by our Sins gave earneſt for that fatal Stroak, which made three King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>domes Miſerable at once. So that well may Wee aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſume that paſſionat wiſh of the Prophet <hi>Jeremy, O that our Heads were Waters, and our Eyes Fountains of Tears, that wee may lament Day and Night for the ſhedding of the Innocent Blood of that good King,</hi> The Top-branch of which Royal Ceder, (to the root of which Envy and implacable Malice laid the Ax) the Lord preſerv.</p>
