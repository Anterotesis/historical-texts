            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

               <salute>Christian Reader,</salute>
            </opener>
            <p>VVHen the design of giving the
<hi>Sense</hi> and <hi>Use</hi> of the Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures
so briefly as might be,
was set on foot by some who
looked upon it as very useful for the present
and succeeding Generations, the Reverend
Author of this piece was prevailed with to
take a share in that undertaking; from whom
much service of that kind (considering his abi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lities
and indefatigableness in his studies)
might have been expected, if (as himself
elsewhere intimateth) his papers upon some
Books of Scripture had not been destroyed by a
sad accident, in the times of our calamity and
trouble. Notwithstanding which discourage<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment,
he fell to work again, and did go through
the Epistles to the <hi>Galatians, Ephesians, Phi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lippians,</hi>
and <hi>Colossians,</hi> his Expositions up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
which were published in his own life-time;
<pb facs="tcp:61385:3"/>
and left this Exposition upon both the Epistles to
the <hi>Thessalonians</hi> ready to be transcribed for
the Press, some time before his Death.</p>
            <p>I shall not here insist to give any full cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>racter
of this Reverend person, who having
served his own Generation by the Will of God,
is now fallen asleep and doth rest from his la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bours,
and who being dead, yet speaketh, by
the savory effects of his Faith, Love, and Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tience,
expressed in his personal walk and Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nisterial
administrations, besides what his
publick writings do declare concerning him.
His Piety, Learning, Prudence and moderati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
(and that in very contentious and distract<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
times) were not only well known and
much esteemed an the Congregation where he
served, and the Province wherein he lived,
but did render him very famous throughout this
national Church. Such as conversed with him
in ordinary, and were acquainted with his
studies, did discern more of his spirit and abi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lities
than himself was willing to make shew
of; and were convinced that (beside his abi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lities
for explicating and applying of the
Scriptures in this more plain and compendious
way, and for enlarging and pressing of Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture
truths, with solidity and seriousness in
his ordinary Preaching) he was a man of a
deep reach, and well fitted for giving of ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vice
<pb facs="tcp:61385:3"/>
in perplexed and intricate cases, whereof
not a few did occur in his time; and (with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>all)
well furnished for discussing of Contro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>versies,
and stopping of the mouths of gain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sayers;
whereof he gave an ample proof,
when in publick Preaching, he did solidly and
perspicuously examine and refute those errors
which of late did infest this Church and Island.
But (forbearing to write Elogies of him
whose true worth did set him far above the
commendation of such a one as I am) all that
I need to say at this time, is, That as (I
doubt not) thy acquaintance with what of
his is already published, will sufficiently com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mend
unto thee what further of that kind hath
flowed from his Pen; So I dare assure thee;
upon unquestionable evidence, that this piece
is genuine, and the work of Mr. <hi>Fergusson:</hi>
The Copy made use of at the Press being tran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>scribed
from the Original written with his
own hand, and revised by two of his Brethren
in these parts; from one of whom I received
it, that I might also read it over before it
went to the Press. And though I be otherwise
crouded with abundance of work in my
present service; yet I have taken some
time to peruse it, to my own very great sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tisfaction.</p>
            <p>It remains therefore (Christian Reader) that
<pb facs="tcp:61385:4"/>
thou study how to improve this advantage
which (among others) is, by the good provi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence
of God, put into thy hand; lest in a
time wherein many means of knowledge do
abound, the increase of ignorance, Atheism,
and Popery prove a sad plague and snare, and
the abuse of Light provoke God to send dark<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness
wherein no man can walk. From which
that thou may be delivered, is the Prayer
of,</p>

relation of their Conversion to and constancy in the
Faith of his own ministerial carriage when he was
among them, and of the solicitous care he yet had
of them, notwithstanding of his absence from
them, to engage them yet further to constancy and
perseverance in the doctrine received for the time
to come: Which he laboureth to effectuate in the first
principal part of this Epistle, <hi>Chap.</hi> 1. 2, 3. And
partly to incite them unto several duties of an holy
life, which he doth endeavour in the second part of
this Epistle, <hi>Chap.</hi> 4. and to vers. 23. of <hi>Chap.</hi> 5.
having at the close of <hi>Chap.</hi> 4. from Vers. 14.
occasionally intermixed a doctrinal truth, concern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing

               <p>IN this Verse is the Inscription, declaring, first,
who was the immediate Pen-man of the Holy
Ghost in writing this Epistle, to wit, <hi>Paul:</hi> toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
with the joynt asserters, and approvers of the
truths contained in it, to wit, two of his associates
in the work of the Ministry, while he was at <hi>Thes<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>salonica;
Silvanus,</hi> the same as it seemeth with
<hi>Silas,</hi> Acts 17. 4. and <hi>Timotheus</hi> an Evangelist
<hi>(2 Tim. 4. 5.)</hi> and of great reputation in this
Church, <hi>Chap.</hi> 3. 2, 6. Secondly, to whom the
Epistle was directed, who are described from their
spiritual state, they were a Church called from the
World and Idols, to serve the true and living-God,
<hi>Ver.</hi> 9. from the place of their habitation at <hi>Thes<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>salonica,</hi>
and their relation <hi>to God the Father,</hi> and
to <hi>Christ</hi> the Son; <hi>in</hi> whom they are said to be,
because of their worshipping of, and union with
God in Christ, whereby the true Church is di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stinguished
from Heathens, and Jews; an union,
I say, either external in all visible Church members,
or internal also in real believers: See upon <hi>Phil. 1. 1.
doct.</hi> 6. Thirdly, The Apostles usual salutation or
<pb n="5" facs="tcp:61385:6"/>
comprecation, whereby he prayeth for <hi>Grace</hi> and
<hi>Peace</hi> unto them. See these words explained upon
the former Epistle.</p>
               <p>Besides what hath been observed already upon
the inscriptions of the former Epistles, <hi>Learn,</hi> 1.
It is the duty of Christs Ministers not only to en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deavour
seriously, that a people turn from Idols to
God, and that a Church of Christ be set up among
them; but also to take notice how the work of God
doth afterwards thrive with them, what obstructi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons
are in the way of their progress, and how they
may be useful for removing these obstructions, and
promoving the work of Grace among them, and to
lay out themselves to the utmost accordingly: and
this whether they be present with them, or absent
from them; for <hi>Paul</hi> having, by the help of <hi>Sil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vanus,</hi>
and <hi>Timotheus,</hi> planted a Church among
the <hi>Thessalonians,</hi> did perform the prenamed duties
afterwards, even when he was absent from them, as
appears by the inscription of this Epistle, <hi>Paul—
unto the Church of the Thessalonians.</hi> 2. A Mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ster
of Christ is not alwaies, or ordinarily, to in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culcate
his own Ministerial dignity and authority
upon the people, except when it is evident that his
so doing may contribute to advance his masters
work, lest otherwise his hearers judge him a man
vain-glorious and arrogant, as seeming to be much
delighted in reiterating that often, which tends to
set forth his own praise, 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 3. 1. For, because
(as it seemeth) this Church did not question <hi>Paul</hi>'s
Apostolical authority, therefore he doth not assert
it, nor design himself by it, as he did to other
Churches, <hi>Paul unto the Church,</hi> &amp;c. 3. The Spirit
<pb n="6" facs="tcp:61385:7"/>
of the Lord in Christs Ministers makes them of
such an humble condescending temper, in order to
their gaining ground upon the Lords people, as they
will not stand to stoop somewhat below what they
are, and to make use of all lawful means and helps
which may serve to procure respect unto their mes<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sage
among the people, even of such as are below
themselves, and whereof they have no need, ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cept
in order to that end: For, though <hi>Paul</hi>'s Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stolick
authority was sufficient in it self to commend
the following truths unto the Church of God, <hi>Gal.
5.</hi> 2. yet because his two Associates had great weight
among the <hi>Thessalonians,</hi> he doth join them to
himself, though far inferiour to himself, that by
all means he might procure the more respect unto
his doctrine: <hi>Paul and Silvanus, and Timotheus
unto the Church.</hi> 4. It is but small advantage unto
a people or society that they bear the name of a
Church, except they have the marks and characters
of a true Church, whereof this is one, that they
worship the unity of the God-head in plurality of
persons, and acknowledge Jesus Christ the second
person in his mediatory office, and that by our
union with him we come to be one with the Father:
For, all this is implyed, while they are said to be
in God the Father, and in the Lord Jesus Christ;
whereby he doth distinguish them from all false
Churches, whether of Pagans, who are not in
God, but in Idols; or of Jews, who worship not
a Trinity, nor God in Christ: <hi>Which is in God
the Father, and in the Lord Jesus Christ.</hi> 5. Even
these who have obtained grace and favour from God,
have yet need of more grace, for preserving them
<pb n="7" facs="tcp:61385:7"/>
in that state of Grace wherein they are, <hi>Rom.</hi> 14. 4.
for encreasing the sense and manifestation of it,
<hi>Psal.</hi> 51. 8, 12. for pardoning and subduing these
evils, which otherwise might provoke the Lord to
withdraw it, 1 <hi>Joh.</hi> 2. 1. and for enabling them to
grow in the graces of his Spirit, that they may in
some measure walk suitable to his grace and favour,
<hi>Joh.</hi> 15. 2. 8. For, <hi>Paul</hi> wisheth for grace even to
these <hi>Thessalonians,</hi> a great part of whom were in
a state of grace and favour already: <hi>Grace be unt
you.</hi> 6. The Lords Ministers, in the entrance of
their labours towards a people, would endeavour to
have their own hearts really affected with enlarged
desires after the peoples good, both spiritual and
temporal, that all their pains taken among them
flowing from this fountain, and not from base, car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal
and selfish motives, 1 <hi>Pet.</hi> 5. 2. may be the
more acceptable to God, 1 <hi>Pet.</hi> 5. 4. pleasant and
easie to themselves, as flowing from an inward
principle, 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 12. 15. more blessed of God for
gaining ground upon the people, <hi>Chap. 2. ver.</hi> 7, 8,
with 13. and the more heartily entertained and ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cepted
of by them; especially, when these inlarged
desires of Ministers towards their good are made
known unto them, <hi>Gal.</hi> 4. 13, 14, 15. For, there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
doth our Apostle not only labour to get his
heart so affected, but ordinarily in the entry of his
Epistles maketh so much known unto those to whom
he writes: <hi>Grace be unto you, and Peace,</hi> &amp;c.</p>
               <q>Ver. 2. We give thanks to God alwaies for you
all, making mention of you in our prayers.</q>
               <p>
                  <pb n="8" facs="tcp:61385:8"/>
The Apostles scope being to excite those <hi>Thessa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lonians</hi>
unto constancy in the Faith and Doctrine of
the Gospel, he doth for this end make known the
good esteem which he and his associates had of
them, in so far, as they did alwaies, that is, in all
their immediate addresses to God, make conscience,
1. Of thanksgiving to God for them all, to wit,
because of the graces of Gods Spirit after menti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>oned,
which they in charity, and from some speaking
evidences, as it seems, did judge (for what they
knew) were bestowed upon them <hi>all.</hi> 2. Of
praying to God on their behalf, to wit, for constan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy
and growth in the knowledge of the Gospel,
and practice of true piety: So <hi>Chap.</hi> 3. 12, 13.
Hence learn, 1. A begun work of grace in us is
then improved aright, when we do not draw an
argument for fostering laziness and sloth from it;
but are thereby incited to hold fast what is already
received, and to seek after more: For, <hi>Paul</hi>'s
scope is to incite them unto constancy, and further
progress, by making them know what thoughts he
had of Gods grace already in them, in this and the
following Verses: <hi>We give thanks,</hi> &amp;c. 2. We
would endeavour so to speak<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> unto others of these
saving graces which are in them, as thereby they be
not puffed up with conceit; but made in all their
richest receits to see matter of humiliation in them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves,
and of thanksgiving unto God: For, there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
<hi>Paul</hi> being to let them know how much he
esteemed of their graces, maketh entrie to his pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pose;
not by setting forth their praises, but <hi>by
giving thanks to God</hi> on their behalf, teaching them
to do the like. 3. It is the duty of the Lords
<pb n="9" facs="tcp:61385:8"/>
people, in their immediate addresses to God, to
present the case one of another before the Lord,
and to be suitably affected with it; both with their
enjoyments, to thank the Lord for them; and with
their wants, to pray to God that he would supply
them: and especially, a Minister ought to be affe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cted
thus to the people of his charge, for so was
<hi>Paul</hi> and his associates; <hi>We give thanks—
making mention of you in our Prayers.</hi> 4. Then
do we discharge this duty which we owe one to
another, faithfully, when we do it constantly, and
alwaies when occasion is offered to approach unto
God for our selves; otherwaies our seldom dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>charging
of this duty, doth speak it is not minded
seriously, or affectionately. For, <hi>Paul</hi> gives
thanks to God <hi>alwaies</hi> for them. 5. Concerning
the extent of <hi>Paul</hi>'s charity towards them all, so as
to take matter of thanksgiving to God from all and
every one of them; see upon <hi>Phil. 1. 7. doct. 3.
doct.</hi> 6. As the duties of Prayer and Praise go well
together, and do mutually contribute for the help
one of another: So we would make such a disco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>very
unto others of the good that is in them, to
make them thankful, and set them upon the duty of
Praise, as to make them also know there is much
good yet wanting, to keep them humble, and to set
them upon the duty of Prayer: For, <hi>Paul</hi> doth
both these, while he sheweth them he not only
giveth thanks for the good they already had, but
also prayeth for that which was yet lacking: <hi>Making
mention of you in our Prayers.</hi>
               </p>
               <q>Ver. 3. Remembring without ceasing, your work
of Faith, and labour of Love, and patience of Hope
in our Lord Jesus Christ, in the sight of God and
our Father.</q>
               <p>
                  <pb n="10" facs="tcp:61385:9"/>
The Apostle prosecutes the forementioned scope,
by giving reasons of his often thanksgiving to God
for them: And first, in this Verse he sheweth that
those graces, which he, with his associates, saw
kything in them, had left such an impression upon
them, that they could not but without ceasing, or
when ever occasion offered, make mention of them
both to God and men: Of which graces he reckon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth
three, in the exercise whereof all Religion doth
consist, 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 13. 13. First, Faith, whereby we
assent in our understandings to the truth of all Gods
Word, <hi>Act.</hi> 24. 14. because of his authority who
hath revealed it, <hi>Joh.</hi> 4. 42. and are acted in our
will and affections suitable to what whose truths do
hold out, <hi>Heb.</hi> 11. 13. But do especially rest on
Christ for Salvation, that good thing offered in the
Promise, <hi>Act.</hi> 16. 31. 2. Love, whereby we
wish well to <hi>(Ps. 40. 16. Matth. 5. 44.)</hi> and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sire
to be one with <hi>(2 Cor. 5. 8. Gal.</hi> 5. 12, with
15.) and do acquiesce and rest satisfied with what
goodness and perfection we find in <hi>(Ps. 18. 1, 2.
Prov. 16. 13.)</hi> both God and man (especially his
Saints) each in their own order, <hi>Matth. 22. 37,
38,</hi> 39. 3. Hope, whereby we do firmly expect
<hi>(Rom. 8. 25. Phil. 1. 20.)</hi> those good things
which God hath promised, and are not yet per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formed,
<hi>Rom.</hi> 8. 24. Next, he amplifies first each
of those graces from their effects: To Faith he
ascribeth a work, not only because it is the work of
<pb n="11" facs="tcp:61385:9"/>
Gods Spirit in us, <hi>Col.</hi> 2. 12. but also because it
actually worketh by Love, <hi>Gal.</hi> 5. 16. purifieth
the Heart, <hi>Act.</hi> 15. 9. and is an active principle of
all good offices which we perform towards God or
man, <hi>Rom. 14. 23. Heb.</hi> 11. 6. To <hi>Love</hi> he
ascribeth <hi>Labour.</hi> The Word signifieth such la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bour
as wasteth and wearieth the Spirit, 2 <hi>Cor. 11.
27.</hi>—whereby he intimateth their unwearied
industry, wrestling through much discouragement
and difficulty, for the furthering the good of Gods
Church and distressed members thereof. And to
<hi>Hope</hi> he ascribeth <hi>Patience,</hi> it being <hi>Hope in the
Lord Jesus Christ,</hi> or a well grounded expectation
of Eternal Life wrought by Christ, and relying on
Christ, which makes the person who hath it Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stianly
patient, and courageously resolute to endure
all hardships he can meet with, until the good thing
promised be at last perfomed, 2. <hi>Cor.</hi> 4. 16. with 18.
<hi>Secondly,</hi> he doth amplifie them all joyntly, by
their sincerity and soundness, implyed in this, that
they were studious of those vertues as in the sight of
God; see <hi>Gen.</hi> 17. 1. And by the great incou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ragement
they had to that study, from their com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon
and joynt-interest in <hi>God</hi> as <hi>their Father.
Doct.</hi> 1. It is a Christian duty incumbent to all, and
especially to Ministers through vertue of their office,
to be much taken and affected with the good we
perceive in others, so as length of time, distance of
place, or multiplicity of other business make us not
forget it; and that while we remember it, we do
not suppress it, or the deserved commendation of
those in whom it is, that so we may thereby prevail
both with our selves and others to follow and imi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tate
<pb n="12" facs="tcp:61385:10"/>
it, <hi>Rom.</hi> 11. 14. and especially to bless the Lord
for it: For <hi>Paul,</hi> though now at a distance, and
much involved in other affairs, both of his own and
of publick concernment, doth yet a long time after,
alwaies when occasion offered, call to mind and
commemorate the graces of God bestowed up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
these <hi>Thessalonians;</hi> as a ground of thanksgiving
to God, both by himself and others: <hi>Remembring
without ceasing.</hi> 2. Then do we rightly remember
the graces of God, parts and abilities of others,
when the remembrance of them doth not produce
discouragement, carnal emulation and envy in our
selves, <hi>Numb.</hi> 11. 29. or flattering applause unto
those who hate them, <hi>Prov.</hi> 24. 5. but matter of
thankfulness to God who gave them: For, as ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pears
from the connexion, <hi>Paul</hi>'s remembrance of
their graces produceth this effect in him: <hi>We give
thanks <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>

                        <desc>••</desc>
                     </gap>asing.</hi> 3. A
real believer may look upon the gracious receipts of
others as matter of his thanksgiving unto God, in
so far as their receipts do not only commend the
giver, <hi>Eph.</hi> 1. 3. but are profitable unto us, as a
Copy to imitate, see <hi>vers.</hi> 7. as a ground of in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>couragement,
to expect the like from God to our
selves, 1 <hi>Tim.</hi> 1. 16. and several other waies:
For, <hi>Paul</hi> gives thanks to God for their receipts,

5. As inward grace in the heart, where it
<pb n="13" facs="tcp:61385:10"/>
is lively, cannot be hid, but must of necessity kyth
in its effects and fruits without; so it is not grace
in the naked habit, but grace in exercise, which can
yield comfort or incouragement unto the man him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>self,
or matter of thankfulness unto God from
others: For, it was the <hi>work of Faith,</hi> the <hi>labour
of Love,</hi> and <hi>patience of Hope,</hi> for which <hi>Paul</hi>
giveth thanks to God, and from which he doth both
incourage and incite them to constancy. 6. Though
only God and a mans own conscience can pass a
certain and infallible judgement upon his inward
sincerity of heart, in the exercise of Christian vertues,
<hi>Rom.</hi> 14. 4. yet so much of a mans sincerity may
kyth to gracious discerners in his outward conver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sation
and carriage, as will afford sufficient ground
to pass a charitable judgement upon him, as one who
dischargeth his duty sincerely, and in the sight of
God: For, though <hi>Paul</hi> knew not their hearts, yet
he doth charitably judge they were sincere in what
they did, while he saith, <hi>your work of Faith, la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bour
of Love—in the sight of God.</hi> 7. Then may
we charitably judge that a mans external actions
are done in sincerity, and flow from an inward root
of grace in the heart, when for any thing appear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth,
he doth labour to make conscience of all those
external duties, wherein the exercise of any Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stian
grace doth consist, and neglecteth none when
God doth call him to it: For, <hi>Paul</hi> from their per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>forming
not only the work of Faith, but also the
labour of Love, and the patience of H<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>pe, doth
judge in charity they had the inward habits of those
graces, and did what they did sincerely, and in the
sight of God. 8. The Believers laying claim unto,
<pb n="14" facs="tcp:61385:11"/>
and maintaining of an interest in God as his by
Covenant, gives much enlargement of heart unto
him to exercise his graces, and to carry himself sin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerely,
and as in Gods sight in all his actions: It
is our distance from God, our way-giving
unto misbelief, first to question and then to deny an
interest in God as ours, which marr the exercise of
grace, <hi>the word of Faith,</hi> &amp;c. and in progress of
time doth make us not only do less, but also more
unsound and less straight in what we do: For, he
maketh their <hi>work of Faith—in the sight of
God,</hi> to be accompanied with and carried on by
this, that God was looked upon as their Father:
<hi>In the sight of God and our Father.</hi>
               </p>
               <q>Ver. 4. Knowing, brethren beloved, your electi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
of God.</q>
               <p>Here is a second reason of their thanksgiving to
God, which he doth usher in by two sweet stiles he
giveth unto them, to wit, of <hi>Brethren</hi> to him, and
<hi>beloved of God,</hi> as the words may well be read: see
2 <hi>Thes.</hi> 2. 13. And the reason is, the knowledge
which <hi>Paul,</hi> with his Associates, had of their <hi>Ele<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction</hi>
to grace and glory from all eternity by God,
as Election is taken, <hi>Eph.</hi> 1. 4. where see in the
Exposition, and <hi>Doct.</hi> 1, 2, 3. and it seemeth Ele<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction
must be taken in that sense here, as appears
from a parallel place, 2 <hi>Thes.</hi> 2. 13. and not for
their effectual calling, though the word be so taken
elsewhere, <hi>Joh.</hi> 15. 19. Now <hi>Paul</hi> is said to know
their Election, if, we mean the Election of this or
that man in particular, not according to an infallible
<pb n="15" facs="tcp:61385:11"/>
judgement of certainty, for so none without speci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>al
revelation can know the Election of others, no
more than he can infallibly know the secret motions
of their heart, which alone do infallibly discrimi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nate
the hypocrite from the man who is truly rege<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nerate,
1 <hi>Joh.</hi> 3. 14. and consequently are the only
infallible evidences of a mans Election, and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
he knew their Election according to that judge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment,
which is over-ruled with charity and ground<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
upon such evidences as are most probable, though
not infallible; such are the external acts of Piety,
further than which no man can infallibly see into
another, seeing only God searcheth the heart,
<hi>Rev.</hi> 2. 23. Although, if we conceive, as it safely
may be conceived, that the Apostle doth mean here
of the election not of this or that man in particular,
but of the whole Church indefinitely and in com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon,
then the knowledge he had of their Election
was most infallible and certain, to wit, that not on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
he knew nothing, as it seemeth, in the contrary
to the Election of any of them in particular, and
had positive probable evidences, that many of them
were elected; but also though he could not take up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
him infallibly to condescend upon particular
persons, yet he did know assuredly that some among
them were elected, seeing God sendeth his Word
in power (as he had sent it to those <hi>Thessalonians,</hi>
ver. 5.) unto no people, no not to the worst, but
where some do appertain to his Election of grace,
<hi>Isa.</hi> 6. 13. with 9. and from those some, being the
better part, <hi>Paul</hi> (as usually elsewhere, <hi>Rom. 1. 7.)</hi>
doth denominate the whole. <hi>Doct.</hi> 1. The work
of saving grace in the heart, manifesting it self in a
<pb n="16" facs="tcp:61385:12"/>
mans external actions, is an undoubted mark of his
eternal Election; so that according to the evidence,
whether infallible or conjectural only, that we have
of the former, we may and ought to be the more
or less perswaded of the latter. Thus, <hi>Paul</hi> because
he had promising evidence, that those saving graces
of Faith, Love, and Hope were in them, <hi>Ver.</hi> 3.
he doth in this Verse, from charity, judge that
they were elected: <hi>Knowing your Election.</hi> 2. Then
is the Faith and knowledg of our Election solid, and
of the right stamp, when it doth not make us secure,
lazie, or to loose the reins to profanity and vice,
but stirs us <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>p to greater diligence in keeping the
ground we have already gained, and in advancing
forward for gaining more: For, the Apostle's scope
in the telling them of their Election, is thereby to
excite them unto constancy in the doctrine received.
3. The Faith and knowledge of our Election, and
that God hath singled us out from others to bestow
upon us Eternal Life, may sweeten the saddest of
outward dispensations, and make us raise a song of
praise to God for that, at least, what ever be his
dealing with us otherwaies: For, though this peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple
did labour under sad afflictions, <hi>Chap.</hi> 2. 14.
yet <hi>Paul</hi> doth look upon their Election as a ground
of thanksgiving to God from him, and much more
from themselves: <hi>We give thanks,</hi> ver. 3. <hi>Know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
your Election.</hi> 4. A gracious heart doth judge
it a piece of his highest credit to reckon spiritual
kindred unto all who are born of God, and will
love them dearly, and carry himself affectionately
and affably towards such as are beloved by him:
For, because they were <hi>beloved</hi> by God, they were
<pb n="17" facs="tcp:61385:12"/>
                  <hi>brethren</hi> to him, the latter compellation containing
in it the cause of the former.</p>
               <q>Ver. 5. For our Gospel came not unto you in word
only, but also in power, and in the Holy Ghost, and
in much assurance; as ye know what manner of
men we were among you for your sake.</q>
               <p>—Followeth a third reason of their thanksgiving
to God, which serveth also for an evidence that
there was an Elect people among them: which
reason is first propounded, to wit, the lively man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner
after which he and his associates had Preached
the Gospel among them; called <hi>their Gospel,</hi> be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause
they were intrusted to Preach it, 2 <hi>Cor. 5—19.</hi>
and the manner of their Preaching is set down,
1. Negatively, it was <hi>not in words only,</hi> that is,
as he explains himself, 1 <hi>Cor. 2. 4. not with the
inticing words of mens wisdom,</hi> or varnished over
with some fair sophistical flourishes of eloquent
language, tending more to amuse the hearers, tickle
the ears, and commend the Preacher, than to edifie
the judgement, to work upon the affection, and to
commend Christ to peoples hearts. Next posi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tively,
it was, 1. in power, that is, accompanied
with such boldness, liberty, Gospel simplicity,
plainness of language, seriousness and fervent edge
of affection in the Preachers, as did render the word
so spoken, in some measure, apt to work powerfully
upon the hearers: For, so doth <hi>Paul</hi> himself seem
to explain what is meaned by Preaching in power,
1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 2. 4, 13. and 4. 19, 20. Secondly, Their
Preaching was in the Holy Ghost, that is, it was
<pb n="18" facs="tcp:61385:13"/>
confirmed by Signs and Miracles wrought among
them by the Apostle and his Associates, as they
were extraordinarily assisted thereunto by the Holy
Ghost: See the Holy Ghost so taken, <hi>Acts 19. 2.
3.</hi> It was <hi>in much assurance,</hi> whereby is meaned
that full perswasion above all doubt, which was in
<hi>Paul</hi> and the other Preachers, of the truth of what
they Preached; so that they spoke not of these
truths doubtingly, but confidently, and as of things
which they had heard and seen, 1 <hi>Joh.</hi> 1. 1. Now
that all these three expressions do set forth some<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>what
in the Preachers, according to the sense given,
rather than the effect of their Preaching upon the
hearers, spoken of, <hi>ver.</hi> 6. appears from the last
clause of this Verse, where he appeals to the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sciences
of the <hi>Thessalonians,</hi> if they the Preachers
had not in all things carried themselves among them
answerable to what he presently spoke; and with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>al
sheweth that all that they did of that sort, and
that God did by them, was for their sake and good,
which doth make the present purpose subservient to
the Apostles scope, to wit, that therefore even upon
the account presently mentioned, there was
ground of thanksgiving to God for them, and that
they were bound to persevere in that doctrine, which
God had made to be Preached among them in such
a lively manner for their good. <hi>Hence learn,</hi>
1. That God hath sent the Gospel in life and power
unto a people, and given them a lively and powerful
Ministry, though but for a season, to sow the seeds
of grace and saving knowledge among them. It is
no small matter of thanksgiving unto God, both from
themselves and others on their behalf, even though
<pb n="19" facs="tcp:61385:13"/>
their faithful Pastors afterwards should by force of
persecution be for a time removed from them: The
good and fruit of such a Ministry, is not alwaies
removed with them, but lasteth after they are gone,
<hi>Joh.</hi> 4. 37, 38. For, <hi>Paul</hi> doth thank the Lord up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
behalf of this Church, that he and his Associ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ates
had Preached the Gospel in life and power
among them, though they were for the present
driven from them: <hi>We give thanks,</hi> &amp;c. Ver. 2.
<hi>For our Gospel came unto you—in power.</hi>
2. The Lords usual way is not to send a lively and
powerful Ministry unto a place, but where he hath
some of his Elect to be converted and saved by that
means: For, <hi>Paul</hi> having affirmed, <hi>ver.</hi> 4. that
he knew there was an Elect people among
them, he giveth this as one evidence upon which
that knowledge was grounded, even because God
had sent such a Ministry unto them: <hi>For, our Gos<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pel
came unto you—in power.</hi> 3. That a people
or person may prove constant in Faith and Piety,
they would often remember the Love of their first
espousals to Christ, with what fervency and seri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ousness
he did bear himself in upon them, how
sweet, how lively, how ravishing the glad tidings
and report of him in the mouth of his servants were
once unto them, and how much they were then
convinced of a beauty in truth, and in the feet and
carriage of those who did carry the message of
truth and peace unto them: The remembrance
whereof may stir up some longing desires to find that
in Christ, in Truth, and in a sent Ministry, which
once they found, at least may render them ashamed
to make defection from them: For, the Apostles
<pb n="20" facs="tcp:61385:14"/>
remote scope, as we shew, in calling them to mind
of the lively manner, wherein the Word was first
Preached among them, and how they themselves
were witnesses to it, and convinced of it, is hereby to
excite them unto constancy and perseverance: <hi>For,
our Gospel came unto you—in power.</hi> 4. As there doth
usually but little fruit accompany a Ministry, when
Ministers do study words more than purpose, and to
busle their purpose in such a dress of words as may
set out themselves rather than commend Christ, and
tickle the ear rather than edifie the hearer: So where
a Minister doth make it his study to get Christ form<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
in, and ground gained upon the hearts of hearers,
and to fall upon such purpose, such words and such
strains of utterance and delivery of his purpose from
affection, plainness, and holy boldness, as may con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duce
most for that end; the pains of such a Mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stry
are usually seconded most by the Holy Ghost,
and does afford much matter of thanksgiving to the
Lord; for by the former the Gospel cometh in word
only, and by the latter it cometh in power also; and
<hi>Paul</hi> sheweth that not the former but the latter
was accompanyed with the Holy Ghost, and looks
upon it as a reason of his thanksgiving to God; <hi>For,
our Gospel came not unto you in word only, but in pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>
                     <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="2 letters">
                        <desc>••</desc>
                     </gap>
also and in the Holy Ghost.</hi> 5. That the truths of
the Gospel were once confirmed by such signs and
wonders, as none could work but they who were
extraordinarily gifted by the Holy Ghost for that
end, may abundantly fix us in the Faith of those
truths, it being impossible that the God of truth
should ever have set his Seal unto a Lye, <hi>Rom.</hi> 3. 4.
For, <hi>Paul</hi> would have them confirmed and constant
<pb n="21" facs="tcp:61385:14"/>
in the Faith of these truths Preached by him, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause
they were confirmed with such signs and won<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders,
and in the Holy Ghost. 6. The more a Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nister
be perswaded, and above all doubt, of the
truth of what he Preaches, the more he believes and
doth therefore speak, and the more he speaks as one
who believes, and hath ventured his soul upon the
truth which he Preaches, his Preaching will prove
the more powerfull, and apt to work effectually up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
the hearts of hearers: and the more he doubts,
the less he believes and is perswaded of these truths
which he Preacheth, his Preaching will prove the
more warsh, lifeless, and coldryf; For, we may
look on the third expression, as one ground and
cause of what is held forth in the first, their Gospel
came <hi>in power,</hi> because it came <hi>in much assurance,</hi>
or the Preachers did assuredly believe the truths
which they Preached; see 1 <hi>Cor. 3. 12. Psal.</hi> 16. 10.
7. The Lord hath indued his Church, and eespeci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally
believers in his Church, with a gift of discern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing,
whereby they may be enabled, in some mea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sure,
to put difference betwixt a lively powerful Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nistry,
and that which is coldryf, dead, and lifeless;
betwixt the man who speaks because he believes,
and him who though he speak, yet believeth not:
In the exercise of which gift, they would not be
rash in passing an immediate sentence upon the
hearts of Ministers, <hi>Col.</hi> 2. 23. except in so far
as their inward temper doth kyth in their external
actions, <hi>Matth.</hi> 7. 16. They would not be pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>remptory
in passing certain judgement, especially to
the worst, upon a doubtful evidence, 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 13. 7.
Nor yet too open minded, to vent what they judge,
<pb n="22" facs="tcp:61385:15"/>
                  <hi>Jam.</hi> 1. 19. especially, when they can gain nothing
by so doing, but the raising of prejudices against a
Minister in the minds of others, and consequently
the marring of that good, which they were reaping
by him. However, that they are indued with this
gift is clear from this, that <hi>Paul</hi> appeals to the
<hi>Thessalonians,</hi> as witnesses of that power, and much
assurance in which he Preached, while he saith,
<hi>As ye know what manner of men we were among
you.</hi> 8. It is a Ministers wisdom, and a piece of
Christian modesty, in speaking to his own com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mendation,
to hold himself most by that for the truth
whereof he may appeal to the ears, eyes, and chiefly
to the consciences of his hearers; For, so doth <hi>Paul</hi>
appeal to their consciences for the truth of what he
spoke: <hi>As ye know what manner of men we were
among you.</hi> 9. These excellent gifts and graces,
and other ministerial qualifications, which Christ
bestoweth upon godly and able Ministers, are not
bestowed upon them for their own sake, or particu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lar
satisfaction and advantage only, or so much as
for the behoof of the Church, and especially of
the Elect in it; he dealeth the more liberally with
Ministers for the sake of those, and therefore they
should improve and make use of all their receipts for
the good of <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>uch: For, <hi>Paul</hi> sheweth that he was
inabled to Preach in power, in the Holy Ghost and
in much assurance—<hi>for their sake.</hi>
               </p>
               <q>Ver. 6. And ye became followers of us, and
of the Lord, having received the Word in much
affliction, with <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="2 letters">
                     <desc>••</desc>
                  </gap>y of the Holy Ghost.</q>
               <p>Here is a fourth reason of their thanksgiving to
<pb n="23" facs="tcp:61385:15"/>
God, which serveth also as an evidence moving
<hi>Paul</hi> in Charity to judge all these to be elected of
God unto Eternal Life, in whom he had ground to
conceive that this here spoken of was verified:
And this reason of thanksgiving, or evidence of
election is taken from the saving effects of the Gos<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pel
Preached upon them; which are first generally
proponed, to wit, that in their life and practice
they had been followers of, or conformed themselves
to that excellent pattern and example held forth un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to
them by their Preachers, and the Lord Christ.
2. Illustrated, 1. from the necessary antecedent, or
moving cause of their so doing, which was their
receiving the Word Preached, to wit, in their
judgements, by understanding the sense, <hi>Act.</hi> 8. 30.
and assenting to the truth of it, <hi>Heb.</hi> 4. 2. and in
their heart and affections, by embracing the good
things offered by it, 1 <hi>Tim.</hi> 1. 15. and subjecting
themselves in all things to be ruled by the prescript
of it, <hi>Matth.</hi> 7. 24. 2. From an instance of
some things wherein they did imitate such excel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lent
patterns, to wit, that as Christ and his Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vants
had readily Preached the Gospel with much
spiritual joy, <hi>Joh.</hi> 4. 34. notwithstanding many
hard pressures and afflictions both from men and
Devils, <hi>Acts</hi> 5. 41, 42. So they had chearfully em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>braced
the Gospel, and adhered to it in the midst of
much affliction and persecution, unto which they
were so far from a base ceding, that they did cou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ragiously
sustain the dint of it with joy, and a joy
not carnal and natural but spiritual, and such where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of
the Holy Ghost is Author. <hi>Doct.</hi> 1. Though cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity
believeth all things, 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 13. 7. and maketh
<pb n="24" facs="tcp:61385:16"/>
a man easie to be perswaded of any good thing in
another; yet a Christian ought not to be foolishly
credulous, so as to believe things without, far less
against, evidence: But his charity in judging ought
to be ruled by prudence, so as he believe nothing but
upon some probability and appearance: For, <hi>Paul</hi>
did not judge them Elect, but upon some evidence,
even this, that <hi>they were followers of him and of
the Lord.</hi> 2. The way approved of God for at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taining
the Faith of our own Election, or a chari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>table
perswasion of the Election of others, is not
to dive in immediately and at the first step upon the
secrets of Gods decree, as if we had stood in his
counsel, <hi>Jer.</hi> 23. 18. But by way of discourse and
reasoning to collect and conclude, that God hath
elected us or others, from the work of saving grace,
and the effects of that work kything in us or them:
For, the Apostles scope here, as I shew, is not on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
to give an additional reason of his thanksgiving,
but also an evidence, from which he did conclude
their Election, from the fruits and effects of saving
grace in them: <hi>Ye became followers of us and of
the Lord,</hi> saith he. 3. It is the duty of Christi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans,
and such as being made conscience of, doth
strongly savour of a gracious change in them, to
propound unto themselves for imitation, not the
example of a multitude to do evil, <hi>Exod.</hi> 23. 2.
but of those in whom they observe the most emi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nent
evidences of a work of saving grace: For,
the Apostle doth mention this as a matter of their
commendation, a reason of thanksgiving to God on
their behalf, and as an evidence of their Election
that they did imitate him, and his Associates:
<pb n="25" facs="tcp:61385:16"/>
                  <hi>And ye became followers of us,</hi> saith he. 4. As
there would be something worthy of imitation in
the life of a Minister, besides his plain, painful and
elaborate Preaching, otherwise his naughty life
may destroy more than his Preaching can save,
seeing all men are more addicted naturally to be
guided with example than with precept, <hi>Gen.</hi> 42. 16.
and with an ill example rather than a good,
<hi>Gal.</hi> 2. 13. So it is the duty of people not only to
lend an ear to their Ministers doctrine, but an eye
to his pious life and conversation, that the same in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>structions
being inculcate, both upon the ear by his
doctrine, and their eye by his example, they may
work upon their hear<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>s and lives the more effectual<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
For, both these are implyed while <hi>Paul</hi> com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mends
them from this that they did imitate their
Pastors: <hi>And ye became followers of us.</hi> 5. The
most gracious of Christians, whether they be pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vate
professors, or publick Ministers, are not to be
followed absolutely, and in all things, but in so far
as they are followers of Christ, whose example is
the rule and measure of all examples, and is to be
followed absolutely, and without reservation in all
his moral actions, wherein he intended to cast us a
Copy, <hi>Matth.</hi> 11. 29. For, <hi>Paul</hi> mentioneth
their following of the Lord in the last place, as that
which did bound and set the just limits unto their
following of men: <hi>Ye became followers of us, and
of the Lord.</hi> 6. Such power is there in the Word
of God when it is received, that is, understood,
assented unto and embraced, and especially when the
word of promise is by Faith received, and improved
both for pardon of sin, and subduing of it, <hi>Act.</hi> 15. 9.
<pb n="26" facs="tcp:61385:17"/>
that it works a mighty change in the receivers of it,
makes them quit their wonted guides, the course of
this world, the Prince of the power o<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap> the air, and
the lusts of their flesh, <hi>Eph.</hi> 2. 2. and give them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves
up to follow the examples of men most emi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nent
in gracious practice, in so far as they are fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowers
of Christ. Neither can any gracious change
of this kind be expected in them, until the word be
thus received by them: For, <hi>Paul</hi> makes their re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiving
of the Word a necessary antecedent of their
following of him and Christ: <hi>Ye became followers
of us and of the Lord, having received the Word.</hi>
7. As persecution and affliction from men, incited
by the Devil, <hi>Rev.</hi> 2. 10. that inveterate enemy of
mans Salvation, is the common lot of those that
embrace the truth; so it is not sufficient to prove a
man Elected of God, or that a real work of grace
is wrought in him by God, that he embrace the
truth under a fair Sun-shine of prosperity attending
the professors of it, except besides other evidences,
he be at least content and ready to undergo the ut<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>most
of affliction and persecution he may meet with
for his profession; nor yet that he imitate Christ
and his Servants in pleasant, profitable, and credi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>table
duties, except he also imitate them in
promptness of mind to carry a cross for truth, and
to undergo other duties which are more expensive,
unpleasant to the flesh, and liable to shame and dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>grace
before the world: For, <hi>Paul</hi> doth evidence
their Election not from their following of him and
Christ in any duty, or from receiving of the Word
simply, but from their receiving of it in much af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fliction.
8. Neither yet is it a sufficient proof of
<pb n="27" facs="tcp:61385:17"/>
a gracious work in the heart, that a man do em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brace
some piece of a suffering lot for Christ; an
hypocrite may endure somewhat before he change
his way, <hi>Gal.</hi> 3. 4. There must be at least a rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diness
of mind to undergoe much affliction, yea the
utmost that Satans malice and power can reach un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to:
for <hi>Paul</hi> doth instance their praise-worthy
imitation of Christ and his followers in this, <hi>They
received the word in much affliction.</hi> 9. Neither
is it yet sufficient that a man endure much afflicti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
and variety of crosses for the Gospels sake, if so
he do it droopingly, and because necessity drives
him to it, an hypocrite may suffer much on that
account, 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 13. 3. There must be also a cheer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful
frame of spirit under suffering; for, saith he,
<hi>ye received the word in much affliction, with
joy.</hi> 10. Neither is it yet sufficient that a man en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dure
affliction with joy, except it be a joy of the
right stamp, and whereof the Spirit of God is the
author, a joy arising from spiritual grounds, such
as, that the least grain weight of the bitter gall
and wormwood in our cup is measured out by the
hand of Providence, <hi>Luk.</hi> 12. 6, 7. which turneth
all things about for good, <hi>Rom.</hi> 8. 28. that by much
affliction we are made like our master, <hi>Phil.</hi> 3. 10.
that by our sufferings the Church of God is edifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed,
truth is confirmed, <hi>Phil.</hi> 1. 7. and aliens made
to enquire after it, <hi>Phil.</hi> 1. 13. and that if we suffer
with him, we shall also reign with him, 2 <hi>Tim.</hi> 2. 12.
A real hypocrite may attain to a carnal, natural joy
in suffering, arising from natural grounds, such as
a mis-application of rich promises made unto suf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferers,
<pb n="28" facs="tcp:61385:18"/>
as if they did not suppose the grace of faith
in him who suffers, <hi>Phil.</hi> 1. 29. and an ambitious
desire to leave behind him the name of constancy,
and of being a martyr and sufferer for a truth;
'tis not this latter, but the former joy which
makes a lively frame of spirit under the cross: for,
saith he, in much affliction, with joy of the holy
Ghost.</p>
               <q>Ver. 7. So that ye were ensamples to all that be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve
in Macedonia and Achaia.</q>
               <p>The Apostle doth inlarge what he presently said,
of their courage, patience, and cheerfulness in re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiving
the truth, and adhering to it, in the midst of
many pressures and afflictions; first, from this, that
not only their whole Church in general, but almost
all the members thereof in particular, were so many
ensamples and lively patterns, to wit, for their pati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence,
cheerfulness, courage, constancy (which he
implyed to have been eminently in them, <hi>v. 6.)</hi>
and for their other Christian vertues, unto all be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lievers,
which were either in <hi>Macedonia,</hi> their
own Nation, <hi>Act.</hi> 27. 2. or in the bordering Nati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
of <hi>Achaia, Act. 19. 21. Doct.</hi> 1. Then are
Christians praise-worthy for the grace of God in
them, and their graces a speaking mark of their
election, both unto themselves and others, when
they do not rest upon the smallest measures, but by
growing in grace do, from a principle of holy emula<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion,
labour to outstrip others, even those who were
in Christ before them: for, <hi>Paul</hi> by way of thanks<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>giving,
<pb n="29" facs="tcp:61385:18"/>
                  <hi>v.</hi> 2. (whereof the purpose of this verse
may be lookt upon as an additional reason) com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mendeth
the grace of God bestowed upon the <hi>Thes<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>salonians,</hi>
as a speaking mark of their election,
<hi>v.</hi> 4. from this, that through reason of their growth
in grace, they were <hi>ensamples unto all who believed
in Macedonia and Achaia.</hi> 2. Such may be the
conceitedness of old professors, of their measure
of grace already received, <hi>Luk.</hi> 15. 28, 29. such
may be their undervaluing of others, <hi>Act. 21.
28,</hi> 29. provoking the Lord to withdraw his in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fluence
in a good measure from them, <hi>Luk.</hi> 18. 14.
and such may be the edge of zeal in new begin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ners,
<hi>Gal.</hi> 5. 7. and the fresh sense of mercy new<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
received by them, <hi>Gal.</hi> 4. 15. occasioning the
Lords dispensing more of his special influence to
them, <hi>Jer.</hi> 2. 2, 3. that the former may be far
out-stripped, as to growth in grace, by the latter,
and those who were last may become first: for,
though some of them, at least, in <hi>Macedonia</hi>
(namely the Church at <hi>Philippi, Act. 16. 12. with
17.)</hi> were converted to Christ before the <hi>Thessa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lonians,</hi>
yet in a short space the <hi>Thessalonians</hi> be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>came
<hi>ensamples unto all who believed in Macedonia
and Achaia.</hi> 3. Though there should be an
holy emulation and strife among Christians, who
can advance in the way of piety, with greatest di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligence,
<hi>Heb.</hi> 10. 24. yet those who are outstrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed,
would not, yea need not, be carnally emulous
or envious at those who are before them, seeing
the progress of one is the benefit and advantage
of another, in so far as the outstripped Christian
hath a new incitement and incouragement to duty,
<pb n="30" facs="tcp:61385:19"/>
from the example of those who are further ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vanced
than he is: for, those <hi>Thessalonians,</hi> having
outstripped all who believed in <hi>Macedonia</hi> and
<hi>Achaia,</hi> became ensamples to them. 4. It adds
the more matter of commendation unto a Church,
when not only their external Church state, being
exactly framed according to the prescript of Gods
word, becometh an imitable pattern for other Chur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ches
besides, but when also particular Church mem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bers
do so walk in the practice of all Christian
vertues and duties suitable unto that state, as that
each of them, for the work of saving grace shining
forth in them, becomes a laudable pattern for others
to follow: for, <hi>Paul</hi> commendeth the <hi>Thessaloni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans</hi>
not so much from this, that their whole Church
in general was an ensample, but almost all the
members thereof were so many ensamples, and
lively patterns to be followed by others: <hi>So that
ye were,</hi> not an ensample, but ensamples. 5. As
the merciful Lord, besides the word of truth point<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
out the way of our duty, hath thought it ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cessary
to furnish us with the examples of others,
who have trod in the path of duty before us, that
so we may know our duty to be feazible, seeing
men subject to the like infirmities, have already
practised it, <hi>James</hi> 5. 17. and the neglect of duty
to be the more hazardous, seeing all who have
walked in the way of duty before us will be made
use of as witnesses against us, <hi>Heb. 11. 7. and</hi> 12. 1.
So the same Lord hath thought it fit to provide us
with variety of such examples, whereof some are more
some less eminent, that they who are discouraged
to follow eminent examples, as despairing ever to
<pb n="31" facs="tcp:61385:19"/>
come near their copy, may take unto them courage
and heart to imitate those whose examples were of
lesser note and magnitude: for, not only Christ
and the Apostles were patterns to be imitated by
those of <hi>Macedonia</hi> and <hi>Achaia</hi> as well as by those
of <hi>Thessalonica, v.</hi> 6. but the <hi>Thessalonians</hi> also are
held forth for ensamples to them: <hi>ye were en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>samples
to all that believe,</hi> &amp;c.</p>
               <q>Ver. 8. For from you sounded out the word of
the Lord, not only in Macedonia and Achaia, but
also in every place your faith to God-ward is spread
abroad, so that we need not to speak any thing.</q>
               <p>In this Verse he doth first clear what he spoke,
<hi>v.</hi> 7. by shewing how they became such imitable
patterns to their nearest Neighbours, to wit, because
the Gospel, here called <hi>the word of the Lord,</hi> as be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
revealed by him, and having the Lord Christ
for the main subject whereof it treateth, 1 <hi>Cor.
2.</hi> 2. because, I say, the Gospel was propagated
by them and sounded out from them as with the
noise of a Trumpet (for the word in the original
beareth so much) towards those Regions: which
must not be understood of the first publishing of
the Gospel in those places, it being clear that the
Gospel was Preached, at least in <hi>Philippi</hi> by <hi>Paul</hi>
himself, before that time, <hi>Act.</hi> 16. 12. but of a reite<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rated
report of it, which made the Gospel in a man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner
fresh and new unto them, because of these ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cellent
effects wrought upon the <hi>Thessalonians</hi> by
it, and reported of joyntly with it: which report
as it seemeth was carryed by those of <hi>Thessalo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nica,</hi>
                  <pb n="32" facs="tcp:61385:20"/>
who did usually traffick and keep commerce
in those Regions. Next he doth further amplifie
what he mentioned of the fruits of the Gospel
among them, <hi>v.</hi> 6. from that general fame of their
eminency in grace, and especially in the grace of
faith in God, which was spread abroad beyond the
confines of their nearest, neighbours, in Regions
where they themselves had no commerce, yea <hi>in
every place,</hi> to wit, where <hi>Paul</hi> did travel, as the
last clause of the verse doth clear, where he shew<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth
the fame of their graces was such in all these
places, that there was no necessity for him to speak
any thing, as to the giving of information; they
were already made so notorious unto all. <hi>Doct.</hi> 1.
It is the duty of all who live where the Gospel is
preached, to carry a good report of Christ and
the Gospel, both by their word and work, into all
places where they do resort, if so they may there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by
allure others with whom they converse to think
well of Christ, and embrace the Gospel, which
maketh an offer of him: for, the publishing of
the Gospel in <hi>Macedonia</hi> and <hi>Achaia,</hi> here spoken
of, was chiefly by means of such <hi>Thessalonians</hi> as
did tr<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>ffick in those places: <hi>for, from you sounded
out the Word of the Lord.</hi> 2. There is not any one
thing which maketh the Gospel sound louder, the
sound of it to be heard better, and its offer em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>braced
more readily, than when a sound profession
is beautified, adorned, and seconded by sober, sin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cere,
painful and conscientious practice: for, it was
such a profession seconded with such a practice in
these of <hi>Thessalonica,</hi> which made the Gospel
sound from them in <hi>Macedonia</hi> and <hi>Achaia:</hi> The
<pb n="33" facs="tcp:61385:20"/>
word signifies to sound shrill, and far, as with
the noise of a Trumpet, or voice of a Lyon-he<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rauld.
3. It tendeth much for giving credit to
the Gospel far and near, that great Cities and ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nourable
personages do once receive it; for, <hi>Thes<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>salonica</hi>
was the chief City in all <hi>Macedonia,</hi>
where were many women of credit and note, <hi>Act.
17.</hi> 4. and therefore upon their receiving the Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>spel,
the word of the Lord did sound out in all <hi>Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cedonia</hi>
and <hi>Achaia.</hi> 4. There is nothing more
ordinary for God, than to out-wit the Devil and his
most witty instruments, in so far as what is intend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
by them as the most probable mean to destroy the
Gospel, the Lord doth make it tend to the further
spreading of it: for, therefore doubtless did Satan
and his instruments raise so hot a persecution against
the Gospel in <hi>Thessalonica, chap.</hi> 2. 14. because they
thought the noise of that ill usage which the Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>spel
did meet with in that prime City, spreading
far and near, would scare others from embracing it,
and yet the Lord makes the very same thing, to
wit, the spreading report of the cruelty of persecu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tors,
together with the report of <hi>constancy in be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lievers,</hi>
a <hi>mean of spreading the Gospel far and
near.</hi> In every place, saith he, your faith to God<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward
is spread abroad. 5. Though the grace of
faith be rooted in the heart, and cannot be imme<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diately
seen, yet whereever it is, it cannot long be
hid, but needs must discover it self by the external
fruits, which follow upon it, and flow from it:
for, the fame of their faith did spread abroad by
manifesting it self in its fruits. 6. The Lord doth
give a name for faith and piety, beyond others,
<pb n="34" facs="tcp:61385:21"/>
unto some in mercy, that thereby they may be the
more ingaged unto perseverance and constancy, and
so to walk answerably unto their name, as knowing
that the more famous they are, the more will be ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pected
from them: for, he mentioneth this of the
general fame that was spread of their graces in all
the Churches, as a strong motive unto constancy,
which, as I shew, is the scope of all his purpose
in the first part of the Epistle. 7. It is a piece of
a Ministers duty, in relation to his flock, as to press
conscience making of duty upon them, 1 <hi>Tim.</hi> 6. 17.
rebuke them sometimes sharply, <hi>Tit.</hi> 1. 13. yea and
to complain of them, both to God and man for pal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pable
neglect of duty, <hi>Isa.</hi> 49. 4. So to commend
them also unto others, even to strangers, for the
good that is in them, that thereby they themselves
may be the more incouraged in their duty, <hi>Chap.
4.</hi> 9, 10. and others provoked to follow them in
that which is so praise-worthy, 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 9. 2. And
that God (the Author of all good, <hi>James 1. 17.)</hi>
may hereby get glory, 2 <hi>Cor. 8. 16, &amp;c.</hi> for, while
<hi>Paul</hi> sheweth he had not need to speak any thing
to the commendation of the <hi>Thessalonians,</hi> their
fame was spread so generally among the Churches,
he implyeth, it was his usual way whereever he
came, to commend the graces of God in such, among
whom his Ministry had been effectual.</p>
               <q>Ver. 9. For they themselves shew of us, what
manner of entring in we had unto you, and how
ye turned from God to Idols, to serve the living and
true God.</q>
               <p>
                  <pb n="35" facs="tcp:61385:21"/>
                  <hi>Paul</hi> doth here make the truth of what he pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sently
spoke appear, That the fame and report of
their graces was so generally spread in all places,
that he needed not speak any thing to their com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mendation:
And he makes it appear from this,
that they themselves, that is the forraign Churches
among whom he conversed, were able to give him
a perfect account of the Gospels progress among
the <hi>Thessalonians,</hi> and more particularly they did
give him an account of two things; The first re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lates
to <hi>Paul</hi> himself and his associates; to wit,
what manner of entrance they had to <hi>Thessalonica,</hi>
whereby he doth not mean, that either they had
entred that City, or were received by it, in any
great pomp or worldly state, The History <hi>Act. 17.
1, &amp;c.</hi> sheweth the contrary; But he thereby ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>presseth
their own ministerial carriage, and the
Lords countenancing of their Ministry among that
people, spoken of briefly, <hi>v.</hi> 5. and more largely,
<hi>Chap. 2. v.</hi> 1. to 13. The second thing whereof
those forraign Churches did give <hi>Paul</hi> an account,
relateth to the <hi>Thessalonians,</hi> and the fruit of <hi>Pauls</hi>
Ministry among them, to wit, 1. Of the work of
their conversion, and turning unto God from their
Idols, or false Gods, whom they did formerly wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ship;
which work of turning to God consists in
the exercise of faith and repentance, as appears
from <hi>Isa.</hi> 55. 2. with 7. where coming to God,
forsaking of sinful wayes, turning to the Lord, are
spoken of as expressing pieces and parts of one and
the same thing. 2. Of the sincerity of this work,
evidencing it self in a twofold end or fruit of their
conversion, the first whereof is in this verse, to
<pb n="36" facs="tcp:61385:22"/>
wit, their doing service to God set forth by two
epithets, to distinguish him from Idols. 1. He is
the living God, who hath life in himself, <hi>Joh.</hi> 1. 4.
and is the author and preserver of life unto others,
<hi>Act.</hi> 17. 28. in opposition to their dumb and life<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>less
Idols, as Sun, Moon and Stars, which the Gen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiles
worshipped, <hi>Psal. 135. 13, &amp;c.</hi> Next he is the
<hi>true</hi> God, The word in the Original doth not so
much express his fidelity and that truth, which he
sheweth in performing what he speaketh, (In which
respect he is also the true God, <hi>Mat. 5. 18.)</hi> as the
truth of his being and nature; he is really and
truly God, in opposition to another sort of Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>then
Idols, which though they were not lifeless as
the former, but possible men or spirits, yet they
were not true, or really Gods, but by nature no
Gods, <hi>Gal. 4. 8. Doct.</hi> 1. It is the duty of Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stians
to inform themselves, so far as possibly and
conveniently they may, how the work of God doth
thrive in forraign Churches, as being members of
the same body, 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 10. 17. and that thereby
they may have matter of rejoycing in God, <hi>Chap.
3.</hi> 6, 7. and imitation for themselves, 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 9. 2.
when things go well, and of fellow-feeling with
Christs afflicted members, <hi>Heb.</hi> 13. 3. and wrest<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling
with God on their behalf, <hi>Heb.</hi> 13. 18, 19.
when it is otherwayes: for believers far and near,
had informed themselves so well of the state of the
Church at <hi>Thessalonica,</hi> that they were able to give
<hi>Paul</hi> an account of it: <hi>for, they themselves shew of
us,</hi> saith he. 2. It is the duty of Christians, not
enviously to suppress, but cheerfully to publish the
deserved commendation of others, and the praise
<pb n="37" facs="tcp:61385:22"/>
of Gods glorious grace manifested to them beyond
their neighbours, even though we should thereby
seem to darken our own reputation being compared
with theirs: for, so did these other Churches cheer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fully
publish the deserved praises of the <hi>Thessaloni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans:
They themselves shew of us:</hi> The word sig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nifies
to declare a thing boldly, freely, and with
good will, as Ambassadours do return their answer
from forraign States. 3. Whatever praise-worthy
grace is among the Lords people, it is ordinarily
conveyed unto them from the Lord by means of a
publick Ministry, so that a people cannot well be
commended, except the Minister whom God hath
made instrumental for their good, be in some re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>spect
commended also; And therefore for a people
to boast of their graces received, and to trample un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derfoot
the reputation of a faithful Ministry, by
whose means they were bestowed, is most absurd,
and in point of reason inconsistent: for, those be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lievers
being to set forth the praises of the Church
at <hi>Thessalonica,</hi> begin with the commendation of
<hi>Paul</hi> and his associates, who were their Ministers
and by whose means they were converted. <hi>They
shew what manner of entring in we had unto you,
and how,</hi> to wit, by that mean ye turned to God.
4. As all men are by nature averse from God, with
their backs upon him, and full of enmity in all the
faculties of their soul, <hi>Rom.</hi> 8. 7. and members of
their body, against him, <hi>Rom. 6—19.</hi> So there is
alwayes somewhat which every man naturally is
turned unto, and doth set up to himself in Gods
stead, by giving unto it the chief and choice of his
affections, which are Gods due: for, while it is said
<pb n="38" facs="tcp:61385:23"/>
                  <hi>they turned to God from Idols,</hi> it implyeth that they
were turned away from God, and addicted to their
Idols. 5. Where ever the Gospel is powerfully
accompanied with the Lords blessing, to bring about
a work of saving grace in a sinner, there will be a
turning from, and abandoning of whatsoever did
keep that place in the heart which is due to God,
whether Idols properly so called, when Divine
Worship is purposely given to any thing, under
any respect, besides the true God, <hi>Exod.</hi> 32. 5, 6.
with 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 10. 7. or improperly, when, though
not the outward worship, yet the inward respect
and honour, such as the measure of love, joy, con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fidence,
or fear, due to God, is given to the Crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture,
whether it be a mans belly, <hi>Phil.</hi> 3. 19. or his
wealth, <hi>Eph.</hi> 5. 5. for, it was mentioned of these
<hi>Thessalonians,</hi> that they had <hi>turned from Idols,</hi> as a
fruit of the Gospel powerfully preached among
them. 6. It will not prove a powerful and gra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cious
work of the Gospel upon a mans heart that
he forsake his Idols, except he also turn to God,
and bestow upon him that inward respect, external
worship, pains and diligence, which he did for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>merly
give unto them; Otherwise, if he only turn
from a greater degree of Idolatry to a lesser, or
from all Idolatry to practical Atheism, or if he
quit a false Religion, and turn wholly irreligious
and a meer Nullifidian, he doth only change his
service but not his master, he serveth Satan and some
one or other of his own lusts still: for, it is men<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tioned
of them as an evidence of a gracious work
among them, they had <hi>turned from Idols</hi> to God.
7. Though the Lord alone, without any actual
<pb n="39" facs="tcp:61385:23"/>
concurrence of our free-will, doth at first regene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rate
us, by creating gracious habits and principles
of a new life in us, <hi>Ezek.</hi> 36. 26. (who then are
dead in sins and trespasses, <hi>Eph.</hi> 2. 1. and conse<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quently
can contribute nothing towards our own
quickning) yet in the after progress of the work
of grace, we are not wholly patients, but from a
principle of Grace in us, 2 <hi>Tim.</hi> 1. 6. we do also
work, being first acted and wrought upon by God,
<hi>Cant.</hi> 4. 16. for, saith he, <hi>ye had turned to God.</hi>
The word is of an active signification. 8. Then
doth a sinner turn sincerely from sin to God, when
he devotes himself wholly to God as his Lord and
soveraign, to do him worship and service according
to the prescript of his word, <hi>Matth.</hi> 5. 9. Idle slug<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gards
have not sincerely turned to God: for, as a
mark of their sincerity in turning, it is mentioned,
they turned to God <hi>to serve the true and living
God.</hi> 9. In our doing service to God, we should
carefully labour to take him up in those his Divine
properties and glorious attributes, by which he
hath made himself known to us in his word, that so
the known worth of him whom we do serve, may
make his service lovely, and our service given unto
him to be acceped of by him, as being performed to
that God whom Scripture revealeth to be God, and
not a to mishapen deity or fancy of our own brains:
for, it is mentioned of them in their giving service
to God, they took him up as the <hi>living and true
God,</hi> to hearten them in his service, and to distin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guish
him from dead Idols and false Gods: <hi>To serve
the living and true God.</hi>
               </p>
               <pb n="40" facs="tcp:61385:24"/>
               <q>Ver. 10. And to wait for his Son from Heaven,
whom he raised from the dead, even Jesus which
delivered us from the wrath to come.</q>
               <p>Here is a second thing wherein the sincerity of
their conversion did make it self evident, which is
first propounded, to wit, their patient waiting for,
and hopeful expectation of, the eternal Son of the
eternal Father, his second coming from Heaven to
Judgement. 2. The grounds of this their hope and
expectation are unfolded, in a description of Christ;
first, From his Resurrection from the dead, by the
power of the Father, so that though he was once
dead, he is now alive; And therefore their waiting
for his second coming was not without ground.
2. From his Office, whereby, as in the mean time
he doth deliver in part, so at his second coming he
shall compleatly deliver <hi>us,</hi> saith <hi>Paul,</hi> that is, all
sincere believers (as he was) from the wrath to
come, that is, the punishment, woe and vengeance
due to all mankind for sin, <hi>Eph. 2—3.</hi> and
which he shall fully execute at the last day upon all
unbelievers, 2 <hi>Thes.</hi> 1. 7, 8, 9. and therefore they,
to wit, believers, had good ground to expect his se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cond
coming, and good by his coming. Hence learn,
first, several marks of sound conversion, or of a
sincere convert. 1. He doth so turn to God and
give him service, as he looks upon God with an
eye to Christ, whom he serveth equally with the
Father, and through whom he approacheth to the
Father, <hi>Joh.</hi> 14. 6. as to a God reconciled, whose
Justice is satisfied and his wrath appeased through
<pb n="41" facs="tcp:61385:24"/>
him, <hi>Matth.</hi> 3. 17. for, it is mentioned as a mark
of the sincerity of their conversion, that as they
turned to serve God the Father, <hi>v.</hi> 9. so they also
gave divine honour to his Son, by hoping in him,
waiting for him, and looking to him as an interpo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ser
betwixt them and the dint of Gods deserved
wrath: They <hi>turned to wait for his Son—which
delivered us from the wrath to come.</hi> 2. A sincere
convert doth turn to God to give him service not
for a start, and season only, with a purpose to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turn
to his Idols, when he pleaseth, but to continue
constant in his service so long as he liveth, and ever
while Christ come to loose him from it: for, the
word rendred <hi>to wait,</hi> signifieth to remain constant,
and so doth point at their patient continuance in
the service of God. 3. A sincere convert can
never rest satisfied with his present receipts, or with
any thing he can enjoy upon earth, his expectation
and hopes do carry him beyond time, to look for
Heaven, for Glory, a life of light, and joy to be be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stowed
upon him by Christ, when he cometh to
judge the world: for, waiting for Christs second
coming is mentioned as a fruit and consequence of
their sincere conversion: <hi>And to wait for his Son.</hi>
4. A sincere convert is one to whom (especially
when in a right temper) Christs second coming
(although it be abhorred by wicked Atheists, <hi>Act.
24.</hi> 25. yet) is not terrible, but a thing hoped for,
and much longed after: for, they <hi>turned to wait
for his Son.</hi> 5. A sincere convert will not (when
in a right temper) quarrel with God, because his
promises want a fixed date, or, their performance
is delayed, but makes it his work to keep himself
<pb n="42" facs="tcp:61385:25"/>
constantly in a suitable frame, as if they were to be
performed presently, and yet to wait upon Gods
leisure with contentment until his time come to per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>form
what he hath promised; for, their waiting on
Christs second coming implyeth both these, a keep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
of themselves in a posture ready for it, and a
patient on-waiting on Gods leisure so long as it is
delayed: <hi>And to wait for his Son.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Secondly,</hi> We may <hi>learn</hi> hence, divers doctrinal
truths concerning Christ wherein the Apostle had
doubtless instructed the <hi>Thessalonians</hi> at greater
length, but doth now propound them in most won<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derful
brevity, As, 1. That Jesus Christ is true
God: for, he calls him the Son of the Father, and
therefore of the same substance with him, even God
himself: <hi>To wait for the Son of God.</hi> 2. He is
also man: for, it is implyed he was once dead, and
therefore he behoved to be also man, <hi>whom he raised
from the dead.</hi> 3. Though he have two Natures,
yet he is but one person: for, he speaks of the Son
of God and him who was dead, not as of two, but
as of one and the same: <hi>for his Son whom he raised
from the dead.</hi> 4. Jesus Christ at his Fathers ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pointment,
<hi>Psal.</hi> 40. hath undertaken to be a Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viour,
Redeemer, and Deliverer of the Elect from
that wrath which is due to them for sin: for, there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
is he called <hi>Jesus,</hi> which signifies a Saviour,
<hi>Matth.</hi> 1. 21. and is said <hi>to deliver us from the
wrath to come.</hi> 5. Jesus Christ the Lord of life
did give himself to death, thereby to satisfie pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>voked
justice for the sins of the Elect: for, it is
implyed he was dead, while it is said, <hi>whom he raised
from the dead.</hi> 6. Jesus Christ having satisfied
<pb n="43" facs="tcp:61385:25"/>
the Fathers justice by his death, was loosed out of
prison, raised up from death, and absolved by the
Father, as having performed all he undertook: for,
<hi>he raised him from the dead.</hi> 7. Jesus Christ after
his Resurrection did ascend to Heaven, to take pos<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>session
of it in name of the Elect, <hi>Eph.</hi> 2. and to
make application unto the elect of all these good
things which he had purchased by his death, <hi>Act.
5.</hi> 31. for, that they looked for him <hi>from Heaven,</hi>
saith he is there, and consequently that he ascended
thither. 8. Jesus Christ in his bodily presence doth
now reside in Heaven, and not upon earth; for,
there he resides whence he is expected to come:
<hi>And to wait for his Son from Heaven.</hi> 9. As
Jesus Christ did deliver the elect from the wrath to
come, by paying of a sufficient ransome to provoked
Justice in his death: So he is carrying on, while he
is now in Heaven, the work of their delivery to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards
perfection, by making application of the
redemption purchased, both to pardon sin in its
guilt, and to subdue sin in its strength, <hi>Act.</hi> 5. 31.
for, the word <hi>delivered</hi> in the Original, may be
read in the present time, as well as the preterit, <hi>who
delivereth us.</hi> 10. Jesus Christ shall again return
from Heaven, and come to Earth at the last day,
to judge the quick and the dead, 2 <hi>Tim.</hi> 4. 1. for,
his coming is waited for by believers, and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
it must be: <hi>to wait</hi> for his coming. 11. Then,
and at that time, shall Jesus Christ compleat the
work of the Elects delivery, from that wrath to
come, by acquitting them openly, and pronouncing,
as their Judge, that blessed sentence, <hi>come ye blessed
of my Father,</hi> Matth. 25. for, so much is implyed,
<pb n="44" facs="tcp:61385:26"/>
while his delivering of us from the wrath to come
is annexed to his second coming: <hi>Look for his
Son—who delivered, or delivereth us from the
wrath to come.</hi> 12. Jesus Christ the Judge shall
not then acquit or deliver all from that wrath, but
only such who here have lived by faith, and fled to
him for a refuge, and laid hold upon the ransome
payed by him: for, saith he, who delivereth <hi>us,</hi> to
wit <hi>Paul</hi> with the believing <hi>Thessalonians,</hi> and such
believers as they were, leaving all others to drink
the dregs of that most bitter Cup of Gods unmix<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
wrath for ever and ever, <hi>Joh.</hi> 3. 36.</p>

constancy and perseverance, by a
relation of his Ministerial carriage
to <hi>ver.</hi> 13. and of the success of his

which he doth summarily propone, <hi>viz.</hi> that his en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trance

proveth: 1. From his holy boldness, to Preach

colours, <hi>ver.</hi> 15, 16. In the second part of the
Chapter he doth further pursue his main scope, by
convincing them of his intimate affection to them,
while he excuseth his long absence from them, first,
from his earnest desire and purpose he had to see
them, <hi>ver.</hi> 17. Secondly, from his reiterated en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terprize
to fulfil his purpose, wherein Satan had

               <p>The Apostle being, in order to the further incite<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
of these Thessalonians unto constancy in the
doctrine received, to put them in mind of the dig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity
of his Ministry, and of his own sincerity in the
discharge of it among them, doth here propone a
brief sum of all he hath to say to that purpose, to
wit, <hi>that his entrance in unto them,</hi> that is, his un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dertaking
of that employment to Preach the Gospel
among them, and his carriage in that employment,
<hi>was not in vain,</hi> That is, was not, 1. rashly under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taken,
without a call from God, nor 2. discharged
by him perfunctoriously, or in a vain shew, but in
sincerity: Nor yet 3. was it without fruit among
them; for the following purpose, which serveth as
a commentary to this verse, doth shew that the
vanity which he removes from his entrance to
them must be extended to all those: Besides the
force of the word will bear so much, that being a
vain thing, or done vainly, which is done rashly
or without a warrant from God, which is done with
more of vain shew than of real solidity and since<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity,
and which being done hath no effect or fruit.
And for the truth of this assertion he appeals to their
own conscience and knowledge, and thereby doth
also confirm the truth of that report, which he shew<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
<hi>Chap.</hi> 1. 9. was spread among the forreign Chur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ches
concerning his manner of entring in unto
them, as appears from the causal particle <hi>for.</hi>
                  <pb n="47" facs="tcp:61385:27"/>
Hence <hi>Learn,</hi> 1. This may, and in reason should,
commend the love of truth unto a people, and make
them constantly cleave unto it, that truth hath been
preached unto them by Ministers sent from God
for that very end, whose life and practice have
preached unto them as well as their doctrine, and
whose pains and travel hath been blessed of God
among them, to their own discerning: for, the
Apostles scope in this first part of the Chapter, by
a narration of his call from God to preach unto
them, of his Ministerial carriage among them, and
of the fruits of his labours towards them, is to incite
them to constancy and perseverance in the doctrine
received. 2. That others do report well of us,
and that our name, and fame, for the graces of God
bestowed upon us, be fragrant among many, is then
a mercy when our own Consciences can bear testi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mony
that there is some ground and reason for it;
otherwise to have a name that we are living and yet
be dead, increaseth our guilt, and proveth a snare,
<hi>Rev.</hi> 3. 1. for, the Apostle, having shewn <hi>chap. 1.
v.</hi> 8. how well they were reported of by forreign
Churches, doth here imply that they themselves
knew there was reason for it: <hi>for your selves know,</hi>
&amp;c. 3. It is not enough that a Minister be well
reported of among strangers for sincerity and di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligence,
except he do approve himself to the Consci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ences
of his hearers, so as he may appeal to them for
the truth of what strangers do report of him: for,
<hi>Paul</hi> appeals to the <hi>Thessalonians</hi> themselves about
the truth of that which forreign Churches report<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
of his entry unto them: <hi>for your selves know
our entrance in unto you.</hi> 4. Where a Minister is
<pb n="48" facs="tcp:61385:28"/>
called of God, and carryeth himself sincerely and
faithfully in his calling, his Preaching and other
pains do very rarely, if ever, want fruit, either
sooner or latter, <hi>Joh.</hi> 4. 37, 38. either manifest or
secret, <hi>Joh.</hi> 14. 42. for, <hi>Pauls entrance unto them
was not in vain;</hi> that is, as was exponed, not
without a call from God, not in vain shew, and
without sincerity and diligence, and therefore it
was not in vain, without fruit.</p>
               <q>Ver. 2. But even after that we had suffered before,
and were shamefully intreated, as ye know, at
Philippi, we were bold in our God to speak unto
you the Gospel of God with much contention.</q>
               <p>He doth here prove his entrance was not in vain,
mainly as to the first thing (though not excluding
the other two), which I shew was pointed at in
that expression, to wit, that his undertaking of that
employment was not rashly, but at Gods appoint<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment.
One convincing evidence whereof was that
he ventured upon it over the belly of such discou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ragements
and disadvantages, as no wise man with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out
a call from God would ever have set his face
against. And first, he mentions what sufferings in
his body, and disgraceful injuries against his repu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation
and credit, he had sustained for Preaching
the Gospel a little before he came to them, as they
themselves knew, in their neighbouring City of
<hi>Philippi,</hi> where he was most injuriously and shame<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fully
used: See <hi>Act.</hi> 16. 22, 23, 24. And next he
shews that all his sufferings of that sort were so
far from making him shrink, that notwithstanding
<pb n="49" facs="tcp:61385:28"/>
them all, he took the boldness, being furnished
thereunto by Gods grace and assistance, (and
therefore it is called <hi>a boldness in God)</hi> to Preach
the Gospel publickly, concealing no necessary truth,
without all base fear of flesh (as the word rendred
<hi>we were bold</hi> doth imply) and that in <hi>Thessalonica,</hi>
the prime City of all <hi>Macedonia,</hi> where were most
Jews, enemies to the Gospel, and therefore he
might in all probability have expected to incur as
much hazard there as in any place else, which the
event did verifie, for as he shews in the close of the
verse, he Preached there with much contention, the
word signifieth combating or fighting, to wit, both
by disputing with, and suffering from his malicious
opposites, which contention, together with his
boldness here spoken of, is clearly held forth, <hi>Act.
17.</hi> from <hi>v.</hi> 1. to 10. <hi>Doct.</hi> 1. Though a mans
couragious venturing upon probable or certain suf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferings
doth not it self alone prove his doctrine to
be truth, or his calling from God to Preach that
doctrine, <hi>Matth.</hi> 23. 15. yet, when other more
firm arguments are not wanting, taken from the
Doctrine it self, the mans Ministerial carriage, the
success of his pains among the Lords people, that
other taken from his constancy and courage in suf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fering,
joyned with them doth not want its own
weight: for, <hi>Paul</hi> joyneth this of his courage in
suffering with other arguments which follow, to
prove his entrance was not in vain, that is, his
doctrine and calling were from God: <hi>But even af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
that we had suffered before, we were bold,</hi> &amp;c.
2. That a Ministers pains may not be without fruit,
and in that respect vain among a people, he should
<pb n="50" facs="tcp:61385:29"/>
make Conscience to deliver his message with free<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom
and boldness, so as he omit no necessary truth
for fear of flesh, <hi>Act.</hi> 20. 20. and in an autho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritative
way make through application of general
truths (by rebuking, comforting, exhorting, re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proving)
to the several ranks of hearers, 2 <hi>Tim.</hi> 4. 2.
without which a mans Ministry doth for the most
part prove but coldryf, dead and lifeless: for, the
Apostle mentions this of his boldness to speak, or
freedom and boldness which he used in speaking;
as a reason why his entrance was not in vain or
without success: <hi>But—we were bold in our
God to speak.</hi> 3. As a suffering lot doth usually
attend sincere and faithful Ministers; So it often
falls out that they meet with most of trouble and
suffering at the close of some notable piece of ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vice
done to their master Christ; Satans malice is
hereby more provoked, <hi>Act.</hi> 16. 18, 19. and God
giveth way to his malice then, to teach his servants
that their reward is not to be expected here, <hi>Act.
14.</hi> 19. with 22. and to divert them, by this hum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bling
exercise, from being transported with lofty
thoughts of themselves, arising from their great
success, 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 12. 7. for, <hi>Paul</hi> did <hi>suffer</hi> much,
and was <hi>shamefully intreated at Philippi,</hi> immedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ately
after he had erected a Throne and Church for
Christ in that place, <hi>Act.</hi> 16. 12. with 19.
4. Where Grace is lively and vigorous, or where
habitual grace is quickned by present influence from
God, and when duty is sweetned by the faith of an
interest in God who doth enjoyn it, afflictions,
crosses and sufferings for well doing will be so far
from quenching zeal, that they will rather inflame
<pb n="51" facs="tcp:61385:29"/>
it: for, though <hi>Paul</hi> had suffered much before in
<hi>Philippi,</hi> yet he was bold to Preach at <hi>Thessalonica;</hi>
being assisted by God, and having his interest in
God as his own made clear, which is pointed at
in the expression, <hi>we were bold in our God.</hi> 5. A
Minister or any other should so commend himself,
and the good that is in him or done by him, when
necessity puts him to it, 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 12. 11. as that he
make the result of all to be his ascribing the praise
and glory of all unto God: for, <hi>Paul</hi> doth so com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mend
his own courage and boldness, as he gives
God the praise of it: <hi>we were bold in our God,</hi> or
by the help and assistance of our God. 6. Trouble
and tryal bypast doth not exempt from trouble in
time to come. Every new duty almost is attended
with some new tryal and difficulty, (See the rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sons
upon Doct. 3.) for, though <hi>Paul</hi> had suffered
much a little before at <hi>Philippi,</hi> yet he meets with
new troubles here: <hi>to speak unto you the Gospel of
God with much contention.</hi>
               </p>
               <q>Ver. 3. For our exhortation was not of deceit, nor
of uncleanness, nor in guile.</q>
               <p>He adds a second argument to prove his entrance
was not in vain, mainly, as to the second thing I
shewed was pointed at by that expression, to wit, that
he did not discharge the imployment of Preaching
the Gospel among them perfunctoriously, or in a
vain shew, as seeming to do much, but in effect doing
nothing. And that his entrance was not so in vain,
he proveth, both from the sincerity of the doctrine
preached, and of his own heart in Preaching it:
<pb n="52" facs="tcp:61385:30"/>
where first, he calls his Preaching of the Gospel his
exhortation, not only because his doctrine was
consolatory to the afflicted (for the word signifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth
also consolation) but also, and mainly, because
all his Preaching did end in pithy application by ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>horting
them earnestly, humbly, and affectionately
(as the word also doth bear) to cleave and wal<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>
according to the truths, whether doctrinal or pra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctical,
which were delivered by him<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap> Next he re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moves
from his Preaching three opposites of since<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity,
the first two whereof point at the sincerity
and incorruptness of his doctrine. 1. It was
not <hi>of deceit,</hi> or of insnaring and seducing errour,
as the word signifieth, that is, It was not fitted to
the corrupt opinions of men, as the Preaching of
the false Apostles was, who mingled the Law with
the Gospel, to eschew the hatred of the Jews, <hi>Gal.
5.</hi> 11. 2. It was not <hi>of uncleanness,</hi> that is, it was
not fitted to countenance men in their vice and fil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thy
lusts, as the preaching of the false Apostles was,
<hi>Jude v. 10, &amp;c.</hi> The third doth point at the sin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerity
of his own heart in Preaching, his exhorta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
was not <hi>in guile,</hi> that is, he did not deceitfully
seek his own worldly advantage from them, under
a pretext of seeking Gods glory in their salvation,
as he more fully declares, v. 5, 6. <hi>Doct.</hi> 1. It is
sincerity and faithfulness in a Ministers carriage that
breeds him much trouble, strife and suffering from
his carnal hearers, who cannot well comport with
Ministers, except they so preach as to please their
humour: for, the purpose of this verse, holding
forth <hi>Pauls</hi> sincerity, may be lookt upon as the oc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>casion
of his trouble spoken of, v. 2. <hi>for our exhor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation
<pb n="53" facs="tcp:61385:30"/>
was not of deceit.</hi> 2. The most effectual
way to convince others of sin who are guilty, or at
least to render them inexcusable, is to make our
carriage reprove them, by holding forth in our life
and practice a lively coppy of such vertues as are
contrary to their vices: The voice of a mans work
doth pass further than of his word: for, it may be
very probably conceived that the Apostle in avow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
his sincerity, and purging himself of the vices
mentioned here, and in the verses following, hath an
eye to the false teachers, who were guilty of these
evils, and whom he doth hereby reprove: <hi>for our
exhortation was not of deceit.</hi> 3. It's inexcusable
boldness, daring presumption, and such as argues
him, who is guilty of it, an unsincere, rotten-heart<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
hypocrite, when a man doth purposely wrest the
word of truth, to give some seeming countenance
unto the erroneous opinions, or loose licentious pra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctises
of such whose hatred he would decline, and
whose favour he would gain: for, to prove that his
entrance was not in vain, or his carriage was not
unsincere, he saith, <hi>his exhortation was not of deceit
or of uncleanness,</hi> implying, if it had been so, he
would have been a gross hypocrite. 4. When a man
doth bend his wit to patronize errour in opinion,
he will at last prove no great unfriend, but a secret
favourer of profanity and vice: for, so much is im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plyed,
that if his exhortation had been of <hi>deceit,</hi> it
would have been <hi>of uncleanness</hi> also. 5. It is not
sufficient that a Minister do not wrest truth, but
Preach the sincere word without mixture, except
he also Preach it sincerely, with a single eye to
Gods honour, and the salvation of his people, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out
<pb n="54" facs="tcp:61385:31"/>
any allowed to-look towards base or by-ends:
for, <hi>Paul</hi> thinks it not enough to remove corrupt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness
from his doctrine, except he also purge himself
of insincerity in the delivery of it, while he saith,
<hi>not in guile.</hi>
               </p>
               <q>Ver. 4. But as we were allowed of God to be put
in trust with the Gospel, even so we speak; not
as pleasing men, but God, who trieth our hearts.</q>
               <p>The Apostle having removed from himself the op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>posites
of sincerity, <hi>v.</hi> 3. doth here positively af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firm,
that his behaviour in his Ministry was sin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cere,
whereof he gives this one instance, That his
design in Preaching, and in all the other pieces of
his Ministerial employment, was never to please
the sinful humours of men, but to approve himself
unto God, and to be approved of him: And he gives
two reasons inducing him thereto. 1. The consi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deration
of that rich favour, and the conscience of
that great trust put on him by God, who having
<hi>allowed</hi> him, or approved and judged him fit, as the
word signifieth, did intrust him with the Gospel,
or concredit the publick dispensing of it unto him.
2. The consideration of Gods omniscience, who
knows the heart, <hi>Jer.</hi> 17. 10. makes enquiry into
the heart and passeth sentence upon men according
to their heart, 1 <hi>Sam. 16. 27. Doct.</hi> 1. The sin of
man-pleasing cannot stand with sincerity and pleasing
of God in any man, and least of all in a Minister:
(See in what respects a Minister should and may
please man without sin, and in what respects not,
upon <hi>Gal. 1. 10. doct. 6.)</hi> for, he gives that as an
<pb n="55" facs="tcp:61385:31"/>
instance of his sincerity, and study to please the
Lord, he <hi>spoke not as pleasing men but God.</hi> 2. It
is one of Satans great designs, to possess the minds
of people against the most faithful of Christs ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vants,
with strong suspicions that though there be
nothing blame-worthy in their external walk, they
may yet be guilty of inward abominations, as of
pride, hypocrisie, covetousness, unstreightness, and
such like, because he knows that as nothing marreth
the edification of people more than rooted preju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dices
of that kind against their Ministers, So that
though honest Ministers may justly deny the charge,
yet they cannot so easily demonstrate to the pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>judged
party their own freedom from the guilt
charged, there being alwayes somewhat in the best
actions of most innocent men that may by an uncha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritable
and prejudged on-looker be constructed to
spring from some of those bitter roots; and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
the servant of Christ should labour not only
to keep himself free of those evils, but also from
doing any thing which may savour of them, or
give unto people any just occasion to conceive that
he is tainted with them: for, <hi>Pauls</hi> clearing him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>self
of those inward abominations, here and in the
preceding and following verses, implyeth that some
did suspect him guilty, and that he walked so as
he might justly clear himself that he was free of
them, <hi>even so we speak, not as pleasing men.</hi>
3. Then do we walk sincerely, when, as in
every other thing, so especially, in the duties of
our particular calling we labour to please, and to
approve our selves unto the Lord, to wit, by doing
not only what he commands, <hi>Rom.</hi> 12. 2. but also
<pb n="56" facs="tcp:61385:32"/>
in the manner which he prescribes, 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 10. 31.
and especially, by seeking after and resting satisfied
with his approbation of what we do for matter
and manner, without stepping one hair breadth off
the road way of duty, for catching applause or ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>probation
of man: for, <hi>Paul</hi> gives this as an in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stance
of his sincerity, that, in the duties of his
particular calling as a Minister, he did labour to
please God, or approve himself unto him: <hi>even so
we speak; not as pleasing men but God.</hi> 4. As
the ministerial calling is of any other the greatest
trust, there being no less concredited to the person
imployed in it than the Gospel of Christ, and the
souls of his people, <hi>Heb.</hi> 13. 17. so none should
be intrusted with that weighty charge, but such as
after tryal are found in some tolerable measure fit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted
for it: for, <hi>Paul</hi> sheweth he was, when made
a Minister, <hi>put in trust with the Gospel,</hi> and this
after he was <hi>allowed</hi> of God, the word signifieth
proved and judged fit, which implyeth not that he
had any fitness of himself, but the Lord, of unfit,
did make him fit, <hi>Gal.</hi> 1. 18. and did then intrust
him with the Gospel. 5. There is not any thing
prevails more strongly with an ingenuous and gra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cious
heart to make him in all things please the
Lord, than the serious remembrance of his rich
receipts from him, and how much he stands a debtor
to Gods free grace and favour on that account: for,
<hi>Paul</hi> makes the mercy manifested by God in making
him a Minister, a reason why he studied in all
things to please him: <hi>But as we were allowed of
God to be put in trust with the Gospel, even so we
speak.</hi> 6. It is a speaking evidence of a Ministers
<pb n="57" facs="tcp:61385:32"/>
call from God, when the conscience of his calling
prevaileth with him to order himself in all the
pieces of his imployment, both for matter and man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner,
as that he may approve himself to God who
hath called him: for, the conscience of <hi>Pauls</hi> calling
prevailed so with him: <hi>as we were allowed to be
put in trust—even so we speak not as pleas<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
men, but God.</hi> 7. As God who knoweth the
heart doth chiefly judge of mans actions according
to that frame of heart wherewith he doth discharge
them; So then do we know and believe that it is so,
when our faith and knowledge of it doth make us
in all our actions take such inspection of the heart,
as that for our inward sincerity we may approve
our selves unto him who tryeth our hearts: for,
the knowledge of this truth did so work upon <hi>Paul,</hi>
while he saith, <hi>we speak as pleasing God, who try<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth
the hearts.</hi>
               </p>
               <q>Ver. 5. For neither at anytime used we flattering
words, as ye know, nor a cloak of covetousness,
God is witness.</q>
               <p>The Apostle doth here remove from himself and
his Ministry two other vices, which are inconsistent
with that single hearted sincerity that ought to be
in a Minister; and hereby doth also meet with the
false Apostles, who were tainted with the vices fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowing:
first, he used not <hi>flattering words,</hi> that is,
speeches fitted to please the carnal corrupt humours
of men, for gaining of favour or some reward
from them: The word in the original is taken from
another, which signifieth meat, implying, that
<pb n="58" facs="tcp:61385:33"/>
flattery is a base belli-god vice, whereby the flat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terer
becomes a slave to every bodies humour for
a piece of bread: And for his freedom from this
vice, he appealeth to their own knowledge, who
might easily judge of his words, whether they were
flattering or not. 2. He used not <hi>a cloak,</hi> or pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>text,
<hi>of covetousness,</hi> that is, neither was he avow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>edly
covetous, or inordinately desirous of worldly
gain, neither did he make a scug, pretext, or cloak
of piety, or of any laudable vertue to cover any
such covetous desire, as the false Apostles did, <hi>Rom.
16.</hi> 18. And because men could not so well judge
of his freedom from this sin as from the former,
seeing it is usually hid under some specious pretext,
therefore he appealeth unto God to judge, and bear
witness, whether he spoke truth or not. <hi>Doct.</hi> 1.
The sin of flattery, at least when given way to and
allowed, cannot consist with the Grace of sincerity
(as in no man so much less) in a Minister: where
a man inslaveth himself to please the sinful humours
of people, and upon any terms not to irritate them,
he will not spare to wrest the truth of God to
make it subservient to his base design, by strength<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning
the hands of the wicked and promising him life,
<hi>Ezek.</hi> 13. 22. for, <hi>Paul</hi> denyeth that he used flat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tering
words, as inconsistent with that sincerity
formerly spoken of, which appears by the causal
particle <hi>for: for, neither at any time used we flat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tering
words.</hi> 2. Though flatterers be deep dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>semblers,
and bend their wit to make all men believe
they respect and love them, when they but seek to
prey upon them, <hi>Prov.</hi> 29. 5. yet a man of under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>standing
will easily discern them: And it argues
<pb facs="tcp:61385:33"/>
                  <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="2 letters">

                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>
not, but taketh foulest flatteries for real praises:
for, while he appealeth to themselves to judge if
he used flattering words, he implyeth they might
easily have discerned his flattery, if he had been
guilty of it: <hi>for, neither used we flattering words,
as ye know.</hi> 3. There is not any sin more unbe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>seeming
to, nor inconsistent with sincerity in,
a Minister, than the sin of covetousness. The man
who is enslaved to it will make his gain of all things,
if it were by making merchandise of Christ him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>self,
<hi>Matth.</hi> 26. 15. of truth, 1. <hi>Tim.</hi> 6. 10. and
of a good conscience, <hi>Micah</hi> 2. 2. for, <hi>Paul</hi> doth
clear himself of covetousness, as inconsistent with
that sincerity formerly spoken of: <hi>for neither used
I—a cloak of covetousness.</hi> 4. The sins of flat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tery
and covetousness go oft together, The covetous
wretch is of such a servile temper, as to make his
tongue a Trumpet to sound out the praises of all
by whom he may have the least advantage, even
though he know there be no real worth in the per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son
whom he so commends: for, <hi>Paul</hi> insinuates
so much while he purgeth himself from both these
vices joyntly: <hi>for neither at any time used we flat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tering
words, nor a cloak of Covetousness.</hi>

he used not covetousness, but <hi>a cloak</hi> of Covetous<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness,
Because it is often coloured over with some
Pretext. 6. Though fair pretences may cover
foulest sins from the eyes of men, yet not from the
eyes of God, in whose sight all things are naked
and uncovered; He not only perceives the sin which
lyeth hid from man under a specious pretext, but
doth so much the more detest it that it dare dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guise
it self and appear in a pious dress: for, his
appealing unto God to judge if he used a cloak of
covetousness, implyeth, that no cloak or pretext
could hide his sin from the eye of God: <hi>God is
witness.</hi> 7. That Christians under the New Te<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stament

see upon <hi>Gal. 1. 20. Doct. 3. for, God is

you, nor yet of others, when we might have been
burthensome, as the Apostles of Christ.</q>
               <p>He doth here remove another vice from himself
and his Ministry, to wit, his seeking of glory:
whereby is meant, 1. more generally his affecting
even of that glory and respect which was due unto
him. And 2. more particularly, which agreeth
best with the latter part of the verse, a rigid exact<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
of honourable maintenance, which goeth under
the name of <hi>glory,</hi> because it was a just testimony
of his honour and dignity, and an acknowledgement
of his superiority over the people, <hi>Heb.</hi> 7. 4. And
first, that he may purge himself both from ambition
<pb n="61" facs="tcp:61385:34"/>
and greediness, he denyeth that he was guilty of
seeking glory, in either of those respects, whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
from them, or from any other, while he was
with them; for though he received maintenance
from the <hi>Philippians,</hi> even while he was at <hi>Thes<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>salonica,</hi>
yet he did not rigidly nor covetously urge
it, <hi>Phil.</hi> 4. 16, 17. Next, he amplifieth his free<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom
from those two vices by this, that as to the
point, especially, of his not pressing upon them for
honourable maintenance, he did thereby remit of
his right, seeing <hi>as an Apostle of Christ,</hi> or, by ver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tue
of his Apostolick office, he might have been
<hi>burthensome</hi> and chargeable unto them, to wit, by
exacting maintenance from them, for the same
word is rendred chargeable, and made use of in this
sense, <hi>v. 9. Doct.</hi> 1. As we are not bound to reject
that lawful respect and reverence which is due to
vertue, and to those who are indued with it, where
we have the offer of it; So for a man to hunt after
respect and esteem, as his main design, or to seek
it eagerly, doth favour of vanity, and should be
far, especially from a Minister, as he would not
be found in the least to seek himself more than
Gods honour, and the good of souls: for, he saith
not, he did not receive glory, only he did not seek
it: <hi>nor of men sought we glory.</hi> 2. The sin of
covetousness consists not only in our seeking more
of things worldly than we have a right unto, but
sometimes also in a rigid exacting of that which
is our right; and this especially in a Minister,
when his so doing may prove a stumbling block
unto others, and one way or other ma<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

                  </gap> the pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gress
of the Gospel among a people: for, though
<pb n="62" facs="tcp:61385:35"/>
                  <hi>Paul</hi> had a right, as he here doth shew, unto ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nourable
maintenance, yet he did not exact it, lest
it should have marred the Gospels progess, 1 <hi>Cor.
9.</hi> 12. and this he gives as an evidence of his free<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom
from covetousness: <hi>nor of men sought we glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry—when
we might have been burthensome.</hi>
3. That worldly maintenance is due from a people
unto Ministers, See upon <hi>Gal. 6. 6. Doct.</hi> 4. and
here the Apostle doth assert it, while he saith, <hi>when
we might have been burthensome as the Apostles of
Christ.</hi> 4. It is not enough to know what lawfully
may be done, except we also consider what, in re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>spect
of circumstances, is convenient to be done:
Circumstances do alter much the nature of an acti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on,
and make that which is in it self lawful to prove
unlawful, at least inconvenient, and so sinful at such
a time: for, the Apostle knew it was lawful to
exact his maintenance, yet finding it was not con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venient
in that time and place, he doth forbear:
<hi>nor of men sought we glory, when we might have
been burthensome,</hi> &amp;c.</p>
               <q>Ver. 7. But we were gentle among you, even as a
nurse cherisheth her Children.</q>
               <p>The Apostle having already commended his Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nisterial
carriage among them, by avowing his
freedom from such vices as are inconsistent with
that single hearted sincerity which ought to be in a
Minister, he doth now begin to commend it fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther,
by condescending upon some vertues, the ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ercise
whereof was eminent in him. And first, in
general, he sheweth that he was <hi>gentle,</hi> that is, of a
<pb n="63" facs="tcp:61385:35"/>
me<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>k and amiable deportment, doing all duties to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward
them from a principle of love and delight (as
some derive the word in the original from another
which signifieth delight) and drawing them on to
do what he required, not so much by rigid boast<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
and constraint, as by meek perswasion and
word-speaking (for-the word comes from another
which signifieth to speak) and he saith he was <hi>gen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle
among them,</hi> whereby he shews he carried him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>self
not as a superiour, but as an equal, as one of
them, and to all of them, and in the midst of them
as the word signifieth. And in the latter part of
the verse he illustrates this his gentleness and meek<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness,
from the tender affection and care, not of a
mercenary nurse, but a nursing mother, who dimits
her self to the meanest and basest of offices, for the
more warm and tender education of her children.
The grounds of which similitude are in the fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowing
verses. <hi>Doct.</hi> 1. It is not enough that a
Minister of Christ abstain from such scandalous sins
of flattery, greed and ambition, as time-servers are
guilty of; but he must also labour for the exercise
of such vertues as may commend his Ministry, and
gain respect for him in peoples consciences: for,
<hi>Paul,</hi> besides his freedom from such vices, doth
shew that his conversation was adorned with the
exercise of several praise-worthy graces, in this and
the following verses: <hi>But we were gentle among
you.</hi> 2. The Lords Ministers are not, under pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tence
of eschewing base flattery, to carry themselves
too austerely, retiredly, and much less indiscreet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly:
As they should not flatter men in any known
sin, so neither censoriously carp at every small thing,
<pb n="64" facs="tcp:61385:36"/>
wher<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>in is no <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>ffence neither to God nor man:
Both of which extremities must be eschewed, and
Gods way, which lyeth betwixt the two, followed:
They should so please all men to edification, <hi>Rom.
15.</hi> 2. as to flatter no man in what is really sinful;
They should so discountenance known sin in any man,
1 <hi>Tim.</hi> 5. 20. as to be of an amiable discreet and
gaining carriage towards all men: for, <hi>Paul</hi> having
cleared himself of base flattery, <hi>v.</hi> 5. sheweth here
that he was of a meek and amiable deportment
among them: <hi>But we were gentle among you.</hi>
3. So ticklish are people to be wrought upon in or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der
to their spiritual good, that a Minister who
would prevail with them must study their humours,
and set himself to digest many provocations, and
to comply with their temper, yielding unto them
all contentment in all things, so far as he safely may
with a good conscience; He must even become all
things to all men, that he may save some, 1 <hi>Cor.
9.</hi> 22. for, <hi>Paul</hi> implyeth that he did all this,
while he saith, <hi>we were gentle among you.</hi> 4. There
is somewhat of tender affection, and of care and
diligence flowing from affection, in a nursing mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
towards her own Children, which is exempla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry
and cannot well be imitated by any other; And
therefore mothers whom God hath made in all
other respects fit to nurse their Children them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves,
should not, without some pressing necessity,
deprive their little ones of their motherly care, by
putting the charge of them upon another: for, <hi>Paul</hi>
implyeth so much while, being to set forth the
height of his affection towards these <hi>Thessalonians,</hi>
he doth use the similitude, not of a mercenary nurse,
<pb n="65" facs="tcp:61385:36"/>
but of a nursing mother, as is clear from his call<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
the Children whom she cherisheth her own:
<hi>Even as a nurse cherisheth her children.</hi> 5. It is
not so much to be regarded what pieces of duty a
Minister doth discharge to a people, as with what
affection and heart they are discharged by him;
and a Minister who would have his pains facili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tated
unto himself, and blessed unto the Lords<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple,
should labour to put on towards them bowels
of compassion, and a kind of natural tenderness
of loving affection, such as is in a father or mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
towards their babes; Or if there be any af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fection
more tender than another, he should en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deavour
to put it on, and express it, in seeking after
their spiritual good: for, <hi>Pauls</hi> affection was such
as is in a nursing mother towards her own chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren.</p>
               <q>Ver. 8. So being affectionately desirous of you, we
were willing to have imparted unto you, not the
Gospel of God only, but also our own souls, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause
ye were dear unto us.</q>
               <p>The Apostle doth give, in this and the following
verses, five grounds of the former similitude, all
and every one of which doth prove his meek and
amiable deportment among them, as being so ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny
branches of it. And 1. as the nursing mother,
if she be <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>ut for a little time absent from her chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren,
doth most vehemently long to see them, that
she may give them the breasts and other food con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venient
for them: So <hi>Paul</hi> was affectionately de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sirous
of them; It implyes a vehement desire after
<pb n="66" facs="tcp:61385:37"/>
them, and speaketh (as it seemeth) the ardency
of desire he had, while he was busied with his
handy labour, <hi>v.</hi> 9. and they with theirs, to have
the Congregation again convened, that he might
preach unto them. 2. As the nursing mother when
she comes to her children hath an unspeakable de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>light
to feed them with food convenient, and with
her own blood now turned to milk: So, <hi>Paul</hi> was
<hi>willing,</hi> or had such an inexpressible delight and
pleasure (for so the word signifieth) not only to
feed them spiritually, and to impart the Gospel to
them by his Preaching, but also, for their through
confirmation in the truths preached by him, to im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>part
unto them, or for them, his very soul, that is
his life (so called usually, 1 <hi>Sam. 24. 11. &amp;
26.</hi> 21. because the presence of the soul in the body
is the cause of life.) Now this gradation here
used, from his impar<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>ing the Gospel to the impart<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
of his life, implyeth not, that the Gospel is of
less value than a mans life, but that it is more dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficult,
and speaketh greater affection in any, to
lay d<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>wn <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>is life for others, than to impart the
Gospel to them. 3. As the only reason which
moveth the nursing mother to do all, is motherly af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fection
to her children, and no hope of gain:
So was it with <hi>Paul</hi> even because they were <hi>dear
unto him,</hi> or beloved by him. The words To ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poned
hold ou<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap> several pieces of a sweet frame of
spirit, most necessary for a Minister: And first, he
should be so disposed, as to be ever in a readiness
to close with any opportunity that providence
doth offer for gaining of souls to God, yea and to
thirst after opportunities of that kind, when one
<pb n="67" facs="tcp:61385:37"/>
way or other they are withheld: for, thus was it
with <hi>Paul,</hi> he did vehemently long to have the
Lords people convened, that he might Preach to
them: <hi>So being affectionately desirous of you.</hi>
2. Whatever he doth in the several duties of his
calling, he should do it not of constraint, or with
a kind of reluctancy, for the simple exoneration of
his Conscience, and to stop the mouths of those
whom he feareth may otherwise challenge him,
1 <hi>Pet.</hi> 5. 2. but from an inward principle of de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>light,
and hearty good liking to his work: for,
<hi>Paul</hi> was acted from such a principle, <hi>we were wil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling,</hi>
or had an inexpressible delight and liking
(as the word signifies) to have <hi>imparted the Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>spel
to you.</hi> 3. The choice text wherein he should
delight most to discourse and preach of, should be
the glad tydings of salvation, to lost sinners, through
Jesus Christ a Redeemer: for, so did <hi>Paul:</hi> we
were willing to have imparted to you <hi>the Gospel,</hi>
or the glad tydings of salvation as the word doth
signifie. 4. He should be forecasting what the
faithful discharge of his message may cost him,
what hazard, loss, or suffering he may be put to
for it; and resolving, come what may come, never
to shrink from his duty: for, <hi>Paul</hi> did fore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cast,
it might cost him his life, and resolveth to quit
it: we were willing to have imparted to you not
the Gospel of God only, but also our own souls.
5. He should be so disposed, as to be in a readiness
to seal the truth preached by him with his blood, and
thereby to confirm and strengthen the Lords peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple
in the faith of it, <hi>Phil.</hi> 2. 17. if God shall call
him to it: for, so was <hi>Paul—to have im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parted
<pb n="68" facs="tcp:61385:38"/>
unto you our own souls.</hi> 6. He should la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bour
to have the Lords people so much indeared
to him and beloved by him, that whatever he do
unto them, or suffer for them, may flow from af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fection
and love to them: for, so was it with <hi>Paul:
We were willing to have imparted to you—be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause
ye were dear unto us.</hi>
               </p>
               <q>Ver. 9. For ye remember, brethren, our labour
and travel: for labouring night and day, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause
we would not be chargeable unto any of
you, we preached unto you the Gospel of God.</q>
               <p>Here is a fourth ground of the similitude, to
wit, that as the mother, who is poor and destitute
of her husbands help, doth labour night and day
that she may have wherewith to sustain her self,
and thereby enable her for sustaining of her chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren:
So doth the Apostle speak of his own dili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gence
here, and thereby confirmeth what he spoke
of his affection to them, <hi>v.</hi> 8. as appears by the
causal particle <hi>for,</hi> while he saith they did remem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber,
or at least might remember first, more gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rally,
his <hi>labour</hi> and <hi>travel:</hi> The first word in the
original expresseth labour unto weariness, and the
second labour after weariness, so that when his
body was wearied he did not give over, but made
to work again. And next more particularly,
1. His uncessant diligence in his labour, he labour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
night and day, to wit, so much of that time as
might be spared from his necessary refreshments
by meat and sleep. 2. The matter of his labour,
partly expressed in Preaching the Gospel, partly
<pb n="69" facs="tcp:61385:38"/>
implyed in his handly-labour, by making tents to
maintain himself, <hi>Act.</hi> 18. 3. 3. The end why he
did so labour, that he might not be chargeable nor
burthensome, neither to the whole community, nor
yet to the private estates of <hi>any</hi> particular person
among them: and this, as it seems, because, for
some reasons not mentioned, the success of the
Gospel would have been otherwise retarded among
them, as it would have been at <hi>Corinth</hi> if <hi>Paul</hi> had
exacted stipend from them, 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 9. 12. though it
was not so in other Churches where <hi>Paul</hi> exacted
his right, 2 <hi>Cor. 11. 8. Phil. 4. 14. Doct.</hi> 1.
Where there is entire and ardent love in the heart,
either to God or man, it maketh any piece of ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vice
done unto them or for them, though other<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wise
never so burthensome, to be but light and easie:
for, because they were dear to him, <hi>v.</hi> 8. there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
doth he willingly undergo no small labour and
travel for them: <hi>for ye remember brethren our la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bour
and travel.</hi> 2. It is the duty of people to
call to mind, and not to forget the great pains and
labour that Ministers have been at for bringing
about their spiritual good, that so they may not
only be thankful to God, who hath stirred up any
to lay their otherwise perishing condition so near
to the<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>r heart, and acknowledge their obligation to
instruments who have willingly spent themselves
for their sake: but also may thereby learn to va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lue
the worth of any spiritual good which they
have received, labour to maintain and improve it,
seeing their enjoying of it hath been the fruit of so
much diligence and pains: for, <hi>Paul</hi> implyeth it
was their duty to remember, while he saith, ye
<pb n="70" facs="tcp:61385:39"/>
remember brethren, our labour and travel. 3. It
is the Lords allowance and command that men of
most eminent parts and greatest esteem should di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mit
themselves to the meanest and most toile<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>some
of imployments, for purchasing a mean of
livelyhood and subsistence, rather than that they
should close with any sinful course, or use unlaw<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful
means for that end: for, here <hi>Paul,</hi> a great
Apostle, being straitned for a livelihood, doth <hi>la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bour
night and day</hi> in that mean employment of
making <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>ents, <hi>Act.</hi> 18. 3. 4. Though Ministers
are not to be entangled with the affairs of this life,
2 <hi>Tim.</hi> 2. 4. and ought to give themselves wholly
to the duties of their calling, so as they be not
turned aside from them by unnecessary diversions,
1 <hi>Tim.</hi> 4. 15. yet in case of necessity and want of
maintenance, otherwise occasioned either by the
extream poverty or profane unthankfulness of the
people, he may use some handie labour to maintain
himself and his family, 1 <hi>Tim.</hi> 5. 8. and yet not
cease from preaching the Gospel: for, <hi>Paul</hi> a Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nister
of the Gospel, in this case of necessity, did
<hi>labour night and day,</hi> and <hi>preached unto them the
Gospel of God.</hi> 5. There is no ground here from
<hi>Pauls</hi> practice to establish Popish works of super<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>erogation,
or good works, (which as they say)
are not commanded, but done over and above du<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty:
for, <hi>Pauls</hi> abstaining from taking maintenance
was no such work; It was his duty in the present
case (however he had sufficient right to it other<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wise,
<hi>v. 8.)</hi> seeing by taking of maintenance he would
have retarded the Gospel, and therewith the glory
of God and spiritual good of his neighbour,
<pb n="71" facs="tcp:61385:39"/>
1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 9. 12. for promoving whereof he was
bound by both tables of the Law <hi>(Matth. 22.
37, 39.)</hi> to do whatever was in his power; and
therefore in this case it was not a work over and
above duty.</p>
               <q>Ver. 10. Ye are witnesses, and God also, how ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lily,
and justly, and unblameably, we behaved
our selves among you that believe.</q>
               <p>This verse may be taken as a fifth ground of the
similitude, to this purpose, That as the godly nurs<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
mother doth not only nourish her children
with milk and other meat, but also endeavours to
live among them Christianly, that their tender age
be not corrupted, but rather edified by her good
example: So <hi>Paul</hi> did not only feed the <hi>Thessalo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nians</hi>
spiritually by preaching the Gospel, but also
made his Christian life and holy practice shine be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
them, while he behaved himself holily as to
God, in the duties of his worship, and justly as to
men, and in all his dealing with men, and (which
followeth upon the former) unblameably or with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out
complaint, so as (though God might justly tax
him, 1 <hi>Joh.</hi> 1. 8. yet) man could shew no reason
for which to blame him: And he saith, he behaved
himself thus <hi>among those that believe,</hi> the word
may be rendred <hi>to those that believe,</hi> implying, that
in his leading an holy life, next to Gods glory,
he had respect to their good, that they might be
edified by his good example. And for the truth
of all this, he appealeth both unto themselves and
God as witnesses; To them, as witnesses of his out<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward
<pb n="72" facs="tcp:61385:40"/>
conversation, and to God, as witness of his
inward sincerity. <hi>Doct.</hi> 1. As it is the duty of all,
and especially of Ministers unto their flocks, to
walk before them in the good example of an holy
life, otherwise they cannot choose but destroy
more by their unministerial walking than they can
build up and edifie by their most excellent and Or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thodox
Preaching: So it is a singular mercy unto
a people when God gives them such a Minister, as
even his very life and carriage doth Preach unto
them: for, <hi>Pauls</hi> life was thus exemplary for piety
before the <hi>Thessalonians,</hi> and he doth speak of it as
a mercy from God unto believers among them: <hi>ye
are witnesses</hi> saith he, <hi>how holily—we behaved
our selves among you,</hi> or <hi>to you that believe,</hi> im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plying
that his living so was much for their be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hoof:
and he saith, <hi>how holily</hi>—to shew his car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riage
was singularly and eminently holy, and not
according to the ordinary strain only. 2. Then is
the life of a Christian, and especially of a Christi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>an
Minister, such as it ought, when he hath re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>spect
to all the Commandments, as well to those of
the first Table by living holily to God, as of the
second by living justly towards men: for, so did
<hi>Paul: how holily and justly we behaved our selves.</hi>
3. It concerneth all men, and chiefly Ministers, to
carry themselves unblameably, and so as neither men
have just reason to complain of them, nor they be too
querulous and much in complaining of their own
lot measured out unto them by God, or of every
unkindness they may receive from the people of
their charge; There being no rank of people
which hath the eyes of more upon them, and whose
<pb n="73" facs="tcp:61385:40"/>
escapes do more incapacitate them to do good in
their station, and whom the Lord doth more ear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nestly
call to the exercise of patience, without all
seeming to repine, than those of the Ministry: for
the word in the original rendred <hi>unblameable</hi> doth
signifie <hi>without complaint,</hi> and that both in an active
and passive sense, that is, so that we do not much
complain of others, and that others have not rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son
to complain of us: <hi>how unblameably we behaved
our selves.</hi> 4. No man may need to expect he
can so walk as that none complain of him, or be
displeased with him; It is sufficient for a good man
in order to his peace, that he do so behave himself
as he give no occasion of complaint unto any, and
that those who are really gracious do approve of
him; But as for those who are yet in their unre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>newed
state, a man may expect that the more Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stianly
he doth walk, he shall be reproached the
more and spoken evil of by such, 1 <hi>Pet.</hi> 3. 16. for,
taking <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>he words as they are here rendred <hi>among
you that believe, Paul</hi> doth thereby imply, he was
not free of blame from all, but only from believers
among them. 5. That a man do live a truly pious
and Christian life, it is not sufficient that he dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>charge
all the external duties of the first and se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cond
table, with such exactness that the sharpest
sighted of men cannot justly tax him; but he must
also make Conscience of inward and spiritual du<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties,
and that he do what he doth in single-hearted
sincerity, from such motives, and for such ends, as
God approveth, and whereof only God himself is
witness, otherwise the more that a man do in the
external duty he is the more refined and self-de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiving
<pb n="74" facs="tcp:61385:41"/>
hypocrite: for, <hi>Paul</hi> made conscience both
of external and internal duties, as it appeareth
from his taking men to witness of the former, and
God to witness of the latter: <hi>ye are witnesses and
God also,</hi> &amp;c.</p>
               <q>Ver. 11. As ye know, how we exhorted and com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>forted,
and charged every one of you, (as a fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
doth his children.)</q>
               <p>He doth here prove that his life was such among
them as he presently spoke of, and thereby shews
somewhat further of that laudable and praise-wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thy
ministerial carriage which he had among them,
for the truth whereof he appealeth also to their
own knowledge and conscience; how that as a fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
(whose office is to instruct his children, being
come to age, <hi>Gen. 18. 19.)</hi> he made application of
the doctrine delivered by him unto every one of
them in particular, by <hi>exhorting</hi> some to duty,
duty, to wit, seriously and with much intreaty, (as
the word doth signifie) by comforting others un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der
their outward crosses or inward sad exercises,
and in order hereto by peaking lovingly and affecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>onately
unto them, (as the word doth signifie) and
by <hi>charging</hi> or obtesting others, and that with
most severe commination of terrible judgements, as
the word doth usually imply. <hi>Doct.</hi> 1. The most
exact touchstone whereby to try the real soundness
of any mans holiness, is to judge him by what he is
in the duties of his particular station; If so he not
only discharge the common duties which are in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cumbent
to every Christian of whatsoever calling,
<pb n="75" facs="tcp:61385:41"/>
but also make conscience of those particular duties
unto which he is in a peculiar manner obliged, as a
man set in such a station, whether as a Magistrate,
or Minister, or Master, or servant, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> for, <hi>Paul</hi>
doth mention his diligence in the several duties of
his particular calling as a Minister, for an evidence
that his life was holy, just and unblameable, while
he saith immediately after the former purpose, <hi>as
you know how we exhorted,</hi> &amp;c. 2. As a Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stian,
and especially a Minister, may sometimes
speak to the commendation of his own carriage,
and thereby do God good service, 2 <hi>Cor. 6. 3, 4, &amp;c.</hi>
So Christian prudence should teach him to single
out those things especially for the matter of his
own commendation, for which he knoweth he is
already approved and commended unto peoples
own consciences: for, <hi>Paul</hi> doth commend his
own Ministerial carriage from such things most,
as appeareth by his reiterated appeals to their own
consciences, for bearing witness to the truth of
what he saith, and here he appealeth again: <hi>As you
know,</hi> saith he. 3. As the chief piece of a Ministers
work is to make pertinent application of general
truths unto the particular cases of the Lords people:
So because the case of all is not one and the same,
but diverse, therefore he must, chiefly in the appli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>catory
part of his work, cut and divide the word
aright, 2 <hi>Tim.</hi> 2. 15. not by speaking unto all the
same things, and alike, but assigning unto every man
his own convenient portion, by exhorting the more
tractable, comforting the afflicted, and by obtesting
and charging under all highest pain such as are more
refractory and obstinate: for, so doth <hi>Paul, ye
<pb n="76" facs="tcp:61385:42"/>
know,</hi> saith he, <hi>how: we exhorted, and comforted,
and charged.</hi> 4. It is not sufficient exoneration
of a Minister that he Preach in publick, and there
make as particular application of general truths as
in prudence he may; But because there are some
things which it is not expedient to mention in pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lick,
<hi>Eph.</hi> 5. 12. and some who cannot be so well
gained by taxing their sin in publick, and others
who shuffle by themselves the closest application
that a Minister in prudence can make in the publick,
therefore he is also obliged to make application of
and to dispense the word to every one in private,
severally, and apart, so far as he may without ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pearance
of evil, <hi>chap.</hi> 5. 22. or wasting the time
which should of necessity be spent in fitting him
for, and discharging of the publick duties of his
Ministry which he oweth unto all: for <hi>Paul ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>horted,
comforted, and charged every one of them.</hi>
5. The Minister of Christ should so behave him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>self
with meekness and gentleness, as that he do
not by an excess of those weaken his Ministerial
gravity, authority and respect; A mixture of both
is an excellent composition, which if any other
doth most beseem a Minister: for, <hi>Paul</hi> having
shewn that for gentleness he was a nursing mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther,
<hi>v.</hi> 7. &amp;c. he declareth here, that for au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thority
and gravity he was as a father: <hi>As a fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
doth his Children,</hi> &amp;c.</p>
               <pb n="77" facs="tcp:61385:42"/>
               <q>Ver. 12. That ye would walk worthy of God, who
hath called you unto his Kingdom and Glory.</q>
               <p>Here is, first, what he exhorted them to, even to
walk worthy of the Lord, not as if they could have
demerited his favour, which is free, <hi>Rom.</hi> 11. 6. but
that they might so walk, as to resemble him in what
concerned their duty, 1 <hi>Pet.</hi> 1. 14, 15. As a child
is said to be worthy of such a father, when he imi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tateth
him; and so as their life might be accounted
worthy to be taken notice of by him, when they
with all their actions should come to stand and be
judged in his sight. Next, there is a reason to in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>force
this walk, in a description of God, from his
gracious act of calling them to partake, not only
of his Kingdom of grace here, but also of glory
hereafter. <hi>Doct.</hi> 1. As Christians are not called to
Idleness, or to stand still doing nothing, but to walk
and make progress; So the rule by which they
ought to walk is not their own corrupt wit, nor
yet the approbation or example of men, but that
excellent pattern of divine properties and vertues,
which Scripture ascribeth to God, and are held
forth to be imitated by us, in so far as our duty
is expressed by them: for, <hi>Paul</hi> says they were
called to walk worthy of the Lord. 2. Though
there is no walk attended with such real profit,
credit or comfort, as our walking worthy of the
Lord, and labouring to resemble him; yet so back<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward
are we to the way, so apt to be discouraged in
it, so resolute are men by nature never to own it,
that there must be no small work before we con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>descend
<pb n="78" facs="tcp:61385:43"/>
to enter it; yea, the Godly themselves do
need a sharp spur to pouse them forward, to keep
them from fainting in it, or turning away from it:
for, <hi>Paul</hi> saw it needful to exhort, comfort and
charge even those whom God had already called,
that they would walk worthy of God. 3. As none
can walk worthy of God but those who are effe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctually
called, all others being dead and destitute of
any principle of spiritual life and motion: So then
do we improve those excellent priviledges which
follow upon effectual calling, aright, when we do
not turn grace unto wantonness, but look on all
our gracious receipts as so many ingagements and
incitements unto duty: for, he supposeth they were
called, and draweth an argument from their calling,
and those gracious priviledges which follow on it,
to make them walk worthy of God: <hi>walk worthy
of God who hath called you,</hi> saith he, <hi>to his King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom
and glory.</hi> 4. As there is an inseparable con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nexion
betwixt a mans being a kindly subject of
Gods Kingdom of Grace here, and his partaking
of glory hereafter: So there is not any thing of
greater force, to make a man walk worthy of God,
by leading an holy life, than his well grounded faith
and hope of glory to be injoyed in Heaven: The
man who looketh to be in Heaven for ever, cannot
choose but have his conversation in Heaven, and
i<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="2 letters">
                     <desc>••</desc>
                  </gap>ure himself somewhat to the custome and man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ners
of that Country, where he intends to live eter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nally:
for, <hi>Paul</hi> makes the partaking of Gods
glory to follow necessarily upon reception to his
Kingdom, and both an argument to make them walk
worthy of God: <hi>who hath called you unto his King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom
and glory.</hi>
               </p>
               <pb n="79" facs="tcp:61385:43"/>
               <q>Ver. 13. For this cause also thank we God without
ceasing, because when ye received the word of
God which ye heard of us, ye received it not as
the word of men, but (as it is in truth) the
word of God, which effectually worketh also in
you that believe.</q>
               <p>The Apostle having already set forth his own
ministerial carriage, doth now (in further prose<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cution
of his main scope, which is to incite
them unto constancy) put them in mind of the
success of his Ministry among them, and thereby
confirmeth that his entrance unto them was not in
vain, as to the third thing which I shewed on <hi>v.</hi> 1.
was pointed at by that expression. And, first, he
expresseth his success among them briefly, while he
sheweth, that <hi>uncessantly,</hi> or, at all times, when oc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>casion
offered and God required, he made consci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence
of thanksgiving to God for the work of their
effectual calling by his Ministry, implyed in the
expression <hi>for this cause,</hi> which relates to the close
of <hi>v.</hi> 12. even because God had called them to his
Kingdom and glory. And next he proves they
were effectually called, and thereby doth more
fully express the success of his Ministry, by shew<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing,
1. They had heard the word of God preached
by him attentively. 2. They received it being heard,
or did take it to their second consideration whether
it was the word of God, or not; for so the word,
rendered <hi>received</hi> in the former part of the verse,
doth imply, even to receive what is spoken in order
to the tryal of what truth is in it. 3. After tryal
<pb n="80" facs="tcp:61385:44"/>
they found, and were perswaded that it was no hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mane
invention, but the truth of God: and here
<hi>Paul</hi> inserts in a parenthesis, that it is so indeed, and
consequently, that they were not mistaken in their
perswasion. 4. They did receive and embrace it
as such, for the word, rendered <hi>received</hi> in the se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cond
place, differs in the original from the for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer,
and signifieth so to receive, as with the heart
and by faith to embrace what after tryal hath been
found to be truth. 5. The word being thus re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived
did work effectually (in believers among
them) a gracious and real change from sin to holi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness
of life, as the fruit of the word is set forth,
2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 10. 4, 5. The word in the original signifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth
to work with a kind of irresistable efficacy.
<hi>Doct.</hi> 1. The Lord doth usually bless with suc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cess
the pains of those Ministers, whose life and
conversation doth prove exemplary for piety
unto the flock, and an ornament unto the Gospel
which they Preach: for, <hi>Pauls</hi> pains, whose
life and conversation was such (as is formerly
held forth) were blessed with that measure of suc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cess
among the <hi>Thessalonians,</hi> as he seeth reason to
thank the Lord for it: <hi>for this cause also thank we
God.</hi> 2. As a Minister may sometimes reflect
with joy upon the fruit of his labours, among the
Lords people: So he should beware in so doing to
sacrifice unto his own drag and net, 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 15. 10.
but ought to ascribe the praise of all his success
unto God, who alone doth teach his people to pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fit,
<hi>Isaiah</hi> 48. 17. for, <hi>Paul</hi> reflecteth upon his
success with thanksgiving to God: <hi>for this cause
also thank we God.</hi> 3. Though it be matter of thanks<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>giving
<pb n="81" facs="tcp:61385:44"/>
to God from a Minister, that he himself
hath obtained grace to discharge his duty faithful<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly,
whatever be his success among a people, seeing
in that case he is alwayes a sweet savour unto God,
2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 2. 15. yet a tender hearted servant of Christ
doth never find his heart so much inlarged in this
duty of thanksgiving, and all restraints so fully
taken off which might discourage him in it, as when
the Lord is pleased to bless his faithful diligence
with fruit and success among the people of his
charge: for, <hi>Paul</hi> doth then find himself inlarged
most to this duty, when his assiduous pains did get
an answerable return of fruitfulness: <hi>for this cause
also thank we God.</hi> 4. It is a great incouragement,
whether for Ministers or private Christians, to bear
burthen by prayer and thanksgiving unto God with
and for others, of whom it may be in charity pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sumed
that they are dealing earnestly with God for
themselves: for, he saith, <hi>we also thank God.</hi> The
particle <hi>also,</hi> implyes, they themselves were making
Conscience of this duty and therefore he and his
associates did discharge it the more heartily.
5. Our hearts should be disposed to, and kept in
such a frame for duties of Gods immediate worship,
and especially for speaking to God in prayer or
praise, that when ever occasion is offered, and the
Lord doth call us to it we may be alwayes in a rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diness
to close with it: for, <hi>Paul</hi> did thank God
without ceasing, that is, he was alwayes ready for
it, and when occasion offered did go about it.
6. The Scripture in hand doth point at some
steps, wherein people must walk, who would have
the Gospel blessed with success upon them. 1. As
<pb n="82" facs="tcp:61385:45"/>
the word of God, and chiefly the Gospel Preached
by sent Ministers, is the ordinary means of con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verting
sinners to God: So they who would be
converted by it must lend an attentive ear to hear
it, and carefully wait upon such occasions of hear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
it as God doth offer: for <hi>Paul</hi> speaking of the
means of their conversion and fruitfulness, saith,
<hi>The word of God which ye heard of us.</hi> 2. They
must seriously ponder and meditate upon the word
heard, and especially bring it to the proof, whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
it be the word of God or not, otherwise bare
hearing cannot profit: for, saith he, <hi>ye received
the word which ye heard of us.</hi> See the Expositi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on.
3. As the word of God delivered by his sent
Ministers doth still remain Gods word; speak it
who will, <hi>Matth.</hi> 23. 2, 3. or let men think of it
what they will, <hi>Ezek.</hi> 2. 4, 5. the nature of the
word is nothing altered: So the man who would
have the word blessed with success unto him, must
labour to settle himself in this perswasion, that the
word delivered from Scripture is the word of the
eternal God: And, indeed, after an accurate search,
it will be found to be so, by the consent of all its
parts, though written at divers times and several
hands, by the fulfilling of its prophesies, the ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jesty
and simplicity of its stile, the and wonderful ef<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficacy
of it in changing mens hearts, the malice of Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tan
against it in all ages, and yet the Lords wonderful
preserving of it, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> for, <hi>Paul</hi> affirms it to be Gods
word, and that they after search had found it to be
so: <hi>ye received it not as the word of men, but (as
it is in truth) as the word of God.</hi> 4. When a
man is thus perswaded, that the word delivered
<pb n="83" facs="tcp:61385:45"/>
from Scripture is no humane invention, but the
word of God, he may receive and entertain it as
his word, trembling at threatnings, <hi>Isa.</hi> 66. 2. re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>joycing
at and imbracing promises, <hi>Heb.</hi> 11. 13.
yielding obedience to precepts, <hi>Act.</hi> 4. 6. and sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitting
with patience to sharpest reproofs,
1 <hi>Sam.</hi> 3. 18. for that is to receive the word as
Gods word, and such a receiving is the ordinary
consequent of the forementioned perswasion: for,
they being perswaded it was Gods word, did re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive
and by faith embrace it: <hi>ye received it,</hi> saith
he, <hi>not as the word of man but as the word of God.</hi>
5. When a man hath thus received and imbraced
the word, he must labour to prove his so doing, by
making it appear that the word hath wrought ef<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fectually,
and over the belly of all impediments, a
mighty and gracious change in him from sin to
holiness: and the word, so received by faith, is
alwayes attended with such efficacy in those who
receive it: It is the power of misbelief in hearers,
which maketh so much Preaching to so little pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pose:
for saith he, <hi>which,</hi> to wit, the word so re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived,
<hi>effectually worketh also,</hi> not in all, <hi>but in
you that believe.</hi>
               </p>
               <q>Ver. 14. For ye, brethren, became followers of the
Churches of God, which in Judea are in Christ
Jesus: for ye also have suffered like things of your
own Countrymen, even as they have of the Jews.</q>
               <p>He proveth what he spoke of the success of his
Ministry, and efficacy of the word among them,
from their constancy and patience under sharp suf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferings
<pb n="84" facs="tcp:61385:46"/>
for truth; which, for their incouragement
and comfort, he doth set forth under a comparison of
likes or equals, to this sense, that they were follow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers
or made conform to the Christian Churches in
<hi>Judea,</hi> here called the Churches in <hi>Judea</hi> which are
in Christ, who are thereby distinguished from the
Jewish Synagogues, who held themselves for
Churches of God, but rejected Christ: The ground
of which conformity and likeness he sheweth did
lye in this, that they, the Christian Church at
<hi>Thessalonica,</hi> had for the same truth endured and
suffered the like evils and hardships, and with the
same constancy and courage, from their own Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trymen
and fellow Citizens, even as the Christian
Jews had endured and suffered from the obdured
Jews at home in <hi>Judea, Heb. 10. 32, 33, 34.
Doct.</hi> 1. So effectual and powerful in working is
the word of truth, that it makes the imbracers of
it endure the greatest hardships and sharpest suf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferings
for love to it, rather than to deny it a
testimony when God calls for it: for, he gives this
as an instance of the efficacy of the word, that
they <hi>became followers of the Churches of God</hi> in
suffering for truth. 2. There is not a more con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vincing
evidence that the word of God is received
as it ought, and of its supernatural efficacy in those
who do receive it, than that it works a conformity
in them with others in that which is good, and
especially in bearing afflictions and sufferings for
truth with Christian courage and patience as they
ought: for, among all others, he pitcheth on this
one evidence, that they had received the word
aright, and that it had wrought effectually in them,
<pb n="85" facs="tcp:61385:46"/>
even that they became followers of the Churches of
God, in their couragious and Christian carriage,
under sufferings for truths sake. 3. As every er<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rour
and imperfection in a Church doth not pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sently
unchurch them, nor provoke the Lord to
withdraw his special and powerful influence, which
is necessary for actuating the graces of his Spirit in
them, and for making them fruitful in good works:
So we ought diligently to distinguish the sinful
failings and praise-worthy practices, both of per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sons
and Churches, that we neither imitate them in
what is evil, nor yet under a pretence of hatred to
their evil, neglect to follow and imitate those things
in them which are truly good: for, though the
Christian Churches in <hi>Judea</hi> were in some things
extreamly tenacious of the Ceremonial Law now
abolished, <hi>Act.</hi> 21. yet they got the name of true
Churches, and were honoured of God to be emi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nent
sufferers for truth, and the Church at <hi>Thessa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lonica</hi>
did imitate them in their Christian suffering,
though not in their sinful failings: <hi>ye became fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowers
of the Churches of God in Judea, for ye
have suffered like things.</hi> 4. It is no small en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>couragement
and comfort to the Lords people un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der
a suffering lot that nothing doth befall them
but what is common to men, yea to the best and
choicest of Gods Saints and servants, and that the
Lord doth try them with nothing but that wherein
some of his eminent worthies have ridden the ford
before them: for, <hi>Paul</hi> comforts them under their
sufferings from this, that they had the Churches in
<hi>Judea</hi> for their precedents, yea and, as it is <hi>v.</hi> 15.
Christ himself, his Prophets and Apostles, <hi>ye be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>came
<pb n="86" facs="tcp:61385:47"/>
followers of the Churches of God in Judea:
for ye have suffered like things.</hi> 5. As it addeth
no small weight unto a suffering lot, that those of
our nearest relations are most instrumental in it; So
such is the fury of a persecuting spirit that when
men are judicially given up of God unto it, they
break all natural and civil bonds, and prove unnatu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral
Beasts and Tigers towards those of their most
near relations, who dare not deny the truth which
they do persecute: for, the Churches both in <hi>Ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dea</hi>
and <hi>Thessalonica</hi> were persecuted by their
<hi>Countrymen,</hi> which made their sufferings the more
weighty: The word signifieth men of one Nation,
Tribe, or Company.</p>
               <q>Ver. 15. Who both killed the Lord Jesus, and their
own Prophets, and have persecuted us; and they
please not God, and are contrary to all men.
16. Forbidding us to speak to the Gentiles, that
they might be saved, to fill up their sins alway:
for the wrath is come upon them to the utter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>most.</q>
               <p>The Apostle having occasionally mentioned the
persecution raised by the Jews, in all places where
they had power, against the Gospel, doth see it
necessary not only further to comfort those suffer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
<hi>Thessalonians,</hi> by shewing that Christ and the
Prophets had formerly suffered, and they the
Apostles did presently suffer no less than they: but
also to prevent their stumbling at the Gospel upon
this ground, that the Jews who in former times
were Gods only people did so much oppose it.
<pb n="87" facs="tcp:61385:47"/>
Which he doth, first, by taking off their deceiving
vizard, or mask, of being Gods only people, under
which they lurked and made themselves terrible to
all their opposites, &amp; by making them appear in their
own colours, while he reckoneth out seven horrid
crimes, whereof the body of that people, made up
of Parents and Children in several succeeding ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nerations,
were guilty: As 1. they <hi>killed,</hi> with
great barbarity and cruelty (as the word doth sig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nifie)
Jesus Christ, who was the Lord of glory,
1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 2. 8. and their Lord, to whom they owed
subjection and homage. 2. They <hi>killed</hi> with the
same barbarity the holy Prophets, called here <hi>their
own,</hi> because they were of their own Nation, and
sent with a peculiar message to them. 3. They
<hi>persecuted,</hi> banished and drave away (as the word
doth signifie) <hi>Paul</hi> and the rest of the Apostles.
4. They pleased not God, they neither had his
favour, nor cared much for it; Their woful way
displeased him exceedingly. 5. They were con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary,
and enemies unto all men, to wit, in so far
as they hindered the course of the Gospel, by
which alone salvation is brought to lost mankind,
<hi>Tit.</hi> 2. 11. This is contained, <hi>v.</hi> 15. Their sixth crime
was their violent hindering (as the word rendred
forbidding doth signifie) the Apostles to speak, or
preach, to wit, the Gospel, unto the Gentiles, and
consequently obstructing, so far as in them lay, the
salvation almost of all the world. The last crime
with which they are charged is, That however they
did not intend any such thing, yet by committing
those and many other such mischiefs, they did <hi>al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wayes,</hi>
and without intermission <hi>fill up their sins,</hi>
                  <pb n="88" facs="tcp:61385:48"/>
that is, carry on their wickedness to such a measure
and height, as God had decreed to permit them to
come at, without stop or hinderance, before he
did inflict deserved judgement. See the like
phrase to this sense, <hi>Gen. 15. 6. Matth.</hi> 23. 32.
and having thus reckoned out their crimes, he doth
further prevent all stumbling at the Gospel, that
might arise from their opposition to it, by shewing
that as the wrath of God had already begun to seise
upon them, by hardning them judicially in sin (for
he speaks in the preterit time, to denote that this
wrath was already begun:) So it should pursue
and surprize them suddenly and unexpectedly, (as
the word rendered <hi>come</hi> doth imply,) and that to the
<hi>uttermost,</hi> without all mitigation, or to the end (as
the word in the original doth read,) which speaks
the continuance of their Judgement, until <hi>Jerusa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lem,</hi>
wherein the great part of the Jews were at
that time providentially assembled, was taken,
sacked and destroyed by the <hi>Romans;</hi> after which
the Jews have hitherto been no more a people, but
scattered abroad through the face of the earth. For
confirming this sense of the words see <hi>Dan.</hi> 9. 26.
with <hi>Matth.</hi> 23. 38.</p>
               <p>From <hi>v.</hi> 15. Learn 1. As it doth much imbitter
a suffering lot, when those who are Satans instru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments
in it do go disguised under a mask of piety
and zeal for truth: So it is no less comfort and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>couragement
to Christs suffering servants, when
that deceiving mask is taken off their persecutors,
and they are made to appear in their blackest co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lours,
and to be what they really are, profane ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mies
to God, under a pretext of friendship to him:
<pb n="89" facs="tcp:61385:48"/>
for, because it was one of the most bitter ingredi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ents
in all their sufferings, that they had their rise
from the Jews, who were in reputation for Gods
only people, therefore doth <hi>Paul</hi> discover them to
be but profane Atheists: <hi>who both killed the Lord
Jesus,</hi> &amp;c. 2. It is a choice and excellent cordial
to keep a Christian from fainting under his sharpest
tryals, to call to mind the sore sufferings of the
Lord Christ, who did willingly <hi>(John 10. 18.)</hi>
endure much more for us than we can endure for
him, <hi>Rom.</hi> 5. 6, 7, 8. and by his sufferings hath
not only cast us a Coppy, 1 <hi>Pet.</hi> 2. 21. but also
sanctified ours, and taken the gall and wormwood
of deserved wrath out of our cup before we be
made to drink it, <hi>Joh.</hi> 16. 33. for, <hi>Paul</hi> doth put
them in mind of Christs sufferings, thereby to
hearten those <hi>Thessalonians</hi> under theirs: <hi>who both
killed the Lord Jesus.</hi> 3. That the wise and holy
Lord hath decreed to permit sin, and that God
doth make mans sin turn about to his own glory
and his peoples good, doth no wayes excuse the
sinner or make him guiltless, and that because he
sinneth willingly, and nor to fulfil the Lords de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cree,
whereof he is ignorant, <hi>Jer.</hi> 23. 18. or to
promove that good intended by God, but to satisfie
some one or other of his own sinful lusts, and to
vent his spleen and enmity against the Lord, <hi>Isa.
10. 7, &amp;c.</hi> for, though it was determined before
by God that Christ should dye, <hi>Act.</hi> 4. 28. and
though lost sinners could not otherwise be saved,
<hi>Act.</hi> 4. 12. yet the actors and instruments in his
death, are here charged as horrid sinners in that
act: <hi>who both killed the Lord Jesus.</hi> 4. Accession
<pb n="90" facs="tcp:61385:49"/>
to sin by counsel, procurement, or any other way,
doth make the person who is so accessory guilty of
the sin, as if he were an immediate actor of it:
for, though it was the <hi>Romans</hi> who were the im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mediate
actors, both Judge <hi>(Matth. 27. 2, 26.)</hi>
and executioners <hi>(Matth. 27. 27.)</hi> in Christs
death, and not the Jews, <hi>John</hi> 18. 31. yet because
their malicious accusations, <hi>Luk.</hi> 23. 10. and im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portunate
intreaties with <hi>Pilate, Luk.</hi> 23. 18, 21.
did procure it, Therefore are they here charged
as guilty of it: <hi>who both killed the Lord Jesus.</hi>
5. There is no sin so old, which is not (if not
repented of and pardoned, <hi>Isa. 43. 25.)</hi> in recent
memory with God: for, the Lord doth here re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>member
that long agoe by-past guiltiness in <hi>killing
their own Prophets.</hi> 6. The sins of Parents are
imputed to Children, when Children continue to
walk in their Fathers steps, and that because they
do in that case by their practice approve what their
Parents did, and in effect proclaim that if they had
lived in the dayes of their Fathers, they would have
done the same, <hi>Matth.</hi> 23. 29. for, here, the pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sent
generation of the Jews are charged with the
sin of their Parents, who killed the Prophets, and
that because they walked in their steps, by killing
the Lord Jesus and persecuting the Apostles: <hi>who
killed—their own Prophets.</hi> 7. So ungrate
is man, and such an enemy to his own mercies, that
being left unto himself he will not fail, not only to
refuse an offer of friendship and peace with God,
but also to requite evil for good unto those who
labour with them to accept it: And as it hath been
the lot of Gods publick Ministers in all ages, to
<pb n="91" facs="tcp:61385:49"/>
receive such a meeting from those to whom they are
sent; So they ought to resolve to meet with such
a requital yet: for, though Christ the Lord, the
Prophets and Apostles did come to the Jews with
that offer, yet they <hi>both killed the Lord Jesus, and
their own Prophets, and have persecuted us,</hi> saith
<hi>Paul.</hi> 8. There are some sins, and especially en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mity
to God and his work, which often run as it
were in a blood from Parent to Child through ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny
generations, the Lord in justice so permitting
and ordering, that he may visit the sins of the Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers
upon the Children, <hi>Exod.</hi> 20. 5. and punish
Godless Parents in their more Godless posterity,
<hi>Psal.</hi> 109. 13. for, this sin became hereditary, and
in a kind transient from one generation to another
among the Jews. The former generations killed
their own Prophets, and the present hath persecuted
us, saith <hi>Paul.</hi> 9. As God is highly displeased
with opposers and persecutors of a Godly Mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stry.
So a persecuting spirit, when men are given
up unto it, in progress of time doth waste the Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>science,
eat up all tender respect to God and his
service, and rendreth men in the end very Atheists:
for, this follows upon their persecuring a sent Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nistry,
<hi>They please not God,</hi> that is, God was not
pleased with them, neither did they care to please
him. 10. Where the fear of God is not, there
cannot be due respect to man, and accordingly as
men do loose the reins unto impiety against the
Lord, so do they by little and little lose all sense
of common humanity, until at last, if the Lord re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>strain
not, they prove wholly barbarous, very
<hi>Ishmaels,</hi> their hand against every man, and every
<pb n="92" facs="tcp:61385:50"/>
mans hand against them: for, upon their not caring
to please God, they became <hi>contrary to all men.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>From <hi>v.</hi> 16. Learn 1. As the Gospel findeth
all men in a condition lost by nature, and is the
only means appointed of God for bringing lost
man unto a state of salvation by Christ, the attain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
whereof should be the great end proposed by
all who Preach it: So there can be no such evi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence
of an hostile mind in any against all man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kind,
as to impede and forcibly forbid the Preach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
of this Gospel, and thereby to seek the destru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction
not only of the body, which other enemies
rest satisfied with, but also of the immortal soul:
for, he gives this as an evidence of their enmity
to all men, they did <hi>forbid us,</hi> saith he, <hi>to speak
to the Gentiles,</hi> and shews that the end of the do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrine
of the Gospel, and their aim in preaching it,
was, <hi>that they might be saved.</hi> 2. When men
do wilfully reject the offer of salvation themselves,
they do not usually rest until they first envy and at
last maliciously oppose the embracing of it by
others: If they do not enter themselves, neither
will they suffer others: for, the Jews who re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jected
Christ and the Gospel themselves did for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bid
the Apostles to speak unto the Gentiles that
they might be saved. 3. When men do enter once
a course of sin, and advance some steps in it, they
cannot well retire, but (except the Lord restrain
or work a gracious change) one sin will make way
for another, until the inslaved sinner be carried on
to the greatest height of sin and wickedness that
his utmost power and ability can reach: for, the
Jews being once ingaged in a course of persecu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
<pb n="93" facs="tcp:61385:50"/>
were never quiet, but sinned alwayes, that is,
made daily progress in wickedness to fill up their
sins alway. 4. The providence of God prescribeth
bounds, as unto all things, <hi>Eph. 1—11.</hi> so unto
mens sins, There being a certain measure of sinning
condescended upon by God, for Nations, Families
or Persons with whom God hath a controversie,
beyond which they cannot pass, and to which they
shall come, before the Lord take course with
them: for, the <hi>filling up of their sins,</hi> here spoken
of, is to be understood with respect had to that
measure, condescended upon in Gods secret decree
and purpose:—<hi>to fill up their sins alway.</hi>
5. That the Lord gives way unto Godless sinners
to run on in wickedness without controul or check,
doth come from no respect, but hatred to them,
The Lord permitting them so to do that their mea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sure
of sinning being the sooner filled up, the more
unexpected wrath and destruction from the Lord
may seise upon them: for, the Apostle shews that
Gods intention in giving way to all their former
wickedness was to <hi>fill up their sins alway.</hi>
6. When the former sins of a Person, Family or
Nation, have justly provoked the Lord in his
wrath to harden them, and give them up judici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally
to satisfie their own hearts Lusts, and to fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low,
without controle from him, whatever their
Godless profane heart shall suggest to them, In
such a case, they prove remediless, and cannot
choose but add sin <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 word">
                     <desc>〈◊〉</desc>
                  </gap> sin, until the Lord one way
or other take some course with them: for, so was
it with the Jews being given over of God they
filled up their <hi>sin alway, untill wrath did come
<pb n="94" facs="tcp:61385:51"/>
upon them to the uttermost.</hi> 7. The Lord doth
keep a kind of proportion betwixt his wrath and
the sins of an impenitent people, so that as they go
on in sinning and will not be impeded, until they
come to that height and measure, further than
which they cannot go: So doth the Lord give way
to his wrath and makes it pursue them, until it
destroy, consume and make a full and final end
of them: for, thus was it with the Jews, they
filled up their sin alway, and Gods <hi>wrath came
upon them to the uttermost,</hi> or, <hi>to the end.</hi> 8. The
more eminent mercies and favours from God a
people or person have lived under and enjoyed, the
more signal Judgements shall they be surprized
with, in case of their continued abuse of, and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gratitude
for such excellent receipts: for, the
Lord in the point of mercy and favour dealt so
with the Jews as he did not with any people,
<hi>Psal.</hi> 147. 19, 20. and because of their ingrati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tude
they are made examples of Gods wrath and
Judgement:—<hi>the wrath is come upon
them to the uttermost.</hi>
               </p>
               <q>Ver. 17. But we, brethren, being taken from you for

the more abundantly to see your face
with great desire.</q>
               <p>In the second part of the Chapter, the Apostle,
in further pursuance of his <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>ain scope, which is

                  </gap> doctrine Preached
by him, doth relate unto them that solicitous care
and most intimate affection, he yet had of them and
<pb n="95" facs="tcp:61385:51"/>
to them: and he falleth upon and prosecutes this
purpose, in a kind of Apologie for his absence
from them, which he excuseth, first, from his ear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nest
desire and purpose he had to see them before
now. And 1. he expresseth the cause of his ear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nest
desire, to wit, his sudden removal; being dri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven
away from them unexpectedly, or in the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stant
of an hour (as the words rendred, <hi>for a
short time,</hi> do well read, and is most agreeable to
the history, <hi>Act. 17. 10.)</hi> which his suddain re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moval
occasioned him no less grief than that of a
tender father, when bereft of his orphan Chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren
(as the word rendred <hi>taken from you</hi> doth
imply) whence it came to pass that though his
bodily <hi>presence</hi> was by force and violence taken
from them, yet he had left his <hi>heart</hi> and affection
with them. Next he expresseth his desire and pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pose
it self to this sense, that the greater his grief
was for his removal from them, his <hi>endeavour</hi> or
resolute fervent purpose to see them (as the word
implyeth) together with his continued and active
desire (as the word rendred <hi>desire</hi> doth signifie)
were so much the more vehement. <hi>Doct.</hi> 1. A
tender walker will labour to approve himself
(though chiefly—2 <hi>Tim.</hi> 2. 15. yet) not only to
God, by making conscience of every duty; but
also to man, so that he cannot willingly lye under
the suspicion of a neglected duty, but will labour
as he can have access to clear himself of it: for,
<hi>Paul</hi> conceiving they might have suspected he had
sinfully neglected his duty in giving them a visit,
when he ought and might, he doth here clear him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>self
of that neglect: <hi>for we, brethren, being taken
<pb n="96" facs="tcp:61385:52"/>
from you,</hi> &amp;c. 2. The society, presence, and mutual
fellowship of the Lords people among themselves,
doth prove most sweet and advantageous, and espe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cially
the presence and fellowship of the flock is
most acceptable unto a Pastor, whose pains the
Lord hath blessed among them; for, <hi>Pauls</hi> labours
were blessed unto the <hi>Thessalonians,</hi> and therefore
his absence from them was so grievous to him,
and their presence so much desired by him: <hi>But
we being taken from you,</hi> &amp;c. 3. It is therefore
no little piece of Satans work and business to mar
the comfort of any such fellowship, not only by
working strife, division and prejudice among them
while they are together, <hi>Act.</hi> 15. 39. but also by
procuring one way or other, their scattering into
divers places, so that they cannot enjoy that mu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tual
fellowship which gladly they would: for,
saith <hi>Paul, we were taken from you for a short
time;</hi> and this by Satans procurement as the fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowing
verse doth shew. 4. So great delight hath
a Godly Pastor to converse among his flock, that
even necessitated absence from them, occasioned
by persecution or other wayes, will be grievous to
him: So was it with <hi>Paul,</hi> whose necessitated re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moval
from the <hi>Thessalonians</hi> was no less grievous,
than a Fathers removal from his destitute Or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phans,
as the word implyeth, which is rendred <hi>be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
taken from you.</hi> 5. It is the duty and wis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom
of the Lords people to make good use of the
company and pains of godly and faithful Ministers,
seeing unexpectedly, in a moment, and twinkling
of an eye they may be deprived of them: for,
<hi>Paul</hi> was taken from them <hi>for a short time,</hi> or
<pb n="97" facs="tcp:61385:52"/>
in a short time, the instant of an hour, as the word
doth read. 6. It is no small comfort unto the
Lords people under their saddest dissipation and
scattering, that however they cannot enjoy the bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dily
presence one of another, yet they may be pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sent
one with another in heart and affection, by
minding one anothers case, 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 7. 3. by being
suitably affected with it, <hi>Heb.</hi> 13. 3. and not only
praying to God for, but also by all lawful means
procuring the good one of another, <hi>Col.</hi> 4. 12. for,
though <hi>Paul</hi> was taken from them <hi>in presence,</hi> yet
<hi>not in heart.</hi> 7. Where desires after good are
fervent, and such as they ought, they will be ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>companied
with fixed endeavours and purposes to
get them accomplished: a desire that comes not up
the length of an endeavour and purpose, is not
worthy the name of a praise-worthy desire, but
of the sluggards raw and coldryf with, <hi>Prov.</hi> 21. 25.
for, <hi>Pauls</hi> great desire to see them, had endeavours
or fixed purposes joyned with it: <hi>we endeavoured
to see your face with great desire.</hi> 8. True grace
and gracious affections of love, desire, hope, ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tred,
<hi>&amp;c.</hi> the more they are opposed, they grow
the more fervent, all contrary opposition being but
as Oyle, or a little water cast upon a flame, which
maketh it burn the more: for, the more that <hi>Paul</hi>
was stopped from coming to them, he <hi>endeavoured
the more abundantly to see their face with great
desire.</hi>
               </p>
               <q>Ver. 18. Wherefore we would have come unto you
(even I Paul) once and again, but Satan hin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dred

He excuseth his absence secondly, and doth fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
acquaint them with his solicitous care of them,
by shewing, first, that he and his associates, in whose
name he doth write all along, but it seems especially
he himself not only desir'd and purposed to give them
a visit, but also did <hi>once and again,</hi> that is, divers times
enterprise to fulfil his purpose: (for, the word ren<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dred
<hi>we would</hi> must be taken for such an enterprize,
and not for a naked desire, seeing he had such a de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sire
always, and not only once and again) and se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>condly
by shewing that Satan had hindred him to
fulfil his enterprize, either by stirring up some to lay
snares for him in the way, as <hi>Act.</hi> 23. 12, &amp;c. or by
raising new troubles in other Churches, which re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quired
<hi>Pauls</hi> presence. <hi>Doct.</hi> 1. It doth not suf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficiently
assoile a man of neglect of duty that he
hath had some desire after it, and purposes to set
about it, except those desires and purposes have
been seconded by active and resolute enterprizes,
to get them fulfilled and performed: for, <hi>Pauls</hi>
desires and purposes were followed with such en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terprizes:
wherefore <hi>we would have come unto
you.</hi> 2. Neither will it yet assoile him that he
hath once set about his duty, and upon the first
discovery of an impediment and hinderance pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sently
retired, and cast by all further care of it;
But where there is a fervent and honest desire af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
duty, there should be a renewing of enterprizes
and endeavours even after many disappointments,
until either their desire be fulfilled, or at least it be
made to appear that the Lord hath otherwayes de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>termined,
1 <hi>Sam.</hi> 16. 1. compared with 4. for, <hi>Paul</hi>
                  <pb n="99" facs="tcp:61385:53"/>
thinks it not sufficient to excuse his not coming,
from this only that he had a fervent desire, and ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cordingly
had enterprized once to come, but addeth,
<hi>we would have come to you once and again,</hi> that
is, often. 3. The Lord, for good and wise rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sons,
may suffer his people so far to engage in a
business, as once and again to enterprize it, ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving
cleared their way for doing so much, and yet
having tryed their obedience in that far, after<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards
cast in, or suffer to be cast in, some invin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cible
stop or let to mar them from throughing it;
In which case he accepts the will for the deed, and
a serious enterprize for full performance, 1 <hi>King.
8.</hi> 18, 19. for, the Lord did clear <hi>Pauls</hi> way to at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tempt
a Voyage to <hi>Thessalonica</hi> often, and yet per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitted
Satan to lay in a stop: <hi>we would have come
once and again, but Satan hindred us.</hi> 4. It is
the duty of Saints to surcease from that which
otherwayes were a duty, when God doth call them
to surcease from it, and consequently for the time
doth make it no duty, either by giving them other
more necessary work, or by making some inevita<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble
hazard to their own life appear in that work,
without any advantage but with much prejudice to
Religion and the work of God: for, <hi>Paul</hi> upon
Satan his casting in, through Gods permission,
some one or both of those impediments, he delayes
his Voyage to <hi>Thessalonica,</hi> which otherwayes was
a duty: <hi>we would have come once and again, but
Satan hindred us.</hi> 5. As the Child of God can no
sooner enterprize that which is really good, but
usually he doth as soon meet with some impedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment;
So whoever be the means or instruments
<pb n="100" facs="tcp:61385:54"/>
for impeding us in the way of duty, the Devil him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>self
through Gods permission is the prime Author
of that woful work, and all others do but fight
under his Banner: for, though other means were
doubtless accessary to <hi>Pauls</hi> stay, yet <hi>Satan hin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dred
us,</hi> saith he. 6. When once the Godly are
by Satans craft or malice disjoyned, or separate,
whether in place, affection or judgement, the same
Satan doth bend his wit to hinder their re-uniting
and meeting together again in one: So great an
enemy is he to that rich advantage, which may be
attained in and by the Communion of Saints: for,
saith <hi>Paul, we would have come unto you, but Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tan
hindred us.</hi>
               </p>
               <q>Ver. 19. For what is our hope, or joy, or crown
of rejoycing? are not even ye in the presence
of our Lord Jesus Christ at his coming?</q>
               <p>He doth here give a reason of his desire, pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pose,
and frequently reiterated attempt to come
and see them; and thereby doth also shew how
highly he esteemed of them, while by proponing a
question (to shew how pathetick he was in his
affection to them) and by answering it himself, he
declareth, 1. They were his hope, Christ is indeed
the only ground and foundation of our hope, 1 <hi>Tim.
1.</hi> 1. by whose merit and intercession we expect
to obtain the good thing hoped for, <hi>chap.</hi> 5. 9, 10.
but they were only a strengthning incouragement
to his hope, in so far as their conversion, by his
Ministry, was a speaking evidence, among other
things, of his right to the promised reward of glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry,
<pb n="101" facs="tcp:61385:54"/>
                  <hi>Dan.</hi> 12. 3. And 2. in the same sense he calleth
them his joy, because Gods goodness to them,
and bestowed on them by the means of his Mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stry,
did already in part, and was more fully af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terwards
in Heaven to furnish him with matter of
joy in God. And 3. his Crown, or Ornament,
and a crown of rejoycing, or of glorious boasting,
for which he had matter of glorying in Christ, and
eternal rejoycing and glory was to be freely re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>compensed
to him by God: See 2 <hi>Tim.</hi> 4. 8. And
therefore in his answer to the question, he shew<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth
they were to be all those unto him, not so
much in this life, as at Christs second coming in
the great day, whose sight and presence then
should make the <hi>Thessalonians</hi> to be that to <hi>Paul</hi>
which he expected from them. <hi>Doct.</hi> 1. As we
ought to speak and think of Heaven and glory,
not drily and warshly, but with an open mouth and
inlarged heart, thereby to testifie unto our selves
or others, that we believe the reality of what Scri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pture
speaketh to that purpose: So the more we
think and speak of that subject as we ought, our
faith and sense thereof will grow, and rise by de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>grees
unto a greater height: for, <hi>Paul</hi> speaking
of that Heavenly glory, speaks affectionately of
it, and his speech concerning it doth rise by de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>grees,
while he mentioneth it first under the name
of hope, next of joy, thirdly of a crown of re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>joycing:
<hi>For what is our hope, or joy, or crown of
rejoycing?</hi> 2. A faithful Minister doth take an ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gument
for his present or future rejoycing, not so
much from the worth or dignity of the office it
self, as from the blessing of God upon the faithful
<pb n="102" facs="tcp:61385:55"/>
imploying of his talents in that office: for, <hi>Paul</hi>
doth promise unto himself matter of joy and
rejoycing, not from this that he was an Apostle,
or Minister, but that they were gained to God
by his Ministry: <hi>for what is our hope, or joy, or
crown of rejoycing? are not even ye?</hi> 3. Though
unregenerate men be sometimes made use of by
God as Ministers, for converting of sinners, <hi>Mat.
7.</hi> 22. who already have their reward, because
they do all they do to be seen of men, <hi>Matth.
6.</hi> 2. yet when a Minister hath first made sure
his own right to Heaven through the blood of
Christ, he may expect that the more his labours
have been blessed of God for converting souls, he
shall have the more of joy and glory at Christs
second coming: for, <hi>Paul</hi> affirmeth that they, as
being converted by his Ministry, should bring
some accession to his joy and rejoycing then,
while he saith, <hi>are not even ye in the presence of
our Lord Jesus Christ, at his coming?</hi> 4. As a
Minister may sometimes lawfully commend the
good he seeth in people, so he should beware lest
he so commend them as to flatter them, or cry
them up as singular and above others, who are
equally deserving: for, the Apostle in commend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
them as those by whom he should have mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
of joy, saith, <hi>are not even ye?</hi> the word may
read are not <hi>also ye,</hi> to wit, as other Churches, so
that he doth not make them singular. 5. It is the
presence of Christ, a sight of him, and of interest
in him by faith or sense, which maketh the pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sence
of our graces, or of any good done by us, to
afford us matter of comfort, joy or boasting, see<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
<pb n="103" facs="tcp:61385:55"/>
it is he alone in whom the imperfection of our
good are covered, 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 1. 30. and by whom
that wrath and curse, which would have spoiled
our mirth eternally, is quite removed, <hi>Gal.</hi> 6. 13.
for, he implyeth it would be Christs presence which
should make them his joy and crown, while he
saith, <hi>are not even ye in the presence of our Lord
Jesus Christ, at his</hi> second <hi>coming.</hi> 6. Though
the Lord Christ doth manifest himself in some
measure unto his own, while they are here on
earth, <hi>Joh.</hi> 14. 23. yet the full and through dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>covery
of him is reserved until his second com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing:
we see him now but through a glass, but then
face to face, with such a sight as shall make us
throughly like him, 1 <hi>Joh.</hi> 3. 2. even our vile bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dies
shall be transformed by him, and made like
his own most glorious body, <hi>Phil.</hi> 3. 21. for, he
conjoyneth Christs presence and his second com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing,
because his presence shall shine most brightly
then: <hi>are not even ye in the presence of our Lord
Jesus Christ at his</hi> second <hi>coming.</hi>
               </p>
               <q>Ver. 20. For ye are our glory and joy.</q>
               <p>He repeats, with an asseveration, what he pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sently
shewed they would serve for unto him at
Christs second coming, and this to declare both the
certainty of the thing in it self, and the perswasion
which he had of it, while he saith, <hi>for,</hi> or <hi>truly</hi>
(as the word is sometime rendred) <hi>ye are our glory
and joy.</hi> Hence, Learn, our faith and hope of in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terest
in glory when it is attained, and especially
when it is accompanyed with some foretastings of
<pb n="104" facs="tcp:61385:56"/>
the sweetness of it, should be not only once, but
frequently reacted and avowed, hereby to assure
our hearts the more that our faith is real and no
delusion, and consequently to fit us for rejecting
all contrary tentations, when we shall be assaulted
with them afterwards: for, <hi>Paul</hi> doth again re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>joycingly
repeat the confidence he had of joy and
glory at Christ second coming, while he saith,
<hi>Truly ye are our glory and joy.</hi>

               <q>Ver. 1. WHerefore when we could no longer
forbear, we thought it good to be
left at Athens alone.</q>
               <p>The Apostle, being yet further to excuse his
long absence from them, and joyntly therewith to
express that solicitous care which he had of them,
by his sending <hi>Timotheus</hi> unto them, he doth first in
this verse express the cause inwardly moving him to
send him, to wit, his fervent affection towards
them, which was such that <hi>when he could not longer
forbear,</hi> or (as the word signifieth) endure and
suffer, to wit, the heavy weight of his earnest de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sire
to see them, and of his perplexing fear con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerning
them, he <hi>thought good,</hi> or (as the word
doth signifie) had an unexpressible affection rather
to be <hi>left alone</hi> in the midst of all his tribulations
<hi>at Athens,</hi> (whither he was driven out of <hi>Berea</hi>
by the fury of the Jews, <hi>Act. 17. 15.)</hi> than that
they should be longer destitute of one to supply
his absence among them in their great need and
hazard: whereby he did prefer their good in a
manner to his own. <hi>Doct.</hi> 1. Though the hypo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>critical
desires of wicked men after good are easily
quenched, at the first appearance of real or appre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hended
difficulties, <hi>Prov.</hi> 26. 13. yet the sincere
desires of the Godly are not so; but the more they
<pb n="106" facs="tcp:61385:57"/>
are opposed they are the more inflamed, and prove
the more vehement: for, <hi>Pauls</hi> sincere desire to see
the <hi>Thessalonians</hi> grew so vehement, that he could
not longer bear or endure the weight of it, and
that because it was opposed <hi>chap. 2. v.</hi> 18. as it
appears by the illative particle <hi>wherefore: where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
when we could not longer forbear.</hi> 2. There
can be no more pressing weight upon an holy heart,
than strong convictions of a duty necessary to be
gone about by him for the Churches good, and
the Lords seeming to stand in his way and to keep
him up from the performance of it. This is such
a weight that though the tender Christian may
stand under it for a time, yet what through fear of
some controversie which the Lord by crossing him
may be pursuing against him, <hi>Numb.</hi> 20. 12. with
<hi>Deut.</hi> 3. 25, 26. and what through grief for Gods
dishonour and the Churches hurt, by reason that
the duty lyeth undone, 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 4. 18, 19. it pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veth
almost insupportable at length: And where it
is thus, it argueth a tender frame of heart: for,
<hi>Paul</hi> being convinced it was his duty to visit this
Church, and being long impeded from it, doth look
upon his disappointment as an unsupportable
weight: <hi>when we could not longer forbear,</hi> or en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dure
and bear this weight. 3. Holy submission
and patience under cross dispensations, by which
the Child of God is retarded in the way of duty,
do no way abolish, but are well consistent with a
fervent desire and earnest endeavour, by all lawful
means to prosecute that duty wherein he is crossed:
Submission indeed removeth fretting impatience,
<hi>Act.</hi> 21. 14. but it quickneth holy desires and di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligence:
<pb n="107" facs="tcp:61385:57"/>
for, <hi>Paul,</hi> who as he reverenced God in
all cross dispensations, <hi>Phil.</hi> 4. 11. and so doubt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>less
also in this, doth yet use his utmost diligence
to compass the duty wherein he was crossed, and
for that end he <hi>thought good to be left at Athens
alone,</hi> by sending <hi>Timotheus</hi> to supply his absence.
4. Where there is love unfeigned, and a sincere
desire after the Churches good, it will make the
man indued with it postpone his own good and com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fort
unto theirs, to wit, his own temporal good
to their spiritual, 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 8. 18. yea his own con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veniency
to their necessity, both in things tempo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral
and spiritual, as here <hi>Pauls</hi> sincere and ardent
affection to their good, made him spoile himself of
all good company, and willing <hi>to be left at Athens
alone.</hi> 5. As in all duties, so especially in duties
of kindness to Christs afflicted members, it is not
so much to be attended what we do, as from what
inward principle we are acted: And particularly,
the more of cheerfulness and hearty affection go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth
along with our duty, it is the more praise-wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thy
and accepted both by God and man: and where
there is sincere love, what will it make a man not
do, endure or cheerfully suffer for the good of the
party loved? for, <hi>Pauls</hi> love to them made him
cheerfully and willingly deprive himself of all good
company for their sake, and the worth and accep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tableness
of what he did for them lyeth in this, that
he did it willingly: <hi>we thought good</hi> saith he, or
had an eager affection and good will <hi>to be left at
Athens alone.</hi>
               </p>
               <pb n="108" facs="tcp:61385:58"/>
               <q>Ver. 2. And sent Timotheus our brother and mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nister
of God, and our fellow labourer in the
Gospel of Christ, to establish you, and to comfort
you concerning your faith.</q>
               <p>He doth next shew what his fervent affection had
moved him to do for them, and for what end he
did it. He had sent <hi>Timotheus</hi> unto them; and
that he might shew his respect to them in the
worth of him whom he had sent, he doth com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mend
<hi>Timotheus</hi> from three Epithetes, as being,
first, <hi>a brother,</hi> the usual epithete of Christians,
<hi>Act.</hi> 11. 29. because they are born of God,
<hi>John</hi> 13. their one Father in Christ, <hi>Eph.</hi> 4. 6.
2. <hi>A minister of God,</hi> because of his office to
Preach the Gospel, 2 <hi>Tim. 4. 2. 3. Pauls fellow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>labourer,</hi>
because he was his joynt-collegue <hi>in the
Gospel,</hi> that is, in Preaching the Gospel. And the
end why he did then send him, was first, to confirm
or underprop them, (as the word signifieth) to
wit, lest they had been either drawn from the truth
by deceitful reasonings, <hi>Col.</hi> 2. 8. or driven from
it by force of persecution, <hi>Matth.</hi> 10. 22. Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>condly
to <hi>comfort them,</hi> the word signifieth both
to exhort and comfort, and he was sent for both,
not only to comfort them under their sad suffer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings,
but also to exhort them unto constancy not<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>withstanding
of them. Now the thing which he
was mainly to confirm them in, and by exhortation
to press upon them, is their <hi>faith,</hi> that is, their firm
assent and adhering to the truths of the Gospel.
<pb n="109" facs="tcp:61385:58"/>
                  <hi>Doct.</hi> 1. Holy desire and fervent love to duty is
most ingenious and witty to find out wayes for dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>charging
the duty, even when all ordinary access to
it doth seem to be obstructed: for, love and desire
in <hi>Paul</hi> to confirm and comfort these <hi>Thessalonians</hi>
in their need, makes him find out a way to do that
by another, which he could no wayes do him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>self:
<hi>And sent Timotheus—to establish you.</hi>
2. Church-guides, or judicatories, who are
charged with the oversight of several Congregati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons,
where they cannot in person officiate them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves
are not exonered by sending forth unto the
Lords Vineyard any who may be had, except they
employ the fittest, and such of whom there are
grounds of hope, that, through the Lords help he
may carry on the work for which he is sent: for,
<hi>Paul</hi> not being able to go himself, sends not every
one, but a man every way fitted for the work, even
<hi>Timotheus a brother,</hi> &amp;c. 3. As Ministers, espe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cially
they who are of elder standing, and best
known in the Church, are bound to give their de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>served
testimony unto others of the Lords servants,
for gaining them respect and credit among the
people of their charge: So then is a Minister suf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficiently
qualified and worthy to be commended as
a compleat Minister, when first he is a man in all
appearance truly pious, for, <hi>Paul</hi> commendeth
<hi>Timothy</hi> from this, he was a <hi>brother.</hi> 2. When
he is painful and laborious about his masters work:
<hi>Timotheus was a labourer.</hi> 3. When he is a
lover of unity, and entertaineth peace with others
of his masters servants, striving to work with them,
<pb n="110" facs="tcp:61385:59"/>
                  <hi>Phil.</hi> 1. 27. and not against them, in a way of his
own separate from them: <hi>Timotheus was a fellow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>labourer.</hi>
And 4. When he is a lover of truth,
as well as of peace, and studyeth unity but in so
far, as it thwareth not with vertue: for, he is com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mended
as <hi>a fellow-labourer in the Gospel of Christ.
Doct.</hi> 4. The office of an Evangelist, among other
things, (see upon <hi>Eph. 4. 11.)</hi> was to confirm
and establish in the faith those Churches which the
Apostles had already planted: for, <hi>Timotheus</hi> an
Evangelist <hi>(2 Tim. 4. 5.)</hi> was sent by <hi>Paul</hi> to
comfirm and <hi>establish</hi> this Church <hi>in the faith.</hi>
5. Such is Satans enmity against the grace of faith,
and so many are his onsets, what by one means,
what by another to brangle it, <hi>Luk.</hi> 22. 31, 32. as
knowing therein the believers great strength doth
lye, 1 <hi>Joh.</hi> 5. 4. that even the strongest faith hath
need of confirmation and establishment: And it is
the Godly mans wisdom and duty, in trying times,
to have a special care to guard his faith, as that grace
which not only Satan striveth to shake most, but
also upon the stability whereof the safety, strength
and vigour of his other graces depend much: for,
though <hi>Paul</hi> had praised their faith much, <hi>chap.
1.</hi> 8. yet he sends here to confirm it, and it espe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cially
more than any other of their graces: <hi>to esta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>blish
you concerning your faith,</hi> saith he. 6. A
singular means for strengthning faith under sad af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flictions
and tryals is for Ministers to hold out, and
people to embrace those excellent comforts, which
the word of truth holds forth to the Lords people
in suffering times: Our standing at a distance
<pb n="111" facs="tcp:61385:59"/>
from, and questioning our interest in those, do
breed discouragement and terrour, and thereby
make way for shameful fainting in duty, and foul
defection from truth, <hi>Heb.</hi> 12. 13. for, <hi>Timotheus</hi>
was sent both <hi>to establish and comfort them con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerning
their faith.</hi>
               </p>
               <q>Ver. 3. That no man should be moved by these af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flictions:
for your selves know that we are ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pointed
thereunto.</q>
               <p>He doth here shew, 1. The necessity at that time
of his sending <hi>Timotheus</hi> to establish them, to wit,
the prevention of an apparent hazard, lest any of
them, because of <hi>Pauls</hi> or their own <hi>afflictions,</hi>
should have been drawn away by flattery, or
shaken and <hi>moved</hi> from truth, like the taile of a
dog following upon his master (as the word sig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nifieth.)
2. And because the same hazard did yet
remain in part, he useth two arguments for their
present establishment against fainting, either under
his or their affliction. The first in this verse to
this purpose, They <hi>themselves knew,</hi> or were suffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciently
instructed from the doctrine of the Gospel,
that all Christs followers, <hi>Mark</hi> 8. 34. and chiefly
the Apostles, 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 4. 9. were appointed, or (as
the word is rendred, <hi>Luk. 2. 34.)</hi> set as a mark,
at which the arrows of affliction and persecution
are shot. Now they are thus appointed and set as
a mark for trouble by God, both in his eternal
counsel, <hi>Rom.</hi> 8. 29. and in his actual separating
them from the world by converting grace, 1 <hi>Pet.
<pb n="112" facs="tcp:61385:60"/>
2. 21. Doct.</hi> 1. A Ministers care should be ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tended
towards all and every one of his charge,
not only the great, the rich, the strong in grace,
and eminent, but even to the poor, the outwardly
base, contemptible, and to such as are but weak,
even babes in Christ, <hi>Heb.</hi> 5. 12, 13. and this, as
at all times, so especially when they are exercised
with sharp tryals and sore afflictions: for, <hi>Pauls</hi>
care was thus extended towards all at such a
time, as is implyed, while he saith, <hi>That no man
should be moved.</hi> 2. The Lords faithful servants
may be so much supported by grace under their
saddest sufferings, as that their fear and care will
be more exercised towards others of the Lords
people, and about the possible sinful consequences
of their trouble upon others, than any thing that
doth concern themselves: for, supponing the af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flictions
here spoken of to be <hi>Pauls</hi> own, as cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainly
his own are not excluded, we find him
more afraid of their stumbling, than careful of
himself: <hi>That no man,</hi> saith he, <hi>should be moved
at these afflictions.</hi> 3. As Christians under af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flictions
for truth are in hazard to be shaken,
brangled and tossed to and fro with the wind of
strong tentations, which take their rise from
thence: So the ordinary tentations wherewith
the Tempter doth assault afflicted Christians have
much of insinuating flattery in them, while he
seemeth to commiserate their present case, and
promiseth much contentment and ease if they
step but a little aside from the way of duty for
attaining to an outgate: for, the word rendred <hi>to
<pb n="113" facs="tcp:61385:60"/>
be moved</hi> signifieth to be shaken as a dogs taile,
and drawn away by flattery: <hi>That no man
should be moved by these afflictions.</hi> 4. So much
ought we to adore and reverence the Lords su<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pream
dominion and absolute providence, as pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sently
without debate to stoop and imbrace what<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>soever
lot is measured out unto us by it: for,
he perswades them to endure affliction without
fainting, from this, that they and others were
<hi>appointed thereunto by God.</hi> 5. The faith of this,
that the Lord hath firmly decreed to bring his
followers by the way of the cross to their crown,
and to make them first to suffer with Christ, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
they reign with him, is an excellent reme<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy
to stay and settle the believer against faint<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
and wavering under the sorest trouble:
for, this is the remedy prescribed here by <hi>Paul:
for we are appointed thereunto,</hi> saith he. 6. Scri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pture
comforts under afflictions cannot support
a man except he know them, and be acquainted
with them; and ignorance is often the cause of
our great impatience: for, he makes their know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge
of Gods appointment necessary in order to
their drawing comfort from it: <hi>for,</hi> saith he,
<hi>your selves know that we are appointed there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>unto.</hi>
               </p>
               <pb n="114" facs="tcp:61385:61"/>
               <q>Ver. 4. For verily when we were with you, we
told you before, that we should suffer tribula<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion,
even as it came to pass, and ye know.</q>
               <p>He confirmeth here what he said, of their know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
that Christians are appointed and called to
undergo a suffering lot, (as appeareth by the cau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sal
particle <hi>for)</hi> and withal doth add a second
argument to preserve them from fainting, to this
purpose, They themselves <hi>knew,</hi> and could bear
him witness, that when he was among them at
<hi>Thessalonica, Act. 17. 1, &amp;c.</hi> he had foretold
them that both he and they were to meet with
much tribulation from their oppressing persecu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tors:
which prediction was now made out and
verified by the event, and therefore there was no
occasion from them to faint because of affliction,
seeing they were so timously fore-warned of it.
<hi>Doct.</hi> 1. It is the duty of Christs Ministers to give
timous warning unto the Lords people of tryals
and hardships, which they cannot choose but en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>counter
in their Christian course, lest otherwise
when they are surprized with unexpected trouble,
they repent their undertaking and succumb,
<hi>Mark</hi> 14. 17. for, <hi>Paul</hi> did timously, and <hi>when
he was with them foretel that they should suffer
tribulation.</hi> 2. When the Lords servants have
an open door to Preach the Gospel unto a peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple,
they ought to stir their time, and instruct
their hearers in all necessary truths, as not know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
how soon the door may be shut, and the pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sent
opportunity of doing good removed, <hi>Prov.</hi>
                  <pb n="115" facs="tcp:61385:61"/>
27. 4. for, so did <hi>Paul, when he was with them,
he told</hi> them of all necessary truths, and of this in
particular, <hi>that we should suffer tribulation,</hi> saith
he. 3. That the Lords people have had timous
warning from the word of truth of their troubles
which will attend them in their Christian course,
it ought in reason to keep them from fainting and
stumbling at a cross, when they meet with one:
for, this is the Apostles scope in this verse, to
reason them up to a couragious frame of spirit
under tribulation, because he had told them before
of it. 4. As Ministers ought to be circumspect
in their predictions, foretelling nothing for cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain
but what the word of truth giveth ground
to believe that it shall undoubtedly come to pass;
lest otherwise, when the event doth not answer
the prediction, their Ministry be brought unto
contempt: So the fulfilling of such predictions
doth strongly confirm the truth of the word, and
underprop the believer in the faith of it, notwith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>standing
of any sad affliction or hardship he may
be under for adhering to it: for, <hi>Paul</hi> foretold
nothing but what the event did verifie, and from
this that the event did answer his prediction, he
doth perswade them not to faint, but to adhere to
truth, although they were under present trouble
for it: <hi>We told you before, that we should suffer
tribulation, even as it came to pass.</hi>
               </p>
               <pb n="116" facs="tcp:61385:62"/>
               <q>Ver. 5. For this cause when I could no longer
forbear, I sent to know your faith, lest by some
means the tempter have tempted you, and our la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bour
be in vain.</q>
               <p>The Apostle repeateth what he spoke, <hi>v.</hi> 1. and
2. of his sending <hi>Timotheus,</hi> and expresseth a third
end why he had sent him (for other two were
mentioned, <hi>v. 2.)</hi> and it was, that he might <hi>know
their faith,</hi> or their constancy in the faith: and he
closeth the verse by giving a reason why he desired
so much to know their faith, to wit, a twofold fear,
1. Lest Satan, who is here called <hi>the tempter,</hi>
(as being that eminent tempter) had taken occa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sion
from their present affliction for truth, to <hi>tempt</hi>
them one way or other to make defection from
it, and 2. Lest they had yielded to the tempter,
which is not expressed, but implyed in that, which
would have followed upon their defection, to wit,
the loss of <hi>Paul</hi>'s labour in Preaching the Gospel
among them, which in that case would have been
<hi>in vain</hi> and useless as to them, though not to him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>self,
2 <hi>Cor. 2. 15, 16. Doct.</hi> 1. The care of an
honest Minister towards the people of his charge
doth extend it self not only to their first conver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sion,
and the drawing them out of nature to a state
of grace; but also to their perseverance in that
state: for, <hi>Paul</hi> after he had been instrumental
in converting the <hi>Thessalonians,</hi> doth yet remain
solicitous about their perseverance: And <hi>there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
I sent,</hi> saith he, <hi>to know your faith.</hi> 2. A
faithful Minister doth not think himself exonered
<pb n="117" facs="tcp:61385:62"/>
when he hath discharged his duty before the peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple,
but will remain in a Christian manner soli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>citous
of the success of his pains among the flock,
when an hireling and time-server doth not much
trouble himself about any such thing, <hi>Joh.</hi> 10. 12.
for, <hi>Paul</hi> from this solicitous care doth send <hi>to
know their faith,</hi> and the fruit of his labours
among them. 3. There is an holy jealousie in
Christian love, whereby though it believe the
best, 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 13. 7. yet it feareth the worst, that
all lawful means may be made use of to prevent
it: for <hi>Paul</hi> from love doth fear, <hi>lest the tempter
had tempted them, and his labour be in vain.</hi>
4. As it is Satans trade to tempt, and to tempt
all men, good and bad, <hi>Luk. 22. 31. Eph. 2—2.</hi>
by all means, 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 11. 3. at all times, 1 <hi>Pet.
5.</hi> 8. and to all evil, 2 <hi>Thes.</hi> 2. 10. So he omitteth
no occasion of exercising this his woful trade with
advantage, 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 2. 11. and more particularly he
takes advantage of those cross dispensations, by
which the Lord doth exercise his people, to make
them cast at truth and piety: for, <hi>Paul</hi>'s<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> fear lest
Satan had taken occasion from their trouble to
tempt them, implyeth, his usual way is to tempt
on such an occasion: <hi>Lest by some means the tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pter
have tempted you.</hi> 5. So much do the best
of Saints lye open to Satans temptations, and so
ready are they, if left to themselves, to yield when
tempted, that a faithful Minister will have reason to
fear, to watch, to take heed to himself and the
flock, so long as there is a tempter to tempt: for,
<hi>Paul</hi> doth fear lest the best among them h<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>d been
tempted and succumbed: <hi>lest by some means the
<pb n="118" facs="tcp:61385:63"/>
tempter have tempted you.</hi> 6. Though the pains
and labour of a faithful Minister cannot be in vain
as to God, who doth alwayes gain his intent, <hi>Isa.
55.</hi> 10, 11. nor yet as to the Minister himself,
whose reward is with the Lord, <hi>Isa.</hi> 49. 4. yet as
to the people who make not use of his pains, or
make apostasie from that seeming good which
once they attained by them, they are alwayes in
vain and to no good purpose, yea a snare, <hi>Isa.
28.</hi> 13. and shall be for a testimony against them,
<hi>Mark</hi> 6. 11. for, <hi>Paul</hi> implyeth so much as that
if they had yielded to the tempter and made apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stasie
from the faith, <hi>his labour would have been in
vain among them.</hi>
               </p>
               <q>Ver. 6. But now when Timotheus came from you
unto us, and brought us good tydings of your
faith and charity, and that ye have good re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>membrance
of us alwayes, desiring greatly to see
us, as we also to see you.</q>
               <p>In the second part of the Chapter, the Apostle
being, in order to their further establishment in
the truth, to express yet more of his fervent af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fection
towards them, which was drawn out by
<hi>Timotheus</hi> his return from them, he doth, first, in
this verse shew what <hi>Timotheus</hi> did report of
them, when he had returned to <hi>Paul</hi> being now
at <hi>Corinth,</hi> as it appears from <hi>Act.</hi> 18. 1. with 5.
(though he was at <hi>Athens</hi> when he sent him,
<hi>v. 1.)</hi> and the summ of this report in general is
called <hi>good tydings, he brought us good tydings,</hi>
It is the same word in the original which signifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth
to Preach the Gospel, because the thing report<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
<pb n="119" facs="tcp:61385:63"/>
was the fruit and effect of the Gospel Preach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
among them, the hearing whereof was as the
Preaching of it over again unto <hi>Paul.</hi> 2. Those
good tydings in particular were the report he
made, 1. Of their faith, or, of their stedfastness in
the faith, 2. Of their <hi>love,</hi> or sanctified practice
according to both tables of the law flowing from
faith, for love is the fulfilling of the Law, <hi>Gal.</hi> 6. 2.
3. Of their special love and respect to <hi>Paul,</hi> made
evident, 1. By their <hi>good remembrance</hi> of him,
or that respective mention which they made of his
labour, diligence and his whole Ministerial carriage
among them, and that <hi>alwayes</hi> when they had oc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>casion
to speak of him. 2. By their earnest desire
to see him, The word in the Original signifieth such
a desire as is, in a kind, impatient of delays. And lest
he had seemed hereby to have reflected upon him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>self,
who had so long delayed to satisfie their long<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
desire, he adds in the close, that his desire was
no less ardent to see them, though he was hindred
without any default of his, <hi>chap. 2. 18. Doct.</hi> 1.
An Evangelist, one of the extraordinary officers in
the new Testament, did herein among other things
differ from an ordinary Minister, he was not tyed
unto any charge, but being sent out by the Apostles
to water such Churches as they had planted, (see
<hi>v. 2.)</hi> he did there remain, not constantly, but
for a certain time, until the Apostles should have
further work for him elsewhere: for, <hi>Timotheus</hi>
being sent to <hi>Thessalonica</hi> by <hi>Paul</hi> did not reside
there, but returned within a little to be disposed of
by <hi>Paul</hi> as he thought good: <hi>But now when Timo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>theus
came from you unto us.</hi> 2. The Lord doth
<pb n="120" facs="tcp:61385:64"/>
powerfully overrule and turn about the deepest de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>signs
of Satan against his work to the furtherance
of it, as if they had been purposely contrived for
that end: for, Satan by hindering <hi>Paul</hi> to go to
<hi>Thessalonica, chap.</hi> 2. 18. got no advantage but de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>triment,
in so far as when <hi>Paul</hi> was converting
souls to God, first at <hi>Athens,</hi> next at <hi>Corinth, Ti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>motheus</hi>
was confirming the Church at <hi>Thessalonica:
when Timotheus came from you unto us,</hi> which
supponeth he had been with them, and Satan could
not hinder that. 3. That the work of Gods grace
doth thrive among a people is good tydings from
them, and such good tydings may be had even from
persecuted Christians: for, those were the tydings
which <hi>Timotheus</hi> did report from this persecuted
Church, and they are called good tydings: <hi>he
brought us good tydings of your faith,</hi> &amp;c. 4. The
Lords way with his work and people doth often
soare so high above all probable means, that it dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>appoints
and abundantly refutes our anxious, and
sometimes misbelieving fears: So was it here <hi>v.</hi> 5.
he feared they had yielded to the tempter in his ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sence
from them at a time of so great need, but now
he finds it was otherwise, the Lord having supplyed
the want of <hi>Paul</hi> by some other way: <hi>He brought
us good tydings of your faith and charity.</hi> 5. The
best tydings which can be reported of any, is that
he is a believer in Jesus Christ, a maintainer of
charity and good works in his own practice, and one
that accounteth highly of the faithful servants of
Jesus Christ: And as all those three are alwayes
conjoyned, so nothing almost worth the hearing
can be reported of any, in whom all or any of those
<pb n="121" facs="tcp:61385:64"/>
are wanting: for, the good tydings which he re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ported
were, <hi>of your faith and charity and that
ye have good remembrance of us,</hi> saith <hi>Paul.</hi>
6. Though none who are truly Godly ought to be
excluded from our special love, yet some may
justly challenge a choice room in our affections
above others, according to our special interest in
them, and stricter tye unto them by nature, 1 <hi>Tim.
5.</hi> 4. by cohabitation, 1 <hi>Tim.</hi> 5. 8. by favours re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived
from them, 1 <hi>Sam.</hi> 18. 1. by their greater
usefulness in the work of God, 2 <hi>Sam.</hi> 18. 3. and
because of a greater measure of Gods grace
shining in them: for, they made evident their spe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cial
love unto <hi>Paul</hi> beyond others, by their <hi>good
remembrance of him, and desire to see him.</hi>
7. Among all those who may justly claim, and do
most easily obtain a choise room in the child of
God his affections above others, a gracious Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nister
whom the Lord hath made instrumental for
his conversion is with the first: for, <hi>Paul</hi> had been
an instrument of their conversion, and therefore he
shareth most deeply in their love: <hi>and that ye have
good remembrance of us,</hi> saith he. 8. As Christi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>an
love doth vent it self in speaking the best of the
party loved; so it differeth much as to this effect,
from popular applause, Christian love is a constant
friend, but popular applause is most uncertain,
<hi>Matth.</hi> 21. 9. with 27. 22, 23. for, herein did
they evidence their Christian affection to <hi>Paul that
they had good remembrance of him always.</hi> 9. Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stian
love, and especially that which is betwixt a
faithful Pastor and a gracious people of his charge,
doth earnestly long to evidence it self in Christian
<pb n="122" facs="tcp:61385:65"/>
fellowship for the mutual comfort and spiritual
advantage of both the parties, <hi>Rom.</hi> 1. 11, 12.
for, so did their love to <hi>Paul,</hi> and his to them:
<hi>desiring greatly to see us, as we also to see you,</hi>
saith he.</p>
               <q>Ver. 7. Therefore, brethren, we are comforted
over you in all our affliction and distress, by
your faith.</q>
               <p>The Apostle, in prosecution of the former scope,
doth next shew what effects these good tidings
had wrought in him, they are in number four, The
first whereof is comfort, expressed here to this
purpose, That whereas his mind was otherwise op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pressed
and perplexed with fear, <hi>v.</hi> 5. he was now
<hi>comforted,</hi> or recreated over them, or by what he
heard of them, and especially by their faith, or by
the testimony which he heard of it. Which effect
of comfort is heightned from this, that hereby the
bitterness of all the <hi>affliction</hi> and <hi>distress</hi> of any sort
(for therefore is it expressed in two words) whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
by-past or present, which he had endured ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
with them, or after his removal from them,
was wonderfully sweetned. <hi>Doct.</hi> 1. Christian
love doth make it self evident in a fellow feeling
sympathie with the case of those to whom it is ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tended,
and the more there is of love, there will
be the more Christian sympathie: for, to evidence
his ardent affection towards them he sheweth how
he sympathized with them; their affliction and
apparent hazard of defection did perplex him, <hi>v.</hi> 5.
and good tydings from them did comfort him:
<pb n="123" facs="tcp:61385:65"/>
                  <hi>Therefore, brethren, we were comforted,</hi> saith he.
2. The Lord doth usually reward a tender frame
of spirit in bearing burthen with the Church and
people of God in their hazard and afflicted case,
by giving the person so disposed the more of com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fort
and soul-ravishing joy arising from the Chur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ches
better case; Those only who mourn with
<hi>Zion</hi> are priviledged to rejoice with her, <hi>Isa.
66.</hi> 10. for, <hi>Paul</hi> was much afflicted with their
hazard, <hi>v.</hi> 5. and now he is much comforted,
having heard of Gods goodness to them under it:
<hi>we were comforted,</hi> and <hi>v. 8. now we live.</hi> 3. The
Lord doth usually exercise his dearest children
with vicissitude of contrary affections, such as sor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>row
and joy, fear and freedom of mind; weeping
may endure for a night, but joy cometh in the
morning, <hi>Psal.</hi> 30. 6. and this because, so impo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tent
are we, that we cannot well carry a full mea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sure
of any one of those, for any length of time,
without miscarrying one way or other, <hi>Psal. 30.
6,</hi> 7. for, <hi>Paul</hi> was so exercised; before he was
perplexed, <hi>v. 5. but now he was comforted,</hi> before
he was as dead, but now, <hi>we live,</hi> saith he, <hi>v. 8.
Doct.</hi> 4. The believers joy and comfort do not de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pend
upon his freedom and actual deliverance from
outward or inward trouble, but upon the Lords
comforting presence, who often takes occasion
from his kind dealing with others to pour in upon
the believers spirit so full a measure of spiritual
joy and comfort, that in a manner the bitterness
of all his own trouble is forgot and swallowed up
in the sweetness of it: for, thus was it with <hi>Paul:
We were comforted over you in all your affliction
<pb n="124" facs="tcp:61385:66"/>
and distress.</hi> 5. From this, that he expresseth on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
their faith as the rise of his comfort, though <hi>Ti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>motheus</hi>
had reported of their other graces, see
upon <hi>v. 2. doct. 5. by your faith,</hi> saith he.</p>
               <q>Ver. 8. For now we live, if ye stand fast in the Lord.</q>
               <p>He doth here illustrate and confirm what he
spoke of his comfort, as appeareth by the causal
particle <hi>for,</hi> and withall express the second effect
of those glad tydings to this purpose, That <hi>if,</hi> or
<hi>seeing</hi> (as the word may read) they <hi>stood fast,</hi>
or were couragiously constant (as the word im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plyeth)
in the faith, whereby they were united to
the Lord Christ, he was thereby made to live, that
is, of a cheerful spirit, all things went with him
according to his wish, for men are said in a sense
to live when their concernments succeed accord<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
to their mind, and somewhat beyond their ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pectation,
to the disappointment of their fear, <hi>Gen.
45. 27. Doct.</hi> 1. To rob a man of his comfort,
and thereby to dead his sp<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="2 letters">
                     <desc>••</desc>
                  </gap>its, and make his life
bitter, is a kind of murther in Gods esteem, for it
takes away that which here the Apostle doth call
<hi>life,</hi> to wit, the cheerfulness of his spirit, through
the want whereof he did formerly look upon him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>self
as dead; as is implyed, while he saith, <hi>for
now we live.</hi> 2. As the good of an honest Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nister
his pains amongst the Lords people redounds
to himself in some respect, and is not wholly re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>served
for him until afterwards, but is in part be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stowed
upon him even in this life, in so far, as
not only his inward, but also his outward man is
thereby bettered, his very natural spirits are there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by
<pb n="125" facs="tcp:61385:66"/>
cheered; and consequently his strength preser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved,
and in an ordinary way his life prolonged:
So his want of success, and growth of wickedness
among the people of his charge, in despite of all
his endeavours to the contrary, is sufficient to
dead his spirits, to eat up his cheerfulness, and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sequently
cut his dayes: for, the one of those doth
follow upon the other, and the former is evident<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
implyed, while <hi>Paul</hi> affirms that his life, or a
cheerful frame of spirit did flow from their con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stancy
in the faith: <hi>now we live if ye stand fast
in the Lord.</hi>
               </p>
               <q>Ver. 9. For what thanks can we render to God
again for you, for all the joy wherewith we
joy for your sakes before our God.</q>
               <p>He doth confirm and illustrate what he spoke, of
his cheerful frame of spirit, and withall expresseth
the third effect of those good tydings, to this pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pose:
he did <hi>for their sake,</hi> or by their means,
reap so much spiritual and sincere joy (called here,
<hi>joy before God)</hi> as he could never in way of thank<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fulness
to God express to the full, and as the cause
required, his present sense of Gods love, which
had bestowed upon him so rich a mercy: for such
questions as this, <hi>what thanks can we render,</hi> &amp;c.
do usually imply somewhat above expression, and
cannot<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> well be answered, <hi>Psal.</hi> 84. 1. and 119. 97—<hi>Doct.</hi> 1.
Gods ordinary way of dealing with ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ercised
Christians is, The lower they are brought
under sad and weighty exercise, to make their
comfort and joy, accompanying their outgate, so
<pb n="126" facs="tcp:61385:67"/>
much the more to abound: See 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 1. 5. for,
<hi>Paul</hi> who was pressed down, and brought so low
with a twofold weight of desire and fear, that he
could not longer forbear, <hi>v.</hi> 5. is now as much
exalted, that he cannot find words sufficient to ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>press
the sweetness of his case: he was <hi>comforted,</hi>
v. 7. <hi>he did live,</hi> v. 8. and here, he had joy, and
all joy: <hi>for all the joy, wherewith we joy,</hi> saith
he. 2. As the Lord doth sometimes furnish his
people with more than ordinary matter of joy,
and such as they cannot contain, but must express
their sense thereof with cheerfulness and good will:
So they ought, and in some measure will have a
watchful eye, that in all such expressions of joy,
they vent nothing that is carnal, sinful or unseemly,
but what beseemeth such as are alwayes in Gods
sight, and are especially then most narrowly mark<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed,
and taken notice of by his all-seeing eye: for,
<hi>Paul</hi> having such matter of joy, while he is about
to express it, doth set himself in Gods sight<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> 
                  <hi>for
all the joy,</hi> saith he, <hi>wherewith we joy before our
God.</hi> 3. Whatever matter of joy a man may have,
he cannot improve it, nor attain to the actual ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ercise
of solid and spiritual joy, except his interest
in God be in some measure cleared, whose recon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciled
face doth put such a ravishing lustre upon all
our other mercies, as they draw out the heart
actually to rejoice in them, or rather in God for
them: See <hi>Psal.</hi> 4. 6. for, though <hi>Paul</hi> had mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
of joy from the former good tydings, yet he
doth not actually rejoice, until he close with God
as his through Christ, as is implyed, while he saith,
<hi>for all the joy, wherewith we joy before our God.</hi>

4. Christian love, to those who are Gods, doth
give the person who loveth, an interest in all the
good things bestowed by God upon those whom
he loveth, and a large share of all the joy and com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fort,
which are occasioned by them: for, <hi>Paul</hi> to
make evident his ardent affection to these <hi>Thessa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lonians,</hi>
doth shew, that their merciful receipts
did give him matter of all joy: <hi>for all the joy,</hi>
saith he, <hi>wherewith we joyed for your sakes,</hi> that
is, for Gods mercies towards them, mentioned,
<hi>v. 6. Doct.</hi> 5. Whoever are, or may be, the oc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>casion
of joy, by furnishing matter for it, yet a
Godly heart will not rest upon them, but look to
the Lord above all, ascribing praise and thanks<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>giving
to him, who not only giveth the cause and
occasion of joy, by making instruments to be that
which they are, matter of joy and not of grief,
<hi>Psal.</hi> 20. 9. but also doth give us to improve that
matter of joy unto actual rejoycing, which other<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wise
we could not, <hi>Eccles.</hi> 2. 24. for <hi>Paul,</hi> though
he had the matter of his joy furnished from the
<hi>Thessalonians,</hi> yet he looks over them to God, and
returns him thanksgiving for it: <hi>what thanks can
we render unto God, for all our joy,</hi> saith he.
6. As giving of thanks is all the rent, which either
the Lord doth crave, or we can return unto him,
for favours received: So no thanksgiving of ours
can be lookt upon as an answerable return to the
meanest of mercies; and especially a Godly heart
can never satisfie himself in the matter of his
thankfulness to the Lord, he prizeth the mercy
received so high, and seeth his thanks to be so
feckless, that he judgeth all he can do of no value,
<pb n="128" facs="tcp:61385:68"/>
and no wayes answerable to what so rich mercy in
God doth call for; for, <hi>Paul</hi> seeth that thanks<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>giving
was his due, but cannot satisfie himself, in
any thing he could do of that kind, as is implyed,
while he saith, <hi>what thanks can we render to God
for all the joy,</hi> &amp;c.</p>
               <q>Ver. 10. Night and day praying exceedingly,
that we might see your face, and might perfect
that which i<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap> lacking in your faith?</q>
               <p>Here is the fourth effect, of those glad tidings
upon <hi>Paul,</hi> he was thereby put to his prayers,
which were, 1. Assiduous, the phrase <hi>night and
day</hi> implyeth such an assiduity, as admits of no
other, but necessary intermissions, <hi>Luk.</hi> 2. 37. next,
it was fervent and serious, so much is implyed in
his praying <hi>exceedingly,</hi> or as it is in the original,
excessively, intimating fervency of affection.
3. The thing prayed for, was 1. To see them, or
to be present with them. 2. That being with
them, he might have occasion by his Preaching to
them, and conversing with them, to perfect, supply
and make up (as an instrument under God, 1 <hi>Cor.
3. 5.)</hi> what was lacking and wanting in their
faith, whether in their understanding, as to their
knowledge of, or assent unto truths revealed; or
in their will and affections, as to their imbracing
of, and adherence unto that good thing, held forth
by those truths. <hi>Doct.</hi> 1. There can be no such
cause of thanksgiving in this life, but there will be
also matter for prayer, and an incumbent necessity
to go about that duty, there being always somewhat
<pb n="129" facs="tcp:61385:68"/>
wanting to the best, and necessary to be had<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> 
                  <hi>Phil. 3.
12.</hi> And prayer being a prime mean appointed of God
for obtaining of what we want, <hi>Ezek.</hi> 36. 37. for,
though <hi>Paul</hi> had at this time such matter of thanks<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>giving,
that he could not well express it, <hi>v<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>
                  </hi> 9. yet
he is assiduous in prayer: <hi>night and day praying
exceedingly.</hi> 2. Our prayers to God should be
both assiduous and serious, the former without the
latter being but vain babling, condemned <hi>Matth.
6.</hi> 7. and the latter without the former but a violent,
evanishing flash, to no purpose, condemned <hi>Isa.
26.</hi> 16. for, his prayers had those two properties:
<hi>night and day praying exceedingly,</hi> saith he.
3. There is a singular efficacy and aptness in a
Ministers presence and preaching, through the
Lords blessing, to beget, confirm, or carry on the
work of grace in hearers, beyond what there is
in his writings, while he is absent: There is not
only a more express promise of a blessing unto
Preaching, <hi>Rom.</hi> 10. 17. but also there is nothing
almost in a man, whom God hath sent to gain
souls, whether carriage, gesture, or countenance,
which the Lord doth not make subservient unto
edification one way or other, 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 9. 22. for,
therefore is it that <hi>Paul,</hi> not content with writing
to them, doth so much desire to see their face,
that <hi>he might perfect that which was lacking in
their faith.</hi> 4. As the faith of the best hath its
own inlaicks, and most eminent believers have need
to pray, <hi>Lord increase our faith,</hi> Luke 17. 5. so
faith is preserved and increased in the use of those
means, by which it was begotten at first: It is be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gotten
by ordinances, and especially by the word
<pb n="130" facs="tcp:61385:69"/>
Preached, and it is preserved and receiveth in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crease
by ordinances and the publick Preaching of
the word: for, though <hi>Paul</hi> did highly commend
their faith, <hi>chap.</hi> 1. 3. yet somewhat was lacking
to it, and he prayeth he may see them, that by
Preaching to them he might perfect that <hi>which was
lacking in their faith.</hi>
               </p>
               <q>Ver. 11. Now God himself and our father, and
our Lord Jesus Christ direct our way unto
you.</q>
               <p>The Apostle having but made mention <hi>(v. 10.)</hi>
of his usual practice in praying, doth here, in the
third part of the Chapter, break out in a most fer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vent
and devout prayer, and thereby maketh way
for the second principal part of this Epistle, which
beginneth <hi>chap.</hi> 4. In which prayer, there is first,
the party to whom he prayeth, <hi>God himself,</hi> ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken
here personally, for the first person, therefore
is it added <hi>Our Father,</hi> and he is contradistin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guished
to Christ Jesus our Lord, the second per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son,
to whom also the Apostle prayeth. 2. There
is the matter prayed for, 1. Th<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="2 letters">
                     <desc>••</desc>
                  </gap> all Obstacles and
impediments being removed, he might get a suc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cessful
journey, and be directed by providence,
as in a right line, towards them, as the word in
the original doth signifie. <hi>Doct.</hi> 1. So necessary,
and of so universal use, is this duty of prayer, that
our heart should be constantly kept in such a
readiness to it, that when ever the least opportuni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty
is offered, we may set about it: yea and where
a man is fervent in prayer, he will l<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>y hold upon
<pb n="131" facs="tcp:61385:69"/>
every occasion to break out in it: for, <hi>Paul</hi> having
but made mention of Prayer, <hi>v.</hi> 10. and seeing
some necessity of praying presently, cannot con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain
himself, but sets about it: <hi>now God himself
and our father,</hi> &amp;c. 2. That Jesus Christ is
God equal with the Father, appeareth hence, that
not only divine worship, but also divine proper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties,
in over-ruling by his providence the affairs
of men, are ascribed to him: for, <hi>Paul</hi> doth pray
unto him, and seeketh a successful journey from
him: <hi>Our Lord Jesus Christ direct our way.</hi>
3. Though the object of divine worship be but
one and the same glorious God, <hi>Matth.</hi> 4. 10.
and there is but one kind of divine worship, to
wit, that which is supream, and becometh this
one infinite majesty of God, and therefore what<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever
person of the Godhead be expresly named
in our prayers, the rest are not excluded, but
included in that one, they being all three one only
God, the same in essence, 1. <hi>Joh.</hi> 5. 7. yet it is
not only lawful, but also sometimes convenient,
(though not alwayes necessary) to name ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>presly
in our prayers the distinct persons, and
especially Jesus Christ the second person with the
Father, thereby to strengthen our confidence for
acceptation and an answer, seeing there is no ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cess
to the Father but by him<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> 
                  <hi>Joh.</hi> 14. 6. for,
<hi>Paul</hi> here doth expresly direct his prayer both to
the Father and the Son: <hi>Now God himself and the
Father, and our Lord Jesus Christ.</hi> 4. The Lords
most powerful providence, doth over-rule the
most malicious designs of Satan against his work
and people, so that he could easily mar the pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>secution
<pb n="132" facs="tcp:61385:70"/>
of them, when at their greatest height, if
he did not sometimes judge the contrary more con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venient,
for his own glory and his peoples good,
<hi>Psal.</hi> 76. 10. for, <hi>Paul</hi> could not otherwise pray
in faith unto God, for a successful journey, when
he knew Satan did ply his utmost to hinder it,
<hi>Chap. 2. 18. now God himself direct our way un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to
you,</hi> saith he, <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 word">
                     <desc>〈◊〉</desc>
                  </gap> Seeing it is not in man to
direct his own way, <hi>Jer.</hi> 10. 23. therefore he
ought to wait and depend on Gods direction, for
all his undertakings: and this both for light, that
he may know what, when, and how he should do,
<hi>Psal.</hi> 27. 11. and for strength, to enable him for,
and bear him through, against difficulties in the
performance, <hi>Eph.</hi> 3. 16. for, so doth <hi>Paul<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap> now
God himself—direct our way unto you.</hi>
               </p>
               <q>Ver. 12. And the Lord make<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> you to increase and
abound in love one towards another, and towards
all men, even as we do towards you.</q>
               <p>A second thing he prayed for, is, that whether
he came unto them or not, the <hi>Lord</hi> himself might
supply his absence, by making them grow abun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dantly,
and beyond all ordinary measure (as the
doubling of the word, <hi>increase</hi> and <hi>abound,</hi> doth
imply) in the grace and duties of love, first, <hi>one
to another,</hi> and among themselves who were Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stians:
next, generally <hi>towards all men,</hi> even
Heathens. And in the close of the verse, he casts
in one incitement to the exercise of this grace,
from his own example and practice towards them.
<hi>Doct.</hi> 1. Though the Lord doth usually work by
<pb n="133" facs="tcp:61385:70"/>
ordinary means; yet we may not <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>ye him abso<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lutely
to them, but under want of means ought
to depend upon him, to supply their lack: for,
<hi>Paul</hi> depends on God, for making them grow in
love, even though he himself should not come to
them: <hi>And the Lord make you to increase.</hi> 2. As
not only the first beginnings, but also the growth
and progress of grace do come from God, and
therefore are to be sought from him by prayer:
So we need not fear, while we plead with God
for spiritual mercies, lest we exceed and seek too
much: for, <hi>Paul</hi> seeketh that he may make them
grow abundantly, and beyond all ordinary mea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sure
—: <hi>and the Lord make you increase and
abound.</hi> 3. As it should be a believers aime to
grow in grace: so he should labour in this study
after growth, both to extend himself to the exer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cise
of more graces, as is enjoyned, 2 <hi>Pet.</hi> 1. 5.
and to better the exercise of one and the same
grace, so as to grow more frequent, copious, and
spiritual in it, as is injoined, <hi>chap.</hi> 5. 16, 17. for,
<hi>Pauls</hi> praying for growth shews, we should en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deavour
it, and the two words he useth to express
this growth are made by some to differ thus, that
the first may signifie to increase in number, the
second in heap or bulk: <hi>now the Lord make you
to increase and abound in love.</hi> 4. As Christian
love ought, and will be mutual among real Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stians:
So it is not mercenary, nor doth extend it
self unto those only from whom the Christian may
expect a return of love again, but to others also,
from whom nothing of that kind can be had, even
to all men; and that because of Gods command,
<pb n="134" facs="tcp:61385:71"/>
                  <hi>Matth.</hi> 5. 44. and that there is somewhat love-worthy
in all, <hi>Rom.</hi> 2. 15. though abused and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>faced
by the most, <hi>Rom.</hi> 1. 21. for, he prayeth that
they, being Christians, <hi>may abound in love,</hi> first,
<hi>towards one another,</hi> and next, <hi>towards all men.</hi>
5. A Minister's own example, and sanctified pra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctice,
according to the truth he preacheth, is one
of the strong inducements unto a people to give
him obedience in what he prescribeth: and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
though a profane man may preach <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>o pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pose,
<hi>Matth.</hi> 7. 22, 23. yet his preaching is not
usually so much accompanied with fruit and suc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cess,
1 <hi>Tim.</hi> 4. 16. for, <hi>Paul</hi> alleadgeth his own
practice, as an inducement: <hi>even as we do towards
you,</hi> saith he.</p>
               <q>Ver. 13. To the end he may stablish your hearts
unblameable in holiness before God, even our
Father, at the coming of our Lord Jesus Christ,
with all his Saints.</q>
               <p>Here is a third thing prayed for, in order to
which their growing in love was presently sought,
as it appears from the word of connexion betwixt
the verses: and it is, that thereby, as by one mean,
the Lord might first, confirm and establish them
in holiness, so as they should not be easily
moved, or driven from the solid practice of it.
And next, that by both those, to wit, their growth
in love, and stability in holiness, their <hi>hearts</hi> or
consciences (so called, 1 <hi>Joh. 3. 19, 20.)</hi> might
be rendred <hi>blemeless,</hi> or without complaint, (as
it may be well taken in an active sense) his mean<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
<pb n="135" facs="tcp:61385:71"/>
is, that their consciences may be pacified, yea
and absolve, and pass sentence in their favours, and
this before the bar and tribunal of <hi>God their</hi> recon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciled
father, the full accomplishment of which wish
should be at <hi>Christs</hi> second <hi>coming,</hi> when he shall
come accompanied <hi>with all his Saints,</hi> or (as the
original may read) his holy ones, that is, either
his holy Angels, 2 <hi>Thes.</hi> 1. 7. or the holy souls
of the Saints departed, who shall come down with
Christ, to be united and glorified with their bodies.
See the same effect of pacifying the conscience
ascribed to grown love, 1 <hi>John</hi> 3. 19. and 4. 18.
and it is ascribed to love and holiness, as to that
which doth evidence our interest in Christs blood,
<hi>John</hi> 13. 35. by the only merit and worth whereof
we have peace with God, <hi>Rom. 5. 1. Doct.</hi> 1.
Though Children, and those who are weak in
grace, be tossed to and fro with every tentation,
<hi>Ephes.</hi> 4. 14. yet grown, and growing Christians,
are not so easily shaken: Growth in Grace is ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>companied
with stability, both in truth and holi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness:
for, <hi>Paul</hi> teacheth so much, while having
prayed, <hi>v.</hi> 12. for growth in grace, he addeth
here, <hi>To the end he may stablish your hearts un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>blameable
in holiness.</hi> 2. It concerneth a Christi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>an
much, by all means to endeavour that his heart
and conscience may be without complaint, speak
peace unto him and absolve him; seeing if a mans
heart and conscience upon good ground condemn
him, much more will God, who is greater than the
heart, and whose deputy the conscience is, 1 <hi>Joh.
3.</hi> 20. for, <hi>Paul</hi> prayeth here that their hearts; or
consciences, may be <hi>unblameable</hi> and without com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plaint.
<pb n="136" facs="tcp:61385:72"/>
3. As a man, in making his heart and
conscience pass sentence upon his state and way,
should sift himself in Gods sight, and endeavour
that his conscience pass such a sentence upon all, as
he thinks God the Judge of all will pass: So in
this enquiry and process, he should look upon God
as a fatherly Judge, who will pass sentence as a
Father<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> according to the Covenant of Grace, and
not as a strict sin-pursuing Judge, according to
the Covenant of Works: for, he wishes that <hi>their
hearts</hi> may be <hi>unblameable</hi> or without complaint
<hi>before God,</hi> that is, when sifted as in his sight, and
calleth him <hi>our Father,</hi> to shew in what relation
he should be taken up. 4. Though it be the alone
blood of Christ apprehended by faith that purifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth
the conscience, and gives it ground to absolve
and speak peace; seeing by it alone provoked Ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stice
is satisfied, and we are justified, whereupon
our peace with God doth follow, <hi>Rom.</hi> 5. 1. yet in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>herent
holiness doth also quiet the conscience in its
own order and way, to wit, though not meritori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ously,
and by way of satisfaction to the claim of
justice, for all our righteousnesses are as filthy rags,
<hi>Isa.</hi> 64. 6. yet by way of evidence, and as a faithful
witness of our undoubted interest in Christ, and
right to his blood, 1 <hi>Joh.</hi> 3. 14. for, <hi>Paul</hi> prayeth
that <hi>their hearts</hi> or consciences may be <hi>unblameable,</hi>
without complaint, or pacified in holiness. 5. Though
the meanest measure of sincere holiness be a <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>uffici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ent
evidence in it self of an interest in Christ, and
consequently may quiet the conscience, <hi>Mat.</hi> 5. 6.
yet that a man may clearly discern this evidence,
and get his conscience actually, and upon good
<pb n="137" facs="tcp:61385:72"/>
ground quiet by it, it's necessary that he grow in
grace, and be established in holiness, otherwise his
peace is more lyable to be questioned and shaken
by every new assault: for, <hi>Paul</hi> ascribeth this ef<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect
of pacifying the conscience to growth in grace,
and stability in holiness, while having prayed for
their growing in grace, he addeth, <hi>to the end he
may stablish your hearts unblameable in holiness.</hi>
6. However believers do enjoy much<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>sweet peace,
<hi>Rom.</hi> 5. 1. and some clear evidences of a right to
Christ in their begun sanctification, even while
they are here, <hi>Cant.</hi> 6. 3. yet the full accomplish<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
of their begun happiness is reserved until
Christs second coming: Many things are wanting
now, even to those who have most, 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 6. 6.
which shall be then made up: Our holiness shall
then be perfected, and we confirmed in it, our peace
extended as a river, neither shall our consciences
afterwards ever smite or accuse: for, he sheweth,
the term, when we shall be fully established in holi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness,
and our consciences throughly pacified, shall
be <hi>at the coming of our Lord Jesus Christ, with
all his Saints.</hi>

<hi>v.</hi> 23. of <hi>chap.</hi> 5. to press up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
them the practice of an holy
life, he doth in the first part of this
Chapter propone several exhorta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions
to that purpose. The first is, to the study of
holiness and sanctification in general, <hi>v.</hi> 1. in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>forced,
1. From his manifold injunctions of this
kind, he had given them already, <hi>v.</hi> 2. 2. It was
the will of God that they should so walk, <hi>v.</hi> 3.
Next, the following exhortations do press their ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ercise
of some particular vertues, and branches of
that sanctification presently mentioned: As 1. the
exercise of chastity, <hi>v.</hi> 4. and abstinence from all
uncleanness contrary to it, <hi>v.</hi> 3, 5. 2. The ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ercise
of Justice and equity, in abstinence from all
sort of oppression. And both these are inforced,
because, 1. Otherwise God would plague them,
<hi>v.</hi> 6. Next from the end of their calling, to wit,
their sanctification, <hi>v.</hi> 7. Thirdly their disobedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence
would be a despising of God, <hi>v.</hi> 8. The third
exhortation is to the exercise of brotherly love,
which he presseth indirectly from their progress
herein already, <hi>v.</hi> 9, 10. And 4. he exhorts to
quietness of spirit, opposite to Idleness and curio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sity,
<hi>v.</hi> 11. Because 1. of publick honesty; 2. Of
private utility, <hi>v.</hi> 12.</p>
               <p>In the second part of the Chapter, he propones
<pb n="139" facs="tcp:61385:73"/>
several considerations to allay immoderate grief for
the death of friends: As 1. their death is but a
sleep, <hi>v.</hi> 13. 2. They shall undoubtedly arise,
<hi>v.</hi> 14. 3. They shall be in no worse case at Christs
second coming than the Godly, who shall be then
found alive, <hi>v.</hi> 15. yea they shall have the advan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tage
of them, as being to be first raised, and before
those, others shall be changed, <hi>v.</hi> 16. 4. After
their resurrection the Godly of both sorts shall
meet together, and both of them with Christ.
5. They shall never part again, <hi>v.</hi> 17. And so he
concludes, by pointing at the use which they were
to make of all those considerations, <hi>v.</hi> 18.</p>
               <q>Ver. 1. FVrthermore, then we beseech you,
brethren, and exhort you by the Lord
Jesus, that as ye have received of us how ye
ought to walk, and to please God, so ye would
abound more and more.</q>
               <p>He doth here, and to <hi>v.</hi> 3. propone and urge a
general exhortation, which is a comprehensive
summ of all the rest, which he is to press upon
them afterward. And having made a transition
from the preceding doctrine, by the word <hi>further<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>more</hi>
(implying, as the original beareth, there
did somewhat yet remain necessary to be added)
he doth in the name and authority of <hi>the Lord Je<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sus,</hi>
and for his sake exhort them, and that both
lovingly (as the word rendred, <hi>beseech,</hi> implyeth)
and seriously, as his using two words to the same
purpose doth import. And the thing unto which
he exhorts them is, that according to the doctrine<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
                  <pb n="140" facs="tcp:61385:74"/>
and injunctions they had formerly <hi>received</hi> of
him, while he was with them, pointing out both
the necessity and manner of such <hi>a walk</hi> and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>versation,
as might be acceptable unto and please
the Lord; so they would abound, more and more,
that is, supposing they had already entred this walk
(as is expresly affirmed, <hi>chap. 1. v. 3.)</hi> he would
have them now to make continual progress, and in
a manner to outstrip themselves by their future di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligence.
Besides what I have observed already up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
the cohesion of the doctrinal and practical part
of the Epistle to the <hi>Ephesians, chap. 4. v. 1.
doct.</hi> 1, 2. which is applicable here: Learn 1. The
endeavours of others, by prayer or otherwayes,
to have us doing well, should not hinder, but ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
further our own diligence and pains: and
particularly our own prayers, or the prayers of
others to God on our behalf, should be seconded
by diligent use of means on our part, for attain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
the good thing prayed for, otherwise we tempt
the Lord by our prayers, as the sluggard, <hi>Prov.
21,</hi> 25. and make the prayers of others wholly in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>effectual,
as to the bringing about of any good unto
us, <hi>Psal.</hi> 35. 13. for, <hi>Paul</hi> having prayed fervent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly,
that the Lord would make them abound in
grace, <hi>chap.</hi> 3. 12. he doth here press upon them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves
to abound more and more, and because he
prayed for it, therefore he would have them to en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deavour
it, as appears by the illative particle, <hi>then,</hi>
or <hi>therefore: furthermore then.</hi> 2. When a Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>
                  <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>ister
hath with greatest clearness, and fulness ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plicated,
and laid open the doctrinal part of Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stian
Religion, and the several articles of faith, he
<pb n="141" facs="tcp:61385:74"/>
hath not yet absolved his task, until he press upon
peoples consciences the practice of piety and of
the several duties of an holy life: And whatever a
man be for knowledge, yet there is one thing, and
the main thing lacking, so long as he knows not, or
cares not, how to bring his knowledge into pra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctice;
his knowledge in that case is to no purpose,
as not having attained the end for which it is gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven,
<hi>Act.</hi> 2. 11, 12. for, <hi>Paul</hi> having already in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>structed
them in the doctrinal part of Religion,
and exhorted them to constancy in it, he looks up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
somewhat yet wanting and necessary to be added,
even the following directions to lead an holy life:
<hi>furthermore then,</hi> or, <hi>as to that which yet rests,
we beseech you.</hi> 3. A Minister, especially in
pressing the practice of holy duties upon the people
of his charge, should labour to be both affectionate
and serious, so that neither his affection and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>spect
unto them may marr his vehemency and fer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vor,
in pressing home the point upon their consci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence,
nor yet his zeal and fervour make him omit
any thing, whereby sanctified prudence might
teach him to evidence his affection to them and
respect of them, lest otherwise by exasperating their
corruption he drive them further from their duty, in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stead
of bringing them nearer to it: for <hi>Paul,</hi> while
he presseth duty, doth not command imperiously,
but intreats them meekly and affectionately, as the
word rendered <hi>beseech</hi> implyeth, and yet most se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riously
and fervently, he both <hi>beseecheth and ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>horteth.</hi>
4. A Ministers meekness and lenity
ought to be seasoned with some mixture of autho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity
and due severity, lest otherwise his meekness
<pb n="142" facs="tcp:61385:75"/>
be despised, and his Ministry want an edge: for, as
<hi>Paul</hi> beseecheth them in lenity, so he obtests them
<hi>by the Lord Jesus,</hi> that is, in his name and autho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity,
and for his sake. 5. Though good works,
and an holy walk, be not necessary antecedents of
Justification, <hi>Rom.</hi> 4. 5. yet they are of necessity
required in the person now justified, to wit, for
making his calling and election sure, 2 <hi>Pet.</hi> 1. 10.
for making evident the reality of his faith and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terest
in Christ, <hi>Jam.</hi> 2. 18. for glorifying God,
<hi>Joh.</hi> 15. 8. for gaining of others, <hi>Matth.</hi> 5. 16.
for attaining the actual possession of life eternal, as
the way to it, <hi>Heb.</hi> 12. 14. though not as a price
to merit or buy it, <hi>Rom.</hi> 6. 23. for, the word in
the original, rendered <hi>how ye ought to walk,</hi> doth
signifie how ye <hi>must of necessity</hi> walk. 6. That a
man may walk as a Christian, and so as to please
the Lord, he must take the revealed will of God,
delivered by his Prophets and Apostles, and com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitted
by them to sacred writ, for his guide, both
in the matter and manner of his walk: for, <hi>Paul</hi>
teacheth so much, while he saith, that <hi>as ye have
received of us, how ye ought to walk and to please
God, so ye should abound,</hi> now what they had re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived
of him, to this purpose, by his Preaching,
he doth here commit the summ of it to writing.
7. Whatever be a mans walk and conversation
for matter, or otherwise for manner; yet he walks
not as a Christian, nor so as he can have any real
or solid comfort in his walk, except he sincerely
endeavour to please the Lord, by doing what he
doth as service to him, <hi>Eph.</hi> 6. 6, 7. for, <hi>Paul</hi>
makes their endeavour to please God, a ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>necessary
<pb n="143" facs="tcp:61385:75"/>
ingredient in a Christian walk, while he
saith, <hi>how ye ought to walk, and to please God.</hi>
8. There is not a rest, or stand, allowed of God
to any in the way of grace, but when much is
attained, we ought still (forgetting those things
which are behind, <hi>Phil. 3. 13.)</hi> enlarge our desires,
and bend our endeavour after more, and yet after
more, seeing there is still more to be had, <hi>Phil. 3.
13.</hi> and the Lord alloweth our desires after grace
to be insatiable and boundless, <hi>Joh.</hi> 16. 23, 24.
though as to our other enjoyments, he would have
them bounded by his allowance, <hi>Heb.</hi> 13. 5. for,
<hi>Paul</hi> supposing they had already grace, and a great
measure of it, doth nevertheless exhort them to
<hi>abound more and more.</hi>
               </p>
               <q>Ver. 2. For ye know what commandments we gave
you by the Lord Jesus.</q>
               <p>Here is a reason to inforce the exhortation.
1. The thing required by him now, was nothing
else, but what he had enjoyned them formerly.
2. Those directions he gave them were not his
own, but the <hi>Lord Christs,</hi> in whose name and au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thority,
he as Christs Lyon-herauld had proclaim<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
them; for the Greek word signifieth such a
commandment, as is published by one in the name
and authority of another, and so much also is ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pressed,
while he saith <hi>by the Lord Jesus,</hi> or in his
name. Lastly, they did know, and were suffici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ently
convinced, both that he had given those com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mandments,
and that they were not his, but Christs.
<hi>Doct.</hi> 1. As Ministers ought not to forbear the fre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quent

repetition of one and the same truths, until
they obtain from people their due acceptance,
though still with some delectable variety, in some
circumstances of their delivery, lest otherwise they
become loathed of the hearers: So the more that
a duty is inculcate, we are the more obliged to take
notice of it, and will have the more of guilt if we
neglect and slight it: for, <hi>Paul</hi> presseth obedience to
the former exhortation, from this, that he had fre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quently
pressed it before as well as now: <hi>for ye
know what commandments we gave you.</hi> 2. As
the Lords Ministers ought to deliver nothing for
a rule of faith or manners unto their hearers, but
what they have a warrant for from Christ, for they
are but Ministers of Christ, and publishers of his
will to his people, and not Lords of their faith,
2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 1. 24. So the Lords people should receive
nothing of their hand, but that for which they can
produce such a warrant: for, the injunctions which
<hi>Paul</hi> gave them, and they were to receive from
him, were only such, <hi>the commandments which
he gave them by the Lord Jesus.</hi> 3. The more
we know our duty, and are convinced of a tye laid
on by God himself to walk in it, the greater should
be our care to make conscience of it; otherwise
our knowledge will be our condemnation, <hi>Joh.
3.</hi> 19. and we see sin without all cloak or excuse,
<hi>Joh.</hi> 15. 22. for the strength of this present argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
lyeth in their knowledge: <hi>for ye know what
commandments we gave you by the Lord Jesus.</hi>
               </p>
               <pb n="145" facs="tcp:61385:77"/>
               <q>Ver. 3. For this is the will of God, even your san<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctification,
that ye should abstain from forni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cation.</q>
               <p>In this verse, he doth first declare, what that is
wherein he did exhort them to abound, <hi>v.</hi> 1. to
wit, <hi>sanctification,</hi> which being taken as it is our
duty, is a serious and constant endeavour after a full
and through conformity, of the whole man, both
outward and inward, <hi>Jam.</hi> 4. 8. to what the Lord
requireth in his word. And he addeth also a new
argument, to enforce the exhortation so explained,
to wit, It is Gods will, or the thing which he re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quireth,
as well-pleasing unto him. Next being to
press upon them some particular branches of sancti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fication,
he begins with chastity: In pressing
whereof, he first exhorts them to <hi>abstain</hi> from the
contrary vice, to wit, <hi>fornication;</hi> which is to be
taken here generally, as extended to all filthiness
and uncleanness contrary to chastity, and thus it
comprehends adultery, <hi>Matth.</hi> 5. 32. yea and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cest,
1 <hi>Cor. 5. 1. Doct.</hi> 1. This may sufficiently
commend a duty, and set us upon the practice of
it, that it is willed and commanded of God, what
ever otherwise be the reluctancy, and vain de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>batings
of flesh and blood against it, <hi>Gal.</hi> 1. 16. It
holdeth good in his commands alone, they are not
to be disputed, but obeyed, and his will to be sim<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ply
followed, without further enquiry in the
grounds and reasons of it, except where those are
held forth unto us by the Lord himself: for, he
holds out the Lords will as a sufficient reason to
<pb n="146" facs="tcp:61385:78"/>
press the present exhortation: <hi>for this is the will
of God,</hi> saith he. 2. The duties of sanctification
are no less willed, and enjoyned by God to believ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers,
than the exercise of faith it self: faith in Christ
doth not loose the tye of the command, and will of
God binding us to duty: for, writing to believers,
he saith, <hi>This is the will of God even your sancti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fication.</hi>
3. A Ministers wisdom should lead him,
in pressing holiness, not to rest upon generals, but
to condescend upon such particulars of sin and
duty, (by disswading from the one, and inciting
to the other) the omission or commission whereof
is most common among the people of his charge:
for so doth <hi>Paul,</hi> having pressed sanctification in
the general, he descends unto some particular du<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties,
and such doubtless, as the present condition of
that people did give him the occasion to pitch upon
beyond others: <hi>That ye abstain from fornication,</hi>
saith he. 4. As sanctification includeth not only
the practice of duty, but also the mortification of,
and abstinence from sin: so there are no sins that an
holy heart will scare more at, and strive to mortifie,
than those to which his fleshly appetite would en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>slave
him; such sins being not only insnaring when
given way to <hi>(Eccles. 7. 26.)</hi> because most de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lightsome,
but also most inconsistent with, at least
most destructive of, the work of grace in the heart,
1 <hi>Pet.</hi> 2. 11. for, the Apostle doth press abstinence
from fornication, as a main branch of sanctificati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on:
<hi>That ye abstain from fornication,</hi> saith he.</p>
               <pb n="147" facs="tcp:61385:78"/>
               <q>Ver. 4. That everyone of you should know how to
possess his vessel in sanctification and honour.</q>
               <p>In pressing chastity, he doth next prescribe a re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>medy
against the forementioned sin, and thereby
enjoyneth the exercise of the contrary vertue, to wit,
<hi>That every one of them,</hi> without exception, <hi>should</hi>
not only abstain from fornication, but also <hi>know,</hi>
and acquaint themselves, how they might by an ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
kind of skill and artifice, <hi>possess,</hi> or make use of
their body, here called their <hi>vessel,</hi> or an instrument
of any sort (as the word is generally taken) be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause
the body is the instrument of the soul, by
which it acts; a vessel or receptacle wherein for
the time it is preserved. And the manner how
they were to possess it, and make right use of it,
is in two words, none whereof do exclude the law<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful
use of the marriage-bed, <hi>Heb.</hi> 13. 4. but it is,
1. In <hi>Sanctification,</hi> that is, not only in freedom
from fleshly pollutions, but also in making all the
members of the body subservient to the soul, in
all those offices for which they are appointed, and
chiefly in the practice of holy duties, <hi>Rom.</hi> 6. 19.
2. In <hi>honour,</hi> that is, not so much, or only by ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king
lawful and necessary care, to provide all things
needful for the body (though that be not excluded,
see upon <hi>Col. 2. 23.)</hi> but also and mainly, by pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>serving
it in that measure of purity and freedom,
from every kind of sinful defilement, which is sui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>table
to that honour put on it by God, of being
made a temple to the Holy Ghost, 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 6. 15. he
seemeth to allude to that more than ordinary clean<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness
<pb n="148" facs="tcp:61385:79"/>
and purity, wherein these Vessels were kept,
which were dedicate to the service of God
in the sanctuary, <hi>Exod. 40. 9, 10. Doct.</hi> 1. The
Lord requireth not only inward sanctity, in the
understanding, will and affections, but also out<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward
in the body and all its members: And
therefore it is not sufficient for us to know our
duty, and have some inward good liking of it,
the outward man in the mean time being left at
liberty, and as it were without a rule, to do or
not do as may make most for the mans safety
from hazard, for his pleasure, credit or advan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tage:
for, <hi>Paul</hi> seemeth to obviate the errour of
some, who thought otherwise, while he requireth
<hi>every man to possess his vessel or body in sanctifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cation.</hi>
2. The Mor<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>l Law, and more particu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>larly
the Law enjoyning chastity, and keeping the
soul and body free from fleshly lusts, doth ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lige
all and every one, without exception of
any, to obedience; so that neither great, <hi>Deut.
17.</hi> 17. nor small, <hi>Deut.</hi> 23. 17. man nor wo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man,
<hi>Jam.</hi> 4. 4. young nor old, 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 7. may
plead exemption: for, the command is given to
every one, <hi>That every one should know, how to
possess his vessel.</hi> 3. There is a kind of Divine
art of chastity, and no small skill required, to
keep a mans soul and body free from fleshly un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cleanness:
Some rules of which Heavenly art, are
briefly these. The outward senses must be kept
from enticeing objects, <hi>Job</hi> 31. 1. loose and wan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ton
company eschewed, <hi>Prov.</hi> 5. 8. meat, drink,
and sleep soberly used, <hi>Ezek.</hi> 16. 49. our ordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nary
<pb n="149" facs="tcp:61385:79"/>
callings diligently plyed, <hi>Ezek.</hi> 16. 49.
the first motions and stirrings within of fleshly
lust quickly suppressed, <hi>Exod.</hi> 20. 17. Prayer to
God, for strength to ressit tentations, frequently
used, <hi>Matth.</hi> 26. 41. and if none of those pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vail,
marriage, the means appointed of God for
eschewing fornication, must be entred, 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 7. 2.
for, <hi>Paul</hi> implyeth that there is skill and know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge
required for this thing, while he saith,
<hi>That every one of you should know how to pos<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sess.</hi>
4. As every man ought to possess his own
body; or be master of it, and not be possessed
by it, or enslaved to it, by spending his precious
time in an excessive pampering of it, with meat,
drink, sleep, <hi>Ezek.</hi> 16. 49. or gorgeous ray<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment,
<hi>Isa. 3. 18, &amp;c.</hi> So doth he possess it as he
ought, when not only he doth not yield his mem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bers
servants unto uncleanness, or to iniquity of
any sort, <hi>Rom.</hi> 6. 19. but also doth subject it to
God, and keep it subservient, as an instrument
of the renewed soul, in giving obedience to the
revealed will of God: for, this is it that <hi>Paul</hi>
teacheth, while he biddeth every man <hi>possess,</hi> or
make use of his body, as a <hi>vessel,</hi> or instru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
of the soul, and <hi>in sanctification and ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour.</hi>
               </p>
               <pb n="150" facs="tcp:61385:80"/>
               <q>Ver. 5. Not in the lust of concupiscence, even
as the Gentiles which know not God.</q>
               <p>He doth thirdly, in pressing chastity, shew how
far that abstinence from fornication, menti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>oned
<hi>v.</hi> 3. doth reach, even to a restraining not
only the external act, but also the inward lust of
concupiscence, or as the word signifieth the fe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vorish
fit, or violent passion of burning desire,
which boyleth within, through all the members of
the body, 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 7. 9. disturbing the judgement,
as with a high fit of a Fevor, and provoking both
body and mind to the outward act of filthiness.
And fourthly, he gives a reason enforcing the dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>swasive,
lest otherwise they should be like the pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phane
<hi>gentiles,</hi> who were for the most part given
over of God to the base slavery of their filthy lusts:
and that because they <hi>knew not God,</hi> to wit, saving<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly,
and as he is revealed in his word; neither did
they rightly improve that natural knowledge,
which they had of him, and therefore God
gave them up to uncleanness, <hi>Rom.</hi> 1. 21.
with 24. <hi>Doct.</hi> 1. As concupiscence, and the first
inordinate motions to lust, when not timeously
curbed, do become passionate, inflaming the body,
and restraining the judgement from solid thoughts
of any other thing, but of what may tend to fulfil
them: So such violent passions, and fevorish fits
of fleshly concupiscence, do put both the body
and mind out of frame, for discharging any
duty of holiness in a way honourable to God: for,
he sheweth that <hi>concupiscence</hi> groweth to <hi>lust,</hi> or
<pb n="151" facs="tcp:61385:80"/>
to a violent passion, and a kind of phrensie, as the
word implyeth, and that the prevalency of this
passion and lust, as opposite to that possessing the
body in sanctification and honour, mentioned <hi>v. 4.
not in the lust of concupiscence,</hi> saith he. 2. As
there is need of the former Divine art, mentioned
<hi>v. 4. doct.</hi> 3. to allay and root out those Fevorish
fits of burning lust: So except they be one way or
other allayed, a man cannot possess his body, as
master of it, but is in daily hazard to be trailed as
a slave, to fulfil the utmost of those fleshly lusts,
which are burning in it: for, while he requireth
every one to know, <hi>how to possess his body not in the
lust of concupiscence,</hi> he implyeth, that otherwise
he is not a full possessor of it, and that there is skill
and knowledge required unto a man, for keeping
his body free of those boiling passions. 3. As
there are several degrees of one and the same sin,
the former whereof maketh way to the latter: So
then do we set against a sin to purpose, when we not
only lop the utmost branches, or set our selves to
refrain from the outward act, but also to restrain
the inward motions and desires of the heart after it:
for, he will have them to set against the inward
<hi>lust,</hi> or passion, <hi>of concupiscence,</hi> as the most ready
mean of abstinence from the breaking out of con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cupiscence
in the outward act of fornication spoken
of <hi>v. 3. Doct.</hi> 4. The sight of sins prevalency in
others, should not allure us to it, but much rather
scare us from it, there being thereby occasion of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fered
to get a more full and clear sight of the ty<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ranny
and loathsome filthiness of sin given way
to, than can be attained by the hearing of the ear,
<pb n="152" facs="tcp:61385:81"/>
and word-speaking: for, therefore doth he set be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
them the prevalency of this sin among the Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gan-Gentiles,
to scare them from it: <hi>even as the
Gentiles,</hi> saith he. 5. As that is only worthy to be
called the knowledge of God, which is operative
upon the heart and affections: So ignorance of
God is a woful root, from whence many other sins
do spring up; The Lord sometimes judicially giv<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
the ignorant person over to those other sins, as
a just punishment for his affected ignorance; Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sides,
that the knowledge of God which we ought
to have, includeth the knowledge of our duty,
wherein we honour him being so known, and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
they who know not God cannot but sin, as not
knowing whereat they stumble: for although the
Pagan-Gentiles had some knowledge of God, yet
because their knowledge was not operative and
effectual, he affirms simply they knew him not,

as they should eschew every sinful practice of others,

the avenger of all such, as we also have fore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>warned

               <p>He doth here press a second branch of that san<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctification,
spoken of <hi>v.</hi> 1. The exhortation is first
proponed, to this sense; That in <hi>no matter,</hi> or in
no business of common commerce, they should
wrong their brother, either by open violence (as
the word rendred <hi>go beyond</hi> implyeth, it signifieth
to go above, or trample upon one as despicable, and
so expresseth to the life the nature and way of proud
and insolent oppressours) nor yet by secret fraud
and <hi>deceit</hi> (as the other word is expresly rendred,
see also 2 <hi>Cor. 7. 2.)</hi> and the party whom they
are discharged to oppress or deceive, is their <hi>bro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther,</hi>
that is, one of the same Religion with them,
<hi>Deut.</hi> 17. 15. whereby he meaneth not as if it
were lawful to oppress others (see the contrary,
<hi>Exod. 22. 21.)</hi> but because the most of their traf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fick
and commerce being probably with Christi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans
and among themselves, the consideration of
their interest in the person injured by them would
add no small weight to their sin, 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 6. 6. Next
he addeth a reason to enforce not only this disswa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sive,
but the former <hi>v.</hi> 5. and it's taken from one
dreadful effect of all such sins, they lay open the
person guilty to <hi>Gods</hi> dreadful <hi>vengeance:</hi> and he
confirmeth the truth hereof from this, that he had
often told them so much before when he was with
them, and not only simply told, but seriously <hi>testi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fied,</hi>
                  <pb n="154" facs="tcp:61385:82"/>
and earnestly obtested them to believe the
truth of what he had deponed, as it were upon
oath unto them, for so much doth the word im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ply.
<hi>Doct.</hi> 1. The wise Lord hath judged it fitting
so to dispense of things worldly unto mankind, not
giving all things needful unto any one, as that men
cannot live without mutual commerce, and ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>change
of commodities from one hand to another:
for, he suppones the necessity of mutual commerce
while he forbiddeth oppression and deceit in it:
<hi>that no man go beyond his brother in any matter,</hi>
or in any business of common commerce. 2. So
covetous is man by nature of that which is his
neighbours, and so little willing to reverence the
Lord in the measure of things worldly dispensed
unto him, <hi>Isa.</hi> 5. 8. that he is easily tempted to
catch advantage of his Neighbour in the matter of
commerce, and to make up his own worldly estate
by impairing the estate of others: for <hi>Paul,</hi> while
he forbiddeth this evil, supponeth that men are
prone to fall in it: <hi>That no man go beyond or de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fraud
his brother.</hi> 3. So enslaving an evil is co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vetousness,
that where it reigneth it maketh the co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vetous
wretch imploy the utmost, both of his power
and skill to give it satisfaction: for <hi>Paul,</hi> while he
forbids both going beyond, or oppressing by pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er,
and defrauding by skill, implyeth that both
power and skill is usually imployed for carrying on
this sin: <hi>That no man go beyond or defraud.</hi>
4. So subtle a fisher and hunter after souls is Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tan
<hi>(Eph. 6. 11.)</hi> as that he hath several sorts of
tentations according to the several tempers and abi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lities
of people to insnare them with, in one and the
<pb n="155" facs="tcp:61385:82"/>
same sin; So that when any are effrontedly shame<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>less
in wickedness, and love to be known and fear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
as such, and have power to bear them out to
act their villanies, he then tempts them to oppress
avowedly; and with strong hand: and for others
who either have not power or good will to carry on
their wickedness in open view, those he tempts to
defraud or deceive, teaching them a way<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> how to
sin, and not to be so easily discovered in their sin<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
for, <hi>Paul</hi> suppones there were tentations of both
those kinds, while he forbids to yield to either:
<hi>That no man go beyond or defraud his brother.</hi>
5. Whatever pretexts a man may find out to ren<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der
one sin, and especially his own sin, more plau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sible
and excusable than another; yet no pretext of
that kind can licentiate a man to live in any sin<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
neither the open oppressour who pretends plain

he is, nor yet the subtle deceiver who pretends law
and fair bargain, are excuseable; but both of them
are alike guilty before the Lord: for both are
here condemned: <hi>That no man go beyond or de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fraud
his brother.</hi> 6. As impunity from men doth
harden the wicked much in sin: So the Lord doth
alwayes supply the defects of mans justice; by ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king
vengeance here or hereafter, especially upon
those sins whereof Judges among men do take less
notice: for, such are the sins here forbidden, flesh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
uncleanness, oppression by the great, and subtle
cheating under pretext of Law by the politick and
worldly wise, are not much punished by men, hence
are they so common: and therefore saith <hi>Paul,
The Lord is the <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>venger of all such.</hi> 7. So strong
<pb n="156" facs="tcp:61385:83"/>
is the interest of sin in fallen man, and chiefly of
such sins as bring worldly profit and pleasure with
them, that there is need of word upon word, and
reason upon reason, to scare him from them; and
there must be not only love to the commander to
constrain, but also the terrour of God to perswade:
for, having given one argument <hi>v.</hi> 3. to disswade
from those pleasant and profitable sins, from the
signification of Gods will; he seeth it yet needful
to add another here, from Gods vengeance and
terrour, being to add more afterwards: <hi>Because
that the Lord is the avenger of all such,</hi> saith he<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
8. As where sin is, there Gods vengeance doth fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low
either upon the sinner himself, or a cautioner
in his stead, 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 5. 21. So the Lord doth allow
a gracious soul, neither is it inconsistent with grace
in the soul, to abstain from sin, as from other more
prime, so from this inferiour motive, the fear of
Gods vengeance to ensue and follow: for, he shew<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth
God doth avenge such sins, and disswades even
believers from them, because <hi>he is the avenger of
all such.</hi> 9. A Minister must not think, that his
once denouncing the terrour of divine vengeance
against the sinner for his sin will scare him from
it: neither must he give over the matter as hope<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>less,
when his former dreadful certifications have
had little or no effect, but he must yet again renew
his zeal, reiterate former threatnings and other ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guments,
as not knowing when the Lord shall be
pleased to give the wished for success, 2 <hi>Tim.
2.</hi> 25. for <hi>Paul</hi> reiterates this dreadful certificati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on,
though he had often told it before, and as it ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pears,
without any success as to some: <hi>As we also

men for the most part, and so slow to believe the
truth of divine threatnings, <hi>Deut.</hi> 29. 19. that if
Ministers when they threaten be not the more se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rious
and fervent, the most terrible threatning
will but little affect the most part of hearers;
Some one shift or other will be found out to put
them by to break their dint, and to make them of
no effect: for, therefore <hi>Paul,</hi> in denouncing this
terrible threatning, did seriously testifie, and fer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vently
obtest them to take warning from it: <hi>As
we also have forewarned you and testified.</hi>
               </p>
               <q>Ver. 7. For God hath not called us unto uncleanness
but unto holiness.</q>
               <p>In this Verse there is a second argument; for
enforcing all the former exhortations, both gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral
and particular, positive and negative: And it
is taken from the end intended by God, when he
did first effectually call them, that is, draw them
out of nature to the state of grace, <hi>Col.</hi> 1. 13.
which is expressed, first negatively, It was not
that they might thence take liberty to defile them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves
with sin of any kind; for the word, <hi>unclean<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness,</hi>
must be taken here in that general sense, as
being opposed to sanctification, and containing
under it all the sins formerly forbidden, not only
fornication, which is <hi>uncleanness,</hi> strictly taken,
but also oppression and fraud. Next positively,
he had <hi>called them to sanctification,</hi> or that they
might be sanctified, and live in the constant exer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cise
of all the sanctifying graces of Gods Spirit.
<pb n="158" facs="tcp:61385:84"/>
                  <hi>Doct.</hi> 1. As God is a dreadful avenger of all sin,
So chiefly of such sins of professors of the Gospel
as do reflect upon their Christian calling, either
as hardly consistent with it, <hi>Deut.</hi> 32. 5. or as
opening the mouths of prophane Atheists to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proach
it, 2 <hi>Sam.</hi> 12. 14. for, he here gives this
reason why God is the avenger of all such sins,
God had called them to abstinence from them, and
consequently their lying in them would reflect up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
their calling: <hi>for God hath not called us unto
uncleanness,</hi> saith he. 2. It is the duty of called
Christians, in all their actions and employments,
to examine all by the rule of their Christian call<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing,
and to do or not do accordingly, being al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wayes
loth to do any thing which may in the least
measure reflect upon it, though it should other<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wise
bring them never so much pleasure or advan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tage:
for, he will have them to abstain from the
flesh-pleasing sin of uncleanness, and the profitable
sin of covetousness, fraud and oppression, upon this
account, they were not according to the rule of
their Christian calling: <hi>for God hath not called
us unto uncleanness,</hi> saith he. 3. So averse are all
men by nature from the duties of holiness, <hi>Rom.
8.</hi> 7. so impotent to go about them, as being dead
in sins and trespasses, <hi>Eph.</hi> 2. 1. that the Lord must
first draw us out of nature to the state of grace,
and create in us a new heart and abilities to do
good <hi>(Ezek. 36. 26.)</hi> when he effectually calleth
us, before we mind holiness in earnest: <hi>for, he
hath called us—unto holiness,</hi> saith he.
4. Though some do abuse grace unto wantonness,
and pretend they may sin without fear, (when,
<pb n="159" facs="tcp:61385:84"/>
as they suppone, they are effectually called) be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause
the root of the matter is in them, and grace
once received cannot be lost, <hi>Rom.</hi> 6. 15. yet, as
such corrupt reasonings receive no encouragement,
neither from the author of grace, the Holy God,
nor from the end of bestowing grace, which is
our sanctification and holiness: So if any exter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nally
called by the Ministry of the Gospel do live
loosely or profanely, it should not in reason reflect
upon this holy calling, but upon the persons them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves,
who do not walk worthy of it and suitable
unto it, (as is enjoyned, <hi>Eph. 4. 1.)</hi> and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by
evidence the external call of the Gospel hath ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver
received inward entertainment in their heart:
for, <hi>Paul</hi> supponing some might have such perverse
reasonings as those, doth here refute them as ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving
no ground from our Christian calling, seeing
it is <hi>God</hi> who calleth, and <hi>calleth not to unclean<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness,
but unto holiness.</hi>

               <p>Followeth a third argument to press the same
thing, and it's taken from the heinousness of their
sin, if they should despise, reject, or set at nought
(as the word signifieth) those wholesom Aposto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lical
counsels and commands. They should hereby
despise or reject, <hi>not man,</hi> to wit, only, or chiefly,

forth the beauty of holiness, and pressing by the
strongest of reasons the practice of it upon peoples

from yielding obedience, that the more they are
pressed to duty, they will be the more averse from
it; and in the end prove profane mockers and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>spisers
of all which can be said to that purpose:
for, <hi>Paul</hi> after all his exhortations and reasons,
supponeth there would be some such despisers,
while he sets himself against them: <hi>he therefore
that despiseth.</hi> 2. Though such prophane despi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sers
of exhortations to duty, and of threatnings
denounced in case of neglect of duty, do please
themselves with vain thoughts that the Minister, a
despicable man, is only their party, whose pleasure
they do not regard, whose displeasure they do not
fear, <hi>Jer.</hi> 18. 18. yet herein they are hugely mista<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken,
the great God is their party, he it is whom
they despise, and who will reckon with them as
setters at nought of him: for, so saith <hi>Paul, he
therefore that despiseth, despiseth not man, but God.</hi>
3. So much are faithful Ministers owned of God in
the discharge of their trust, that what respect or
disrespect is put upon them, or the message which
they carry, it is reckoned by him as put upon him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>self;
and that because they are Ambassadours in his
stead, 2 <hi>Cor. 5. 20. he that despiseth, despiseth not
man, but God,</hi> saith he. 4. The great reason for
which a peoples carriage towards the message, and
<pb n="161" facs="tcp:61385:85"/>
person of their faithful Ministers, reflecteth upon
God himself is, that they in discharge of their trust
do represent him, and all their regular actings are
owned by him as his own: for, from what he
spoke, <hi>v.</hi> 7. that the act of sent Ministers, in calling
sinners by the Ministry of the Gospel, <hi>(2 Cor. 11. 2.)</hi>
is owned by God himself as his deed, he inferreth
here, that therefore <hi>he that despiseth, despiseth not
man but God.</hi> 5. Though faithful Ministers are men,
and therefore both may and must be affected with
injuries and affronts, put upon them by profane A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>theists,
while they set at nought their person and
reject their message, <hi>Jer.</hi> 20. 2. 18. yet the disho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour
done thereby to God doth bear so much bulk
in their minds, as if any disgrace put upon them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves,
being compared with that, were not to be
regarded, and not so much as once to be named;
for though profane mockers despise the Ministers,
yet so little is that comparatively valued by <hi>Paul,</hi>
that he saith, <hi>he that despiseth, despiseth not man
but God.</hi> 6. Though the contempt and disgrace
cast even upon ordinary Ministers by slighting their
message redoundeth to God, for the reasons given,
<hi>doct.</hi> 3, 4. yet this did hold chiefly in the Apostles,
and other penmen of holy Scripture, who were in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fallibly
assisted in what they wrote, 2 <hi>Pet.</hi> 1. 21.
and in ordinary Ministers, but in so far as they fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low

people for truth but what they have warrant for
in the written Word of God: for the reason here

               <p>He doth here press a third branch of sanctifica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion,
called brotherly love, which is that singular,
and as it were native (and therefore called bro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>therly)
love and affection, testified by action,
which ought to be and in some measure is, <hi>(1 Joh.

for the reality or appearance of Gods grace
in them, <hi>Psal.</hi> 119. 63. And he presseth the ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ercise
of this grace first, by commending them for
their progress herein already, which was such that
they had not so great <hi>need</hi> to have it pressed upon
them as others; for that the words must be under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stood
not simply and absolutely (as they sound)
but comparatively (as other Scriptural expressions
of the like kind, <hi>Joh. 9. 41. 1 Cor. 1. 17.)</hi> ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pears
from his pressing this same duty on them,

had been no need at all for it. <hi>Secondly,</hi> By giv<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
a reason why it was not needful for him to
write much to this purpose, because <hi>they were
taught of God to love one another,</hi> that is, their
hearts were powerfully inclined to the actual exer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cise
<pb n="163" facs="tcp:61385:86"/>
of this grace by the efficacious working of
Gods Spirit, not without, but accompanying the

in the Region of <hi>Macedonia,</hi> wherein
<hi>Thessalonica</hi> was the chief City. And fourthly
by exhorting them expresly, (notwithstanding their

<hi>to abound more and more</hi> in the exercise of that
grace.</p>
               <p>From <hi>v.</hi> 9. Learn 1. where sanctifying grace is
wrought in the heart by God, there will not only
be an abstaining from wrong, hurt and injury to

an inward propension, seconded with real endea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vours
to do him good, and help him forward both
in his bodily, <hi>Lev.</hi> 35. 25. and spiritual estate,

from doing wrong to our neighbour, <hi>v.</hi> 6.
as one branch of that sanctification mentioned,
<hi>v.</hi> 3. he doth here enjoyn the exercise of brotherly
love, as another branch of the same grace: <hi>But as
touching brotherly love,</hi> &amp;c. 2. It is a singular
piece of Ministerial prudence seasonably to com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mend
what good they observe in the Lords people,
and so to commend it as that thereby they be not
rendred proud or secure, but strongly incited to
make further progress in that good which they
<pb n="164" facs="tcp:61385:87"/>
already have: and people ought to improve what
countenance or commendation they receive from
their faithful Pastors for the same end, otherwise
it becomes their snare, <hi>Matth.</hi> 16. 17. compared
with 22. for, <hi>Paul</hi> doth here commend the pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gress
they had already made in the exercise of bro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>therly
love, of purpose to incite them to further
progress: <hi>As touching brotherly love, ye need not
that I write unto you,</hi> saith he. 3. So apt are the
best to be discouraged in good, <hi>Heb.</hi> 12. 12. and
so much doth the known good opinion concerning

to do better: for, so doth <hi>Paul</hi> here: <hi>As

that all within their charge shall be alike do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cile,
tractable and easie to be wrought upon, by
powerful exhortations to holy duties, or all alike
backward, dull and unteachable: There are usu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally
some of both kinds, So that though some must

to little purpose, <hi>Isa.</hi> 28. 13. yet there are others

with whom less than that will prevail: for, such
were those <hi>Thessalonians,</hi> so tractable, that <hi>Paul</hi>
needed not take so much pains upon them, as upon
others, <hi>ye need not that I write unto you,</hi> saith he.
5. That any are thus more docile and easie to be
wrought upon than others, doth not proceed from
any natural difference of a better or worse disposi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion;
for all are by nature alike averse, and indis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>posed
unto any thing which is spiritually good,
<hi>Rom.</hi> 8. 7. but from the Lords effectual blessing
upon the means of instruction towards some more
than others: for, <hi>Paul</hi> gives this as a reason of their
proficiency beyond others: <hi>for ye your selves are
taught of God,</hi> saith he. 6. Though the Spirit of
God, the inward teacher of his people, doth not
teach immediately by enthusiasmes, dreams or rap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures,
without, and much less, contrary to the
word, <hi>Isa.</hi> 8. 20. but in and by the use of second
means, and especially by a sent Ministry, <hi>Rom.
10.</hi> 15. whose labours he doth effectually bless to
the elect, and so doth inwardly teach them,
1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 15. 10. yet where the Spirit of God doth
thus effectually and inwardly teach, there is the
less need of outward means, though there be al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wayes
some, even to the best, until their graces be
made perfect in Heaven, <hi>Eph.</hi> 4. 13. only a little
of outward means will do more good to such,
than ten times more can do to others: In a word,
those are easily taught whom God doth teach;
and therefore though eminent abilities are much to
be wished for in Ministers, <hi>Tit.</hi> 1. 9. yet we ought
not to be so anxious about the weakness or eminency
of gifts in them, as fervently desirous to have
<pb n="166" facs="tcp:61385:88"/>
Gods teaching to come along with theirs: for,
<hi>Paul</hi> shews that God by his teaching those <hi>Thessa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lonians</hi>
had made them stand the less in need of
being taught by him, while he saith, <hi>ye need not
that I write unto you, for ye your selves are
taught of God.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>From <hi>v.</hi> 10. Learn 1. All those whom God
doth teach do profit under his hand, he doth so
teach as the wills of those who are taught by him
are powerfully bowed, and actually inclined to
practise and obey what he teacheth: and herein
his teaching doth differ from mans, who can only
inform the judgement, by clearing up things to the
understanding, but cannot effectually determine
the will to obey, 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 3. 6. for, <hi>Paul</hi> sheweth
that the effect of Gods teaching them was their
real practice: And <hi>indeed ye do it,</hi> saith he. 2. As
Christian brotherly-love excludeth none, but is ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tended
unto all who have real grace, or promising
evidences thereof: So the great and main motive
which draweth out this brotherly love to the party
loved, is the reality or appearance of a gracious
work in him, and not other by respects only, or
mainly, as of kindred, friendship, or favours be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stowed
by them, <hi>Matth.</hi> 5. 46. for, he sheweth
that they exercised their love to others under the
notion of, or because they were, <hi>brethren;</hi> and did
extend it to all of that sort which were in all <hi>Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cedonia.</hi>
3. Though the exercise of brotherly-love
be a duty incumbent unto all equally, as to
that which is inward of it, in the heart and affecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on,
1 <hi>Pet.</hi> 1. 22. yet as to what is external, and
especially as to its fruit or beneficence, in supply<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
<pb n="167" facs="tcp:61385:88"/>
the outward straits of the people of God, there
is more or less required from several persons, ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording
to the capacity in which the Lord hath put
them to discharge it: for, <hi>Thessalonica</hi> being the
chief City in that whole Region, and so most able
to exercise beneficence, did extend their brotherly
love, even as to this act of it doubtless, <hi>to all the
brethren in all Macedonia.</hi> 4. It is a duty in a
special manner incumbent unto those who are any
way eminent in riches, power, or credit, whether
they be Cities, Societies, or particular persons,
to imploy their eminency as a shelter, help and
encouragement to piety and those who are pious,
in those places especially where they are, and as
far as their power may reach: for so did those
of this eminent City, <hi>Thessalonica,</hi> extend their
brotherly love in the fruits of in <hi>towards all the
brethren, in all Macedonia.</hi> 5. Even the most
praise-worthy graces of most eminent Saints have
their own defects, and fall exceedingly short of that
perfection which is required, and should be aimed
at, 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 13. 9. for, though he had commended
them much for their brotherly love, yet he imply<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth
there was some lack in it, while he beseech<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth
them <hi>to increase more and more.</hi> But 6. and
more particularly, This grace of brotherly love
can never be at such an height in any, but it is ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pable
of increase, either by intending it more,
while it groweth more fervent, and consequently
farther out of hazard of being quenched by those
provocations which might otherwayes cool it,
2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 12. 15. or by extending it more, especi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally
in its fruits of beneficence towards more and
<pb n="168" facs="tcp:61385:89"/>
more objects, <hi>Eccles.</hi> 11. 1, 2. or by spi<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="2 letters">
                     <desc>••</desc>
                  </gap>tualizing
it more, while there is a greater abstractedness
in its exercise from self-ends and motives, <hi>Rom<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
12.</hi> 9. for, <hi>Paul</hi> insinuates their brotherly love,
so much commended, was capable, of increase,
while he bids them <hi>increase more and more.</hi> 7. See
a further note <hi>v. 1. doct.</hi> 8. grounded upon this in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>junction,
<hi>increase more and more.</hi>
               </p>
               <q>Ver. 11. And that ye study to be quiet, and to do
your own business, and to work with your own
hands (as we commanded you.)</q>
               <p>He doth here press a fourth branch of sanctifica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion,
to wit, that they would <hi>study</hi> (or as the
word signifieth, contend with such eagerness as
ambitious men do for honour) <hi>to be of a quiet spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit,</hi>
without creating trouble either to themselves
or others, by their imporunate intruding upon
other mens business, with neglect of their own
concernments, and by seeking to live upon the
labours of others. And that this is intended by
the <hi>quietness</hi> here enjoyned, appeareth in part by
the means prescribed for attaining to it; which
are first, <hi>that every man do his own business,</hi> that
is, meddle with those things<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> and those only, which
come within the compass of his duty: So that he
condemneth not a charitable minding of the affairs
of others, when we are called to it, <hi>Phil.</hi> 2. 4. but
only a restless intermedling with such things as con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cern
us not. 2. That he <hi>work with his own hands,</hi>
whereby he enjoyneth industry and painfulness in
our callings; and what he speaketh of the <hi>hands,</hi>
                  <pb n="169" facs="tcp:61385:89"/>
must be taken figuratively, for any member of
the body or faculty of the mind which men make
chief use of in any lawful calling; which last piece
of the duty chiefly is enforced first, from his own
Apostolick authority who had so enjoyned when
he was with them. See 2 <hi>Thes. 3. 16. Doct.</hi> 1.
There is not any one thing more inconsistent with
the grace of brotherly love, and with the exercise
of that grace, than a turbulent spirit who must
have some medling hand in every thing, wherein
he is concerned least, and doth sinfully neglect
those other things, wherein by vertue of his sta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
he is concerned most; for so much is imply<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
while the Apostle presseth the exercise of a
quiet spirit, in opposition to that turbulent med<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling
humour, immediately after <hi>brotherly love,</hi> as
an help unto it: <hi>And that ye study to be quiet,</hi>
saith he. 2. As a mans greatest honour doth
stand in the exercise of Christian vertues, and
more especially in a Christian, peaceable and so<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber
deportment, flowing from a meek and quiet
spirit, which is a choice piece of that ornament
wherewith Christians should be adorned, 1 <hi>Pet.
3.</hi> 4. So this calm and peaceable frame of a quiet
spirit will be found not easily, nor without the ut-most
of our serious endeavours attainable, if we
consider not only how great an enemy Satan i<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>
to this, as to all other graces, <hi>Ephes.</hi> 4. 26, 27.
but also how corruptly all men are by nature prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cipled
to think this truly Christian honour but
their shame, and a living and dying in obscuri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty
and disgrace, <hi>Judg.</hi> 9. 1, 2. and that those are
only honourable, who by winding themselves into
<pb n="170" facs="tcp:61385:90"/>
all businesses are admired, or feared, or depended
upon by all, 1 <hi>Sam.</hi> 15. 1, 2, 3, 4, 5. for, as it was
said in the exposition, the word rendred <hi>study,</hi>
signifieth to contend with such eagerness as ambi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tious
men do for honour, which implyeth both
that this quiet frame of spirit should be looked up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
as our honour, and not attainable if not eagerly
sought after: <hi>And that ye study to be quiet,</hi> saith
he. 3. This Christian frame of a meek and quiet
spirit, with a calm and peaceable deportment flow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
from it, is a far other thing than a love to live
in sluggish ease, and to eschew even the necessa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry
trouble which God doth sometimes call us to
encounter in the way of duty; for such a base de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sire
of sluggish ease is here opposed to it, while
he prescribeth, as an help for attaining this quiet
frame of spirit, that <hi>we do our own business, and work
with our own hands.</hi> 4. As those polypragmatick
spirits and busie-bodies, who do importunately in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gyre
themselves upon the affairs of others, and
can suffer nothing, neither of publick or private
concernment, to pass them, except they intermed<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dle
with it, either as umpires or parties, or as some
one way or other concerned in it, As those I say do
create much trouble and strife both to themselves
and others: So a choice preservative of peace and
quietness in publick societies, and in mens own spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rits,
is that every man being content with the sta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
wherein he is set <hi>(1 Cor. 7. 20, 21.)</hi> do busie
himself with those things only to which he is called
by God, as knowing that the best things done with
best intention, if without a calling to them, are
displeasing to the Lord, 2 <hi>Sam.</hi> 6. 7. for, <hi>Paul</hi>
                  <pb n="171" facs="tcp:61385:90"/>
doth teach both those, while he enjoyneth, as a
help for attaining this quiet and peaceable frame
of spirit, that every man meddle with those things,
and those only which come within the compass of
his duty: <hi>And to do your own business,</hi> saith he.
5. As most busie medlers with the affairs of others
are usually greatest neglectets of their own: So
lazie idleness and sloath in those things of a mans
own concernment, do usually drive him to straits,
and from that to employ his wits how he may one
way or other prey upon other mens estates for his
own subsistence, and thereby disturb both his own
peace and the peace of others; for, while he en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>joyneth
diligence and industry in a mans own call<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing,
as an help to attain this quiet and peaceable
frame of spirit, he implyeth that contrary sloth
doth usually drive men to busie medling, and to
disturb both themselves and others: <hi>And to work
with your own hands<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
                  </hi> saith he. 6. As the Lord
alloweth none to live idle, but will have all to em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ploy
the wit and strength which he hath given
them in some one lawful calling or other, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in
they may promote the good either of Church,
Family or Common-wealth, <hi>Eph.</hi> 4. 28. So pain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fulness
and industry in our own callings is a singular
help to stop our ears from being taken with the
alluring sound of many inchanting tentations, and
of those in particular which would allure us to
meddle with the affairs of others to their pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>judice,
and to employ our wit in raising stirs
and divisions among Societies for our own ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vantage;
we should find so much of work, what
<pb n="172" facs="tcp:61385:91"/>
from one thing what from another, at home, as
should make us loath to go abroad, except when
we are called and pressed to it: for, as an help
to attain a quiet and peaceable fame of spirit,
he enjoyneth every one <hi>to work with their own
hands.</hi> 7. It is the duty of Ministers to press
upon people not only the practice of Religious
duties, but also diligence and painfulness in the
duties of every mans particular calling; And so
to press the former, as under a pretext of zeal
and diligence in those, he do not make way for,
or connive at negligence in the latter: for <hi>Paul</hi>
doth so, not only here, but also shews he had
done it formerly: <hi>Work with your own hands,
(as we commanded you)</hi> saith he. 8. The word
Preached doth not presently evanish when spoken
by Ministers, but stands as a constant rule for
all time coming, though never so long after,
binding the consciences of those who heard it to
walk by it, as they would not be judged for
their disobedience to it; And therefore the word
when Preached should be carefully laid up in
the hearts of hearers for that end: for, <hi>Paul</hi>
sheweth that the word which he had preached
to them when he was with them, was binding
to them yet: <hi>As I commanded you,</hi> saith he.</p>
               <pb n="173" facs="tcp:61385:91"/>
               <q>Ver. 12. That ye may walk honestly toward them
that are without, and that ye may have lack of
nothing.</q>
               <p>Here are other two arguments for pressing in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dustry
and painfulness in their calling; first, here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by
they should <hi>walk honestly,</hi> and in a seemly
decency, in the eyes of those who were <hi>with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out,</hi>
or of unconverted Pagans (so called, 1 <hi>Cor.
5.</hi> 12. as being without the pale of Christs vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sible
Church) and otherwise both they them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves
and Christian Religion should be reproach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
by those Heathens. 2. Hereby, and by Gods
blessing upon their diligence <hi>(Prov. 10. 22.)</hi>
they should attain to such a tolerable competency
in things worldly as to have lack of nothing, to
wit, which the Lord did see fit and convenient
for them to have, <hi>Psal. 84. 11. Doct.</hi> 1. Such is
our love to sloath and ease, <hi>Prov.</hi> 6. 9, 10. and so
prone are people to abuse the doctrine of Christi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>an
liberty, as a pretence for shaking off the yoke
of all necessary and painful duty, <hi>Gal.</hi> 5. 13. that
the most of people, especially those who can by
their wits find out a sinful shift, covered over with
some handsome pretext, to subsist otherwayes,
can hardly be kept from giving themselves over
to idleness, or stirred up to look upon diligence
in particular callings as a matter of conscience:
for, therefore is it that <hi>Paul</hi> seeth it necessary to
use so many arguments, to enforce upon witty
medlers in other mens affairs, diligence in their
own: <hi>That ye may walk honestly.</hi> 2. As dili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gence
<pb n="174" facs="tcp:61385:92"/>
and industry in the duties of a mans par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticular
calling, is a piece of seemly decency and
honesty: so there is nothing more unseemly and
base than a lazie sluggard who being neither
profitable to himself nor others, doth live as if
he were only born to eat, drink and sleep, and
do nothing else: and though such idle sluggards
be neither whoremongers nor thieves, yet they
may and should be justly branded with dishonesty,
and esteemed to lead no honest life: for, so much
doth <hi>Paul</hi> teach, while he calleth painful industry
a walking honestly: <hi>That ye may walk honestly,</hi>
saith he. 3. It is the duty of Christians, as in
the first place to approve themselves to God,
<hi>Matth.</hi> 8. 4. and next unto good men, <hi>Psal.
52.</hi> 9. So also in the third place to those who
are <hi>without,</hi> even naughty wicked and profane
men, in so far at least as that we do not scare
them from Christ, and give them occasion to
speak evil of Religion, 1 <hi>Tim.</hi> 5. 14. for, so doth
<hi>Paul</hi> enjoyn: <hi>That ye may walk honestly toward
them that are without.</hi> 4. there is not any thing
that makes both Religion, and those who prosess
the same, more unseemly and unsavoury to pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fane
men, than when those who pretend much to
Religion do under any pretence, whatsoever, live
lazie sluggards in their particular callings, ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>posing
themselves and theirs to be a burden to
others, and to live upon the sweat of other mens
faces; They are so much convinced from natures
light of the unseemliness of this sin, that as they
burthen Religion with all the blemishes of those
who profess it, So they cannot think that such
<pb n="175" facs="tcp:61385:92"/>
a Religion <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>ath God for its Author, which giv<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth
people liberty to live in the practice of such
an evil: for, while <hi>Paul</hi> affirmeth that their pain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful
diligence in a particular calling would be <hi>a
walking honestly toward them that are without,</hi>
he insinuates that they would reproach them and
Religion both with dishonesty, if they lived
idly. 5. It is no small mercy for a man to
have competency of things worldly, so as he
neither know the power and strength of those
tentations which arise from pinching scarcity and
want, <hi>Prov.</hi> 31. 9. nor yet be necessitated to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pend
for a livelyhood upon the coldryff, and oft<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times
merciless, charity of others, <hi>James 2.
15,</hi> 16. for, <hi>Paul</hi> teacheth them so much, while
he perswades them to painful diligence, by a
promise of desirable competency: <hi>and that ye
may have lack of nothing,</hi> saith he. 6. See a
further note from the strength of this Argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
to inforce industry and painfulness in our
lawful callings, upon <hi>Eph. 4. 28. doct. 6. That ye
may have lack of nothing.</hi>
               </p>
               <q>Ver. 13. But I would not have you to be ignorant
brethren, concerning them which are asleep,
that ye sorrow not, even as others which have
no hope.</q>
               <p>In the second part of the Chapter, The Apostle,
while he p<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>esseth a fifth branch of sanctification,
to wit, moderation of sorrow for their friends who
died in Christ, many whereof were doubtless mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tyrs
for the truth in those dayes of persecution,
<pb n="176" facs="tcp:61385:93"/>
                  <hi>chap.</hi> 2. 14. and while he gives them many sweet
grounds of consolation against immoderate grief,
he falleth out in a digression concerning the state
of believers after death, and Christs second com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing.
And in this verse he first proposeth his scope
in all, which is, first, to remove all ignorance, un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>certainty,
or want of full perswasion of the truth
of those things which he is afterward to deliver, and
especially of the state of believers after death.
Next, that hereby they might learn to moderate
their <hi>sorrow</hi> and grief for their deceased friends,
and not to mourn excessively or desperately as
<hi>ot<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>ers,</hi> to wit, the Pagan Gentiles, did <hi>who had no
hope</hi> of life, or of a resurrection following. And
while he calleth the dead (after the usual manner
of Scripture, <hi>Act. 7. 60. 1 Cor. 15. 20. Joh.
11. 11.)</hi> by the name of those who <hi>sleep,</hi> he sets
down the first head of doctrine concerning the
state of believers after death, which also serveth
for an argument to moderate the excessive sorrow
of living friends for them, even this, that their
death is but a sleep, not a sleeping of the soul,
which goeth immediately after death to glory,
<hi>Luk.</hi> 23. 43. but of their bodies which rest in
the grave free from trouble and care, as a man
doth in his bed, and it shall be raised up from
the grave in the morning of the Resurrection,
<hi>Psal.</hi> 17. 15. by the voice of Christ, with as little
difficulty as one will awake his sleeping friend,
<hi>Joh.</hi> 5. 25. and shall arise refreshed, re<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>reated and
in full vigour, 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 15. 42, 43. to go about their
endless work of praises to God and the Lamb,
through the long lasting day of never ending
<pb n="177" facs="tcp:61385:93"/>
eternity, (see <hi>v. 17.)</hi> as a man after sleep ariseth
refreshed for his work. <hi>Doct.</hi> 1. As the children
of God are often pressed down with more than
ordinary sorrow and grief arising from cross dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pensations:
So sometimes there is not so much cause
of sorrow in the dispensation it self, as in their
own ignorance, which mis-represents the Lords
way of dealing, and makes it look with a more
terrible aspect than really it doth: for, those <hi>Thes<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>salonians</hi>
were excessively grieved for the death
of their friends, arising mainly from their igno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rance
of their happy estate after death, as <hi>Paul</hi>
doth here imply: <hi>for I would not have you to be
ignorant concerning them which are asleep.</hi> 2. As
there is oft-times even in Gods children some dan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gerous
ignorance of most necessary truths, if not
as to the substance yet as to the circumstances of
them, or at least a great inadvertence to, and want of
serious perpending of these truths in time of great<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>est
need, which is all one with ignorance of them
as to any present good to be reaped by them,
<hi>Matth.</hi> 16. 9. So it is a considerable part of a
Ministers duty, not only to labour upon the affe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctions
of people for making them choose and em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brace
that which is good, though he ought to do
that mainly, 2 <hi>Tim.</hi> 4. 2. but also to inform their
judgement by clearing their dangerous mistakes,
that they may be able to discern truth from er<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rour,
and that, as for other reasons, so, because of
the great influence which a darkened judgement
hath in misguiding the affections: for, it's like
they were not totally ignorant of the resurrection,
yet of some comfortable circumstances of it, or at
<pb n="178" facs="tcp:61385:94"/>
least did not seriously perpend them, which occa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sioned
their excessive grief, and therefore <hi>Paul</hi>
doth set himself to inform them: <hi>I would not
have you ignorant, that ye sorrow not.</hi> 3. It is
not granted to the most near of Christian friends
to enjoy the comfortable society of one another
alwayes, but however they may eschew all those
other sad accidents, which either do locally sepa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rate
chief friends before their death, <hi>Psal.</hi> 88. 18.
or make their society one way or other useless,
<hi>Job</hi> 13. 4, 5. yet death will inevitably make a se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>paration
at last; and therefore Christians in wis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom
ought to improve to the best advantage their
mutual society while they enjoy it: for, <hi>Paul</hi> sup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poneth
that death had removed some eminent
Christians at <hi>Thessalonica,</hi> which was cause of im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moderate
sorrow to such as were left behind,
while he saith, <hi>concerning them that are asleep,
t<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>at ye sorrow not.</hi> 4. Though believers in Jesus
Christ be freed from the curse of the Law, <hi>Gal.
3.</hi> 13. and consequently from death it self, as it is
a piece of that curse, <hi>Gen.</hi> 2. 17. yet death doth
seize even upon them, and die they must, the
Lord having so appointed, <hi>Heb.</hi> 9. 27. that through
the strait and terrible passage of death they may
have an entry unto life, <hi>Rev.</hi> 14. 13. So that
death hath changed its nature and use as to them,
and of a prison to detain them as Malefactors, it
is made a passage for them to walk safely through
to the possession of their Kingdom as victorious
Conquerours; In which respect, among others,
Christ by his death hath removed the sting of
death unto all his followers, 1 <hi>Cor. 15. 55, &amp;c.</hi>
                  <pb n="179" facs="tcp:61385:94"/>
for, <hi>Paul</hi> sheweth that even believers among them
did dye: <hi>concerning them that are asleep,</hi> saith
he. 5. There is a moderate sorrow and grief
which the Lord alloweth for the death of Christi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>an
friends, though not because of any hurt or
damage of theirs, who are thereby freed from
all sin and misery, and rendred eternally happy,
<hi>Rev.</hi> 14. 13. yet for the loss which either we or
the Church of God sustain in their removal,
2 <hi>King.</hi> 2. 12. and because the death of such is
often a forerunner of sad dayes to come, <hi>Isa.</hi> 57. 1.
for, <hi>Paul</hi> by forbidding only immoderate grief
doth tacitely allow that which is moderate: <hi>That
ye sorrow not,</hi> saith he, <hi>even as others who have
no hope.</hi> But 6. there is an immoderate and ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cessive
sorrow, either for time or measure, which
as even the Godly through infirmity are apt to
entertain, so the Lord doth disallow, and from
which he willeth Christians to refrain, as savour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
much either of want of charity to our de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceased
friends, contrary to <hi>Isa.</hi> 57. 2. or of Athe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>istical
doubtings concerning the immortality of
the soul, and a blessed Resurrection of the body,
contrary to 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 15. or at least of too great
diffidence of Gods care and providence to supply
what loss we our selves or the Church of God
do sustain by their removal, contrary to <hi>Matth.
9. last:</hi> for, <hi>Paul</hi> dischargeth this immoderate
sorrow, and upon those grounds, while he saith,
<hi>sorrow not even as others, who have no hope.</hi>
7. The serious consideration of death, and how
its nature and use is changed to believers, might
be of it self sufficient to stop the current of im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moderate
<pb n="180" facs="tcp:61385:95"/>
and excessive grief for their removal;
for his expressing their death by a <hi>sleep</hi> doth serve
for an argument to allay their immoderate grief,
the force whereof is expressed in the exposition:
<hi>concerning them that are asleep, that ye sorrow
not.</hi> 8. As Heathens, who live and die without
the knowledge of Christ, are, as to salvation, in a
case wholly hopeless and desperate: So that our
bodies, being turned to ashes in the grave, and af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
that worms have consumed our flesh <hi>(Job
19. 26.)</hi> shall again be raised the same for sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stance,
and united to our souls, is a truth which
natures light, not being inlightened by the written
word, could never comprehend, <hi>Act.</hi> 17. 32. for,
the Gentiles are said here to have been without
hope, to wit, both of salvation, and chiefly of the
Resurrection, as he afterwards explains, Now if
they could have known a Resurrection, they might
h<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>ve had hope of it: <hi>even as others,</hi> saith he, <hi>who
have no hope.</hi>
               </p>
               <q>Ver. 14. For if we believe that Jesus died and
rose again, even so them also which sleep in Je<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sus
will God bring with him.</q>
               <p>Here is a second head of the forementioned do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrine,
and a second ground of consolation, to wit,
that in Gods due time there shall be a Resurrection
unto a glorious life after death; I say, unto a glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rious
life, for the whole strain of the text doth
shew that he speaks only of the Resurrection of the
Godly, and not of the wicked unto condemnation,
mentioned <hi>Joh.</hi> 5. 29. Because that would have
<pb n="181" facs="tcp:61385:95"/>
served nothing to his present scope, which is not to
terrifie, but to comfort them against the death of
their beloved friends. See <hi>v.</hi> 18. and he proves
that there shall be such a glorious Resurrection,
first, by laying down an undoubted truth, which
he supponeth all did <hi>believe</hi> and take for granted,
to wit, that <hi>Jesus</hi> Christ the head had <hi>dyed,</hi> and af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
death <hi>arose again.</hi> 2. By inferring from this
ground, that therefore the power of God shall
raise and bring from the grave to life and immor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tality,
1 <hi>Cor. 15. those which sleep in Jesus,</hi> that
is, who are dead in Christ, and shall continue in
the faith whereby they are ingrafted in Christ,
<hi>Eph.</hi> 3. 17. to the last gasp. And he shall <hi>bring
them with Christ,</hi> that is, through vertue of their
union with him as members with their head: where
he shortly hints at the force of the inference from
Christs Resurrection to ours, to wit, because we
are so nearly united to him; to which add, that
Christs death and resurrection are an infallible fore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>runner
and necessary cause of our resurrection,
seeing by his death he destroyed death, 2 <hi>Tim.</hi> 1. 10.
and arose that he might quicken us from death, 1 <hi>Cor.
15. 20, 21. Doct.</hi> 1. As there shall be a blessed re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>surrection
of believers unto life after death: So the
faith of this truth is a singular cordial for comfort
against the terrour of death, in so far, as though
death get us once at under, yet we shall not be de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tained
by it; and dearest friends who at death do part
with grief, shall then meet with joy: for, the A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>postles
scope is to comfort them against death from
the faith of the resurrection: <hi>for if we believe,</hi>
&amp;c. 2. Concerning Christs death and resurrecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on,
<pb n="182" facs="tcp:61385:96"/>
see upon <hi>Gal. 1. 1. doct. 7. Jesus dyed and rose
again.</hi> 3. Though <hi>thus saith the Lord,</hi> and di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vine
revelation, be a ground sufficient in it self
whereupon to build our faith, <hi>Psal.</hi> 60. 6. yet such
is our unwillingness to believe, especially when the
thing spoken hath no ground in reason, <hi>Gen.</hi> 18. 12.
and so great is Gods condescendence to help and
supply our weakness, <hi>Joh.</hi> 20. 27. that he alloweth
us to make use of any other lawful mean whereby
we may strengthen our faith, and as it were reason
our selves up to a belief of that which the Lord
saith: for, so the Apostle doth teach us, to take
help from Christs death and resurrection to streng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>then
us in the faith of our own resurrection: <hi>for if
we believe,</hi> saith he, <hi>that Jesus dyed and rose
again, even so,</hi> &amp;c. 4. Among other things help<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful
to bring us to the solid and fixed belief of re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vealed
truths this is one, to single out some truths
which are more easily believed than others, as ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving,
besides the authority of God interposing for
the truth of them, some further confirmation from
humane testimony, or their powerful effects upon
our own hearts or the hearts of others, that so be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
once fixed and setled in the faith of those, we
may be thereby in some measure helped to give
credit unto all such other truths as have dependence
upon them: for <hi>Paul,</hi> to bring them to the faith
of their own resurrection, would have them im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proving
the faith they had of Christs death and
resurrection, which was confirmed by so many
witnesses, <hi>Luke</hi> 1. 1, 2. and accompanied with
wonderful effects upon the hearts of many: <hi>If we
believe that Jesus dyed and rose again, even so,</hi> &amp;c.
<pb n="183" facs="tcp:61385:96"/>
5. As those, and those only, shall attain to the bles<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed
resurrection of the just unto life, who continue
in the faith, whereby they are ingrafted in Christ,
to their last breath, <hi>Heb.</hi> 3. 14. So the union be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>twixt
Christ and believers, once made by faith is so
sure and firm, that death it self cannot dissolve it;
yea not only their souls, but also their bodies being
separate from their souls, and in a manner from
it self when dissolved in the grave to ashes, do yet
remain united to Christ: For, those whom God
shall raise to a glorious life are designed to be such
<hi>as sleep in Jesus,</hi> and living, dying, and dead are
still in him, yea and their bodies which only do pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perly
sleep are also in him: <hi>Even so also them
which sleep in Jesus</hi> will God bring with him.
6. The great prop for our faith to rest upon, as to
the truth of the resurrection, is the power of God,
whereby he is able to do what he will, <hi>Psal.</hi> 135. 6.
and to make us of new out of our own ashes, as
once at the first he made all things of nothing, <hi>Heb.
11.</hi> 3. for, he leads them to Gods power for
grounding of their confidence, while he saith, <hi>Them—will
God bring with him.</hi> 7. Through vertue
of that union betwixt believers and Christ, it com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth
to pass that whatever hath befallen Christ, as he
is the head of believers, shall in Gods due time be
verified in believers themselves, that due proportion
and distance being always kept which is betwixt
head and members: for, he inferreth that we shall
be raised because he arose, because of our union
with him: <hi>them—will God bring with him.</hi>
               </p>
               <pb n="184" facs="tcp:61385:97"/>
               <q>Ver. 15. For, this we say unto you by the word of
the Lord, that we which are alive, and remain
unto the coming of the Lord, shall not prevent
them which are a<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>leep.</q>
               <p>Followeth a third head of the forementioned do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrine,
expressing the order wherein the dead shall
arise, which serveth also for a third ground of con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>solation
against immoderate sorrow. And first, in
this verse, that he may conciliate authority to the
following doctrine, which transcends the reach of
humane reason to know and understand without
special revelation, he doth, after the manner of
the Prophets, <hi>Zech. 4.—6.</hi> premit a preface, as<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>serting
that what he was to say was <hi>by,</hi> or <hi>in the
word of the Lord,</hi> that is, in his name and by vertue
of express commission from him. 2. He sets down
the order wherein the dead were to rise, first ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gatively,
to this purpose, <hi>They which shall be then
alive and remain</hi> on earth <hi>until Christs second com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing,</hi>
as a small remnant of all that numerous com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pany
of believers who had formerly lived, but ere
then will be removed by death, that small remnant,
I say, shall not <hi>prevent</hi> or have the start of those
who are <hi>asleep</hi> or dead, to wit, neither as to their
meeting with Christ in the air, nor their actual pos<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>session
of glory, spoken of <hi>v.</hi> 17. and <hi>Paul</hi> puts
himself among those who shall be then alive, while
he speaketh in the first person, <hi>we,</hi> not as if he
had been to continue until then, but because he di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vides
all believers at Christs coming in two ranks,
the living and the dead, he doth as it were for an
<pb n="185" facs="tcp:61385:97"/>
example of the purpose in hand, place himself
among the living as he then was when he wrote:
or that he may thereby teach believers in all times
to make ready for that day, as if it were to come in
their own time, because the peremptory time when
it shall come is uncertain, <hi>Matth. 24. 42. Doct.</hi> 1.
So violent is the current of impetuous affections
when once given way to, <hi>Psal.</hi> 77. 3. so hardly are
we convinced of the evil that is in the excess of any
thing in it self lawful, and in particular in the excess
of immoderate grief, <hi>Joh.</hi> 4. 4, 9. that a word in
the by will not allay it: there must be word upon
word, and reason upon reason, to demonstrate not
only the sinfulness of it, but also that there is no
reason for it: for, <hi>Paul</hi> having given two reasons
already to allay their immoderate sorrow, he doth
here, give a third taken from the order wherein
the dead shall rise: <hi>for this we say unto you,</hi> &amp;c.
2. As Ministers should bring forth nothing for
truth, but that to which they may premit, <hi>Thus
saith the Lord:</hi> So whatever truths they deliver,
though never so far above the reach of natures
light, if once it be made known that the mouth of
the Lord hath spoken them, we ought without
further enquiry to stop our ears unto all that car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal
or corrupt reason can suggest against the truth
of them: for, being to deliver some mysterious
truths above the reach of natural understanding,
he premitteth this, that they had divine authority
for them, and therefore should have credit: <hi>for
this we say unto you by the word of the Lord,</hi>
saith he. 3. The Lord Christ shall never want a
Church of believers upon earth, which in despight
<pb n="186" facs="tcp:61385:98"/>
of Satans malice to the contrary shall still have a
being, either more conspicuously, <hi>Isa.</hi> 2. 2. or
more hidly, <hi>Rev.</hi> 12. 6. in some one place or other,
until Christs second coming: for, <hi>Paul</hi> sheweth
there will be some believers <hi>alive, and remaining
until the coming of the Lord.</hi> 4. The Lord Christ
who is now absent in his humane nature and bodily
presence in Heaven from us, <hi>Act. <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>.</hi> 21. shall again
return and at the last day be present with us, and
this not only in his power and vertue, as he is pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sent
with believers always, <hi>Matth.</hi> 28. 20. but as
God and man in both his natures: His very hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mane
nature shall be brought down from Heaven
with him, and every eye shall see him, <hi>Rev.</hi> 1. 7.
for, the word rendred <hi>coming,</hi> doth signifie a pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sence
in his being and essence, and not his power
only: <hi>unto the coming of the Lord.</hi> 5. The great
advantage which our godly friends who dye in the
Lord shall receive themselves by death<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> should al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lay
our excessive sorrow for their removal not<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>withstanding
any loss which doth thereby redound
unto us; otherwise our grief is but selfish, and car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ryeth
in it but a small regard to their happiness:
for, <hi>Paul</hi> in this and the following verse, doth la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bour
to allay their immoderate grief, because their
deceased friends received no prejudice, but great
advantage by their death: <hi>we which are alive shall
not prevent them which are asleep.</hi>
               </p>
               <pb n="187" facs="tcp:61385:98"/>
               <q>Ver. 16. For the Lord himself shall descend from
Heaven with a shout, with the voice of the
Arch-Angel, and with the Trumpet of God:
and the dead in Christ shall rise first.</q>
               <p>This verse doth, first, hold forth the glorious
and terrible manner, wherein Christ himself in
his bodily presence (see <hi>v. 15. doct. 4.)</hi> shall
descend from Heaven to Judge the world: He
shall come with great Majesty, as Kings do en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
their Royal Cities, with such solemnitie,
as great Judges do set themselves upon the
Bench, or with such terrour as Generals of
Armies do joyn Battle with the Enemy: for
the several things attributed to his coming in
this verse have in them allusions to all those.
But more particularly he shall come <hi>with a shout,</hi>
The most probable meaning is, that he himself
shall give the word of Command both to
dead and quick to compear at his Bar; which
command of his shall be proclaimed by an
<hi>Arch-Angel,</hi> that is, some one or other chief
Angel, whose proclamation shall be confirmed
by sound of <hi>Trumpet,</hi> or with some formidable
martial-like voice as of a Trumpet; called the
last Trumpet, 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 15. 52. because none shall
sound after it; and the <hi>Trumpet of God</hi> here,
because it shall ratifie the command come forth
from God, and shall sound so loud as it will be
heard far and near, even by those who are in
the graves, <hi>Joh.</hi> 5. 28. and depths of the Seas,
<pb n="188" facs="tcp:61385:99"/>
                  <hi>Rev.</hi> 20. 13. for, the excellency of a thing useth
to be set forth by this epithete, as the trees of
God, <hi>Psal.</hi> 104. 16. Next, the order wherein
the <hi>dead in Christ,</hi> that is, in the faith of Christ,
shall rise, is set down positively, <hi>they shall rise
first,</hi> that is, before those who are alive shall
partake of that glorious change mentioned, 1 <hi>Cor.
15.</hi> 51. which shall be to them in place of the
Resurrection. <hi>Doct.</hi> 1. The will of God is the
supream cause of every thing which falleth out,
wherein, being once known, we ought to ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quiesce
without farther enquiry: for, <hi>Paul</hi> giv<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
a reason, as it appears by the causal parti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cle
<hi>for,</hi> why the living shall not prevent them
which sleep, he rests on Gods will, voice and
command, enjoyning the dead to rise first: <hi>for
the Lord himself,</hi> saith he, <hi>shall descend,</hi> &amp;c.
2. The Lord Christ in his bodily presence is
now contained in Heaven, and not upon earth;
for if he were already upon earth, as the ubi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quitaries,
and maintainers of Christs bodily pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sence
in the Sacrament of the Lords Supper do
affirm, he could not be said properly to descend
to it when he cometh to judgement, but so
saith the Apostle here: <hi>The Lord himself shall
descend from Heaven.</hi> 3. Christs second com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
at the last day to judge the quick and dead,
<hi>(2 Tim. 4. 1.)</hi> shall be attended with so great
state and Royal Majesty, for the terrour of re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>probates,
2 <hi>Thes.</hi> 1. 7, 8. and comfort and glory
of the Elect, 2 <hi>Thes.</hi> 1. 10. that all the terrour,
majesty and dreadful reverence, which hath been
<pb n="189" facs="tcp:61385:99"/>
ever seen upon earth are but poor empty sha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dows
of it, and come far short of the thing it
self: He shall come accompanied with a thou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sand
times ten thousand of his glorious Angels,
<hi>Jude</hi> 14. by his mighty power shaking Heaven
and earth, <hi>Matth.</hi> 24. 29. and by the power of
his Trumpet raising the dead out of their graves,
<hi>Matth.</hi> 24. 31. and presenting them all at his seat
of Judgement, <hi>Rev.</hi> 20. 12. for, though it be
safest to decline all such high-flown, scholastick
speculations, and peremptory determinations, about
the nature of this shout, voice and trumpet here
spoken of, as are usually tossed among the School-men,
yet this much may be safely affirmed, that
those expressions do shadow forth the dreadful<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness,
terrour, and majesty of Christs second com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing,
by allusions to the most dreadful and maje<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stick
spectacles that ever were, are, or shall be
seen upon earth: <hi>He shall descend with a shout,
with the voice of the Arch-Angel, and with the
Trumpet of God.</hi> 4. As there is probable ground
from Scripture to affirm, that there are some or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders
and degrees of dignity among the blessed
Angels, some being superiour, and some being
inferiour: So all of them, even the chiefest not
excepted, are not thought too good, neither by
the Lord Christ, nor yet themselves, to be em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ployed
one way or other for the honour of
Christ, God-man, Mediator, in helping for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward
the salvation of believers: for, he men<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tioneth
here an Arch-Angel, or chief Angel, di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stinct
from Christ, and sheweth that he, with
<pb n="190" facs="tcp:61385:100"/>
many thousands of others, <hi>(Jude 14. Matth.
24. 31.)</hi> shall be employed at the last day, a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout
the work of gathering the elect out of their
graves, to meet with the Lord Christ: <hi>He shall
descend—with the voice of the Arch-Angel,</hi>
saith he. 5. It is the Lords ordinary way of
dealing with his Children, to recompence their
disadvantages wherein they seem to be cast be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hind
others, with some one or other advan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tage
or priviledge, wherein they outstrip those,
who in other things did seem to have the ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vantage
of them; that so there may be an equa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lity
in his way, even where it seemeth most un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>equal,
2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 8. 14. for it might seem some
prerogative unto those who will be found alive
at Christs coming, that they shall not taste of
death, 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 15. 51. above the lot of others who
must dye and their bodies be turned in ashes ere
then. But behold those others shall be recom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pensed
in this their seeming disadvantage, by be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
first glorified in their bodies before the then
living shall be changed, though it be most pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bable
there shall be no considerable difference of
time, 1 <hi>Cor. 15. 52. The dead in Christ shall
rise first,</hi> saith he.</p>
               <pb n="191" facs="tcp:61385:100"/>
               <q>Ver. 17. Then we which are alive and remain,
shall be caught up together with them in the
clouds, to meet the Lord in the air: and so shall
we ever be with the Lord.</q>
               <p>Here are a fourth and fifth head of the above
mentioned doctrine, concerning what shall befall
the Godly after death, being now raised: which
serve also for two further grounds of consolation.
The first of those is that <hi>then,</hi> to wit, after the<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>
dead in Christ shall rise, the godly then <hi>alive</hi> and
<hi>remaining</hi> upon earth, being first changed and
their bodies in a moment of time made confor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mable
unto Christs glorious body, 1 <hi>Cor. 15.
51, 52. Phil.</hi> 3. 21. they shall then <hi>together</hi> with
those who have arisen <hi>be caught up,</hi> and that in
the twinkling of an eye (as the word implyeth,
and other Scriptures express, 1 <hi>Cor. 15. 52.)</hi>
and caught up <hi>in the clouds,</hi> which shall serve as
Chariots in which the Saints shall be carryed up
<hi>into the air,</hi> as is said of <hi>Elias, 2 King</hi> 2. 11. and
of Christ, <hi>Act.</hi> 1. 9. and the end of their being
caught up there is to <hi>meet the Lord,</hi> upon his way
descending from Heaven to judge the world, and
to serve unto him, as his glorious train, <hi>Jude</hi> 14.
and for his assessors in the act of passing judge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment,
1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 6. 2. The second of those heads is
the great glory which all believers of both sorts
shall enjoy with Christ after that, <hi>They shall
be with him so,</hi> to wit, in that glorious man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner
both in soul and body, and this for <hi>ever,</hi> with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out
any change unto all eternity. <hi>Doct.</hi> 1. What<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever
may be the circumstantial priviledges of some
<pb n="192" facs="tcp:61385:101"/>
believers beyond others, at and after Christs se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cond
coming; yet none of them shall come short
in any thing which is required to the essence and
being of compleat and soul-satisfying happiness:
for having said, <hi>The dead in Christ shall arise first,</hi>
v. 16. he sheweth here, that both quick and dead
<hi>together shall meet the Lord, and be for ever with
him.</hi> 2. Though death doth make a sad separation
among the Godly, depriving some of the many
sweet and rare advantages which they enjoyed by
the society of others; yet herein lyeth a choice
cordial for comfort against all excessive sorrow
arising thence, that ere it be long there shall be a
joyful and comfortable meeting, not only one of
them with another, but all of them with Christ at
his second coming: for, the Apostles scope is to
comfort them against immoderate sorrow, from
that consideration: <hi>Then we which are alive shall
be caught up together with them, to meet the Lord,</hi>
saith he. 3. There shall be a glorious change
wrought at Christs second coming in the bodies
of the elect from what they now are, though not
in their substance and proportion of members,
<hi>Job</hi> 19. 26, 27. yet in their qualities; and parti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cularly,
as in other things, (see <hi>Phil. 3. 20.
doct. 11.)</hi> so in this, whereas our bodies are now
earthy, lumpish and heavy, tending downwards,
they shall then be in a kind spiritual, 1 <hi>Cor. 15.
44.</hi> active and nimble, so that they shall be easily
and without all hurt caught up on a sudden, or
made to mount up as birds, <hi>to meet the Lord Christ
in the aire,</hi> as is here affirmed. 4. However the
Godly, while here upon earth, do frequently,
<pb n="193" facs="tcp:61385:101"/>
through errour of judgement, <hi>Act.</hi> 15. 37, 38.
love to self-interest, <hi>Phil.</hi> 2. 2. with 4. and preva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lency
of some one corruption or other, 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 3. 3.
run contrary courses, rent asunder, and strive to
counter-work one another: yet when they
meet with Christ at his second coming, all
such alienation and distance shall be removed:
They shall then be perfectly one, as the father and
Christ are one, <hi>Joh.</hi> 17. 21, 22. Their different
judgements, exasperated passions, their contrary
designs, shall no more be to divide them, or keep
them asunder: for then, saith <hi>Paul, We shall all be
caught up together to meet the Lord.</hi> 5. Though
it will be doubtless no small comfort unto the
Godly, at Christs second coming, to have a comfor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>table
meeting of their old acquaintance, with whom
they prayed and wept and suffered, and of all the
eminent antient believers that ever were, <hi>Matth.
8.</hi> 11. and to have perfect union in judgement, in
heart, in affection, in one and the same song of
praise with all those, <hi>Revel.</hi> 14. 1, 2, 3. yet the
height of their happiness shall not consist in this,
but in their blessed meeting with, and enjoying the
presence of the Lord Christ, whose glorious face
and fellowship will beautifie all that famous gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral
assembly of the first born, and make them love<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly,
1 <hi>Joh.</hi> 3. 2. and without whom even the fel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowship
of glorified Saints, or Heaven it self
could not be satisfactory: for, he makes their hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>piness
to consist not so much in this that they are
caught up together, as that they are <hi>caugh up to
meet the Lord, and so shall ever be with him.</hi>
6. As there is an unspeakable fulness of satisfaction
<pb n="194" facs="tcp:61385:102"/>
in the enjoyment of Christs presence: so that en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>joyment
of it which the Saints shall have in Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven
is a far other thing, than any thing of that kind
we can attain to here; Our presence with him and
nearness to him now, is but only in our spirits, and
with his Godhead, 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 5. 6, 7. It is but mediate and
through the glass of Ordinances, 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 13. 12. It's but
frequently used, <hi>Psal.</hi> 30. 7. and no ways full, 1 <hi>Cor.
13.</hi> 12. but then shall it be both in soul and body, <hi>Job
19.</hi> 26, 27. both with his divine and humane nature,
1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 13. 12. it shall be immediate, 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 13. 12.
constant, <hi>Matth.</hi> 25. 46. and so full that they who
enjoy the meanest degree will find no lack, <hi>Psal.
17.</hi> 15. for, while he saith, <hi>they shall be ever with
the Lord so,</hi> he implyeth we will be with him in
another manner than we are now. 7. Though
even the best while here on earth are so inconstant,
fickle and changeable, that the long continuance of
any one thing proveth wearisome, yea and hardly
can they bear much of the Lords presence for any
space of time together, and not abuse it to pride,
security or carnal lightness, <hi>Psal.</hi> 30. 6, 7. yet so
great a change shall be wrought in glorified Saints,
that the long continuance of Christs blessed pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sence
without any interruption shall neither breed
satiety and loathing, nor yet be abused by them;
but the longer they do enjoy it the more they shall
be ravished with it and delighted in it, without all
fainting or remitting of their happiness unto all
eternity: for he saith, <hi>we shall be ever with the
Lord.</hi>
               </p>
               <pb n="195" facs="tcp:61385:102"/>
               <q>Ver. 18. Wherefore comfort one another with these
words.</q>
               <p>He doth here apply the forementioned doctrine,
by expressing one main use which he would have
them to improve it for, which is, that not only each
of them should thence draw matter of comfort un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to
themselves, but also administrate <hi>comfort</hi> by
<hi>these words,</hi> that is, the preceding doctrine, <hi>unto
others,</hi> especially to such as were under affliction
and grief for the death of near and Godly friends.
<hi>Doct.</hi> 1. As there is no religious truth so meerly
doctrinal, but it may be improved for some good
practical use: So then do Ministers preach, and
people learn aright, those doctrinal truths about
the nature of God his attributes, about Christ his
person, natures and offices, about the resurrection,
Christs second coming and life eternal, when their
great and furthest design, is not to inform the judge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
only in the knowledge of those truths, but
also to rectifie the affections by pressing some pra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctical
use, and the performance of some one duty
or other upon them: for <hi>Paul</hi> doth handle some
of these truths, which are as doctrinal and fall as
little under our practice as any other, by pressing
upon them thence a practical duty, even to draw
comfort from these truths for allaying excessive sor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>row:
<hi>wherefore comfort one another,</hi> saith he, <hi>with
these words.</hi> 2. As we are not to look upon the
afflictions of others as of no concernment to us,
seeing we are yet in the body, <hi>Heb.</hi> 13. 3. and may
suffer what others now feel, but as upon a call from
<pb n="196" facs="tcp:61385:103"/>
God to several duties and to more work than we
formerly had: So this is one special piece of work
to which we are hereby called, even to prove com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fortable
unto those whom the Lord hath wounded,
that being one end why the Lord doth Minister
comfort unto our selves, 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 1. 4. for, <hi>Paul</hi>
shews that the afflictions of others did call them to
this duty, and therefore he enjoyns them, <hi>comfort
one another.</hi> 3. As this duty of ministring comfort
unto those whom the Lord hath wounded is incum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bent
not only unto publick Ministers, but also unto
private Christians in a private way: So it ought
to be mutual; and therefore as a man would have
matter of comfort and not affliction added unto his
grief from others, he should labour to be comfor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>table
unto others himself, for, he enjoyneth this
duty to be gone about by all, and mutually: <hi>Where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
comfort one another,</hi> saith he. 4. The best and
choicest of comforts, for supporting the spirits of
men under afflictions of any sort, are those which
are laid up in Scripture, and pertinently drawn
from thence with a prudent application of them to
the case in hand; there being no afflicted case to
which a comfortable, full and (through Gods bles<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sing)
an effectual cure is not to be found in Scri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pture,
2 <hi>Tim.</hi> 3. 15, 16, 17. and all other com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>forts
not drawn from thence, being either vain and
naught, <hi>Isa.</hi> 55. 2. or a salve much narrower than
the sore, <hi>Prov.</hi> 18. 14. for, he bids <hi>comfort one
another with these words,</hi> to wit, those Scriptural
comforts which he had presently written.</p>

               <q>Ver. 1. BVt of the times and the seasons, bre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thren,
ye have no need that I write
unto you.</q>
               <p>The Apostle, foreseeing that some curious heads
might haply, from what he had presently written
of the Resurrection and Christs coming to Judge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment,
take occasion to enquire when should those
things be? he doth divert them from all such en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quiries,
by shewing that <hi>as to the times,</hi> that is,
the year, month, or day of Christs coming, or <hi>as
to the</hi> determinate <hi>seasons</hi> of those times, whether
<pb n="199" facs="tcp:61385:104"/>
he should come in Summer or Winter, by day or
by night, at morning, evening or midnight (see
<hi>Mark 13. 32, 35.) it was not needful for him
to write unto them</hi> any thing to that purpose, where
more is understood than expressed, to wit, that it
was impossible to know either the time or season of
his coming (as the reason used <hi>v.</hi> 2. doth prove)
and therefore it was but vain curiosity for any to
enquire concerning it. Hence Learn 1. The writ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten
word of God is so contrived, that as nothing
necessary to be known for our incitement to duty
and direction in the way to salvation is therein
omitted, 2 <hi>Tim.</hi> 3. 15. So our vain curiosity to
know other things, the knowledge whereof is not
so necessary, but would rather prove unprofitable
and hurtful, is not in the least measure thereby sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tisfied;
for it is written, <hi>chap.</hi> 4. 16. That Christ
shall come, and the manner and effects of his
coming, the knowledge of all which is necessary,
but as to the peremptory time when he should
come, the Apostle declineth to write of it, and
that because the knowledge of it was not needful:
But, saith he, <hi>of the times and seasons ye have no
need that I write.</hi> 2. It hath pleased the Lord,
in his deep wisdom and mercy, to conceal and keep
secret the definite time of Christs second coming
to Judgement, that hereby the Lords people may
be taught to watch, and to keep their hearts al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wayes
ready and prepared for it, <hi>Matth.</hi> 24. 42.
for, the expression, <hi>ye have no need that I write
of the times,</hi> implyeth they could not be known or
written of. 3. So presumptuously bold is the wit
of man, when not sanctified and better imployed,
<pb n="200" facs="tcp:61385:105"/>
as to dare to pry into the most profound of Gods
secrets; and more particularly, to search out and
determine the peremptory time, longer or shorter,
of Christs second coming, the knowledge whereof
God only wise hath reserved to himself alone,
<hi>Matth.</hi> 24. 36. for, <hi>Paul</hi> supponeth there would
be such curious enquiries, both in that and in the
following ages, and therefore laboureth to divert
the Godly from them, while he saith, <hi>of the times
and seasons ye have no need that I write.</hi> 4. The
servants of Christ are wisely to divert the Lords
people from all such curious enquiries, as being a
result of Satans policy, thereby to withdraw them
from the knowledge and study of necessary and
revealed truths, 1 <hi>Tim.</hi> 6. 4. and more especially,
they ought to divert from those enquiries which
are about the peremptory time of Christs second
coming, seeing the knowledge thereof not only
is impossible, but also would prove unprofitable
and hurtful, as tending to make the world in all
ages preceding that wherein he should come more
secure and careless: for, so doth <hi>Paul</hi> here sup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>press
all such curious enquiries, while he saith,
<hi>But of the times and seasons ye need not that I
write unto you.</hi>
               </p>
               <q>Ver. 2. For your selves know perfectly that the
day of the Lord so cometh as a thief in the
night.</q>
               <p>He gives a reason to prove the impossibility of
knowing when Christ shall come (whereof, <hi>v. 1.)</hi>
Because they <hi>themselves know perfectly</hi> and exactly,
<pb n="201" facs="tcp:61385:105"/>
as having it plainly revealed by Christ himself
while here on earth, <hi>Matth.</hi> 24. 42. that <hi>the day
of the Lord,</hi> that is, the day of Christs second
coming, so called, because he shall then come as
Lord, to judge the quick and the dead, 2 <hi>Tim.</hi> 4. 1.
they knew, I say, that this <hi>day cometh,</hi> in the pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sent
time, that is, hasteneth to come, <hi>Rev.</hi> 22. 20.
and shall come <hi>as a thief in the night,</hi> that is,
suddainly and unexpectedly, whether by night or
by day, as the thief who gives not warning before
he come to steal. See the same similitude used to
shew that Christ shall come unawares and unex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pectedly,
<hi>Matth. 24. 43, 44. Rev. 3. 3. 2 Pet.
3.</hi> 10. whence he leaves unto them to gather that it
is not possible to know the time and season of his
coming. <hi>Doct.</hi> 1. However in points of truth
not clearly revealed, and those which are not of
such absolute necessity to salvation, the Lords peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple
may live in suspence without determining them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves
peremptorily either to the one hand or the
other, <hi>Act.</hi> 1. 7. yet it is their duty, and will be in
some measure aimed at by them, to have the exact
knowledge of necessary truths, and of such as are
most clearly revealed: for this truth, about the
unexpectedness of Christs second coming, was ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cessary
and clearly revealed, and therefore they
knew it perfectly or exactly. 2. So ready are we
to forget, even those truths which we perfectly
know, under a violent fit of some tentation, and
when we need to remember them most, <hi>Heb.</hi> 12. 5.
that the Lords Ministers must not think it wholly
unnecessary, but sometimes profitable, to inculate
of new upon the Lords people, and put them in re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>membrance
<pb n="202" facs="tcp:61385:106"/>
of those truths, which they already
know: for, though they <hi>knew</hi> perfectly, <hi>that the
day of the Lord cometh as a thief in the night,</hi> yet
he doth here tell them of it, and inculcates it, <hi>v. 3.
Doct.</hi> 3. It is but a groundless dream, and anti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>scriptural
opinion, maintained by some of the anci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ents,
and now by the Papists, that the Antichrist
mentioned in Scripture shall be an individual person,
who shall have his rise in the world precisely three
years and an half before Christs second coming;
for if so, then at that time the very month and day
of Christs coming to Judgement should be exactly
known, the contrary whereof is here affirmed, to
wit, <hi>that the day of the Lord cometh</hi> unexpectedly
and <hi>as a thief in the night.</hi> 4. So great should be
our desire to profit in knowledge and sanctified
practice, and our skill and dexterity to improve
all occurrences for that end should be such, as to
bring meat out of the eater, and from the worst of
sinful examples to learn somewhat tending, either
by way of resemblance or otherwayes, to clear or
confirm spiritual truths to the understanding, and
to enforce the practice of some spiritual duty upon
the will and affections, <hi>Luke 18. 1, &amp;c.</hi> for the
Apostle takes occasion to clear this necessary truth,
and to inforce the duty of watchfulness following
upon it, <hi>v.</hi> 6. from the sinful practice of <hi>a thief,</hi>
who cometh unexpectedly in the night to his prey.</p>
               <pb n="203" facs="tcp:61385:106"/>
               <q>Ver. 3. For when they shall say, peace and safety;
then sudden destruction cometh upon them, as
travail upon a woman with child; and they shall
not escape.</q>
               <p>He doth here, first, both clear what was meant
by the former similitude, to wit, the unexpected<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness
of Christs second coming; and also prove that
it shall be unexpected, from the terrible effects
thereof, to wit, <hi>sudden</hi> and unexpected <hi>destruction,</hi>
and that both of soul and body (as the word is
usually taken, see 2 <hi>Thes. 1. 9. 1 Tim. 6. 9.)</hi>
which destruction shall <hi>come,</hi> or, as the word sig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nifieth,
at unawares surprize the wicked (for of
those only he meaneth, as <hi>v.</hi> 4. doth clear) who
at that time shall be arrived at such an height of
carnal security as <hi>to say,</hi> that is, not only secretly
promise unto themselves in their heart, <hi>Psal.</hi> 14. 1.
but also openly declare, if not by their mouth, yet
by their deeds (for men do speak also by these,
<hi>Tit. 1. 16.)</hi> that they have no fear of approaching
judgement, and do look for nothing but continued
<hi>peace and safety,</hi> that is, full immunity (as his
using two words to one sense doth imply) from
any trouble of that sort in their sinful course.
Next, he gives some properties of this destruction,
first, in a similitude of the pains and <hi>travel of a
woman with child,</hi> which, besides the unexpected<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness
and suddenty of it, as to the hour and mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
of time wherein it shall come, whereof al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ready,
holds forth the horrible pain and torment
of it, the pains of a woman in child-birth being
<pb n="204" facs="tcp:61385:107"/>
most sharp, exquisite, and for the time almost not
supportable. Secondly, in plain and proper terms,
he shews it shall be inevitable, <hi>They shall not escape.</hi>
In the Original the negation is doubled, which ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording
to the property of that language denyeth
most strongly, as if he had said, there shall be no
imaginary possiblity to get it shifted, so that their
destruction shall be 1. sudden, 2. painful, and
3. inevitable. <hi>Doct.</hi> 1. As sin continued in beget<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth
carnal security, and draweth the sinner at length
to misbelieve and despise whatever the word of
the Lord doth threaten against him for it, <hi>Deut.
29.</hi> 19. So an height of security, and atheistical
contempt of divine threatnings, is an infallible
mark of a wicked, godless and unrenewed heart:
for, so much doth he teach while he speaks not
of the wicked expresly, but only describes them
from their height of security, which long conti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nuance
in sin should at length drive them to, as
from an infallible evidence of a wicked man: <hi>for
when they shall say peace and safety.</hi> 2. There
is not any one more speaking evidence of approach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
judgement of one kind or other, than carnal
security in sin, and wickedness arrived to such an
height, as to make men wholly fearless of Gods
judgement and atheistical mockers at all threatnings
which forewarn them of it: for, saith he, <hi>when
they shall say peace and safety, then sudden de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>struction
cometh.</hi> 3. What ever grounds of con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fidence,
or undoubted perswasion flowing from
those grounds, a wicked man may have to escape
a threatned judgement; yet all shall serve t<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap> little
purpose, when God beginneth in earnest to reckon
<pb n="205" facs="tcp:61385:107"/>
with him; his strongest fancy, with all its grounds,
will prove but a weak bulwark to bear off the over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flowing
waves of Divine wrath, when the haile
shall sweep away the refuge of lies, and the wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters
shall overflow the hiding place, <hi>Isa.</hi> 28. 17.
for, the word rendred <hi>safety</hi> implyes they should
have a certain perswasion of safety as if they were
above all doubt, and this doubtless upon some
grounds satisfactory to themselves, and yet for all
that, even <hi>then sudden destruction shall come upon
them,</hi> and at unawares surprize them: 4. As a
lingring death hath in it much of mercy even to
wicked men, who have thereby time and leisure
given them to repent, and to plead with God for
mercy, <hi>Rev.</hi> 2. 21.—So of all deaths or
wayes of calling sinners to an account, those which
are sudden and make quick dispatch are to a wicked
liver most dangerous, as hardly leaving any place
either for Gods patience or mans repentance, but
making an end of the person stricken before he can
solidly think upon his end: for, he placeth a great
part of the terrour of the destruction threatned,
in that it should be sudden and unexpected: <hi>Then
sudden destruction cometh upon them.</hi> 5. Though
none can know the peremptory day, month or year
of Christs second coming (see <hi>v. 1. doct. 2.)</hi> yet
there are certain signs from which, when they shall
fall out, a man may certainly know that the day
of the Lord is near approaching, such as these, a
general height of carnal security, <hi>Matth. 24.
38,</hi> 39. the conversion of the Jews, <hi>Rom.</hi> 11. 15.
and total destruction of the Antichrist, 2 <hi>Thes.</hi>
                  <pb n="206" facs="tcp:61385:108"/>
2. 8. for, besides other things, so much may be
implyed in this similitude, whereby Christs second
coming and the destruction of the wicked which
doth accompany it are compared <hi>to travail upon a
woman with child,</hi> who though she know not the
very day and hour when her pains shall take her,
yet she hath certain signs whereby to know that
her time approacheth. 6. The pain and horrour
which the day of the Lord shall bring on Godless
reprobates is such, that no tongue can utter, nor
can it be expressed in proper terms so as we might
conceive it, yea and such, as the greatest of all
earthly torments are but weak shadows and slen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der
representations of it, and too little to express
it: for, therefore doth the spirit of God, alwayes
while speaking of this destruction, make use of
borrowed similitudes from the most terrible of
earthly and bodily torments, as of those occasioned
by fire, <hi>Mark 9—45.</hi> by fire of brimstone,
<hi>Rev.</hi> 21. 8. by an eating worm never dying, <hi>Mark
9.</hi> 46. and here the pains and torment of a wo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man
in travail; all which doubtless come far
short of expressing to the full that pain and tor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
which is incomparable, incomprehensible,
and cannot be expressed, but by such shadows and
representations. 7. Even damned souls and the
most profane and lawless of Godless reprobates
are not only overruled by and under the dominion
of a divine providence, but shall also know so much
by sad experience when in the great day, nill they
will they, they shall appear before their dreadful
Judge and receive their sad and woful sentence from
<pb n="207" facs="tcp:61385:108"/>
his blessed mouth, and be presently made without all
delay or shifting to undergoe it: for, saith <hi>Paul,
they shall not escape.</hi>
               </p>
               <q>Ver. 4. But ye, brethren, are not in darkness, that
that day should overtake you as a thief.</q>
               <p>Lest the Godly should be terrified, and shaken
with the apprehension and fear of that suddain de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>struction
presently mentioned, he doth here cast
in a seasonable word of comfort for all such, against
the terrour of it, as appeareth from his entrance
made to the present purpose, with an adversative
particle <hi>But.</hi> And first, he propoundeth the
ground of the following comfort, namely, that <hi>they,</hi>
to wit, as many of them to whom he writeth as
were sincere believers in Jesus Christ (for so must
this indefinite compellation, and that note of uni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>versality
also, <hi>v.</hi> 5. be understood according to the
use of Scripture elsewhere, 1 <hi>Cor. 15. 22.)</hi> none
such I say, were in darkness, that is, they were
not living in their gross and natural ignorance of
God, nor yet in carnal security or Godless profani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty;
for the word <hi>darkness</hi> doth point at both those
here, as elsewhere in Scripture, <hi>Rom. 2. 19. 1 Joh.
1—6</hi>—Next, he expresseth the comfort it self
flowing from this ground, to this purpose, that
however the precise day and time of Christs second
coming could not be known by them, no more than
by the wicked, <hi>Matth.</hi> 24. 36. yet it should not
<hi>overtake</hi> them, or (as the word implyeth) violent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
apprehend them to their hurt and prejudice, as
a thief and robber doth apprehend the person and
<pb n="208" facs="tcp:61385:109"/>
goods of those whom he spoiles and destroyeth.
Now the force of the inference, whereby he draw<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth
the present consolation from the forementioned
ground, doth lye in the similitude; take it thus,
that as a thief can only do hurt to those who are
sleeping securely in the dark night, and not to
others: So this terrible day could do no hurt to
them, because it should not find them lying secure
in the dark night of ignorance or impiety. <hi>Doct.</hi> 1.
The truly Godly, and they to whom the terrible
threatnings of eternal judgement do least belong,
are of such a tender frame and temper of heart
<hi>(Isa. 66. 2.)</hi> that usually they are most affected,
sadded and discouraged by them, when Godless
livers, to whom they properly appertain, are so
little moved with them that they rather mock them,
2 <hi>Pet.</hi> 3. 4. for, <hi>Paul</hi> did foresee so much, while
presently after he had denounced sudden destructi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
to come upon secure reprobates, he seeth a ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cessity
to guard the Godly against the terrour of
it: <hi>But ye, brethren, are not in darkness,</hi> saith he,
2. It concerneth therefore the wise and faithful
servant of Christ so to denounce the terrible threat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nings
of everlasting wrath against the wicked, as
that he presently caution them for the comfort of
the Godly; lest otherwise they, for whom they
are not intended, be dejected, shaken and discou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>raged
by them: for, so doth <hi>Paul</hi> here guard the
former threatning with a <hi>But ye, brethren.</hi> 3. A
prudent Minister should labour so to guard against
the terrour and dejection of the Godly by denoun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ced
threatnings, as the contrary comfort be not pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>posed
absolutely unto any, but suspended upon
<pb n="209" facs="tcp:61385:109"/>
such conditions as are required in the promise, that
so the party who would have comfort may not be
deceived, but put himself to a fair tryal by those
marks, if he be one of those to whom the intended
comfort doth belong; for, <hi>Paul</hi> being to comfort
the Godly against that terrible destruction threat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned,
<hi>v.</hi> 3. he mentions the condition upon which
they might escape it, to wit, if <hi>they were not in
darkness,</hi> which he affirmeth of them all, or of a
great many of them, at least in the judgement of
charity, and thereby leaveth it unto themselves to
search if they were so in reality: <hi>But ye, brethren,
are not in darkness, that that day should overtake
you.</hi> 4. As the truly Godly and real believers in
Jesus Christ are freed, at least, from the gross
darkness of their natural ignorance and Godless
profanity: and as to be lying under either of those
doth argue a man to be yet in his unrenewed state:
So the best security which a man can promise to
himself against the terrour of sudden and unexpect<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
stroaks, doth lye in his saving knowledge of
God in Christ, and in the testimony of a good con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>science
arising from the shining light of an honest
and holy life: for, <hi>Paul</hi> affirms it universally of all
real believers, <hi>they are not in darkness,</hi> either of
gross ignorance or Godless profanity, and maketh
that their ground of comfort to secure them, <hi>that
the day of the Lord should not overtake them as a
thief.</hi>
               </p>
               <pb n="210" facs="tcp:61385:110"/>
               <q>Ver. 5. Ye are all the children of light, and the
children of the day: we are not of the night,
nor of darkness.</q>
               <p>He insists upon the former ground of comfort,
first by proving the truth of it, that they were
not in darkness, because they were children of light,
that is (according to an usual Hebraism, <hi>Matth.
11. 19.)</hi> they were not only indued with saving
knowledge and holiness (both which in Scripture
go under the name of light, <hi>Joh. 3. 19. Matth.
5. 16.)</hi> but also were regenerate and born of God,
1 <hi>Joh.</hi> 2. 29. (who is that light inaccessible, 1 <hi>Tim.
6. 16.)</hi> by the Preaching of the Word, <hi>Jam.</hi> 1. 18.
which also hath the name of light, <hi>Psal.</hi> 119. 105.
And they are called <hi>children of the light and of
the day,</hi> to shew that the light of knowledge and
holiness, wherewith they were indued, was not a
dark glimmering light, as of a candle or twilight,
but most clear, as the light of the full and perfect
day; and this as it seems, in opposition to that lesser
measure of light which was enjoyed under the old
Testament; See upon <hi>Gal. 4. 3. doct.</hi> 2. and <hi>v. 5.
doct.</hi> 3. Secondly, by illustration of the proof,
while he removeth from them the contrary, not
only gross ignorance and profanity under the name
of <hi>night,</hi> but also a comparative measure of those,
under the name of <hi>darkness. Doct.</hi> 1. As souls
affrighted with the terrour of God, are often most
averse from receiving the comforts allowed to them
of God: So the Lords Ministers may not grow
weary of taking pains to clear their doubts, and
<pb n="211" facs="tcp:61385:110"/>
work them up to the embracing of them: for,
<hi>Paul</hi> supponing the Godly might possibly not
have closed with the propounded comfort at the
first hearing, doth here insist upon it: <hi>ye are all
the children of light.</hi> 2. As the doubts of dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>couraged
and afflicted Christians are not so much
about the re<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>lity of the comfort it self held forth
by the word, for a suitable cure to their discon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>solate
case, as about their own interest in that com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fort
and right to lay hold upon it: So a Minister
in dealing with such would not so much, or only
insist in propounding and urging a suitable com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fort,
as in clearing up unto them and pressing up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
them to make sure work of their interest in
it, and right to lay hold upon it: for, <hi>Paul</hi> sup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poning
that their doubt would lye about their not
being in darkness, which he held forth as the
ground and evidence of their interest in the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fort,
doth insist mainly in the clearing of that,
while he saith, <hi>ye are all the children of light,</hi>
&amp;c. 3. The Kingdoms of light and darkness, of
saving knowledge and dark ignorance, of grace
and profanity, of Christ and Belial, of God and
the Devil, are so much inconsistent that they cannot
co-incide in one and the same person; neither can
any man be a subject of both Kingdoms at one
and the same time: for, the Apostle maketh the
denyal of the one to follow upon the affirmation of
the other: <hi>we are all the children of light,</hi> saith he,
<hi>we are not of the night or of darkness.</hi> 4. The
Minister of Christ ought so to deliver suitable
truths unto the Lords people for their incitement
to duty, for their comfort against discouragements,
<pb n="212" facs="tcp:61385:111"/>
for their reproof or conviction, as that he takes
his own allowed share and portion of those truths
unto himself, as if he were an ordinary hearer;
otherwise he cannot both save himself and them
who hear him, according to the promise, 1 <hi>Tim.
4.</hi> 16. for, <hi>Paul</hi> doth change the person, in the
close of the verse, and takes a share of what he
distributes to others unto himself, both here and in
the following verses: <hi>we are not of the night and
of darkness,</hi> saith he.</p>
               <q>Ver. 6. Therefore let us not sleep as do others; but
let us watch, and be sober.</q>
               <p>The Apostle, having now put a close to his di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gression,
about the state of believers after death
and Christs second coming, which he entred upon,
<hi>chap. 4. v.</hi> 15. doth again return to press upon
them some other branches of that sanctification
required by God, and spoken of <hi>chap. 4. v. 3—</hi>
And first, from what he hath presently said of the
unexpectedness of Christs second coming, he ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>horteth
to the exercise of two vertues, tending
much to keep them in a readiness for that day, to
wit, watchfulness and sobriety. And he presseth
them, first, by forbidding them the contrary
vices, under the name of <hi>sleeping as others,</hi> to
wit, as ungodly men, children of darkness:
where by <hi>sleeping</hi> is not meant <hi>sleep</hi> proper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
taken, and of the body, binding the outward
senses, so that for the time they cease to do their
office, for this sleep being moderately taken is al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowed
by God, and given by him as a blessing,
<pb n="213" facs="tcp:61385:111"/>
                  <hi>Psal.</hi> 127. 2. and some who, it's like, will be
found sleeping thus at the last day shall be saved,
<hi>Luke</hi> 17. 34. although excess even of bodily sleep
be a sin, <hi>Prov.</hi> 24. 33. and may be here in the se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cond
place look'd at, either as a cause, concomitant,
or effect of that spiritual sleep here forbidden,
which is no other than that deep sleep of carnal
security, whereby all the spiritual senses of a man,
who is taken with it, are bound up, <hi>Matth.</hi> 13. 15.
so that he regards not his duty, <hi>Matth.</hi> 25. 3, 5.
is wholly fearless of threatned judgements, <hi>Deut.
29.</hi> 19. and besorteth himself with such content<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments
and pleasures as he can find in this pre<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

life, <hi>Luke</hi> 12. 16, 17, 18. In which sense this
word is used, <hi>Mark 13. 36. Eph.</hi> 5. 14. And he
presseth them next, by enjoyning the exercise of the
vertues themselves: and first, that they should
<hi>watch,</hi> whereby he doth not so much mean watch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fulness
of the body, though that be also sometimes
very necessary, and therefore required by Christ,
<hi>Matth.</hi> 26. 4. as spiritual watchfuln<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

his inward and spiritual senses free and exercised,
<hi>Matth.</hi> 13. 16. so that he do<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

and discern the voice of God in his word and
dispensations calling him to every duty, <hi>Hab.</hi> 2. 1.
but also is intent upon it, <hi>Psal.</hi> 119. 32. careful to
take up, 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 11. 2, 3. and guard against such
tentations as would divert him from it, <hi>Matth.
16.</hi> 23. or ensnare him in the contrary sin, <hi>Mat.
26.</hi> 41. and is alwayes making ready how to meet
comfortably with God in any future dispensation
of mercy or terrour, <hi>Job</hi> 3. 25, 26. Secondly,
<pb n="214" facs="tcp:61385:112"/>
that they should be <hi>sober,</hi> whereby he enjoyneth
not only sobriety and temperance (strictly taken)
in the moderate and sober use of meat and drink,
<hi>Eccles.</hi> 10. 17. but more largely also, as it mode<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rates,
and boundeth our affections in the pursuit
and use of all things earthly, 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 7. 29, 30, 31.
for not only excess of wine, but the cares of this
world, and the prevalency of any other lust, have
an inebriating vertue, disturbing the reason and
oppressing the senses, see <hi>Luk. 21. 34. Doct.</hi> 1.
Ministers should so press the faith of priviledges,
and use-making of allowed comforts upon the Lords
people, and people should so improve their pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viledges;
and comforts, as that neither of them be
abused for a sleeping pillow to foster negligence,
but both of them improved as incitements to du<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty:
and comforts should be so mind<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

                  </gap>d as duty be

                  </gap> the most comfortable
promises will prove but dry breasts, seeing the
Lords ordinary way is to enliven comforts unto
his people, when they are most diligent in the way
of their duty, <hi>Dan. 9. <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>0,</hi> 21. For, <hi>Paul</hi> having
asserted their priviledge of being freed from dark<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness,
and inferred thence their comfort that the ter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rour
of that day should not overtake them, <hi>v.</hi> 4, 5.
he draweth an argument from both, to incite them
to their duty, <hi>Therefore,</hi> saith he, <hi>let us not sleep.</hi>
2. The undoubted certainty of divine promises,
made to believers for their preservation from
judgement and wrath, do no wayes of themselves
tend to cherish neglect of duty, but rather to ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cite
them to greater diligence<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> as that which is a
mean appointed of God for furthering the promise
<pb n="215" facs="tcp:61385:112"/>
to an accomplishment, <hi>Ezek.</hi> 36. 37. For, <hi>Paul</hi>
having given to believers among them a most un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>doubted
promise that the terrour of that day should
not apprehend them to their hurt, <hi>v.—5.</hi> he in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferreth
thence, <hi>therefore let not us sleep.</hi> 3. A pos<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sibility
to meet with a sudden stroke and unexpected
tryal, hath in it a call and voice unto the Lords
people to shake off security and laziness, and be
upon their guard lest they be suddenly taken and
surprized by it: for, from what he spoke also, <hi>v.</hi> 23.
of that sudden unexpected coming of the day of the
Lord, he inferreth here, <hi>Therefore let not us sleep.</hi>
4. Then do we make a good use of bad examples,
when we so look on them, as not to imitate them,
but to scare us from the like, while we hate, ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hor
and detest them: for he propones the ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ample
of other secure sinners as a reason to dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>swade
them from the like, <hi>Let not us sleep as do
others.</hi> 5. The wise Lord doth sometimes exercise
his people by propounding to them a possible
hazard of meeting with an unexpected tryal with
which he doth not intend ever to assay them; and
this in mercy to them, that the apprehension of an
uncertain hazard, may put them upon the exercise
of some piece of necessary duty, which otherwise
would possibly have been neglected: for Christs
unexpected coming, mentioned <hi>v.</hi> 2, 3. was not
to fall out in their time, and yet it is held out unto
them as a thing possible, the good whereof is here
expressed, even, that thereby they might be excited
to the exercise of sobriety and watchfulness.
<hi>Therefore—let us watch and be sober.</hi> 6. As
a man who would make conscience to exercise any
<pb n="216" facs="tcp:61385:113"/>
grace and vertue, must set himself to abandon the
contrary vice; So the work of through and full
mortification of any sin is then carryed on to pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pose,
when we do not rest upon a bare surceasing
from it, but set about the practice of the contrary
duty; for, in pressing the exercise of those vertues
he forbids the contrary vices, and while he forbid<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deth
security he exhorts them to exercise the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary
vertues: <hi>let us not sleep, but let us watch and
be sober.</hi> 7. The exercise of these two graces,
watchfulness and sobriety, do best together, and
hardly can be separate the one from the other;
in so far, as an unsober heart overcharged with
surfetting, drunkenness and the cares of this life
cannot discharge the duties of watchfulness men<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tioned
in the exposition, and an unwatchful heart
that is not intent upon duty, and guarding against
tentations contrary to it, cannot choose but be
ensnared by the subtle and alluring tentations of
worldly pleasures and advantage, <hi>Mal.</hi> 2. 15, 16.
and to exceed the bounds of moderation in the
pursuit and use of things earthly, <hi>Luk.</hi> 21. 34.
and consequently prove unsober: for, therefore
doth the spirit of God, not only here but else<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>where,
enjoyn the exercise of those two vertues.
<hi>Let us watch and be sober.</hi>
               </p>
               <pb n="217" facs="tcp:61385:113"/>
               <q>Ver. 7. For they that sleep, sleep in the night;
and they that be drunken are drunken in the
night. 8. But let us who are of the day, be sober,—</q>
               <p>Here is a reason to enforce the former exhorta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion,
to wit, because sleep and drunkenness are the
works of darkness, for going about whereof men
do usually (if they be not all the more sluggish
and enslaved to their lusts, <hi>Jer. 6. 15.)</hi> choose the
night season. The truth of which reason doth
hold whether we take the words to mean of <hi>sleep,
drunkenness,</hi> and <hi>night,</hi> properly so called, or if
we take them improperly as they were formerly
exponed, <hi>v.</hi> 4. 5, 6. for hardly will any other
than they who are in the night of their natural
darkness and unrenewed state give themselves to
the deep sleep of carnal security and to spiritual
drunkenness or an over-burthening and besotting
themselves with the cares and pleasures of this
present life, 1 <hi>Thes.</hi> 4. 5. This is <hi>v.</hi> 7. Whence he
inferrs that seeing they <hi>were of the day,</hi> that is, de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>livered
from the dark night of their natural igno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rance,
born of God, and endued with the most
clear light of saving knowledge and holiness, as
was affirmed <hi>v.</hi> 5. that therefore in very common
honesty they behoved to shun those works of
darkness, and live in the exercise of Christian so<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>briety,
and consequently of watchfulness also, the
one of which graces cannot be separate in exercise
from the other; see <hi>v. 6. doct.</hi> 7. This is <hi>v. 8.—
Doct.</hi> 1. Things lawful and allowed should be gone
<pb n="218" facs="tcp:61385:114"/>
about in their convenient season which God and
nature hath allotted for them<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> and the wrong
timeing of a thing in it self allowed, may make it
be imputed unto us for sin: for, taking the words
in their proper sense, he shews that the time in
which men do usually take their sleep, as most con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venient
for it, is the night and not the day: <hi>for,
they that sleep, sleep in the night.</hi> 2. As the Lord
hath left some common principles of conscience,
modesty, and common honesty, imprinted by na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture
upon the hearts of men, to serve for a restraint
unto them from arriving at the utmost height of
sin and wickedness at the first, and while through
custome of sinning they be either weakened or ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinguished;
So when men do openly avow their
sin and profanity, and transgress all bounds of mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>desty,
and common honesty, it speaks them ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rived
at a greater height of sin and wickedness than
was usual to be found among the grossest of Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gans:
for they were not so shameless as to avow
their drunkenness, but being restrained somewhat
by modesty and respect to common honesty were
only <hi>drunken in the night.</hi> 3. As an unrenewed
man is a very prey to the most shameless of ten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tations,
which Satan is pleased to assault him with,
or to enslave him by; So the sin of gross ignorance
of God, and the way to Heaven, is that which
exposeth the unrenewed man most to be preyed
upon without resistance by any other sin: for, ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king
the words improperly, he makes the man un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>renewed
who is in the night, to be enslaved to
carnal security, intemperance, and a kind of spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritual
besottedness with things of a present life,
<pb n="219" facs="tcp:61385:114"/>
and doth not obscurely hint at his dark ignorance,
for which mainly his unrenewed state is compared
to the night, as the great cause of all his slavery:
<hi>they that sleep, sleep in the night; they that are
drunken, are drunken in the night.</hi> 4. A gra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cious
state must, and will be attended with graci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous
actions and an holy conversation suitable unto
that state; and therefore a man ought not so much
to look to what others do, as to what the state of
grace, unto which he pretends, doth call upon him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>self
to do: for, he enforces the exercise of sobriety
upon them, from this, that they were <hi>of the day,</hi> in
a gracious state of saving knowledge, without re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>garding
what others who were not in that state
did. <hi>But let us,</hi> saith he, <hi>who are of the day be
sober.</hi> 5. Though there be such a necessary con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nexion
betwixt a gracious state, and an holy con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>versation,
yet such is our natural averseness from
holiness, <hi>Rom.</hi> 8. 7. so strong an interest hath sin
in the best, <hi>Rom.</hi> 7. 23. and so many are the ten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tations
and difficulties we have to wrestle through
in the way of our duty, <hi>Eph.</hi> 6. 11, 12. that even
the renewed man hath need of reiterated and se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rious
exhortations enforced by most cogent rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sons
to press him to it: for, though he shews that
their present gracious state did engage them to

the Christian souldier in this spiritual conflict;
for where faith, love and hope are, there is no
grace wanting. Neither doth he any thing su<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perfluous,
<hi>Eph.</hi> 6. 14. in shewing the necessity
distinctly, and the right way of improving of se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veral
other graces of Gods Spirit, in this spiritual
warfare, seeing he doth there speak of it at greater
length, and holds forth the terrour of our spiritu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>al
adversaries, and the several distinct tentations,
either more expresly or implicitely, whereby they
assault us in this battel. Besides what is already
observed from <hi>Eph. 6. 14, &amp;c.</hi> upon the several
pieces of the spiritual armour and those of them
in particular which are here mentioned, and the
nature of that spiritual conflict and battel which
they do suppone, Learn further, 1. The great cause
why men pretending for Heaven and happiness, do
so much besot themselves with things earthly, and
are so little intent upon their duty, and watchful
against tentations, is, their great mistake and igno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rance,
as if the way to Heaven were easie, beset
with no difficulties, and men might go to Heaven
with ease and sleeping; and therefore a chief in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>citement
to sobriety and watchfulness, and to shake
off security and laziness is to set before us often
all those insuperable difficulties and terrible oppo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sition
which we are of necessi<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

                  </gap>y to meet with in
our way to Heaven and happiness; for, to make
them watch and be sober, he minds them of the
spiritual battel which they behoved to fight.
<hi>Putting on the breast-plate of faith,</hi> &amp;c. 2. As
<pb n="222" facs="tcp:61385:116"/>
in bodily wars, drunkards, and sleepy sluggards
can never be good souldiers: so secure souls that
cannot watch, and unsober spirits oppressed and
entangled with an excessive weight of worldly
cares or love to any other lust, will prove but
cowards, and never strike a fair stroke, so long as
they are such, in this spiritual conflict: for, so much
is implyed while he joyneth the exercise of
watchfulness and sobriety with the right use-ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king
of the Christian armour in this spiritual
combate, <hi>let us—be sober, putting on the
breast-plate of faith,</hi> saith he. 3. As the malice
of Satan, our great adversary in this spiritual
conflict <hi>(Ephes. 6. 12.)</hi> doth bend it self most to
strike at, and destroy those things wherein the life
and being of a Christian, as a Christian, doth
most consist, such as his interest in Christ, right
to Heaven, his knowledge of those, plyable incli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nation
to duty, his spiritual sense and motion: So
the care of a Christian should run most to provide
a sufficient guard for those, even the constant ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ercise
of those three graces mentioned in the
text: for he alludes to souldiers, whose great
care is to guard their breast, where the heart the
first fountain of life is, with a breast-plate,
and their head, the original <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

with an helmet, <hi>putting on the breast-plate of
faith and love, and for an helmet the hope of
salvation.</hi> 4. The grace of <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>aith is a most ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cessary
piece of the spiritual armour, and almost
of universal use to defend the Christian souldi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er
in this spiritual conflict; for, therefore doth
<pb n="223" facs="tcp:61385:116"/>
                  <hi>Paul</hi> make it answer to two parts of the bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dily
armour, the shield, <hi>Eph.</hi> 6. 16. and the
breast-plate here, <hi>putting on the breast-plate of
faith.</hi> 5. The exercise of love to God and our
neighbour must needs be joyned with faith, other<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wise
faith doth prove but an useless breast-plate,
and of no force to secure the vital parts of a
Christian in this spiritual conflict: for <hi>Paul</hi>
conjoynes them to make up the breast-plate, <hi>put<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting
on the breast-plate of faith and love,</hi> saith
he. 6. The believing souldier will not alwayes
meet with present performance of the good things
promised upon his closing with the promise by
faith, but often the Lord for wise reasons doth
exercise him with long delayes, <hi>Heb.</hi> 11. 13. and
sometimes with contrary appearances to sense,
<hi>Gen.</hi> 15. 4, 5. with 18. 1. which Satan doth im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prove
as subtle Engines to batter down and pierce
his breast-plate of faith as a thing irrational,
groundless, contrary to sense, and which will ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver
attain the promised blessings, <hi>Gen.</hi> 18. 11, 12.
for if it were not thus, there should be no need
of the helmet of hope as an additional part of
this spiritual armour to strengthen the breast-plate
of faith under delayed performance. <hi>And for an
helmet the hope of salvation,</hi> saith he.</p>

                  </gap>rally inforce the
preceeding exhortation to the exercise of watch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fulness
and sobriety, and to arme themselves with
the forementioned graces for a spiritual combat,
from Gods decree of bringing the elect to eter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal
life, not without, but in the practice of holy
duties, 2 <hi>Thes.</hi> 2. 13. and also he seemeth more
particularly to give them some incouragements
to exercise their hope of salvation mentioned,
<hi>v.—8.</hi> from the certainty of salvation ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ped
for; whereof he giveth two grounds, first,
Gods eternal decree whereby he had <hi>appointed</hi> or
ordained and predestinated them (as the word is
rendred, <hi>Act. 13. 47. 1 Pet. 2. 8.)</hi> not to eter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal
wrath and destruction, but <hi>to obtain salvation.</hi>
The word rendred, <hi>obtain,</hi> signifieth to purchase,
or, to do much about a thing to obtain it, which
purchasing is here ascribed not to themselves,
<hi>Tit.</hi> 3. 5. but to Jesus Christ, <hi>Act.</hi> 20. 28. and
this is here given as the second prop of a Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stians
hope, upon which the certainty of the
elects salvation depends, even that salvation, which
was ordained for them in the decree, is purchased
and obtained by Christ. <hi>Doct.</hi> 1. The certainty
of salvation, either in it self or to us, is so far
from being in its own nature a pillow to foster
security or carnal ease, that it's a strong incite<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
<pb n="225" facs="tcp:61385:117"/>
to duty, and to charge through all difficulties
with courage, which we may be assaulted with
in our Christian course, yea nothing weakeneth
the hands of a Christian Souldier more than dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fidence
and distrust of success: for he holds
forth the certainty of their salvation as an incite<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
to the forementioned duties (and more espe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cially
to kyth themselves valorous souldiers in
this spiritual conflict:) <hi>for God hath not appointed
us to wrath,</hi> saith he. 2. As the elect may at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain
to know assuredly that they are elected (see
upon <hi>Eph. 1. 4. doct. 2.)</hi> So neither the decree
of election nor their most certain perswasion of
the same do of their own nature render them se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cure
or remiss in duty, but rather doth strongly
incline and incite them to the exercise of sobriety
and watchfulness and of all other graces, seeing
this is the way resolved upon by God for bring<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
the eternal decree of election to an accom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plishment,
2 <hi>Thes.</hi> 2. 13. for he mentions the de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cree
of his and their election, as both certain in it
self, and also known to him and some among them,
as a strong incitement to the exercise of all the fore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mentioned
vertues: <hi>for God hath not appointed us
to wrath.</hi> 3. So great and insuperable are those
difficulties which stand in the way of the salva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
even of believers, <hi>Act.</hi> 14. 22. so strong, so
numerous and so terrible are their spiritual adver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>saries,
<hi>Eph.</hi> 6. 12. so little is there of strength in
themselves to oppose the meanest of them, 2 <hi>Cor.
3.</hi> 5. and so improbable is it by reason of all
those, that ever such as they shall be saved, That
they must look above themselves and draw the
<pb n="226" facs="tcp:61385:118"/>
ground of their hope for salvation from God and
from Christ, otherwise there can be no sure
foundation for their hope to rest on; for, the
Apostle here, while he intends to give grounds for
their hope of salvation, mentioned <hi>v.—8.</hi>
doth mention only Gods decree and the mediators
purchase: <hi>for God hath appointed us—to
obtain salvation by Jesus Christ.</hi> 4. As God
hath not slightly proposed, but peremptorily de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>creed,
fore-ordained and appointed from all eter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity
<hi>(Eph. 1. 4.)</hi> the salvation of the elect, and
condescended in that his eternal decree upon the
very particular persons whom he intended to save,
<hi>Phil. 4—3.</hi> So there are others whom he in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tended
not to save, but to condemn and adjudge
to undergo his everlasting wrath: See this latter
decree further cleared upon <hi>Eph. 1. 4. doct.</hi> 4.
for he saith, <hi>God hath appointed them to salvation,
and not to wrath,</hi> implying, that he had appoint<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
others to wrath, though not them. 5. Though
the decree of election to salvation be peremptory
and absolute, so as to exclude all possibility of its
not obtaining the end proposed, <hi>Matth.</hi> 24. 24.
yet not so as to exclude all means on Christs part
for obtaining, or on our part for attaining <hi>(Heb.
12. 14.)</hi> that salvation to which the elect are
ordained, seeing he hath in that same decree ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pointed
to bring about their salvation by such and
such means, 2 <hi>Thes. 2. 13. for God hath appointed
us to obtain salvation,</hi> saith he, not without means,
but <hi>by Jesus Christ.</hi> 6. Though the merits of
Christ were not a cause moving God to love or
elect any to salvation, for his electing love did
<pb n="227" facs="tcp:61385:118"/>
move him to give Christ for sinners, <hi>Joh.</hi> 3. 16.
yet they are the procuring meritorious cause for
the worth whereof salvation is actually bestowed
upon any, They are the cause, though not of the
decree, yet, of bestowing the salvation decreed:
for, the Apostle affirms the obtaining or purcha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sing
of salvation was <hi>by our Lord Jesus Christ.</hi>
7. As salvation could not be actually bestowed
upon the elect before it was purchased, and an
equivalent price payed to divine justice in satisfa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction
for those sins by which they had lost and
fore-faulted it, <hi>Heb.</hi> 9. 15. So neither they them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves,
nor any meer creature, was able to make
this purchase or lay down the price: The re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demption
of the soul is precious and ceaseth for
ever, to wit, among meer creatures, <hi>Psal.</hi> 49. 8.
It was Christ alone, the second person in the bles<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed
Trinity, who made this purchase of lost sal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vation,
and was designed in the same decree of
election for that end. Hence <hi>Eph.</hi> 1. 4. God is
said to have chosen us in Christ, which is more
plainly expressed here, <hi>He hath appointed us to
obtain,</hi> or to the obtaining or purchasing of sal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vation,
<hi>by Jesus Christ,</hi> implying, that the salva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
for which the elect were appointed, behoved
to be purchased, and the purchase of it by the
same appointment was put over upon him, there
being no other able for it.</p>
               <pb n="228" facs="tcp:61385:119"/>
               <q>Ver. 10. Who died for us, that whether we wake or
sleep, we should live together with him.</q>
               <p>He illustrates the last ground of hope by shew<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing,
first, the means by which Christ did pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chase
salvation to the elect, and what this purchase
stood him, to wit, no less than his blessed life: <hi>he
died,</hi> and that <hi>for us,</hi> that is, in our stead, <hi>Gal.
3.</hi> 13. and next, the end proposed by him in his
death, and which is undoubtedly obtained thereby,
to wit, <hi>
                     <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>hat we,</hi> or all the elect, of whom <hi>v. 9.
should live</hi> the spiritual life of grace here, and
eternal life of glory hereafter, and this whether
they <hi>wake or sleep:</hi> which words may not be ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken
as <hi>v.</hi> 6. for they who sleep securely in sin, do
not live with Christ, but either properly for bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dily
sleeping, or watching, or rather improperly,
for our living, and dying this natural life or death,
as 1 <hi>Thes.</hi> 4. 13. So the sense is, That no change
which can befall the believer in this life, no nor
death it self, shall hinder him to live this life, and
to <hi>live together with him,</hi> that is, by vertue of his
union with Christ and of that influence for life
which floweth from his blessed face and presence.
<hi>Doct.</hi> 1. The salvation of the eiect, through rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son
of their sin, was so deeply mortgaged, and
they so far from any ground of claim unto it, that
no less ransom was necessary to purchase salvati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
for them, than the death and sufferings of Je<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sus
Christ; for, <hi>Paul</hi> condescending on the way
how Christ did purchase salvation for the elect,
saith, <hi>he died for us, that we should live.</hi> 2. The
<pb n="229" facs="tcp:61385:119"/>
great end and cause of Christs death was, that, having
thereby payed a sufficient ransom to provoked ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stice
for the guilty elect, he might purchase for
them that life and salvation which was formerly
fore-faulted and lost; and therefore, though by
his sufferings and death he did confirm the truth of
the Gospel, and leave us an example of patience
to follow his steps, 1 <hi>Pet.</hi> 2. 21. yet those were
not the principal, much less the only, but the se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>condary
ends of his death: for, <hi>Paul</hi> sheweth that
he died for this end mainly to obtain and purchase
salvation, <hi>and that they should live together with
him.</hi> 3. Then do we rightly apply the fruit of
Christs death as to the purchase of salvation unto
our selves, when we joyntly therewith draw an
argument from it to resist sin which stood our Lord
so dear, and to lead an holy life, in exercising so<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>briety,
watchfulness and all other saving graces,
as that which he so aimed at in his death: for,
this of Christs dying for them may be looked upon
as a further incitement to the exercise of all the
forementioned vertues, <hi>who died for us,</hi> saith he.
4. The salvation purchased by Christ for the elect
is nothing other but a reviving of them from their
spiritual death, <hi>Eph.</hi> 2. 1. to that new and spiri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tual
life which is begun here in regeneration,
<hi>Joh.</hi> 3. 3. carryed on in the exercise of grace,
<hi>Gal.</hi> 2. 21. and shall be afterwards compleated in
glory, <hi>Col.</hi> 3. 4. so that saving grace is begun sal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vation,
and grace is no less purchased by Christ
than glory it self: for, in stead of saying he died
that he might purchase salvation, according to his
present scope, as appears from <hi>v.</hi> 9. he saith, as the
<pb n="230" facs="tcp:61385:120"/>
equivalent of it, <hi>he died that we should live together
with him.</hi> 5. This life of grace, begun here and
perfected in glory, is the most excellent of any other
life, It carryeth the name of life from any other
besides, which being compared with it, are nothing
but a death: for, therefore doth he give it the name
of life here absolutely, and without any addition,
to shew what kind of life he meaneth, as if there
were no other life but it only: <hi>who dyed,</hi> saith he,
<hi>that we should live with him.</hi> 6. Though this
life of grace doth not exempt the elect from natu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral
death; yet so excellent is it that it maketh the
man who hath it out-live death. Death it self,
the King of terrours, shall not bereave him of it:
for, he supp<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="2 letters">

death, here expressed by the name of <hi>sleep,</hi>
and yet that they shall not be bereaved of this ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cellent
life, <hi>that whether we wake or sleep, we
should live,</hi> saith he. 7. It is the presence of
Christ, and o<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

makes us live this blessed and excellent life. It is
as the soul to the body, the very life of our life,
and that whereby we formally live. So that
though Christ by his d<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>ath did purchase this life,
yet the elect do not actually enjoy it until they be

the necessity whereof in its subserviency to
the former duties is pointed at in the illative par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticle
<hi>wherefore;</hi> and the summ of it is, that they
would, first, not only <hi>comfort themselves together,</hi>
as Gods dealing with any did call for comfort, but
also mutually exhort and incite one another to the
exercise, as of all other vertues, so especially, of
those presently mentioned: for the word rendred
<hi>comfort,</hi> signifieth also to <hi>exhort.</hi> And next, <hi>edifie
one another,</hi> or (as skilful and diligent Masons,
from whom the word is borrowed) endeavour to
advance the work of grace in others, not only by
exhortation and consolation but by all other law<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful
means of admonition, instruction, rebuke, re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proof,
or good example: And that he may excite
them to further progress in the practice of those
duties and not seem by his present exhortation to tax
them of former negligence, he doth commend
their present diligence in them. <hi>Doct.</hi> 1. As all
Christians of all ranks do stand in need of exhor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation,
consolation and to be edified and further<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
in the way of grace by all lawful means; So
both P<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

of discharging all those duties; to wit, Pastors,
not only privately, but also publickly in the Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gregation,
1 <hi>Tim.</hi> 5. 20. and by vertue of their
particular calling, office and authority so to do;
<hi>Tit. <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

their families, <hi>Eph.</hi> 6. 4. among their friends and
neighbours, <hi>Act.</hi> 18. 26. and by vertue of a tye
of Christian charity towards all the members of
the same body, 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 12. 25. For, he sheweth
that every one stands in need to be exhorted,
comforted, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> and that it is the duty of all to do
so, while he saith, <hi>comfort,</hi> or <hi>exhort and edifie
one another.</hi> 2. As the conscience-making of the
forementioned duties among Christians is a singu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lar
mean to keep people in a lively watchful frame
and temper of spirit; So negligence in them doth
of necessity bring along with it great deadness,
security and decay of life and vigour in the exer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cise
of any saving grace, and performance of com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manded
duties: for, the illative particle <hi>therefore,</hi>
sheweth that this duty is enjoyned as a subservi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ent
help to the exercise of sobriety, watchfulness,
faith, love and hope, formerly pressed; <hi>wherefore
comfort your selves together,</hi> saith he. 3. So ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny
are the discouragements which people must en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>counter
in the way of duty, what from their small
progress in it, the averseness of their own spirit
from it, <hi>Rom.</hi> 7. 18. the great opposition from out<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward
and inward tentations to it, 1 <hi>Joh.</hi> 2. 16.
that they often need as much of consolation and
encouragement, as exhortation and admonition,
for making them advance in it; for, he bids them,
in order to this, <hi>comfort themselves together.</hi>
4. There is none so far advanced, or so diligent
in the exercise of any grace, but they need the spur
of exhortation, at least to make them persevere;
seeing the best are ready to faint, <hi>Jonah 2. 7.
Gal.</hi> 6. 9. if not also to make them do better,
<pb n="233" facs="tcp:61385:121"/>
seeing the best come far short of what they ought,
<hi>Phil. 3—13.</hi> For, he exhorts them to the
present duty, though he doth commend their pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sent
diligence in it: <hi>edifie one another,</hi> saith he, <hi>as
also ye do.</hi> 5. A prudent Minister should so ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cite
the Lords people unto their duties, as not to
neglect their good beginning or progress already
made, but let them know he taketh notice of them
as such, which may prove a forcible encourage<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
to some to quicken their pace, and a sove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>raign
remedy against discouragement in others,
than which nothing doth prove a greater enemy
to diligence in duty: for so doth <hi>Paul</hi> here, <hi>edifie
one another as also ye do,</hi> saith he.</p>
               <q>Ver. 12. And we beseech you, brethren, to know
them which labour among you, and are over you
in the Lord, and admonish you.</q>
               <p>Lest by binding the duty of mutual edification
upon all Christians, <hi>v.</hi> 11. he had seemed to make
a publick Ministry useless, therefore he doth loving<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
and affectionately (as the compellation <hi>bre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thren</hi>
and the word rendred <hi>beseech</hi> imply) press
a fourth branch of sanctification containing a short
summ of peoples duty towards their Ministers and
Church guides who are here described to be, first,
<hi>those who laboured</hi> among them even to weariness
(as the word signifieth) which seemeth to relate
chiefly unto Ministers or Preaching Presbyters,
the specialty of whose office is to labour in the word
and doctrine, 1 <hi>Tim. 5—17.</hi> next, they were <hi>over
them,</hi> the word signifies to excel and bear rule,
<pb n="234" facs="tcp:61385:122"/>
1 <hi>Tim.</hi> 3. 4, 12. and thus it expresseth that part
of their office, whether they be preaching or ruling
Presbyters, which consists in ruling and governing
the flock, 1 <hi>Tim.</hi> 5. 17.—only he addeth <hi>in
the Lord,</hi> to distinguish Church Government from
the Civil. It is spiritual, in things relating imme<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diately
to God, and to be exercised not in their own
name, but in the name and authority of the Lord
Christ, <hi>Matth.</hi> 18. 20. They are over the flock,
not as Lords, 1 <hi>Pet.</hi> 5. 3. but as stewards, 1 <hi>Cor.
4.</hi> 1. 3. They did <hi>admonish them,</hi> whereby he ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>presseth
one main thing wherein they were to la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bour,
and to exercise their authority and rule, to
wit, their endeavouring by all competent means,
and particularly, both by doctrine and more gentle
censures, to put a right impression of duty upon the
minds of the Lords people. The word in the
Original signifieth to put a right mind in one.
Next, he presseth the duties of people towards
their Ministers, which are first <hi>to acknowledge
them,</hi> as the word may be rendred here, for, the
naked knowledge of their persons and gifts may
be in such as otherwayes contemn them, but the
knowledge of them, here required, is an acknow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledging
them for such as they are by reason of
their calling, and ought to be accounted. See
1 <hi>Cor. 16—18. Doct.</hi> 1. So great an enemy
is Satan to the Ordinance of a publick Ministry,
1 <hi>Thes.</hi> 2. 18. so necessary is it that people
do countenance that ordinance, and encourage
those who are entrusted with it even for their
own good, <hi>Heb.</hi> 13. 17. so ignorant, unmindful
and neglective are they of those duties which they
<pb n="235" facs="tcp:61385:122"/>
ought to perform for that end, 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 12. 11. that
the servants of Christ should, with much serious<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness
and affectionate insinuation, press upon the
Lords people all such duties of respect, reverence,
love, obedience, submission, <hi>Heb.</hi> 13. 17. and gra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>titude,
<hi>Gal.</hi> 6. 6. as they owe unto their Ministers
and those who are over them in the Lord; So far
should they be from a total neglect of pressing
any such duties under a pretence of self-denyal,
or from preposterous modesty: for, <hi>Paul</hi> doth
here most seriously and affectionately press duties
of that kind, <hi>And we beseech you, brethren, to
know,</hi> &amp;c. 2. The duties of private edification
should be so gone about and entertained by pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vate
Christians, as the office of a publick Mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stry
be not hereby rendred useless and despicable,
or the proper duties thereof incroached upon, by
those who are not called to that function, <hi>Heb.</hi> 5. 4.
for, therefore he subjoynes this precept, which
presseth upon people respect to the publick Mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stry,
to that other about mutual edification, im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mediately
preceding, <hi>And we beseech you, brethren,
to know,</hi> &amp;c. 3. The duties which people dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>charge
to their Ministers should flow from their
knowledge and inward conviction, that the place
and station wherein their Ministers are set doth
call for such duties at their hands, and not from
meer custome, force of civil laws, regard to their
own credit, or for gaining of their Ministers fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vour,
or any thing of that kind; otherwise, nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
will their duty be pleasantly done, nor ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceptable
to God when it is done: for, therefore
doth he enjoyn it as the first piece of peoples duty to
<pb n="234" facs="tcp:61385:123"/>
                  <gap reason="duplicate" extent="1 page">
                     <desc>〈1 page duplicate〉</desc>

                  <pb n="236" facs="tcp:61385:124"/>
their Ministers, and the foundation of all the rest,
to know and acknowledge them for such to
whom they ought in conscience discharge those
duties, <hi>And we beseech you, brethren, to know
them which labour among you.</hi> 4. One great
and main cause of peoples backwardness to do
duty unto their Ministers, and of disrespect both
to their persons and function, is, their ignorance
and not serious perpending the weight and wea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>risome
toyle of their labour, the dignity of their
office, together with the usefulness and necessity
of their work among them; for, therefore doth
<hi>Paul</hi> describe the Ministry from the dignity of
their office, the toilsomness of their labour, and
the usefulness of their work to the people, as so
many motives unto people to discharge that duty
which they owe them. <hi>Which labour among
you, and are over you and admonish you,</hi> and
v. 13. <hi>for their works sake.</hi> 5. The wisdom of
God hath so contrived Scripture, that frequently
in one word and sentence it doth comprize a va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riety
of distinct purposes; for here, with one
breath he teacheth both people their duty, and Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nisters
their duty, and maketh the latter an argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
to inforce the former. <hi>Know them,</hi> saith
he, <hi>which labour among you, and are over you,</hi>
&amp;c. 6. The Lord Christ hath appointed the Or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinance
of Church-government in his house di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stinct
from, and in things proper to it, indepen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent
upon the Civil Magistrate, to be managed by
Church-guides, Ministers and Elders in their Ec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clesiastick
Courts and Judicatories, 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 5. 4.
for, the word rendred <hi>over you,</hi> doth properly
<pb n="237" facs="tcp:61385:124"/>
and usually signifie a power of Jurisdiction and Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernment,
and the expression <hi>in the Lord</hi> doth di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stinguish
this Government from the Civil; <hi>and are
over you in the Lord,</hi> saith he. 7. The power of
Church-government and the exercise of it is not, by
any appointment of Christs, ast<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>icted to any one
Minister or person whomsoever, having power of
authority and Jurisdiction above the rest, neither
doth it belong to the body and community of
Church-members, but to all the Ministers and
Church-guides in common; for, he speaketh here
of them all, and only of them, <hi>they are over you in
the Lord.</hi> 8. The Lords Ministers ought so to go
about one part of their Ministerial function as not
to neglect another. They must so Preach, as not
to neglect the exercise of discipline, and so exercise
discipline as not to neglect to labour in the word
and doctrine; for, saith he, <hi>they labour among
you, and are over you in the Lord.</hi> 9. So necessa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry
and useful is the exercise of discipline by Church-guides
to the Church of Christ, for keeping the
ordinances pure, <hi>Rev.</hi> 2. 2. and the Lords people
free from the infection of contagious sins, 1 <hi>Cor.
5.</hi> 6. for reclaiming and gaining of scandalous of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fenders
to repentance, 1 <hi>Tim.</hi> 1. 20. and for or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dering
all the affairs of Christs house, 1 <hi>Cor.
14.</hi> 48. (none of which ends can be attained so
well and effectually as by the mean appointed there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to
by Christ himself) that the Lords people
should be so far from reluctancy to lay their necks
under this piece of Christs easie yo<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>k, that they
ought to acknowledge, respect, love and discharge
all other duties unto their Ministers and Church-guides
<pb n="238" facs="tcp:61385:125"/>
upon this very account of their exercising
discipline, as well as of their labouring in the word
and doctrine; for, to incite people to their duty to
Ministers, he describes them not only from this
that <hi>they laboured among them,</hi> but also <hi>were over
them in the Lord.</hi> 10. Whatever other thing is
requisite in a Minister, yet this one thing is neces<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sary
and may not be wanting, some measure of skill
and dexterity to admonish the Lords people of their
duty, by clearing up to their minds the equity of it,
and producing some pertinent motives for bringing
them to a good liking with it: for, his expressing
only this one particular piece of their work doth im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ply
that it is a chief one, and that some competency
of abilities for it must not be wanting: <hi>and admo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nish
you,</hi> saith he.</p>
               <q>Ver. 13. And to esteem them very highly in love
for their works sake, and be at peace among
your selves.</q>
               <p>The Apostle in this verse doth, first, press a se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cond
head of duty flowing from the former which
people owe to their Ministers, to wit, that they
should <hi>esteem them very highly</hi> or superaboundant<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
(as the word doth signifie) whereby he points
at that inward reverence and respect to their per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sons
and office due to them, to be testified in their
speech, <hi>Matth.</hi> 12. 34. and other behaviour, <hi>P<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>il.
2.</hi> 29. which he shews should be accompanied with
love to them, a love, without doubt, which ought
to kyth in its effects, <hi>Gal.</hi> 4. 15. Secondly, he gives a
reason or motive unto all the fore-mentioned duties,
<pb n="239" facs="tcp:61385:125"/>
to wit, <hi>for the work</hi> of their Pastoral function, that
Ministers might be encouraged in it, <hi>Heb.</hi> 13. 17.
and because it is an excellent work in it self, 1 <hi>Tim.
3.</hi> 1. and most necessary and advantageous to the
Lords people, 1 <hi>Tim.</hi> 4. 16. Thirdly, he presseth
another branch of sanctification relating unto all,
to wit, the study of keeping Christian peace and
concord <hi>among themselves,</hi> and especially with
their Ministers; lest by any means Satan might
stir up strife and prejudice among them, to make
the labours of their Ministers unprofitable.
<hi>Doct.</hi> 1. The great thing which Ministers should
press in relation to themselves upon people, and
which people should endeavour toward their Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nisters,
is to have their hearts possessed with an
affectionate and good esteem of their persons and
office, as that which will bring with it the hearty
and willing performance of all other duties which
they owe unto them; for, he thinks it sufficient to
press this esteem flowing from love, as knowing,
that this being attained, all the rest would follow.
<hi>And to esteem them very highly in love.</hi> 2. This
high esteem which is due from people unto their
Minister, as it must flow from love to his person
for his works sake; So it must manifest it self in
kindness and beneficence, in a seemly behaviour
toward him in hoping the best of him, in bearing
with his humane frailties, in not publishing of
them, in not receiving misreports or taking up
groundless jealousies against him, and in such
other fruits of love and charity as are mentioned,
1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 13. 4, 5, 6, 7. For, he saith, <hi>esteem them
very highly in love.</hi> 3. As it is not sufficient we
<pb n="240" facs="tcp:61385:126"/>
do what is right and commanded, except it flow
from right and allowed motives; So whatever a
Minister be otherwise, for birth, for personage, for
riches, for other natural endowments, it ought to be
a sufficient motive and inducement to gain him
esteem and respect, that the Lord hath employed
him in such a worthy excellent work, as the pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>claiming
of peace to rebels in Christs stead, 2 <hi>Cor.
5.</hi> 20. the espousing of a bride to him, 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 11. 2.
and the gaining of souls to God, 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 9. 22. and
whatever esteem is given him from any other mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tive,
whether the dignity of his place, eminency of
his parts, the affableness of his disposition, or his
easiness to receive satisfaction in the matter of his
maintenance, if it be not also and mainly upon the
account of his work, that esteem is not given which
is due to a Minister of the Gospel: for, he will
have them to <hi>esteem them for their works sake.</hi>
4. As Christian peace and concord among societies
is a nursing mother unto all other duties, 1 <hi>Tim.</hi> 2. 2.
so it tendeth, in a special manner, to make the work
of the Ministry successful among a people, while
Ministers have thereby not only access, but delight
to be doing good among the people, and people also
to edifie one another; and nothing marreth the
good of a Ministry more, than a Spirit of discord,
dissention and strife let loose, either betwixt Pastor
and people, or betwixt people and people among
themselves: for, therefore, it seemeth, immediately
after he hath spoken of the duties both of Pastor
and people, he subjoyneth, <hi>And be at peace among
your selves.</hi>
               </p>
               <pb n="241" facs="tcp:61385:126"/>
               <q>Ver. 14. Now we exhort you, brethren, warn
them that are unruly, comfort the feeble-minded,
support the weak, be patient toward all men.</q>
               <p>He doth here press four duties which are so ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny
further branches of sanctification, and all of
them belong both to people and Ministers, to each
in their own way. See in <hi>doct.</hi> 1. The first three
are astricted to three sorts of persons for their
object, as first the <hi>unruly,</hi> that is, who as disorder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
souldiers (from which the word in the original
is borrowed) do transgress the order, bounds and
limits of their particular calling and station assign<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
them by God, and especially such as neglect their
own business, and intrude themselves upon the af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fairs
of others, as the Apostle explains himself,
2 <hi>Thes.</hi> 3. 11. and those are to be <hi>admonished,</hi> that
is, minded of their duty, yea and sharply rebuked
for the neglect of it, for that the admonition
here required doth include so much is clear from
2 <hi>Thes. 2. 10, &amp;c.</hi> A second sort are the <hi>feeble-minded,</hi>
that is, as appears from the remedy pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>scribed,
those who are so much dejected in mind
with the sense of sin, or with the feeling or fear
of afflictions that they are ready to faint in the
way of their duty, <hi>Prov.</hi> 24. 10. and such are to
<hi>be comforted,</hi> or animated against their discourage<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments
from <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>uch grounds as the word of truth doth
afford. A third sort are the <hi>weak</hi> or infirm, and
this either in their Judgement through want of ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pacity,
or information, <hi>Rom.</hi> 15. 1. or in practice,
who being otherwise tender in their walk are carry<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
<pb n="242" facs="tcp:61385:127"/>
aside in some one particular or other by a more
than ordinary violence of some tentation, <hi>Matth.
26.</hi> 69. And those are to be <hi>supported,</hi> The word
signifieth to underprop them, as a beam doth the
house, to wit, by bearing, though not with their sins,
<hi>Gal.</hi> 2. 11. yet with their persons, <hi>Eph.</hi> 4. 2. by ten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der
yielding to them in the practice of things indiffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rent,
1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 9. 20. by wise commending what appear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance
of good is in them, <hi>Mat.</hi> 12. 20. and by clearing
of their mistakes with calmness and diligence, <hi>Act.
18.</hi> 25, 26. The <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>ourth duty is not astricted unto any
one sort, but extended <hi>unto all</hi> indifferently who
are diseased either in body or mind, and especially
such as are troubled with any spiritual malady; to
wit, the exercise of <hi>patience;</hi> whereby it seemeth
according to the present scope, he enjoyneth con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinuance
in the forementioned duties, and others of
the like nature, without wearying much less hope<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>less
surceasing, 2 <hi>Tim.</hi> 2. 25. notwithstanding
that success for a time be wanting. <hi>Doct.</hi> 1. The
visible Church of Christ, is constitute not of An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gels
or Saints made perfect, but men of sinful infir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mities,
and those of several sorts in several per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sons:
and therefore the Church may be well com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pared
to an Hospital full of sickly persons, labour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
under a great variety of spiritual diseases,
some under one sort, some under another, and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sequently
all of them fit objects upon which Jesus
Christ, the great Physitian of souls, may exercise
some one or other of his spiritual cures; for, <hi>Paul</hi>
representeth this Church as such, wherein some
were <hi>unruly,</hi> some <hi>feeble-minded,</hi> and a third sort
<hi>weak.</hi> 2. The Lords Ministers and people may
<pb n="243" facs="tcp:61385:127"/>
not on this prentence rent and separate from the
society and fellowship of visible Churches, but are
to employ their skill and experience in things spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritual,
under Christ the great Physitian, every one
in his own place and station, in administrating
some suitable cure and remedy to the diseased mem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bers
of Christs visible body, as they may have
access and opportunity: <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>or, so doth <hi>Paul</hi> here
enjoyn them, not to separate from, but to <hi>warn the
unruly,</hi> &amp;c. 3. As there is a great variety of spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritual
distempers incident to several diseased pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tients,
and the disease of one is not the disease of
all, but almost every patient doth labour under his
own distemper, which is, at least in some circum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stances,
different from the disease of others; So
it concerneth those who would prove successful
Physi<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>ians in curing the spiritual distempers of di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>seased
Christians, to be well acquainted with the
temper of their Patient and the nature of his disease,
that they may the better know how to administer a
suitable cure; for, he shews that there are some
more <hi>unruly,</hi> some <hi>feeble-minded,</hi> some <hi>weak,</hi> and
implyeth that those who were to administer the
prescribed cures should know the disease before
they meddle with the cure: <hi>warn the unruly,</hi> &amp;c.
4. As Christ the great Physitian hath provided a
great variety of spiritual cures and remedies, an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>swerable
to the several distinct infirmities of his
diseased people; So every cure is not fitted or to
be applyed by Christs servants unto all diseases,
otherwise they prove Physitians of no value, and
by a wrong application do make the malady worse:
But every disease must have its own proper cure;
<pb n="244" facs="tcp:61385:128"/>
for, he enjoyns them to <hi>warn the unruly, to com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fort
the feeble-minded, to support the weak.</hi>
5. Though every spiritual patient almost, as said
is, hath his own distinct distemper; yet there is
one which is common almost unto all, to wit, a
great unwillingness to admit of a suitable cure, and
no small difficulty to be wrought upon by it:
and this doth call for one common remedy unto all,
to wit patience, and indesatigable diligence in Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stians
who are called to be Physitians one unto ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther:
<hi>be patient towards all men,</hi> saith he.</p>
               <q>Ver. 15. See that none render evil for evil unto
any man: but ever follow that which is good,
both among your selves, and to all men.</q>
               <p>The Apostle presseth, in this verse, another
branch of sanctification: and because of our pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>penseness
to the sin forbidden, he premits the
word, <hi>see,</hi> or take heed, and beware. The duty
injoyned belongeth unto all without exception, to
wit, that first, they would abstain from recompen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sing
<hi>evil for evil,</hi> or wrong for wrong <hi>unto any,</hi>
he meaneth private revenge; for the publick exe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cution
of justice by the Magistrate in punishing
those who do evil, is not here forbidden, <hi>Rom.</hi> 13. 4.
And next that <hi>they follow,</hi> or, (as the word im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plyeth,
with a sort of eagerness, as the hunter doth
the prey) pursue that which is good, where, by
<hi>good,</hi> must be meant the exercise of pitty and the
good of beneficence towards, even their enemies,
as being here opposed to the act of private revenge,
see <hi>Gal.</hi> 6. 10. and this he will have to be pursued
<pb n="245" facs="tcp:61385:128"/>
                  <hi>ever,</hi> that is, constantly without any interruption
by multiplication or heightning of <hi>injuries,</hi> and
both among <hi>themselves,</hi> who were Christians, and
<hi>to all men</hi> even to the Heathens among whom they
lived. <hi>Doct.</hi> 1. The duty of abstaining from pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vate
revenge, and of recompensing good to those
who wrong us, is a duty from which, of any other,
our corrupt nature is most averse, as being most
contrary to those wo<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>ul principles of pride, self-love,
impatience, and malice, which are imprinted
upon the hearts of all by nature: and therefore a
lesson which neither ancient Philosophers, yea nor
Scribes or Pharisees, <hi>Matth.</hi> 5. 43, &amp;c. but only
Christ himself hath taught: for our natural averse<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness
to this duty is implyed in the word <hi>see,</hi> take
heed, or beware, which is prefixed to it: <hi>See that
none render evil for evil.</hi> But, 2. It is a duty
which the Lord Christ hath most strictly injoyned,
not by way of counsel only, (as the Papists af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firm
of this and other duties, to wit, that they are
so commanded as that they may be omitted without
sin, or hazard of punishment) but by way of most
peremptory precept binding all, and that under
the hazard of Divine displeasure, <hi>Prov.</hi> 24. 17, 18.
for, he injoyns it here with a peremptory <hi>see,</hi> and
will have all obliged to it: <hi>See that none render
evil for evil.</hi> 3. A Christian mans care to resist
sin should be exercised about those sins most, to
which he finds himself by nature most inclined, as
those to the committing whereof, Satan, who
knoweth our natural propension well, will set him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>self
to tempt us most, <hi>Joh.</hi> 12. 6. with <hi>Matth.
14.</hi> 11. for, therefore doth he injoyn them to
<pb n="246" facs="tcp:61385:129"/>
watch against, and in a special manner resist, this
sin of private revenge: <hi>See that none render evil
for evil.</hi> 4. This duty of abstaining from private
revenge is incumbent unto all toward all, so that the
gallantry, greatness, or power of none doth give
him exemption and liberty to usurp upon Gods
place, by avenging himself for real or apprehend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
injuries and affronts, upon any, even though he
were but his equal or underling, the Lord having
in this case provided his ordinance of publick Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gistracy,
for repairing of wrongs, <hi>Rom.</hi> 13. 4. and
having injoyned unto all the exercise of faith and
patience under those injuries whereof they can
have no redress by that mean, <hi>Psal.</hi> 37. 7. for, he
saith, <hi>see that none render evil for evil unto any.</hi>
5. So devilish are some men, that having done
the injury themselves they cannot hear of recon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciliation
with, or readmission unto the favour of
him whom they have injured, though he not only
make an offer of it unto them, but also press them
and follow on upon them with the offer: and yet
even in this case, the patient man must not turn
vindictive and impatient, but should lengthen his
patience and strengthen his resistance against all
tentations and motions to private revenge, so long
as the malicious temper of his adversary remain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth,
though it were for ever; for, he bids them
<hi>ever follow</hi> and pursue <hi>that which is good.</hi> The word
signifieth to pursue a thing that flyeth away from
us. 6. Though there be some degrees and duties
of love which ought to be astricted to some persons
more than to others, 1 <hi>Tim.</hi> 5. 8. yet there are
others due unto all, even to our enemies, as mainly
<pb n="247" facs="tcp:61385:129"/>
this act of love specified in the text, the requital
of good for evil, there being somewhat in all men,
even in the worst of men, to draw forth the exer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cise
of our love and affection in some of its acts
and effects towards him; as that he hath some re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mainder
of Gods image in him, <hi>Rom.</hi> 1. 20. is of
the same flesh, <hi>Isa. 58—7.</hi> and blood with our
selves, <hi>Act.</hi> 17. 26. possibly endued with some
special gifts of valour, love to his country, 2 <hi>Sam.
10.</hi> 12. which ought to be loved and cherished by
us; for, he bids <hi>follow good both among your selves
and to all men.</hi>
               </p>
               <q>Ver. 16. Rejoice evermore.
17. Pray without ceasing.
18. In every thing give thanks: for this is the
will of God in Christ Jesus concerning you.</q>
               <p>Three further branches or duties of sanctifica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
are pressed in these three verses. As first that
they would <hi>rejoice,</hi> that is, labour not only to keep
their hearts free from anxiety and discouragement
arising from their manifold causes of sorrow and
grief, but also, with some measure of spiritual de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>light,
to follow upon and be taken up with the
sense and sweetness which floweth either from the
consideration of the excellency of Christ himself,
<hi>Cant. 5. 10, &amp;c.</hi> and of his usefulness unto them,
<hi>Psal.</hi> 118. 1. together with their interest in him,
<hi>Cant.</hi> 2. 16. or from the observation of his care
and providence toward them, 1 <hi>Sam.</hi> 17. 32. from
the testimony of a good conscience, 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 1. 12.
and from things worldly in so far only as they are
<pb n="248" facs="tcp:61385:130"/>
pledges of Gods favour, and furtherances of a
better life, <hi>Levit.</hi> 23. 40. This is the duty of re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>joycing
here pressed which he willeth to be gone
about <hi>evermore</hi> under all cases, and at all times:
Not as if the case of the Lords people did not some<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times
call them to mourning, <hi>Eccles.</hi> 3. 4. but that
even their sorrow and mourning for things grievous
should be so much conform to that the Lord
calleth for in such cases as it do not mar, but ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
further, their rejoycing in the Lord, and in
the testimony of a good conscience, 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 6. 10.
This is contained <hi>v.</hi> 16. Secondly, because they
did stand in continual need of Gods help, either for
attaining of good things necessary and wanting,
<hi>Matth. 6. 11. Phil.</hi> 3. 13. or for removing of
things evil and present, <hi>Job 14. 1. 1 Joh.</hi> 1. 8, 10.
therefore he excites them to the exercise of <hi>prayer</hi>
joyned with attention and fervent seriousness of
mind, as having vows and undertaking joyned
with it (for so much doth the word in the original
imply) and this <hi>without ceasing,</hi> (not as if they
were to do nothing else, 2 <hi>Thes.</hi> 3. 10. but they
were not to cease upon their not obtaining a pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sent
grant, <hi>Luke</hi> 18. 1, &amp;c. they were to be fre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quent
in prayer, <hi>Psal.</hi> 57. 17. and alwayes when
they had opportunity, to lift up their hearts either
in set and solemn prayer or heavenly ejaculations,
which latter may be practised without interruption
of our other lawful employments, <hi>Neh.</hi> 2. 4.
This is <hi>v.</hi> 17. Thirdly, he exhorts them to the
duty of <hi>giving thanks,</hi> to wit, unto God, <hi>Eph.
5.</hi> 20. which consists in a sensible acknowledge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
of favours received from him, 2 <hi>Sam. 7. 18<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
                  </hi> 19.
<pb n="249" facs="tcp:61385:130"/>
and in expressing our sense of them, either by
words, <hi>Psal.</hi> 104. 1. or works, <hi>(1 Cor. 10. 31.)</hi>
to his praise: and this he will have discharged <hi>in
every thing,</hi> that is, in all estates, <hi>Jam.</hi> 1. 9, 10.
and for his overruling every thing which befalls
us with much mercy and moderation, <hi>Ezra</hi> 9. 13.
and for our good, <hi>Rom.</hi> 8. 28. all which duties and
especially this of thanksgiving he urges from the
authority of God injoyning them unto all men,
<hi>Rom.</hi> 1. 21. but more especially unto Christians
and real believers. The reason whereof is hinted
at in this, that not only his will enjoyning is made
known, <hi>Psal.</hi> 147. 19. but also constant matter and
furniture for obeying his will in all those things is
conveyed unto them <hi>in</hi> and by <hi>Jesus Christ, Phil.
4.</hi> 13. whatever be their case otherwayes, <hi>Act.
5.</hi> 41. This is <hi>v. 18. Doct.</hi> 1. The duty of re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>joycing
in the Lord (as it is set forth in the expo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sition)
and constancy in it, is a soveraign antidote
against impatience and a spirit of revenge for in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>juries
received, in so far as it sweetneth every dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pensation,
and doth elevate the heart of him, who
is exercised with it above all things earthly, whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
prosperous or adverse; so as he will not wil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lingly,

<hi>Psal.</hi> 77. 3. Yet there are alwayes grounds for
rejoycing unto such; though not to their sense,
yet to their faith, <hi>Psal.</hi> 60. 6. though not in them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves,
yet in the Lord, <hi>Phil.</hi> 4. 4. and in what he
hath already done, <hi>Psal.</hi> 71. 10, 11. or at least
hath promised to do unto them, <hi>Phil.</hi> 1. 6. For,
this precept to <hi>rejoyce evermore,</hi> implyeth that
there will be ever grounds of rejoycing. 3. The
joy of Gods people which is allowed upon them
by the Lord is not light and carnal, casting them
loose and idle in the practice of commanded du<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties,
but spiritual and solid, carrying along with
it conscientious diligence and circumspectness in
duty, <hi>Psal.</hi> 2. 11. and especially in the duty of
prayer, as that without which this rejoycing frame
of heart can neither be attained, nor yet enter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tained
and kept; <hi>Job</hi> 27. 10. For, therefore doth
he, to the precept of <hi>rejoycing evermore,</hi> subjoyn
immediately this other, <hi>pray without ceasing,</hi>
4. Frequency in serious and attentive prayer is of
excellent use, as for other ends, <hi>Matth.</hi> 7. 7, 8.
so for this, to keep the heart alwayes in a rejoycing
frame and temper, in so far as there is not a more
ready way to be eased of our discouraging weights,
which keep our spirits at under, that they cannot
mount up in this heavenly duty of rejoycing, than
to cast the weight and trouble of all that grieves
us over upon God by prayer, <hi>Phil.</hi> 4. 5. For,
therefore doth he subjoyn, <hi>pray without ceasing.</hi>
                  <pb n="251" facs="tcp:61385:131"/>
5. Christians should be so ordered by prudence
that their intenseness upon, and diligence in one
duty do not make them neglective or careless of
any other: For, he will have them so to <hi>rejoyce
evermore</hi> as they also <hi>pray without ceasing,</hi> and
so to pray as that <hi>in every thing they give thanks.</hi>
6. That the duties of prayer and thanksgiving do
agree well together, See upon <hi>Eph. 1. v. 16.
doct. 1. pray without ceasing, in every thing give
thanks.</hi> 7. As there can be no such ample cause
of thanksgiving in this life, but there will be still
some constant need and reason for prayer, ther<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap> be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
alwayes somewhat wanting even when we en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>joy
most, 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 5. 6. So there can be no such ur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gent
and multiplyed necessities for exciting to pray<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er,
but upon narrow search there will be found
some causes for thanksgiving, if it were but this
that our case is not so evil but the Lord might
justly have made it worse, <hi>Ezra</hi> 9. 13. and that
we are kept from total succumbing or sinking un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der
it, <hi>Lam.</hi> 3. 21. For, while he enjoyneth both
to <hi>Pray without ceasing,</hi> and <hi>in every thing to give
thanks,</hi> it is implyed that there will be alwayes
reasons for both. 8. One excellent mean for en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gaging
our hearts in the conscientious practice of
the forementioned duties, of constant rejoycing,
assiduous prayer, and continued thanksgiving, is,
seriously to consider that our performance of them
is not a matter indifferent, or left unto us to do
or not do as a piece of our liberty, and as we
find our hearts in a temper for them, but most
strictly enjoyned us by the soveraign will of God the
Law-giver; so that our neglect of those doth make
<pb n="252" facs="tcp:61385:132"/>
us guilty, as the breach of any other of the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mands,
whether by not sanctifying the Sabbath, or
by taking his name in vain: for, he inferreth the
practice of them all from his will enjoyning, <hi>for
this is the will of God,</hi> saith he. 9. Precepts for
duty from God the Law-giver are then rightly
looked on by us, when considered as they are re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vealed
and enjoyned to us in Christ, who hath
made the insupportable burthen of precepts <hi>(Gal.
3. 10.)</hi> an easie yoak unto his followers, <hi>Matth.
11.</hi> 30. while he pardoneth their failings, <hi>Micah
7.</hi> 18. renews their strength, maketh them mount
up and not be weary, <hi>Isa.</hi> 40. 31. strengthneth
them to do whatever he enjoyneth, <hi>Phil.</hi> 4. 13. so
that his commandments are not grievous, 1 <hi>Joh.
5.</hi> 3. For, he propones Gods will unto them, to
be considered by them as it was revealed and en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>joyned
to them in Christ, <hi>This is the will of God,</hi>
saith he, <hi>in Christ Jesus concerning you.</hi>
               </p>
               <q>Ver. 19. Quench not the spirit.
20. Despise not prophesyings.</q>
               <p>He doth here press two other branches of san<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctification.
The first is set down in a Metaphor
taken from fire or gross material light, which is
properly said to be extinguished or quenched, and
that either by withholding combustible matter, or
by casting on the contrary element of water. And
the word is here applyed to the spirit of God, who
is as fire giving both the light of knowledge, <hi>Eph.
1.</hi> 17, 18. and heat of love and affection, <hi>Luke
24.</hi> 32. and by the <hi>spirit</hi> here is not so much to
<pb n="253" facs="tcp:61385:132"/>
be meant the spirit of God in his own person and
nature, as in his gifts and holy motions or incite<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments
to duty, which are quenched, weakned, lost
or abolished, in our selves or others, either by our
negligence in improving them, <hi>Matth.</hi> 25. 29.
and by our slight and formal use of means whereby
th<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>y are entertained, 2 <hi>Tim.</hi> 4. 3, 4. or by too
great diligence in doing evil, <hi>Isa.</hi> 29. 13, 14. and
especially by contemning or despising his gifts in
others which keeps them at under, 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 12. 21.
and by resisting his motions and incitements to
good in our selves, <hi>Jer.</hi> 6. 10. This is the sin
here forbidden, and by consequence the contrary
duty commanded, to wit, that the gifts and mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions
of the spirit of God, whether in our selves or
others, be carefully cherished, 2 <hi>Tim.</hi> 1. 14. and
continually stirred up by the use of prayer, hear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing,
and of all other means thereto appointed,
2 <hi>Tim,</hi> 1. 6. This is <hi>v.</hi> 19. The second branch
here pressed is subservient to the former, <hi>despise
not prophesie,</hi> where <hi>prophesie</hi> is not taken in a
strict sense for prediction or foretelling of things
to come, as <hi>Act.</hi> 21. 9. (for that was neither so
common in the Church, nor yet to continue) but
for the explication, and application of the word of
God, either by extraordinary or ordinary Mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sters,
even that which we call <hi>preaching,</hi> as <hi>Rom.
12. 6. 1 Cor.</hi> 14. 3. So the thing commanded is
that they would not <hi>despise,</hi> or set at nought, the
publick preaching of Gods word by sent Ministers,
but rather set an high price upon it; for the
word rendred <hi>despise</hi> by an usual flowr of speech
doth signifie much more than is expressed. This
<pb n="254" facs="tcp:61385:133"/>
is <hi>v. 20—Doct.</hi> 1. So insufficient are even
the regenerate of themselves to discharge com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mand<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>

duties in a spiritual manner, 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 2. 5.

                  <hi>Exod.</hi> 17. 12. that there is an absolute ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cessity
of constantly renewed supplies of influence
from the spirit of God for their incitement to du<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty,
<hi>
                     <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 word">
                        <desc>〈◊〉</desc>

                  </gap> bearing in duty,
<hi>Joh.</hi> 15. 5. for the renewing of their strength,
liveliness and vigour of spirit, when it is much
abated and blunted by their long continuance at
duty; <hi>Isa.</hi> 40. 31. For, therefore, as a necessary
help for performing the forementioned duties of
<hi>rejoycing evermore, praying without ceasing,</hi> and
<hi>of giving thanks</hi> in every thing, he enjoyneth
that they would carefully cherish the gifts, mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions
and incitements of Gods spirit, <hi>quench not
the spirit,</hi> saith he. 2. Though the saving gifts
of the spirit of God, and such as accompany sal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>va<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>ion,
cannot be utterly lost, 1 <hi>Joh.</hi> 3. 9. yet
their actings may for a time be intermitted, <hi>Cant.
5.</hi> 2. yea themselves, as to some degrees, much
abated, <hi>Rev.</hi> 2. 4. and his common gifts of know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge,
memory, historical faith, legal repentance
and remorse for sin, totally lost, <hi>Heb.</hi> 6. 4, 5, 6.
and his suggestions and incitements to holy duties,
as they often are repelled by many, <hi>Psal. 81.
10,</hi> 11. so being frequently repelled, they do ut<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terly
cease in some and are wholly extinguished,
<hi>Eph.</hi> 4. 18. For, the disswasion from <hi>quenching
the spirit</hi> implyes that the spirit, in his gifts and
motions, may be quenched, to wit, in the foremen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tioned
respects, as the Scriptures cited do clear.
<pb n="255" facs="tcp:61385:133"/>
3. The gifts and motions of the spirit of God are
of such a nature, that if they be not entertained
and cherished, they are thereby <hi>ipso facto</hi> quench<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed,
weakned, and in progress of time, utterly abo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lished:
For, therefore he doth not bid them che<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rish,
but only <hi>quench not the spirit,</hi> implying that
they behoved to cherish it, otherwise they could
not but quench it. 4. There is not any so far
advanced in the way of grace and piety, but they
stand in need of being help<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap> and bettered by the
publick preaching of the Lords word by his sent
Ministers; For, he enjoyneth even those <hi>Th<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>ssalo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nians,</hi>
whom he had formerly so much commended,
<hi>chap. 1. 4, &amp;c.</hi> to attend the publick Preaching of
Gods word, <hi>despise not proph<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>sie,</hi> saith he. 5. Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stant
attendance upon the Word preached by sent
Ministers is a singular help to beget and enter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain
the gifts and motions of the spirit of God to
good in our hearts. And careless neglect, much
more contempt, of that ordinance, is the ready
way to quench and extinguish any motions to
good, any checks or challenges for evil from the
spirit of the Lord, and consequently doth end in
gross profanity at last; For, unto that disswasive
from quenching the spirit, he immediately sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>joyns,
<hi>despise not prophesie,</hi> or publick preaching.
6. This ordinance of publick preaching, as it is
most useful and necessary in it self: so it hath been
even in the time of the Apostles, and yet is in hazard
to be contemned, what through the insufficiency,
<hi>Hos.</hi> 4. 6. or unministerial conversation, <hi>Mal.</hi> 2. 8.
or the proud and lofty dividing humour of some
who preach it, 1 <hi>Pet.</hi> 5. 3. and 3 <hi>Joh.</hi> 9. and

               <p>In these two verses are the two last particular
branches of sanctification here enjoyned. By the
first he doth guard the former whereof <hi>v.</hi> 20. for,
lest he had thereby seemed to have enjoyned obe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dience
unto every thing which Ministers Preach,
he doth therefore first command them to <hi>prove</hi>
and try accurately by the written word, <hi>Act.</hi> 17. 11.
as Goldsmiths do Gold by a touchstone, (as the
word implyeth) and the thing to be tryed is <hi>all
things,</hi> to wit, all those things which are delivered
in Preaching by them who are sent Ministers, and
not convict of heresie, for, if they be not sent, the
Lords people are not to hear them, <hi>Joh.</hi> 10. 5.
nor yet if they be known hereticks, whose mouths
should be stopt, <hi>Tit.</hi> 1. 11. Next, to <hi>hold fast</hi>
(or, as the word signifieth, to hold forcibly and
with both hands, against all who would withhold)
<hi>that which is good,</hi> or which after tryal should be
found good doctrine firmly grounded upon the
<pb n="257" facs="tcp:61385:134"/>
word, and consequently to abstain from that
which should be found evil or unsound. This is
<hi>v.</hi> 21. The second branch here pressed is that
they would <hi>abstain from</hi> and eschew not only
that which is really and in it self evil and sinful,
but also that which hath any <hi>appearance,</hi> shew or
representation of evil, that is, whatever (not be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
otherwise commanded by God, <hi>Exod. 12. 35,
36.)</hi> may give just ground unto unprejudiced be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>holders
(who are not malicious, <hi>Gal.</hi> 2. 4, 5.
even though they be otherwise weak, 1 <hi>Cor. 10.
28.</hi>) to suspect the guilt of some real evil in
him, who practiseth it, such are dangerous phrases
of speech in Preaching though not plainly hereti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cal,
1 <hi>Tim.</hi> 6. 3. sitting at meat in an Idols tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple,
1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 10. 21. familiar and unnecessary con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>versing
without a call with profane lewd persons,
<hi>Luk.</hi> 22. 55. or in secret suspect places with per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sons
of a different Sex, chiefly if he or she be
evil reported of. This is <hi>v. 22. Doct.</hi> 1. So
foolish and inconsiderate are most men naturally,
that when they are exercised in flying from the
one sinful extream, they are in no small hazard to
be carryed unawares upon the other. Their great
intentness upon the evil which they flye from, and
is alwayes before, them, doth make them not to
ponder or advert unto the snare which is behind
them. <hi>Paul</hi> implyeth so much, while having dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>swaded
from the one extream of despising pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lick
preaching, <hi>v.</hi> 20. he presently disswadeth
them from the other, of giving blind obedience
to their Ministers, while he saith, <hi>prove all things.</hi>
2. Though all private Christians have not re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived
<pb n="258" facs="tcp:61385:135"/>
an equal measure of gifts, <hi>Rom.</hi> 14. 1. yet
the Lord hath bestowed a spirit of discerning, in
a greater or a lesser measure, upon all, by which,
if diligently and tenderly improved in the search
of Scripture <hi>(Act. 17. 11.)</hi> accompanied with
prayer <hi>(Psal. 119. 19.)</hi> they may be enabled
so to judge of what they hear delivered in preach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing,
as to choose and embrace what is sound and
nourishing, and refuse and reject whatever is er<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>roneous
and hurtful: for, if they had not such a
spirit of discerning bestowed upon them by God,
it should have been in vain to enjoyn them <hi>to
prove all things, and hold fast that which is
good.</hi> 3. The spirit of discerning, bestowed by
God on private Christians, should be exercised
in judging of their Ministers doctrine; not in
order to their passing a judicial sentence upon
him; for they are not his Judges, 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 14. 32.
nor yet to the venting of their carping censures
against him, making his Ministry in all things
unsavoury unto others, but in order to the regu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lating
of their own practice, in chusing what is
right, and refusing what is wrong of what they
hear; for, he enjoyneth the exercise of their
judgement of discretion in relation to their own
practice, even that they <hi>may hold fast what is
good.</hi> 4. As a fixt resolution to be constant in
the maintenance of any opinion should flow from
rational conviction, after exact search, that the
opinion which we hold is true and sound, other<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wise
our constancy and fixedness is but self-willed
pertinacy, <hi>Jer.</hi> 44. 16. So when, after exact en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quiry,
truth is found out, we ought to be so fixed
<pb n="259" facs="tcp:61385:135"/>
and peremptory in our resolution to maintain it,
as that we may not waver or be tossed to and fro
with any wind of doctrine which is contrary un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to
it, <hi>Ephes.</hi> 4. 14. for, before they resolve, he

tentations, but all, and not only at some times,
but alwayes: for, this is enjoyned in the last
place, as the highest step of a tender walk, to
<hi>abstain from the appearance of evil,</hi> by which a
mans name might justly suffer or his neighbour
be scandalized, and to abstain not only from some,
but <hi>all appearance</hi> of evil.</p>

               <q>Ver. 23. And the very God of peace sanctifie you
wholly: and I pray God your whole spirit and
soul and body be preserved blameless unto the
coming of our Lord Jesus Christ.</q>
               <p>In the third part of the Chapter he concludeth
the whole Epistle, and first, in this verse by prayer
to God, that he would work those graces and du<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties
of sanctification in them which he hath pressed
upon them from <hi>chap. 4. v.</hi> 3. The particulars in
which prayer are, first, the stile given to God, he
is the <hi>very God of peace,</hi> as being the author of
all sanctified peace among men, <hi>Psal.</hi> 147. 14.
and chiefly of their peace with God flowing from
justification, <hi>Rom.</hi> 5. 1. which epithete, it seemeth,
doth here serve as a ground for faith to rely on
for obtaining the thing sought, to wit, that he would
sanctifie them, because he was become a God of
peace to them, having justified them, <hi>Rom.</hi> 8. 30.
The second particular is the thing prayed for, that
he would, first, <hi>sanctifie</hi> them, whereby must be
meant the making them to grow in sanctification,
described <hi>chap. 4. v.</hi> 3. for they were already san<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctified
in part. And, next, <hi>preserve them blame<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>less,</hi>
whereby is meant their preservation by the
power of God in the state of grace without apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stasie
or backsliding, which sanctification, the pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gress
and perseverance wherein is here prayed for,
is described from its universality in extending it self
to the whole man; set down, first, more general<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
in the word, <hi>wholly,</hi> next, in a particular enume<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration
of the several parts of the whole man, three
<pb n="261" facs="tcp:61385:136"/>
in number, 1. <hi>His spirit,</hi> which, when contra-distinguished
to the <hi>soul,</hi> as it is here, doth signifie
the understanding and knowing part of the man.
2. <hi>His soul,</hi> whereby, being distinguished from
the <hi>spirit,</hi> must be meant his will and affections.
3. <hi>His body,</hi> that is, the outward man by which
the soul doth act. The third particular in the
prayer is a date or term-day condescended upon,
to wit, the <hi>coming of the Lord Jesus Christ,</hi> which
expresseth not only the time how long he desires
that Gods care in preserving and making them to
grow in sanctification should last, but also the
term-day when this petition shall be answered to
the full, and believers made wholly blameless in
holiness, without all spot of ignorance in their un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derstanding,
and disconformity to Gods will, or
perverseness in their will and affections, or of any
sin whatsoever in their body or outward members,
all this shall be <hi>unto,</hi> or as the word may read <hi>in</hi>
the second <hi>coming of Christ</hi> the Lord to judge the
world. Hence Learn 1. A Minister is not to think
himself exonered, when he hath pressed the pra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctice
of all necessary duties upon the people of
his charge, but he must be tenderly solicitous about
the success of his pains among them: and more
particularly, It is a necessary piece of a Ministers
duty to be frequent and fervent in prayer with God
for them, beseeching him earnestly to work that in
them, which he hath pressed upon them; for, the
Apostle having pressed upon them the several du<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties
of sanctification, from <hi>v.</hi> 3. of <hi>chap.</hi> 4. doth
betake himself to God by prayer that he would
<hi>sanctifie them wholly.</hi> 2. Precepts and exhorta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions
<pb n="262" facs="tcp:61385:137"/>
to duty which are frequent in Scripture, do
not inferr any power in mans self, or in his free-will
to give obedience unto what he is commanded.
They only shew it is our duty to obey, <hi>Mic.</hi> 6. 8.
and such a duty as do it we must if we would be
saved, <hi>Luk.</hi> 13. 3. and are an outward mean by
which the spirit of God doth effectually work that
in his people which he requireth from them, <hi>Cant.
5.</hi> 2. with 4. for if they had sufficient strength in
themselves, as of themselves, to obey, what he hath
pressed upon them, to what end should he pray
so fervently here unto the <hi>God of peace to sanctifie
them.</hi> 5. As the grace of sanctification is not
perfected at one instant, but carryed on by degrees
until it be perfected at death, 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 13. 9. there
being still some remainders of the body of death
in the best, <hi>Rom.</hi> 7. 24. for keeping them humble,
2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 12. 7. for giving them daily errands to the
fountain of free grace for pardon, 1 <hi>Joh.</hi> 2. 1. and
renewed strength, 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 12. 8, 9. and for ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king
them long to be dissolved and freed from sin
root and branch, 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 5. 4. So a mean degree of
sanctification even though it be undoubtedly sin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cere,
should not be rested upon as satisfactory,
but daily growth and progress therein endeavour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed,
without any full satisfaction or quieting of
our minds in any degree or measure, until sancti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fying
grace be fully perfected in glory: for, see<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
they were already sanctified in part, it must be
growth in sanctification for which he prayeth,
which implyeth that their sanctification was not
perfected, and that they themselves should much
more endeavour to grow in it, and this until
<pb n="263" facs="tcp:61385:137"/>
Christs second coming, if their death should not
prevent it. And <hi>the very God of peace sanctifie
you wholly—unto the coming,</hi> &amp;c. 4. As
God becometh a God of peace and reconciled unto
none but to those whom he sanctifieth, and in whom
he worketh a gracious change; So he sanctifieth
none but those to whom he becometh a God of
peace first; and therefore that our endeavours after
holiness may have success, we should have a care
to get our peace made with God in the first place:
for, he joyneth these two, peace with God, and san<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctification
from God, and maketh the latter to fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low
upon the former: <hi>and the very God of peace
sanctifie you.</hi> 5. As the first beginnings of sancti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fying
grace, <hi>(Ezek. 36. 26.)</hi> so our growth and
progress in it is wholly from God. It is true,
there are some principles of a new life wrought in
us at first conversion, which have their own activity
and concurrence for carrying on the work of grace
in us afterward, 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 13. 4, 5. but as they are
created in us by God at the first, <hi>(Ezek. 36. 26.)</hi>
so they must be excited to their work, <hi>Cant.</hi> 4. 16.
upheld and strengthned in their work, <hi>Luk.</hi> 22. 32.
and blessed by God with the success of growth in
grace following upon their work above any efficacy
that is in themselves, <hi>Phil.</hi> 1. 6. and therefore our
growth in grace, doth yet remain intirely and
wholly Gods work, for he ascribeth growth in
grace to God as the author, while he prayeth the
<hi>very God of peace to sanctifie them.</hi> 6. So many
are those by-ways of errour, 2 <hi>Pet.</hi> 3. 17. profa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity,
<hi>Heb.</hi> 12. 16. formality, <hi>&amp;c. 2 Tim.</hi> 3. 5. to
divert us from the way of holiness after we are
<pb n="264" facs="tcp:61385:138"/>
engaged in it, so many unexpected difficulties do
meet us in the way, <hi>Act.</hi> 14. 22. and such is our
levity and readiness to repent our undertaking, <hi>Joh.
6.</hi> 66. our weakness to resist tentations, <hi>Matth.
26.</hi> 70. and easiness to be led aside unto those
other by-wayes, <hi>Jer.</hi> 25. that there is no less need
than of the power of God who did at first engage
us, to preserve us carefully, powerfully, and as it
were with a strong guard, in the way of holiness;
otherwise we cannot long stand upright in it,
1 <hi>Pet.</hi> 1. 5. for, he prayeth unto God to <hi>preserve</hi>
them in holiness, The word in the original signifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth
to preserve accurately, as he who watcheth at
the doors of a prison and is used <hi>Act. 4. 3. 5. 18.
&amp;</hi> 24. 23. 7. Even the understanding and
knowing part of the regenerate is but renewed in
part and standeth in need to be more and more
sanctified by reason of a great deal of ignorance,
1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 13. 9. uncertainty, <hi>Mark</hi> 9. 24. curiosity,
<hi>Joh.</hi> 21. 21, 22. proneness to mistake the Lords
way of dealing, <hi>Isa.</hi> 49. 14. and several other in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firmities
which are in the understandings even
of the best; for, therefore doth he pray that
God would <hi>sanctifie</hi> as well as <hi>preserve</hi> even the
renewed <hi>Thessalonians</hi> in their spirit. <hi>And I pray
God your whole spirit,</hi> &amp;c. 8. The will and af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fections
also of the <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="2 letters">

                     <desc>〈◊〉</desc>
                  </gap> in need to be more and more
sanctified; there being a great deal not only of
peremptory unwillingness, sometimes, in the will
to good, whereby it sometimes refuseth, <hi>John
4.</hi> 9. and frequently shifteth and delayeth the pra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctice
of necessary duty, <hi>Hag.</hi> 1. 2. but also of an
<pb n="265" facs="tcp:61385:138"/>
hankering inclination unto evil, whereby it some<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times
closeth with sin against knowledge, 2 <hi>Sam.
11.</hi> 4. and sometimes excites the understanding to
find out excuses and subterfuges to make sin appear
no sin, or but a little one, that it may well sin with
less reluctancy, <hi>Cant.</hi> 5. 3. For, he prayeth also
that their <hi>soul,</hi> that is, their will and affections
may be sanctified, <hi>that your whole spirit and soul,</hi>
&amp;c. 9. As the Lord doth not only require in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward
sancti<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>y, in the understanding, will and affe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctions,
but also outward, in the body and all its
members, (see <hi>chap. 4. v. 4. doct. 1.)</hi> So even
the truly regenerate have not their very outward
man so well reformed, but there is need to have it
more and more sanctified. Even the body and its
parts, especially the organs of sense and speech, and
the instruments of the loco-motive faculty, have in
them some of that natural stiffness and averseness
from being exercised about good and profitable ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jects,
and proneness joyned with agility to be em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ployed
in evil, which is spoken of <hi>Rom. 3. 10, &amp;c.</hi>
For, he prayeth that their body also may be more
sanctified. <hi>And I pray God your whole spirit soul
and body,</hi> &amp;c. 10. As there is not any the least
principal part and particle of the body, and the
meanest faculty of the soul and such as are only
subservient to the most principal faculties of it, but
they are one way or other defiled with sin, and
stand in need of sanctifying grace; So there is
not any, no not the meanest of those in a renewed
mans soul or body, to which the Lord doth not
extend his special care, not only in changing and
sanctifying it at the first, but also in making that
<pb n="266" facs="tcp:61385:139"/>
begun change to increase and grow, and in preserv<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
the whole man and all his parts, even to the
meanest, in that gracious frame and plyableness to
good unto which he hath brought it. Otherwise if
the meanest member of the body or faculty of the
soul were left to their own keeping, they could not
choose but suddenly miscarry; for, he prayeth that
<hi>their whole spirit, whole soul, and whole body may
be sanctified and preserved by God,</hi> and doubtless he
prayeth for nothing to them, but what the Lord doth
ordinarily to the renewed. 11. As all belivers shall
attain to their full stature in grace, even to a perfect
man, at Christs second coming, and be freed from
all necessity of any further growing in grace after
that; So though they will alwayes and to all eter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity
stand in need to be preserved by God in their
glorious state, and accordingly shall be preserved
by him, <hi>Joh.</hi> 17. 24. yet because they are now,
while in their present militant state, obnoxious to
more tentations, <hi>Eph.</hi> 6. 12. and not sufficiently con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firmed
in good, 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 10. 12. therefore they stand
in more need of preserving garce now than they
will then, when there shall be no devil nor wicked
world to tempt them, <hi>Rev. 20. 10. &amp; 21. v.</hi> 27.
and nothing of a body of death in themselves to
comply with tentations, <hi>Heb. 12.—23.</hi> as there
is now: for, he makes Christs second coming, the
date how long he would have God to continue in
sanctifying and preserving them, which is to be un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derstood
in the way expressed in the doctrine, <hi>unto
the coming of our Lord Jesus Christ,</hi> saith he.</p>
               <pb n="267" facs="tcp:61385:139"/>
               <q>Ver. 24. Faithful is he that calleth you, who also
will do it.</q>
               <p>He concludeth, secondly, with a promise, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in
he assures them that God <hi>will do it,</hi> to wit, what
he presently prayed for, even sanctifie them wholly,
and preserve them blameless; and that because <hi>God
is faithful,</hi> that is, alwayes the same, and like him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>self,
who will certainly perform whatever he hath
promised, and therefore he would certainly pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>serve
them, seeing he had promised so much in ef<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect
unto them, when he did effectually <hi>call</hi> them,
at least to as many of them as he had so <hi>called.</hi> For
effectual calling is the first breaking out and open
declaration of Gods secret and eternal purpose to
preserve and save those whom he calleth, <hi>Rom. 8. 30.
Doct.</hi> 1. Our prayers put up to God, whether in
behalf of our selves or others, should be grounded
upon some explicite or implicite promise, and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sequently
flow from faith that God will grant what
we ask according to the absolute or conditional te<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour
of the promise; for, <hi>Pauls</hi> prayers were
grounded upon such a promise, and did flow from
such confidence even <hi>that he would do it,</hi> as he
here expresseth. 2. Most absolute and certain pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mises
may not weaken our diligence in prayer for
obtaining the thing promised, but rather incite us
to it. Prayer being the mean appointed of God in
the conscientious practice whereof he useth to be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stow
the good things promised, <hi>Ezek.</hi> 36. 37. for,
<hi>Paul</hi> did pray for their preservation, <hi>v.</hi> 23. though
he certainly knew, and accordingly doth promise
<pb n="268" facs="tcp:61385:140"/>
unto them, <hi>that God would do it.</hi> 3. As the Lord
doth still continue to call those, whom he hath once
effectually called by giving them renewed sights of
their natural sin and misery, 1 <hi>Tim.</hi> 1. 13. and
making them renew their gripes by faith on Jesus
Christ the offered remedy, 1 <hi>Tim.</hi> 1. 15. So effe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctual
calling and the powerful drawing of a soul
from nature to grace, is a speaking pledge of Gods
purpose to preserve the soul so called in the state
of grace, and to make him grow in grace until at
last he be without spot and blameless unto the end;
for, the word <hi>calleth</hi> is in the present time, and
noteth a continued action, and is here given as a
pledge of Gods purpose to sanctifie and preserve
them, <hi>he that calleth you, who also will do it.</hi> 4. No
man can know, and much less draw any comfort
from the Lords eternal purpose in election to save
him and perfect the work of grace in him, until he
be once effectually called and become a real convert
from sin to holiness; yea, he makes effectual call<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
the first speaking evidence of election, and
that which giveth access to look on the decree of
election as a ground of expectation that he will
perform the thing decreed; and therefore the pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mise
here may be looked upon as conditional and
suspended upon this condition if so they were
called, <hi>he that calleth you will also do it.</hi> 5. There
is no less than Gods fidelity impledged to believ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers
for the most certain performance of all Gods
gracious promises, so, that though they be un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>worthy
to whom he should perform what is pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mised,
yet his impledged faithfulness and truth of
his nature is alwayes of that much worth as his
<pb n="269" facs="tcp:61385:140"/>
respect unto it will put him upon the performance;
for, <hi>Paul</hi> sheweth Gods faithfulness is laid in pledge
while he saith, <hi>faithful is he who calleth you who
also will do it.</hi>

               <p>He concludeth, thirdly, by recommending some
particulars unto their care, as, first, that they
would give him and his collegues the help of their
prayers, <hi>v.</hi> 25. and, secondly, that they, to wit, the
Midisters and Church-rulers, to whom this and the
following direction is given, would <hi>greet</hi> or sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lute
<hi>all the brethren</hi> or members of their Church
in his name, in testimony of his hearty affection to
them, and take occasion hence to manifest and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firm
their affection one to another among them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves,
by giving them <hi>a kiss,</hi> which in those times
and places was commonly used in civil salutations
as the usual sign and testimony of affection. And
he giveth this kiss the epithete of <hi>holy,</hi> to shew that
it should be sincere and chaste, and neither unchaste
nor hypocritical, <hi>v.</hi> 26. Besides what is observed
upon <hi>Eph. 6. v. 19. doct.</hi> 1, 2. and <hi>Col. 4. v. 3.
doct.</hi> 1, 3. Learn hence, 1. The Lord hath so
dispensed his gifts and graces unto his people,
that, though he giveth not an equal measure unto
all; yet to every one somewhat, and to the meanest
so much as they may be, sometimes and in some re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>spects,
useful unto others who are most eminent<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
that hereby mutual love may be kept among all,
while none can say unto another, <hi>I have no need of
<pb n="270" facs="tcp:61385:141"/>
thee, 1 Cor.</hi> 12. 21. for, <hi>Paul</hi> supponeth so much,
and therefore calleth upon them all, even the mean<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>est
not excepted, to help him by their prayers, <hi>bre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thren
pray for us,</hi> saith he. 2. It conduceth
much to make way for success unto a Ministers
pains among a people, that they know he loveth
them; otherwise if they doubt of this, they are
prone to suspect, if not to cast at all that cometh
from him, 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 7. 2, 3. for, therefore the Apostle
doth usually close his Epistles by saluting those to
whom he writeth, in testimony of his affection to
them, that what he writeth may have the more of
weight with them; <hi>all the brethren,</hi> saith he.
3. A Minister should labour so to entertain love
betwixt him and the people, as that no expressions
of his love, nor insinuations of his for that end
do tend, much less be intended, to divide the Lords
people among themselves, of purpose to make both
or any of the dissentient parties more devoted and
strictly tyed unto him; but must endeavour that
the same spirit of love which breatheth in him,
may breath in all the Lords people toward one
another: for, he doth so express his affection un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to
them that he willeth them to express, as it were,
the same affection towards one another, while he
saith, <hi>Greet all the brethren with an holy kiss.</hi>
4. As it is not sufficient for Christians to carry
inward good will and affection one to another,
but necessary, sometimes, that inward love be
made evident by some outward expressions and
testimonies of the same; So the Lords people
ought not to scruple at, or upon groundless scru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ples
to abstain from, any decent and innocent ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pression
<pb n="271" facs="tcp:61385:141"/>
of love and affection, which is ordina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rily
used in the times and places where they live.
Singularity in such things is not Religion, nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
is scrupulosity about them any point of ten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derness:
for, he bids them express their affection
by that which was the usual sign and testimony
thereof at those times. <hi>Greet all the brethren with
an holy kiss.</hi> But, 5. Even those external testi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monies
of love and respect may not be comple<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mental,
or used only as a piece of a mans good
breeding or civility, much less as an engine to
ensnare the party, towards whom they are used,
unto a false belief that he is affected and loved
where he is not; <hi>Luke</hi> 22. 48. but they ought to
be sincere and free from any base and sinful in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gredient
of that kind: So that even in external
duties of common civility we are bound to ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ercise
some one or other Christian and holy ver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tue:
for, therefore doth he require that their
affection be made evident by <hi>an holy kiss,</hi> or a kiss
sanctified and made holy by the grace of sincere
affection which is expressed by it, and from which
it doth flow. <hi>Greet all the brethren with an holy
kiss.</hi>
               </p>
               <q>Ver. 27. I charge you by the Lord that this
Epistle be read unto all the holy brethren.</q>
               <p>The third recommendation is chiefly pressed
upon their Ministers and Church-guides, to whom
it seemeth this Epistle was sent immediately to be
communicate unto the rest. Those he <hi>chargeth by
the Lord,</hi> or (as the word implyeth and signifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth
<pb n="272" facs="tcp:61385:142"/>
(see 1 <hi>Sam. 14. 24. Matth. 26. 63.)</hi> he
adjureth them as they would eschew the wrath
and vengeance of the Lord Christ, so they would
not keep up this <hi>Epistle</hi> unto themselves, but
cause it to come to, and be plainly <hi>read</hi> in the
hearing of <hi>all the brethren</hi> or Church-members
whom he calleth <hi>holy.</hi> See upon <hi>Phil. 1. v. 1.
doct.</hi> 5. Hence Learn 1. To debar and exclude
the Lords people from acquainting themselves
with Scripture, either by reading it themselves or
hearing it read by others, is a most grievous sin,
obliging the person or persons guilty to undergo
the stroke of Gods eternal wrath &amp; vengeance; And
therefore not only should Scripture be translated
unto the native language of every Nation where
Christ hath a Church, that people may read it, and
hear it, and be acquainted with it; But also the
Lords people themselves ought diligently to im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prove
what helps of that kind are afforded for
bringing them to intimate acquaintance with the
mind of God revealed in Scripture, and look upon
their so doing as a duty of greatest importance
and weight; for, <hi>Paul</hi> doth <hi>charge,</hi> or, adjure
them with denunciation of Gods heavy vengeance
in case they should not cause read this Epistle to
all the holy brethren; adjurations of which sort
are not to be used but when duties of weight are
charged. Now what <hi>Paul</hi> doth charge here about
this Epistle was doubtless his mind in relation to
other Scriptures; seeing there is nothing peculiar
to this Epistle, for which the Lords people should
be made acquainted with it, that may not be said
of other Scriptures also; Besides, that the Apostle
<pb n="273" facs="tcp:61385:142"/>
doth elsewhere express himself much to the same
purpose, of some others of his Epistles, <hi>Col.</hi> 4. 16.
and of all Scripture indefinitely, <hi>Col. 3. 16.
Doct.</hi> 2. It concerneth Ministers and Church-guides,
especially, to see to it carefully that the
Lords people of their charge be acquainted with
Scripture, and, in order to this end, to incite them
to read it in secret, <hi>Col.</hi> 3. 16. to have it read in
their families, <hi>Deut.</hi> 6. 9. as also to labour upon
those who have power, and whom it concerneth,
that Children and young ones of both Sexes be
trained up at Schools, at least so far as they may
be able to read the Lords word distinctly in their
own native language: for, this charge is given to
the Church-guides, <hi>I charge you by the Lord that
this Epistle be read unto all the holy brethren,</hi> saith he.
3. That Scripture be publickly read to the Lords
people assembled together for his worship, even
though it be not presently exponed and applyed
by the Minister, is so far from being a part of wil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>worship,
that it should seem from this place to have
some stamp of divine authority put upon it, as upon
an ordinance useful in its own place, as for several
other ends, so, especially, for acquainting the Lords
people with the language of the Holy Ghost
speaking in Scripture, and with the History of the
Bible, a great part whereof otherwise some may
possibly never so much as once hear with their ears,
though they live to many years: for, he chargeth
them not only to incite the Lords people to read
this Epistle themselves and apart, but that it <hi>be
read unto all the holy brethren,</hi> to wit, (as it seem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth)
being assembled together.</p>
               <pb n="274" facs="tcp:61385:143"/>
               <q>Ver. 28. The grace of our Lord Jesus Christ be
with you. Amen.</q>
               <p>He concludeth the Epistle, lastly, by his usual
and confident farewel-wish for <hi>our Lord Jesus
Christ his grace,</hi> or, favour, as the fountain, and
all good things, as streams flowing from it, to be
conveyed to them and continued with them. Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sides
what is already observed upon the like fare<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wel-wish
in the close of the four former Epistles.
Hence Learn, So inexhaustible is the fountain of
Gods free grace and favour, and so copious are the
streams of all spiritual blessings flowing from it,
that no such measure either of the one or the other
can be attained by any, but more may be had; more
is allowed, and more and more is daily to be
sought and thirsted after: for, though real be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lievers
among them had received already a great
measure of Gods grace and favour, in its sense
and in its effects, yet he wishes unto them not only
the continuance of what they had, but some fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
degree to be added as more of it, while he
saith, <hi>The grace of our Lord Jesus Christ be with
you all.</hi> Amen.</p>

               <p>The first Epistle unto the Thessalonians was writ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten

<hi>v.</hi> 1. and thirdly the usual salutation, <hi>v.</hi> 2. Besides
what is formerly observed upon the place pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sently
cited, <hi>Hence Learn.</hi> 1. As the Lord in
deep wisdom and rich mercy hath appointed se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veral
means of edification for his Church; So his
sent servants are bound to endeavour their edifica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
by one mean when they are not in a capacity to
edifie them by another; for, <hi>Paul</hi> being out of a capa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>city,
for the time, to edifie this Church by publick
Preaching, doth endeavour to edifie them by his
writings. <hi>Paul</hi>—<hi>unto the Church of the Thes<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>salonians.</hi>
2. The written word of God is so
contrived that it did not only serve to edifie those
unto whom it was first directed, but also doth
hold forth copious matter of edification unto all
others to whose knowledge it shall come, and
should be improved by them accordingly: for,
this and the rest of <hi>Pauls</hi> Epistles, which were at
first directed to such and such particular Churches
and persons, do stand in Scripture as a rule and Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>non
of saith and manners unto all Christian Chur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ches
and persons to the worlds end, <hi>Paul</hi>—<hi>unto
the Church of the Thessalonians.</hi> 3. The spirit of
<pb n="281" facs="tcp:61385:146"/>
God which speaketh in Scripture doth not so much
regard either variety or elegancy of words and
stile, as the purpose expressed by those words; and
Ministers who would rather edifie the Lords peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple,
than beget a good opinion of their own abili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties
among their hearers, should study to be acted
by the same spirit, 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 2. 4. for, <hi>Paul</hi> useth the
very same form of plain words in the inscription of
this Epistle, which he used in the former. <hi>Paul
and Silvanus and Timotheus,</hi> &amp;c. 4. Though the
Lord hath bound himself by absolute promise to
grant unto us whatever we ask in the name of
Christ, <hi>Joh.</hi> 16. 23. and according to his will,
1 <hi>Joh.</hi> 5. 14. yet the most fervent prayers of gra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cious
saints, accompanied with all conditions re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quired
in prayer, are not alwayes attended with an
answer in the same very thing which is sought; and
therefore the forementioned promises must be un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derstood
with this alternative, God will grant us,
either what we pray for, or what he in wisdom see<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth

<hi>Paul</hi> prayed fervently that he might see their face,

people, and especially his publick instruments, when
marred and crossed in prosecuting some one or

advance the Lords work, ought not to fret or sit
down discouraged, but to consider wisely what

you, brethren, as it is meet, because that your
faith groweth exceedingly, and the charity of
every one of you all towards each other abound<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth.</q>
               <p>The Apostles scope in this second part of the
Chapter being to comfort those persecuted <hi>Thes<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>salonians</hi>
under their present sad sufferings, &amp; there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by
to confirm them the more in those truths for
which they did suffer, he propoundeth several
grounds of consolation unto them. The first
whereof, is, the high esteem which he and his as<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sociates
had of their graces, which was testified in
two things: first, his esteem of them, and of
Gods graces in them, was such that he did Judge
himself <hi>bound</hi> because of the <hi>meetness,</hi> congruity and
equity of the duty in several respects, to make consci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence
<hi>of giving thanks to God for them,</hi> and that al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wayes,
in so far as there was alwayes a supply of new
matter for this duty furnished unto him from them,
which he condescends upon in two particulars, first,
their <hi>faith did grow exceedingly,</hi> or overgrow,
and grow over-bounds, to wit, not the bounds pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>scribed
by God, but beyond what it was before,
yea, and, it may be, the expectation which men had
of them. (See how faith doth grow upon <hi>Col. 2.
<pb n="283" facs="tcp:61385:147"/>
v. 7. doct. 5.)</hi> next, their charity, or, love to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards
each other did <hi>abound</hi> and also grow, and
this in every one of them all without exception, to
wit, so far as he in charity could judge, being
now at a distance and informed of their estate only
by the favourable reports of others, or of some
among themselves. (See how charity doth increase
and grow, 1 <hi>Thes. 4. v. 10. doct. 6.)</hi> Learn fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
hence, 1. As the Lord giveth sometimes
way unto the rage and fury of men and Devils to
trouble and persecute his dearest Saints for righ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teousness
sake; So it usually falleth out that the
more they rage, the less they gain their intent, The
more they stain the Churches outward beauty, the
more doth her inward beauty, the sanctifying
graces of Gods spirit and faith in Jesus Christ,
increase and grow: for, so was it with this perse<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cuted
and afflicted Church, as the general scope
of this part of the Chapter, which is to comfort
them under their sufferings, doth imply, and the
following verse doth express; and yet <hi>Paul</hi> affirm<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth
here, <hi>their faith did grow exceedingly, and
their charity abound.</hi> 2. However the Lord doth
usually make his peoples graces to thrive best under
a suffering lot, as said is, yet even then they do
not want their own discouragements and faintings,
arising, partly, from the fear and feeling of their
own weakness, <hi>Job</hi> 6. 12. and partly, from the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mainders
of unmortified corruption within them,
which make them incline to be weary of lying so
long under such a sad and humbling exercise; and
therefore, how thriving soever their case be other<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wise,
they stand in no small need of consolation
<pb n="284" facs="tcp:61385:148"/>
and encouragement: for, <hi>Paul</hi> supponeth so much
while he sets himself to comfort this persecuted
and thriving Church, <hi>we are bound to thank God
alwayes.</hi> 3. It is a singular comfort and encou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ragement
to a gracious soul, under his saddest
cross, to know that the work of grace in him is not
only in a vigorous case, but also taken notice of
by others and improved as an occasion of thanks<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>giving
unto God from many, 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 1. 11. and it
is the duty of Christians, in order to that end, so
to take notice of, and improve the growing graces
of honest sufferers: for, <hi>Paul,</hi> in order to the
comfort and encouragement of this Church, makes
them know he took notice of their growth in grace,
and did improve it as a ground of thanksgiving:
<hi>we are bound to thank God alwayes for you, bre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thren.</hi>
4. A gracious humble heart doth for the
most part so little please himself with his way of
discharging duty to God, and especially this sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lime
and Heavenly duty of thanksgiving and praise,
that he dare hardly say he doth discharge it as he
ought, but only acknowledge his obligation to
discharge it, with the equity and conveniency of
it: And so much ought to be acknowledged and
avowed, when little further can be attained; for,
<hi>Paul</hi> doth not here say he did give thanks, though
doubtless he did so, but only <hi>we are bound to thank
God alwayes for you as it is meet.</hi> 5. We ought
so to comfort and encourage afflicted Christians,
by making them know how much we esteem what
good is in them, as that we do not thereby puff
them up, and make them conceit of what they have
as if they had not received it from God; for, <hi>Paul</hi>
                  <pb n="285" facs="tcp:61385:148"/>
doth thus guard the present consolation, while he
giveth God the praise of any good was in them
and not themselves. <hi>We are bound to thank God
alwayes for you,</hi> saith he. 6. As God deserveth
the thanks and praise of his peoples graces, and not
themselves; and as the gracious receits of others
do lay on a tye of thanksgiving to God upon us;
So we are not alwayes to conceal our conscience-making
of this duty from the knowledge of others,
but ought to make it sometimes known, though
not to gain applause to our selves, <hi>Matth.</hi> 6. 5.
yet, as for other ends, so, thereby to encourage
those whom it concerns, when their case doth other<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wayes
call for it: for, that <hi>Paul</hi> may encourage
this afflicted and persecuted Church, he doth
make them know that he <hi>did alwayes give
thanks to God for them because their faith grew
exceedingly.</hi> 7. Where there is a growth
of saving grace in any, there is not wanting suffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cient
ground of thanksgiving to God for them,
nor yet of comfort and encouragement unto them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves,
this alone being a sufficient evidence that
all things work together for good unto them ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording
to the promise, <hi>Rom.</hi> 8. 28. for, though
this Church was otherwayes sore pressed with
persecution, yet <hi>Paul</hi> looks upon their growth in
grace as matter of thanksgiving to God, and of
comfort to themselves; <hi>because that your faith
groweth exceedingly,</hi> saith he. 8. Then are
Christians praise-worthy in themselves, and for
matter of praise to the Lord and of joy to his
faithful servants who labour among them, when,
according to their time and standing, and the pre<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>cious
<pb n="286" facs="tcp:61385:149"/>
means under which they live, their graces are
upon the growing hand: for, since <hi>Paul</hi> hath
written the former Epistle unto this Church they
had grown exceedingly, and gone far beyond what
themselves then were, as appears from 1 <hi>Thes.
1.</hi> 3. where he only mentioneth their graces sim<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ply,
without any commendation to them for their
growth, but now he shews their faith had grown
exceedingly. And therefore is it that he gives
thanks to God for them here, and glorieth of them
before the Churches <hi>v.</hi> 4. even because, saith he,
<hi>your faith groweth exceedingly and your charity
aboundeth.</hi> 9. As the saving graces of faith and
love admit of degrees, and do not come to their
height and perfection at the first; So they in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crease
and decrease, grow and fade together, in so
far as faith, being the cause of love, <hi>Gal. 5—6.</hi>
and love an evidence of faith, 1 <hi>Joh.</hi> 3. 14. the
vigor and decay of the one cannot choose but have
some answerable influence upon the other: for,
<hi>Paul</hi> sheweth they both did grow proportionably
and together: <hi>your faith,</hi> saith he, <hi>groweth ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceedingly
and your charity aboundeth.</hi> 10. It is
a sweet ingredient for comfort and encourage<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
to an afflicted suffering Church, when Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tan
prevaileth not to make a wedge of their af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flicted
case, or of any other thing, to rent them
asunder neither in opinion, affection or practice:
but the more they are heated and persecuted by
men, the more do they cleave in love and affecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
flowing from faith one to another: And it
must of necessity prove a most uncomfortable ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dition
to all their sufferings when it is other<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wayes;
<pb n="287" facs="tcp:61385:149"/>
for, <hi>Paul</hi> doth mention their abounding
in love towards each other, flowing from faith,
as that which might and doubtless did sweeten
all their sufferings, and yield them matter
of comfort under them, <hi>because,</hi> saith he, <hi>your
faith and charity towards each other aboundeth.</hi>
11. Our Judgement of the inward gracious estate
of others ought to be swayed and ruled with
charity, which though it be not blind in passing
judgement contrary to seen and pregnant evi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dences,
<hi>Titus</hi> 3. 16. yet it is not too suspicious,
where there is not clear ground, 1 <hi>Cor. 13—5.</hi>
and hopeth the best in things which are uncer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain,
1 <hi>Cor. 13—.7—</hi> for, so did <hi>Paul,</hi>
being now at a distance from them, and being in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formed
of their estate by the favourable reports of
those who came from them, he doth without any
further anxious enquiry judge of them all and every
one of them without exception of any as truly
gracious and abounding in charity towards all,
which he could not have done, except he had in
charity construed some known escapes among them
to the better. <hi>The charity of every one of you all
towards each other aboundeth,</hi> saith he.</p>
               <q>Ver. 4. So that we our selves glory in you in the
Churches of God, for your patience and faith in
all your persecutions and tribulations that ye
endure.</q>
               <p>Here is the second thing, whereby his high
esteem of them was testified, which followed upon
their forementioned abundant growth. It weighed
<pb n="288" facs="tcp:61385:150"/>
so with him that he <hi>himself,</hi> a man of a sober
discerning spirit, far from flattery, was constrained
to glory of them, that is, to speak with a kind of holy
boasting (as the word taken in a good sense doth
signifie) to the recommendation of the grace of
God wrought in them by Gods blessing upon his
Ministry, and to propound them to those other
<hi>Churches of God</hi> among whom he gloried of
them, for a pattern to be imitated by them. So
that his gloriation and boasting was not in the
flesh, or in men, which is forbidden, <hi>Phil. 3. 3.
1 Cor.</hi> 3. 21. but in the Lord; for it was not for
things carnal but spiritual, to wit, their faith and
patience, the praise whereof he hath first ascribed
unto God, <hi>v.</hi> 3. and though some commendation
did hereby accrease unto himself, as to the Lords
instrument for good to them, 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 9. 1. yet his
great design herein is not to hunt after applause
unto himself, <hi>Gal.</hi> 1. 10. but to commend the
Lord who had wrought by him, 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 15. 10.
and to excite others to the imitation of those praise<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>worthy
graces which were eminent in this Church,
2 <hi>Cor. 8. v.</hi> 1, 2, 3. with 8. Now the matter of
his boasting was, as he himself doth next express,
first, their <hi>patience</hi> or praise-worthy perseverance
under the yoak of duty with the endurance of the
cross, for the word in the original implyeth both
perseverance and endurance. Next, their <hi>faith,</hi>
or the exercise of that grace in all its branches under
greatest difficulties, both which graces are com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mended
from the great opposition by which they
were assaulted in their exercise, what from mul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiplyed
<hi>persecutions,</hi> that is, afflictions from men
<pb n="289" facs="tcp:61385:150"/>
for righteousness sake, <hi>Matth.</hi> 5. 10. and what
from multiplyed <hi>tribulations,</hi> that is, any affliction
whatsoever, whether immediately or mediately
from God; all which they did with patience and
confidence <hi>endure,</hi> the word signifieth willingly
to endure and suffer, <hi>Matth. 17. 17. 1 Cor. 4. 12.
Doct.</hi> 1. Though Christians should not be proud
of any applause or esteem they have, nor seek to
have their graces made known for gaining esteem
to themselves, except it be in subserviency to the
praise of God; (see upon <hi>Gal. 6. v. 4. doct. 5.)</hi>
yet they ought to look upon it as an encouraging
mercy, when their name is savoury for good, and
their graces made known among the Lords peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple,
in so far as they themselves are thereby ingaged
to walk answerably to their name, 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 9. 2. with
4. and are in better capacity to do good in their sta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
unto those with whom their name is pretious,
2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 8. 18, 19. and God doth thereby get the
more of praise for his goodness to them from ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny,
2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 1. 11. and others also are incited to
glorifie God by their example, <hi>Matth.</hi> 5. 16.
For, in order to their encouragement and comfort,
he shews that their graces were made known by
him to other Churches, and they esteemed of for
them accordingly, while he saith, <hi>So that we our
selves glory in you in the Churches of God.</hi>
2. Though we ought to endeavour, so far as is
possible, to have our names savoury for good unto
all, 1 <hi>Pet.</hi> 2. 12. yet those among men, unto whom
we should study to approve our selves most, and
to carry a deserved commendation from, are the
sober and judicious Godly, who hate dissimulation
<pb n="290" facs="tcp:61385:151"/>
and flattery. And whatever be our esteem with,
or commendation from fawning flatterers, or
the weak, unsolid, (though otherwise pious) dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerners,
it can afford but small encouragement and
comfort, if those others have bad thoughts of
us, or stand by as neutrals: for, the encourage<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
propounded to them doth stand in this that
<hi>Paul</hi> and his associates, who were more eminently
gracious, did think so well of them. <hi>So that we
our selves glory in you,</hi> saith he. 3. A Mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sters
boasting and gloriation as to his flock and
charge should not be in their multitude, riches,
greatness or civilities towards himself, nor yet
simply in their high esteem of him for his abilities
and graces, but in the success of his pains among
them, and in the saving graces of Gods spirit be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stowed
upon them by means of his Ministry; Nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
is it unlawful, but sometimes convenient, for a
Minister so to glory in his flock, providing his
gloriation be qualified as <hi>Pauls</hi> was; (see the ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>position)
for, <hi>Paul</hi> saith, <hi>we our selves glory in
you—for your faith and patience.</hi> 4. As it
is the duty of the Lords people to speak to the
commendation of Gods grace in others; So they
should be ruled by prudence in the discharge of
this duty, and not too lavish in their commenda<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions,
either by commending men too much above
their known worth, or by boasting of them, al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>though
their worth deserve it, indifferently unto
all, even to those who know not the worth of
grace, and to whom the boaster, party boasted of,
and the graces of Gods spirit for which he boast<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth,
are alike unsavoury. There should be a
<pb n="291" facs="tcp:61385:151"/>
distinct and prudent choice both of the party in
whom, and of the party to whom we boast: for,
<hi>Pauls</hi> boasting is of men eminently gracious, as
the preceding verse doth shew, and not indiffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rently
before all, but only in the Churches of God.
<hi>So that,</hi> saith he, <hi>we our selves glory in you in the
Churches of God.</hi> 5. That persecutions, crosses
and tribulations, especially from wicked men, are
the ordinary lot of Gods Church and people, and
the reasons why it is so, see upon <hi>Gal. 1. v. 13.
doct. 6. In all your persecutions and tribulations
which ye endure,</hi> saith he. 6. The greatest glory
of Christians, and the richest matter of gloriation
in them, and of thankfulness to God which can be
afforded unto others from them, is not so much in
their resisting by force, and breaking the yoke and
power of their persecuting enemies, as in their
meek and patient endurance of the utmost of
their rage and fury, before they cede one hove
in the point of truth and duty; for <hi>Paul</hi> did
glory in them for their <hi>patience in all their tribu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lations.</hi>
7. As the grace of patience under suf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferings
presupposeth faith, and cannot be where
faith is not, (whatever seeming patience a natu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral
man, destitute of faith in Jesus Christ, may
have, it is not a saving grace, but either bruitish
stupidity, <hi>Gen.</hi> 49. 15. or heartless despair, <hi>Gen.
4.</hi> 13, 14. or, at the best, a moral vertue only,
1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 13. 3. defective as to the intensive measure
of patience, contrary to <hi>Col. 1.—11.</hi> or as to the
extent of patience to all crosses, contrary to <hi>Col. 1—
11</hi>—and as to the spiritual grounds and motives
from which it should flow, contrary to <hi>Rom.</hi> 5. 3.
<pb n="292" facs="tcp:61385:152"/>
compared with 1.) So the more a man doth grow in
faith the more he will be assisted and furnished with
the grace of patience under cross dispensations;
and as faith is weakned, so our patience also will
decay and languish. For, he joyneth their <hi>pati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence</hi>
with <hi>faith in all their tribulations.</hi> 8. As
grace is then most praise-worthy, when, the more
it is opposed, the more it groweth; So it argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth
an eminent degree of faith and patience, and
such as may indeed be boasted of, and propounded
as a pattern for imitation unto others, when va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riety
of tryals and cross dispensations from God,
and of persecutions from men, do not mar, but
rather quicken the exercise of those graces: for,
their <hi>patience</hi> and <hi>faith,</hi> of which he gloried,
was such as did sustain them and make them <hi>en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dure
all their persecutions and tribulations.</hi>
               </p>
               <q>Ver. 5. Which is a manifest token of the righteous
judgement of God, that ye may be counted worthy
of the Kingdom of God, for which ye also suffer.</q>
               <p>Followeth a second ground of consolation under
their present sad sufferings taken from what their
afflictions from wicked men and their patience un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der
them, spoken of <hi>v.</hi> 4. did signifie. They
were <hi>a manifest token,</hi> or an infallible argument
and demonstration proving convincingly that God
shall judge the world righteously at the last day,
for by this <hi>righteous judgement</hi> must be meant
the last and general judgement, as the following
verses make evident. And, first, it is called <hi>righ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teous,</hi>
because though God doth alwayes judge
<pb n="293" facs="tcp:61385:152"/>
righteously, when he judgeth, <hi>Psal.</hi> 51. 4. yet
then shall his righteousness in judging be most
evident, and all those things which do now obscure it
<hi>(Jer. 12. 1.)</hi> fully removed, <hi>Matth. 25. 32, &amp;c.</hi>
Next, their patient suffering is said to be a con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vincing
evidence that this righteous judgement shall
come to pass, because supponing that undeniable
principle which is clear to the very light of na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture,
<hi>Rom.</hi> 1. 20. that God is an all-seeing omni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>potent
and righteous Judge, it must of necessity
follow that he seeth what injuries are done unto
his people, hath power to punish them, and seeing
he doth not punish them now, he will be avenged
on them hereafter. Which ground of consolation
is further enlarged from the end, or event, of that
last judgement unto them, they should be therein
<hi>accounted,</hi> or judicially accepted and declared, <hi>wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thy,</hi>
or (as the word is rendred, <hi>Act. 26. 20.) fit</hi>
and meet to enjoy <hi>the Kingdom of God,</hi> that is,
Heaven and glory, called a <hi>Kingdom</hi> for reasons
hinted upon <hi>Gal. 5. 21. doct.</hi> 9. and, <hi>of God;</hi>
See upon <hi>Eph. 5. v.</hi> 5. And sheweth that one
piece or evidence of their worthiness and meetness
to enjoy this Kingdom consisteth in their <hi>suffering
for it,</hi> and for their walking in the way of faith
and obedience which leadeth to it; which is not
to be so taken as if their sufferings could make
them worthy of Heaven by way of merit (see
<hi>Rom. 8. 18.)</hi> but only they did presuppose saith in
Christ, <hi>Phil.</hi> 1. 29. and so did evidence their right
to Heaven, seeing faith doth give a right unto it,
<hi>Joh.</hi> 3. 16. As also sanctified sufferings through
Gods blessing do purge away sin and promove
<pb n="294" facs="tcp:61385:153"/>
the work of sanctification in those who suffer,
<hi>Isa.</hi> 27. 9. and so do polish and make them meet for
Heaven, holiness being the way which leadeth to
it, <hi>Heb.</hi> 12. 14. Besides, the Lord hath bound
himself by promise that they who suffer with him
shall also reign with him, 2 <hi>Tim.</hi> 2. 12. and so
their sufferings did make them meet for Heaven as
being a qualification of those to whom Heaven is
promised. <hi>Doct.</hi> 1. It is the Lords allowance
unto believers to look upon the day of general
judgement and the approaching of it with cheer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fulness
and courage, and so as to draw comfort
under all their sufferings from the faith of it: yea,
and though the remembrance of this day be ter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rible
to men unrenewed, <hi>Act.</hi> 24. 25. yet it is most
comfortable unto believers when they are in a
good case and temper: As knowing that then all
their wrongs shall be righted, <hi>Psal.</hi> 37. 6. the
atheistical suggestions of Satan in prejudice of
Gods overruling providence wholly refuted, <hi>Mal.
3.</hi> 18. the Bride, the Lambs wife, compleatly and
in all her members, glorified, <hi>Rev.</hi> 21. 2, 9. and
they themselves fully freed from all sin and mise<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry,
and made perfectly blessed in the full enjoying
of God unto all eternity, 1 <hi>Thes.</hi> 4. 17. For, he
laboureth to perswade them that this day of gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral
judgement would come, that from the faith of
it they might draw their comfort, <hi>which is a ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nifest
token of the righteous judgement of God,</hi>
saith he. 2. The most grown and praise-worthy
faith and patience are not so perfect, but they are
in hazard to be shaken and brangled by continued
trouble and tryal, and stand in need to be supported
<pb n="295" facs="tcp:61385:153"/>
by God and underpropped by such consolations as
the Lord hath stored up in his word, that they
faint not: for, notwithstanding he hath presently
shewn how much he had gloried in their faith
and patience, yet he seeth it necessary, for their
further support and comfort, to shew them that
their patient suffering was <hi>a manifest token of the
righteous judgement of God.</hi> 3. As that excellent
truth, concerning the day of Gods most righteous
judgement; doth hardly, and with great difficulty,
get credit, some being wholly unwilling, 2 <hi>Pet. 3.
3,</hi> 4. and others not able to believe it as they
gladly would; <hi>Mark</hi> 9. 24. So there is no truth
or article of our faith whereof more convincing
proofs and infallible demonstrations may be had
than of this, for not only hath the spirit of God
frequently and plainly asserted it, <hi>Joh.</hi> 5. 28, 29.
but also every particular injury which the Lords
people do suffer from men, and is not righted in
this life, is an infallible argument and cogent proof
that this day shall most undoubtedly come. So
that there are infinite proofs, because there are
infinite wrongs of that sort; <hi>which,</hi> saith he, <hi>is a
manifest token of the righteous judgement of God.</hi>
4. The comforts of the Lords people under their
saddest sufferings from men, are near at hand, if
their eyes were not sometimes shut that they
cannot see them, yea so nigh, that every cross
of that kind hath an excellent cordial of sweet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>est
comfort in its bosome, and the greater their
cross is, the sweeter is the comfort which is
brought along with it, and in it: for, he affirmeth
that their unjust sufferings, and their patience un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der
<pb n="296" facs="tcp:61385:154"/>
them, are so many <hi>tokens of the righteous
judgement of God.</hi> 5. The day of general judge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment,
and the remembrance of it, can prove com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fortable
only to such as may upon solid grounds
expect a favourable sentence on that day from
Christ the Judge; for, the comfort propounded
doth not lye wholly in this, that the righteous
judgement of God shall come, but also that the
event of it shall be good as to them; even <hi>that
ye may be counted worthy of the Kingdom of God,</hi>
saith he. 6. As none shall enjoy the Kingdom
of Heaven, but those whom God maketh fit and
meet for it, though not by making them to me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit
Heaven (for it is the gift of God, <hi>Rom. 6.
23.)</hi> yet by working in them all those gracious
qualifications, which are required in those, upon
whom he hath bound himself by gracious cove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant
and promise to bestow eternal happiness:
<hi>Col.</hi> 1. 12. with 13. 14. So the main business
of the day of Gods righteous judgement, at least
that piece of it wherein the comfort of believers
doth chiefly lye, shall be in the Lords judicial
accepting, and publick declaring that the perse<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cuted
Godly (whom wicked men did judge the
scum and off-scouring of the world, 1 <hi>Cor. 4.
13.)</hi> are worthy, fit and meet to reign with
him for ever. Which gracious acceptation of
his, though it be really past, <hi>Eph.</hi> 1. 6. and inti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mated
to their own consciences here on earth,
1 <hi>Joh.</hi> 3. 19. yet the publick manifestation of it,
in the view of Angels, devils and reprobates, is
reserved until that day, and shall be then per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formed;
for, he sheweth that the end and event
<pb n="297" facs="tcp:61385:154"/>
of the righteous judgement of God, is, that they
may be counted judicially accepted, and declared
<hi>worthy</hi> and meet for <hi>the Kingdom of God.</hi> Now
he accounteth and declareth none meet for it but
those who are made meet. 7. As the Kingdom
of Heaven and glory is worthy to be suffered for,
and will be so esteemed of by all them who shall
one day be counted worthy of it and meet for
it; So such ill will hath Satan that any should
enjoy that Kingdom which he himself hath irre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>coverably
lost, 2 <hi>Pet.</hi> 2. 4. and such is the ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tred
of wicked men, though not to Heaven it self,
yet, to the way of faith and obedience which lead<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth
to it, that there is none who entreth that way,
who may not expect the utmost of Satans and
wicked mens malice to pursue them in it, and that
mainly because they walk in that way, whatever
be those other pretexts which their persecutors
may hold out, 2 <hi>Tim.</hi> 2. 9. For, he affirms they
did suffer for the Kingdom of God, and makes
that an evidence that they shall be accounted meet
for it: <hi>for which ye also suffer,</hi> saith he.</p>
               <q>
                  <p>Ver. 6. Seeing it is a righteous thing with God to
recompence tribulation to them that trouble
you.</p>
                  <p>7. And to you who are troubled, rest with us—</p>
               </q>
               <p>He doth here prove that their patient suffering
of injuries from men was an infallible proof of the
righteous judgement of God, and that the event
thereof shall be such to Christian sufferers as he
hath presently affirmed; and that because it is <hi>a
<pb n="298" facs="tcp:61385:155"/>
righteous thing with God,</hi> or, a thing that his most
righteous nature did oblige him to, even to <hi>recom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pence</hi>
and repay trouble unto all such as did un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>justly
persecute and <hi>trouble them</hi> for righteousness
sake, <hi>v.</hi> 6. and to recompence and bestow <hi>rest</hi> from
all trouble and labour to those who are put to trou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble
and hardship by men for love to their duty;
and that <hi>with us,</hi> to wit, with the Apostles and
others; whereby he doth not only commend this
excellent rest unto them, as being a rest with such,
but doth also shew them that he did not now speak
of a thing uncertain, but what he had the faith of
as to his own particular. And whereas he saith
that Gods <hi>righteous</hi> nature doth no less bind him
to this than to the former, The meaning is not as
if this blessed rest had been merited by them, as
trouble and torment was by their persecutors,
<hi>Rom.</hi> 6. 23. but because Christ had merited this
rest for them, <hi>Rom.</hi> 3. 26. and God of free grace
had obliged himself to bestow this rest upon them,
<hi>Matth.</hi> 5. 11, 12. and therefore it is a righteous
thing with God to recompence it to them, as <hi>righ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teousness</hi>
is taken elsewhere for his faithfulness in
keeping promise, see <hi>Psal. 143. 1. 1 John</hi> 1. 9.
From all which he doth leave it unto them to ga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther,
that seeing this recompence was not given
now, but all things were almost contrary, there
could be no surer demonstration of a day coming
wherein the Lord in righteousness shall give it to the
full, which he doth here intend to prove. <hi>Doct.</hi> 1.
Whatever is righteous with God, and judged
so by him, shall undoubtedly come to pass, and
therefore though for the time truth may fall in the
<pb n="299" facs="tcp:61385:155"/>
streets, and equity cannot enter, <hi>Isa.</hi> 59. 14. yet
either now or afterwards judgement shall return
unto righteousness, and the cause which is account<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
righteous with God shall have the upper hand:
for, his scope is to prove that there shall be a day
of Gods righteous judgement, because it is a righte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous
thing with God that it should be so even to
<hi>recompence trouble,</hi> &amp;c. 2. It is the ordinary lot
of the Lords people, and a thing which the Lord
would have them undoubtedly to expect, to meet
with an unjust measure, and unrighteous sentence
from the judgement-seats of men, who do usually,
either through blindness of judgement, <hi>Act.</hi> 3. 17.
or perverseness of will, <hi>Zech.</hi> 7. 9. with 11. con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demn
the innocent and absolve the guilty; for,
while he saith that the rendering unto every man
his due is <hi>a righteous thing with God,</hi> he secretly
implyeth that the doing so much is not often
judged righteous by men. 3. The Lord alloweth
his persecuted people to comfort themselves under
their saddest sufferings from the faith of this, that
the Lord shall, either now or afterwards, one time
or other, reckon in wrath and strictest justice with
their obstinate and Godless persecutors. And
therefore the Lords people may and should com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fort
themselves, and rejoice in the approaching
ruine of their enemies, though not as it is their mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sery,
<hi>Job</hi> 31. 29. yet as the necessary result of
their ruine is Gods glory, <hi>Psal.</hi> 59. 13. and as it
shall be made thereby evident that God hath
owned the righteous quarrel for which the Godly
suffer, <hi>Psal.</hi> 58. 10, 11. and as their rest from
trouble shall necessarily go along with the ruine
<pb n="300" facs="tcp:61385:156"/>
of their enemies; For, in order to their comfort
under persecution, he doth mind them of that re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>compence
of trouble which was to come upon
their godless persecutors. <hi>Seeing it is a righteous
thing,</hi> saith he, <hi>to recompence trouble unto them
who trouble you.</hi> 4. Though some, who for the
present are most godless persecutors may after<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards
turn to God and obtain mercy, 1 <hi>Tim.</hi> 1. 13.
in which ca<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>e the stroke of divine justice, due to such,
hath lighted upon Christ the surety, <hi>Isa.</hi> 53. 5. Yet as
the most part of cruel persecutors do persist impe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nitent,
so the heaviest dint of divine vengeance shall
undoubtedly fall on such in the day of Gods most
righteous judgement; for, while he mentioneth
only persecutors, here, as those upon whom God
is bound in righteousness to execute judgement, he
implyeth that many of such shall dye without
mercy, and shall be most severely judged at the
last day: <hi>to recompence trouble unto them that trou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble
you,</hi> saith he. 5. The righteous judgement of
God may be seen, not only in his causing wrath
and vengeance to follow where sin hath gone be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore;
but also, and mainly, in the nature and kind
of those judgements which he doth inflict; in so
far, that, in some respects, they answer and are
suitable unto the sin for which they are inflicted,
so that wicked men may in their sin foresee their
stroke, and in their stroke may read the sin for
which they are stricken: <hi>Jude.</hi> 1. 7. For, he doth
make it <hi>a righteous thing with God,</hi> not only to
inflict judgement for sin upon the wicked, but also
such judgements as are most suitable to their sin,
even <hi>to recompence trouble unto them that trouble
<pb n="301" facs="tcp:61385:156"/>
you,</hi> saith he. 6. This present time is a time of
trouble, and not of rest, unto the people of God.
Their trouble is now, what from men, <hi>Mat.</hi> 10. 22.
what from devils, <hi>Eph.</hi> 6. 12. what from a body of
sin within them, <hi>Rom.</hi> 7. 24. what from their own
consciences, which, sometimes with ground, <hi>Psal.
32.</hi> 3. and sometime without ground, <hi>Psal.
88.</hi> 3. do vex and trouble them, and what from
God himself, <hi>Job.</hi> 6. 4. who doth not see a con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stant
rest here to be sitting for them, <hi>Psal.</hi> 55. 19.
But their rest in all these respects shall be after<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards:
For, while he saith, <hi>It is a righteous thing
with God</hi>—to give the Godly who are
troubled <hi>rest in the day of his righteous judgement,</hi>
he doth tacitly imply that they have not rest here.
7. The wisdom of God hath so contrived the way
of the elects salvation, as not only mercy in God,
but also his provoked justice, is satisfied with it,
yea and ingaged for it; So far will justice be from
standing in opposition to it; For, he saith, <hi>It is a
righteous thing with God to recompence—rest
unto you who are troubled.</hi> 8. It addeth much to
the excellency of that rest which remaineth unto
the people of God, that it shall not be enjoyed
by one alone, or some few only, but all the Saints,
from the most eminent unto the meanest, shall be
compartners in it, in so far as, though the glory of
all shall be derived immediately from God, 1 <hi>Cor.
15—28.</hi> yet the presence of all the glorified
Saints shall make their glory the more desirable,
and the joynt concurrence of them all in one and
the same song of praise to God and the Lamb,
<hi>Rev.</hi> 7. 9, 10. shall doubtless, by reason of the
<pb n="302" facs="tcp:61385:157"/>
concord and harmony flowing from it, make their
song the sweeter; for, he commendeth this excel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lent
rest from this, that the Apostles, Prophets,
and such eminent Saints as they should share with
them, and they with those in that rest: <hi>and to you
who are troubled rest with us,</hi> saith he.</p>

               <p>The Apostle doth here enter a second ground of
consolation, or rather enlarge and clear the former,
while he condescendeth upon the day wherein the

the day appointed for the last judgement; and
thence doth take occasion, for the greater comfort
of the persecuted Godly and terrour of their God<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>less
persecutors, to describe that day, first, from
the glorious manner of Christs coming to judge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment

ascended, <hi>Eph.</hi> 4. 10. Secondly, He shall come ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>companied
with a glorious train and re<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

<hi>thousand</hi> times ten thousands <hi>(Jude v. 14.)</hi> of the
blessed <hi>Angels,</hi> here called <hi>mighty,</hi> to shew that
they shall be fitted for their work wherein they
will be then employed, and, more particularly, to
<pb n="303" facs="tcp:61385:157"/>
gather the elect, <hi>Matth.</hi> 24. 31. and to execute his
terrible sentence against the reprobate, <hi>Matth.
13.</hi> 41. This is contained <hi>v.—7.</hi> Thirdly, he
shall come <hi>in flaming fire,</hi> by which the Heavens
and earth which now are, shall be dissolved and
burnt up, 2 <hi>Pet.</hi> 3. 10, 12. and damned reprobates
shall be tormented, <hi>Heb. 10. 27. Doct.</hi> 1. Though
the souls of believers are at death made perfect in
holiness, <hi>Heb. 12.—23.</hi> yet their happiness is
not then compleat, nor before the end of time in
the day of Gods righteous judgement; in so far
as their bodies shall lye dissolved in the grave un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>til
then, <hi>Job</hi> 19. 26, 27. and then being raised
in glory they shall be united unto their souls,
<hi>Joh.</hi> 5. 28, 29. and the whole man perfectly and
unchangeably blessed, 1 <hi>Thes.</hi> 4. 17, 18. The
Lord having so provided, that neither our fore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>runners
without us, nor we without our after<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>comers,
shall be compleatly glorified; but the
head-stone of glory being put upon all at once,
the glorifying of Christ in them, and of them in
Christ, may be the more solemn and glorious:
for, he sheweth that the recompence of rest will be
<hi>when the Lord Jesus shall be revealed,</hi> &amp;c. and not
until them. 2. It may contribute not a little to the
comfort and encouragement of Christian sufferers,
and the terrour of their Godless Persecutors, to
know not only that a day of general Judgement
shall be, but also that in that day the Lord Jesus
shall be Judge; even he, for whom the Godly
suffered, <hi>Act.</hi> 5. 41. who gave himself to death
that he might save them, <hi>Ephes.</hi> 5. 25, 26, 27.
who is their head, <hi>Ephes.</hi> 1. 22. their husband,
<pb n="304" facs="tcp:61385:158"/>
2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 11. 2. their dearest friend, <hi>Cant.</hi> 5. 16.
and therefore he cannot choose but pass a favou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rable
sentence on them; and it is he whom wicked
men despised, <hi>Isa.</hi> 53. 3. whose gracious offers
they rejected, <hi>Matth.</hi> 23. 37. whose servants,
friends and followers they set at nought and per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>secuted,
<hi>Gal.</hi> 4. 29. and therefore there can be
none whose terrible sentence they have more rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son
to fear than his: for, in order to the main
scope, which is to comfort the persecuted Godly,
and, as a mean subservient thereto, to terrifie
their Godless Persecutors, he sheweth that Christ
shall be the Judge. <hi>When the Lord Jesus shall be
revealed,</hi> &amp;c. saith he. 3. Though there be
much revealed, preached and m<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>de known of
Christ, 2 <hi>Tim.</hi> 4. 17. yet he remaineth obscure
and hid. The wicked do not know him at all,
as not believing the truth of what they hear con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerning
him, <hi>Isa.</hi> 53. 1. until they see it to their
own unspeakable sorrow and grief, <hi>Rev.</hi> 1. 7.
yea and even the Godly do but know in part,
1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 13. 9. and cannot comprehend, by faith
and at a distance, the hundredth part of that ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cellency
and beautiful glory which they shall find
him adorned with when they shall see him face to
face, 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 13. 12. Besides that his bodily pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sence
is, for the time, kept up from their eyes,
the curtain of the highest Heavens being inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>posed
betwixt them and that glorious sight. For,
while he saith, <hi>the Lord Jesus shall be then re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vealed,</hi>
it is implyed that until then he is in a
manner hid. 4. It may also contribute much to
the comfort of the Godly, and terrour of the
<pb n="305" facs="tcp:61385:158"/>
wicked, that Jesus Christ, the Judge, shall come,
not in a state of humiliation, as he did at the first,
when his divine glory was so much covered over
with the vail of humane (though sinless, <hi>Heb.
4. 15.)</hi> infirmities, that a natural eye could see
no beauty in him for which it should either de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sire
him or fear him; <hi>Isa.</hi> 53. 2. But he shall come
as an exalted King, accompanyed with a glorious
train of mighty Angels to execute what sentence
shall be passed; from whom as the Godly can
expect nothing but favourable dealing, as from
their dearest friends, their fellow servants, <hi>Rev.
22.</hi> 9. and those who are employed by Christ the
Judge to bring about the good of the Elect, and,
in a manner, to serve them while they are here
on earth, <hi>Heb.</hi> 1. 14. So the wicked can expect
nothing but the certain and summary execu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
of their dreadful sentence from those blessed
creatures, designed executioners for that very
thing, whom the damned reprobates cannot resist,
they are so mighty and strong, <hi>Psal.</hi> 103. 20.
nor flee from, they are so swift, <hi>Isa.</hi> 6. 2. nor
move with flattery and requests, they are so true
unto their trust; <hi>Psal.</hi> 103. 21. For, in order to
the comfort of the one and terrour of the other,
he sheweth how Christ shall come accompanied
with a glorious train of <hi>mighty Angels.</hi> 5. Even
those things which are in themselves most terrible,
and shall be so to Godless reprobates at Christs
second coming, have in them matter of comfort
and encouragement unto the Godly; and, in par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticular,
those very flames which shall put those
Heavens and Earth, which now are, all in a blaze,
<pb n="306" facs="tcp:61385:159"/>
and, consequently, shall prove a most terrible and
sadning sight unto the wicked, when all their de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lightsome
Idols are burnt up and destroyed before
their eyes, and that flame of fiery wrath then
kindled shall devour themselves unto all eternity;
even those terrible flames shall be a comfortable
sight unto the Godly, yea and the fore-thoughts of
them may and should yield comfort to them under
their present trouble, as knowing that the more
terrible that judgement is, which doth remain for
their adversaries, the more are they both in their
persons and cause, owned by the Lord, for clearing
whereof he will give such evident proofs of his
wrath against all who will not favour them as he
doth; for, in order to their comfort, he sheweth that
<hi>Jesus the Lord shall be revealed in—flaming fire.</hi>
               </p>
               <q>Ver.—8. Taking vengeance on them that
know not God, and that obey not the Gospel of
our Lord Jesus Christ.</q>
               <p>He describeth the day of Judgement, secondly,
from a twofold end of Christs coming on it, and
joyntly cleareth that two-fold retribution spoken
of <hi>v.</hi> 6, 7—The first end relateth to the
wicked; he <hi>shall come to take vengeance on them,</hi>
that is, to proceed against them, as a wrathful
judge, with all extremity, and without any mixture
of mercy, for <hi>vengeance</hi> signifieth a wrathful re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tribution
of evil; and those upon whom he shall
take vengeance are of two sorts, 1. All those, whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
Pagans or profest Christians, <hi>who know not
God,</hi> and are ignorant of what may, and is necessary
<pb n="307" facs="tcp:61385:159"/>
in order to salvation to be known of him. 2. All
those among Christians, who though they have
some knowledge of Gospel-truths, yet, do not
yield that subjection and obedience thereunto,
which is enjoyned by it; The greatness of which
sin of disobedience to the Gospel is hinted at in
this, that the Gospel is here called <hi>the Gospel of our
Lord Jesus Christ,</hi> that is, a doctrine which he
hath revealed, and which treateth of him, and the
way of acquiring a right unto him, and to life eter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal
through him. So that to slight and disobey
the Gospel is to slight Jesus Christ, with all the
good things purchased by him. <hi>Doct.</hi> 1. Men, by
living in their ignorance of God and disobedience
to the Gospel, do not only wrong themselves and
are indeed greatest enemies to their own mercies,
but do also injure the Lord, and what in them ly<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth
do put an affront upon him, as if the knowledge
of God were not worth the pains, and as if Christ
had put himself to unnecessary travel for purchasing
life and salvation to sinners, the offer whereof
they refused to accept and embrace; for, while he
saith, <hi>the Lord Christ will take vengeance on them
that know not God, and obey not the Gospel,</hi> it is
implyed that there is a wrong and injury offered to
God in their ignorance and disobedience, for
which he will avenge himself upon them. 2. As
Gods vindictive justice shall seize upon others be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sides
bloody persecutors, in the great day, even up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
all who know not God and obey not the Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>spel;
So it shall prove no comfort at all unto
damned reprobates that an innumerable multitude
shall be damned with them, but rather augment
<pb n="308" facs="tcp:61385:160"/>
their torment and horrour; for, he sheweth that
the Lord will take vengeance, not only upon avowed
persecutors, of whom he spoke before, <hi>v.</hi> 6. but
also upon all that <hi>know not God, and obey not the
Gospel,</hi> and this to increase terrour to those cruel
persecutors, who shall much less escape. 3. Though
there be a great difference betwixt Law and Gospel,
the former only commanding, the latter also hold<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
forth promised furniture and strength for en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>abling
us to obey, the former admitting of no less
than perfect obedience, <hi>Gal.</hi> 3. 10. and personal
satisfaction for our disobedience, <hi>Gen.</hi> 2. 17. the
latter accepting sincerity instead of perfection, <hi>Mat.
25.</hi> 21. and satisfaction by a cautioner instead of our
own, 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 5. 21. Yet there is no such difference
betwixt them as if the Law only did command and
the Gospel only promise. No, The Gospel hath
its own commands as well as the Law, yea com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mandeth
the same things which the Law command<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth,
with respect had to the forementioned diffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rences
and others of that kind; for, while he speak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth
of them <hi>that obey not the Gospel,</hi> it is implyed
that the Gospel doth command and enjoyn. 4. The
Lords will is not the only cause of the reprobates
condemnation, he condemneth none but for their
sin, and those whose ignorance and disobedience
have first procured their condemnation; so that
the very consciences of most Godless reprobates
shall be made to subscribe to their own condemna<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
as most equitable and just: for, he pointeth at
their ignorance and disobedience as cause of their
condemnation, while he saith, <hi>the Lord Christ will
take vengeance on them who know not God and obey
<pb n="309" facs="tcp:61385:160"/>
not the Gospel.</hi> 5. Suppose a man might know
very much, yea and obey the Law unto the utmost
of what his abilities can reach, yet if he do not
obey the Gospel, and, more especially, that great
command of the Gospel to believe and accept an
offered Saviour, 1 <hi>Job.</hi> 3. 23. he cannot be saved,
The least sin which ever he committed will be, in
that case, of it self sufficient to condemn him;
for, so much is clear, while it is said, <hi>Christ will
take vengeance on them who obey not the Gospel,</hi>
whatever be their knowledge, obedience or disobe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dience
otherwayes.</p>
               <q>Ver. 9. Who shall be punished with everlasting
destruction from the presence of the Lord, and

which shall be then inflicted upon the ig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>norant
and disobedient, first, from the kind of it,
it shall not be an ordinary loss, but a <hi>destruction</hi>

utter abolishing of their nature and being, as the
destruction of beasts is, but of their well-being and
joy, as the destruction of the fallen Angels was,

from the continuance of it. It s<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

the great loss which they shall sustain by this de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>struction.
They shall never behold the <hi>Lords</hi>
gracious <hi>presence</hi> but be banished from it unto all
<pb n="310" facs="tcp:61385:161"/>
eternity: or rather the efficient cause or mean of
this destruction is hereby pointed at, The very
presence of Christ the Judge shall torment them,
and his infinite <hi>glorious power</hi> drive them away, as
unworthy to stand in his sight, to the place of tor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
prepared for them, and shall perpetuate their
torment by upholding them in their being under it.
<hi>Doct.</hi> 1. Though there be degrees of torment
among the damned in Hell, <hi>Matth.</hi> 11. 22. yet
the pain and torment of all shall agree in those;
The total destruction of their well-being and joy,
the eternity of that destruction, and an utter
estrangement from any mixture of comfort, and
from Gods presence the fountain from whence
comfort doth flow; for, he saith, that, not only
avowed persecutors, but all the ignorant and diso<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bedient,
<hi>shall be punished with everlasting destru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction
from the presence of the Lord.</hi> 2. When the
ransom for sin payed by Christ is not embraced,
there is no remedy but the sinner himself must un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dergoe
the stroke of divine justice for those sins
which he hath committed; for, those who obey
not the Gospel by accepting an offered ransome
<hi>shall be punished with everlasting destruction.</hi>
3. As divine justice will never cease to pursue the
damned sinner until compleat satisfaction be given
for all his sins; So the wrong done against an in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>finite
God by sin is such, that damned sinners,
notwithstanding all the torture and torment both
in soul and body that they can endure, shall never
be able unto all eternity to satisfie for it: for, saith
he, <hi>they shall be punished with everlasting destructi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on,</hi>
Their debt will never be payed, and they shall not
<pb n="311" facs="tcp:61385:161"/>
come out of prison until they pay the uttermost far<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing,
<hi>Matth. 5. 26. Doct.</hi> 4. Though the consci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ences
of Godless reprobates are now, for the most
part, dead and seared, <hi>Eph.</hi> 4. 19. yet when Christ
the Judge shall come to reckon with them, their
consciences shall be so vigorous, quick and lively,
that being convicted and condemned by their own
consciences already, they shall not endure to be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hold
the presence of Christ the Judge; for, the very
presence of Christ the Judge shall torment them,
which could not be, if their own consciences did
not convince them and powerfully check them for
their many by-past injuries done to him. <hi>They
shall be punished from the presence of the Lord,</hi>
saith he. 5. Though the sentence pronounced
against wicked men by their own consciences now
is not presently executed, and so the less feared by
them, <hi>Eccles.</hi> 8. 11. yet no sooner shall they pass
sentence in the great day, or rather second the
sentence which will be passed against them by
Christ the Judge, but presently and without delay
the glorious power of their Judge, by the Ministry
of his mighty Angels, will cause the sentence quick<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
and without the least reprive be put in execution;
so that in all probability there shall be no long pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cess,
but a quick and suddain dispatch: for, no
sooner shall Christs presence, meeting with their
self-condemning consciences, begin to torment
them, but as soon his glorious power shall be em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ployed
to accomplish and continue their torment.
<hi>They shall be punished—from the presence
of the Lord and from his glorious power,</hi> to wit,

and body, <hi>Phil. 3. 21.)</hi> as he himself shall be
thereby glorified: not only shall the glorified
Saints themselves give glory to him, but the glory
of his mercy, power, goodness and other attri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>butes
shall, in their glory, be made manifest unto
all the world, upon occasion whereof the glorified
Angels also shall glorifie him. The Apostle adds
that Christ the Judge shall also be <hi>admired in them,</hi>
that is, shall put such glory on them as never was
expected, neither by themselves or others, <hi>Isa.
64.</hi> 4. and therefore it shall be admired by all
beholders, and the mercy, power and grace of
Christ, the bestower, shall be admired and won<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dered
at much more. Only the Apostle having
first, as it were at the by and in a parenthesis, applyed
this general ground of consolation to them in par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticular,
by giving a reason for his so doing, to wit,
<hi>because they had believed</hi> and given credit unto
<pb n="313" facs="tcp:61385:162"/>
the doctrine of the Gospel, to the truth whereof he
and his associates had given testimony, he doth, in
the end of the verse again repeat the time when
this shall be, to wit, in that day of Christs second
coming, and not until then, hereby to put a stop to
their precipitancy in hastening too much after it.
<hi>Doct.</hi> 1. Jesus Christ the Judge shall not be so
much transported with rage and fury against the
wicked, in the day of general judgement, as to make
him forget his tender mercies unto the Godly; he
knoweth how to make the same day the greatest
for terrour unto his foes, and yet the greatest for
Joy unto his friends; for, <hi>Paul</hi> sheweth that he
shall take vengeance upon the one, and be glorified
in the other, both in one day; <hi>when he shall come
to be glorified in his saints.</hi> Yea, 2. The great
errand of Christs coming to general Judgement is
not so much to render vengeance unto the wicked,
as to glorifie and save the Godly, the former being
in some respect but as a mean to set forth the glory
and solemnity of the latter, <hi>Rom.</hi> 9. 22, 23. for
looking narrowly to the Text, we find that Christ
doth take vengeance as it were but in the by, when
he shall come, as it were of purpose, to put glory
on his people. <hi>Taking vengeance on them that
know not God,</hi> saith he, v. 8. <hi>when he shall come to
be glorified in his Saints.</hi> 3. The rest remaining
to the now afflicted and troubled people of God is
a glorious rest, and therefore not a total cessation
from all action and duty, as lifeless stones, (that rest
should have no glory in it,) but from the sin, infir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mities
and misery with which they are encompassed
and attended now in the way of duty, and from all
<pb n="314" facs="tcp:61385:163"/>
such duty as implyeth any want or imperfection in
the performer; otherwise their rest were not com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pleatly
glorious; for, <hi>Paul</hi> exponing and clearing
the rest which was promised, <hi>v.</hi> 7. saith, <hi>he shall
come to be glorified in his saints.</hi> 4. Though the
glory of Christ the Judge will be ser forth, to the
admiration of all beholders, in the pouring forth of
his wrath and vengeance upon Godless reprobates,
his proud and obstinate enemies; yet his glory will
be incomparably more and more admired in his
putting glory upon the Elect, in so far as the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>probate
shall receive but what they deserve, but
as for the Elect, besides the wonderful change
which shall be wrought in them, the glory put up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
them shall be without, yea and contrary to their
deserving; for, <hi>Paul</hi> saith, <hi>he shall come to be glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rified
and admired in his saints,</hi> as if his glory to
be had in judging reprobates were no glory being
compared with that. 5. There is such a necessary
connexion betwixt the glory of Christ, and the
glory wherewith the Elect shall be glorified in
Heaven, that the former is the result of the latter.
Christ the head is glorified in that glory which he
himself hath procured for, 2 <hi>Tim.</hi> 1. 10. and shall
bestow upon his members, 2 <hi>Tim.</hi> 4. 8. and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
we neither need nor should separate Gods
glory from our own salvation, but are to seek the
latter jointly with, and in subordination to the for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer;
for, <hi>Paul</hi> sheweth that Christ shall be glori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fied
in their glory. <hi>When he shall come to be glori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fied
in his saints.</hi> 6. Though there be much fore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>told
in Scripture of the glory which shall be put
upon the Lords people in the last day, 1 <hi>Joh.</hi> 3. 2.
<pb n="315" facs="tcp:61385:163"/>
yet that which is revealed to that purpose is so
little believed, <hi>Mark</hi> 9. 24. and cometh so far
short of that height of glory wherewith they shall
be then adorned and crowned, that Heaven and
happiness shall be a far other thing than ever en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tered
in the heart, not only of natural men, but also
of the Godly themselves, to think upon: for,
therefore the first sight of it shall strike them with
admiration, as at a thing beyond their expectation
and hope, <hi>he shall come to be admired,</hi> saith he.
7. As Heaven and glory shall be enjoyed only by
believers and Saints; So all those are Saints who
are believers, and all are believers who are saints;
there being an inseparable connexion betwixt sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving
faith and inherent holiness, as betwixt a ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cessary
cause and the effect which floweth from it:
for, he putteth the saints and them that believe the
one for the other, and sheweth that glory is the por<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
of such only; <hi>to be glorified in his saints, and
admired in all them that believe.</hi> 8. Though
there be degrees of glory in Heaven, <hi>Dan.</hi> 12. 3.
yet the meanest believer shall enjoy so much, as
the most enlarged heart cannot once imagine or
comprehend while we are here; for, <hi>Paul</hi> saith,
<hi>he will be admired in all them that believe,</hi> even
the meanest believer not excepted. 9. Our
choicest comforts, while we are here on earth,
consist in those things which we have not in hand,
but shall enjoy hereafter; and therefore the more
we exercise our faith and patience, our comforts
will prove the more satisfying and lively: for,
he shews that the great and good things, which
are here spoken of in order to their comfort, shall
<pb n="316" facs="tcp:61385:164"/>
not be performed before the last day, <hi>to be admi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red,</hi>
saith he, <hi>in all them that believe—in that
day.</hi> 10. We are not bound to believe any other
doctrine, as necessary to salvation, but that where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of
it can be made out convincingly that the Apostles
and other penmen of holy Scripture, directed in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fallibly
by the spirit, have given testimony unto;
for, saith he, <hi>our testimony was believed among
you.</hi> 11. As it is the duty of Christs Ministers to
make application of general promises unto the par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticular
case of the Lords people to whom they are
sent; So they should carefully guard lest they apply
those promises unto any, but such as are so quali<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fied
as the promise doth require; otherwise, they
speak peace to whom the Lord doth not speak peace;
for, the Apostle applyeth the general comfort unto
them in particular, having found them endued with
faith, that necessary qualification which is required
in the person to whom the promise doth belong,
<hi>because our testimony was believed among you,</hi>
saith he.</p>
               <q>Ver. 11. Wherefore also we pray alwayes for you,
that our God would count you worthy of this
calling, and fulfil all the good pleasure of his
goodness, and the work of faith with power.</q>
               <p>In this and the following verse is contained a
fourth ground of consolation for them under their
present sufferings, the summ whereof is, that he
and his associates did earnestly pray to God on their
behalf, where (besides the act of <hi>praying,</hi> and
praying for them <hi>alwayes,</hi> of which, see upon
<pb n="317" facs="tcp:61385:164"/>
1 <hi>Thes. 5. 17.)</hi> there is, first, the occasion of their
prayer pointed at in the word <hi>wherefore,</hi> or, for
this cause, which relateth to the foregoing pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pose,
to wit, because Christ was to come to be glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rified
in believers, and because they in particular
were believers, therefore he and his associates did
pray for them. Next, there are the things prayed
for; first, <hi>That God,</hi> whom he appropriates to
himself as his God by Covenant, <hi>would count them
worthy,</hi> or, judge them fit and meet (see upon
<hi>v. 5.) for this calling,</hi> that is, to enjoy that glory
unto which they are called; for they were called
already, and therefore <hi>calling</hi> here must not be
taken for Gods act in calling them, but for that
unto which they were called, even the Kingdom
of God, spoken of <hi>v.</hi> 5. Next, That, in order to
this, God would <hi>fulfil,</hi> or fully perform and ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>complish,
<hi>his good pleasure</hi> concerning them, that
is, his eternal purpose of election, called usually
by the name of <hi>good pleasure,</hi> Ephes. 1. 5, 9. and
<hi>all his good pleasure,</hi> that is, all things which he
had purposed in that decree to bring about for
them, even salvation and all things pre-required to
it. And it is called the good pleasure <hi>of his good<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness,</hi>
to shew that nothing but his own goodness,
and propenseness to communicate good from him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>self
to others, was the cause and motive of that de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cree.
See <hi>Eph. 1. v. 4. doct.</hi> 7. Thirdly, That
the Lord by his own omnipotent <hi>power</hi> would ful<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fil,
and, by fulfilling, preserve, actuate, increase,
and fortifie the <hi>work of faith</hi> in them, or, the
grace of saving faith with all its gracious effects,
the saving graces of Gods Spirit. <hi>Doct.</hi> 1. As it
<pb n="318" facs="tcp:61385:165"/>
is our duty, in the constant course of our prayers
to God, to mind the case of others, and especially
of those who suffer for truth, because their tentati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons
to fall are strong, 2 <hi>Tim.</hi> 4. 6, 10, 14, 15. and
the glory of God and edification of the Church
are in a singular manner concerned in their stand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing,
2 <hi>Tim.</hi> 2. 10. So it is a choice ground for
comfort and encouragement unto suffering Christi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans,
to know they have the prayers and best wishes
of those who are dear to God, sent up to the
throne of grace daily for them. The effectual
fervent prayer of a righteous man availeth much;
<hi>Jam. 5.—16.</hi> for, <hi>Paul</hi> did pray alwayes
for those suffering <hi>Thessalonians,</hi> and doth let
them know so much for their encouragement,
<hi>wherefore also we pray alwayes for you.</hi> 2. As it
is the duty of Pastors to pray to God for th<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap> Lords
people, as well as it is to preach unto them; So
the more a people do thrive in grace by a Mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sters
pains, and the more ground of confidence is
afforded to him by their carriage that it shall be
eternally well with them, the more will his encou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ragement
be, and his engagements the deeper, to
pray to God for them: A stubborn and graceless
people do prove a dead and heartless weight for
a Minister to stand under, and to lift at before the
Lord: for, <hi>Paul</hi> did alwayes pray for this people,
and was encouraged thereto from their growth in
grace, formerly mentioned, and more especially
from the evidence he had of their eternal well-be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing,
in their believing his testimony mentioned
<hi>v.—10.</hi> and related unto here in the causal
particle <hi>wherefore. Wherefore also we pray al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wayes
<pb n="319" facs="tcp:61385:165"/>
for you.</hi> 3. It is the duty of those who
have gotten their interest in God made clear, to im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prove
their interest in him and familiarity with
him for the behove, not of themselves alone, but
of others also. This being the only way to recom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pence
the tender bowels of others to them, who
employed their power with God for their behove,
when possibly they themselves were strangers to
him: for, <hi>Paul</hi> improveth his interest in God for
them, while, in praying to God on their behalf,
he calleth him <hi>his God that our God,</hi> saith he,
<hi>would count you worthy.</hi> 4. As none are worthy,
fit, or meet, for Heaven, but those whom the Lord
hath drawn out of nature to the state of grace in
their effectual calling, seeing no unclean thing can
enter there; <hi>Rev.</hi> 21. 27. So there is nothing in
us, either before or after our effectual calling,
which makes us worthy of Heaven, or meet for it
by way of merit, but all our fitness and worth of
that kind doth come from Gods gracious accepta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion,
his vouchsafing and accounting of us as such;
for if we were worthy of Heaven, by our own me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit,
to what end doth he pray to God that he <hi>would
count them worthy</hi> of it? and he expresseth Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven
by the name of <hi>calling,</hi> to shew that none but
called ones are worthy of it, and fit for it. 5. As
none shall be accounted and declared worthy in the
last day to enter the joyes of Heaven, but those
whom God by his eternal decree, and good plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sure
hath appointed for it; So the Lord in that his
eternal decree hath not appointed Heaven for any,
but those whom he hath appointed also in the same
decree to make meet for it: for, the connexion of
<pb n="320" facs="tcp:61385:166"/>
the two first petitions teacheth, both that Gods
good pleasure and decree is anterior to their be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
accounted worthy, and that Gods good plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sure
is fulfilled and executed in Gods counting
them meet and worthy, and consequently in his
making them so. <hi>And fulfil all the good pleasure
of his goodness.</hi> 6. As this eternal decree of ele<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction
is extended unto more things than one, even to
the salvation of the elect, and all the means tending to
it; So it is in all respects fully free, and had its rise
not from any <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>oreseen goodness in us, but from the
meer good will and goodness of God; for, there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
doth he call it <hi>all the good pleasure of his good<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness.</hi>
7. As God doth not accomplish all the
good pleasure o<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap> his goodness unto the elect at
once, but by degrees and measures until it be fully
accomplished in glory; <hi>Matth.</hi> 25. 34. So though
no endeavours of ours could have any influence on
God for moving him to enact such a gracious de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cree
in our favours, <hi>Rom.</hi> 9. 11. yet they may pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>move
the execution of it; And, especially, fervent
prayer is a mean appointed by God for furthering
this decree to its full accomplishment: for, the
Apostle, by praying unto God that <hi>he would ful<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fil
all the good pleasure of his goodness,</hi> doth inti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mate
the usefulness of prayer in order to that end.
8. As it is the grace of faith, with all its gracious
effects, which in Gods account doth fit a man for
Heaven; So faith, and all the graces of Gods spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit
flowing from it, were resolved on by God in
that eternal decree of election to be bestowed upon
the elect. And therefore foreseen faith did no wayes
move the Lord to elect any, or one more than ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther;
<pb n="321" facs="tcp:61385:166"/>
for, the Apostle, condescending upon the mean
how they may be accounted, and consequently
made, worthy by God, intreateth him to fulfil the
work of faith in them, and maketh this a piece of
Gods good pleasure of his goodness towards them.
<hi>and fulfil—the work of faith,</hi> saith he. 9. As
the grace of faith admits of degrees, and every
degree of faith is Gods work; So the carrying on
of the work of faith, especially in suffering times,
from one degree to another, is a task of such diffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culty,
and meeteth with such opposition from men,
from devils, from within a mans self, <hi>Luke 22.
31,</hi> 32. that it is not only Gods work, but his
wonderful work, a work which calleth for omnipo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tent
power, to the working of it: for, he prayeth
that <hi>God may fulfil,</hi> or carry on by degrees to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards
perfection, <hi>the work of faith with power.</hi>
               </p>
               <q>Ver. 12. That the name of our Lord Jesus Christ
may be glorified in you, and ye in him, according
to the grace of our God, and the Lord Jesus
Christ.</q>
               <p>Here is a third thing in this prayer, the end pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>posed
to be brought about by it, or by the good
things sought after in it, to wit, that <hi>Christs name,</hi>
or himself with all his glorious attributes, <hi>might be
glorified in them,</hi> that is, acknowledged and set
forth as praise-worthy and glorious by them, both
in word and work; and that not only in this life,
but also, and mainly, in that which is to come, see
<hi>v.</hi> 10. and <hi>that they might be glorified in him,</hi> that
is, the glory put upon him by them might reflect
<pb n="322" facs="tcp:61385:167"/>
upon themselves again, and so the more they glori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fied
him, they might the more be glorified by him.
But lest they might take matter of boasting hence,
as if their glorifying of Christ did merit glory
from him to them, he ascribeth all, even that glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry
of theirs, which had its rise from their glori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fying
him, not to any merit of theirs, but to <hi>Gods</hi>
free <hi>grace</hi> and favour in <hi>Christ. Doct.</hi> 1. A
Christians great design and chief end, which he
ought to propose unto himself in all his actions, is
the glory of God in Christ, and that his praise<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>worthy
attributes of mercy, love, wisdom, justice,
<hi>&amp;c.</hi> as they are glorious in themselves, so they
may be acknowledged for such by us, and by others
also, so far as in us lyeth; for, the great end of
<hi>Pauls</hi> prayers, and that which he would have them
propose to themselves in all their actions, is, <hi>that
the name of the Lord Jesus may be glorified in them.</hi>
2. As the more we set our selves to glorifie Christ,
the more of glory will thereby accrease unto our
selves; So we are neither to expect that Christ
will glorifie us, but in and by our glorifying him,
nor yet to account that any true glory or credit
to us, but what resulteth from our putting of glory
one way or other upon him: for, he maketh
Christs glorifying us the result of our glorifying
him, <hi>That the name of our Lord Jesus may be glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rified
in you, and ye in him.</hi> 3. Grace is the only
way to glory, and the glorifying of Christ in us,
and of us in him, is the necessary result of Christs
carrying on the work of grace in us according to
the good pleasure of his goodness towards perfe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction.
And whatever we be otherwayes, if this
<pb n="323" facs="tcp:61385:167"/>
be wanting, we are dishonourable to Christ, and
acquire nothing but shame and disgrace unto our
selves; for, he maketh Gods fulfilling the good
pleasure of his goodness in the work of faith, the
mean both of Christs glory and theirs, <hi>That the
name of the Lord Jesus may be glorified,</hi> &amp;c.
4. That any thing in us doth glorifie Christ, or
that any glory doth accrease unto us by our glorify<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
him, is not to be imputed to the worth or merit
of our works, in the best whereof, if the Lord
should straitly mark iniquity, there would be found
matter of dishonour unto God and of shame unto
our selves, <hi>Isa.</hi> 64. 6. but it floweth wholly from
Gods free grace and favour, which covereth the
imperfection of our work, <hi>Eph. 4.—32.</hi> and ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cepteth
of what is right in it as service to himself,
<hi>Eph.</hi> 1. 6. For, so much doth he teach, while he
saith, <hi>according to the grace of our God.</hi> 5. That
Jesus Christ is true God appeareth from this, that
not only the title of true God may be looked upon
here as ascribed unto him, see <hi>Joh.</hi> 5. 20. but also
that from his grace and favour all our glory here
and hereafter doth flow, and that he is the absolute
Lord and dispenser of it; <hi>according to the grace of
our God, and the Lord Jesus Christ.</hi>

and partake of that glory, which the elect being
gathered together shall receive from him then,
1 <hi>Thes. 4<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>—17.</hi> so they would obey the pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sent
exhortation, and keep themselves at a distance
from the following errour. <hi>Doct.</hi> 1. The spirit of
errour is so far from being banished and put to si<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lence
by the Churches afflictions and weighty suf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferings,
that it sometimes takes occasion from those
to rage the more among a people, who being wea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ried
with the cross, have oft an open ear to receive
whatsoever it is, whether truth or errour, which
promiseth most of present ease, and of a speedy de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>livery
from their present strait: for, though this
Church was presently under a suffering lot, <hi>chap.
1.</hi> 4. yet this errour, which did maintain that
Christ was presently to come and put an end to
trouble at the last day of judgement, did spread
fast among them, hence <hi>Paul</hi> doth seriously exhort
them to guard against it. <hi>Now we beseech you,
brethren.</hi> 2. The Ministers of Christ ought so to
propound the sweet and ravishing consolations of
the Gospel to an afflicted people, as they do not
omit to press such duties on them as their afflicted
state calleth for, or to tax them for yielding in the
least to such tentations as Satan takes advantage
from their affliction to assault them with; and that
<pb n="327" facs="tcp:61385:169"/>
because untenderness of this kind doth hinder the
most sweet and powerful consolations of the Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>spel
to work and take effect, <hi>Jer.</hi> 42. 10, 11. with
44. 15, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> for, <hi>Paul,</hi> having comforted this af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flicted
Church, <hi>chap.</hi> 1. doth now exhort them to
duty, and indirectly tax them for their being so
soon taken with the present plausible errour. <hi>Now
we beseech you brethren.</hi> 3. The Minister of
Christ, as he ought to entertain love betwixt him
and the people of his charge, and for that end to
deal affectionately with them at all times: So
chiefly when he hath to do with those who are ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
tainted, or in hazard to be tainted, with er<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rour,
especially so long as they are not incorrigible
in their errour; and that because a spirit of pride
doth usually accompany a spirit of errour, so that
the person tainted with it can hardly endure to
be contradicted, <hi>Gal.</hi> 4. 16. if he be not convin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ced
that he who contradicts his errours, doth love
his person, and dealeth affectionately with him:
for, therefore, while <hi>Paul</hi> is about to meddle with
their errour, he dealeth most affectionately with
them. <hi>Now we beseech you brethren.</hi> But 4. The
Lords Minister ought not (under pretence of ten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der
and affectionate dealing with those who are
tainted with errour) to speak against their errours
coldryfly, as if it were a thing indifferent whether
they returned to a right mind or not, but (as he
would be faithful to God, <hi>Gal.</hi> 1. 10. and the souls
of people, 2 <hi>Cor. 11. 3.)</hi> he must deal seriously
with them, set their hazard before them, and ear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nestly
obtest them, by that which is dearest to
them, to quit their errour and embrace the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary
<pb n="328" facs="tcp:61385:170"/>
truth; for, thus doth <hi>Paul beseech</hi> and in a
kind adjure them <hi>by the coming of our Lord Jesus
Christ and our gathering together unto him.</hi>
5. Errour about a truth, or any circumstance of it
doth (in so far, at least) hinder or endanger the
good and comfort, which might be otherwise reap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
by it: for, while <hi>Paul</hi> obtests them, that, as
they looked for comfort at Christs second coming,
so they would beware of that errour which did
antedate the time of it, it is implyed that their em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bracing
of that errour would in some respect hin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der,
or at least hazard the comfort which they
might have by the faith of that day. <hi>We beseech
you,</hi> saith he, <hi>by the coming of our Lord Jesus
Christ.</hi> 6. As Christ will certainly come to judge
the world, and all believers shall be gathered to
him, as Eagles do resort unto the Carcase, <hi>Matth.
24.</hi> 28. so we ought to entertain thoughts of
that day with a kind of religious awe and reve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rence,
to wit, so as we do not mock at it,
2 <hi>Pet.</hi> 3. 4. but that (certainly believing it will
be) we order all our deportment as we may
prepare and make ready for it, 2 <hi>Pet. 3. 11,
12.</hi> for, he adjures and obtests them <hi>by the
coming of our Lord Jesus Christ, and our gather<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
together unto him,</hi> now we use not to obtest
but by such things which are most certain, and to
which we owe a kind of religious respect and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verence.
7. Then is the day of Christs second
coming desirable and precious to us, and thought
upon as it ought by us, when, having made ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quaintance
and friendship with Christ our Judge,
we have ground of confidence that he will not be
<pb n="329" facs="tcp:61385:170"/>
terrible but friendly to us in that day, otherwise a
man can never think upon it with love, desire and
religious reverence, but will abhor the very
thoughts of it; for, as this obtestation implyeth
this day to have been desirable unto them and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verently
thought upon by them, so <hi>Paul</hi> doth shew
from what this did flow, even their interest in
Christ the Judge as theirs, and the hope of their
being gathered together among the rest of the elect
unto him then, while he saith, <hi>by the coming of
our Lord Jesus Christ, and our gathering together
unto him;</hi> he calleth Christ <hi>our Lord,</hi> and the ga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thering,
<hi>our gathering.</hi>
               </p>
               <q>Ver. 2. That ye be not soon shaken in mind, or
be troubled, neither by spirit, nor by word, nor
by letter, as from us, as that the day of Christ
is at hand.</q>
               <p>The Apostle in this verse doth, first, set forth,
in general, that from which he doth disswade them,
to wit, 1. That they would not be soon shaken or
suffer themselves to be tossed to and fro like the
waves of the Sea (as the word signifieth) by the
winds of false doctrine <hi>in</hi> or from their mind, that
is, from their received opinion and judgement con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerning
the truth in hand (as the word is rendred,
1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 2. 16. and 11. 10.) or from the right
use of their wit and reason, the loss of which he
doth hereby insinuate would be the sad fruit of
embracing the present errour; and, 2. That they
would not be troubled, or suffer themselves to be
perplexed, vexed and affrighted with the dreadful
<pb n="330" facs="tcp:61385:171"/>
representation of approaching judgement, by which,
it is like, the promoters of this errour did unces<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>santly
alarm and affright them, for the word is a
metaphor taken from souldiers affrighted with a
sudden and dreadful alarm. Next, he condescends
upon a threefold deceit which the maintainers of
this errour did make use of to seduce and unsettle
them, which he exhorts them to vilipend as being
of no weight: first, they pretended to the spirit,
whereby (as it is contradistinguished to the other
two) must be meant some immediate revelations
which they did falsly give out themselves to have
had from the spirit of God, <hi>Micah</hi> 2. 11. next, to
some unwritten <hi>word</hi> which, as it seemeth, they
did falsly alledge had been spoken by <hi>Paul</hi> or
some other Apostle to that purpose, 3. To some
Epistle written by <hi>Paul</hi> himself, and this, either
the former written to this same Church which it
seemeth they did wrest to countenance the present
errour, as if he had taught 1 <hi>Thes.</hi> 4. 15. that
Christ would come to judgement in that present
age, or some other Epistle forged by them and fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thered
upon the Apostle, which hath not been un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>usual
even then, as appears from his great care to
subscribe every Epistle with his own hand for pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venting
such impostures, <hi>chap.</hi> 3. 17. Lastly, he
expresseth the particular errour from embracing
whereof he doth so affectionately and seriously
disswade them, to wit, that <hi>the day of Christ,</hi> or
of Christs second coming, <hi>was at hand.</hi> The word
in the Original doth differ from that which is 1 <hi>Pet.
4.</hi> 7. and expresseth so much, as if the day of
judgement had been <hi>instantly</hi> to fall out in that
<pb n="331" facs="tcp:61385:171"/>
very age, which doubtless was the opinion vented
by those seducers and refuted here by <hi>Paul.</hi> But
the word used by <hi>Peter,</hi> expresseth only that it was
drawing near, and in what sense he would be un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derstood
is explained by himself, 2 <hi>Pet.</hi> 3. 8, 9. to
wit, in respect of God, with whom one day is as a
thousand years, and a thousand years as one day.
However <hi>Peter</hi> doth not condescend upon any pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>remptory
time, neither day, year, nor the present
age, as those seducers did. <hi>Doct.</hi> 1. The spirit of
errour is usually most prevalent and taking with
people, when it is first hatched and publickly vent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed.
The newness of the thing, the fair pretexts
wherewith it is coloured, and peoples inadvertence
to what it tendeth, make many without deliberation
engage in it, and being once engaged to stand to it:
and therefore if the first assault of errour were
once withstood, and time and leisure taken to ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vise
upon it, before we did indeliberately and sud<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>denly
close with it, there should not be so much
hazard, at least of being carryed away with it;
for, he beseecheth them that they be not <hi>soon sha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken,</hi>
not as if he did allow them to be shaken, pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vided
it were not soon, but because if they did
endure the first brunt, and were not soon shaken
they would readily not be shaken at all. 2. As a
sudden rash and unadvised engaging in the way of
errour is usually accompanied with a spiritual
phrensie and madness, and transporteth men beyond
the bounds of right reason, both in the defence and
propagation of their errour (however they may
be abundantly rational in their other actings, 2 <hi>Cor.
9.</hi> 2. with 11. 20.) So an unsound and unsetled
<pb n="332" facs="tcp:61385:172"/>
judgement in the point of truth, is usually accom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>panied
with errour and disturbance, of the consci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence,
through fears and doubts. And it is the de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vilish
method of Satans instruments, in seducing
the Lords people, once to unsettle their minds, and
preplex their consciences thus: that they may here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by
make them more plyable to embrace their er<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>roneous
doctrine, if so it but seem to promise any
ease of mind and peace; for, while he disswades
them from errour, he forbids them to be <hi>soon shaken
in mind, or troubled,</hi> the latter as a consequence of
the former, and both of them intended by their se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ducers,
as tending to make them more plyable to
their design. 3. The fore-mentioned dreadful
concomitants of errour, to wit, infatuation of mind,
perplexedness of heart and affections, the rack and
horrour of conscience, should scare the Lords peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple
from medling with, and make them stand aloof
from, any thing which tendeth towards it; for, the
general part of the disswasive hath an implicit rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son
to inforce their standing aback from the parti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cular
errour, even because thereby <hi>they would be
shaken in mind and troubled.</hi> 4. As there is not any
errour vented the maintainers whereof will not
have somewhat to say in its defence; So the taking
force of all they say for that end consisteth not in the
solidity and truth of what they affirm, but in multi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tude
of words, variety of seeming reasons, a fair flou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rish
of specious pretexts, and in impudent, bold and
strong assertions, thereby holding up their reputation
among their devoted followers, <hi>Act.</hi> 8. 9, 10. and en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>snaring
the simple who hardly can put a difference
betwixt pretext and reality, confident assertions and
<pb n="333" facs="tcp:61385:172"/>
solid proofs; <hi>Rom. 16—18.</hi> for, the maintainers of
this errour did boldly alledge no fewer than three
heads of most specious reasons, none whereof did
prove the truth of their opinion, and therefore he
forbids them to be shaken or troubled with any of
them, <hi>neither by spirit, nor by word, nor by letter
as from us.</hi> 5. Perverse and obstinate seducers
do often prove in end blasphemous and very Athe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ists,
in so far as (against the light of conscience)
to dare to father their groundless untruths upon
an immediate revelation from the God of truth;
for, those seducers pretended to immediate reve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lations
from the spirit to confirm their errour,
wherein they could not but know themselves to be
lyars. <hi>Neither by spirit,</hi> saith he. 6. As he<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>retical
spirits do usually prove most malapert and
impudent in opposing themselves to most convin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cing
evidences, if it were to outface an immediate<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
inspired Apostle: So they are most untender of,
and labour to trample upon the reputation of all
who do oppose them, though they be deservedly
eminent, for their graces, gifts and station; for,
those seducers do not only oppose themselves to
<hi>Paul</hi> an Apostle, but also, because of his opposition
to them, labour to disgrace him, while they al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge
he did contradict himself, and that they had
a word spoken by him asserting that opinion for
truth, which he did now condemn, which is im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plyed
while he saith, <hi>be not troubled by word, as
from us.</hi> 7. Heretical spirits and seducers do also
often prove most irreligious, as choosing to shake
the foundation of all religion, the authority of Scri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pture,
by making one part thereof contradict ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther,
<pb n="334" facs="tcp:61385:173"/>
rather than they should have nothing to say
for their own credit, and to defend their errour:
for, it is implyed that in this debate they opposed
letter to letter, and Scripture to Scripture. <hi>Nor
by letter as from us,</hi> saith he. 8. Satan's malice
and man's impudence<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> did come to that height, as
to endeavour the corrupting of Scripture by wrest<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
some parts of it from its genuine sense and
meaning, and by forging false Scriptures, and giv<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
them out for true, even while the Apostles
themselves were alive to contradict them. Which
serveth to commend the watchful providence of
God over Scripture, and his mercy towards us, in
so far as all the attempts of Satan for that end
have been hitherto frustrate, and the holy Scri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ptures
transmitted pure and incorrupt from hand
to hand through all generations to this present
age: for, the <hi>letter</hi> here mentioned was either
<hi>Pauls</hi> former Epistle wrested; or a new one forged<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
                  <hi>Nor by letter as from us.</hi> 9. It often falleth out
that those errours do prove most pestilent, and of
dangerous consequence, which have the greatest
shew of piety, and carry with them the least fear
of hazard from them at the firs view; for, this
errour, that the day of Christ was instantly to fall
out, might seem not only an harmless opinion, but
also most useful for putting men to their duty in
order to their preparation for that day; yet the
Apostle, by this most serious disswasive from it,
doth imply that it was an errour extreamly ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zardous;
and indeed so it was, for if this opinion
had been once received, the truth of Christian Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion,
and chiefly of this particular, should have
<pb n="335" facs="tcp:61385:173"/>
been exposed to contempt and scorn in the follow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
age, when the event would have fallen out
otherwise than this opinion held forth, which
doubtless was Satans great design in fostering it
so much. <hi>As that the day of Christ is at hand,</hi> saith
he. 10. So subtle is Satan, that he can, and some<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times
doth, make one errour spring out of the ru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ines
of another, yea and the latter errour to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>solve
in end in the re-establishing of the former,
though in it self it be inconsistent with it; And so
simple is man, that, under pretence of eschewing
one extremity of errour, he rusheth forward to the
other, by the seen absurdity whereof, and by Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tans
subtlety, he is at last constrained to embrace
of new his old errour, which he had formerly for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>saken:
for, <hi>Paul</hi> having laboured in the former
Epistle to settle them in the saith of the resurre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction
and of a day of Judgement, 1 <hi>Thes. 4. 14,
&amp;c.</hi> in opposition, doubtless, to some who did
question those truths, as at <hi>Corinth, 1 Cor.</hi> 15. 12.
some did take occasion hence to run to the other
extremity and maintain that the day of Christ
should come to pass in that very age, wherein Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tans
design doubtless was to drive them back again
to their former errour, that there would be no
such day at all, when the event should prove their
second opinion to be false. <hi>As that the day of
Christ is at hand.</hi>
               </p>
               <pb n="336" facs="tcp:61385:174"/>
               <q>Ver. 3. Let no man deceive you by any means:—</q>
               <p>He doth here repeat the former disswasive from
suffering themselves to be <hi>deceived,</hi> or (as the
word signifieth) led aside from the way of truth in
the present particular, <hi>by any man,</hi> though he were
never so learned and holy, or <hi>by any mean,</hi> neither
those three mentioned <hi>v.</hi> 2. nor by any other.
<hi>Doct.</hi> 1. So prone are men by nature to embrace
errour, when it is vented, as being the birth of cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rupt
natural light, <hi>Eccles.</hi> 7. 29. and tending of
it self to gratifie some one or other of our unmorti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fied
lusts, 2 <hi>Tim.</hi> 4. 3. that there is need of reite<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rated
disswasives from it, and of often inculcating
the self same things by the Lords Ministers, which
may tend to guard his people against the power of
it: for, he doth here repeat the former disswasive,
<hi>Let no man deceive you.</hi> 2. As Satan laboureth
to engage men, of different ranks and dispositions,
to be instrumental in carrying on the self same
errour, and prompteth them with variety of wayes
and means for throughing of their work, accord<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
to the various tempers of the Lords people
whom he intendeth to ensnare, whereof some are
more easily wrought upon by one instrument and
mean, and some by another: So no consideration
of the person tempting, though he were never so
insinuative, discreet, holy and able, or in doctrine
otherwayes Orthodox, and no consideration of the
means whereby he tempts (though by pretexts
most specious, reasons seemingly probable, autho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity
of men almost unquestionable) hath in it suf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficient
<pb n="337" facs="tcp:61385:174"/>
ground of excuse unto any for suffering
himself to be seduced from truth to errour; for,
he implyeth that there would be several men, and
several means, and will have them to stand out
against them all, while he saith, <hi>Let no man de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive
you by any means.</hi>
               </p>
               <q>Ver. 3.—For that day shall not come, except
there come a falling away first, and that man
of sin be revealed, the son of perdition.</q>
               <p>The Apostle in the second part of the Chapter,
refuteth the forementioned errour from this, That
such things behoved to fall out before the day of
the Lord, as could not come to pass within the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pass
of that or many ages, whereof he mentions
two, first <hi>a falling away</hi> or (as it is in the origi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal)
an apostasie, and defection, not from the
Roman Empire, as some do expone it, but from
Christ and the purity of the Gospel. And there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore,
in opposition to this apostasie, they are ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>horted
to <hi>stand fast,</hi> not to the Roman Empire,
but to the truth of the Gospel, <hi>v.</hi> 13. Besides, it is
the same word and the same purpose which is held
forth, 1 <hi>Tim.</hi> 4. 1. and the Antichrist by whom
this apostasie was to be headed is called a false
Prophet, <hi>Rev.</hi> 16. 13. and therefore it must be
an apostasie from true doctrine, as the word
doth alwayes signifie in the New Testament.
Neither doth he mean a particular defection of
some particular persons or Churches; for there
were some such defections already, both of persons,
1 <hi>Tim.</hi> 1. 20. and Churches, <hi>Gal.</hi> 1. 6. but a ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neral
<pb n="338" facs="tcp:61385:175"/>
defection of the whole visible Church, some
few only excepted, <hi>Rev.</hi> 13. 8. For therefore is
the word <hi>falling away</hi> or apostasie set down inde<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>finitely,
and without any restriction. The second
thing which was to fall our antecedently to that
day, is, the <hi>revealing of the man of sin,</hi> the great
head and patron of this apostasie, whom all accord
to be that great Antichrist spoken of, 1 <hi>Joh.</hi> 2. 18.
and 4. 3. and the beast mentioned <hi>Rev. 13. 11,
&amp;c.</hi> and the epithetes given him here declare so
much, though he be not expresly named. Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerning
whom the Apostle doth first foretel that he
<hi>shall be revealed</hi> and made known, though not so,
as that none should have any doubt concerning him;
for then how were it possible that all the world
should wonder after the beast, <hi>Rev.</hi> 13. 3. neither
were such wisdom requisite to find him out and
know him as is required, <hi>Rev.</hi> 13. 18. yet so, as
they to whom the Lord hath given eyes to see
shall evidently discern him; Which revealing and
making of him known was to be effectuated, partly,
by the preaching of the Gospel which should dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cover
him, (see <hi>v. 8.)</hi> but, chiefly, by his com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
to the height of his power, and his exercising
of open tyranny over the Church of God. Next,
that the Lords people might the better know him
when he should discover himself, the spirit of
God doth here describe him, first, from his nature,
he shall be a <hi>man,</hi> and not a Devil, as some did
falsly imagine. Now that he is called a <hi>man</hi> in the
singular number, with the article prefixed in the
Original, doth not inferr that he should be one
single man, and individual person without successi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on,
<pb n="339" facs="tcp:61385:175"/>
as the Papists imagine, to defend their Pope
from being the Antichrist here described, but all in
vain. For, 1. The same word with the article
prefixed doth not alwayes point at one individual
person, but sometimes must be extended to many
men, or to any man indefinitely, as <hi>Joh. 2. 25.
2 Tim.</hi> 3. 17. Secondly, That the Antichrist can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not
be only one individual person will be clear if
we consider the many great things which Scripture
foretelleth shall be effectuated by him, whereof there
is one here, to wit, the carrying on of that woful
work of an universal apostasie from Christ and
truth through the whole Christian world, presently
spoken of, unto an height and head, which surely
behoved to be a work of more ages than one, other<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wise
the argument here used by <hi>Paul</hi> would have
been but of small force to prove that the day of
judgement should not fall out in the present age,
because this falling away and apostasie behoved to be
first; It would have been, I say, of no force if that
apostasie could have been brought about in the space
of one age. Besides, the spirit of Antichrist was
already working, hidly and in a Mysterie, in <hi>Pauls</hi>
time, (see upon <hi>v. 7.)</hi> and in <hi>Johns</hi> time 1 <hi>Joh.
4.</hi> 3. and was to continue until the time of Christs
second coming, (see upon <hi>v. 8.)</hi> and consequently
he cannot be one only individual person. But
therefore, thirdly, By <hi>man,</hi> or, <hi>that man,</hi> here is
meant a series and constant succession of men, of
whom one was to succeed another in their gran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deur,
power and wickedness against Christ and his
Church, as if they were all but one man acted by
one and the same spirit, even as the word High
<pb n="340" facs="tcp:61385:176"/>
Priest in the singular number is taken, <hi>Heb. 9. 7,
25.</hi> and as <hi>Daniel, chap.</hi> 7. under every one of
the four <hi>beasts</hi> doth comprize a number of Kings
succeeeding one another in the <hi>Babylonian, Persian,</hi>
and <hi>Grecian</hi> Monarchies, yea, and as shall appear
upon <hi>v.</hi> 7. the continued series and succession of
Roman Emperours is spoken of, as of one man
withholding the Antichrist from coming to the
height of his power and greatness. Secondly, the
Antichrist in this verse is described from two of
his titles; first, he shall be a <hi>man of sin;</hi> It is an
Hebraism, implying that he shall be a notorious
sinner himself, <hi>Rev.</hi> 13. 5, 6. and an Author of sin to
others, <hi>Rev.</hi> 13. 12, 14. Like <hi>Jeroboam</hi> who cau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed
<hi>Israel</hi> to sin, 2 <hi>King.</hi> 11. 10. Next, a <hi>son of
perdition,</hi> that is, one devoted to destruction, <hi>Rev.
17.</hi> 8. as <hi>Judas</hi> was who therefore hath the same
title, <hi>Joh.</hi> 17. 12. and one who should destroy others,
and that both spiritually in their souls, <hi>Rev.</hi> 17. 2.
and corporally in their bodies, <hi>Rev.</hi> 17. 6. for
which cause he is called Apollyon or a destroyer,
<hi>Rev. 9. 11. Hence Learn,</hi> first, as love to ease and
desire of freedom from trouble in the Lords people
do make them antedate promised deliveries, and
dream of a triumph before they have entred the
battel: So the Lord in Scripture doth frequently
s<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>t himself to dispossess his people of this lazy
dangerous humour, by shewing that they must first
prepare for a long lasting battel before they can
expect a compleat victory and full triumph: for,
while these <hi>Thessalonians</hi> did dream of nothing but
of a present delivery from all their trouble by
Christs second coming, the spirit of God doth
<pb n="341" facs="tcp:61385:176"/>
here forewarn them to prepare for a long conti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nuing
battel with Antichrist and his followers: <hi>for
that day shall not come except there come a falling
away first,</hi> saith he. 2. Not only particular Chur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ches
and persons, but even the Catholick Church
visible (the elect only being excepted, <hi>Matth.
24. 24.)</hi> may fall away from the purity of the
Gospel to dangerous and soul-destroying errours;
and therefore the Church of <hi>Rome</hi> can have no
ground to plead for the contrary priviledge, seeing
not only her future apostasie is more than intimate,
<hi>Rom.</hi> 11. 20. but also it is here foretold that the
Antichristian apostasie shall, as a deluge, overflow
the whole visible Church, yea and <hi>Rev.</hi> 17. 9. that
Antichrist shall erect his throne in the City of
<hi>Rome</hi> it self; for, saith he, <hi>except there come a
falling away first,</hi> to wit, a general apostasie, See
the Exposition. 3. Not only are the saddest events
which can befall the Church foreseen by God, and
powerfully overruled by him, for his own glory,
and the good of his elect, <hi>Rom.</hi> 8. 28. but he hath also
in mercy fore-acquainted his Church with them, that
when they come to pass, none should need to stumble
at them; for, therefore it is that the Lord doth here
forewarn his Church of this general apostasie: <hi>ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cept
there come a falling away first.</hi> 4. Even Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tans
Kingdom, and his many instruments under
him, are most united in their woful work, and in
uniform means, and wayes for carrying on their
work of bearing down the Kingdom of Jesus
Christ; And therefore that union boasted of so
much by Papists can be no infallible mark that they
are the true Church; for, though Antichristianism
<pb n="342" facs="tcp:61385:177"/>
shall be a Kingdom made up of divers members,
wherein shall be many successive heads in several
ages (see the exposition) yet, because of their
unity and uniformity in driving on one and the
same design, they are all called by the name of
<hi>one man: and that man of sin be revealed.</hi>
5. One step of apostasie from truth in the Church
maketh way for an higher. It begins at l<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>ss<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>r
truths, and from those it advanceth further; Satan
doth so d<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>sign it, that he may gain his intent against
truth by p<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="2 letters">
                     <desc>••</desc>
                  </gap>ce-meale, which he cannot attain by
whole sale; And the Lord himself doth so order
it, that he may punish begun apostasie by raining
snares in his holy justice upon the guilty, whereby
they cannot but backslide more. See <hi>v.</hi> 11. for,
he foretelleth that there shall be <hi>first a falling away,</hi>
and then the <hi>man of sin shall be revealed,</hi> or disco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver
himself in his own colours, and be generally
received, and so the apostasie should heighten.
6. The nature of man now fallen is a very sink of
sin, and, being given over of God and tempted by
Satan, is ready to fall in any sin, yea to many sins
though never so gross and abominable: and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
let him that stands take heed lest he fall: for,
the Antichrist is <hi>a man of sin,</hi> a <hi>man</hi> by nature,
and yet a sink of all sin, <hi>a son of perdition, an op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poser
of God and Christ,</hi> &amp;c. 7. As where sin
goeth before, perdition and destruction do follow
after: So the more eminent men are in their per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sonal
transgressions, and the more active in
driving on others to sin with them, they may ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pect
the more inevitable and dreadful destruction
from the Lord, as their reward; for, if Antichrist
<pb n="343" facs="tcp:61385:177"/>
be <hi>a man of sin,</hi> a notorious sinner himself, an au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thor
of sin to others first, he shall be <hi>a son of per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dition</hi>
next. 8. Though they who are active in
driving others on to sin shall smart most for it, as
said is, yet those who are seduced and drawn over
by them shall not escape; for, as he is the man of
sin for his causing others to sin, so a <hi>son of perdition</hi>
for bringing spiritual perdition upon them also.</p>
               <q>Ver. 4. Who opposeth and exalteth himself above
all that is called God, or that is worshipped, so
that he as God, sitteth in the Temple of God,
shewing himself that he is God.</q>
               <p>The Apostle doth describe the Antichrist, third<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly,
from two of his properties; first, <hi>he opposeth
himself,</hi> or (as it is in the original,) he is a prime
opposite or adversary, to wit unto Christ; for there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
is he called <hi>Antichrist, 1 Joh.</hi> 2. 18. now
every heretick is in so far at least an adversary
and opposite to Christ, but he in a special man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner:
for his opposition was, 1. To be most potent,
as having a fixed orderly Kingdom, whereof he is
head, set up in opposition to Christ, 2. More uni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>versal,
as setting himself to undermine every Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stian
truth almost, 3. He was to oppose Christ espe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cially
in those truths relating to Christs offices to
which he was anointed as the name, <hi>Christ,</hi> and
<hi>Antichrist,</hi> in the greek imply. Only know that
what is spoken here of Antichrists opposition to
Christ, and afterwards of his shewing himself <hi>that
he is God,</hi> must not be understood as if he would
profess so much in words, which the Papists affirm;
<pb n="344" facs="tcp:61385:178"/>
for, as followeth immediately, he shall sit in the
Temple of God, and Antichristianism is called a
mysterie, <hi>v.</hi> 7. besides he shall be a false Prophet,
<hi>Rev.</hi> 16. 13. and have the horns of the Lamb, <hi>Rev.
13.</hi> 11. and consequently, a famous hypocrite and
dissembler, (as some of the Papists are forced to
confess) yea and shall be adored by the world of
professed Christians, <hi>Rev.</hi> 12. 13. which is not
imaginable, if he were a professed enemy to Christ
and an avowed Atheist. And therefore his oppo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sition
to Christ and God, here spoken of, is real
and in deeds, but under a mask and pretence of
friendship. The Antichrists second property is
his intolerable pride and arrogance, first, in relati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
to men, and the chief of men, He should ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceedingly
and above measure <hi>exalt himself</hi> (as the
word is rendred, 2 <hi>Cor. 12. 7.)</hi> and this, <hi>above
all that is called God.</hi> I conceive he meaneth not
the true God, for he is spoken of after, but earthly
Magistrates who are called Gods, <hi>Psal.</hi> 82. 1.
above whom he should exalt himself, by usurping
power over them to enthrone and dethrone them at
pleasure, <hi>Rev.</hi> 17. 12, 13. and this not only inferi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>our
Magistrates and Kings over particular King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>doms,
but Emperours and mighty Monarchs over
many realms, expressed here in these words, <hi>or that
which is worshipped.</hi> The word in the Original
doth signifie that which is holden in highest de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gree
of reverence, whether religious or civil, and
with a little variation was an usual stile given to
the Roman Emperours, which did difference them
most from other Magistrates, <hi>Act.</hi> 25. 21, 25.
Next, his arrogance is set forth in relation to the
<pb n="345" facs="tcp:61385:178"/>
true God, which is brought in as an higher step
following upon the former, and joyntly herewith
he gives a fourth branch of his description, from the
greatness of his power, and the place where he
shall exercise it. First, <hi>he shall sit,</hi> the Apostle
doth not mean local or corporal sitting, but his
supream and setled power, rule and government set
forth oft by <hi>sitting, Psal. 9. 4. Ezek.</hi> 28. 2. Next,
the place wherein he shall sit or rule, is, <hi>the tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple
of God,</hi> not the Temple at <hi>Jerusalem</hi> (as some
Papists affirm, though others of them are forced to
acknowledge the truth) for that Temple is ruined
many years since, <hi>Matth.</hi> 24. 1, 2. the re-edifying
whereof ever since (when several times attempted
as Histories shew) hath been signally impeded
from Heaven. And though it should be built again
by Antichrist to be worshipped therein, yet it could
not be called <hi>the Temple of God</hi> but rather of the
Devil: and therefore hereby must be meant the
Church of God, not so much the material house of
stones and timber, where the Church doth meet,
as the Christian Church of visible professours, in
which the Antichrist shall set himself as head and
chief, and which he shall tyrannically oppress.
See the Temple of God taken in this sense, 1 <hi>Cor.
3.</hi> 16. 6. 16. And here, as I formerly said, the
Apostle intermixeth the second branch of the An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tichrists
arrogance, to wit, in relation to God,
whereby 1. He shall manage his rule and govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
in the Church <hi>as God,</hi> pretending to have no
less than divine authority even the same with God
and Christ, <hi>Rev. 13—11</hi>—he shall <hi>shew
himself that he is God</hi> not professing so much in
<pb n="346" facs="tcp:61385:179"/>
words (as is already proved) but, as the Greek
word signifieth, shewing or attempting to shew by
his actions that he is no less to be esteemed of than
God, while he either attributes unto himself, or
suffers others to ascribe unto him and discharge to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards
him, such things as belong only to God,
as divine titles, worship and properties, <hi>Rev. 13. 4.
Doct.</hi> 1. The spirit of God doth not judge of men
so much by what they say, as by what they do, not
by fair pretences, but by the reality of their pra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctises,
and willeth us to judge accordingly: for,
though the Antichrist sit in the Temple of God,
pretending he doth all things for Christ and at
his command, yet because he doth really and in
deeds oppose Christ, therefore he is called an op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>posite
to him: <hi>who opposeth himself.</hi> 2. An op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>posi<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>e
and adversary to God and Christ doth sel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom
prove a faithful friend to man, whosoever
doth once break his trust to the former, he will
not spare to trample upon the latter, if it may
conduce for his interest and doth not exceed the
reach of his power: for, upon the Antichrist his
opposing himself to God and Christ, doth follow
his arrogance to man, in <hi>exalting himself</hi> above
the supream Civil Magistrate, even <hi>all that is called
God or is worshipped.</hi> See the exposition. 3. A
spirit of pride and arrogance is insatiable and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>defatigable,
and extreamly daring: It must be all
and above all, otherwise it is nothing, and where
it is attended with success, it attempteth things al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>most
impossible, and remaineth indesatigable un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>til
the height aspired at be once attained: for, An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tichrist
in his arrogancy, though he be but a false
<pb n="347" facs="tcp:61385:179"/>
Prophet, <hi>Rev.</hi> 16. 13. aspireth above Kings, yea
Emperours, and ceaseth not until he work himself
up above them all: <hi>he exalts himself above all that
is called God, or is worshipped.</hi> 4. One degree of
sin doth so much make way for a further, that
those things which at the first men do stick at,
will, through the continued custome of some lesser
degrees of those same evils, be easily swallowed at
last and without reluctance; for, Antichrists arro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gance
against man maketh way for his arrogance
against God and hardneth him in it, as the Apostle
insinuates, while he saith, <hi>so that he as God sitteth,</hi>
making this his pride against God follow upon the
former. 5. The Antichrist is not to be sought
without the visible Church, neither among the
Turks, as some do imagine, nor yet among the
Jews, as the Papists do dream, that Antichrist shall
be one individual person without succession, by
Nation a Jew, of the Tribe of <hi>Dan,</hi> born of an
Whore in <hi>Babylon,</hi> a profest enemy to the very
name of Christian Religion, shall draw the Jews
after him, build the Temple at <hi>Jerusalem,</hi> cause
himself to be worshipped therein as the true and
living God, and yet be a secret worshipper of the
Devil, that he shall bring all Kingdoms under him,
Reign precisely three years and an half, kill <hi>Enoch</hi>
and <hi>Elias</hi> the fore-runners of Christ, and at last
himself be killed by Christ or an Angel forty five
dayes before the day of Judgement, which fable as
it is maintained by them to defend their Pope from
being Antichrist, so it appeareth abundantly to be
but a fabulous invention by the whole current of
this Prophesie, and especially by that which is here
<pb n="348" facs="tcp:61385:180"/>
affirmed, <hi>He shall sit in the Temple of God,</hi> and
therefore is to be found, not without, but, within
the visible Church, even a Bishop claiming uni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>versal
authority over the whole Church, accompa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nied
with an army of Priests as one of their own
Popes did maintain a little before the Antichrist did
come to his height. <hi>He shall sit,</hi> saith <hi>Paul, in the
Temple of God.</hi> See the Exposition.</p>
               <q>Ver. 5. Remember ye not, that when I was yet
with you, I told you these things?</q>
               <p>The Apostle closeth the former description by
giving them a gentle and indirect reproof for their
oblivion and ignorance of the truths presently de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>livered,
as that which had unsettled them in the
present truth concerning the time of Christs second
coming, and hereby addeth a weight to what he
had now written about the Antichrist, while he
sheweth that it was not a doctrine newly invented,
but that he had formerly told them fully of it, and
instructed them in all its particular branches while
he was with them at <hi>Thessalonica, Act.</hi> 17. 1, 2.
and therefore they ought to have remembred it.
<hi>Doct.</hi> 1. As the Church enjoyeth now and then
some peaceable times, wherein the Gospel hath
free passage without any considerable check or re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>straint
either from errour or persecution: So it is
the duty both of Pastors and people to improve so
rich a mercy to the best advantage: and especial<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
then the Lords servants should give frequent
warnings of future evils, that the people of God
may fore-arm themselves against an approaching
<pb n="349" facs="tcp:61385:180"/>
storm; for, while the Church at <hi>Thessalonica</hi> en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>joyed
some little respite from trouble, <hi>Paul</hi> doth
stir his time among them, and gives them warning
that the Churches tryals under Antichrist was com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing.
<hi>When I was yet with you I told you these
things.</hi> 2. As it is a blame-worthy fault, too fre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quently
incident unto the Lords people, to forget
what necessary truths have been taught unto them
by their faithful Pastors, and especially those which
tend to make them shake off security and ease, and
prepare for eminent tryals: So forgetfulness of this
kind doth encourage Satan to sow among them
tares of errour, which otherwise he would have
but little heart to venture on, as despairing his pains
should meet with the desired success; for, <hi>Paul</hi>
insinuates they had forgot, and reproves them in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>directly
for it, as that which had encouraged Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tan
to brangle them about the time of Christs com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing,
which they could not have imagined to come
in the present age, if they had but remembred
what he had taught them about the Antichrist.
<hi>Remember ye not</hi> (saith he) <hi>I told you these things?</hi>
               </p>
               <q>Ver. 6. And now ye know what withholdeth, that
he might be revealed in his time.</q>
               <p>Because the Apostle had shewn <hi>v.</hi> 3. that the
Antichrist must be revealed antecedently to Christs
second coming, he doth now, in the third branch of
this prophesie, speak something of the time when
he should be revealed, and of the lets and impedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments,
which for the time did hinder his discove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry:
And first, he sheweth he was not yet revealed,
<pb n="350" facs="tcp:61385:181"/>
and therefore they were not to expect the day of
Christs second coming so soon as they did, while
he mentions something which did then <hi>withhold,</hi>
or stay and hinder his revealing and publick ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pearing
in the height of his power for a season,
the Lords overruling providence so ordering <hi>that
he might be revealed,</hi> not before, but, <hi>in his time,</hi>
that is, the time prefixed by God for that thing.
Now by this stop and obstacle in the way of Anti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>christs
rising greatness must be meant some man,
person or persons, as appears from <hi>v.</hi> 7. where he
is spoken of as such, <hi>only he who now letteth;</hi> and
the general current of Interpreters, both Popish and
Protestant, and many ancient Fathers also, do agree
that hereby is understood the supream authority
and respect of the ancient Emperours in the Ro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man
Empire, who by their eminent temporal power
did hinder the arising of Antichrists spiritual
power over the Christian world, and upon whose
ruines the Antichrist was to arise, and to possess
their Throne and seat in the City scituate upon se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven
hills, <hi>Rev.</hi> 17. 9. even <hi>Rome</hi> that great City
which did then Reign over the Kings of the Earth,
<hi>Rev.</hi> 17. 18. and though the Apostle had expres<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed
so much to them while he was with them (for
therefore he saith they <hi>knew</hi> what did <hi>withhold)</hi>
yet he doth not judge it convenient to express it
by letter, lest thereby he had provoked the Empe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rours
of <hi>Rome</hi> against the Christians, when they
should hear that a professed Christian would over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>throw
the present government of the Empire, and
rise upon their ruine. <hi>Doct.</hi> 1. The wise Lord in
his eternal decree hath not only condescended,
<pb n="351" facs="tcp:61385:181"/>
among other things, upon the sad calamities and
sharp tryals which he hath thought fit to exercise
his people by, but also upon the meanest circum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stance
of all their troubles, even the very point of
time, most seasonable for Gods glory and his peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ples
good, wherein they shall break <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>orth, is
weighed in the scales of his eternal wisdom, and
accordingly fixed upon by him; for, here <hi>Paul</hi>
speaks of a <hi>due time</hi> prefixed by God, wherein
the Antichrist was to be revealed for the Chur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ches
tryal, <hi>that he might be revealed in his time.</hi>
The word signifieth a fit and seasonable nick of
time. 2. Such is the malice of Satan and of de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vilish
instruments against the Church of Christ,
that they gladly would, and accordingly do endea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vour
to antedate the time of the Churches tryal
prefixed by God, and to hasten forward the
height of her calamity with such celerity, as that
the Lords people should be overwhelmed with it,
before they be forewarned of it, or get any time
to make ready for it; for, Antichrist would have
revealed himself sooner than his due time, if some<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>what
had not withheld. <hi>And now ye know what
withholdeth,</hi> saith he. 3. It pleaseth the Lord,
in mercy unto his people, to sift the violent course
of devils and men, to carry their counsels head<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>long,
so that their hands cannot fulfil their wo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful
enterprize of bringing the Churches trouble
unto an height, before the time appointed by
God, as most fitting for it, do fully come: And
this he doth by casting in such lets and impe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diments
as prove insuperable either by devils or
men; for, while Antichrist doth haste to be re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vealed,
<pb n="352" facs="tcp:61385:182"/>
God casts in a lett to withhold of pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pose,
<hi>that he might not be revealed before his
due time.</hi> 4. Such absolute soveraign power
hath God to encline the wills of men whitherso<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever
he pleaseth, <hi>Prov.</hi> 21. 1. that he often ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>keth
even them who are enemies to him to bring
about his counsel for good to his Church and
people, beyond their own intention and purpose;
for, God did so order that the Roman Empe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rours,
even while Heathens, did <hi>withhold</hi> the
Antichrist from coming to the height of his
power and Tyranny over the Church, until <hi>his
due time.</hi> 5. Some points of truth, the publish<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
whereof are not of such necessity as to coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tervaile
the dammage, may safely be concealed in
prudence, when the untimeous publishing of them
in all probability will hasten persecution, and
mar either the internal or external peace of the
Church. Such serpentine wisdom doth well con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sist
with the Doves simplicity and Christian zeal,
<hi>Matth.</hi> 10. 16. for, <hi>Paul</hi> doth not here express
that the Roman Empire by name should with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hold,
until it were taken out of the way, lest he
had thereby hastened persecution. <hi>And now ye
know what withholdeth,</hi> saith he.</p>
               <q>Ver. 7. For the mysterie of iniquity doth already
work: only he who now letteth, will let, until
he be taken out of the way.</q>
               <p>He doth here, first, give a reason for what he
presently spoke, that the Roman Empire did im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pede,
not the being, but, the revealing and disco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>very
<pb n="353" facs="tcp:61385:182"/>
of the Antichrist and Antichristianism, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause
they already had entred the Church, though
not avow<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

                  </gap>dly, yet secretly. Antichristian Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minion
and Doctrine were even then <hi>working</hi> and
advancing by little and little towards an height, in
so far as justification by works, <hi>Gal.</hi> 2 16. the
worshipping of Angels, <hi>Col.</hi> 2. 18. abstinence from
certain kinds of meats, <hi>Col.</hi> 2. 21. and from mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riage,
and such like Antichristian Doctrines, were
then Preached, and desire of rule and preheminence
among Churchmen over their brethren, and the

of some, 3 <hi>Joh.</hi> 9. Which Antichristian do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrines
and tyranny he calls a <hi>mysterie,</hi> or, a thing
hid and secret, chiefly with respect to the Apostles
time, and the time following until Antichrist should
be revealed, because Antichristianism then, toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
with those other Heresies which made way for
it, did secretly and under a shew of devotion and
piety <hi>(Col. 2. 23.)</hi> advance and promove from
evil to worse, 2 <hi>Tim.</hi> 3. 13. until they might end
in the almost total overthrow of Christian Reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gion
at the last. Besides that Antichristian do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrine
and tyranny were still to remain a Mysterie,
even after that Antichrist should come to his height,
so that a man, without eye-salve from God, shall
hardly discern it, because of the fair pretences of
love to Christ, to truth and to piety under which
he was to lurk; for therefore is he called a false
Prophet, <hi>Rev.</hi> 16. 13. and said to have two horns
like a Lamb, <hi>Rev.</hi> 13. 11. pretending to do all in
Christ the Lambs name, and to make use of his
horns and power as his substitute and Vicar. And
<pb n="354" facs="tcp:61385:183"/>
it is called a <hi>mysterie of iniquity,</hi> as in opposition
to the doctrine of Christ, called a mysterie of God<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liness,
1 <hi>Tim.</hi> 3. 16. so because Antichrists do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrine
and way (however most fair and specious in
pretext, yet) in reality and deed should be nothing
else but errour, untruth, impiety against God, <hi>Rev.
13.</hi> 5. and unrighteousness against man, <hi>Rev.
13.</hi> 17. for the word rendred, <hi>iniquity,</hi> doth ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>press
the general nature of sin, and as it were all
sin whatsoever, 1 <hi>Joh. 3. v.</hi> 4. Next, he sheweth
how long the authority of the Roman Emperours
succeeding one another (called here <hi>he who letteth)</hi>
should prove a stop in the way of Antichrists grow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
greatness, even <hi>until he be taken out of the
way,</hi> that is, until their power be so broken, as that
they should not be able any longer to withstand this
arising spiritual dominion, and especially until they
should leave <hi>Rome,</hi> the seat of the Empire, fully
void and free, wherein the Antichrist was to erect
his Throne, <hi>Rev. 17. 9. Doct.</hi> 1. So great an
enemy is Satan to mans salvation, that no sooner
did Christ erect a Kingdom in the world for saving
sinners, but as soon, at least within a little, the devil
did counter-work, by endeavouring to erect an An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tichristian
Kingdom, thereby to render the King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom
of Christ, so far as in him lay, wholly use<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>less:
and therefore antiquity, so much boasted of
by Papists, is no undoubted mark of the true
Church, for Antichristianism is but by few years of
latter standing that the Kingdom of Christ under
the Gospel; <hi>for, the mysterie of iniquity doth al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ready
work,</hi> saith he. 2. So subtle an enemy also
is Satan, and so full of foresight, as that he hath
<pb n="355" facs="tcp:61385:183"/>
many designs on foot at once, for effectuating his
woful and malicious purpose, that so when one
falleth by, and becometh useless, another may hold
and carry on his work, so as the field be never fully
empty: for, though the Roman Emp<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>re at this
time was fully employed for carrying on the de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sign
of Satan in bearing down the Kingdom of
Christ, yet foreseeing, or at least fearing, that it
would be taken out of the way, he begins in time
to provide himself of the Antichristian state, to
carry on this woful work in their room, <hi>the my<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sterie
of iniquity doth already work.</hi> 3. So subtle
an enemy also is Satan, as that, when his power and
interest is not so great, as that he may safely work
above ground, and carry on his work avowedly in
open view of all, he contents himself to remain
undiscovered, and rather to advance with a slow
pace and undiscernably, than by too much preci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pitancy
to discover his design untimeously, and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sequently
to expose it to crushing; for, while the
Roman Empire was in strength and vigour, and so
would have crushed that design of setting up an
Antichristian state in <hi>Rome,</hi> he wrought in a my<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sterie,
<hi>The mysterie of iniquity doth already work.</hi>
4. Satan and his instruments, especially heretical
spirits, are not alwayes idle, when they do not
kyth, but usually are most active in carrying on their
woful work as they find access, when they appear
least; for, when Antichristianism durst not kyth
above board, yet it did work, <hi>the mysterie of ini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quity
doth already work.</hi> 5. The evil of errour,
especially of Antichristian errours, and the height
at which they aimed, neither doth, nor did kyth
<pb n="356" facs="tcp:61385:184"/>
at first; and therefore it is no wonder, though
men, otherwise gracious in the primitive times,
who were kept busie in maintaining truth against
other avowed errours of those times, did unawares,
and through inadvercence, contribute somewhat to
countenance the rising of that Episcopal seat in
some steps of its usurped dominion over the Church
of Christ, which, though improved moderately
and for the terrour of hereticks at first, yet, in the
Ages following, after the removal of these reve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rend
and gracious fathers, it did end in avowed An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tichristian
tyranny; for, Antichristianism did for
a long time <hi>work in a mysterie.</hi> 6. Greatest Em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pires
and worldly Monarchies which caused their
terrour in the Land of the living <hi>(Ezek. 32. 23,
24.)</hi> have their own fatal period, determined and
foreknown by God longer than which they cannot
stand. The Lord giving hereby anevident demonstra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
of his justice, while he visibly avengeth all those
wrongs and insolencies, which they by their power
and terrour have acted towards others, especially his
Church, and putting a difference betwixt all earthly
powers, and the spiritual Kingdom of Jesus Christ
under the Gospel, which shall never be destroyed,
nor left unto other people, but it shall break in
pieces and consume all those Kingdoms, and it shall
be for ever, <hi>Dan.</hi> 2. 44. for, he saith even the
Roman Empire <hi>shall be taken out of the way.</hi>
7. When the time prefixed by God, for bringing
about a work either of judgement or mercy, is
fully come, all impediments and hinderances, even
the greatest, though flourishing Kingdoms and
mighty Empires which formerly did lett it, are
<pb n="357" facs="tcp:61385:184"/>
easily and with little ado removed: for, it is
here foretold th<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>t when the due time of discover<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
the Antichrist should come, <hi>he who then did
lett,</hi> to wit, the <hi>Roman</hi> Empire, <hi>would be taken
out of the way.</hi>
               </p>
               <q>Ver. 8. And then shall that wicked one be re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vealed,—</q>
               <p>The Apostle doth now shew the time when the
Antichrist should be revealed, or discover himself
by exercising his open and avowed tyrannies
over the Church of Christ; to wit, <hi>t<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>en,</hi> when he
who did le<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>t should be taken out of the way, that
is, as was before exponed, when the power of
the Roman Empire should be weakned and ren<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dred
wholly unable to resist the growing great<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness
of the Antichrist. Neither is it necessary
to condescend here upon a peremptory point of
time, but as the one through a long tract of time
should decrease, so the other should increase;
and he calleth the Antichrist here, <hi>That wicked
one,</hi> or (as it is in the Original) that <hi>lawless one,</hi>
who should hold himself to be bound by no Law,
neither Gods Law, or mans Law, but above all
Law, so as he may dispense with Law, and inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pret
Law according to his pleasure. <hi>Doct.</hi> 1.
That the great Antichrist here foretold is already
come, and hath discovered himself by exercising
his open and avowed tyranny, is clear from this,
that the very point of time prefixed by God for
his publick appearing, is, the taking of that out
of the way which formerly did lett him, to wit,
<pb n="358" facs="tcp:61385:185"/>
the Roman Empire. Now sure it is, that though
the name of an Emperour and Empire doth still
remain, yet his Imperial Power and authority is
fully removed in <hi>Asia,</hi> in <hi>Africk,</hi> yea in <hi>Rome</hi>
it self the ancient seat of the Empire, where he
hath now no command at all, but left it fully void
for Antichrist to erect his Throne; neither hath
he any thing left him in <hi>Europe</hi> proper to him as
Roman Emperour, except the bare title and some
ceremonies and complements, with a little power
and authority in <hi>Germany,</hi> but far below that
which the Roman Emperours of old enjoyed, and
even this little he cannot have but at the Popes
pleasure, who must approve the Emperours electi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on,
otherwise it is null. Now it was not the name
or shadow, but the power, majesty and authority
of the Empire, and especially the Emperours inte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rest
in <hi>Rome</hi> the ancient Imperial seat, which did
withhold the Antichrists rising greatness. And
therefore that being removed, the only thing which
impeded his revealing is taken away, and conse<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quently,
Antichrist must be revealed already, and
not yet to come as Papists affirm: for, saith
he, <hi>and then</hi> (to wit when he who now letteth
shall be taken out of the way <hi>v.—7.) shall
that wicked one be revealed.</hi>
               </p>
               <pb n="359" facs="tcp:61385:185"/>
               <q>Ver.—8. Whom the Lord shall consume with
the spirit of his mouth, and shall destroy with
the brightness of his coming.</q>
               <p>Lest the Lords people had been above measure
terrified by what remains of this dreadful prophesie,
concerning Antichrists wonderful power and suc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cess,
therefore the Apostle, before he proceed fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther,
doth, in this fourth branch of the Prophesie,
for the comfort of the Godly, foretel Antichrists
destruction; whereof he mentioneth three de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>grees:
first, the <hi>Lord</hi> Christ, who is the principal
author of this destruction, <hi>shall consume him,</hi> not
in a moment, but, as the word signifieth, by little
and little, piece and piece, weaken his respect and
power in the Church of God: and this <hi>with the
spirit,</hi> or breath, <hi>of his mouth,</hi> or, the powerful
preaching of the Gospel by his sent Ministers, <hi>Rev.
14.</hi> 6, 7. who are as Christs mouth, through
whom he breatheth out the word of his everlast<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
Gospel. (See the Preaching of the Gospel
called <hi>the rod of his mouth and breath of his lips,</hi>
Isa. 11. 4.) Secondly, <hi>he shall destroy him,</hi> that
is, as the word signifieth, utterly abolish, enervate
and make void, to wit, his power and respect, and
that with <hi>the brightness of his second coming;</hi> for,
the word rendred, brightness, is usually joyned
with his coming to judgement; see <hi>Titus</hi> 2. 13.
only because the last blow to be given to the Anti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>christs
person seemeth to precede the last day, <hi>Rev.
19.</hi> 20. therefore we must look on this last step
of his destruction, as containing divers particular
<pb n="360" facs="tcp:61385:186"/>
strokes in it, as first a stroke upon <hi>Rome</hi> the seat of
the beast, <hi>Rev.</hi> 18. 2. next, upon the person of the
beast, or Antichrist himself, <hi>Rev.</hi> 19. 20. after
which it is like the Antichristian Kingdom will want
an head. Thirdly, upon all the relicts of Anti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>christianism,
and all who shall after that adhere to
their errours and superstitions, of which sort it is
probable there will be some even until the last day.
And accordingly it is safest to conceive of Christs
second coming with some latitude, so as it may
mean not only the very last day, but also the fore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>going
signs and evidences of its approaching, of
which those glorious dispensations of his power in
overturning the beast himself and his seat shall not
be the least. <hi>Doct.</hi> 1. So tender is God of his be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieving
people, that, though he see it sometimes
necessary to acquaint them with such things as will
put them to grief, yet, he postponeth no time in
hasting to them with a timeous and seasonable com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fort,
when he seeth their hazard of fainting through
excessive fear and discouragement calleth for it:
for, he breaks in upon the midst of this dreadful
prophesie with the comfortable tydings of Anti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>christs
future destruction, <hi>whom the Lord shall
consume,</hi> saith he. 2. Our Lords most glorious
conquests and victories, in which most of himself
is seen, are those which are obtained not so much
by outward force, by might or by power, <hi>Zech.
4.</hi> 6. as by the plain and powerful preaching of his
mighty word, which being the rod of his strength,
<hi>Psal.</hi> 110. 2. he doth thereby brui<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>e his enemies,
and break them asunder; while he discovereth to
open view their doings, errours and deceits where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in
<pb n="361" facs="tcp:61385:186"/>
their great strength doth lye, <hi>Heb.</hi> 4. 12.
while he subdueth some of their followers unto
himself, <hi>Act. 9. 1, &amp;c.</hi> and doth vex and gall
others as seeing their power and reputation daily
weakned by such a contemptible mean, <hi>Rev. 16.
10,</hi> 11. which nevertheless they cannot hinder:
for, our <hi>Lord shall consume Antichrist by the spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit
of his mouth.</hi> 3. Whatever power or efficacy
the word Preached hath for bringing about the fore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mentioned
effects, it proceedeth not from any
power or vertue in the word it self, <hi>Heb.</hi> 4. 2. or
in them who do dispense it, 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 3. 6, 7. but
from the powerful influence of the Lord Christ,
through whom alone the Word preached is mighty
to overthrow all strong holds and cast down vain
imaginations, 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 10. 4, 5. for, he sheweth it is
the <hi>Lord Christ who shall consume Antichrist by the
spirit of his mouth.</hi> 4. The Antichrist spoken of
in Scripture, cannot be he which Papists present us
with, to wit, one individual person, by Nation a
Jew, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> who shall be killed at an instant, either
immediately by Christ himself, or by an Angel at
his direction; for, the Antichrist shall not be de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stroyed
at once but by little and little, and first cast
as it were into a bed of languishing, his total over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>throw
being to follow after, <hi>whom the Lord shall
consume and destroy.</hi> See the exposition. 5. Though
the Lord might destroy his strongest enemies at an
instant, <hi>Isa.</hi> 37. 36. and when he begins also make
an end, 1 <hi>Sam.</hi> 3. 12. yet his usual way is to ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vance
toward their total ruine by certain degrees
and steps; that somewhat of his glory may be seen
in every step, <hi>Psal.</hi> 59. 11. that such of them as are
<pb n="362" facs="tcp:61385:187"/>
appointed for mercy may, in the mean time, be
drawn to repentance, <hi>Rom.</hi> 2. 4. and others rendred
inexcusable, <hi>Rom.</hi> 2. 5. and that his people may
be kept in exercise betwixt hopes and fears, thanks<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>giving
for what is already done, <hi>Psal.</hi> 56. 12, 13. ear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nest
prayer and dependence upon God for com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pleating
of what doth yet remain; <hi>Psal.</hi> 56. 13.
for, it is here foretold that this shall be his way
with the Antichrist, <hi>whom the Lord shall consume</hi> by
little and little, as the word signifies. 6. As there
are but small grounds of hope from Scripture that
the word preached shall convert the Antichrist, or
work a reformation among his devoted followers,
it shall <hi>consume</hi> him, but not convert him; So
where the word preached in life and power doth
not prevail to the conversion of those who hear it
now, it is an undoubted fore-runner of eternal de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>struction
to be inflicted upon them by Christ the
Lord, when he shall come in glory to judge the
world hereafter; for, because the spirit of Christs
mouth doth only consume and not convert the An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tichrist,
Therefore shall <hi>Christ destroy him with the
brightness of his coming.</hi> 7. As the seeds of An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tichristianism
were early sown in the Church (see
<hi>v. 7. doct. 1.)</hi> so they are to continue long, even
until Christs second coming to judge the world;
and therefore the Church is not to dream of ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving
any time fully free from trouble of all sorts
until then, neither is that perpetuity and long con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinuance
of doctrine publickly professed through
many succeeding ages, whereof the Papists boast,
an infallible mark of a true Church; for some<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>what
of Antichrist and Antichristianism will be in
<pb n="363" facs="tcp:61385:187"/>
the world so long as it last. <hi>Whom the Lord shall
destroy with the brightness of his coming.</hi>
               </p>
               <q>Ver. 9. Even him whose coming is after the work<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
of Satan, with all power, and signs, and ly<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
wonders.</q>
               <p>The Apostle, in the first branch of this Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phesie,
returns to speak more fully of Antichrists
<hi>coming,</hi> whereby is meant not only his first ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vancement
and raising to his power, but the tract of
his government in defending, ruling and enlarging
of his Kingdom, which is described from his auxi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liary
forces, helps, or means, by the assistance
whereof he should procure to himself a general
respect and esteem in the Christian world; and
those are three, whereof two are in this verse,
first, <hi>the working,</hi> or, as the word signifieth, the
utmost efficacy and most powerful operation of <hi>Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tan,</hi>
who should employ the height of his great
power, piercing knowledge, malicious wit, indefa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tigable
diligence, and marvellous activity for sup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>porting
and enlarging of Antichrists Kingdom.
The second help is <hi>all power and signs,</hi> &amp;c. or
power of signs, by an usual flowre of speech ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pressing
one thing by two words, and the meaning
is that Satan should assist him, and his officers un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der
him, with a power and fa<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>ulty of working
signs and wonders for confirmation of his tyran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny
and false doctrine, <hi>Rev.</hi> 13. 13, 14. and first
he calls this power <hi>all power,</hi> not as if either Satan
or Antichrist were omnipotent, or had power to do
what they please, <hi>Job. 1. 12. Act.</hi> 4. 28. but it's
<pb n="364" facs="tcp:61385:188"/>
all <hi>created</hi> power, or the utmost of what created
skill and understanding can reach. 2. He calls
them <hi>lying wonders,</hi> or, as it is in the Original,
<hi>wonders of lies</hi> or falshood, which agreeth both
to signs and wonders, as indeed they are usually
taken for one and the same thing in different re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>spects,
<hi>Rom. 15. 19. Mark.</hi> 13. 22. and they are
false and lying, because some of them were to be
but counterfeit and feigned, meer juglings, deceiv<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
the outward senses, and others of them, (though
truly done and breeding marvel and astonishment
in beholders, who know not the manner and way
how they are done, yet) should not be true mira<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cles
as being only effects of some secret natural
causes, for only God can produce true Miracles,
or works exceeding the reach of all naturall causes,
<hi>Psal. 72. 18. 77. 13. Rom.</hi> 4. 17. And lastly, all
of them should be wrought by Satan, and his in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>struments
to confirm false and lying doctrines,
and therefore are justly called <hi>lying wonders.
Doct.</hi> 1. Though Satans power is not illimited, <hi>Job
2.</hi> 6. neither can he infallibly determine the wills
of men to follow his suggestions, <hi>Job.</hi> 1. 12. with
22. yet as he hath no small power upon this sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lunary
world (see upon <hi>Eph. 2. v. 2. doct. 8.)</hi>
yea and great influence upon mens actions by pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>senting
them with such tentations as are most agree<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able
unto their temper, 2 <hi>Sam.</hi> 11. 2. and impor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tuning
them uncessantly with inward suggestions
and representations unto their fancy of<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> such things
as may most conduce for his purpose; <hi>Prov. 4.
16.</hi> So such is his enmity to Christs Kingdom,
and malice to mans salvation, that he exerciseth the
<pb n="365" facs="tcp:61385:188"/>
utmost of all his power can reach to bear down the
one and impede the other: and therefore it is no
wonder to see some of those who are engaged un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der
him in that woful work, somewhat elevated
above the sphear of ordinary activity, skill, and
diligence; for, he shews that Satans working or
utmost activity, shall be employed against Christ
for promoting Antichrists Kingdom. <hi>Whose com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
is after the working of Satan.</hi> 2. It is a
piece of necessary wisdom in the Lords people, in
forecasting tryals, not to extenuate what hazard is
in them, but to look upon them as they are cloath<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
with all their terrifying circumstances, whereby
they may prepare for the uttermost before it
come; <hi>Job</hi> 3. 25, 26. for, the spirit of God see<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth
it necessary to present this tryal under Anti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>christ
to the Church in its full terrour. <hi>Whose
coming is after the working of Satan with all
power,</hi> &amp;c. 3. Satan doth set himself, in further<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
the condemnation of sinners, to imitate Christ
in many of those things which are done by him
in bringing about the salvation of the elect; as
Christ erects a Kingdom in the world whereof
himself is head, <hi>Psal.</hi> 2. 6. So Satan hath his
Kingdom in opposition to Christs, whereof Anti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>christ
is the visible head, <hi>Rev.</hi> 13. 11, 12. As
Christ doth impart the influences of his spirit un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to
his servants, whereby they work effectually in
those who are saved, <hi>Col.</hi> 1. 29. So Satan to the
utmost of his power doth act his instruments,
whereby through Gods permission they work effe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctually
in those who perish, <hi>Rev.</hi> 18. 13, 14.
As Christ did confirm his doctrine by mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>racles,
<pb n="366" facs="tcp:61385:189"/>
and exercise his power in his servants in
working miracles mediately by them for that end,
<hi>Heb.</hi> 2. 3, 4. So doth Satan confirm his errone<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous
doctrine in Antichrists Kingdom, by working
signs and wonders, and sometimes lendeth his
power to Antichrist and his Vassals to work the
like: for, he shews that Satan doth help Anti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>christ
to and in his Kingdom <hi>by his effectual work<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing,</hi>
and by a <hi>power of signs and wonders.</hi>
4. However Satan set himself to imitate Christ
thus, for blinding the eyes of men, and making
them believe that his Kingdom, Ministers, and
Doctrines and Miracles do differ nothing
from Christs, yet he comes not so far up to his
copy but the Lords people, who have their senses
exercised to discern both good and evil, may find a
difference betwixt what is Satans and what is
Christs; for his wonders are, and will be found to
<hi>be but lying wonders.</hi>
               </p>
               <q>Ver. 10. And with all deceiveableness of unrigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teousness,
in them that perish; because they re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived
not the love of the truth, that they might
be saved.</q>
               <p>In this Verse he, first, expresseth the third mean
and help which Antichrist was to make use of for
heightning his respect and credit in the Christian
world, <hi>all deceiveableness of unrighteousness,</hi>
where by <hi>unrighteousness,</hi> it seemeth, must be
mainly meant his unrighteous false doctrine, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause
<hi>v.</hi> 12. it is opposed to <hi>truth,</hi> as also 1 <hi>Cor.
13.</hi> 6. and it is so called, because it should tend
<pb n="367" facs="tcp:61385:189"/>
to make the receivers of it injurious to God, unjust
to men, and cruel to themselves. And <hi>by deceive<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ableness</hi>
is meant all manner of deceits, tricks,
strong and cunning perswasions, which he should
make use of to make the world believe his unrigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teous
errours to be pure and innocent truths, such
as sophistical disputations, <hi>Col.</hi> 2. 8. pretexts to
piety and devotion, <hi>Matth.</hi> 23. 14. baits of riches,
pleasures and preferments, 2 <hi>Pet.</hi> 2. 18, 19. boasts
and threatnings, <hi>Rev.</hi> 13. 17. and such like. Next,
he enters the sixth branch of this prophesie wherein
he speaketh to the Antichrists great success by the
former means and helps; and for the comfort of
the Godly he astricts this success unto a certain
kind of men, who should be his subjects and sworn
vassals. And those he describeth, first, from their
everlasting state, <hi>they shall perish</hi> eternally, to wit,
they, who should joyn with him in all his errours,
even those who strike most at the foundation, and
persist in them obstinately and finally without re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pentance,
<hi>Rev.</hi> 13. 18. and 18. 4. which holds espe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cially
in them who would adhere to him after that
the Lord should discover his damnable doctrines
and tyranny by the light of the Gospel, <hi>Rev. 14.
6,</hi> 7, 8, 9, &amp;c. Next, from the cause of their de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>struction,
to wit, when all of them should have an
offer of saving truth, some in one measure, some in
another, yet through want of <hi>love</hi> to it they would
<hi>not receive</hi> it, that is, they would reject it, for more
is intended than is expressed by this word; whence
he hints at the conclusion which he intends to prove,
to wit, that they could not be saved, but behoved
to perish, while he sheweth that receiving of the
<pb n="368" facs="tcp:61385:190"/>
truth in love is a necessary antecedent of salvation.
<hi>Doct.</hi> 1. It is the nature and way of such as are
ring-leaders of errours, to find out and prosecute all
possible means and wayes, which may in any mea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sure
tend to make their tenets plausible, and pass for
truths; that what is wanting to their errours in the
point of divine authority, and sanctified reason,
may be supplyed, by their pretences to piety, anti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quity,
by their gratifying of mens lusts, sophistical
disputations, passionate perswasions, and all such
other devices, which serve to blind the eyes even
of the wise, that they cannot so well discern betwixt
the truth and falshood of what they hear; for, it is
here foretold that Antichrist should come <hi>with all
deceiveableness of unrighteousness,</hi> or all manner
of deceits to perswade the receiving of his unrigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teous
doctrine. 2. Ring-leaders of errour are
usually men of little conscience, in so far as they
stand not much upon the nature and kind of the
means they use, whether they be right or wrong,
if so they can serve their present design: for, An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tichrist
doth use <hi>all deceiveableness of unrighteous<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness.</hi>
3. So tender is God of his peoples comfort,
that, for the most part, those Scriptures which ter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rifie
most are so contrived as to carry with them
an antidote of comfort against hopeless discourage<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
in their bosom: for, this terrifying Scripture
which speaks of Antichrists future success, hath in
it a comfort, to wit, that his power and success is
limited only to reprobates, even <hi>them that perish.</hi>
4. Though even the Godly elect may be seduced
to errour for a time, <hi>Phil.</hi> 3. 15. yet they cannot
arrive at such an height of malicious blindness, as
<pb n="369" facs="tcp:61385:190"/>
against all means of their reclaiming to remain ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stinate
in the bulk and most fundamental of Anti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>christian
errours, and to persist in their obstinacy
unto death: for, it is here foretold he should so pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vail
only <hi>in those who perish.</hi> 5. When foulest and
most dangerous errours are carryed on with fair
pretexts, subtle insinuations, pithy perswasions,
they will not want a multitude of blind followers:
for, Antichristian untruths being carryed on by <hi>all
deceiveableness,</hi> are received generally by those <hi>who
perish.</hi> 6. Though the Lord hath no regard to the
future sin of reprobates, as the cause of their repro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bation,
<hi>Rom.</hi> 9. 11, 12. yet he actually condemn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth
none of those, no not the Antichrists most
active followers, whose sin is not the cause of their
condemnation; and therefore none shall have rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son
to complain that they do perish unjustly and
without a cause: for, the cause why they perish is
here expressed, <hi>because they received not the love of
the truth.</hi> 7. Among all the sins of a people pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fessing
Christ, which deserve condemnation, and
for which reprobates shall actually be condemned,
the contempt of the Gospel is the first and chief;
It is a sin against the remedy of sin, and which pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>voketh
the Lord in his holy justice to give up the
person guilty to the power and slavery of several
other sins; so that uncleannesses, murders, perjuries,
<hi>&amp;c.</hi> are but streams flowing from this woful foun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain;
for, he mentioneth none of their other sins as
the cause of their destruction but this alone, <hi>be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause
they received not the love of the truth,</hi> saith
he. 8. If even the least report of Gospel
truths and of Christ be not received and made wel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come,
<pb n="370" facs="tcp:61385:191"/>
it is a sin sufficient to provoke the Lord to
plague the person guilty in such a manner as he
shall never recover, but undoubtedly perish; and
therefore how much more when Christ and the
Gospel is fully and plainly taught, and yet the
gracious offers of mercy therein contained are
abused and slighted? for, it is but a small and passing
report of truth and Christ, which many of Anti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>christs
followers do hear, being compared with
what we now enjoy, and yet they perish <hi>because
they received not the truth in love.</hi> 9. It is not
sufficient to receive the truth, because the politick
Laws of the Land enjoyn so much, or upon any
other account, but from love to it; otherwise Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tan,
Antichrist, or some suitable tentation from any
other art, will easily prevail to make him who hath
so received it slip from it; for, they <hi>perish,</hi> and are
given over to Antichrists delusions as appears from
<hi>v. 11. because they received not the love of the truth.</hi>
10. There is no middle betwixt Heaven and Hell,
salvation and condemnation: If a man attain not
the former, he cannot by any means escape the
latter, and if he do not walk in the way to Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven,
he doth <hi>ipso facto,</hi> and without any further,
poste swiftly forward to hell and condemnation;
for, he proves they could not but perish and be
condemned, because they refused to walk in the
way wherein they might be saved, even <hi>because
they received not the love of the truth that they
might be saved.</hi>
               </p>
               <pb n="371" facs="tcp:61385:191"/>
               <q>Ver. 11. And for this cause God shall send them
strong delusion, that they should believe a lye.</q>
               <p>He doth here further describe the v<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>ssals of An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tichrists
Kingdom, thirdly, from an higher degree
of their sin. They would not only reject truth,
but also <hi>believe a lye,</hi> that is, give a firm assent,
without any contrary doubt, to grossest untruths
and errours, as to the very truths of God. Which
their sin is set forth from a necessary antecedent of
it, the Lord his sending them strong delusion, <hi>for
this cause,</hi> to wit, for their not receiving the love
of the truth spoken of <hi>v.</hi> 10. where by <hi>strong de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lusion</hi>
or (as the word doth signifie) efficacy of
errour and seduction, is not meant errour it self,
but the prevalency and pith of errour, so that when
tentations to errour should be propounded by Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tan
and his emissaries, they would undoubtedly
prevail; and this efficacy of errour is attributed to
Gods sending, not as if the Lord did incite or
perswade men to believe errours, for he forbids
and condemns them, 2 <hi>Pet.</hi> 3. 17. but because he
not only giveth loose reins unto Satan to use his
power of seduction against them, 1 <hi>King.</hi> 22. 22.
but also raineth snares upon them, and actively
bringeth about many things in his providence,
which being in themselves good, are yet stumbled
on by them in their corruption, so, as they
are thereby furthered to close with the tentation,
<hi>Job 21. 7, &amp;c.</hi> with 14. withholds his grace
whereby they might resist tentations, 2 <hi>Chron.
32.</hi> 31. yea, and actually in his judgement with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>draws,
<pb n="372" facs="tcp:61385:192"/>
and after a sort extinguisheth that strength
and light which he had formerly given, and they
abused, <hi>Matth. 25.—29.</hi> so that they cannot
but succumb when they are tempted. <hi>Doct.</hi> 1. It
is not inconsistent with the Lords holiness, but
most agreeable to his unspotted justice, to punish sin
with sin, by giving the sinner up, in the way men<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tioned
in the exposition, to the slavery and tyran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny
of that sin wherein he so much delights; for,
he saith, <hi>for this cause,</hi> to wit, for their former
sin, <hi>God shall send them strong delusion.</hi> 2. As
one degree of sin maketh way for an higher; So
there cannot be a more terrible judgement inflicted
upon any for former sin, than that he be given up
of God to the power of it in time to come; a
judgement so much the more dreadful, as the party
smitten by it is not sensible of it; <hi>Exod.</hi> 7. 22, 23.
for, this is the terrible judgement here denounced,
<hi>for this <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap> cause God shall send them strong delu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sion.</hi>
3. That an errour, when it is vented, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cometh
mightily prevalent, in making many to
close with it and embrace it, proceedeth not from
the power of Satans tentations only, who hath not
of himself an irresistible influence upon the minds
of men, <hi>Job</hi> 1. 12. with 22. but also and mainly
from mens own corruption and blindness, and the
Lords judicial up-giving of them to it formerly
mentioned, which holdeth by parity of reason in
Satans tentations to any other sin; for, the efficacy
of errour is here spoken of as a judgement sent by
God, <hi>God shall send them strong delusion.</hi>
4. Where Gospel truths are not received in love
and made use of as they ought, absurd and mon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>strous
<pb n="373" facs="tcp:61385:192"/>
errours will be ere long received, and be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieved
for truths; for, because they received not
the love of the truth, they are given up of God <hi>to
believe a lye.</hi> 5. When the Lord, in his holy
justice, giveth loose reins unto Satan to tempt a
sinner, and withdraweth from him his restraining
grace, there is no sin so irrational or absurd to
which the man so plagued of God will not run,
if it were even to receive most gross absurdities
for divine truths, and to believe them with a kind
of firm assent beyond all doubt or suspicion; for,
their believing lyes is here foretold as the conse<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quence
of Gods sending <hi>them strong delusion,</hi> even
that <hi>they should believe a lye.</hi>
               </p>
               <q>Ver. 12. That they all might be damned, who
believed not the truth, but had pleasure in un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>righteousness.</q>
               <p>He describeth the Antichrists followers, fourth<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly,
from that judgement which followeth upon their
sin, and is intended to be brought about by God as
the end of his sending them strong delusion; for,
the context, shewing the result of this purpose from
the former, implyeth so much; and the judgement
is, <hi>they shall all be damned,</hi> to wit, all guilty, in
the way mentioned upon <hi>v.</hi> 10. of the former
sins; which, for further clearing of Gods justice, he
doth here again repeat, 1. That which is spoken
of <hi>v. 10. their not believing the truth,</hi> after they
had heard it; to wit, the truth of the Gospel,
(see the Gospel so called, and for what reasons
upon <hi>Eph. 1. 13. doct. 4.)</hi> Next, that which is ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pressed
<pb n="374" facs="tcp:61385:193"/>
                  <hi>v.</hi> 11. here called <hi>their taking pleasure in
unrighteousness,</hi> that is, false and unrighteous do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrine
(see upon <hi>v. 10.)</hi> to which they did not
only give their assent and approbation, but also did
find much inward satisfaction, and had an inex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pressible
delight and pleasure in it (as the word
signifieth) and in all the woful consequences of un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>righteousness
both to God and man, to which it
tended; and therefore they should be without ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cuse,
and dying impenitent, be damned without
remedy. <hi>Doct.</hi> 1. Though some sins and errours
be a necessary result of Gods judicial giving up a
man to the power of tentation and delusion, as said
is; yet they cease not to be sin, obliging the guilty
party to undergo eternal wrath, no less than any
other sin; and that because their former sins have
justly procured that they should be so given up of
God: and though God in his justice doth punish
sin with sin; yet the sinner doth alwayes delight
in sin, as being the matter of his voluntary choice;
for, he shews they shall be damned for believing
a lye, though the Lord being provoked, as said is,
by their former sins, had sent them strong delusion,
and that <hi>because they took pleasure in unrighteous<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness.
That they all might be damned,</hi> saith he.
2. It is a manifest untruth that every man shall be
saved in his own Religion, and that it is no hazard
for a man to be of any Religion, if so he follow his
conscience, believing what he thinks to be truth,
and walk according to the principles of that Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion
which he professeth and believeth to be of
God; for, here it is foretold that the devout fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowers
of Antichristian lies, though they did be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve
<pb n="375" facs="tcp:61385:193"/>
them to be truths, yet, should be damned.
<hi>That they all might be damned.</hi> 3. Multitudes of
sinners concurring in one and the same guilt doth
neither lessen the guilt nor make God either,
through fear abate, or from pitty moderate the
deserved punishment; for, here it is foretold that
<hi>they shall all be damned.</hi> 4. That a man do sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vingly
believe the Gospel, it is not sufficient that
he assent to the truth of it in his judgement, but
he must also embrace and receive the good things
offered by it in his will and affections, and that
from love to it; for, that which he called the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiving
of truth in love, <hi>v.</hi> 10. he calleth believ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
the truth here. <hi>Who believed not the truth.</hi>
5. As no men, no not the worst of men, become
extreamly evil at first, but by certain steps ascend
toward that height of sin at which they do at last
arrive; So when a man doth not only commit
sin, but takes pleasure in it, maketh his boast of
it, it speaks him at the very height of sin, and
near a dreadful downfal in the pit of condemna<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion;
if Gods mercy by giving speedy repen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance
prevent it not; for, several steps are here
implyed, their not <hi>receiving truth,</hi> their <hi>believ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
untruth,</hi> and the height of all, and nearest
cause of their being damned, is, <hi>their taking
pleasure in unrighteousness.</hi> 6. A man deluded
with errour may for a time find much seeming
peace of conscience, quietness of spirit, soul-sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tisfaction
and delight flowing from those erro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neous
doctrines which he believeth for truth:
and the more of this kind a man doth find in
the way of errour, he is the more deluded, and
<pb n="376" facs="tcp:61385:194"/>
his guilt the greater; for, their <hi>taking pleasure
in unrighteousness,</hi> or in unrighteous doctrine,
is spoken of as the utmost effect of that strong
delusion sent them, <hi>v.</hi> 11. and the highest step
of their sin.</p>

                           <head>A necessary Appendix containing the ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plication
of this Prophecy, and disco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vering
who this Antichrist is.</head>
                           <p>HAving thus explained this dark Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phesie,
and made such doctrinal ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plication
of it as every verse apart did
offer; it now remaineth that for the
more full understanding of the present Scripture,
a discovery be made, who is this man of sin, that
great Antichrist, whom the spirit of God doth
here so fully describe; which the event, time,
and experience, the surest commentaries for un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derstanding
dark prophesies, have now made so
fully clear, that those who have eyes may see the
truth of that assertion which hath been maintained
almost in every age, and now by all the Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formed
Divines. Whereby it is affirmed, That
the Pope of <hi>Rome,</hi> ever since he usurped that ful<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness
of power in all causes both humane and Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vine
which he hath now for a long time enjoyed,
hath been, and yet is that man of sin, that Child
of perdition, the very Antichrist here described;
And that because all the characters of this man of
sin, and every passage of this prophesie is verified
in the Pope, as shall be made appear by taking a
review of every verse.</p>
                           <p>
                              <pb n="378" facs="tcp:61385:195"/>
And first, The third verse is verified in him; for,
first, the Church of <hi>Rome,</hi> whereof the Pope is
head, hath made defection from the doctrine of
faith, and purity of worship held forth in the Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>spel,
as appears from all the controverted points
betwixt us and them; which apostasie did spread
it self over the face of the whole visible Church,
even as the apostasie here foretold to be under the
Antichrist, <hi>except there come a falling away.</hi>
2. The Pope did not pretend to such power over
the<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> Church of Christ, as he now exerciseth, in
<hi>Pauls</hi> time. Their own Historians grant he
claimed not the title of universal Bishop, nor
power of both swords, and supream authority over
general counsels, until some centuries of years
were past. Even as the Antichrist of whom it is
here foretold, he had not then revealed himself by
exercising open tyranny over the Church of Christ<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
                              <hi>And that man of sin be revealed,</hi> saith he. 3. The
Pope is a <hi>man,</hi> though not an individual person
without succession, yet <hi>de jure</hi> alwayes but <hi>one</hi>
at one and the same time, and a continued series
and succession of men in one and the same Chair,
driving forward one and the same design, even in
that sense wherein I proved in the Exposition that
the Antichrist is here called a man in the singular
number. 4. The Pope is <hi>a man of sin,</hi> first,
in his own person. It is almost incredible what
monsters of men, for horrible crimes of murder,
adultery, simony, sorcery, incest, sodomy, even
Popish Historians do relate many of their own
Popes to have been. 2. In causing others to sin,
in so far as he not only perswadeth and forceth
<pb n="379" facs="tcp:61385:195"/>
men to Idolatry and superstition, under the name
of commanded worship, as <hi>Jeroboam</hi> did, but also
for money dispenseth in some cases with murder,
fornication, incest, and selleth pardons for any sin
unto those who have sufficient money wherewith
to buy them. This is not denyed by themselves,
even as the Antichrist who is here called the <hi>man
of sin.</hi> Fifthly, The Pope is the <hi>Son of perdition:</hi>
First, one who is destinate to destruction himself,
as the Godless life and monstrous sins of many
Popes have declared them to be, whatever the
Lord may do in mercy to some, and those but very
few particular Popes, whose lives have not been
so grosly vicious as the rest, if so he have given
them repentance for their abominable errours.
2. One who destroyeth others both in their souls
by damnable doctrines, idolatries and superstiti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons,
and in their bodies in so far as his cruel per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>secutions,
upon men and women, for conscience
have, for length of time, multitudes of those who
have suffered by him, and the cruel manner of his
persecuting, by exquisite tortures, bloody massa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cres,
surpassed far all other persecutions, that
ever were; Even as the Antichrist, who is here
called in those same respects <hi>the son of perdition.</hi>
                           </p>
                           <p>Secondly, whatever is affirmed of the Antichrist
<hi>v.</hi> 4. is verified in the Pope: For, first, under
pretence and colour of friendship, he is an emi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nent
opposite and adversary to Christ, as in many
other things, so, chiefly, in his threefold office.
1. In his Kingly office, while he destroyeth his
subjects, dispenseth with his Laws, maketh them
of none effect by his traditions, enacteth Laws of
<pb n="380" facs="tcp:61385:196"/>
his own, to bind the conscience, of equal autho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity
with, yea and some of them point-blank op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>posite
unto, the laws of Christ, as in his forbid<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding
marriage to Church-men, discharging the use
of the Cup at the Lords Supper. 2. In his Priest<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
office, while he maketh himself an high Priest
under the new Testament, denyeth the fulness of
Christs satisfaction and intercession, alledging that
they must be supplyed by the merits and intercessi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
of the Virgin <hi>Mary,</hi> Saints and Angels, and
teaching people to give them Religious worship
for that end. 3. In his prophetical office, while
he teacheth that the Scriptures are imperfect, and
as a false Prophet doth teach contrary to what was
taught by Christ, in the doctrine of merit, purga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tory,
indulgences, work of supererogation, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> so
that he opposeth Christ in all his offices, and this
for a greater length of time, with more universal
success, and more formidable force, than ever any
heretick did before him; even as the Antichrist,
who is here said <hi>to oppose himself.</hi> Secondly, The
Pope exalts himself above all Kings and Empe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rours,
while he teacheth he hath absolute power
to dispose of Kingdoms and Empires to whom he
will, at least in order to the Churches good, and
actually hath dethroned Kings and other Magi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>strates,
absolving their Subjects from their oath of
allegiance; doth make the Emperour to hold his
stirrup when he is to ride, and will have him to
count it a favour to have access to kiss his feet,
yea and sometimes hath trampled upon the Empe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rours
neck, being humbly prostrate before him to
beg his favour and reconciliation with him (all
<pb n="381" facs="tcp:61385:196"/>
which are avowed and granted) Even as the An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tichrist,
of whom it is here said, <hi>he exalteth him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>self
above all that is called God, or is worshipped.</hi>
See the Exposition. Thirdly, The Pope, in
managing his rule and government over the Church
of God, pretendeth to no less than divine authority,
even the same with God and Christ, whose great
Vice-gerent and Vicar-general on earth he giveth
out himself to be. Besides, it is expresly affirmed
by Popish writers that the Pope sitting in and teach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
from his Chair, cannot err, and his determi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nations
are of equal certainty with the doctrine of
Christ himself. Even as the Antichrist, of whom
it is here said, that he shall carry himself <hi>as God.</hi>
Fourthly, The Pope doth sit and exercise an abso<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lute
fixed and illimited power of Government over
a society of men which once were Gods spiritual
Temple and Church, and do yet bear that name,
and are so in effect, if we speak of that small rem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant
which in all ages the Lord made to keep their
garments clean from soul-ruining Antichristian er<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rours,
or if we speak of the whole bulk and body
of them, not absolutely, but, as being compared
with Turks<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> Jews and Heathens, in so far as they
still retain some relicts of a Church, as the written
word, Sacraments, Ordination, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> though mise<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rably
corrupted by false glosses; a number of Su<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perstitious,
Idolatrous, and Antichristian additions;
In which respects the Church and See of <hi>Rome</hi>
may be called the Temple and Church of God,
wherein the Pope doth sit and rule, even as it is
here foretold of Antichrist, that he should <hi>sit in
the Temple of God.</hi> Fifthly, The Pope attempts
<pb n="382" facs="tcp:61385:197"/>
to shew that he is in nothing less to be esteemed
of than God, by taking and suffering to be ascribed
unto himself, 1. Divine titles, as <hi>our Lord God the
Pope, universal Pastor, chief High-Priest; Head
of the Catholick Church.</hi> 2. Divine worship, as
Prostration to him, Adoration of him, upon opini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
of some transcendent sanctity in him, and that
he hath fulness of power to forgive sins, bestow
Heaven, and damn to Hell. 3. Divine properties,
as that he cannot err, is the Judge of all men, and
himself can be judged by no man, hath power, as
Christs Vicar, to dispence with all Law, can for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>give
not only sins past, but for a lease of years yet
to come; even as the Antichrist, of whom it is
here foretold, he should <hi>shew himself that he is
God.</hi>
                           </p>
                           <p>Thirdly, Whatever is affirmed of the Anti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>christ,
<hi>v.</hi> 6, 7. is verified also in the Pope: for,
first, It was the Popes power, the growth whereof
in <hi>Rome</hi> and Christendome was hindred by the
Roman Empire, and which advanced by little and
little towards its full height, as the credit, power
and authority of that Empire did weaken and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cay.
The truth whereof is abundantly confirmed
by History, and acknowledged by Papists them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves.
Even as it is here foretold that the credit
and authority of the Roman Empire did for a long
time retard the Antichrists growing greatness, and
that the Antichrists power should rise upon the
ruines of that Empire. <hi>Ye know what withholdeth
that he might be revealed,</hi> and <hi>he will lett untill he
be taken out of the way.</hi> See the Exposition. Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>condly,
A great many of Popish errours were al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ready
<pb n="383" facs="tcp:61385:197"/>
hatched in the Apostles time, as that men are
not justified by faith only, but also by works, <hi>Gal.
2.</hi> 16. that we must commend our selves to God
by the Ministry of Angels, and for that end give
them religious worship, <hi>Col.</hi> 2. 18. that we must
abstain from certain kinds of meat, <hi>Col.</hi> 2. 21. and
Church-men from marriage; that we ought to sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject
our selves to the wills of men in the use of
things indifferent, <hi>Col.</hi> 2. 20. and that superiority
of power in one Church-man over the rest is a
thing convenient and desirable, 3 <hi>Joh.</hi> 9. which,
and such like Popish errours, did then work se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cretly
and under ground, towards that height of
credit and authority which they afterwards at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tained.
Even as it is here shewn that the <hi>mysterie</hi>
of Antichristian tyranny and doctrine did <hi>work
already</hi> in <hi>Pauls</hi> time. Thirdly, popish errours,
though most gross in themselves, yet are covered
over with such fair pretences, that hardly can the
poyson which lurketh in them be at first discerned,
unity is pleaded for, as the foundation of their
Hierarchy, a pretext is made of humility, for
pressing the invocation of Saints and Angels, and
of sending our suits by their mediation to God,
Their doctrine of merit and justification by works,
and not by faith only, is pressed as the only mean
of exciting to diligence in duty, and especially in
the works of charity, They press Pilgrimages,
Penances, Abstinence from meats, voluntary po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verty,
vows to lead a single life, under the plau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sible
pretexts of attaining thereby to more than
ordinary sanctity, mortification of the flesh, and
such like; Even as the Antichristian doctrine and
<pb n="384" facs="tcp:61385:198"/>
tyranny is here called a mysterie, <hi>The mysterie of
iniquity doth already work:</hi> See the Exposition.
And Fourthly, Whatever Popish doctrine, as it is
popish, pretend to, of more than ordinary sanctity,
yet the native issue and result of all in those who
do receive it, is nothing else but impiety and ini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quity.
Their vows of voluntary poverty do, in
the nature of the thing, drive them to idleness,
beggery, and to live upon the labours of others:
vows of leading a single life are accompanied with
Fornications, Adulteries and all manner of unclean<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness,
in those who have not the gift of continency.
Their vows of blind and absolute obedience to their
superiours do drive them to murther Kings, and
perpetrate other most desperate villanies, and to
think they merit Heaven by so doing, if their su<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>periours
do enjoyn them. Their strictest Penan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces,
Pilgrimages and Fastings from certain meats,
on certain dayes; their auricular Confessions, do
cast them loose to live at a random in other things,
as thinking they have already made satisfaction to
God by those things, and knowing how to make up
with a little pains whatever yet is lacking, even as
the Antichristian doctrine is here called <hi>a mysterie
of iniquity.</hi>
                           </p>
                           <p>Fourthly, Whatever is affirmed of the Antichrist
<hi>v.</hi> 8. is also verified in the Pope: for, first, it is
maintained by his flattering followers, that he is
above Law, taketh Law from none, and giveth Law
unto all: that he may dispence with Gods Law, and
of wrong make right by correcting and changing
the Law, Even as the Antichrist who is here said to
be that <hi>wicked,</hi> or lawless one. 2. The Pope,
<pb n="385" facs="tcp:61385:198"/>
after long wrestling in the dark, hath at last, some
hundreds of years since, attained to an incredible
height of power in the whole Christian world, by
his being possessed with the power of both swords,
but chiefly in the City and Territories of <hi>Rome,</hi>
where he is absolute Lord and Master, ever since
the Roman Empire did lose all interest in <hi>Europe,</hi>
as History doth make clear: Even as the Anti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>christ
is said here to be revealed immediately after
the weakning of the Roman Empire. <hi>And then
shall that wicked be revealed.</hi> To which add,
that seeing the Antichrist must be already come, as
I proved in <hi>doct.</hi> 1. from this verse, what power
is there, or hath been, to whom all his characters
here and elsewhere mentioned do agree so well as
to the Pope? 3. Since the first beginning of Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formation
from Popery, the power and credit of
the Pope hath been much wasted, and by little and
little consumed by the powerful Preaching of the
Gospel, through which his Errours, Tyranny,
Superstitions and Idolatry have been discovered to
the world and openly disavowed by the Reformed
Churches: even as it is here foretold <hi>that the Lord
shall consume</hi> Antichrist <hi>by the breath of his mouth.</hi>
4. However the power and credit of the Pope and
of his erroneous doctrine be much weakned, yet
so many and strong are those Engines which he
employeth to defend his tottering Kingdom, and
so small ground hath been gained upon him these
sixty years last past, that there is little appear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance
he shall meet with a full and final overthrow
in haste, or before the time of Christs second com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing;
even as it is here foretold, there will be some<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>what
<pb n="386" facs="tcp:61385:199"/>
what of Antichrist in the world until then, <hi>which
Christ shall destroy with the brightness of his
coming.</hi>
                           </p>
                           <p>Lastly, Whatever is affirmed of Antichrist,
<hi>v.</hi> 9, 10, 11, 12. is also verified in the Pope; for,
first, Histories do testifie a great many Popes have
come to the Popedom by Sorcery and express co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venanting
with the Devil for that end, by Simony,
by poysoning their Predecessours, or others who
stood in their way, and by such other devilish
arts, wherein, as in several other things, besides
those, Satan hath been extreamly active to ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vance
Popes and Popery; Even as it is here af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firmed
of Antichrist, <hi>whose coming is after the
working of Satan.</hi> 2. A singular mean and help
by which the Pope, and Popish doctrine, have
come to credit and respect in the Christian world,
is, signs and wonders alledged to be wrought by
him, and his followers: this being their usual
way, when other proofs do fail, to fly to miracles
to confirm their superstitions and Idolatries, so
that there is scarcely any famous Church, Image
or statue, or <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                                 <desc>•</desc>
                              </gap>ounder of any new Religious Or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der,
or any Monastery or Religious place which is
not famous by some one or other miracle, and
some of them for many reported to be done by
them, and in them, yea they make the glory of
working Miracles a mark of the true Church:
Even as it is here foretold of Antichrist, that his
<hi>coming,</hi> credit and advancement, should be <hi>with
all power signes, and wonders.</hi> Thirdly, Popish
Miracles are all but false and lying wonders, given
out and supposed only to be such, in so far as,
<pb n="387" facs="tcp:61385:199"/>
1. Some of them are but meer Juglings and found
to be such, as when they affirm their Images to
have spoken, issued drops of blood, and sweat,
that poor souls have come creeping and crying
out of Purgatory, bemoaning their case, which
have either been effectuated immediately by Satan,
or by subtle conveyance and sleight of hand, which
hath sometimes been discovered, and the spirit
taken, whipt and laid in the stocks for his impo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sture.
2. Some of them have been truly done,
but not true Miracles, as not exceeding the power
of all natural causes, as when they affirm that
some diseases have been cured by the touch of
their superstitious Relicts; now how easie is it for
Satan to take off and cure a disease, which,
through Gods permission, he hath laid on? espe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cially
seeing many such like seemingly miraculous
cures have been effectuated by devilish art among
the Heathens. And 3. All of them are made use
of to confirm their erroneous doctrines <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 word">
                                 <desc>〈◊〉</desc>
                              </gap> su<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perstitious
practices, as their worshipping of Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>licts,
prayer for the dead, invocation of Saints, Pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gatory,
<hi>&amp;c.</hi> and consequently all of them but false
and seeming Miracles; even as it is here foretold of
Antichrist, that <hi>his coming should be—with signs
and lying wonders.</hi> Fourthly, The Popish do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrine,
wherein it differs from the doctrine of the
Reformed Churches, is nothing but an heap of
untruths, driving the maintainers of it to impiety
against God, in Idolatry, superstition, breach of
vows, and perjuries, and to unrighteousness against
man in unnaturality, disobedience to Parents, and
lawful superiours, under religious pretexts, in pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferring
<pb n="388" facs="tcp:61385:200"/>
Fornication and Uncleanness to the bed
undefiled in Marriage, in justifying Jesuitical equi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vocations,
and speaking, yea and swearing untruths,
and such like, which hath been abundantly made
out by the Reformed Divines in their writings to
that purpose: even as the doctrine of the Anti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>christ
is here called <hi>unrighteousness,</hi> or a doctrine
of untruths tending to unrighteousness and sin of
all sorts. Fifthly, The Pope doth not avow or
profess himself an enemy to truth and Christian
Religion, but rather the prime pillar of it, even
Christs Vicar on earth, the servant of the servants
of Christ, by which and such like specious pretexts
he hath undermined truth, and established errour
in its place: even as it is here foretold of the An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tichrist
that he should not openly avow his do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrine
to be contrary to Gospel truth, but labour
by deceitful tricks and fair pretexts to make the
world believe his doctrine to be truth, <hi>even by
all de<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="3 letters">
                                    <desc>•••</desc>
                                 </gap>veableness of unrighteousness.</hi> Sixthly,
Innumerable almost are those subtle devices and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiving
juglings, which are made use of under
Papacy to perswade the world to embrace their
erroneous and unrighteous doctrine, such as,
strong and false alledgances of their unity among
themselves under one head, of the antiquity of
their doctrine, the consent of Fathers to it, the
universality of it, which is no more in effect but
that all the world did once wonder after the Beast,
<hi>Rev.</hi> 13. 3. Besides that their doctrine and wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ship
is so framed, as to comply with mens cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rupt
Lusts, and to fit every humour. If men be
lazy idlers, they place them in Monasteries, if am<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bitious
<pb n="389" facs="tcp:61385:200"/>
or covetous, there are places of preferment
and profit to catch them; if voluptuous and li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>centious,
they may for a little money have par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dons
and dispensations, if quiet and cannot endure
the worlds trouble, there is a solitary life in some
Hermitage prepared for them: If a man dislike
his wife, let him enter Religious Orders, and he
is delivered from her; If of a pragmatick stirring
disposition, there are employments of compassing
Sea and Land to gain a proselyte waiting for him.
There are flatteries, and taking allurements for
men of spirit, who will not be boasted, and boasts
and threats of curses and excommunications for
men of a more folding temper: In a word, what<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever
a mans humour can fancy, there is somewhat
in Popery to satisfie it, and make men believe of
themselves that they are singularly devout, when
they do but feed their carnal humours; Even as
it is here foretold of the Antichrist that he should
come not with some, but, <hi>all deceiveableness of
unrighteousness.</hi> Seventhly, Though the power
of the Pope, for many ages, was most dreadful
and absolute through all <hi>Europe,</hi> yet it was not
unlimited; there being alwayes some in every age
(as Papists themselves do sometimes confess and
History maketh clear) who never yielded to take
on his yoke, but one way or other testified against
his Tyrannical Usurpation, and damnable soul-de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stroying
doctrine: even as it is here foretold that
some should be exempted from the Antichrists de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fection,
for he was only to prevail in <hi>those who
perish.</hi> Eighthly, The members of the Popish
Church had in all ages the truth of the Gospel
<pb n="390" facs="tcp:61385:201"/>
tendred to them, at the first beginning of the
Popes apostasie and open tyranny more clearly,
in following ages more darkly, what, by some<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>what
they heard of Christs Nativity, Passion, Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>surrection,
<hi>&amp;c.</hi> expounded to them, according to
the custome, at their great Festivals, and what by the
testimony or report of that testimony which dy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
Martyrs or other Confessours gave to truth,
whereof there were some almost in every age:
and yet they did not receive or believe the truth,
especially those truths relating to the authority,
sufficiency, and perfection of Scripture, to the
fulness of Christs satisfaction and merit, and the
compleat discharging of all his offices, the justifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cation
of sinners by the righteousness of Christ
imputed to them and received by faith alone, and
such other truths controverted betwixt them and
us: yea neither believe they any truth because of
the authority of God revealing it in Scripture,
but because of the Popes Authority, which only
makes Scripture to be Scripture, and worthy of
credit unto them, and therefore cannot be said to
believe any truth at all, seeing their faith is only
humane, grounded upon the authority of man;
even as it is here foretold of Antichrists follow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers,
that <hi>they received not the truth in love,</hi>
when it was offer<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                                 <desc>•</desc>
                              </gap>d to them, and that <hi>they
believed not the truth.</hi> Ninthly, Hugely gross
errours and superstitious fooleries are main<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tained
by the Pope and his followers, for neces<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sary
truths, and acceptable pieces of Divine Wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ship,
as may be seen in their Apish toyes, foolish
gestures used at Mass, in their doctrine of Tran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>substantiation,
<pb n="391" facs="tcp:61385:201"/>
and indulgences; and such is their
incorrigible obstinacy in these, against clear evi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence
of Scripture, yea and of common sense and
reason, that it cannot be conceived rational men
would be so infatuated and stupid, except they were
judicially plagued of God, by giving them over to
the power and prevalency of errour and delusion,
even as it is here affirmed of Antichrists followers,
<hi>that God shall send them strong delusion that they
should believe a lye.</hi> Tenthly, As Popish doctrine,
wherein it differeth from us, is but a bundle of lies,
which is abundantly proved by the Reformed Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vines;
So this doctrine of lies is believed by the
generality of the Popish Church as the very truth
of God, with a firm assent and without all con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary
doubt; so that some of them being given
over to the power of delusion will choose to dye
for it, at least to suffer loss of goods before they
recede from it; Even as it is here foretold of
Antichrists followers, that <hi>God shall send them
strong delusion that they should believe a lye.</hi>
Eleventhly, Many of the Popes deluded follow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers
have their consciences so seared, that they
rest their souls upon the faith of Popish errours,
draw a kind of comfort and satisfaction from
them, and have an infinite delight in the most
<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                                 <desc>•</desc>
                              </gap>ond and foolish of all their superstitious perfor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mances,
as thinking they thereby do God good
service: Even as it is here foretold of Anti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>christs
followers that <hi>they should have pleasure
in unrighteousness,</hi> or erroneous and unrighteous
doctrine.</p>
                           <p>
                              <pb n="392" facs="tcp:61385:202"/>
And now to shut up this second part of the
Chapter, I may confidently resume the former
assertion, as a clear conclusion from what is al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ready
said, that seeing all the characters of the
man of sin, here described, are verified in the
Pope of <hi>Rome,</hi> ever since he usurped the fulness
of power in all causes both humane and Divine,
which he hath now for a long<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                                 <desc>•</desc>
                              </gap>time exercised,
therefore he hath been, and yet is that <hi>man of
sin,</hi> that <hi>child of perdition,</hi> and the very Anti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>christ,
who is here described.</p>
                        </div>
                     </body>
                  </floatingText>
               </p>
               <pb n="393" facs="tcp:61385:202"/>
               <q>Ver. 13. But we are bound to give thanks alway
to God for you, brethren, beloved of the Lord,
because God hath from the beginning chosen you
to salvation, through sanctification of the spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit,
and belief of the truth.</q>
               <p>The Apostle, in the third part of the Chapter,
doth comfort and confirm those believing <hi>Thessalo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nians,</hi>
and in them all sincere believers through all
Ages, against the terrour of the forementioned
dreadful Prophecy; and this three wayes. The
first, (which is propounded by way of thanksgiv<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
to God, see <hi>chap. 1. 3.)</hi> is the certainty of
their salvation, grounded upon Gods decree of
their election, whereby he had <hi>chosen them</hi> (passing
by others as the word implyeth) to the enjoying
of salvation, or perfect blessedness in Heaven,
1 <hi>Pet.</hi> 1. 2, 4. which decree of election is described
from several things, which do all of them con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duce
to their confirmation and establishment.
1. From the cause moving God to it, implyed in
the word <hi>beloved,</hi> It was nothing without himself
(see upon <hi>Eph. 1. 4. doct. 7.)</hi> but his love to
them, which made him choose them. 2. From its
antiquity, It was <hi>from the beginning,</hi> or, from
eternity, as he explains himself, <hi>Eph. 1. 4.
3.</hi> From the means <hi>through</hi> which it is brought
to execution, first, <hi>sanctification</hi> wrought in them
by the <hi>spirit</hi> of God, mentioned before faith
(though it be a fruit of faith, <hi>Act. 15. 9.)</hi> because
it doth first appear to us. <hi>James 2—18.</hi> (See
what this sanctification is, upon 1 <hi>Thes. 4. 3—)</hi>
                  <pb n="394" facs="tcp:61385:203"/>
2. <hi>Belief</hi> and faith (see what this grace is, 1 <hi>Thes.
1. v. 3.)</hi> called <hi>belief of the truth,</hi> because it hath
respect unto, and relyeth upon the truth, chiefly of
the Gospel, <hi>Mark</hi> 1. 15. in which Christ is offer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed,
1 <hi>Tim. 3. 16. Doct.</hi> 1. As the truly Godly,
beloved of God, do most suspect their own strength,
and are most afraid of their own weakness, upon
hearing of approaching tryals, when the unrenew<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
fool rageth and is confident, <hi>Prov.</hi> 14. 16. So it
is the duty of Christs Ministers to provide the
Lords people with suitable and seasonable grounds
of consolation from the word of truth to under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prop
them, lest their suspicions and fears do end in
heartless fainting and discouragement; for, <hi>Paul</hi>
foreseeing that the Godly would be most afraid at
the terrour of the former Prophecy, doth set him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>self
to comfort and confirm them. <hi>But we are
bound,</hi> &amp;c. 2. It is the duty of those who have
obtained mercy from the Lord, so to look upon
the dreadful Judgements, Spiritual or Temporal,
which are inflicted by God upon others, as that
they may therein read, and thankfully acknowledge
their own obligation unto the Lord who dealeth
otherwayes with them; for, <hi>Paul,</hi> being to menti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
the preservation of those believing <hi>Thessaloni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans</hi>
from the dreadful judgements formerly spoken
of, will not do it but by way of thanksgiving to
God, that therein they may see their own duty.
<hi>But we are bound to give thanks to God alway for
you.</hi> 3. The more of sanctifying grace, and of
other testimonies of Gods special love, is bestowed
upon a people, the greater obligation is thereby laid
upon their faithful Pastors to bless the Lord on
<pb n="395" facs="tcp:61385:203"/>
their behalf; for, <hi>Paul</hi> seeth himself bound to
give thanks to God, because God had <hi>chosen</hi> them,
<hi>&amp;c.</hi> See more upon this ground, <hi>chap.</hi> 1. 3. But,
4. The more a man is beloved of God, he will be
the more afraid of Antichrists apostasie, and may
the more confidently expect that he shall be pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>served
from it; for, they were <hi>beloved,</hi> whom <hi>Paul</hi>
suppones here to be most afraid, and whom he here
confirms, and partly from this that they were <hi>be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>loved</hi>
of the Lord. 5. As the elect are above the
peril of total and final apostasie; So the ground and
reason of their preservation from it is not in them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves,
in the strength or firmness of their resoluti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons,
but in the Lords unchangeable decree, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by
he hath chosen them to eternal life. This is
that foundation of the Lord which standeth sure,
2 <hi>Tim.</hi> 2. 19. and therefore they cannot so fall
as to perish; for, he confirms them against the
fears of falling away, from their election. <hi>Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause
God hath from the beginning chosen you to
salvation.</hi> 6. It is the Lords allowance that the
Godly elect should study to make their election
sure, and attain to the assurance of it, as that which
proveth a powerful preservative, as against other
sins, 2 <hi>Pet.</hi> 1. 10. so, chiefly, against Antichristian
errours; for if they do not attain to the know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge
of their election, how can they draw com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fort
and matter of confirmation from it, as the Lord
alloweth them to do here? <hi>because God hath from
the beginning chosen you to salvation.</hi> 7. As
Gods decree of election before time, is accompa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nied
with the fruits of saving grace in the elect,
begotten in them by the spirit of God in time;
<pb n="396" facs="tcp:61385:204"/>
So it is neither possible, nor yet needful, for at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taining
the knowledge of our election, to dive into
the depth of Gods eternal decree about us, at the
first step, but we are to search and try, if those
fruits and effects of Gods electing love, be yet
wrought in us, and from these conclude that we
are elected; for, the Apostle speaks of faith and
sanctification as the fruits of election, by which,
and by effectual calling mentioned <hi>v.</hi> 14. a man
may gather he is elected: <hi>he hath chosen us
through sanctification and belief.</hi> 8. As the Lord
will infallibly bestow salvation upon the elect, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause
he hath chosen them to it, and the counsel of
the Lord must stand, <hi>Prov.</hi> 19. 21. So he be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stoweth
salvation upon none who are destitute of
faith and sanctification, the means appointed of
God for leading to it; <hi>he hath chosen you to sal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vation,</hi>
saith he, <hi>through sanctification and belief.</hi>
9. Whomsoever God hath elected to salvation, he
hath also, in that same decree, elected them to faith
and sanctification, and therefore the foresight of
those was not a motive inducing God to elect one
more than another; they were good things de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>creed
to be given unto us, and consequently were
not foreseen to be in us before he decreed them for
us: <hi>for, he hath chosen you to salvation through
sanctification and belief.</hi> 10. As faith and sancti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fication
go alwayes together, the former being the
fountain of the latter, and the latter again an evi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence
of the former, <hi>Gal. 5—6.</hi> So the moti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons
of Gods sanctifying spirit are alwayes con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>form
to Gods rev<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>aled truth, and directed by truth
as it is apprehended by faith, and all other mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions
<pb n="397" facs="tcp:61385:204"/>
which are not such, are not of God, what<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever
they pretend to, <hi>Isa.</hi> 8. 20. for, he joynes
<hi>sanctification of the spirit</hi> and <hi>belief of the truth</hi>
together.</p>
               <q>Ver. 14. Whereunto he called you by our Gospel, to
the obtaining of the glory of our Lord Jesus
Christ.</q>
               <p>For their further comfort and confirmation from
the former ground, he doth here give an evidence
that God had chosen them to salvation; even this
that God had effectually <hi>called</hi> them, or having
renewed their wills <hi>(Ezek. 26. 27.)</hi> had by his
omnipotent power, <hi>(Phil. 6. 44, 45.)</hi> made them
willingly apply themselves <hi>(Psal. 110. 3.)</hi> to the
attaining of those things <hi>whereunto</hi> they were
called, to wit, salvation, sanctification and faith
mentioned <hi>v.</hi> 13. to which the first word of this
verse doth relate. Which effectual calling is set
forth. 1. From the external mean, by which it
had been brought about, to wit, the Preaching of
the Gospel called <hi>Pauls Gospel,</hi> because he was en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trusted
with the dispensing of it to them, 1 <hi>Thes.
2.</hi> 4. next, from the utmost end of their calling;
to wit, their <hi>obtaining</hi> that <hi>glory</hi> in Heaven, which
the <hi>Lord Christ</hi> hath purchased, and the same, in
some respect, for kind, though not for measure,
with that which he himself enjoyeth, <hi>Phil. 3. 21<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
1 Cor. 6. 2, 3. Doct.</hi> 1. A man can draw no com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fort
or confirmation from Gods decree of electing
him to salvation through sanctification and faith,
except he actually apply himself to walk in the
<pb n="398" facs="tcp:61385:205"/>
way which leadeth to salvation; for, he makes
the strength of the former consolation and confir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mation
lye in this, that they were effectually called
to sanctification, and consequently had betaken
themselves to walk in that way, <hi>whereunto he called
you.</hi> 2. It is not in the power of fallen man to
do so much of himself, though Heaven be offered
and the way chalked out, which leadeth to it, as
to betake himself to walk in it, except the Lord
encline him powerfully so to do, and by his omni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>potent
arm draw him that so he may run after him;
<hi>Cant.</hi> 1. 4— for, he saith it was the <hi>Lord,
who called them thereunto.</hi> 3. However this
effectual excitation of sinners, and engaging them
to enter the way of salvation, be the work of God
alone; yet he maketh use of the Gospel Preach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
by his sent Ministers, as an outward mean, at
or after the Preaching whereof he ordinarily doth
work powerfully in the hearts of the elect: for,
he saith, <hi>whereunto he called you by our Gospel.</hi>
4. As the state of salvation, to which the elect
are chosen, is altogether glorious, comprising
what eye hath not seen nor ear heard, nor ever
entred into the heart of man to think upon, 1 <hi>Cor.
2.</hi> 9. So the glory to be enjoyed in that state, is
the result, not of our endeavours or merit, but of
Christs purchase, and a piece of that glory which
Christ in his humane nature enjoyeth, who hath
gone to Heaven for this very end, that where he
is there we may be; <hi>Joh.</hi> 14. 3. for, therefore is
it called <hi>the glory of our Lord Jesus Christ</hi> to
the obtaining whereof we are called. 5. Though
Heaven and glory be purchased by Christ and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>signed
<pb n="399" facs="tcp:61385:205"/>
for the elect in Gods eternal and un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>changeable
decree, (see <hi>v. 13.)</hi> yet none at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taineth
to the actual possession of it, but such as
are effectually called and drawn out of nature to
the state of grace, and all such shall at last attain it,
grace here being a most infallible forerunner of
glory hereafter: for, he saith he hath <hi>called you to
the obtaining of glory.</hi>
               </p>
               <q>Ver. 15. Therefore, brethren, stand fast, and hold
the traditions which ye have been taught, whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
by word, or our Epistle.</q>
               <p>He confirms them, Secondly, by exhorting them
that <hi>therefore,</hi> to wit, because there was an apostasie
to be <hi>v.—3.</hi> and Gods electing love was made
known unto them, <hi>v.</hi> 13, 14. that therefore, I say,
they would stand fast and constant in the truth with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out

                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap> as stout souldiers, (from
whom the word is borrowed) which he further
explaineth by exhorting them <hi>to hold,</hi> as it were
by both hands, and against all opposition, <hi>the tra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ditions,</hi>
or things delivered by him (as the word
signifieth) to wit, the exhortations and doctrines
both concerning faith and manners, which they
had received from him and <hi>were taught</hi> by him,
<hi>whether by word,</hi> when he was present with them
and preached to them, or by this and the former
<hi>Epistle</hi> written by him, when he was absent from
them. <hi>Doct.</hi> 1. The doctrine of election, and as<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>surance
of salvation grounded upon election, doth
not make exhortations to duty, reproofs and threat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nings
in case of neglect of duty, of no effect and
<pb n="400" facs="tcp:61385:206"/>
useless; In so far as those are means appointed by
God for making the elect persevere in the way
which leadeth unto that salvation, to which they
are appointed: for, notwithstanding of what he
wrote of election and the infallible evidence of their
election, <hi>v.</hi> 13, 14. he doth here exhort them <hi>to stand
fast and hold the traditions.</hi> 2. As the dreadful<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness
of approaching hazard should not makes us
lose heart, and sit down discouraged; So the faith
of through-bearing, flowing from assurance of our
election, is so far from being, in its own nature, a
pillow for carnal security, that, upon the contrary,
it doth forcibly encourage and excite to duty in the
face of danger, as knowing our labour shall not be
in vain in the Lord; for, from what he spoke of
the future apostasie, and the evidence they had of
Gods electing love, he exhorts them <hi>therefore bre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thren,
stand fast, and hol<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>.</hi> 3. Even the elect
themselves have been and will be strongly assaulted
by Antichrist, and in no small hazard to be drawn
away with his Antichristian errours, except they
stand fast as men of courage, and employ the ut<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>termost
of their wit and strength to defend the
truth of the Gospel against those dreadful terrours
and subtle snares, which Antichrist and his emissa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries
do make use of to drive them and draw them
from it: for, so much is implyed, while, speaking
to the elect with relation to the assaults of Anti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>christ,
he exhorts them to stand as stout souldiers,
and to hold the truth as it were with both hands
against all opposition, as the word signifieth, <hi>there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore,
b<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>ethren, stand fast and hold.</hi> 4. The apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stasie
of many from the truth, and the prevalency
<pb n="401" facs="tcp:61385:206"/>
of errour, is so far from being, in reason, a mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tive
to make us think the less of truth, and to fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low
the drove, that it ought to make us love truth
the better, cleave to it more firmly, and become
more rooted in the faith of it, that so the storm,
which bloweth others up by the roots, may not un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>settle
us; for, from what he spoke of a general
apostasie to come, he exhorts them that <hi>therefore
they would stand fast and hold the traditions.</hi>
5. There is no ground here to establish the au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thority
of Popish unwritten traditions, as a partial
rule of faith and manners, of equal authority with
the written Word of God: for, though some of
those traditions here mentioned were not written
by <hi>Paul</hi> in any of these two Epistles; yet they,
as all other truths necessary to salvation, were com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitted
either before or after this to sacred writ,
2 <hi>Tim. 3. 15, 17. traditions which ye have been
taught whether by word or our Epistle.</hi>
               </p>
               <q>Ver. 16. Now our Lord Jesus Christ himself, and
God even our Father, which hath loved us, and
hath given us everlasting consolation, and good
hope through grace.</q>
               <p>He confirms them thirdly, by praying to God
for them that he would work those things in them
which he was pressing upon them; to wit, com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fort
and constancy. In which prayer, he, first,
layeth down some arguments for strengthning both
his own, and their confidence in expectation of an
answer. The first is taken from that near relation
wherein Christ and God, to whom he prayeth,
<pb n="402" facs="tcp:61385:207"/>
did stand towards them. <hi>Christ himself</hi> being <hi>their
Lord Jesus Christ,</hi> and <hi>God their Father.</hi> The
second from Gods special love to them. The third
from the fruits of his love already enjoyed, 1. Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>solation,
that is ease of mind from, and encourage<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
of spirit against all causes of sorrow; which
is actually attained by real believers at some times,
<hi>Psal.</hi> 27. 1, 2. and all such have sufficient grounds
and reason for it alwayes, <hi>Heb.</hi> 3. 17, 18. and
the meanest measure of it enjoyed by any here is
an earnest of that full and perfect freedom and ease
from all sorrows and weights of sin and misery
which they shall enjoy in Heaven for ever; <hi>Job.
4.</hi> 14. and therefore is it called <hi>everlasting conso<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lation.</hi>
2. <hi>Good hope,</hi> that is, both solid grounds
of hope, and the grace of hope it self whereby we
make use of those grounds, by expecting all the
good things which God hath promised, <hi>Rom.</hi> 8. 25.
which two fruits of love are described from their
common fountain, Gods grace and favour, not on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
without, but contrary to our deserving, <hi>Isa.
64. 6. Doct.</hi> 1. That precepts and exhortations to
duty do not inferr a power in mans free-will to obey,
fee upon 1 <hi>Thes. 5. 23. doct.</hi> 2. for, he here pray<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth
that God would work that in them which he
hath presently pressed upon them. <hi>Now our Lord
Jesus Christ himself,</hi> &amp;c. 2. As it is the Lords
blessing and powerful working of his spirit which
maketh the word Preached, gain ground on hearts,
1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 3. 7. So it is the duty of Ministers, and of
people also, to deal with God in earnest by Prayer
for his promised spirit to accompany the Word
Preached and make it lively, seeing the Lord hath
<pb n="403" facs="tcp:61385:207"/>
undertaken to give his holy spirit unto those who
ask him; <hi>Luk.</hi> 11. 13. for, <hi>Paul,</hi> having pressed
comfort and constancy, doth pray to God that he
would <hi>comfort and establish</hi> them, and thereby
teacheth them to do the like. <hi>Now our Lord Je<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sus
Christ himself,</hi> &amp;c. 3. That a man may stand
fast, especially in trying times, there is more re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quired
than conviction of duty, or a fixed reso<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lution
to stand to his duty, <hi>Matth.</hi> 26. 33, 35.
There must be also a continued influence from the
Lord, of cheerfulness, comfort and courage, other<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wise
all will be to little purpose; for, <hi>Paul</hi> seeth
this necessary, and therefore prayeth for it, <hi>Now
our Lord Jesus Christ himself,</hi> &amp;c. 4. That Je<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sus
Christ is true God equal with the Father ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peareth
from this, that not only he is one who
heareth prayer, the author and bestower of all spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritual
blessings which are here sought from him,
and said to be already bestowed by him, but also
he is named before the Father, which certainly
had been blaspheamous if he were not also true
God. <hi>Now our Lord Jesus Christ himself and
God even our Father,</hi> &amp;c. 5. That Christ is a
distinct person from the Father, though one in
substance with him, appears from this, that they
are here distinguished by <hi>Paul, Now our Lord
Jesus Christ himself, and God even our Father.</hi>
6. That God the Father is usually named before
the Son doth not inferr any inequality betwixt them,
but only the order of subsistence and working
which is among the persons of the blessed Tri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity;
for, here Christ the second person is named
first, to shew there is not any such inequality.
<pb n="404" facs="tcp:61385:208"/>
                  <hi>Now our Lord Jesus Christ himself, and God even
our Father.</hi> 7. That our prayers should be di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rected
unto God only, see upon <hi>Eph. 1. 17.
doct.</hi> 3. for, so doth <hi>Paul</hi> alwayes direct his.
<hi>Now our Lord Jesus Christ himself,</hi> &amp;c. 8. Our
prayers to God should not consist of multiplyed
petitions only, but ought to be fraughted with
such arguments and motives for obtaining what
we ask, as may strengthen our confidence in ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pectation
of an answer; for, such are the Apostles
prayers. <hi>Now our Lord—which hath lo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved
us, and given us,</hi> &amp;c. 9. In seeking things
needful from God, we should look upon him, not
as standing disaffected to us, and at a distance
with us, but according to the nearest relations,
which we can reckon our selves to have unto him;
for, <hi>Paul</hi> eyeth Christ and God as his and their
Christ and Father. <hi>Now our Lord, and God even
<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 word">
                        <desc>〈◊〉</desc>
                     </gap> Father.</hi> 10. The Faith of Gods special love
doth strongly underprop the heart with confidence
of a gracious answer in prayer, as knowing that
love in God is communicative of any thing in God
that is good and needful for the party loved, <hi>Psal.
84.</hi> 11. and that seeing his love hath given Christ,
which is more, he will not withhold that which is
less; <hi>Rom.</hi> 8. 32. for, <hi>Paul</hi> doth strengthen his
confidence from this ground, while he saith, <hi>which
hath loved us.</hi> 11. Our former receipts from
God should be improved as helps and props for
strengthning confidence in expectation of obtaining
yet further from him, even whatever our neces<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sities
call for, and his glory shall require at our
hand: This being the Lords usual way to do good
<pb n="405" facs="tcp:61385:208"/>
because he hath done good; and therefore prayer
should not be wholly stuffed with heartless com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plaints
of what we want, there should be a mix<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture
of humble and thankful acknowledgement
also of what we already have, and an argument
drawn from thence to plead for more; for, so
doth <hi>Paul</hi> here. <hi>Who hath given us everlasting
consolation and good hope.</hi> 12. It is only spiritual
receipts the experience whereof doth alone, and
considered apart from receipts of any other kind,
furnish us thus with an argument where by to plead
with God for more, those only being given as an
earnest of further, <hi>Eph.</hi> 1. 14. which temporal fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vours
are not, but sometimes given of God in
displeasure, and fore-runners of his eternal wrath:
<hi>Psal.</hi> 17. 14. for, it's only spiritual receipts from
which <hi>Paul</hi> doth draw an argument here. <hi>Who
hath given us everlasting consolation, and good
hope.</hi> 13. True and solid consolation against any
thing which causeth grief is only that, which is
accompanied with, and floweth from the well-grounded
and good hope of eternal glory: and
whatever other comfort or joy a man enjoyeth,
it is not lasting, much less everlasting, but endeth
in greater grief; <hi>Eccles.</hi> 7. 6. for, he conjoyneth
these two, <hi>everlasting consolation and good hope.</hi>
14. Then doth experience of by-past receipts
strengthen much our confidence of receiving more,
when we take up Gods free grace and favour
without and contrary to our deserving as the
cause of what hath been bestowed already; In
so far as hereby we find an answer to all those
doubts, which do arise from our present unwor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thiness,
<pb n="406" facs="tcp:61385:209"/>
and misdeservings, even this, The same
free grace which overcame our mis-deservings
then, will overcome them yet; for, <hi>Paul,</hi> while he
makes by-past receipts plead for obtaining further,
doth look on them as flowing from this fountain.
<hi>Who hath given us everlasting consolation, and
good hope through grace.</hi>
               </p>
               <q>Ver. 17. Comfort your hearts, and stablish you in
every good word and work.</q>
               <p>Next, in this prayer is set down what he prayed
for; first, the continuance and increase of the same
comfort, which they had already received, <hi>v.</hi> 16.
next, <hi>establishment,</hi> and constancy; and this, first,
<hi>in every good word,</hi> that is, in the faith of good
and sound doctrine, opposite to Antichristian er<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rour,
1 <hi>Tim.</hi> 4. 6. which agreeth better with the
preceding purpose of the whole Chapter, than
to expone it of their language and discourse. Next,
<hi>in every good work,</hi> or the practice of holiness
in the whole course of their life. See what a
good work is upon <hi>Eph. 2. 10. doct.</hi> 4. Hence learn,
1. That a man may stand stedfast in a trying time,
he should by all means endeavour to keep his heart
in a cheerful frame, by laying hold, with some
measure of confidence, upon such grounds of con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>solation
as the Gospel affords, 1 <hi>Thes.</hi> 4. 18.
habitual discouragement and dejectedness of mind
being the usual forerunner of defection, <hi>Heb. 12.
12,</hi> 13. for, the Apostles pra<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>ing that <hi>God would
comfort and establish them,</hi> shews that a heart
cheered up with the consolations of the Gospel is
<pb n="407" facs="tcp:61385:209"/>
the usual companion of constancy. 2. Not only
are the first beginnings of grace from God, but
also the daily increase and progress of grace in
every degree and step, from the lowest to the
highest; for, having shewn <hi>v.</hi> 16. that God had
given them the beginnings of consolation, he here
prayeth for the increase of it: <hi>comfort your hearts,</hi>
saith he. 3. Stability in the faith of true do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrine
and in the practice of an holy life do mu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tually
contribute, one to another: and errour in
the point of truth is usually accompanied with
some deviation in practice from the rule of an holy
life: and profanity of life doth of it self cast
men loose to the embracing of such errours as
may gratifie their unmortified lusts, 2 <hi>Tim.</hi> 4. 3.
for, he prayeth that God would <hi>stablish them in
every good word and work,</hi> jointly.</p>

               <p>In the second part of the Chapter he concludeth
the Epistle, first, by praying for peace and Gods
presence to them, <hi>v.</hi> 16. next, with his usual fare<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wel-wish,
<hi>v.</hi> 18. Having first shewn for what use he
did always write that part of his Epistles with
his own hand, <hi>v.</hi> 17.</p>
               <q>Ver. 1. FInally brethren, pray for us, that the
word of the Lord may have free
course, and be glorified even as it is with
you.</q>
               <p>The Apostle having made a transition from the
preceding doctrine by the word <hi>finally</hi> (implying
as the Original beareth, there did somewhat yet
remain necessary to be added) doth enter the first
of his exhortations; wherein he beseecheth them
lovingly as <hi>brethren</hi> to <hi>pray</hi> for him and his col<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>legues,
and consequently for all other faithful Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nisters.
Particulars to be prayed for are two:
The first is in this verse, and hath respect unto
the Gospel, here called the <hi>word of the Lord</hi>
(See upon <hi>Phil. 1. 14. doct. 1.)</hi> which is entrust<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
to Ministers, 1 <hi>Thes.</hi> 2. 4. and concerning it,
they were to <hi>pray,</hi> first, that it might <hi>have free
course,</hi> or (as it is in the Original) might <hi>run,</hi>
that is, be speedily propagated far and near, and
<pb n="410" facs="tcp:61385:211"/>
all things removed out of the way which might
hinder its course. Next, that it might be <hi>glorified,</hi>
even as it was with those <hi>Thessalonians,</hi> that is, not
only be mightily prevalent in converting many to
God, whereby the glorious power of God working
by it should be seen and acknowledged, 1 <hi>Cor.
14.</hi> 25. but also the profession of the Gospel
might be adorned with the answerable fruits of an
holy life in those who hear it, which brings no
small glory and credit to the Gospel, <hi>Tit.</hi> 2. 10.
as the profane life of professours doth dishonour it,
2 <hi>Pet. 2. 2. Doct.</hi> 1. See a Doctrine from the
word, <hi>finally,</hi> or <hi>furthermore,</hi> upon 1 <hi>Thes. 4. v. 1.
doct. 4. finally, brethren.</hi> 2. Most eminent Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stians
for gifts and graces are usually most sensible
of their own wants, and so far from undervaluing
others, being compared with themselves, that they
highly prize what worth is in them, and can plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>santly
stoop to receive some spiritual benefit and
advantage from them; for, though <hi>Paul</hi> did ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceed
them all in spiritual induements, yet he most
affectionately seeketh the help of their prayers.
<hi>Finally, brethren, pray for us.</hi> 3. Ministers should
so lay out and employ what stock of gifts and
graces they already have for the good of the Lords
people, as that they jointly endeavour by all means,
of Reading, Meditation, 1 <hi>Tim.</hi> 4. 13, 15—
and of prayer by themselves, 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 7. 5. and of
others, to acquire a new supply of strength and fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niture
for enabling them to their work; lest other<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wise
they run dry, and have little or nothing to say
unto any good <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>urpose, 1 <hi>Tim.</hi> 4. 15. for, <hi>Paul</hi>
having instructed them, and prayed for them in
<pb n="411" facs="tcp:61385:211"/>
the former part of this Epistle, doth now beseech
them to deal with God for a new recruit of fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niture
for him. <hi>Pray for us.</hi> 4. As it is the duty
of Christian brethren mutually to pray for, and
to require the performance of this duty from one
another: So the most effectual way for engaging
others to pray for us, is to make them know we
pray for them, and that we esteem of them as such
whose prayers are somewhat worth; for, <hi>Paul</hi> be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
to crave the help of their prayers, did shew,
<hi>chap. 2. v.</hi> 16. that he prayed for them, and doth
here shew he esteemed them as <hi>brethren,</hi> that here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by
he may engage them. <hi>Brethren pray for us.</hi>
5. The great care of a faithful Minister, and that
which lyeth nearest to his heart, and which of any
other thing he recommendeth most to the care of
others, is, not so much his own personal respect
or preservation from hazard, as the success and
thriving of the Gospel by the blessing of God upon
his pains, and the pains of others; for, this is it
he recommends unto them to be prayed for in the
first place, and the care of his own person but in
the second. <hi>Pray for us,</hi> saith he, <hi>that the word
of the Lord may have free course.</hi> 6. It is the du<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty
of the Lords people and servants not only to
give the Gospel countenance and entertainment
where it already is, but also to have enlarged de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sires,
seconded with the utmost of orderly endea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vours,
for the spreading and propagation of the
Gospel unto those places where it is not; for, this
is it that <hi>Paul</hi> would have them to pray for here,
even <hi>that the word of the Lord may have free course.</hi>
7. So great and many are those obstructions cast in
<pb n="412" facs="tcp:61385:212"/>
by the Devil and men in the way of the Gospels
progress, <hi>Act.</hi> 10 23. that no humane endeavours,
nor any thing else except the omnipotent power of
God, can fully remove them; for, he seeth a ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cessity
of prayer to God, <hi>that the word of the Lord
may have free course.</hi> 8. It is the duty of Mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sters
and people not only to endeavour that the
Gospel may run through the tongues and ears of
many, and outward subjection be rendred to it,
but also that it be received in hearts, and that so
much be testified by the holy life and conversation
of those who do receive it: Neither are they to
rest satisfied with the former without some pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mising
evidences of the latter: for, he will have
them to pray not only that the Gospel may have
free course, but also that it <hi>may be glorified.</hi> See
the Exposition. 9. That the word of the Lord
hath prevailed mightily with our selves, and car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ryed
us captive to the obedience of it, should serve
us both as an incitement to deal with God in behalf
of others, that they may be gained in like manner,
seeing grace is not envious, 1 <hi>Cor. 13.—4</hi>—and
for a ground of hope that our labour of that sort
shall not be in vain in the Lord: for, that he may
incite them to pray for others with confidence, he
minds them how the Gospel had prevailed with
themselves, <hi>even as it is with you,</hi> saith he.</p>
               <pb n="413" facs="tcp:61385:212"/>
               <q>Ver. 2. And that we may be delivered from un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reasonable
and wicked men: for all men have
not faith.</q>
               <p>Here is, first, the second particular to be prayed
for, and it respecteth the person of <hi>Paul,</hi> and of
other faithful Ministers, concerning whom they
were to pray that they <hi>might be</hi> preserved and <hi>de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>livered</hi>
(to wit, so long as God had any work for
them, 2 <hi>Sam. 15. 25, 26.)</hi> from the cruelty and
snares both of open and secret enemies, who are
here called, first, <hi>unreasonable,</hi> that is, men dement<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed,
whom no reason could satisfie, or (as the greek
word implyeth) <hi>men of no abode,</hi> possibly the va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>grant
Jews, or men unworthy to have any place or
respect among men. Next, <hi>wicked,</hi> that is, men of
a vitious life, or, more particularly (as the origi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal
also implyeth) men desirous of trouble, and
procuring trouble to others. Secondly, he gives a
reason why this petition for their delivery and pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>servation
was necessary, and also hints at the cause
of mens absurdity and wickedness presently spoken
of; to wit, because many, even of those within
the visible Church, had not the grace of saving
faith; and leaveth it unto them to gather that no
good was to be expected from such to Christs faith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful
Ministers. <hi>Doct.</hi> 1. Not only the Gospel
which Ministers do carry, but also the persons of
Ministers for the Gospels sake, should be respected
and cared for, both by themselves, and by the Lords
people of their charge. Those earthen vessels
should be regarded because of the precious liquor
<pb n="414" facs="tcp:61385:213"/>
contained in them; for, <hi>Paul</hi> having recommended
unto them to pray for the spreading of the Gospel
in the first place, doth now enjoyn them to pray
for the preservation of his person and of other
faithful Ministers in the next. <hi>And that we may be
delivered,</hi> saith he. 2. As faithful Ministers may
alwayes look to meet with opposition: So they
who oppose them most, and the work of God in
their hands, are usually men of turbulent spirits,
unreasonable carriage, and for one bad property or
other somewhat infamous, even such as <hi>Pauls</hi> oppo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sites
here spoken of, <hi>that we may be delivered from
unreasonable and wicked men.</hi> 3. Wherever a
spirit of opposition against the publick Ministry
doth enter, it turneth malapert and shameless, so
that no eminency of parts, of place, or unblameable<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness
of life in Christs Ministers, can prove a suf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficient
sanctuary to shelter them from it: for, <hi>Paul</hi>
was eminent for all those, and yet those absurd and
shameless men did create trouble and hazard to
him, <hi>That we may be delivered from unreasonable
and wicked men.</hi> 4. The visible Church hath al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wayes
in it a mixed multitude of good and bad,
wh<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>a<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap> and tares, <hi>Matth.</hi> 13. 24. neither have the
labours of the most eminent Ministers, been ever, for
what appeareth, so far blessed of God, as to be the
means of conveying saving grace unto all who heard
them; for, he sheweth that even in that time when
the Apostles were Preachers, <hi>all men had not faith,</hi>
and this must be understood of men in the visible
Church, for they knew sufficiently that all others
who were without the Church had it not. 5. As
the grace of saving faith doth powerfully restrain a
<pb n="415" facs="tcp:61385:213"/>
mans turbulent, sensual and irrational affections; So
any other restraint, where this is wanting, will
prove but weak to keep them at under, if a suitable
tentation be once presented; for, he makes their
want of faith the cause of their unreasonable, tur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bulent
and wicked carriage: <hi>for all men have not
faith,</hi> saith he. 6. As the grace of faith is not be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stowed
by God upon all who hear the Gospel, but
upon some only, even the elect, <hi>Act. 13.—48.</hi>
so it is a speaking evidence that such have no faith
who prove shameless, absurd and turbulent in their
opposition to faithful Ministers, and to the work of
God in their hands: for, he maketh their opposi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
flow from their want of faith: <hi>for all men
have not faith,</hi> saith he.</p>
               <q>Ver. 3. But the Lord is faithful, who shall stablish
you, and keep you from evil.</q>
               <p>The Apostle doth here encourage them against
their fear of falling from truth, which he foresaw
would readily arise from what he presently spoke,
of the many open and secret enemies to truth, and
to the sincere Preachers and professors thereof; as
appeareth from the adversative particle <hi>But:</hi> and
he encourageth them by assuring them that God
would, first, <hi>stablish</hi> or confirm them in good, so
as they should not totally nor finally fall from it,
1 <hi>Joh.</hi> 3. 9. 2. Most carefully <hi>keep</hi> them, as a
prison is kept (as the word implyeth) <hi>from evil,</hi>
that is, from Satan that evil one, together with all
his evil and mischievous devices, even every evil
work, 2 <hi>Tim.</hi> 4. 18. to wit, so as sin should not
<pb n="416" facs="tcp:61385:214"/>
have dominion over them, <hi>Rom.</hi> 6. 14. The tru<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>h
of all which is confirmed from this that <hi>God is faith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful,</hi>
one who may be trusted, and will perform
whatever he hath promised, where he supponeth
that God hath promised never to leave them, who
have once sincerely closed with him, according to
<hi>Joh. 10.—28.</hi> and therefore his faithfulness must
be engaged to establish and keep them. <hi>Doct.</hi> 1. As
the truly Godly, upon the apprehension of any
pinching hazard, are of all men aptest to be dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>couraged
with thoughts of their own weakness,
1 <hi>Sam.</hi> 27. 1. So it is the duty of every faithful
Minister carefully to foresee what may prove dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>couraging
to any such, and tenderly guard against
it: yea such should be his tenderness in this, that
their hazard should make him in a manner forget
his own: for, though the rage of enemies was
mainly bent against <hi>Pauls</hi> own person, yet he is
more taken up how to guard against the discou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ragement
of the Lords people, which he foresaw
would arise from it, than to provide for his own
safety. <hi>But the Lord is faithful,</hi> saith he, <hi>w<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>o
will stablish you.</hi> 2. Then doth a Minister wisely
guard and underprop the Lords people against dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>couragements
arising from their own apprehended
weakness, when he doth not labour to possess them
with the contrary thoughts of their own strength,
which indeed is none, 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 3. 5. but rather con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firming
whatever thoughts they have of that kind,
he doth fasten them upon the power and faithfulness
of God for their support; for, so doth <hi>Paul</hi> here,
<hi>But the Lord is faithful,</hi> saith he, <hi>who will stablish
you.</hi> 3. That Gods fidelity is impledged for the
<pb n="417" facs="tcp:61385:214"/>
performance of his promises, See upon 1 <hi>Thes. 5.
v. 24. doct. 5. for God is faithful.</hi> 4. The final
perseverance of believers in good, and their pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>servation
from evil in the extent mentioned in the
exposition, is absolutely promised, and most un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>doubtedly
shall be performed: for, the impledging
of Gods faithfulness for it, implyeth that it is a
thing promised. <hi>But God is faithful who shall sta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>blish
you,</hi> &amp;c. 5. The infallible perseverance of
the Saints in good, and their preservation from evil,
doth not flow from the nature of grace in it self,
which is but a created quality, and may be crushed
if there were not some external help to underprop
it, <hi>Rev.</hi> 3. 2. nor yet from any fixedness of their
own resolutions, which are in themselves but
changeable, <hi>Jer.</hi> 20. 9. but from the power of God
who standeth engaged to bear them through against
all opposition in the contrary. <hi>But God is faithful,</hi>
saith he, <hi>who will stablish you.</hi>
               </p>
               <q>Ver. 4. And we have confidence in the Lord touch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
you, that ye both do and will do the things
which we command you.</q>
               <p>Here is his second exhortation wherein he doth
most effectually, though indirectly, incite them to
obey the doctrine delivered by him in general, as
the rule of their life and conversation, while he
professeth his charitable <hi>confidence,</hi> ground <hi>upon
the Lord</hi> and his grace, of their present and future
obedience to what he had commanded them in the
name and authority of Jesus Christ, as the word in
the orignal doth imply. See upon 1 <hi>Thes. 4. v.</hi> 2.
<pb n="418" facs="tcp:61385:215"/>
Understand him here to speak, 1. Of the present
obedience of the most part, as to the main of his
injunctions, though in some things they were de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fective,
as appeareth from <hi>v. 6, &amp;c.</hi> and, 2. Of
the fewer, though better part, as to all his injuncti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons
in general. And, 3. Of them all as to their
future obedience, whereof he was charitably con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fident,
though for the present, as said is, they were
in some things blame-worthy. <hi>Doct.</hi> 1. It is the
duty of Ministers towards the Lords people of their
charge, and of all Christians mutually towards one
another, charitably to believe and hope the best of
their inward good condition and perseverance in it,
where there are any probable, though not infallible,
evidence; for charity thinks no evil, 1 <hi>Cor. 13—5.</hi>
Thus <hi>Paul</hi> had confidence that they both did and
would do, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> 2. We ought to ground our cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritable
confidence of peoples perseverance in well-doing,
not in themselves whatever be their present
goodness (for all men are weak, <hi>Mat.</hi> 26. 41. and
lyars, <hi>Rom. 3. 4.)</hi> but in the Lord, who alone can
powerfully encline their hearts to good and preserve
them in it; for, <hi>Paul</hi> had <hi>confidence,</hi> not in them,
but <hi>in the Lord</hi> concerning them. 3. It is a singu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lar
piece of ministerial prudence for a Minister, in
some cases, and when he hath to do with some
people, especially those in whom he seeth any ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pearance
of good, &amp; yet an aptness not to be discou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>raged
with the bad thoughts which discerning gra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cious
men may have concerning them, to point out
to such their duty, and to incite them to it, rather
by shewing his charitable thoughts of their present
and future obedience, than by a rigid pressing of
<pb n="419" facs="tcp:61385:215"/>
their duty on them, joined with an upbraiding of
them for some present neglects, and his professed
diffidence of their amendment in time <hi>coming;</hi> for,
<hi>Paul</hi> incites them to obedience by professing the
confidence he had of them. <hi>And we have confi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence
that ye both do and will do.</hi> 4. It is the
duty of people to improve what place they have in
the charity of faithful Ministers, or discerning
Christians, as a spur to incite them to further dili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gence,
and to walk answerable to that esteem which
others have of them, and not to rest upon it, as if
having it they had enough; for, <hi>Paul</hi> doth express
his charitable confidence of them, that they may
be thereby incited to their duty. <hi>We have confi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence
that ye both do, and will do.</hi> 5. As the life
of a Christian is more in practice and in doing,
than in profession and word-speaking; So the rule
of their practice is not the example of others,
<hi>Exod.</hi> 23. 2. nor yet the dictates of their mother<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wit
or natural reason, <hi>Rom.</hi> 1. 21, 22. and much
less, the sway and inclination of their corrupt af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fections,
<hi>Isa. 57.—17.</hi> but the word of God
and those injunctions of his sent Ministers which
they as his Lyon-heraulds do press upon them
from him; for, he expresseth the Christian mans
exercise, by doing what he commanded them in
the name and authority of Jesus Christ. <hi>Ye both
do and will do the things which we command you,</hi>
saith he. 6. The practice and obedience of Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stians
according to the forementioned rule, must
be both universal, extending it self to all that is
commanded, and constant, so as not only they be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gin
well, but also continue unto their Journeys
<pb n="420" facs="tcp:61385:216"/>
end; for, so was their obedience. <hi>We are confi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent
ye both do and will do the things which we
command.</hi>
               </p>
               <q>Ver. 5. And the Lord direct your hearts into the
love of God, and into the patient waiting for
Christ.</q>
               <p>Followeth his third exhortation, whereby,
while he prayeth the Lord to <hi>direct their hearts</hi>
or make them straight, he doth also indirectly in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cite
them to the exercise of two graces, which are
chief parts of, and have special influence upon the
obedience formerly pressed. First, <hi>the love of
God,</hi> understand, that whereby we love God;
under which is contained love to our Neighbour,
as a stream flowing from that fountain, <hi>Matth. 22.
37,</hi> 39. Although the sense and feeling of Gods
love to us spoken of <hi>Rom.</hi> 5. 5. needeth not to be
excluded. Secondly, <hi>Patient waiting for Christ,</hi> or
(as the word is in the original) <hi>patience of Christ.</hi>
It implyeth patience with expectation, even such
a patient enduring of hardships in the way of
our duty for Christs sake, as is joined with, and
floweth from a well-grounded expectation of good
things to be received from Christ, especially at
his second coming. <hi>Doct.</hi> 1. As the hearts of
men are in the hand of the Lord, who alone can
powerfully encline, direct and turn them where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever
he will, <hi>Prov.</hi> 21. 1. So it concerneth us
highly to see to the heart that it be rightly inclined,
seeing wheresoever it goeth, it doth powerfully
<pb n="421" facs="tcp:61385:216"/>
draw the whole man with it; for, <hi>Paul</hi> doth pray
<hi>the Lord to direct their hearts.</hi> 2. That Christi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans
do continue constant in the course of begun
obedience, there is of necessity required a conti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nual
supply of influence from God, together with
some fervour of love to him, and patient expecta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
of good things to be received from him, which
may serve as cords to draw us forward in the way
of duty, against all tentations and discouragements
which will be otherwise prevalent to retard and
draw us backward, 2 <hi>Cor. 5. 14. Psal.</hi> 27. 13. for,
as a mean of their continuing to do what he com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manded
them, he prayeth the <hi>Lord to direct their
hearts into the love of God and patient waiting for
Christ.</hi> 3. As the heart of man is by nature crooked
and perverse; So it is in a special manner averse
from the love of God, whom, though he be the
chief good, yet, every man by nature doth hate,
though not as he is Creator and preserver of the
world, yet as he is a just Judge armed with vengeance
against evil doers, yea and there are dregs of this
averseness even in the truly Godly, who have a
law in their members rebelling against the Law of
God written in their mind and renewed part, <hi>Rom.
7.</hi> 23. for, this crookedness and averseness from
love to God is implyed, while he prayeth the Lord
<hi>to direct,</hi> or make straight, <hi>their hearts into the love
of God.</hi> 4. The hearts of men by nature are also
averse from undergoing a suffering lot for Christ,
and from taking that comfort under the cross which
ariseth from the hope of a promised out-gate and
reward, as being unwilling to give any further trust
to the precious promises than they see of present
<pb n="422" facs="tcp:61385:217"/>
performance, 2 <hi>Pet.</hi> 3. 4. yea, and there are dregs
of this averseness also in the truly regenerate
(though not allowed of by themselves, <hi>Psal. 42. 9.)</hi> as
appeareth from their desire to shift a cleanly cross,
<hi>Matth.</hi> 16. 22. and therefore small courage oft<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times
under it, <hi>Heb.</hi> 12. 13. or hopes of an out-gate
from it, 1 <hi>Sam.</hi> 27. 1—for averseness is also
implyed while he prayeth the <hi>Lord to direct their
hearts—into the patient waiting for Christ.</hi>
5. How averse soever the hearts of men in nature,
or of men renewed, are from the exercise of those
or other graces; yet there is omnipotency in God
to make them straight when he will, and to encline
them powerfully to love where they hate, to take
up a cross for Christ contentedly; and to hope for
what they see not, confidently; for, while the
Apostle prayeth that the Lord would direct them
to love and patience, he doth suppone that God
hath power so to direct them. 6. The graces of
love to God, of patience under a suffering lot and
of well-grounded hope, do well together, in so far
as where love to God is rooted in the heart, together
with a firm expectation of all those good things
contained in the promise to be received from him,
there can be nothing too hard to be undergone and
suffered for him, <hi>Rom. 8. 35. 2 Cor.</hi> 4. 16. with 5.
for, <hi>Paul</hi> doth pray for all those jointly, even the
<hi>love of God and patient waiting for Christ:</hi> see the
Exposition.</p>
               <pb n="423" facs="tcp:61385:217"/>
               <q>Ver. 6. Now we command you, brethren, in the
name of our Lord Jesus Christ, that ye withdraw
your selves from every brother that walketh
disorderly, and not after the tradition which he
received of us.</q>
               <p>Here beginneth his fourth exhortation, upon
which he insisteth most and dealeth more perempto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rily
in it, than in any of the former, as that which
is his great work in the first part of this Chapter,
and to which all the rest have been preparatory in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sinuations.
And first, being to handle this purpose
more generally to <hi>v.</hi> 11. he straitly <hi>commands</hi>
them <hi>in the name</hi> and authority of <hi>Jesus Christ to
withdraw from,</hi> or have no familiar intimate fel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowship
with, <hi>any brother,</hi> or Christian in external
profession, <hi>who walketh disorderly,</hi> or that, as a
disorderly souldier (from which the word in the
original is borrowed) did any wayes transgress
the order, bounds and limits of his particular calling
and station assigned him by God, and thereby pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved
offensive to the Church, and especially such as
lived idly neglecting their own business, and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>truded
themselves upon the affairs of others (see
<hi>v. 11.)</hi> even all those (as the Apostle doth here
further explain himself) who walked contrary un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to
and not after <hi>that tradition,</hi> or doctrine, deli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vered
by him against idlers whereof, <hi>v.</hi> 10. and
therefore were to be discountenanced, and their
company abandoned as is here commanded. Now
though every Christian is bound to abstain from all
voluntary and unnecessary fellowship with profane
<pb n="424" facs="tcp:61385:218"/>
men, in so far as they do not seem to countenance
or encourage them in their sin, even though they
be not excommunicate and cast out by the Church,
<hi>Psal.</hi> 26. 4, 5. yet seeing it is clear the Apostle
speaketh of excommunication, <hi>v.</hi> 14. and the dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>orderly
walking here mentioned is a sin continued
in after publick <hi>(1 Thes. 4. 11.)</hi> and private ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monition
<hi>(1 Thes. 5. 14.)</hi> Therefore the with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>drawing
from their fellowship here commanded
seemeth to be the consequent of the Churches pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lick
censure, in the enjoyning whereof the antece<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent
censure is enjoyned also, to wit, that the
Church-guides should excommunicate the contu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>macious,
and all Church-members should with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>draw
from the party so censured. And seeing this
purpose is handled here more generally and to be
insisted on more particularly, <hi>v. 11, &amp;c.</hi> I shall
only observe these general doctrines from it.
1. Though Ministers ought in wisdom to deal with
the Lords people, for the most part, by meek intrea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties
and prudent insinuations (see <hi>v. 4. doct. 3.)</hi>
yet where their authority, or rather the authority
of Christ in them, hath been contemned, their
meekness abused, and when they have to do with a
prevalent growing evil, it is their duty to be more
peremptory, and with all authority to charge and
command; for, so doth <hi>Paul</hi> here in those cases,
<hi>now we command you in the name of our Lord Jesus
Christ.</hi> But, 2. The sharpness of their most pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>remptory
commands should be in prudence allayed
somewhat, with a seasonable mixture of their af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fection
and brotherly love to those, whom they so
command; lest otherwayes their imperious way
<pb n="425" facs="tcp:61385:218"/>
be lookt upon as a piece of insolency, and meet with
contempt and disdain instead of obedience; for, so
doth the Apostle here while he calleth them <hi>bre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thren.
Now we command you brethren,</hi> &amp;c. 3. A
Minister should also see to it carefully that his pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>remptory
commands and threatnings be grounded
upon the authority of Christ, as being first enjoyn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
and denounced by him, otherwise he cannot ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pect
that any thing spoken by him, though with ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver
so much authority, zeal and boldness, can have
great weight in peoples consciences; for, such
were <hi>Pauls</hi> peremptory commands. <hi>We command
you in the name of our Lord Jesus Christ.</hi> 4. It
hath ever been the lot of the Church of Christ to
have some professours in it, whose way and car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riage
hath been in no measure answerable unto that
which they did profess; for, even in this Church,
so highly commended, <hi>chap.</hi> 1. 3, 4. there were
some such, as is supponed while he bids them <hi>with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>draw
from every brother,</hi> or Church-member, <hi>who
walketh disorderly.</hi> 5. The way and carriage of
such is more to be detested and shunned, than if
they were professed enemies, in so far as they are
a greater reproach to the Gospel, 2 <hi>Pet.</hi> 2. 13.
and make the name of God which they profess to
be blasphemed by others; <hi>Rom.</hi> 2. 23, 24. for,
<hi>Paul</hi> bids <hi>withdraw,</hi> not so much from avowed
Heathens, as, <hi>from every brother that walketh dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>orderly.</hi>
6. There is no Church-member whose
quality, rank or station, doth wholly exempt his
disorderly scandalous walking from the Ecclesiasti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cal
cognition of Christs Ministers, or can keep the
Lords people free of hurt and damage from his
<pb n="426" facs="tcp:61385:219"/>
evil example, if they converse familiarly with
him; for, he bids the people <hi>withdraw from every
brother,</hi> without exception, <hi>who walketh disorder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly,</hi>
which supponeth that the Church-guides should
first censure them, as was shewn in the Exposition.
7. There is a difference to be made, both in the
inflicting of Church-censurrs by Church-guides,
and in the withdrawing of familiar fellowship by
private Christians; betwixt those, who being sur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prized
with some violent tentation, do but once
or twice step aside from the rule of their duty,
and others whose continued strain and course of
life is still disorderly: for, he bids <hi>withdraw</hi> on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
from those <hi>who walk disorderly,</hi> or whose con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinued
way and course was such, as the word <hi>walk</hi>
imports. 8. So hardly are our hearts brought up
to a perfect hatred and detestation of sin; that
though possibly we have some abhorrence from
committing it our selves, yet we take pleasure in
them who do it, and with great difficulty we are
made to withdraw from them or discountenance
them in it; for, therefore he seeth it needful to
give them such a peremptory charge, <hi>in the name
of our Lord Jesus Christ, to withdraw from them
that walk disorderly,</hi> and the word rendred <hi>with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>draw</hi>
signifieth to abstain from that whither the sway
and inclination of our mind doth carry us. 9. As
once receiving and professed embracing of Divine
truths for the rule of duty, doth make the rejecter
thereof more guilty, than if he had not received
them at all: So those do live disorderly whose life
and conversation is not ordered according to the
prescript of Gods word, how strictly soever they
<pb n="427" facs="tcp:61385:219"/>
do conform themselves to the Civil Laws of the
Land wherein they live: for, he saith that <hi>brother
did walk disorderly,</hi> who did not walk <hi>according to
the tradition,</hi> or doctrine delivered by him from
God, and aggravate their sin from this that they had
once received that tradition. <hi>And not after the
tradition which he received of us,</hi> saith he.</p>
               <q>Ver. 7. For your selves know how ye ought to fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low
us: for we behaved not our selves disorderly
among you.</q>
               <p>Here is a reason serving both to inforce the duty
of censuring, and withdrawing from those, who
walked disorderly, and to aggravate the sin of those
who did so walk. It is taken from the Apostles
example propounded first here in general. <hi>He
walked not disorderly,</hi> that is, lived not idly, as he
after explains. And for the force of this reason to
condemn the contrary practice, he appealeth to their
own conscience, if they did not know and were suf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficiently
convinced of their obligation to follow his
example; and to discountenance those who did
otherwise, to wit, in so far as he was a follower of
Christ, 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 11. 1. as he was indeed in this par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticular,
and they did also know it. <hi>Doct.</hi> 1. As
Christians ought to walk according to their know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge.
So he is not worthy of the name of a Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stian,
who knoweth not this, that a man is bound to
follow the example of his Minister, in so far as he
doth follow Christ; seeing Ministers are given to
teach the Lords people not by their doctrine only
but by their example also, 1 <hi>Tim.</hi> 4. 12. for, <hi>Paul</hi>
                  <pb n="428" facs="tcp:61385:220"/>
supponeth they knew how they ought to follow him,
and draws an argument from thence for pressing
this duty upon themselves, <hi>for ye your selves know
how ye ought to follow us.</hi> 2. As all who know
their duty do not walk according to it, but too too
many do live in the practice of those evils, for
which their heart, their light, and conscience doth
condemn them: So sins done against knowledge
have in them a singular weight and aggravation be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>yond
sins of ignorance. They make the sinner
more inexcusable, <hi>Rom.</hi> 2. 1. and his punishment
the greater, <hi>Luk</hi> 12. 47. for, he aggravateth their
sin from this that they knew they should have fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowed
his example, and yet did it not: <hi>for your
selves know how ye ought to follow us,</hi> saith he.
3. It aggravateth also our neglect of duty not a
little, that we not only know our duty, but also
have a cloud of witnesses and shining examples
going before us in the way of our duty, whereby all
pretence of impossibility to perform our duty is
removed seeing men subject to the like infirmities
have already practised it; for, he aggravateth their
sin from this, that he and his associates had given
them an example in the contrary, <hi>we behaved not
our selves disorderly among you.</hi> 4. It concerneth
much the Lords servants, who are sent to press the
practice of duty upon others, so to walk, as their
life and carriage may hold out a copy of that obe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dience
which they require from the Lords people.
Hereby their doctrine hath the greater weight,
<hi>Matth.</hi> 5. 15, 16. and otherwise they are a re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proach
to the Gospel, 1 <hi>Sam.</hi> 2. 17. and they them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves,
at least, do reap no profi<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap> by it, 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 9. 23.
<pb n="429" facs="tcp:61385:220"/>
for, <hi>Paul</hi> practised himself what he pressed upon
others. <hi>We behaved not our selves disorderly
among you.</hi>
               </p>
               <q>Ver. 8. Neither did we eat any mans bread for
nought; but wrought with labour and travel
night and day, that we might not be chargeable
to any of you.</q>
               <p>He applyeth what he spoke of his own example
in general to the particular wherein they were
guilty, by shewing he <hi>did not eat bread,</hi> or take his
ordinary food in meat and drink (as <hi>Gen. 3. 19.)
from any man for nought,</hi> or without money, and
price payed for it. Where he speaks according
to the common opinion of earthly minded men,
who think whatever maintenance is given to Mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sters
for their Ministerial labours is bestowed upon
them for nought, though it be not so, <hi>Mat.</hi> 10. 10.
Now the Apostle sheweth that even in their sense
he took nothing for nought, but that he might be
able to sustain himself, besides his publick preach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
(which was his proper employment, 1 <hi>Cor. 1.
17.)</hi> he wrought in tent-making, <hi>Act.</hi> 18. 3. even
to weariness, and after he was wearied, as the
words, <hi>labour and travel,</hi> do imply, and that both
<hi>night and day,</hi> (See upon 1 <hi>Thes. 2. 9.)</hi> and he
mentioneth a twofold end proposed to himself why
he did so work; The first is in this verse, <hi>That he
might not be chargeable,</hi> or burthensome to <hi>any</hi> of
them. He meaneth not as if the maintenance of a
Minister should be accounted a burthen by the
flock, but that some miserable wretches among
<pb n="430" facs="tcp:61385:221"/>
them would have thought it so. Besides, it is not
improbable that a great part (though not all, <hi>Act.
17. 4.)</hi> of those who had first received the Gospel
in that City were of the poorer sort, whom he had
no will indeed to burthen. Besides what is marked
upon a parallel place, 1 <hi>Thes. 2. 9. doct.</hi> 3, 4, 5.
concerning 1. A necessity lying upon men of dimit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting
themselves to the meanest of employments
before they want a mean of livelyhood. 2. The
lawfulness of a Ministers using some handy labour
in some cases. 3. The groundlesness of the Po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pish
tenet about works of supererrogation; observe
further hence 1. Circumstances of time, place,
company and such like, may make an action become
exceeding sinful; and abstinence from it a necessa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry
duty at some times, the practice whereof is in
it self indifferent, lawful, yea and in some cases
necessary: for, all things being considered, it was
a necessary duty for <hi>Paul</hi> not to take bread of those
<hi>Thessal<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>nians</hi> without price, though the thing in it
self be not simply unlawful. Otherwise, hospita<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lity
and giving of meat for nought could not be
commanded, <hi>Titus</hi> 1. 8. nor those ancient love-feasts
among Christian friends could be commended, as
we find they are; <hi>Jude 12. Neither did we eat any
mans bread for nought.</hi> 2. The Lord doth some<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times
call his servants to spend and be spent among
a people, from whom they do receive or can expect
but lit<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>le of worldly encouragement, that thereby
they may have an occasion to make their sincerity
in the work of the Lord appear both to their own
heart and <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>he consciences of others, who may evi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dently
see their Ministers are not seeking theirs but
<pb n="431" facs="tcp:61385:221"/>
them, 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 12. 14. for, <hi>Paul</hi> did not receive so
much encouragement worldly as bread to eat among
those <hi>Thessalonians. Neither did we eat any mans
bread for nought.</hi> 3. It pleases the Lord in deep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>est
wisdom, sometimes, to measure out a very hard
lot in things worldly to his dearest servants, and to
give but little of earth to those who glorifie him
most upon earth, and upon whom he intends to be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stow
a more than ordinary measure of glory in
Heaven, that none may know by those things whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
he be worthy of love or hatred, <hi>Eccles. 9.—1.</hi>
for, even <hi>Paul,</hi> that elect vessel of the Lord, is made
to work for a livelyhood <hi>with labour and travel
night and day.</hi> 4. Though Ministers are not tyed
to follow this example of <hi>Pauls,</hi> here recorded, in
all particulars, because of the great inequality be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>twixt
him and them, by reason of his super-emi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nent
gifts, and his extraordinay assistance, which
made it less necessary for him to spend so much of
his time in reading and preparation for publick
duties, as ordinary Ministers must do. Besides,
that some reasons peculiar to this Church and to
that of <hi>Corinth,</hi> did oblige him so to walk towards
them, though he did not find himself so obliged
towards others who had not the like reasons.
However, I say, that therefore other ordinary Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nisters
are not tyed to follow his example in all par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticulars;
yet they are so far to follow it, as to
endeavour that the Gospel which they Preach may
be as little burthensome and chargeable to people as
in them lyeth: for this was the thing <hi>Paul</hi> aimed
at, <hi>that we might not be chargeable unto any of you,</hi>
saith he. 5. It is a duty incumbent unto the Lords
<pb n="432" facs="tcp:61385:222"/>
people to maintain their Ministers in a way credita<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble
to the Gospel, even when, through reason of
poverty, their so doing would prove burthensome
unto them; for, he saith not, that they ought not
to have sustained him, because of their poverty, only
he would not eat their bread for nought, <hi>that he
might not be burthensome unto them,</hi> and <hi>v.</hi> 9. he
asserts his own power and right to have exacted
maintenance from them, and consequently they
were bound to give it.</p>
               <q>Ver. 9. Not because we have not power, but to
make our selves an ensample unto you to fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low
us.</q>
               <p>Lest the Apostles example had been urged by co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vetous
wretches, for a law and rule to the prejudice
of other Ministers, though not in the same circum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stantial
case with <hi>Paul,</hi> he doth therefore, first, as<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sert
his <hi>power</hi> and right to take maintenance from
them, so that his not exacting it was not because <hi>he
had not power</hi> to demand it. Next, he mentioneth
the second end why he laboured so hard, and did not
exact his right, to wit, that he might thereby in his
own practice held forth a lively <hi>example</hi> and copy
to be followed by them, both in what he had pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>scribed
to them about diligence in some lawful call<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing,
seeing he did more than otherwise he needed
for their example and encouragement, as also in
departing somewhat from their right as he had
done, rather than they should over-burthen their
brethren. <hi>Doct.</hi> 1. Though there is nothing more
reasonable than that they which wait at the Altar
<pb n="433" facs="tcp:61385:222"/>
be partakers of the Altar, 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 9. 3.—and
that a Minister who spends his time and strength
among a people should be maintained by them; yet
the contrary opinion hath been early hatched and
alwayes held on foot by some, who look upon the
Ministry as an idle calling, and that nothing of right
belongeth to them who labour in it, as due unto
them, for their works sake, Satan hereby taking
advantage of the earthly-mindedness of some, and
heart-enmity to the Gospel in others, to starve the
Gospel and publick ordinances of Gods worship
out of the world, when he cannot prevail to drive
them away by force; for, <hi>Paul</hi> foresaw there
would be some so disposed; and therefore asserts
the right of Ministers to exact maintenance, <hi>not be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause
we have not power,</hi> saith he. 2. It concern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth
therefore the Ministers of Jesus Christ to assert
their right, both by the Laws of God and men, to a
competency of worldly maintenance, and carefully
to guard, lest any deed of theirs do weaken their
right, though not so much from respect to them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves,
who, at least many of them, have sufficient
parts to employ in any other calling for gaining
their livelyhood, as well as other men, but from
respect to the Gospel and the eternal well-being of
peoples souls; for, <hi>Paul</hi> foreseeing that his ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ample
would possibly be alledged by some covetous
misers to enervate the Divine right of Ministers
to maintenance, he doth here assert it, <hi>Not because
we have not power,</hi> saith he. 3. Christian sobriety
will teach a man so to speak to the commendation
of his own moderation, and not exacting the rigour
of his right in some cases, as that he do not reflect
<pb n="434" facs="tcp:61385:223"/>
upon others who do not exercise the same modera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion,
as not being called to it, because they are
not in the same case; for, <hi>Paul</hi> doth not reflect up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
the practice of other Ministers, who not being
in the like case with him, should exact maintenance,
while he asserteth both his own and their right to it.
<hi>Not because we have not power,</hi> saith he. 4. Not
only Ministers, but all and every one are bound to
remit somewhat of that, which, in strictest justice,
they might exact, rather than to over-burthen, and
break their poor brethren, by exacting all their
right from them; for, he holds forth his example
in remitting of his right to be followed not only
by Ministers, but the people also in the like case, <hi>but
to make our selves an ensample unto you to follow
us,</hi> saith he. 5. The Lords Ministers should, as
by all lawful means, so especially by the exercise
of wise and justifiable moderation in things relating
to this present world, endeavour to gain that love
and respect among the people of their flock, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by
they may be the more incited to follow their ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ample
in things honest and just; especially seeing
such is the humour of people, as not to trouble
themselves much in following their copy, except
they affect and respect the hand that wrote it; for,
<hi>Paul</hi> did remit of that which was otherwise his
just right, to make himself <hi>an example unto them
to follow him.</hi>
               </p>
               <pb n="435" facs="tcp:61385:223"/>
               <q>Ver. 10. For even when we were with you, this
we commanded you, that if any man would not
work, neither should he eat.</q>
               <p>Here is a second reason serving both to dondemn
the sin of idleness and their neglect of censuring that
sin, because their practice herein was not only
contrary to his example, as is already shewn, but
also to his doctrine, whereby he had commanded
and by his Apostolick authority enacted for a stand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
law, that <hi>whosoever</hi> having otherwayes strength
and opportunity, <hi>will not work,</hi> that is, employ,
either his body, or mind, or both, in some honest
labour, for promoting one way or other the good
of mankind, such a man <hi>should not eat,</hi> that is,
should not be born with, sed, or maintained among
Christians, that so being redacted to straits, he may
be constrained to betake himself to some honest em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ployment.
<hi>Doct.</hi> 1. As the Lords Ministers should
press upon people, not only practice of religious
duties, but also painfulness and diligence in some
particular calling: So it is the duty of the Lords
people, and of every one in their station, to pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>move
obedience to the lawful commands of Christs
Ministers, both in themselves and in others; for,
<hi>Paul</hi> doth press upon all to work in some particular
calling, and to promove obedience to his direction
herein, by discountenancing such as would not obey,
while he commandeth that <hi>if any would not work,
neither should he eat.</hi> 2. As it is the duty of Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nisters
to give timeous warning against a sin, when
it beginneth to spread, and before it come to a
<pb n="436" facs="tcp:61385:224"/>
height among a people: So the more temeous
warning hath been given of the evil that is in any
sin, the greater is their guilt, who notwithstanding
contiue in it, or do not what they might and should
to suppress it; for, <hi>Paul</hi> had given order timeously,
even while he was with them, to suppress this sin
of idleness, and doth hence aggravate their guilt in
that they had not done so: <hi>for even when we
were with you, this we commanded you.</hi> 3. It
concerneth all men, and especially those who are
entrusted with the Churches common Charity, to
employ it wisely, and so as, to the best of their
knowledge, they do not thereby furnish fewel to the
lusts of any, or fe<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>d them in their sinful idleness, or
any other way misapply it to such as are not due
objects; for, the command is given to all men,
chiefly to the Church-guides, that they do not em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ploy
their own, or the Churches charity, to main<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain
idle vagabonds and wilful loyterers. <hi>If any
would not work, neither should he eat.</hi> 4. It is the
Lords allowance that those who do not work, not,
because they will not, but either they are not able
to work, or though they be able and gladly would,
yet cannot get employment to work, I say, it is the
Lords allowance that such be, so far as is possible,
maintained upon the charity of others, especially if
they have nothing of their own whereby to main<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain
themselves; for, the command is not given
about those who do not work, through want of abi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lity,
or of opportunity, but only them <hi>who will not
work, that they should not eat.</hi>

               <q>Ver. 11. For we hear that there are some which
walk among you disorderly, working not at all,
but are busie-bodies.</q>
               <p>The Apostle being to speak both to idle loyter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers,
and to this Church which did tolerate them,
more particularly to <hi>v.</hi> 16. doth first both give a
reason of what he hath said to this purpose already
from <hi>v.</hi> 6. as appears from the causal particle <hi>for,</hi>
and also make way for that which he is yet to speak
more, while he sheweth he had spoken nothing
rashly or without ground, but had heard (doubt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>less
by trust-worthy informers, such as are mentio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned
1 <hi>Cor. 1. 11.)</hi> that notwithstanding of his for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer
warning, 1 <hi>Thes.</hi> 4. 11. and 5. 14. there <hi>were
some who walked disorderly among them,</hi> and were
not censured by them, whom he describeth from
two of their properties, which seem repugnant, and
yet do well agree, and usually go together. <hi>They
do nothing at all,</hi> to wit, in those things which
they ought, and <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>o which they have a calling. And
<hi>yet are busie-bodies,</hi> and but too diligent, to wit,
about those things, which belong not to them.
<hi>Doct.</hi> 1. It is not contrary to charity and prudence
for one Christian to report, delate, and make rela<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
of what miscarriages he doth observe in others,
providing he do not thereby seek their disgrace and
shame, but their amendment, and in order to that
end do report their faults, chiefly to those, who may
by some means contribute to help forward their re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pentance;
for, some did certainly make report of
those miscarriages in this Church to <hi>Paul,</hi> who had
<pb n="438" facs="tcp:61385:225"/>
power to take order with them, otherwise he could
not have heard them, <hi>for we hear that there are
some, &amp;c.</hi> 2. As Ministers should not charge a
Church or particular person with the guilt of any
sin, rashly, or without a ground; lest, otherwise,
his precipitant rashness do discover in him the want
of prudence and charity: So it is not rashness in a
Minister to reprove and tax a man, of whose guilt
in that particular for which he doth reprove him,
he knoweth nothing but by report only, providing
he believe not every report, but what he hath from
trust-worthy informers, 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 1. 11. for, <hi>Paul,</hi> to
clear himself that he had not taxed them rashly,
doth shew <hi>he heard that there were some among
them who walked disorderly.</hi> 3. It concerneth a Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nister
prudently to enquire, and seek to know what
fruits the Gospel Preached by him doth bring forth
among the people of his charge, what sins are most
prevalent with them, and what vertues are exerci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed
by them; that thereby he may be the more
enabled for speaking pertinently unto them; for, in
order to this end <hi>Paul</hi> did labour to inform him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>self,
otherwise he would not so readily have <hi>heard
that there were some which walked among them
disorderly, working not at all.</hi> 4. It is the part
of a wise reprover not to charge the faults of a few
upon all in common; lest instead of convincing
those who are guilty and making them better, he
irritate those who are not guilty and make them
worse; Thus doth <hi>Paul</hi> in wisdom astrict his charge
to some among them only. <hi>I hear that there are
some which walk among you disordely.</hi> 5. There
have been alwayes some in the Church, who
<pb n="439" facs="tcp:61385:225"/>
having taken on a name for profession, and possibly
thereby come to some respect among the Godly,
have, under a pretext of giving themselves to more
than ordinary devotion, cast by all care of any par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticular
calling, and lived hand-idle, to the hurt of
others upon whom they lived, and to the reproach
of the Gospel; for, such were they in this Church,
<hi>some who walked disorderly, working nothing at all.</hi>
6. The mind of man cannot be wholly idle, but
must be employed in somewhat, if not in doing
what is good and profitable, then of necessity in
what is evil, useless or hurtful: and usually none
are more busie in other mens matters, than they
who wholly neglect their own: for, those disor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derly
walkers <hi>did not work at all</hi> in their own af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fairs,
and yet <hi>were busie bodies</hi> in the affairs of
others.</p>
               <q>Ver. 12. Now them that are such, we command,
and exhort by our Lord Jesus Christ, that with
quietness they work, and eat their own bread.</q>
               <p>He doth, next, speak to those who were guilty
of walking disorderly, and both peremptorily <hi>com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mands</hi>
them, and most affectionately <hi>exhorts</hi> them,
in the <hi>name</hi> and authority of <hi>Christ the Lord,</hi> first,
<hi>to work,</hi> and so to quit idleness; 2. To <hi>work with
quietness,</hi> that is, containing themselves within the
bounds of their calling, without creating trouble,
either to themselves or others; from which would
follow, 3. <hi>They should eat their own bread,</hi> got<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten
by their own labours, and not given them in
almes, or for nought. <hi>Doct.</hi> 1. So great a tyrant
<pb n="440" facs="tcp:61385:226"/>
is custome in any sin, and especially a custome of
lazy ease and idleness, that when a people are once
habituate to it, they are very hardly driven from
it; for, his charging them so hard to quit their
idleness, implyeth that it was great difficulty to
drive them from it, being now for a long time accu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stomed
to it. <hi>Now them that are such we command
and exhort.</hi> 2. When sins do grow so common,
that either through the moral guilt which is in
them, or the civil inconvenience which followeth
upon them, or both, they do portend no less than
apparent ruine to the whole Church, then especially
should the Lords Ministers bend the utmost of their
endeavours, what by themselves, what by others,
to suppress them, and to reclaim the Lords people
from the practice of them; for, this sin of idleness
did threaten the dissipation of the Church, both
morally, considering the great guilt was in it, and
civilly, considering how poor this Church in all
probability was; and therefore the Apostle is so
fervent and serious to suppress it, and to stir up the
whole Church to take notice of it. <hi>Now them that
are such we command and exhort.</hi> 3. So merci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful
is God that he doth not wholly cease to deal
with sinners as if they were desperate, after one
or more repulses, but gives them many renewed
on-sets, whereby he intendeth to gain some, <hi>Joh.
4.</hi> 7, 10, 13, 16, 21, 26. and to make others more
inexcusable: <hi>Matth.</hi> 11. 21, 22. for, though those
idlers had received several admonitions to no pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pose,
yet <hi>Paul,</hi> in Christs name and authority and
by warrant from him, doth here again <hi>command
and exhort them that with quietness they work.</hi>
                  <pb n="441" facs="tcp:61385:226"/>
4. Though the sentence of excommunication, as
we shall hear from <hi>v.</hi> 14. be in it self lawful; yet
so dreadful is it, that there should be a kind of loth<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness
in Christs Ministers to pronounce it, if by any
other means they may draw the obstinate sinner to
repentance, and so prevent it; for, notwithstanding
of many former admonitions, he doth here give
them one further, before he give order to pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nounce
the sentence. <hi>Now them that are such we
command and exhort.</hi> 5. Such should be a Mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sters
way of dealing with most obstinate sinners,
in order to their gaining, as that he make known
he doth not look upon them as wholly void
of all sense of God and goodness, and secret<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
at least insinuate he hath yet some contrary
thoughts of them; that thereby, if it be possible,
he may quicken any dying principle of conscience,
any sense of Heaven or Hell, of right or wrong,
and any awe of God which yet may be lurking
in them; for, therefore doth he <hi>exhort them by
our Lord Jesus Christ,</hi> implying thereby he did
not think they had cast off all respect to him.
6. The more a man be busied with his own em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ployments,
the less will his leisure be to meddle
with the affairs of others: and consequently, will
create less trouble either to himself or to those who
live beside him; for, he joyneth those two toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther,
a mans working his own work, and his quiet
abstinence from medling with, or troubling others.
<hi>That with quietness they work.</hi> 7. That the
Lord hath established property and dominion
of goods, See upon <hi>Ephes. 4. v. 28. doct.</hi> 2. which
is also clear from this, that he speaks of their
<pb n="442" facs="tcp:61385:227"/>
                  <hi>own bread,</hi> that is, which they have a proper right
unto. 8. Beside those other wayes of attaining
right and property, by inheritance, <hi>Gen.</hi> 15. 4.
gift, 1 <hi>Sam.</hi> 9. 9. contract or bargain, <hi>Ruth</hi> 4. 9.
this is one, whatever a man doth purchase by his
lawful industry and p<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>ins is properly his own, and
may be employed by him for his own good and ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cessary
use with Gods allowance; for, he calls the
bread, which they should purchase by working with
quietness, <hi>their own bread.</hi> 9. The Lord doth
ordinarily bless a mans conscientious diligence in
his lawful calling with such a measure of success,
as he may have wherewith to sustain himself, and
be kept from being burthensome to others; for, he
sheweth, that, upon their working with quietness,
<hi>they should eat their own bread.</hi>
               </p>
               <q>Ver. 13. But ye, brethren, be not weary in well-doing.</q>
               <p>He speaketh, thirdly, to those who walked or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derly
among them. And first, he doth lovingly
exhort them, as <hi>brethren, not to weary</hi> or become
worse (as the word signifieth) that is, remiss or
slack in well-doing where, by <hi>well-doing</hi> may be
understood conscie<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="3 letters">
                     <desc>•••</desc>
                  </gap>-making of their duty in gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral,
and more particularly, 1. Painful diligence in
their lawful employments, wherein they were in
hazard of being rendred remiss by the loitering car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riage
of others. 2. Their charitable beneficence to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards
necessitous objects, from which they were not
to desist under pretext of his forbidding them to
maintain idle loyterers, <hi>v.</hi> 10. or of the abounding
<pb n="443" facs="tcp:61385:227"/>
of many unworthy objects, by relieving of whom
formerly they had misapplyed their charity. To
this sense is the like phrase used <hi>Gal. 6. 10—
Doct.</hi> 1. The Minister of Christ must so reprove
the stubborn and disobedient, as that he do not
neglect to speak to the direction and encourage<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ment
of those who are better inclined, more obe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dient
and tractable: And as there are several tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pers,
cases and conditions among a mixed multi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tude;
so must the Minister set himself to give every
one their due, neglecting none; this is to cut and
divide the word of God aright, 2 <hi>Tim.</hi> 2. 15. for, so
doth <hi>Paul;</hi> having spoken to the disorderly, <hi>v.</hi> 12.
he doth now speak to those who walked orderly.
<hi>But ye brethren be not weary.</hi> 2. As it is not suffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cient
for men once to have entered the course of
well doing, but they must continue in it: So, con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sidering
the many discouragements wherewith men
do meet in this course, and those especially which
do arise from the bad examples of others, there is
no small propenseness, even in the best, to sit up in
it; for, <hi>Paul</hi> perceiving a probability of their
turning remiss from the bad example of those who
walked disorderly, he exhorts them that they
would <hi>not be weary in well-doing.</hi> 3. It is an in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cumbent
duty to the Lords people, and a duty
which must be made conscience of, if so they would
prove themselves orderly walkers, not only to ply
their lawful callings diligently, that thereby they
may have wherewith to sustain themselves, but also
to bestow some part of their gain, a measure at
least proportioned to their ability, for the help and
supply of necessitous objects; for, <hi>Paul</hi> enjoyneth
<pb n="444" facs="tcp:61385:228"/>
to those who walked orderly, not only to work
with quietness, but also to make conscience of <hi>well-doing,</hi>
under which is contained charitable benefi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cence
to due objects, <hi>be not weary in well-doing.</hi>
4. As many men are most ingenious and witty to
find out excuses and pretexts to colour their neg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lect
of the forementioned duty, what from the un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>worthiness
of many objects, by bestowing their
charity on whom they may misapply it and lose it,
what from texts of Scripture wrested to justifie
their avaritious and merciless disposition: So no
excuse of that kind will have weight before the
Lord, but be looked upon as meer pretexts and
shifts to cover and cloak mens wretched naughti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness
and averseness from that which they are other<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wise
sufficiently convinced to be a duty, if they had
a mind to it; for, <hi>Paul</hi> foreseeing that some
would cover their averseness under those pretexts
(see the Exposition) doth here exhort them <hi>not
to be weary in well-doing.</hi>
               </p>
               <q>Ver. 14. And if any man obey not our word by
this Epistle, note that man, and have no company
with him, that he may be ashamed.</q>
               <p>He prescribes unto them, next, what they should
do for censuring the delinquents; and first, <hi>if any
man,</hi> whatever he was, <hi>did not obey,</hi> but remain con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tumaciously
disobedient to the Apostles <hi>word,</hi> or
exhortation to orderly walking, after he was now
again admonished <hi>by this Epistle,</hi> they, to wit, the
Church-guides, should <hi>note him,</hi> or as the word
doth signifie, make a sign or wonder of him, put a
<pb n="445" facs="tcp:61385:228"/>
mark or brand of infamy upon him, whereby he
meaneth no other, than that ignominious mark of
excommunication, as appears from the second
thing here enjoyned to the Lords people in relation
to the party so noted, they were to <hi>have no company
with him,</hi> where all intimate familiarity, to which
they were not obliged by any civil, or natural bond,
is discharged them, which is the very consequent
of excommunication expressed by the same word in
the original, 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 5. 11. and in the close of the
verse he expresseth one end of inflicting this cen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sure,
that the party censured, being thus discounte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nanced
by all, as a man unworthy of their com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pany,
may be <hi>ashamed</hi> of his sin, and so ashamed
of it, as to turn from it to his duty, as the greek
word implyeth, and so it is the same in effect with
that end of excommunication, which is expressed
1 <hi>Cor. 5. 5. Doct.</hi> 1. Even the most faithful, pious
and painful Ministers, when they have done their
utmost to reclaim obstinate offenders, and waited
upon them with all patience and meekness, have
ground in reason to forecast and suppone that their
pains and diligence will not be blessed unto all, but
that some, the more they are laboured with, will
prove the more obdured and perverse; The Lord
so overruling, hereby to teach his servants, that
the utmost of their endeavours can prevail nothing
without his blessing, 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 3. 6, 7. and that the
glory of their gaining ground upon any should be
ascribed to God, and not to themselves, 1 <hi>Cor. 15.
—</hi> 20. for, even <hi>Paul,</hi> after his long patience and
unwearied diligence, supponeth so much, <hi>and if
any man,</hi> saith he, <hi>obey not our word by this Epistle:</hi>
                  <pb n="446" facs="tcp:61385:229"/>
2. It is the will and command of Christ, the King
and head of his Church, that his publick Ministers
and Church-guides <hi>(Joh. 20. 23.)</hi> being convened
together <hi>(1 Cor. 5. 4.)</hi> do put a mark and brand
of infamy upon those, who with an high hand do
persevere in their wickedness after fore-going ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monitions
stubbornly despised or carelesly neglect<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed,
while in the name of our Lord Jesus Christ,
1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 5. 4. they excommunicate, cut off and cast
out all such from the society of the Church—
that the leaven of their sin spread not further to in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect
others, 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 5. 6, 7. and that the sin of some
few, tolerated and connived at by the Church, be
not a matter of reproach and disgrace to the whole,
1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 5. 1, 2. that others may be deterred from
the like obstinacy, by the severity of the censure,
1 <hi>Tim.</hi> 5. 20. and that the party against whom the
sentence is pronounced, may, by the Lords blessing
upon that mean, be brought to repentance: for,
<hi>Paul</hi> bids <hi>note</hi> the contumacious man with the igno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minious
brand of excommunication, that he <hi>may be
ashamed,</hi> or brought to repentance by that mean.
3. Even those sins which are not in their own na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture
most heinous, when contumacy against fore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>going
admonitions is joyned with them, do make
the person guilty lyable to this severe censure, in so
far as they argue desperate obstinacy, and contempt
of that authority wherewith Christ hath invested
his courts and servants: for, <hi>Paul</hi> will have even
the sin of living idly, being joyned with contumacy,
to be censured thus. <hi>And if any man obey not our
word by this Epistle, note that man.</hi> 4. The credit
of a whole Church, the salvation of a mans soul,
<pb n="447" facs="tcp:61385:229"/>
his gaining to God by repentance, are much to be
preferred to the reputation and credit of any particu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lar
person, so that the latter ought not to be spared,
if there be not another probable mean, for the pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>servation
of, or attaining to the former: for, saith
<hi>Paul, if any man obey not our word, note him,</hi> to
wit, with a mark of infamy, <hi>that he may be ashamed.</hi>
5. Church-censures, even the highest, are to be
dispensed impartially, so that where the sins deserv<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
censure are the same, and the probability of at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taining
the ends, for which the censure is inflicted,
the same, the same censure is to be inflicted upon
all without respect of persons; for, he saith, <hi>if any
man,</hi> without exception, <hi>obey not— note that
man.</hi> 6. Exhortations in Scripture must be re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stricted
according to the nature of the subject in
hand, so that when the Scripture it self, at least in
that place, doth not expresly design those to whom
the exhortation is directed, we must not think it is
alwayes directed indefinitely to all, if so the duty
exhorted unto, doth, according to other Scriptures,
belong only to some; for, the two directions of the
text, <hi>note that man,</hi> and, <hi>keep not company with
him,</hi> are not given to one and the same persons, for
all must abstain, even women, from the fellowship of
the party excommunicate, <hi>Matth.</hi> 18. 17. but the
inflicting of the censure, expressed by <hi>noting,</hi> be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>longs
not to all, certainly not to women, 1 <hi>Tim.
2.</hi> 12. nor yet to any but the Church-guides, ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording
to <hi>Heb. 13. 17. doct.</hi> 6. So many wayes
advantagious is familiar conversing with the Lords
people, <hi>Prov.</hi> 10. 21. and 13. 20. that it is no
small punishment for any man to be debarred from
<pb n="448" facs="tcp:61385:230"/>
it; and therefore it cannot be but exceeding sinful
for any to <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="2 letters">
                     <desc>••</desc>
                  </gap>un it willingly, or not to improve it for
his advantage when he doth enjoy it: for <hi>Paul</hi> en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>joyneth
Christians to <hi>have no company</hi> with the
censured party, as a sore and bitter ingredient in his
punishment. 7. As nothing hardeneth a sinner
more in wickedness, than that, notwithstanding of
it, he loseth nothing of his esteem among good men,
for any thing he can discern from their countenance
and carriage: So there is nothing which proveth
by the Lords blessing a more effectual mean to make
the sinner ashamed of his sin, and because of shame
to turn from it; than when he seeth himself dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>countenanced
and his company shunned as a very
plague by all, because of it: for, <hi>Paul</hi> enjoyns them
to <hi>have no company with him,</hi> for this very end, <hi>that
he may be ashamed,</hi> and so, as to turn from it to God.</p>
               <q>Ver. 15. Yet count him not as an enemy, but ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monish
him as a brother.</q>
               <p>The third thing which he prescribeth unto those
who walked orderly, is moderation in the execution
of the forementioned censure, propounded, 1. Ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gatively,
that they should <hi>not count him as an ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>my,</hi>
that is, so as to forsake him wholly, as men do
their enemies, without any further care of reclaim<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
him, but, next, positively, it was their duty to
<hi>admonish him,</hi> that is, mind him of his duty and
hazard, to wit, if so there might be any hopes to
regain him, <hi>Matth.</hi> 7. 6. and to admonish him as a
sickly brother under cure, to wit, so as he might un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derstand
he was not wholly cast out of their heart,
<pb n="449" facs="tcp:61385:230"/>
hopes, and affection, though cut off from all volun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tary
intimate fellowship with them, <hi>v. 14. Doct.</hi> 1.
While the servants of Christ are labouring to draw
the Lords people from the one extream of any sin,
they have need to guard lest they run upon the
other, as for example, from too much leni<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>y and
complyance with scandalous offenders, to the other
extremity of bitterness and too much rigidity; for,
<hi>Paul,</hi> having indirectly reproved them for the for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer,
doth here guard against the latter. <hi>Yet count
him not as an enemy,</hi> saith he. 2. The censure of
excommunication, when inflicted for contumacy in
some particular evils, whether of judgement or
practice, and not for total apostasie, doth not ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clude
the party censured from being a member of
the visible Church, but only from the actual en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>joyment
of Church-priviledges, and from the vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sible
Communion of the Church: for, he bids
<hi>count</hi> the excommunicate man, <hi>not as an enemy,
but, as a brother.</hi> 3. The censure, even of ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>communication
it self, should so be used, as that
love to the salvation of him who is censured be still
retained, and endeavours flowing from love used to
reclaim him, when occasion offereth; for, so much
is enjoyned, while he <hi>commands to admonish him
as a brother.</hi> 4. Then do we ky<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>h our brotherly
love and affection aright, and as we ought towards
an <hi>excommunicate</hi> person, when we do not keep
intimate and familiar fellowship with him, as we
might, kyth our affection to others who are not
under that sentence, 1 <hi>Thes.</hi> 5. 26. and much less
do flatter him in his sin and obstinacy, but when we
do admonish him of his sin and hazard, and make
<pb n="450" facs="tcp:61385:231"/>
him thereby know we love him, and in the mean
time deny him any other testimony of our affecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on,
except what civil or natural bonds do bind us
to discharge towards him: for, <hi>Paul</hi> having for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bidden
to converse familiarly with him, will have
them kyth their brotherly love towards him only

               </p>
               <q>Ver. 16. Now the Lord of peace himself give you
peace alwayes, by all means. The Lord be with
you all.</q>
               <p>In the second part of the Chapter he concludeth
the Epistle, which he doth, first, in this verse, by a
prayer to God consisting of two petitions, first,
because the censuring of the contumacious present<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
enjoyned might occasion some troubling of the
Churches peace, he prayeth that <hi>the Lord of peace
himself,</hi> who alone createth and entertaineth peace
in his Churches borders, <hi>Psal.</hi> 147. 14. might
give them peace, that is both a peaceable frame of
spirit desireous of peace, <hi>Job</hi> 3. 15. and the blessing
of peace or harmonious walking together in Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stian
society, <hi>Psal.</hi> 29. 11. and this, <hi>alwayes,</hi> that
is, a lasting, solid and continuing peace, and <hi>by all
means,</hi> to wit, a peace, whereof though God be
the only Author, yet they were to seek after it, by
all means lawful and the utmost of their <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>ervent en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deavours,
for by praying for it <hi>by all means</hi>
he doth indirectly point at their duty to seek after
it <hi>by all means.</hi> Secondly, He prayeth, that in
order to this and to other ends, <hi>God</hi> might <hi>be with
<pb n="451" facs="tcp:61385:231"/>
them all,</hi> by his gracious presence and sweet influ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ences
of his spirit for assisting them with strength,
direction and courage to go on in the way of their
duty against all opposition, <hi>Rom. 8. 31. Doct.</hi> 1.
A Minister, who would have his preaching blessed
with success among a people, must be much in pray<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er
to God for his gracious presence and powerful
concurrence. He must begin with prayer, he
must end with prayer, yea and all along his work
he must now and then dart up a fervent desire to
God for that end: for, <hi>Paul</hi> began this Epistle
with prayer, <hi>chap.</hi> 1. 2. he prayed several times in
his passing through it, <hi>chap.</hi> 1. 11. and 2. 16. and
3. 5. and now he doth conclude it with prayer.
<hi>Now the Lord of peace himself give you peace al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wayes.</hi>
2. We should labour to give such stiles
to God in prayer as are most suitable to our present
suit, and may furnish us with a ground of confi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence
that we shall be heard in what we ask; for,
while <hi>Paul</hi> suiteth for <hi>peace</hi> from God, be calleth
him <hi>the Lord of peace.</hi> 3. As there are ofttimes
ground of fear lest alienation of minds, schismes,
rents and heart-burnings may possibly follow with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in
a Church, upon their impartial exercise of disci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pline
and inflicting of the highest censure; So the
Lords servants ought not to surcease upon the meer
possibility or appearance of such hazard, but are to
do their duty, and deal with God the more ear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nestly
for preventing any feared inconvenience of
that kind: for, <hi>Paul</hi> projecting that the exercise of
discipline might breed some disturbance to the
Churches peace, doth not bid them desist, but pray<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>e<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>h,
<hi>now the Lord of peace himself give you peace
<pb n="452" facs="tcp:61385:232"/>
alwayes.</hi> 4. As peace and harmony among Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stian
societies is with great difficulty attained and
preserved, and is no less than a singular work of
God, considering our own averseness from it, <hi>Rom.
3.</hi> 17. and Satans enmity to it, <hi>Joh.</hi> 8. 44. So that
peace only is to be regarded whereof the Lord is
the bestower and approver: a peace that is not pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>judicial
to truth and holiness, <hi>Heb.</hi> 12. 14. but on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
curbeth and restraineth our sinful and turbulent
humours, 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 12. 20. for, he prayeth for such
a peace, while he seeketh peace from God, and
sheweth it cannot be had but from him, while he
saith, <hi>the Lord of peace himself give you peace.</hi>
5. Though peace among Christians be a special
work of God (see <hi>doct. 4.)</hi> and therefore to be
sought from him; yet our prayers of that kind
should be seconded by our own serious endeavours
and all lawful means assayed for that end, so, as
that we not only carefully eschew whatever may
on our part give cause of renting, 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 8. 13.
but also be not easily provoked, when cause of
renting is given by others, 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 13. 5. and that,
when a rent is made, we spare no pains, nor stand
upon any thing, which is properly our own, for
having it removed, <hi>Gen.</hi> 13. 8, 9. and do not wea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry
to follow after peace, when it seemeth to fly
from us, <hi>Heb.</hi> 12. 14. and all our endeavours have
but small appearance of present success, 2 <hi>Cor.
12.</hi> 15. for, while he seeketh peace from God <hi>by
all means,</hi> he doth indirectly incite them to seek
after it by all means. 6. The peace and concord
which should be sought after among Christians is
not an outside agreement only, <hi>Psal.</hi> 55. 21. nor a
<pb n="453" facs="tcp:61385:232"/>
meer cessation from debate and strife for a time,
until either party see an offered advantage, but a
lasting, solid and continuing peace; and therefore
an union in hearts<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> 
                  <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>nd affections, <hi>Phil.</hi> 2. 2. which
being once united, are not easily rent asunder,
1 <hi>Sam.</hi> 18. 1. with 19. 2. an union in truth not in
errour, <hi>Isa.</hi> 8. 12. so that neither party may have
reason to repent their entering it; And an union
not in a carnal but a spiritual interest, even that
they may strive together for the faith of the Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>spel,
<hi>Phil.</hi> 1. 27. for, he prayeth <hi>the Lord to give
them peace alwayes,</hi> that is, a lasting solid peace.
7. As the Lords gracious presence with his people
in any plentiful measure is annexed to their peace<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able
frame of spirit, and serious endeavours after
peace and concord among themselves: and as their
implacable renting humours do grieve the Lords
spirit, and provoke him to withdraw from them:
So sound peace and concord among societies doth
much depend upon the Lords gracious presence,
which where it is, doth not a little quiet and put
to silence our renting and dividing humours.
Neither can there be any sound or solid peace
but among the people with whom God is: for,
the grant of those two petitions seem here pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sented
as mutually depending upon one another:
<hi>The Lord give you peace alwayes,</hi> and <hi>the Lord
be with you all.</hi>
               </p>
               <pb n="454" facs="tcp:61385:233"/>
               <q>Ver. 17. The salutation of Paul with mine own
hand, which is the token in every Epistle: so I
write.</q>
               <p>Before he conclude with his usual farewel wish,
<hi>v.</hi> 18. he doth here premit a Preface to it, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in,
having called the following wish his <hi>salutation,</hi>
that is, an expression and testimony of his good
will and affection, he shews he did write it with
his <hi>own hand</hi> and that it was his use so to do at
the close of <hi>every Epistle</hi> which did serve as <hi>a
token,</hi> or certain mark, whereby his own Epistles
might be distinguished from all others forged and
feigned in his name, and he hints at the reason
why it was such a differing mark, to wit, because
his way of writing was alwayes uniform, and hard<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
could be undiscernably counterfeited by any
other, which is implyed, while he saith, <hi>So I write.
Doct.</hi> 1. The sending of salutations by word or
writ, that we may thereby testifie our continuing
affection to absent friends, is not a matter of com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon
courtesie and good manners only, but a duty to
be performed for conscience sake, as tending to
entertain love and good will among Christians;
for, while <hi>Paul</hi> doth never omit to send his salu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation,
it evidently appeareth he did not look upon
it as a matter of complement but of conscience.
<hi>The salutation of Paul.</hi> 2. Our salutation, whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
of present or absent friends, should express
our wishes to God for things spiritual and the
choicest mercies to be bestowed on them, wherein
we ought to be real, hearty and affectionate, and
<pb n="455" facs="tcp:61385:233"/>
not formal, or acted from the force of custom on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly:
for, he calleth his farewell-wish, <hi>v.</hi> 18. to
which he annexeth an hearty <hi>Amen,</hi> his salutation.
<hi>The salutation of Paul.</hi> 3. It hath been an an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cient
slight of Satan, and of his instruments to
thrust upon the Church (so far as in them did lye)
false and forged writings, and give them out for
Canonick Scripture, thereby to make the truth
and authority of all Scripture questionable; for, to
prevent such impostures, <hi>Paul</hi> did write his <hi>saluta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
with his own hand which is the token in every
Epistle,</hi> saith he. 4. That God hath sufficiently pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vided
in his Word against the forementioned evil:
see upon <hi>Col. 4. v. 18. which is the token in every
Epistle, so I write.</hi>
               </p>
               <q>Ver. 18. The grace of our Lord Jesus Christ be
with you all. Amen.</q>
               <p>Resteth the very thing, which he did so write,
with which he shuts up the Epistle, to wit, his hear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty
with that the free and undeserved favour of God
in Christ, with all the fruits and tokens of it, might
be conveyed unto them <hi>all</hi> without exception, to
which he affixeth his <hi>Amen,</hi> signifying <hi>Let it be so,</hi>
and it shall be so, in testimony both of his fervent
desire and confidence. <hi>Doct.</hi> 1. Whatever be the
eminence of a person or persons, for their inhe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rent
graces and gracious qualifications; yet it is
only God free-grace and undeserved favour, and
not their own merit, which must be relyed on for
closing their accounts, or for obtaining any spiritual
or temporal mercy at the hands of God: for,
<pb n="456" facs="tcp:61385:234" rendition="simple:additions"/>
though he commended them highly for their pati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence,
faith, love, and other graces, <hi>chap.</hi> 1. 3, 4. yet
he closeth all by wishing Gods free grace and fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vour
to them, as the fountain-cause of all things
they stood in need of or could expect. <hi>The grace
of our Lord Jesus Christ be with you.</hi> 2. As
there is an inexhaustible fountain of free grace in
God, which can water all, without exception of any,
and will extend it self to as many as he seeth fit,
<hi>Rom.</hi> 9. 18. So the more of it we wish unto, or, is
according to our wish bestowed upon others, there
doth not the less remain behind unto our selves:
for <hi>Paul,</hi> who wisheth grace and favour to them
all, had received a very large measure of it himself,
and knew that how large a measure soever was be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stowed
upon them, there would not be the less for
him. Therefore doth he thus close, <hi>The grace,</hi> &amp;c.</p>
