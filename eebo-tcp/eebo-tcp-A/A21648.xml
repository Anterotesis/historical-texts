            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

and presumption of offendours, the same ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uerthelesse
do rather growe then abate: hath
thought mete at this present to deuyse with
her counsell, howe some fewe necessary lawes
very beneficiall for this tyme, might be duely
executed and obserued, as they were meant, to
the weale of the Realme, and comforte of her
Maiestie. For which purpose her Maiestie ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ueth
all maner her subiectes to vnderstande,
that lyke as the last yere a certayne abbreuiat
of Statutes was made and published by order
of her Counsayle vpon her commaundement,
&amp; was by the Iustices of peace in diuers coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>treys
diligently regarded, and in a great part
put towardes execution, though in some other
partes, for lacke of tyme the same toke not so
good effecte: So her Maiestie chargeth al ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner
her Iustices and other ministers to whom
the same shall belonge, to take in hande again
theyr former charge geuen to them the laste
<pb facs="tcp:24904:3"/>
yere, for therecution of the sayd Statutes, ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stenyng
theyr assembles for that purpose now
in the begynnyng of this Sommer, so as their
doynges may be certified in such sort, as they
were commaunded &amp; prescribed the last yere.</p>
            <p>And besydes these, her Maiestie fyndeth
lyke cause to haue two other great enormities
dayelye encreasyng in this her Realme, to be
spedely refourmed, for which there do remaine
in force good lawes. The one is, the monstru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous
abuse of Apparell almost in al estates, but
principally in the meaner sort. The other is,
the decay and disfurniture of all kynde of hor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ses
for seruice within the Realm. And because
her Maiestie perceaueth, that although the
lawes be verye penall in both these cases, yet
without some speciall direction geuen for the
execution therof, the reformation wyl not en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sue:
Her Maiestie hath caused the Statutes
remaynyng in force for both the sayde purpo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ses
to be briefely collected, &amp; presently by this
her Proclamation, chargeth all maner her she<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ryffes
to publyshe the same ioyntly with this
Proclamation, and to fyx the same vp in pla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces
accustomed.</p>
            <p>And for the maner of the spedy execution of
the Statutes for apparell<note place="margin">Apparell.</note> and other enormi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties
incident therto: Her Maiestie hath caused
certayne good ordinaunces to be deuysed and
accorded by her counsell, which also her Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iesties
pleasure is, to be wel regarded, straight<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
kept, and obserued accordyng to the seueral
limitations thereof. Wherefore there is good
<pb facs="tcp:24904:3"/>
hope conceaued by her Maiestie of a spedye re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dresse,
by meanes of the sayd good orders. And
yf in any poynt of the same statutes or orders,
any dout shall aryse for the vnderstandyng of
the same: her Maiestie wylleth that the aduise
and aunswere of her priuie councell be requi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red
and folowed. And for the other default ten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dyng
to the decay of horses within the Realm,
which partly ryseth by stealyng and carryinge
numbers of Horses, Geldynges, Mares, and
Coltes out of the Realme, and by neglectynge
the breedyng and kepyng of Horses within the
Realme, accordyng to the lawes prouyded:</p>
            <p>For redresse of the former part concernyng
carrying out of Horses out of the Realme:<note place="margin">Carrying of Horses out of the Realme.</note> her
Maiestie chargeth al maner her subiectes and
others within her Realme, to take knowledge

and not to trust in any remission of penalties

<pb facs="tcp:24904:4"/>

hereof: her Maiestie also meaneth to
cause a speciall vieu to be taken throughe the
Realme in September next, of the numbre in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quirable

as is aboue expressed: and a lyke muster<g ref="char:punc">‚ñ™</g> and
