            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

every common Trooper to be diſmounted, to deliver up his Horſe and Arms, and to receive the promiſed re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward of twenty ſhillings to bear their charges home (it being too little for many of them (my Countrey<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men) that have neer Five hundred Engliſh miles home) It is not to be credited how much this Army is be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come in their eſteem, during this Ceſſation; and what ſorrowful expreſſions many of them do make; that they have been thus deluded concerning our carriage; the moſt ingenuous of them affirming, the wayes of the Court at <hi>Oxford</hi> have never been rightly repreſent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed unto them. Officers and Souldiers unanimouſly de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſire imployment for <hi>Ireland,</hi> being willing to take the Sacrament-Oath, or to give what other Obligation ſhall be thought fit, That as they will never bear Arms in <hi>England</hi> againſt the Parliament, ſo will they not when they are imployed in <hi>Ireland</hi> by the Parliament, deſiſt from purſuing their Commands againſt the Iriſh Rebels, upon anp invitations of the Kings: They af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firming, They have ſufficiently ſmarted for being in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticed formerly by him. This I onely offer to your conſideration, to make what uſe of it ſhall be thought convenient; and if it ſhall be thought fit to imploy them into <hi>Ireland,</hi> it is requiſite ſome of the Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mittee of the Army for Iriſh affairs, or other chief Officer be ſent down with all poſſible ſpeed that may be to <hi>Salisbury,</hi> where theſe may be met marching to their ſeveral homes, and will be ready to hearken to any Propoſition of Imployment that way: Likewiſe ſome of the Horſes may be allowed to go upon that Service, if it be deſired, which is thought better to be granted (upon a ſecond conſideration) then at the Dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>banding
<pb n="5" facs="tcp:113489:3"/>
to permit them, to let them and their Horſes Quarter in a body upon the Countrey, and give thoſe diſturbances that the other Horſe of this kinde have done neer <hi>Baſing.</hi> I think you may have a thouſand Officers, Souldiers, and Reformadoes by the firſt of <hi>April,</hi> will be at any Rendezvouz upon the Sea-Coaſts to be mounted and tranſported for <hi>Ireland.</hi> It is now a fit time to take the ſame into conſideration, which is the onely cauſe of my preſumption to mention it unto you, if the wiſdom of the Parliament ſhall think fit to imploy them again.</p>
            <p>Every hour more Gentlemen of quality do come in: And this day Colonel <hi>Trevanian</hi> come from <hi>Peurin,</hi> and ſome of his Officers came to <hi>Truro</hi> with their Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lours flying, and their men armed, even from the Lord <hi>Hoptons</hi> Head-quarter. This hath wrought ſuch opera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion upon the Governour at <hi>St. Mawes</hi> (the principal Fort that commands the Haven at <hi>Falmouth,</hi> having a greater command thereof, then the Caſtle and Fort of <hi>Pendennis</hi>) that he hath ſent to the General to be re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived into favour, and will deliver up the Caſtle, Fort, Ordnance, Arms and Ammunition: and accordingly there is Forces ſent away this night to take poſſeſſion thereof.</p>
            <p>Thus you ſee how God doth work for us, and for the good and welfare of this Land; and let nothing in this great buſineſſe done in this Countrey in ſo ſhort a time, where ſo little hopes of ſucceſſe was expected, be attributed unto man, but ſolely unto God who or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders affairs thus ſo much for the publike good.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Arundel</hi> the Governour of <hi>Pendennis,</hi> ſent to tempt the Governour at <hi>St. Mawes</hi> to come in the Caſtle of
<pb n="6" facs="tcp:113489:4"/>
               <hi>Pendennis,</hi> he refuſed the ſame, and as aforeſaid craved the aid of this Army. There are two great braſſe pieces of Ordnance in the Fort, of about Four thouſand weight a piece. For the Caſtle of <hi>Pendennis,</hi> I make no doubt as ſoon as this Army is totally Disbanded (which though it begin to morrow, will take too or three dayes before it be ended) make what ſpeed we can; we ſhall finde them tractable; if not, we ſhall ſettle this County in ſuch a poſture of Security againſt that place, as will compel them in a ſhort time to hearken to worſe Propoſitions then they now might have had, if they perſiſt in a refuſal of the Summons intended to be ſent them. Sir <hi>John Arundel,</hi> (who ſent former<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly) Sir <hi>John Meux,</hi> Sir <hi>Henry Haſtings,</hi> and many other Commanders and Gentlemen of quality, have all ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cepted of Paſſes and Protections; and (unaminouſly) Officers and Souldiers do all agree, and would be en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gaged by Oath to oppoſe French, or Iriſh (though of the Kings ſending in) to their utmoſt: And that which hath wrought upon many of their ſpirits, and (eſpeci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally of the whole County of <hi>Cornwal</hi>) was, the Letter ſent from <hi>Glamorgan</hi> (His Majeſties principal Agent with the Iriſh Rebels) ſignifying to the Prince an in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tention, to ſend over Iriſh (being a Duplicate of that Packet which we took at <hi>Padſtow.</hi>) Thus hath God turned that to the Kings, and the bloody Iriſh Rebels diſadvantage, which he and they had thought to have made their means of continuing the War in <hi>England:</hi> And I hope God will ſo order it, That thoſe men they expected here to fight for them, will be as valiant, and as zealous as any againſt them. To morrow aſſoon as the firſt Brigade is disbanded, there goeth Forces to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards
<pb n="7" facs="tcp:113489:4"/>
               <hi>Pendennis;</hi> and as there is occaſion to give you an account of that, or any other buſineſſe, you ſhall not fail to receive the ſame. I thought good to ſend this Meſſenger Poſt with this, leſt my former Letters did miſcarry, or miſ-reports ſhould ariſe by the long con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinuance of this Treaty, deſiring you to conſider him for the greatneſſe of the Journey: None ſhould have been more willing to have undertaken it then my ſelf, but that the buſineſſe of the Atmy is now greater then ever it hath been, ſince I had the honour and happineſſe to ſerve therein.</p>
            <p>This day ſome of the Princes ſervants who are come to the Head-quarters, ſay That the Prince is landed at <hi>Ceely,</hi> that they left him there, that his condition is mean: Proviſions muſt be ſent from hence, or he, and that poor Family with him cannot long ſubſiſt. They curſe <hi>Hyde</hi> and <hi>Culpepper,</hi> and deſire they might have no other Executioner then themſelves, for the Treaſon committed by them in carrying away the Prince, and to be ſo deceitfull in doing the ſame, as to publiſh a De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>claration in the Princes Name, the day before he went, That there was no ſuch intention, and that none about him ſhould preſume to ſpeak a word to that purpoſe, and yet the next day on a ſudden ſhipp'd him, and car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ried him to Sea: He was three dayes at Sea before he got to <hi>Ceely,</hi> the winde being croſſe, and forced him to ſayl at a diſtance.</p>
            <p>There is ſuch care taken in the Army by the General and Lieutenant General, that I am confident, not one man that came off upon this Treaty, ſhall be plundered to the value of two pence: So much our Souldiers have forgotten former injuries, and inclinable (I may
<pb n="8" facs="tcp:113489:5"/>
ſay it) and (beyond expectation) to requite good for evil.</p>
            <p>It is late, and I have much buſineſſe more to do this night, in order to the buſineſſe to morrow, and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore muſt abruptly break of, and remain,</p>
