            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>

               <q>
                  <bibl>ROM. viii. 18.</bibl>
For I reckon, that the Sufferings of this preſent Time, are not worthy to be compared with the Glory which ſhall be revealed in us.</q>
            </epigraph>
            <p>OUR Bleſſed Saviour hath diſcovered very much Plainneſs, Ingenuity, and Candour, in propounding his Religion to the World, and offering it to Peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ples acceptance. And he hath manifeſted ſingular Love and Faithfulneſs towards his Diſciples and Followers; more particularly with reference to the Sufferings and Inconve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niences to which they may be expoſed on his Account, and for the ſake of their Religion, whilſt they are in this World.</p>
            <p>He doth expreſly warn thoſe, who have a mind to eſpouſe his Faith and Religion, of the Diſcouragements which may be in their way; aſſuring all thoſe who will follow him, and give up themſelves to his Government, that they muſt look for Trou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bles and Diſturbances. He tells them plainly, they muſt not dream of Eaſe, and worldly Proſperity, and of going to Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven on a Carpet-way; that ſo they may duly weigh Matters; and ingage in his Cauſe, with a diſpoſition of Mind ſuited to a ſuffering-Eſtate, ſince they muſt paſs <hi>through many Tribulati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons into the Kingdom of God.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>And as he hath plainly told us, what we muſt expect and pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pare for if we will be his Diſciples; ſo his Love to, and Concern for his People, doth wonderfully appear, in that he hath made ſuch plentiful proviſion for their Support and Encouragement a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt all the Hardſhips and Difficulties they may be called to grapple with. He aſſures them of ſufficient Aſſiſtance and Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fort, during all their Conflicts and Trials, and of ſuch recom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pences afterwards as are enough to blunt the edg of all Inſtru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments, and abate the force of all Strokes which ſhall be im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ployed againſt them, as they are ingaged in his Cauſe. He will
<pb n="4" facs="tcp:48344:3"/>
protect and animate, and bear them out in all that can befal them on his account. He will give them his Holy Spirit to ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>port, comfort, and refreſh them in the moſt furious and out<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ragious Attaques of their Adverſaries. He will reſent all that is done to them, as done to himſelf in Perſon. He will moſt certainly be avenged of all thoſe who ſhall any way wrong and injure them. Yea, he will honour, reward, and crown their Patience and Sufferings in the End, with an Inheritance and Glory which doth unconceivably overbailance the weight of all thoſe Preſſures, under which they may at preſent groan and be uneaſy.</p>
            <p>And he gives ſuch full and large Aſſurances of thoſe Rewards with which he will recompence the Sufferings of his People, that whoſoever doth but duly conſider them, and then compare this Glory with the greateſt Sufferings which can poſſibly befal ſincere Chriſtians during this preſent Time, he may eaſily and certainly attain to a ſound, ſtrong, and ſatisfactory perſwaſion, that theſe preſent Sufferings are unconceivably leſs than that Bleſſedneſs is whereunto they ſhall be advanced.</p>
            <p>This is what the words I have now read unto you, do ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſly inſtruct us in.</p>
            <p>Where you may take notice of theſe two things:</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Firſt,</hi> How much that Glory, ſuffering Believers ſhall be crowned and recompenced with, doth tranſcend all the Suffer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings they can be called to endure whilſt they be in this World.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Secondly,</hi> The firm and ſolid perſwaſion our Apoſtle had touching this Matter. I reckon upon a due and thorow com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>paring of Matters on each ſide, after a juſt computation, and caſting up of all Accounts; having weighed and conſidered things impartially and faithfully on both Hands, I am fully ſatisfied, I am firmly aſſured, I do reſt ſettled in this concluſion, <hi>That the Sufferings of this preſent Time are not worthy to be compared with the Glory which ſhall be revealed in us.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Here are two Points then to be briefly diſcourſed.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Firſt,</hi> That the greateſt Sufferings ſincere Chriſtians can be expoſed unto for their Religion whilſt they are in this World, do not bear a proportion with the greatneſs and excellency of that Bleſſedneſs and Glory with which they ſhall be recompen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed in the next World.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="5" facs="tcp:48344:3"/>
               <hi>Secondly,</hi> That this is ſo certain and evident, we may be ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tisfied and aſſured concerning it at preſent.</p>
            <p>Firſt, <hi>The greateſt Sufferings ſincere Chriſtians can be expoſed unto for their Religion, whilſt they are in this World, do not bear a proportion with the Greatneſs and Excellency of that Bleſſedneſs and Glory with which they ſhall be recompenſed in the next World.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>True Chriſtianity is ſo oppoſite unto, ſo deſtructive of, all the Deſigns and Intereſts of Satan, and ſo contrary to the Luſts and Practices of ungodly Men, the Prince of Darkneſs, and his Adherents will undoubtedly do their utmoſt, to make the profeſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion and practice of it, as uneaſy and frightful unto People as poſſibly they can; ſo that as long as Satan remains unchained, or has any liberty permitted him; and Idolatry, Superſtition, Wickedneſs and Debauchery do prevail on Earth, thoſe who will approve themſelves firm to the Religion of their dear Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viour, muſt expect many violent Aſſaults, and that they ſhall be much moleſted and diſturbed in their Paſſage to another World, under the open profeſſion and practice of the <hi>Goſpel-Faith, and Laws.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>But we have this Incouragement, to perſiſt and hold faſt our Integrity, to contend for, and continue in our Chriſtian Faith and Courſe, that let what will befal us at preſent, we ſhall be no loſers, but extraordinary gainers, by our approving our ſelves faithful to our God, and to our Religion, in the midſt of the greateſt Sufferings; <hi>For the Glory which ſhall be revealed in us,</hi> will abundantly compenſate for all the incommodious Oc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>currences, and moſt penetrating Inſtances which can at preſent happen unto us.</p>
            <p>Let us now a little conſider the Sufferings which are incident unto us here for our Religion, and then enquire a little after the Glory with which we ſhall be recompenſed hereafter, if we deport our ſelves aright under our preſent Sufferings; and then I will prove to you, that the greateſt Sufferings here do not bear a proportion to that Glory.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Firſt,</hi> We are in the firſt place to conſider thoſe Sufferings which are incident unto us at preſent on the account of our Religion. And in general they are very great, conſidered
<pb n="6" facs="tcp:48344:4"/>
ſimply in themſelves, and they may be of long continuance, if compared only with the Abode we are to make in this World: We may expect to ſuffer what can be deviſed and inflicted as the Reſult of that Malignity, Hatred, and Enmity, Satan and wicked Man have to our moſt holy Faith. And therefore we had need be well provided with Grace in our Hearts, and to be expert in uſing the whole Chriſtian Armour, that our Spirits may not ſink, nor our Strength fail us in the evil day.</p>
            <p>But tho theſe Sufferings may be great conſidered ſimply in themſelves, yet very much of their Horror and Dreadfulneſs do depart as ſoon as we compare them with the Glory which ſhall be revealed in us.</p>
            <p>The Sufferings we are more eſpecially here to take notice of, are thoſe Safferings we are expoſed unto in this preſent Life, on the account of the true Religion, by reaſon of the Perverſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs and Fury of wicked Men, as irritated and employed by Satan in order to the withdrawing of People from the Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſſion of the true Faith, and ſerious Practice of real Holineſs, and the deterring of others from engaging themſelves in this cauſe. Theſe Sufferings are all comprized in the word <hi>Perſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cution.</hi> And here they ſhould be conſidered in their moſt for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>midable Dreſs, in their moſt frightful Appearances. They may be reduced under theſe Heads.</p>
            <p n="1">1. Outward Loſſes. We may on the account of our Religion, be brought into ſuch ſtraits, that we muſt part with all our deareſt and tendereſt Relations: We may be ſepara<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted from the Wife of our Boſom, and the Children of our Affection, or ſee them inhumanly treated, and moſt barba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rouſly uſed before our Eyes. We may be deprived of all our Eſtates, Riches, Houſes, and uſeful Accommodations; heavy Fines, preſſing Mulcts may be impoſed on us. We may be reduced from plentiful Eſtates, to the extreameſt Penury, Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kedneſs and Want: We may loſe our Liberty, and be forced into ſoul and loathſome Conſinement; we may exchange con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venient and delightful Habitations, comfortable and pious Converſation with Religious Friends and Acquaintances, for deep and dark Dungeous, and the horrible Society of the vileſt and moſt impious Miſcreants.</p>
            <p n="2">2. Corporal Pains. We may be called to ſuſtain the keeneſt and moſt penetrating Pains that envious and malicious Inge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nuity
<pb n="7" facs="tcp:48344:4"/>
can deviſe: Our Fleſh may be torn from us by piece<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>meal, our Joynts may be wrack'd one from another, our Bones may be broke in pieces, and all thoſe Tortures may be experimented on us, which can be occaſioned by the uncivi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lized uſe of Water, Iron, Fire, and the perverted mixture of all the Elements.</p>
            <p n="3">3. Reproach and Infamy. We may be expoſed to the Scorn and Contempt of all who are void of Grace, yea who are loaden with ill Nature, impregnated by Popiſh Principles. We may be accuſed and have the moſt deteſtable Crimes im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>puted and laid to our Charge: We may be publickly re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſented as the moſt execrable Villains, and be made as the <hi>Dung and Off-ſcouring of all thing;</hi> we may be leſt open to the Inſolence and Taunts of all who are deſtitute of Civility and common Breeding; yea, who have learn'd to expreſs Hatred and Malice in the moſt enormous Inſtances of Spitefulneſs and Diſgrace.</p>
            <p n="4">4. Death it ſelf; yea we may be brought to die a great many Deaths in one: We may be put to the moſt infamous, the moſt lingering, the moſt torturing, the moſt intricate ſorts of Death that can be deviſed: We may be brought to under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>go whatſoever can be found out, whereby Suffering and Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſery may be repreſented execrable, and ſet off with Oſten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation.</p>
            <p>In ſhort, our Sufferings may be very various; innumerable Inſtances of Cruelty may be experimented on us, if poſſible, to the glutting and ſurfeiting of the truculent and inſatiable Adverſaries of our Faith. Theſe may be often repeated, that ſo we may feel their whole Force and Keeneſs. Our Sufferings may be of long continuance, conſidered only with reſpect to the time we ſhall ſpend on Earth.</p>
            <p>But yet let me note unto you (by the way) that tho all this may be poſſible, yet God doth very ſeldom (if ever) permit his ſingle Servants to be exerciſed with very numerous ſorts of Cruelty, and to be long continued under their Trials. But whatever the Deſigns of their Enemies may be, he or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders ſome way or other, that their Sufferings ſhall be mode<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rated either for Kind, Number, or Duration.</p>
            <p>But let us magnify and raiſe the Idea of horrible Sufferings to the utmoſt, wherein they can poſſibly be inflicted on ſincere
<pb n="8" facs="tcp:48344:5"/>
Chriſtians here, yet their Terror and Frightfulneſs will in a great meaſure diſappear, when duly compared with the future Glory. Which leads me,</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Secondly,</hi> To enquire a little after that Glory, ſuffering Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrians ſhall be recompenſed with hereafter. Now concerning this Glory, you may obſerve,</p>
            <p n="1">1. That it doth import the bleſſed and happy Eſtate thoſe who ſuffer for the Faith of Chriſt, and Cauſe of true Holi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs, ſhall certainly be advanced unto in the other World. There is a moſt happy Inheritance and Eſtate provided for true Believers, into which they are ordinarily to enter through Sufferings and Tribulations. It is purchaſed for them by the Blood of the Son of God, it is ſecured unto them by the Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſe of the faithful and true God, who cannot lie. Actual Poſſeſſion is taken of it on their behalf by Chriſt their Head: And he is continually intereſting himſelf on their account, and interceding for their Admiſſion into it.</p>
            <p>This is an Eſtate of Joy and Pleaſure, ſo ſublime, ſo great, ſo excellent, that all the Inheritances and Delights of this World are but Dung and Filth when compared to it. Here true Chriſtians will be advanced to that height, the greateſt Honours and Priviledges of this World are leſs and more emp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty than Shadows when compared with it. Their macerated and abuſed Bodies, will here be made conformable to the glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rious Body, of their dear Saviour. All the Powers of their Souls will be mightily puriſied and inlarged. Here they will have all ſorts of Objects moſt exactly ſuited to their refined Capacities, which can adminiſter any Delight and Pleaſure un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to them. They will be free from every thing that can any way ſully, intermit, or obſtruct their perfect and moſt abſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lute Satisfaction. They will injoy God and Chriſt, all the Happineſs of Heaven, every thing that can refreſh, entertain, and pleaſe them, even all that is comprehended in thoſe great and comprehenſive Expreſſions, in which the Promiſes of the Goſpel are folded up.</p>
            <p n="2">2. It is an Happineſs which far exceeds all that we can conceive and apprehend at preſent: We may with reaſon enough uſe thoſe words concerning it, in which the Apoſtle deſcribes the glorious Myſteries of the Goſpel. <hi>Eye hath not</hi>

We may eaſily form Notions of more excellent things than this World can afford, but our ripeſt and moſt elevated Ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prehenſions of things great and good are as ſhort of what Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lievers will inherit, as the faint glimmering of the Glow-worm is of the moſt ſhining Brightneſs of the Sun. <hi>Our Life</hi>
               <note place="margin">Col. 3. 3.</note> and  our Happineſs is yet <hi>hid with Chriſt in God: Now we are the Sons of God, and it doth not yet appear what we ſhall be.</hi> 
               <note place="margin">1 Joh. 3. 2:</note>
            </p>
            <p n="3">3. But it will be fully made known and revealed. Sincere Chriſtians ſhall actually inherit what is at preſent too great and comprehenſive for them to underſtand and conceive. This Glory <hi>ſhall be revealed in them;</hi> they ſhall actually partake of it: it ſhall be diſcovered openly to their Comfort, and in the view af all their Adverſaries to their greater Aſtoniſhment and Confuſion, <hi>Luke</hi> 13. 28.</p>
            <p>It is called <hi>the Glory which ſhall be revealed in us: Glory</hi> in op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſition to the Shame and Diſgrace which may be caſt upon us here. <hi>The Glory which ſhall be revealed in us;</hi> we ſhall partake of, and inherit the ſhining raviſhing Luſtre and Brightneſs of all the Excellencies and Perfections of that happy Eſtate, which is now reſerved for us, and ſhall hereafter be fully diſcovered in the Kingdom of our God.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Thirdly,</hi> And now I am to prove to you, that the greateſt Sufferings which can befal us in this preſent time on the account of our Religion, have not any thing in them which may ren<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der them worthy to be taken notice of, as a Diſcouragement to us in our Chriſtian Courſe, when we conſider the glorious Eſtate, unto which we ſhall hereafter be advanced. The greateſt Sufferings here do not bear a Proportion with what we may warrantably expect. But that Glory which ſhall be revealed will abundantly exceed all that is offenſive and troubleſome in the Sufferings of this preſent time. For,</p>
            <p n="1">
               <pb n="10" facs="tcp:48344:6"/>
1. The greateſt of theſe Sufferings, yea, put them altogether, they do but touch our outward Part, and affect our outward Intereſts: they do not come near, they cannot of themſelves prejudice our higheſt and chiefeſt Concerns, our nobleſt and moſt excellent Part. Notwithſtanding all that Men may in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flict and do, our Souls will ſtill retain their own Liberty and Freedom, our Innocence and Integrity, our inward Peace and Comfort will remain unimpared, firm and inviolable. Hence our Saviour doth ſo aflectionately warn us not to fear them, who when they have done their worſt, cannot hurt our beſt Part, but muſt leave our Souls as ſafe, and our Uprightneſs as firm and entire as ever. <hi>I ſay unto you my Friends, be not afraid of them that kill the body, and after that have no more that they can do;</hi> Luk. 12. 4. But the Glory which ſhall be revealed re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lates unto, and w<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>ll powerfully affect both our Bodies and Souls in all their Parts and Capacities. It will inrich and beau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tify both in all reſpects to unimaginable degrees. All the Sufferings of this preſent time are not ſo much when compared to the Miſeries wicked Men muſt endure hereafter, as the ſmall ſcratch of a Pin, is to the Trouble and Torment of a ranck<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling Gangreen, and a wounded Spirit together. The Suffer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings of this Life, when compared with the future Glory, do not bear the ſame Proportion therewith, that the biting of a Flea, or ſtinging of a Gnat doth, with a whole Age of Pleaſure and Delight.</p>
            <p n="2">2. All the Sufferings of this Life put together, are not ſo great, but our Thoughts may eaſily comprehend them, and add to them ſomething worſe than Men can poſſibly inflict. Indeed the moſt tremendous Sufferings here are ordinarily leſs than our own Apprehenſions and Fears do make them; our own Minds and Suſpicions do commonly create the moſt troubleſome part of thoſe Sufferings we do endure. But this is certain, that our Sufferings are never ſo great from In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtruments, but we can readily form Notions of much greater. Whereas the Glory to be revealed is ſuch, that when we have mounted as high in Imagination as we can, we are much more defective in forming Notions pleaſing and delightful, anſwera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bly to what this Glory doth contain, than we do hyperbolize in magnifying Troubles and Calamities, when our Thoughts and Fancies do moſt exceed Realities.</p>
            <p n="3">
               <pb n="11" facs="tcp:48344:6"/>
3. The Sufferings of this preſent time tho they may appear long, when conſidered only with reſpect to our continuance in this World, yet they are very ſhort and momentary, if com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pared with the Duration of that <hi>Glory which ſhall be revealed.</hi> The Sufferings we may ſuſtain on the account of our Religion can at longeſt endure but the time of that ſhort ſtay we make here. They are but <hi>the Sufferings of this preſent time;</hi> they are at moſt of an uncertain and ſhort continuance: <hi>Weeping may indure for a Night, but Joy cometh in the Morning;</hi> Pſal. 30. 5.</p>
            <p>But on the other ſide, our Glory will be endleſs and eternal; ſo that on this account there is not ſo much proportion be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>twixt our Sufferings and our Glory, as there is between one minutes diſturbance and an entire Age, nay ſome thouſands of Years uninterrupted Pleaſure and Satisfaction.</p>
            <p>The Believer hath this advantage, that his annoying and trou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bleſome Occurrences will be of a very ſhort continuance, but what is grateful and raviſhing to him will be uninterrupted without decay, and without Period. His Sufferings on this account are not ſo worthy to be compared with his Glory, as one minute is to be compared with the longeſt Succeſſion of Ages. <hi>If need be that he be in heavineſs</hi> 
               <note place="margin">1 Pet. 1. 6.</note>(he muſt ſuffer no more than is expedient, and ſhall be uſeful unto him) his Heavineſs  muſt be but <hi>for a ſeaſon.</hi>
               <note place="margin">1 Pet. 5. 10.</note> If he muſt ſuffer, his Sufferings muſt continue but for <hi>a while,</hi> a very little ſhort time; but his Glory  will be everlaſting; his <hi>Inheritance is incorruptible, and undefiled, and that fadeth not away, reſerved in Heaven for him;</hi>
               <note place="margin">1 Pet. 1. 4.</note> as ſoon as his <hi>Earthly Houſe of this Tabernacle is diſſolved,</hi> he is to enter  into and take Poſſeſſion of <hi>an Houſe not made with Hands, eter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal in the Heavens.</hi>
               <note place="margin">2 Cor. 5. 1.</note>
            </p>
            <p n="4">4. The Glory ſincere Chriſtians ſhall inherit hereafter is ſo great and excellent, and doth ſo much exceed all their Suffer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings at preſent, that when it is duly apprehended by Faith, it doth exceedingly abate and mitigate, and almoſt annihilate the Force and Malignity of all that can be inflicted on them at preſent. This Glory apprehended by Faith doth ſo fill them with Comfort and Joy now in the midſt of their greateſt Sufferings, they can behave themſelves, as if they did not per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive any hurt or inconvenience by all that is inflicted on them. They can and do <hi>rejoyce in the hope of the Glory of God,</hi> 
               <note place="margin">Rom. 5. 2, 3.</note>
               <pb n="12" facs="tcp:48344:7"/>
yea, they do actually <hi>glory in Tribulations alſo.</hi> They can <hi>re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>joice</hi> and triumph <hi>that they are counted worthy to ſuffer ſhame for the Name of Chriſt;</hi>
               <note place="margin">Act 5. 41. Heb. 11. 35.</note> yea, ſcorn to <hi>accept deliverance when they are tortured, that they may obtain a better Reſurrection.</hi> And if our perceiving and laying hold of this Glory at preſent by Faith, makes it ſo much to overweigh all our Sufferings, when actually involved in them, how much muſt the Glory it ſelf in its full exhibition, tranſcend and exceed the Sufferings of this preſent Time.</p>
            <p n="5">5. The Sufferings of this preſent Time do contribute much towards our inveſtiture in the future Glory. So that conſidering our preſent Sufferings under their beſt Acceptation, they bear no more proportion to the Glory that ſhall be revealed, than the Means doth with the End. And the End muſt certainly be more excellent and worthy, than that which is but a Means and Inſtrument to bring about that End. <note place="margin">2 Cor. 4. 17.</note>
               <hi>Our light Affliction which is but for a moment, worketh for us a far more exceeding and eternal weight of Glory.</hi> Our Sufferings (you ſee) when com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pared with Glory, are but very ſhort and light, the Glory is <hi>far more exceeding, an eternal weight of Glory;</hi> it is not imagina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry, as the biggeſt part of our Sufferings are, but real and ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtantial. And theſe Sufferings do contribute to the fitting of us for, and the conducting and bringing of us to this Glory.</p>
            <p>Now here I muſt acquaint you, before I proceed to the other part of the Text, that they are not all kind of Sufferings in this Life, which will contribute to the conducting of People to that <hi>Glory which ſhall be revealed.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>People may, by their Vices, Wickedneſſes, and Immorali<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties, contract very much hurt, and grievous Sufferings upon themſelves. And theſe are ſo far from adminiſtring any Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lief, upon the conſideration of a future Glory, that they will rather fill with greater horror and confuſion. And without particular Repentance for the Facts which have made way for ſuch juſt and righteous Puniſhments, they will but open a paſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſage for the Sufferers, into Torments and Puniſhments uncon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceivably greater, more inſupportable and laſting than thoſe be which they at preſent endure.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="13" facs="tcp:48344:7"/>
Therefore if we would have Comfort and Support in the Sufferings which may be inflicted on us in this preſent Life, from the conſideration of the future Glory, we muſt take particular care, that if we ſuffer, it may be really for <hi>Religion, the Prote<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtant Religion,</hi> the Cauſe of the Lord Jeſus Chriſt. And that we bear our Sufferings with a truly Chriſtian Diſpoſition, and frame of Spirit. <note place="margin">1 Pet. 4. 12.</note>
               <hi>Beloved, think it not ſtrange concerning the fiery Trial, which is to try you, as though ſome ſtrange thing happened unto you. <note place="margin">Verſ. 13.</note>But rejoice, in as much as ye are Partakers of Chriſt's Sufferings, that when his Glory ſhall be revealed, ye may be glad al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſo with exceeding joy. <note place="margin">Verſ. 14.</note>If ye be reproached for the Name of Chriſt, happy are ye; for the Spirit of Glory, and of God, reſteth upon you: on their part he is evil ſpoken of, but on your part he is glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riſied. <note place="margin">Verſ. 15.</note>But let none of you ſuffer as a Murderer, or as a Thief, or as an Evil doer, or as a buſy-body in other Mens Matters. <note place="margin">Verſ. 16.</note>Yet if any Man ſuffer as a Chriſtian, let him not be aſhamed, but let him glorify God on this behalf,</hi> &amp;c. <note place="margin">Matth. 5. 10.</note>
               <hi>Bleſſed are they which are perſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cuted for Righteouſneſs-ſake; for theirs is the Kingdom of Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven<note place="margin">Verſ. 12.</note>—Rejoice and be exceeding glad; for great is your Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward in Heaven.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>More particularly our Sufferings will contribute much to our future Happineſs, if they be inflicted on us.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Firſt,</hi> For the True Faith.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Secondly,</hi> For the Purity of God's Worſhip.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Thirdly,</hi> Becauſe of our ſtrict and faithful ordering of our Lives and Converſations, by the Laws and Precepts of the Goſpel of Chriſt.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Firſt,</hi> For our firm adhering unto, and regular <hi>contending for that true Faith which was once delivered unto the Saints.</hi> Satan hath made it a great part of his Buſineſs to put Men of cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rupt Minds on the Adulterating of the Chriſtian Faith. He hath ſometimes prompted them to endeavour to depreciate, and al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moſt annihilate ſome of the main fundamental Articles of our Religion: Sometimes he hath furniſhed them with new Noti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, and then put them upon the aſſuming to themſelves an Authority to impoſe what he and they together have coined as Articles of the Chriſtian Faith.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="14" facs="tcp:48344:8"/>
Now thoſe Sufferings which are inflicted on us, by the Evil and Potent Adverſaries of the Truth, becauſe we will not re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nounce and part with the plain and obvious Doctrines of the Goſpel, nor own an Authority in the Church directly oppoſite to Chriſt's, nor eſpouſe and entertain the <hi>Traditions of Men, for the Doctrines of God,</hi> have a plain tendency to diſpoſe us for, and to give us a juſt claim, by virtue of the Promiſe of our Bleſſed Saviour, to that <hi>Glory which ſhall be revealed.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>Secondly,</hi> For our juſt and zealous Concern for the Purity of God's Worſhip, Satan and his Inſtruments have endeavoured, with all their Cunning and Might, to corrupt the Worſhip of God, by rejecting (at leaſt) ſome parts of his Inſtitutions, ſtrangely altering and defacing ſome eſſential Parts of his Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vice, and annexing Idolatrous and Superſtitious Obſervations unto that Worſhip God hath appointed, whereby they have done as much as they could, to render his Worſhip and Service altogether ineffectual to thoſe Bleſſed Ends and Purpoſes for which they were intended; and have changed the Truth and Subſtance of Devotion, for meer Formality, and a number of Oſtentations and Pompous, though very ludicrous and perni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cious, Rites.</p>
            <p>Now again, if we ſuffer becauſe we have a juſt Zeal againſt Idolatry and Superſtition, becauſe we will accurately obſerve all God's Inſtitutions in every one of their Parts; and be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe we will, as near as poſſibly we can, perform every part of his Worſhip, in the way and manner he preſcribes, then our preſent Sufferings will conduce much to our future Glory and Happineſs.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Thirdly,</hi> As every Article of the Chriſtian Faith, and every part of the Goſpel-Worſhip, is admirably adapted to engage us unto, and promote us in the leading of a very ſtrict, holy, and exemplary Converſation; ſo all the Corruptions of Faith and Worſhip, which have been vigorouſly advanced in the Chriſtian World, have had a direct tendency to open a way, <hi>at long-run,</hi> to the abounding of Debauchery and Immorality. This is very apparent as to all thoſe Inſtances in the Church of <hi>Some</hi> whereby ſhe hath corrupted in her Communion the Goſpel-Faith and Worſhip.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="15" facs="tcp:48344:8"/>
It is real Holineſs in our Lives, and a ſtrict conforming of our ſeveral Practices to the Rules of the Goſpel, which doth moſt oppoſe and weaken Satan's Intereſt in the World. And it is againſt this that he principally levels all his Deſigns.</p>
            <p>Though many of his Artiſices ſeem at the firſt view, to aim more immediately at ſomething elſe, and therefore are ordina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rily propounded in very winning Terms, and are gloſſed over with very hypocritical and deceiving Colours; yet whenever he ſucceeds, it is demonſtrably evident, that to ſupplant the <hi>Power of Godlineſs,</hi> was his chief Intent, as the fatal and ulti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mate reſult of all his Wiles.</p>
            <p>It is the malignity and hatred wicked Men have to the Power of Religion, which makes them to exert ſo much Vio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lence and Cruelty againſt thoſe who dare not allow themſelves in the Liberties they take, but do conſcienciouſly endeavour to approve themſelves unto their God, by a conſtant and diligent attendance to thoſe Laws and Commandments he hath given them. <note place="margin">Joh. 15. 19</note>
               <hi>If ye were of the World, the World would love his own; but becauſe ye are not of the World, but I have choſen you out of the World, therefore the World hateth you. <note place="margin">1 Pet. 4. 4.</note>They think it ſtrange that you run not with them to the ſame exceſs of Riot, ſpeaking evil of you.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Let us therefore take care ſo to govern our ſelves, that our <hi>Converſation may become the Goſpel of Chriſt,</hi> and that we may <hi>walk worthy of that high Vocation whereunto we are called,</hi> and that <hi>in every thing we may adorn the Doctrine of our God, and of our Saviour Jeſus Chriſt.</hi> Let us ſee to it, that our Lives may in all their Parts bear ſome proportion with the purity and ten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dency of our Faith, the Doctrines we own and profeſs, the Promiſes which are laid before us for our incouragement, the Example our Bleſſed Saviour himſelf hath given us, and the great Things we tell the World, we expect, and hope for; that ſo if we ſuffer here, it may be evident we ſuffer, becauſe we will not <note place="margin">Rom. 1<gap reason="illegible: faint" resp="#APEX" extent="2 letters">

               </note>
               <hi>be conformed to this World, but are transformed by the renewing of our Minds, and do approve what is the good, and ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceptable, and perfect Will of God.</hi> And then we may expect,  that <note place="margin">2 Cor. 1. 5.</note>
               <hi>as the Sufferings of Chriſt do abound in us, ſo our Conſolation alſo ſhall abound by Chriſt.</hi> We may then reſt aſſured that our preſent Sufferings ſhall be recompenſed with a Glory which
<pb n="16" facs="tcp:48344:9"/>
ſhall unconceivably exceed all that is troubleſome and afflicting in what we ſuſtain at preſent.</p>
            <p>If we ſuffer becauſe we will <hi>not make ſhipwrack of Faith and a good Conſcience,</hi> becauſe we offer unto God <hi>more excellent Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crifices</hi> than others; and becauſe it is our Care and Buſineſs <hi>to walk worthy of our God, unto all well-pleaſing, to be fruitful in every good Work, and increaſe in the Knowledge of God,</hi> we may certainly attain to be of ſuch a Temper as the Apoſtle here diſcovers in the Text. We may arrive to make the ſame de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>termination with our ſelves he did, and <hi>reckon, that the Suffer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings of this preſent Time, are not worthy to be compared with the Glory which ſhall be revealed in us.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Which leads me to the Second Point I took notice of from the words, <hi>viz.</hi>
            </p>
            <q>That ſincere Chriſtians may at preſent be throughly aſſured, that the Sufferings of this preſent Life, do not bear any proportion with the Glory they ſhall be recompenſed with hereafter.</q>
            <p>They may, upon a due weighing of the Sufferings of this preſent Time, and a future Glory together, attain ſuch a full conviction of the huge Advantage the Glory they ſhall be re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>warded with, hath, above all the Sufferings they can at pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent endure, as will mightily diſpoſe them to bear with great Equanimity, and encounter with wonderful Fortitude, all the uneaſy and frightful Occurrences unto which they can be ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſed in this World for the ſake of Chriſt, and on the account of their Religion.</p>
            <p>We have in the Text the ſedate and deliberate Judgment and Determination of one, who was as throughly accompliſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed to ſpeak to this Point, as any meer Man could be. He had experienced the Sufferings of <hi>this preſent Time,</hi> in as abundant Meaſures, and to as high Degrees as any Man; He felt all the ſmart and pain that Sufferings could produce. He had taken a view of Cruelty in its moſt various and terrifying Forms and Shapes; and had looked further into the <hi>future Glory,</hi> than any pious Soul can ordinarily ſee, whilſt it carries along with it this mortal Clog. So that here we have the concluſion
<pb n="17" facs="tcp:48344:9"/>
of one, who experimentally underſtood both the Nature and Extent of a Believer's Sufferings and Glory, better than any other Perſon upon Earth. You may read an account of his Sufferings in 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 11. 23, &amp;c. And you may gueſs how ſit he was to make a Judgment concerning the future Glory, from what he himſelf had experience of, as he re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ports it himſelf in 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 12. 4.</p>
            <p>But if we had not ſo expreſs a Teſtimony concerning this Buſineſs, from this Apoſtle; yet if we will but com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pare the greateſt Sufferings which have been inflicted on ſincere Chriſtians in any Age of the World, or the greateſt Sufferings we can imagine poſſible to be inflicted by Men, with thoſe excellent Accounts the Scriptures do give of the future Glory; and withal remember how ſhort all in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>telligible words do fall of expreſſing and deſcribing this Glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry to the full; that common Principle of Reaſon which directs and enables us to judg of, and determine the diffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rence there is between inferior Matters, when preſented to our Conſideration, muſt neceſſarily prompt us to conclude, that preſent Sufferings do not bear a proportion with the promiſed Glory.</p>
            <p>If we compare theſe Matters with Sedateneſs, and ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prove our ſelves impartial, Reaſon it ſelf, as aſſiſted by the Holy Scriptures, will as certainly direct us to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clude for the future Glory, as it will influence and autho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rize us to determine, that a maſſy Mountain is more ponderous than a Light and almoſt imperceptible Fea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther.</p>
            <p>We hugely wrong our ſelves, and injure the Inte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reſt of Piety, in that we wave the due comparing of Matters, and do not ſo diligently, and with ſuch conſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deration as becomes us, ſet the Incouragements we have to Virtue and Holineſs, in a juſt oppoſition to whatſoever may be pretended a Diſcouragement thereunto. Did we compare aright, eternal Inheritances with temporal Oc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>currences, and the uncertain, unſatisfying, ſhort-lived Honours, Pleaſures, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> of this World, with the certain, conſtant, uninterrupted, endleſs Torments and Miſeries of
<pb n="18" facs="tcp:48344:10"/>
the next World, we ſhou'd have more fixed and ſound Judgments and Reſolutions touching theſe things, than we ordinarily have.</p>
            <p>And if the common Principle of Reaſon will teach us to make ſuch a Determination on a due comparing of theſe matters together, how much more will our Minds be aſſured that the future Glory will abundantly tranſcend our preſent Sufferings, when we ſhall be enabled to pry further into theſe matters, and ſee them more diſtinctly, by having them ſet in a clearer Light through that ſpecial Illumination of the holy Spirit, God is pleaſed to beſtow on ſincere Chriſtians?</p>

And we read of <hi>others who were tortured, not accepting Deli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verance, that they might obtain a better Reſurrection;</hi> Heb. 11. 35.</p>
            <p>Having thus briefly diſcourſed of the two Points taken notice of from the Text, I ſhall raiſe a few Inferences from what hath been diſcourſed.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Firſt,</hi> This ſhould greatly endear the Proteſtant Religion unto us, and mightily confirm and ſettle us in the Profeſſion and Practice of it. The Proteſtant Religion is the only true Chriſtian and Scripture-Religion: It takes in and comprehends all that the Word of God doth teach and au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thorize, and it rejects and renounces every thing from being a part of Religion which the Scriptures do not warrant. All this is very evident and plain to thoſe who do impartial<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly compare our Religion with the holy Scriptures. The Proteſtant Religion is the Religion that is from above, <hi>and is firſt pure, then peacable, gentle, and eaſie to be intreated, full of Mercy and good Fruits, without Partiality and without Hypo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>criſy;</hi> James 3. 17.</p>
            <p>This is the Faith and Religion we are commanded by God himſelf <hi>to ſtand faſt in,</hi> and <hi>to contend earneſtly for;</hi> and as it were to enter into an Aſſociation to defend and maintain it againſt all the Attempts of its Adverſaries; for we are required <hi>to ſtand faſt in one Spirit, with one Mind, ſtriving to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether for the Faith of the Goſpel;</hi> Phil. 1. 27.</p>
            <p>The Proteſtant Religion is that which was the common Religion among the Apoſtles, and all good Chriſtians of old. It is the Religion of all the Reformed Churches at preſent: This is the Religion we all make a Profeſſion of, and it is ſuch a Religion, that if we be but ſincere in, and
<pb n="20" facs="tcp:48344:11"/>
true to it, we may ſuffer (if occaſion be) for it with Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fort, and the more we ſuffer for it, the greater meaſures of Glory we ſhall be recompenſed with at laſt. People may call what ever they fancy, and whatever their Inte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reſt doth incline them unto, by the Name of Religion: but it is the Proteſtant Religion which is the only true Chriſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>an Religion, and the only Religion which is worth ſuffering for.</p>
            <p>And if our Religion be ſuch as will bear us out in Suffer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings, yea, cauſe the greateſt Sufferings we can be expoſed unto for its ſake, to turn us to the moſt deſireable and ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vantagious account, how does it deſerve to be eſteemed by us? What a Zeal ſhould we have for it? How concerned ſhould we be on its behalf? With what firmneſs ſhould we adhere unto it? With what Courage and Reſolution ſhould we encounter all Difficulties we may meet with, whilſt in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gaged in and for it? With what aſſurance ſhould we own to the World that we are of this Religion? With what Care and Circumſpection ſhould we walk, that our Conver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſations may not thwart with, nor blemiſh, but every way accord and comport well with this Religion? What Va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lour and Excellency of Spirit ſhould we all manifeſt in op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſing and endeavouring to pull down (according to the Stations and Capacities we are in) all the Inſolent and Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bitrary Attempters to ſupplant and overthrow our Reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gion?</p>
            <p>This is the Religion God hath revealed, which he owns and will recompence, this is the Religion which leads to Glory. It is indeed a Religion the Men of this World do hate: And therefore its Profeſſors muſt expect but little courteous Entertainment from them: They muſt look for Tribulations and Sufferings as they paſs on their Pilgrimage through this Wilderneſs. But then it is a Religion which ſecures this advantage to all its faithful Profeſſors, That their Sufferings ſhall be their Gain, and the more they ſuffer on its account, the greater and more glorious their Reward ſhall be.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="21" facs="tcp:48344:11"/>
How dear ſhould that Religion be unto us, which aſſures us of ſuch a Glory, that all the Sufferings of this Life are as nothing when compared with it?</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Secondly,</hi> This ſhould hugely incourage and ſupport thoſe who do ſuffer for the Proteſtant Religion. The Prote<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtant Intereſt hath been at a very low Ebb a great many Years; very ſubtile, formidable, and general Deſigns have been on foot to deſtroy the Reformed Church. And as the Enemies of our Religion did conſidently pleaſe themſelves in all Nations with an Opinion that their Projects ſhould take effect, and that they ſhould certainly root out that only true Religion, which they call <hi>Hereſy;</hi> ſo no doubt they would have ſucceeded in their Attempts, had not God been on our ſide, who always hath been, is, and ever will be true and faithful to his Word and Promiſe.</p>
            <p>He hath built his Church on ſo firm and unmoveable a Rock, and hath ſo engaged his Faithfulneſs and Power on its behalf, that no Counſel or Strength ſhall ever be able to prevail againſt it.</p>
            <p>But tho God will not utterly forſake his People, tho he will not caſt them off for ever, yet he may permit the <hi>Plowers to plow long and deep Furrows on their Backs:</hi> He may ſuffer the Antichriſtian State to rage violently, and many of the <hi>Kings</hi> and Rulers <hi>of the Earth to take Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſel together,</hi> and ſet themſelves againſt the Proteſtant Churches.</p>
            <p>Theſe may treat the beſt Chriſtians with much Inſolence and Barbarity, but he all the time ſits upon the Throne of his Majeſty, and really <hi>laughs them to ſcorn,</hi> and derides the bloody Enemies of his Truth and Goſpel.</p>
            <p>God ſeems to wink at the Enemies of his Truth, and permits them to carry on their Deſigns ſo far as he thinks fit to over-rule their Methods and Courſes to Ends they ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver think of.</p>
            <p>But when his Peoples Droſs is purged away, and their Adverſaries have filled up the meaſure of their Iniquities, and are fully ripe for Vengeance, then will be open a way
<pb n="22" facs="tcp:48344:12"/>
for the ſolemn and illuſtrious conducting of his Church to that pure and proſperous Eſtate which he hath promiſed to place her even in this World, in the open view and ſight of the Nations.</p>
            <p>Great Multitudes of eminent Proteſtants have for many Years now paſt been very inhumanly treated: Great num<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bers are at this time very cruelly uſed, their Sighs and Groans do ſound loud, their Sufferings are very apparent and viſible.</p>
            <p>But poor Sufferers! be not you diſcouraged, your Groans do reach Heaven, they penetrate unto the <hi>Mercy-Seat, they come unto the Ears of your God,</hi> the Lord of Hoſts, <hi>who only is mighty to ſave.</hi> He is jealous for his Honour, he is <hi>jealous for his People,</hi> he will ariſe, he will help, he will be <hi>avenged of your Adverſaries,</hi> yea he will do it <hi>ſpeedily.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>God hath miraculouſly appeared to ſave and deliver his People in this Land: He hath ſetled us <hi>by his own Right<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hand,</hi> under the Protection and Government of a King and Queen, who have ſignally approved their Fidelity to, and Zeal for the Proteſtant Religion, and their Concern that the main Supporters of the Antichriſtian and perſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cuting Party may be brought down, and rendred uncapable any farther to play Reaks in God's Vineyard.</p>
            <p>And we have ground to hope that God is about to ariſe, and cloath himſelf with Vengeance; and that he will ſet ſuch Princes and Rulers, in a little time, over the Nations, <note place="margin">Rev. 1<gap reason="illegible: faint" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

            </p>
            <p>You who ſuffer for the Proteſtant Religion, either in <hi>Ireland, France,</hi> or any where elſe, take Heart, be not diſcouraged, be not diſmayed, but labour to poſſeſs your Souls with Patience. <note place="margin">Phil. 1. <gap reason="illegible: faint" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

               <hi>Be you in nothing terrified by your Ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſaries, which will be to them an evident Token of Perdition, but to you of Salvation, and that of God.</hi> Know you, and be aſſured, that <note place="margin">Rom. 13. 11.</note>
               <hi>now your Salvation is nearer than when you be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieved.</hi> 
            </p>
            <p>You ſuffer for the Cauſe of God, the Intereſt of Chriſt, the Truth of the Goſpel; which muſt, which will ſtand
<pb n="23" facs="tcp:48344:12"/>
and prevail, mauger all the Policy and Power both of Hell and Earth. Your Sufferings are taken notice of, and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>corded Above; and there is no unkind uſage you experi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence here, but your Head, the Lord Jeſus Chriſt, is tender<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly affected with it, and reſents it as done to himſelf in Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon; you do but tread in your Saviour's Steps. The more you ſuffer for him, the more you are conformed to him. You are walking to Glory, in the ſame path thorow which  your Maſter and Head entred in thither. <note place="margin">Rom. 8. 17.</note>
               <hi>If you ſuffer with him, you ſhall be glorified together nith him.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Now who would not ſuffer for Chriſt, and with Chriſt, when aſſured on doing ſo, he ſhall <hi>reign with him?</hi> Will not Heaven, and the higheſt Honour, and the greateſt Glory to be injoyed there, fully compenſate for all you can ſuffer here?</p>
            <p>He that will not ſuffer the Perſon, who gives but <hi>a Cup of cold Water to a Diſciple, in the Name of a Diſciple, to go without a Reward,</hi> will by no means be unmindful of, or ſuffer one who hath followed him through Tribulations and Sufferings, to miſs of the Glory and Inheritance which he hath promiſed to every Perſon who doth ſo.</p>
            <p>Take Courage all you ſuffering Proteſtants, and hold out chearfully. If you never deny Chriſt, he will never deny you. Support your ſelves with the precious Promiſes he hath given you. Incourage your ſelves from the conſide<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration of that great and wonderful Glory which ſhall be re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vealed in you; comfort your ſelves, and one another, with theſe words, <hi>ſo ſhall we ever be with the Lord.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>It is as righteous a thing with the Lord, to recompence you with Glory, <hi>Reſt,</hi> and Happineſs, who ſuffer for him, as it is <note place="margin">2 Theſ. 1. 6. <gap reason="illegible: faint" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

               <hi>to recompenſe Tribulation to them that trouble you.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>If you hold out and endure to the End, acting Faith and Patience, living upon the Promiſes, and drawing Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fort from the Glory which is treaſured up for you; with what Joy and Triumph may you part with this World, tho you ſhould be called to end your Days and Sufferings toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther?</p>

Becareful that you never ceaſe groaning and crying to your God. Let your fervent Prayers continually accom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pany to the Throne of Grace, the ardent Supplicati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons of all thoſe who ſympathize with you in your Suffer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings. Let none of us ever deſiſt from an earneſt vehement importunity with our God, till he hath actually made his Church <hi>the Joy of the whole Earth,</hi> or at leaſt have ſafely conducted us to that <hi>Glory which ſhall at laſt be revealed in all his Saints.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>Thirdly, Perſecution</hi> is a moſt horrible and inexcuſable Villany. The Name is ſo apparently odious, that no Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty, whilſt under the Guilt, and in the practice of the thing, will own it. Thoſe who have rendred themſelves excerable to the higheſt degree, by the open perpetrating of the moſt villanous Cruelties, on the faithful Profeſſors of the only true Religion, have had the impudence to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny (even whilſt their Hands and their Cloaths have been died with the reaking Blood of thoſe Innocent and Holy Perſons they have murdered) that they are Perſecutors. Others who have been guilty of the Sin to avoid the infamy of the Character, have choſen to call the unjuſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fiable Courſes they have applied themſelves unto, by ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther Name. But if God's People muſt ſuffer in their Names, in their Eſtates, in their Liberties, and as to their Lives, and all this for Religion, the thing is really the ſame as <hi>Perſecution,</hi> notwithſtanding the injurious Perſons may provide a leſs infamous Name for what they do.</p>
            <p>Perſecution is a Villany and Wickedneſs which is beſt and moſt exactly repreſented and expreſt by its own pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per Name. It thwarts and contradicts all the Dictates of Humane Nature; It breaks all the Ties and Bonds of com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon Civility. It is moſt oppoſite and contrary to, and moſt deſtructive of all the Purpoſes and Deſigns of every Part and Branch of the Chriſtian Religion.</p>
            <p>That which is moſt eſſential and peculiar to it, is, that it abuſes thoſe for whom God hath the greateſt love:
<pb n="25" facs="tcp:48344:13"/>
It vilifies and caſts Infamy upon them whom God will for ever glorify.</p>
            <p>And if God will reward his ſuffering perſecuted Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vants with the greateſt Meaſures of Glory, what ſhall be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come of the Perſecutors and Troublers of his People? Their Eſtate indeed is very dreadful. If they impenitently perſiſt in their perſecuting Courſe, it were better for them <hi>they had never been born;</hi> or being born, that <hi>a Mill<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtone were hanged about their Necks, and they thrown into the depth of the Sea.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>If Perſecutors do not repent, and this in good car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſt, and in due time, God will certainly curſe, and burn, and damn them to all Eternity. He will recompenſe the Troublers of his People, with the greateſt Meaſures of Anguiſh and Tribulation. Their Portion muſt be, that <hi>fiery Indignation which ſhall devour the Adverſaries.</hi> For them <hi>is reſerved the blackneſs of Darkneſs for ever.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>Fourthly,</hi> We may from what hath been diſcourſed, be put in mind of the Duty we owe (whilſt we are free from Sufferings) to thoſe Proteſtants who are in an afflicted and ſuffering Eſtate. Great numbers of Proteſtants have been ſuffering very ſevere things a long time for their Reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gion: They have long groaned under the Tyranny and Cruelty of their Oppreſſors.</p>
            <p>Bleſſed be God, we do enjoy the Goſpel with much freedom, eaſe, quiet, and plenty: But we muſt take care that we do not forget the Troubles of God's People in other places, eſpecially in our Neighbouring Countries, where our fellow-Proteſtants have ſuffered, and do ſuffer ſuch ſhameful and horrible Cruelties, that none of the an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cient Perſecutions have had any thing in them which may make them run parallel with the preſent.</p>
            <p>It is certain, we ought to lay to heart the afflicted Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dition of thoſe who are of the ſame Religion with us, our Bowels ſhou'd yearn over them; we ſhould labour to have our Souls poſſeſſed with Reſentments ſuitable to what they undergoe and endure.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="26" facs="tcp:48344:14"/>
And it greatly concerns us to preſent their Caſe (in our deepeſt Humiliations) unto our God. With what awful and earneſt importunity ſhould we wreſtle in our Prayers with the Lord on their behalf? With what reite<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rated vehemence ſhould we entreat God to ariſe and ſcat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter the Enemies of his Church, and make his Arm bare, and ſave his People which are appointed to deſtructi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on!</p>
            <p>O Lord awake, and ſtir up thy Power, and come and help. Hear thy People which prayeth unto thee; and wherein-ſoever the Enemies of thy Church do behave themſelves proudly, ſhew thy ſelf to be above them; plead thine own Cauſe with all thy haughty, cruel, and contemptuous Adverſaries, and maintain thou the Right of thy People, who look unto thee, and have long waited for thy Salvation. <note place="margin">Pſal. 74. 18, <hi>&amp;c.</hi>

            <p>But there is one thing more I would more particularly re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>commend to you, as a piece of Service we more eſpecially owe to our Suffering Brethren at this Time:</p>

            <p>We ſhould now be very free and liberal in imparting what we have, to ſupply the Wants and Neceſſities of our diſtreſſed Brethren, that comfortable Accommodations may be provided for them.

The better we are aſſured our ſelves of this, the better uſe we ſhall make of this Text in all the parts of our Lives. Let us labour to have our Minds poſſeſſed with as accurate Notions of both theſe things as we can; let us often think of each, and frequently com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pare both together. Let us never reſt ſatisfied till we have ſuch a Perſwaſion and Senſe of the future Glory as will make all things appear very little and inconſiderable, when<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever they offer to ſtand in competition with it. Let us be earneſt in our Prayers, that we may be indued with ſuch a Faith as may <hi>overcome the World,</hi> and may be indeed to us <hi>the Subſtance of things hoped for, the Evidence of things not ſeen,</hi> Heb. 11. 1.</p>
            <p>With what Life and Vigor ſhall we then perform all our Duties? With what Patience and Chearfulneſs ſhall we entertain and endure every afflicting Occurrence? With what Courage, Conſtancy and Triumph ſhall we go through, and accompliſh our Chriſtian Warfare? How freely ſhall we contribute what we have to thoſe who ſuffer?

How willingly ſhall we ſacrifice all for our Religion and the Publick-Weal? With what ſatisfaction may we look for the coming of Chriſt? And how confidently may we depend on our <hi>appearing with him in Glory?</hi>
