         <editorialDecl>
            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

into their Majeſties Service, without the Charge of being
preſſed or continued in Pay for the whole Year. And be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing

☞It is to be obſerved, that for want of ſuch Payment
as aforeſaid, the Seamen are greatly injured and diſcou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>raged;
firſt eſpecially when inſtead of Money they are put
off with Tickets, whilſt many of them and their Families
wanting Food and Rayment, are compelled to ſell ſuch
Tickets at one third parr, and ſometimes one half Loſs;
ſo that thereby the Seamens Pay is very ſmall and inſignifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cant,
who after having expoſed themſelves to the greateſt
Dangers, are ſo cut off, being but as Slaves and Drudges
to the common Ticket-Buyers and their Upholders, who
for ſupplying them ſo with Money do carry away the
greateſt part of their Labour, when many of their poor
Families are ready to periſh. Secondly, The paying ſuch
their Wages on board the Fleet at ſuch time as they are rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy
to ſail, is very injurious both to Seamen and others;
for by ſuch Means they have not the Opportunity to ſerve
themſelves or Families, but are obliged to buy all their Ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſaries
on board the Common Higlers or Boomboats, (and
they not many) who, making it their Buſineſs to attend the
Fleet, do, by their Extortion, bring away the greateſt
part of the Seamens Wages. So that a great part of the
Treaſure of the Nation, which ought to be divided a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mongſt
all, falls into the Hands of a few private Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons;
whereas, if ſuch Payment were to be made on ſhore,
as aforeſaid, they may have the Benefit to buy all they
want at the beſt Hand, to pay their Debts and relieve
their Families. And by this Means all ſuch Money would,
as from a Fountain, pleaſantly diſtil it ſelf into ſo many Sil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver
Streams, until it returns again to its firſt Riſe: which
would be a great Encouragement to Seamen and all other
their Majeſties good Subjects, who being now obliged to
give them and their Families Credit, are forc'd to ſit down
by Loſs, which is one great Cauſe of the Decay and Detri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment

☞If it ſhould be objected, that paying the Seamen
their Wages on ſhore (upon the Diſcharge of their Service
as aforeſaid) will cauſe them to deſert their Majeſties Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vice,
'tis humbly anſwered, that there being in <hi>England</hi> a
ſufficient Number to ſerve both their Majeſties Royal Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vy
and Merchants Ships at one time, as by ſufficient Teſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mony
did appear this laſt Summer, it is impoſſible to be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve
the Royal Fleet ſhould ever want Seamen, if good
Payment was to be made, and Encouragement given as
aforeſaid, for theſe Reaſons following. Firſt, They being
in ſuch Service are more ſecure from the Enemy than in
Merchants Ships. Secondly, Being allowed thirteen Months
to the Year, without After-claps, or paying Damages,
which (in Merchants Ships) often cuts off one Months Pay
in three. Thirdly, If a Ship of their Majeſties happen to
be loſt, the Seamens Wages ſtand good. Fourthly, Being
out of all Danger of being impreſs'd, during the whole
Voyage; by Means whereof in Merchants Ships they often
loſe both their Wages and Adventure. Fifthly, Having
a Proſpect in making Advantage by taking of Prizes.
Sixthly, If Loſs of Members happen, Smart-Money is al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowed,
with a yearly Penſion during Life. Seventhly, If
killed in Fight, a conſiderable Bounty-Gift is beſtowed on

                  <p>☞If it ſhould be objected that this may prove prejudi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cial

                  <p n="3">3. Many other Inconveniences there be attending the
preſent Diſcipline of the Navy, as paying the Fleet at
<hi>Portſmouth,</hi> &amp;c. whereby their Majeſties Affairs are often re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tarded,
and the Seamen whoſe Wives or Friends are very
populous about the River of <hi>Thames,</hi> do, by travelling and
attending at ſuch remote Parts, often expend more than
they receive, whereby many Families are ruined and un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>done:
And many others there be, who for want of Money
are obliged to take up all they want upon Truſt, paying
one Shilling for the Value of nine Pence, loſing thereby
<hi>25l. per Cent.</hi> and by ſelling their Tickets, as aforeſaid, they
generally loſe 30, 40, or <hi>50l. per Cent.</hi> ſo that by a modeſt
Computation their whole Loſs amounts to <hi>60l. per Cent.</hi> out
of their ſmall Wages.</p>
                  <p n="4">4. The turning of Seamen over from one Ship to another,
after having been in ſuch Service one, two, or three Years
without Money, produceth the ſame Effect as the former.</p>
                  <p n="5">5. For the aforeſaid Reaſons the Seamen, their Wives
and Friends, are at a great Charge and Trouble by petition<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
and attending the Admiralty and Navy-Board, (on
ſuch Occaſions) who ſpend great part of their Time in
hearing and examining theſe and ſuch like Grievances.</p>
                  <p n="6">
                     <pb n="22" facs="tcp:63333:12"/>
6. Whereas if Seamen were paid and encouraged as afore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſaid,
theſe Miſchiefs and Diſorders, with many others, oc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>caſioned
by ſeveral indirect Practices of the Clerks of the
Navy, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> would ſoon ceaſe and be aboliſhed.</p>
                  <p n="7">7. And for promoting the ſame it is further propoſed,
That a ſutable Fund of Money be raiſed and ſet apart for
ſuch Uſes and Purpoſes: And if the ſame ſhould fail, or
fall ſhort of what is intended, that then they may be ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plied
with ſuch Funds as ſhall be appropriated to pay Mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chant-Dealers
and Tradeſmen, who being under no Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pulſion
in making Agreement for their Commodities, are in
a Capacity to help themſelves.</p>
                  <p n="8">8. And if a Sufficiency of Money cannot be raiſed as
aforeſaid, that then it may be borrowed; and ſuppoſe at
<hi>10l. per Cent. per Annum,</hi> yet will be of ſo great Uſe in an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwering
theſe Ends, that its preſumed their Majeſties will
thereby ſave <hi>200000l. per Annum,</hi> or more: but if the late
ingenious Propoſals to ſupply their Majeſties with Money at
<hi>3l. per Cent. per Annum,</hi> be put into practice, the Advan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tages
accruing to their Majeſties by this propoſed Method
will be much greater, and the Doubts and Objections that
may ariſe touching the Inſufficiency of making ſuch orderly
Payments as aforeſaid, will be removed.</p>
                  <p n="9">9. Thus by preferring Frugality, and aboliſhing Extrava<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gancy,
their Majeſties, with the uſual Funds generally raiſed
and allowed for ſuch Occaſions, will ſoon be in a Capacity
of paying and providing with ready Money all things uſeful
and neceſſary for carrying on the War; and the Enemy ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king
notice of our Induſtry and Abilities, the uſual Fore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>runners
of great Actions, will be thereby diſcouraged, as
they are certain Preſages of their approaching Downfal.</p>
                  <p n="10">10. And that by ſuch Means the general Trade of the
Nation will be better ſupplied at home, and ſecured abroad;
and the Subjects thereby inabled and encouraged to give
<pb n="23" facs="tcp:63333:12"/>
Supplies to carry on the War, and their Majeſties thereby
be the better ſupported to proſecute and continue the ſame.</p>
                  <p n="11">11. Thus having, as I humbly conceive, propoſed a ſure
and certain Method to prevent thoſe Evils occaſioned by
the Sea-preſs, which (if put in practice) I dare affirm, will
be a uſeful Inſtrument to vanquiſh and overcome all our
Enemies both Foreign and Domeſtick; it being obſerva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble,
that ſince my former Propoſals made for performing of
Shipwrights Work, the impreſſing of Workmen for that
Service hath been little practiſed.</p>
               </div>
               <div type="queries">
                  <p>In all that hath been moſt humbly offered I have ſtudied
Brevity more than Curioſity, my Deſign being to ſerve my
Country rather than to ſhew my Skill in Learning; and
therefore do preſent the ſame, not as the Labour of my
ſpare Minutes, but as the Fruit of a labourious Brain, that
hath and will be always ready to ſerve their Majeſties and
the Government upon all Occaſions. I ſhall only offer
theſe following Queries, moſt humbly praying they may
be conſidered.</p>
                  <p n="1">1. Whether the Nation under the preſent Circumſtances
of a War, can long continue a ſutable Supply of Money to
carry on the ſame, under the pernicious Effects of Extrava<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gancy?</p>
                  <p n="2">2. Whether Money raiſed in Parliament with Care, col<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lected
with Trouble, and paid with Tears, requires not the
moſt ſerious Thoughts and Endeavours of all its Diſpoſers,
for converting the ſame, in all Circumſtances, to the moſt
uſeful and advantagious Purpoſes?</p>
                  <p n="3">3. Whether the King expoſing his Royal Perſon in ſo
many Dangers abroad, for promoting the Happineſs and
Well-being of the Nation, doth not expect the due Aſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtance
of all other his Officers and Subjects, indiſpenſibly
to uſe their utmoſt Endeavours for the full accompliſhing
his Royal Purpoſes?</p>
                  <p n="4">
                     <pb n="24" facs="tcp:63333:13"/>
4. Whether the ſaving thoſe immenſe Sums of Money, as
aforeſaid, will not ſettle the Minds of their Majeſties good
Subjects, and ſtop the Mouths of the moſt diſloyal and
reſtleſs Spirits, who raiſe Animoſities amongſt us, and inſtil
wicked Notions into the Minds of their Majeſties Subjects,
repreſenting the Government as under an unſettled Condi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion,
and groaning under Oppreſſion, by reaſon of great
Taxes, and a lingring and expenſive War, and a want of
Trade, and raiſing their Expectations of a ſpeedy Change,
who finding their Hopes defeated by an unanimous Reſolu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
of rooting out the Evils occaſioning the ſame, can have
no future Pretence to ſuch calumniating Reflections on the
Government for bringing to paſs their evil Purpoſes?</p>
                  <p n="5">5. Whether the buying and ſelling of publick Places be
not an undoubted Inlet to bring their Majeſties Enemies
into ſuch Stations, being of dangerous Conſequence to the
Government?</p>
                  <p n="6">6. Whether it will not be for their Majeſties and the Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion's
Intereſt to advance Perſons to Places of Truſt accord<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
to their Merits, and not permit thoſe to be diſcounte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nanced,
and to labour under Difficulties, who expoſe Frauds
and Extravagancies, and propoſe proper Remedies for the
Cure of thoſe Evils? and whether the brow-beating and
diſcouraging thoſe who endeavour to make ſuch Diſcove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries,
is not an effectual Means to prevent all others from ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pearing
in ſuch like Caſes? Much more might be added,
which for Brevity ſake is omitted. I ſhall humbly conclude
with the following Admonition of King <hi>Henry</hi> the <hi>IVth,</hi> who
upon his Death-bed ſpake to his Son as followeth; <q>So long
as Engliſh-men have Wealth, ſo long ſhalt thou have Obe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dience
from them; but when they are poor, they are
then ready for Commotions and Rebellions:</q> from which,
and all other Evils, good Lord deliver us both now and
for evermore.</p>
