            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

               <seg rend="decorInit">A</seg>S it is the Duty, ſo it hath been the conſtant practiſe of the People of God in all ages, not onely to take ſpecial notice of the Providential diſpenſations of God towards them, whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther they concerned them as a Nation, or as particular perſons, but alſo to meet the Lord in the way, both of his Iudgements, and of his Mercies, in a ſolemn maner, ſuitable to ſuch Diſpenſations, to which the Lord hath been pleaſed to give ſuch viſible teſtimonies of his gracious acceptance, as hath been and ſtill is a great encouragement to his people to make their addreſſes to him under the like providences. And as no Nation under heaven hath been exerciſed with more various and wonderful Providences then theſe Nations of <hi>England, Scotland</hi> and <hi>Ireland,</hi> ſo none have had more eminent experiences of the goodneſs of the Lord in the ſpeedy and merci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful returns he hath made to the prayers of his people; And therefore of all others, it becomes them to let no Providence of God go unobſerved or unregarded, eſpecially ſuch as ſeem to carry upon them Characters of the diſpleaſure of that God, from whom alone We have profeſſed to all the world, We have received all Our mercies paſt, and that We depend on him alone for greater things, which are yet in his peoples expecta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion. Vpon theſe grounds, His Highneſs the Lord Protector and the Council, ſadly reflecting on the late diſpenſation of Divine Providence, in removing from Vs His Highneſs the late Lord Protector, whom the Lord hath uſed as a choice Inſtrument for carrying on his Work, and under him to be both a Sun and a Shield unto thoſe that fear the Lord abroad and at home (which they cannot but be deeply ſenſible of as a ſore ſtroak of his mighty hand) as alſo in the general viſitation of Sickneſs and great Mortality, which is now upon many parts of this Nation, hold it their duty to invite the people of theſe Nations to humble themſelves greatly under the mighty hand of God, in the ſence of the many great and crying ſins of this Nation, which have deſerved his ſore diſpleaſure, and to accept the puniſhment of their ſins. And likewiſe to ſeek the Lord for a bleſſing upon His Highneſs and his Government and Counſels for the good of theſe Nations, that thereby the breach which he hath made upon Vs may be healed, and the preſent tokens of his diſpleaſure removed, and that he will be pleaſed yet to continue his gracious preſence among Vs, and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>light in Vs as his people, that his own Work may by his aſſiſtance be carried on, and peace and truth may be eſtabliſhed in the midſt of Vs. For which purpoſe His Highneſs the Lord Protector, with the advice of his Privy Council, hath thought fit to ſet apart <hi>Wedneſday</hi> the Thirteenth day of <hi>October</hi> One thouſand ſix hun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dred fifty and eight, to be obſerved as a day of Solemn Faſting and Humiliation in all places within <hi>Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land</hi> and <hi>Wales,</hi> and the Town of <hi>Berwick</hi> upon <hi>Tweed,</hi> earneſtly exhorting all the people of God in this Nati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on to cry mightily unto the Lord, and to wreſtle with him by prayer and ſupplication for the ends aforeſaid. And that the Miniſters of the ſeveral Churches and Congregations, do diligently and conſcientiouſly at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tend their duties on that day, as is ſuitable unto ſo ſolemn a work, and that they give notice hereof on the Lords day next before the ſaid Thirteenth day of <hi>October</hi> in their Publique Meeting-place, and read this Declaration on the ſaid day. And His Highneſs doth hereby prohibit all Fairs, Markets, and all bodily la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bour in the works of mens callings, which may interrupt or hinder the Religious obſervation of the day aforeſaid.</p>
