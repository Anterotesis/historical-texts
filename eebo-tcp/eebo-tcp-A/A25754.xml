         <editorialDecl>
            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

                     <p>TO preſerve health when preſent and to Reſtore if loſt is the chief end of Phiſick and ſhall be my Main deſign in this ſmall tract. The word <hi>Medicina</hi> being derived <hi>amedendo</hi> that is healing ſuch as are ſick doth properly belong to the Therapu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticall part only, which part being moſt neceſſary was firſt invented yet afterwards when that part was added which ſhews the preſervation of preſent health the ſame de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nomination was ſtill retained and is now
<pb n="2" facs="tcp:44488:6"/>
given to the whole art of Phiſick, therefore for definition Phiſick is an art of preſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving mans health when preſent and reſtore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing it when loſt as far as it is poſible.</p>
                     <p>The ſubject of Phiſick is mans body as it is obnoxious to diſeaſes, the ſcope or end of Phiſick is to heal —although it is im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſſible to cure all that are ſick; yet the Phyſitian hath performed his office if he hath omitted none of thoſe things that are in the power of nature and art.</p>
                     <p>Health amongſt all things called good by Mortals is moſt deſired when ſick, there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore ought to be highly prized, when in well being, and <hi>I</hi> think it may not only be acceptable, but very profitable to all, to be ſincerely and briefly informed how to keep health and cure themſelves; Eſpecially for thoſe that have not patience to read volumi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nous Authours, and thoſe that want time and means for due Regulation and Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernment; although we have an old Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verb, that every Man is a Fool, or a Phy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſitian at forty year old. Which ſaying is very true, my meaning is, that every Man in prudence ſhould ſo far be his own Doctor as rightly to know his own Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtitution and Complection, and the reaſons
<pb n="3" facs="tcp:44488:6"/>
for the Friendly agreement or the Antipa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thy of any Food to his own body, and for this end he ought to know the Nature of all Meat and Drink in uſe as ordinary Food (amongſt us in <hi>England</hi> eſpecially.)</p>
                     <p>The aforeſaid knowledge is the Hygenial part of Phyſick, that is Rules how preſent health may be preſerved, and how to be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ware not to fall into a Diſeaſe, not that I think it neceſſary that every particular Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon ſhould be able to read an Anotomy Lecture upon the parts of his own Body, nor ſtudy the Nature, differences, cauſes of Diſeaſes, nor the various ſorts, nor quali<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties of Purgative Medicines, but that Man is to be pittied that eats for hunger and knows not the Nature of what he Eats, which negligence in ſo neceſſary a know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge hath occaſioned much Sickneſs to many, and Death not to few. For pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venting of ſuch dangers, you ſhall now re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive brief Rules how to know your own Conſtitution and Complection, and alſo the Nature and Faculty of all the Meat, Drink, or ſorts of Food, now uſed in this Kingdom. To the end that every Man may be his own Doctor, ſo far as to know as well by reaſon as experience, that this doth

agree with my Conſtitution, and why that doth not.</p>

                     <p>AIr is the moſt worthy Element for the preſervation of Life in every crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, nay the other Elements ſubſiſt by it, as for example fire is extinguiſhed if you keep Air from it, and water putrifies and ſtinks if Air comes not to it: and the very Earth brings forth nothing to maturity, without it.</p>
                     <p>Therefore we may well give precedency to its worth in diſcourſe. The Air affects our bodies two wayes, <hi>viz.</hi> Extrinſecally as it inſinuates through the pores of the skin and as it is attracted by inſpiration, ſo it hath a force upon our bodies and impreſſeth its quality whether good or bad upon us, according to all writers.</p>

                  <p>What <hi>I</hi> have writ is only to ſhew that experienced Phyſick is moſt profitable though ſome Doctors will direct things they have read or heard a good and excel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lent report of, and ſo add things as they judge of alike quality according to that Maxime, <hi>vis vnita fortior,</hi> and ſo confound the Medicine with their mixture, and quite ſpoil the operation of its genuine effication, ſo that Phyſick is beſt which is grounded upon Obſervation of ſucceſsful experi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments, not that I diſſwade or ſpeak againſt the Theorick of Phyſick, nor the true me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thod of the Learned, provided they give the upper hand to ſucceſsful experiments, for Nature in the cure of any Diſeaſes, is not tyed to any of our preſcribed method, not but conſideration is to be had to diffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring cauſes and perſons.</p>

I have ſet down certain and ſafe ways of Government, with directions in taking that Phyſick, is moſt ſuitable in each Diſeaſe, which I have here preſcribed being certain and ſafe, all performed by a few Medi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cines as you will find, and for the certainty of their goodneſs, <hi>I</hi> will not entruſt any to prepare them, nor the delivery of them from my own houſe, and there only deli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vered, for the beſt Medicine, not well and truly prepared, may make a failing in cure. So wiſhing preſervation of health to the ſound, and recovery of health to the ſick, to the Poor <hi>I</hi> ſhall be willing to give advice freely, and to all that are in any doubt I ſhall readily reſolve them. For often<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times where the Diſeaſe is great, dangerous, or a complication of Diſeaſes, it is neceſſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry to conſult with your Doctor, where no preſcribed rule can in all circumſtances, be adaequate without the ſight of the pati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ent in all occaſions I ſhall willingly reſolve any doubts or Fears and ſhall manifeſt my ſelf thy Faithful Friend.</p>

                  <p>Generally the ſymptomes are lazineſs or wearyneſs without cauſe, eſpecially in the Calves of the Leg and Thighs, pain, ſpots, putrifaction of the Gums, blackneſs and looſeneſs of the Teeth, for the Cure after purging with one doſe of our <hi>Morbus</hi> Pill, with 3, 4 or 5, as the Patient is ſtrong or weak, let them drink Morning and Eve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning half a pint of our excellent dyet drink, and ſtir much after it every morn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing and every night, endeavour to ſweat with ſome in bed after 2 days from taking your purging <hi>Morbus</hi> pills, take every

                     <p>Be it to Men, Women, or Maids, the cure is very ſafe and ſpeedy, firſt vomit with 2 or 3 of my emetick pills, drinking poſſet drink as they work, then ſweat at night and morning with our cordial dyet drink hot half a pint at a time, the next morning after your Sweat, take 3 of our corroborating pills, ſtir much after the ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king of them, and half an hour after taking them, drink a large draught of ſmall Ale, or poſſet drink, Maids ought to take the pills for 3 weeks time, for the Green Sick<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs.</p>
                     <p>If Maids take them for the Green Sick<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs, let them drink White-wine and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinue taking the pills as directed for 20 days though you may be cured before, 'tis not ſafe to leave dregs behind, and walk much every day after your pills, and the Cure will ſpeedily be effected, though it be black Jaundies, yellow, or Green Sickneſs, or any other obſtructions in Liver, Spleen, or Reins, in Men, Women, or Children,
<pb n="148" facs="tcp:44488:80"/>
and doth ſtrengthen the noble parts and Reins to admiration.</p>
                     <p>For your dyet in the Jaundies, it ought to be tender, cooling, and opening, eaſie of concoction, as Barley, Grewel, Freſh Fiſh, Poultrey, Rabbets, and drink freely of ſmall Ale or Barley broath, with Liquo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riſh boyled in it. But Maids in the Green Sickneſs ought to uſe hot drinks that are opening as our dyet drink is, alſo White-wine, ſpiced meats, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> becauſe their Diſeaſe of Obſtruction riſeth from a cold cauſe, therefore they muſt avoid all ſtop<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ping cold things, as Milk, Cheeſe, Fruit, Nuts and ſuch like.</p>
                     <p>One thing I ſhall ſay for the comfort of all perſons that have loſt their Complecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, that the corroborating pills, being ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken every morning for ten days or longer, doth wonderfully revive, and clear the countenance, and make a freſh colour though in aged people, and if Ladies once try them they need never paint more, beſides it makes the body ſound and ſtrong.</p>
