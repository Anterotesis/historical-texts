            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

               <p>Among which Diuine Inuentions and helps,<note place="margin">The bene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fit of a Religious state.</note> a <hi>Religious State</hi> is worthily to be reckoned, yea it is the chiefest and the greatest of them al: and the benefit and spiritual com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>modities thereof are euerie way so rare and excellent, that, without al doubt, among al the heauenlie addresses, and remedies, and rules of wel liuing, which before I mentioned, nothing can be, I doe not say of greater, but of equal esteeme and value with this. For it doth not direct vs in one thing alone, at one time, or in one busines and exercise, as do most of other spiritual graces and guifts; but it stretcheth itself to our whole life, and embraceth euerie part and parcel thereof, leading vs by the hand, to the performance of al perfect

But the verie trade of life, which the Reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gious do professe, doth put them in a way of gayning them in a more assured, more plenti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful, and more permanent manner. For it ministreth frequent and daylie occasion of the exer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cise of al vertue; and, by continual practise, it engrafteth by little and little good habits in the mind, and good customes in our outward actions; In brief, it teacheth no other thing, then to bend al our care, thoughts, and desires, towards the seruice and feare of God, and the obtayning of a most inward coniunction with that infinit Sanc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>titie.</p>
               <p>But besides the vertues, which as I sayd, may be practised by al, there be others, so proper to a Religious State, that they are not to be found in anie other Course; such is the <hi>Pouertie</hi> and absolute <hi>Renunciation of al things,</hi>

These men therefore, as I sayd, are al to be rowsed vp so much as we may, and encouraged to hold their eyes open vpon the great benefit, which they haue receaued; that beholding it, they may frame their life and behauiour sutable to the great worck therof.</p>

For the reuenues of Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nasteries are the treasures of our Sauiour, and the deuout offerings of the almes of the faithfull, which cannot be taken away by pillage, nor wasted with rust, nor consumed by moaths: these treasures are common to all that liue in common, and are not distributed, after euerie ones fancy, but as necessitie requireth. The rich man hath not more because he was rich, nor the greate man more, by reason of his former state, but euerie one receaueth what is conuenient for him, which is a worke diuine, a greate commendation of grace, a deed of charitie, and agreable to nature. The body of man doth take nourishment of meate, which is diuided into euery member, without debate or contention, as nature it self doth think fitting. This kind of voluntarie Pouertie, doth free the mind from worldly cares, &amp; make it more apt to know it self, and to dwel at home, prepared for prayer, ioyful in sparing, cheerful in imparting to others, secure from danger, and wel disposed for increase of al manner vertue. And this it doth so much the rather, because it doth acquit the possessour therof from the world, it doth seuer him from the turmoiles of secular busines, and burie him in the tombe of holy Religion. There it easeth him of the heat of carnal desires, it preserueth him from the boisterous stormes of temptation, from the allurements of al sensual pleasures, from the noyse of the world, from the snares of the diuel, and from falling into many most enormous synnes; no man cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainly can declare, with what gladnes that man is replenished, what peace he in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ioyeth, what spiritual daynties he feeds on, with how many diuine illustrations he is inlightned, who vpon good aduice, and inspired from heauen, doth willingly renownce the world, betake himself to a Cloistre, and serue God; ayming at no earthly thing, possessing nothing that is temporal, and reseruing nothing at al to himself,<note place="margin">Prerogat<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

Certainly God, when he made vs in the beginning, would haue vs such; and for this end he created vs. And doutlesse whosoeuer do liue after this manner, do restore that ancient hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pinesse to the former lustre, couering the fault of our first father. For if the vnion of our Nature had not been dissolved by sinne, there had been no debate, nor disa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>greement, nor warre among men.<note place="margin">It is an imi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation of our Sauiour and his dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciples.</note> These are the true followers of our Sauiour, and do truly expresse the life which he led among vs. For as he when he had assembled the number of his disciples, had al things in common, and made himself common and familiar vnto them: so they (if they obserue iustly the rules of their Institute) obeying their superiour, do imitate the manner of liuing of Christ and his Apostles. And preseruing peace &amp; quiet of mind; they resemble the life of Angels.<note place="margin">And of the Angels.</note> For among the Angels there is no strife, no contention, no debate, but euery one in particular inioyeth al things which the rest haue, and haue notwithstanding their owne riches wholy to themselues. For the riches of the Angels are not such as can be bounded with limit, or being deuided among many, must necessarily fal lesse to euery ones share; but their riches are spiritual, and consist in the mind; and therfore al are equally inriched with the goods, which euery one hath whole and intire to himselfe; because al do possesse them with out grudge, or contradiction. For the Contem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plation of the soueraigne Good, and the assured Comprehention of al vertue, is the Angels treasure, and is of that nature that though euery one haue perfect possession therof to himself, al of them may neuerthelesse perfectly inioy it.

The later signification, expressing a tye, or obligation to some particular works of Charitie, is proper and peculiar to certaine people, obliged to some certaine actions of vertue belonging to the Contemplatiue, or to the Actiue life. And looke how many seuerall kinds there be of these <hi>vertuous</hi> works, so many seueral Religions there may be erected for the performance of them. Thus sayth <hi>S. Thomas</hi> in that place. But you wil better conceaue his meaning, if first you vnderstand, that the word (<hi>Religion</hi>) signifieth two things. Sometimes it is taken for one particular kind of vertue,<note place="margin">The word Religion signifieth two things.</note> which wee cal Religion, and is a bra<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ch of <hi>Iustice</hi>: sometimes it is taken, for a state of life, grounded in this vertue.</q>
Wher<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore if we once know the nature, and qualitie of the vertue it self, we shal the easier come to vnderstand what the <hi>state of Religion is.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="2">2. It is therfore a general doctrine among Diuines,<note place="margin">The office of Religio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> as it is a particular vertue.</note> that the peculier office of <hi>Religion,</hi> as a particular vertue, <hi>is to worship God duly, and as his infinite Maie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stie doth deserue, in regard of his Excellencie and preheminency aboue all things and for the great benefits which we haue receaued and dayly receaue at his hands.</hi> Which worship being partly inward in the mind, and partly consisting of outward duties, as Ceremonies, Rites, Sacrifices and the like. The vertue of Religion com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prehends them both, and performeth both the inward and the outward Actions. And they that imploy themselues in these kinds of seruices towards God, &amp; bestow themselues wholy in them, are called <hi>Religious.</hi> But to the <hi>End</hi> that a Man may be sayd to be in a <hi>Religious Estate,</hi> it is moreouer necessarie, that he giue himself so wholy to the workes of diuine worship, that he rid himself of al things that may hinder him in the performance of them. For as <hi>S. Thomas</hi> sayth wel in the same place, as in
<pb n="14" facs="tcp:15193:13"/>
                  <hi>baptisme</hi> we die to sinne, so by taking vpon vs a <hi>Religious state,</hi> we die moreouer to the world, as much as concerneth that particular worke which euery one doth pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fesse. And as the life of the soule is taken from it by sinne; so the seruice of God is hindred by worldly businesse. Which the Apostle doth giue to vnderstand, when he sayth:<note place="margin">2. <hi>Tim.</hi> 2.4.</note> 
                  <hi>No man being a souldiar to God, intangleth himself in secular businesse.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="3">3. Now if we rightly consider, three things especially in this world, hinder vs in the seruice of God.<note place="margin">Three things hinder vs in the ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uice of God.</note> 
                  <hi>Riches; Bodily pleasures</hi>; (not only those which are vnlawful, and forbidden by the Commaundements of God, for they are sinfull) but those pleasures also which are bounded with wedlock: and lastly our <hi>Owne Wil</hi>; which (if we giue it the reyns) growe's vnruly and carrie's vs to al ambitious pretences of superioritie and commaund. Wherfore they that wil truly and wholy dedicate themselues to God, must barre themselues of these three things: to wit, of <hi>Riches,</hi> by <hi>Pouertie</hi>; of <hi>Wedlock,</hi> by <hi>Chastitie</hi>; and curbe the vnrulynesse of their <hi>wil,</hi> by <hi>Obe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dience.</hi> And thus we come to haue the description of <hi>Religion,</hi> which we sought for al this while. For, <hi>Religion is a state,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">What Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion is as it is a State.</note> 
                  <hi>which endeauoureth to Christian perfection, by the three vowes of Pouertie, Chastitie, and Obedience.</hi> The Christian perfection of which heere we speake, without al doubt consisteth in the loue of God, casting aside the loue of our selues, and of all Creatures. It is sayd therfore that this <hi>state endeauoureth</hi> to this perfection,<note place="margin">It endea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uoureth to perfection.</note> and not, that it hath already got it, or that it is alrea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy perfect; because it is not required that a Religious man should be already per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect, or haue attained absolute perfection; neither doth he make profession of that: but he satisfieth his obligation, if he aspire and endeauour to it. Finally it is called a <hi>State,</hi> because it is necessarie, that this kind of life be constant, firme, perpetuall, immoueable.<note place="margin">And is a state.</note> For it is one thing to be <hi>pe<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

But if a man giue himself wholy ouer for euer, and bind himself vnto another; this al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter's his estate; because of a freeman, he mak's himself a bond-man: so the workes of pietie and Religion of themselues, do not make a Religious man; but it is more<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ouer required,<note place="margin">Two things put a man in Relig. estate Vo<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="2 letters">

low of much greater force therfore must all spirituall profit be, which as I sayd, is the only true and solid profit, not short and temporall, but eternal; yet not with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>standing to make it more certaine, and cleere we must establish one thing, as the ground-worke, not only of this present discourse, but of all Christian perfection; to wit,<note place="margin">All men by nature are bound to serue God.</note> that all men are bred, and borne by nature vassals, and seruants of our greate God, and as such, must in all things, greate and litle, obserue his will, and be wholy at his Command.

Vpon which passa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ge <hi>S.

And a litle beneath. Therfore if we wil not be like the colt of a wild Asse, we must first of al search out the signes of that which is secretly appointed by God, that what soeuer we haue a mind vnto, we keepe our selues vnder the collar of supernall gouernment; &amp; fulfill our desires so much the more profitably for to liue, by how much we tread downe the desires of this life, against our owne inclination. This seruitude and bondage of man, which is so naturall and so profitable, <hi>S. Augustin</hi> did well vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derstand; and doth learnedly expresse it, shewing that this was the very cause why God did lay a command vpon our first Fathers in Paradise, and such a command as we read he did: to wit, to put in vre his iust and lawfull authoritie ouer him &amp; ouer vs all who were then contayned in his loynes.<note place="margin">

And if God should promise vs this only which I haue now sayd, and which I haue expressed
<pb n="24" facs="tcp:15193:18" rendition="simple:additions"/>
in such words as I am able, what would we not giue for it, if it were to be sold? What would we not giue, that it were to be bought? Would it be enough to giue all that thou hast, if thou hadst the world in possession? Yet it is put to sale; buy it if thou wilt, trouble not thy self ouer much to find some greate matter to giue for it, in regard of that at which it is valued; it is valued at what thou hast; be not sollicitous what thou hast, but what thou arte. The thing is worth as much as thou art; giue thy self and thou shalt haue it. But thou wilt say, I am naught, he will not take me. By giuing thy self to him, thou becomest good: This is to be good, to put thy self vpon his assurance and promise:</q> Thus farre <hi>S. Augustine.</hi>

                     <hi>Ps</hi> 21.31.</note> 
                  <hi>And my sowle shal liue to him.</hi> For euery man must make this account, and throughly perswade himself, that he is not his owne, but Gods; and whatsoeuer he hath, whatsoeuer he is worth, what<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>soeuer he is; he is not to serue himselfe with it, and his owne ends, but to serue God alone, with continual relation vnto him. And must be content alwayes to be at his command; and be glad of it. And with all the forces and inclinations of his mind and wil, continualy labour that his thoughts, actions, endeauours, and himself wholy, be conformable to the wil and pleasure of almighty God. Finally he must alwayes beare in mind, and expresse in behauiour that which the holy Prophet conceaued when he sayd, <hi>I am made like a labouring beast before thee,</hi>

Secondly because this very thing, to wit, that we belong to God, and are written as it were in the Inuentorie of his personall estate, doth bring vs profit without measure, and furnisheth our soules with all kind of commodities.

It is better also for al other liuing creatures, and beasts, to be subiect to man, then otherwise, because by him they are preserued, and haue sustenance and breeding from him.

And hauing now found out how fully this obliga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion is discharged by a Religious course of life, let vs consider in a worldly course, how farre it is from being fulfilled. That reflecting vpon the miserable and dangerous state of a secular life, we may better vnderstand the happines of Religion. For a man that hath been in the goale, shut vp closse prisonner, the more miserie he hath indured, doth value the benefit of his deliuerie at a truer rate; so though there be very many things in Religion, which do highly commend it, yet the wretched calamities of this world being wel considered, from which Religion doth free vs, wil make it the more desired. And these calamities and miseries be not hard to be discouered; they are no hidden and secret thing, but palpable, and open to the eye of euerie one that hath any eyes to see with.

                  <note place="margin">The world a steepe and slippe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rie place.</note>2. Let vs therefore frame somewhat to our Imagination, a place very steepe and slipperie, where a man that is strong, and able, can hardly hold his feete. And in this place, one that is euen eaten-out with long and greeuous sicknes, and wholy decayed, and round about him, not one, but very many strong, and able men pressing vpon him to make him fall: such an one therefore, standing in such a place, how is it possible he should saue himself? This steepe and slippery place is the world; al men, are those that be so sick and feeble, the diuels, beare vs this great malice, and are thus diligent to worke vs mischief. The world without doubt is steepe and slipperie, and there is nothing more hard in it, then to keepe our selues from falling, and from falling so dangerously, that if once our foo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting begin to fayle, we can hardly recouer our selues, but shal runne downe headlong, and bruise ourselues vpon al the Rocks of vices. The steepnes and slip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perines of this world, be the occasions which are in it, and allurements to sinne, which are not to be reckoned. Yet if we wil summe them vp in briefe, they may be drawne to these three heads. First the corrupt &amp; wicked lawes wh<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

The lawes of Christ are these. <hi>Blessed be the poore: Blessed be those that mourne, if one stricke thee on the one cheeke, turne him the other; our wil is to be denied; our Crosse taken vp</hi>; and many such like. Now what be the decrees, and Axiomes of the world? They are not farre to seeke? Nothing is more miserable, and more base then Pouertie, nothing happier then to be Rich.

And he that fals of his owne accord, what wil he do when he is thrust along? For as in corporall things fire, is bred by fire and euery thing is ingendred by another like vnto it: so in our soules, pride breeds pride, and anger breeds anger, and euery vice is apt to breed the like vice in an others mind, euen though the partie know not, or think not of it; often<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times also though he striue against it: for stealing into our mind by our cares and eyes by litle and litle, they cleaue so fast, that they cannot choose but make some impression in it, and alter it for the worse.

                  <q>Ambition is a subtil euil, a hidden poyson, a secret plague, à contriuer of deceit, the mother of Hy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pocrisie, the breeder of enuie, the of-spring of al vice, the fewel of wickednes, the rust of vertue, the moath of sanctitie, the blinder of mens harts, turning remedies into diseases, and breeding sicknes by the helps of physick.</q> Manie things we may reade in <hi>S.

And among other things he sayth in his Morals wondrous wel:<note place="margin">S. <hi>Greg.</hi> 34. <hi>mor. c.</hi> 18.</note> That other vices make warre vpon those vertues only, by which themselues are destroyed, as Anger opposeth itself against Patience, Gluttonie against Abstinence, Lust against Continencie.
<q>But Pride, which we cal the roote of al vices, not satisfyed with the death of one vertue, bandeth it<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>self against al the parts of the Soule, and, as a general and contagious disease, infecteth the whole bodie. For as if a Tyrant should surprise a cittie which he hath besieged, so when Pride doth breake-in vpon the mind, the richer it finds a man, the more cruel it is against him. But besides the robbing of a man, and the depriuing him of al spiritual ornaments, and the defacing and razing of al vertue to the verie ground; it doth also bring with it al manner of euil and corruption;</q> which <hi>S.

Pride is the roote of al euil, and of it the holie Scripture doth testifye saying:
<q>
                     <hi>The beginning of al sinne is Pride</hi>; And the first brood that is hatched out of this poysoned root, are seauen principal vices, to wit, Vaine-glorie, Enuie, Wrath, Sadnes, Aua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rice, Gluttonie, Luxurie.</q>
Wherefore by al this which hath been hitherto sayd, we may discouer playnly the great miserie of this wicked and desperate world, and how wretched they are that liue continually amidst so manie euils, and serue vnder such a yoake and such a Prince; the Prince of this world being no other, according to our Sauiour's owne verdict, but he that is Prince of hel; and the world itself being al of it interlaced with so manie and so great mischiefs and corruptions as we haue mentioned.</p>

A wonderful great benefit therefore it is to them (and doubtlesse the greatest that can happen to man in this life) to whom God hath shewed how to fly from the wrath that is to follow, and sent his holie Angels from heauen to moue vs to take this flight, &amp; oftimes to vrge and compel vs, as they did <hi>Loth,</hi> when we hang-of and prolong the time.

This Mountain is the top of Euangelical Perfection, the difficulties whereof be so dreadful to manie men, that they choose rather to
<pb n="43" facs="tcp:15193:27"/>
walk the easie and spacious wayes of this world, then venter vpon this, which in their conceit is so hard and narrow; yet if they once begin to discouer in a clearer light, &amp; behold with open eyes the fowlenes of sinne, the ficklenes and miserie of this poasting world, &amp; the euerlasting flames &amp; torme<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ts, which are without mea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sure; presently they cast aside al delayes, &amp; make haste away to higher places, and nothing comes in their way so hard, which they do not willingly embrace to at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taine to eternal Happines, and escape the euils which haue no end.</p>
               <p n="3">3. And wheras in al combats or encounters of man with man, it is euer held a base and shameful thing to fly; because he that shrinketh from his aduersarie, &amp; betaketh himself to his heeles, doth acknowledge himself to be the weaker, and giues himself for vanquished, which among men is euer accounted a great dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>grace. In the conflict, which we haue with Vice, it is quite contrarie. For to fly,<note place="margin">To flye, is to ouer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come.</note> is to ouercome; not only because we put ourselues in safetie by keeping aloof from the Enemie, but because we discomfit and ouerthrow him by our verie flight. For euerie vice hath some subiect, which is as the bayte or fewel of it; which bayte he that doth eschew, must needs vanquish his enemies. For he doth not only treade vnder foot the thing itself, which he doth contemne, but goeth away with a farre greater victorie ouer himself and his owne crooked inclinatio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, and is so farre from shewing anie basenes or cowardise in this manner of flight, or any one jot of feare,<note place="margin">S <hi>Ambr de fuga sec. c</hi> 4.</note> or want of courage, as that rather he giues euident testimonie of his reso<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lution and stoutnes, because it is a work of great courage and strength to fly; as <hi>S.

<q>Let vs not be ashamed to fly; for it is a glorious flight, to fly from the face of sinne. And as for the dangers which concerne our bodie and life, in euerie man's iudgement it is wisdome to prouide betimes for our owne safetie, and to fore-think the dangers which may happen, and deliuer our<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selues from al peril before-hand, if we can.</q>
Why therfore should we not think &amp; do the self-same thing in the hazards which touch vpon our soules, and do it so much the more effectually, in regard that the calamities, which they threaten, are not only farre greater, but eternal? For certainly the man were both mad &amp; blind, and a stranger to his owne nature, and the state of things, that should hope neuer to be ouercome in so many battails, and neuer to be hurt amidst so manie snares and ginnes;<note place="margin">

Thus farre S. <hi>Bernard.</hi> Wherefore certainly a Religious state can neuer be sufficient<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly loued or praysed, in regard it bringeth vs out of the dangerous seas of this world, to a quiet hauen, and disarmeth the Diuel of the three weapons, with which he assaulteth euerie bodie. It entrencheth vs within a triple defence and rampire, and blocketh-vp al the wayes, wherby the Enemie may haue anie hope of passage. For in what thing can this outragious Lion or Dragon hurt a Religious soule? He cannot hooke him in with desire of gold &amp; siluer, or lands &amp; possessions; nor catch him by vnlawful bargains, nor put him vpon anie other kind of vniust dealing; because he hath forsaken al his owne, that he might not couet that which belongeth to an other. He cannot moue him by beautie to in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>temperancie, because his mind is bound from it by the bonds of his Vow; and his eyes (which are the conduits of lust) and his whole body is fenced by the verie walles within which he liueth. Neither is there anie danger, that through ambi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion he wil flatter, or lye, or enuie, and vndermine others for preferment sake; because he hath cut from himself al these things, and is so farre from desiring to be aboue, that his whole contentment is placed in being vnder others.</p>
               <p n="6">6. This State therefore is euerie way safe, strongly fenced and impreg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nable, and guarded from the enemie on euery side, and consequently there can be no doubt made, but as (al things considered) the best meanes to attaine to Saluation is to forsake the world, so the world cannot be more

effectually and perfectly forsaken, then by betaking ourselues to Religious In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>closure; which whosoeuer shal vnderstand and sink into, what bands or chaynes wil be able to with-hold him from taking his flight into this Castle of Saluation, into this Fortification of Angels, into this Heauen vpon earth? For if a traueller should be certainly told, that there were a wood pestered with theeues lying vpon his way, he would do his best endeauour not to passe that way, &amp; be glad to choose anie other, though it were farther about, and more troublesome; Now since we know for certain, that this world is so ful of Diuels, and of their snares and ambushes; how is it possible there should be found a Soule, who had rather runne the hazard of eternal perdition amidst al these treacheries &amp; deceits, then walke the way of a Religious life? specially seing a Religious life is not so ful of difficulties, but much more pleasant and easie.</p>

Wherefore whosoeuer co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mes-in to wrastle (as certainly al must wrastle, and no man can auoyd it) if he wil not be throwne by the Diuel, he must lay aside al his apparrel, and enter naked into the lists.<note place="margin">

For at such a time euerie bodie doth willingly cast al things ouer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>board to saue the ship from danger; when the billowes swel so high, that they hang like hils ouer their heads, and threaten present death, those that are in the ship haue no thought of temporal goods; carnal delight comes not then in their mind; then they cast those things out of the ship, for which before they went on ship-board; and set al things at naught through the desire of liuing.

               <p n="4">4. Which kind of death and the necessitie thereof, was not hidden from our Philosophers, but much more exactly vnderstood by them, as appeareth by that which <hi>S. Gregorie</hi> hath left written in his Morals:<note place="margin">S <hi>Gregorie l.</hi> 5. <hi>mor. c.</hi> 5.</note>
                  <q>We liue yet to this world, while our mind is stil wandring abroad in it; but when being out<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wardly mortifyed, we conceale ourselues in the sepulcher of Contemplation, we are hidden in our graue as dead men; which though heerafter it shal be done more perfectly, yet in great measure it is now performed by them that with inward delight are drawne from the turmoils of temporal desires, and while their soules are wholy intent to the loue of God, they are not with any vnprofitable perturbation torne in pieces and distracted.</q>
In which place he hath much more to the same effect, and this one thing besides worth obser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uation, that in regard that Wisdome is not found in the out-side of things, but lyeth hidden in things inuisible, it cannot be apprehended, vnlesse we for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sake these visible things, and hide ourselues also in those that are not to be seene.</p>
               <p n="5">5. Wherefore finding it so solidly proued and so often repeated by the holie Fathers, that it is most profitable and most perfect to withdraw ourselues from al things created, and the more we withdraw ourselues, the more safe and perfect we shal be: we may easily conclude, that nothing can be more profitable then a Religious state, by which we compasse this thing most perfectly and most compleatly. For certainly there can be no greater renun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciation of al things then that, which is practised in Religion, where not only Pouertie is professed, but a man is so wholy bereft of the dominion and possession of euerie thing, that he cannot say, that this peece of land, or this house, or (as <hi>Cassian</hi> expresseth it) not so much as this garment,<note place="margin">

And it taketh away moreouer al other things, by which men are wont to bolster-vp their life, or solace their mind; as the vse of friends, the fauour of Princes, the alliance of wife and children, finally al earthlie things, and whatsoeuer is of anie esteeme or price in the world. Wherfore <hi>S. Bernard</hi> doth extol the greatnes of this benefit,<note place="margin">

<q>It is true, <hi>sayth he,</hi> the ascent to Hierusalem is steep and difficult, in regard it is cut strayte out from the verie top of the mountaine; but the compendious<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nes of the way doth temper, or rather wholy take away, the greatnes of the <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

It is not so with some others; it is not so with those, that loaded with carts and cart-loads, haue taken their course by the winding of
<pb n="51" facs="tcp:15193:32"/>
the hil; and vsually tumble downe headlong by the sides of the mountaine, so that they scarce find how to bring their life to an end.

Bernard</hi> wel considered is sufficient to perswade vs to preferre a Religious state, before al Princelie treasures and command.</q>
For what stupiditie can be greater, then, seing we must not only al of vs runne (as the Apostle teacheth) but (as <hi>S. Bernard</hi> sayth) we must runne vp-wards against the hil, which of itself is wonderful difficult, voluntarily to charge ourselues with diuers weights, and moreouer with continual care and sollicitude to encrease and multiplie those weights, which, if we did right, we should rather wholy cast-of from vs?</p>

And certain it is, though the duties of Marriage may be performed without offence to God, yet to cut-of al pleasure in this kind also is not only more beneficial, but an easier and a more readie way to saue our soules. Which truth is groun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded vpon the authoritie of S. <hi>Paul,</hi> who in his first Epistle to the Corinthians hauing rehearsed manie commodities of being chaste, sayth: <hi>It is good for a man to be so.</hi> Whervpon <hi>S.

The Seruitude of Marriage is described by him in these words: <hi>The woman hath not power ouer her owne bodie, but the man; in like manner also the man hath not power ouer his owne bodie, but the woman.</hi> This is no smal kind of seruitude, that the command of ones bodie should be in the power of an other;<note place="margin">S. <hi>Iohn Chrysost. de Virg c.</hi> 41.</note> which <hi>S.

Where moreouer he compareth man and wife to two fugitiue slaues, that are so coupled togeather, that though they runne from their maister, they must notwithstanding needs follow one an other, and cannot get asunder. Which S. <hi>Paul</hi> also doth insinuate in those words:<note place="margin">1. <hi>Cor.</hi> 7.</note>

And to shew that this bond cannot be bro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken, he presently addeth: <hi>Do not seeke to be loosened.</hi> But this seruitude (which of itself is very hard (specially being perpetual) is made much more hard and heauie, when the parties chance to light vpon a stearne and peeuish maister, as it doth often, or rather most commonly, fal out; or vpon a maister that hath but litle wit to gouerne, which is yet much more intollerable. The Holie-Ghost expresseth the miserie therof in the Prouerbs in these words: <hi>It is better to dwel in a land that is desert,</hi>

Wherefore me thinks, when our Sauiour abrogated the custome of diuorce, which for some time was permitted in the Old Law, the Apostles had great reason to say with common consent: <hi>If the case of man be thus with his wife, it is not expedient to marrie.</hi>

But there is one thing heauier then al the rest, which the Apostle doth point at, when he doth not barely cal it Tribulation, but <hi>Tribulation of the flesh</hi>; For when we take paynes for things that are spiritual, and for the sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uing of our soules, and the seruice of God, it bringeth great comfort with it, and hath a great reward prepared; but to toyle in earth, and in carnal busi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesses, if we ayme no higher, hath no comfortable sauour at al, nor hope of recompence. Wherefore <hi>S.

Behold, sayth he,<note place="margin">S. <hi>Iohn Chrysostom ia Ps.</hi> 44.</note> how the saying of the Apostle is heer made manifest;

But the mischief is, that the lustful desires, so long as they are sed in whatsoeuer manner, grow so violent, that most commonly they fal from things law<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful to that, which is not lawful; of which we cannot haue a more famous example then that which hath been shewed vs in king <hi>Dauid,</hi> and in his sonne king <hi>Salomon.</hi> The one of them being so holie a man, and the other so wise a man, and hauing each of them not one wife alone (as now adayes) but a multitude of wiues, their lust was notwithstanding so farre from being satisfyed, as it was rather greatly incensed and inflamed; so that at last it did most shamefully and most miserably foyle the wisdome of the one, and the sanctitie of the other; wheras on the other side, of <hi>Elias</hi> and <hi>Helizeus,</hi> who liued chaste, there is no such thing recorded; neither haue we anie reason at al to suspect anie such matter of them. To be brief, me thinks, that Secular people that are married, doe keepe this fierce and cruel beast (like a lion) in a cage, dayly feeding it, and consequently making it dayly

stronger and stronger. And who can be sure that it wil not at some time or other breake-out of the cage, and doe some great mischief according to the wonted custome and nature therof? Therefore those that liue chaste, take the better and the wiser course, not contented to hamper and tye it vp in chaynes and fetters, but they labour by famine, and by often blowes to take away the life of it, and to kil it.</p>

The excellencie of Obedience may be gathered out of holie Scripture, preferring it before Sacrifices and Holocausts, that is, before al good works what soeuer. For so <hi>Samuel</hi> from the mouth of God,
<pb n="64" facs="tcp:15193:39"/>
professeth,<note place="margin">1. <hi>Reg.</hi> 15.</note> saying: <hi>Obedience is better then Sacrifice; and to hearken, is better then to offer the far of rammes.</hi> Whervpon S. <hi>Gregorie</hi> discourseth thus:<note place="margin">S. <hi>Greg. mor.</hi> 35. <hi>c.</hi> 10.</note>
                  <q>Obedience is worthily preferred before Sacrifice, because in Sacrifices the flesh of an other thing, by Obedience our wil is killed. Euerie one therefore doth appease God so much the sooner, by how much in his sight curbing the pride of his owne free wil, he slayeth himself with the sword of his commandment.</q>
Wherby we may see how farre a Religious life doth surpasse, not only a secular life that is vitious and debaushed, but an honest and commendable life. For the best that can be sayd of a secular man, is that he giueth himself to good works; which is not to be compared with the perfect and intire oblation of ourselues by perpetual Obedience.<note place="margin">Obedience ennobleth the att<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="3 letters">

                     </gap>s which of themselues are but meane and ordinane.</note> And this excellencie of Obedience is that which makes it to be so meritorious as it is; for they that order the good which they do, according to their owne wil and pleasure, doe merit no more then the price and worth of the action itself can giue them; but Obedience addeth a great deale more; for it doth not only make those actions better which are good in themselues, but ennobleth those that otherwise of themselues are nothing worth; and maketh them exceeding grateful in the sight of God. For what is in itself more ordinarie and meane, then to eate and drink, to haue care of bodilie health, to walke for recreation sake, and such like natural or necessarie actions: which notwithstanding are highly esteemed of God, if they be performed vpon intent of doing that which we are bid to doe, by those that haue lawful command ouer vs. Wherefore they are in the right, who com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pare Obedience to a wand, that hath vertue to turne that which it toucheth, into gold, for such a wand would not only make siluer and such pretious mettals, more pretious then they are in themselues, but put an incompara<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble value vpon wood, stones, and verie earth, which of themselues are little or nothing worth.</p>

                     </gap>r ver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tues two wayes.</note> It planteth them two seueral wayes: First because the liberal offer of himself, which man makes to God, prouoketh God to be bountiful and liberal againe towards him; for God is of that disposition and goodnes, that he wil neuer suffer himself to be ouercome in bountie, and loue, and seruices done vnto him; and consequently whosoeuer shal giue himself and al that he hath, freely vnto him, shal be sure to receaue from him againe al spiritual graces, and finally God himself. Secondly it planteth other vertues in the mind, because in the practise of Obedience, we must necessarily practise them al, for when we subiect ourselues to an other man for God, we practise Humilitie in a high degree, putting ourselues vnder one, to whome in nature we are equal, and in other things perhaps better then he; we practise Patience, vndergoing things that are hard &amp; contrarie to our wil and inclina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion; we practise Fayth, reuerencing God, whom we see not, in man whom we doe behold, and acknowledging that the care &amp; prouidence of Almightie God doth watch ouer vs in him, we practise Hope, contemning things pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>s<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

<pb n="65" facs="tcp:15193:39"/>
we see that the exercise of al the rarest Vertues of Christian life is contayned in this one vertue of Obedience, and consequently that (as <hi>S. Gregorie</hi> teacheth) <hi>it doth plant al other vertues in the mind</hi>; and while it prospereth, al the rest doe prosper and encrease.<note place="margin">It also con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>serueth them.</note> It also conserueth them; which is an other benefit and glorie of this vertue; for al other vertues in a manner are subiect to be wron<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ged, and shaken, and stolen from vs by the Diuels; who lye like theeues in wayte for such pretious iewels; and the more they are worth, the more those hellish Fiends doe whet their teeth against them; yea the vertues themselues may in some sort be sayd to destroy themselues, not that there is anie fault in them, but through the pride and arrogance of those that possesse them; as it hapned to <hi>Lucifer,</hi>

But Obedience preserueth itself &amp; the other vertues, which it bringeth with it; because it trusteth not to itself, nor attributeth anie thing to itself, nor indeed reserueth anie thing for itself; but taking no thought of itself,<note place="margin">

                     </gap>.</note> it casts itself wholy into the <hi>hands</hi> of God, out of whose hands no bodie can take vs, as our Sauiour sayth. For either the Enemie dares not approach, or, if he attempt vpon vs, it doth now belong to God, in whose hands we are, to sight for vs, or to giue vs so much strength, that we shal easily withstand his furie. And so <hi>S. Gregorie</hi> sayth in another place:<note place="margin">
                     <hi>S. Gregorie in</hi> 4. <hi>reg. c.</hi> 4.</note> The exer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cises of those that doe obey, are Sacrifices; for while we are obedient to men for God, we ouercome the proude Spirit. With other vertues we fight against the Diuels; by Obedience we vanquish them. Wherefore they that are obe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dient, are conquerours; because while of their owne accord they subiect their wil to others, by Obedience they command ouer the Angels that are fallen. These are the fruits of Obedience alone; for so <hi>S. Gregorie</hi> speaketh: <hi>Obedience is the onlie vertue which planteth al other vertues in the mind.</hi> Whereby it appeareth, how great a good is wanting to al Secular people; and on the other side, how strayte, and solid, and short a way Religious people walke to Perfection, their life being nothing else but Obedience, and so finding meanes by the practise of one onlie Vertue, to compasse al the rest with great ease and expedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion.
Wherefore <hi>Climacus</hi> sayth,<note place="margin">
                     <hi>Climacus Grad.</hi> 4.</note>
                  <q> that Obedience is a perfect abnegation of our soule and bodie; a voluntarie death; a life voyde of care; a iourney by water without dammage; the burial of our wil, a life of humilitie; and as if a man should trauel sleeping; that to liue in Obedience, is to lay our burthen vpon an other's shoulders, to swimme vpon an other's arme, &amp; to be held-vp by the chin, that we sink not, but passe the huge gulf of this life without da<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ger, &amp; at a short cut. What could be spoken more pithily in commendation of this Vertue?</q>
But where he sayth, <hi>We trauel sleeping,</hi> me thinks is specially to be noted, and pondered, for the giueth vs to vndertand, that by Obedience we are carried like litle children in an other's armes, so that al the care &amp; trouble belongs to them that carrie vs; and where this spiritual iourney is toylesome &amp; laborious to some, and dangerous to others, and ful of hazard; Religious people haue so easie a time of it, by means of this Vertue, that they do not so much as feele their iourney.</p>
               <p n="3">3. There is an other commoditie of Obedience, in which we may truly say al other commodities are contayned; to wit, that it doth subiect vs, and al our

actions,<note place="margin">Obedience puts vs into the imme<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diate and certain di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rection of God.</note> to the wil &amp; pleasure of God so perfectly, that they are wholy depen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dant of him, and altogeather directed by him. But before we declare, how this is performed by Obedience, we wil shew the necessitie of it. And certainly there is no bodie but doth find within himself, that in the gouernment of our<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selues, and setling the course of our life, there hangs a great mist and obscu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritie before our eyes, which makes vs subiect to manie errours &amp; faults; wher<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of holie Scripture doth put vs in mind, saying: <hi>The thoughts of mortal wights are feareful,</hi>

                     <hi>Sap.</hi> 9.</note> 
                  <hi>and foresight vncertain.</hi> For what darknes can be greater, then where we haue no notice at al of things to come, and very little of those, which are present? and as for the minds and intentions of other men, with whom we must necessarily conuerse &amp; traffick, we are so farre from vnderstanding the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, that most commonly we know not what lurketh in our owne breast. Some<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times we think we can do more then indeed we are able to doe; sometimes that we cannot doe so much; the one thrusting vs vpon aduentures aboue our strength, the other discouraging vs in things that are good for vs, and necessarie to be vndertaken. It is therefore one of the greatest benefits that can befal vs, to haue some bodie in so great a night of darknes, to lead vs as blind men by the hand, and that we may as it were leane vpon their shoulders; much more to haue God for our leader, whose wisdome is so infinite, that nothing can be hidden from him nothing deceaue him, and his power and goodnes is so great that (as <hi>S. Augustin</hi> telleth vs) he hath as much care of euerie man in particular,<note place="margin">
                     <hi>S. August.</hi> 3. <hi>Cons.</hi> 11.</note> as if he had that one man only to care for.

                  <hi>Our Lord doth gouerne me, and nothing shal be wanting vnto me</hi>; For the one doth follow of the other; and while God doth gouerne vs, we shal not only want nothing, but he wil place vs in <hi>a place of pasture vpon the waters of true refection,</hi> that we may haue abundant plentie of euerie kind of thing.</p>

Now let vs see how God doth most truly and most certainly gouerne vs by Obedience; and to make it the more playne and euident, we wil search the ground of it to the verie roote. For though among the ancient Philosophers (as they stiled the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>selues) there were some so shamefully vnlearned, as to think that God hath care of no kind of thing without himself, or only of things eternal; yet Fayth and Nature doth conuince and compel vs to belieue and professe,<note place="margin">

The manner also which the Diuine wis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome doth hold in the gouernment of this world, is worthie to be obserued, &amp; is set downe by the Holie-Ghost in an other place of the same Booke in these words:<note place="margin">

                  <hi>He doth react from end to end strongly, and disposeth al things sweetly.</hi> Heer likewise his strength and power is declared, which nothing can withstand<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> as we sayd before nothing hinder his counsel and prouidence, nothing escape his hands. The sweetnes of his Prouidence,<note place="margin">The sweet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nes of the prouidence of God.</note> which is the chiefest part of Wis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome, consisteth in two things; first, in gouerning euerie thing as the nature of that thing doth require; things that are necessarie, necessarily; things con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tingent,
<pb n="67" facs="tcp:15193:40"/>
contingently; those that are free, so as their freedome be preserued; Secondly to gouerne them orderly in their due rank and proportion, the highest agreing with those that stand in the middle, the middlemost with those that are below, effects with their causes, precedents with those that are next and consequent, and that this order be neuer broken or confounded. Wherefore as we see that corne, and other fruits of the earth<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> do not suddenly put-forth al at once, and come to ful growth and ripenes, but first are smal and tender, &amp; by little &amp; little waxe ripe by the warmth of the Sunne; &amp; the Sunne itself, that it may not scorch and burne them vp, is tempered with ti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>melie showers, &amp; the showers which fal vpon the ground to moisten it, fal not suddenly from aboue, but grow of the vapours which are suckt-vp from the earth; and the like course is constantly obserued in al works of nature, euerie thing being produced by an other which is next it, and by some immediate cause; so it was fitting, the same order should be much more obserued in actio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>s that are voluntarie; they being of a higher strayne then the other. For first, it could not haue stood with reason, that the wils of al men should haue been, as it were, seuered and distracted asunder, euerie one taking a course by himself alone; for what could be more confused? But it was certainly best, that they should be lincked one with an other, and ordered dependent of one an other, to that end, which God in his infinit wisdome hath ordayned. Secondly it being fitting, that such an order should be established among the wils and intentions of men, it was also necessarie, that among them there should be that con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nexion, which is betwixt a cause, &amp; the effect therof, that is, that there should be some who moue others, and some againe that are moued by others

For the first and principal rule of al reasonable Wils, being the Wil of God, al other Wils are ordered vnder that Diuinie Wil, some neerer vnto it, &amp; some farther of, as it hath pleased him, who appointeth euerie thing his place, and as it were his turne and ward.</q>

For if God, through his diuine prouidence, do order euerie man in particular, and euerie thing that man doth, to some end by himself fore-thought on; much more doth he order the communitie of men to some end, because the communitie is more noble; as the whole is more noble then euerie part by itself, and hath a higher end. And further, it being necessarie that euerie communitie be gouer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned by some bodie, the gouernours likewise must necessarily be ruled by God, and directed to some end by him; which holie Scripture doth plainly teach vs,<note place="margin">

Wherefore hauing proued so many wayes, that God doth gouerne and direct euerie Religious man by those, whom he hath placed ouer them in lawful authoritie, the benefit which they reape, and their continual happi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nes, must needs be exceeding great, both in regard that in this mist of darknes, they haue fallen vpon so sure a guide, and met with such an excelle<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t maister, in the ignorance of supernatural and diuine things; and in their weaknes recea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ued so great a stay and defence. Insomuch that we may say with the Royal Prophet,<note place="margin">Euerie Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligious man is gouerned by God.</note> that euerie Religious man is as a trauelling beast, guided with reynes and bridle, by him that sits him; And he that sits vs, is our God: our Gouer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nours are as it were the bridle; for they likewise are in the hands of God, and doe not moue, but as they are moued. But commonly we mistake the busines, in regard that feeling the bridle, because it is neerer vnto vs, we heed not him that sits vs, because he is farther of; that is, we perceaue the voice and com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mand of our Superiours, because we heare them and see them; but because God is beyond the reach of sense, we consider not that euerie order which they make, comes from him; which very thing, in my opinion, doth most of al, and most plainly shew the benefit and necessitie of hauing some bodie, whom we may see with our eyes, and heare with our eares, to deliuer God Almightie's wil vnto vs. And it may be declared by that which passeth in the Sacraments instituted by him in his Church for the saluation of mankind For though we might haue had Grace &amp; Iustification giuen vs by Faith only,<note place="margin">The neces<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sitie of hauing spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritual go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uernours, declared by that which passeth in the Sacra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments.</note> by Pennance, &amp; Charitie, and other internal actions of our owne; yet he thought it better, that we should haue certain Sacraments, as conduits of his grace, some consisting in the formes of Bread and Wine, some in Oyle, some in the sensible Pronunciation of certain words; And this for two reasons: first be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause the nature of man consisteth of bodie and soule, and consequently it was <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>itting he should vse corporal instruments. To which purpose <hi>S.

                  </note> but because thy soule is inuested in thy bodie, he presenteth vnto thee things intelligible in those, which are sensible. The other reason is, because if the busines should haue been dealt between God and vs inwardly only in our mind, euerie bodie would haue been ful of scruples and doubts, whether he had sorrow enough, or loue enough, or done his dutie in euerie other respect, and neuer haue been at quiet, and our life would haue been te<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dious vnto vs amidst so manie difficulties. Wherefore the Diuine Wisdome did prouidently ordaine such helps for our Saluation, which we might partly touch with our hands, and see with our eyes, and perceaue with other senses. Both which reasons may be applyed to our case concerning Religious people. For in regard that our bodie is one part of vs, it was fitting we should be go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uerned and directed by men, that haue a bodie as we haue, not by God only, or by his holie Angels, who are meerly Spirits; and it belonged to the sweetnes of his Prouidence, of which we spake before, so to ordaine it. Besides that, in this life (and no man must maruel that I often cal it darknes) where nothing is more hard and difficult, then to vnderstand what in verie deed is the wil of
<pb n="70" facs="tcp:15193:42"/>
God, there could not haue been contriued a better thing, and a thing more be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neficial for our soules saluation, then this; being thereby put into a readie way, not only to conceaue, but to heare, and see his wil, a way so plaine and euident that we can neither mistake it, nor doubt of it, nor haue any cause to make anie stand in the busines.</p>

And by their manner of life they shew indeed that they are of this opinion; for they are so farre from practising the abnegation, or renunciation, or taking-vp of their Crosse, which our Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uiour commandeth, that they abhorre it, and shunne nothing more; and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trariwise they follow libertie, and pleasures, and licentiousnes so wholy, as if
<pb n="74" facs="tcp:15193:44"/>
our Sauiour had made quite contrarie lawes, and sayd: Blessed are the rich; Blessed are those that liue in pleasure; Blessed are they that are in greatest ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour and reputation with the world. Wherefore let vs conclude, and stick to this Tenet, which is so cleere in the light of the Ghospel, that absolutely al that haue beleeued the Ghospel, and subiected themselues to the lawes therof, whether they be Religious or Secular, are bound to frame their life &amp; actions, according to that high rule of Perfection,<note place="margin">Two Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clusions out of the pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mises.</note> which is generally proposed to al, in the life, &amp; holesome doctrine of Christ our Sauiour. Wherof two things must necessarily follow: First, that Religious people take not any new obligation or burthen vpon them, or at least that the obligation which is added, is but smal; but on the other side, the helps, which they receaue, are very great, and ease them very much in the carriage of that burthen, which is imposed vpon al; and make them beare it farre more chearfully Secondly, that the condition of them that liue in the world, is farre worse then it seemes to be; in regard they are in a manner as fully obliged to the self-same things, and yet haue so few and so smal helps therunto, and so manie important hindrances. Wherefore the case of them both in truth is, as if two were to trauel a long and hard iourney,<note place="margin">The point of differe<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ce betwixt the Religious and the Secular.</note> the one on foot, slowly, and with much payne &amp; labour<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> the other, in a good and easie coach, with this obligation, that he must not leaue his coach, nor go on foote. For as much as concerneth the perfection of the Euangelical Law, both are equally obliged to obserue it of necessitie. The obligation which lyeth particularly vpon Religious people more then others, is in the manner, and meanes of attayning to this Perfection, which is a great commoditie vnto them: for if it be profitable to vse a certain kind of instru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment for such a work, it must needs be much more profitable, that it be not in my power, not to vse it; al which wil be farre more euident, when we shal haue declared in particular al the special benefits of a Religious life.</p>

Which is most of al verifyed in Religion; in which that which is first in sight, is the difficulties, and rigour of Pouertie, and an outward aspect, conte<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ptible, knottie, &amp; rough, ful of labour and toile; but when we cast our eye vpon the

Whereby we may see, what a heape of punishments is layd-vp for so great a heape of sinnes, &amp; such sinnes as a Secular life is ful of.

<q>You desire to know of me, how it comes to passe, that among al the courses of pennance, a Monastical life hath deserued the prerogatiue to be styled a Second Baptisme; I think the reason is in regard of the perfect renouncing of the world, and the singular preheminence of a spiritual life; the conuersation therof excelling al the courses which man is wont to take, and making the louers therof like the Angels of heauen, and farre vnlike to earthlie men; it reformeth the Image of God in man, configuring vs to Christ, as Baptisme doth; finally we are in a manner Baptized the second time, in regard that mortifying our members which are vpon earth, we put on Christ againe, once more ingrafted to the similitude of his death. And moreouer as in Baptisme we are deliuered from the power of darknes, and translated into the kingdome of eternal glorie<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> so in the second kind of regeneration of this holie purpose, in like manner from the darknes, not only of one Original sinne but of manie Actual sinnes, we passe to the light of vertue; accommodating that saying of the Apostle to ourselues; <hi>The night is passed, and the day is at hand.</hi>

Al which may be confirmed with this one argument, wherwith I wil con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clude this Chapter, as containing the substance of what hath been hitherto sayd. For the reason why Baptisme blotteth-out al former offences, is because in it we dye to our <hi>old life,</hi> and are borne againe into a <hi>new life</hi>; which is that which <hi>S. Paul</hi> doth euerie where teach, when sometimes he sayth <hi>we are dead,</hi> sometimes <hi>buried with Christ,</hi> and <hi>reuiued againe with him,</hi> and that <hi>our life is hidden in him</hi>; so that, to speake properly, in the Lauer of Baptisme the same man that entred, doth not come forth, but quite an other man; for he that entred, is dead, and another risen in his place; so that the sinnes of that man that is dead, cannot be layd to the charge of the man that is new-borne; no more then my sinnes can be layd to another man, or another man's to me; &amp; the self-same hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neth in Religion. For we dye to the world &amp; to the works therof, &amp; moreouer to ourselues, and our owne wil; in somuch that we cannot enioy the world, nor make vse of the offers therof, nor of our owne wil, no more then if we were indeed buried. Wherefore seing Religious people, as in Baptisme, leaue to be what they were before, and begin to be new men in a new life, and quite other thoughts and endeauours, placing their contentment in other manner of pleasures, and ends, and intentions; it is no wonder that the punishment of the offences, to which the old man was lyable, be blotted out, and lye dead; and that this other man cannot be charged with them.</p>

<pb n="79" facs="tcp:15193:46"/>
among which it is none of the least, that generally they do not encrease their feruour and deuotion, but rather leese it, through the toyle and trouble of iourneying; and oftimes fal vpon occasions of offending God more. But this Indulgence giueth great encrease of sanctitie, and moreouer (as I sayd before) doth not proceed from the power and authoritie of man, which is limited and confined, but from the meere wil and bountie of God, and the excellencie of the work itself. So that euerie Religious man may with great reason make account, that our Sauiour speaketh those comfortable words vnto him, which are in the Ghospel: <hi>Thy sinnes are forgiuen thee; goe in peace.</hi>

Thus farre <hi>S. Bernard</hi>; and I find that other holie men haue been al of the same mind; inuiting men to a Religious life, to the end they may case themselues of the heauie weight of their sinnes; as <hi>S. Romualdus,</hi>

The same he perswaded with Count <hi>Olibanus</hi> a great man in <hi>France</hi>; who after manie heynous offences committed, being touched with remorse, came to <hi>S.

When the <hi>Saint</hi> had heard him, he told him there was no way for him to be saued, but by forsaking the world, and entring into Religion. The Count hauing quite other thoughts in his head, was much troubled; and calling to him the Bishops &amp; Abbots, which were in his com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>panie, he aduised with them, whether it were so indeed; and they answered with one voice, that <hi>S.

Then <hi>Oliba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nus</hi> in priuate conference agreed with the holie man, to forsake the world, and in effect did it not long after, to the great admiration of al that knew him.

We may see it more plainly in beasts, because the force of nature doth more liuely shew itself in them, in regard they are led in al things meerly by natural inclinations; let vs therefore consider what hapneth in in them, and take example by it. If we keep a horse in stable, and giue him his fil of oates, and rest; and keep an other at day-labour, with allowance litle enough to liue and be able to do the work we shal quickly find the diffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rence; For a horse that is wel kept and high fed, wil be alwayes playing and curuetting, and a man shal haue much adoe to hold him in with a double bit; he wil be running away when the rider would haue him stand, and stop and giue-back when he should go on, and cannot be for much vse, without a great deale of paynes and danger to the rider: But the horse that is kept at rack and manger is gentle enough, and wil not greatly stirre: he wil sooner sink, then offer to resist, whatsoeuer load you put vpon him; you shal not need to tye him to make him stand, and be quiet; but you may lay the reynes on his neck, and stay him, or put him on, or turne him with a word. Now certainly this inferiour nature of ours, which consists of flesh and bloud, and of that which we cal Life, and Sense, and Appetite, is the same with beasts; and so much the more headie in vs, then it is in them, in regard it is infected and corrupt by sinne, from which beasts are free; so that if we pamper it, and giue ourselues to ease, and a ful diet, and feed it with daynties, and al manner of pleasure,<note place="margin">S. <hi>Bernard.

When a soule therefore hath once shaken-of this clog, and maistered the insolencie of the flesh, which is the hand-maide, there ariseth another comoditie; to wit, that the mind, which is by nature mistris, is enabled the more nimbly and chearfully to runne the way of spirit, and in a short time to aduance itself greatly in the perfection of Humilitie, and Charitie, and al other Vertues. For our soule being a spiritual nature and substance, darke without vertue, as the ayre is without light, but bright and ligthtsome when it is adorned with vertue; certainly in al reason, it must needs loue vertue more then anie earthlie thing; in regard vertue is spiritual, and consequently more like vnto it, and more beautiful, were not this desire and inclination hindred by the lumpishnes of the bodie; which lumpishnes being greatly diminished (for it cannot be altogeather shaken-of til we come to heauen) and the burden of this bodie folded into a smal roome, and easie to carrie<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> our soule must needs be, not only more light to runne, but able to flye in pursuite of whatsoeuer is vertuous and prayse-worthie.</p>

<q>Our soule can neuer be without some delight; for either it pleaseth itself in base and vnworthie things, or in things high and worthie; and the more earnest it is in the prosecution of high things, the more it loatheth the inferiour; and the hoter it is vpon the desire of the inferiour, the more damnable is the cold tepiditie, with which it goeth about the higher.

And we shal discouer the greatnes of this commoditie much more plainly, if
<pb n="91" facs="tcp:15193:52"/>
we consider how weak and feeble our nature is,<note place="margin">Our nature is weak, when it is to encoun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter Sense.</note> when it is to encounter Sense, and fight against those affections, which are alwayes more violently inflamed by the presence of the sensible obiect; of which weaknes we may easily find the reason to be, because while our soule is enclosed within our bodie, and so lincked vnto it that they make one man, the things which our Senses as messengers do bring vnto it, must needs make great impression in it. We find it in the passion of grief, and ioy, and feare, and the rest; which are most violent, when the cause is present. A mother is more violently trans<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ported with grief, when she sees the dead corps of her sonne lye before her feet, then when she heares of his death. And they that go about to comfort them that are in sorrow, are careful that nothing come in sight, which may refresh the memorie of the thing for which they grieue. Wherefore as grief, and anger, and other passions are sooner and more violently stirred by the presence of their proper obiects; why should not the same also happen in loue? doubtlesse vpon the sight of a thing that is beautiful, it is also much more inflamed. Religious people therefore take a holesome and profitable course, to hide and sequester themselues from al earthlie things, of which the continual sight cannot choose but stirre men vp to loue them, and nourish the same loue in them. For if to preserue ourselues chaste and ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nest, it is not only profitable,<note place="margin">

For that which hapneth in that loue, which Chastitie doth withstand and vanquish, hapneth in al other kinds of loue; whether it be of money, or honour, or pleasure, to which auarice, or ambition, or intemperance doth incite vs. These kinds of loue must in like manner of necessitie be much more inflamed by the sight of gold, and the glittering of a purple robe, and the touch of pleasure, which Sense doth affect; and contrariwise, if none of these things euer approach before our eyes, the loue of them must needs grow dayly lesse and lesse, and at last be wholy extinguished.</p>

                  <hi>S.

                     </gap> secular life.</note> First, in getting, keeping, and disposing of external goods, which cannot but be alwayes accompanied with infinit care and toyle. From this most toylesome and heauie burthen, the profession of Reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gious Pouertie doth free vs. The second kind of trouble is in the gouern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of wife and children, that must be maintayned, and bred vp, and kept from running-out into such vices, as green yeares are apt to fal into. And the present care is not enough, but the future must be prouided for, that they want not when their parents be dead, but may liue, and main<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tayne themselues according to their degree; which makes there is no end in worldlie people of heaping-vp wealth, and encreasing their estate. This endles trouble and molestation, the Vow of Chastitie doth cut off. Finally, the third, and most troublesome care of al, is, how to go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uerne our owne life and actions; wherin we stand in need of daylie counsel, in regard of infinit difficulties which doe occurre, and the hazard of running into most dangerous errours; from al which anxietie and danger Obedience doth free vs, transferring this care to another, who, as the Apostle speaketh,<note place="margin">

                  <hi>is to giue an account for vs</hi>; and no doubt, but whatsoeuer he ordayneth concerning vs, is the ordination of God himself by his meanes. This is the effect of <hi>S. Thomas</hi> his discourse.</p>

force and efficacie it hath to rayse our thoughts to the contemplation and knowledge of heauenlie things. For as no man can attentiuely think of anie thing in the midst of a great hurrie and noise,<note place="margin">It is hard to think of good things in the world.</note> but in the dead of the night, or in a solitarie place, that verie silence and solitude doth inuite a man to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>templation; so it is very hard to recollect one's self in the world, where there be such endles distractions; but the quiet of a Religious life doth of its owne nature cal vs, and hold vs without difficultie in the studie of heauenlie know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge free from al kind of trouble. Wherof <hi>S.

This difference between a Religious life and a Secular, is excellently wel expressed by <hi>S.

A secular life therefore is rightly called a Sea, because being tossed with the tempestuous motions of outward actions, it is depriued of the quiet and stabilitie of inward wisdome.

And first, it laboureth nothing more then abso<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lutly to stubbe-vp this root of al euil, which is self-wil; curbing and beating downe the verie first motions therof, as much as may be; and accustoming a Religious person so much to do nothing of his owne head, but to gouerne himself wholy by an other's wil and command, that euerie one doth exactly obserue that,<note place="margin">S. <hi>Hierome. Ep</hi> 4.</note> which <hi>S. Hierome</hi> (a man wel skilled in what belongeth to a Religious Institute) writeth to <hi>Rusticus,</hi> a Monk of his time:
<q>That thou mayst not do thy owne wil, eate that which thou art commanded to eate, weare that which is giuen thee, worke-out the taske which is set thee, be subiect to one whom thou hast no mind to, go to bed wearie, and sleep as thou goest, and be fayne to rise againe before thou hast slept thy sleep.</q>
Wherefore as self-wil doth dayly grew stronger and stronger in a Secular man by prac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tise and custome therof, that a man may sooner break it, then bend it, as an old crooked tree ful of knots: So the wil of a good Religious man by contrarie custome being continually beaten downe, there remaynes not at last so much as one bough or twig therof intire.</p>
               <p n="4">4.

And as for the Superiours; as those, that vndertake to breake a horse, sometimes spurre him vp to make him runne, sometime hold him in to his pace, sometimes turne him round, sometimes when he is vpon his speed they suddainly check him, or put him on when he is giuen to stand, teaching him to go or stand, as he is guided, and not of his owne braine: So they endeauour with al diligence, by contrarie exercises to breake the wils of their subiects, euen in things which of themselues are trifles, but that of final things, greater do depend.

                  <hi>S.

The bulk is greater, and the burthen lighter; and by how much the bodie is bigger, the weight is lesse.</q>
Which he applieth to the Euangelical Counsels, styling them properly the burden of Christ; which doth not only not load a man, but carrie him that is laden with them, and maketh the burden of the Precepts farre more easie to be vndergone.</p>

How few are there in the world that keepe themselues from rash oathes, from coueting an other's goods, from wantonnes of the flesh, as the Precepts require? And the few that by God's grace doe maintayne themselues vnspotted, what la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bour, and care, and contention are they put-to? That therefore, wherin Secular people doe most commonly fayle and perish, and wherin others,
<pb n="104" facs="tcp:15193:59"/>
that doe not perish, must take such excessiue paynes, and, as I may say, sweat it out; Religious people find great ease, and performe it with little or no difficultie. The reasons therof are manie; and first, because (as we sayd els<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>where, speaking of it, as of the source and head of manie other commodities) Religion doth take away the matter almost of al sinnes; and the matter being taken away, the obseruance of the Commandments of itself is easie. For our wil is as it were a kind of flame or fire; the fuel of this fire, is the presence of a pleasing obiect; put this fuel to it, and presently it wil flame vp; take away the fuel, and either it wil not kindle at al, or much more slowly and remissely. And this is that which Religion doth, taking vs out of the world, and the allurements therof. And so <hi>S. Basil</hi> euen for this reason sayth,<note place="margin">S <hi>Basil in proamio Reg. sut.</hi>
                  </note> that Religion is highly to be esteemed, tearming it a quiet life; voyd of multiplicitie of busi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesses, and a help to the wel-obseruing of the doctrine of the Ghospel.</p>

For as to a man that hath vsed himself euerie day to carrie a hundred weight, it is nothing to carrie twentie; so when a Religious man hath for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>saken al his owne land and liuing, what hard matter wil it be for him to with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hold himself from taking-away or coueting that which is another's?

For hauing on a time ouer-curiously beheld certain husbandmen that were ploughing, for punish<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of this smal fault, he put an iron collar about his owne neck, and fastned it with a chayne about his middle; so that of force he must alwayes hold his head downewards; and this pennance he endured fourtie yeares togeather, neuer being able to reare himself and looke vp to heauen. And being asked why he did so, and what benefit he hoped thereby; his answer was, that he <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 word">

                  </gap> Satan from greater combats, and from tempting him with pride or wantones, to these smaller conflicts; in which if he should be ouercome, there were no great harme done; if he did ouercome, the greater shame was
<pb n="105" facs="tcp:15193:59"/>
the Diuel's that could not be maister in such smal trifles. A memorable saying, and worthie of so spiritual and holie a man; and by it we may vnder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stand to our purpose, that it is true, that Religious men are the farther from transgressing the Commandments of God, in regard they take so much care to performe manie smaller things pertayning to his seruice.</p>
               <p n="6">6. A fourth reason of this facilitie in keeping the Precepts drawne from the nature of the state itself, is that this course of life is aboue the Law, and consequently doth lift a man aboue that which the Law requireth. And as in a Sch<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

Wherefore if there were no other thing but this to be found in Religion, that it enableth vs to keepe the Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mandments of God constantly, with great ease and pleasure, and with very litle danger of euer sinning against them; we should not need to seeke anie other benefit by it. For the more it enableth vs in this kind, the more certain and easie it doth make our passage to eternal glorie, to which we must come by keeping the Commandments.</p>

fal; for Humilitie alone exalteth, humilitie alone leades to life.</q> If therefore we be of <hi>S. Bernard</hi>'s mind, there is no cause, why we should enuie Secular people their preferments, or purple robes, or external pompe; rather we ought to esteeme it very beneficial and highly glorious, that we liue without glorie, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause this Humilitie is not only an assured way, but (as he sayth) the onlie way to eternal Saluation; and is particularly rich in three commodities, or, as I may cal them, priuiledges, which heer I shal set downe.</p>
               <p n="2">
                  <note place="margin">Three priuiledges of the humble state of Religion.</note>2. First, God doth particularly affect this kind of humble state and com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>municate himself and his heauenlie treasures with it more plentifully, more familiarly, and with greater sweetnes. A strange thing; yet such as the Prophet <hi>Dauid</hi> doth also point at, when he sayth: <hi>Our Lord is high, and regardeth humble things;</hi>
                  <note place="margin">
                     <hi>Ps.</hi> 111.6.</note> 
                  <hi>and knoweth high things afarre-of.</hi> For likenes doth most co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>monly breed friendship and loue; yet God being so infinitly great, as he is, doth take most delight in the loue and conuersation of such as are little and lowlie; and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trariwise doth stand aloof and looke afarre-of vpon those that are high and loftie.</p>
               <p n="3">3. Secondly, this kind of Humilitie, is the fittest coyne, we can lay-out vpon the purchase of eternal glorie. For though we are al created for that Euerlasting Happines, as the onlie End of vs al; yet God, as a most vnder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>standing and vpright prizer of such things, hath most iustly ordayned, that we should not come <hi>gratis</hi> by so great rewards, but buy them at a price; and the price is to suffer in this life things contrarie to that, which there we shal enioy; as, because there we shal haue most perfect satietie, we must purchase it heer,<note place="margin">
                     <hi>Mat.</hi> 5.</note> with hunger and thirst; the infinit comfort which there we shal haue, is promised only to those that mourne; and to that abundance of al kind of wealth, we must come by pouertie; and as al other happines, which is to be had in that Heauenlie Kingdome, is to be bought in this fashion, so the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>finit honour and glorie which is there, is to be bought with humilitie and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tempt of ourselues.<note place="margin">
                     <hi>Luc.</hi> 14.11.</note> And because we should not doubt therof, our Sauiour gaue this general rule, that <hi>euerie one, that exalteth himself, shal be humbled; and euerie one that humbleth himself, shal be exalted.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="4">4. Thirdly, by this Humilitie we auoide manie dangers of our soule, and impediments to vertue, which are incident to a life led in glorie and pompe; and in steede of them, we haue in it manie helps to saluation. For it is in the life of man, as it is with them, that clime vp to the tops of trees, or houses; if they fal, they crush themselues most miserably; and how easie is it for them to fal, if their hand or their foot doe but slip? and what care must they haue that they doe not slip? Those that keep them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selues below on the ground, fal not so soone, not so dangerously: So they, that are in honour, runne great hazard, not only while they are cli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ming, and pretend, and labour for it, but euen when they are seated in the chayre;<note place="margin">Honour, the cause of ruine.</note> for we are by nature apt to slide, and tumble downewards, and shal meet with manie that wil striue to thrust vs along. They that keepe them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selues below on the ground, and walke not in great and wonderful things aboue their reach, are secure.</p>
               <p n="5">5. We might bring manie examples to this purpose, but that which hapned to <hi>Saul,</hi> the first King among Iewes, is so notorious, that it
<pb n="107" facs="tcp:15193:60"/>
shal serue for al. While he was but a priuate man, he was litle also in his owne conceit; the meannes of his estate helping him to be humble in mind; But when he was seated in the Throne, as King, he became so proude and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>solent, that he may wel be ranked with the wickedest Kings that euer were. Before, he saued the life of his enemies whom the people would haue killed; afterwards he laboured to kil his friend and sonne-in-law.</p>
               <p n="6">6. Whereby we may see, how much we are beholding to Religion, for keeping vs out of the eyes of men, and from worldlie preferments, in a holie and holesome place of refuge; where we may abide vnknowne to the world, and it vnknowne to vs.<note place="margin">

<pb n="110" facs="tcp:15193:62"/>
their bodie, so the others wil neuer be sound in some. This is the true and solid discourse of this prime Philosopher. For Vertue is a Habit, as Philoso<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phers cal it; and seing a habit is not gotten but by often acts, Vertue also can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not be gotten but by vse and often practise therof. And speaking of Moral Vertues, there can be no doubt made, but this doctrine is true; and the same doth hold also in the Theological Vertues. For though they be at first infused into our soules by the sole guift of God, yet (if we set infants aside that are new baptized) they require before-hand some preparation of mind, which consists in the exercise of some acts; and after they are infu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed, they are encreased and strengthened by the same acts.
<q>Wherefore that which <hi>S Bernard</hi> speaketh of Humilitie,<note place="margin">S. <hi>Bernard</hi>
                     </note> may be sayd of al other Vertues, the reason being the same in al. The humbling of ourselues is the way to get humilitie; as patience is the way to haue peace; and reading, to get knowledge.

For as for the Loue of God and our Neighbour, we may spare a labour to speake of it; because it is apparent, that in Religion people doe nothing els but seeke how they may dayly encrease in the loue of God; &amp; there cannot be among men more loue and friendship towards one another, then there is among Religious people; who as they are indeed, so are called Brethren, as it were proceeding from one bellie.

No man is great among them, no man is litle; yet there is no confusion, but order most exactly kept; for if anie one of them be litle, he that is great, regards not that, but rather esteemes himself lower then the least; and thereby becomes greater.</q>
And that which <hi>S. Chrysostome</hi> sayth of Humilitie, may be savd of other Vertues, al of them being in Religion conti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nually practised; which declares not only how beneficial this course of life is,

And if there be anie (as certainly there be some few in the world) so wise and warie as to direct their actions carefully to God; yet the actions themselues being of their owne nature earthlie, they must be continually labouring and toyling to rayse them, and keepe them vp from the earth, which endeauour of their<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

It hapneth quite otherwise with Religious people; for first forsaking their owne house and goods, they are taken into the house of God and his Familie; and consequently whatsoeuer busines they haue there, it is properly God's; and so long as they are employed in it, they labour for God, and not for themselues, so that if we compare the state of a Secular man, that liues wel and vpright, with the state of a man that liues in Religion, there is this difference betwixt them, that the one serueth as a friend, the other as a seruant; a friend by entreatie or of his owne accord, may do his friend some seruice, but yet he is to liue of himself, and must pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uide for his owne occasions; a seruant that dwelleth with his maister, al that he doth, must be for his Maister's seruice: so when a Religious man hath left al that he had, and put himself into the seruice of God, he must of force, and in a manner whether he wil or no, attend God Almightie's busines, and day and night wayte vpon him; and he can doe no other, because he hath withdrawne himself from his owne priuate affayres; not only in wil and purpose, but by distance of place, and absence from the things themselues.</p>

Moreouer,<note place="margin">Three sorte of employ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments of Religious people, and al spiritual.</note> that which we handle in Religion is not properly earthlie, but for the most part Spiritual, or mingled with some Spiritual thing. For al that a Religious man doth, may be reduced to three heads: First are the actions which are immediatly directed to God, as Prayer, Contem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plation, the vse of the Sacraments, the practice of the vertues of Humilitie, Charitie, Pennance, internal by contrition of hart, and external by pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nishing the bodie; in which actions a Religious man spends the greater part of his life, and no bodie can make anie doubt, but they tend directly of their owne nature, without anie labour of ours, to God, and deserue a re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward at his hands. There be other works that are external, yet proceede from the verie bowels of Religion; as to preach, to heare Confessions, to encourage others to deuotion, to giue good aduice to those that aske it, and oftimes to those that doe not aske it,<note place="margin">2. <hi>Tim</hi> 4 2.</note> as the Apostle wisheth, <hi>opportunity and importunely,</hi> finally whatsoeuer is done for the spiritual help of our Neigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bour; to which we may adde the employments which are as it were prepara<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ti<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

<pb n="120" facs="tcp:15193:67"/>
yet of their owne nature they tend to the same end; and consequently, vnlesse they be wrested and corrupted by a different end and intention from without, they are of themselues good and grateful to God; so that there is great diffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rence betwixt the employments of a Secular and a Religious man; because these be of their owne nature Spiritual and meritorious, vnlesse they be marred by some extrinsecal accident; Secular peoples busines is of itself earthlie and temporal, and alwayes cleaues to the earth, and dyes with it, vnlesse it be raysed by some other meanes. And who is so strong and able, amidst so much weaknes as is in a Secular life, as to stand perpetual Sentinel watching ouer his works, and alwayes to keep his bow at that ful bent, that his arrowes (his actions I meane) may flye aloft.</p>

The third kind of works be those that are meerly natural, as to eate and drink, to sleepe, to tend ourselues when we are sick or that we may not fal into sicknes, to prouide necessaries for diet and apparrel; wherin is much bu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sines, and manie occurrences; these things of them selues, if we go no higher, are nothing; but may be easily so handled by a Religious man, as they wil be of great worth, and beautie, and desert in the sight of God. For, hauing giuen them their bodie togeather with their soule, al the seruice and care they bestow vpon it as such is pleasing to God, and shal not fayle of a reward. The matter therefore resteth in the intention, which is the other cheek of the Spouse, as I sayd out of <hi>S. Bernard</hi>; wherin it is so apparently easie for a Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligious man to walke vprightly, and please our Lord God, that I shal not need to spend manie words in declaring it. For Secular people, though they haue manie times no il intention in their actions, yet most commonly their inten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion is earthlie and temporal, ayming at the maintenance or setting-vp of their House and Familie. But what should a Religious man haue anie such thing in his head? Though sometimes that which he handleth be temporal, yet his end is spiritual, not ordayned to his owne priuate interest, but to the common benefit of his Brethren; which also is wholy directed to the honour and glorie of God.</p>

Besides, the Rules haue somewhat more then Superiours and gouernours; because al gouernours must follow the intention of the Law, and rule themselues by it, to gouerne wel. Wherefore the same Philoso<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pher sayth, that a good Common-wealth ought to be so ordered, that the Law be stil in force, &amp; gouerne in a manner alone by itself; &amp; that the Prince and Magistrates are only ministers and guardians of the Law; yet so, as they haue power and authoritie to interpret and supply the Law, if in that gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral fashion of speech, which it vseth, there be anie thing wanting or doubtful; which forme of best gouernment doth most certainly flourish in Religion.</p>

Finally hauing finished his Rule, he brought it to the Pope, where againe there was much difficultie made, touching that new kind of rigid and strict pouertie; but <hi>S.

And in that Booke he noted day by day, the lights, rapts, &amp; visions which had hapned vnto him, of our B. Ladie, the B. Trinitie, and others. Whence we may conclude, that not that point alone, of which we find this written, but al the rest of the Constitutions were penned by Diuine instinct, and not by humane wit &amp; inuention; and the same we vnderstand of al other Religions with so much the greater reason, by how much ours is inferiour vnto them in worth and sanctitie.</p>

                  </note> of whom <hi>S.

And <hi>Cassian</hi> doth relate it of him more at large in these words:<note place="margin">
                     <hi>Cassian. lib.</hi> 5. <hi>c.</hi> 4.</note>
It is an ancient and a wonderful good saying of <hi>S. Antonie,</hi> 
                  <q>that a Monk that hath chosen to liue in a Monasterie with others, and aymeth at the heighth of great Perfection, must not think to learne al kind of vertue of one man. For one man is decked with the flower of knowledge, another more strongly prouided of the vertue of discretion, another is grounded in constant patience, another excelleth in humilitie, another in continencie, another hath a special grace in simplicitie; one is renowned for magnanimitie, another for charitie and compassion; one for watching, another for silence, another for labour and paynes taking; and therefore a Monk must, like a prouident bee, gather the spiritual honie which he desires, from the partie, in whom he sees that vertue most naturally grow, &amp; hiue it vp carefully in his breast.</q> Thus speakes <hi>Cassian</hi> from <hi>S. Antonie's</hi> mouth.</p>
               <p n="2">2. Let vs therefore see, how and in what manner Religion doth teach vs al kind of vertue by example of others. First wheras the way of Vertue is dark and obscure,<note place="margin">Ho<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

Wherefore, as we vse to say, that pictures are the books of vnlearned people, so are examples also books written with great Roman letters, which a bodie cannot choose but see and reade, be he neuer so negligent and carelesse.</p>
               <p n="3">3. <hi>Seneca</hi> in few words pithily expresseth two other fruits of Example.

So when <hi>S. Francis</hi> washed the sick man that was ful of leprosie, and <hi>S. Catherine</hi> of <hi>Siena</hi> did so diligently tend a froward il-toungued woman, that was half mad, they gaue farre better and more compendious documents, how we ought to loue our neighbour, and hate ourselues, and exercise humilitie and patience, then if they had vndertaken to declare the same with long cir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cumstance of words.</p>

               <p n="3">3. And first, as concerning ourselues, we reade in holie Scripture, that <hi>It is better to be two togeather, then one; for they haue the benefit of their societie; if

                  <hi>he may be slayed by another. Woe to him that is alone; because when he is fallen, he hath none to lift him vp. If two sleepe togeather, they wil cherish one an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>other. How shal one be warme? And if one preuayle, two wil resist him. A triple cord is hardly broken.</hi> In which words we may find three commodities ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pressed, without which a spiritual life cannot subsist. For first conside<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring we are so weake, and the place, where we stand, so very slipperie, that we cannot but often fal, is it not a great benefit to haue one alwayes with vs to giue vs his hand, and lift vs vp? Which in the falles which the Soule doth come by, is much more necessarie, then when our bodie falles. For in these, we may fore-see, when and where we are like to fal; but our soule is often blinded, and falles in the dark, and lyeth stil a great while, thinking not of it, or perhaps thinking that it stands wel enough. Besides when our soule once gets a fal, it bruseth itself so sorely, that vnlesse it haue help from without, it cannot rise againe; which help comes chiefly from God, but yet by the hands and assistance of men. And put the case, there were a man so fortunate, as neuer to fal (which is impossible) he is in danger notwithstanding of a certain spiritual cold<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nes, which easily creepes vpon vs, in the dead winter of this world, where we walk in so great a distance from that Sunne of Iustice, which one day wil shew his face, and warme vs. To put away this cold, and bring heate into our soules, nothing can be better, then, as the Wise-man speaketh, that <hi>one cherish another</hi>; and if there be more togeather, the heate must needs be the greater. For, as we see a peece of great timber wil not burne of itself in the fire, but if you put some brands ends vnto it, it presently kindleth; so our soules, if they be left alone, waxe cold; but in companie of others that be <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

And neerer to our purpose; seing in Religion al haue the same end, and direct their actions and endeauours to one common intention and purpose, they are as readie and quick to help one another, and doe it as cheerfully, as the hand is readie to help the eye; or the eye, the hand; or the feete, the head; or rather as the hand, or the eye, or anie other part is readie to help itself; because that which is a benefit to the common, profits euerie particular man; and that which euerie particular man doth for anie of the rest, he doth it certainly for him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>self; by which meanes that which one wanteth, is most easily and perfectly supplyed with an other's plentie; a thing so beneficial in itself, and so much desired of euerie bodie.

               <p>
                  <seg rend="decorInit">T</seg>HE other effect of Religious vnitie, is the Communication of good works, among al those that are of the same Order and Familie; and that we may the better discouer the greatnes of this benefit, we must consider what is communicated, and how. First therefore it is certain, that in al good works there be three things to be considered: The encrease of grace which euerie good work doth merit,<note place="margin">Three things in euerie good work.</note> togeather with the proportion of glorie and reward in heauen, corre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sponding to the measure and value of the work. And this is euer proper and peculiar to him that doth the work, for it is the priuiledge of Christ our head and mediatour only, by his paynes and passion to haue merited grace &amp; glorie for others. The second co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>moditie of a good work is, that it satisfyeth for our sinnes past; &amp; this may be communicated with others, &amp; wholy applyed vnto them, if we wil. The third is Impetration, a great help towards the sauing of our soules; for whatsoeuer we doe that is pleasing in the eyes of God, doth not only deserue a reward for that which is past, but deserueth help for the time to come, to wit, that we may perseuer to the end, and goe forward in vertue, and withstand our ghostlie enemies, ouercome our passions, abide that which is hard &amp; difficult, in fine to obtaine whatsoeuer may conduce to our saluation. And this Impetration may be also conferred vpon another by the wil of him, in whom it is; which is no smal benefit, seing it is in the next degree to that grace, wherin the life of our soule doth consist; for though no man can merit Iustifying-grace for another, he may merit notwithsta<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ding those helps wher<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by Iustifying-grace is easily encreased.</p>
               <p n="2">2. Now there be two wayes,<note place="margin">Two wayes of commu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nicating good works.</note> whereby these things may be communicated: the one, by wil, as it were bestowing my wealth vpon another, by my owne guift; the other without anie expresse act of the wil, but as it were by natu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral consequence. For supposing that some ioyne in a communitie togeather, it followeth naturally of itself, though none of them think therof, that al their works &amp; merits are co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>mon among them, so that the immediat ground of this co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>munication is the bond or tye which is betwixt them; insomuch that where that is, &amp; the streighter &amp; firmer it is, the communion also of merits &amp; works must needs be more ample &amp; ful. And we may declare it by that which passeth in a natural &amp; outward societie or companie, wherof there be diuers degrees: The first is grounded in likenes of nature, which comprehendeth al mankind; and by occasion therof manie things are common among al men, as the seas, and sea-shores, and manie things of that nature. Againe those of the same countrie are more neerly lincked, &amp; haue manie things co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>mon among them; as their language, and manie rights and duties. A neerer degree then this, is to be of the same towne and cittie; wherin manie more things are common, as the streets, the Courts, the Lawes, Churches, Customes. The neerenes of affinitie &amp; kindred is yet a streighter tye; &amp; the neerest of al is of those that be of the same
<pb n="148" facs="tcp:15193:81"/>
household and familie, wherin al things are common, possessions, monie, household-stuffe, nobilitie also and honour. In like manner in the spiritual coniunction we speake off, the greatest societie comprehendeth al that are in the state of Grace and Charitie; and as among them doubtles manie things are common, so euerie particular man among them hath some share of the good deeds, which are done by al the rest. Which <hi>Dauid</hi> reflecting-on did much re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ioyce saying: <hi>I am partaker with al that <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

Neerer then this, is to be of one and the same Religious Familie, where al haue the same Superiours, and Rules, and rites, the self-same end, commodities and incommodities, and al things common among them. Wherefore as in a wel-ordered Familie, whatsoeuer one brother acquireth, he acquireth it not to himself alone, but to al the rest of his brethren; &amp; in a com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>panie of marchants, the gayne of euerie particular man, redounds to the benefit of the whole Companie, &amp; the encrease, which ariseth, is equally diuided amo<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>g them al; much more the spiritual lucre must needs extend itself to al such Bre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thren and Fellowes as are linked togeather by a spiritual knot and tye, which is yet more euident in the example of a man's bodie, the coniunction of the members wherof doe expresse the coniunction of Religious people more na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turally, then anie thing els. For we see, that the bodie receaueth sustenance so, as though one member take paynes in getting it, an other in chewing, another in disgesting it, yet the iuyce and nourishment is equally de<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

Wherefore if we take things right, we may be iustly thought in Religion to loue God with so manie soules, to worke with so manie hands, to runne about good things with so manie feete, to beare hardnes with so manie shoulders, as we haue companions; because they doe al these things for our benefit, and not for themselues only.</p>

Now amongst al Vowes, the Vowes of Religion without al question haue the chiefest place, and consequently bring great profit to our soules. And first (as <hi>S.

For if we doe an act of an inferiour Vertue vpon a higher motiue, or commanded by a higher Vertue, that act must needs be higher, and more noble; as an act of Iustice or Fortitude, done vpon motiue of Charitie, or commanded by Charitie; and consequently the Vertue of Religion being higher then anie Moral Vertue, and a Vow being an act of Religion, whatsoeuer Moral Vertue we exercise by obligation of Vow, it must needs be higher and of greater value, then if we did the same out of the proper motiue of the Moral Vertue.<note place="margin">S. <hi>Aug de Virg c.</hi> 8.</note> 
                  <hi>S. Augustin</hi> deliuereth the self<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>same doctrine in his Treatise of Virginitie, where he speaketh thus:
<q>Virgi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nitie itself is not respected, because it is Virginitie, but because it is dedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cated to God; it is kept in the flesh, yet it is the spirit of Religion and deuo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion which keeps it; by which meanes the Virginitie also of the bodie is spiritual, which pious Continencie doth vowe and keepe. And a litle after: That Continencie is to be reckoned among the goods of the mind in a more honourable place, wherin the integritie of the bodie is kept, vowed and consecrated to God the Creatour of soule and bodie.</q> And this which <hi>S. Augustin</hi> sayth of Continencie, may be sayd of al other Vertues; as that the works of Obedience, Humilitie, Temperance, and others ennobled by Religion, and done by obligation of Vow, are much more rich and pretious.</p>
               <p n="2">2. An other reason is, because euerie good thing is alwayes better, by putting an other good thing to it. Now the verie promise of a good thing, is good; as we may see by that which hapneth dayly among men. For vnlesse a bodie be a verie clowne, he must needs loue and thank a man not only for doing, but for promising a good turn; and consequently it is better
<pb n="152" facs="tcp:15193:83"/>
and more gratful to God to vowe a thing and doe it, then to doe it only. Besi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>des a work offered by Vow, is incredibly much better then the same work offered by itself; because by Vow we doe not only offer the work or act, but the power, which is our wil and freedome, renouncing it wholy and disa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bling ourselues from not willing, or not doing it euer after. To which purpose <hi>S. Anselme</hi> brings a knowne Similitude of one that giues away not only the fruit,<note place="margin">S. <hi>Anselme lib. Sim l. S. Bon<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                  </note> but the tree itself. And <hi>S. Bonauenture</hi> sayth thus:
<q>Acts of Vertue may be done either out of our meere free wil, and so they haue only the perfection which is in the vertues themselues; or besides our wil, we may adde the obli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gation of Vow, &amp; this bringeth with it the perfectio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> of a State; because no man can be in state of perfection, that retayneth freedome of doing, or not doing. Now the necessitie which a State doth bring, is so farre from diminishing Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fection, that it doth wonderfully encrease and perfect it; because of a temporal thing, it maketh it to be eternal, &amp; of ours, Diuine, dedicating not only the action, but the wil to God, and offering it fully and wholy vnto him, slayne in a most noble Sacrifice: which Wil being a good inestimable, so neere to man and so deere, that in regard of it he contemneth al other things, the guift therof must needs be most acceptable, and most pleasing to God. Where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore as he that hath both vse and possession of anie thing, doth possesse that thing more perfectly, then he that hath the bare vse of it; so he that offereth to God not his work only, but his free wil, doth giue himself more perfectly vnto him.</q>
Thus sayth <hi>S. Bonauenture.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="3">3. An other thing of great consideration is, that wheras the chiefest com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mendation of our works dependeth of our wil, as of the root from whence they spring, the better our wil is, the better also are our works, and the more commendable. And doubtles among manie qualities of a good wil, it is none of the least, that it be firme, setled, constant, and perpetual, and farre from that which holie Scripture finds fault with,<note place="margin">
                     <hi>Prou</hi> 13 4. <hi>Aristotle.</hi> 2. <hi>Eth.</hi> 4.</note> saying; <hi>The slouthful man wil, and wil not.</hi> Insomuch that <hi>Aristotle</hi> was also of opinion, that Vertue must worke firmely, and immouably, as he speaketh; and we may gather it to be so,<note place="margin">They that vowe, are like the Blessed in <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>eauen.</note> by the contratie. For as it is il, to doe euil out of frayltie, or out of weaknes of iudgement; but much worse, to do it out of a peruerse obstinate wil of committing sinne, and persisting in it: so al acts of Vertue are good and laudable, but certainly they are without comparison better, which are done with a more deliberate and setled resolution; and as they that are so maliciously euil, are like to the Diuel, and the damned with him, who can not be wonne from their peruersenes: so the others are like the Blessed in heauen, whose wil is so tyed to that which is good, that it can neuer departe from it.</p>
               <p n="4">4. And what meanes is there to settle and tye our wil, but by a firme and solemne promise, which may last for euer? For there be bonds to bind the bodie; and bonds to bind the soule; but with this difference, that our bodies may be bound whether we wil or no, and by the like violence the bonds may be knockt-of againe; our mind and soule cannot be bound, vnlesse it bind itself; and hauing bound itself, it is neither in our owne, nor in anie humane power to vnbind it.</p>
               <p n="5">5. And the greatnes of this benefit wil be the more euident, if we consider on the one side, our owne infirmitie, &amp; on the other side the bold obstinacie of
<pb n="153" facs="tcp:15193:83"/>
the Diuel in oppugning vs, both in their kind being very great. Wherefore ther can not possibly be a more necessarie defence then a Vow and promise;<note place="margin">The power of a Vow, to defend.</note> in regard our frayltie is thereby strengthned, and his attempts barred. For as suiters, when they see that the mayde, whom they made loue to, is married to an other, turne their thoughts another way; so when our ghostlie enemies see vs espoused to God, they loose their hope of intangling vs againe in earthlie things; and therefore leaue to sollicite vs, least to their owne greater tor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment they encrease our crowne. And what could be more fit to hold our wil fast and steadie (it being naturally so frayle and slipperie) then the obliga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of Vow? For it doth not perswade or moue vs only, but it forceth vs; as <hi>S. Bernard</hi> doth insinuate in these words: A happie necessitie, which, as a holie man sayth, forceth to the better. The holie man, whose name <hi>S. Ber<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nard</hi> concealeth,<note place="margin">
                     <hi>S. Bernard de precep. &amp; disp S. August. Ep.</hi> 48.</note> is <hi>S. Augustin.</hi> For in his Epistle to <hi>Armentarius</hi> he speaketh thus: Doe not repent thee that thou hast vowed; rather be glad that now thou canst not doe that, which before thou couldst to thy losse. Set vpon it therefore with vndanted courage; and by thy deeds<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> make thy words good. He wil assist, who desireth our vowes. It is a happie necessitie; which forceth to the better.
<q>Wherefore as we tye vines and tender sprigs to strong stakes in the ground, to hold them vpright; so if men did know, how weak and vnconstant they are by nature, they would easily see, that nothing can be more for their soules saluation, then to fasten to God this wil of theirs so frayle and pliable, and settle it by promise of Vow perpetually in his ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uice.</q>
We reade in Genesis, that <hi>Isaac</hi> was bound when he was to be sacri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficed; and doubtles he was willing to it;<note place="margin">
                     <hi>Gen.</hi> 22.</note> otherwise it could not haue been done, his father being an old man, and <hi>Isaac</hi> in the prime of his youth and strength. Wherefore seing he was so willing, as his consenting thervnto doth testifye; what was the reason, why the father<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> thought it fit to bind the sonne, or the sonne would haue himself bound? Doubtles to the end his good wil being bound in the same bonds his hands were, it might not afterward withdraw itself vpon anie trouble or chance that might happen. Wherefore it was not out of feare, but out of courage; neither was his wil therefore the colder, but the more constant, and so very resolute, as to prouide, that he might euer haue the same wil, and neuer be able to contra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rie it.</p>

               <p n="8">8. But to establish this doctrine of the benefit of Vowes vncontroulably, we must take away the errour of some ignorant people,<note place="margin">A vow doth make the act more voluntarie;</note> who think that a Vow taketh from the dignitie and worth of a good deed; because if a thing be done without Vow, it is voluntarily done; if by Vow, it is necesarie. But they mistake the name of necessitie; and doe not reflect, that there is a na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tural necessitie, and a voluntarie necessitie: natural necessitie barreth free<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome and power to choose,<note place="margin">And more merito<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rious.</note> such as is in a stone, or in a beast; and nothing which is done after this manner, can deserue reward or commendation; the same is, when by outward violence a man is compelled to doe anie thing. But the necessitie which ariseth of an obligation voluntarily vndergone, doth not lessen the merit of the work, but encrease it; for both the work is voluntarie, and also the obligation, being entred and continued vpon a set wil and purpose. What shal we say then, if a man repent him of his Vow; and be vnwilling to performe it? In this case, the distinction which <hi>S. Thomas</hi> giueth,<note place="margin">S. <hi>Thomas. Op.</hi> 18 <hi>c.</hi> 12.</note> must take place; to wit, that the matter of the Vow may be distasteful to vs, and yet the Vow please vs; as if a man haue made a vow that he wil fast; and fasting begins to be troublesome and irksome vnto him, and consequently he fasts vnwillingly and with trouble of mind; and yet because his vow binds him, he will fast; this is enough not only to make that he doe not sinne; but merit more then if he fasted with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out vow. Which <hi>S. Anselme</hi> doth illustrate with this example:<note place="margin">

                  <q>Oftimes (sayth he) we see, that if a man be to be out, he will haue himself first bound, and protests besids, that he wil not be vnbound, though he should desire it; wherefore if it happen afterwards, that ouercome with payne he crye out to be vnbound, the Chyrurgian goeth on, til the cure be done, and then the Patient himself is glad, that they did not giue eare vnto him; and his cutting cures him, though he was then vnwil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling to abide it; but indeed, when he cryed out, he repined not at the cure, but at the sharpnes therof. In like manner, when a man in the beginning doth willingly put his neck vnder the yoak of Religion, and wil be vnder another to be cured by him, if afterwards he meete with anie thing from which his wil hath auersion, he abides it, because he is bound; and that verie medicine doth him good, though it be taken with not so good a wil; and it giues him health, which he would haue refused, if he had been free; and when his sicknes is gone, he is glad he could doe no other.</q>

<q>It is very true (sayth he) that they dye among them, for their bodies are not immortal; but they doe not make account, tha: death is death. They sing Hymnes when anie doe departe; and they cal it not a buryal, but a pompe, or procession, and a sending of one of their companie before them; yea they dare not say, the man is dead, but consummate. Therefore they giue thanks, and glorie, and reioyce, euerie one desiring the like passage, to leaue the field in the same manner, to rest from their labour and toile, to see Christ. And when they are sick, their wife doth not stand by, with her hayre in her eyes, not their litle children lamenting the want which they shal shortly find of their parents; nor their seruants wearying them at the last gasp with their vntimelie requests, to leaue them commended to some bodie after death: but free from al these rubbes, their soule is wholy bent vpon this one thought, how it may giue-vp the last breath to God, in greater grace.</q>

But of this losse also, they haue but litle feeling; for Religion doth so accustome the mind to leaue the bodie, that euen while it is in the bodie, it is for the most part out of it, busie in the loue of God, &amp; the desire of heauenlie things. For as th<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

contrariwise, they that liue chast and intire, and curbe the flesh, and bring it vnder, and withal busie their mind in holie exercises, and settle it vpon spiri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tual things, are not much molested by the corruption of the bodie, but rather, as <hi>S.

                  <hi>their conuersation is in heauen</hi>; And consequently death being nothing but a separation of the bodie from the soule (which Religious people doe practise al their life) they are not to begin to dye, when the soule is departing, but they went about it long before, and were alwayes dying; by which meanes they are not troubled at the time of death, as if they were to abide some hard and vnwonted thing. It helpeth also, that they parte not with a life, that hath manie things to hold them with delight in it (which is one of the chiefest causes, why people loue this life) but rather a life, wherin they suffer manie incommodities by pouertie, watching, and paynes-taking, much mortification of their senses and wil, which are as so manie spurres quickning our soules to desire more ardently eternal rest, and more cheerfully to embrace it,<note place="margin">A Reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gious man's life is a continual preparatio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> for death.</note> when it is at hand.

For first it belongeth to the goodnes of God, not to leaue him at his death, vpon whom in his life-time he heaped so manie great guifts and graces; somewhat also it belongeth to his Iustice, to defend and protect him, that, during life, serued him, and fought for his honour.

Not a ful moneth after, he fel into a burning feauer, which brought death into his face, but yet was alwayes wonderful chearful, and shewed it in his speaches and countenance, and in whatsoeuer he did, thinking he could neuer thank God enough, that he dyed in Religion. When he began to draw on, his Bre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thren flocked into the roome where he lay, and seing them he cryed out: O glorious death attended by so manie Angels! And expressing exceeding ioy, he sayd further; Doe you not see, doe you not see the Angels? And calling vpon<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> is good Angel, he spake with him for a while, as if he had beheld him with his eyes; and related, that he told him, he should passe through Purga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>torie, but not stay long there. Whervpon one asked him, in what shape he saw his Angel, and he pointed at a youth that stood by, and sayd: He was like him. Soone after, his soule was so ouerioyed, that his bodie did as it were leape vpon the bed, as he lay, weakned, as he was, with a deadlie sicknes, to the great admiration of the standers by, who had neuer seen the like; and tur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning his eyes back to the beds head, with chearful countenance, and mutte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring something which could not be vnderstood, he shewed, that he saw some<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing that did giue him great contentment; amidst wherof suddenly stopping, he gaue vp the ghost, as if he had layd himself downe to sleepe. What can be more happie, or more desireful, then such a death? Or who is there, that, were he to choose, had not rather dye such a death, then as Princes are wont to dye in their Royal pallaces, in their Beds-of-state, in their silks and purple garments, amidst their seruants and retinue? And certainly, this yong man being but a Nouice, came not to so sweet an end, and so, easie a combat with the enemie, and so happie a passage out of this life, by long exercise of vertue, and strong habits therof; but if anie cause can be giuen therof, it must needs be the force of Religion itself, and the grace of God chiefly-bestowed vpon him in that plentie, in regard of Religion; so that by this one example we may euidently see, how farre more securely and more sweetly this last act of warfare (as <hi>Iob</hi> doth cal it) is shut-vp in a Religious state.</p>

For this act is not doubtful, obscure, or hidden, but plaine and manifest to be seen with our verie cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poral eyes, that possibly the fact cannot be questioned, nor the reward, if we sayle not in our intention, and perseuer therin to the end.</p>

<q>Wherefore being once at his prayers, commending this his Familie with great earnestnes to God, our Sauiour is sayd to haue spoken to him these comfortable words: <hi>Francis,</hi> why dost thou trouble and vexe thyself, when anie of thy Friars doe leaue their Order, or commit anie scandalous thing in it? Dost thou take thyself to be sole gouernour of this flock, and that I am not also gouernour of it, higher then thou?

Wherefore it must needs be a special com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moditie of Religion; that it is thus particularly guarded and protected by Almightie God, from whose wisdome and knowledge nothing can be hidden, whose infinit power nothing can withstand; so that those whom he doth vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dertake to protect,<note place="margin">Reasons, why God hath par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticular <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

               <p n="3">3. Another cause may be the encrease of his glorie, which by euerie Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligious Order is greatly laboured and effected. For as a gardener takes care of his vines and fruit-trees; and a shepheard of his flock, and shrinketh not for heate or cold, or anie toylesome labour, in regard of the commoditie he reapes therof: so God hath a prouident care of these his flocks, not only out of his infinit goodnes and meere mercie, but (if a bodie may be so bold to say so) for respect of some commoditie; and why may we not say so, seing <hi>S.

He thought it little to say, <hi>he toucheth me</hi>; but nameth that part of man which is dearest to euerie one, and most sensible; which though it be spoken of euerie bodie that serues God sincerely, yet particularly it sutes best with Religious people; in re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gard they are more diligent and more exact in his seruice, and employ themselues and their whole strength and power in that alone.</p>
               <p n="5">5. A fourth reason is in a manner proper only to Religious people. For we find euerie-where, that God is wont to take particular charge and care of those, that are most destitute of humane help. So the Psal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mist speaketh of him:<note place="margin">

First therefore God hath care of the soules of his seruants, aduancing them in Vertue, and not suffering them to be tempted aboue their strength, but euen when he doth permit them to be tempted giuing them grace, that they may haue the vpper hand to their greater glorie, finally, as a diligent maister labours by al meanes to aduance the schollar, whom he loues, in matter of learning: so God seeketh with al dili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gence and care to put his disciples forward in spirit; that we may truly say of them,<note place="margin">
                     <hi>Ps.</hi> 93.12.</note> as it is in the Psalme: <hi>Blessed is the man, whom thou, ô Lord, dost instinct, and teach him thy law.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="7">7. And that he hath such care ouer our soules, wil appeare the more, by the care which he hath ouer our bodies. For if he doe so diligently and louing<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly prouide for our bodies, which are of so base a substance, we may easily vnderstand, how careful he wil be of our soule and spirit. And certainly so it is, that no father euer bestowed so much care in bringing-vp the children. begotten of his bodie, and in maintayning them, as God doth in maintayning Religious people. Our Sauiour hath giuen vs testimonie heerof in the care which he had of the multitude, that followed him in the Desert; for behol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding them he sayd:<note place="margin">

We find vpon record, that when the ancient &amp; noble Order of the Char<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terhouse-Monks was first founded in <hi>Grenold,</hi> manie things were obiected against that holie Institute, by instigation of the Diuel, specially at the time that <hi>S.

On the one side, the extreme hardnes of that kind of life was represented vnto them, the hideousnes of the place they were seated in, it being very solitarie, &amp; that they were but few, which of itself is irksome and tedious, On the other side the spirit of God had taken root in their harts, and the eminent men, who, as so manie starres, were their guides, and the fearful end of the Doctour of <hi>Paris,</hi> made great impression in them. And while they were thu<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

Whervpon making no doubt but that the old man was S. Peter the Apostle, they presently by common consent and agreement chose our Blessed Ladie for their particular Patronesse and Aduocate; and we may plainly see by the euent, how faithfully she hath performed her promise. For they haue not only perseuered til this day in

that solitarie place, but made it very famous, and from thence forward encreased euer in number and opinion of sanctitie.</p>
               <p n="5">5. We may say the same of the <hi>Cistercian Monks,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">The Cis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tercian Order.</note> the Founders of which Order were two: <hi>S. Robert,</hi> that began it, and <hi>S.

Bernard,</hi> or heard anie thing of him, can make no doubt, but his Order was exceedingly fauoured by the Blessed Virgin, were it but for his owne liuing in it, that was so great a Fauorit of hers; and being such, was placed by her in that Order. <hi>S. Robert</hi> (Founder, as I sayd, of that Order) was ordayned by the Mother of God for that course of life, before he was borne. For we find, that she appeared to his mother, while she went with child of him, and holding a gold-ring in her hand, spake thus vnto her: <hi>Engardis</hi> (For so was her name) <hi>I wil espouse the boy thou goest with, to mysel<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

For the Espousals were his Entring into Religion,<note place="margin">The Car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>melit-Friars.</note> and his Vow of Chastitie the ring. Of the <hi>Carmelit-Friars</hi> we reade, that while they were petitioning Pope <hi>Honorius</hi> the Fourth to confirme their Institute, our Blessed Ladie appeared vnto him in the night-time, and bad him entertaine the petitioners and their petition fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uourably, and yeald to their request.</p>
               <p n="6">6. The Order of the <hi>Seruites</hi> is principally dedicated to the seruice of our Blessed Ladie,<note place="margin">The Serui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tes</note> and beareth her name. Their beginning was thus: They were a kind of Sodalitie or Congregation gathered togeather in her honour. In one of their meetings vpon the feast of her Assumption, while they were at their prayers, moued by a voice from heauen, they al forsooke the world, and vowed themselues to the seruice of God, and particularly of our Blessed Ladie, in the manner they had already begun; and are called <hi>Seruites,</hi> as it were, her special seruants. Some seauen yeares after our B. Ladie appeared to euerie one of them seuerally in the night, accompanied with a great and glorious troup of Angels; she had in one hand a russet Habit, in the other a Booke open, commanding them euer after to weare that Habit vnder that Rule, which she sayd was <hi>S.

Francis</hi> togeather, is more memorable then anie of the rest. While he was one night in his prayers in S. Peter's Church in <hi>Rome,</hi> at the time when he was framing in his mind such a course of life, he thought he saw the Heauens open, and that Christ our Sauiour with an angrie &amp; firie countenance stood vp, threatning the world with three darts that he had in his ha<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>d, the one, to destroy the proude; the couetous people, with the other<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> &amp; those that were lasciuiously giue<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, with the third: &amp; no bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>die did oppose himself against his wrath; only the B.V.

with his pretious bloud. And when Christ made answer, that Iustice required, that so great offences should be no longer left vnpunished, she replied, that she had some of her seruants, that would willingly bestow their labour to reclaime the people, and bring them to pennance. Our Sauiour appeased with her speeches, desired to see them; and she brought forth S. <hi>Dominick</hi> himself (that saw the Vision) and S. <hi>Francis.</hi> S. <hi>Dominick</hi> had neuer seen S. <hi>Francis</hi> before; yet meeting him by chance the next day, he knew him by that which he had seen the night before, and embraced him with much affection, as his brother and companion in so great a work; and related vnto him, what he had seen. And they often found by the effects her special fauour towards them, and particularly in Pope <hi>In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nocentius</hi> the Fourth his time. This Pope was, I know not vpon what ground, auerted from them, and had by his Breues restrayned them of their Faculties and priuiledges.

Are not therefore they most miserable, that neglecting a supper so plentifully furnished with al that can be desired, cast themselues wittingly vpon so manie mischiefs? In my opinion they are not only most wretchedly miserable, but errant fooles, that being so louingly and freely inuited to this Royal ban<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ket, prepared for them without anie labour or cost of theirs, wil rather
<pb n="184" facs="tcp:15193:99"/>
buy such a farme, at so deare a rate. And what must it cost them, but a continual slauerie, an infinit care, solicitude, and manie sorrowes, which is dearer then gold or siluer, these being external, the other internal, which goe to our very hart?</p>
               <p n="3">3. Now let vs consider on the other side, the quiet and peaceablenes of a Religious life,<note place="margin">The banc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quet of Religion.</note> free from ambition, fitly expressed in the Parable of a great supper or bancket. For in a great bancket three things doe concurre: Rest, in sitting downe at board; delight, in plentiful feeding; and pleasure, in con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uersation with good companie. What greater quiet of mind can anie bodie haue, then a Religious man, that hath forsaken al, and desireth nothing in the world,<note place="margin">Rom. 8.38.</note> but contents himself in God, from whom <hi>he is certain,</hi> as the Apostle speaketh, <hi>that neither things present, nor things to come, can seuer him?</hi> What food can be more delightful, then the contemplation of heauenlie things, which infinitly please the palate of the soule? What butchers-meate, or fowle, or delicate sauce, can be compared with the dainties which from the heauenlie bancket of the Blessed, do befal vs? Which are yet made more sweet, by the sweetnes of the companie of so manie of our Brethren and co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>panions as meete togeather at the bancket. For as al meeting of good companie togeather is na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turally delightful, much more the assemblie of so manie vertuous men so neerly linked to one another. This is the bancket prepared for Religious men, and their whole life time is a bancket,<note place="margin">Prou. 15.15.</note> because as the Wiseman sayth, <hi>A safe conscience is a continual bancket.</hi> They liue without danger and anxious feare, and with out thought of anie hard and troublesome busines, as in al banckets that which is anie way troublesome, is of purpose layd aside. So that the to<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

A miserable occupation: and to speake the truth, a base kind of people, that set their thoughts so wholy vpon so base a thing; and are therefore iustly compared by our Sauiour to them, that bought oxen for tillage, which is the meanest trade of life among the rest.

And the dangers of sinne are so manie, in buying, and selling, and trafficking, that it is very hard to trade in anie thing without sinne, specially if once a man be possessed with the greedie desire of gayne.

Religious men passe by a bridge, which is both a shorter, and an easier, and a safer cut. Finally Secular people that haue entred vpon marriage, and earthlie possessions, passe neither by bridge, nor shipboard, but wade quite through</hi>; a dangerous and difficult passage (sayth he) not minding which way they may best get through. It is euident, that it is dan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gerous, because we see manie perish in it to our grief, and so few to get through as they ought; and it is very hard, specially in these dayes, when malice is growne so strong, amidst so manie billowes of this world, to shunne the downefals of vice, and the manie pits of mortal sinnes.

Wherfore, seeing no man can be so blind, but that he must needs acknow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge that a Religious state is farre safer, and neerer to eternal saluation, then the state of a Bishop, let vs consider how the case stands concerning the perfec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of them both: Both of them professe perfection, but not after one and the same manner. The dignitie of a Bishop requireth that the man be actually pos<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sessed, and grounded in perfection; for Bishops are Successours to the Apostles; and consequently their office and function is a spiritual Maistrie; one of the Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stles professing as much of himself in these words:<note place="margin">1. <hi>Tim.</hi> 2.7.</note>

The state of Religion requireth not perfection, but leadeth a man vnto it; it is the schoole wherein perfection is learned by little and little, partly by hearing them that teach it, partly by pra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctise therof Wherfore Diuines do tearme the one a state of perfection already acquired, the other a state of perfection to be acquired: as wherin no man of ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cessitie must presently be perfect, but it is sufficient if he aspire vnto it, and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deauour by little and little to become perfect.<note place="margin">

Thomas</hi> very learnedly doth gather this self same difference betwixt the two States, out of the words of our Sauiour; for wishing a certaine young man to embrace the counsel of Pouertie, he sheweth by the manner of speech which he held with him, that he was not yet perfect, but should be, if he followed his councel: <hi>If thou wilt be perfect, go sel al.</hi> But being to ordaine a Prelate,<note place="margin">

                  </note> to giue vs to vnderstand that whosoeuer is placed ouer others, must loue God aboue al things that concerne himself, aboue anie friend of his owne, aboue himself. Finally (to the end that the words sounding alike, make vs
<pb n="197" facs="tcp:15193:105"/>
not mistake the matter) both these States are perfect, and the State of a Bishop is in no smal degree the more perfect of the two, yet so, as the State of a Bishop requireth perfection, and yealdeth it not, the State of Religion, yealdeth perfec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, and yet requireth not altogeather so much.</p>
               <p n="4">4. The State of a Prelate differeth also from a Religious State,<note place="margin">The da<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ger of a Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>late in res<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pect of the honour which he hath.</note> in regard that riches, and honour, and temporal goods attend vpon the State of a Prelate, their dignitie is eminent in the sight of men, they are reuerenced and respected by al: whervpon most commonly it followeth, that their mind is carried away with the desire of these outward things, more then with desire of pleasing God, and ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uing him, and though they come to their dignitie with great perfection, yet lying open to so manie, and so violent assaults, it is half a miracle if they hold their perfection long,<note place="margin">
                     <hi>S. Greg</hi> 1. <hi>Pas. c.</hi> 9.</note> and a rare thing to see them hold it.
For as <hi>S. Gregorie</hi> sayth in his Pastoral:<q> most commonly, amidst the occupations of gouernment the verie vse of good works is lost, which in tranquillitie we held, because while the sea is calme, euerie vnskilful mariner is able enough to steere the ship, but when it is troubled with surging waues, a skilful Pilot is easily confounded. And what is the power of dignitie, but a tempest of the mind, wherin the ship of our hart beaten continually with the stormes of our thoughts, and wasted hither and thither without intermission, at last by suddaine excesse of desire and deed, doth as it were split it self by the way vpon the rocks?</q>
And this is the case of a Prelate.
Now with a Religious man it fareth quite otherwise, for pouertie and humilitie, and the denial of our owne wil, wayting continually vpon this State, no man can desire or embrace it, but vpon the motiue of attayning perfection; and it lyeth not open to so continual and so dangerous combats: whervpon <hi>S. Iohn Chrysostome,</hi> hauing in his books of Priest-hood, discoursed at large of the snares and dangers which attend vpon the dignitie of a Bishop,<note place="margin">

                  </note> entreth at last into a comparison therof, with the quiet retirednes of a Religious life, free from al these cares and troubles, and sayth: <q>that though sometimes some absurd thought may obtrude some such thing to a Religious man, yet the suggestion is so weake and infirme, that he presently puts it away with ease, because there is no outward matter whervpon the flame of that thought may fixe it self. And a Monke takes thought for himself alone, or if he must sometimes haue care of others of his owne coate, it is not very troublesome vnto him, being neither tyed to wife nor children, and hauing al his subiects daily before his eyes, wherby he may easily espie their faults,<note place="margin">Pouertie the ea<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="2 letters">

This is the sense of <hi>S. Iohn Chrysostome</hi>: whervnto we may adde, that though Euangelical pouertie (as else<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>where I shal declare more at large) be not perfection, but a meanes to perfec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, and such as it cannot be denyed, but that we may come to perfection by other means also, yet it is so easie and compendious a way vnto it, that no way can be more readie and certaine. Besides that, it carrieth a kind of grace and Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iestie with it, specially since it hath bean sanctified in the person of our Sauiour, insomuch, that they that want it, though inwardly they be abundantly quali<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fied with manie rare parts, yet they want a kind of outward glosse and compli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of perfection.</p>

               <p n="8">8. By which words of <hi>S.

They therefore that liue a solitarie life fal often into such like errours; because they haue no means to try themselues, and bring their vertue to the touch-stone.

Yet if the things that are so smal in bulke, and quantitie, were in price and value any great matter; a man might giue some reason, why they should be desired; but if we enter into the very bowels of them, and consider wherof they are made, we shall finde that they are composed of the knowne ele<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments, wherof some are more suttle and cleare, as fire and ayre; some more grosse and foggy, as water and earth. Whatsoeuer we see, or handle, or take contentment in, is but a compound of these fower things put togither, and in al of them, the earth, which is the most lumpish, and base of any of the rest, hath the greatest part by farre. In the mixture therfore of these things, can there be any thing so very much to be admired, seeing the simples by themselues are so meane? Or what sence is there in it, to make so great account of a little earth, and to keepe it so charily, vnder so many locks, and keyes, if it haue a co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lour which pleaseth your eye; and to tread the same earth vnder foote, and make account of it, as it is, when mingled with water it is but dirt? For that which <hi>S. Bernard</hi> sayth,<note place="margin">S <hi>Bernard ser.</hi> 4. <hi>de Aduent.</hi> S <hi>Iohn Chrysosto. ser.</hi> 2. <hi>de vit. Dom.</hi>

And long before <hi>Saint Bernard,</hi> Saint <hi>Iohn Chrysostome</hi> made the like obseruation. And he sayth wel, that it is not made, but esteemed pretious; because the iudgment of man, when it fall's to be according to truth, can neyther rayse, nor pul downe the price nor true value of any thing; much lesse a false and erroneous persuasion, which peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple frame to themselues.</p>

<q>Therefore when they rise and grow, the faster they grow in being, the more hast they make not to be: for so their measure.</q> And giues a solide and very plaine reason, why their measure and fashion is so, because euery particular thing, being parte of the whole vniuerse, and the whole, being a compund of things part, and things to come; some things must needs giue way that other may haue place, and so the whole successiuely be made vp: for as when a man vttereth a speach, wee cannot vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derstand it all, vnlesse the former syllables and wordes passe, and others, and others come successiuely after them, so if things were permanent in this world, they would hinder the rest that are still to come after, &amp; the whole, would not be compleate in all parts.

They part not with few things onely, or with many (which yet were very com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mendable, and much to be admired) but they forsake al, they bereaue themselues of euery kind of thing, and that for euer.</p>

<q>But they that haue vnder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taken to possesse nothing are worthyly much more to be admited, because the esteeme in which riches are held, could take no hould of them, nor bring them to intangle their minde in such idle cares. For though there be many thinges in this world pleasing to sense, which easily entice a man vnto them, yet riches are much more forcible in this kinde, because they are so vsefull both for attayning of honour and pleasure; and because long custome hath taught fooles to account them happy that are rich, in regard of the glory and pleasure they liue in. They therfore are worthyly to be esteemed rare men, that striuing with themselues, haue ouercome the thoughts of their minde, mouing them to yeild to the opi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion, which the vulgar hath of riches, as if they were truly good, and which in the iudgment of all men are thought to be of high esteeme.</q> These are the very wordes of <hi>Nilus.</hi>

One kinde of pouerty retaineth absolutly nothing at al, neither in priuate, nor in common: Which is the profession, which first of al <hi>S.

The other kind of pouerty re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taineth possession, of certaine necessarie reuenues in common only, nothing in priuate: which is that, which al the ancient Fathers professed: <hi>S. Benedict, Saint Bernard, S. Bruno</hi> and <hi>S. Basil,</hi> the most ancient of al the rest: for their Monasteries were not only indowed, with yearely rents, but with such ample possessions, as the remaynder of them doth testifie their greatnes to this day.<note place="margin">

Kings and princes did take a glorie in buylding great Monasteries, in the lands belonging to their crowne and patrimonie, and in bestowing vpon them, very large possessions. And if any wealthy persons did enter into any of those religious orders (as there were very many that did) they caried their wealth in with them, and no body sayd nay, no body repined, or sued them vpon it, but did rather willingly yeald them al fauour, and furtherance.</p>

But to say nothing of many others, the only possessions of this <hi>Placidus</hi> were so large, that he alone was Maister of great part of Sicilie, besids other things which he had: which is testified to this day by the Register of them yet extant, which is able to amaze the reader with the only length therof.

<q>It procedeth not from the body to the soule; but being properly in the soule, by the integrity therof, a thing most pretious, our bodies also are preserued intire. The soule receauing impression from the true Good, and from the desire therof, is lifted vp to that Good, by the holines of Chastity, as by a forcible wing, and so endeauouring to serue and please the like with the like, that is, the incorruptible God, with purity incorruptible, it leadeth the integrity of the body, as a handmaid, to the seruice of the se<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

What can be sayd more honourable, or expresse more clearly the dignity of Chastity, then that from this dust and dirt of ours, it raiseth vs to the ranke of Angels, and not Angels only, but to the likenes and similitude of God himself? what wil take a man with admiration, if this do not? what dignity wil not iustly seeme base and sordide, compared with this heauenly honour?

Others compare the contrary inticements to a flame of fire, which alwayes leaueth some mark behind it, greater or lesser, according as the flame doth continue. Nothing therfore can be worse for Chastity, then to leaue it in a place, where it may come by many rubbs and assaults, such as the world is.

                  <seg rend="decorInit">I</seg>T followeth that we speake something in brief, of the dignitie of Obedience; which though we should be lesse capable to vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derstand by other meanes, the example and iudgement of our Lord and Sauiour Christ may be a sufficient testimonie of it; finding, as we do, that he did so highly esteeme of it. For as a man, that hath no skil in iewels and pretious stones, if he see another, that is skilful, buy a stone at a high rate, and after he hath bought it, be very cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rie of it, and set greatly by it, cannot choose but think it was worth his mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ney: so in weighing the deserts of whatsoeuer vertue, but chiefly of this of Obedience, we must not rule our selues so much by reason, as by the example of him, who, as we know, was Wisdome itself, and could not mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stake or be ignorant of what he did.<note place="margin">Christ our Sauiour valued obedience at a high rate. <hi>Io.</hi> 6.38. <hi>Philip</hi> 2.8.</note> Now that he did value Obedience at a very high rate, is euident, because whatsoeuer he did, or sayd, or proiected in his life-time, though al other vertues had a part in it, is notwithstanding in a manner wholy ascribed to Obedience. For of himself he sayth, <hi>that he came downe from heauen, not to do his owne wil, but the wil of his Father that sent him.</hi> And <hi>S. Paul</hi> ascribeth his whole life and death, and the particular manner of his death, wholy to Obedience; <hi>He was made obedient to death, yea the death of the Crosse.</hi> Finally <hi>S. Bernard</hi> affirmeth,<note place="margin">
                     <hi>S. Bernard in Cant. ser.</hi> 46.</note> that he preferred Obedience before his life, choosing rather to die, then not to obey. Obedience ther<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore must needs be a great vertue, or rather there is something diuine, and more then vertue in it; seing the Sonne of God, the sampler of perfection, he that came of purpose to put vs into the way of perfection, did himself so seriously practice it, and commended it to vs, to be no lesse seriously obserued by vs.<note place="margin">

                  <hi>S. Thomas</hi> doth giue this manifest reason of the impor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance and excellencie of it; <q>for as, <hi>sayth he,</hi> in natural things it was necessarie, that the things which are higher, should moue the inferiour by the abundance of natural vertues instilled by God into them; so in humane gouernment, good order did require, that one should direct another, by force of authoritie and power communicated by God; which direction depending of reason and wil, is not executed but by precept and command. Wherein, <hi>as the same Saint affirmeth,</hi> as the rule of our actions is no humane thing, but the first rule of al is the Diuine Wil, gouerning and ru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling al other wils, whereof one is more neere vnto him then another, according to the order which God himself hath instituted.</q> Which discourse of S. <hi>Thomas</hi> doth clearly discouer vnto vs the noblenesse of Obedience, because it conioyneth our wil and iudgement intirely with God; in which coniunction al perfection of men and Angels doth consist.
For neither almes-deeds, nor preaching of the word of God, nor what<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>soeuer

austeritie (and why should I stand to reckon vp al particulars?) Mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tyrdome itself is of no esteeme nor merit, vnlesse it haue relation to the performance of the Wil of God.<note place="margin">A compa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rison be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween Cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritie and Obedie<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ce.</note> Wherefore, as Charitie is vsually called the Queene of Vertues, Obedience certainly is the next vnto it, and resem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bleth it very much in al things; for both of them conioyne vs with God; both of them make vs to accept or refuse that, which God desireth or refu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>seth: The difference is, that Charitie worketh in nature of a friend, Obe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dience in nature of a subiect; so that, though the manner be different the thing is the same, and the profit no lesse of the one then of the other; and in it we see the excellencie of Obedience, whereof we speake, in regard that going through al our actions, it directeth them by a rule Diuine, to wit, by the self-same rule, wherewith the actions of God himself are directed. And what dignitie can be greater in anie creature? Vpon which ground, Diuines do stile Obedience the forme or sampler of other vertues, because the actions of al other vertues do ayme at nothing els, but to performe the commands of God.</p>
               <p n="3">
                  <note place="margin">It runneth through al.</note>3. Whereunto we may adde another excellencie, to wit, that though it be a peculiar vertue by itself, yet it hath a general extent to al things, compre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hending whatsoeuer may happen in the life of man. For whosoeuer giueth himself wholy ouer, and subiected himself wholy to another man, reserueth nothing at al, neither place, nor worke, nor any employment, neither out<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward nor inward busines. So that, whether he be in action or out of action<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> whether he remayne stil in a place, or be vpon going; whether he vndertake, or leaue, or alter from this busines or the other; whether the matter be great or smal, he is absolutely obliged in al things, &amp; true Obedience taketh hold, &amp; seasoneth and perfecteth al.<note place="margin">And com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prehen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deth al vertues.</note> And moreouer al vertues concurre in it, and, as it were, attend vpon it, to the perfecting of a most admirable peece of worke, compounded of many gemmes and pretious stones. For no man can euer sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iect himself wholy to another man, vnlesse he be first greatly inflamed with the loue of God, and haue placed his whole trust and confidence vpon him; he must also haue great and profound humilitie, patience, fortitude, constan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cie, and al other vertues; for if Obedience want anie of them, it wil quickly beginne to halte, and suddainly fayle, and fal to the ground.</p>
               <p n="4">4. But nothing doth shew the excellencie of this Vertue more, then the consideration of the matter, to which it doth extend itself; which al Maisters of Spirit assigne to be threefold.<note place="margin">Three de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gree of O<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>bedience.</note> First, al outward things commanded by Su<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>periours, the execution whereof belongeth to Obedience; which is the lowest and least part of Obedience, and of itself very imperfect, and if nothing els concurre with it, it is but such as slaues and brute beasts haue, which are ruled by outward force, but their wil doth not concurre therunto. The second degree therefore is a step higher, and comprehendeth the wil, which as S. <hi>Gregorie</hi> speaketh,<note place="margin">S <hi>Greg.</hi> 35. <hi>Moral. c.</hi> 10.</note> 
                  <hi>is killed and sacrificed by Obedience</hi>: For the wil of the subiect conspiring with the wil of his Superiour, they are both perfectly conioyned togeather, or rather the subiect wholy casting off and rooting out his owne wil, hath the wil of the Superiour fully ingrafted in him, and is moued and wealded by it euery way, as if it were his owne. The
<pb n="227" facs="tcp:15193:128"/>
third and highest degree of this Vertue, is to subiect also our reason and iudgement to the iudgement of our Superiours; and not only to wil, but to think the self same thing with them, and esteeme it right, reaso<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nable, and profitable, whatsoeuer they shal ordaine; in a word, that their onlie beck beare such an authoritie in our minde, that vnlesse it be apparently contrarie to the knowne commandment of God, their iudgement and opinion do wholy swey ours, and lead it captiue af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter it.</p>
               <p n="5">5. This is,<note place="margin">Obedience a guift pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sented to God.</note> as it were, the feature and beautiful countenance of Obe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dience, which if men could behold with their corporal eyes, they would be greatly inflamed with the comelie sight and noble aspect therof. Obe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dience also is a guift presented to the Diuine Maiestie; wherefore looke how much the thing which is presented, is iustly to be valued, so much is Obedience to be prized. Now what hath man more worthie or more deare vnto him, then reason and wil? For to be a man, he must haue them both, and consequently loue them as much as he loues himself. For if naturally we loue our flesh and bone, and the least parcel of them, so dearely, that to preserue them we wil take any paines; what affection must we needes haue to those higher parts, parts more noble, and more essential to the nature of man? and so we find, that nothing is more natural to vs, then to preserue not only the powers of our wil and vnderstanding, but the verie vse and actions of them. The proper act of our wil, is libertie; the proper act of our vnderstanding, is to passe our iudgement vpon a thing. Wherefore euerie man doth so naturally and so violently desire to haue his owne saying, and his owne wil, in euerie thing: which is more apparent, when (as oftentimes it hapneth) the thing itself is but a trifle; but it pleaseth vs to haue it so, because we wil be free. If a thing be forbidden, the very forbidding of it doth whet our desire, for no other reason, but because, as I said, the sweetnes of libertie doth of itself delight vs. Wherefore seing these things beare such swey in vs, the difficultie must needes be the greater in breaking the violent course of them; and so much the greater, then in ouercoming anie other natural propension, by how much we are carryed towards them by a more violent current. If therefore we put al these things togeather, the greatnes of the oblation comprehending in it self so manie things; the worth of these two things, which we offer; the labour and difficultie, which is in offe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring; we shal easily vnderstand the excellencie of Religious Obedience, and how farre it doth surpasse the bounds of Nature, seing it cannot possibly be accomplished, but by perfect ouercoming and subduing Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture. In which sense <hi>S. Gregorie</hi> doth interpret that saying of the Wise<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man;<note place="margin">
                     <hi>Prou</hi> 21.28.</note>

light and beautie as the starres in presence of the Sunne. It is <hi>S. Gregorie's</hi> saying (who in my opinion, among al the holie Fathers did best vnderstand, and <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 word">

Greg. lib</hi> 6. <hi>in lib. reg. c.</hi> 2.</note> but he proueth it by holie Scripture: <hi>Better is obedience then sacrifice.</hi> You may see, saith <hi>S. Gregorie,</hi> in what height of perfection the vertue of Obedience is placed, the Prophet beholding it in a higher eleuation, then the diuine oblations. And if we wil follow the spiritual sense, Sacrifices haue relation to great austeritie of conuersation;
<q>Holocaustes to the compun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction of a retired life. Better therefore is Obedience then Sacrifice; and to harken, rather then to offer the fat of rammes: because it is of farre higher de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sert, alwayes to subiect our owne wil to the wil of another, then to pinch our bodyes by extremitie of fasting, or to kil our selues by compunction, in a more priuate Sacrifice. For what is the fat of rammes, but an inward and oylie deuotion? But yet Obedience is better, because he that hath learned perfectly to fulfil the wil of his directour, doth passe in the heauenlie Kingdome those that do fast and weep.</q>
Thus saith <hi>S. Gregorie.</hi>

Finally, in my iudgement, the greatnes of the often Miracles, which haue been wrought by Obedience, are a most certain proofe &amp; euident confirma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of the excellencie of it. For as if a man doe manie things aboue the course of Nature, we take it for a signe of great sanctitie in him; so among vertues we may vse the same argume<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t, &amp;, as I may say, canonize them the rather, &amp; esteeme them worthie of veneratio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, the more their gratefulnes to God hath been shew<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed by miracles. But who can reckon the miracles, which haue been wrought by Obedience? Al books are ful of them; especially the Liues of the ancient Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers, who haue giuen good proof to the world, how highly this vertue is to be esteemed. <hi>S. Paul,</hi>

                  </note> disciple of great <hi>S. Antonie,</hi> is much renowned for it. For as he was greater then his maister, in the power of miracles, as to whom <hi>S. Antonie</hi> was wont to send those that himself could not cure; so by <hi>S. Anthonie</hi> his owne confession there was no other cause of it, but Obedience; which he was euer wont to point at, as a patterne for others to imitate; &amp; manie notable facts of his in this kind are to be seen vpon record to this day.<note place="margin">

                  <hi>Iohn</hi> is also very famous in this kind, who being by his Abbot in ieast bid to bring a lionesse vnto him, ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king it as spoken in earnest, did not only not feare least she should fal vpon him, but following her when she fled, and crying after her in his Abbot's name to stand, tooke her, and brought her bound to the Monasterie. What shal we say of him, that by command of his Abbot cast his sonne into a burning furna<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ce, and tooke hi<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

An other <hi>Iohn</hi> for 3. yeares togeather wate<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red a dry stake euerie day, as he was commanded, and fetched his water a great way of: At last it bore greene leaues and fruit, which his Maister gathering brought to the church, and said to the Bretheren: <hi>Behold the fruit of Obedience.</hi> No lesse wonderful is that, which <hi>Climacus</hi> recordeth of a yong man called <hi>In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nocentius.</hi> This man in his life-time was much deuoted to the vertue of Obe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dience<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> and after his death and burial, being called vpon and asked whether he were dead or no, he answered with a loude voice: That the obedient man could not dye. That, which is related of <hi>S. Columbanus,</hi> is also very
<pb n="229" facs="tcp:15193:129"/>
memorable, that coming to the Monasterie of Luxouium which himself had founded; and finding almost al sick, he vsed no other physick, but called them al into the court to thresh the corne in the heat of the sunne. A hard task, especially for some of them, that were so feeble that they could hardly stand on their legs. Some of them, that thought themselues wiser and warier then the rest, kept themselues in their beds; others desirous to obey, came downe to their worke: al these were presently so perfectly cured of their disease, that they felt not so much as any grudging of it; the others punished for their slacknes and distrust, had their agues al the yeare long, as <hi>S. Columban,</hi> reprehending and blaming them, had foretold.</p>
               <p n="8">8. In the histories of the ancient Fathers we reade of an other strange acci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent, wherein also we may see what Obedience is, compared with other vertues. Two natural brethren liued in one Monasterie; one of them practi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed Obedience very much; the other gaue himself to much austeritie. This last, to try the other's sanctitie, commanded him to goe into a riuer that was ful of crocodiles; which he did without delay; and the cruel serpents came fawning vpon him, and licked his feete. Not long after they hapned both vpon a dead man's bodie, and falling ioyntly to their prayers, the man came to life: Which the Monke, that was giuen to fasting, secretly in his thoughts attributed to himself; but his Abbot chid him sharply for it, hauing vnder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stood by reuelation, that it was not his fasting, but the other's obedience that obtained it.</p>
               <p n="9">9. Such therefore is the dignitie of Obedience, as to be worthie to be declared by such extraordinarie miracles. And no wonder. For they that liue in Obedience, haue put themselues wholy into the hands of God, to be entirely possessed and gouerned by him. And consequently that, which is in the Prophet <hi>Esay,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">
                     <hi>Esay</hi> 62.3.</note> is fulfilled in them: <hi>Thou shalt be a crowne of glorie in my hand, and a kinglie diadome in the hand of thy God.</hi> From which glorie and excellentie, the commodities also doe follow, which are there mentioned: <hi>Thou shalt no longer be called the forsaken, and thy land shal be no more called desolate, but thou shalt be called: My wil in it.</hi> Which glorious name, and much more the thing it self, to whome doth it more fitly agree, then to a Religious man, who by obedience is so wholy, as I sayd, in God's pos<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>session, that the Diuine wil is in him alwayes most perfectly performed in al things? Men therefore may reioice, if they wil, in whatsoeuer other titles of honour, and be called Kings, and Princes, and Cardinals: A Religious soule hath farre more solid ground of ioy in this name, which God hath imposed, and wherein is briefly comprized al that is Good, <hi>My wil is in it.</hi>

are raysed in minde aboue it. And they forsake not only that, which they haue in present (which oftimes is but a smal matter) but the desire and greedines of hauing, which hath a great extent, or rather hath no bounds at al, but reacheth absolutly to al things. Wherefore no Religious man must think so meanely of this his oblation, as to conceaue that it is little, which he offers to God, when he barres himself by the Vow of Pouertie from possessing anie thing vpon earth: because he doth not only offer that which he had, or that which might haue befallen him, or which he might haue gotten by industrie, but absolutly the whole world. Which we learne by the example of S. <hi>Peter,</hi> who certainly left not much, yea rather that which he left, was little or nothing, and yet he did not stick to say, as we read in S. <hi>Mathew: Behold, we haue left al things.</hi> Of which profession S. <hi>Augustin</hi> writes to <hi>Paulinus</hi> that,<note place="margin">

                  <hi>S. Gregorie</hi> is of the same opinion, testifying that <hi>S. Peter</hi> and <hi>S.

This is that, which al Religious people doe; For they depriue not them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selues only of the possession of things, but cast away al desire of whatsoeuer things in the world: Which whosoeuer doth, hath the whole world vnder his feete, and consequently hath not only whereof greatly to reioice, and account himself happie in the peace, and tranquillitie, and pleasure of his mind; but is to be accounted in honour and dignitie higher then Kings and Princes, not<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>withstanding their dominions and commands;<note place="margin">

<q>This is a special token of the Elect, that they know so to walke the paths of this present life, as by certaintie of hope to discouer, when they are arriued to the high places, where they may behold al transi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>torie things beneath them, and, through the loue of Eternity, tread, what<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>soeuer is high in the world, vnder their feete. From whence it is, that God by the Prophet sayth to the soule,<note place="margin">

The heighths of the earth are Interest, flatteries of seruants and subiects, aboundance of wealth, honour, and heighth of promotion, which they, that creepe stil vpon the ground through earthlie desires, esteeme high; because they make account there is some great matter in them: but if our hart be once fixed in heauenlie things, presently it appeareth how abiect that is, which before seemed high.</q>

Gregorie</hi>; whereunto we may adde further, that as the Eagle, which is heer described, doth not only soare on high, but build also in high places: so may we say of Religious people, and apply it fitly vnto them. For as to fly, is laborious, importing a continual strife and contention, and consequently cannot be perpetual; but in the neast a bird is quiet, and setled at case; so we may obserue the like difference among men, which follow vertuous courses. For they, that by strength of consideration only and desire, rayse themselues from the earth, as manie secular people doe, certainly doe very wel; but it is, as it were, by force and strength of armes: and that which <hi>S.

The neast of a Religious man, is the state itself. And haue not then Religious people placed their neast on high, seing their state is raysed aboue al things created? In which height they containe themselues, not only without anie difficultie, but with exceeding pleasure, abhorring nothing more, then to stoope to these base things againe, which both in minde and deed they haue set at naught.</p>

And that we may the better conceaue both the great honour and profit of a minde thus seated on high, as the Scripture expresseth vnto vs in the simi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>litude afore-sayd, let vs imagin with ourselues, that we see a man raysed by degrees so high from the ground, vp into the ayre, that at last we behold him seated vpon the verie cloudes looking downe vpon vs. For by this repre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sentation, which cannot be verifyed in a bodie, we shal come to vnderstand, what may be donne, and is dayly acted, in the minde. For if a man were seated so high, as I say, vpon the cloudes, manie things were considerable in him: First, that al would admire him; secondly if he had any enemie vpon earth, he were in safetie, quite out of his reach; thirdly, these inferiour things being so farre beneath him, would not trouble his sight; manie of them he would not see at al.<note place="margin">Religious people are <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="2 letters">

<q>That no man must think it any great matter, if the Kings of the world doe at anie time, write to the seruants of God; for though they haue in outward appearance a greater power, their nature is the same; they liue and die, as others doe. The thing which is great indeed, and highly to be esteemed, is, that God hath sent letters vnto vs, that is, his Law, the fummarie of his wil, &amp; hath spoken vnto vs by his onlie Sonne Which notwithstanding, his Brethren entreating him to make them some answer, that he might not seeme to slight the courtesie of so great Princes, he writ back vnto them, exhorting them to Iustice, and Clementie, and alwayes to remember they were Men, and should one day themselues appeare in iudgement before the Tribunal of CHRIST, who is true Lord of al.</q>

               <p>
                  <seg rend="decorInit">I</seg>T is a great matter to set al earthlie things at naught; and they that doe so, are not to be ranked any more with the vulgar sort, but to be honoured as people of high degree of promotion and excellencie: Yet it is a farre greater worke, to fortake our kindred and nearest allyes in bloud. For the loue, which we beare them, is of a higher strayne, farre more intense, more natural, and more deeply rooted in vs.<note place="margin">The force of the loue of our kin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dred.</note> For what likenes, or what connexion hath a man with gold, and siluer, with lands and possessions? But with men he hath a natural af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>finitie, and specially with such as come of the same stock: which is the rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son, that the loue of parents towards their children, of children towards their parents, and of brethren among themselues, is so hard to be dissembled. And that this proceedeth not so much out of iudgement and deliberation grounded in reason, as of a natural inclination and force, we see by that which hapneth in beasts, who, to preserue their yong-ones, stick not to venture life and limme. And consequently the stronger this bond and tye is, the greater force is requi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red to breake it, and a hart more resolute, either to abide or to act this dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iunction. So that among the rest of the commendations of a Religious state, this is none of the least, that, as it rayseth a man aboue al other things, it ouer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>commeth also this natural affection, parting a man from those, with whome he was bred and borne; and bringing him, for the loue of our Sauiour, to enter league with others, whome he neuer saw; and to take more pleasure in liuing with them, then with his owne natural kindred: which is an euident argument, that this manner of calling is farre aboue the reach of Nature. For if we see a father of manie children oftimes lament and grieue so bitterly for the losse of some one among them, though the rest of his familie and stocke be sound and safe; what grief should theirs, if we speake of nature, be, who leese al at once, parents, brethren, sisters, friends, domesticals, and al that nature or custome and familiar acquaintance had linked them so long &amp; so deeply vnto? It is not nature therfore, that worketh this strange effect, but it is abundant grace from Heauen, and plentie of vertue and infused from aboue.</p>

And so we find in the Ghospel, that our Sauiour doth challenge it as one of his greatest works. <hi>I came not,</hi> sayth he, <hi>to send peace, but the sword. For I came to seuer man against his father, and the daughter-in-law against her mother-in-law.</hi> And it is not without great consideration, that he tearmeth this grace, <hi>a sword.</hi>

                     <hi>Matt.</hi> 10.31.</note> For as a sword is made of iron, and vsed to cut a-sunder things which grow fast togeather; so it giueth vs to vnderstand, that this natural tye of affinitie is very strong, and cannot be seuered but by a force as strong as iron, that is, by the mightie hand of God, drawing to himself the harts of whome he wil, and parting them from whome he wil: and daylie expe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rience doth teach vs it to be so. For how should it otherwise come to passe, that they, who before liued most dearly linked togeather in the same house, inspired

afterwards by this heauenlie Spirit, should so suddenly resolue not to yeald to flesh and bloud, but departe for euer from them, with that constant resolu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, as if they had neuer knowne them, and did nothing belong vnto them? and (which is more signal) they that remaine, weepe for him that goeth; he that goeth away, is ful of ioy and gladnes. What is the reason of it, but because euen before he parte with them, he is already cut off and seuered from them by this diuine sword; and therfore parteth without anie sense of feeling: but they that haue not felt the force of this sword, are stil linked to him, &amp; consequent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly feele much grief in parting. <hi>Theodoret</hi> recounteth of one <hi>Marcianus,</hi>

After manie yeares, his sister, who was Ladie of the Cittie where she dwelt, coming with her sonne (that was vnder age) and manie presents to the Monasterie, he would by no meanes see her; only he admitted the child, to the end he might send him home with some good instructions. And when she entreated him, that he would at least accept of the presents which she had brought, if not as he was her kins<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man, yet as one that was poore, and might haue need of them, he made her this answer: <hi>How manie monasteries of poore people did you meete by the way, before you came to me? And seing you bestowed not these presents vpon them, it is cleare you present them me for hindred sake.</hi> And so constantly he reiected them al. Which fact of his <hi>Theodoret</hi> doth so extol, that he sayth, he was a man aboue nature, fashioned after a heauenlie ma<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ner. Doubtlesse therfore this disposition of Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligious people, is one of the specialest graces, which the Holie-ghost is wont to imparte vnto vs, and requireth great strength of minde; and is also a signe of much vertue and worth in them that haue it. In so much that it is one of the chief commands, which our Lord is pleased to lay vpon the Spouse, whom he chooseth for himself,<note place="margin">

Secondly, it deliuereth our soule vnto him, that is, our Wil, our Iudgement<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> our Freedome, which is Al in al. For our soule is, as it were, the Castle in a Cittie; the key of this Castle is our libertie; so that when we deliuer our libertie vp to God, we deliuer al vnto him; and so long as it is in his hands, he is maister of al. Finally it deliuereth vp to God, the vse of al these things; which though it necessarily follow of the former, yet to make the thing more plaine, we speake of it a part. For we cannot employ our soule nor our bodie in things, which of ourselues we are inclined vnto, but in those, to which our Superiours are pleased to order vs. And this deliuerie is not a thing priuate or hidden, acted only in thought or resolution, but it is made externally, by an outward declara<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, by word of mouth, before witnesses, and in the hands of an other man, that, in place of God, accepteth the donation; in brief it is a kinde of contract, to the solemnizing and authenticating whereof, nothing is wan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting.

               <p n="4">4. Among men, slauerie and captiuitie is accounted one of the hardest and heauiest things that are, because it taketh away a man's freedome, and maketh him so subiect to an other, that he must doe al things after an other's fancie. Yet if we looke into the matter wel, that kind of ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uitude bindeth the bodie only; the minde is altogeather free: for there is no slaue but he may think his pleasure, and loue and hate what he listeth, grieue and reioyce at what he wil. But a Religious man, offering his verie soule to God, offereth also the operations of the soule; and must conforme al his inward affections to the same rule: wherupon in al Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligious Orders, the lawes and constitutions, which are set downe in wri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting, and the commands of Superiours by word of mouth, prescribe not only what is outwardly to be done or auoyded, but much more what is inwardly to be performed. So that no seruitude euer was or can be more strict then that, which Religious people vndergoe: But the more strict it is, it proues also the more pleasant; because of the infinit pleasure which is in God, who communicateth himself so much the more plentifully to his creatures, the more narrowly they binde them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selues, and the more sincerely they are subiect, vnto him. Wherefore, among other great treasures of a Religious life, we must also reckon this, that it bringeth vs wholy to forsake and cast off ourselues for euer, by so strict an obligation,<note place="margin">

<q>Others vow calues, others rammes, others their houses; the Nazarean voweth himself; this is the vow of the Nazarean, which is aboue al other vowes. Our sonne, and our daughter, and our cattle be without vs: but to offer ourselues, to employ not an other's but our owne labour, is more perfect and more eminent then al other vowes.</q>

               <p n="5">5. What is Chastitie?<note place="margin">Chastitie.</note> A mind strengthened and hardened against al manner of pleasures of the flesh; against those pleasures which do so domi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neere ouer the nature of man-kinde. How rare therefore and how glorious a thing is it, to oppose ones-self against them, and withstand them so con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stantly, and with so great a courage? The verie rarenes of this vertue doth make it the more glorious; for we see that the greatest part of al the world is lead away captiue with desire of these pleasures.</p>
               <p n="6">6. Finally, what a noble disposition of mind is Obedience?<note place="margin">Obedie<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ce.</note> importing a denial of ourselues, and a renouncing of our freedome, which naturally we desire so much in al things, &amp; in al the passages of our life; so that certainly, as we cannot ouercome ourselues in a greater matter, so there cannot be a more noble, or more glorious victorie. And consequently, as I sayd before, if there were no other vertue in Religion but these three, which are in euerie bodie's eye, the beautiful aspect therof could not but breed great admiration and loue in the beholders.</p>
               <p n="7">7. But, as I touched euen now, so fayre a building of Vertue could not long stand, if it had not other vertues to vphold it, whereof some goe before, as preparatiues; some alwayes accompanie it. And to begin with the three Theological vertues (which are so called because their obiect is God) it is euident, not only that a Religious state cannot be without Faith, but it cannot be without singular and very excellent Faith.<note place="margin">Faith.</note> For euerie Religious man doth forsake that, which he hath in his hands and before his eyes, for things which he doth not see; he leaueth the present for the future, and, which is more, for that which is not to come but after so long a distance of time, relying vpon the sole promise and word of God; which no man would doe, were he not fully perswaded, that the future is much more assured, then that which is present, which is the greatest act of Faith that a man can haue.</p>
               <p n="8">8. The like we may say of Hope,<note place="margin">Hope.</note> which consisteth in two points: First and principally in hoping the glorie of Heauen; which, though it be stil to come, Religion doth giue vs so good pledges of, as if we were ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tually in possession of it; and in regard therof, as I sayd of Faith, we forgoe whatsoeuer we had in our hands; Secondly Hope extendeth itself to the necessarie helps of this present life; which part therof, where is it more practised then in Religion? Religious people depriuing themselues of al things, which they may haue need of, and bringing themselues to a most perfect nakednes, vpon the confidence which they haue in God. So that in my opinion there cannot be a greater hope and confidence in the Pil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>grimage of this world, then this, which Religious people haue; because it extendeth itself not only to some one kind of thing, or to manie things of smal consequence, but concerneth absolutly al, and our ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rie life, with which we put God wholy in trust. Charitie is written in the verie bowels of Religion,<note place="margin">Charitie.</note> and as it were in the Essence of it, and hath three branches: The one extending itself towards God; the other towards those of the same Institute; the third towards al other men. Towards God, because doubtlesse it is the sole Loue of God, which driueth a Soule vpon such a strict course of life,
<pb n="244" facs="tcp:15193:137"/>
and the force or flame therof must needs be excessiue great, to be able to thrust out so absolutly, as it doth, al other loue of our carnal brethren, our parents and kinsfolk, of riches, and al other worldlie commodities, and finally the loue of ourselues. For it were not possible for a man to for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sake al these things for God, if he loued not God much more then anie of them. And if the beginnings of this loue be so great, and the first coulours, as I may cal them, so liuelie and beautiful; what wil be the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinual encrease therof, to which it must needs rise in time, by the daylie fun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctions of Religion, by prayer, meditation, and other vertuous exercises; the end of them al being to encrease in the loue of God.</p>
               <p n="9">9. Now whereas the streames of loue and good wil towards our neigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bour are deriued from this fountaine of the loue of God, they fal first vpon them,<note place="margin">The loue towards those of the same Institute. <hi>Arist.</hi> 1. <hi>Lib. c.</hi>
                  </note> whome God hath linked vnto vs by profession of the same Institute and course of life; who also, by reason of this nearnes, haue been alwayes wont to cal Brothers among themselues. And this loue is wholy of Cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritie. For, as Aristotle discourseth, euerie societie of men, being necessarily grounded vpon communication, in one kind or other, as the companie of sea-faring men, vpon shipping; a companie of souldiers, vpon militarie ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions; a fellowship of Students, vpon the doctrine of their Maister; a companie of Marchants,<note place="margin">The ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cellencie of the ground therof.</note> vpon money; such as the thing is, wherupon they agree, such is their followship or societie: Let vs therfore see, what is the ground, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>upon Religious people agree, and what bond tyeth them togeather. For cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainly it is not nearnes in bloud; because oftimes they are meere strangers one to another; neither is it anie ciuil contract or bargaine; in brief, if we reckon vp al, that can be reckoned, we shal find that they haue no other ground of their association, but this supernatural loue, which is Charitie. Charitie bread it; Charitie vpholds it; without Charitie it instantly faileth. And, as a little before I said of the loue of God, so this fraternal Charitie hauing so noble a ground, and, as I may cal it, so honourable a descent, it hath manie things in like manner consequent vnto it, and greatly aduancing it. And first, the likenes, which they haue among themselues; which in al things is a great encreaser of loue, and among Religious people of the same Rule and Institute is so great, that greater can hardly be in this world; for al their intentions, practises, rites, and ceremonies, &amp; their verie outward Habit and behauiour are alike; Vertue itself, which a man cannot but loue in his enemie, their daylie conuersation one: with another, continual cohabitation, finally the seruices and charitable offi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces one towards another, al proceeding of loue, must needs adde oyle to this burning flame of loue, and inflame it more and more.</p>
               <p n="10">10. The third branch of Charitie reacheth to al men. For excepting some few Institutes, which attend wholy to Contemplation (who yet by prayer and good desires help towards the saluation of others in no smal measure) al the rest are so wholy at the seruice of their neighbour, that al their thoughts and endeauours seeme to bend that way. And the employments of euery Religious familie giue sufficient testimonie, what their affection is in this kind. For not only when they appeare in publick to preach, or teach, or exhort, but when in priuate they giue themselues to studie, when they labour and watch, or performe anie other exercise of religion, al of it is
<pb n="245" facs="tcp:15193:137"/>
directed not only to their owne saluation, but for the better helping &amp; assisting of others to get Heauen. So that Religious people, as <hi>S. Paul</hi> sayd of himself, <hi>haue made themselues seruants of al men,</hi>

Al which shewes, that Charitie is intrinsecal to a Religious vocation, and, as it were, a kind of glue, to binde soules togeather among themselues, and with God; which if it faile, Religious Orders themselues must needs fal asunder, because they haue no other stay or hold.</p>

For it is by his great guift, that in so great measure we follow that great course and purpose, in which those great Apostles did glorie. Thus doth <hi>S. Bernard</hi> discourse in commendation of a Religious state, paralelling it in manie things with those three degrees of Perfection.</q>
Let vs see how in some things he doth preferre it, which is a farre greater commendation. Perhaps, <hi>saith he,</hi> if I wil glorie also in this, I shal not be vnwise; for I shal speak the truth:
<q>There be some here that haue left more then a boat and nets. And what is it, that the Apostles <hi>left al</hi> indeed but to follow our Sauiour, who was present with them? It is not for me to say what it is; we shal with more safetie heare our Sauiour himself saying: <hi>Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause thou hast seene me, Thomas, thou hast belieued; blessed are they that haue not seene, and haue belieued.</hi> Perhaps also it is a more excellent kind of Prophecie, not to attend to anie temporal thing, nor to things that with time doe perish, but to those that are spiritual and Eternal. And the treasure of Chastitie is more illustrious in a vessel of earth, and vertue in some sort more laudable in flesh that is fraile and weake. When therefore we find in this bodie of ours an Ange<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lical conuersation, in our hart a Prophetical expectation, in both an Aposto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lical perfection, what a masse of grace is there?</q> Thus spake <hi>S. Bernard</hi>; and I know not what can be said more to the honour and commendation of a Reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gious Institute.</p>
               <p n="10">10. But what do we stand heaping togeather the praises of men, when we haue the verdict of Truth it self from God's owne mouth? For of this State our Sauiour spake those words: <hi>If thou wilt be perfect, go and sel al that thou hast, and come follow me.</hi>
                  <note place="margin">
                     <hi>Matth.</hi> 19.21.</note> Where it is to be considered what our Sauiour said; and to whome. He spake to a man that was not wicked and debauched, but honest and orderlie; for he had kept the commandments of God al his life-time he had done no man no wrong; and our Sauiour beholding him, did loue him. Who would not haue thought that this man was perfect, seing he had been so careful and diligent in fulfilling the law of God? and yet our Sauiour tels him: <hi>Thou wantest yet one thing</hi>; a thing so great and of so high a straine, that the man (though inuited by our Sauiour) had a horrour to climbe vp this one degree and step. Let vs see therefore in what this Perfection doth consist, which the man did want; <hi>If thou wilt be perfect, go and sel al.</hi> He therefore that selleth al, that is, he that forsaketh al and followeth the doctrine of Christ, is in a per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect state: he that hath not done this, though he haue done al other things, wanteth yet one thing. Wherefore a Religious life is the highest Perfection, by confession not only of learned and holie men, but of our Sauiour himself;
<pb n="254" facs="tcp:15193:142"/>
and for as much as concerneth the perfection of our owne soules, there is not a higher or more eminent State.</p>

For first, Religion is ranked among the Euangelical Counsels, and is one of the chief of them, or rather the chiefest and greatest among them. Which we may gather by the manner of our Sauiour's speach, when he wished the yong man to this course, saying: <hi>If thou wilt.</hi> For as then it was proposed to that yong man, so it is now proposed to euerie one vnder the same forme: If they wil.

Moreouer Precepts be common to al, to the high and to the low, to the wise and to the simple; Counsels are not for al; yea they are for those only, that wil of their owne accord admit them.

Another thing, by which we may discouer the perfection of a Religious State, is the excellencie of the actions which flow from Religion; for they are not only aboue the strength of Nature, but doe so farre surpasse the bounds therof, as that they cannot be atchieued but by an extraordinarie abundant current of Grace. For to bridle our senses, to subiect our flesh to Chastitie, vtterly to kil our owne wil, to forgoe our freedome, to put our necks into a yoake of perpetual seruitude, to embrace Pouertie, to possesse nothing, to doe the basest offices in a house, to be readie at euerie beck of another man, and alwayes wholy to depend of another's wil in al things concerning vs: These and manie other things of the same nature, which are so inward to a Religious life that Religion cannot be without them, are no lesse repugnant to our cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rupted nature bending wholy to self-loue, then it is against the nature of a man's bodie, to fly in the ayre.

                     </gap> of Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fection.</note> that the Perfection of euerie thing is two-fold. For there is a Perfection, without which a thing is not perfect in his owne nature; as, if a man want bodie or soule; whereas if he haue both these, he is sayd to be perfect, for as much as concerneth the nature of man. There is another Perfection, which giues a kind of grace to a thing; and if it want it, though in nature it be compleat, it is stil sayd to be imperfect; as, if a man haue bodie and soule, but his bodie be crooked and deformed. In like manner the perfection of a Christian is two-fold; one is as it were essential, and consisteth in the ful obseruance of the Commandments; and this Perfection by itself alone, is but lame and imperfect; because it wan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teth that grace and beautie, which the keeping of the Counsels may adde vnto it, as a degree of farre higher perfection; a perfection which no man, doubtles, can choose but loue and desire,<note place="margin">Religion much to be desired.</note> if he doe behold it. For goodnes, and beautie, and order, is naturally so forcible, that we cannot but desire it, if we once cast the eyes of our minde or bodie vpon it; though in smal things there can be but smal shew of it. How forcible therefore must it needes be, when it appeares in things that are rare and excellent? For as we doe not only take pleasure in viewing a gardin (for example) that is neatly kept, and wel set-forth and furnished; or a house that is wel built and commodious, and such other things of greater bulck; but in a flower, and an apple, and in anie little thing that is curiously wrought, and hath anie workmanship in it, and finally in whatsoeuer we find anie expression of beautie and handsomnes, and in euerie one of these things, according to the seueral kinds and natures of them: Much more contentment, doubtles, must we needes take in anie thing, the more compleate and admirable the perfection of the thing is. Wherefore seing among al the things of this world, nothing can be better or of greater value, then one's Minde and Soule; the perfect ornament, and most compleat perfection therof must needes be the thing, which of al others is most beautiful and comelie in itself, and most to be desired. For if a man, that beholds attentiuely the beautie of a bodie, be necessa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rily taken with the proportion that is betwixt one member and another, and with the conuenient temper of the coulour and complexion of it; the same temper, and proportion, and beautie being in the Mind farre more excellent, shal it not draw a man to the like contentment and ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miration? And if no man, in whose power it were to frame himself a bodie, would make it lame, imperfect, and deformed; what madnes is it, to choose a soule, that is crooked and imperfect? In al other things, we desire the best, and the most compleate. If we be to buy a horse, or to build a house, or to make a sute of clothes, or a payre of shoes, we should thinke ourselues fooles, if of purpose we should choose the worst, when we might haue better; and of things that are within
<pb n="256" facs="tcp:15193:143"/>
vs, we desire in al other things to be excellent; They that studie, desire to be excellent in learning; they that practise their weapon, content themselues with no meane skil in it; and in euerie handie-craft, though in itself the trade be base and seruil, yet euerie bodie desires to do it, after the best manner; because Perfection pleaseth in euerie thing, and euerie bodie doth ayme at it, and labour for it. If therefore in these little things, perfection doth so much please vs, the perfection of the mind must certainly in reason be farre more plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sing, as being farre more graceful and admirable, and specially the perfection, which vertue and good life doth worke in vs. Wherefore seing there cannot be found a subiect more noble then our minde, nor a more noble forme then sanctitie, and the compound of them both must consequently needes be the rarest and most Diuine that can be: Religion, which contayneth al this, must necessarily also be valued accordingly, and loued, and embraced, and sought for by al meanes possible.</p>

<pb n="257" facs="tcp:15193:143"/>
out of a Christian resolution haue either exchanged their riches with pouertie, or, though they had none, haue set them at naught as if they had had them, forsaking al for him, as he forsooke al for their sakes, doe follow wheresoeuer he goeth. Which onlie word (<hi>wheresoeuer he goeth</hi>) doth imply not only imitation, but a most perfect expression of him.</p>
               <p n="3">3. This expression is most of al to be seen in the Crosse of Christ; which <hi>Cassian</hi> doth lay before our eyes in liuelie coulours, out of a Speach, which <hi>Penusius</hi> (a holie Abbot) made in his hearing, to a Nouice, when he admitted him to a Monastical course.

                     <hi>Cassian l</hi> 4. <hi>c.</hi> 32.</note> he sayd thus vnto him; that the forsaking of the world, is as it were an image of the Crosse, the whole life of a Religious man expressing the manner in which our Sauiour hung vpon it. For as he that is crucifyed, cannot stirre his bodie as he list, neither on the one side, nor the other;<note place="margin">A Reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gious man an image of Christ Crucifyed.</note> so the wil of a Religious man is fastned to the Crosse, that is, to a thing that is continually paineful and irksome to flesh and bloud: And as he, that hangeth vpon a Crosse, doth neither minde that which is before his eyes, nor care for prouiding for to morrow, nor desireth lands nor possessions, but liuing in bodie, is dead to al things in though, and affection, and hath his mind wholy fixed vpon that which shal befal him in another world; so a Religious man is not only dead to vice and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cupiscence, but to this verie natural world itself, and to al things in it, and his mind and bodie is wholy bent to that place, where euerie moment he hopeth to arriue; and consequently being absolutly dead to the world, and to al the actions and desires therof, he liueth in him only, who was Crucifyed for him.</p>
               <p n="4">4. This similitude with Christ Crucifyed wil easily leade vs to the vnder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>standing of the honour and dignitie,<note place="margin">The ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour which he hath by it.</note> which a Religious man getteth by it. The Maiestie of the Eternal God is so very great, and the dignitie of his Person so infinit, that whatsoeuer he vniteth to himself, he rayseth it withal to an infinit degree of honour and worth, and giueth it part of his owne beautie and glorie, by the vnion, which it hath with himself, how meane soeuer the thing were before. For what can be more contemptible then flesh, which is but dirt and filth? and yet so soone as it was vnited to that Diuine subsistence, that verie dirt was not only worthie of al veneration, but deserued to be adored as a thing Diuine. The Crosse itself, which before was so infamous, and, as the Apostle speaketh, a curse, now since the Sonne of God hath touched it, is become so honourable, that Kings and Princes weare it for an ornament vpon their heads.

               <p n="5">5. Thus doth the similitude with Christ our Sauiour grace and honour a Religious State.

<q>The vnitie of spirit, which a man, that hath his hart seated on high, hath with God, is the perfecton of a wil that profiteth to God-ward, when a man doth not only desire what God wil haue, but is both so affected in minde, and
<pb n="260" facs="tcp:15193:145"/>
so perfect in his affection, that he cannot desire anie thing els, but that which God wil haue. For to desire that which God wil haue, is to be like to God; but moreouer not to be able to desire but that which God wil haue, is to be that which God is; whose wil and being are the same.</q>

Those sacred bonds therfore of the Vowes bring with them this firmnes; which is a kind of expression of the Eternitie of God, binding vs euen against our wil, yet withal giuing vs strength and force to be willing. And we may wel liken it to a ship, that rides at ancker, which may be wafted and tossed by the billowes of the sea, but cannot be carried into the mayne, nor driuen vpon the rocks: so a Soule obliged to God (who in himself is so firme and immoueable) may lye floating vpon the water, and sometimes be tossed, by reason of our natural infirmitie, so long as we are in this world, specially the waues and gusts of temptation rushing against vs; but the cables of our Vowes doe easily stay vs; and though we be heaued-at, we giue not place, but stick immoueably to God, to whome we haue vowed our selues.</p>

And the reason is, because both Charitie, from which it proceedeth, is the highest of al vertues; and among the workes of Charitie, Martyrdome is the greatest worke. The euil also, which we vndergoe by Martyrdome, is the greatest of euils, to wit, death; and the good, with which we parte, is the most desired of al goods, to wit, life. And yet this being so great a worke as it is, if we compare it with a Religious State, we shal find, that as in manie things Martyrdome goeth beyond Religion,<note place="margin">Religion compared with Mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tyrdome.</note> so in manie things a Religious State <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

<q>For if Christ be Chastitie, Truth, and Iustice, he that layeth wayte against these Vertues, is a persecutour; and he a Martyr, that is resolued to maintaine them in himself, and defend them in others.</q> So that in the opinion of <hi>S.

For if it hath part with the bodie and the griefs therof, because it is the forme of the bodie; the grief, doubtlesse, which is within itself, must needs be more paineful to it.

For neither in Martyrdome is the soule killed, but passeth from this miserable world to a more happie life; life is not lost by it, but changed for a life that is farre better and more pleasant; so that if we lay al these things to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>geather, confirmed by holie Fathers, we shal finde not one Martyrdome alone,<note place="margin">Many Mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tyrdomes in Reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gion.</note> but manie Martyrdomes in one Religion: One in Pouertie, another in Chastitie, a third and greatest of al in the perpetual denial of our owne wil; another againe in the affliction and subduing of our flesh; and finally in the perpetual conflict and combat, which we haue with the craftie <hi>Serpent,</hi> who laboureth by al possible meanes to take Christ from our hart.

In that he sayth, there must be some equalitie or likenes betwixt friends,<note place="margin">How there may be friendship betwixt God and and man.</note> his opinion is not to be re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iected; but he was mistaken in that he saw not how man might be like to God; and no wonder, because he knew nothing of the guift of God, which supplieth that in man, which is wanting in Nature.

Of which guift though al be partakers, that haue the Iustifying Grace of God inherent in them, yet Religious people haue manie particular reasons to reioyce in it aboue others, and reape manie singular commodities by enioying it.</p>

The difference is that the first bindeth vs to man, the second to God; where we may easily see the infinit disparitie, which is both of dignitie and contentment betwixt the one and the other; yet they agree in this, that as man and wife are both of them equally obliged by marriage, so the Vowes of Religion tying vs to God, doe tye also God to vs; such is his infinite loue towards vs. What therfore can we desire more?<note place="margin">1. <hi>Cor.</hi> 7.4.</note> They agree also in that, <hi>as the wise hath not power ouer her owne bodie, but the husband</hi> (as the Apostle speaketh) so Religious people haue no power nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther ouer bodie nor minde; because spiritual marriage doth equally giue both to God, and indeed the mind rather then the bodie, or at least principally the mind; so that Christ our Sauiour hath ful title, and right, and power ouer both, established vpon him.</p>

daughter, harken, and see, and consider how great things thy God hath thought thee worthie of, and forget thy people, and the house of thy father, forsake thy carnal affections; forget thy secular behauiour; abstaine from thy former vices, and forgoe thy euil customes. Thus speaketh <hi>S. Bernard</hi> in this point. In which if we may giue him credit, so graue a man as he is, and writing so aduisedly as he doth, what life can be more honourable, or in regard of pleasure more desireful, then Religion?</q>
For in euerie ordinarie marriage it is generally the custome and also necessarie, that man and wife partake of one an others condition, state, and goods, insomuch that if a Prince, or a King, take a woman of meane estate to his wife, she hath part with him, both of his wealth, and of his com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mand, because as by marriage they are alone, so whatsoeuer they haue, must needs be common betwixt them. And the self-same hapneth in our spiritual marriage with God, and is so much the more perfectly performed, by how much the goodnes of God is infinitly greater, and his loue towards mankind infinitly more ardent and vehement.</p>

We see what difference there is betwixt the house of God dedicated to his vse, and an ordinarie house which is for the dwelling of men. If we regard the material, they are the same in both; stones, and morter, and timber alike: But the vse of them is farre dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferent. For in our ordinarie dwelling, we eate, and drink, and sleepe, and play, and worke, and bring-in our horses and cattle for our vse, and we doe these things lawfully, and there is no indecencie in it; but if we doe anie of these things in a Church consecrated to God, it is an irreuerence to the place, and a sinne. The same we may say of a Chalice that is hallowed; for not only if we cast dirt vpon it, but if we drink in it at table, it is a great offence; and so we find,<note place="margin">

As therefore betwixt the house of God and other houses, and betwixt a consecrated Chalice and other cups, there is so maine a difference in the esteeme of them: so a soule that is consecrated to God, doth farre excel the soule of a secular Lay-man in ranck and dignitie. And we haue so much the more reason to think and say so, because these material things being voyd of sense and reason, are not capable of

anie inward sanctitie by Consecration; but though we say that the walles, and the vestements, and the vessels be holie, and we reuerence them as such, yet al this holines is but outward; inwardly they are nothing altered: But the soule of man, is the proper seate of sanctitie, and consequently by Consecration it is inwardly adorned, and perfected, and drawne to a higher degree of dignitie, and nearer to God. What beautie therefore and grace must there needs be in that soule, which thus inwardly changed putteth off, as I may say, al mortal hue, and is cloathed with a kind of Diuinitie? what gold or pretious stone can be compared vnto it? or what sunne did euer shine so bright at noone-day, if we had eyes to behold this wonderful dignitie of ours, &amp; of others that follow the same course.</p>

For if <hi>Abel,</hi> or <hi>Noë,</hi> or <hi>Abraham,</hi> neuer pleased God more, then when they offered those memorable Sacrifices, which are re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>counted of them; and no man in his whole life-time can doe anie thing better, or more holie, then to offer Sacrifice; which notwithstanding we cannot al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wayes doe, but seldome, and at certaine times; what shal we worthily think of that state of life, which is a continual Sacrifice, lasting as long as the man himself lasteth and breatheth? And this our Sacrifice is so much the more ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cellent then anie of those ancient Sacrifices, in regard that it is not the flesh of rammes and bullocks which is now offered, but our owne flesh, and our owne soule, farre more pretious then anie flesh whatsoeuer.</p>

For wheras in a King there be two things principally which are most aymed at, to wit, Power and Honour, thus he discourseth of them both: What is in your opinion the greatest signe of Power? Is it not to be able to reuenge himself of al his enemies, and of whosoeuer stands against him; and reward al them that haue been beneficial or dutiful vnto him? And yet <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="2 letters">
                        <desc>••</desc>
                     </gap>u wil not find al this power in a King; For he hath manie enemies, of <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 word">
                        <desc>〈◊〉</desc>
                     </gap> he cannot haue his wil; and manie that are louing and benefi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cial vnto him, whom he is not able to reward. But a Monk hath a greater and a more eminent power then this, which Kings cannot enioy. For if it be an act of greatest power to be reuenged of our enemies, it is a farre m<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>re excellent thing to find out such a state of life, as no man can hurt, though he would neuer so fayne. For though it be a great matter to be so skilful at one's weapon, as to be able to strike anie man that can strike me; yet it is farre better, and more <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>are and excellent, to haue such a bodie, as cannot be hurt by any skil. And yet there is a greater power then this, to wit, not only that a man cannot be hurt, but to be in such a state, that no man can haue a mind to hurt him. For so he is in much more safetie, because of times though a man cannot hurt another, yet if he hate him, this verie hatred doth in no smal measure abridge his happines and contentment. What therefore can be imagined more ra<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                     </gap>e and Diuine then this state of life, which no man hath a minde to hurt; and if he had a mind, he could not hurt it? For how can it come into any man's minde to malice or offer iniurie to him, that hath nothing to doe with anie man? For we malice people either out of enuie, or feare, or anger. But this noble and indeed Prince-like man is aboue al these things. For who wil enuie him that laugheth at al things, which others loue and admire? Who wil be angrie with a man that offereth him no wrong? who wil feare a man, of whome he can haue no suspicion? No man therefore certainly wil hurt such a man. Now that he cannot hurt him though he would is also plaine; for he cannot finde wherein to entrap him. For as an eagle soaring on-high cannot be caught in the nets, that are layd for lesser birds; so also a Religious man. For how, or by what occasion can anie man hurt him<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> He hath neither monie nor wealth, that he need seare the losse of it; he hath no countrey, out of which he can be threat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned

And if we regarde honour, a Monk is in greater honour, then anie secular man.

A King be he as bountiful as he can, that which he giues, is but gold: a Monck obtaynes of God the spirit of Grace, and corporal benefits also, by his prayers; and nothing is more hateful to the Diuels, then the prayers of a Monck, nothing doth terrifye them more;<note place="margin">3. <hi>Reg.</hi> 1<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

Wherefore at such a time when al the men of the world shal be apaled, and stand amazed with feare, and sorrow, and expectation of the rigid sentence of such a Iudge, then in that general vexation of al men, to be without feare and trouble, and attend that last and irreuocable decree and sentence with ioy, must needs be an inestimable and excessiue benefit.</q>

As we see in common-wealths that are wel gouerned; al are kept to their dutie by certain general rewards and punishments; besides which general rewards for that which is good, there be containe pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culiar rewards for heroical actions: as if a souldier had done anie special

If therefore these three haue their particular Coronets, or garlands; why may we not say, that Religious people shal haue one also particular to themselues? seing they embrace perpetual Chastitie, as Virgins; and cease not to doe great good to their Neighbour, as Doctours; and in regard of the manie crosses they endure, stand in so neare a degree to Martyrs, as I haue shewed; and though there were nothing els, haue vtterly set the World and al worldlie things at naught, and liued perpetually in so great a contempt of it, as we see; which no man can denye but that it is one of the noblest and most heroical actions, which a man can performe in this life, and consequently may worthily deserue a singular reward, and, as the holie Scripture speaketh, <hi>euerie one of them receaue from the hand of God a Kingdome of glorie,</hi>

One night as he passed through the Church, bowghing his head and his bodie to adore the Blessed Sacrament as he went by it, in the verie instant he was in a Rapt, and had this Vision: He saw a long ranck of people passing by him clad al alike; their garments were white; their faces, &amp; their hands, and feete, did shine like the sunne; they went (as he thought) in great haste and ioy to meete, and embrace, and entertayne a certain guest, that was newly come among them. And being much astonished with this sight, he asked one of the companie, what al this was; and it was answered him, that they were Franciscan-Friars that were going to accompanie a certain man of their Order into Heauen, that was newly departed; that they themselues lined al of them in Heauen in great glorie &amp; happines; and that the honour of that white garment was particularly granted them in lieu of the Habit of Religion, which they did weare on earth; the glorie of their bodies for the incommodities, which they had suffered in it; of which glorie he should be partaker, if he remained firme and constant in the course he had begun; which afterwards he easily effected, being so encouraged with this Vision, that he neuer after had anie wandring thoughts at al.</p>

Then we are presented at the doore of the Tabernacle; of that Tabernacle, I say, in which God hath his dwelling, and into his glorie we are translated to receaue the abundant reward of our long seruice.

That he telleth him, that <hi>One thing is yet wanting vnto thee</hi>; and sayth it to one, that from his verie youth had alwayes obserued al the Commandments, doubtlesse he would edge him on with desire of Perfection, the beautie therof being of itself wonderfully amiable.

For so doe diuers very learned men deliuer, to wit, that the Apostles were the first that euer receaued this kind of forme of Religious Institute, and first put it in practise. And of the Pouertie which they professed, there can be no doubt made, because we find it by that which is written of their practise in the Ghospel; and <hi>S.

Finally we may gather their Obedience from these words: <hi>And we haue followed thee.</hi> For what is it to follow an other, but to liue according to his direction, and to obey him in al things? Seing therfore al these things are without question to be found in the Apostles, let vs shew, that they obliged themselues also therunto by Vow.</p>

                  <hi>Aluarus Pelagius</hi> (a graue and learned Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thour) doth cleerly demonstrate this point in the Booke which he writ <hi>of the Complaint of the Church,</hi> and bringeth manie arguments to proue it, but chiefly this, that <hi>a Vow,</hi> as he sayth, <hi>is the Counsel of Counsels, and the soule and perfection of them</hi>; because whatsoeuer Counsel is confirmed by Vow, it is essentially the more perfect, and the more acceptable to God. From whence he concludeth, that if the Apostles had made no Vow, they could not be sayd to be in the top and heighth of Perfection; but the abdication of the self-same things, which Religious people doe dayly professe, would be more perfect then that which the Apostles practised, in regard they oblige themselues by Vow: now it were temerarious, and wicked, and impious to think or say so of the Apostles. And he con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firmeth it, because there can be no question, but that the Apostles did not only leaue the possession of that which they had, but the wil of hauing anie thing; that they might truly say: <hi>They had forsaken al.</hi> But this wil of hauing, cannot be forsaken, bu<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                  </gap> by Vow; because we renounce not our wil, as long as we may resume it againe at our pleasure. We may adde moreouer, that certainly the Apostles did not forsake that, which they had, more vnperfectly then the yong man, we spake of, had forsaken them, if he had followed the Counsel of our Sauiour, and sold al; for our Sauiour gaue him the same Counsel, which the Apostles had already embraced: But he: that selleth al thing <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

and consequently neither did the Apostles reserue anie thing to themselues. <hi>S.

But <hi>S. Augustin</hi> doth most perspicuously and most learnedly of anie other deliuer it in these words:
<q>That poore man is raysed from the earth aboue al rich men, and that needie man is extolled aboue al wealthie people from that dung, to sit with the Power<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful of the people, to whom he sayth: <hi>You shal sit vpon twelve seates</hi>; giuing them a Seate of glorie in inheritance.</q>
For these Powerful people had sayd: <hi>Behold we haue forsaken al, and followed thee.</hi> This Vow these most Powerful had vowed. So <hi>S. Augustin.</hi> Seing therefore it is cleare, that the Apostles obserued Pouertie, Chastitie, and Obedience, and moreouer that they did not obserue them meerly voluntarily, but obliged themselues therunto also by Vow; why may we not acknowledge, that this height of Perfection is descended from Christ by them, and account them the first foundations of Religious Conuents? And certainly it was but reason, that so rare a course should be commended by their Dignitie and Sanctitie; and that they, who were to be the Maisters and Doctours of the world, should not want this ornament, which in the glorie of the Ghospels is so conspicuous.</p>

                  <note place="margin">Religion spred ouer the world.</note> but spred itself also at that verie time into other parts of the world. For we find that in Aethiopia the King's daughter was consecrated to God by <hi>S. Matthew Thecla,</hi> by <hi>S. Paul</hi> in Greece, <hi>Domitilla</hi> at Rome by <hi>S. Clement,</hi> and in France <hi>S. Martha</hi> (she that was our Sauiour's hostesse) after the Ghospel was preached at Marsells, is recorded to haue built a Monasterie in a solitarie place retired from the companie of men, where togeather with diuers women of worth consecrated to God, she lead a most heauenlie life. And finally <hi>S. Denis</hi> (a man that liued in that first Age) writeth of this kind of Institute,<note place="margin">
                     <hi>S. Denis de Ec Hierar. c.</hi> 10.</note> as of a thing vsu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally receaued and practised; and by that which he sayth of it, he giueth vs to vnderstand, not only that it is very ancient, but also that euen in those dayes it was highly reuerenced.<note place="margin">The names and Cere<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monies of Monks in the Pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitiue Church.</note> For this reason, <hi>sayth he,</hi> our Diuine teachers haue giuen them names which sound of holines: some calling them Worshippers, others calling them Monks, for the sincere worship, and seruice which they doe to God, and for their solitarie and single life, which maketh them One, and apt to attaine to Vnion with God, and perfection pleasing vnto him, by holie coniunction of things diuided. And then goeth-on to declare the Ceremonies and Rites anciently vsed in the Consecration of Monks, and the reasons and mysteries of them. For first, he sayth, it was the order that the Priest standing before the Altar should say some prayer suitable to the Ceremonie they had in hand; and when the prayer was ended, turning himself to him that was to be admitted, he asked him: whether he were indeed resolued to renounce his se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cular life (which, as his manner is, he calleth a <hi>diuided and distracted life,</hi> because it forceth a man to be sollicitous, and troubled about manie things) and sepa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rate himself from the verie sight of it, betaking himself to an other place. Then proposing vnto him a most perfect forme of liuing, he gaue him to vnderstand
<pb n="302" facs="tcp:15193:166"/>
that from thence forward he was to surpasse in conuersation, both the vulgar and middle sort of men; which shewes how perfect this kind of course it, seing (as he sayth further) it is not ranked in the middle rank of them that ayme at Perfection, but with the highest and most perfect; so that manie things may be done without blame by them that are of the middle sort, which Monks are forbidden, because their busines is to draw themselues as neere as they can and vnite themselues with God. When he that was to be consecrated had promised al this, the Priest making the signe of the Crosse vpon him, did cut-of his hayre in the name of the Blessed Trinitie, and stripping him of his garments, gaue him others to put on; and himself and others that were present saluting him, and giuing him ioy, at last he gaue him the Diuine Mysteries, that is, the holie Communion and most blessed Sacrament.</p>

<q>For the cutting-of his hayre (<hi>sayth he</hi>) did signifie, that laying aside al humane and earthlie ornaments, and from that time forward despising them, he was resolued to seeke to please God by the sole beautie of his soule. The changing of his garment, betokened the inward change of his hart and mind; and withal it was to put him in mind, that his life and conuersation was to differ as much from others, as his Habit did from anie vulgar weare. The saluting him, represented that which our Sauiour sayd: that <hi>ther should be ioy in heauen of one soule conuerted to God</hi>;<note place="margin">
                        <hi>Luc.</hi> 15.</note> for the like ioy and gladnes doth happen also to them that on earth doe endeauour to imitate God. Finally the receauing of the sacred Bodie of our Sauiour, doth put vs in mind of the end, for which such holie courses are taken; to wit, a most perfect and inward coniunction with that Infinit Sanctitie, the fruit of Diuine association,<note place="margin">The parti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culary an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciently practised by Monks.</note> which he was to reape by Monastical exercises.</q>
Thus farre <hi>S.

And I imagin that the causes of this relaxation might be two: First, the great encrease of the number of the Clergie; for the number of Christians growing to that height, that they could not be holpen by few, and it being also a great ornament to the Church to haue manie Ministers, the feruour and zeale of perfection could not be so wel maintayned in so great a number. An other reason might be, because the farther times grew from the primitiue state of the Church, Charitie and the loue of God grew also more cold among men, self-loue and the affection to priuate commodities taking place; so that it was hard to keepe al the Clergie to that strict denial of al things; and yet some, that had more courrage and more feruour, maintayned it, and so applyed them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selues to the functions of the Clergie, that they performed also the offices of Religious people,<note place="margin">S. <hi>Ambrose Epist.</hi> 2 5.</note> and kept their wonted orders exactly.
<hi>S. Ambrose</hi> com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mendeth <hi>Eusebius</hi> Bishop of <hi>Vercels</hi> for his diligence in this kind, ordering his Clergie so,<q> that (as he speaketh) he required of them two things togeather: the continencie of the Monasterie, and the discipline of the Church. These being different in themselues, <hi>Eusebius</hi> (of holie memorie) first ioyned togeather in the Western part<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> &amp; dwelling in the cittie, kept the orders of Monks, &amp; gouerned his Church with sobrietie of fasting.

Now as for the manner of liuing of the Clergie, if we wil goe solidly to worke, we must chiefly haue an eye to that, which was instituted by the Apostles, as our heauenlie Maisters, which doubtles was very different from that, which now we see. For anciently it attended to the functions only of teaching and preaching the Ghospel, of instructing the ignorant in Christian doctrine, of ministring the Sacraments, and, in a word, to purge, illuminate, and perfect the soules of others; by which three<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

<q>Who maketh anie doubt, sayth he, but that these two, to wit, the functions of the Clergie, and the orders of Monks, are to be preferred before al the earnest deuotion, which is practised among Christians? the exercises of the Clergie being ordayned to ciuil and humane conuersation; the Monks accustoming themselues to abstinence and patience. They are seated, as it were, in the open theater of the world; these liue priuate and secret: euerie bodie's eyes are vpon them, these are hidden from euerie bodie. Therefore that noble Champion sayth: We are made a spectacle to this world. They are in the race, these are within the listes. They striue against the confusednes of this world, these against the desires of the flesh. They conquer the pleasures of the bodie, these doe shunne them. Their life is more pleasing, this is more safe; they gouerne, these restraine; yet both denye themselues, that they may be <hi>Christ's,</hi> because it is sayd to the perfect: He that wil come after me, let him denye himself and take vp his Crosse, and follow me.

Thus <hi>S.

Hierome</hi> writeth of the or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der of those times. The first thing they agree vpon, <hi>sayth he,</hi> is to obey their Superiours, and to performe whatsoeuer they shal command.
<q>They are di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stinguished by tens and hundreds, so that euerie tenth man is ouer the nine, and againe the hundredth Superiour hath ten gouernours vnder him; euerie one liues by himself alone, but their Celles are close one to another. Their or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der is, that til the Ninth Houre they goe not to one another, vnlesse it be the Decurion<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                     </gap> I mentioned, to comfort those, that are vnder their charge, if anie one of them chance to be troubled in his thoughts. After the Ninth Houre they meete al togeather, they sing Psalmes, they reade the Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture as it is prescribed them, and when they haue ended their prayers, they al sit downe; and he, whome they cal their Father, standing in the middle of them, beginneth his speach. While he speaketh, there is such silence, that they dare not looke vpon one another, nor spit. The commendation of the speaker, be the teares of the hearers; their teares trickle softly downe their cheek<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>

                     </gap>h into sighes. Then the meeting breaketh-vp, and euerie companie sits downe at board with the Father of it, and they wayte vpon one another by weekes. There is no noyse, while they are at their meate; no bodie speaketh while he eateth. Then they rise al togeather, and hauing sayd Grace, they returne to their Celles. There til euening they dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>course euerie one with those of his owne Companie, and say: Did you not marke this man or the other? what a grace he hath? how great his silence was? how graue was his carriage? If they perceaue anie bodie to be weake, they com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fort him; if feruent in the loue of God, they exhort him to follow it. And be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause, setting aside the times of publick prayer, euerie one watcheth in the night in his owne Celle, they goe to euerie Celle; and laying their care, they listen carefully what they are doing. If they finde anie one more slow then others, they doe not rebuke him, but taking no notice that they know anie thing of it, they visit him oftener; &amp; beginning themselues first, rather encou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rage then compel him to pray.</q> Thus <hi>S.

a Monasterie,<note place="margin">Monaste<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries in Ire<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land.</note> the head of manie Monasteries, out of which manie thousands of Monks had been bred; and sayth further of it thus:
<q>A holie place indeed, and fruitful of Saints, bringing forth abundant fruit to God, insomuch that one onlie childe of that holie Congregation, whose name was <hi>Luanus,</hi>

In brief, the branches therof haue so filled both Ireland and Scotland, as we may thinke, that those verses of Dauid did chiefly foretel of these times: <hi>Thou hast visited the earth,</hi>

                     </hi>; and in like manner the rest, which followeth. And these swarmes of Saints haue not only spread themselues in the Countries aforesayd, but haue also, as it were, ouerflowne into forraine parts.<note place="margin">S. <hi>Colum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>banus.</hi>

This <hi>S. Bernard</hi> relateth of others; and we may say the like of himself and his Familie; for in a short time it encreased so fast, that it was euen a miracle to see it. For while he was at <hi>Clairenaulx,</hi> and his companie was as yet but smal, he saw in a Vision a multitude of people of seueral states and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ditions and in seueral attires flocking downe the adiacent hils in that abun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dance, that the place was not able to contayne them.</p>

                  <note place="margin">The Fran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciscan-Fryars.</note>6. What shal we say of later Orders, especially of the <hi>Franciscans,</hi> who seeme to haue been particularly blessed in this suddaine and large propagation of their Order. For whereas they are distinguished into seueral branches, al deri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ued from one Founder <hi>S. Francis,</hi> the sole Order of the <hi>Obseruantines,</hi> as they cal them, did reckon of late yeares, that they were in number about a hundred thousand Religious. Finally it wil not be hard to shew, that the number of Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligious people in these our dayes is in a manner infinit; and there is apparent reason for it,<note place="margin">The num<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber of Re<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ligious in these dayes.</note> besides that we may see it with our eyes. For Religious Orders ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uing flourished now so manie Ages, so manie of them anciently instituted, so manie new ones growne-vp in succeding times, those of old haue stil co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>tinued, and the new ones haue been dayly encreased to an excessiue number. Which makes me think, that the number of Religious people cannot only not be lesse then anciently it was, when there was such abundance of them, but must needs be somewhat greater then in those times. It may be, that then the num<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber of them made a greater shew, because al that would be Religious, betooke themselues to two or three Orders (for in those dayes there were no more) now we doe not reflect so much vpon the great number of them, because they are diuided into manie Houses and Families. And what greater commendation can we desire, or proofe of the excellencie of this kind of life? This being in a manner the selfsame blessing, which anciently God promised to the Iewes, as an euident token of his fauour and presence with them; <hi>My eye shal be vpon you, and I wil make you encrease;</hi>

               </p>
               <p n="5">5. Yea it is an apparent signe of great perfection; for as by course of nature, a thing must first be rightly composed, and growne to perfection in the kind
<pb n="325" facs="tcp:15193:176"/>
it is in,<note place="margin">The multi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plication of Reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gious peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple a signe of perfe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction in Religious Orders.</note> before it bring forth an other like vnto it; as we see in al herbes and plants, and more apparently in al kinds of beasles &amp; in men also: insomuch that the abilitie of engendring an other, is a signe of abundant strength &amp; vertue in the thing it engendreth: so in this supernatural kind of life, this excessiue en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crease, which I speake of, argueth abundance of great perfection and san<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctitie, which were not much to be admired, if Religion were a course of licentiousnes and libertie, which worketh much vpon Sense, and draweth the flesh &amp; bloud after it. But it is quite co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>trarie; for it taketh those things quite away, which are anie way pleasing to our bodie, and prescribeth others, which are opposite to Nature, as pouertie, paynes-taking, contempt of our selues, voluntarie afflictions, and a perpetual carrying of our Crosse. So that this great concourse to Religion generally of yong people, wel borne, and wel bred, in those yeares and that education, which naturally abhorres al hardnes and au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>steritie, must needs be a signe, that there is something Diuine in Religion, and there can be no other cause giuen of it.</p>

An honour, because as in the Courts of Princes, so in this Court of the Eternal God, which is the Church, it is both honourable and Maiestical to haue seueral degrees of seruants, distributed into seue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral ranks, and different both in their attire, and offices; and it doth much set-forth the glorie, and seruice of God, and of CHRIST our Bride<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>groome; and for the Church his Spouse and Bride, nothing could be more glorious of more magnificent, then to resemble in this so neere the order and varietie of the heauenlie Hierusalem; in which there is not one Order of Angels only, but manie Orders, manie Hierarchies of those Blessed Spirits, like in nature, and yet different in degree and office, con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>spiring al in the perpetual seruice of God.<note place="margin">S. <hi>Thomas</hi> 2.2. <hi>q</hi> 18<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

For manie businesses be of that nature, that they hinder one an other; others are more easily and more sweetly brought to perfection, if they be vndertaken seuerally. Wherefore, as Aristotle sayth, the bodie of man is naturally framed so, as euerie Sense hath a seueral member, and instrument, as it were, appointed for it, to the end they might not hinder one an other,<note place="margin">

And as it is both decent and beneficial for a Cittie to haue trades-men of seueral profes<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sions, some working in wool, others in iron, or timber, and the like, to the end al may haue sufficient to cloath and maintaine themselues; and not only there be seueral trades on foot, but seueral particulars working at one trade and occupation, to the end things may be the more plentiful; so in this spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritual Cittie of God, because very manie things are required to bring a man to Heauen, out of his infinite wisdome he hath prouided, that we should haue plentie of them by meanes of the seueral Religious Orders which are erected.</p>
               <p n="10">10. The Church of God stood in need of Prayers, to releeue it in al dangers and difficulties that doe occurre, and for a continual defence and rampire in al occasions. Therefore God prouided certain Orders that should employ them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selues wholy in Contemplation of Heauenlie things. It needed Fastings and other austerities, both to appease the wrath of God bent against the sinnes of men, and that they might haue good example to imitate. To which purpose there are other Orders founded, which giue themselues most to this kind of <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

               <p n="11">11. And there is one thing in it worthie to be obserued, because it shewes the goodnes of God very apparently, &amp; his particular prouidence ouer man-kind.

                  <pb n="327" facs="tcp:15193:177"/>12. An other reason also might be, and that very necessarie, because God out of his infinit goodnes would prouide for al, and as it were prepare the way for euerie bodie, that had a mind to be perfect in vertue. For people are of seueral natures and dispositions, seueral inclinations and abilities, euen of bodie. Some loue to be alone, others in companie; some cannot abide to haue litle or nothing to doe, others cannot away with businesses; some haue their health wel, others are but weake, and are not able to take much paynes, or endure anie hardnes, so that euerie one of these was to be prouided for, and to haue as it were a seueral diet by himself, which might agree with his health and complexion; and the sweetnes of the prouidence of Almightie God, which he alwayes vseth, and neuer fayleth-of in the gouernement of mankind, could not but order it in this manner.</p>
               <p n="13">13. And finally his Diuine wisdome, in this multiplication of Religious Orders, had a respect also in the prouision of new supplyes to the Church, which being fresh and intire, might themselues fight the more valiantly, and encourage others also to pul-vp their spirits, who were perhaps euen wearie with fighting. For it is ordinarie, that they, who come last, are more feruent, and either by their example, or for shame, or for other reasons, others take hart and courrage by seing them: by which meanes, feruour is alwayes main<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tayned in the Church of God, because these new sparkes, which euer and anone are added, keepe life and fire in it.</p>

For it is but by chance, that a man was borne at Rome, or at Athens; and he, that was borne there, had no part of his choice in it: but these men entred into Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion vpon good consideration &amp; of set purpose, because they knew the good that was in it.

What reason or counsel was there in this business? so soone as the Pope was dead, presently to rush-in vpon a countrey-fellow; to lay hands vpon one that had hid himself; and taking from him his axe, or his hatchet, or his spade, to drawe him to Court, to place him in the Chayre, to cloath him

He proiected to gaine <hi>Syria</hi> and <hi>Palestine</hi> out of the hands of the Barbarians; which sheweth his zeale and courage.

And among other things his carriage towards his kindred was memorable; for he was wont to say, that he owed them no more then he owed anie good man whatsoeuer. And being rid of this household-bond, as I may cal it, he was the freer to attend to the common good of the Church, and was careful in it, for he appeased manie controuersies betwixt Christian Princes, and brought them into league one with an other; and recouered also by force some Citties be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>longing to the Church, which had been vniustly vsurped by others. And yet how vnwilling he was to be in honour, he shewed long before, by that which he did when he was made Cardinal by <hi>Gregorie</hi> the Tenth. For hauing receaued newes of it by letters in France, he wrote againe to the Pope as effectually as he could, beseeching him to excuse him; and in the meane time, til a new command came, he would not alter anie thing concerning himself. And it is moreouer reported of him, that he was wont to say, he had rather be cooke of a Monasterie, then Cardinal.</p>

And lastly also our Societie hath made a hole into <hi>China,</hi> a Kingdome so large, and so rich, that it is almost incredible; which it seemes the Diuel had, as it were of purpose, kept hitherto shut; but notwithstanding the penaltie of death, to which al strangers are liable by their lawes, if they come within their bounds, they got-in fearing nothing, and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maine there to this day, with such hopeful beginnings, that if it succeeds ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cordingly, vndoubtedly the fruit wil be incomparable.</p>

If we compare the greatnes and extent of that World with this, they say there is not much difference; but if we looke into their fashions and dispositions, we shal find them a great deale more barbarous and blind, worshipping the Sunne and Moone, Serpents, and Stones, and the very Oxen in some places, as in the kingdome of <hi>Mexico,</hi> they make their festiual dayes most feareful by Sacrifices of men; manie of them
<pb n="371" facs="tcp:15193:199"/>
feed most greedily vpon man's flesh; a great part of them know not what it is to goe cloathed, but are alwayes naked, contrarie to nature itself. Whereby we may see, that the verie light of nature is so obscured and dulled in them, that they are in a manner beasts, vnder the shape of men. In so great darknes and ignorance, it can not be but that they should be extremely giuen to al manner of vice, and most enormous crimes; and no man can iustly wonder, if, as we read of them, they make no account at al of things that are hideous to be named. Whereby we may conceaue, what paynes, what labour, and toyle was needful to bring such ignorance &amp; barbarousnes to the knowledge and feare of God, and to tame them so, as to sloope to the yoak of Christ; and casting of their brutish behauiour, to embrace Christian humilitie, tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perance, and chastitie.

Which Vision hapning to him often, he was so pricked with it, that he resolued to goe into the Indies againe to his former labours, &amp; bestowed himself there manie yeares very profitably. Not vnlike to this was the manner, in which God inuited our <hi>S. Xauerius</hi> to the same work long before he vndertooke it.

                  <seg rend="decorInit">I</seg>T is not only true, that Religious Orders haue brought forth such abundance of fruit, as I haue sayd; but also that no state of life, no companie of men, is so proper and wel prouided for it, as they are. Wherof there might be manie reasons giuen, but we wil reduce them to three. The first may be drawne from the nature and disposition of God, and the fashion which he doth hold with vs. For if we consider attentiuely the wayes, which from the beginning of his Church he hath vsed to bring men to Saluation, we shal find, that he hath alwayes chosen those instruments and helps for so great a busines, which were most destitute of humane meanes towards the perfor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mance of it.</p>
               <p n="2">
                  <note place="margin">God chose the ignoble to preach the Ghos<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pel.</note>2. This is that which <hi>S. Paul</hi> writing of the Primitiue Church obserued and taught, that there were <hi>not manie powerful, or noble, or wise man accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding to the flesh, but God chose the weake of the world to confound the strong; and the ignoble, and contemptible, and the things which are not, to destroy those which are</hi>; and giueth this solid reason of it, <hi>that al flesh may not glorie,</hi> that is, that the glorie of so great a work should not be giuen to men, and humane forces, <hi>and so the Crosse of Christ be euacuated,</hi> as he speaketh. To which effect <hi>S. Ambrose</hi> also speaking very wel,<note place="margin">1. <hi>Cor.</hi> 1. S. <hi>Ambrose San Lucam.</hi>
                  </note> biddeth vs marke the heauenlie proiect.
<q>He hath chosen, <hi>sayth he,</hi> to send not the wise, or the rich, or the noble, but fisher-men and Publicans; to the end that he might not be thought to haue inuited the world by ostentation of power, or bought it out with abundance of wealth, or drawne anie man to his fauour by the shew of nobilitie and greatnes, that the force of truth, and not grace in disputing, might preuaile.</q>
And we must not think that God is changed, or that the wisdom of God taketh an other course now for the conuersion of soules, then anciently he did. For neither can there be anie change in God, and the motiues stil remaine, least that, which is altogeather Diuine, be attri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>buted to humane strength; to which men are prone enough in their owne disposition; because their carnal eyes behold only that which outwardly is done by man, and cannot reach to see the force of the inward grace, from
<pb n="373" facs="tcp:15193:200"/>
which al these effects proceede. The difference only is this, that anciently God for the most part chose those, which were bred and borne in pouertie &amp; want; and now he maketh vse of those who haue voluntarily made them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selues poore of their owne accord. And the reason is, because if al they, that are nobly and richly borne, were excluded from this perfection, they should be depriued of so great a good without anie fault of theirs: and on the other side, if they should be admitted vnto it with their worldlie riches, God should goe from his rule, as I haue sayd; and therefore he hath di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uinely tempered it so, that they that are nobly descended, and wealthie, and powerful, might haue part of this glorie, yet so as first they forsake their worldlie wealth and honour, and bring themselues of their owne good wil to an humble and poore estate. And we may obserue further, that so long as the Church had no earthlie possessions, and the work-men therof were poore and destitute of worldlie helps, and lead their life, as the Apostles did, <hi>in hunger and thirst, in cold and nakednesse,</hi> God vsed in a manner no other instruments in it but them:<note place="margin">2. <hi>Corinth.</hi> 9.</note> But when afterwards, as <hi>S. Hierome</hi> writeth, <hi>it grew greater in power and riches, and lesse in vertue</hi> (which Age he so long agoe tearmeth the dregs of times) then,<note place="margin">S. <hi>Hierome in vita Malach.</hi>
                  </note> and euer since, the Diuine goodnes hath called Religious poore men to this work, which cannot be effected but by them that are poore. This was figured in that great <hi>Golias</hi> the Giant, representing the Diuel, that stood vpbraiding God and his forces; for God chose not an other Giant, nor yet a man growne to pul him downe,<note place="margin">1. <hi>Reg.</hi> 17.34.49.</note> but a beardles and naked boy: And when the walles of <hi>Hierico,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">
                     <hi>Ios.</hi> 6.</note> that is, the fortifications which <hi>Satan</hi> maketh, were throwne downe to the ground, not by Cannon-shot, or militarie en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gines, but with the blast of a trumpet, which God knowes how weake it is. And the same was foreshewed in that new manner of going into the field, without anie weapon, but only a lamp put into an earthen pitcher, to wit, sanctitie couered with an outward humble manner of life; which notwithstanding cannot but shew itself, and shewing itself, confound al the hoast of <hi>Satan</hi> and al his forces. This is the reason which hath moued God to hold this course.</p>
               <p n="3">3. The second reason reflecteth vpon the men that are to be holpen.<note place="margin">Example more for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cible then words.</note> For wheras example of life is much more forcible to perswade, then words alone, if the Auditorie heare a discourse of shunning honour, of embra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cing pouertie, of voluntarie abasing and humbling ones-self, and of al that mortification which the Ghospel teacheth; and yet the man himself that speaketh it, abound in riches, and honour, and worldlie glorie, his words wil haue litle force; because though we may retaine these things, and our hart and affection not be vpon them, yet it seldome is so; and when it hapneth to be so, yet people cannot know it, because they cannot diue into the secrets of our hart. And heer we speake not of what may be, but what is more forcible to perswade and winne peoples harts. For who can make anie doubt, but that people wil easier beleeue, that a man sets al humane things at naught, if they see him indeed contemne them, then if outwardly they see no such thing by him, though inwardly in his mind he be so disposed?</p>

For wheras the goods and pleasures therof, like smooth-toungued dames leade the greater part of the world by the nose, they beholding others so easily to resist them, and to treade those vices vnder foot, to which their consciences tel them that themselues and others are in bondage, they cannot but haue a great conceit of them, and secretly in their harts admire them, and extol them among their neighbours, as men that haue done strange things; and not with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out great reason. For it is a great point to be maister in this kind of al earthlie things, to subdue ourselues, and the crooked inclinations which are in vs; and they that contemne the world with al the allurements therof, must needs be of a noble and heroical spirit, and endued with rare and eminent vertue.

<pb n="383" facs="tcp:15193:205"/>
and not contenting itself with professing learning within itself, it vndertaketh to communicate the learning, which it hath, with others, by teaching publick Schooles. And to the end it may deriue the greater benefit to others, it con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fineth not itself to Diuinitie or Philosophie, as for the most part other Reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gious Orders doe, but it teacheth al Arts &amp; Sciences and Grammer-schooles; and leaueth out none but such as are not so suitable to a Religious profession to meddle in, as the Ciuil or Common Law, and Physick.</p>
               <p n="19">19. In fine, to summe-vp the discourse which we haue made, Religious men may in a manner glorie, that most kinds of learning haue been reuiued by their industrie, which but for them would haue been wholy extinct; others haue been refined and polished by them. For what had become of Diuinitie, which is the Queen of al Sciences, if it had not been cultiuated by them, and brought into the way and method, in which it is? And though Philosophie hath been learnedly handled by others, yet Religious men haue much illustrated and enlarged it, and added, and explained, and reformed manie things in it, ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to the rule of Faith.</p>
               <p n="20">20. It remayneth that we speake of Eloquence,<note place="margin">Eloquence.</note> wherin Religious men haue been as eminent as in Learning. And we shal easily see it, if we consider the infinit multitude of Preachers, which in the Christian world are beating their Pu<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>pits, specially at some times of the yeare. For though al of them be not equally eloquent, yet no man can deny that there haue been and are to this day very manie exquisit tongues, that with a fluent stile, and choyce words, and abundance of good matter wel couched togeather, take, and delight, and leade the <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>uditorie to what they please. For if the effect of Eloquence be the applause of the hearers, certainly they, that deale with people that are sensual (such as naturally loathe spiritual things) &amp; are notwithstanding able<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> not only to draw them to giue eare vnto them, but to hold them suspense in admiration, and delight them, and steale vpon their minds and affections, so as to bring some from dishonest behauiour to chastitie, some from vnlawful trading to vpright dealing, some from rancour and hatred to peace and concord, finally not a few from the loue of the world, in which they were drowned ouer head and eares, to the contempt therof, and vtter forsaking of al earthlie things, must needes haue a great guift in speaking. Anciently the Oratours that could speake to the humour of the people were in greatest esteeme; and we find few either in <hi>Greece</hi> or <hi>Rome</hi> that could doe it; and those few are so famous that the Countreys, where they were borne, are renowned for them. What an honour therefore is it to vs, to haue so manie rare men in this kind? But if we reflect vpon the solidnes of the matter, the weight of both their sayings, and, as I sayd, vpon the effects which ours haue wrought, there is no comparison betweene them and vs.</p>

For wheras on a time two malefactours were going to dye, he commanded them to stand at a place where he was preaching, their faces couered, probably to the end they might be lesse distracted; where he began to discourse with that vehe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mencie of the fowlenes of sinne, of the paine of hel, and such other motiues as are wont to stirre-vp sorrow and repentance, that the two malefactours began first to sweate for verie grief and contrition of hart, and at last were turned into a very coale, as if they had been burned with fire; which was apparent vnto al the people, so soone as their faces were vncouered. How vehement was his speach, which was able in this manner to inflame both the mind and the verie bodie also? We meete not with manie of these very strange effects, which <hi>S.

So when Religious men seeke these natural abilities, they seeke not themselues, hauing vtterly forsaken al from their hart; but they seeke the glorie of God and the benefit of their neighbours, for whose good al that beautie is intended; and consequently it belongeth also to the goodnes of God, to encrease their abilities, and (as I sayd before) to make them more graceful and effectual, then the self-same would haue been in a secular course of life.</p>

                  <seg rend="decorInit">B</seg>ESIDES the special assistance of God, which doubtlesse is the chiefest cause, there be other reasons, why Religious men haue been and are most commonly so eminent in al kind of Learning.<note place="margin">Time and applica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion.</note> For first the studie of wisdome requireth time and application of mind; both which are seldome found in the world, and abound in Religion. For Secular people are continually in one busines or other, and wholy taken-vp with the cares of the world; they that haue no busines, spend their time in vnprofitable things, as in hunting and hawking, in play and such like pastimes; people being generally giuen to <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                  </gap>ase, and to shunne labour, as an enemie to nature. Religious men on the other side are free from al worldlie busines, and consequently haue time at wil, and they spend it not in idle trifles; neither are they called from their studies, by the trouble and paines, which is annexed vnto them; because they are accustomed and take a delight in this crosse and mortification, aswel as in manie others.</p>
               <p n="2">2. Peace of mind,<note place="margin">Peace of mind.</note> which followeth out of the suppression and rooting-out of our disordered affections, is a great help to profit in learning; for if it be not possible to keep our mind attentiue to our studies while we are run<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning-about or in anie violent exercise of the bodie, much lesse can we vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derstand anie thing, if our mind itself be wholy troubled, no more then we can see in a duttie troubled water.</p>

And finally (as I sayd before, but I meane to insist somewhat more vpon it) the light and grace of God concurreth aboue al. For Religious men directing their studies &amp; labours to the seruice of God his immortal light, when God giueth them good successe in them, he dilateth his owne busines, and concurreth to the aduancing of his owne glorie and cause; which is otherwise with most secular people, that studie for honour or lucre sake.

And these are not only more noble then Action by itself, but also greater then Contemplation alone, when it reflect no further then itself, and reaches not to the benefiting of others. And yet this kind of life shal not need to stand in feare, least it fal into that which our Sauiour reprehendeth in <hi>Martha,</hi> to wit, <hi>sollicitude and trouble about manie things.</hi> For when Contemplation is coupled with outward Action, they agree so wel togeather, that Contemplation is a help to the outward work, which we haue in hand, and the outward work doth not hinder Contemplation.

<q>If I were a mayde retired in my closet for modestie sake, and should see my father's house al on a burning fire, were it fitting for me to sit idly beholding the flame? And if I should doe so, I should also be consumed by the fire?

Thus spake <hi>Aphraates</hi> in those dayes; and ours are not much better, but are pestered with as much infection now brought-in by <hi>Satan,</hi> as was then by <hi>Valens.</hi>

Augustin</hi> telleth vs, <hi>a Common-wealth is nothing els but a companie of men linked togeather by some common bond of societie.</hi> So that the nobler and the more excellent the bond is, in which men agree (it being the ground of al Communities and Common-wealths) the more noble also and more excellent is the Communi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie and Common-wealth; as the Common-wealth of the <hi>Romans,</hi> contayning the gouerment of the whole world, must needs be more maiestical then a Common-wealth of pesants, or trades-men, if anie such be. This our Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon-wealth therefore doth in this one thing farre surpasse al Co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>mon-wealths that euer were, or could be desired or proiected by the Philosophers; because the good, which is intended in worldlie Common-wealths, is earthlie and hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mane; the good which is in ours, is Heauenlie and Diuine; and consequently surpasseth al other more then anie man can conceaue.<note place="margin">

               <p n="3">3. Another thing wherin our Common-wealth excelleth, is this. Citties, as <hi>Aristotle</hi> acknowledgeth, are not erected for people only to liue in; for so (as he obserueth) there might be a cittie of beasts, because they must liue, nor only for defence against enemies, nor for traffick; because so al Confederats should make but one Cittie. The cause therefore, why Citties are built, is, to liue honestly and wel in them. For if euerie one, that gouerneth himself by Reason, doe th<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 span">
                     <desc>〈…〉</desc>
                  </gap> doth for some good end, a Cittie also, which is a thing much
<pb n="393" facs="tcp:15193:210"/>
more noble then euerie priuate man by himself, must intend that which is the best and greatest good, which is vertue and honestie. This is <hi>Aristotle's</hi> dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>course. To what Common-wealth therefore (if <hi>Aristotle</hi> himself were aliue to iudge) doth al this agree more properly, then to Religion? the end of it being nothing but Vertue, &amp; hauing so manie easie wayes to attaine vnto it; specially that being also true,<note place="margin">
                     <hi>Ide</hi> 1. <hi>Col. c.</hi> 9.</note> which he obserueth, that <hi>where Vertue is not respected and honoured aboue al other things, the best state that is, cannot long endure.</hi> For where shal we find one Common-wealth among those of this world, where power, and wealth, and nobilitie, and fauour doe not beare the sway? But in Religion vertue doth not only vsually, but almost necessarily, rule al because they haue reiected al earthlie things, the glorie wherof doth so much dazle peoples eyes; finding also one thing more in it, which the Philosopher in another place doth make a great matter of, to wit, that it is a rule among Religious Orders, that equalitie or superioritie goes not by riches or bloud, but by vertue;<note place="margin">
                     <hi>Ide</hi> 3 <hi>Pol. c.</hi> 6.</note> so that they that are equal or more eminent in vertue, are truly equal or more eminent, and not if they be equal or more eminent then others in bloud or riches.</p>
               <p n="4">4. Wherefore hauing layd this foundation, as it were a beginning of our Religious Common-wealth, let vs consider the rest of the forme of it, wherof there be two parts; for as the bodie of euerie liuing creature consisteth of the head that ruleth, and of other members that are ruled and obey, so the bodie of euerie Common-wealth hath certain members which belong vnto it, to wit, euerie particular person of it;<note place="margin">The go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>

                  </gap>s. And to beginne with that which is principal, it is no smal benefit and commendation of Religious Orders, that they are gouerned not by manie, but by one man. For wheras the greatest good that can happen to a Communitie, is to be vnited and one within itself, it is a much more effectual meanes to main<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tayne this vnion, to haue the gouerment in one man's hand, then to haue it in manie; for if it were in manie, to gouerne wel they must become one by co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>sent; as when manie help to draw or carrie a great weight; for they cannot carrie or draw it, vnlesse they be in some sort vnited, and in that vnion and c<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="2 letters">

               <p n="5">5. Which kind of gouerment we see in Nature. For al things depend of one<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> al the members of a bodie are gouerned by the hart; al the powers of the soule, by reason; the whole world and al things in it, by one God. It is true, that in the command, which one man alone hath ouer others, there is this danger; least al being in one man's hand, he turne al to his owne priuate ends, by the strength of his power, riches, or ambition. Wherefore to the end he may gouerne wel, he must (as <hi>S. Thomas</hi> discourseth at large in his Direction for the gouerment of a good Prince) haue God before his eyes, and endeauour to bring his subiects to the obedience, and seruice, and honour of God; which how hard it is in the world, and how easie and daylie in practise in Religion, who is there that doth not see? For the principles, which are most apt to peruert mens thoughts and affections, and turne them from the true seruice of God to their priuate intentions (to wit, that we must establish our great<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nes<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> desire, to be feared; cut-of the heads and causes of conspiracies; abound <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 word">

For this certainly is beyond that, which men ordinarily doe, and beyond the common fashion of liuing. For the natural affection which we haue as children, doth not suffer vs to contemne them that begot vs, &amp; brought vs into the visible light of this world. The law, I say, which is naturally inbred in the harts of men, doth not perswade vs to leaue our owne cittie, al our kindred, al our play-fellowes, al our friends and acquaintance; and to goe dwel with strangers, to trauel into farre countries, citties, and villages, not for a yeare, or two, or three, but al our life-time; &amp; of our owne free choice to suffer hunger and thirst, cold and nakednes, to punish our bodies also with watching, and fasting, and other labours, to bring it vnder with daylie abstinen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces, and, that which is greater then al this, to fight against the inclinations of ou<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

But when we see the quite contrarie acted, it proceedeth either out of feare of death, or cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain knowledge of the ficklenes and falshood of the world, or out of an assured and strong hope of future happines; which hope we cannot taste of, but by the light of Faith, which is giuen vs before. And we come not to the possession of this Faith, of which we speake, by our owne free wil, but by the guift of God, who hath mercie on vs, and draweth vs, and preserueth vs. The glorious Mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tyrs enlightned with the splendour of this Faith, haue with most ardent cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritie endured for Christ, fire, imprisonment, chaynes, stripes, torments, reproa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ches, exile, losse of goods, and death. The holie Anchorets, endued with the cleernes of this Faith, haue filled the deserts, walked the wildernesses, builded Monasteries, therin to attend to the glorifying of God, to giue themselues to often prayer, to labour with their hands at conuenient times, and to assemble togeather the children of God dispersed euerie where abroad, and to ouer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come the secret attempts of their inuisible enemies. Inspired certainly by God, they vnderstood that this world is ful of concupiscence of the flesh, allurements of the eyes, and other pleasures, and of pride of
<pb n="399" facs="tcp:15193:213"/>
life. They saw that men did dayly cast themselues headlong vpon vice, neglect the Law of God, contemne his commandments, follow the plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sures of present delight, and giue themselues wholy to earthlie lucre, tran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sitorie honour, hurtful dishonestie, and secular cares, which make the louers of them strangers to God &amp; to themselues, and breed an auersion from al vertue. For, light and darcknes, vanitie and truth, vertue and vice, the loue of God and of the world, the works of the flesh and of the spirit, the ioyes of this life and of the life to come, cannot meete in one, nor stand togeather. Wherefore to the end they might doe God the seruice, which is due vnto him, and curbe the passions of vice, which continually boyle-vp from the sting of sinne and itching flesh, and bridle their owne wil, from which euerie beginning of sinne doth receaue nourishment, for the loue of Christ they haue deliuered themselues ouer into such prisons. By these laudable intentions, by this manner of liuing, our holie Mother the Church is glorifyed. For euen in these times, in which we see iniquitie abound, and the charitie of manie to grow cold, there want not some, who treade the footsteps of the holie Fathers, though not with so great feruour of charitie, as they. For there be sundrie Congregations of the seruants of God, which though they be in their habits different, different in their constitutions and ceremonies, yet labour with one and the same intention of glorifying God, and gayning their Neighbour, and for the same end of coming to their Heauenlie countrie. O how manie of both Sexes, in this great multitude of seruants of Christ diffused euerie-where almost throughout the whole world, are eminent for sanctitie? How manie fatten themselues with singular deuotion, and continual prayer? How manie are conspicuous for heroical vertue? Some are rare for humilitie, others for constant patience, others for puritie of mind, others for zeale of righteousnes, others for the loue of God and their Neighbour, others for their singular preheminence in Religious conuersation. Al of them labour without enuying one another, without pride of hart, according to the measure of Faith, and of the Grace, which is giuen them, to please God, to profit dayly, and to heape-vp gaynes of the Talents, which are lent them.</q>

People that are noble and rich in the world, and haue great power, haue but an outward kind of worth and excellencie, in comparison of them, that haue vertue; but the reason, why they are vulgarly more honoured, is, because the vulgar sort of people make account, that there is no other good, but these exteriour things. This is Aristotle's discourse; wherof it followeth, that not only the wiser sort, but the vulgar also, if they haue anie conceit<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> what true Vertue is, must needs honour it farre more, then anie outward thing; and consequently, if Vertue be so playne and conspicuous, that euerie bodie must needs see it, they cannot but beare great respect vnto it, and beh<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

In so much that we see, that it hath alwayes been the custome, not only among Christians, but among Infidels, and those that haue not had the true knowledge of God, to deale with more respect with them, that haue particularly deuoted them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selues to the seruice of God, then with anie others. For as there is no nation so barbarous, but doth in some sort acknowledge, that there is a Soueraigne Nature so powerful, that al good things are to be asked of it, and punishment expected for offences committed, in which respect they worship that Nature with particularities and ceremonies, so there is no bodie, that doth not think, that they are particularly to be respected and reuerenced, that haue particular relation to that Nature; and so we see the practise of al Antiquitie.

<q>Doe not they, I pray you, that serue our Sauiour faithfully, most manifestly come by that Hundredfold grace by this, that for his names sake they are honoured by great Princes? And though they seeke not after humane glorie, yet they are venerable, euen in the afflictions of persecution, to al Iudges and people in authoritie, though other<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wise their meannes might haue been perhaps contemptible euen to people of inferiour condition, by reason of the basenes of their birth or seruil condition, if they had remained in the world? Which we may euide<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>tly proue by the exam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple of Abbot <hi>Iohn,</hi> who resideth in the wildernes which bordereth vpon the towne called <hi>Lycus.</hi> For being borne of very meane parentage, he is growne so admirable to almost the whole world for Christ his sake, that the Lords of this world (who by reason of their gouerment are terrible) euen to Kings and Prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces, doe honour him as their Maister; and crauing answer from him from coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tries afarre-of doe commend the state of their Empire, their safegard, and the euents of warres, to his merits and prayers. </q>Thus sayth <hi>Cassian.</hi> To which we may adde, that this is the truest and greatest honour of al the honours which are giuen in this life to men.

But in a Religious state, where there is none of al this, certainly whatsoeuer respect is done them, cometh wholy from the beau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie and vertue of the State itself.

It hapned that he was made Arch-Bishop of <hi>Canterburie,</hi> and continued notwithstanding his Reading; and then
<pb n="404" facs="tcp:15193:216"/>
none of the Cardinals would stirre for him, because before (they said) they ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>noured Vertue in him, wherin they acknowledged themselues to be his in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feriours; but now they might be thought to honour him in respect of his dig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nitie, wherin they were aboue him.<note place="margin">True ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour in Vertue.</note>

For if Religious people suffer sometimes by slanderous and reproachful reports and speaches, it is but seldome, and hapneth not only by malice of the Diuel, that opposeth them but by permission of God to exercise our vertue, to encrease our crowne, to make vs conformable to his Sonne, who foretold his Disciples as much, and in his Disciples al others:<note place="margin">Io. 15.</note>

And in verie deede a farre more hard and cruel seruitude, then that of <hi>Pharao</hi>; because it was not our bodie that was held captiue, wherin people apprehend so much miserie, but it was our soule, which was in captiuitie, the thraldome wherof is much more to be lamented.

That others finde pleasure in other things, comes by corruption; and consequently those things are not absolutly in al respects pleasant, but to them only, that are accordingly disposed. For as when children take a fancie to a thing and loue it, they think for the present, that it is the excellentest thing that can be; and yet when they come to be men, they make no account at al of it; so good people take delight in some things, and wicked people in others; but they only leane to the pleasures of the bodie, that haue not the right tast of sound and vncorrupted pleasure.</p>

Now certainly a spiritual good is greater then the good of the bodie, and man naturally loues it more, and makes more account of it, as we may plainly see, because there is no man, that wil not rather choose to want the sight of his eyes, then the light of his minde, and to be as a beast or a mad man. Besides that, the knowledge of the minde is more noble and more searching, then that which we haue by Sense, as euerie bodie knowes. And as for the coniunction, it is certainly more inward, more firme, and more perfect; more inward, because Sense reacheth no further, then the outward accidents, and rests in the tast, and colour, and such like; a man's vnderstanding searcheth and diueth into the Essence and substance of euerie thing; It is more perfect, because Sense cannot be ioyned with the obiect without motion, which is an imperfect action; and therefore also no sensible pleasure can be al of it togeather, but part of it must passe away, tha<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

<q>I doe not aske, where they wil be, when this life is past; but where are they now? This day hath thrust out yesterday; to morrow wil thrust out the day, in which now we are.

For we cannot stop so much as one howre of the day, wherin we are.

Yet <hi>S. Basil</hi> ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>presseth it naturally in these words: <q>There is more trouble then pleasure in the delights of the bodie. Barrennes, and widdowhood, and iealousie wayte vpon marriage; vnfruitfulnes vpon husbandrie; shipwrack vpon marchan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding; deceiptful practises vpon wealth; the pleasures themselues, the saturitie, the continual vse of them, bring diseases and manie distempers.</q>
                  <hi>S. Gregorie</hi> applieth to this purpose that, which is spoken in holie <hi>Iob</hi> of worldlie people:<note place="margin">
                     <hi>Iob.</hi> 30.7. <hi>S. Greg.</hi> 20. <hi>Mor. c.</hi> 16.</note> 
                  <hi>They that reioyced in the midst of these things, and made account, that vnder thornes were riches.</hi>
                  <q>Their ioy (sayth <hi>S. Gregorie</hi>) is most commonly mingled with vexation; and they are beaten with the things themselues, wherof they are proude. For they cannot without trouble and care either get temporal things, which they haue not; or conserue those, which they haue gotten. To aspire therefore to honour aboue their equals, alwayes to be working some mis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chief, and yet to watch with feare that they may not haue the name of being wicked, certainly doth miserably gal them; but ouercome with the loue of temporal things, they feele not the sting. They reioyce therefore vnder thornes; they, I say, that reioyce in temporal things; and yet not being able to dispense them without vexation, the care, which presseth them, galleth them. They re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mayne vnder thornes, and they esteeme it a pleasure, because they suffer much hardnes for the loue of this life; and yet entangled in the affection of their ouer-greedie desire, they account the verie trouble of their suffering a pleasure.</q>And much more sayth <hi>S. Gregorie</hi> to the same effect, and particularly he like<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neth these kind of people to the Children of <hi>Israel,</hi> that sighed after their pots of <hi>Aegypt,</hi> and their pompions, and onyons, and chibols.
<q>For what is signi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fyed, <hi>sayth he,</hi> by the flesh-pots of <hi>Aegypt,</hi> but the carnal works of this life, which boyle in the sorrowes of tribulation, as in the fire? What are pompions but earthlie sweetnes? What is figured by the onyons and chibols (which most commonly make them weepe that eate them) but the difficulties of this present life, which the louers of it passe not without lamenting, and yet loue it euen with teares. Forsaking therefore the <hi>Manna,</hi> they desired onyons and chibols with their flesh and pompions; because wicked minds contemne the sweet guifts, which they may haue by grace in quiet; and for their carnal plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sures couet the laboursome iournies of this life, though they be ful of teares; they refuse to haue that, wherewith they may reioyce spiritually, and desire greedily that, wherewith they must lame<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t carnally. <hi>Iob</hi> therefore with his truth-telling voice doth reprehend their follie, in that out of an erroneous iudgement they preferre trouble before tranquillitie, harsh things before the milde, sharp before the sweet, te<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>poral before the eternal, things deceiptful before those that be assured.</q>
Thus speaketh <hi>S. Gregorie,</hi> not only truly, as he doth alwaies, but also eloquently, whervnto we may adde another reason out of <hi>S. Bernard,</hi> to wit, that if our mind be sensible of the pleasures of the bodie, to which it is vnited; how much more sensible must it needes be of the pleasures, which properly
<pb n="413" facs="tcp:15193:220"/>
belong vnto itself, and are more neerly and truly in it? For as a man doth relish the busines after another fashion, when his horse feedes vpon his hey, and when himself feedes vpon meate, that is conuenient for him, so it fareth with our soule in regarde of our bodie, which is but, as it were, the beast, which carrieth it.<note place="margin">

               <p n="8">8. Another consideration to proue this,<note place="margin">Spiritual delights proper to man.</note> which we are saying, is, that the more sutable a thing is to our nature, it is also the more pleasing and delightful. For so we see, that men take delight in one kind of foode, beasts in another; and among beasts some feede vpon flesh, others vpon corne, others graze; and euerie kind of thing findes most contentment in that, which agreeth best with the nature, which it hath. The nature of man is to be gouerned by reason; for though he haue also sense, and motion, and the facultie of growing, yet these belong the inferiour part of him; and are not proper to him alone, but common betwixt him and beasts. Reason and vnderstanding is that, which is peoper to Man, and belongeth so neare to the perfection and constitution of his nature, that without it he were not a man, but a beast; and consequently the delights, which are conformable to reason, and grounded in it, are both more sutable to human nature, and for the same cause more plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sing; specially, if we consider withal (as we may iustly) that among the seueral qualities and powers, that are in man, the higher and the more noble the power is, it is also the more pregnant and effectual in operation; so that Reason being farre more noble then Sense, it exerciseth the functions belonging to reason with more perfection and vigour, then Sense can per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>forme the offices belonging to Sense; and as it is more pregnant in al other operations, so it is more apt to take delight in the things, which are agreable vnto it.</p>

Finally,<note place="margin">The diffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rence betwixt corporall and spiri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tual de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lights.</note> whensoeuer we compare these delights togeather, that, which <hi>S.

The difference, <hi>sayth he,</hi> betwixt the delights of the bodie, and of the minde, is this: The delights of the bodie, when we haue them not, breed a burning desire to haue them; and when we take greedily of them, presently through satietie they breed a loathing in him, that takes them.

In spiritual delights, the desire is cold and contemptible, the trial delightful. In the first, desire breedeth saturitie, saturitie loathsomnes; in the second, desire brings saturitie, saturitie againe whetteth our desire of them. For spiritual delights encrease a desire in our hart, while they fil it; because the more we perceaue the right fauour of them, the more knowledge we haue of that, which we must needs loue more eagerly; and therefore we cannot loue them, when we haue them not, because we cannot know the true relish of them. Nothing can expresse more perfectly the difference, which is betwixt the delights of the bodie and of the minde, then that, which <hi>S. Gregorie</hi> heer sayth of them,
<pb n="414" facs="tcp:15193:221"/>
to wit, that the vse of corporal pleasures breeds a loathing of them; but spiritual delights contrariwise the more eagerly we feed vpon them, the more they winne our affection to them.</q>
For as we cannot discerne, which is good wine, and which is bad, better, then by tasting it, and our tast is in fine the best iudge of it; so by duly weighing the ioy, which is true and solid, and also that, which is false and deceiptful, and comparing them togeather, we shal be best able to discouer, how that in the one there is nothing but emptines and falshood, and in the other, truth and soliditie euen beyond expectation, and abundantly enough to delight vs more and more without end.</p>
               <p n="10">10. It is therefore sufficiently apparent both by reason and authoritie of the holie Fathers, that the pleasures of the Mind are the principal and the chiefest of al other pleasures; yet because manie are iealous of that which the holie Fathers say, and think that they goe further, and speake in a more sublime strayne, then humane infirmitie can ordinarily beare, I wil conclude this Chapter with a discourse of <hi>Plato</hi> (besides that,<note place="margin">
                     <hi>Plato in Dial. de Rep.</hi>
                  </note> which I sayd before out of <hi>Aristotle</hi>) where he clearly proueth this, wherof we are speaking.
<q>As hunger and thirst <hi>(sayth he)</hi> are an emptines of the bodie, so ignorance &amp; imprudence are emptinesses of the mind; and as our bodie is filled, when we take corporal sustenance, so our mind with science and knowledge. Which repletion there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore is the more solid? Is it not that, which is made by things, which in them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selues are more truly solid? And which things are to be accounted such, and of a more pure substance, meate and drinke, victuals, and whatsoeuer sustenance, or perswasions of truth, knowledge, and, in a word, al kind of vertue? Certainly we must needs confesse, that that is most solidly and most truly exi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stent, which doth alwaies abide in an immortal and vnchangeable thing, and which itself also is immortal and vnchàngeable (such as is the essence of eue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rie thing, and consequently also the knowledge of it) rather then that, which is in a changeable thing, and itself is changeable; such as are al things per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tayning to the oeconomic of the bodie. Wherefore if it be a delightful thing to be filled with that<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> which is sutable to our nature, the more solid the things be, and the more truly we are filled with them, the more true and more natural pleasure it must needs be, which we enioy by them. And thus it fareth with vs, when our mind is filled. Wherefore people, that are voide of vertue, and giuen to their bellie and the like, neuer tast the least parcel of true and solid pleasure, but as beasts haue their eyes alwaies vpon the ground, and spend their time in doing homage to their bellies; and fight with one another with their heeles, and with their hornes, and with their nayles, for those base and abiect things. And so the pleasures, which they follow, must needes be mingled with manie sorrowes, and are indeede but pictures and shadowes of true pleasure, as the Poet <hi>Stesichorus</hi> sayd of the <hi>Troians</hi>; that, not knowing at al the true <hi>Helene,</hi> they fought only for the imagination of her.</q>

where among other things, he sayth thus:
<q>

                        <note place="margin">S. Paulin. Ep ad Li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cent. vid. Ep Aug. <hi>36.</hi>

                        </gap>y.</l>
                  </q>
That which he sayth of <hi>Rome</hi> in those dayes, that it was powerful to deboish the strong, that is, euen such as might be grounded in vertue, and diuert them from the course therof, may be sayd of al other places in the world. Then he shewes the vanitie and dangers of preferment:
<q>
                     <l>Now hope to rise, now feare to fal, doth throng.</l>
                     <l>Thy hart. Stand sure; 't is worse to fal from high.</l>
                  </q>
And who is there, that can stand sure in so slipperie a place? who is there, that doth not rather stand very tickle? Wherefore he foretelles him also of the late repentance, which experience of such things is wont to bring:
<q>
                     <l>Too late, and then in vaine, thou wilt bewaile</l>
                     <l>Deceiptful hope, and wish to breake this iayle,</l>
                     <l>Which now thou buildst.</l>
                  </q>
For oftimes we rush into the snares and nets at vnawares, &amp; afterwards would fayne breake out of them, and we cannot, vnlesse we looke to ourselues be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times. Wherefore hauing discoursed at large of the miserie of such a kind of life, he inuiteth him to the more easie and more happie seruice of Christ, in this manner:
<q>
                     <pb n="421" facs="tcp:15193:224"/>
                     <l>Shake-of the yoak betimes; Christ's burden's light;</l>
                     <l>His yoak is sweet; his word is truth; his seruice,</l>
                     <l>Freedome; and to stoope to him, is, in right</l>
                     <l>Of sonnes of God, to command ouer vice,</l>
                     <l>And proudest Lords and Kings &amp;c.</l>
                  </q>
And enlarging himself in the comparison between these two liues, sheweth how the seruice of God is true freedome, and the seruice of the world is verie slauerie, to which al such are subiect, as (to vse his phrase) by
<q>
                     <l>Frequenting Court</l>

                     <l>Make choice of miseries.</l>
                  </q>
Where, as you see, he tearmeth the liuing in Rome <hi>(suffering Rome)</hi> as a toyle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>some &amp; a trouble something; a new manner of speach, yet fitly expressing the matter he speakes of;<note place="margin">People that choo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>se to be miserable.</note> and yet more neatly, where he stileth them <hi>voluntarily miserable,</hi> that leade such a life; which is as much to say, as to be twice misera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble. For if a man suffer miserie against his wil, yet he is sound in his iudgeme<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t, which is a great comfort, and not only a comfort, but oftentimes a remedie of his miseries; but he, that loues the miserie in which he is, doth not only erro in his iudgeme<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t, which is of itself a great miserie, but doth not so much as seek to auoid it, and consequently there is no hope of remedie for him.</p>

How much this free<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome from miserie is to be esteemed, may be partly vnderstood by that, which passeth in our bodie. For though we haue no special thing to take pleasure in, yet, if we be in health, if we haue no feuerish distemper vpon vs, if the humours of our bodie be not altered and out of order, we take great pleasure euen in that want of disturbance; as on the other side, it is a great vexation to be troubled with a payne in our side, or in our feete, or in anie other part of vs. The self-same effect therefore, which perfect health and tha<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                  <seg rend="decorInit">I</seg>T is not enough to haue shewed, that a Religious course of life is free from the difficulties and troubles, which are in the world; for a man might say, that though it haue not the troubles of the world, it hath other vexations, which make it irksome and tedious. We wil therefore heer make it plaine, that the whole order and practise of Religious disci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pline is easie and pleasant; a thing contrarie to the conceipt, which vsually people make of it, apprehending a Religious course to be intollerably burden<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>some, as if one should lay a whole hil vpon a man's shoulder;<note place="margin">Vertue agreable to Nature.</note> and therefore that, which we are to say of it, requireth a litle more attention. And to ground ourselues vpon the principles of Nature, we must vnderstand, that nothing is so pleasing and so conformable to Nature, as Vertue. For what is Vertue, if we consider it wel, but Reason cultiuated and perfected? Seing therefore Rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son is as natural to man, as man is to himself, because without it he is not Man, Vertue must consequently be in the same measure agreable vnto him. Which may be proued also by the natural &amp; in-bred inclination and propen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sion, which Man hath to Vertue, manifesting itself in the ioy, which we feele within ourselues, when we doe wel, &amp; the sadnes on the other side, &amp; de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iection of mind, when we doe amisse. If therefore Nature be so desirous of Vertue, the practise of it must needs be easie and pleasant; for so we see it hapneth in euerie thing els.

And though this sensual appetite of ours haue certain motions and inclinations to that which is delightful, which are peculiar to itself, yet in itself, and in euerie motion of it, it hath a reference to the light of Reason; <hi>for otherwise,</hi> sayth <hi>Aristotle, it were in vaine for our betters to repre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hend vs, or our equals to admonish vs, or inferiours to entreate vs.</hi> And it is a strong argument, that it is so; because euerie thing doth naturally take contentment in that, which is like itself, and of the same rank and strayne. Our soule therefore being wholy spiritual, must necessarily be most delighted with things, that are spiritual. Whervpon Abbot <hi>Isaac,</hi> a most holie man (as <hi>Cassian</hi> relateth) compareth our soule to a feather.<note place="margin">

Finally, we shal not neede to demurre long vpon the proof of this point, seing no man can doubt of it, vnlesse he wil wrong the Diuine Wise<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome, and accuse it of imprudence. For hauing created al men to the end, they might purchase eternal felicitie by good works and vpright liuing; it belonged to the self-same Prouidence (the nature wherof is <hi>to dispose al things sweetly</hi>) to make them of such a mold, as might not be repugnant and ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uerse to the end, for which they were created, and draw them from it, but rather further them, and put them forward, as farre as the strength of Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture can goe, howsoeuer of itself alone it is not sufficient and strong enough to beare them quite through. And I see no reason, why we should make anie question, but that God hath dealt so with vs, seing he hath dealt so with al other creatures in the world. For because the end of the Fire is to be aboue al other Elements, God hath put a natural lightnes in it, proportionable to that end; in like manner the Earth is naturally heauie &amp; lumpish, because the Cen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter therof is the midst of the world; &amp; the same is in al things, that haue life, &amp; in others also that haue no life. God therefore holding this course in things so farre inferiour to man, &amp; ordained to ends farre vnequal in dignitie &amp; worth; shal we think, he swarueth from it in a nature, that is the noblest of them al, &amp; ordained to the highest End, that can be? <hi>S.

For as a beast, that hath no reason, cannot per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>forme anie thing, that properly belongs to reason, as, to inferre a Conclusion, to iudge of a thing, to giue aduice, to foresee that which is to come; but Man being endewed with reason, doth these things as easily as vse his hands &amp; feet: so if a man haue not the vocation and spirit of God, which includeth Pouertie, &amp; Obedience, and other vertues, it is wonderful hard for him to be content to haue nothing, and to yeald himself ouer to an other's wil; but if he haue this vocation, he taketh great comfort in it.</p>

Finally, besides Nature and Grace, dailie practise breeds a custome and habit of doing wel, which is another Nature, altogeather as forcible and efficacious as Nature itself; and when it is once gotten and grounded in the mind, al vertuous actions are easie and pleasant.

Religion therefore being nothing els but a continual prac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tise and trading in al kind of vertue, the exercise of vertue must needs grow euerie day easier then other, and in time, as so manie goodlie trees, bring forth abundant fruit, and furnish a Religious soule with plentie, and profit, and heauenlie pleasure. This is the habit, which <hi>Cassian</hi> describeth in a certain place in these words,<note place="margin">
                     <hi>Cassian. Coll.</hi> 11. <hi>c.</hi> 9.</note> to wit:
<q>When a soule is transformed into a habit of vertue, that is, when a man hath so accustomed himself vnto it, and gotten so much loue of it, that he thinks it the pretiousest thing in the world, and takes the transgression of vertue, or the poyson of sinne, to be the grieuousest torment that can be; when a man is come to this, he must needs take more contentment in his sober and continent life, then others doe in their incontinencie and riot; the flower of chastitie must needs be sweeter to him, then the filth of sensual pleasure to them that are sensual; finally, he cannot but reioyce more when he is humbled, and hapneth vpon an occasion of suffering for Christ, then worldlie ambitious people in the applause, and glorie, and preferments, which they so eagerly hunt after.</q>
               </p>
               <p n="6">6. Vpon these and the like grounds we constantly auerre, as in the be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginning, that a Religious life is so farre from being harsh and difficult, that it is rather wonderful sweet and pleasant. And we may adde the testimonie of <hi>Reginaldus</hi> a Dominican-Friar, one of the first and principal companions of <hi>S. Dominick.</hi> He was a rich wealthie man in the world, and liued daintily at ease; after he had vndertaken that rigorous and paineful kind of life, they that knew him before, often asked him (not without some astonishment) whether he were not mightily troubled with it; and he alwaies answered with a chearful hart and countenance:<note place="margin">
                     <hi>Reginaldus.</hi>
                  </note>
                  <q>I would haue you know<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> that al these things are so sweet and pleasant vnto me, that often I haue been grie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ued at hart, that I liue so easily; and haue thought, that I merited nothing in this life by reason of it.</q>
This was <hi>Reginaldus</hi> his answer; and manie more, yea al good Religious people, if they were asked, would answer the same. I myself haue heard manie speake to the same effect, and complaine grieuously, as if they lead an idle and lasie life; wheras notwithstanding they applyed themselues Religiously to those courses, which in a Secular eye, measuring al by Sense, seeme so harsh and rigid.</p>

As therefore they, that are continually haled and hanted with these turbulent affections, as with so manie furies, are extreamly vnhappie; so they, that are voyde of passion, and haue al things quiet within them, must needs enioy that incomparable peace, which surpasseth al vnder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>standing, and leade a most sweet and pleasant life.</q>

For as Phisitians prescribe abstinence from certain meates that are hurtful and breed il humours in a man's bodie; so Religion barreth al things, by which disorder may rise; for that, which <hi>S.

And as the corne is neuer at rest, but throwne now against one side, now against the other, and in continual motion; so the authour of al wickednes, the Diuel, doth continually molest, and trouble, and disquiet them, hauing once intangled them in worldlie businesses, and giueth them not an howres respit. This was <hi>S. Macarius</hi> his conceipt of worldlie people. And <hi>S. Iohn Chrysostome</hi> wil tel vs,<note place="margin">S. <hi>Iohn Chrysost. Hom.</hi> 69. <hi>in Matth.</hi>

This is the first help, which Religion affords towards the alaying of the heate of our Passions.</p>

                  <note place="margin">Two things set our pas<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sions on fire.</note>5. Another medecine it hath, which takes away the verie root of the disease. Two things set our Passions on fire: the apprehension of good, and the appre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hension of euil. For when a thing is represented vnto vs as good, the verie ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prehension, which Nature hath of a thing sutable vnto it, stirres vp loue; if we haue not the thing, loue breedes desire; if we haue it, it breedes content and pleasure. Contrariwise if we conceite a thing to be euil or hurtful; we hate it; hatred makes vs fly from it and auoyd it; if we cannot auoyd it, but that it wil come vpon vs, then comes grief and sadnes. In like manner, in that part of our Appetite, which is the seate of Anger, two seueral motions rise vpon the apprehension of good, to wit, hope and despaire, two vpon the appre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hension of imminent euil, feare and audacitie; one vpon the euil which is pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sent, to wit, anger, which differs from sadnes, in respect it doth not yeald to the euil, that presseth vpon vs, but striueth against it and resisteth it. Seing therefore the whole troupe of our Affections is lead by this one Apprehension of Good and Euil, looke what apprehension or iudgement we make of good and euil, such shal we find the desires and affections of our mind to be.<note place="margin">Religion preuents al trouble.</note> Now the whole drift of Religion is to alter our apprehension from earthlie things, which falsly vsurpe the name of good, to spiritual things, which are truly good, and indeed to rid vs wholy of them, and free our hands from them, to the end we may attend the more perfectly to the pursuite and purchase of that, which is spiritual only; which whosoeuer doth compasse, doth as it were at one blow cut-of al the roots and strings, that feed Passio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>. For what should trouble a man, that is thus setled? what shal he need to be afrayd of? least his marchandise perish by shipwrack? or his corne &amp; wine by hayle? or his sonne dye vnder age? or least men be offended with him? or he leese the fauour of his Prince? He hath voluntarily stolen himself from al these things,<note place="margin">The diffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rence be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>twixt tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poral and spiritual things.</note> and consequently preuented al<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> such casualties, and made himself impregnable for whatsoeuer assault of For<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tune.</p>
               <p n="6">6. Finally, there is this mayne difference betwixt temporal and spiritual things. Temporal things are easily lost, and subiect to infinit casualties;
<pb n="430" facs="tcp:15193:229"/>
and therefore the getting of them, and the holding, are alwaies ful of endlesse care and anguish: Spiritual things are giuen vs by God; &amp; no power vpon earth nor in hel can take them from vs against our wil; and consequently they that trade in them, liue voyde of al feare, sauing that which the Prophet calleth <hi>a holie feare,</hi> which keepeth vs alwaies in subiection to God, acknowledging his infinit power ouer vs; and this feare is not only quiet and peaceable, but (which a man would wonder at) encreaseth confidence and securitie.</p>
               <p n="7">7. The endeauour of euerie Religious man in particular togeather with the assistance of his gouernours and Superiours, is moreouer no smal help to the rooting-out of al disordered motions; specially being a thing, which eue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rie one doth apply himself with feruour vnto, as the chief exercise and ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ploit, in which he is to play his prize.

For as fulnes of meate, and drink, and dayntie fare doth dead the spirit, and quicken sense; so sobrietie tames that part of vs, which gapes after pleasure, and makes it not so forward to kick; as a beast, that is abridged of his oates,<note place="margin">

               </p>
               <p n="7">7. These be the helps, by which Religion brings a Soule to that quiet state of mind we speake of; and composing and keeping downe our Passions, deliuers the command and rule into the hands of Reason,<note place="margin">

               <p n="3">3. Now why may not Religion be called also the House of Prayer,<note place="margin">Religion the House of prayer.</note> which God doth so much honour as to stile it His House; seing it requireth so much exercise of prayer, and affordeth so much commoditie of performing it, as it ought to be performed? For first Religion riddeth vs of al outward care not only of following husbandrie, or trading in marchandize and such like ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gotiations of greater consequence, but of those, which are of lesse note, as the care of household-busines, education of children, finally of al. These are the banes of Meditation and Contemplation, not only because they take vp al our time, but much more because they stirre vp so manie passions of anger, and feare, and sadnes, according to the seueral euents which happen. These
<pb n="432" facs="tcp:15193:230"/>
Passions partly disquiet our mind, that it can settle to nothing, and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sequently absolutly hinder Contemplation; partly they do so ouerwhelme it, that they dead our spirits, and suck-out al the iuyce, which is in vs.
<q>For that,<note place="margin">

Which if it be true, certainly the true exer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cise of prayer is as rare in the world, as these hindrances and inconueniences are frequent in it; and contrariwise in Religion it is easie to practise it; because the state itself hath alreadie barred al these impediments.</p>
               <p n="4">
                  <note place="margin">Other helps of Prayer: as, Chastitie.</note>4 Moreouer Chastitie and a single life is a great help to Prayer; which in reason euerie bodie may see to be true, and the Apostle sayth it, commending Virginitie and a single life; because (as he speaketh) <hi>it giues a man leaue to pray to our Lord without hindrance.</hi> The reason wherof among others, as I take it,<note place="margin">1. <hi>Cor.</hi> 7.35.</note> is, because as our mind growes lumpish, and beareth alwayes downewards to base and earthlie things, by the vse of corporal pleasure: so by continencie it becomes light and quick, and able, as it were with certain wings, to life itself vp to God; the puritie, which is in itself, furthering the coniunction of it to that puritie,<note place="margin">Humilitie &amp; Pouertie.</note> which is God. The humilitie also of so poore an estate, and so farre from al human glorie, is a special disposition to Prayer. For as we reade of our Sauiour, that in his life-time he louingly embraced the little ones, that were brought vnto him, and checked his Disciples that would haue forbidden them, saying: <hi>Let the little-ones come to me; for of such is the Kingdome of heauen.</hi>
                  <note place="margin">
                     <hi>Matth.</hi> 19.141</note> So we haue iust cause to think, that he practiseth the same now in heauen; and conuerseth familiarly with such as be little. For if he made so much demonstration of loue towards them, that had nothing humble in them, but the tendernes of their age, how much greater signes of loue wil he shew to them, that haue voluntarily humbled themselues, and brought themselues to that excesse of Pouertie and meane estate, which the Reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gious liue in? So that for these and manie other reasons there can be no doubt, but that Religion is the House of Prayer, that is, the most com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>modious, and most conuenient place that can be, to exercise our mind in prayer, and continue our thoughts in contemplation of heauenlie things.</p>

And certainly if we find so much delight in con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>versing with men of learning and wisedome, that we can spend whole dayes with them to our great contentment and satisfaction; what shal we think of the communication and conuersation, which we may haue continually with the holie Angels, to whome we are so manie wayes obliged for their charitie &amp; care ouer vs? or with the other Saints of Heauen, that know by experience, what it is to carrie this burden of flesh with which we are loaded? or with the Queene of Saints and Angels, then whome vnder God there is nothing in this world more beautiful, nothing that thought or affection can fixe itself vpon, with more delight and sweetnes?</p>
               <p n="6">6. What shal I say of GOD himself? First, the infinitnes of his Nature,<note place="margin">The de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>light, which is in thinking of God.</note> his endlesse Goodnes, Power, and al things of excessiue perfection conteyned in it, affordeth a Soule a boundles scope to walk in; and walking without end, it cannot but be absorpt in a bottomlesse deapth of delight. From thence againe reflecting vpon the consideration of the benefits, which God hath powred forth vpon vs, either out of the superabundant bountie of his loue and good wil, or out of the natural inclination, as I may say, which he hath to liberalitie; and much more vpon those, in which so great a Maiestie hath taken so much paynes for our sakes; calling to mind his sorrowes, his torments, the manger, his pouertie, his whipping, his crowne of thornes, his Crosse, and pondering euerie thing with attention, and seazing vpon them in contempla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, as vpon an infinit treasure of wealth and riches now belonging to our<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selues, and made to our vse; what ioy, what gladnes, what contentment must a Soule needes take in it? This causeth a fountain of teares to gush forth from our eyes, this melts vs into a most sweet veyne of weeping, this maketh our hart to leape for ioy within vs, and diffuseth itself to our verie flesh; beholding such infinit testimonies of the Diuine loue towards vs, which of itself is enough to rauish vs with delight; and againe tasting so manie wayes of the fruits of this loue, by his heauenlie care and prouidence ouer vs, grace in this life, and assured hope of eternal blisse in the life to come. And though we lay aside the consideration of the profit, which comes vnto vs, the verie approaching to God by prayer and communication with him, is a thing of another world. For as they, that come neare the fire, grow warme by the heat of it, and whatsoeuer is mingled with honie, doth taste of the sweetnes of honie; so whosoeuer conioyneth himself with God, and, as I may say, plungeth himself into the fountain of al goodnes and happines, must needes by in great measure happie; as we reade in the holie Scripture, that <hi>Moyses</hi> by the communication,<note place="margin">
                     <hi>Ex.</hi> 34.15.</note> which he held with God, receaued so much light inwardly in his mind, that it was seen in his face, as two hornes in his forehead.</p>

<q>It was part of the liberalitie of God, not only to lay before vs the reward of eternal life, but to promise vs spiritual ioyes euen in this life.

<q>A Christian, <hi>sayth he,</hi> hath better sights to behold, if he wil: he hath delights, which are ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lie and truly profitable, if he be think himself; and to omit those, which he can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not yet behold, he hath the beautie of this world, which he may worthily stand to consider and admire.

And so discourseth at large of the wonderful works of God in Nature, shewing how a Christian may take much more contentment by contemplating these things, then anie man can doe in beholding a play or anie such idle trifle, wherewith the vulgar is so much lead away.

<pb n="441" facs="tcp:15193:234"/>
he may suffer by another, that which he did to others. If he see a man more powerful then himself, he feares he may oppresse him. If he see a poore man, he suspects him for a theef; and it is no smal care which he hath, least the things themselues, which he hath gathered, waste of their owne nature, and by want of looking-to; and in al things feare itself being a torment, he miserably suffers, whatsoeuer he feares he may suffer.</q>
Thus spake <hi>S. Gregorie</hi> very truly, iudiciously obseruing, that though there were no danger from abroad to be feared, that which is intrinsecal and in-bred in the verie nature of euerie temporal thing, can neuer be wanting, to wit, that things of themselues grow old and go to decay, and cannot be preserued without excessiue care, but are like a house, that is conti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nually panching, vnlesse a man be alwaies vnderpropping and bolstering it vp, and haue his eye and care perpetually vpon it. And consequently the more wealth we heape togeather, the more we encrease with payne and sollicitude; and the verie sollicitude and labour about it, bereaues vs quite of the ioy, which is imagined in it. It is therefore no smal happines and comfort, to be free from so manie vexations, specially about things, which in themselues are so base, and indeed vnprofitable.</p>

The necessities of Nature may be supplyed with anie kind of meate. Cold and hunger are driuen away with ordinarie food and cloathing. Whervpon the Apostle sayth: Hauing food and cloa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing, let vs be content therewith. Daynties and choice of curious di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>shes are nourishers of auarice. It is an excessiue comfort to a Soule, to be contented with a little, and treade the world vnder foot, to exchange the power, and daynties, and pleasures therof (for which, riches are so greedily sought after) with coorse fare and a poore garment, and think itself wel rewarded with it.

<q>For it is not (sayth <hi>S. Iohn Chrysostome</hi>) the qualitie of the meat, but the disposition of the people, that brings contentment in banckets. If a man come hungrie to table, anie ordinarie dish wil please him better, then your rare compounds and exquisit sawces: wheras they, that sit downe before they be hungrie, as vsually rich people doe, though they haue verie dayntie fare before them, they find no tast in it, because their stomack is not in order for it; which both experience teacheth, and holie Scripture also in these words:<note place="margin">

<q>Pouertie considered in itself is a scorching and payneful fire: but if a man cast himself voluntarily into it, and being in it giue thanks to God, his bonds fal asunder, and the fire goeth out; or if it doe not goe out, in steed of the scorching flame, he feeleth a coole dew, which is much more wonderful. This is plainly to be perceaued in the serua<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ts of God, who vow Pouertie; for in their Pouertie, they are richer, then the rich

of the world, and in the midst of the fire, there desce<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>deth a most pure dew vpon them. Not to desire to be rich, is a heauenlie dew naturally refreshing the soule; and as the Three Children by contemning the command of the King, grew more conspicuous then the King himself: so they that set al the rich pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sents of this word at naught, are the more respected and honoured for it by the world itself.</q>
This is the discourse of <hi>S. Iohn Chrysostom.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="7">7. But because the verie name of Pouertie is growne odious, and the onlie noyse of it doth instantly bring a world of miseries into our thoughts, let vs diue into the ground of this errour, and see, how people come to be so much deceaued.<note place="margin">Two kinds of Pouer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie, very different.</note> The ground of the errour is, because (as we touched once before) there is a kind of Pouertie, which indeed is base and vnworthie, and withal very irksome and tedious; a vulgar kind of pouertie, as we may cal it, which people apprehending, and not weighing things with their due cir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cumstances, but carried away with the likenes of the name, are iealous, least Religious Pouertie haue the self same inconueniences annexed vnto it, which that other hath. But it is not so; for they differ in manie things, but chiefly in two. For first, the Pouertie of the world growing vpon necessitie, and not of vertue, is alwayes accompanied with a desire of being rich; and desiring it, they seeke to compasse it; and not being able to compasse it, thence comes their grief, and sadnes, and woeful cares. Religious people voluntarily choo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sing to be poore, and being desirous euer to remaine so, are not only free from al trouble of mind, but doe not so much as feele the want, in which they are, because they desire and loue it. To which purpose <hi>Seneca</hi> sayd truly: <hi>It is much one,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">
                     <hi>Sen. Ep</hi> 110.</note> 
                  <hi>not to desire a thing, and to haue it.</hi> And consequently this kind of Pouertie is so farre from bringing trouble and disquiet, that a man hath ful as much contentment in it, as if he had al the riches in the world.</p>

                  <note place="margin">The com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fort of the Prouide<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ce of God.</note>8. The other difference is, that Religious Pouertie hath a great stay and comfort (which other poore people ordinarily haue not) in the care and prouidence of God, and his vndoubted promise. For (as <hi>S. Francis</hi> was went to say) there passeth a kind of couenant and bond betwixt God and Reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gious people; they on their part forsaking al things, and God on his part promising to maintayne them,<note place="margin">

Wherfore if a crow, as meane a bird as it is, haue naturally so much loue, that it brin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>geth the yong-ones meate to the nest, when they cal for it, and goeth for it a-farre of; shal we not with farre more reason think, that God wil haue the like care of those, whom he hath begotten, and bestowed vpon them a life incomparably more excellent?</p>
               <p n="9">9. Nay Religious Pouertie is yet more to be admired and loued, because it is free from al the inconueniences of worldlie riches, as we shewed before, and hath notwithstanding al the commodities, which worldlie wealth can bring a man, &amp; neuer wanteth necessarie sustenance, prouided by other folkes labours, and sent-in by the bountiful goodnes of Almightie God; which addeth greatly to the pleasantnes of this life, wherof we are speaking. For when a man vnderstands truly, that the Soueraigne King of Kings hath so particular a care to prouide al things necessarie for him, and experienceth daily
<pb n="445" facs="tcp:15193:236"/>
so manie euident tokens of this care; how can it choose but sauour more sweetly to him, then al the riches of the world besides? We might testifye this be very manie examples of holie men; but <hi>S. Francis</hi> shal serue for al, because he did particularly affect this vertue of Pouertie, and often discouered the manie benefits of it, and once in particular the pleasantnes of it, by this occasion.</p>
               <p n="10">10. As he trauelled into France, he sat downe to dinner at the edge of a fountaine,<note place="margin">The trea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sure of Pouertie.</note> with his Companion <hi>Masseus</hi>; and powring forth the peeces of broken bread, which they had begged betwixt them from doore to doore as they went, manie of the peeces being moldie and hard, the <hi>Saint</hi> exulting in spirit, and turning to his Brother, began to summon him to giue thanks to God for so excessiue a treasure of Pouertie, &amp; repeated often this word <hi>treasure,</hi> raysing his voice euerie time a note higher. His Brother <hi>Masseus</hi> asked him, what that treasure was, seing themselues in such apparent want of al necessa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries, and hauing neither meate nor wine, nor table to eate on. The Saint answered: This is the excessiue benefit, which I speake of, that God hath supplyed al our wants, and sent vs this bread and this water, and this stone to dine on. And going from thence into the next Church that was vpon the way, he earnestly beseeched God to giue him and al his Brethren a particular loue of holie Pouertie; and prayed with a great feruour, that his face did seeme to be on a burning fire. In this feruour, turning to his Brother <hi>Masseus</hi> with his armes wide open, he called him vnto him with a lowde voice. <hi>Masseus</hi> astonished cast himself into the armes of the holie Saint; but <hi>S. Francis</hi> did so burne with that diuine fire, that the breath that came from his mouth, car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ried <hi>Masseus</hi> manie cubits high into the ayre; in which posture, as he often after related, he found in himself such inward sweetnes, as in al his life-time before, he had neuer felt the like. Then <hi>S. Francis</hi> spake thus vnto him:
<q>Let vs goe to <hi>Rome,</hi> to beg of the holie Apostles <hi>S. Peter</hi> and <hi>S. Paul,</hi> that they wil teach vs to possesse, as we ought, and with fruit, this so excellent a treasure of Pouertie; for it is so rare and so diuine, and we so vile and abiect, that we are vnworthie to contayne it in such vessels as ours are. It is a vertue deriued into vs from heauen, teaching vs voluntarily to treade vnder foot al earthlie things, and taketh away al impediments, that the soule of man may freely, and with al expedition conioyne itself with his Lord and God.</q>

So that this drawing and cleauing of man to other men, being so agreable to Nature, the effecting of it must needs be ful of delight and pleasure.</p>

For there is no man that would not choose a poore and meane estate in companie of other men, rather then a life in al other respects most happie, vpon condition, that he should see no man. And from this principle, both <hi>Aristotle,</hi> and al other ancient learned writers doe deriue the chiefest commendation of Friendship, not so much in re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gard we stand in need of one another's help (though this be something) as by reason of the natural inclination, which we haue to loue. To which purpose <hi>Laertius</hi> recordeth, that <hi>Aristotle</hi> was wont to cal Friendship, the greatest Good of al good things. Which perhaps <hi>Aristotle</hi> tooke from <hi>Socrates,</hi>

Which if we grant, we may easily also discouer, how farre the comfort of Religious Conuersation doth extend itself, and how much pleasure they feele in the mutual loue betwixt them, finding themselues to loue, and to be so intirely loued; and both being so natural to euerie bodie, as nothing more.</p>
               <p n="3">3. Now if we consider,<note place="margin">True frie<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>d<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ship rare in the world.</note> that of this kind of true friends, which the Philo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sophers describe vnto vs, there were scarce three or foure couple to be picked out of so manie Ages, such as the bloudie Tyrants themselues did enuie,
<pb n="450" facs="tcp:15193:239"/>
how farre more fruitful and more happie is Religion, where we finde so manie swarmes of men so intirely linked togeather in the bond of Charitie, that we may truly say, so manie persons, so manie vnseparable companions, so manie bosome-friends, so manie louing brethren both in hart, &amp; effect, and name? If we diue to the bottome of that, which is commonly called Friend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ship, we shal hardly find in this world anie worthie to beare the name. For they that loue for profit or for pleasure, loue not their friend, but themselues; and such loue cannot be called Friendship; for in like manner we loue our lands &amp; our cattle; or speaking of men, we loue a Phisician or a Marriner, when we haue vse of them,<note place="margin">Vertue the ground of Friendship. <hi>Arist.</hi> 3. <hi>Eth. c</hi> 3. <hi>&amp;</hi> 4.</note> or a common leaster, for the pleasure we take in his wit. The grounds therefore of true friendship is Vertue and Honestie; and that, which dependeth vpon this string, is the onlie solid and constant friendship. <hi>Aristotle</hi> speaketh to this purpose almost word for word; and the self-same reason conuinceth, that perfect friendship is rare, except it be among Reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gious people, who haue no other ground of their loue and coniunction, but Religion and Vertue; and consequently hauing so perfect friendship among them, it is also euident, that they must needs enioy al the commodities, and fruits, and pleasures therof, which the ancient Philosophers reckon to be very manie.</p>

                  <note place="margin">Likenes a second ground of pleasure.</note>4. Another ground of pleasure in conuersation, is likenes, which doth so much the more winne men's affections, by how much Nature is of itself exceeding greedie, as I may say, and extremely passionate, where it findes that sympathie and similitude; which among Religious people is more abso<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lute then in anie other thing. For they agree not only in nature as men, or in Fayth and beleefe, as Christians; but in life, and conuersation, and proiects, and intentions, in their endeauours, orders, and employments, in their verie habit and cloathing; which must needs wonderfully enflame their affections and their loue towards one another; and loue, the more ardent it is, the more sweetnes it bringeth with it. For as euerie bodie takes delight to liue, and to enioy himself, and cannot be truly wearie of himself; so the more inward our affections are towards other men, and the neerer they draw to this degree of vnion with ourselues, the more delightful they are. And if it be so in al men, as we experience it in our children and kinsfolke, louing them though they be wicked or deformed;<note place="margin">Vertue on forceth loue.</note> and the more we loue them, the more we de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>light to conuerse with them; to what height wil this pleasure rise, where vertue meetes with this linck of friendship? For vertue, wheresoeuer it is, doth constraine a man to loue it, as we finde in those, whome we neuer saw, or perhaps were once our enemies: for if we perceaue anie incling of vertue in them, it silently speakes to our harts, to be friends with them. If therefore it make strangers friends; how much easier and more inwardly wil it binde those vnto vs, with whome we daily conuerse, and of whose vertue and Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion we are the more assured, the more familiarly we deale with them? So manie in the world take pleasure in hunting, and horse-races, and gallant ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parrel, and in their buildings, and in being popular, it were most absurd to think, that these pleasures are comparable to the pleasure; which a man may take in a soule adorned with vertue and holines of life, with ample returne also of loue for loue. <hi>Plato</hi> sayth truly and elegantly, that if Vertue could be

                  </note> it would wonderfully enflame the loue of people towards it. But in Religion in verie deede we see it; for as we see not the soule, which is in the bodie, in itself, yet we see it in the effects, in the motion, in the speech, in the discourse, which it makes, and so clearely, that we can no more doubt of it, then if we saw it with our corporal eyes: so we see Vertue in the acts therof, as if it were really before vs. We see Charitie extend itself to the seruice and tendance of our Brethren; we see Humilitie stooping to seruile offices, and often humbling itself vnto them, in Religion; we see Patience in enduring hardnes and embracing the Crosse; finally we see al other Vertues of the mind, and haue them in our eyes, when they walke out before vs, about the careful performance of their seueral duties.</p>
               <p n="5">5. And besides this comelines of Vertue and Sanctitie, there be manie other things in most Religious people,<note place="margin">Religious people eminent for their natural parts. 1. <hi>Cor.</hi> 12.10.</note> for which we ought in reason highly to esteeme and desire their conuersation.

<q>Let vs giue care (sayth <hi>S. Bede</hi> discoursing of this kind of Pouertie) to the ioyful promises of our Lord and Sauiour, let vs see how out of the special fauour of his goodnes he promiseth them that follow him, not only the rewards of eternal life, but excellent guifts also in this pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sent life. <hi>Euerie one that shal leaue house, or brethren, or land, for my sake, shal receaue a hundred-fold.</hi>
                  </q>
For he that renounceth earthlie loue and possessions to follow Christ, the more he profiteth in his loue, the more he shal find that wil be glad to embrace him with inward affection, and maintayne him with their outward substance. The first degree therefore of this hundred-fold in this world, is to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceaue it euen in these outward things.</p>

And what shal we need to stand alleaging manie authorities? If it be pleasure which we seeke in these earthlie things, we see where it is to be had farre more abundant and more solid.

Our Sauiour did not answer him: Hast thou forgotten thy po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uertie? what hast thou left, that the whole world should be turned-ouer vnto thee? He forsooke a great deale, my Brethren, he forsooke very much. He for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sooke not only al that he had, but al that he desired to haue. What man is there so poore, that doth not swel with the hopes of this world? who is there that doth not dayly couet to encrease that which he hath? This couetous mind is that which they cut off. It was once ayming at an immensitie of wealth; they confined it; and shal we say they left nothing? No certainly; <hi>Peter</hi> forsooke the whole world, and the whole world was turned-ouer vnto him, as hauing nothing, and possessing al things.</q>
Manie doe the like; they that haue little, doe this, and become fruitful sparrowes. Al this is of <hi>S.

They that were about him, much am ze<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                  </gap>, asked him how he felt himself; but he gaue them no other answer but as before: <hi>Al is true, which thou hast sayd, ô Lord</hi> IESV. And some of them whispering to themselues, and saying that they feared he was distracted with his paine, and spake idely, he spake thus vnto them:
<q>That which I said, I sayd in my perfect senses; for our Lord in the Ghospel hath promised, that if a man renounce the wealth of this world, and al conuersation with his kindred, for his loue, he shal receaue a hundred-fold in this life. And this I find now by experience. For this very excessiue sharp torment is so sweet vnto me for the hope of the mercies of God which I feele in it, that I would not haue been without this grief, not only for al the world which I left, but not<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> if it had been a hundred times as much more. And if I, that am a wicked sinner, feele that these paynes are a hundred times sweeter vnto me, then al my ancient worldlie happines, what is that which good and feruent Religious people haue in their spiritual ioyes and comforts? For it is most certain that anie spiritual ioy, though it be but in hope, is a hundred thou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sand times greater, then whatsoeuer secular ioy actually possessed.</q>
These were the words of this holie man: and when he spake them, al that heard him, were much astonished, specially to heare a man, that had no learning, conceaue and vtter such things so pertinently; and thereby they were the more assured, that what he sayd, came indeed from the Holie-Ghost, that dwelt in his hurt.</p>

For as the fertilnes of a peece of ground ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peares, if it naturally yeald a hudred for one; and if anie particular man reape not so much, the goodnes of the soyle is not the cause of it, but the negligence or want of skil of him that ploughes it, or tilles it not as it ought to be tilled: The same of Religion; of itself it is a fat soyle, and the goodnes of it appeares chiefly, and to the admiration of al the world, in such eminent Saints as they are, whom we men<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tioned; if we doe not find the like profit by it, we cannot lay anie blame vpon Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion, but the fault is in vs. And yet this verie consideration ought in reason to animate &amp; encourage vs to be the more diligent, knowing what plentie of fruit we may reape of our labours, and what abundance others haue reaped.

They should rather reflect, how freely, and liberally, and profusedly he powreth forth the rest of his benefits for the sustenance of this natural life of ours. He ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>keth the Sunne to rise day by day, and giueth rayne to the earth in due season; he furnisheth the world with plentie of corne, and wine, &amp; oyle, and al other fruits, not only sufficiently to supply our necessities, but abundantly for pleasure and pastime. And vpon whom doth he bestow these things?

But God standing in need of nothing, and abounding with infinit wealth, which neuer can be exhaust by giuing, hath no other motiue of being bountiful towards his creatures, but his owne louing nature and goodnes, infinitly inclined to doe good to others. This is that which drawes him to be so liberal, and so royal in his guifts, &amp; so open-handed towards al, and not to regard so much the deserts of men in it, as his owne goodnes and bountie. This is also the ground of that other noble and more admirable proceeding of his, to wit, that oftimes he powreth forth his guifts more largely vpon them that are not so per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect, and haue not profited so much in vertue, then vpon others, not that they haue deserued better, but because they haue more need. For he dealeth with vs as a louing father, who though he tender the good of al his children, seemeth notwith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>standing in a manner to take no thought for them that are in health; but if anie of them be sick, he spares neither for physick nor physicians, nor the greatest dayn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties that can be gotten; Or as a husbandman, or gardener, that among the trees which he hath care of, looketh little after those that are wel growne; but is con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinually watering, and fencing, and vnderpropping those that are weak and ten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der.

Though what need we stand so long vpon our defence for a Religious State in this kind? as if Secular people, in whose behalf these obiections are made against Religion,<note place="margin">The diffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culties of a Secular life intol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lerable.</note> had nothing to suffer, no sorrow, no grief to struggle with; wheras indeed their sorrowes, and mise<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries, and afflictions are farre greater, and not only the poorer sort among them, and they that haue smal meanes to liue on, and a heauie charge of house-hold and chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren lying vpon them, groane vnder this burden; but they that haue the world at wil, and are generally accounted happie, though outwardly they make a fayre shew, are inwardly galled with infinit troubles &amp; vexations. And their sorrowes are the more intollerable, because they are destitute of heauenlie comforts, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out which it is a verie hel to liue. What likelihood is there of anie such thing in Religion? the causes of whatsoeuer trouble may happen, being wonderful slight in themselues, and easie to take away, and sometimes such, as it is better to contemne them, or laugh at them, or perhaps to loue them, &amp; willingly to embrace them. On the one side therefore the occasions of difficultie in Religion are very smal, and in a

                  <seg rend="decorInit">V</seg>Pon the former grounds we may easily answer another imputation, which people lay vpon Religious courses, to wit, that they depriue a man of whatsoeuer is comfortable to flesh and bloud. For though it be true (as it hath been sufficiently proued) that no state vnder the cope of heauen is so capable, and so fruitful of spiritual delights as Religion is; yet it may perhaps stumble some bodie, that there is no place in it for the delights of Sense, without which the ioy, which man hath vpon earth, is maymed, and as it were lame of one side. For Man being a compound of bodie &amp; soule, there want not them, that think they are neuer wel, though their mind feast it, if their flesh, as I may say, be kept fasting. And it sticks the more in their stomack, because the pleasures of the mind are ayrie &amp; subtil, &amp; not so easie to be perceaued; the pleasures of Sense are more palpable, and plaine for euerie bodie to see; so that if a man haue the fi<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

For it hapneth oftentimes, that we haue not diuers things, which we haue no need of, nor haue no great desire of them. For example, a man hath not feathers like a bird, nor hornes like a beast, nor scales like a fish, nor diuers other things which other creatures haue; neither doe we desire to haue them, or because we haue them not, doe we think ourselues the worse. The matter therefore is in
<pb n="482" facs="tcp:15193:255"/>
our desire, and consequently he that desires not a thing, want it not, And so they, that are desirous of honour or wealth, if they haue it not, are troubled, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause they want it: but they that desire it not, cannot be sayd to want it, because they are not sorie they haue it not.</p>
               <p n="4">4. And further, it is much more delightful not to desire a thing, then to desire it,<note place="margin">It is more delightful to desire a thing then to haue it.</note> and withal to haue it. For so we see, that they that are mad after their bodilie pleasures, when they haue their fil of them, take much more pleasure in abstay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning from them, then in continuing in them. Is it not therefore much better to doe that betimes, which time brings them to choose? and out of vertue, and vpon good aduice to resolue vpon that before hand, which disordered fulnes forceth them vnto? And yet we cannot grant, that they are both filled alike to their con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tentment. For if we speake of the fulfilling of our desires (in which people ima<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

For why doth anie man desire the pleasures of the bodie, but to haue content and ioy in them?

                  <note place="margin">Nothing in earthlie things worth the taking vp.</note>6. Againe; what is there in these earthlie delights, why they should be so much desired or sought for?

<pb n="483" facs="tcp:15193:255"/>
now of that itching delight, which egs a man on so much to these pleasures. What great matter of commoditie can these transitorie and perishable and earthlie things bring a man, that they should be so much esteemed? What is it to haue a board daintily serued, and curiously set-forth with excessiue cost and magnificence? or to goe to a play? What is there in a garden, or in a guilded coach, or in a long trayne of attendance, that, I doe not say a Saint, but an ordinarie man of iudge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment should be taken with it? Besides that, if it be ioy and contentment which we seeke in these things, as I sayd before, contentment is not so much in fulnes, as in sobrietie and temperance;<note place="margin">Sobrietie ful of con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tentment.</note> specially, when with temperance so manie other daynties concurre as Religious pouertie doth afford, and are so farre from being found in the greatest delicacies of rich men, that al their pleasures are continually mingled with infinit corrasiues;<note place="margin">

               </p>
               <p n="12">12. Finally we must vnderstand, that Religious people doe not so much depriue themselues of the pleasures of the bodie, as change them for better. For when a soule meeteth with so manie fountains of heauenlie comforts, and hath so manie vessels to fil with them,<note place="margin">Religious people change for better com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>forts.</note> as I sayd before there were heads of these com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>forts in Religion, the comfort and sweetnes which it feeles, remaynes not wholy in the soule, but diffuseth itself further, and redounds to sense, and to our natu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral appetites, and also to our bodie, by reason of the neerenes of one to the other, and the connexion which is betwixt them. Which is the cause why the Prophet sayd: <hi>My soule and my flesh haue exulted in the liuing God.</hi> And the Wise-man in the Prouerbs:<note place="margin">

                  <hi>A ioyful mind maketh flourishing yeares, a sad spirit drieth vp the bones.</hi> For as we see the bodie pines away with the grief of the mind, so it hath part also of the ioyes of the mind, so farre as it is capable of them.</p>
               <p n="13">13. Which things considered,<note place="margin">Religion the plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>santer place for the bodie.</note> who can make anie question, whether the World or Religion be the pleasanter place euen for the bodie? For though it be not, as I confesse, inuited euerie day in Religion to a bancket, to dan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cing, to merrie meetings, to hunting-matches, and the like; it hath that notwithstanding which is farre better, and more noble, deriued from the superiour part of the soule to the inferiour. As when in a great household the Maister of the house marrieth, the marriage concernes himself only, but the whole house and al the household-seruants, haue part of the feast and musick. In like manner therefore, Religious people, as I sayd, are not altogeather barred of the pleasures of the bodie, but make an exchange of that which is base and momentarie, and alwayes ful of remorse of conscience and exces<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>siue care, for that which is decent, honest, permanent, and so much the more delightful, the more sutable it is to both the parts of Man, and to Nature itself.</p>

The souldiers of this world, though they know they shal often encounter their enemie, doe not therefore forsake the wa<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

               <p n="3">3. Moreouer in the warres among men there is this difference; for if a man wil si<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

But spiritual encounters no man can auoyd, though he would neuer so fayne. The Diuels are enemies to al mankind; they lye in wayte for al, they set vpon al, not only vpon Religious people, but much more vpon Secular people, the more their liues are open to their assaults, and they lesse warie of them. So that Religion doth not rayse an enemie against thee, that was not thy enemie before, but doth minister weapons, and courage, and counsel to with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stand, and also to assault him that was alwayes thine, and euerie bodies enemie.</p>
               <p n="4">4. The reason therefore, why Religious people seeme to endure harder en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>counters then others,<note place="margin">Why Reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gious peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple seeme to haue harder en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>counters.</note> is, because when we begin first to cast-vp our Spiritual ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>counts, and to consider what we are, and from whence we come, and whether we are walking, and (in a word) what wounds and sores we haue in our soules, then we begin to feele we haue an enemie. Before, not because we did not feele our wounds, therefore we had none, but we were wounded, and did not reflect vpon it; which of itself was a very dangerous wound, and an euident signe not only of blindnes, but of death that had seazed vs. Though what wonder can it be, if the Diuel doe not oppose a man, when of his owne accord he giues him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>self bound into his hands, and without contradiction yealds himself his slaue, and doth whatsoeuer he wil haue him to do? But when he perceaues a man go about to wrest himself out of his iawes, then he sets to him with greater furie, as a fugitiue.<note place="margin">

It is wel knowne what difference there is in fighting vpon euen ground, or from a higher or lower seate. Secular people that encounter the Diuel in the world, fight with a great deale of disaduantage of place; for the world is a slipperie kind of soyle, where a man can haue no footing, pestered moreouer with often gusts of wind, &amp; other encumbrances, which make the field very disaduan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tagious for them. Religious people fight as it were from a high Tower; for the State itself is like a Tower, both in regard of the eminencie of it, &amp; of the strong fortifications which are about it; so that they are both defended from the enemies shot, &amp; haue better meanes to offend their enemies as being aboue them.</p>
               <p n="10">10. Finally, Religious people haue an other present remedie, &amp; a general anti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dote against al temptations,<note place="margin">Direction of Supe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riours, and laying open of temptations.</note> to wit, their Superiours &amp; Gouernours, who not only by solid reason, &amp; counsel, &amp; prudence are alwayes at hand to releeue them, but oftimes it hapneth, &amp; I may say most commonly, that no sooner can a temptation be layd open before them, but in a moment it vanisheth away, and is defeated. A wonderful thing! &amp; doubtles if there were Physitians for the bodie, that could cure a disease with only looking vpon it, how would they be sought to, &amp; estee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med?

Al these three must needs be farre more violent, and dangerous in Secular people, then in Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligious. For if we speake of infirmitie, who can make anie question, who be the weaker? knowing that Secular people are generally vnacquainted with matters of Spirit, ful of euil habits, their passions strong in them, and they so farre from endeauoring by care and diligence to bridle them, that rather giuing away vnto them, they strengthen them dayly more and more. Al the care on the other side, of Religious people, is to mortifye themselues; Mortification is the first thing they begin with; Mortification is that which they plye continually al their life, &amp; pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chase by it al other vertues, which are the strength, and as it were the sinnewes of Spirit; and consequently nothing, for matter of Spirit, can be more strong then a good Religious man.</p>

These therefore are the grounds, vpon which we may iustly perswade ourselues, that a man is with lesse danger of his soule, and not so often tempted in Religion, as in the world; and that the temptations which doe arise against vs in Religion, are so easie to be ouercome, and withal so beneficial vnto vs, that if we be warie of being ouer-confident of ourselues, we may say, they are rather to be desired and wished for.</p>

                  <seg rend="decorInit">A</seg>Mong al the difficulties which a Religious course hath more in shew then in substance, some apprehend most, to be alwayes at an other's command, alwayes to depend vpon another's wil; because they perswade themselues, that libertie and freedome to doe what a man wil, is most agreable to nature; and to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pend vpon an other, is, in a manner, to be a slaue.</p>
               <p n="2">2. This errour aymes at the verie throat of Religion, and layes siege to the Cittadel. Wherefore, that we may vtterly root it out, we must first consider,<note place="margin">What li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bertie is.</note> what Libertie is, and how natural it is to Man. For a man that shal think, that men are borne so free, that they may doe whatsoeuer comes in their fancie, and what they list, and be bound to no Law nor Superiour, is mightily deceaued. For <hi>S. Augustin</hi> sayth very wel in one of his Epistles, speaking of the true ioy and happines of Man:<note place="margin">
                     <hi>S. Aug.</hi> 1 <hi>p<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                  <q>First consider, whether a bodie may yeald to them, that wil haue that man happie, that liues according to his owne wil. God forbid we should belieue this for truth; for, what if he wil liue wickedly? is he not vncontroulably the more miserable, the more easily his wicked wil may be fulfilled? They also that without knowledge of the true God, haue giuen themselues to Philosophie, haue deseruedly hissed out this opinion out of their Schooles. For one of the eloquentest of them sayth: Behold others, not Philosophers indeed,<note place="margin">
                        <hi>Cic in Hor<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>

                     </note> but nimble Disputants, say, that al are happie, that liue according to their owne wil. But this is false; for to haue a mind to that which is not fitting, is most miserable. And it is not so miserable, not to bring thy desire to passe, as to bring that to passe, which thou shouldst not.</q>
Thus sayth <hi>S. Augustin,</hi>
And <hi>Aristotle</hi> endeauouring to set downe a perfect forme of a Common-wealth,<note place="margin">

For in steed of a man,<note place="margin">Man neuer without a Tutour.</note> whom they hired before with wages, or bought with their money, they haue now a Diuine gouernour of their life, to wit, <hi>Reason</hi>: and to obey it, is to obey God; and they that obey him, are the onlie free-men. For they only liue as they list, who haue learned to desire what they ought. Vnrea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sonable thoughts and fancies are but a shaddow of false libertie, and bring much repentance.</p>
               <p n="4">4 Seing therefore Heathen Philosophers could discouer thus much; we haue much more reason to perswade ourselues the same, in regard that the properties of our nature,<note place="margin">We are na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turally vnder God.</note> which they could not so wel diue into, doe leade vs vnto it. For if Man by nature had no Superiour, he might lawfully liue as he list himself, and it were natural for him to doe so; and doing so, he should liue a pleasant life, and without it be miserable: But seing we haue <hi>God</hi> aboue vs, who created vs, and to whom consequently by the lawes of Nature we are subiect, our owne natural inclination leades vs to subiection to so Soueraigne a Deitie, to serue him, and to humble ourselues and al our actions vnder him.<note place="margin">S. <hi>Aug</hi> 14. <hi>de Ciuit. c.</hi> 12.</note> 
                  <hi>S.

In which precept: (sayth <hi>S. Augustin</hi>) Obedience is commended vnto vs; which vertue in a reasonable creature, is as it were the Mother of Vertues, and preseruer of them, seing the na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture of it is, to make it beneficial, to be subiect to God, and pernicious to doe a man's owne wil, and not the wil of him that created him.</p>
               <p n="5">5. But some bodie wil say:<note place="margin">Volunta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rily to be subiect to God, is true freedome.</note> What freedome hath Man, if he be tyed alwayes, and in al things, to doe the wil and commandment of God? This is our freedome; not to gouerne ourselues after our owne fancie, but voluntarily to embrace the wil of God, voluntarily to performe it. Stocks, and Stones, and brute Beasts, and al things are gouerned by God's direction, but because they haue no knowledge of it, they cannot voluntarily apply themselues to follow it, which makes also, that they are neither capable of merit nor reward.</p>
               <p n="6">6. This perswasion therefore and desire of being Maisters of ourselues, and Lords at our owne pleasure,<note place="margin">It is much one, when God go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uernes im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mediatly o<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

So we see in Citties and Kingdomes, al the labour is to bring them to acknowledge the King their Soueraigne. When they haue once acknowledged him, it is alone to them, whether he deliuer his commands in person, or by his Officer. And consequently it is euident, that as natural as it is for Man to be subject to God, and to Reason (which is as it were a raye of light proceeding from God) so natural is it for him to be subiect to another man in place of God; and if it be natural, it cannot be payneful or troublesome, but must ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cessarily be both easie and pleasant.</p>

therefore attribute the difficulties and the odiousnes of the one to the other. We must therefore informe ourselues of the mayne distance which is betwixt them, in regard both of pleasure and dignitie.
And we may take our information from <hi>Aristotle,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">
                     <hi>Arist.</hi> 5. <hi>pol. c.</hi> 4.</note> who telleth vs, that there be two kinds of gouernment: <q>one, of a domineering fashion, &amp; the nature of it is, that a Lord of this humour ay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mes chiefly &amp; directly at his owne benefit, &amp; regards the benefit of the subiect but accidentally, as the benefit of the subiect redounds to him also; the other is Oeco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nomical, as a father gouernes his children, a man his wife; in which contrariwise the Superiour attends directly to the benefit of the subiect, &amp; to his owne acciden<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tally, because it falleth out so, that the self-same is beneficial to himself; as the Maister of a ship or Pilot, as such, doth first &amp; chiefly take care for the safetie of the passengers,<note place="margin">
                        <hi>Plato de repub.</hi>
                     </note> and of his owne accidentally, because he is also a passenger. These are <hi>Aristotle's</hi> owne words. And <hi>Plato</hi> hath the like discourse of a Common-weale. As a shepheard, sayth he, in as much as he is a shepheard, attendeth to the benefit of his flock, and not to his owne; for his busines is to see that that, which is in his custodie, be rightly ordered:</q>
So he that hath the gouerning of men, aymeth at no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing but the good of them that are vnder him. By which we may easily see, vnder which of these kinds a Religious State is to be ranked.<note place="margin">The power of the Church &amp; of Reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gion is Oe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>conomical.</note>
               </p>
               <p n="8">8. And it is the more apparent, because not only the power, which is in force among Religious people, but al the power which Christ our Sauiour hath left in his Church, tends to the benefit, not of him that hath it, but of the subiect. Which our Sauiour himself, who is Authour of this power, gaue vs to vnderstand in these words:<note place="margin">

Ber<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nard,</hi> in an other place, likeneth this kind of authoritie to the power of a Steward or a Tutour. For the farme, sayth he, is vnder the Steward, and the Yong-maister vnder his Tutour, and yet neither is the Steward Lord of the farme, nor the Tutour Maister of his Maister. And addeth: Be thou there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore ouer others so, as to prouide, to aduise, to take care, to preserue; be ouer others, to benefit others. Be ouer others as a faithful Seruant, whom the Maister hath appointed ouer his familie; what to doe?</q>
To giue them food in season; that is, to dispense, not to be impetious. If therefore this which <hi>S. Bernard</hi> deliuereth, or rather which our Sauiour hath left ordered in his Chruch, be the model of al Ecclesiastical Iurisdiction, how much more doth the same hold in the gouernment of Religious houses, seing both of them flow from the same head, and the reason, and ground, and vse of them, is equal in both, and the manner of Religious profession requireth moreouer with much greater reason, this kind of humble proceeding? He there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore that hath command ouer others in Religion, is not Maister, but Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uant; He attends vpon al their necessities both of bodie and soule; this is al his employment day and night; in this he spends al his thoughts and endeauours.

The seruice of our Lord is free: The seruice is free, where not necessitie, but charitie serueth. Thou art a slaue and a freeman both togeather: a slaue, because thou art created; a freeman, because God, who created thee, loues thee; serue not murmuring: for thy murmuring wil not make that thou shalt not serue, but that thou shalt serue like a slaue.

Thus sayth <hi>Diadochus</hi>; and then putting this question in behalf of the aduerse partie (If we sel al at once, from whence shal the poore haue releef, who were dayly maintayned out of our goods?) he answereth in this manner:
<q>Certainly God wil aske account at our hands of almes-giuing ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to that which we haue, and not according to that which we haue not.

Let such an one learne, not to vpbraide God by occasion of his owne couetous mind.

But when we forsake al at once, &amp; bestow nothing dayly vpon the poore, we may easily think we doe little good, and stirre ourselues to a wholesome sorrow and humilitie, and moreouer be more eager to get by prayer, and patience, and humilitie, that which we cannot now purchase by almes-giuing.</p>

Now let vs see, who is more vnited with God, a Secular, or a Religious man? But there can be no question in it: for besides the coniunction which Charitie maketh betwixt them (the force of which vertue is farre greater in Religion, &amp; farre more meanes to purchase it) there be other vertues which mainly further this vnion, and chiefly those two, which are so proper and natural to a Religious course, to wit, Humilitie &amp; Obedience, the one freing vs from al worldlie pride, the other deli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uering vs ouer to the Diuine Maiestie, and putting him in absolute possession of vs, to rule vs and weald vs as he pleaseth, besides the perpetual and irreuocable bond of our Vowes, binding vs so inseparably to God, that there cannot be a stronger tye, nor a more inuiolable coniunction imagined vpon earth.

To this inward coniunction with God, we may adde the outward helps, which in Religion are manie, as the ioyning of so manie hands togeather, which is a great meanes to bring busines to an end; for that which a man hath not in him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>self, he hath it in his Brother. Secondly the authoritie, which the despising of earthlie things giues Religious people aboue others; a contempt, I say, of the world, which lyes not hidden in euerie one's breast, but is apparent to be seen in the state itself, and the whole course of a man's life. Al which and such like other furtherances, they that labour for the benefit of others in a Secular life, must needs want. And to passe ouer other things; of what importance must it needs be, that Religious men are in this busines of the help of Soules, as wel as in other things, wholy directed guided, and illuminated by their Superiours? For first the aduise &amp; counsel of men that are wise &amp; expert in so weightie a busines, cannot but be very vseful; besides that, it is God that gouerneth them by their Superiours, which is al in al; for when God is the authour &amp; beginner of that which we vndertake, it cannot but prosper, whatsoeuer it be. And to answer that which was obiected, by example of a hound, doth not the game goe much better forward, when the dogs are guided by a huntsman, that knowes how to rule them, when to put them on, when to take them off, and when to stay them from ranging about? Yea without it, the dogs of themselues are not fit to hunt.</p>

It is easier for a man's bodie to flie in the ayre, then to quiet our desire, if we stil adde more. And certainly we shal find it so, as the Philosopher sayth, that some things, are more easily quite cut off, then in part tempered. And <hi>Cassian</hi> speaking by experience, sayth: We haue seen men easier abstaine altogeather from grosse meates, then vse moderatly of those which are granted for necessitie; and those that denye themselues al for the loue of continencie, then those that vnder pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tence of infirmitie, taking some, keepe themselues within the bounds of suffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciencie. and this which <hi>Cassian</hi> sayth of Temperance, in respect of Gluttonie, is true in al other obiects; which being present, are apt to delight either our eyes or our mind.

For we see dayly before our eyes, how men are taken with the things of this world, before they think of it, meerly by vse and custome of handling them; and are oftimes most intangled, when they think themselues most at libertie. For as a man growes secretly in loue with the bed in which he lyes, and with the chayre in which he is wont to sit, and finds it not til he be called to rise: So the loue of these earthlie things creeps so couertly into our affection, that we think ourselues stil at libertie, &amp; feele not the fetters, in which they haue inthralled vs; but then we feele them, when death or chance must part vs. We ca<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>not haue a better witnes of this, which we are saying, then <hi>S. Gregorie,</hi> who deliuereth it both vpon good grou<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ds of reason, and his owne experience. For thus he relateth how he liued in the world.</p>

                  <hi>S. Gregorie</hi> therefore confessing this of him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>self, others may easily see, how much more they ought to feare, and beware of the like, knowing themselues to be so farre inferiour to <hi>S. Gregorie</hi> in strength and
<pb n="509" facs="tcp:15193:268"/>
vertue.
For this is the reason, why holie men, as the same Saint obserueth in an o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther place, stand more in feare of worldlie prosperitie, then of aduersitie. For they know, sayth he, that while the mind is held-on in pleasing businesses, it willingly sometimes leanes to exteriour things; they know, that oftimes a secret thought doth so misleade it, that it is altered, it knowes not how.</p>
               <p n="15">15. And thus much we haue spoken of Religion, as it is a fit instrument &amp; mea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nes to Perfection, in regard it freeth the passage of al encumbrances, which lye be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tweene vs and a spiritual life,<note place="margin">Manie things in Religion, of them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selues to be desired.</note> and in a manner stop-vp our way. But there is yet something more in it, that of itself, and for itself, is greatly to be desired, and they that haue it not (though we should grant them al things els) must needs confesse they want no smal spiritual ornament &amp; enrichment of their soules. For first in Religion there is the point of Abnegation of our owne wil, a point of high per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fection, and properly Euangelical.<note place="margin">Abnega<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of our wil.</note> For he that is free to dispose of himself as he list, may often, euen in good works, mingle much of his owne wil, in prayer, in almes-giuing, and the like; and so much as he mingleth of his wil, so much he leeseth of the value of his work. So that the happines which we purchase by wholy vnuesting ourselues, and intirely casting-of our owne wil in al things, and for our whole life-time, is a happines, that cannot be expressed in words, nor pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chased but by the Vow of Obedience.</p>
               <p n="16">16. A man may say, that in the world, the sole Wil of God may be our Guide &amp; ayme. And it is a glorious saying, and carrieth a faire shew, &amp; soundeth big as long as we stand in the speculation of it; but when we come to the proof and practise, al that imagination of perfection vanisheth into the ayre. For first how secret and vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>certain is the wil of God? how manie errours and perplexities doth a man runne into in seeking it? Besides that, he that followeth his owne dictamen in scanning it, and making his coniectures about it, putteth alwayes something of his owne vnto it, which is a thing very considerable. And certainly he is in the farre better way, that ordereth his life so, as he may say truly, he hath nothing of his owne in it. For this is that perfect Renunciation &amp; Abnegation, which our Sauiour com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mandeth, to forsake ourselues so, as to reserue nothing of ourselues. True vertue therefore is that which <hi>Climaens</hi> sayth, whose words I wil set downe, because the verie simplicitie of them doth much please me:<note place="margin">

And so goeth-on, discoursing how their temporal wealth was a fi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gure of the Spiritual riches reserued for vs; and how they are vanished, &amp; these to be maintayned.

               <p n="22">22. <hi>S. Iohn Chrysostome</hi> in his booke of Virginitie,<note place="margin">

But in those dayes there was no such patterne of perfection. And handling this point at large, he giueth the reason, why we haue greater commandments layd vpon vs, then they had; because the grace of the Holie-Ghost hath been powred forth more plentifully vpon vs, and greater guifts bestowed by the coming of Christ, who of weake and feeble creatures makes vs perfect. Wherefore as men expect more at their childrens hands, when they are growne to be yong striplings, then when they were children, and find fault with those things in elder yeares, which it was a pleasure to see in their tender age: So God in those first times con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>descended in manie things, which now in the light of the Ghospel we see are im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perfect, specially, seing now also we haue a greater reward promised vs, to wit, for earth, heauen, for temporal things, ioyes euerlasting.</p>
               <p n="23">23. Finally to conclude, though among those ancient Fathers, or also among people in these dayes there haue been alwayes some,<note place="margin">Presump<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion to think, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause others haue escaped in the world, that there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore we may.</note> as we know, that in the midst of their wealth and honour, and delights of marriage, or in the degree of Kings, haue liued vertuously, yet what boldnes were it, or rather madnes, in anie of vs to presume to paralel ourselues with them, &amp; to make account that we shal be able to wade through the dangers which they haue escaped? For as <hi>S. Thomas</hi> wel and prudently obserueth, they effected it by the prerogatiue of their sanctitie and eminencie of Vertue, which God, <hi>who worketh al things by the purpose of his wil,</hi> was pleased to bestow vpon them; And yet they that are more in firme, ought not to be so confident of themselues,<note place="margin">S. <hi>Tho.</hi> 21. <hi>q</hi> 186. <hi>a</hi> 4. <hi>Ep.</hi> 5.</note> as to think, that they shal be also able to attayne to perfection with al those hinderances: as no man is so foolish as to set vpon a whole armie of men himself alone, without weapon, because he hath heard, that <hi>Sampson</hi> slew so manie of his enemies, only with the iawe-bone of an Asse.</p>

By this therefore it is euident, that it is farre better, more perfect, and more safe (for al these commodities meete togeather) vtterly to forsake the world, and al worldlie things, not only in desire, which is alwayes vncertain, and subiect to manie errours and mistakings, but in effect &amp; verie deed; a thing which certainly b<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

For, say they, what great matter is it, or what won<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der, if a man, that is shut-vp in his celle, desire nothing, when he sees nothing that is worth the desiring? or that he liue in peace and quiet of mind, when he med<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dles with no kind of busines, feeles no losse of anie thing? or that he neuer is trans<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ported with passion, when he liues with people that are of an excellent temper, and his owne Brethren, that iumpe with him in conceit, and practise, and euerie thing? But to conuerse continually in the midst of beautiful obiects, and there to temper himself; to liue among the frie of al sorts of people, to haue his eares ful of rayling speeches, to heare and see manie forcible things to intice him to sinne, and yet alwayes to beare-vp, neuer to shrink or giue back, this is vertue.

But it wil not be hard, to informe the one in the right, and to confute the other. For if it were true that they alwayes had the better in their spiritual combats in the world, if they alwayes scaped without touch, if they neuer were foyled nor wounded, they might haue some cause perhaps to glorie.

course, to content themselues with a kind of mediocritie in vertue, then by aspiring to perfection, to take vpon them so heauie an obligation, as wil proue in effect much more paynful to discharge it, and much more preiudicial vnto them, if they acquit not themselues of it as they ought. But how wrongfully they alleadge these things, we wil quickly and briefly shew.</p>
               <p n="2">2. For first we must vnderstand,<note place="margin">Much shal be deman<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded of al Christians.</note> that this saying of our Sauiour concernes not only Religious people, but al Christians, that haue been enriched with so manie heauenlie treasures, and honoured with so manie Diuine guifts, and bought with the bloud of the liuing God, and loaded with so manie benefits, as dayly, &amp; howrely, and euerie moment of time they receaue. They therefore that are not Religious, must not think, that they haue escaped the rigourous doome of that Sentence, but take it for a certain truth, that as they haue <hi>receaued much,</hi> that is, manie vnspeakable benefits, they wil find themselues also in the number of them, <hi>of whom much,</hi> yea an immensitie of correspondance, <hi>wil be demanded.</hi> Wheras Religion, to our excessiue comfort, though it throw more benefits vpon vs, yet those verie benefits are withal as manie helps and furtherances to discharge and re-inbourse that,<note place="margin">The ouer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plus in Religion helps to discharge the debt.</note> which we owe in regard of them, and of al others which are vni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uersal to al mankind. For as it is the guift of God to fast, to be chast, to be obedient: so by the self-same fasting, and being chast, and obedient, we render in a manner as much to God, as the guift is worth.</p>
               <p n="3">3. Besides that,<note place="margin">To be rich, is a dispo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sition for more riches.</note> this strict denunciation of redemanding that which hath been giuen vs, ought not so much to fright vs, as that other promise encourage vs: <hi>He that hath, shal be giuen vnto him, and he shal abound.</hi> For so it is in truth; and the manner and disposition of Almightie God, is, stil more and more to enrich and fil those that are ful and rich. And in some sort we may say, it concernes him to haue an eye<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
                  <note place="margin">
                     <hi>Matth.</hi> 13.12 <hi>&amp;</hi> 25.29.</note> that they, vpon whom he hath heaped so much wealth, leese it not, but be stil receauing more and more at his hands, to strengthen and establish them in that which formerly they had; as oftimes we see gamesters leese more, that they may be no loosers; and they that goe to law, the more paynes they haue taken, and the more money they haue spent in it, the more hot they are vpon spen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding.</p>
               <p n="4">4. Finally that which we sayd before,<note place="margin">Religious are only bound to aspire to perfection.</note> is considerable also in this place, that the perfection of vertue is not so required at Religious mens hands, as that they are bound to be perfect. And they that are so much frighted with the obligation which lyes vpon Religion, mistake the matter, if they think they are. But they discharge their dutie, if they aspire to perfection, if they keepe themselues stil in the way towards it. As it is not required of a Schollar, that he be instantly learned, instantly excellent at his booke, because he is a Schollar, but it is suf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficient that he desire it, and endeauour to it: and the self-same we may say of Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligious people, if they doe not wholy cast aside the thought of vertue, but with conuenient care and diligence labour for it, though they be notwithstanding imperfect, they cannot be sayd to fayle of their dutie; and those verie steps, as short as they are, bring them dayly neerer and neerer to God.</p>

feares of this nature, we may wel liken him to that vnprofitable and naughtie Seruant in the Ghospel, that excused his lazines to his Maister in these words: <hi>I was afraid, because thou art a hard man; thou reapest, where thou hast not sowed; and gatherest,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">
                     <hi>Matth</hi> 25.</note> 
                  <hi>where thou hast not scattered.</hi> An allegation both false and impious. For God is so farre from demanding more then he gaue, as he requireth farre lesse. And the man was iustly conuicted and condemned by his Maister, out of his owne mouth.<note place="margin">They think vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>worthily of God.</note> For if he thought he was so hard and seuere, it behooued him to be much more diligent, and watchful, and actiue in making the aduantage of his stock. And the same we may say of these. For first they erre in thinking so vnworthily of that Infinit Goodnes and bountie, and casting so greeuous an aspersion vpon him, as if he were so cruel as they make him. They should rather think the truth, that his guifts are neuer to our ruine, but for our greater be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nefit and saluation, and that, whatsoeuer he requireth of vs, he first volunta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rily bestowes it vpon vs with a free and liberal hand. Secondly, if they feare, least they shal be seuerely punished, if admitting of such a vocation, they make lesse profit of it; how much rather ought they to feare, if they reiect the vo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cation which is offered them? For whatsoeuer is offered vs, is accounted among the guifts, seing it was truly giuen vs; and he that reiecteth such an offer, doth not only wrap-vp his money in his hand kercher, or dig it into the ground, but, which is worse, he contemnes it, and casts it away. They should therefore stand in feare of this, and also of that terrible sentence layd vpon that lazie Seruant: <hi>Lyed hand and foot, cast him into vtter darknes.</hi> And this is the truth of the busines.</p>

                  <note place="margin">Whether the sinnes of Reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gious peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple be greater.</note>6. But by the way, we must heer answer an other doubt, which perhaps staggers a great manie, imagining that the sinnes of Religious people are farre m<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

Thou deceauest thyself mightily, and mistakest the matter, if thou think, that one thing is required of Secular men, another of Monks. And following this argument at large with manie reasons, he concludeth thus: Therefore, that a Secular man, and a Monk, are both equally bound to the same diligence and care in their life, and to the highest top of perfection, and that both of them if they fal, shal receaue harme alike, I think no man now, though he be very impudent and contentious, wil denye.</q>

                  </note> then greater. And because some perhaps might think it an incredible thing, that it should be so, he giueth three reasons of it. First, because the sinnes, which proceed not out of a habit and custome, as vsually those doe which Secular people commit, but of a suddain
<pb n="517" facs="tcp:15193:272"/>
motion, which comes vpon them as a great blast of wind, are lesse voluntarie, and therefore happen seldome; and when they happen, the wil of the partie that commits them, is not so wholy bent vpon them. Secondly, because what<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>soeuer euil they commit, it is easier drowned in the good which they doe; and their good deeds pleade for more fauour at the hands of that infinit Goodnes, which is alwayes more inclinable to mercie, then one fact can exasperate him against them; an example wherof we haue in King <hi>Iosaphat,</hi> to whom the <hi>Prophet</hi> spake in this manner:<note place="margin">2. <hi>Paral.</hi> 19.2.</note> 
                  <hi>And therefore indeed thou deser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uedst the wrath of God; but good works haue been sound in thee.</hi> Thirdly, as a Religious man hath more knowledge of God, purchased by long familiaritie with him; so he cannot so carelessely cast himself away, and plunge himself so deep into sinne, as one that neuer knew, what the beautie of Vertue, or the vglines of Sinne meant.</p>
               <p n="8">8. For euen speaking of our bodie, when a man comes by a fal, there is great difference in falling by chance when his foot slips, and in casting a man's self headlong downe; for the first helpeth himself as much as he can, and riseth presently againe: the other crusheth himself farre more, and thinks not of rising againe, and consequently is more apt to fal an other time, whereas the first growes more warie and strong after his fal. Which is that which the <hi>Psalmist</hi> sayth in these words:<note place="margin">
                     <hi>Ps.</hi> 36 24.</note> 
                  <hi>A iust man, when he falleth, shal not be brused.</hi>
               </p>

                     <hi>S. Basil reg. br. c.</hi> 81.</note>
For mouing the self-same question (Whether the sinnes of a Religious man, and an ordinarie man, being the same, be equal?) answereth, <q>that in a Religious man they are rather lesse. For a Religious man, sayth he, being careful in seeking the grace of God, and labouring wholy for it, doth not fal of purpose, but by chance, and against his wil. But an ordinarie man, regarding neither God nor himself, and thinking it no great matter, whether he sinne, or liue wel, either contemneth God, or thinketh, there is no God at al,<note place="margin">
                        <hi>Ps.</hi> 13.2.</note> as the Scripture sayd: <hi>The foole sayd in his hart, There is no God.</hi> They are corrupted, they are made abominable in their studies. And we must know besides, that the sinnes of Religious people most commonly happen for their good, through God's particular direction; God permitting them some<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times to fal, to the end to cure some pride, which before they had in their mind, as it hapned to <hi>S.

                  <seg rend="decorInit">S</seg>Ome haue often in their mouth the faults and sinnes of Religious people, who either correspond not to their dutie in Religion, nor to the sanctitie of the place, wherin they liue, or, which is worse, forsake Religion, &amp; <hi>hauing put their hand to the plough, looke back againe,</hi> and for this they highly discommend Religious courses.</p>
               <p n="2">2.

Though there be an other reason, why they talk so much of them, to wit, because the beautie and dignitie of the State maketh them easily marke the least blemish in it; as the least stayne is a disgrace to a rich garment, or to a white peece of cloath; wheras in a peece of canuas or sack-cloath no notice is taken of greater spots; not because they are not greater, but because the stuffe in which they are, is so coorse, that that new blemish is not seen in it. For so in a Secular state we let thousands of greater faults passe, and there is not a word made of them, because it is no newes in that State; but in a Religious course the least fault that is, is presently spyed, and yet they leaue not to be of the least.</p>

This is the argument both of ancient Hereticks, and of those of our dayes, that maliciously oppose and cauil at the wholesome continencie, with which the holie Church is so much honoured and stored. We must therefore make the same answer, which we make to hereticks, to wit, that whatsoeuer is instituted for the good of the whole kind, is not idle or in vayne, though in some particulars of that kind it hath not the effect, if in others it haue.

An other reason is in regard of the <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

Religious people therefore hauing their part in this work and labour, and labouring so hard as they doe, it is but reason they should haue part also of the fruit, specially so much as is necessarie to continue their labour. Which is not only of force in Preachers, and such as labour immediately for the good of their Neighbours, but in others that employ themselues in anie profitable course for them. For they that minister at the Altar, of the Sacrifice wherof al Faithful are partakers, and they that attend to Prayer and Contemplation, and the Studie of holie Scripture, and such other spiritual functions, as are for the benefit of the whole Church, al of them, as I sayd, haue right to be maintayned of the peoples liberalitie.</p>

The constant peace and contentment of mind also, which Religious people enioy, is no smal meanes for them to liue long. For certainly as grief and passion doe wast a man's spirits, and put our life, as I may say, vpon the torture; so contentment of mind, redounding necessarily to the bodie, must also needs preserue it, and giue it much ease, by reason of the affinitie betwixt the soule and it. And though we grant, with <hi>S. Hierome</hi> in his discourse against <hi>Iouinian,</hi> that a Religious life, and such temperate courses, doe not make vs so strong as <hi>Nilo Crotoniates,</hi> that is nothing to the purpose. For what necessitie is there, sayth he, that a wise man, and a Christian Philosopher should haue so much strength of bodie, as one that professeth himself a Wrastler, or a Souldier, seing if he had so much strength, it would but egg him on to sinne?</p>
               <p n="8">8. Wherefore to repeate in brief that which hath been sayd, there be two wayes to answer this obiection. First, by denying that a Religious course doth shorten our life, and on the other side maintayning that Sobrietie and continencie doth rather prolong it; Secondly, by confessing that it doth cut off part of our dayes, and taking it for the greater benefit, in regard that wheras al men, Kings, Princes, and al must necessarily dye, Religion makes this necessitie in a manner voluntarie, by going, as is were, to meete death half way, and encreasing thereby our merit and reward in the measure which I haue spoken, the few dayes which we spare of the miseries of this life being added to eternitie, and abundantly re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>compenced by the encrease of our euerlasting felicitie. Contrariewise, they that neglect a Religious vocation for feares of this nature, buy those few yeares, which they get, at a very deare rate; neglecting so great a good for feare of so smal a losse, and putting their eternal saluation to so great a hazard.</p>

If through sicknes a man's bodie be il at ease, and the Physician prescribe a diet to take away the peccant humours of it, or order that it shal be let bloud, or that a limme shal be cut off, as sometimes it hapneth, because the partie is otherwise past cure; he that shal follow the aduise of the Physician, shal he be said to hate his bodie, ar to loue it?

This therefore, which we doe in euerie ordinarie disease and distemper of our bodie, much more ought we to doe in greater and more dangerous diseases of the same, which are the euil inclinations, which it hath. For the feauer of lust, and whatsoeuer other exorbitant heate of desire, is no lesse a feauer, then when our bodie is out of order with distempered humours; rather it is the more dangerous feauer of the two, because it pulleth vs in hazard of eternal death.

canst not worke thine owne. Al things haue their time. Let the Soule now labour for itself; or rather labour thou with it; because if thou suffer with it, thou shalt raigne with it. So much as thou hindrest the reparation of it, so much thou hindrest thine owne; because thou canst not be repayred, til in it God see his image reformed. Thou hast a noble guest, ô Flesh; a noble one indeed; and al thy welfare dependeth of the welfare of that guest; yeald due respect to so great a guest. Thou dwellest in thine owne country, but thy soule lodgeth with thee as a pilgrim, and a person exiled. I beseech thee, what country-fellow, if a Noble-man or a man of great power would lodge with him, would not willingly lodge himself in some corner of his house, or vnder the stayers, or in the verie ashes, and yeald the more honourable place to his guest, as it is sitting he should? Doe thou therefore the like; regard not thine iniuries or troubles, so that thy guest may haue honourable entertainement with thee. And that thou maist not peraduenture flight and contemne this thy guest, because he looked like a pilgrim and stranger, think carefully with thy self, what benefit the presence of this guest doth bring thee. It is he that giueth sight to thy eyes, hearing to thy eares, sound to thy tongue, tast to thy palate, and motion to al thy members. If there be anie life, anie sense, anie beautie in <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="2 letters">

Finally his parting wil shew, what his presence yealded; for so soone as the soule is departed, the tongue lyeth stil, the eyes see nothing at al, the eares are deafe, the bodie growes stif, the face growes wanne; and after a short time al wil be a stincking rotten carkasse, and al the beautie of it turned into corruption. Why therefore for euerie smal tempo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral delight dost thou disgust and hurt this guest, seing but for him thou couldst not so much as feele anie delight? Moreouer if being as yet exiled and an out-cast from the face of God, by reason of the falling-out of God and him, he be so bene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficial to thee, what wil he be when he shal be reconciled? Doe not, ô bodie, doe not hinder that reconciliation; for thy self mayst come to great glorie by it. Offer thy self patiently, yea willingly to al; let nothing passe which may be a furthe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rance to this reconciliation. O if thou couldst tast this sweetnes, and value this glorie! The Lord of hoasts himself, the Lord of vertues, the King of glorie him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>self wil come downe to reforme our bodies, to configure them to the bodie of his glorie.

And from the nature of the euil custo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mes I argue thus: Euil customes are habits; and the nature of al habits is, that as they are gotten by vse and often acts, so if we cease from these acts, by litle and litle the habits themselues vanish away and perish. As for example; if a man be skilful in musick or in picture-drawing, or if he write a faire hand, or haue anie other art or science, as he got it by vse and practise and often endeauour, so if he neuer exercise it, or, which is more, if he practise it but seldome and carelesly, it decayes of itself, and at last he quite looseth it. And no doubt but we shal find the like in al euil dispositions of the mind also; as if a man be cholerick, or intem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perate in his diet, or other pleasures, and cease from the acts of these vices, as be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore they grew &amp; waxed stronger and stronger by being fed with daylie offences, so if we take away their former allowance, they must needs grow weak, &amp; lessen in vs.</p>
               <p n="4">4. Besides that,<note place="margin">And by contrarie practise.</note> as those euil dispositions were bred by euil actio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>s, so the practise of vertue breeds co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>trarie habits of vertue; as when a Religious man doth not only cease from acts of pride and vanitie, but practiseth humilitie, &amp; embraceth al occa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sions of contempt of himself from his verie hart; when in steed of the loue of worldlie wealth, &amp; his wonted pleasures he begins to loue the hardnes of pouertie and the like, in al which a Religious state doth inco<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>parably help him, ministring daylie occasions of these &amp; other vertues, &amp; in a manner forcing them vpon him.</p>

And what need I be long?<note place="margin">Sight and conuersa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion with good peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple, alter a man.</note> Not only the endeauour &amp; application of a man's mind is thus effectual, but the verie sight of so manie good men as are in Religion, &amp; the daylie conuersing with them, is able of itself to alter a man, be he neuer so rude and vnciuil, and by litle and litle to instil goodnes into him. If we take a beast out of the woods or forrests, and bring him vp at hand, he leeseth after a while his wildnes, and becomes as tame and gentle as a whelp.
<pb n="542" facs="tcp:15193:285"/>
And this we see effected not only in deere, and wild goates, which are naturally timorous, but in lions and beares, which are otherwise of themselues fierce and cruel; and yet these beasts can adde nothing inwardly of themselues, nor vse anie endeauour to ouercome their nature, but the bare custome of being among men doth silently worke vpon them, and by degrees giue them another nature and fashion, and make them tame. What effect therefore must the self-same needs haue in men, who haue iudgement moreouer and vnderstanding, &amp; can inwardly apply themselues, and labour their owne reformation and polishing.</p>

How is it possible (said I) to make such a change, and so vpon the suddain and so speedily to shake-of that, which being bred in vs, is growne hard by the setling of that natural matter, or by long vse made a custome, through ancientnes of age and time? These things haue taken too deepe roote in vs. When shal he learne fru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>galitie, that hath been accustomed to long suppers and curious banckets? or he that hath shined in his silkes, and been glorious in his rich garments and cloth-of-gold and purple, when shal he stoope to plaine and ordinarie apparrel? He that hath been compassed with troupes of clients, and countenanced with a long trayne of officious followers, wil think it a torment to be alone. It cannot be otherwise, but that custome of drinking wine wil be alwayes calling vpon a man with tough perswasions; pride wil puff him vp; wrath wil set him on fire; couetousnes wil disturbe him; crueltie wil egg him forward; ambition wil flatter him; lust wil cast him headlong. This discourse I held often with myself. For as I was entangled with diuers errours of my former life, which I did beleeue was impossible to shake-of; so I yealded to the vices, which did then cleaue vnto me, and out of despayre of being better, I fauoured my euils, as mine owne, and borne in my owne house. But when by help of the Regenerating water the fowlnes of my former life was washed away, and the light from-aboue shined vpon my pure and sanctifyed breast, when receauing from heauen, the second natiuitie had repayred me into a new man; presently, after a strange manner, things which were doubtful, appea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red certain; that which was shut-vp from me, was layd open; dark things became lightsome; that which was hard, was easie; &amp; that possible, which before seemed

Al this, and much more is out of <hi>S. Cyprian</hi>; which euerie Religious man may see and acknowledge in himself.

Wheras on the other side, if we consecrate the flower of our youth and life to God, we shal find the quite contrarie, and preuent those dangers and misfortunes.</p>
               <p n="4">4. Secondly, youth is aptest to receaue good impressions, &amp; is most disciplinable, while the mind is yet emptie, &amp;, like a peece of white paper, fit to receaue what<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>soeuer a bodie wil write in it; or like a yong tree, which a man may bend &amp; leade which way he wil. And we see it euidently, for example, in most beasts, as in horses and dogs, and some kinds of birds; if we teach them while they are yong, we find by experience that they are apt to take, euerie one according to their seueral kind; but if we let that time passe, they grow so stubborn, that we can neuer bring them to anie thing. It is true, that al times with man are in season for vertue; but if we speake of a facilitie and a kind of nimblenes in it, we find it certainly faire greater in that tender age before a man be hardned in vice and vanitie.</p>

Thomas,</hi> where he sayth, in that which belongs to the nature of the bodie, al men are equal among themselues; a seruant is not inferiour to his maister, nor a child to his pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rent, meaning, for example of corporal necessities, generation, and the like; from whence he concludes, that no man can in reason be compelled either to marrie, or to liue a single life, for other mens, or his owne fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther's pleasure And <hi>Aristotle</hi> deduceth the same out of the grounds of nature; for hauing disputed at large the obligation which children haue towards their parents,<note place="margin">
                     <hi>Arist</hi> 9. <hi>Eth. c.</hi> 2.</note> in the end he putteth this question: whether in al occasions they must so liue in obedience to them, as it can neuer be lawful for them to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>part from it? and answereth, that they are not bound in al. For if a child be sick, he must obey the Physician rather then his Father, in that which concernes his health; and in like manner, the General of the field, in that which belongs to the lawes of armes.</p>

If anie bodie alleadge the commandment of the Law,<note place="margin">This is not contrarie to the command<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment.</note> willing vs to honour our Parents; we answer as <hi>S.

               <p n="5">5. A second reason is,<note place="margin">The power of Parents is as of a deputie.</note> because the power which parents haue ouer their chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren, being a participation of the authoritie which God hath ouer them, <hi>from whom,</hi> as the Apostle speaketh, <hi>al paternitie</hi> is deriued, it is but as the power of a deputie or delegate.

A third reason is, because if we cast our accounts right, and summe-vp al duties and the heads of them, which we owe to our parents, we shal find, that in comparison of God, we haue receaued litle or nothing from them. For wheras Man is a compound of soule and bodie, parents haue no hand at al in bestowing our soule vpon vs, which is notwithstanding the best part of vs, and in a manner al in al.

As for our bodie, if they had the whole framing of it a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lone, yet we should not owe them much more, then if they had bestowed a garment vpon vs, or some kind of instrument to worke with, or a vessel to hold something in; for these are the seruices which the bodie doth for the soule, and truly not much more; rather in manie things it hindereth it, it troubleth it, it dulleth it; so that it hath not al that belongs to a perfect instrument, in the functions for which a soule needs it. Wherefore, as I sayd, though our parents had been the sole framers and giuers of our bodie, what were it? But indeed how litle of the bodie itself doe our parents giue vs' For if a man should spit vpon the ground, and God should presently of that spittle frame an image or some other thing, who should be sayd to be authour of that image? God, or he that by chance spet vpon the ground? For in like manner, God vseth the vnfashioned matter which falles from man, to fashion a bodie out of it: He fra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>meth it, he orders it, he makes the sinnewes of one part of it, the bones, the bloud, and the rest of the members, of another: and man is so farre from hauing anie hand in it, that he knowes not how, nor whether anie such thing be done at al; as we see euidently, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause oftimes when they most desire children, they are farthest from hauing them.<note place="margin">

For we must imagin, as if there were two that did cal vpon vs both at once, Christ on the one side, our parents on the other: both of them lay before vs, what they haue deserued at our hands, but their cause is farre vnequal. That which God hath bestowed vpon vs, is infinitly of greater value, then that which our parents haue giuen vs, besides that they had it of God to giue vs, and so it falles out to be more truly indeed the guift of God. Both of them therefore inuite vs: God promiseth heauenlie things, things of in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>estimable weight, things that are most assured; they proffer earthlie things only, which indeed are of no value, neither is it in their power to giue them vs when they wil. God, though he should promise vs nothing els but himself, is himself beautie, goodnes, happines, honour, &amp; worth itself, and of himself a large reward for al the paynes we can bestow. Wherefore, when we turne our backs to God, when we preferre the wil of an other before his wil, we doe him infi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nit wrong.

not ashamed, that is not afraid to preferre a mortal man before God immortal, darknes before light, durt and ashes before heauen? A punishment doubtles then which there is none greater, a punishment most iust and most sutable to the fault committed: <hi>He is not worthie of me.</hi> Nothing can fal more heauie vpon man then to be reiected as vnworthie of the companie of his God, no pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nishment be more iust, then that he should be reiected, seing he had so litle re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>spect, as to preferre a creature before his Creatour, specially being inuited by him, and God offering himself so louingly vnto him.</p>

And notwithstanding intangled yet in the bond of carnal affinitie, while they yeald indiscreetly to the loue of their kindred, oftimes they returne through affection to their alliance, to the things which they had ouercome euen with con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tempt of themselues. And while they loue their carnal friends more then needs, drawne to outward things, they become diuided from the pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rent of their hart.What doe those therefore but walk in a net, hauing been loosened from this present world by the perfection of life which they had begun,<note place="margin">

In which saying when after the hatred of our kindred he inferreth the hatred of our owne life, he euidently sheweth, that we are commanded to hate our kindred, as we are to hate ourselues; that drawing them to eternal things, and neglecting their carnal fauour, when it hindreth vs, we may learne to loue them with the art and temper of discretion, as it is fitting, and wholesomely to hate them, to the end hatred may learne so to rise by loue, that we may more truly loue them by hating them. For this cause it is sayd by Moyses: <hi>He that shal say to his father and to his mother, I know you not, and to his brethren, I am not acquainted with you,</hi>

A man must therefore seuer himself from his kindred and alliance, if he wil be truly vnited with the Father of al; to the end that whom he couragiously neglecteth for God, he may loue them the more solidly, the more he is vnacquainted with the soluble affection of carnal coniunction.</q>

Al this is out of <hi>S. Gregorie,</hi> and much more to the like effect, concluding in the end, that though this natural affection tempts vs and presse

<q>It is rather a labour to stop thy eares that thou mayst not heare it. For this voice offereth it self vnto vs, it presseth-in vpon vs, and ceaseth not to knock at euerie man's doore.

First therefore, wheras the setling of a man's self in a course, which must last al the dayes of his life, is one of the greatest businesses, which a man hath in this world, and which needeth best aduise, we see notwithstanding that commonly men carrie themselues more carelesly and ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gligently in this, then in anie other thing; though in anie other busines, if through negligence or ignorance the matter be mistaken, the losse reacheth no farther then that particular thing; wheras if we erre in this, the whole course and frame of our life must needs hang awry, this being as it were the hinge vpon which it must beare. And yet commonly men are so care<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lesse of this point, that they rush into what course of life soeuer comes next at hand by chance, or fal presently vpon that which the least occasion or hope of commoditie presents vnto them. Some carried with the streame<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> of the world, take the way which seemeth to leade most directly to honour or wealth, perswading themselues that, that is best, because commonly people are so perswaded.

For it is not the part of a seruant, such as we al are, nor can it belong vnto him, to enter vpon what place or office in his maister's house he wil himself, but to take that which his maister ordaineth for him. And this which euerie man ought to doe when he first comes to yeares, and in that crosse-way, as I may say, at which he then arriues, if he haue not done it then, and consequently haue fallen into some errour in the choice which he made of his course of life (if it be not such a state as matrimonie, or some other which cannot be altered, by reason of the obligation annexed vnto it) he must proceed, as in al

Wherefore,<note place="margin">Indifferen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cie neces<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sarie be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore we choose.</note> to the end we may at first settle our estate as it ought, or afterwards take the right course in altering it, if anie alteration be to be made in it, first we must bring ourselues to an Indifferencie, and so quiet our mind, that we hang not more after one thing then after another, but desire meerly to fulfil the wil of God, what soeuer it be. For so it is the dutie of a good seruant to doe, as I sayd before; and if he carrie not himself in this manner, he cannot be sayd to seeke the wil of God, but his owne. But whosoeuer doth this, shal quickly see the heauens cleer of al cloudes, and receaue the light from God, which he desireth.

Wherefore they mightily mistake themselues, who, when they aduise vpon these things, would haue an Angel come to them from heauen, or at least require some such signe of the wil of God, as may be altogeather vnquestionable. For we ought not to doe thus, nor desire anie thing beyond the ordinarie custome and manner of proceeding of God with men.

Secondly, we must present to our consideration, al the courses of life which are sitting to be aduised vpon, and examine and search diligently into euerie one of them, what help, what inconuenience is in it, compared with the final end we ayme at, and resolue vpon that, which both in it self, and for vs, is absolutly the best; as they that are to take a iourney, choose the easiest, the shortest, and the most commodious wayes.

And consequently a man must not so much consider, which Order is most renowned for antiquitie, or for memorable acts in times past, or for the members of holie men that haue been in it, but which now at this present is more holie, more obseruant of Religious discipline, and more ful of that first spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit, wherewith the Order was begun and founded.</p>

And finally, if they be zealous of the good of soules, and for that end spare no labour or paines that is requisite. These are the chiefest and most important things, which are to be looked into. Other things, though of lesse moment, are not also to be neglected; as the greatnes of the Order, if it abound in good subiects, if it be spred farre and neere, if it haue people in it of diuers nations. For so it must needs abound like<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wise in learning and wisedome, and haue greater helps to effect that which it doth vndertake, and more store of good works, by the communication wherof euerie particular man of the Order hath the greater benefit. As a fire is the greater, the more store of wood is layd vpon it, and the wood itself takes the easier, and burnes the faster, and makes the more lightsome fire, when there are manie sticks togeather, then when they are layd one by one.

For God in this great work of Grace hath proceeded as in the principal operations of Nature, vpon which the conseruation of euerie particular thing in his kind depends; for besides the necessitie which is of them, he hath pla<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ted in itching pleasure in them, to draw his workes neuer to cease, neuer to be wearie of that kind of operatio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>. And in like manner hath he contriued this wholesome forme of liuing, that though it be in itself somewhat austere and bitter, yet the wonderful benefit which comes of it, makes it worthie to be desired, as a medecine in sicknes, and againe he hath so sea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>soned it with ioyes and comforts, that though it were not so profitable, it is not<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>withstanding to be infinitly loued for the sweetnes which is in it, and to be pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferred before al mortal comforts.</p>

First, thanks<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>giuing for so great a benefit; secondly, a careful endeauour dayly to encrease in perfection; and finally a diligent and watchful custodie of so ample and so rich a treasure. First therefore, as I sayd, the greatnes of the benefit requireth a thank<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful mind. For if in euerie litle curtesie, which one man doth another, it is held a kind of inciuilitie, not to returne a man tha<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ks for it; how much more vnciuil must it needs be,<note place="margin">Grati<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="2 letters">

And this thankful mind inclu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deth manie things; it includeth knowledge, it includeth memorie, it includeth loue and good wil, it includeth finally ioy euerlasting. For vnlesse a man know and vnderstand, what is giuen him, he cannot be thankful for it; if he know it, and quickly forget it, he is equally vnthankful: but if a man know it and remember it<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> he cannot but be inflamed with excessiue loue of God, because he cannot but loue him that is so good, and so manie

seueral wayes good to him, and finally seing himself so loaded, so enriched, so adorned with his liberaliue, he cannot but reioyce, and excessiuely reioyce at it. But because al depends vpon the knowledge of the greatnes of this benefit, the first thing that we must perswade ourselues of, is, that this vocation to Religion is absolutely the greatest and the soueraignest benefit, which God can bestow vpon man in this life.</p>

And as God tyed the memorie of those ancient benefits, not to euerie ordinarie day, but to dayes that were holie &amp; festiual, to signifie that the remembrance of them must be festi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ual &amp; ful of ioy: so the consideration of this our vocation must be alwayes accom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>panied with cheerful ha<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

<pb n="587" facs="tcp:15193:307"/>
we haue him, it is more to be valued, then if we had al the creatures in the world; and the losse of al creatures, is abundantly recompenced by only possessing God. Besides that, in Religio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> the noblenes of our spirit purchased by forsaking al things, and consequently contemning them, and liuing continually in the contempt of them, makes that there is nothing vpon earth, that can either seeme so beautiful as to deserue our loue, or so harsh and hateful as we should be afrayd of it. Wherefore, to conclude, if we wil shew ourselues to be what indeed we ought to be, and what God desireth we should be, we must neuer cease from giuing thanks to God, neuer slack or relent in it; and though we can neuer returne him so manie thanks as he deserues, not beare him that true affection for his benefits, which the thing itself requires, let vs notwithstanding employ vpon him as manie, as our weaknes is capable of; and acknowledge at least &amp; confesse, that he hath so gone beyond vs with the immensitie of his guifts, that we shal neuer be able so much as to think sufficiently, what thanks is fitting to giue him.</p>
               <p n="5">5. But if we know the true value of this benefit,<note place="margin">Desire of perfection.</note> and esteeme it as we ought, it must needs produce in vs the second thing which I spake of, to wit, an excessiue and euerlasting desire of attayning to perfection; so that al our thoughts, al the powers of our soule, wil be continually bent vpon it. For first, this is that which God requires at our hands, <hi>whose wil is our sanctification.</hi> This his loue demandeth of vs; for it hauing been towards vs so profuse and without stint, we cannot bet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter, nor in a more bountiful manner correspond to his loue, then if we loue him againe, and adorne and set forth ourselues in that manner, that we may truly de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>serue to be loued by him. The state itself in which we are, demandeth it, because it is nothing els but a profession of vertue and perfection. Wherefore, as it is a shame for a souldier to be a coward, and for a student to be no schollar, and men take it as a disgrace to be thought so; so in Religion, where the studie of vertue &amp; sanctitie is only in request, it is a shame to be imperfect, and to follow that busines but coldly,<note place="margin">

For a soule that hath once learned and receaued of our Lord to enter into itself, and within itself to sigh after the presence of God, such a soule, I say, I know not whether it would think it more paineful or more horrible, to suffer the verie, paines of hel for a time, then after hauing once tasted the sweetnes of this spiri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tual studie &amp; exercise, to goe out againe to the allurements or rather to the trou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bles of the flesh, and seeke after the vnsatiable curiositie of sense.</q>

But he that at that time made so slight of it, afterwards lamented his losse, roaring out with a great voice, but when it was too late, &amp; in vaine to repent. In like manner, if we compare secular people with Religious, they are indeed both sonnes of God, but Religious are the first begotten, and haue receaued already greater spiritual blessings in the state itself, &amp; if they liue according to their state, they shal receaue a larger portion of the heauenlie inheritance. What madnes therefore is it for a disordered desire of one vnfortunate and base bit of pleasure, to slight &amp; vtterly to cast away such hopes, such present and future entertainements, such commo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dities, such delights, so manie, &amp; so rare blessings, as if another would goe about to take them from vs, they were worthie to be defended with the losse of our liues.

A fourth was as miserable, if not more miserable then he; for not a ful yeare after he had forsaken the Order, he was shot dead with a pistol. And that which hapned to a Priest was as lamentable, for hauing left the Order, he was kil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led with a mattock by one of his Tenants, for certain iealousies. And an other fel mad and cast himself into a cesterne, from whence being two dayes after taken out and knowne, al the Cittie was in a maze, no bodie making doubt, but that hapned so vnto him, because he had left his vocation. Finally about the same time, another that had left the Societie while he was a Nouice, gaue himself ouer so farre to al kind of wickednes, that at last he came to be put to death for it; and when he was to goe to his execution, after he had made his Confession to one of our Fathers, he fel into a great passion of grief, exceedingly blaming himself for leauing this Paradise, as he called it, and protested, that when he put off the Habit of Religion, it was as if he had put off <hi>Christ,</hi> and set open the gates to al vice.

For thus he discoursed with himself: Betweene that which is limited, &amp; that which is infinit, there is no proportion; &amp; consequently not only one life which a man hath, but though he had manie liues, if it were possible, it were nothing in comparison of the eternal rewards.</p>

In which iourney there falling out some occasion to haue the coffin opened to view the dead corps, he seing it now turned to corruption, and the wormes swarming about it, and gnawing it, presently began to reflect with himself, to what al the power and glorie of that woman was come, whose verie countenance, while she liued, kept the world in awe, and how little difference death makes betwixt a Prince and the poorest creature that is.

And indeed it is a wonder, how men that so much desire to haue al things, which are without them, of the perfectest and compleatest that can be gotten, should notwithstanding not only not desire the perfection of their owne mind, which doth so farre excel the other both in worth, and profit, and importance, but neglect it, and oftimes not so much as looke after it, when they may easily purchase it.

For assisting a Doctour of Diuinitie in the Spiritual Exercises, and the Doctour feeling himself called by God to Religion, and labouring notwithstanding to auoyd it by this kind of fallacie, the Father put him this case: Tel me, sayth he, if you were of force to sayle into the Indies, and among manie ships that were readie to goe the voyage, some better, some worse, the Admiral of the Fleete should inuite you into his owne ship, new, strongly built, wel prouided of al things, sayles, ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bles, Pilot, marriners of the best, would you refuse his curtesie, and cast yourself into a weather-beaten vessel, rotten, and vnprouided of tack<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling and al other furniture? or would you not rather with manie thanks accept of it, or perhaps yourself entreate him, and presse him to admit of you? Much more therefore, to auoyd the ship-wrack of your soule, which is a losse eternal, ought you to choose that state, which may carrie you safe, and in the more assurance, through the dangerous and rockie

seas of this world.</q>
Nothing more cleare and euident; and accordingly the Doctour conceauing of it, and conuinced with the truth, without further demurre, put himself into our Societie.</p>

But let vs suppose for a while, that theve is no such danger in the world, as we speake of; suppose a man be certain to goe to heauen, is it not better notwithstanding to labour not only to come to heauen, but to haue as much glorie in it as possibly we can?

If therefore the case be thus, if these be the conditions, vpon which we may possesse the goods of this world, how much better is it not to haue them, then to haue the vse of them with so manie restraints? For first, it is much easier not to set our affection vpon them when we haue them not, then to haue them and not to affect them. Secondly, there is also more contentment in it; for to be alwayes curbing our affections in that which we haue alwayes before our eyes, is extreme violent, and consequently cannot last long; and for the time that it doth last, it must needs bring vs into a continual warre and debate with ourselues, wonderful difficult &amp; laborious to goe through with; which difficultie they doe not find, who free themselues from the matter that feeds this contentment.</p>

price</hi>; finally, not to repeate al titles, they stand engaged vnto him by the promise which they made in Baptisme, when they were deliuered ouer into his seruice, and, as it were, sworne his souldiers. To withdraw themsel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ues therefore from him, and resolue to be at their owne dispose, is as it were to take away a slaue, or anie thing els from another man; which at least is theft.</p>
               <p n="24">24. And though the case were not thus, yet doubtlesse it is an affront. when inuited so often and so earnestly to his friendship and familiaritie, we refuse it, and neglect his proffers and promises, as if they were not worth the taking vp, or were vncertain. Great men of this world think themselues much wronged, if vpon their entreatie they should be refused. But there is no danger in it, they seldome presse a curtesie so farre vpon any man; people must rather seeke to them for fauour, and entreate hard to be admitted in their seruice, and vse al the meanes they can to insinuate themselues into their good wils. God only is left alone, and neglected, with al his promises and inuitations, though he be farre greater then anie Prince, and make larger offers. A thing to be lamented in the highest degree! And what then shal we think of the offence which is in it? As before I shewed, that it is a haynons sinne, to goe back from Religion, when we haue once vndertaken to follow Christ in it: so they come not farre short of it, that contemne the voyce and counsel of God, when he calleth them to Religion. For, setting aside the obligation which Religious people haue aboue others by the vow and promise which they make, the iniurie (which is that which we now speak of) and the affront, is in a manner alike, to breake friendship, and to refuse to be friends, when friendship is offered: as there is not much difference in the disobe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dience, when a man leaues to doe his Prince's wil after he hath begunne to doe it, and when he resolues neuer to begin. And consequently, as there we shewed. how God doth in a manner alwayes manifest his high displeasure against the first, that forsake him, the like we may expect and make account of in this. And that which we read in the Psalme, doth iustly and in verie truth fal vpon them, that because they would not blessing, it shal be set farre from them; and because they loued maledi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction, it shal befal them, and shal be put vpon them like a garment, and enter like water into their inner parts,<note place="margin">

The euent shewed the meaning of the vision; for one of the number withdrew himself from among them, before they brought their purpose to effect; the other began with the rest, but continued not long: and it was particularly obserued, that though the man was wel borne, and had good friends, al forsooke him, and he came to great miserie, <hi>wandring about the world, like another Cain, cast forth from the face of God.</hi>

Euerie thing dayly hastneth away: we are going to giue-in our accounts to the eternal and terrible Iudge; what therefore should we think of els, but of his coming? For our life is like to one that is at sea; he that is at sea, stands, and sits, and lyes, and goes, because he is carryed with the motion of the ship: So are we, whether we wake, or sleepe, or speak, or hold our peace, or walke, wil we nil we, by moments dayly we go to our end. When therefore the day of our end shal come, where shal we find that, which now we seeke for with so much care, that which we gather with so much sollicitude? We must not seeke after honours and wealth, which must be once forsaken; but if we seeke good things, let vs loue them, which we shal haue without end; and if we feare euil things, let vs feare them, which the reprobate suffer without end. The verie being in a Prince his seruice, what busines doth it draw the mind into, for the desire which we haue of earthlie fauour? and into what feares, least we leese this fauour when once we haue got it? Consider therefore, what tor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment it is, to be moyled now with desires of prosperitie, and then to be appa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led with the feare of aduersitie. Wherefore I would rather aduise, that your Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cellencie would endeauour to liue in your ancient purpose, for this smal time, in some delightsome retirement of this peregrination, and leade a quiet &amp; peace<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able life, attend to the reading of holie bookes, meditate vpon the heauenlie words, inflame yourself with the loue of Eternitie. To liue thus, is euen now to be partaker of the eternal life. This I say vnto you, my noble sonne, because I loue you much. And because you are putting yourself into that, which wil be like waues and tempests to your hart, I labour to draw you back to the shore by the cables of my words: and if you vouchsafe to follow him that draweth you, you wil see when you be on the shore of the quiet, what dangers you haue esca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ped, what ioyes you haue met with.</q>
