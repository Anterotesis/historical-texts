            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

doubtfull that the Major Generall would that night fall in on

a mile diſtant from the Towne, they heard a great noyſe of
running and cluttering, under the place where they had taken
up their ſtanding, which was no other then the running down
of a heard or drove of Cattle, out of the adjoyning mountaine
(being ſenſible by natures inſtinct of the ſtorme that imme<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diatly
followed) to take ſhelter under the Walls of an ancient

where the Skouts ſtood ſentinell, They being amazed in the
night darke, and ſtormy tooke the Alarme for good, ran into
the Towne, and crying out that the Major Generall with his
whole Army, was at hand: Whereupon in all poſt haſt, they
all packt away in the night toward <hi>CARMARTHIN,</hi>
Sir <hi>Henry Vaughon</hi> in the heat of the feare, in a very uncivill
manner taking a long with him Sir <hi>Hugh Owins</hi> his Priſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner
in his ſtockins, not giving him time to pull on his Bootes
and calling him Traitor, avouching that that diſaſter
befell them, by reaſon of his non-complyance, the good
Lady his Wife not willing ſo to leave her Husband, could not
be perſwaded to ſtay behinde but in her night Gown road all

with their pouder had caſt it into the River, leaving their
Cannon and the Towne to the diſcretion of the Major, Ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nerall,
who the day following, entered with his Forces, and
quartered in their places.</p>
            <p>That part of the Country being then well cleared of the E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nemy,

place finely ſeated on a Rock, or little premontory invironed
on two ſides with the sea, and on the land ſide, with very
high thick, and impregnable Wails, Towers, and platformes;
The Major Generall having the firſt day of his ſitting down,
planted a Demi-Culvering, 2200. yeards diſtant from the
North Gate of the Town, with another ſome what lower but
more wide and both on the declyning of the Wind-mi<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

Ships being come about from <hi>Milford,</hi> plaid all from ſeaward

more then the beating downe of ſome of the rooftes of the
Inhabitants houſes: only the Demi-Culvering planted at the
diſtance aforeſaid, and that plaid on the Gate, being attended
with a very expert Cannon-neere, the 3d. day follwoing made
a very forrunate ſhot, and beate open the Wicket through
the Portcullis at which the Major Generalls Foot, then quar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tering

deſperately ran in &amp; preſently poſſeſt themſelves of the place
the Governour <hi>Guin</hi> being ſlightly hurt before and in his
Chamber, not doubting of any ſuch accident &amp; hearning, that
the Souldiers were already entred, ran into the Street, and
incountring them, was there mortally wounded, with ſome

Colonell <hi>David Gwin,</hi> Captaine <hi>Butler,</hi> Captaine <hi>Lewes,</hi>

            </p>
            <p>It is very remarkable, that a place of that ſtrength, and
man'd
with neare as many men as thoſe [that had beſieged
it, ſhould ſo Miraculouſly be taken in, ſo ſhort a
time, where 200. good Souldiers [the Towne Victuled] are
able to defend it againſt an Army of 5000. reſolute men, yet
thus much ought to be aſcribed to the Townſmen, that how<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſoever
formerly they ſtood divided amongſt themſelves, as
terrified with his Lordſhips continuall threats, yet on the
emperiuos demeanonr of <hi>Guin</hi> the Governour, and the inſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lency
of <hi>Butlers</hi> Souldiers, they to late found their error, and
foure dayes before the Major Generalls ſitting downe ſent
him word of their good affection, they had to do him a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny
ſervice which might conduce to make him Maſter of the
place, only this Intelligence was ſubſcribed (<hi>Tinby</hi>) without
any particular hands of the Inhabitants, which the Major
<pb n="24" facs="tcp:59225:16"/>
Generall calling to mind at the firſt entry of the Towne, out
of noblenes, and the deſire he had to preſerve the place from
ruine, offered the Souldiers 200. l. out of his own purſe to for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>beare
the plunder thereof; but ſuch was the greedineſſe of
Captaine <hi>Swanlyes ſea</hi> men, with ſome others of Capt. <hi>Poyers</hi>

            <p>The Major Generall thus miraculouſly proſpering, and his

to ſecond the Governour, could not poſſibly come over, untill
that with much labour and diligence, he made his way by
beating downe of long pooles and Trees into the bottome

Gods great bleſſing obtained ſo miraculous a Victory, aſcribed
the glory to him that gave it, and therupon, tooke up his quar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters

gave preſent order for the embarking of 400. of them, to bee

I have humbly taken leave to extend my advertiſements<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> as a
concluſion to the reſt of my obſervations, ſubmitting the
whole to the wiſdome, and cenſure of this moſt honourable
Court, not expecting to give ſatisfaction to every humour, con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerned
in our diſcourſe, as having therein, tyed up my ſelfe, to
the line and levell of truth, which as neere as poſſible, either my
owne knowledge, or others informations could direct me, hath
beene impartially preſented; If in the circumſtances; of times,
and places, miſtakes of numbers or ſuch like, (the ſubſtance re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerved)
ſome what, either hath bin omitted, [happily miſtaken]
as particulars without the teſtimony of my owne kenning. I
ought nor wholly to be charged therewith; ſince in all doubtfull
and Ambiguous paſſages. I have taken paines, and have
made meanes for punctuall inſtructions, and from ſuch
perſons of worth, as better knew them then a ſtranger (who ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
was there in the very <hi>Principia</hi> of this horrid Warre, nor

permitted, were willing to afford me, which might have more

            <p>It may ſuffice that my aimes, tends to the common good,
without either reſpect of private ends or ſelfe intereſts; whato<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers
may be, which here attend to make friends, feweds, ſides,
and parties; and in a malitious ſedulity ſtrive to compaſſe par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticular

be better diſcerned in their own faces, and comportments, then
otherwiſe drawne in the formes, and porttray of Pen-manſhip
That the Committees [complaynants] have ſuffered much canot
be contraverted neither is it a part of the diſpute in difference,
their loſſes being included in the Common callamity [my owne
particular, being of a ſadder ſtory, then any of theirs] only in
the way of their complaint, it is moſt evident, that malice and
envy, hath ſhared with the moſt in their purſuit, and happily
may obſtruct much of that compenſation, which they might
have expected to receive from the Parliament, eſpecially in their
traducing and blemiſhing of the Innocent, with the nocent,
and thoſe which have merited better things from them then to
have durt caſt in their faces; herein J ſay I muſt leave them to
themſelves, as men overballanced in their oppinions of their
<pb n="47" facs="tcp:59225:27"/>
owne worth; and ſince by the power of reaſon, they have diſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed
to be perſwaded, there alſo J ſhall leave them to be invaded
by the power of their owne abounding ſence: ſure J am that
the Committees here reſiding, have not taken the right way
of their owne repayre; nor for the ſervice of the Country, nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
in the manner of their adreſſe, nor in the meaſure of their
complaint. I wiſh them all peace and happineſſe, with that
great bleſſing of unity amongſt themſelves, without which
neither families can ſubſiſt, nor Kingoms ſtand, otherwiſe then
in a tortering and concuſsive condition. And ſince perſwaſions
cannot prevaile to attone them, when Almighty God hath ſent
the devouring and flaming ſword amongſt them, and yet, it a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vailes
nothing, I crave the priviledge for the publike good, and
the preſent ſervice of the Kingdom, to ſay that the eſtates ought
to interpoſe and to take preſent order therein.</p>
            <p>1. That ſome ſpeedy courſe may be thought upon, how to
reduce the old fewds, and new factions of the Gentry to unity
and Concord amongſt themſelves, both for the common good
and the particuarl advance of the ſervice in thoſe Countries.</p>
            <p>2. That the inſolencies of <hi>Iohn Poyer</hi> late Major of <hi>Pembrook</hi>
with his Souldiers, may be timely reſtrained from further plun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dring
their friends inſtead of their foes, and ſuch of them as are
able, compeld to reſtirution, that ſo the Genlemen and Inha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bitants
of the three Counties, eſpecially ſuch as have faithfully
ſtood to the Parliament, may live peaceably in their own homes
and without moleſtation ſuffered to begin the World a new,
on ſuch relicts of their eſtates, as hath bin by ſome few preſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved
from the fury of the Enemy, and plunder of the Parliament
party, which as yet, and untill a courſe be taken therein, they
dare not adventure to do or looke upon their owne homes and
diſtreſſed Families.</p>
            <p>3. That to that purpoſe, ſome ſevere and exemplaty diſci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pline
may be timely injoyn'd to the Chiefe Commanders, for
ſuppreſſing the boldneſſe of the Souldiers, and of ſuch as are
knowne to be old Theeves, and new plundring Robbers.</p>
            <p>4. That the factious Agents here reſiding, may be ſent home
into their Countries to aſſiſt in this good worke and no longer
ſuffered to foment diviſions, and under colour of publike em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ployment
ſpend on the Countries charge.</p>
            <p>5. That the many ſufferers throughout the three Counties
of <hi>Cardican</hi> and <hi>Carmarthine,</hi> but eſpecially that of <hi>Pembrooke,</hi>
               <pb n="48" facs="tcp:59225:28"/>
and thoſe which have conſtantly ſtood to publike cauſe may be
timely provided for, before they ſtarve, or periſh through the
extreamity of want, whereunto they are now reduced.</p>
            <p>6. That no pretendors to leſſes may by favour of friends in
Parliament preoccupate the eſtates, or Fines of any Delin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quents
within the ſaid Counties, but that in the firſt place, they
may be preſerved, for ſome competent amends to bee made to
ſuch, as have been deſtroyed, and their numerous families, ut<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terly
left without ſubſiſtence and meerly for the Parliaments
ſake.</p>
            <p>7. That ſome worthy and diſcreet Commiſſioners, may be timely deputed to
examine perticular greevances of all kindes; but principally to inquier of ſuch, as
have from little or nothing much inriched themſelves, by following of <hi>Gerrards</hi>
Army, and quarters, and only to make prey on the well-wiſhers, and pertakers
with the Parliament, utterly at preſent unable to come up and to tender their ſad
eſtate to the houſe: There being many of this ſort, throughout the 3. Counties,
which have made up their fortunes, by deſigning and pointing out many an honeſt
man<note n="*" place="margin">
                  <hi>Vide, Ger<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rards</hi> Liſt of ſuch Gentle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men as were by him ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pointed to be queſtioned for their lives and eſtates.</note> and well willer to the Parliament, to utter deſtruction; which amongſt the
greater Delinquents; would ſoone be found out, as fitteſt to make part of the reſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tution
to ſuch, as have bin only damnified by their procurement.</p>
            <p>That it may pleaſe this honourable Court to take notice of the miſerable condi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
of the County of <hi>Pembrooke;</hi> as alſo of the hundred of <hi>Durtleſſe</hi> in the Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie
of <hi>Carmarthin,</hi> where the Inhabitants in the generall are utterly unable to put
a Plow in the ground, it being lamentable to behold, 30. myles together to lye in
a manner utterly waſt, and here and there two or 3. Cowes in harniſes, ſcraping up
the earth to caſt in a little corn, when 500 good Plows have bin heretofore ſeen in
the ſeed time merily to till the ground in plenty.</p>
            <p>Wee ſhall now in all humbleneſſe period our Animadverſions, with our hearty
prayers to Almighty God, that as in this monſtrous unnaturall and ſanguinary
conflict, he hath heitherto ſeconded your painfull indeavours, and in a moſt mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>raculous
manner, extended his high hand, throughout the whole progreſſe of this
horrid War; It may farther pleaſe him (on the proſperity of your Armyes, and
on His Majeſties comming in, after ſo long a range, and fatall deviation, ſo to
conduct your future indeavours as in the firſt place Vnity, and Concord between
both Nations may be inviolably preſerved, and that the generall calamity may be
timely cloſed up in a firme and well eſtabliſhed Peace, to the glory of God, the
honour of the King, and good of the Kingdomes; As alſo that the licentiouſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe
of the times in ſeditious ſpeakings and looſeneſſe of the many disaffected to
you and the publike, and ſo long inured to rapine and plunder, may be ſpeedily re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrained
as in your great providence and wiſdoms, ſhall be thought moſt expedient
either to employ ſome of them for <hi>Ireland,</hi> and others of them, (not to bee truſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed)
cauſed to quit the Kingdom, leaſt a worſe thing happen unto us, and that as
opportunity may fall out, they unhappily put you and the Kingdomes to an after
War, which that it may (by the ſame powerfull arme, (which hath heitherto con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ducted
your councells) be prevented, ſhall be the continuall prayers of him, who
hath born a ſhare, of your care, and to that of his loſſes, offers both this and him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelfe
to yours and the publike ſervice.</p>
