         <editorialDecl>
            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            <p>And to be Dispersed to such as are Impartial Seekers, and Unwearied Searchers into the Deep Things of GOD: Which are only Knowable to that Holy Spirit, that diggeth into the Rich Mines and Treasury of WISDOM: Of which the Author hereof was under a Powerful Driving for the Space of about Thirty Years; keeping a Private Recollection to her self, as they did from Time to Time open, and come down as a Burning Shower; not knowing whether they should have been made Publick in her Age, but thinking rather they might be kept as a Garden Enclosed, and as a Fountain Sealed.</p>
            <p>PRovidence having opened a Door unexpectedly, through the strong Instigation of an highly Worthy Person, truly enobled in the Spirit of his Mind, who having had a savour and
<pb n="4" facs="tcp:29869:7"/>
Relish of some Foregoing Books that had been Printed, did make a generous offer, to have the Bank and Stock of what the Holy Unction had dropped in, brought forth into Manifestation; for the Uni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>versal, Enlightening, Leading and Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>freshing, for the Dove-Flocks belonging to the Great Shepherd, to whom such Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stures lie open to be freely fed upon; I think my self obliged to Publish for these Ends, what can be recovered of the Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cess and Diary of my Life, since I have been under these Love-Visitations from the Spirit of my Lord. The Time being now accomplished, wherein the Hour-glass of the Spirit is a second time turned up, for the which there is a Call from the <hi>New Jerusalem</hi> World, that all Persons of e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>very Quality, Rank and Degree, under what Denomination soever they be, through<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out all Nations, Peoples, and Languages, do give eart and watch every Golden Sand that this Glass doth run, that no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing of it may run wast. For it is the Morning-Watch and Day-break of the Spirit, that is to spread forth its Light and Glory, whereby is to be enlightned the Dark Ignorant State of the World, who have sat in the Region of Traditional
<pb n="5" facs="tcp:29869:7"/>
and Literal Knowledge, according to the Rational Wisdom of Man, which through the Innundation of the Spirit must all be drowned, and a New Earth prepared, wherein the Sowing of the Spirit is to be with one pure Golden Grain, that can admit of no mingling, of what is from Man; for another Time is now at hand, wherein nothing but what is purely taught of God shall abide and stand. Therefore as one that hath obtained through Infinite Love, and large Grace, to be Baptized into this Glorious Manifestation of the Spirit, I do beseech and excite all to whom this Journal shall come, that they do well observe and take diligent notice of the Method and Way, which God took with me, in order to the bringing me for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward to the Arrivement at the manifold. Degrees and Growths, which is here in a most simple and undress'd manner brought forth, without any Alteration; but just as the Spirit was pleased to ren<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der it self in its own Cloathing. So in obedience to the Call of Wisdom, may the same Visitation of Immediate Divine Teaching, as a Day-star in your Hearts appear, which may your Souls greatly re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vive and chear.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="6" facs="tcp:29869:8"/>
Now give me leave to tell you the Begin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning of my Way that the Spirit first led me into. In the first place then, after some Years that I had lived in some good Degree of an Illuminated Knowledge, set<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting under the Visible Teachings of Men, that could give no further Light than that they had arrived from others, through all of which I traced as a wandring Spirit that could find no Rest: but something still I found within my self that did open to draw in from a more pure Air, then I could meet without me: Whereupon I introver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted more into my own Inward Deep, where I did meet with that which I could not find elsewhere; except it were with such as were brought under the same Dispensation, of whom a few Names were made known unto me. Wherefore I do give my own Experience, that I would have every one that desires to be Sealed with the Spirit of Wisdom and Revelation, not to take in any Fears, Jealousies or Prejudices, concerning the Emanations and Manudu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctions that the Holy Ghost will dispense forth, as any shall be found Lovers and Waiters thereupon. For I my self found all other Grounds and Pastures dry and barren, as a parched Desart; until I
<pb n="7" facs="tcp:29869:8"/>
came to this Fruitful <hi>Lebanon,</hi> where all Variety of sweet scented Flowers, did as another <hi>Eden</hi> flourish pleasantly. Which were known and enjoyed by giving up to the Teaching of the Holy Unction, which as the Waters of the Sanctuary, will ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver cease springing, till they become an Overwhelming River, which is the true Baptizing Water of Life. This you will find to be true, as you seriously apply your self to this Way and Method of God's Immediate Teaching: Which then you shall find to open in the Center of your own Soul. And this way manifesteth it self in a various Dispensation. Sometimes this is by Inspeaking from the Essential Word, which giveth its own certain Sound, as different Occasions do offer, upon a Soul's waiting thereupon. For it would be a very deplorable Case, if Christ should leave his Flock, and seal up the Fountain of all Future Revelation, that is no neces<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sary to be Renewed in every Age of Time. Therefore he brings us to lie at the Mouth of this bubling Well of his Spirit, for to drink in what is New and Fresh, which doth greatly delight the Soul; that would otherwise be apt to faint and flag, before it come to the end of its Race. Where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
<pb n="8" facs="tcp:29869:9"/>
he doth strow our Way, wit<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">
                  <desc>•…</desc>
               </gap> fragrant Flowers, all sweet and pleasant, and of many and beautiful Colours; as you may observe when you read the Similitudes and Visions which are here Published; God many times coming down to unfold himself in this Figurative and Parabo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lical. Yet more Essentially and Deeper, above and beyond all Figures and Repre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sentations, of which I shall give you some account as being under Command not to keep back, or shun to declare the whole Purport whereinto I have been carried; for the universal Refreshment and Benefit of such who are as meaned Children from every other Breast, but that of their Eter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal Mother, whence all Wisdom and Understanding doth stream forth Intel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lectually, which is the growing Nutriment, as it doth pass Radically into the Soul, as the Blood doth into the Veins. Now here is a Cessation of Sensible Images, for all is turned into an Intellectual Sight, Operation, and Sensation. From this Center of Light, though no visible Images are impressed or raised thereupon, yet here is the true Ground and Substance of all which are in an Interiour Figure portrayed in the Spirit of the Mind, and brought
<pb n="9" facs="tcp:29869:9"/>
out no further, but do remain an Invisible Indea, just as it is with God himself, before he formeth out of the Essential Ground, Shapes and Figures of Things. So as these may conduce as much to the Informing and Enlightning, Renew<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing and Comforting, and even Essentializing of the Spirit into God, as any of the other; nay, I know it to be the more Sure Ground, and Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>center of the Spirit: and if it should never know any of those other Figurative Visions; yet keeping to the Center to drink in the pure Streams of Revelations, as they arise herefrom, it shall give them an Access into the Full Body and Center of the Trinity; which swallows up all of Sha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dows and Pictures, and terminates into the very Essentiality of a God-Formation, into Substan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tial Powers acting in, and from the pure Essence of Spirit in Transnewed Nature. Thus <hi>Intel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lectual</hi> Vision, thus considered, is the very next Step to that <hi>Beatifical</hi> Vision, or Seeing of O<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">
                  <desc>•…</desc>
               </gap>d barely, without any other Medium, but the very express Personality of the Lord JESUS; by being so consummated into the Essence of his Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit and Light, as that whatever is knowable and obvious to Him, may also our Sight of Light be, both here in Time, and hereafter in Eternity. Which is an unknown Mystery: of which an ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count may be hereafter more fully given, as it shall be entred into.</p>
            <p>As to the Other Sort of Vision, that is no New Ministration. For it is of Old that God did thus often make out himself, as a more taking and
<pb n="10" facs="tcp:29869:10"/>
plain Way, in raising Images distinct, for Teach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ableness unto us. And this proceeds from ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther Center than that of the Intellectual: it is more Deep. Some Persons may stand in this Center-Line naturally of Seeing, and Awakening a Formation out of this Center, according to the strong Impression of their Minds, by various Fi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gures. If the Mind of such be Pure, and ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dently run into Heavenly Objects, it will raise Appearances suitably: and there will be an Awa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kening, and Drawing out of various Specula<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions of Beauty and Glory, as may forespeak what is to be accomplished, in a Particular way. This Way of God's Manifestation, hath been fre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quent in Former, and in This Present Time: But these are Props for the Weak, that they may not faint in their Way up to God's Mountain of more Perfect and Naked Vision. Now of this kind of Vision I have been much visited withal: but I press to get beyond it. Here is no Stay: the Ground from whence these open is too Shal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low. I am driven now to descend Deeper, where the Spirit even level may be with its own. Eternal Essentiality; that Power therefrom it may have, to Make and Form whatever it will; in, and from Substance that is Original.</p>
            <p>Then as there is of Divine Vision, that opens from the Holy and Heavenly Mind, which draw<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth in these Presentations; so there is another Sort of Vision that is from the Starry Influence, and Working Power of the Elements, that in conjunction are with the Common Spirit and Mind
<pb n="11" facs="tcp:29869:10"/>
of a Person. And though there be not any Emi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nent Work of Regeneration, yet there may be Vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sion: as <hi>Balaam</hi> was, and others, had that Gift, and yet were not Renewed in their Spirits, or brought nigh to God thereby. Such notwithstanding may have Power to raise many Images that may fore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tell and signifie what is to come to pass. For there is a Starry Magia, that some may have a Natural Property to open in themselves: and it doth sometimes awaken into Manifestation in the deep of Sleep, and giveth Warning of Evil that is to come, and Shews of Good; as relating to the present Manifestation of Time. And this may be, and is, a Common Gift. But where it is in a Sanctified Vessel, it is far otherwise illustrated then in those who nothing of that can give proof of.</p>
            <p>So now hence we see the different Nature of Vision, and of Prophetical Intelligence therefrom, that we may watch to every Center opening. For the Serpent's Subtilty stands ready to mingle, where ever he can enter in. For he is a great Magical Prince, and the outward Planets are <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 word">
                  <desc>〈◊〉</desc>
               </gap> his Operators in the Constitution of the meer Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tural Man. Now of all these, the most Safe is the Intellectual and Divine Vision, that openeth from the more profound Center-Deep: but yet no<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">
                  <desc>•…</desc>
               </gap> so as that we are to stick here even in this.</p>
            <p>For there is a Center Deeper still, where the Deity unmasked is of all Figures and Images, known and seen in his own Simplified Being. And when in Spirit caught up here, we see all the various Wonders, brought forth in the very Life. Essen-tial
<pb n="12" facs="tcp:29869:11"/>
Property, as wrought out of God immediately, and in their Living Figures, as the innumerable Hosts, which do replenish the Heaven of God's Habitation: which is the purest and most infal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lible Vision, that our Spirits may Eternally Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>center in, with all the delightful Satisfaction, that the very Angels before the Throne of God's Majesty do enjoy. So we may this know as of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten as from all Bodily Sense we can get away. For this kind of Vision highly different is from that which we call Divine, or Intellectual; be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause it doth all over sublime the Spirit, Soul, and Body, during the time that the Munition-Flame of the Holy One doth as a Pavilion all over spread, and keepeth all of Sense at the Foot of the Mount, while Spirit entreth into the Ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bernacle-Glory of the Holy Trinity.</p>
            <p>This sort of Vision the Beloved <hi>John</hi> was in, when being wholly caught up <hi>in the Spirit,</hi> he saw all the Variety of the Lord's Kingdom, and <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 word">
                  <desc>〈◊〉</desc>
               </gap> expresse Personality. Since which we have not known any in late Ages that have been in the like Transportation in Spirit, and yet alive in the Body, to declare of what was seen and heard after such a Wonderful Way as he had. But the Author must (to the Honour of God) own, that something, not unlike to this, hath been to her manisested. Such Grace and Love Our JESUS doth again afford, and bringeth himself into our Knowledge, by this Way of the Spirit clear and free; that we may know him that is True, and receive by this Highest Vision-Mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stration, the full extent of his Will and Mind:
<pb n="13" facs="tcp:29869:11"/>
that is, that we may both see, and hear, as if we were out of the Body of Corporeity, while yet in the Body; as Supersensualized to know, and behold purely, through the Organical Properties of the Spirit, according as every Objection in Heavenly Places in their Order do move in re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ference to our Cohabitation within those Circu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lations through the Spiritual Body.</p>
            <p>Thus have I brought forth out of the deepest Deep, what the present Measure of my Know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge and Experience is, in this Mystical Dispen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sation. Which hereby is as the New and best of Wine that hath been reserved for this Last Time. Whereby it may be understood, that Christ has not forgotten to make good his Promise, to renew the Spring of his Spirit, by a continued Succession of it. And as we see and hear the Fruitfulness of it doth more generally abound, and find entertain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment in the World, by a New Generation of A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>postolical Spirits, so doth it presage a New King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom and State is near approaching. Which is Argument enough to provoke all that would be Subjects of this Kingdom, which the Lamb has only Right unto, to be preparing and making Ready, as the First Fruits, that they may be Qua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lified to make up this <hi>New Jerusalem-</hi>Bride. Therefore as my Fellow Denizens of this City, which is from Above, where-ever ye are hidden, whether as Exiles, or Captives scattered to and fro, I beseech you let your Inward Ear he atten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tive, keeping Watch and Ward in great Calm<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness and Stillness of Mind. Then may ye bear the Love-Calls, passing through that Horn which
<pb n="14" facs="tcp:29869:12"/>
is filled with pure Oil, that will gather and draw you into the High, Celestial, and Spiritual Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sture, and Fold; where our goodly Tents may be Pitched, and of which we may go in and out, to that rich <hi>Sharon,</hi> which springs and flowers round about our Kingly Shepherd; that so as his Sheep and Lambs we may be gently led from Fountain to Fountain, and drink and feed together, in the same Harmony and Unity; as do the Saints in the Upper Fold, so we in this Lower.</p>
            <p>I shall now wind up all with a Caut<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">
                  <desc>•…</desc>
               </gap>n to two Ranks: the First shall be to the Unlearned and Ignorant in this Method and Way of the Spirit's Manifestation. Which is, that they do forbear Rash and Censorious Judgment upon those Things that are at present above their Reach. For as they desire not to be prevented and bereaved of the Great Benefit of Divine Inspiration, and the As<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sistances of the Holy Ghost, my Advertisement to such is, that they become Simple and Child-like, and adventure upon the Conduct and Manifesta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions of the Holy Spirit, then will they find ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther manner of fruitful Life will in them spring, and no reason shall they have to repent for Acqui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>escing to the Divine Will herein. The Second Caution shall be to that sort, which are already Initiated into this our Mystick and Supersensual Wisdom, that may have with me run deep into the Ocean of what is Mysterious and Wonderful for Knowledge. First I must caution you, with my self, to keep very Low, entring into a Self-Anni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hilation, so as a Nothing to be, with reference to the Creaturely Being, that the All-Deifick Unction
<pb n="15" facs="tcp:29869:12"/>
may arise as an overflowing Tide: and never to think we have obtained by all that we have yet reached to, what yet remains of those Immense Treasures, which are yet further to be Revealed. For there is still a growing Tree of Life, that reneweth all Variety of Wisdom; as you will in part find by this Present, as well as by some Foregoing Books by me Published.</p>
            <p>Thus having given you a true Narrative of the Several Removes and Risings, from one De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gree to another, from Depths to Heights, and from Heights again to Depths; out of which hath been Brought forth very Marvellous and Wonderful Secrets: which it was the pleasure of the Fountain of Spirits to distribute and com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>municate; being such Mysterious Things as haply may be rarely found elsewhere; which hath often me astonished, that such Unusual and Strange a Method the Spirit should take with me, opening such things. But it hath been given me to know, upon a Diligent Inquiry, that there is an Age coming on, the like to which hath not yet been, to whom these Prophesies and Revela<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions do belong. So that though the Day of my Life is far spent, so that I may not see the full Harvest, of what is by the Spirit sown here, to be reaped; yet assured I am that all is reserved for a Glorious Time, wherein shall arise a New Generation, that clothed upon will be with such a Mantle, as is interwoven with Light, Wisdom, Knowledge and Flaming Power. Among which
<pb n="16" facs="tcp:29869:13"/>
there may be some that I may bear the Memorial of a Mother to as well Natural as Supernatural; that may possibly succeed in the same Spirit, which I shall pray may be as Wisdom's Key, to go on to open in them the Golden Remains, which are yet to be brought forth, for the promulgation of the Priestly and Prophetical Kingdom, upon the Earth. So now I shall conclude, requesting you as you shall draw in any Light, or feel any Refreshment herefrom, that you would join with me in Accla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mations and Praises to the Antient of Days, who hath put into the Hands of a Good-willer to these Divine Mysteries, to bring forth into the Pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lick, what might otherwise have been left in Oblivion and Secresie. And it is my pecu<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">

<pb facs="tcp:29869:15"/>
I can say, that I am more than Morally Assured, That the All-wise God hath here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by Ends to bring about, which the most Acute and <hi>Vulturous</hi> Eye of the Greatest Rationalist shall never be able to dive into: and that all will serve but to a Fuller Breaking out of the Truth, and the Divine Light; that True Light, which Enlightens every one that comes into the World, so far as it is not Resisted, and according to the Degree of Purity in the Vessel, for the Reception and Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flexion of its Rays.</p>
            <p>This is an Age that thinks it self to excel all that have ever went before it, in the Discovery and Improvement of Truths: and it cannot be denied, but that of these late years Mechanical Know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge hath been brought up to a very great Height, which hath had both its Good and Bad Effects in the World. But notwithstanding all the Fancied or Real Light, in matters either Physical or Theo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>logical; which the Present Age doth so much boast of; it may perhaps not un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fitly enough be said of those of that make the chiefest Cry, that <hi>the Veil is still be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore their Eyes.</hi> And let these Imagin what they please, and Pride themselves
<pb facs="tcp:29869:15"/>
in the Penetration of their Sight, they must all sooner or later be convinced, that it will be impossible, without the Immediate Hand of Christ, to rend away the Veil: or to penetrate through it into the Sanctuary of God, or of Nature; without the Great High Priest, bearing the Oracle of Truth upon his Breast, do make a way for them to enter in: and do both open their Eyes and Ears, that seeing, they may see; and hearing, they may hear, whatever is written by his Finger, or spoken by his Mouth. Let not the Blind think they see, or the Deaf be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve they hear: but especially let both take heed not to be Offended at those Little ones (as the Jews were of old) whose Eyes, or Ears have been Opened by the Word and Power of JESUS.</p>
            <p>And that there may be some Such even in This Day, wherein Materialism and Sadducism do certainly no less, (if not much more) eminently, than in the First Day of Christs Appearance in a low Corporeal Form, Reign and Triumph; will not seem perhaps so very strange, or in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>credible, as to many it may at first appear to be, when what is Now here Published, as well as what hath been already Pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>l<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">

            <p>For in all Ages of the World God hath had some special Friends, though per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>haps hidden for the most part from the World, because they were not of it: with whom in a more Familiar and In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>timate manner he hath chosen to converse, and manifest himself.

<pb facs="tcp:29869:17"/>
Kingdom of Christ: which is now in the Fulness of Time about to be re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>revealed, at His Second expected Coming, in the Power and Glory of the Father, to Judge both the Quick and the Dead, according to everlasting Righteousness and Equity, and to put down all Ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mies under his Feet; that so he may not only for a Thousand Years, which are to him but as One Day, but for Ever sit upon his Holy Hill of <hi>Sion,</hi> governing all Worlds with a Scepter of Holiness, as the LORD of LORDS, and KING of KINGS.</p>
            <p>Wherefore the Spirit of the Lord, which hath more, or less, in all Ages thus moved (as in a particular Treatise on this Subject shortly to be Published is at large Proved) upon the face of the meek and deep silent Waters, in the Souls of such, as have been first made clean through the Washing of the Word; will certain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly not fail to move upon them in this Last Age, in order to a New and Glori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous Creation of New Heavens and a New Earth. <hi>And the Inspiration of the Almighty,</hi> which <hi>giveth</hi> man <hi>Understand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing,</hi> may with some reason be hoped not to have been quite Exhausted in the for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer

Ages, but that he will appear even unto Us, as he did appear unto Them; opening Variously the Springs of all Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritual, and even Natural Knowledge: and will thereby renew also those Noble Works, and Deeds of Royal Power, that he did in the days of our Fathers, the Holy Prophets and Apostles; and in the Old time before them, even in the be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginning of the Creation of God: Before Man had corrupted his way; or had ali<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>enated himself from the Image of the Everlasting Light, and the Unspotted Mirror of the Power of God. While not having cut himself off from the pure Streams, flowing from the Glory of the Almighty, he might, as His Representa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tive, Oversee, and Govern all the Creatures of this Globe, whether in the Earth, or in the Water under the Earth, or in the Air above it; by virtue of that Soveraign Charter committed to him, <hi>Gen.</hi> 1. 28.</p>
            <p>Which Charter having been forfeited, the Divine Character expunged, the Seals broken, all the Ensigns of Royalty de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>faced, the Virgin Image deflowred, and the Angelical Life and Might exchanged for that contemptible weak Form, which
<pb facs="tcp:29869:18"/>
we now wear, that is subject to the curse of Mortality and Sin; It is again renew<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed to us, much more strongly than at first, through the Pure Humanity of Christ, which is exalted above all the Principalities and Powers in the Heaven<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly Places; the express Character of the Father afresh imprinted, as in the ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry Forehead; a new and everlasting Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mission established, to go forth and act in the Tri-un Name of Father, Son, and Holy Ghost, which is sealed with the Heart of Jesus; All the Royal Ensigns are redelivered, the Crown of Immortality, the Scepter of Righteousness, and the Love Imperial Standard of JEHOVAH; the Violated Image is restored, the Image of the Beast ground to Powder, and his Number perfectly raced. So that the Bestial and Antichristian Kingdom being hereby brought to an end, a new <hi>Aera</hi> of the Kingdom of Christ doth there up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on Commence; first in particular Souls, then in the whole Family of the First<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>born, after that in the Great Assembly of the After-born, and so on till the whole Mass be Leavened and Transmu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted by the Ferment of the Divine Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, passing through the Glorified Body
<pb facs="tcp:29869:18"/>
of Jesus, that is able to subdue every thing unto it self. This verily is that Kingdom, which is so much talked of, and so little every where understood, but less still pressed after: which is in this Book, and in that also of <hi>the Revelation of Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>velations</hi> (Published now ten years Ago,) so Essentially and Fundamentally decla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red; as nothing Higher, nothing Deeper can upon this Subject be ever laid down, whether in Time, or in Eternity.</p>
            <p>And because <hi>Solomon,</hi> (whose Reign was as a faint <hi>Sketch</hi> or Type, of the Glorious Reign of the true <hi>Jedidiah,</hi> or Beloved of the Lord) built himself a Royal Palace in <hi>Lebanon,</hi> which was a fruitful and a well-watered Soil, and most beautiful for its scituation, where he made Gardens and Orchards, plant<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing in them Trees of all the variety of most excellent Fruits, also Cedars and Fir-Trees for Building; with great Wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter-works, Pools of Water, and Foun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tains; with a fair Tower also looking to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward <hi>Damascus;</hi> and with a Vineyard of Red-wine, where he entertained his <hi>Shu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lamite</hi> Queen, and her Honourable Wo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men: Therefore is the Palace, or Mansi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on-house of the Great KING, the true

But, alas! I see, that the most even of those that have been enroll'd under Her Discipline, will be not a little afraid to lay hold on this Key of the Kingdom, when it is reached out to them: and will shrink from it, beholding how large it is, and that it is made full of all Solid Gold; even as this very Author did at its first Presentment, as thinking

Of which it must be confessed that much has bcen Lost; so that the Links of Wisdom's Chain may often seem to be broken. But as the greatest Architect, Statuary, and Painter of these Last Ages, is said to have become so Excellent, meerly by his Ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>servations drawn from a most Imperfect Maimed Statue, or Bust, being the Work of a most Exquisite and Masterly Hand: so it is not at all to be despaired, but that there may be found also in This Day some of Rare and Excellent Abili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties of Spirit, who, notwithstanding any Imperfections or Maimings of this Spiri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tual Register, or any Defects in its Exte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rior

               <hi>Europe.</hi> For when Wisdom's Key is obtained, and her Book unsealed in any, according to the Process here des<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cribed; then may all the Depths of Phi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>losophy, as well as of Divinity, and all the Hidden Treasury of Wisdom; in All Worthy Arts and Sciences, be successive<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly broken up. And thus, as from one Foot of the <hi>Rhodian</hi> Coloss, (which is to This Day preserved) every one that is but skilled in the Proportions of the Human Body, can exactly Calculate what the Whole should be, and Know thence how to frame one accordingly: so every one to whom God has given some good degree of Understanding in the Symme<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>try and Proportions of the Spiritual Body, will notwithstanding any Intervening Breaches, or Abrupt Transitions, be able hence to Frame some suitable Idea of the
<pb facs="tcp:29869:25"/>
whole Design and Oeconomy of God, in the Manifestation of his Kingdom to Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parated and Virginiz'd Souls.</p>
            <p>Now the Manifestation of this Divine Kingdom is Various in Several Persons, and in the same Person at several Times. Whence this Variety in the Descent of the Heavenly and Ghostly Powers, (whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther in this Principle or in another) and of the Joys of the World to come, is here not unfitly Symboliz'd out by a <hi>Garden,</hi> or <hi>Paradise;</hi> as it was by the King thereof himself in his truly Graci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous Answer to the Penitent Thief. And yet more Expressively is this Flourish<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing State of the Lamb's Elect Bride Ci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pher'd to us by a <hi>Fountain of Gardens,</hi> or <hi>Paradises,</hi> planted with all Trees of Frankincense, Myrrh, and Alloes, and with all the chief Spices; out of which the Royal Ointment is prepared for the Consecration of such Priestly Kings, as are to Reign upon the Earth in the Lamb's Nature, and Name. Which shall make all the Wild Beasts of the Forest to fly into Dens and Lurking Holes, and eve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry Venemous Creature to hide it self from the Great <hi>Attick Iomin,</hi> in his Representatives, and from the Fiery
<pb facs="tcp:29869:25"/>
Stream issuing out of his Mouth; by which the Spirit of Antichrist, that Huge <hi>Leviathan,</hi> shall be utterly Destroyed.</p>
            <p>So will the Kingdom of Christ manifest it self, by a Gradual, but Total, over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>throw of that of Him, who has Usurped all the Kingdoms of the Earth; until all that which he has caused to be as a Wilder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness by the Blast of his Poisonous Breath, be again Renewed, and made to be as the Garden of God, filled with Wells of Living Water, and Streams from the Up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per <hi>Lebanon:</hi> A Garden giving forth all the Variety of Flowers and Fruits of Life, according to the Seasons, and ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to every ones Essential Ground, and Internal Soil: a Garden in which there is not any mixt Tree, existing from the Root of the outward Elements, con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taining Good and Evil, Truth and Fals<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hood, Light and Darkness; but all whose Trees are Trees of Life, all whose Plants are Plants of Righteousness, all perfect<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly Good and True, All-beautiful and Lustrous.</p>
            <p>How various the Manifestation of this <hi>Lebanon-Kingdom</hi> will be, no Pen can describe, no Tongue can express. That is Various indeed: but the Manifester all
<pb facs="tcp:29869:26"/>
the while is but One; and the Essential Word of God, <hi>which is the Worker of all</hi> these <hi>things,</hi> is most Uniform. The Manuductions, Illuminations, and Inspi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rations are very different, but still there is but one Way, one Light, and one Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit; one Lord, and one God and Father of our Lord Jesus Christ, and of us all; who in these last Days is about to appear yet more fully to us by his Son, setting him Openly upon his Holy Hill. Thus he who is the Abyssal Unity of all Beings, clotheth himself as with several Names, r<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">
                  <desc>•…</desc>
               </gap> forth in several Powers, weareth on his Head several Crowns, and glan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceth from his Eyes several Lights. And yet there is but One Crown, One Power, and One Name, as there is but One Light; which diffuseth it self in all the variety of Colours. Which Unity and Variety of Light is well to be heeded in the Reading of this Book, and of all other Spiritual Treatises whatever, of what Rank or Degree soever they be. For God sometimes appears in the Dark<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness, and yet in that Darkness there is Light: again he appears in the Light, and yet Darkness may be mixed with this Light, till the Perfect Day do spring
<pb facs="tcp:29869:26"/>
from on High. Thus he appears to some at a distance, as in a <hi>great and strong Wind;</hi> to others in an <hi>Earthquake:</hi> in both which Formes he eminently manifest<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed himself through some, about the Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginning of the Last Century. Then af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter this, approaching still nearer, he ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ppears to a third sort in the <hi>Fire:</hi> as at this very Day he powerfully doth to some, that are known to Wisdom's Dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciplehood. And lastly he demonstrates his Presence to some, as to this his Chosen Vessel, in a <hi>still small Voice,</hi> and in a sweet, gentle, lambent Flame. Some<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times God manifests himself to the Eye or Ear of the Receptive Heart, accord<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to the several Properties, Operations, and Influxes of this or that Name, which he puts on; of this or that Attribute, which he communicates; of this or that Sphere, in which the Living Wheels of the Creatures before the Throne of God do move. Thus was he manifested to the Unregenerate Spirit of <hi>Balaam,</hi> ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to the eficacy of the Name <hi>Shad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dai;</hi> who <hi>saw the Vision</hi> of him in this Si<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>militude or Vesture, falling into a Trance: And this is the lowest sort of True Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vine Prophesie. Then was he Manifested
<pb facs="tcp:29869:27"/>
unto <hi>Abraham,</hi> unto <hi>Isaac,</hi> and unto <hi>Jacob</hi> by the Name of <hi>El-Shaddai:</hi> which is a much higher Degree than the former; as that whereby is expressed, not only the Paternal Property in the Absolute Soveraignty of his Will, but also the Meek Love-Principle co-joined with it in a Federal Rite. After this he was manifested under the Law, at sun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dry Times, and in divers Manners, by the Most Essential, and Great Name of the Covenant, <hi>Jehovah;</hi> but still accord<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to the variety of the Vessel, and its fitness to receive the Emanations there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of, either in a High or Low Degree. Then lastly he was made known, under the Gospel, to the Apostles, to the Evan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gelists, to the Prophets, and to other Ranks mentioned in the Apostolical Epi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stles by the Name of <hi>Jesus:</hi> which Name doth Unseal, and Open that of <hi>Jehovah;</hi> whence the Miraculous Powers did so abound in the Early Days of the Church, while there was Faith in this Name. But still it is the same One, Holy and True God that revealed himself both to the Vile Son of <hi>Beor,</hi> and to the most Hero<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ick Father of the Faithful; though not by the same Name. And he is never<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>theless
<pb facs="tcp:29869:27"/>
One, and having Appeared after Manner, and in that Name, to the Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>
               <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">
                  <desc>•…</desc>
               </gap>hets of Old, and then speaking after another Manner, and by another Name <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">
                  <desc>•…</desc>
               </gap>n their Successors the Prophets. Nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther would he be the less so, should he even speak to us, after another Manner than he hath yet spoken either to the Prophets, or to the Apostles: or should he make himself known to us by a Name, whereby he <hi>was not known to them.</hi> He is still the same, let the Vessel be never so Different: and is equally to be Ado<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red and Believed, whether he takes up an Honourable or Dishonourable Vessel, Learned or Ignorant, Noble or Plebei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>an; whether the Instrument be a Priest or Levite, Israelite or Proselite, Male or Female, Young or Old. Some has he called from the Plow, others from ga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thering of Sycamore Trees, and others from their Drag-Nets; whom he has set over the Nations and over the Kingdoms, to Root out and to Plant, to Throw down and to Build up, by the mighty Power of his Spirit according to its va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rious Operation, and Manifestation. It matters not what the Subject is, into
<pb facs="tcp:29869:28"/>
which the Divine Influences are receiv'd, and through which they pass: even though it should be an Heathen, as in the Case of <hi>Jethro;</hi> or a Brute Beast, as in that of <hi>Balaam.</hi> The Gradation nevertheless of these Influences may be computed according to the Scituation, and according to the Proximity and Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moteness of the Subject which is to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive them, from the Source, or Center of Divine Light, and according to the several Channels and Ducts that they must first pass through, before they are there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in received. But the All-wise God is never wanting in the Preparation of such Vessels, as may be suitable for the Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ception of such Degrees of his Light, as he designs to Communicate. And this Beautiful Variety is in the Writings of the Old Testament, and also in those of the New most Remarkable. For it is one Degree of Inspiration that <hi>Moses</hi> had, and another that <hi>Is<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">
                     <desc>•…</desc>
                  </gap>iah</hi> had, and third that <hi>Daniel</hi> had. Neither is the Inspiration of the Writer of the <hi>Chro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nicles</hi> the same with either of these Three: And yet both the one and the other are all from the True Inspiring
<pb facs="tcp:29869:28"/>
Breath of God. The Like may also be observed in the New Testament. But to Treat of this would require a large Discourse. What has been here alrea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy said, will suffice for the Wise in Heart; that they may understand the Voice of the Lord their Bridegroom, when he shall call to them, <hi>in the Cool of the Day,</hi> and present himself <hi>walk<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing in the Garden;</hi> that they may not seek to hide themselves from him, but may walk therein leaning upon his Breast, and refresh themselves with its Flowers and Fruits, that do there present them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves to be Plucked.</p>
            <p>As for the Removal of that Great Milstone, which is thrown in the way, <hi>That God hath ceased to Reveal him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>self to Man since the Days of the Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stles, and that all Pretensions to the same are but Illusions, and at best but the Dreams and Fancies of a Natural Enthusiasm;</hi> I am not very sollicitous, as well knowing that the same God, who hath already appeared in a most Wonderful Manner to give his Testimo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny to Souls concerning what hath been hitherto Published from the same Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit
<pb facs="tcp:29869:29"/>
and Instrument, will not be wanting Now to give his Seal lo This, or to what Hereafter may come to be Pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lished: and even in a more ample and fuller manner to Vindicate his Honour, than he hath been yet known to have done since the Primitive Days of Faith. But howsoever the Wisdom of God may, with respect to these Particular Writings, shew it self at present, this Milstone must shortly be cast into the Sea. Otherwise the Kingdom of God, which we daily ought to pray for, can never come: And it is little better but a Mockery of his Name to sollicite him for the Calling of the Jews, and the Fulness of the Gentiles, and for Unity, Peace, and Concord to all Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions; till this Beam be removed from before the Eye of our Spirits. For which End there hath been some while since a Treatise writ, to Prove not on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly the Possibility, and the Expediency, but even the Absolute Necessity of Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vine Revelation, both Private and Pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lick; as in the Ancient Times, so no less in the Present Time, toward the Restitution and Winding up of All
<pb facs="tcp:29869:29"/>
Things: Which the Author of it un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dertakes to evince from plain and evi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent Principles, not disputed by the very Deists; and having done with them, to Clear up many Passages through<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out the Prophets, and throughout the whole New Testament, which are im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>possible, as he holds, to be Account<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed for by any other Principles. But how Successful such a New and Sur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prizing Attempt may be, is entirely submitted to the Disposal of the Infi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nitely Wise God, when he shall order it to come forth, for his Honour alone, and for no other Aim whatever. And unless he gives this Order, and by his Blessed Spirit do Accompany it, let it never see the Day: And whatever dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>agreeable to his Glory, or Inconsistent with his Truth, may have at any time been sent abroad of such a Nature, let it moulder away in Perpetual Obscuri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty: and let it not be remembred by Him, when he maketh Inquisition, or even known among Men. But what<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever is consistent with his Eternal Truth, and makes for his Glory up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on the Earth in this Latter Day, let

Now consider of my Saying till I return to thee again.</p>
               <p>This Vision took great Impression on me, yet I kept it for the present hid, but it Operated so much upon me, as indeed I was incapable to converse with any Mortals; which was taken notice of, that some extraordinary thing had hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pened; for the which I begged my Friends excuse, and desired that she would give me the liberty to be much alone, and to walk in the silent VVoods; where I might contemplate what had so lately happened. Now after three days, sitting under a Tree, the same Fi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gure in greater Glory did appear, with a Crown upon her Head, full of Majesty; saying, Behold me as thy Mother, and know thou art to enter into Covenant, to obey the New Creation-Laws, that shall be revealed unto thee. Then did she hold out a Golden Book with three Seals upon it, saying, Herein lieth hidden the deep Wonders of <hi>Jehovah's</hi> Wisdom, which hath been sealed up, that none could, or ever shall break up, but such as of her Virgin-Offspring shall appear to be; who will her Laws receive, and keep, as they shall spring daily in the
<pb n="20" facs="tcp:29869:54"/>
New Heart and Mind. This Appearance, and Words, was wonderfully sweet and refreshing in my Soul; at which I bow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, and prostrated at her Feet; pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mising to be obedient to all her Laws. So the Vision shut up for that time.</p>
               <p>Pondering this in my Heart, with great comfort, that this Day-star had visited me from on high; I returned to <hi>Lon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>don</hi> to my own Habitation, retiring my self from all my Acquaintance, saving one Person that was highly Illuminated, who encouraged me still to wait upon this Vision; for he was acquainted with somewhat of this kind. So after six days the Vision appear'd again, with a Train of Virgin-Spirits, and with an Angelical Host; and called to me to come and see the Virgin Queen, with her first-born Children; asking me, Whether I was willing to be joyned amongst this Virgin Company? At which I reply'd, All willing to offer up my self most free: Then immediately I was encompass'd about with this Heavenly Host, and made a Spirit of Light. Then these Words from the Virgin proceeded, say<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, I shall now cease to appear in a Visible Figure unto thee, but I will not
<pb n="21" facs="tcp:29869:54"/>
fail to transsigure my self in thy mind; and there open the Spring of Wisdom and Understanding, that so thou mayst come to know the only True God, in and by the formation of Christ, the anointed Prophet in thee; that shall re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veal great and wonderful things unto thee, that are to be made known, and publick, in its time and day: Therefore be watchful, and to thy Mother Wis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom's Counsel give good heed, and thou shalt greatly prosper, and succeed the Prophets and Apostles to perfect what was left behind, for compleating as to Christ the Fulness of God's great Mystery: So go on, and nothing fear, or doubt; for I thy Glass for Divine See<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing shall evermore stand before thee. Then my Spirit replyed, According to thy Word let all this be fulfilled. And so this Glory withdrew; but an inward Glory did my Heart sill, for a burning Love to all of those Heavenly Beings did kindle within my Heart vehement<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly.</p>

Prayer to Prayer, and from Faith to Faith; so that in good earnest I began to consider I had not found this won<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derful Key, for want of which I might run out in wast all my days, and grope as in the dark, yet never find the Door which opens into my true Shepherd's Fold. Whereupon being cast into a deep astonishing silence and stillness, the Word of <hi>Wisdom</hi> thus opened it self unto me; Oh thou deep searching Spirit, marvel not thou hast been so long frustrated, for as to thy present state and dispensation, thou couldst never reach me to all Eter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity, for my Birth in thee lies deeper then thy present Gift of Faith and Pray<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er can open; thou hast with many others been in a great mistake. But in as much as thou <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">
                     <desc>•…</desc>
                  </gap>wnest and bewailest thy unskilfulness, I will make known to thee what Key will turn this great Wheel of my Wisdom, so as it may move, and manifest it self in thee, through all thy Properties, if thou canst bid up to the Price of it. For understand that it is compounded of all pure Gold, subsisting in a burning Furnace of many Fires: And although this wonderful Key is of Wisdom's carving out, and her free gift,
<pb n="24" facs="tcp:29869:56"/>
yet, Oh thou seeking Spirit, she will cost thee very dear, if ever thou obtainest her. Yet she goeth about seeking such as are worthy of her, and will shew her self within the Walls of the Mind, and meet them in every thought that waits for her Laws and Counsel, and brings a Kingdom which will be well worth thy selling all for. But the great thing, saith Wisdom, now is to discipline and make thy Spirit a cunning Artist, to give it Knowledge of what Matter in Num<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber, Weight and Measure this pure Key is made up of, which is all pure Deity in the Number THREE; which is weigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty indeed, being one exceeding weight Glory, sitting in the Circle of the Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vens within Man's Heart, measuring with the Line of his Power, the Temple and inward Court, with the Worship<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pers therein. This is VVisdom's Key, which will make our Hands drop with sweet smelling Myrrh upon the Handle of her Lock. Which while I was open<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing her Privy-Door, with this Key, my Soul failed within me, and I retained no strength, my Sun of Reason, and the Moon of my outward Sense were folded up, and withdrew. I knew nothing by
<pb n="25" facs="tcp:29869:56"/>
my self, as to those working Proper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties from Nature, and Creature, and the Wheel of the Motion standing still, ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther moved from a Central Fire; so that I felt my self Transmuted into one pure Flame. Then came that Word to me, This is no other then the Gate of my Eternal Deep, canst thou subsist in this Fiery Region, which is <hi>Wisdom's</hi> Man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sion, where she meets with holy ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stracted Spirits, and gives forth a fiery Law, which if thereunto thou canst give heed, so as to come up to her Requi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rings, then no Secret shall be with-held from thee. Thus far am I admitted to, come into the entrance of her House, where I must stop till I hear further from her.</p>
               <p>Now as I was attending to obtain a fresh Visit, being entred into this first Mansion of her House, to hear and learn further, she said on this wise, That I was greatly beloved, and she would be my Mother, and so should I own her and call her, who would now be to me as <hi>Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>becca</hi> was to <hi>Jacob,</hi> to contrive and put me in a way how I should obtain the Birth-right-Blessing. For if I would ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ply my self to her Doctrine, and draw
<pb n="26" facs="tcp:29869:57"/>
my Life's Food from no other Breast, I should then know the recovery of a lost Kingdom; At which Salutation I was dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>solved and melted, the fervent heat of this Love strongly impulsing me to a re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>solve, for to obey her in all things.</p>
               <p>VVhich pure Oil from <hi>Wisdom's</hi> Vessel stopping, it opened again not till <hi>Octo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber</hi> the 20th. in the Morning-Watch; then heard I her Voice thus; Sequester and draw out of thy Animal Sensitive Life, that is too gross: I cannot appear till that disappear. There must be Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit with Spirit, Light with Light. No sooner had I this caution, but I felt Power which suspended the active busie mind, which for a time was expired in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to silence: Know then (said the same Voice) thou shalt supplant thy Brother <hi>Esau,</hi> who according to the Figure, is a cunning Hunter in the out-birth and field of Nature. While he with his sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tilty seeking it abroad, in the wild Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perties of the External Region; I will now help thee to it <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">

my late known Mother, I was deadly ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vished in the Spirit, in the Light of the Lord, and feared to return to the dark House of my outward Senses again; which opened a Spring of Intercession in me, that as one of the Friends of the Bridegroom, I might hear his Voice still, which indeed was so pleasant and sw<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">

savoury Meat, which was in the fiery Essence of my Spirit. Which in very deed I did feel going to work in her own kindled Furnace, where she shewed me her Golden Pot. No Vessel was to be used but of that pure Metal, wherein was ordered all the several Ingredients, which I implored her Friendship to let me see; which was granted unto me, who owned that her Fear was with me, and hitherto I had observed her Charge, and her Secrets should be with me, and that I should know such things from a deep Ground, as had not been broken up of late Ages: if I could bear that hot fiery Furnace, which should boil away the Scum of all that which of the earthly part had yet its remainder with me.

               <p>Disponding therefore, I said, Oh my Mother-Wisdom, the terms of thy Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quirings are hard, considering I con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>strained am to reside in the Out-Birth of a Mortal Shadow, where Millions of Spirits do me tempt to keep me from this high and noble Ascent.

By which I well know what that Word of Record means, <hi>The Day comes that shall burn as an Oven.</hi> She told me, She was now come to make ready the Venison, that I might have access to God my Father with it, while I was pondering, seeing only the Vessel and the Fire, with <hi>Isaac</hi> I was ready to say, Where is the Lamb?

Out of which Heart sprout<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed forth a Tree, with Twelve Branches, having upon the Root of it engraven, GOD is the Pith, Life and Virtue, that maketh the Heart thus Fruitful, in vari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous opening and quickning Powers, gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving forth according to each Branch, a different and peculiar Fruit. Then said she to me, Here doth lie the Mystery: do thou it come and see, how out of the Flames these Branches put forth green and palpable Fruits, that are not yet grown, yet thou with Patience must still wait till to perfection of ripeness they be grown in thee, then of the first Fruits of this Tree thou shalt bring to thy God as an Offering, who will accept it as a pure Offering, that will draw down the Life's Blessing; read and see what engraven is for thee, and let thy Mind be staid a while, till thou to this ripe Age shall arrive and comforted be, that this shady Heart as a fruitful Vine shall overspread within the Walls of thy Mind, a River of Oyl shall here out<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>spring, which will make thy Flames burn still, till so hot the Furnace may come to be which as the Sun for vehe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mency shall transmute this Fruit to a

Golden Colour. Then thou with savoury Meat to thy God shall come, who will himsef feed upon their pleasant Fruit, which nourished has been from the Life's Blood; Come now and into Love's deep descend with me, that thou mayst know the various operation of this Tree, and every Branch thereof, namely as the li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving sense shall spring in thee according to which thy lot will be, as relating to the Blessing promised, the which will re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quire perseverance still in the Faith, till to perfection in Colour this Fruit be brought. No other charge I shall leave with thee, but to abide within this sha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy Rock, where Love's Flames shall be thy Food continually. Oh how plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sant is it here to be, all encircled with Love's flaming Breast?</p>

I was under the dominion of the Starry Region, in the strife of the four Elements, which brought in the Curse, where Care and Fear, and the toil and labour of the Body did consist.

               <p>THere was presented to me a Person, Angling upon the Brink of a Ri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver, to catch Fish; but his Labour was fruitless. So that he gave off, being hopeless. Then came another Person, and said, Be not Discouraged, but fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low me: Behold, and see, I have got an Angle that hath such a Bait; as all the Fish in the River will fall upon it. And accordingly I beheld multitudes in a cluster brought up by it. Then cryed out that first Person, Surely the Lord, who is the great Fish-taker, in verity is come here, and hath wrought this Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>racle indeed. Whereupon the Person went into the Deep, and having vanished down into it, drew up the Fish: and cryed, If ye will here follow me, ye shall the Principal Fish take; but under Water ye must learn to Dive, and again know how to Rise. Consider, and sind
<pb n="50" facs="tcp:29869:70"/>
out this Parable: for here is Meat for the Strong.</p>

               </head>
               <p>IT was now given me to understand, what this did drive at. The first Angler that went, representeth the For<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward and Willing Mind, that a Fishing would go to draw up out of the Broad River; wherein the Everlasting God is to be understood, who is said to be the <hi>Place of Broad Rivers;</hi> in which holy Spirits, as in their proper Element do live, and swim. Flesh cannot live in Water, but Fish is of another kind: which na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture the Holy Ghost doth present, as a Similitude for the New Creation, that will live and move much in the Watery Element, which is a Degree much be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>yond the Earth, though under Purga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions by Fire. Neither is Fish so gross or corruptible: but they are still under a Washing Stream, and therefore not
<pb n="51" facs="tcp:29869:70"/>
used for Sacrifices in the Old Law. Whereas all that is of Flesh is by that or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dained for Burnt-Offerings, that it may pass through the Purgation in the Flames of the Altar. Now what the Sea and Rivers of this kind do feed and generate, must signifie a Generation of Creatures, that is nothing so course and bruitish as are the Earthly Beasts.</p>
               <p>But from this it was shewn me, that this River figureth out God himself, and the pure Angelical Spirits, that move in God as in the Glassy Sea: wherein con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tained are the vast Riches that none in Flesh can see, nor fathom; till they changed be into such a Body as in God their Watery Element to live, and there to swim, and dive for the unutterable precious Stones, to bring them up, ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording as need doth require. It is not the Angling upon the Outside of the River, but the Adventuring into it will obtain the desired Prize. And consider what Bait is to be the attracting Matter, to draw both Spirits and Substances of this unto us. Now then it may needful<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly be inquired into, what this Bait com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pounded of is, for drawing Angelical Spirits, that will also soon draw us after
<pb n="52" facs="tcp:29869:71"/>
them? It was thus hereupon delivered to me, that it must be the Composition which consisteth of all those excellent Virtues, and Properties, that were and are in the Spirit and Nature of JESUS. For no other can attract and take in God, but what is so much like to God; who must be Signatured upon us. For else it will be as fruitless as when the Disoiples went a Fishing: till the Lord the true Angler come, no Draught could be fetched up. Even so this is to Instruct us, that we examin, whether or no we upon this High and Worthy Undertaking, do carry our full and compleat Bait with us, which is the precious smelling Spikenard of an humble, meek, and clarified Mind, that expresly answereth to the very Mind of JESUS. Then doubt we not, that we shall fail, of drawing to us Spirits sublime, that live in that pure Climate, where we shall with them most willingly back plung in, and in a pure Body swim always under the Stream of these Waterings. Jesus the Lord our Bait and Angle will be: Then in what Riches shall we excell? Oh this all<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>worthy is of our Consideration, in the Element of this Water of Life how to
<pb n="53" facs="tcp:29869:71"/>
live, and appear for a while as Drowned and Dead; till that we shall arise and swim with the rich Pearl in our Mouths. Then will it be cryed, This the Christ indeed, that hath the great Draught brought up, through sinking down into Faith's Obedience. Who now venture will to walk upon these Living Waters, wherein the Healing Medicine is, but such Hero's in the Faith, as will not a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fraid be, to dive into the Bottom of this River deep? For otherwise the Rich Prize, which is in the Fishes Mouth, can never be caught up. The Wise in Heart, who by the pure Spirit have been taught, will what is by the Parable meant well understand.</p>

               <head>November <hi>the 7th.</hi> The Magical Journey.</head>
               <p n="1">§. 1. IN my Spiritual Journey on, to the Land of all Blessed Stores, a Figure hereof was acted Magically be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore me, I being carried to a Gate, which was so narrow and strait, that there was
<pb n="54" facs="tcp:29869:72"/>
no getting through, but by creeping up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on the Knees, and that with great. Dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficulty too. And so led on was I still, till at length I came to another Gate, which was somewhat more easily to get through then the First; but strait e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nough. So passing on yet further, there was a two Leaved Gate: but the One Leaf opening was fitted exactly to my Stature in Heighth and Breadth, which gave entrance into a Place, where nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther Beginning nor End was to be found. And I said, what make I here alone? And the Invisible Guide that led me through these three Gates, answered, that There would be some others that would come after me, when they did hear where such a vast Plantation was, which was to be replenished with all sorts and kinds of good things: and yet no Toil, Labour, or Care required is. But know that it is appointed only for Wisdom's high Magicians to Act here their Powers, that had passed through all her strait Gates.</p>
               <p n="2">§. 2. This Presentation, and the Ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vice attending it, was very powerful; which still I called over, and searching
<pb n="55" facs="tcp:29869:72"/>
deeper, to have the Exposition of the Gates given unto me, by and from the dropping Unction. For though my Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit saw nothing but an Infinite Space: yet such a Perfuming Gale I felt, as if all manner of Flowers were growing. But this Word came also to me, saying, Here is the Place for Love's Kingdom to grow, with its Natural Inhabitants, that have left behind the gross selfish Love. That must not come here; for that it is that makes the Passage so strait.</p>
               <p n="3">§. 3. For as much as none can come in, till they be unstripped and uncloathed of the low sensual Nature. For in this place all that counted worthy shall be, to come in here with thee, must put on Transfiguration, and act in the Super<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>celestial Philosophy, as holy Magus's that skilful are to work in the Furnace, that maintained is from the One Burn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing Element; which giveth the High Superelementary Matter, the Composi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion whereof maketh up the Store of all Acting Wonders. Here then on a sudden did I in my Spirit view, several Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sons so Divinely Modified in their
<pb n="56" facs="tcp:29869:73"/>
Bodies, that in this Mystery highly, Learned were, that would sound forth such a Spirit from themselves, that might give an Existency and Being to what<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever they pleased to will; sometimes raising up Golden Tents to go in and out, and at other times making some places which seemed all empty and bare, to spring up with wonderful Plants, that perfectly did yield their Fruit, appear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing in a Golden lustre of Brightness; that was said to be Magical Food for the Inhabitants hereof to live upon. In other Places they without digging or moiling, did bring up Mines of all pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cious Stones and Golden Oar; which was at the command and service of these Princely Spirits, that did walk up and down here. And whereas I thought at my first entrance here, that I saw nothing, after a few Moments of time had passed, thus replenished I did see this place with Spirits of such an high Degree, that did attract me immediately to them. Then did they put several Philosophical Que<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stions to me, which I did not compre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hend. Upon which one among the res<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">
                     <desc>•…</desc>
                  </gap> most Courteously did offer himself to instruct and teach me: moreover say<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
<pb n="57" facs="tcp:29869:73"/>
to me, He would open to me the Mystery of their Art. For he said he found there was that Signature in me, that would take Impression, from the Supercelestial Planets. So he placed me in a goodly Tent, bidding me wait to go forth in the Pure Acts of Faith, forth, for therein I might come an A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deptist to be in this High Philosophy.</p>
               <p>Here being a Considerable Defect in the O<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riginal, the Author waited in her Spirit to recal the same, and upon the 22d. of <hi>March,</hi> in this Year 1696. she received this further Opening, às also in the fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowing Days, here confirmed.</p>
               <p n="4">§. 4. Wisdom appearing to me, I inquired of her who these were; who told me, they were the Antient and Late Wortheis taught by Her, in her Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vine Magical Stone, both in the Inward and in the Outward: and that the Time was now approaching, wherein she was to make New Artists in this Theosophical Wisdom, that should put a New Face upon what hath been Dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>figured, and under a Cloud of Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tempt,
<pb n="58" facs="tcp:29869:74"/>
Ignorance, and Ignominy. For no other way then this could be found, but as this Deep Mine, wherein this Treasure hath so long lain hidden, should be broken up. Then the Apostle <hi>John</hi> to whom this Mystery was well known, and who was the Person that had before spoken to me, spake thus to me, saying, As there is a Natural Stone, so there is a Spiritual Stone, which is the Root and Ground of what is brought forth visibly by the Sons of Art. And as the Outward is Bodily, and consists in a Manual Operation, and takes up a considerable Time <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">
                     <desc>•…</desc>
                  </gap>or its Perfecting; so is the <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">
                     <desc>•…</desc>
                  </gap>nward gradually wrought out, and may require as many Years as the other doth Months, before it reach to its Consummation. Then I enquired of the Angel <hi>John,</hi> How I should go about Working it? He answered me, There must be a Cessation of all Working, as to the Powers of Nature: And I will describe to thee the Method that is to be taken, by the Similitude of the Out<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward. As there is a Furnace to be Built in that, so the Corporeal Man answers to that, wherein the Fire-Seed of the pure Deity doth enkindle it self from
<pb n="59" facs="tcp:29869:74"/>
the Essence of the Soul, sinding a sancti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fied Vessel meetly prepared herefor. Now as to the Matter which is to be wrought upon, it is the Divine Salt, put into a pure clear Crystalline Glass, that is pure Spirit. Furthermore, know thou that this Salt is hidden in all Men, but it hath lost its savour, and is the Light Principle that contains all Principles, Man being an Epitome of all Worlds, though unknown to himself. Whence he may find in himself whatever he searcheth for: but this cannot be done, until the Salt-Stone, which hath lain as Dead, cometh to be Quickned by Christ the Fire-Stone, that calcines the Black<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness into a Jasper Brightness and White<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness. This is the true Theosophical Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dicine that doth gradually work from it self, of it self, and to it self, as a Grain of Wheat is sown, and by the Concurrence of the Sun and outward Planets, forms its self into a Body. It is only to be watched that no Ravenous Birds do come to pick it up, before it arrive to its Maturity. For thus it is with the Golden Stone, which lies hid in the Ground of Nature, which is nourished by the warm fiery Influences of the Divine Sun, and wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tered
<pb n="60" facs="tcp:29869:75"/>
by the moist Sperm of the Spiri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tual <hi>Luna,</hi> which causeth it to vege<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tate, by the Coagulation of the Plane<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tary Powers of the higher Order, drink<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing and swallowing up the weaker and lower, by which Dominion is obtained over all what is Astral and Elementary. Thus the Beloved <hi>John</hi> did open the Nature of this Royal Stone, as it open<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed in him in the <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">
                     <desc>•…</desc>
                  </gap>sle of <hi>Patmos,</hi> when he was said to be <hi>in the Spirit.</hi> And he told me further, That where the Uni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>versal Love was born in any one, it was the true signature, that this Sera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phick Stone would have its Formation.</p>
               <p n="5">§. 5. With Great freedom I was made to enquire, well knowing this Celestial Stone had already its Birth and Vegeta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion in me, whether my Outward Furnace might not break before it was finished? Then replied this dear Saint, Be not so<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>licitous, or concerned about that; but be patient in hope, for the True Phi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>losophers Tree is sprung, and is in a fair way ripe Fruit to produce: Thou hast no other Burthen put upon thee, but to set under it and to watch until the Golden Apples do of themselves drop. Then
<pb n="61" facs="tcp:29869:75"/>
mayest thou know the Multiplying Ver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tue, and as <hi>Eve</hi> did give of the Forbid<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>den Tree to <hi>Adam,</hi> so possibly mayst thou, by a new created Virginity of Spirit, give forth to Wisdom's Offspring plenteously hereof, by which Multipli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cation from this Virtual Tree shall in thee both Spirit, Soul and Body renew. It will be a Dispensable Gift, so that such as have arrived to an high Progress in it, may awaken and multiply the same in another.</p>
               <p n="6">§. 6. Then was it further directed as to the Matter of this Stone, that the Composition thereof was the Four-Ele<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mentary Matter, which is to be sublimed and calcined by the Superiour Element, in the Tenth Number of Perfection; and seperated and sealed up in the Glass of the sanctified Mind; that so the Su<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pernatural Motions according to Eter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal Nature may work out Purity, and Leaven that which is gross. So that there is no need of any thing more to be done but to watch the Fire, that it may never go out, until it be finished, and be kept in a gentle nourishing Heat, till it come to its Perfection.</p>
               <p n="7">
                  <pb n="62" facs="tcp:29869:76"/>
§. 7. After this was described to me, it was said to me by Wisdom, and by the Apostle <hi>John,</hi> Thou shalt now be brought to the Antient Worthies that have made Projection upon this <hi>Stone,</hi> as well understanding it both as to the Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritual and Natural Part of it. And when I was brought there, I saw the Patriarchs and all the great Philosophers divinely taught, both of former and latter Ages. Then was I led into a Darkness, which by a Magical Power, these changed into a bright Silver Light. Afterward I was brought into a barren dry Ground, and these by the speaking forth only of a Word, as, Let this Soil be changed in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to a Fruitful <hi>Lebanon,</hi> brought up all the variety of pleasant Flowers and Plants, that sent out a mighty hot Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fume. Then I was led on still to a Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neral Ground, where were all the baser Metals. And the Apostle <hi>John,</hi> who was the chief Magician, said, Come and see, what is here to be done also. And he had in his Hand a little Vial, contain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing a Liquor like to Gold, and he drop<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ped some Drops of this upon each Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tal; and they were all immediately
<pb n="63" facs="tcp:29869:76"/>
transmuted into Lustrous Gold. Then I was led to another Place, where there was nothing but a Redish Mould cast up: and then by the Word of the Power, which he spake forth, this Earth was changed into Forms after our Human shape, but clarified and bright, standing up as a great Army. And he said, These are the Fire-Stones, that are to walk in this New Paradisical Region, as Glorified Figures, like unto such as were here before them. Then I Que<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ried how could it possibly be, that such Effects could be produced by any that in a Mortal Image did now upon the Earth appear. Upon which the Beloved <hi>John</hi> answered me, All this that thou hast seen, is possible again to be done, by Wisdom's White Tincturing Stone formed within; by which the Great Wonders in the last concluding Age of the World, shall the grand Revolution make; changing what is gross and vile first within, and then going further on to Transfigure even that which is with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out; that so according to that saying, <hi>The Vile Body shall be changed, and redu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ced, and brought into the Glorious Li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>berty,</hi> whereby it may possess the King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom
<pb n="64" facs="tcp:29869:77"/>
and Dominion, with Christ the Glorified Head. Then was it said, This is the true and faithful Mystery, that understood and unveiled hath been to thee; for a Foundation of Faith and Hope to Wisdom's Children to look into: and to wait for the Formation in themselves of this White Virgin Stone. Then may they most freely and easily eat and work; and nothing shall them con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>troll, as to those worthy Enterprizes, and Exploits, that are to be wrought, which shall distinguish them to be the Sealed of the Living God signed with Power from on High.</p>

Sounds: and then after that, obtaining the Power to be in a stillness, where neither Motion or Thought did stir, I was in a smooth calm Water, wherein no Dirt or Mire did cast up, neither was there the lifting up of any Tool, or ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king any noise to drown the Voice, that spake to me in this wise.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>The Voice of the Bridegroom.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>O thou afflicted, tossed and forsaken One, I will marry thee unto my self. Thou art mine: be not dismayed. Fear none of those things thou art to suffer; for the Power and Presence of my Om<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nipotency shall be with thee. Thou must be my tried Stone, at which many shall fall and stumble; thou hast been refused, and set at naught, but I will magnifie my Name in thee, and yet make it Honourable. Only this I require, that thou seperate thy self, and touch no more unclean Spirits of this World, for I can endure no Polluted thing to come before me. Therefore holy, harmless, seperated from Sin and Sinners thou must be: then in the holy Priesthood thou shalt wait on me.</p>

                  <hi>The Answer of the Spirit of the Soul.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>At which I said; Lord, how can this be? For though I have greatly desired this Office to minister about the holy Things, that so I might be nigh to thee; yet the Worldly Spirit maketh a Chal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lenge to this outward Husk or Body, and saith, that I am not got out of the reach of its Dominion. Hunger and Thirst, Heat and Cold do attend the outward Man, which do engage its outward Senses, for things which are External; so that none can live in that pure Ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>straction, till redeemed out of all Care for the present Body. This was that which I bewailed, and did plainly ask God if it were not possible for the Eter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal Mind and Spirit, to supply all Wants to that which were Corporeal, without the help of the Spirit of Reason, which is King in that Region where the Curse is.</p>

                  <hi>The Reply of the Bridegroom.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>After a little while of suspending my outward Senses, this Answer I obtained, That this could not be, till there were
<pb n="69" facs="tcp:29869:79"/>
a Total Death of the Body of Sin; re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferring to that in the seventh of the <hi>Ro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mans,</hi> ver. 6. That being Dead wherein we were held fast, we should serve in the Newness of Spirit; as being discharged from the Law of the first Husband, to which we were married, after the Law of a Carnal Command: Whence we are now free to be Married unto him that is raised from the Dead, and so shall be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come the Lamb's Wife, jointured into all the Lands and Possessions that he hath. The Eternal Revenues are be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>longing to her, whether Invisible or Visible: all Power in Heaven and Earth is committed to her, and all things are given to those that are his: whether it be Gifts of Prophecy, or of Revelation, or of Manifestation, or of Discerning of Spirits: or that high Tongue of the Learned, which only speaks from Wis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom's Breath.</p>

                  <hi>The Preparation of the Second Marriage.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>At which Opening, my Spirit even failed within me, as desponding ever to get rid of my First Husband; without which no Marriage with the Lord from Heaven can be. For knowest thou not,
<pb n="70" facs="tcp:29869:80"/>
(was it said to me) that the Law of Sin hath Dominion, so long as he li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veth? So from hence the Spirit did testifie that nothing less then a Tho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rough Death would put me into a Capacity of this Marriage with the Lamb. For he will match himself only to a Virgin Spirit, incorporating, and thereby changing into his own pure Hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manity: and this is a Begetting into a Living Substance, which springeth through the Death of the Old. Which as the Grain that dissolveth in the Earth, and generateth a New Body: so in like manner doth the New Creature, spring forth; which indeed is Christ, our Life, whose appearance will put an end to Sin in us. Now what brought in the Curse, the Care, the Toil, and the Im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>potentcies which distress poor Man in this his fallen estate, but a Deviation from his God? And while in this state, he stands as a Debtor to Sin, being un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der the Dominion of it, this maketh him obnoxious to all the Calamities which do attend those that live in Bodies Ele<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mentary. But now to hear of a Possibi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lity of a Putting off of this Body of Sin, this is good Tidings indeed: and verily
<pb n="71" facs="tcp:29869:80"/>
the Prophet which is risen in me, hath prophesied that such a Day is at hand. And that I shall be a Witness of <hi>Jacob's</hi> Star arising, and shall see for my self, and not for another. Then shall that saying be fulfilled, <hi>Death is swallowed up in Victory;</hi> even the Death of that First Husband, who so long hindred my Marriage with the Lamb. Who by a New Law from <hi>Mount Sion</hi> hath set me free, from the Law of Sin and Death. Be astonished, O ye who are Wounders and Despisers of this Grace; which I now see is near to be Revealed. For the Garments of the Bride are making ready: and it is gran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted to me to see, in whose hand they be.</p>
               <p>O Wisdom, to thee is committed only the Ordering of this Wedding Garment, which of divers Colours shall be, that known from all others may be the King's Daughter, who under thy Teaching and Discipline is committed.</p>

               <p>OH my Mother, how is it that thou hast shewed me of the Glory of thy House, and of the Honour, Riches and Dominion of thy Kingdom, and hereby hath allured and drawn the Spirit of my Mind, that I cannot turn my Eye from thee, my Senses being refined, and with thy Life close touched, that I altogether in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>capable am to join to <hi>Baal,</hi> or to immerse my self with the druggy polluted Life of this outward Principle, which hath no consistency with that transparent state where unto thou hast called me, with thee to have my Conversation, as one that hath obtained Grace, to be sirnamed by thee, and admitted into the secret of thy Counsel, in order to some peculiar Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vice for thee. If so, why is it I am yet straitned in force and power? What sig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal mark do I bear to demonstrate my holy and consecrated Calling to wait in
<pb n="73" facs="tcp:29869:81"/>
thy Pavilion? What Commission have I from thee to shew, whereby all unbe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieving and gain-saying Spirits may be convinced and put to silence? true it is I have had free Communications through Transportation of my Spirit: but what is this without fixation, and Seal of the Power which may bear Record of its own Omnipotency, working forth to redress all Maladies and Grievances? see<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing I have taken upon me to plead, suffer me yet a little to empty and unload my self to thee, whom I well know to have the tender working Bowels of a Mother, and numbrest all my Complaints; the first Argument is from thy free choice of me, calling me out of all Nations, Tongues and Peoples, no more to know my Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>the'rs House or the Land of my Earthly Nativity, but to renounce and seperate from all, attending thy Appointments only, at whose Knee I have been for some time brought up; to hear and learn the manner of the worship of my God, which is expected in a different Living, All-Powerful Ministration, which to know is indeed Life; but to act forth from that Life, brings the Joy, Peace and Glory, which will be the Renown of
<pb n="74" facs="tcp:29869:82"/>
Wisdom's Nursery, among whom I have thus far found favour, as to have her Friendly Salutations, with Word upon Word, sealing Instructions to me: but this is not enough. Oh the Spirit and Breath that goeth forth with all In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fluencing Powers, to create new Forms of things: this I know will give the express signature of a Godlikeness putting forth through Nature's contemtible Appea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rance: Here is surely a matchless Glory to break forth, the highest Mystery, which was ever unveiled, the best and choicest of all Wisdom's Treasury, yet to be brought out for such as pursue, and make it their only one Interest, minding and regarding nothing else. Oh my Mother, while herein have I busied my self in putting and throwing off all Weights, that I might come a naked Spirit unto thee: How have the perni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tious Necessities cryed for the out-part to have Right done it, to act, and work, and plot in Reasons Counsel-House, as the manner is of all which live in the gross Animal Body; is known to thy all-viewing Eye, which runneth to and fro: and what my Conflicts have been, and still are, while I have studied to

evade and make my escape through the Throng of Worldly-Wise Reasons Guard, who have by order of their great Prince, watched me in every going out and in: when with my only Friend I would my Time secretly in all sweetness spend, contrivance hath not been wanting to draw me down, to wear again the dark Linsywolsey-Gown. I being well aware through divine caution: These are the Pirats that have lain in wait for me, to take what Substance is with me embarked. So that Perils on all kinds do beset, but this my Ark above all Waters doth keep floating, (a Man of War is within) which will keep this Vessel from being a Prize to the subtil Man of Sin, pitched within and without by Wisdom's Skill: no fear of leaking while I thy bottom am, so saith the <hi>Amen.</hi> Thus encoun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tring fresh with Temptations and strong Gusts from the cold North, which I feel many times blow so sharp, as if they would put back the Spring from coming on; upon which only my Hope is enter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tained, which keeps up my Spirit from fainting. Thus while I was pleading and pressing hard for the finishing Pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er to come down, that might put an end

to all Strife, whioh is from the Root of Sin. <hi>[Here is a Break, by the loss of the Original.]</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Therefore, O <hi>Shulamite,</hi> do not thou judge thy Furnace to be too hot: it well becomes thee the same with thy Lord in all things to be, who in thee beareth, and endureth, and suffereth. Were it not that hadst high Conjunction with the Deity, thou wouldst not stand in that Enmity universally, to what from the Root of Iniquity doth spring. How much better is it to be numbred with thy Jesus amongst the Transgressors, and to bear the Sins of others, rather then thy own, that the Evil One may chal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lenge no part in thee. How will the Bridegroom rejoyce to see his Bride as a spotless Lily, growing under the sturdy Tree of Life, who therefrom will pluck and present herewith the most lovely Fruits that this new revived <hi>Eden-</hi>Garden do afford; here is private Walks, sweet pleasant Groves, where the Lamb with his Virgin Bride may fully solace, and none do them espy; Spirit with Spirit can walk and talk very hiddenly, linked and wrapped up in the Mystery of the Trinity in Unity, from out of whose

Arms none shall ever more pluck out. Oh thou deep Well of Love which thus freely flows, no need of drawing when thy Springs unlock: while thou art com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>muning, what Perfumes doth thy Breath send forth? as a Cluster of all rich Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pounds is thy breaking up: Turn away thine Eye, for thou hast overcome me with the Sparkling Flames thereof. How shall I be able to hold a Conference with thee, except by renewing strength and transfiguring Glory, I be admitted into thy fiery Charriot all paved with Loves, there with thee my Bride to set, and evermore to fix: for greater Bliss then this I cannot desire to possess, who my dear <hi>Sophiae</hi> art.</p>

For such as the fallen Man is,

so is his place among Dragons, and un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clean devouring Beasts and Birds of Prey; out from which I have seperated and called thee to dwell on the Face of that pure Ground, as an anointed Che<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rub, to keep all in order in this Holy Place, suffer thou no strange Plant here to put forth; neither lust thou any more to tast of that one Tree which so pleasant appeareth to the dark Eye. Though a new generated Spirit thou art, yet not excluded from the Serpent's tempting dart, no more then he who was the first Begotten, who thy Pattern still is to be. Consider him in his Forty Days temptation, before whom this Tree was set, presenting all Kinds and Sorts of tempting Fruits, but of none he would either tast or touch: who thereby gave proof he was an impreg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nable Rock, fitly qualified the Father's high Trusty of all his Treasures to be made: the same Yesterday, and to Day, he is, alive for evermore, in the weak and frail Form of a Human Body, to perfect the same Conquest for thee, that so compleat through Sufferings thou in him mayst shine Celestially; therefore fear not to go through the dark Valley,

<pb n="84" facs="tcp:29869:87"/>
further about these weighty and Heavenly Matters, which, with great pressing Urgency, received this resolve as relating to those things manifold, which by the Mouth of Wisdom have been foretold. Who again encouraged me to hope and wait, for the Day was not far off, in which I might see the All-filling Body of the Glory, which would be the end of former and latter Prophecy, whereunto I yet did well to take heed, because it was the Life's Food, which for the present time might not only afford Support to me, but others who with me shall wing up their Lord to meet, all Crystalline, having no Spot nor Stain: to such he will ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pear and number them among the Holy Train, to bear the Father's Name, inspiring and shewing to me there was various Passages, which yet I was fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther to venture and believe the entrance into, which should yet be more amazing to the intellectual Mind, which shall in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to its own Deep descend, to bring up still what will Water the Garden, that it may be always Summer and Spring. Where I earnestly invocated this might also be the Portion of my selected Friends, who
<pb n="85" facs="tcp:29869:87"/>
in this Holy Ministry were choosing to wait with me, that they might clear, single, and of a perfect Spirit appear be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore the bright All-piercing Eye of the Virgin Wisdom, who to our God maketh nigh. Further I did see into the My<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stery of ascending Spirits what Quali<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fications thereto was required, who are to be Spiritual Flames blown upon by a constant soft breath of Air from the Holy Power, which letteth in nothing which putrifies or is gross and heavy, none could mount up that had the least Weight hanging upon them: the Word did express there must be a due Propor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, Light and Purity answering to each other; the Mind that would asso<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciate with God, must carry a distance to drossy carnal Spirits, and all of that Nature, according to the high Birth of a Spirit: you shall know it by the Holy Greatness which it will have, not knowing how to be familiar with what is not of the same high extraction with it self. Wisdom is very Jealous least any of her Family should walk out of her Order; therefore that in her Love-Favour you may all abide, to whom this Word of Counsel shall come, that
<pb n="86" facs="tcp:29869:88"/>
to the Virgin of the Lamb be you Loyal, that in your ascending Prayers, you may meet with no denyal.</p>

               <p>The Light Orb opened and all over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>spread me, thereby dispelling every Foggy Mist, so that it brought to my remembrance <hi>the Lord's Day,</hi> which <hi>John</hi> saw, and had all his Revelations in; who was said to be <hi>in the Spirit.</hi> And truly after such a manner must e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>very one be seized, that is drawn up into the Mount of Divine Vision, to hear what God the Lord hath of his Mind to give forth. Which will only be en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trusted with such whose Spirits are fled, and departed out of all Animal Sense, which is gross, heavy and ponderous. But for a Spirit that would be All-seeing, and intelligent in matters Supernatural, to be uncloathed of all Earthly Mate<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rials it is certainly required; as, through great and free Love, I have been a Wit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness of, in all Conferences, and mutual Society with the Fountain Sourse of all Spirits. For never could I hear, feel, see,
<pb n="87" facs="tcp:29869:88"/>
or tast the Powers and Joys of the Light Kingdom, till I was passed out of the Cloudy Pillar of mine own benighted Reason: which many times set so hard upon me, as I often feared that I should be violated out of all that which Divine Wisdom had presented to me; for an Encouragement to those who shall by Faith overcome not in part, but in whole, triumphing over all Worlds. Which is to be effected, as hath lately been shewn to me, upon some debate with the World of Wisdom, my dear Counsellour, who taking notice of some fresh Exercise that my Spirit was in, ani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mated me thus: Be strong, be reso<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lute, acquit thy Doubting Mind; for therein lieth the danger: for as much as no mighty Work can be effected either in, by, or through thee, until there be a full, close, and joint Consent of all the internal Faculties, and Powers. Therefore are there all choice Ingredi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ents requisite, for the making up of this Almighty precious Faith: and such as are not to be found in every Ground. For thou art to know that there are different Soils in the Inward Heart of Man's Earth, as well as in the outward: some being
<pb n="88" facs="tcp:29869:89"/>
for one Grain, some for another; and all making together for the Increase of that Treasury, which is to be brought into the Eternal Granary. Wherein every ones Work shall be proved, and all Metals tryed, of what sort they are.</p>
               <p>Now as to this which is the most weighty of all Seeds, and in Truth the Root of all, there being no Fruit but what putteth forth from this <hi>Tree of Faith,</hi> from which the Holy One can tast any Sweetness, (as it is written, <hi>Without Faith there is no possibility of pleasing God)</hi> thou must therefore dive and search deeply: for in the Essence of the Deity this Grain of Gold is only to be found. And if it should not drive forth it self in all its united Force and Powers, it would never be reached to. But in that Ground where this Plant is deeply rooted, it will put forth as from a flowing bubling Fountain: which Water of Life mingleth with the Golden Mould, and so maketh the Composition of this high extracted Mineral; which hath done, and will yet do, all the Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>raculous Things, in and through Nature but it will suffer no check, nor contra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diction
<pb n="89" facs="tcp:29869:89"/>
from Nature. Such is the absolute and uncontrolable Soveraignty hereof, that it will not admit of any Question<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing Spirit to set footing within its Gates. Here must be no Asking, How can This, or That come to be? If <hi>Abraham</hi> had made any of these kind of Objections, he had frustrated all his Friendship with God, who put him surely upon as hard things to prove him, as any in this Age shall ever be called to, or need fear to be tryed withal. Many worthy In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stances more there are upon Record of such, who by this Faith have subdued and conquered whatever withstood them; so as nothing was too hard for them, who skilled were in the use of this bright flaming Shield, which hath for a long time been out of Exercise. For of late Age it hath scarcely been known, after this manner of working, to have been ever used: which is in the way of giving Being and Existency to that which is Not. This is the Quintes<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sence and Spirit of Faith, the immedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ate Begotten of the Father, that acteth according to the Will and Power of the Omnipotency. There is no Sufficiency in any but from this All-sufficiency put<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting
<pb n="90" facs="tcp:29869:90"/>
forth. Which I advise thee to look up to, and wait upon, in the serene Stillness: and when the Birth is strong enough grown, it will shew it self whose Child it is. In the mean time hide and conceal it, and wrap it up in the Mantle of Love and Patience. The Nourish<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment hereof shall be from that Breast of Wisdom's Word, by which it shall still be sustained, till it cometh to be a full grown Power, and of a perfect Age: and then shall the Government upon this Shoulder be laid, and both the Inmost and Utmost Bounds of all that which the Heavens and Earth contain, shall to this Spirit of Faith bow most volunta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rily; as rejoycing to see <hi>Immanuel's</hi> Kingdom arising, as the <hi>Morning Star</hi> out of the East.</p>
               <p>I have now no other Word to give, but that thou hold fast, and keep the Word of God's Patience; enduring all Contradictions, rather then denying or shrinking back from this which will crown thee, and become thy Glorified Body. Be strong then, O my Spirit, flag not: for my <note n="*" place="margin">The Laws of <hi>Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>radise</hi> were here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>upon given down.</note> Law<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>giver out of <hi>Sion</hi> I do see, who upon

               <head>November <hi>the 22d. 1675.</hi> Wisdom's Call and Direction for the Tabernacle Building.</head>
               <p>UPon the <hi>New Covenant</hi> which was opened and established in me, this Word came unto me further; Where is the Place for my Testimony to be put, except in the Ark and Tabernacle where I only give the witness of my Presence? This is the great, high, and most consi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derable Work of all, therefore thou art noted as also them that are moved and stirred up to join with thee as known by Name to go forward in the framing and fashioning of this goodly Tent for the Presence of the Most Holy to take up in. Then cryed the Voice unto me, Put your Hands to this curious Work, according to the Pattern which Wisdom hath given you. At this I said in my
<pb n="92" facs="tcp:29869:91"/>
Spirit, Ah Lord, where is the Stuff and Matter to work upon? Then replyed the Word of Wisdom, Ye shall find all with and in your own Treasure-House, into which the Free-will-Offerings are brought; therefore be not careful as to that: your business is to order and ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nage the Materials provided to your Hands. This put me upon great Impor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tunity for Skill and Understanding: for it was a New Work to us, and we must obtain a special Gift, or we should be non-plus'd in it. Then this Word spake to me, Am not I with thee who devised the first Tabernacle in the Figure and Shadow, and made those two choise Ones wise-hearted, for the effecting of that which was but a Worldly Sanctu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ary? Am not I come to give you a wise and understanding Heart? Why lean you not upon me for this Ability and Sufficiency? Nothing would suffice but Cohabitation with your God, and it could no other way be effected, but by this New and Living Sanctuary by me framed. Therefore as a tender faithful Mother I have not concealed any thing that might throughout accomplish thee for free and mutual Society with thy
<pb n="93" facs="tcp:29869:91"/>
God, and beloved Jesus: Now take good notice of what I shall instruct, and give Rules for, in order to this pure and perfect Tabernacle erecting. Which must be a Transcript from what is in the Superior Heavens, which the Maje<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sty of Glory fills; that the one may come expresly to answer the other: and that so the same which bears Record in Heaven, may also in thy restored and New Earth bear it; where the Everlast<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing JEHOVAH loveth to be, if he may but find a Receptacle suitable for so great, so wonderful, and so infinite a Security. Now then consider to what a choice, eminent, and worthy Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vice thou and thy fellow Workmen are called; labour that my Stone may spring in you, which only can make wise Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tists to comprehend the Nature and Manner of this Work; first then know here is no less then a Creating Power, with which ye must be endued withal, before you can make any thing of this Work: according to that ancient Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phecy which saith, <hi>The Lord will CRE<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ATE upon every dwelling Place a Taber<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nacle for a Shadow by Day, and it shall be a Flaming Fire by Night.</hi> Here is
<pb n="94" facs="tcp:29869:92"/>
the New-Covenant Prediction come to be fulfilled in thy Day, that ye may rejoice in that which I create, and bring forth in the Birth Power of All-Wisdom which so readily can take out the Pat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tern, in which the High and Lofty One doth inhabit. This is not after the man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner of a Terrestial Formation by visible Gold, Silver, Purple, Scarlet, or Linen, which Methaphorically Imaged out the true and real Sanctuary of God's Being, which is to be created in thy Internal Part. There the Holy Ark thou must make by me, who can extract it Magi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cally, casting the Mould from out of that superior and undiscovered Golden Ground, which at my Command, cast<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth up all precious Matter for thee to work upon. Which unconceivable and unknown must be, for no common Eye shall ever this espy: it is the peculiar Gift which only doth appertain to those which are called by Name this Holy Thing to ingrave Wonder-working.</p>
               <p>Hereupon my Spirit was as one over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turned, being appointed to such a Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vice, wherein no Earthly Material, Tool or Instrument was to be used. For all Wisdom and Understanding from the
<pb n="95" facs="tcp:29869:92"/>
Rational Terrestrial Man was prohibited, and to be wholly laid aside, and only the Wisdom which is from above, that indeed is Pure, was to take place and give Instruction in this great Affair; which tended to the settling of the Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venly Promise through the erecting of this Holy Tabernacle. Thus being in a deep plunge and concern in my self, how, and when to set upon the Work, as be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing pressed out of measure, to proceed upon it, praying with all Prayer for my self, and that other Person nominated in this Work, I received this Divine Charge, to persist unweariedly without Interruption. For that if there were a falling back, or but a slacking in either, it might stop the Wheel. Therefore I was forewarned to be well satisfied in the Spirits, that I concurred and united withal, lest that should be mutable and not hold out to the finishing Work: for we should be tryed, and if we were not perfect in One Accord, it could not prosper in our Hand, and then it were better to engage singly; if not clear, and cordial as one. Then was brought before me something of a staggering, which would be very hurtful, if at any
<pb n="96" facs="tcp:29869:93"/>
time it should in either of us prevail, before we obtain the fixation in the Bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy of the Power; for it was shewed me there would not want strong belingrings to weaken our Hands in the Work; for the whole stress lay upon following and cleaving to our Guide, and keeping to the <hi>Paradisical</hi> Laws which in the Mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stration of the Spirit can only be fulfil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led. Now these things sinking deep up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on my Spirit, drew forth many Inquiries and Heart-searchings, and Suspitions, least the Work should in any wise be impeded, for I saw the Dragon upon his violence to snatch at the Birth, which made me cry, O save it out of his Hands, and carry us out of his reach. Then Wisdom spake this Word, No place out of danger, but the Ark and Taber<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nacle, where your Strong Hold is the Sanctuary, which is provided foryour Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fuge. Then did I apply my self to ask how long it should be before we might here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>with be invironed, that so we might no longer be in Fear and Jepordy. It was replyed, That it is much in our Power both to hasten or to prolong it: there was a possibility of a quick Work to be
<pb n="97" facs="tcp:29869:93"/>
made of it, if we would follow it ful<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, intirely, with all Might; for it was of that nice, difficult, curious Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, that every Interruption detarded it; God could make a Tabernacle to descend ready finished upon thee, but it is his pleasure to give thee the Honour of the Workmanship and Building here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of, that thou mayst hear and learn of Wisdom how to form and bring forth this inclosed Tent for the God of <hi>Jacob</hi> to dwell in. Then this Query did rise up further in me. But seeing the manner of this curious Work, O Wisdom, is to be effected by a Spiritual Magician, who by a Vertual Power must do all in it, how can we be capable hereof, till we come to be made such? For who can make themselves so sublime and perfect, as to reach to so high a degree of Wis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom as is required in this Work? Truth it is, O impotent Spirit, without me thou hast no sufficiency: therefore this understand, I do not insist, or require thee to set upon this Matter of so great Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sequence nakedly, in thy own strength; for then soon an abortive thou wouldst make: This doth require as great a Skill and Power as the first Heavens and
<pb n="98" facs="tcp:29869:94"/>
Earth, with all the Hosts that did be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>long unto them, which were generated through the deep Spirit of Wisdom's Understanding. So know I do call up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on this Original Breath infused from my Essential Power and Life, which resleth in the Cell of thy Eternal Mind, till it be awakned by my Voice sounding as a Trumpet; saying, Come forth, and gird on thy Spiritual Powers, and fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low me, where thou shalt see in what Holy Affairs, and Spiritual Work, I will employ thee, knowing the Gift of Ability, which already is given unto thee; which now is required to be stir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red up, to the utmost sufficiency there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of, to join the Chariot of thine Internal Spirit with me, and so be the Wheel within mine, doing only what you see me do; who am risen out of thy deep Central Earth, all things anew to create. Seven Pillars hewn out in the first place here must be, for this Perfect Sanctuary, all Crystalline, out from that Rock which is the Eternal Jasper-Stone. Next is that fine-twined Linnen, which for Curtains about this Tent is ordered to be imbroidered by the Golden Thread, and wrought by the Needle of my
<pb n="99" facs="tcp:29869:94"/>
Eternal Spirit. In the third place, it is to be paved all with Molten Gold from that Everlasting Mountain which thou didst see; the Covering also of the same Orential Gold must be. All which though Metaphorically I do them thus present to thee, yet all shall be accom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plished in a perfect Mystery, as the Deity shall all over-shadow thee, who long hath waited this Tabernacle to see per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fected in thee, that so the Covenant within the Ark might find a place of Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>curity. Here thy God will choose to put his Name only: Where nothing must come near that is defiling. And therefore appointed are over the Thronely Mercy-Seat, flaming Cheru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bims, this Holy Place to guard: Whose cry is only <hi>Holiness to the Lord Most High,</hi> who within this Tent defires with thee to dwell, and with Power, Majesty and Glory it to fill: but know, that here God will admit none into this sepe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rated Court to come, but the High-Priest which hath the Crown of the A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nointing Oil: therefore consider the wonderful Purity, that is required when thou comest near to thy God to inquire, who will from between the Flaming
<pb n="100" facs="tcp:29869:95"/>
Seraphims commune with thee in all Matters and Things in which thou art to receive Commands. For now the real sum of all that which is required in this thy approach, is purity in the highest degree, that can be extracted from that Original Sourse, out from which floweth the Golden Streams of All-Holiness, which will be found within thy self, and in their rising, so cleanse and sanctifie them all over, as therefrom this Holy Taber<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nacle will it self form, and grow upon thee, till it shall have swallowed up all foregoing Tabernacles, as <hi>Aaton's</hi> Rod did devour the rest of the Magicians Powers. So know that God will be and live intirely to himself within thee, as his perfect Tent; enduring no Vessel, or Instru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, or Spirit, to come here, but what hath the Inscription of Perfect Holiness upon it. For who may here ascend but what can dwell in a Flaming Pillar of Fire, and not be consumed? and be able to say, Evermore let me in this sweet, aimable pleasant Fire, O God, with thee abide, till I know nothing within me stirring, but the Ark of thy Strength and the Power of thy Omnipotency, which will be, and is, the finishing Glory of
<pb n="101" facs="tcp:29869:95"/>
thy Sanctuary. Where unutterably and perpetually my Spirit may be folded up as in an unknown Reservatory within this Holy Place of Purity.</p>
               <p>In order to the attainment of which Perfect State, this Word I heard, Ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stain thou from all Meats which are offer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed unto Idols, and feed upon nothing which is Common or Unclean, which is not purged by the Fire that burneth upon my Altar: a true Fast ye are to keep in your Spirits from the gross creeping Things, and flying Fowls of Imaginations that are apt to flutter in the Air of your Minds, and would feed upon that which is hurtful; making ye Infirm and Weak, for this Taber<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nacle-Work. For as ye are called and chosen to the Order of the Holy Priest<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hood, there to attend instantly Day and Night, maintaining the Fire upon the Altar from the pure Spikenard, which is to be made up of all Spices, into a per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fuming Oil, this is thy Service to cast herein Fuel, or Food for this Holy Fire, to Feed upon: then all Offerings passing through this Fire are made acceptable because of the Perfume, and Confecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>onary Art of the Most High and True
<pb n="102" facs="tcp:29869:96"/>
Chymist, that maketh this Eternal Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>position, giving it into thy Hand to maintain the Celestial Fire with: Out from which expect the Cloven Tongue must issue forth, for it is the Spicy Flame, which inspireth with the Holy Ghost; nothing goeth beyond or is like to this Oyl of Composition, for it con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tains all the Soveraign Vertue of the Holy Godhead: it is of the highest most subtil Tincturing Property, that it can pass and penetrate through all things; the Extraction being from the <hi>Arabian</hi> Spices of all sorts, mingled with the Spirit of Gold, which makes it of a wonderful sublime and vertual Power: With this Oil the Tabernacle, with all that doth appertain to it, must be here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>with anointed, as the Testimony, Altar and Ark. As in the Type, so in the Anti-type look thou for it, it being of that infinite value, that a greater Gift can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not be given, and as I have directed and given Wisdom to model out the Sanctuary, and Ark of my Presence; so likewise Skill and Understanding i<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">

                  </gap> this high and most wonderful secret to make thee a Confectioner, which i<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">

                  </gap> self and others. But this requires great Heedfulness, Purity and Watchfulness, with Love and Faithfulness, to enter upon it with all Earnestness, making it thy absolute Profession and Calling, not regarding nor minding any one thing else; but keeping close within the Rounds of my Sanctuary, where the Basket of Blessing and Store is for thee to live upon. Oh that there were such a Heart in thee as would believe, rest and trust herein, and not look out besides me, then shouldst thou know the length and strength of <hi>Jehova's</hi> Arm, what it should work, act, and do, in defiance to all Reason's false Prophets, which would not have thee break off from that rusty Canker-eating Chain, which hath linked the whole Earthly Inhabitants together, living upon one common Store, not being able to trust to me be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>yond what their Eye of Sense doth see; which is no less than a fine spun piece of Idolatry, even among the Reformed Party. My All-piercing Eye this doth see, &amp; doth hereof still give Warning to thee, and him that solemnly with thee in an Holy Convocation and Priestly Sepe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration
<pb n="104" facs="tcp:29869:97"/>
hath engaged, that in keeping of my Charge ye may my anointed Cherubs be, on which my Tabernacle may rest in its All-flaming Glory: and make your way up to <hi>Sion,</hi> and the Free <hi>Jerusa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lem,</hi> the City and Mansion-House of God your Law-giver and King. All which may be witnessed from within, as the diving still deeper within the Cir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cumference of your own Heavens, the pleasant Sea of Fire, and Glass over to pass, that ye may know the swift Sail, through the forcible Power of the mighty Ark of my Strength within thee, to cut off the flowing Tides of Sense, with which in your Journey on ye may meet. Therefore venture ye not one Step to set, or one remove to make, till you feel Power your Ark to raise, which commandeth all whatever it be to obey. For it is the Anointed of the Lord that is to go before, his Way to prepare, all Moun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tains in its way to level, and to bring down, and all Seas to dry up, and all Worlds of Enmity to subdue. O great is the Force, Strength and Majesty here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of, with whom it is as a Risen Body, moving in its Oily Vertue. It is thy im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pregnable Fort and Tower: out from
<pb n="105" facs="tcp:29869:97"/>
it do not thou go, but as an Apprentice here Bind thy self, for to abide; and then in the High, Spiritual Craft of the All-eternal Mystery thou shalt be taught: and this unparallel'd Composition of the Physical Elixir, and of the Ointment of Life, how to make shalt be instructed.</p>
               <p>But in the First place a Covenant of Secrecy thou art to enter into, not to Reveal it to any, except to thy Fel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low Apprentices; who called are with thee to work in the same Art.</p>
               <p>Then Secondly, Thou art to fulfil the Term and Time hereof, in Truth and Patience unweariedly; till thou comest to be as Exact and Perfect as thy Tea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cher is: this Oil both to make, and then to keep in the Alablaster-Box of perfect Nature.</p>
               <p>Now I shall direct thee next how this is to be done; and that by way of Si<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>militude. Know then that there is a secret hidden Garden, within that Land called <hi>Beulah,</hi> in which grow all Phy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sical Plants, which the River <hi>Pison</hi> doth Water. It is a temperate Climate,
<pb n="106" facs="tcp:29869:98"/>
neither too Hot, nor too Cold: and the Sun never goeth down there. For there is no Night, but one perpetual Day in the borders of this Blessed and Beautiful Land. And here do grow all sorts of Herbs, that have such a vigorous Seed of Life in them, that their Life never doth fade. Here also groweth every kind of Spicy Trees, which through the Exhaling Sun, through the rest of the Divine Planets, do produce a mighty strong Frangrancy; infomuch that none into this Place can come, but Seraphical Ones; who are used to this pure Cli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mate. Here are hid within the Bowels of this Holy Ground, the Veins of pure Gold, with all Oriental Pretious Stones. Behold I have now described to thee the Place, out of which the Confection, and Matter, of this Magestery, Oil, or Oint<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment is to be made.</p>
               <p>But thou wilt say, <hi>This is a Sealed up Place; none here can come; it is a Gar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>den so richly furnished, that who is it amongst Mortals, who with the Key may herewith be entrusted? Although into</hi> Paradise <hi>my Spirit is admitted, yet into this All lustrous Privy-Garden I could
<pb n="107" facs="tcp:29869:98"/>
have no entrance.</hi> True it is, that hi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>therto it hath been concealed; because it was not proper for thee herein to come, until entred thou hadst to be Wisdom's Royal and Professed Phy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sician; withal taking the Degree of her High Philosopher, to know the Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture of her Stone. The Matter where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of within this Garden hath it self hid. Come gird up thy Spirit, put on the Sandals upon thy Feet, cast over thee the pure Garment of the Cherubin-work; and follow me into this Secret Place. The Door-keeper here doth well know my Voice: to the Call of Wisdom he will open, thou shalt see.</p>
               <p>Which indeed to me accordingly was made good: for my Intellectual Spirit was hither presently moved, and made to pass; where in Reality, though af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter a Spiritual Manner, I did come, with my Guide, into thy unknown Planta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion. Where Magically I did espy Beds of Herbs and of Flowers, in great order they did grow in a rarisied Beauty, and their Lustre they did cast to attract mine Inward Eye. Then in great and holy Awe I did to my Mistress of the Physical Art my self apply. Who then said to
<pb n="108" facs="tcp:29869:99"/>
me, Take good heed, and gather thou there where I shall express to thee; for thou art come, where the real and choice Simples do grow out of the All-Essential Good. Upon which no Corrupter ever came, or could come: or with any of these Springing Essences was ever ming<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led hereupon. By the Serpent no Poy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sonable Rays were ever here at all scat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tered: it is a Place which ever from his Eye was hid, by the Divine Constella<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions. All which Plants here thou dost see, from one Seed do after their kind thus multiply in this Variety.</p>
               <p>Now for the Holy Ointment, which I would give thee skill to make, Go first to that Bed where the pretious <hi>Thyme</hi> is included, and take there seven Hand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fuls thereof: then take the like quan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tity of the <hi>Baulm</hi> of Hope; and of the Sweet <hi>Majoram</hi> of <hi>Patience,</hi> according to the same perfect number, as the two former. To these let there be also ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded the Spirit of <hi>Mints</hi> Power, the <hi>Eye-bright</hi> of All-seeing, the <hi>Rue</hi> of Fortitude, and the <hi>Hyssop</hi> of Purity. These do thou gather when the Sun-Beams are in their greatest heighth and Influence: and extract the Juice out of
<pb n="109" facs="tcp:29869:99"/>
them, and so dissolve it with the Kidney-Fat of a choice Deer, that must be slain on purpose for this use. This thou wilt know is to be obeyed and yielded to, though it be even thy dear Sensitive Life, which for this Composition must be dissolved: the Death of which is on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly Serviceable for so Secret an Use. Hereupon a soft gentle Fire from the Altar is to be taken; and then diffuse in the Golden Vessel of the pure Humanity, and thou shalt see what a fragrant Restorative Ointment this will come to be; where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by all Cures shall be wrought Practition<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally, the Knowledge of this Art being engrafted in thee, as a Natural Scyon co-inherent within thy inward parts, to transmute and make all that which was of a divided Property, to be of one pure and rarified Sort and Constitution; as re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lating to the healing part, which through the whole Manhood is to disperse it self to settle all again in its first Primitive Order.</p>
               <p>Then again here is another secret greatly requisite to be learnt, as the Spicy Oil, which is the Spirit of Spirits, extracted, and drawn out from the Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven Spirits mentioned: the Ingredients
<pb n="110" facs="tcp:29869:100"/>
to this are deep, and worthy of Inquiry: which cannot be illustrated but by way of Metaphorical Description; which the wise and apt under Wisdom's Manu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duction will soon understand, for that all the Materials are lying or growing so close about thee within this Physical Garden; which may be called the Eflux of the Deity, which evaporateth through every Plant and Tree which groweth here: from and by which ye may understand the high and precious Quality of whatever you shall a Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>position make out.</p>
               <p>Hereupon did arise a Query, Whether it might not be as effectual to take of these Plants and Trees as they naturally grow in themselves, for an healing Bal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>som, and Liquor, for the restoring of Life, without mingling them in a Confection<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ary way? To this I was answered thus by the holy and profound Artist, that said, Through the uniting of many Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rits, Powers and Vertues into one sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lime Substance, there is produced an Almighty Force and Strength, which would not be while they continued in their separated Essences; but through the Coagulation by the Hand of Wis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom,
<pb n="111" facs="tcp:29869:100"/>
into one Quintessence, it would have its vigorous penetration, as in the accomplishment hereof ye may witness, if ye wax not saint, but persevere with all diligence, and not be turned aside, though you do meet sometime with the Waters of Strife; but hold out, or all is lost which already is wrought. For I would not that either of you who so vo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>luntarily your selves to me have bound, should grow weary, till I your Work have crowned, having chosen you out of my Olive-Ground to sprout, that so ye may to each other empty forth, what I your Fountain have blessed you with, as a fruitful Womb to bring forth even that mighty Lordly Sprout, which will make your Heavens and Earth to shout; and all the Hosts of them to praise and celebrate the Rising <hi>Star</hi> from the East, therefore with all fear and care go on, and persevere, till that all things shall be put under him who is born in you the King of <hi>Salem,</hi> against whom great Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>spiracies will be, but as he in you shall grow up, he shall them all defeat, through the Crown of this anointing Oil, which I am to shew thee how to make. First then come with me into my
<pb n="112" facs="tcp:29869:101"/>
secret <hi>Lebanon,</hi> where the Beds of Spices are, and take thee seven Ounces of the <hi>Mace</hi> of Grace, of like quantity of the <hi>Spikenard</hi> of Love; the <hi>Camphore</hi> of Peace; the Heart-cheering <hi>Cloves,</hi> of the <hi>Saffron</hi> of Joy; the Noble <hi>Frankin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cence</hi> of all Faith; the <hi>Myrrh</hi> of Trium<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phant Victory; the <hi>Casst</hi> of a Sound Mind and Perfect Heart. Take all these and put them under the grinding Wheel which maintaineth its uncessant working Motion within thee, till they come to be an Oily Substance, mixed into one per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect Lump, then diffuse all in the Juice of the <hi>Pomegranat</hi> for a certain time, ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding hereunto the Powder of Gold of <hi>Pervilium,</hi> which is to be mixed with the Magistery of <hi>Pearl,</hi> and the <hi>Ruby-</hi>Spirit; all which close in a pure Crystalline Bottle, into which nothing ever before was put, and set it constantly under the Sun-shine of thy Heavens for the perfect Clarification thereof: Which at the tenth number will attain to the full height of a Life-quickning Spirit.</p>
               <p>Having taken good notice of this My<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sterious Receit, I lay'd it up in me as a Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cious Jewel, resolving to follow the Rules of this Intrinsick one, and to
<pb n="113" facs="tcp:29869:101"/>
make an experiment hereof if by any means it might be brought to a Triune Body of such sublimity. All which must be wrought in the Tent of the Virgin-Wisdom, where no soiling thing must interfere, while this Composition is in doing: And only Sanctuary Instruments I did see must be used here. Having then order to discharge all out of this Cele<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stial Place, no Servant which appertained to the old and first Tabernacle, I durst to admit, for my aid, or help, or in any service therein to imploy. Now all that are to rest within this Place, where the Glory of the Majesty does it self un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fold, with the first Balsam must be a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nointed; thus to me it was declared. Oh the great Purity that I did see was required in ministring about these Holy Things! it cutteth off quite from all In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>termedlings in a putrified Earthly State; the Eye so single and clear is through this Ointment, purifying it, that it can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not bear any more to behold in it self either Spot, Blemish, or Wrinkle, know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing well none else in the Tabernacle of God's Holiness with him can live. Therefore in the Oil of Consecration I am appointed for to abide, and to drink of
<pb n="114" facs="tcp:29869:102"/>
this Liquor of Life, which suddenly may ready be through the diligent Hand that prepareth it, as I do both feel and see: which maketh my Spirit so intent here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>upon, that while the great Artist is at work, I know not how my Eye to take off, that so I may be able and skilful after the same manner this to congeal, and mix in its number, weight and mea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sure. For indeed ambitious I am this choice Drink always to have by me, that hereof I may take at pleasure, and also give thereof to the Thirsty, which in Wisdom's choice are thereof wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thy.</p>
               <p>And as I was thus spreading my Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quests, before the Holy Mercy-Seat with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in the new raised Tabernacle, I heard a Voice from thence speak; Anoint every Vessel within my Sanctuary, that all may be sublimed and scented with that Ointment, which Wisdom hath within thy Tent made. Then in this interim I did feel somewhat break and fly, as if a bundle had been untied: Myrrh and Spikenard more pleasant to the Nostrils could not be then this. Somewhat did diffuse it self so richly, as if it would dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>solve me into its own Balsamick Nature.
<pb n="115" facs="tcp:29869:102"/>
Oh how affected was my Spirit with that Oily Burning upon the Altar, upon which the Seven Lamp-Spirits do draw forth Matter to feed upon! the Taber<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nacle needed no other Light then what from hence did shine. Thus surrounded in Love's Pavilion; I did set, refreshed from what here did flow in, all through<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out me warming. This was a good re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quital for my earnest and all attentive waiting within the Sanctuary, not out-departing, therein meeting with all satisfying Provision, which doth invite our Spirits here to abide; till the Spicy Liquor be fully ripe, which upon the preparing is, against the Great Day of the Feast. This made up is of such choice Rarities as may well provoke our Appetites, having Intelligence before<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hand at what a high rate our Table is to be furnished.</p>
               <p>After the finishing of the Tabernacle-work, an order from the Heavenly Court did come forth for a Convocation of a Seven Days separation to be held by us, who are called lawfully for to strive to be Masters of the Divine Art, according to Wisdom's high Philosophi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cal Rules. Therefore in order to the
<pb n="116" facs="tcp:29869:103"/>
perfecting of this Balsamical Medicine and Restorative Elixer, this Counsel further she did to me give forth; saying, Watch, Pray, and Wait, within the Sanctuary, gathering together as in one, all the Spicy Powers to make a Perfumed In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cense, to offer upon the Altar; from which Celestial Fire will arise, which will make you Pray in the Holy Ghost with flaming Terrour, which only will effect the Blessing upon this your so great Un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dertaking, for which uncessant Invoca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions are breathed forth from the Cloven Tongue rising from the Altar-Fire, which is the efficacious Spirit of Prayer, that as a Flame inspired through the Ghostly Breath, doth mount and pass through all things: no Principle can bind or de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain it, but swiftly it pierceth and pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vaileth, when the Oily Incense after this manner is mingled with it; therefore as ye would Prevailers, strong, potent and mighty be with your God, for to ask and receive; let the Flaming Incense still your Advocate be, and then your Intercessions of like force will be as those of <hi>Moses</hi> and <hi>Elias</hi> in their Day, as ye will see; now then a set and an ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pointed time let there be for these Holy
<pb n="117" facs="tcp:29869:103"/>
Offerings to be brought unto the Altar. Draw near ye Holy and Seperated Ones, and dedicate it with what is unblemish<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, multiply seven times seven your pure Meat and Drink-Offerings, till that you no more conscious are of Sins de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>filement within this Sanctnary dwelling; where forbidden is all Servile-working, during the time that this solemn Convo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cation is celebrating.</p>

               <p>An Understanding was now given to me, to know and discern the Root and Seed of that growing Mystical Body, into which the Kingdom of God was to descend, which would finish and put an end to all imperfect things, because it con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sisted of all Faith, Power, Purity, Wisdom, Strength and All-sufficiency; to make com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pleat the comers hereunto, that so their might be an absolute Dominion within our selves, and a gathering into one Body all Spiritual Ghostly Operations, which are of impregnable Force and Might, till the Kingdom after this manner shews it self, all lieth under the vail of Obscurity, and

               <p>From this Word of Instruction I was convinced of the expediency of having conjunction and mixture with the Fe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>male Virgin tincture, in which I was made to understand what Force, Might and Strength lieth couched therein, as the Womb which conceiveth and bringeth forth numberless Birth-Powers into a manifest Existence: therefore no sooner do's the <hi>Shilah</hi> grow up, which signifies the grown state of Jesus, that for him is de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>signed a Spouse &amp; Bride, that so Male and Female in one pure Virgin-Body might meet together to quicken, and raise the dead Essences of the Life, which so long have been sunk into its central ground, and is not to be awakened but through the uniting Powers of Spiri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tual <hi>Sol</hi> and <hi>Venus,</hi> which is after an Hypostatical going into each other; ming<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling Powers, according to the Nature and Vertue of the precious Golden Seed which in the divine Matrix is sown, as the Materiallity of that most pure Ghostly Body, which from hence is be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gotten
<pb n="125" facs="tcp:29869:107"/>
and generated, as was expresly unfolded unto me, that we might know the way and manner of this wonderful propagation the Spirit and Bride. From this opening the great necessity was shewn me, for the following close this conjucal Band of Marriage-Consumma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion for effectual operation, depending thereupon: for the Man-God cannot be without his Virgin-Female, which hath the tinctural Deity, which is the Glory of the Lamb, Wisdom's Bridegroom, which when grown up in us to Marriage-state, seeketh a Companion that is sui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tably accomplished with all Divine Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fections, for Joy, Delight, and Increase in the Heavenly Gifts and Powers, after the manner of a Divine Celestial co-opera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, from whence is the ingendring of all pure Births, that admission and right have to the Kingdom of Light, Joy and Glory. In this lieth the great Secret of the new model of Nature again formed, and quickned in a bodified Substance, far transcending that which is brought forth according to the outward Elements, which is for ever remote from the Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther of Spirits, who hath given charge that no Wife shall be taken for his <hi>Isaac</hi>

out from that strange Birth and Lineage: for all bringeth forth according to its Likeness; that which is born of Spirit, is Essential, Mighty and Powerful, as the similitude of God. Now then saith the Spirit, that hath all good will to you, which have made out for this high Match for your selves: Oh go forward and prosper, send forth all your Royal Train to meet your <hi>Rebecca</hi> at the Wells of Joy and Salvation: present her by the Hand of Faith, those strong scented Love-Bracelets and Chain for her Neck, that may give full Testimony of both your high floated Affections towards her.</p>

Therefore a stop to the Earthly angry Sea, which foameth from the deep sense of a Quagmire-Center is determined into a restraint, and binding up; for care is taken for the prevention of this conti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nued Strife and Mutiny, which made you in such bitter Conflicts and Soul-Agonies, to be tyring out your days with endless Debates from Reasons strong Assaults.

All which Floods upon me were pour'd; but Jesus my Rock all over covered me, so as these Waters of temptation could not sink into me. This try'd Stone shun'd not to espouse my Cause, and quarrel, and plainly told me, I should not al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ways Married be with Beasts, which out of the Wild Forrest of Nature doth spring: the time was hastening, when they should chained up, and confined be in their own place of Black Darkness, as ashamed to come forth when the set<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>time is accomplished for the Bridegroom's appearance unto us; observing for my forwarning that upon or near the time of such invading and disquieting Spirits conspiracy, I am foreshewn it, in way of Vision.

Much from this was shewed me, and I well know is to have its daily Accomplishment: and therefore in this way is it manifested for Advertisement unto us, who are thus far in the process of Jesus ingaged, that we should not by any of these things be terrified or amazed, while we see the Tro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phy of Victory concludes the Hellish Tragedy very comfortably.</p>

               <p>This Vision was a plain demonstration of the third and last fixed State of the Holy Ghost, who for our succour and relief will come to safe guard and carry us up to our prepared Kingdom, as it was revealed to me, that all former Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nistrations would decrease, and unto us cease. Though Wisdom did conceive us in her Womb, and did bring us forth, and so passed us over in our Minority to our Jesus; we by him having attained to a more grown State, he doth trans<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mit us over to the care and charge of the Holy Ghost, where only we shall find winged Power and Shelter, and who will be a glorious Banner over us.

Which Word as a Cordial-draught is given, to renew both Strength and Spirit. Again, as we were waiting together in and up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on our Temple-Service, this Word came unto me, Behold the effect of every Vision is at hand, spare not to strengthen your Tabernacle-stakes, and to fix your Temple-Pillars: for it shall be said from this place, Blessed is the high Throne-Glory, who must prepare a Seat for this Holy One: and strictly watch ye that no unhallowed thing enter in, into this separated place. For you know not how suddainly the transmuting Ghostly Powers will spring out of its own Eter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal Ground. Who soon will scent and smell, if any of the old leavened and putrified lump there be remaining. Therefore the cry so often in thy inward Land doth sound, that so no unclean thing may there be found, and that all Earthly stuff may be thrown out of it. For the Holy Ghost is appointed in this new rai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed Temple to officiate; and all perfect
<pb n="140" facs="tcp:29869:115"/>
Service to be performed at a higher rate, more Seraphick, and Purer, then in all former Ministrations whatever. Oh now then to my Call and Cry within you, take special Recognizance: it is my <hi>Elijah</hi>'s Voice, that the Way of the Holy Ghost might be made plain and strait. Take heed no Lyon or Wolf so much as once set their Foot on it. <hi>Make your Watch still strong, for slimy muddy Pits are on each hand, the great</hi> Levia than <hi>there doth under Water lie, waiting to see if here you do set your Feet awry. For this subtle Serpent doth well know, hereby all former and present Prophecyes will be prolonged, if not cut off.</hi> So that if, by any means, he could Ingulf you within this noisome Pit, where all devouring Fish of Prey do lie, which still would be eating out your Belief and Confidence, in what do's lie beyond the Border of the Senses, he will not fail to do so. Because it is not for the gross, but for the pure and immaculate Eye only to espy those Celestial Glories. Whereof not only to the Sight, I do here you, (my beloved Lambs) invite; but come, I say, and tast, what in my up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per Banquetting-House is to be found,
<pb n="141" facs="tcp:29869:115"/>
to which ye yet so high never ascended, where the Ghostly Body upon the Cry<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stalline Sea is set. But stay yet ye must, and ye must it not touch with unwashen Hands; with strong scented Oil your Finger must drop, while in this Dish ye them dip, to give proof ye are a pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pared Guest, who have put on the Bride<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>groom your Robe: this will be your Tickets Testimony, that right you have to eat of this choice Mess, which only for the Bride and Bridegroom are set forth. Though with many sweet and pleasant Fruits, I have out of my <hi>Paradisical</hi> Garden, you fed, and with the Spirit of the Vine, I have your Thirsts often satisfied, yet none like, or to be com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pared to this. Therefore it is reserved as the strong Meat, which only those that are come to ripe and perfect Age, can bear thereof to eat. Therefore go thy way, and be comforted, that ye are entred into Love's Eternal Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lendar, and may assuredly of this last and great Gift partake, as ye shall in the bright Temple grow, reaching to the full Stature of your <hi>Jesus.</hi> To which Coming, fear not, but your Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther will equally dispence the Holy

How much will it be the joy of Wisdom your Mother, to see you come up through all Tribulations to inherit the Antient and Royal Seat, near unto that Great King, your Prince, and Personal Saviour; through the introducing of his pure Spirit and Nature: without which ye never had been capable, of so high a Calling, as to have fellowship with him, not only in the Knowledge, but in the joint Possession, without any defraud; as ye shall see impartially, when this Ghostly-Dove with her Che<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rubin-Wing, doth with all Power upon you rest, so as no more from you ever to flye, or withdraw.

               <p>FRom the 6th. of this present, to the 13th. I have been exercised in great Conflicts, upon and through a sudden surprize upon the mortal part of my Companion and Fellow-Labourer in that <hi>Paradisical</hi> Husbandry; he being smote, and struck as with a <hi>Leviathian</hi> Dart up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on his Animal and Vital Spirit; the first time was on the <hi>Monday,</hi> being abroad, upon his returning home; which went over again. The next Day about the same time a Feaver took him, and in great Violence ceased on his Heart, and so he wrestled a good space of time, in great Anguish; which so affected me, that I drew in, and awakned a great Travel for his escape from these Sorrows of Death, which had so ceased upon him: I having had some warning of an immi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nent Danger and Peril, which I saw the Night before he was first aff<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">

<pb n="144" facs="tcp:29869:117"/>
he went from home: As thus, there was a deep Pit with great Swelling Waters, under which the sub<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">
                     <desc>•…</desc>
                  </gap>il <hi>Levia: than,</hi> with his outstretched Jaws, did lie, to grasp in such as near there did walk. Now the Doctor with my self being that way to pass, I heard a word uttered, Be ware, come not too near: it is a dangerous place. Upon which I watchful was, and took good heed, and a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>voided it, that the Doctor might not there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in be ingulphed; but draw off with all speed. Which did predict there was some Danger nigh; this being the Pit of Death, as by the effect thereof soon did shew it self: But the mighty <hi>Jeho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vah</hi> hereunto a Counter-check did give, to reverse what the destroying Angel was upon executing. For this second assault was very grievous, being upon <hi>Tuesday;</hi> which did abide on his vital Spirits from 4 in the Afternon, till 10 at Night. In which interim a <hi>Daniel's</hi> Spirit did come down, which in us did Pray with mighty fervency, winged up by Faith; as knowing that in this ascending Power stood our help. For after I had ceased, and the Doctor began to Pray, I saw a bright Star dance about his Bed,
<pb n="145" facs="tcp:29869:117"/>
and a Word came with it unto me, I have heard, and I will deliver, for my own Name sake, out of the present Jaws of Death. This was a signal Evidence that Saving Health was near, and that in this Hour of Exercise <hi>Jesus</hi> with his Healing Vertue would appear; which soon after was witnessed. So the Pains for that time were asswaged; and he slept that Night, and the next Day had respite: So as we did hope this Storm was gone over. But on <hi>Wednesday</hi> Night he found himself ill again. So together we did seek the Lord for his Counsel, whether or no he might venture upon some out<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward means, to help to remove that vio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lent Humour, which by that strong <hi>Le<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viathan,</hi> would have grasped away his Life. For without permission from the Court and College of our Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritual Physicians, we dared not to ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venture; because we had committed the whole Cure of this deadly Wound, to those All-healing Soveraign Powers.</p>
               <p>While then we were supplicating and soliciting to know the Mind of Wisdom <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">
                     <desc>•…</desc>
                  </gap>erein, this Word came; It is suffered <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">

<pb n="146" facs="tcp:29869:118"/>
Drugs shall be changed in their Constitution, and Quality: for else they in this case could not be available. For know, that my secret Medicine must be the Preparative. Then after this the Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctor was free to take a Powder, which gave him two or three Vomits, and Pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gations. On <hi>Thursday</hi> Morning after which he was very cheerful, and thought himself to be eased of his weight, and talon which had so terrified him: but after he had Dined, it beset him again, more fiercely and violently then at any time before; the extremity being so great, as he desired to be released by Death, as the greatest kindness, which he could in this hour of Extremity of his Heavenly Father seek and request for. At this sudden onset upon him I was somewat staggered: for the Black Cloud of Death seemed all over to cover him, which seemed to make void and frustrate those Words and Tokens I had received for his Restoration on the <hi>Tuesday</hi> Night before. But in this juncture of time I felt a Power upon me to descend, that made me Pray as in an all-Bloody-Ago<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny: and a mighty Strife betwixt Fear and Faith was in me. But the strong
<pb n="147" facs="tcp:29869:118"/>
Angel of Faith prevailed, and I felt some<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing move, that was all aiery, mighty, and swift, to overcome and conquer: and which would not permit to give him up to what he himself desired. Then had I a sight of all the dark afflicting Powers to be put under his Feet, and that they should no longer over his mor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tal part have power. The Relation of which I did to him declare: but such was his anguish, that at that time he could nothing from me hear. So this Day and Night was passed away in this terrible Conflict. All Night I retired from him, wrestling with my God on his behalf; waiting and watching what the issue of this trial would be. For I do not know that I ever was in any one thing more proved; because of the Word that came, that he should be saved from Death. Towards the Morning this Word came to me, God is not a Man, that he should repent, or reverse what he hath spoken, as to him for whom thou hast prayed. Then coming to him, I found him yet Ill. Then had I another Word all that Day followed me, saying, I am come to give him Life, and that more abundantly: therefore let thy mind
<pb n="148" facs="tcp:29869:119"/>

So I saw the good Hand of our God was near, and did the whole Cure; and after this Bleeding, he found a great alteration, although before that, his Extremity was much mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tigated, but not so sensibly taking it away, as he now in himself did see. So that by the Counsel of Wisdom, he was hereunto directed most expresly; to whose sight the Malady was only con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>spicuons: all outward Physicians in their sight would have been too short, and their power too weak; and had been befooled and frustrated, if any ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pectation had been thence. For the Word for immediate Healing still fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowed close one upon another, as mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter of doubt arose. Again the Word thus spake, O faithless and unbelieving, have I not said I will make him perfect<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly whole? Which was the last Confirma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, that I had on his behalf, as to his outward Recovery. Upon which I ful<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly rested, and was quieted as to him: who from this time recruited his Natu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral Force and Strength, which was a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bated more then he himself was sensible of. But gradually he shall grow to his former strength again, as a Monu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment

For the Dragon did see he would much more be a pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sessed Enemy than ever, to all his strong Holds and Territories. But Wisdom's Antidore of such an high extracted Composition was made up that it ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pelled all his poysonable Influences; she coming in with her Adjuring Power and unresistible Spell, saying, <hi>O Death, I will be thy Death:</hi> Thus the Victory was obtained through the Life-Blood, <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">

<pb n="153" facs="tcp:29869:121"/>
as to be terrified, although ye should like <hi>Elisha</hi> be encompassed with Legions of contradicting Spirits. Which may happen to prove what Magnanimity, and Spirit of Faith ye have, to trust unto: And whether or no ye will resort to this Treasure, that lately hath been broken up for you, that ye might know where still to retire, and on all ocasions go to seek out what Power and Armory of Strength, ye shall need for your pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sent Succour and Fortitude. Oh to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards this let your Eyes be most abso<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lutely fixed: for it is your Father's plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sure, out of this Temple, and Treasure-House to bless you. Covet nothing here below, but wait ye upon that li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>beral Hand, which doth all out here command. If ye can arrive to believe without doubting, then ye shall see what weighty Draughts out of Wisdom's Deep you will be able to draw up at pleasure; so as ye will no more need, or regard to go down to this World's enchanted Sorce<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries for aid. All and enough you will have in your own Power. Search and see what in this City-Treasury is: as you are by Wisdom brought up hereunto. Take boldness and freedom to ask, and
<pb n="154" facs="tcp:29869:122"/>
take what may make for your Prefer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, in all proportionableness to Christ your Head. Who is the great Prince and Commander here, and would have you dispatch, and clear off all Earthly Scores, and come after him with all your ascending Might, where there is depth of Glory to drown ye, out of all tran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sitory Sight. Remember ye that Word which he said, and do now in Spirit aver it again to thee, that all whatever the Immense Deity hath to the utmost, and full extent of that fulness in all Riches, Power, and Greatness to an Everlasting Dominion is now possessed by this Jesus, as his own in common, with the high Throne-Majesty. And hath power to entail the same where, and upon whom he will. By which Will, ye are elected and chosen by this great and high Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stle, to the same Profession, and Parti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cipation of Power, and Dignity, as joint Heirs with him. Therefore take heed, that ye derogate not from this your high Calling, but bear up to the Witness hereof, and to the acknowledgment of the Father, the Word, and the Spirit of Wisdom, all agreeing to empress the Mark, and living Seal upon you, that
<pb n="155" facs="tcp:29869:122"/>
so right to all those wonderful, and rich Goods, that have been shewn you, in the House of your God, ye may jointly enter upon, as your own Inheritance. Hitherto ye have stood off in the mistrust, and dispute, whether or no ye might make challenge hereunto, as being anxi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous of Sin, and inaffected, which in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed might well clip the Wing of your ascending Power, and dash your con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fidence. For no boldness indeed here could be, till Jesus by Water, Blood and Spirit, did come to cleanse you fully and throughly from all Sin and Un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>righteousness, and thereby he himself became your Temple-Body, as now ye may witness indeed. Therefore Stow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>age is made for taking in of these pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cious things.

               <p>On the Morning Watch, as I was spreading the present distress of things, this Word came to me, Salvation, Salvation, and Victory! The oppressed at last shall go free; If zealous as <hi>Phineas,</hi> he shall be for me; His Eye is not to pity or spare, but he is to rise up in his Priestly Power to kill and destroy, that which hath his <hi>Nazarite</hi> Purity defiled and annoyed. Then no more Curse nor Plague, but all shall be stopt and staid. I have attempted this Bloody Offering, nothing more precious is to my Sight: nothing like this could make way, for the high ascending of my beloved Pil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>grim, who so long with Weights and
<pb n="157" facs="tcp:29869:123"/>
Fetters from me hath been kept down, and evermore by one or other, was still bound. Oh the free, and undefiled Vir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gin-Spirit is for me, who makes but one Heart with me. This Word came very emphatically and powerfully, and hath a weight speaking in them; which my Spirit did breath out for their effect, upon this beloved <hi>Nazarite,</hi> that so all Plummets might be cut off, and the Tomb-stone removed, which did keep down his rising Body, that is no more to be touched with mortal Senses; being elected for a high and unparallelled Work, which will admit of no hanging upon by any thing that is ponderous.</p>

<pb n="158" facs="tcp:29869:124"/>
which we were embarked, through the good Hand of the most high Wisdom: Being now come within the sight of out Land-mark, which so near was to be anchored upon; such were the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary Winds from the Troubler, as to put us back again in this our Spiritual Voyage. But the good Pilote, whom the Seas and Winds must still obey, was for, and with us, sending forth the Words of Power and Authority, for this raging foaming Sea, which cast up Miery Moun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tains, to be still and quiet: which other<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wise would have sunk the Ark of our Faith, which, to the Praise of <hi>Jehovah,</hi> was mightily in all these violent fuma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions born up, and secured, we being char<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ged not to fear, nor to move out here, but still to hoist up that mighty Sail, and to wait for that holy Breath and Wind; Which none know, but they that are in it, from whence it comes, and whether it will carry such, as wholly confide in it; as may be spoken by the Experienced. For being in great Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flict, upon the Doctor's account, whom the evil ones Malice was chiefly set a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainst, to keep him down from rising in his work: having put such an Iron-Yoke
<pb n="159" facs="tcp:29869:124"/>
upon his Neck, and Burthen upon his Shoulder, as grew more heavy and op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pressing, as his Sight was grown clear, and Judgment sound, having been a long time in great Sufferings under it, which for the working Wheel sake, which jointly we were engaged in, I was often and much in private with my God, for a total release and acquitment, that whatever pestred, and hung upon him now undesirable, might be cut off. For to me it was said again and again, An un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>touched and free <hi>Nazarite</hi> from all <hi>Da<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lilah's,</hi> thy Yoke-fellow must be, or else under the Curb of this grievous Iron-Yoke, which will crush and stop his Vital-Breath Powers, so as to hinder the free passage and play of Wisdom's bright Star, which alone will lie as a bundle of Myrrh in the Bosom of his pure Heart. Single Chastity is all, and the chief Dow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry which she makes Inquisition for, and therefore of all low amorous entangling Loves, we had need to be well aware: to one only Mate we must for ever cleave, and so bear his Name, and so we are all his Royal state. These Counsels still daily followed me, since his deliverance out of the Snare and Pit of Death, so
<pb n="160" facs="tcp:29869:125"/>
did I believe to see all Cords would be broken; for that Word came to me the 20th. Instant, I will arise, saith thy God, as in Mount <hi>Perazim,</hi> that he may do his Work, his strange Work, and bring to pass his strange Act. This Scripture was brought to me, and opened thus, being much stated and presented, as our Cause was parallel with <hi>David,</hi> whom God highly approved for, that being newly settled in his Kingdom, after great Wars, was again invaded by the <hi>Phi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>listines,</hi> and having brought up the Ark of God, enquiring, had a resolve, that his Enemies should be subdued before him; as he acknowledged, saying, That God had broken in upon them, like the breaking forth of Waters, therefore they called the Name of that place, 1 <hi>Chro<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">

I will now arise to give my signal Mark of Honour to my defi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed and contemned ones, my Spirit shall begin to move even now at times, as ye shall look and wait for it, within the Tent of Nature, as the forerunning Scat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terings of that promised all Chostly Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minion and Power, that is very ready, and near to be revealed to the pure <hi>Je<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rusalem-</hi>Worshippers and constant Wai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters: upon whom my Eye will be, to confer upon them this great Dowry,

               <p>The Case of a <hi>Laban</hi> and <hi>Jacob</hi> was brought to me, as having a special refe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rence to the Doctor. That as <hi>Jacob</hi> grew very weary of living in a strange Land, and under servitude in Bonds, now long<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed to be free a Spirit, and to return to his Father's House, with that Spiritual Stock, and Riches of Life, that Wisdom had blessed him withal, and to provide for the sustainment of his own Family, within himself, of which the outward was but a shadow and type of. So it was shewn me in like manner this was the
<pb n="168" facs="tcp:29869:129"/>
time, &amp; the full Experiment of the Doctor's long and weary servitude, in a strange Land and Country, who was now called to separate, and come away to his. Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther's House, and to draw in all his Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stance and Stock of Vital Spirit, whence<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>forth the pure Virgin-Essences do spring, that nothing thereof might be scattered, or left behind: for all will be little e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nough to supply and maintain that which is of pure Generation in him; wherein will consist his true Joy and Pleasure to him, to his Sons and Daughters, his Men-Servants and Maid-Servants, to grow up to Stature fat and flourishing in his own House. In this saith the Spirit shall be his Blessing; but while these things are up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on the prosecution, great Tribulations from the <hi>Laban</hi> Spirit must be expected, for he will never consent to let <hi>Jacob</hi> go. Therefore Wisdom did put it into his Heart, to make the breach by steal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing away: for <hi>Laban</hi> with his subtle En<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>treaties, would have plyed him as formerly. Which to avoid, he resolved to make his own way, sore longing af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter his Father's House, which made him run the hazard of all <hi>Laban's</hi> displea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sure. This wise understanding Spirit
<pb n="169" facs="tcp:29869:129"/>
was now given to the Doctor, to be couragious, and so to resolve to take his Flight and Journey on; having with him, and for him <hi>Jacob's</hi> Angel, that will not leave him, till safe conducted into the inward Court of the Love, and Joy-presence of the Father. Now in the process thereto, <hi>Laban</hi> raiseth an Army, that are of the same Evil Eye with himself, and these pursue hard to over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>take, but God disappoints the Evil in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tended, and gives warning, saying, I warn and charge, that ye let my First-Born go free, touch not mine Anointed, for he must now Ascend to me; no Bonds or Cords shall evermore be upon him, but as a free Denison in my Holy City, is he to wait upon all my Commands. For my Work is so great, that all must be taken up in them. Ye who hasten up your selves thereunto, must be found in one en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tire Act, working with the Spirit of my Might, without sloath. For which end I have now set you free, that ye may stand obligatory to no other Commands, but wait to receive Laws and Injunctions as Wisdom shall renew to you. The Oyl will not cease to run, empty your Vessels as fast as you can, it will be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come
<pb n="170" facs="tcp:29869:130"/>
in you a rising bubling Life, till it hath made you pure without Sin. By which you will give proof, that you are the first Redeemed out of the Earth. Go on to this Work, my elected Ones, the high Powers of Eternity are with you, to effect what the Spirit of Wis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom doth direct unto.</p>

               <p>In the Night-Vision, I with another Person were to make a new remove to some place, which we had no knowledge of, being under a strict limitation there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to to hasten. The way, which we were to pass, I saw as a fiery Oven, which when we came at, put us to a stop: then waiting and looking on it a while, the Flames died, and soon were vanished.

Then the guiding Word said, Pass on, fear not, the place is not now too hot to set your Feet upon; which after some debate with our selves, we ventured through. Then was presented to our view, a Knot of all Precious Stones, as if they had been taken out of a Rock: truly they were for Colours, and Bright<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness, and Sparkling, so excelling, so wonderful Transparent, as all, and the highest of what can be illustrated out from this Creation, is but a gloomy shadow hereunto. The glance was sudden, and soon passed out of my view, only pointing and leaving a great Impression, as to the late Manifesta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, and the moving forward to the <hi>Jerusalem-</hi>Work. Which yet required a higher, and more Seraphick ascending up of our Spirits, then hitherto hath been: which I was in great Jeapardy about, both for that others, and also for my own sufficiency, and spiritual ability to go forward, and through paved Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rits to follow on.

we could come to this City: That Word still saying, Only believe, and I will pass on before you, proclaiming my Name, and opening to you the Foun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dation of it; from whence your strength shall arise, and your pregnant Power shall be known.

For I am making away for you, out of all these first de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>solate part of things: your Hands with me, I require you to put, and so you shall stop, and prevent the Flood-Gates of the Beast, and of the Serpent's fury.

               <p>O Thou inquisitive Spirit, what is it thou hast seen in my Glass? A City which is founded upon a Rock of all Precious Stones? The measuring Line is still in the Hand of thy Angel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guide, to shew thee further hereinto: And now to present the Walls, that must be raised upon these twelve Foun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dations. The Line of my Eternal Spirit is squaring all according to Wisdom's Counsel. What now thinkest thou are to be the Materials of these Walls but all flaming Seraphims, holding Palms of Victory, and light glistering Shields in their Hands? These are the Walls, which shall ever be before me garuished, with the bright sparkling Powers of Cherub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>work, every where engraven by the Pencil of my Spirit: Who skilful is to write in Gold the Inscription of the highest Perfection of Holiness, round

these Walls. Nothing out here spring<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing will be, but Lillies and blushing Roses, which represent the mutual Em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>braces of the Bridegroom and the Bride. Whose Emblems every where, within this Holy Place, are to be pourtraied, as a new formed Image, of unchangeable Beauty and Perfection, in the room and place of that faded, withered coupl<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">

For out of this City will come the true and right Marriage, of which the first was but a Type; for the Lamb and the Bride will bring forth here a fruitful Off-spring; as it is said of this <hi>Zion,</hi> Blessed is the Man that is <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">

               <p>But thou, whose Queries are come up before me, concerning these Gates, why they are recorded to stand Northward and Southward; Eastward and West<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward? and to be all alike, no difference, and bearing Names upon them? U<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">
                     <desc>•…</desc>
                  </gap>to thee I answer. As to the first, know, this City is founded and established up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on the top of all Mountains, for disco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>very unto all: The rising, blazing Glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry of it shall be seen of all People and Nations, and all Languages shall hear of the Fame thereof: Therefore these Gates are set towards the Four Quarters of the Earth, that whatever belongs to this <hi>Sion,</hi> and had its Birth out heuee, may re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turn and give it up to it again. Now as to the Gates themselves, as it is said, <hi>They
<pb n="186" facs="tcp:29869:138"/>
are of One Pearl,</hi> signifying their Orien<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tal Purity, without mixture; as it is written. <hi>My Name shall be ONE in these, and they one in me,</hi> as selected Ones, to be at the Gate's Entrance, to whom I will give the Charge and Trust peculi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>arly to open, and to shut out: for they shall have all Power given to them. The burthen of the Government shall not lie only upon your great High Priest, but ye shall bear an equal share with him, as so many Elders, Spirited from the same Anointing. O<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">

                  </gap> it is a high Dignity to be chosen an Angel-Keeper, and Opener of these Everlasting Gates, to let in, and shut out, according to the Light and Law of this City.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Query.</hi> Now why hast thou seen three Pearl Gates united as in One?</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Answer.</hi> To manifest the Trinity in Unity. All concluded it is to dwell in one Pearl spiced Gate, so spiced through<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out, as it may smell only of pure Deity, that can never more admit of Putrefaction.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Q.</hi> But further you enquire, Why are they named with several Names, seeing all is one only Pearl, or Body of Purity? Why twelve Names answering to the
<pb n="187" facs="tcp:29869:138"/>
twelve Tribes of <hi>Israel,</hi> or to the twelve Apostles of the Lamb?</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>A.</hi> It was only so in way of Similitude, for their many Names are all but one, as deriving their Name from their A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nointed Lord. Who was their Head Principality; according to that which was written, That they were baptized into that One Name, by the Holy Ghost, and from thence were called <hi>Christus,</hi> as a Body, that anew was to present this Assembly in Mount <hi>Sion,</hi> the Bride of the Lamb. Who henceforth will be called by no other Name, then <hi>the Lord our Righteousness;</hi> which is the true In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>scription, that shall be written upon every one of these Gates.</p>

Now for this my Bride, she talked with me in the Night, when Sleep was upon the Elementary part, but my Internal Ear Kept awake to hear new things out of this <hi>Sion</hi> Pearl Ru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by Gate. An out cry I heard, and my self by Name called upon, Arise, shine, for thy Jasper-stone is for thee come: make ready, put off, mount away with me: Let no Essences ever more touch thee, that so my incorporated Spirit may alone

Who according to Knowledge, Light, Joy, Peace, and Love, will, as to thee, my Dove, there live to spend the full Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venue of this unknown, fresh, renew<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing Stock of all out flowing Gifts, and high deified Powers, which will then shew whereunto thou art come.</p>
               <p>In the Morning, when I came to have these Sayings repeated over to me, by that Magical Spirit, who inspired those things into me, I did really feel all my co<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">

                  </gap>poreal Spirits dye and saint within me, and some what to fail, and melt away. While it was thus with me, I had this Word came to me, saying, This must be: therefore suffer, and know now a dying into a Life-rising, and free liberty, within this City, of a God-spreading Glory. Whereof the Throne-River shall be given thee to drink, which is called the Water of Life: as a deep rooted Tree, do thou suck it in, and from hence spring in the Love-Unity, from the Father, and the <hi>Jerusalem</hi> Bride, which generate their Fruit Monthly. I do this Tree not only to thee, but to him, who a Mourner is for his lovely, yet once grieved Bride, recommend:
<pb n="190" facs="tcp:29869:140"/>
To you both I do it present, not only to view, and the Beauty hereof to admire; but for encouragement hereunto, that of the same Fruit ye may bring forth with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in these high Walled Gates. Where the Nations that are to be saved, shall par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>take of these healing Leaves: and more perfect Cures then ever shall be done herefrom. These Trees therefore which I now shew thee, thou art made to be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hold through their various Operations how they remain still together United which though signified in Number <hi>Three,</hi> yet all but <hi>One</hi> are in their rich and high Extracted Quality. Out from which now see your selves shoot forth as incorpora<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted Branches, having living Food in your own Root, which encircled round with <hi>Sion's</hi> broad River, which turned is into a Golden Nature, as of trans<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parent Amber. For such as the Soil is, whereout this Tree doth grow, so an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>swerably doth it give forth its Fruit, for Substance and Quality, for Virtue and Tast. O great and unknown Mystery! Which lieth here, to be both the Tree, and the Feeder thereupon: as knowing here no Curse is ever to be seared, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause nothing but the pure, good, sappy

Life moveth here: which will so per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fectly Naturalize you into it self, as will transform you by constant feeding upon it in your self, into a solid Body, as weigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty as Gold; and so by Degrees it will be known to grow hereunto. This will the whole Course of your unsteady and Sin-obnoxious state, change into flaming Pillars, for fixation. The Spring-Tides of this Healing River will grow so high, that it will be unpassable: no more com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing out is from within these Cherubin-Walls, but growing up as Trees of Righ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teousness, from the Seed and Water-Fountain of Life. Which by and through the Measuring Compass of the Spirit, makes heights, depths, lengths and breadths, all proportionable; to lie square, and to move here in one Equa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lity, permitting nothing out of order. Still the Golden Line, measureth to the highest Perfection in every degree any one, who comes to inhabit within this <hi>Je<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rusalem.</hi> Whose Streets being all of Gold most clear, sure Footing there is for Fire-Stones to walk up and down, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out fear of sinking; for all their Goings are here established, and made prospe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rons.

I know, yea, I know these are your deep Love-arguings; for your Zeal to this my House and City of Glory is very great; so as you would bring down out hence the first ripe Fruits: and I know you are in travel for your Bride-<hi>Jerusalem</hi> to see. All which is most ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceptable to Wisdom's Spirit, who search<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth deeply, and will turn up every Fire-Stone to see what yet lieth under; There<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore thou that plyest so hard the per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect thing it self, for to come to be, I as<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>

For glorified I cannot be, till upon Mount <hi>Sion</hi> my Ransomed Ones, with their Victorious Crowns and Palms do stand free. Oh this is all, I must tell thee, a little time more allowed must be, for the full con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quest to be made; I, even I am come with my Fire, and sifting Fan, till I will not

This is my present work to sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>due and bind all under you: I now a busie, swift and mighty Agent am, for you, who have laid your help upon me, and have charged me with this great thing to bring it to pass for you. Your Hearts and Minds I now require to leave with me, as an empty Tent; for no more a mixed Family shall there dwell. I Wisdom with my own Train will you fill, turning all out, but my own begot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten Fire-sparkling Seed; for with no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing else, can I evermore agree. When this is done, ye cannot, ye shall not live out of this <hi>Sion-</hi>Glory.</p>

               <p>The Word in me from Jesus thus spake. O ye <hi>Jerusalem</hi> Waiters, by what Gate came ye in? and what have you here seen, that ye so willing are here to stay?

None out of this Treasure-City can ever it obtain, for in this <hi>Sion</hi> must all be born again, after many other preceding Births, which fore runs this great and last Trans<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>muting Birth.

For which cause, I have it to thee shewn, that ye might here into enter in; in that, I see your Minds so refined, that ye disdain among Beasts any longer to live and feed. Come, O ye blessed of my Father, who out of these Prison-Walls, and defiled Pastures shall steal and depart away, as who are no more to touch with that, which makes this City from you to shut it self up. I have this 1600 Years expected still Comers up to me, into my Personal Glory here: But few have made their way all clear unto me, not having skill, or known the Art of dying to the Earthly part fully, and to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tally.

               <p>In or about Break-of-Day, I prayed, as the present state of things were shewn me, and matter therefrom given me: I never felt a greater Efflux of Spirit, Power, Joy, and Peace came into me, then did at this season, which opened that Word, and made it known in its Living Witness, saying, Now feel and tast what the Kingdom of God is, it is made to thee a Substantiality, and shall out-flow according to its working Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perty. Henceforth then in Wisdom's Balance weigh and consider every thing you say, that your Words may no more be Naked, but cloathed with the Guardian Power; Which will come to be of great Consequence, as managed in Dove-Simplicity, and shall defeat the Serpent's Subtilty. Who strong Poyson had for thee prepared, but could no way send it in, thy Vessel being with the Antidote Liquor, and juice of Life before-hand filled.

               <p>According as the Living Word, who spake thus by way of Prophecy in me, did further by Similitude present it self, as thus. A Golden Chain in Links was let down, from the high Throne Sphear, where Jesus in the Love-Kingdom reigns. This Chain had a Golden Ball at the end, and the Voice said, Hold fast, if thou wilt come up unto me: if thou shouldst gad abroad with thy Mind or Eye, and let this slip out of thy Hand, then thou wilt be prevented of cohabi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation with me in my Princely Glory. For this is the strong Power of Might, which brings the Bridegroom and the Bride together. Every Link in this Chain hath its proper use and service,
<pb n="204" facs="tcp:29869:147"/>
Wisdom is the great Engineer, which did this contrive for my Spouse and I to meet, and each other to greet. While then in the Heavens I must be contained, this Chain shall descend still, to help up such as are risen out of the dark Night dress of a corruptible Life, into a Body of Light. This Chain is of so high a refined Mettal that it admits of no Hand to lay hold of it, but the pure Lily Hand, which is strong in Faith; who is perswaded, that this Love-Chain is suf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficient to bring one up, after the manner of <hi>Elijah's</hi> Chariot. Who was mighty in Faith, and so brought down this As<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cending Chariot by this Chain of divers Links. But he had first ascended by it, as appeared, being one who had power with God upon all occasions, even to shut and open the Heavens, when he pleases, what else are these Links of draw<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing Powers, but this <hi>Elijah's</hi> Spirit of Prophecy and Prayer, of Faith, perfect Love, Patience, Hope, Weekness, Long<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>suffering, Peaceableness, Temperance, and immutable Perseverance? These are the Link-fastening tyes on your parts. Then that which answers on mine, are these, Light, Greatness of Power, and

Might, Love, Grace, and Good-will, Kindness, Pity, and all Tenderness, without variableness, with the watchful, protecting, and safe-guarding Eye, which shall maintain all this for a sure binding, and a Wedlock-tye, betwixt bright rai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed Spirits and me, till the Great Day of the Visible Marriage shall be Solemnized in the Free <hi>Jerusalem.</hi> Till which hold ye fast, and take good heed, that not one of these Links on your parts be broken: if but from any one of these ye should unlink, ye would fall down by the way, and never to me ascend. But I know that Wisdom is thy Friend, who will not suffer thee to break from me: She is a busie Agent still to spur thee on; her Law of kindness is found to me, <hi>thy Jesus in thy Heart:</hi> which will give an Ascending Might, that so ye may come down again, in a flaming Body of Light. Which is the only design of Wisdom that blessed Engineer; who by these Golden Links draweth you continually nearer to her City.</p>

               <p>THis Morning my Spiritual Informer came, and presented to my view a Book, wherein great and hidden Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crets were writ; telling me here was neither Parable nor Allegory, but the plain Doctrine of the Everlasting Gospel. Into which, it was said, it is given thee to look, for it is an Epistle of good-will, and love to thee, and thy fellow Wai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter; that ye may come to a right and genu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ine understanding of those weighty things, which lay concealed under the Vail of the Letter. The summ of which is the Incarnation, Dying, Rising, As<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cending and Glorifying of thy Jesus. All which being finished in his own Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sonality, I now look to see that all should be actually wrought in you; to which end, I have poured out of my Spirit upon you, which may bring you
<pb n="207" facs="tcp:29869:148"/>
up through all to me. Read then and see in Wisdom's Glass, what is contained in this Book for a further instructing of thee into a Gospel Death, and Rising in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to Victory. Many are the Deaths ye have passed over, and I grant every Death hath brought forth a rising Body, so that ye are come so far, as to bear the very Image of the Heavenly Man, in which the Life-Seed doth spring. But this is not all you are to aspire unto, but you are here to dye with Jesus. For in all those foregoing Deaths, you had not that fellowship as ye shall have with me, when I am grown up in you. For I the Just One, died for the Unjust; so I must Personate this dying again in you, after a <hi>Paradisical</hi> manner, sowing my own pure Grain and Seed into the <hi>Mount Sion</hi> Ground. For as it is said, such as the Seed and Soil is, such a Body in the Resurrection it will be, and such a Body it will produce. And although you come thus to dye in the Lord, I mean in your Lord Jesus Christ, in whom your Life lies safe and inocu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lated, there will be no danger. And while you are sowing here, be not as others without Hope, for indeed you
<pb n="208" facs="tcp:29869:149"/>
sow not that Body, which shall be to the account of a Bare return, as Spirit for Spirit, or Body for Body: For though it was sown a single Seed, yet it shall be various and manifold: though the Seed is sown contemptible, yet it shall rise ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nourable; and though sown as weak, yet it will rise mighty in strength. So mighty, potent, strong, and honourable this Resurrection will be, as it will bring forth the Seed sown, with another man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner of Body, then what hath yet been known. For ye shall know all Blessed<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness indeed, by thus dying into me; fear it not therefore, but valiantly spill your Life, and mingle it with me: then shall ye know a cessation to your own busie-acting Properties. For that Spirit, which dyeth into me, ceaseth to Sio, sweetly sleeping and slumbering in <hi>Sion's</hi> Golden Dust, till I my secret Trump shall sound with the Vial of Life quickening Oyl poured in; which shall make the dead in you to come forth with an unchangeable habit and form of the Holy Ghost, of which I speak. I will after this manner rai<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">

<pb n="209" facs="tcp:29869:149"/>
totally into me, who do promise to thee long here lay buried thou shalt not be.</p>
               <p>This is the Connexion to the former Part.</p>
               <p>Before I the LORD will move again to the finishing of the last glorious My<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stery, the first that can dye thus into me, shall rise as the first Fruits out of me, into a Body Celestial, and mighty Powerful. For my Seed shall never Corruption see: it shall soon rise into a <hi>Mount Sion</hi> Body. Lay but the Ground-work hereunto sure, and ye shall see and feel another Spirit and another Form after this passive Sleep. For after it ye shall awake in that Image, which shall be no more despised; being all compleat, and giving proof of my Resurrection and Life. Oh blessed are they, who can say, that they were dead in me, and are alive evermore, to Reign with me in my Kingdom, waiting for me their Lord from Heaven to bring them thither. For in this new risen Body, I shall not be ashamed of thee, it is so Signatured into the Father's Nature of Purity, that in it thou mayst freely ascend to me. Where I will in the Light Airy Region meet with thee, and bring
<pb n="210" facs="tcp:29869:150"/>
thee through all the Pearly Gates. O come, resign, and dye; know me no more out of this Dying, and Resurrecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on State. Thus Death is not Metapho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rically, but Really the last Enemy that is to be destroyed. Here Sing ye may, that dwell in <hi>Sion's</hi> Golden Mold, and triumphantly Cry. Oh Death, by this Spiritual dying, I am mortally become thy Death, and so swallowed up, as you can nothing of it see. Go, go preach thou this for the Everlasting Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>spel to such as have an Ear to hear it: re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>joyce, and give Glory to God on high. Now when the Hour of this Judgment shall fully come, by ushering in the New <hi>Jerusalem</hi> freedom through the Streets of Nature: This Gospel Ministration, (which is all Love, Grace, Mercy and Peace) by those shall then be proclaim<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, who do partake of this Resurre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction, as the first Fruits. They shall be honoured with this Message, to all those who in this <hi>Noah's</hi> Age are asleep in their dark Prison-Houses. For an Almighty Voice I in you my <hi>Sion-</hi>born Spirits, will utter forth, to call in more to know this Death-Liberty, and Life-Resurrecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, and Ascension into all Fellowships,
<pb n="211" facs="tcp:29869:150"/>
and free Communions with the High Eternity, and Me, the chief Head of all <hi>Sion's</hi> new risen Body. Whereunto be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing come, no other Banner will I display there, but that Love, which casteth out all Bondage and Fear.</p>

For this kind of Death was not so grim, nor terrible to me, as what had formerly passed upon me. Yet somewhat of a Spiritual conflict was awakened in me, and the Powers of my Heavens were at strife about the laying down of this more refined Life. For I found some sharp contest with an oppo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>site Power, who said, What will you further dye, and cease from now, that the perfect thing is sprung in you? Will you have all now of this Holy Nature sink down, and bury it in <hi>Paradisical</hi> Ground? sowing only in Hope, that it will arise a Body, and fair Lily in the Tower of <hi>sion?</hi>
               </p>
               <p>This Objection met my Spirit, as if I were herein to do a superstuous act: but still to Wisdom's Word I adhered. Which followed me all the Day long, bringing a Scripture to me out of <hi>Isa.</hi> 26. <hi>Thy dead Men shall live: together with my dead Body, they shall rise.</hi> Ver. 19.
<pb n="213" facs="tcp:29869:151"/>
                  <hi>Awake, sing ye, that dwell in the Dust.</hi> From hence was shewn me the present sweet fellowship with my Jesus in this his own Body, that is to be our Grave and embalmed Tomb; whereby we are to be so Spieed with his Deified Humanity, as to see no Corruptibility, being called out to empty, and spill our whole Life into him. This being the publick Day of our Meeting, my Spirit was with this new Matter filled: but I quenched and stopped the going forth of it, and spoke out little of this Secret. Which I know would have gone forth with Mighty Powers attending it. But some being there, that would not happily have di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gested this new broached Matter, I did for fear stop it; though it stifled the Breath of Power, and thereby was hurt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful both to my self and to others. Which verified to me that Word, <hi>Quench not the Spirit, despise not Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phecying:</hi> Which I shall henceforth be cautious of, and correspond with ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to my Power, and inspiring Breath. Going afterwards to my Night's Repose, I had a mighty disturbed Sleep, being in a Place, where I saw only the Doctor and my self, where did arise
<pb n="214" facs="tcp:29869:152"/>
out of a burning Lime-Pit, a suffocating Smell, which was so offensive, that I told him, we must make all hast out here, or we should be stifled, such great heaps of Chalk-Stones lay on every side, as we could make but slow Pace out, neither could I see what way to pass by, till on a sudden a Gate opened, and a Person called us to come, and put forth his Hand, <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">
                     <desc>•…</desc>
                  </gap>o help us over those great Stones, that lay in our way; so coming out into a Place, where we met to worship, and praise our God, among our own selected Number. But while we were in our Spiritual Exercise, I saw one amongst us, as a mocking <hi>Ishmaelite,</hi> thrusting out a great pair of Lips, and deriding our Powers: with that I was stirred up in Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit, to go to that Party and give a re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>buke; and they became ashamed thereat, and was Speechless, for I was made to discover their Nakedness. After this I fell asleep, and about Break of Day, I was awakened with these Words, The Trumpet out of <hi>Sion</hi> soundeth, to call forth the Dead in Jesus; awake, awake, ye that sleep in <hi>Sion's</hi> Dust. This Alarm much eased my Spirit, and drew it into an inward waiting; for I know there
<pb n="215" facs="tcp:29869:152"/>
would somewhat follow, if watched thereunto, keeping and abiding in the still Rest, and waiting from under this Altar to be raised, by that Life quicken<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing Spirit, that I do feel stir, and eccho again to my Cry from under the Altar.</p>

I saw nothing but a bare empty Tomb left here, no Jesus was at present to be found. Which brought a damp and heaviness upon me; but mourning in Hope, the Angel that rolled away the Stone, did speak Comfort to me, saying, Though thy Lord, into whom thou didst shed thy choicest Life-Seed, and didst sow all thy Love-Spirit, is now fled from thy sight, and thou art hereat

amazed, be of good cheer: he will not leave thee a restless Seeker here. No sooner were these Words pronounced to me, but I heard another Voice within me sound, saying, Hail, O <hi>Mary,</hi> why dost thou fear? I know, I know thou hast entrusted me with all thy Life-Trea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sury; therefore in great Jeopardy I did see thee, lest I should not again descend unto thee. Then wouldst thou have counted me, as a Thief and Robber, to go away with all thy Life, Spirit, Pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er and Strength, leaving thee void, empty and distressed. But now thou shalt know that I am returned again to thee, to give thee a Resurrection, with my self. For I see thou canst not live without me: therefore Ascend thou shalt in Spirit, to be with me, that thou mayst not only behold me in my Glory, but know thy self also with me, as a Partaker of the same Glory. Only satis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fie thy self that for a time, some Inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vals may be, because of thine Abiding still in an Elementary Body, which may be a Cloud upon thee. But yet as of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten as it is possible, allowing the Cir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cumstances that do attend Corporeity, exhale I will thy Superiour Part and

               <p>Wisdom's Star with its Bright Glance, gave notice to us, where we might come to congratulate the Pure and Wonder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful Birth of our Saving Jesus. Which coming to behold, as the effect of that late preceding Dying into him, from which a Birth so suddainly did spring, and therefrom did witness a most sweet and pleasant Existence, growing from the Life-Tree, which is rooted in the deep rich Soil of the All-Eternity: These were the Glad-tydings, which to my Ears were sounded, with these Words, Come enter into your self, view and see, that the Life-Birth hath wrought out it self God-Man, fully. Great care and charge of this young Plant, you are to take, and to nurse it up with its own Virgin-Milk, and ye must not dare hence<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>forth, ever to lay it to any other Breast, <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">

                  </gap>mmixed Birth is designed to be brought <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">
                     <desc>•…</desc>

<pb n="224" facs="tcp:29869:157"/>
must feed it up, until it be wise, and all knowing, and impregnably strong, and get about it all its defensive Armour. Without which there is no living, where such abounding of Evil is hourly scat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tering their malignant Influences. All former Births have been too weak, to encounter with the strong and subtle <hi>Le<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viathan,</hi> who hath this World so much his Friend, to plunge poor fallen Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rits into his Gins; and no way there is to escape his Wiles, Assaults and Tempta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions, but by entring through this new living Birth-Gate. Which is contracted from that High, Pure, Elementary Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stance; and therefore must always sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sist answerably, upon its own native Food. O let it not seem strange, that this Life-Birth of <hi>Jesus,</hi> is now upon its rising again: it will be defended and protected by the conquering Right of the Mighty <hi>Alpha,</hi> who will have re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gard unto this Kingly Heir, while he is in his Young and Infant state, that he may not be bereaved of his Kingdom. There is no fear of this last high and perfect Birth, to be hereof supplanted; because the Foundation-Seal is upon it, which is the Lord, that quickening,
<pb n="225" facs="tcp:29869:157"/>
growing Life and Spirit, that makes all that is not for it, to fly away before it.</p>

               <p>Now knowing in my self another Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit, acting and moving in this new be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gotten Birth; I was now apt for Phylo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sophick teaching, in the all hidden Magia of Wisdom's Secrets: In which this holy born Thing might attain skill and under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>standing, as being thereunto constituted. For as its Birth is from Mount <hi>Sion,</hi> high great, pure and Spiritual, so must its Learning and Education answer there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>unto. No Tutour, Teacher, or Gover<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour to it must be, but what out of the Royal City, the New <hi>Jerusalem</hi> doth come from thence by God the Father's Commission. Who will new string our Tongues, so as the Stammerer shall speak in that one pure Language, which is only un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derstood by Jesus and the Brotherhood. Oh the Spirit of this New Creature dives deep, and is of a piercing Understand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, and of a quick Ear. Now upon this Birth's opening, and shewing it self,
<pb n="226" facs="tcp:29869:158"/>
as the true <hi>Nazarite,</hi> it was set much upon my Heart, and great awfulness was upon us, who were Witnesses of this rising Birth, how to carry it, and be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>have our selves towards it. So we sought earnestly by Prayer to be dire<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cted in the management thereof, as de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>siring to answer this great Love-Gift, ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to the requiring of the gracious Donour. This was my Morning consi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deration, after which being much kept waking in the Night about it, I fell into a slumber about the Morning, and here was presented unto me a Book open, and a Finger pointing to me to read it, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing very fair and legible. Which I en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gaged my Mind to understand the mean<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of, but it seemed to be written in another Language, then I had yet learn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, and so I could make nothing out of it: But when I awaked, and had wait<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed a while in the interiour Silence, it was said to me, This was the Book of Prophecy, which could not literally be read; but it was given forth for the new living Birth to feed on it, and to be eating it down: and so ye shall feel it be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come a springing Source, bringing forth deep, precious and weighty things;
<pb n="227" facs="tcp:29869:158"/>
After this way and manner the holy Birth shall be disciplined, and thus taught by a secret, intrinsical, mingling and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veying Power, that shall all other Teach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings drown, nullifie, and obliterate. This shall only be of force and autho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity, according as it was with Jesus, who only is to be your Precedent, of whom by way of derision it was said, <hi>How comes this Man to be so understanding and knowing, seeing he never was learned?</hi> He being poorly and meanly Educated, as they judged, and not come up so high in their Form, as to be bred up a Scribe: therefore it was admiration to them, how he came by that Wisdom and Know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge: Which so outvied all, and made them astonished, when they reasoned with him. He brought forth all his Sayings, from this deep central Birth of the holy overshadowing Breath-Power, which issued continually, affording still fresh and new Matter. Now then to you, who have partaken of the same Life and Birth with your <hi>Jesus,</hi> and are come to feel this Word of Life stirring within you, ye are charged to live by this Word, which is the Book of Life incor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>porating it self in you. Mistrust not,
<pb n="228" facs="tcp:29869:159"/>
but you will find enough herefrom to nourish, and strengthen all your Inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal Senses. Expect no less in this Birth of Life, then what was manifest in your Jesus; the same budding Fruits there will be from the same Spirit, as ye grow up in it. Fear not, but the anointing Powers, and Gifts will open and flow, as Antecedents belonging hereunto. And whereas you have desired to know, how you may manure this holy Birth? You are required to bring him into the Temple of the Lord, and there to dedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cate him up in the Covenant of an Ever<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lasting Priesthood. Whose growth will be great and signal in the Courts of Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liness, for evermore.</p>

Your Will-Spirits, who from the high Eternity are tinged, are command<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed to Watch and Ward about it, and to unite entirely with this perfect thing. For it is a Stone out of the <hi>Sion</hi> Rock, that will be your Covering of Strength and Salvation, and the opening of the Store-house of all Blessings to run out freely: It is but natural for you to grow and spring out of this Central Birth, operating from within.

Therefore your only Business is to wait, to take it in, and upon this Holy Altar to pour it; That so hereby, it may become a very strong, sweet, and savoury Meat, to the nourishing of the pure part, which must be one with it, through our being turned into a Golden perfect lump. So solid and stable it must

be, as neither Clay, Iron, Brass or Tinn may or can here penetrate in. No con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary Metals can run into this pure Body, or what is not of its own high extracted Matter. Therefore now this thing consider well, and suffer this Lily Birth alone by it self, to dwell undistur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bed, in the Sacred Temple, till grown out of all Fear and Jeopardy, to the state of Eldership; to which full grown Body and Head, the Crown is made on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly fit.</p>

               <p>
                  <hi>A Vision seen by me in the Night, after my first Sleep.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>I saw one as in a Figure of a sprightly Youth, presenting himself near my Bed<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>side, which amazed me, and I was a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fraid to take knowledge of him, who made out to me, as if he would draw my Aspect to him, but I could not find any Power for Speech with him. This disappearing, another in taller Stature, and more Manly Countenance, drew upon me, seeming to desire Familiarity with me; and then I looked when this Appearance would have spoke, but it
<pb n="234" facs="tcp:29869:162"/>
was passive, and silent, only pleasant in its Countenance, who on a suddain with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>drew. Then again was a presentation of a Person in a middle Stature, comely, sweet, and amiable for attraction; yet I being bounded in my Spirit, was hin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dred: otherwise I could have run with my Spirit into him. After this I was drawn, to consider in my Mind of this threefold Appearance. Then it was thus spoken in me, thou hast Imagically seen the threefold degree of the Imma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culate Life-Birth-Growth, which it must reach in you, who are designed to Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sonate your Jesus in his full grown state here upon the Earth. It is a high Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rogative to attain to all these Degrees; for where is there any in this last Age past, or present, that have seen my an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tient Prophecy made good, which is, that there shall not be in my City and Mountain of Holiness, an old Man, that hath not fulfilled his days; that is, hath not reached to the express De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gree, of me their full grown Head. Many indeed have in my Birth been Quickened, and their outward Figure been extinguished before they have brought forth the Life into visible Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nifestation.
<pb n="235" facs="tcp:29869:162"/>
Others again have attain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed to the Breaking forth, so as that they have seen, and handled the Word of Life, but still in the Infancy of days. Others may have reached so far, as that Youthful state, which was in the first Idea shewn to thee. In which as in a Glass, ye may see your own present state. But oh here you are not to stay, or trifle out your time like Children to play it away; but now putting away all Childish knowledge and understanding, to grow now in every part, from my vigorous Heart's Birth, infusing its strength through you, and growing up to that compleat Structure and Image which is after God, in the Perfection of Holiness. Know ye, that you cannot tell, till you come into the strong Man's state, what ye shall be able to do, work, and act. You will find Power and Might from a full grown Body, to subdue and bring all Creatures and Worlds under: in which will consist the great Sove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>raignty of my Kingdom, that comes in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to none, till they know the second re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>move, into the Young Man's understand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing Degree; through which the World is conquered, as it stands in the Property
<pb n="236" facs="tcp:29869:163"/>
of Sin, and in its enmity to God. Come up my Children dear, let me meet you, growing up in this second Birth Degree, perfect, pure, and clear, then I will ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pear to you in my Last grown state, in my Ghostly Body, which when you see, not only like to me, but that ye be the same with me in it, then ye shall see the days of the Son of Man. For the As<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cending Might is to bring down this Dove flaming Body, Saphire-like. Which is the only defensive Weapon of War, that will make all Spirits stand in awe of you, and the glittering Sword of the Spirit out of my Mouth shall make all your Enemies backward for to fall. By me ye shall trample, and miraculously over them, as ye knit Power with Power, and Might with Might, from this Body of Light, which fed is from the Blood of my Life. You now hereby do see, what the Hope of your Calling is: be hourly exercised herein, work hard in the Fiery Furnace, which is kindled within; out from which you may expect that pure, strong, bodied Spirit will come, which will really translate you into the Mount <hi>Sion</hi> state, with me your beloved Dove-Mate.</p>

               <p>This appeared as I was walking in a green Pasture, with one or two with me only for repass, suddenly within a Bow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>shot there was manifested a pleasant calm Sea, which seeming so near, I said to them with me, Come, let us go and set down by the side of it: where I also saw a heap of Precious Stones, and I heard a Voice say, There is a great Trea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sure, and Valuable Things are there hid. Then I resolved thither to make with all speed, but when I came to set for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward, neither I nor they with me could go; there were such Bogs and Quick<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sands, that none of us durst adventure. For somewhat reflected, and said in me, You cannot go till you be shod with the Golden Sandals: these you must have, before you can set sure footing to go over to this Ocean Sea; therefore stay a while, and provide them, and then you will not sl<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">

<pb n="238" facs="tcp:29869:164"/>
of this Magical Nature, have their certain Effects, which I have ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>served ever since I came under the Dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cipline, of the Word of Wisdom; who hath been my Glassy Eye, to spy out things within that Ocean: and having now from this new subject, matter to exercise my Spiritual Senses, in laying aside the Garment of my outward Sense, which to the Intellectual Understanding is the great Impediment; the Glass which represented these things, became altogether Clear in me, so that in seeing I did see; being divested of all outward Covering. For which Cause, the Spirit of Wisdom doth take advantage, when the External Reason is laid asleep, and the Animal Sense drowned, even then by Internal Idea's to manifest the Objects of the Inward Worlds: Which was God's method for the discovery of his Mind, in foregoing Ages, or by any other way, for the busie working of the Astral Mind of Reason, is the greatest Let to Divine Vision: this I can give witness to. Therefore this Command I often have received, from the Most Holy Inspirator, to unstrip her from her dark Leaden Body; which hath not the

true Organ of Sight. The holy, bright, Aiery Spirit can admit of no such clog; it is like <hi>Saul's</hi> Armour, to the nimble, sprightly <hi>David,</hi> it must be thrown off. For there is for this an absolute necessity for such, as will hold any free Parly, and Conference, with their now glori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fied Jesus, they must come to be in the Spirit, as <hi>John</hi> was, when he in Vision saw and talked with him, who was for that time without any touch, or feeling any weight of his gross Corporeal Senses, for he dyed out of them, as he saith, he was <hi>as one dead,</hi> which made way for the opening of this New World's Scene, and unclasping that Book of <hi>Revelation,</hi> which before was hid and concealed.</p>
               <p>But here riseth an Objection, <hi>Who can fall into such a Trance, and Sleep at any time when they would enjoy such close free manner of Communion with the High Principality of Glory?</hi>
               </p>
               <p>The Eternal Word of Wisdom doth give this Answer to this Query. True it is, that no Natural Person can fall into this Divine and Spiritual Lethargy, so as to still, and quite suspend all operation of the Ratinoal Faculties; for through these,

But where there is an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>other Life Birth introduced, and risen in opposition to this, and that can prove its lawful descent, out from the Eternal Womb of the Virgin-Body: This may take authority, and arise in its Magical Might, and depress the Sensitive Life, that hinders, and clouds, and keeps one back from these Seraphical Sights. Now I say to this pure Essential Thing, begot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten by the Holy Breath, and infused in, let that potent Will, which is free, enter in, and be one with this pure Concep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, then ye will soon master the Contra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riety. If at any time the Starry Birth in you should be unruly, then make use of that precious Stone, which into your Cu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stody is put, that can, and will, if put forth, dash and crumble all into Dust, which shall henceforth, either within thy own Precinct, or without, make at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tempts against this high Birth state: Which grow must still, till it fills with Power every part, to act a Tragedy upon the Serpent, and all his fallen party, that strives so hard, and would have cut off

               <p>I saw again in a Vision, a Stream from this pleasant calm Sea, of which I men<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tioned, that for want of being suitably shod, we could not pass over to it: which gave much Exercise to my Mind there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by, stirring up matter of Enquiry and Intercession to my God, pleading from the Spirit of Jesus, why that Gulph should remain, betwixt this Ocean-Trea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sury and us, Who had now declined, and turned our Faces from all Things Terrestrial, that so we might come to possess what Wisdom's Glass had opened of this Scene of Glory? This being the Matter of my Contemplation, after
<pb n="242" facs="tcp:29869:166"/>
which in the Night, falling into a Tran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sical Sleep, of a suddain I found my self in a Boat, that did run with the greatest swiftness, that neither the Bogs nor Quicksands, which formerly I saw, could stop it. For the Waters from the Sea had risen high over all, bringing me safe and secure to this Sea-shore; where I was to sit down fixed, upon the Moun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain of Precious Stones, there to choose and pick out, what was of greatest value. And when I came to my Spiritual Sense, waiting for the Interpretation of this Vision, it thus spake in me. The Ocean Sea which thou didst see, doth present God the Immense Deity, who contains all full, rich, and weighty Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stance and Treasury: who by no Cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poreal Spirit could ever be reached; for there was a Gulph and Eternal Separa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion between, as this boggy miery Pas<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sage did present, thereunto: But only by <hi>Sion</hi> born Spirits, whom I have seen in the true Sorrow and Mourning, because hereunto they could no Path find, for sure footing, whereby might be attain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed this rich Mine, where all the desi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rable Good doth lie. Now in tender<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness and compassion unto thy sorrowful
<pb n="243" facs="tcp:29869:166"/>
Spirit, this Arm and Stream hath risen, which represents thy Jesus, who from the Ocean-Love of the Immense Deity, doth to thee flow to bring thee back to the Head-Fountain, where thou mayst come to know God the Holy Ghost, covering thee as the Waters do the Sea: till when upon this Jesus fix, who this lovely Mountain of all Precious Substance is. Where be thou sure now to look, turning over every Stone, till thou come to find that only Saphire Stone, which will change gross Mettals, into bright trans<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parent Gold, and shine through dark Bodies a flaming Light. These things presented are to the Eternal Eye so to speculate upon, as thereby thy whole Mind may be transmuted over hereunto, in order to the fulfilling of what in Vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sion thou hast seen.</p>

that possibly we might yet live to see the Day of the Holy Ghost; who out of his Mountain-Treasury is for to come, to put an end to all Sin, and mortal frail Impotencies, under which we do yet groan, looking and hastening for this Perfect Thing to come, which will re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>store us perfectly to our Angelical State. Even so, blessed Dove and Bride break up this in us, who are waiting here upon this Ocean shore, for this new Spring-Tide. Oh let it open upon us wide, and we will not be afraid, though it shall violate us away from all visible Ties, from which we do now see we must be parted and separated. For we can never see thee, till we do withdraw out of gross Corporality, that so cloathed we may be with Jesus, that Celestial Body; who is our Bridal Garment, of which we shall not be ashamed, when God our King shall call us to view, and examine, who the prepared Brides are, for the New <hi>Jerusalem</hi> Marriage, to which we now are summoned.</p>

               <p>This Day upon some occasion mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stred from the outward Astrum of this World's Principle, was stirred up a secret embroil, that for some space of Time I was held out, so as I could find no entrance for my Spirit among the Sera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phick Quire, where my Attendance was required Morning by Morning, to hear and learn, for my further Instruction, in the Eternal Magia: Which I felt as a deep bundle of Life-Treasury beginning to open. But such a wise, subtle, pure, swift Breath or Mist it is, that it shuts up, and does withdraw, so soon as any thing of a Mortal Sense upon it doth fly. It is such a high glance of Magisterium, that it will refine out of all gross, fleshly kinds whatever. No parley with Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ternal matter, this unknown Power will endure, as my dear Inspirator hath anew shewed unto me, and hath given me caution not to prevent its Descending, by mingling the Will-Spirit, who is chosen for its Mare, with any low inferi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>our sense of things, which may grate
<pb n="246" facs="tcp:29869:168"/>
upon it. Whoever comes to be highly Learned in this Philosophical Art, must be trained up from their Spiritual Birth Infancy, and hereupon wait continually for to know. For the Divine Spell is a Mystical Thing, and of that principal weight, as the whole Mind, Will, and Heart, must hereunto be engaged: and all is little enough to turn this Cherubim Wheel of the Magia still about. For which you must after the manner of a Spiritual grown Body, labour hard, till ye have the Mystery of this Art fully at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tained. It is beyond all things, that ever yet was named. Therefore strive hard for it: but ye who are yet but young in this Art, may be ignorant, what kind of Stock you are to work upon; know then to thee this Mystical thing I will reveal, that thou mayest not the Nature hereof Mistake. It is an Im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>material Nothing, and yet giveth Being and Existency to All things; moving and piercing through the whole Body of the Creation, yet not discerned; generating all things anew, through a Virtual Life quickening Breath: this comes in and goeth forth without Sound and Noise. It is communicable only to such, as have
<pb n="247" facs="tcp:29869:168"/>
covenanted, and firmly bound them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves, to be made by it Wise, Subtle, Pure, Spiritual, Discerning also in all Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>limities: whereby proof may be given what Magical Coals of Fire are kindled, that ye may scatter and make to fly, as di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rected by Wisdom's Eye. Of this ye may know yet more deeply, as ye from this Holy Root still weed out all light and scruffy matter.</p>

This in way of Vision was given to espy; and immediately after, this Transient Sight passed away, and that Scripture opened upon me, <hi>Isa.</hi> 40. in these words, <hi>The Lord shall be to thee an Everlasting Light.</hi>

What or who shall be able to live, and walk in such a Firmament of Light, where there will be no Intervenings of any shade of Night? Know then there is such a holy conceived high-born Being which yet is clouded under inferiour Lights, and subjected to them for some Season; till it hath accomplished the first working Properties of the Seven Days Creation. Wherein Day and Night must by their Proper, Sun and Moon be governed, and all transacted according to the motion of the Planets, the Out.

For the evil corrupted Birth of Life, had sent up such Fumes, and Unsavoury Incense, as must needs darken the first Heavens and Earth, that away they must flee before the New Foundation-City ye can enter into. Therefore to thee, let it not seem harsh or terrible, that an end of all things, which came in through Morta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lity of Time, is determined: for abso<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lutely despoiled of all false, glittering

Which I well experience, is not to be given over until the end of
<pb n="254" facs="tcp:29869:172"/>
the growth. For when all in our Field shall white unto the Harvest be, then the Sickle or Sword of the Spirit co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>meth forth, to reap and gather us into the Everlasting Store-house, under the Care and Custody of our Fore-runner JESUS. From whom I had about this time many Calls, and Cautions, to strike up the Sail of Faith, and to watch against all those subtil Spirits, which would break in to cancell the Seals there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of, which are the Evidence of what is not at present seen, or yet come to be en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>joyed. Moreover it was shewn me the Danger that we were in this Particular liable to, through the least crack or breach upon our Faith's Seal; By which alone the Magia worketh, and raiseth Powers from that Original Might. Up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on which Center there is yet such a strong Inclosure as no Creaturely Being can break open; because its Signature is compounded and made up of all con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary Properties, degenerating wholly from this mighty Engineer of Faith; which worketh all through, and in, the Central Fire of Love. O who can here work till fully uncloathed of the gross cloathing of the Animal Sensitive Life,
<pb n="255" facs="tcp:29869:172"/>
so as to reach to this Original Wisdom and Might, which was existent in the first Paradisical <hi>Adam;</hi> who lost it by the Sin entering in, and can only be regained again, through the extinguishment of it, and the Dying out therefrom Totally. Which gives a full Answer to those Ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jections, which so pestered my Mind, and which I Recorded in Writing <hi>June</hi> the 5th. receiving Satisfaction now again herein, upon a fresh waiting and inqui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry.

               <p>This having Opened during a Remove of the Doctor from the Author, was not found in his Copy.

First Breath then take, and saint not, but forward to the Mount of <hi>Olives</hi> go: the Mountain is indeed high, to which you are to ascend, but my holy Gales shall drive you on, that so you may come thither to sup with the Lamb.</p>

               <p>THis Morning after some private Ejaculations to the Throne Maje<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sty, this Word came unto me, Will ye actually deny your Active Life, as you denyed passively your passive Life? Even that Life, which ye so often have decryed down, because it is found in that room, from whence proceeds all Unbelief, and Deceiveableness of Unrighteousness, which naturally generateth those Es<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sences; from whence the Thoughts that are light and evil do spring. The great conquest will be to put a stop to these, till thou hast found the way utterly to undermine, and for ever to bind them. Yet thou shalt be allowed, war<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ranted, and justified, to stifle them, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore they can come to a Birth. Though Reason may tell thee, this would be as a new Entity, and that it would straitway overturn, and overthrow thy breathing Existency; yet give thou not any ear to such Objections that are cast in from that Principle; perhaps then no more
<pb n="259" facs="tcp:29869:174"/>
in a Creaturely Being thou canst be known. Well, admit it, and suffer thy Creaturely Self thus far for to expire, as to the imaginary Life, be assured that all Peace and Safety hereby will accrue. For by this silent Vacancy, another Source will open. All dyings thou hast indeed gone through to this, which is the main Head-Vein, which doth lie so deep under Ground, thereby preserving under it self hidden even from the Vultur's Eye. Oh this Original Root is that which must be struck at: Up, and Out with it, and overturn it, and thou wilt see what doth lie in the depth beneath it, to wit, every precious thing; which without care or toil, will voluntarily spring, when this imaginary Root is quite cast out. For the croppings of this Evil Seed will never free thy inward Ground. Come then and descend with me, and I will shew thee where this Grand Enemy doth lurk, who uncon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceivably doth send forth those dark Fumes, which hath hitherto prevented the overflowing Breath of the Holy Ghost. If then thou canst not to a cessa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion from every unruly motion come, which works from the Astral Spirit, then
<pb n="260" facs="tcp:29869:175"/>
try the Power and Might of that Spirit, which in thee doth reside, and cross these strong Tides, and through all break, and leave behind the Flowings of <hi>Jordan,</hi> and look not back, but forward do thou pursue, and keep up to thy Region high, and as an Eagle Spirit bear up most mightily, no more returning to take up any weight of earthly stuff, which in the Imaginary Mind doth lie. But away, away, ascend with thy Jesus unto an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>other Principality; where other Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sentations will all thy Senses employ, when once thou hast forgot, and lost this World, out of thy Eye and Heart. What other meaning dost thou think those Words do bear, which are upon old Records, which saith, Except ye deny, relinquish, and suffer the loss of that Life, which is bundled up, tied, and knit together with the stringing Sinnews of the imagi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nary Mind, ye cannot enter into Life, into the Life of God and Christ; which to know, is Life Eternal. Therefore it is again said, That none can receive the Kingdom of God, till they can come to be as a little Child, that is new born, who is passive, having no thoughts of relu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctancy working, to hinder the opening
<pb n="261" facs="tcp:29869:175"/>
the Everlasting Kingdom of the Light, Joy, Love, Power and Peace. Wouldst thou know why so few have got en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trance here? It is, because they could not untwist, nor get from under this binding Cord of the Natural flowing Cogitations, which beset the Spirit every way, holding it under a most sla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vish Captivity. Yet is it not perceived; but by most it is believed, that this whirl<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing Wheel must run round of absolute necessity, and there is no way for it to be avoided, while subsisting in a Body of Elementary Corporality. True, O Spirit, those who in this gross state only care to be, do walk and abide with, and amongst those, which are of their own likeness; relishing and corresponding with what doth proceed from this unsa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vory part. But from you, I your Lord, expect another thing, who have taken the Vow of a <hi>Nazarite's</hi> Life upon you, invocating me so often, for a remove, and translation, into the same Life and Liber<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty with me your forerunning President, Now then, I must plainly make known to you the Mind of God and your Father, which is to Famish all those numerous and multiplying Essences, which mutiny
<pb n="262" facs="tcp:29869:176"/>
against the Eternal Stillness and Eternal Nothingness, where the all sublime Goodness, and Everlasting Rock of Power, is to be seen, felt, and known. Verily this is the way, I can only describe to thee, and those, who the mark of this high Calling would reach, and would be traffickers within the Holy City, which is all Crystalline. Through which none can pass, that hath the least Lumber of imaginary stuff yet hanging upon him. Now weigh these Sayings, for they are from the Yea, and Amen, who hath good-will to make riddance of all those superfluous Thoughts, that have been as the gulph separating Prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciple. To which thoughts by one act, God moving in the Mystery of the <hi>Fiat,</hi> yet once again, will put an end quite to them. For a New Heart will be created, out of which will flow continually such a choice Treasury, answering to the Sight of the Flaming Eye.</p>

               <p>This Morning as I was in my Spirit, let down into the deep Abyss, attend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the pure Openings, from that Cen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tral generating Source or Fountain Life; In a moment there appeared to me an Azure blue Firmament, so Oriental as nothing of this, in this Visible Orb could parallel with it. Out of the midst hereof was a most wonderful Eye, which I saw Sparkling, as with Flaming Streams from it. Which I am not able to Figure out, after that manner, in which it did present it self unto me. But according to this Form it was, as much as I am able to give an account of it, it was thus, or after this manner. There was a Flaming <hi>Eye</hi> in the midst of a Circle, and round about it a Rainbow with all variety of Colours, and beyond the Rainbow in the Firmament, innume<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rable Stars all attending this Flaming Eye. From which the Word said, the Earth
<pb n="264" facs="tcp:29869:177"/>
and Heavens shall flye, and nothing a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bide, but what can live in this Eternal Eye, as ministring Stars of Glory, before the Throne of him: who like to this Cir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cling Eye, which thou hast seen, hath neither Beginning or End.</p>

               <p>This Vision of the Flaming Eye is gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven for to see, that which is worth pon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dering for thy pure Mind continually. For glorious Idea's will multiply, that hereupon all thy Senses may be employ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, in such sweet Rarifiedness, wherein there is no danger of Excess. While this Vein from the Heart of God in thee doth run, it will feed that which doth come from the pure Font, and hereby stop the running issue of the Imaginary part. Which I will assure thee will compleat the Victory, because it strikes at Sin's Origi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nality, which had its beginning from the
<pb n="266" facs="tcp:29869:178"/>
Conceptive part of the Heart, there it came it, and there it must be banished out. Then it will be a New Heart, in which the Flaming Eye will fix; Which in Vision thou didst see, with its innu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>merable Stars in the Firmament, which are generated from this Globe-Eye, so un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>merously will holy and pure Cogitations from hence arise, and so habitual strong and forceable, as to out-pass all strange Essences, that would come therein again to lodge. Therefore within this Cir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cling do ye abide, that so you may keep out all evil Motions, which the Serpent knows are the Foundation-matter of his Kingdom, and will sting you with them, if ye do not fully exclude them. Which ye no way can, till ye hasten away, and with your Spirit fly to this bright Fir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mament, where this Eye all Dangers will for you espy, and know all secret My<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>steries, making you wise in that one great needful thing; which will make all strait, that crooked and out of the way is. For such is the property of this Fire piercing Eye, that it will look through the Host of the whirling Ima<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginations, and put them to a stop, that so they may not persue, as to overtake
<pb n="267" facs="tcp:29869:178"/>
those that are upon Faith's flying Ban<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner: on which keep, till it hath brought you within <hi>Zion</hi>'s Gates.</p>
               <p>This great and weighty thing concern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing Cessation and Annihilation of all fruitless Imaginations was still the Call within me, to come into the Believing Rest, for that this was the true dying into Jesus; which passive Life is the pure Mother, out from which the Birth of the God-acting-Life is to be expected. For the Faith of the co-operating Power worketh here all in all. The New Heart being replenished with ministring Powers suitable hereunto, that will perfectly bring things to pass, as the Mystery is moved in its own Sphear, dri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving on by the mighty force of this Birth of Faith. Which produceth great and marvellous things, according to the sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lime Nature of it. For it hath no other ground to go upon, but the absolute Co-eternal Deified Will, which Will willeth in the New created <hi>Heart</hi> as in its own Royal Seat.</p>

               <p>This Morning I was in great Heart<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>searchings about this precious Lily of Faith, if I could by the sight reflecting from the Eternal Eye, it any where espy. Querying thus with my Lord Jesus, Ah Lord, if the right Plant be in me, as it was found in thee, why doth it not act forth? Where are the Signs which should follow, as the Seal of Believing? What makes the Birth of it stick thus long, whose going forth must make way for the Holy Ghost? Tell me, Oh thou inspiring Word, why hath it had a Name to live, and yet hath been as dead? For it hath not been Justified by such mighty Heroick Works as in the foregoing Ages did bear witness to it. And this hath made it as a Body without a Spirit, actless and fruitless. Thus I earnestly expostulated, that if we had it existing in us, then we might have skill to use and manage it, for the reviving of this worthy and unknown thing, which hath been a Stranger in the Earth, but is now a stirring in our Heavens, and a turn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
<pb n="269" facs="tcp:29869:179"/>
up the Mould, that hath from our Eye this all-precious Grain hid. Where then doth it lie? (said the blessed <hi>Alpha</hi> to me) thou hast to the heights for it as<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cended, and for it hast sounded into the Depths, but thy Aim hath been too <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">

                  </gap>ort to reach it, and thy Eye too dim for to espy it, though it is so nigh: Yet not known to any, till they do re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain the bright glance of the Flaming Eye, which hath not only the specious Faculty, but the streaming Power of Might, to bring back again this worthy Champion, that hath been by the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bining Powers of Reason put unto flight. Which so soon as Tydings come, that they are dead, who so wickedly have conspired against Faith's life, then it will return again and appear on the Earth mighty and supream, to open the Door, for the Holy Ghost to enter in. Then this Mystery of Faith will be fi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nished: To which ye are directed, that by contending for it, ye may obtain it unto Victory.</p>

And I saw, as a Confirmation hereof, a Flying Banner, passing swiftly by, as a Trophy of Faith's Victory. Which each one must bear, before the Day in which the Holy Power will shower upon us, till which in one Spirit of Faith we were directed to wait together. After which also a Word run through me, There is need enough to provoke each other here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>unto. For the Day is now nearer, then when first ye did set upon this Believing. Oh now let us go through, that we may reach to all the Degrees of Faith, which will assuredly make up our fallen Breach. For this is the Power that will make us all whole, as the true Weapon-Salve, which is anointed by the Hand of our dear Jesus, to smooth and make ready
<pb n="271" facs="tcp:29869:180"/>
for the Flying Banner of the Holy Power, for to descend into us, who in this Faith do wait, within the secret Gate of the New <hi>Jerusalem</hi> state: where into by no means must we bring any Spirit that may make mutiny, for to break the holy League, which must be still maintained with him, who is the Covenant. Who hereby reneweth our Peace, and Joy, in believing without annoy or staggering; which hinders the purchase of the Field, where the Pearl is found, which Field is called Faith's Eternal Ground.</p>

in such ascending strong Center-Raptures and Powers coming down, that yet the Gulph was not shot through?

My Spirit took all boldness to know why it should be so fruitless in its Mediatorship now, over what it was in foregoing times, when Prayer of Faith was, as a ready Messen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger, to fetch in whatever was wanting. I did lay hard upon the Mighty One, using the same Arguments, as <hi>Dalilah</hi> did with her <hi>Sampson,</hi> how, O my Jesus, can it be, that thou dost love me, without thou shewest me a<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">

For I desire, I seek, I look only after this, to be uni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted to the Lock of thy Power, and
<pb n="273" facs="tcp:29869:181"/>
Might, as a springing Plant from thy Godhead. Which will give me all Power to answer to the present state re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quiring, which is made up of nothing, but Sin and Self original, and Ill Conse<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quences bundled up into innume<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rable Grievances. So that verily I did see the whole visible fallen part of things all putrified, unsound, unstable, weak, low, and poorly spirited: therefore out of this deep sence, I could not but cry, Help, Oh help thou mighty Prince and Saviour nigh. For who do see them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves lie in this <hi>Golgotha</hi> state, but are willing to take the Wing of the Everlast<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing Morning, and herefrom fly to the Rock that hath the Clifts of Muni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, to hide all that are weary of this loathed Place? Therefore with unutter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able Sighs, and Requests, I did this our deplorable, and defective state, beseech my Jesus to read over, and to take away the Reproach thereof. For I argued with him, that if thus Indigent we should still be, it would sure reflect upon the Lord our New Covenant-Resto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rer, who nothing was to leave short or imperfect in those, for whom he became an Undertaker to his Father, to bring
<pb n="274" facs="tcp:29869:182"/>
them back again. After all this on my part, by way of Spiritual Parley, this Word came unto me, saying, Arise, arise yet, and wait; Why art thou jea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lous, that Love is wanting, or the Arm of my Power abated, because I do not tell thee where the hiding of this Lock of Strength is? I know, I know thy sore Longings of it for to partake with me, that it might free thee from the fallen state: Which is in such Shame and De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rision, that thou canst not lift up thy Head with any Confidence, because the Ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cursed Thing is every where in and about this lower Sphear; where thy abode is yet for to be, in Temptation and Fear: but faint not, thy Bridegroom is near, who will the Shield of Faith anoint with the Oyl of the Holy Ghost, which will be Joy unspeakable, and full of Glory, after all thy heaviness. The reason why thy Praying, as to matters of so high a Consequence, hath wrought so little, is because Faith hath been so dry, for want of the pouring out from on High the Golden Streams out of the Oily Foun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain, of the one pure Deity, which would make all Prayer mighty and ope<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rative,
<pb n="275" facs="tcp:29869:182"/>
when this Balsamick Oyl doth slow from the Fountain-Head.</p>

               <p>As my Spirit was Contemplating, af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter some Breathings forth in Prayer, these Words came to me, To love the Lord thy God, with all thy Heart, is more then all Burnt-Offerings and Sacrifices; this is that which I prefer above all, and to which I do look to in all that draw near to me with Love unfeigned, and with a whole Heart transmitted over to me, and no part kept back from him that calls for Incorporation of Hearts. That so there may be but one Heart of Purity, as with thy Jesus in his Humanity. This Love is the Box of Spikenard opening therefrom, whence thy God smell<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth the sweet savour, from which the Curse flyeth, and will be no more found to hurt, blast, or destroy the spring<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing Vine about the Walls of thy Mind: From which the Wine of the Kingdom will flow to refresh the Heart, then shall you find you are not far from the King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom,
<pb n="276" facs="tcp:29869:183"/>
that consisteth in Love, Joy, and Peace.</p>
               <p>Then followed upon this, that Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture about the Ark, being sent away by the <hi>Philistines.</hi> It was shewed me, it would not abide with the uncircum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cised in Spirit, but <hi>Dagon</hi> would be smitten, and fall before it. For in con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trariety, the Wrath-Vial opened, and though the <hi>Philistines</hi> thought they had got the Blessing, in regard they had heard and known what Victories and Salvations it had wrought, yet it became a Curse, where they held it in Unrigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teousness, and in an unhallowed impure Temple, setting up other Gods equal and jointly with it; which by no means would be endured. God will be All, or nothing at all: to such as would re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain his Ark-presence, in the mixed un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sanctified Mind, there is nothing but Gall and Wormwood to be found, instead of Sweetness. The Ministration therefore that shall be afoot on Earth, must be all upon a New Bottom, which is figured out by that new Cart that the Ark was put into, which represents a new Heart, in which the immaculate presence of the Lamb will be retained. No unconse<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crated
<pb n="277" facs="tcp:29869:183"/>
                  <hi>Uzzah</hi> must take hold thereof, but only the Hand of Faith, and the Flaming Spirit of Love that yoaked are together, as strong and able, without more ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dition of help, to bring this to its own place, within the Vail and Tabernacle, where its Rest is to be. For the All-seeing driving Power is with these two Kine, upon whom no breach shall be, as formerly, when the rash <hi>Bethshemites</hi> that were not purified, looked into it.</p>

               <p>Again, this Word came to me from the Lord, Up, stay not here: the Ark, though in the House of <hi>Obed-Edom,</hi> that is, in a <hi>Nazarite</hi> Heart, yea, here the Blessing is not ever to rest and abide, but it must move forward; for there is yet much Land to be possessed, which only the Eye within the Ark can spy. Therefore be sure still to enquire at it, who can tell you where the most pleasant Situations are: for to some the Lot may fall out to possess a more rich and fruit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful Soil than another shall, according to the donation of Royal Favour; which
<pb n="278" facs="tcp:29869:184"/>
in all Ages advanceth to Spiritual Dig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity, according to the determination of Divine Will. Oh it is worth seeking, to be enlarged with the Borders of these Everlasting Habitations, to possess the ut<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>most Bounds hereof, which is a <hi>Joseph's</hi> Blessing: Who as thou mayest read in the History, <hi>Joshua</hi> 17. 15. grew so strong and great, that they would not be contented with one Lot, though they had <hi>Beth-horan</hi> the Upper, and <hi>Beth-horan</hi> the Neather, which was indeed a fruitful Soil: yet they pitched forward for the Mountain or Forrest-Trees, which they by greatness of Power ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tained above their fellow Brethren. So now as thou growest strong, and en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>creasest in People, that is to multiply till thou comest to be of mighty force in Spiritual Powers, to encounter with them, who would keep thee out of the Land of Blessing; thou must come to Enlarge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment to the very utmost Bounds of the Everlasting Hills and Mountains. And as there are seven Nations to War against and cast out, to answer to these, thou mayest need the Seven Throne-Spirits, which will multiply within thy Ark to an unconquerable Strength, that so all
<pb n="279" facs="tcp:29869:184"/>
Enemies will be chased and made to fly from before this sevenfold Eye. Which shall be thy Guide, to see every way to bring thee up to the <hi>South Land,</hi> within the Borders of the high Eternity. There<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore gird up, for as I was with <hi>Moses,</hi> so I will not fail to be with that <hi>Joshua,</hi> who within thee is the Ark of the Al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mighty Strength, that will go before thee. For as the Father was with me, so I will be with you in this present Warfa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring state.</p>
               <p>This Word mightily raised my Spirit up, for it confirmed what went before, as to the going on to possess, what was yet behind. For when we grow so nigh the Kingdom, as to come to the matter of Possession, then <hi>Joshuah</hi> must arise in the greatness of his Might, to fight the Battels for us. For the great and strong Nations will come out with great fury against us, because they see they must have no share in our Lot, but be totally cast out.</p>
               <p>Question. <hi>Now in this great and last Battel-Engagement, What will be requi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red of us in order to Conquest?</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Answ.</hi> It was shewn me, that the ri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sing Spirit of Faith in our <hi>Jesus,</hi> as an
<pb n="280" facs="tcp:29869:185"/>
incorporating Power in us, must go forth with the self same Word of Command, that it did in <hi>Joshuah</hi>'s time to command the Sun to stand still, and the Moon to stop; that the first should not go down, nor withdraw its shining Strength, neither the latter its meek, watry Brightness. For by the Light of this renewed Day, where no Night can come to intervene all dark Reasonings, Doubtings, and Fears are expelled, by the Majestick Light of Faith. How easie is it, I do see to wage War in the Light of this Eternal Day, and then quite to over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come, and get the mastery, and to sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>due the five Kings: Which were pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sented to me, as those five Senses,</p>
               <l>Which are all armed for the Fight,</l>
               <l>To maintain their Sensitive Right.</l>
               <p>But so long as the Bow of Faith is in the Hand of our Jesus, we need not fear; for he hath said, He will make bare his Arm for us; therefore we need not fear any of their Weapons of Cruelty. Let us now couragiously War and Work while it is Day, and the <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">

with and among the rest of the Conquering Worthies. In the Name of <hi>Joshuah,</hi> the <hi>Jesus</hi> which is with us, let us move forward, for <hi>Jehovah's</hi> Banner goeth flying before us, till it shall bring us to <hi>Shiloh,</hi> where the Lots shall be cast for us, and we rest in them for ever, according to the description of our Star, Leader, and Seer: Even so <hi>Amen,</hi> dear Jesus.</p>

Therefore be apt, wise and diligent now to every Rule, which shall be revealed unto you, who have chosen the same <hi>Calling</hi> with me, and you may know Effects answerbly.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>The first Rule.</hi> You are called out of this Babylonish Country, into the Land of <hi>Immanuel,</hi> where in the first place you are to learn the Language of that Country, among the Divine Magicians and Spiritual Natives there: and then in the next place to understand the Manu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>factory, how to deal and traffick in that high Merchandize of the Pearl of the Kingdom, with all the Precious Stones

For it is Expedient that you should be made skilful in, and understand all these weighty Things, that may be serviceable to your self, and those that are in the same Calling and Vocation united with you. And I would not have you, af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter the Manner of the World, to go on Trust, upon anothers Talent, but to Im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prove your own, which I have commit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted to you.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>The third Rule.</hi> Seeing now your JESUS hath furnished you with a good Stock, the Golden Mine being set open to you, you may Adventure to Buy, and to lay up in Store as a true <hi>Joseph,</hi> the sevenfold Increase of the Corn of Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven; that in all times of Famine, may replenish thee with all the Heavenly Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mily, that in this High Calling numbred with thee shall be.</p>

                  <hi>The fourth Rule.</hi> Now further on thou must proceed, till thou reach to a larger Patrimony yet, which is to Ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venture upon that Vinyeard, which en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>closed is with Love's Flaming Wall, where the Red Wine doth flow out of the Grape. For this also thy Purchase must be: Vessels prepare thou not a few, for it will run, till thou canst no more find to bring.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>The fifth Rule.</hi> Now all this Treasury Imbarked must be, and quick Sail upon the Floating Sea, which is the pure Love-Deity, must have: and here fear not to be robbed by any Pirate, while I your Pilot shall present with you be, to Land you safe upon your Spiritual Goods here, and taking New Lading in, to make still fresh Returns, for the Uni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>versal Profit and Benefit, to all those that have Dependency, and Need of such Relief.</p>

               <p>I did hear from the Angelical World great and mighty Sounds round about me, with one distinct Word, saying, Behold him, who descends upon the White Throne. Who are there ready with their Garments washed clean and white, thus to meet their Jesus.

               <p>The Reply was this, Oh fear not; re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>member how <hi>Joshuah's</hi> filthy Garments were taken off, and then he could stand before me; even so it is decreed; and an express Charge is given to your Gu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ardian Angel, to uncloath and pluck off your Purple Robe of Sin, Ignominy and Scorn. For there is yet reserved one principal White Robe, which yet was

As for your Spiritual Adversaries, whom I see so vigilant, they shall never tire out that Spirit of Faith; which shall be animated still by that Word that riseth fresh and new.

               <p>This Word came, which was often repeated in me, Arise <hi>Jonah's</hi> Gourd must fail, though it was appointed for your succour and shelter, for its ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pointed Season, as a Shadow from the
<pb n="305" facs="tcp:29869:198"/>
Heat, Wind and Storm. Which was thus made out to me, with respect to the present Gospel-Ministration, as it stood in divers Services, though of the Lord's own Institution, which carries a great force with it, consisting of pure, and Spiritual Exercises, offering up by Pray<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers and other constant Oblations, which have been too short, because transient Powers have only opened therefrom, wherein hath been some Refreshing: yet rest not hear, for some better thing is provided for you, whose expectation must still run higher, looking to obtain that fixed Body, that can dwell among the Heavenly Quire, going out and in, by Commission from your Great King, whom only you are to fear and hasten to.</p>
               <p>Then again this secret Word sprung, What toil you here? Have you not heard, that there is a Jubile Year, wherein you are called to return to the Land of your Possession, to enjoy what is laid up in store, which was sown in the sixth Year of your <hi>Immanuel,</hi> who was such a fruitful Grain, as thereby ye may obtain a Sabbath of Rest, eating of

the old Store, till the third Year, which will renew all things again to that In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crease which never yet hath been.</p>
               <p>Also, this Scripture was spoken to me, Ye shall not go through the Cities of <hi>Israel,</hi> till the Son of Man come again, <hi>Matth.</hi> 10. 23.

               <p>Also, this Word came unto me, The Golden Pot within shall still be filled with Manna: it is for the Priest alone to feed thereof, within the Holy Place.

In order to the prosecution thereof, this Word came to me, Know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>est thou not, that the most principal City, is yet to be inhabited by you, which can only be entred upon by Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quest: Now what less, then the Spirit of Courage, Might, and Valour, which did rest upon <hi>Othniel</hi> will serve you in this matter?

not but he shall still overcome: to whom is given the utmost Ends of the Earth for his Inheritance, <hi>Moab</hi> shall be his Wash-Pot, and over <hi>Edom</hi> the Most High will rule. Oh Lord, it is most true, thy Power and Soveraignty is not to be questioned, I know, thou canst do all things; but what is this to me; till this Mighty Man of Valour do arise, to bring me into this strong City, or the City of Strength, wherein will be all our defence? Thou hast said, Go on to possess what yet remains behind, pointing to this Walled Place, that is fenced round with Bull works; by which we, who have often made any Attempts against her here, have as often been repelled. How, and by whom can we make this Enterprize, if thou, Oh mighty <hi>Othniel,</hi> dost not undertake this for us? A necessity there is, I do see, for thee to assume, and to take in us the strong Battel-Ax of Faith's Magnanimity, that will force the most Mighty to yield.

               <p>Oh why should ye hearken to any thing, that would quench and kill your Faith. For Diffidence hath been the grand Stop and Hinderance: for how can that possibly be obtained, which cannot be believed in?

Which stands free to yield to them, who through Faith's Stratagem can enter through the Gates of this <hi>Jerusalem.</hi> You well know what force will be effectual, which I still incite, and call upon you to improve, summoning in all your Army. The Seven Throne-Spirits will be your aid, but be sure to set Love's Flaming Streamer, and Faith's challenging Banner in the fore-front of all, because they are of greatest Potency: which will bring a dread with them upon the fearful and unbelieving Spirits, because terrible to them is this Army of Banners.

               <p>This Word visited me with a mighty inward Cry, Let the old Creature dye and pass away. Bury this Dead out of sight, that it may dissolve into the New Earth, which I have prepared. From whence ye may expect, that new Crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turely Body, which is all available, and goeth beyond the first Fruits of Circum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cision. For Renovation in the Mind may be brought forth, and yet this New Creature not raised, which is the very Body appertaining to the Ghostly Spirit, which can only mount, and give this New Creature the Wing of Ascension. Here is a new creating Word, which now upon the Sounding is: what excellent new framed Piecemay be expected hence from its Matter and Composition? What think you now must this New Creature be made of, that it may transcend the Old? That must dry, moulder, and vanish away, as it is de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>creed: that so room may be for the new Body to take place. Which is to be co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>agulated from the Virtual Golden
<pb n="312" facs="tcp:29869:202"/>
Mould, as the material Matter of this All-Spiritual Creature, which is appoint<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed for Mount <hi>Sion's</hi> Communion. Oh! the first <hi>Adam</hi> was created for Paradise: out of the Dust of that Earth, he was made a living understanding Soul, sparkling in the pure Innocency. From which de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>generating he hath changed both the inward Principle, and outward Body, into the Nature of Sin and Corruptibi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lity. Which now must be put off, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore the most Holy will know you in the way of delightful Conversation; for which end every Trumpet doth sound, till ye be framed and raised out of Holy Ground, made all of one entire Piece, a Massy Lump, which may out-ballance that, which as a Shrine adulterated is, with other false Metals: as in the first <hi>Adam's</hi> state you have seen, where the Good and Evil do dwell, that makes all the Strife and Uneasiness. For which, no other way is found, for the putting an End thereunto, but by a total dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>solving of the old Creature, wherein this Mixed thing is found.</p>
               <p>Here arose this Objection in me, <hi>Ah my Lord and Master, I grant and ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quiesce with thee, concerning this new
<pb n="313" facs="tcp:29869:202"/>
Bodifying, for the Eternal Spirit to act through, in pure new raised Humanity, but why is thy Word still directed to me, who find hereunto no Sufficiency: for it is the business of a God-creating Power, I do see, as thou dost take this Prerogative unto thy self, saying, Rejoice in that which I do create?</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Answ.</hi> True, Oh <hi>Shunamite,</hi> this Glory thy Father only appropriated un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to himself, and none else can assume it, or counterfeit it; For here are no painted Forms that can serve; for to make Images without Life will not do. Hereby shall the face of the Covering be discerned, that hath deceived all Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions, that have still cryed the Temple-Body, when it is no other but a dead piece of Formality, which is at least no way able to effect beyond the Species of a poor piece of impotent Mortality, which under great disability doth lie. Therefore the Voice in thee doth Cry, Call, and Incite, that thou mayst look within for this Creating Might. Lo, it is not so lost or gone out of Sight, but it will be found upon search and seeking, being at hand to renew and change the Vile, and bring forth another Body and
<pb n="314" facs="tcp:29869:203"/>
Spirit, that may God's Virgin-Bride in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>herit, with all her Mountain <hi>Arabian</hi> spicy Wine, which is refined from the Lees. That is the Spirit, which is pure<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly extracted from the Deity, to move in a Body that is all contacted of <hi>Sion's</hi> Mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter: For the New Creation will be filled with such Inhabitants, as mighty Princes, each one in their own Power moving, with such anointed Shields, as all Earth<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly Weapons will be too blunt, and too short to annoy such Spirits, or new Crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turely Bodies, that are compacted of this sublime matter. But here this Jesus, whose Spirit searcheth the inward deep of this Soul meeteth with somewhat, which is still questioning and asking, How can this great thing be? seeing I am not come to live out of sensible Mortality, that is touched with every Essence, which appeareth from that ground, sometime listed up, then again cast down, according to the mutation of the Starry Region. Well, I know, (saith he) it is so, but art thou here confined for ever to stay? Hath Bounds been set, that beyond this thou art not to pass? Dost thou think my Calls and Invitations are only verbal? or that I put you upon
<pb n="315" facs="tcp:29869:203"/>
that, which the Omnipotency of co-work<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing Power cannot make good? Only believe, laying the stress of all upon my Creating Word, which will move, till the Number <hi>Three</hi> be witnessed, for the raising of this Temple, which all fill'd shall be with their own silent Company, walking all in holy Order, according to the living, Testimony. Which openeth a new. To which inspiring Word, ever more watch, and it shall be your safe Guide and Guard, till you are come here to abide within this fixed Sphear.</p>

               <p>In the Night I was much in Prayer, minding my Lord God of the many par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticular Prophecies, concering our Jesus coming to quicken and assume his own Spiritual Body in us, being mighty earn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>est in Soul-wrestling for the accomplish<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment thereof, against which I saw a great Strife and Wars by Spirits and Powers, from the high fallen Angels above, and the middle Regions and Depths below, all conspiring to keep down the Body, that is sown in that New Tomb, where
<pb n="316" facs="tcp:29869:204"/>
none but Jesus the Lord lay. After this Conflict in Prayer, I fell asleep, where the dark Magia followed me with Appa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritions from their Kingdom, which I en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deavoured to adjure.

For this Dew is as the Water of Life, that will make the dead Body again to live. As my dead Body, it shall rise Metamorphosed, as the Lily all white and fair, to take in the Golden Sun, and the Crystalline pure Air. Such a Body will be meet, to move from, and to draw in that Everlasting Gospel-Breath, which will tinge what<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever it doth touch. Now as to the time, when this Legacy will be due to you, you must look into the last Testament and Will of me your Testator. Who have made an Everlasting Covenant, firmly ordered in all things, where all Precious Promises concerning things to come run in general to those, who successively in time shall come into the Resurrection-Body,

Why have you let this lie as dead, and making no more matter about its search? And why see ye not whether this Revenue belong not to your New Names, which ye have been baptized into? I would not that ye should be ignorant of what might come to you, if you live in the Resurrection-Body, till it gets up into its mature Stature, a full grown-Body, which may be of ability, for the dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>charge of so great a Government and Trust, as in that day will be committed.

which ye may see the Comely Propor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of your New Creaturely Being. For it is all transparent and shining, an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>swering to the Place and Company, with whom you are to walk. Though ye yet bear in Visibility your despised image, till your invisible Body be grown up big enough, to fill out this Bridal Robe, by which you shall be discerned to be in the Lord's Body. Which will roll away the Reproach that came in by the poor fading Fig-Leaf Cloathing. Now observe and see to what an estate you may grow up unto, if ye keep up in the Faith: if ye unwaveringly believe, ye will see it.</p>

               <p>In the Night season I heard a Voice crying, Holy! Holy! who can enter where the Terrible Majesty of Holiness doth dwell? Then was presented to me somewhat, all over covered as with Swans Wings, no other proportion seen, and it was said, This all white <hi>Nazarite</hi> may enter in: here is no Partition-Wall, or Skreen that will intervene. After this
<pb n="319" facs="tcp:29869:205"/>
pass'd away, it was opened to me, This was no other then the White Dove Body of the Holy Ghost, that could wing up into the <hi>Jerusalem</hi> Court, where the Antient of Days did sit, to receive and welcome the Spirit of the Bride, thus embodied and all attired with Plumes of White, signifying the necessity of passing through the Swan-like Washings. Which do make us thus pure and white, for the bringing into this Virgin-state, where nothing is heard to cry, but Holiness to the Most High. For said the Word, No other can enter here, there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore see what you must attain to be, Swan-like, keeping upon the River pure, which doth proceed from the Throne. Where do you abide, till you come to the tenth Number washing-Tide, that may present you the all fair and love<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly Bride to enter in, and looking find, where their needs no more Sea for wash<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, but firm Golden Ground there to walk with your Dove-Mate.

               <p>This word passed through me, who shall among all the royal Seed of the captivity be found worthy to stand be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore the great and mighty King? Even those in whom is found no blemish, but beautiful and well favoured, and of a wise and understanding Spirit. Seek me out such, saith the most holy, to abide in my Courts. Whom upon search having found, a Decree is given forth, that they be committed to the custody of <hi>Melzar,</hi> the high Guardian Prince of the Eunuchs, who shall take the charge and care of these, whom I would have the most Eminent in and throughout my whole Realm. In order to which a daily portion of the King's Meat, and of the same Wine, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of he drunk, is assigned for them to be nourished by. Well knowing, what a fair and comly Body, such high Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venly extracted Food will bring forth,
<pb n="325" facs="tcp:29869:208"/>
to make strong and mighty, meet for the King's business. Here is a time also prefixed to be kept up to this Diet a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lone, and to abstain, and not taste of the low, gross, Elementary perishing Food, which makes lean, ill-favoured, and blemished, who must not come into the Sanctuary of the most High. A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainst such there is a Law, to exclude them all, from coming near to the pure Majesty. Therefore this Provision is made, that ye may without exception be trained up under the Prince of Life, who himself was a pure Nazarite and Eunuch for the Kingdom of Heaven's sake. Who will be to you herein a lively Pattern, giving day by day full Meals, and Draughts, out of the same divining Cup, whereof your Lord him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>self doth drink. That so ye may be Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rited with an all-peircing sight, to know what is done and acted within the Kingdom of Light.

These in each Scale were weighed. The Golden Globe immediately carried the Scale down, and thus it was said, Vision is not so weighty as Fruition.

other to flight. Here is the great Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quest, to subdue every Thought, and first to bring down these high Towers of the imaginary part. Demolish but these, and you will do your work to purpose. Now that ye may be wise to know, how to stop this muddy Source, observe these following Rules.</p>
               <div type="rules">
                  <head>Rules, for the Government of the Imagination.</head>
                  <p>
                     <hi>First,</hi> Wind out of all occasions, which from this World may minister and pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sent fruitless and unnecessary Objects, and Things which will kindle Essences, according to their empty and profuse Likeness.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Secondly,</hi> Keep thy self much within thy Holy Temple, and Holy Place of Silence, where the Trinity with their whole train, delight for to descend: with whom being much conversant, the sight of the Eye, and the hearing of the Ear, within this Heavenly Sphear, will both beget, nourish and maintain pure Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gitations.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Thirdly,</hi> Thou wilt see, feel, and know a fruitful Womb always bringing forth that which may grow up to the
<pb n="338" facs="tcp:29869:215"/>
Ghostly Fountain-Body. To which giving heed, thou mayst at the Mouth thereof set, and draw up Water of Life, I say <hi>of Life</hi> abundantly.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Fourthly,</hi> Oh then love to live within thine own Fountain, which is blessed; desire not to taste of any other, which may be Salt, or Sweet, or of a Mixed property.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Fifthly,</hi> Wait upon the Effusion of this rising Sanctuary-River, which will run till it become broad all over. Which is the right and true covering of the Spirit. Under this no evil surmisings can dwell, all of that Nature hereout will be ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pelled, at the opening Source of the holy Ghost.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Sixthly,</hi> This is the true and everlast<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing Sign, that shall no more be worn out, nor be cut off; but it shall be a sure Nail fastened within, for the more signa<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">

According to which thou art to try, examine, and prove whatever would enter into thy Heart, and accordingly to Acquit or Reject them, if thou wouldst remember to keep a true and perfect Sabbath unto thy Lord, rising in his Spirit from all that is Earthly, Elemen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tary and Imaginary.</p>

               <p>My Friend being at Prayer, my Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit ardently joyning therewith; This Word in the Heavenly Orb was spoke: What shall be done for these diligent Seekers, and Heaven-violaters, who for the Kingdom thus persue? Upon which Word pausing, and finding that within my self to Echo hereunto; I waited to hear what Answer would follow hereupon: I then in my Spirit saw there was a de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>murr, or consultation thereupon, but had not at that time any positive An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>swer from the Lord.</p>

               <p>In the Night I awaked upon some Voice, that was uttered, but could not remember, what it spake. And then I saw a Book that was opened, of an unknown Print, that I could not read it, which also passed out of sight. Then was this Word sounded forth. Here are the Children of the Bride-Chamber,
<pb n="341" facs="tcp:29869:216"/>
who to me do cry for stronger Meat; they have weaned themselves from the nutriment of the Breast, telling me they can digest Spiritual Flesh. Then was let down a Charger to me, with a Lamb that had been slain, and the Word said, Take hereof, and eat, this is Paschal Meat. Then said I, Lord, not so, this is raw and undressed, who can feed hereof? Then this was drawn up, and behold one, as in the Figure and Stature of a Man, but not in a fleshly Image, only the fashi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of a Man all bright, as the Body of Heaven for clearness: out of his Mouth went a white Mist or Breath, having seven Pipes or conveying Powers, one of each side, and another at the Navel, where somewhat was, as the Form of a Belly, but all after a very lustrous manner. Out of his Mouth went forth pure Breath and Air, then out of the Pipes, that were fixed on the Breasts, sprouted Milk. Then from the Heart went forth Streams of Blood, and upon one side grew out a Branch bearing Olive-Berries, then a Stalk, which did bear some kind of large solid Grain. Then on the other side from the Navel-Pipe did spring clear Crystal-Water. After this manner did
<pb n="342" facs="tcp:29869:217"/>
this Spiritual Body appear, and said to me, Draw near, for this is the great Day of the Feast, where the Spiritual Body doth convey it self in variety. Here is high spirited Blood and Flesh for the strong in Spirit to digest.</p>

               </head>
               <p>The Representation of this former Conveying Body of my Lord Jesus, did not only affect my in-seeing Eye, but by it I found my Life-Spirit fed, succoured, and strengthned. The very sucking down these Spiritual Sweets, (as com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pounded all at one draught) had their operative Power for some hours after. And again this Morning they did plen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tifully give out themselves, after the manner of a Conduit, that hath many Pipes at once springing; yet all in their Order, and as soon as one stops, an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>other
<pb n="343" facs="tcp:29869:217"/>
opens. Oh who can of these deep Manifestations judge, but such as are overtaken with these Golden Floods, that from the glorified Body do thus open, for the nourishing up of every part, till we answer hereunto in a perfect lustrious Body, like to like. Which my Spirit prayed vigorously for, seeking also to have a clear understanding of this Vision, waiting in great and pure awe, for my <hi>Immanuel</hi> to give me his Mind herein. Who said to me, By this is shewn thee what the Counsel of the Tri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity hath determined to do for you, that have out-grown the Child's Food. Here are new and fresh sprouting Powers, which will make my imbreathed Spirit grow into a Body. As a <hi>Nazarite</hi> it is to be, who must wait continually here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>upon, and must be under a restraint, so as only to take in what these Pipes shall give forth, that so the pure Crystalline thing may live in you, which will Leaven you throughout. Whereby the Most High and wonderful Consubstantiation will be ef<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fected to the glory of the New Creation. Then I further queried about the Book, and the Lamb which was first presented
<pb n="344" facs="tcp:29869:218"/>
to feed upon. It was said as to the Book, though opened, none could it read, because we were not come to such a growth of understanding, as being such as are newly weaned from the Breast. Then it was opened to me concerning the Lamb, that it was the Dying Dispen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sation, which did go before the rising Living Body, which quickens and brings to Life again, as it is written, <hi>I am the Lamb slain, that is risen,</hi> and do live to feed my Flock for evermore, from that Body, wherein is the chiefest store. Then it was revealed to me, that the Book which I saw opened was, and still should have been sealed up, had not the Lamb in me over Death prevailed, but now the Seals are undone, and it is given to the Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deemed for to look into it, though not learned yet high enough, to compre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hend those great and wonderful things, which are reserved for the full grown Spirit: Who understands all of the high Tongue and Seraphick <hi>Canaan</hi> Lan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guage, in which we shall be taught, as we are strong, and have aptness of Abi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lity to take in, from this sevenfold Fountain-spring, of which evermore, Lord Jesus, give thou us in to take.</p>

               <p>This Morning I was in a most deep in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward converse with my glorified Jesus, putting such weighty Questions to him, as I found rise in me, one was this, say<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, Ah Lord! by what shall I know, that it is now thy very self, that talks daily with me, and that hath unsealed thy Fountain-Body to me; for there is some<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>what of a greater proof, must yet go forth to make thee ownable and Praise<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>worthy, where Contempt hath been poured out. Now then, what wilt thou for such yet further do; and that thy Name may carry all through in Power and Authority, according to the Example of thee our dignified Lord. Who will not in thy Redeemed scarce be known, till they see the self-same Chariot come down, in which thou thy self dost ride with thy Scepter and Crown, through<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out the created Heavens and Earth, and therein to be glorified. Oh for this I am pressing, because nothing less then this thy great Appearance in us, will over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turn the Nations within and without.
<pb n="346" facs="tcp:29869:219"/>
Therefore shew us, Oh Lord, and an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>swer, what may make the way more clear and shining to us? After these Ejaculations emptied into the Bosom of my <hi>Immanuel,</hi> I saw a pure stream of Golden Colour, wave up and down, which pierced through me, feeling a new kindled Heat from it. The Eye of my Spirit saw it as thin as the Mist, only as the colour of the Sun-Beams. Then said the Word in me, What dost thou now see but the Spirit and Breath, which giveth Life to the conveying Body, which thou didst see. Who also shall be the harbinger from me to thee, as the living Sign and Witness: no greater ye will need. It is that deep searching Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit, who will go and come with speed, and will take and bring from my Foun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain Blessing, and give forth, as ye shall be able to suck and draw from it, as from a pure attractive Will. Then shall you know it to be your Comforter and Friend, who will for you search out all hidden things, which are freely given by Decree. This is the Spirit that is appointed to be your Overseer, an holy Watcher, and to find out, if any thing
<pb n="347" facs="tcp:29869:219"/>
be defective, within the Temple of the most holy Body. Where he must agi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tate for the Father, and me, all those high Affairs, which may answer to the bringing in, and establishing that de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sired Kingdom, from which the Scepter of Love, Power, and Righteousness, will never depart. Because this fiery Mist shall still purifie the Heart, and be to it a safe and defensive Guard, from the Poysonable Waspish Spirits, who move from the Serpent, to disquiet this your peaceable dwelling within this circling Breath, which from the Deity doth proceed. And it is a Gift worthy of all Acceptation in deed, as ye may find, if you be not to it unkind by op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pressing and laying Burthens on it, which it cannot bear. For it will take no burthen, or concern upon it, but what may augment the Heavenly growth and flourishing state. Where it may dilate the Powers of a Supersensual Faith, and Love-mounting-Life, and ever of it speak. Know you then, for what use I do send down this ready swift Messenger, not to minister about any thing, which is of a worldly Sanctuary, or that which worketh after the Tra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ditions
<pb n="348" facs="tcp:29869:220"/>
of Men, in all deceiveableness of Sin, whether considered in the more gross or refined part. This pure Breath will fly from all Putrefaction, and will be detained no longer with you, then ye minister what is pleasing to it. For as it receives from me to give to you, so it expects to bring some pure offering from you, that I may have an express of your growth and fruitfulness, that so I may not repent the Watering you with this Golden Mist, which may Produce a new Face of Covering upon the Earth, which will be all invitable to your God and King to walk and delight himself there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in, finding nothing that may therein of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fend the Trinity. The Spirit seeketh all, in which he may present you a meet Habitation, for the God of Love and Peace to dwell richly in his own Temple. Then fear not, but you will excell all Counterfeit Christs; for this Spirit of Truth will search out all deep, high and mystical things, that are of service and use to the Reign of your King Jesus. Who is to be exalted over the Earth, first in those who close with his Will and Commands: Then in the second place, this inspiring all-breathing Life highly re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gard
<pb n="349" facs="tcp:29869:220"/>
it, for it is that noble thing, that will not give over searching, till it hath found that rich Stone, which is the In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>troduction to the Kingdom.</p>

               </head>
               <p>Being in Prayer, I saw somewhat like a Cloud or Vapour of Smoke rising, turning into a Flame, and so ascending upward. Then said I, Lord what mean<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth this? Then was replyed, This is the Incense which doth scent and per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fume thy Supplications. All Interces<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sions are weak, and no ways prevalent, but as the Spirit entreth the secret Holy Place, and doth bring down from that Altar, which is fixed between the Che<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rubs, and from thence to let fall a per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fuming Coal among the spicy Odours. Which are all compounded by the Arti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficer, within the inward Sanctuary, who hath the Charge of all the Holy Things. Therefore it is such a principal Ointment, as none is to be made like to it, being so rare, pure, and sacred, that it is not
<pb n="350" facs="tcp:29869:221"/>
to be poured upon Man's Flesh, but it will devour and consume them, if they shall but go about to counterfeit the same. As it was by those, which offered strange Incense before the Lord. There<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore none hath Right hereunto, but the most harmless, holy, and separated, who have not defiled themselves with the Dead, and creeping things of the World<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly outward Court. But know and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sider whereunto ye are come, upon whom this Spicy Union hath fallen; into whose Hand the Golden Vial is given to offer with your Prayers this cloudy pure Incense, which is of a most high deified Nature. The all-searching Spirit hath found out this sweet perfumed Matter for you, that so ye might have success in your Altar-Oblations. Oh then now with Joy enter the Tabernacle, that is anointed with this perfumed Oil, for ye may expect this Golden Incense upon the flaming Altar will have all prevalence. Because it is derived from the Everlasting Mountain of Myrrh and Frankincense, which is the most precious Fuel for your Offering; which must ascend beyond the Sphear of Seraphims, to reach the Heart of your great High Priest. Who is set
<pb n="351" facs="tcp:29869:221"/>
over all the lower Priesthood to view and see, who in the holy Order of Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>secration do keep, bringing their Cen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sers to be filled with Fire, from those perfuming Coals, which can be found no where but in this Altar, which are exalted within the Heavens. The Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit taking and scattering these Coals, that so the Earth in you may be all a flaming Light, burning from this Incense Matter, which perfumes the Breath of all your Prayers, so that your God may smell that which may bring down Blessings accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding to your Will. Being so compoun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded in every part, with the Spikenard and Altar-Fire; as to be one continual ascending Power and perfuming Pillar of sacred Fire.

               <p>Having for some few Days met with some exercise of Illness upon my out<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward man, whereby I was made sensible how great a disadvantage that was to the Spirit of the Mind to do its Office and Work in, as to its House and Habitation, where it displays it self; making the very outward Animal Spirit of the Body in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>telligible of Divine Things: which when depressed by Sickness, is much o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>therwise, for that then the receptable Comprehensive part is much shut up. The feeling of which made me bewail the defectiveness of this outward Body, because it was disproportionable to that high graduated thing, which acted with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in it. Upon which I sought the Lord with great earnestness, to give such soundness to the Terrestrial Man, as it might answer to the Spiritual Operator, who was the moving Wheel. After some little space of time, I heard this Word run mightily through me, <hi>I am thy Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving Health, which shall arise, and get the Victory over thy present Infirmities.</hi> To

But it was said, Fear not, for on them also is set an impregnable Guard. Thus I was comforted over all Fears, Distresses, and Tribulations, being assured no Wea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pon should prosper against the Work, which we were charged with. For if on our parts we did not flag, the Right Hand of Strength and Power did en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gage to be with us, and for us; even so <hi>Amen,</hi> let it be, O Lord, evermore.</p>

               <p>I was in a Spirit of Mourning, for the Personal Absence of my Lord, whose Representations and Touches had awa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kened and drawn all the Virtual Powers of my Spirit after him, insomuch as I took freedom to tell him, whom my Soul thus loved, that sith, he had after such a high and total manner engaged my Heart unto him, above all others, that now it was but right and equal, he should marry me, and so in every respect answerably provide, and settle me, ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to the greatness of that Marriage state; Preferring also to him this Argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, that it was his own free offer to Love first, or I should never have pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sumed to have claimed such favourable Aspects, or such kind of Spiritual free<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom with one, so much raised above me. But verily now since my Lord made the first Proposal, and thereby hath gained my Interiour Will, with all its attend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing Affections, it is now but reasonable
<pb n="355" facs="tcp:29869:223"/>
that I should be answered in my Foun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dational Hopes and Expectations. Which are not grounded upon old recorded general Promises, but upon new and par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticular Words, dropping fresh from the Mouth of my Jesus, or else those deep Impressions had never took hold of me so, as to make me set light by all Creatures, and Things. Believing I had made such a choice, as was suffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cient to answer to every requiring, and to set me free from the Servile Bondage, to these sort of Creatures, that knew no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing of the Mystery of Faith. I did set home these and many more Arguments upon my Lord with all ardency, and I said that I did now look for Performance, and entreated further, that he would consider, that the Honour of his Fide<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lity was herein concerned. For I had declared to the World, that I was his, and he was mine by Covenant and Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tract, and therefore with what shame should I come off, who had rejected all Loves and Lovers, for to tye my Spirit in this Espousal Knot, to this great Heir and Prince of Glory, unto which Royalty, I did believe er'e long, I should be invested; If my Jesus would be true

And that he would be pleased so to act, as now to let them stand upon the visible Stage of Dignity, as they have been of Reproach and De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>famation, despightfully used for their Bridegroom's sake: As also to bring off all their disgraceful Calumnies, who hath now the disposal of all Princely Majesty, to put upon his present disguised Bride.</p>

First thou hast charged me to draw and steal away thy Heart, not only from thy self, but from all others; so as thou sayest, thou art as a lifeless, useless, actless Crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, having emptied all into me, so as now nothing will suffice, but the Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jugal Knot to be knit, or else thou think<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>est thy self never sure of me. Thus I have born thy Love-passionate Charges and thy unkind Surmises, because I had de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferred, upon deep grounds best known to my self, the publication of my deter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minate
<pb n="358" facs="tcp:29869:225"/>
Marriage with thee. But O Soul, may it not suffice thee, that I do main<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain all intimate Friendship with thee; and though I cannot as yet, make a vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sible Personal Appearance for duration, and for demonstration to the World. Yet in and by that faithful Witness and true Unction, I am still present with thee, I am no Stranger to thy Affairs; my Spirit gives an Account of all things unto me. I have left all of thy Concerns to be brought before me, and administred un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to, as occasion requires, by this Life-Breath which I have so secretly infused. Where-ever I bestow this Gift, it gives a sufficiency from it self to do and act all, that is above and beyond a Creature<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly Power. For it is of an Eternal Al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mightiness, proceeding from the Father of Spirits, who generateth what is like himself essentially into me, the First Born of this Second Creation; That henceforth the Power of Donation might rest with the Principal Head to pass and convey my self in Spirlt. And I see the way of Holiness made for this pure in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>spiring thing to walk in, which must find an Habitation suitable to its own Purity, that so all may be at an agreement. Then
<pb n="359" facs="tcp:29869:225"/>
in mutual Loves and Joys my Spirit con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>versant is, and will take in the Sence of all the Grievances, and report them un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to me. Who now have all, that is the Father's infinite Stock of Life, to enrich with Wisdom, Honour and Dignity at my pleasure. I long and wait to have it drawn out from me, therefore now make use of this all-searching Spirit, whom thou mayst make a Friend of, that may advance thee to a high estate, even in this present time wherein thou art spinning out, as others, Times Mortality, which hitherto hath brought forth very little of this Life's Treasury. No eminent thing hath yet been wrought, for to illustrate, and make me shine through the Cloudy Body; where through I would manifest again the Name <hi>Jesus.</hi> Come, O thou Complainent, rise out of thy fainting disponding Bed, and stir up this Gift, which is with you, work, and keep Pace with it. All must be broght to pass by the diligent Hand of this Spirit, uniting with thy Spirit, and thy Spirit with this Spirit, who will work all in all in thee.</p>

               <p>Being in deep Meditations, I was saying in my self, Oh that I were beloved of my <hi>Jesus</hi> with that Love, with which he loved <hi>John:</hi> To whom he did appear so, as it is written, by which his Spirit was drawn to hear and see those wonder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful things, that are to us reported of Ah Lord, why wilt thou not give me to lie as near thy Heart as he, and as close at thy Feet as the beloved <hi>Mary,</hi> that I may drink in every Word, which fal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leth down from thy precious Lips; out from which are the very Issues of Life. While I was thus pleading and invoca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting, there was presented a Triangle-Heart, clear as Crystal, that you might see through them; linked thus.</p>

               <p>Then heard I this Word, Here is place for a Pure Heart, within this Triangle Heart of the Deity for to joyn. Then I saw another Heart within the Circle, to spring with many more, which were still generated herefrom, all White and Crystalline, but they were without the Chain, this only one was within. Then I enquired, what Heart this was, which was so nearly admitted? It was Answer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, It is that Heart, which through migh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty ardent strong force of Love, hath broken through, and got into this Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cret Enclosure. Where it hath great opportunity and advantage to search and know what from this threefold Heart doth flow. Which have their several diffusions, according to their Titles: The first was under the denomination of <hi>Love:</hi> The Second was <hi>Joy:</hi> The Third <hi>Peace.</hi> All which agreed to empty
<pb n="362" facs="tcp:29869:227"/>
themselves forth upon this other Heart, which had pressed in for Shelter. And what-ever Heart can abide within this Circle, may attract strong infusing Powers, that are all pure and vital, to act in the Triangle-Might. From this Idea, I had great and full Confirmation, that the Heart of the Trinity was most free, and ready to embrace and receive them, who of one Spirit and Heart were together fixed, to break through the Golden Chain, so as none might be nea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rer to the Heart of the Trinity, then such who have rent and divided from all Creaturely Hearts, that so they might know what from this Triangle-Heart of <hi>Love, Joy,</hi> and <hi>Peace,</hi> doth ever flow.</p>

               <p>This Morning I was much upon the Consideration, when I should begin to work in the Name <hi>Jesus,</hi> as I did be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve in it, and had Promises from it. Now this was all in my Eye, to have the Spirit manifested for Activity. For I know, this only would be profitable, as it refers to the Glory of the Most
<pb n="363" facs="tcp:29869:227"/>
High, when Works do express the work<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing Source that is opened from the Deity. Being with my God very urgent on this matter, according to the impulse upon me, from the Expediency that I saw, for the Life to work out this way in variety, according to the measure of the Gift of the operation of the Power: This Word of Counsel and Caution sprang, Oh thou, whom I see restless and tossed to and fro in thy Mind, no rest thou art indeed to find, till thou comest to the working Mines. For there is the Tryal and Probation, who can be skill'd to work in the Furnace of an hot burn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing Sphear, which is not remote, but very near. Henceforth know, O thou flut<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tering Dove-Spirit, that I have not left thee without a weighty and rich Talent, which is in thine own Custody, though it lieth deep with a threfold Cover upon it; which must be unfolded, before thou canst see this precious thing. The first is the gross dark Mould of this Earthly Climate, which is very stifling to this pure thing. The second is the strong binding Reason, that lieth as a Mountain weight upon it. The third is the low natural Senses, which multi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ply
<pb n="364" facs="tcp:29869:228"/>
as the Sand upon the Sea-shore flow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing in, to stop and discourage thee from this great Attempt and worthy Service. Which if once fully set upon with a Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>solution to go through these Three Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moves, thou wilt then come to the Gol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>den Wedge, which will make thee great, rich, and mighty in the pure Ghostly work<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing Property. I your Jesus, do tell you faithfully, where the subject matter doth lie to work upon. Your Complaint hitherto hath been to me, as if I had car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ried away all the Stock and Treasury, and ingrossed it to my own proper use, or reserved it only for you, till you had slipped out of the Body. But know it is otherwise, do but knit and joyn all your Force and Power with my deep Fathoming Spirit which is given to you; and he will find, and also work out, what concerns your Freedom, and Invest<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment to the high and self-same dignified Glory with me. Hither towards ye have indeed prayed, and sought, and be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieved, and hoped; but ye have not wrought in the Furnace, where this Golden Wedge is to be all melted down, to run into every part of your Body, as the Life-Blood doth in your Veins.
<pb n="365" facs="tcp:29869:228"/>
Then you will know that unquenchable and fixed Efflux of the Spirit, that will be all Virtue and meer Power to work and act according to its sublime Consti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tution, that by virtue of this dissolving Stone, will put forth to do marvelous things. Which may be revived after a more wonderful way, then yet in and through frail Humanity have been ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>istent. Oh now then, seeing that is made known unto you, where the Trea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sure doth lie, and that you have my Spirit, not only to espy, but to work hand to hand with you mightily. Therefore resolve as in one Spirit, ever fixed to be to break up that, which doth lie upon this Princely thing, each one in your selves, to whom this Secret is revealed. Do not only Pray, and wait, but War, and work together, till ye have wrought out this imprisoned Power, that may yet be exalted upon the Throne of So<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vereignty. For verily no better, then a violent unjust deposing of your and my Spirits reign hath been. Call and en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gage all Might and Force, to recover his Kingdom again, that ye may sit in the Place of Judicature, and have all Nati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons come in at your Beck. All which

by meer Conquest you must effect, if to the Crown and Dominion ye seek to get. I shall now leave with you this worthy, and all desirable Jewel to the courage and liberty of your own potent Will, and my Spirit shall not fail to assist you with all its Armoury. So that ye may have Victory over that, which would still enslave, and confine you within the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pass of Mortality, with all its appertaining Enormities, which this Stone upon its breaking through will certainly free you from. Now as there is a strong Guard of Rational and Sensitive Spirits, which do multiply out of the Earthly Center; so be of good chear, that this one Spirit shall multiply to the Thousandth Num<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber, and stand up as a mighty Army to win the Field, where this Golden Mine is reserved. As mighty Worthies march ye forward: hold out the bloody Cross of Defiance, spare nothing which doth plead for the first fallen Creation, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause nothing of it can subsist with this pure Stone, but what is Crysolyte. All my dear Jesus, hasten this Stone out of this Burning Furnace in my Altar-Heart.</p>

                  <hi>September</hi> the 29th. 1676.</head>
               <p>This Night approaching to Morning, great Spiritual Travail came upon me; and I was in Soul-heaviness, through the sharp Pangs which I was overtaken with. For I felt the Birth strong to make way for its deliverance: mighty throws of the Spirit did work, and I therewith co-working was, that if by any means I might embrace the first-born of Might, to whom the Throne-Power and Govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment was to be established. While I thought on these things, my Spirit thus burst out, Ah my Lord, I have often been in these strong travelling Cries, but yet too feeble am, to bring forth that which is to be the Ruler of Nations, even he, who is to be cloathed with Royal Glory, Strength, and Majesty, to at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tend the Throne of the Deity; who will admit only such dignified Spirits there to resort and dwell, who are born again of equal quality within; so as it may be no Robbery to derive from thee, O God, this Fire-Birth, which makes
<pb n="368" facs="tcp:29869:230"/>
the pure <hi>Nazarite:</hi> Whose Proceeding, as also Working forth must be, from that everlasting Womb of Eternity; which does miraculously introduce it self into a poor despicable Corporeity, which is not perceived, till it cometh to a full grown Body, impregnated with Life in every part, and so growing till it comes to its full Birth-hour: which I did believe was after the manner of a Spirit to be effected. For this Word was expresly spoken to me, Fear not, thou shalt have this same also, which shall be caught up and nourished for a certain time, and then shall come again to thee; For while he is a Babe, and in Minority, Dangers and Perils will beset him, from this envious World. There<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore his Birth must be hidden and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cealed, and there needs to be no Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clamation of it, because none but Spiri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tual Powers and Invisible Hosts were cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led forth to be privy to this secret Birth.</p>
               <p>Then I beheld, till I saw the Virgin, who travelled to ascend, after the Child, being overshadowed by a White Cloud, therein wrapped up out of sight, freed from all Malice and Despight, being kept, and for while reserved within the Eternal
<pb n="369" facs="tcp:29869:230"/>
Circle of Light. Then the Voice in me cryed, and said, Behold that which thou hast seen to ascend out of the Forms of Nature, shall again descend in a full grown God-Manhood, to accomplish, all, that hath been predicted and decla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red by the Spirit, who hath searched out the Depths of the Birth of Wisdom. Then upon this was revealed and pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sented to me, the Figure of a Lamb all white, having Seven Heads, upon which were Seven Crowns like Garlands, with fresh Roses and Lilies. And one riding in the similitude of a Woman, cloathed with a Flaming Garment, like the Sun for Glory and Brightness, with a Cup of Pearl-Royal in her Hand, filled full of flaming Liquor of Gold. Then the Spirit said, This is the Lamb and the Bride, which shall the Dragon and the Beast, with all his horned Power ride down, with all his Mark and Name, which the whole World hath worship<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ped and admired. He hath had long his Time, to impose strange Laws, and Injunctions: and hath been in Uni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>versally obeyed. Whose Sorceries, Witchcrafts, and Deceits have worn out many Generations, who were ignorant
<pb n="370" facs="tcp:29869:231"/>
of the Depths of this subtle Serpent, and who hereby have died short of their Kingly Crown; The seducing Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phet perswading them, that they were under a necessity, of owning this false usurped Power and Authority, which so well agreed, and answered to the Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>statized Life of Sensuality. But oh, to you, whom I have seen Revolters from this strange King, and his Government, I the Spirit of Jesus am sent, to declare to you the Father's Love and Intent. Whose Heart is set to redeem you, from all Sins oppressing Tyranny, from the World's Spirit, and all that is Rudimental. I have sought out for such, as for my purpose might be, who are re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>solved to deny, and throw off all weights, and thronging Spirits, that would traffick within my Holy Place. For assuredly, I do of such take special notice, who do forsake all this low O<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">
                     <desc>•…</desc>
                  </gap>b for me, to follow my new revealed Tracks. Then cryed my Spirit, since, O my Lord, I have thus far found Grace in thy sight, give me to understand the meaning of this last Representation, to wit, of the Seven Crowned Lamb, with the Effigies of a Woman riding on him.
<pb n="371" facs="tcp:29869:231"/>
So this was opened unto me by the divine Intelligencing Spirit, which informed me, that the Lamb which I saw with Seven Crowns, signified Jesus, who yet never assumed his Reigning Power on the Earth for any duration. For while he was Personally in the World, he was under Suffering and Reproach: and ever since he hath been vailed and obscured in his Spirit; the Earthly part hath yet been too hard in the Lamb's Warriours. But now to any such, in whom the Vir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gin Bride is come down, to travel in the greatness of Strength, to bring forth this mighty Birth of the God-like Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, they may expect and look for great things to be produced, as the effects of this wonderful Birth. Which is caught up to the Throne of God, and will not return back, till he comes with all full command, to give the Seventh Num<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber-Crown, and fix it on them, to whom he is first to appear; conveying most free<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly and clearly his Soveraignty to them. But that which is the most deep thing in the Vision, is the great Mystery of the Woman, which sate upon the Lamb, with a Cup in her Hand. Whose Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>presentation is to shew, that this is the
<pb n="372" facs="tcp:29869:232"/>
Virgin of <hi>Sion,</hi> the Mother of the <hi>New Jerusalem,</hi> who is come to divest, and lay open the Harlotry Spirit, that hath brought in the Abomination of all Ido<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>latry, and hath made drunk the several Sects with the Wine of a Luciferian Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit, enchanting all Nations through her Magnificency and Power, having the Riches and Honours of this World, to give as a Reward to her Worshippers: Therefore to countervail, and the more highly to excell all that, this Princely Virgin, the Eternal Wisdom and Power of God, hath appeared with the Lamb in the Spirit's Soveraignty, to let thee know, she is the only Mother and Bride to whom is given the Cup of Blessing. From whence are substantial, durable Riches, Power, Dignity, and Sove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>raignty, that shall know no limit or end of Glory and Kingly Dominion: and thereof also will be to all Eternity a<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">

               <p>SO soon as I awaked in the Morning, I was saluted with this Word, Turn not away thy Foot, but walk in that se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cret Gallery, where my Spirit may with thee commune of the Matters, which appertain to the Kingdom: Which thou hast prayed for to thy Jesus, hoping it may be admitted in thy despiseable form of Mortality. Which may according<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly be admitted, through the watchful observation of this Inspiring Word, which is given to be thy Guide. Who gave me Rules of further Instruction,
<pb n="374" facs="tcp:29869:233"/>
upon the occasion of what I was very earnest now in Prayer about, saying thus, If thou expectest thy God should do somewhat, which is extraordinary, and eminent, for thee, then thou must walk answerably with him, in a singular way, according to the Oily Light of the infu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed Unction, which is come to give the true Knowledge and Insight, into that Life-habitation, which is hid by the Thicket of the Mortal Principle, through which thou art to pass, as swift as a Dart, not minding or staying in any thing, till thou reachest the Mark: Which is the Cup, wherein the Burning Gold of the Holy Ghost is ready prepared, for such as can pass through this World, and not be with it touched. Then said I, Oh my Jesus, thou requirest hard things of us, who have thought, that none for this Prize had out-bid us, but now I see ahigher rate upon this Jewel of the Kingdom is set; so as I do not Marvel at the great adven<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, that must be made for it. O who can hereto be perswaded, that of necessity, thus it must be, that all we have gotten and enriched our selves with from this ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cursed <hi>Aegypt,</hi> must be given for the Land of <hi>Canaan,</hi> that so we may come to the
<pb n="375" facs="tcp:29869:233"/>
City of our Rest, to inhabit it with our Kingly Bridegroom.</p>
               <p>Moreover this Word came unto me, Shake off all that dismal Widowhood, which presents thee still before me in heaviness. Ah! Lord, said I, how can it be otherwise, till the white Virgin-Robe and Airy Body be put on me, by which I may press through the Clouds to thee. Tell me then, how I may put off, and change that Garment, which is so muddy and heavy, that I cannot fly with it as a Dove in to the Pavilion of Divine Secresie, so of<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">

                  </gap>trife, to lay aside this up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per Garment of Sence and Reason. For I know there is no coming unto thee with it, it smelleth so of the common shore of this corrupt Earth, that nothing is more unsavoury.

But her delay makes me conclude, she is loath to take too abrupt a leave from the <hi>Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>abitish</hi> Land, fearing to displease them, as if her Eye was still hankering after some Reward from this Harlotry Va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>grant. All which is included under the Curse, and therefore cannot to my Spouse make any Addition of Blessing, but will seek to dispoil her from her greater, more weighty, and eminent Riches with her true Honours: through the sub<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">

<pb n="378" facs="tcp:29869:235"/>
deluded Multitudes, ingulphing them deep into an irrecoverable Pit of Perdi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion. Of which common Snare, O ye that are called and culled out to live upon another Fount and Spring, take good heed: it is for such as you thereof to be aware. It is for you not to be here caught, but still to go to <hi>Jacob's</hi> Lot; observe therefore, and diligently enquire, when you are to depart out of <hi>Babylon,</hi> and when the set-time is that your <hi>La<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ban's</hi> Service shall expire. Now my charge unto you is, that when I your <hi>Jesus</hi> expresly alarm you, to take your leave of all, and from all things, and to make a quick dispatch after me, that you linger not out your time, with so many Taking of Leaves, and long Salutes, whereby to express so hard a Come-off from this Evil World. For my Spirit will hide nothing from me, but doth give a true account, how your Mind and Will stands towards me. He is that im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>partial Spirit of Truth, who on both sides is faithful, who does as well take of yours, and snew to me, as of mine to you. He cannot and will not make any force, without the free consent of your own Will; nor treat with you any

otherwise, then by Love's Entreaties, and those many considerable Advan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tages, set before your true Spiritual Eye, which in this Light of the anointed One, ye may spy without defraud or hin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>drance. And as for thee O <hi>Shulamite,</hi> what thinkest thou, doth thy God and me more disgust, then when my Spirit bringeth this Report to my Ear, that thou canst not yet give full credit to thy Espoused Lord and Husband, without wavering? My Spirit tells me, that Love is not grown so perfect yet in thee, as to cast out every questioning thought; which makes thee so oft in Jeopardy. For couldst thou undoubtedly believe in my Faithfulness, and highly great and all-sufficent Responsibility to answer to all, and what-ever relates to thee, as thou standest in thy exiled state: I say, if in this perswasion my Spirit could thee fix, thou wouldst openly decry down the Beast and his great Benefactor, who doth sit on him to give Rewards, out of the false, pernicious Magick Cup; and thou wouldst only look to thy own Eternal Dowry, from the Hand of her who is all over cloathed with Strength, Glory, and Majesty, thereby to cover those who are
<pb n="380" facs="tcp:29869:236"/>
lodged in the Bridegroom's Heart. True it is, ye have not only witnessed a good Confession with your Lips, but have also in some degree given the Sealing Proof, by bringing out the first ripe Fruits. O know ye, who are my Garden Plants, for what end are all my Golden Dews to you conveyed through my Spirit? Are they not, that ye may see this fruitful Tree of Life, within your own <hi>Lebanon,</hi> to spring, both for Food and Healing? Whereto ye are brought by that Spirit and Power, which is in mine Elect, who are given by the Father, to be joint<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sharers with me in the third great and blessed Lot of pure Breath and Heat from the everlasting Deity. Even so to us, my God do them this infuse rich<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, according to thy Word.</p>

               <p>This Word came to me, saying, None but my Eunuchs, who are seperated, and have cut themselves off from all other People, can know how to sanctifie to me a Sabbath of Rest, whereby they may cease from the toil of their own Hands.
<pb n="381" facs="tcp:29869:236"/>
In this Day, their Strength will be to sit still, to feel the all-piercing Unction, that hath such a high and wonderful slight, as to effect all work without cry or noise. This I tell thee, Oh Soul, as a Secret in thy Ear; for in this lieth a deep Mystery, which is only known where the Train is purely laid, running as out of a Spout, from the all-flowing God-head, into the pure Eunuch Spirit. Who hath suffered a dismembring for the Life of Holy Generations sake, through the secret, unknown way of co-operation, and essential contaction; by which the holy thing, that is of Ghostly Authority, comes in this manner existent, in and through Nature's frame, to get in such who are thus qualified to shine forth as Day-Stars, in the Lamb's Celestial Fir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mament. After the Spirit had revealed this unto me, it said, Who but such potent and high raised Spirits, (pointing to some one or other, known by Name) should be called out to bear his Name, and to shine in Wisdom and Power, as Lights before the Gentiles, that thereby the Sons of Strangers and Aliens, may come to joyn themselves to the <hi>Day-Spring from on High,</hi> which though in
<pb n="382" facs="tcp:29869:237"/>
the Clouds of Mortality, yet known may be by the fruitful operation of the Spirit of Jesus, which worketh mightily in contradiction to Reason's Eye. Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>serve your selves therefore still to hallow my great Name, in keeping within the Walls, upon which the Guardian Cheru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bims are set for your defence, that there ye may keep my Sabbath from polluting: no Burthens must there be carried through. And so you will know the be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginning of my Eternal Rest.</p>

               <p>Being upon some occasion interrupted in my Spiritual Calling, by touching with that, which was ungrateful to the pure Spirit of Jesus, he told me, That he was of that Seraphick Nature, that he could not delight to be where any world<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly trafficking Spirits did resort, having a disgust to what-ever did spring from this fallen accursed Principle. And therefore it was agreed, that I must keep his Temple-Habitation pure, for that no reception must be there, but for the Holy Trinity. The outward Court,
<pb n="383" facs="tcp:29869:237"/>
where the common Senses flutter up and down, is sufficient to take in what is to be considered for the Mortal Man. Who also might well be cast upon the Spirits care, and firmly relied upon: For such in whom this is, so shall grow, and spring as a Sabbatical Lily, without any thought, how their Food and Cloathing do come in. Ah! upon this my Spirit cryed, Lord I have been a long while getting up my Faith to this pitch, but cannot come to the degrees of this all-conquering Faith, which may thrust out every tittle of an Earthly Confidence. Which I well know are as the miry Rushes, that have been a stop to this rising Lily, which groweth no where, but out of Faith's unweedy Soil. Thus, by way of Expostulation in Prayer, I presented what the Spirit shewed to me was short, and defective, and did impede the suc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cess of the Work, going on jointly by the Lord's undertakers. Who were thus animated and counselled by his Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit. After that I had supplicated, and owned the good Hand of God, in joyn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing me to one, that had a good degree of Love, Courage, and Constancy, to go forward with a fixed Eye, to the Mount

of Transfiguring Glory, this Word spake to me concerning him, He is a Son of O<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bedience: Therefore meet with thee to prosecute the Spirits design in this visible Earth. Then received I only this fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther Charge, to keep the inward Court of our Minds all pure and clear, as we love to entertain the Spirit of our Jesus there.

Being then met to breath, each one from his Gift, as the Dr. was speaking, the Word said in me, Blessed is the Glory of the Lord, which makes its remove from place to place, that the Tabernacle-Body may bear witness to this Glory. Which verily was felt and discerned in this very juncture of time. For the most Holy did leave the Impress of his Glory upon us; for it did run as Lightning through my inward parts. Thus our Jesus makes his Pace swiftly to us, to give often refresh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to our Hearts: Hereby lifting us up from the Earth by the Spirit of his Eagle-Might, which presseth into the Heavens, there ever to live in the Bosome Loves Rest.</p>

Who will arise in us, unto this high degree and state, as to swallow us up into this shining Face, so that no Cloud shall be betwixt the Majesty of Glory and us: For as our Jesus is, so this rising Spirit of Glory will bring us, into the same Transfiguring Body of Glory.</p>

               <p>This Word opened in way of Resolve. Know, O Soul, thou hast this <hi>Elisha-</hi>Spirit with thee, of which great Improve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment may be made. If thou canst know how to draw him out, it will be possible to multiply manifoldly. Therefore I thy Jesus directed thee to view the ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cellency of this Spirit, and to provoke thee to ask a numeration of this, to lay out upon my account, so far as may reach to the glorified state of my new exalted Humanity. As to the first part of <hi>Elisha's</hi> ability of Spirit, which took in a sympathizing sence of the poor Widow's cry unto him: This thou mayst read inwardly, as thy own de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plorable condition, who hast often cryed to thy Prophet, of the Oppression of this cruel Creditor, the Prince and Spirit, who rules in the evil World, that would have taken thy two Sons, both for Bond-men. Who are to be under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stood, as they relate to thy inward and outward Man, to imbondage both, and hold them in perpetual Captivity as
<pb n="389" facs="tcp:29869:240"/>
Debtors, through the degenerated Prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciple to the Law of Sin, which makes ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>noxious to the Curse of Servitude to this wicked Usuper. From which my <hi>Elisha</hi> Spirit is to come to set free, through the additional Blessing of Increase, out of that Pot of Oyl that is found before-hand in thee, but of no sufficiency to redeem out of the Creditor's thraldom, till the Spirit of Multiplication do take Know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge and Compassion, to shew what will buy thee out of all the World's Servitude. Wherein thou hast known such Perplexities and tyrannical Thral<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>doms, that have constrained thee to look out for Liberty. Now then hearken to my Counselling Word, ye who do agree as united Spirits to break this Yoke from off your Neck, resolving no longer to be under Tribute, repair to your Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phet <hi>Elisha,</hi> and only make him privy to all your Necessities. Let the Prophet's Widow in this case be the Pattern in thy Eye, and in all Extremities fly to no other. Call upon this <hi>Elisha-</hi>Spirit, for he is to be raised from the dead, to work mighty Deeds. First in the hidden Man of the Heart, which prepareth for the working through the outward part,
<pb n="390" facs="tcp:29869:241"/>
every Vessel must be cleansed within, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore the Golden Oyl of the Almighti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness will fill them. When this is per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect, and purely done, shut the Door upon thee, and thy two Sons, and let none come in to spy. For the Foun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dation-matter, for Miracles to work upon, will run from a most secret hidden Vein. The method here of will be quite changed, as to what was in the days of <hi>Elisha.</hi> Who though he acted parallel with thy <hi>Jesus,</hi> in the days of his hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mane state of Minority, not having reached the Coronation-Glory, could not till then set afoot this New Ministra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, that openeth from the Line of the Holy Ghost. Who is that full grown Vein of Life, which hath so long under Ground been hid, because of which, no miraculous thing hath of these last days been wrought. For none hath cared with my Spirit to plunge so deep, and therefore it is for a while to lie hid, till they have found out the right Needle, which may pierce this third Vein, that proceedeth from the Godhead. The Life-Blood of which, will be the run<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning multiplying Oyl, which is costly indeed, thou needst not crave a greater

Portion. Be not afraid to sink down into the Spirit's Pool, or Pot of Oyl, that is within the House of thy Heart. It was <hi>Elisha's</hi> Spirit that entred in, or else the Oyl had never run so free: So do ye likewise with your Spirits. Descend, where this spring of Blood doth so deeply run, which will be of such rich Merchan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dize, as it will make all of this Creation-traffick, to be of no validity. Observe with all heedfulness, the track and way of the Spirit, in its own Eternal Ground. Follow hard, venture to pass through every Region, whether in Darkness or in Light, loose not this your Leader out of sight: Who will certainly bring you to the Oily Flood, which meeting with the flaming Juniper-Wood, will send forth such sparkling Powers and miracu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lous Glories, as may plainly declare, the Spirit of that one <hi>Elisha</hi> is risen.</p>

<pb n="395" facs="tcp:29869:243"/>

Therefore ye who have prayed to see this New Creation-Day, consider what you must suffer first, to come upon your vile cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ruptible Body, which must be fashioned in this pure Spirit's property.

The Spirit of Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phecy in me, which opened and declared of these things, which were to come to pass in us, said, If hereunto we could set our Seal of Beiief, and give place to the Spirit of Truth, they could not fail of their accomplishment.

But herein lieth a greater, deeper Mystery yet, as it both presents Deity and Humanity thus interwoven together. To shew how your Humane Will-Spirit must be wrought into this All-deified Spirit; which to the ground-form of Silk gives the shine and glory in the va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riety of Flowers embossed thereupon; according to the similitude, which to thee was let down, with the engraving of the Sacred Name, that is, that Prince<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly

               <p>In the Night I had this Representa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of a Vine, upon a Wall, which was very fruitful, but not come unto its full ripeness. There appeared several sorts of Fruits, besides Grapes, all spring<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing from the Vine-Root. Which while viewing, there came a cluster of Cater<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pillars, with black Heads, fastening up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on the young sprouted Fruit to eat it off, in this its Minority. At which sight I was much concerned, how to prevent the marring of such choice Fruit. After I came to weigh and consider the thing in the Spirit's understanding, the Word
<pb n="400" facs="tcp:29869:246"/>
of Revelation opened, and said, This Vision was for caution, and warning unto us, who were now incorporated into that Vine-Root, to bring forth Fruits, ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to what the Spirit hath sowed and watered, so as they begin to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>substantiate into Fruit. Whereunto we coming to this first primary putting forth great danger does attend this new crop of the Spirit, though they seem as harm<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>less, inconsiderable Worms, yet they un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>conceivably destroy, and eat, and suck away the very Juice of the Grape, lea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving only the empty Husk. For which cause, saith the Spirit, I have this warning given, lest ye should not be heedful enough of this my painful Hus<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bandry, which I have brought forth in you. For these little Foxes, and craw<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling Worms are as pernicious to my new planted Nursery, as those greater Beasts of Prey: Therefore ward and watch, keep all Invasions of this kind out, when ever they do set upon thee, and would assault to snip away my first Fruits. Then take to thee speedily the Bucket of Faith, and let down into me, who will open the Heavens to bring down Showers, that shall
<pb n="401" facs="tcp:29869:246"/>
wash and scatter away these devouring Caterpillers out of thee.</p>

               <p>It was further shewn me, as I was in Prayer, upon this occasion, how our Vine<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>yard might be kept, each one from being preyed upon. This Word was shot in from the Lord upon me, Keep thy Eye upon this new springing Lily, sit under the Shadow of it, and go not out from it. Its fruit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fulness will befriend thee, when this World with all its fruitfulness, shall be as a dry Tree. Therefore make it thy only Shelter and Stay, for the Essential Power of the Deity floweth forth, as the Spirit in thee can draw it forth. That then ye may fully scent this Flower of Lise, and live upon it day by day: then thou needst not wander from the Spirit's Tent. Who hath sufficiency to keep thee, if thou couldst go forward, and work with him in this Magia Cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling.

For to know deep and secret things, is both sweet and pleasant, whether they be for present or future Existency. But this is not to be all my Dowry, though they are of great use and service; yet here I cannot stay, neither dare I take up fulness of Joy, there is something else yet behind, which must fill this Heavenly Body of Light.

Where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of ye, who through strong travail are hither come, are to be fellow-sharers in this Life with God the Son.

The Word said, Behold the Idea of another Paradisical Sphear. I saw a Tree spring suddenly out of a great River, with three laden great Branches, then sprang divers more young Plants, all sprouting from the Veins or Strings from this one Tree. Each one with no more, then three Branches, but of different growths: Some new budded, others bearing Flow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers in order to Fruits, others grown to palpable Fruit.

Here each one hath, and is growing up in a Life of Subsistency, and Almighty So<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veraignty, deriving all this Power and Might, from the Tree of Life.

               <p>Now this Morning it was set before me, according to the Example of <hi>Esther,</hi> that for a certain time, it was expedient, that we should sanctifie our selves, by a true Fast in pure Abstinency from their As<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sembly-Feasts; <hi>2dly,</hi> From tasting any thing that is ministred from this gross Element, but to draw apart from all, keeping our Internal part from being defiled, shutting up from all, reminding only the overturn of <hi>Haman's</hi> device; That great subtle Adversary, that had laid the Plot against the new introduced Life, to cut it off before the King had put Honour upon it, to bring it through the City-Royal, upon his own Eagle-Body of Power. Now seeing the ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>licious design of the Serpent, with all his Confederacy, was gone very far in this matter, there was no other way to reverse the Decree, but by famishing the Earthly Life, with all that pertains thereto, casting out the disobedient
<pb n="411" facs="tcp:29869:251"/>
                  <hi>Vashti;</hi> that so such a Virgin might be sought out, as might please the King, and upon all occasions might have his Ear. Now <hi>Esther</hi> is only to speak what <hi>Mordecai,</hi> the Divine Life puts into her mouth, Words of Wisdom, to out-do all the Serpent's subtilty. This prudent <hi>Mordecai</hi> fore-sees for <hi>Esther</hi> all dangers that are like to accrue, gives present no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tice, that so Evils may be escaped, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore they do overtake. Oh here through this Similitude, how freely and plainly did the most Holy Spirit reveal what lay hid in the Mystery, further advising us to prepare a Banquet, after the touch of the Golden Scepter, which gives the To<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken of Acceptance. <hi>Mordecai</hi> contrives with <hi>Esther</hi> jointly, what Provision to make, only knowing what the Royal Court fare is, bringing in those choice things which the King feeds upon. So that this Banquet consists all of Fruits, but not raw, or gross ripened from this old Element, but such as are preserved with all sweet restorative Spices, fetched from the Land of <hi>Havilah,</hi> where the Golden Liquor flows, and the sweet Canes do grow. The Wine to this Feast all answerable hereunto refined from the
<pb n="412" facs="tcp:29869:252"/>
Lees, served out of that one Golden Cup, that none ever drank out of, but the great Donor of the Feast, who will only receive it from the Hand of the Bride. Then said the Spirit to this Bride, All things are now ready, invite the King and your God unto this Supper. Your Banquet thus ordered, you need not doubt of the King's company; and though the proud <hi>Haman-</hi>Spirit may here intrude, yet fear not, for his doom will be suddenly given. Oh <hi>Esther,</hi> who art in great favour with the King, put forward, and spare not to ask, that now thy Life may be forthwith given unto thee in a Princely Subsistency. All that is in thy Heart, at such a time as this, may verily be answered, and thou go away with Joy of Heart, not that only thy Accuser is cast out, but thou art come near to the Scepter of the Kingdom, to live without toil, or bryarly Cares. Thus did the Spring-Unction make it ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plicable to us, by reiterating all this over again, that so hereby we might be assured whereunto this Golden Scepter, let down by the Hand of the King, would bring us, who in an <hi>Esther-</hi>like Spirit of Hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mility and Faith do draw near to it. It
<pb n="413" facs="tcp:29869:252"/>
was also further noted to me from the Spirit, that when-ever we had these Ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bernacle-Feasts, and the presence of Glory in it, we should not get only a Promise to alter the Hand-Writing that had gone out against us, but to press such Arguments, as thereby to overturn the whole state of our Captivity, under the <hi>Babylonish Haman-</hi>Spirit, and to get Let<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters written, and sealed in the King's Name. Which will give the Authority and Credit in this our Enemies Land, to stand for our Lives, and to have de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fence, even the Omnipresence of Strength granted out of the King's Armory, to do what we would in the Spirit of <hi>Mordecai,</hi> that goes in and out in the presence of the King.

The great King of Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven like <hi>Ahasuerus,</hi> hath given this World's Preferments into the Power of the great <hi>Haman's</hi> Spirit of Reason, who is a Prince does reign over all, that your God may see who will hold out in their Integrity, in refusing to be under the Laws, though none greater in this vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sible Kingdom then he. Now this Histo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry I have taken up, and applied to you, to observe in every Tittle, that you, with me your Jesus, may come to Royal Honour and Dignity, by refusing the Beast, and the Dragon's allurings from this visible <hi>Babylon.</hi> And by adhering with <hi>Esther</hi> in all sweet Humility, to the Masculine Spirit of my undaunted <hi>Mor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>decai.</hi> Thus ye shall rise unto Strength, Glory, and Immortality.</p>

and Birds of prey; which would stop and steal our Treasure from us. So I was carried on with great swiftness, in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to a secret solitary way, from out of the sight and noise of all active Creaturely Inhabitants. For it was said, Thus it must be, if you will see a New Crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, with the replenished Life Plants, that grow there all-flourishing and clear, according to the pure Element that is there.

For what is more empty, naked, and void, then Words that are not touched with the Altar-Coal, that giveth Impreg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nancy where-ever it falleth?

               <p>Towards the First Day in the Morning, I saw the Dr. as in a publick Theatre, bearing a high Testimony for the Spirit, in a Youthful figure, and Hair grown

brown and bushy. Who was acted forth that he bore down many that seemed to doubt and question, what he from the authority of the Spirit witnessed to. Upon which it was said to me, This should be fulfilled in his season; upon whose rising Day, wait to the fulfilling Joy: From this presentation it was given me to conclude, that the D. should assuredly be made an able Minister of the Spirit in some signal proof of it. Which I sought my God for, in reference to the Glory that would be manifested, through the lifting up the Standard of this migh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty defensive Spirit. Whom we do be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gin already to feel, is so busie again in us, as gives good ground of hope, that somewhat is to be brought forth, that shall make a free and clear place for the Holy Ghost, to act forth his own Power in the Humanity.</p>

               <p>THis Day upon Mr. <hi>Bromley's</hi> ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count, the Dr. was engaged to speak in Publick, whose Sails were spread and filled with Breath from the Anoint<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing Power. After which I found my Spirit much called into an inward still<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness, to find out the original Wheel, that turns the whole Creation about. As seeing all things short; though they are brought forth in Spiritual Appearances; they pass away as yet too weak to bring forth the transfigured state. Upon which consideration, I went to my Nights Repose in some heaviness of Spirit, mourning after the Life-working Power, to deliver me from this, &amp; every surviving Hour of Temptation; importuning for a naked access to the Throne of Majesty, where I might have freedom to open all in plainness of Speech, and to hear with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out any other Medium, but the Spirit's Ear, what God would answer to me. Upon which I had presented four moving Wheels of Flame Colour: As they turned, they opened a deep in the ground, which
<pb n="422" facs="tcp:29869:257"/>
still dissolved, and melted away where ever they went, so they kept on their circling course, having at last no more ground to move upon, all being burnt up before them. A Seraphim with six Wings all covered them, only through every Wing an Eye was seen; and then the Wheels were lifted up, and did ascend. Then a Voice came unto me, saying, Mark and see, what you must be turned into, if you will see the bare and naked Majesty of Glory. Canst thou think to bear the presence of an Immense Light, that is of such a transparency without a Cherub's covering upon all thy working Wheels. If thou wilt come to the heights of <hi>Zion-</hi>Glory, come prepare for to be undone in thy own sensitive Life, the very Pillars of the House o<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">

                     <desc>•…</desc>
                  </gap> there can be no possibility of coming in to that great Assembly, where the Mos<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">

had after this manner discoursed, the <hi>result</hi> of my importunity was thus given to me; I was convinced what such an access for continuation there would cost. For it was shewed to me, there must be down right Payment, Words would not alone pass. All our earthly Goodness and God<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liness was to be given away for this Che<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rub's Covering, and no longer in the Tents of <hi>Babylon</hi> to stay; there to live in the midst of a People of unclean Lips. Now the great thing is, how this shall be brought to pass, for who shall live, when God doth this? Yet seeing the all-knowing Spirit hath plainly hereof advertised, that so to us it may not come as a surprize, when these burning Wheels shall wholly undermine and consume what it finds of that putrified Earth in us, Oh then I do see the six Winged Sera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phim will be our Covering, through which we shall behold, the Lord the mighty King upon his Throne of Glory, according as hath been foretold, and there his mighty Voice shall hear, which now sounds in our Ears, from that Seraphick Sphear.</p>

               <p>As I was introverted into my self this Morning, calling over those things re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vealed, upon the Representation of the four Wheels that eat out the Earth, which it moved upon; this Word more<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>over cryed in me, Suffer these Wheels to turn in thee, though it be painful, re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>joycing that ye are come to dwell under this Cherub-Covering; where under a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>biding with all wariness, the Eagle-Bird may fly out thece in great Might, Strength and Glory.

               <p>This Day in the Evening at our own private Meeting, in which the Lord did much appear with us, it was given me to speak from the new covered Earth, which was once as a solitary parched Ground, but now it was shewed me, that it is now become all covered with the utmost vari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ety of springing Flowers, all flourishing, which will still abide in us, so long as the Water-Courses keep their due springing

Tides, with the Spiritual Constellations, opening from the Cherub-Bride, who dwelleth in that hot Beaming Body of the Sun, that reneweth Life to every growing Plant that is brought forth un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der the Cherub-Tent. Oh here I did see in some few, a fruitful Field or Soil, and a full replenished Garden, which invited him, who is our true Seeds-man in, to view and see, what might be more eminent, and excellent in us, to engage his walking presence with us. In whose company, we do witness the out-breath<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed scent, of what is planted by his own Hand.</p>

This Word with an Emphatical Power to me came, saying, Oh where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>withal shall a Young Man cleanse his

Way, but by taking heed unto my Word? which was further confirmed by another ecchoing Voice, a little space after, Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gard this as a seasonable Warning. So that from hence, it was fully set home upon me, that every speaking Word from under the Cherubim Oracle, from whence the holy Sound does pass, the Light thereof is to be obeyed in all things. And it would be as the Burning Wheel, refining, and making pure; for no longer then our Minds and Hearts, as the High-way of the Spirit are cleansed, can I said the Holy One, walk there.

                  <hi>Cyrus,</hi> who will be raised as that prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cipal Shepherd, to go before us unto this strong fenced Place.

There is an Eagle-Bird under the Che<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rub Wing, which is a hatching, for which you must wait a while, till it is all fletched and flig: that only can mount you up. It must be this Eagle Eye that can fly so high, to face this secret Place, upon which the Sun-Beams do lie so hot, that no other can come nigh her. It is but fruitless Labour, to climb up with a ponderous Body to the top of this Moun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain. Therefore keep close, and warm under the Dove's Wing, and your Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit will answerably grow into the Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture of a swift flight to reach to this place. Which is called by the Name of <hi>Shammah;</hi> the everlasting Armory of Wisdom and Strength lieth there to be drawn out by such as can assume the Eagle-strength.

This is so strong a Fort, that commands all

Then it will be in your own Power to scatter and make fly, whatever opposeth you from the Spirit of Enmity; all which shall be subdued from the Armory of this strong Tower, that henceforth to you who are diligent Seekers shall be opened. Look and see, for the Eagle-Shell is assuredly upon the crackling.</p>

For else whereby should we be able to make out our conjunction with the Spirit, but by stretching forth the full Banners of it, as the great Testimo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nial Witness of the mighty Presence ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken up in us? As I was deep upon this Consideration, this Word from the Lord came to me, saying, What more signal
<pb n="430" facs="tcp:29869:261"/>
Sign can you desire to demonstrate your true Spiritual Birth by, then this; that you have not heard of, and seen the Sign of the Son of Man in the Heavens, as Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stinct from you; But behold this is given you, the very <hi>same</hi> to be; which in its time, will shew it self to be the Son of God, by and through the Resurrection from the Dead. Till which time, ye must suf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fer under a Vail, in Conformity like to your Jesus; who was of no reputation in the World; as giving him no Credit, nor Honour, till by Death they saw the Vail rent, and the Earth shake; then they began to be convinced, that this must needs be the God-Man. Even so on thou must proceed, to give witness by thy Death mystically, as he did natural<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly give proof thereof, by Rocks ren<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding, and Earth-tremblings, which will be at the yielding up of the Ghost. This happily somewhat hath been reached to, but yet there must be an open shew there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of. Crucifixion is a lingring Death; let the Blood and Water so freely out-run from thee, that may bear Record to all, that thy Spirit is ascended into the Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther's Bosom. From whence may be ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pected thy return, to bring down that
<pb n="431" facs="tcp:29869:261"/>
Spirit, which will raise that Body, thro which that Signal Sign shall be manifest<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, that can assume Authority to release, what hath been in Captivity: And ye shall go forth with the Scepter dominion. Ye have but this one thing to effect, to shew out your selves risen from the Dead. Then you will find that every Breath which proceeds from you, is of such force, as to command the whole Heavenly Host.</p>

These things being the mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter of my Meditation and Consultation with that Word, which was to me very nigh, it suddainly cryed within me thus, What stability can ye come unto till the four Winds are with-held, which awaken the old condemned Life in all its Essences. Then was presented a Hand from under a Wing, which knit up these blasting Winds, that they might not hurt the new replenished Field, out of which are expected the Seven Years Plenty. Then hereby I saw, it was only this strong Eagle-Hand, which could the rough East-Wind stay, that caused those swarm<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing Flies to b<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">
                     <desc>•…</desc>
                  </gap>z and make a noise, suck<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing away those Honey-Dews, so soon as they do fall. It was also further noted to me, that these Winds were of that evil consequence, as to put to wreck the Sailing Ship of Faith, whereby all the
<pb n="433" facs="tcp:29869:262"/>
out-ventured stock of Life is to be brought in. These four Winds were also named to me; as 1<hi>st,</hi> Wormwood. 2<hi>dly,</hi> War. 3<hi>dly,</hi> Anguish. 4<hi>thly,</hi> Destru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction. These being let loose, did blow up the Natural Senses, breathing fresh Life every moment into them, So main<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taining the Spiritual War. For so long as the carnal low Sense liveth, and is hereby revived, it will be active after many a deadly stroke, to nullifie that supersensual Life of Revelation, that cannot take its place, till these Life<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>breathing Winds be bound up. Then was shewed me an Engraving like a Seal, with the Emblem of an Olive-Tree with three branches, and it was said to me, When ye are Sealed with this living Print, you then shall know a fixed Life. These Winds can no more hurt, if once they may but stop, till ye are feelingly impressed with this Olive-Tree. This is another manner of Life, then what is subject unto Mutability. For what is greater then for the Life of the Holy Trinity, to be appropriated penetrating<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly by way of Sealing? Now for this great preparation thereto, is required the one pure unleavened Lump, all pas<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sive
<pb n="434" facs="tcp:29869:263"/>
without Life, to receive the Impres<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sion. Which accordingly was performed, by the overshadowing of the Dove, that gave the living Witness of being Bap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tize into the Name of the Father, Son, and Holy Ghost. By which the Contrary Winds were restrained, that they could not blow up the dark Mists and Fogs any more. So from hence feeling in me a pure Serene Calmness, the Powers of the Eternal World did let fall sweet pleasant Dews, from which the Fruitful <hi>Sharon</hi> did spring, to entertain the Trinity, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in the circumference of this holy Ground, which is now so strongly enclosed, and fortified, that nothing common or un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clean can pass hereunto: for the pure Winds from the Heavenly Element gave forth a new fresh Air, all clear and bright; so that in the Light thereof, liberty was given for Holy Walks, as in a Superce<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lestial Region, there to take up the Souls true Central Rest. Even so sweet Jesus, never let me venture out, lest those perilous Winds should me overtake; to unfix me out of the even Temperature, wherein all stability will the Mind most safely and securely Fix.</p>

               <p>Now upon this Sealing opened and enlarged the great Mystery of the three Heavenly Witnesses, which gives light to the Understanding, and makes it capable of knowing and comprehending the Souls true Originality; as to what it was, what it is, and what it is to be: what it was in its first pure State, then how it fell, and lastly what it is to be, and after what man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner to be restored.

<pb n="436" facs="tcp:29869:264"/>
Deity it self, wherein the Righteous and Immaculate Nature of Jesus doth spring as the Lily in the Valley. For it is not a bare Record or Report of these Wit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse, but it is an essential Body. All-Deiform, which is a Record that can never be obliterated; for that the Holy Ghost is the sure Pledge hereof, which doth keep alive this Impression, by his continued Motives and Operations. So that what is Invisible in the Heavens, is made Visib<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">

For thus the higher Heavens are brought down by this Trinity of Witnesses, into the habitable part of Man's Earth.</p>

               <p>The Ternary of Witnesses upon the Earth, answering to the Impression, from the three Branches of the True Olive-Tree, were now heard to give in seve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rally their Testimony, agreeably with that which is given in the Heavenly Places, in order to the bringing about the greatest and highest of all Ministra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions, which is that of the Holy Ghost; and to the compleating, and defending of the Kingly Birth, from the Virgin Woman, which the Dragon ever watch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth against, to destroy it. And hence was it given me to understand the several Offices and Business, belonging to each one of these, to make ready for the Birth-Day and to protect this High-born One from the raging Floods &amp; the tempstuous Winds of the Adversary. The Spirit's Work is to reprove, convince, exhort, counsel, caution and comfort, in order to the carring on this great Affair. The work of the Water is another witness, as you find it in you, as a bubling Pool,
<pb n="438" facs="tcp:29869:265"/>
cleansing every part within, that so not the least defect may be found in the Matrix, whereout the Birth must open. Then the Blood is a great Testimonial Witness and Evidence, as in a mystical manner conveyed, tasted, and drunk down by them, that do carry the matter of this Birth, for it doth produce a vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gorous Life, that will be known and felt, to refresh both Mother and Babe. So keeping all these in their several acting-Properties; they will be the clear evidence unto thee, that the Ghostly Birth is working out it self. Therefore with these three, let thy Will-Spirit a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gree hereunto, to throw out every mis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>conceived thought. For now all things must be new again, by the Father, Word, and Spirit, through this new Birth wrought. That ye may come to a migh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty Record among the New <hi>Jerusalem</hi> Stones, where all are waiting this rising day to see, because it will fix in thee, an unknown Liberty both in Spirit and Body.</p>

               <p>It was also further expresly opened unto me, that we were at present brought thus far, as to witness these three, as Spirit, Water, and Blood, being Witnesses in our Earth, which did fore-run the Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nistration of the Holy Ghost For they must go before, as the Ministration of Jesus, who came by Water, Blood and Spirit, that is Death, Life, and Resur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rection, from which he passed, and so must we. As he did bear our Record in Heaven, which will be a different thing, though agreeing to one and the same end, as thus, the three first make way, as the Water-Baptism into the Death, the Blood into the Life, the Spirit quick<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neth, and giveth a Body of the Resur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rection. So the Ministration of Jesus hath its twofold Use upon us, in order to the second thus, which are to bear Record, as the Father, Word, and Holy Ghost in our Heavens. So here is to be understood the rising Degree, or chan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ging from Jesus in Spirit, to that degree of Unity, of Father, Word, and Holy
<pb n="440" facs="tcp:29869:266"/>
Ghost; all which agree to enter into a Virgin Mind, thus prepared, and in it after a high Mystical mauner themselves conceive; so as to include them as one only Being; contracting the Virgin-Will and Spirit with it self, hereby becoming one inbred with it, as that Heir, who was darkly prophesyed of, in <hi>Micah's</hi> day, who said, the glory of <hi>Israel</hi> was to come unto the <hi>Adullam,</hi> the very pure Tabernacle of the Virgin-Nature, born again of Water, Blood, and Spirit, so made indeed a meet reception, for this holy thing to be sealed up, as in an un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>known Pavilion, or hiding Place of Strength: which must be till it hath at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tained every measure and part, to the growing big, and filling up the Birth's place, with Breasts full of Milk, the Spring Word of the Spirit diffusing into them, the natural course of the Bloody Issue of Sin also stopping, all which will be evident Signs unto you, that are still apt to be questioning, whether this Ghostly Birth is in you forming. There<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore be still and wait, for that great tra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>velling hour, that is to come upon ye, before which sometimes ye will be in Pains and Heaviness, because ye may

And methought it was a mighty Change, which I did not know how I came into, but all Care,

Fear, and Sorrow were fled away. I did feel during this time no low matters of an Earthly Sence at all to touch me. I did during this time, feel also another sort of Birds like Bats did us pursue, which could not hold out their Flight, because of the excessiveness of this Light Reigon, but down again did fall, and again would strive to rise, blindly, to trouble and hit against those who were winged for to obtain the Prize.</p>

                  <hi>Look back to</hi> November 23. 1676. <hi>and there is the Vision, and here is the In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terpretation of it.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>THere was much from this Vision manifested to me, first was, that this shewed, there must be a passing out of a gross, ponderous, heavy laden dark Image and Body; for in the pure Airy Region, only Aetheral Spirits in Winged Bodies of Power could live and swiftly move. Such a Translation it became us to wait and look after, that it might be
<pb n="447" facs="tcp:29869:269"/>
really accomplished, as the Figure doth call up to. For it was said, this must be till we come this Change to see, all to be in the very Body, by virtue of that Crystalline Stone, that formed must be within, who to its own Clarity must sublime us throughout, before we can go forth, like Eagles to mount, and to take our Prey. As to the resistency which I saw it, was thus to be understood, that at the first going forth, though thus impowered and spirited, yet it would not be under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stood by the very Elect, who were to be gathered to that Region: for something of Reluctancy there would be, till further confirmed by another Witness, that also should wing up in Spirit and Powers, And should marvellously draw and gather in the Scattered, who to Wisdom's Mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stry do belong, which must prepare for the state of Mount <hi>Paran,</hi> and so for the New <hi>Jerusalem.</hi> Then queried I further about the last Flight, who were so few in Number, yet very troublesome, blindly lifting up themselves against us. It was shewed me, that there were dark sensitive Spirits, whose center was in the dark Holes of the Earth, that had some particular knowledge and relation
<pb n="448" facs="tcp:29869:270"/>
to us, while we appeared to walk with them after their Similitude, but being herefrom changed, and something being formed in us, that hath given us a Wing<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed Raise, and so made the Separation and Alienation, they would pursue to bring us down, that they might know us in their own Likeness, for in this Trans<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formation they cannot, without they could come to be, as we are. Which is impossible, till the Holy Lump in them be made, and they be separated for this state, from all low things to live, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>unto we are called and appointed to live in the Ghostly Body, where we shall meet the Lord our Bridegroom, in the Airy Region.</p>
               <p>This Word much followed me, The Birth in you is the Son of God, but it doth not yet appear what it shall be: when as it shall work quite through, expect great alteration, even unto Trans<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>figuration. At which I rebounded with this Answer, Ah Lord, how thick down do flow thy Prophecies, but what makes the working Wheel so slack to effect this mighty thing. Then said the Spirit in me, Thou art in haste, before the Earth<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly Mold be laid waste, not considering
<pb n="449" facs="tcp:29869:270"/>
that ye are but come unto the restoring Ministry, that is preparing for the Birth of the Dove, out to fly, that carrieth all Wonders in its sevenfold Eye, which is your Lamp within, that getteth for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mation by degrees. Therefore it is not to be stirred, before it comes to its full Age: all that you are to do, is to drink in, what is brought to Hand by its Virgin Mother, for daily succour, as the Word of Counsel, Caution, and Direction, which is at present; all which ye are to expend upon, for stay and strength, till its Birth-Day shall in and through you break.</p>

               <p>In the Night in my Sleep, the Accuser, and watchful Enemy assaulted me hard, upbraiding me with false and deceivable hopes, that I had in this Ghostly Birth; demanding, why we should more then others in the World seek for it, that were left in the same common Faith with others, ever since the Holy Ghost with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>drew, which was not again to be born through any one in Flesh, according as
<pb n="450" facs="tcp:29869:271"/>
we looked for. Then this Word was present with me to repel, Oh get thee behind me, thou Spirit of P<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">
                     <desc>•…</desc>
                  </gap>dition, that goest about to pervert Truth, and wouldst make void the Love's Election of God. Knowing well thou standest not in his Counsel any more, but art afraid; nay, it is thy terrour to see Faith risen so high in any one, as thereby to conceive such a mighty Birth as this, that will so rise, as to overturn thy Kingdom and Reign, that hath been so long in the Earth: for hereby cast out thou wilt be. Therefore we will not doubt, nor throw away our Confidence, because the Birth we trust to, hath already upon it, the Foundation-Seal, being already named, which cannot be obliterated, without it be by yielding to thy daily renewed subtilties. Which as in the day of <hi>Eve,</hi> so again thou wouldst be preva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lent; storming high, so much as thou seest the Day grow nigh, of overturning the Babylonish Captivity. Much con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>test I had of this kind both sleeping and waking: One thing more I remember was his charge, that he some proof would see of the Father's Almightiness from his Birth in us. With that I roused up my
<pb n="451" facs="tcp:29869:271"/>
Faith, and said, that thou mayst. &amp; wilt, un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to thy perpetual downfal: therefore away, depart with all thy Wiles from me. For I will no more give Ear to the undermi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nings of such a Serpentine Spirit, who would circumvent me, in the process of my New Birth after the manner of Je<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sus. After this I fell into Sleep again, towards the Morning, then I felt such bitter Agonies in my outward Man, as if my Life had been just parting asunder, and throws and pains, as if my Back had been cleaving in two, which awaked me. And I was amazed, when I came unto my self, that I found all was so well with me: for I perceived the Evil One had be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leagered me in his dark Magick, but could neither hurt me in Mind or Body. The watchful Eye of my Jesus being vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gilant to preserve me from his Fury.</p>

               <p>After this Conflict, I waited to under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stand the meaning of this terrible on-set upon me, and it was thus spoken in me, Satan hath desired to winnow thee, and watched his opportunity to surprize thee, while the Animal Life was reposed; and
<pb n="452" facs="tcp:29869:272"/>
might he have been permitted, he would certainly have undermined the Virgin Birth, by overthrowing thy Faith. Which is the very Life-pulse of this Birth, for if that stop, the Life soon grows weak, therefore still maintain, and keep up that Faith, which is the material matter of this Birth, that the Evil One hunts to destroy. For could he make void Faith, he well knows, that is the very Basis of the New Creation-building, and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by would throw down all, what ever hath been wrought. Consider, oh ye upon whom this Probation time is come, which will be the Birth growing, that you carefully provide, and gird on this defensive Weapon, oyling it well, that no rust on it at any time be found. As it is given you to believe, so mind to stir up this Gift in you, remembring what all precious Faith hath done in this World, through the very mortal Case. Nay, as ye read, the very Visible Creation was brought about, by the Word of Faith, and can be no other<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wise Restored, to its first primary Pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity, Liberty and Glory, but through the rising Life of Faith. Of which the Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pent's subtilty broke the Golden Chain,
<pb n="453" facs="tcp:29869:272"/>
and cut that Silver Cord, which held up the Paradisical Creation; by introducing his Temptation into <hi>Adam.</hi> Who hereby broke his Faith and Covenant with his God. Now then by one Man's disobedience to the Faith, all be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>came faithless, by which then it was impossible to retain the similitude of God, for hereby he lost the use of the most holy generating property, and brought forth strange Births, as ye at this day do find the sad effects thereof. But now yet once again, an open Birth-Door is set, for Wisdom's Life-Seed to enter in at, which shall bring forth a new Crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion store, much excelling all the Births that have gone before. To which good thing, so much prophesyed of, give great heed. Marvel no<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">

                  </gap> that the accur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed Serpent's Seed is so enraged night and day, his Venom to let out: it is because he suspects thou art designed for some eminent use, through that principal Birth, that may be a means to ransome many out of Turkish thrall. Therefore at this Animal Life he did strike by his wounding Dart, but I thy Jesus stood with Faith, the Weapon Balsom, nigh, thee to heal. And will not fail thee still to guard against his Wiles; keep but my
<pb n="454" facs="tcp:29869:273"/>
Faith, and from it do not shrink. And so give charge to such, as engage with you upon the same account, and you will see certainly the issue of that Birth, that shall most perfectly restore the fallen Crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion in your selves and others, in such a way, as yet no late President hath been, since <hi>Immanuel's</hi> Birth did de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>scend.</p>

               <p>In the Night season, after some rising Ejaculations had ascended, and I falling into a Sleep, I was suddenly awaked, as if some Person had been in the Bed with me. Which in some kind of fear I rose up to see; but saw nothing, so lying still in the consideration a little while, I felt sensibly a Hand all over-spread upon me, with an influence of great Heat, at which I marvelled what it should signifie. Then this Word spake, saying, Fear not, this Hand is stretched out, for to encompass the Birth, and by the Heat to fix the Life's impregnancy, that it might be past the Dragon's power any more for to slay. Who cannot cease to watch it with an Evil Eye, for which cause I have over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>shadowed thee with my Airy Body,
<pb n="455" facs="tcp:29869:273"/>
which may bring forth accordingly, as Faith shall operate in its own Mystery, which is the great thing whereby the Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rad<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">

For this cannot be, until such a Birth be brought forth, that hath all Faith to go forth with all Power, as without guilt of Sin; for that quench<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth the Seal of Love, and Bird-limes the Wings of Faith, which is also a twisting Cord to bind down its Eagle-Body: but it is able to free it self from all, that brought it under the bondage of Evil. Now this renewing Birth, set your Minds fully upon, for it will be to you, the <hi>Noah</hi> that will comfort you, by resto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring a New World from which the Curse will fly. I your Jesus must abide in my Heavenly Reservatory, till this Birth in you grow ripe, for it is the <hi>Elias</hi> that will come in another, and more perfect Ministration, then ever yet hath been, that must prepare for the Coming of me your Lord from Heaven. Who left this Work to be accomplished by the Buth of the Holy Ghost, which was to bring forth the most perfect Restoration, that so you might come to know <hi>Elias</hi> track, through the burning Chariot, for

Translation. It will certainly fall upon the Lot of some one, or other, that are hereunto predestinated, to bring forth this mighty <hi>Elias</hi> in Spirit, as the first born in Wisdom's Day; to go before, and overturn, and make ready for my absolute Reign, yet to be in the Earth, in order to the New <hi>Jerusalem</hi> descend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing Glory. Therefore take heed, be circumspect, believing this Birth for to see, wing up your Faith, and Pray, and travel mightily, that ye may be those Worthy Ones, to bear a Living Testi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mony for me. For a great and weighty Government will be entrusted with you, when Wisdom's Birth shall be fully ri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pened: for a much more glorious state then that of <hi>Solomon,</hi> shall be establish<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed upon the Ghostly Nativity. Instead of a Terrestrial, there shall be a Cele<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stial greatness of Dominion, from this Birth-Lily springing, that hath like the two Witnesses been long slain in the Seed, and buried over with Earth, so as forgotten in the World. But now ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pect the raising of them up in each of you, who shall stand as Olive-Trees before me, still naturally flowing out with your Golden Oyl; it shall not be as

               <p>A mighty Saying was ecchoed to me, brought forth out of the Counsel-deep, pronouncing it should be our Lot, to live by the Sword and Bow of Might, by which <hi>Jacob</hi> of old took great Spoil out of the Hand of the <hi>Amorite.</hi> Which was thus opened unto me, that this Word came to me, to let me understand, that our Blessing and Portion would come in by meer Conquest. For thus said the Holy and True, Behold and see, here is the Gift that I give to you, as a Father's Blessing, which is the Sword of my Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit, and the Conquering Bow, whose Arrows are all of Gold: with these ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pect ye must get your Living, and also bring, into me, your God, your worthy Prey. Now therefore gird on this Sword,
<pb n="458" facs="tcp:29869:275"/>
that is so richly oiled with the purest of Unction, and go forth all prosperously. It is not only a defensive Weapon, but it will cut down and destroy; and resist every <hi>Balaam</hi> Spirit, which standeth in your way. None ever was possessed of this Sword, but that strong Potent Will-Spirit, that knew the Way to the Golden Pool of Oyl, there still to bath it, when<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever occasion is for it to burnish, and dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>play. The sight hereof will cause all about you, to stand in fear and awe, when they shall see you are so God-like, armed with strength of Power, which is so commandable, that all resistency will fly away against it. Oh this is that Spirit Weapon, which makes riddance first within thy self: it will suffer no <hi>Amo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rite,</hi> or <hi>Cananite</hi> near its Borders to dwell; But <hi>Gideon-</hi>like make havock, hew, and cut down every Grove, where false Worships hath by blind Zeal been set up. But verily the Day is near, for the Sword of the Lord in <hi>Gideon's</hi> Hand to appear, which will make a quick rid<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dance in the Earth. The Lamp of my Spirit in your Earthen Pitchers is now seated, though the time hath not yet been for them to shine out, by reason
<pb n="459" facs="tcp:29869:275"/>
that the Olive-matter of the Holy Ghost is not yet come to that Perfection, to sound forth the Trumpet for the total Victory, over all Centers and Worlds, which shall certainly be conquered by this out-going Birth. But while this is perfecting, here is Conquering Work, that ye may not sit idle, but now to go on every day, somewhat to effect. Therefore another Weapon is given into your management, which is my Cove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant Rain-Bow, which will be to you of great consequence, if you have skill rightly for to use it. The use of an Eagle Eye, that may this great Birth-mark espy. Here lieth the grand deep-sighted Wisdom to shoot forth such a Golden Shaft as may hit, and thereby make way for Wisdom's first-born to come forth, through sending out this mighty Arrow of all precious Faith. Nothing like this you will find, will be of travelling force to help you out in your Births Agonies, which upon you will come, before you can imbrace this Ghostly Body imbodied with a Soul and Spirit. That will spring all a new, from the creating Word im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bodied in a corporeal shape. Which for a time shall remain a high degree of
<pb n="460" facs="tcp:29869:276"/>
Wonder: For to see the Ghostly Power to send forth through contemptible Hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manity, that high scented Breath of Air, which may be felt, tasted, and smelt with whom it is resident.</p>
               <div type="question">
                  <head>Then this Question in me arose.</head>
                  <p>Ah my Lord, when shall these Powers be set awork, so as the doubtful in Heart may somewhat hereof see, and we there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by from all upbraidings be set free? I was thus answered, The Day is not to be put far off, for now is the acceptible time for Salvation to be wrought. There is conquering work still to be done with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in, the Flaming Sword must cut down every Briery Root, and burn up every Thorny Thought, which do near this Li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly Birth spring, and vanquish all vaporous Clouds that thicken the Heavenly Air, with all the gross Animal Life of Sense, which is the greatest of Impediments. It is that <hi>Esau</hi> that holds Faith's Birth by the Heel, that it might not break forth. Therefore in the strength of <hi>Jacob's</hi> An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gel, do you strongly wrestle: for by his Sword and Bow you must make your way, and Conquest gain, that so you may command both the Heaven, and
<pb n="461" facs="tcp:29869:276"/>
earthly store. For Heirs of all Worlds ye will be: then gird up, and go forth all armed; the munition of the Spirit is with you, so as nothing can harm you, who carry the precious and essential Root of Life in you. Even now, while but in it its Younglings day it is, yet it will be a defence of Glory, that now and then will sparkle through, by which it may be known, that in you is intombed a Precious Stone, a White Stone, that hath the Virgin's Name engraven on it, which must be for the Lamb a Spouse and Bride. Therefore the Cry of the Spirit is, Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pare, make ready, and Pray fervently, for your Everlasting Birth-Door to open, that the Heir of Glory may enter there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>through: Even so let it be.</p>

               <p>The sweet living Pool this Night was mightily opened, and stirred by the holy driving Spirit, that brought choice and super-eminent good things, out of the high Kingdom's store, saying also to me, Come, tast, and see, how you like the Heavenly Country-Fruit, that is

For I, your Lord must take special care to feed and nourish those, that are with Young, with the highest of Birth de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>grees.

After I had prayed, I was encompassed with white waving Clouds for a good space

I see you are careful to keep it, for a higher degree of Seed (as not being satisfied with what is sown and sprung up) though there be many young and fruitful Plants, all Plants of Righ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teousness. Yet here is one principal Tree that is wanting in the midst of these, to grow for the better feeding and establish<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of these. All which are worthy of acceptation to me your Spiritual Sower. I am come now to that Plantation, which I can call my own, where the Virgin Lily of Faith, and the blushing Rose of Love, and Marigold of Hope, and that
<pb n="464" facs="tcp:29869:278"/>
sweet-scented Violet of Meekness, and the Cordial Gilliflower of Patience, and the Honeysuckle of Abnegation to all whatever proceeds from this cursed Earth, all these are pleasant in my Eye: Ye being found faithful an<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">

This is that from which ye may expect an Olive-Tree to spring, that will feed all the rest, from its oily property, which will flow not by constraint, but voluntarily, and will all these Plants re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>establish and refresh, as shall be felt in you, as Witness-bearers hereunto. This is that Olive-tree which emptieth it self forth upon these several Plants, being higher graduated and enriched, contain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing in it the all fluent dispersive Life that ascends upward, and again flows downward with oily Dews. Which as a Mist Waters the whole inward Ground for a daily flowry Spring, that I your Lord, may walk in the midst of these fresh scented <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">

<pb n="465" facs="tcp:29869:278"/>
apt to withdraw and dye, therefore I have sown this pure Olive-Seed in the midst of them, which will arise to fulfil and perfect what the several Seeds Births have left behind, and short of bringing this to effect. For this Life-Tree acteth all free, because it hath in it self all-suf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficiency, not by a forced Might, or con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>straint in Contest with a contrary Birth of Life. No, in this Olive-Tree, there is no such dividing property, it is from the one pure and perfect Essence of the Deity, which never ceaseth till it hath wrought out all Contrariety whereto it comes to be a fixed Root. Now then try your selves hereby, for thus it will work, to give proof that this Seed is of the right Olive-kind. It is indeed come in you withal great Love to restore; therefore as the thirsty Ground open wide for this pure Oil-Olive to drink in, that so all Sin may be cleansed out of your Ground, for this Original Righ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teousness to take place, laying the old Foundations waste.

               <p>In the Night I had a bright shine all about my Bed, which was signified to me, that as without, so it should be all Light from the seven Oily Lamps, that should be as a covering Flame to cloath the Virgin Woman, who should be impregnated with the Birth of the most holy Seed of God. Then queried I, who this Wo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man should be? It was said, the Name was known, and written in one, that was to be of a perfect Heart, meet for high and Heavenly Converse, and so thereby contract a Sun-shine body of Light, Crystalline and clear, to wing unto the Heavenly Sphear, which is the Habitation for Spirits of Light. This Woman that is certified of by <hi>John</hi> in the <hi>Revelations</hi> hath not had its fulfilling Prophesie to this day, therefore yet to come, as it was in Spirit said to me, and that the pure and perfect in Heart might come this Woman to be, as the Wonder of all Wonders, which hath been since Time's Creation. The Birth of Jesus was great and marvellous, but this shall
<pb n="469" facs="tcp:29869:280"/>
far excell it, because it will be of such high extracted Quality, as no Terrestrial can or shall see its God-like-form, but as its going forth may be felt and under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stood by Effects, to be indeed the Birth of the Holy Ghost. Then I further started this Question to my Lord, and Spiritual Informer, Whether this Birth should distinctly be manifested from this Sun-like Creature? that is said to travail with it to bring it forth. For this Ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jection arose in me, that the Virgin that brought forth Jesus in a Fleshly Figure, she remained still the same, no transmu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation came upon her, no more then upon others only living a holy Virgin Life, but no matter of Wonder after Christ's Birth wrought, a<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">

                  </gap> by or through her have shone forth, but all still by the Birth that proceeded from her. Who in that Day gave proof by Miracles of the pure Dei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty working through Humanity. This great Question was thus resolved me, through the Word of Life opening, which testified as followeth; True it is, that in the humane Birth of thy Jesus, there was a visible shew of distinction, because of the Corporeity which then was needful to be born; but in this case
<pb n="470" facs="tcp:29869:281"/>
it will be otherwise. For this is a Birth of meer Spirit without any commixture of Humanity, only it will pass and act, some<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>time, through this Virgin Humanity, which it hath chosen to be its Birth-Womb or Temple-Body, whereby it may act its Deeds of Wonder, answerable to its Birth-Deity. So that here the Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther of the Virgin Birth will be more dig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nified and honoured, then the foregoing Ministration in the Birth of Jesus was. Therefore an oriental bright flaming Gar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment is allotted her, with a Crown beset with Stars, plainly declaring, that to her is given the Command and Power to bear sway within the Celestial Region, and by and through that near relation, and conjunction with this mighty Birth, when born, to go forth to seal, and save the Nations, that shall bow to its Sove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>raignty. For this Birth consisteth of marvelous Power, none can its mystical Being sound or find out, for it operates in every Creature and thing after a Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gical manner. And in this one pure Virgin, she will first unseal that everlast<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing Source of <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">

<pb n="471" facs="tcp:29869:281"/>
give his quickning Powers first in them, who for this successive Birth, have their Minds purified and refined. For this a touch-flaming Stone there is, that will in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kindle Life in each one, as its pleasure shall to introduce it self most free. For by way of Birth it will grow, in all that hereof shall participate, and after like manner generate. But oh here will be the great thing, who shall be counted worthy, to be the first of this Ghostly Generation for him to begin withal.</p>

The second Rule that was given us strictly to observe was this, alluding to the Woman in the <hi>Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>velations,</hi> that was cloathed with the Sun, before she brought forth, signifying to us, that Clarity and Virgin-Purity was the signal mark of such as should her personate, in the Heavenly state. There<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore what less will become us, then Gar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments of Light, having no streaks of the Night of Darkness upon them, as it is written, all Light in the Lord. Who is our fine Linnen-Righteousness, to exercise the simplified Nature of the Virgin-Spirit, who this Birth is to bring forth in the World. Then also I had this further Advertisement, that it would be very requisite for us, who carried this living Birth-Stone within us, for to seek a Desart, solitary Place, void of all the commixed Solaces of this World, who
<pb n="474" facs="tcp:29869:283"/>
would envy, and hate, and chase such as should apply themselves hereunto, as Noted Ones, who do wait for this great Birth refreshing. Therefore be wise and wary, said the holy Guide, and make no mention yet what the Lord is for, and in you doing. Remembring that Word, Let not him that is but put<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting on his Armour, boast or glory, as he that putteth off, having given proof of Victory. So ye are to consider, that your Walks here in this dark Valley, and amongst the Dead, is very slippery and unsavoury, and may well offend the holy pure, conceived thing within you. Now then fly to a solitary Wilderness, where you may preserve your selves and Birth, from the Dragon's Eye, that awakeneth and stirreth up every where against it. For as much as he, with his piercing Eye doth see who nearest the Birth-mark are; now then up and away, take flight with that Wing which is a strong resolved Will, that carries swift as an Eagle, into that Path and Way which the Vultur's Eye shall not espy, during the time of your most secret hiding in this Wilder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness. Which to you shall be as a <hi>Leba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>non;</hi> for the Angel of my presence shall
<pb n="475" facs="tcp:29869:283"/>
here walk with you, if herein you shall obey, then will I feed and nourish you, with that which is choice and primary Food indeed, such as the gross and sen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sitive Life never understood, I do only require the act of your flying Will, to abide where you will see nothing grow, that can feed your earthly sensitive Ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>petite. Here is no other Life to be known, or exercised, but that of Faith, which must fetch in all Provision belong<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing hereunto. Therefore my Spirit doth allure you, who are justified and nou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rished by the outflowing Acts of Faith, which through a constant exercise will be of that predominancy, as to eat out and swallow up the mutinous Essences, which strive so hard to make void this Life of Faith. Now then do you receive from my Hand this Crystal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>line Cup, wherein is the Water of Life from the Fountain Rock: I do also place the Golden Pot of Manna by you, that so ye may have no need to wander out, but hereof freely take; it will feed up unto the full grown Body of the Ghostly state. Now then be wise, and give no Ear to the crooked Serpent, who still will be casting in his Floods of Jealousies
<pb n="476" facs="tcp:29869:284"/>
and Fears, saying, What make you here in such a desart place, shut out from all the pleasant things which are lawful to be enjoyed, with, and amongst your fellow Brethren. But these his sugar'd Baits meddle ye not with<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">

But be assured, there is that high extracted Matter sown within you, from which will rise the Star of the Wise, that shall win length of days, durable Riches and Honour by Strength and Dominion, and shall bring in another Kingdom. Therefore hold out your Wilderness-Temptation, and let none out-bid you, or take away the Crown from you. My Words forget not, the Spirit doth speak them.</p>

               <p>Upon this call into the Wilderness, it is shewn that Temptations would meet us, though high Manifestations of Love and Care would be here also expressed, for we are appointed to give eminent
<pb n="477" facs="tcp:29869:284"/>
proofs of Faith, as the forerunners of the Sealing Ministry of the Spirit, which still follows believing. But we must expect many an assault, as sometime upon one and the other, who are entred into this abstracted dedicated state. Therefore much more the vigilant Enemy doth make his onset upon us, as we daily do experience. As having lately some occasion to take notice of the Pulse of Faith, beating low in my Spiritual asso<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciate, whereby I was mutually touched, and thereupon moved to invocate, that our Faith might jointly be kept up, or else the Birth could not be perfected, as was shewn to me, which made me wrestle mightily. Upon which this Word was given to me for him, that sometimes an <hi>Elias</hi> might despond, and make request that his Life might be taken away, say<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, as <hi>Elias</hi> also, this Evil is from the Lord: what should I wait any longer in expectation, what am I better then my Fathers? All which over-casting Clouds will happen sometimes upon ye; what Faith could act higher then <hi>Elias,</hi> yet now in a fainting Fit, what lower? Thus it was set before me concerning the Dr. my Friend's heaviness, and sadness, which
<pb n="478" facs="tcp:29869:285"/>
sometimes seased him further. It was given to me for his Encouragement, that an <hi>Elias</hi> should yet be born through all hard onsets, to open the Heavens, and bring down the Blessings of Fruitfulness, upon the dry, languishing Earth within our selves, and power to open and unloose the Seals of that Spring, that shall make our solitary Habitation as the <hi>Eden</hi> of the Lord. Who will walk among the Stones of Fire, and commune with us, that so our Warfare may be all pleasant, till Time's Number for the full Mani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>festation shall be accomplished for us.</p>

               <p>Being driven in Spirit to withdraw, as into the Desert Mount, there apart from my self to be, as to the sensitive part, and to all things in the earthly Consideration.

to receive the high Throne Visitants, who will never appear but at such times and seasons, when we are able to clear our selves of this lower Sphear.

Which roused me out of my Sleep, and immediately I saw in the Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit this to pass before me, to wit, distinct Bodies, nothing of fleshly Matter, only like Corporeals in Figures, but the Substance was as if it had been transparent Glass, formed into the Idea of a Creature, so clear as if nothing but Crystalline Water had filled up every part of these Bodies. Then this Word did proceed as out of
<pb n="480" facs="tcp:29869:286"/>
them, Behold and see, these be generated each from one, and have their several Regions to walk in their appointed time.</p>

               <p>This Morning I was greatly sollicitous to understand the meaning of this Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sentation, which very readily and em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phatically opened its Mystery, as thus, there were three distinct Changes, which we were to pass into, before the highest Degree could be attained, as from Faith to Faith, still higher, and from Glory to Glory, as the Speaking Word said in me, Here see, what the several states are, which you must strive hard to get through, here are three Births of the Spirit, one still greater then the other. As this observe by him, who herein was your Pattern, who broke through all these Births Gates making way to give an assured hope, that ye may enter in by the same three<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fold Degree with your Jesus into every several Region, till lodged for Eternity into the one fixed Element with the bles<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed Trinity. No more Removes there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>from to make, for there is your everlast<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
<pb n="481" facs="tcp:29869:286"/>
Rest; but till this, the process of your Jesus you must keep in your Eye, and exactly follow. As now consider your selves with him, in the first Nativi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty of the Spirit, wherein the Christ-like Spirit is under Sufferings, lodged with Iniquity, oppressed with Infirmities, ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>noxious to the ruling Powers of the Stars, subject to the cruelty of the evil Rulers amongst Men, who exercise subordinate Power, under their H ad-Prince, in this worldly Region. Which your great high Apostle himself suffer'd under, paying the whole of what-ever could be challenged from him. For you must know, there is a Debt due from every one, which must be paid, though it was answered by that publick Representative in his own Person; being therefore offer'd up once for all, as a vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sible Sacrifice, and Propitiation for Sin; as that which was only to shew what was still successively to run from this Line of the New Birth of Christ in the Spirit. Now then there is no way to free your selves from the Tyranny of what Sin hath brought you under, but by yielding un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to the Death-mystical. Thereby the Debt will be discharged, and you set
<pb n="482" facs="tcp:29869:287"/>
free out of all that, which since the fall hath exercised Authority over you, and thereby you shall know the first forma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, into the clear and pure Airy Body: which will carry you, though obscurely, as Christ your Lord did, that shall here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out appear in another form, as he did when risen from the Dead, who did only to a few appear, discending from his Paradisical Sphear. Even so by the same quickning Spirit, pass over with your Jesus, till you arrive beyond <hi>Paradise,</hi> and come to assume that third Birth Degree, which alone is appropiated to the all-Ghostly-Trinity: which as in one, shall swallow up every lower Degree; that now must go forward in you, in order to this superiour Birth. Which only can be born out of these, who are as<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cended to Mount <hi>Sion,</hi> as the proper Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gion for the pure Virgin to travail with this Birth in. Oh it is so high, great, and principal, that out of this holy Cli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mate it cannot be manifested; therefore consider what holy separated and se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>questred Spirits, the hopes of this third degree of the Spirit's Birth, do call you, for to give up your selves unto? Faint not, but stick close unto that, which as
<pb n="483" facs="tcp:29869:287"/>
a munition of Rocks, will be to you for Strength, Light, and Counsel, till to this last degree of glory you shall be brought, and therein your Jesus will appear. Therefore do you set forward: be as those that are dead, and yet alive. Be Ye not any longer, but let the second Degree of the Spirit's Birth live in this very time of your attained process; having so far obtained the potent Power of the free willing Spirit, as this to effect by the Birth-Spirit, which is already born in you, which will so far perfect the Death, as to bring forth that Body of the Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>surrection. Which gradually proceeds from the Root of that Eternal Spirit which raised Christ from the Dead, this shall also be that generating Life-quick<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning Spirit in you, to bring forth the last and principal Birth-degree: which grow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing will be, till the compleat Death and Resurrection are passed through.

No Song of full Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demption can be sung, till this Kingdom of the Lamb and Bride mutually do meet.
<pb n="484" facs="tcp:29869:288"/>
The counsel of the Spirit is to you, who have this pure Unction Matter in you, that you give it all scope and liberty, for its further driving forth in you. For ye may be, as many who have gone forth in this generating Birth, but have stopped the Life-Vein, before it could come to breath in a risen Body all of pure Air.

Births there have been from the Fathers and Sons proper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty, as that of <hi>Isaac,</hi> and of Jesus in the Flesh, being figuratives, which have had their Mystery fulfilled.

               <p>It was further noted unto me, from that Vision of the three Spiritual Bodies, That all Discovery and Revelation of the Will and Mind of the D<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">

part. Who there will never cease to be a Speaking Oracle for Manifestation, if we stick closely to observe and obey what daily proceedeth herefrom. For it was said to me: Turn and dive deep in, for the Living Word is become a bub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bling Spring, that shall work out all m<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">
                     <desc>•…</desc>
                  </gap>d things: that would corrupt, and make void the Law of my Spirit; which henceforth to you, is to be a standing Rule. For all other ways and means for Information and Discourse, with the most Holy, are now ceased. God used and took up outward Figures to reveal his Mind by in former Ages and Times, as by the Ministration of Angels; and then by his Son; who came to reveal what was meet to be known and understood in that day of his visible Appearance in the World. Who could hardly bear to hear what was reported by him: who would have had as little credit in the World, as any now, if there had not been the Sealing Power of the God<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>head; by which the World was con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vinced, for Obedience to the Faith, which then was required. But this Ministration of Jesus shutting up, what must the Just now live by in these last
<pb n="489" facs="tcp:29869:290"/>
times? Your Jesus doth not turn you over to a dead Stock to live upon, as to what was done and written in his Day; but transferreth you over to a lively Mani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>festation, and fresh Openings from his Spirit's Birth in you. Whose leadings and drawings observed, it will further point you, to what may still be genera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted from Spirit to Spirit. Yet in a high<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er Birth-Degree, for that which is at first but a Spirit of Prophecy and Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>velation, will turn it self into a fixed Body. All which proportionably is to ascend into the New <hi>Jernsalem,</hi> for to bring it down in the transparent Ghostly Power. For when Spirit and Body do mutually agree together, and knit af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter the manner of that secret Formation, then it seeks its own Region to dwell in. For if the Trinity will appear among these low Inhabitants, then a Body must for them be prepared. Oh then see what the Light and Life-quickning hath yet in you to do; to wit, a travelling Work still, that as Jesus hath had his Birth<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formation, so now the Holy Ghost may be fully, formed; that so ye may not need to have a Star-Leader, or depend upon this way of Revelation that now you
<pb n="490" facs="tcp:29869:291"/>
are waiting upon. For you shall know in the first Root of knowledge, as God himself knoweth: But in the present time, the Spirit measureth out according as you are able to bear; which are but as Sprinklings, to what the broad Wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters shall co<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">

               <p>In the forepart of this Night, I was much pondering, and considering the weightiness of the Ghostly Formation, how difficult a thing it was, and hard to be by any brought forth: though many
<pb n="492" facs="tcp:29869:292"/>
have hard <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">

But as I was com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plaining, and owning our impotencies and unmeetness hereunto, this Word came: My Grace can make strong, where sence of the greatest Weakness is; there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore hope and believe down all Discou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ragements. Which Word much com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>forted and quieted me; and I fell asleep In which I saw a young Elephant that was to be bred up, and it was presented to be my care and charge to feed it. When I awaked, it was said to me, That as this Elephant for strength, so we should grow to be; And no burthen o<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">

For it was not but after much doubting, and long Examining, as I have said, that I came my self to be satisfy'd in this mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter: and therefore I can with the less diffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culty allow it in others. I'm indeed made truly sensible that Unbelief is that Sin which doth so easily Beset us: and ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving found it to be so in my self, I know how to pity it in any one else, and can't but think the Warning of the Author of the Epistle to the <hi>Hebrews</hi> against it, to
<pb n="494" facs="tcp:29869:293"/>
be as highly seasonable as it is little re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>garded. Its plain enough, that no other then this can be there understood, as well from the Context, and whole Design of the Apostle, as from the entire History of the Old and New Testament. For this very reason it is that we are encompassed about with such a Cloud of Witnesses, who exercising the most Heroical. Acts of Faith, were admitted to a more imme<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diate Conversation with the <hi>Divine Being,</hi> during their <hi>Pilgrimage</hi> on the Earth, and to a more illustrious Communication of his Light &amp; Love, then the Presumptuous and Incredulous Spirit of Human Reaso<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">

And certainly this very Sin, which so much hinders us in running this blessed Race, and from obtaining the same glorious Privileges which they Here obtain'd, is also a Sin that is easily to be <hi>avoided,</hi>
                  <pb n="495" facs="tcp:29869:293"/>
(as some you know would have it tran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>slated) if we can but reflect a little, ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to the direction here given us, either upon <hi>Enoch,</hi> or <hi>Noah,</hi> or <hi>Abraham,</hi> or <hi>Moses,</hi> or <hi>David,</hi> or any of those Worthies mention'd in the foregoing Chapter. And still much more if we do (as the Verse immediately following leads us to) but <hi>look up to Jesus the Author and Finisher</hi> of this Faith; who being the same Yesterday, to Day, and for ever, will not be wanting to work it in us, as he has wrought it in them; but conditionally that we do look unto him with a constant and fixed Eye. Upon which give me leave to say, for your Encouragement, as well as for my own, that there is a certain Person, well known to you and me, whose Angel did lately appear in full Day, in an upper Room, where a few Names were met together, to wait for the Promise of the Father, in the Latter Effusion of the Spirit: and these very Words were spoken by an Internal Speak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, which are the second Verse of this twelfth Chapter; and which therefore I the more heartily press upon you. Now as to that little Book, in particular, I <hi>freely</hi>
                  <pb n="496" facs="tcp:29869:294"/>
confess there may be several things in i<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">
                     <desc>•…</desc>
                  </gap> which may appear to be beneath the Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jesty of God, or against the Truth of the Holy Scriptures, before they are rightly and truly understood, and so may be apt to offend all those that are pos<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sessed with contrary Preventions. But if we have not Care, our Zeal will carry us much too far, and we shall soon effe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctually overthrow, as to us, that very Foundation which we would establish. This Excess of Anti-Enthusiasm is truly a most compendious method, of Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving the Boundaries of that we ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>knowledge Immoveable. For if we should be for throwing away our Bibles presently, when we are not able to answer all the Objections that a Scep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tical Wit is able to bring against them, as unbecoming the Divine Majesty, I am afraid but very few would be able to keep them long. Though indeed there be nothing in them, but what when ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prehended through, and according to the Spirit, by which they were written, i<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">
                     <desc>•…</desc>
                  </gap> most highly worthy of it: this yet mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters not. And if I should stay to receive any single Book either of the Old, or of the New Testament, till I were so well furnished, as to reconcile every Passage
<pb n="497" facs="tcp:29869:294"/>
with all the rest, it might be perhaps very long before I must admit some Books that are recognized to be Divinely Inspir'd. None can be more firmly per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>swaded then I am of the Truth of Saint <hi>Peter's</hi> Word, that the Heaven must re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive Christ till the Times of Restitution, but then I am not able to see how this does in any wise contradict his Internal Appearance and Speech to such Virgin Souls, as he has wash'd and sanctify'd in his Blood. Nay, I do not comphehend why he may not manifest himself in this manner to Thousands of Persons in as many distant Places at the same time; and never all the while come down from the Throne of his Glory in the Heavens: I dare not limit the Operations of his Spirit, which pierces every where, I had much rather adore them, and wait in a Child-like Disposition to be Disciplin'd by Him. And indeed when I consider the utter Impossibility to explain any thing of the Soul's Nature, without ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitting his immediate Causality and In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fluence, I do not think it so very strange to conceive that he should by opening the Inmost Center of that Principle or Life, which is his own Inbreathing,
<pb n="498" facs="tcp:29869:295"/>
reveal himself to it as Present, and hold therewith a very familiar Communica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion. And seeing it is undeniable that Christ since his Reception into Heaven, has actually both appeared and spoken to some Persons, by the Sacred Records themselves; it is no more difficult to sup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pose, that he may do so again when<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever he pleases: and it will be certain that this can never be the meaning of that Text which this Gentleman seems to un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derstand. He that has appear'd to Saint <hi>Paul</hi> and to Saint <hi>John,</hi> since his Glori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fication, and shown to them things which they knew not, and who has expresly declar'd, <hi>Behold I am with you to the end,</hi> can hardly methinks be supposed to have bound up himself for ever, not to manifest himself in the same or like man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner, by Vision, Intellectual Revelation, or Extasie, to any others while they are in these Mortal Bodies, for the sake of some Great and Glorious Good. Now what there is in all that Book, so far as it is said to come from him, which doth not directly tend to this end, and which is not highly becoming the Maje<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sty of God, I most profess I am not able to find, after the most curious Research
<pb n="499" facs="tcp:29869:295"/>
it is possible to make. As for those spe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cial and tender Endearments, which are us'd by Christ to his Church, and more immediately addressed to this holy Vir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gin standing in the Figure of it: They are sufficiently warranted by Scripture: and were they not, very much might be said to vindicate them. What-ever par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticular Objections he or you may have, I shall be ready to consider with all Meek<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness and Sobriety, when-ever they are produc'd. But I tell you before-hand, that it will be very hard to bring any, which were not brought against the antient Prophets in their time: and which may not be as easily remov'd from one as from the other. As for those com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon Imputations mention'd in yours, they have always been urg'd, and always been despis'd by Persons under the Lea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dings of the Holy Ghost. And I leave you to judge, as a Physician, whether all that is related in that Book can be accounted for by Fancy, Vapours, or Cerebrosity: more particularly what you read in these Sections, 11, 27, 31, 33.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="500" facs="tcp:29869:296"/>
For Mr. <hi>Mede</hi> I have indeed, a very great Deference, and too much ever to believe that he could intend to contra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dict himself, or do it in such a great Point as this, and not know it. All the World who have but look'd into him, or even but heard of his Name, must needs know what was his Sentiment as to the Glorious Reign of Christ: and if that Great and Judicious Man ranges the Mil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>luaries amongst Hereticks and Apostates of the Latter Times, it is easily to be gather'd that he could mean no others, then such who by their gross and un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>worthy Conceptions corrupted that very Truth which he so strenuously asserted. For if this be not a Truth, I know not any one you can make out from Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture. And I dare say that your Learned Friend must own that how much so<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever it may be exploded, it is yet a Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrine more clearly to be found in the most Primitive Antiquity, than the greater part of those which at this day so much divide the contending Parties of <hi>Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stendom.</hi> Now as for your Friend, whom you dare to trust, he is indeed a Disciple of Wisdom, and a Son of the Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phets, but he is yet but in a low Class,
<pb n="501" facs="tcp:29869:296"/>
and very young in this Heavenly Life. But could he Experimentally declare more then hitherto he can, it might not be very expedient upon many weighty Reasons so to do, till the great Effusion of the Miraculous Powers do make the way clear for such a Declaration: How<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever he can say that he is not a Stranger to the Baptism of the Holy Ghost, which is by Fire. He has seen the Fulfilling of some Prophecies already, and so is the better encourag'd to expect that of others. His Tryals, Deliverances, and all the secret part of his Life, both at home and abroad, has been strangely singular: and what God designs to do with him further, he knows not, but desires to stand entirely Passive to his Will.</p>
               <p>Now it remains that I should answer your Last Request, which concerns the distinguishing the Impetus of our own Imaginations from Divine Inspirations; which contains in it two Questions, <hi>1st,</hi> How the Persons themselves that are under them can distinguish them? And <hi>2dly,</hi> How others that have them not, are to judge concerning them? But of all that relates to this you may expect a Particu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lar Account by another way, in Answer
<pb n="502" facs="tcp:29869:297"/>
to some Queries that were proposed to me. And in the mean time I recom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mend to you for your Guidance, the very last Revelation in the Book. I have this only to say to the First, at present, that the Imagination ought to be perfectly mortify'd; the Death and Cross of Christ being the true Path to Illumination: And to the Second, That Care is to be taken, neither too hastily to Approve, nor too hastily to Reject; but to Try all Spirits, and to hold fast them that are Good, suspending to pass Judgment on those that are not understood. May the God and Father of your Spirit, enlighten it in his own good time, to his Glory, by the Internal Revelation of his Son Jesus Christ, through the Operation of his blessed Spirit, that works in you: that so by your own Experimental Conviction, you may be able to Convince others, and so by promoting that Divine Knowledge, whose Increase is foretold by the Prophet <hi>Daniel,</hi> you may shine as a Star in the Fir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mament of Wisdom.

                  <hi>Query.</hi> How are Spirits to be Discern'd.</head>
               <p>IF this Query refers to the Persons themselves, who are, or suppose them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves led by a Good Spirit, it is Answer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, That the Manner of Discernment is by Sensation, which is not to be de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>scribed. This Sensation like the New Song, the New Name, and the White Stone, they only who do experiment, and while they do experiment, are able to distinguish. But then it may be Que<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ried, How shall they who suppose them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves to be led by a True Spirit, and are not, be enabled to discern aright in this matter, since they are without this Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritual Sensation, by which the others are assur'd concerning the Truth of their Visions and Revelations? <hi>Ans.</hi> They are to seek for it of God, by a perfect Mortification of their own Wills, and especially as to these very supposed Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vours; and by most instant and violent Prayer. Thus some who upon the Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mission of an evilthing, have been depriv'd of the Good Spirit of God, which they did enjoy, and have been deliver'd up to a Spirit of Delusion for some time,
<pb n="504" facs="tcp:29869:298"/>
Satan all this while exactly Personating an Angel of Light, giving forth false Oracles, and opening a false Paradise up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on them; have been again restored to their former Enjoyments and Divine Sensation, the Scenes of the false Para<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dise made to drop into pieces, and the true One to Open, and the Evil Spirit forced to stand before the Angel whom he had Personated. If it be further Queried, Whether, and How, do those that are truly led by the Holy Spirit, dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cern the Spirits by which others are led? The <hi>Answer</hi> will be, That all are not able to do so, but only some that are ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riv'd to a very high Degree, and great Experience in the Supernatural Life. As for the Manner of Discerning, it is the same with respect to others as to them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves; there being no Mark so certain here as that of Internal Sensation. Thus Spiritual Things are spiritually discern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, felt, and received: and the Spirits of the Prophets are subject to the Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phets. But if in the last place it be de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manded, How then shall those who are Strangers to these Leadings of the Spirit, and who desire alike neither to fall into any Errour, nor to resist the Truth, be able to govern themselves in this Matter?

To this the Answer is very easie, That they are not to perplex themselves in this Inquiry, so long as they remain either Carnal, or Rational, but to endeavour by all means, according to the clear Path chalk'd out in the Scriptures, to become Sdiritual. To which State when they are arriv'd, they need not fear being able to judge or themselves: and if with respect to others they shall not be presently capable to judge, they can be under no apprehension of any danger, so they do but follow the pure Dictates of the Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit to themselves; and therefore they will desire this satisfaction, no further then as it shall be given them from Above. However even they who are not ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riv'd beyond the Rational Life, need not be much mistaken, while they con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinue so. For if that which is said to be Revealed, be of weighty concern either to that Particular Soul, or to the publick, and if it directly tend to Purity of Life, and to the Exaltation of God, and the Humi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liation of Man; then if it be not plainly disagreeable with what has been for Certain before Reveal'd, even they according to their meer Natural Reason ought not to slight it.</p>

               <p>NO other Foundation can be laid, that what Christ hath laid, for he hath laid himself in his Saints, to be established upon, whicn is the hidden Mystery of God: But to know and to feel Christ in us in his Burning Flaming Heart of Love by way of Wedlock and Marriage-Union, between the Soul and its Bridegroom; This is a deep Mystery, that few are counted worthy to comprehend. But all these Feelings, these foretasts of Divine Love, with ravishing Joys, do but leave us to the Warfaring State, against all our Spiritual Enemies, to conquor Hell, Sin, Eternal Death, Dragon, and all Hell-Devils, together with the Beast and the Earthly Life in our selves: for to the Conquerors, the Glassy Sea and the

New <hi>Jerusalem,</hi> as a reward will be gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven; for it will open within the Soul-Center. Let us remember our Calling: We were called to Fight with our inward Spiritual Enemies, for the Garland of Paradise, aad for the Garland of Flow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers, which were wont to be given to the Conquerors. And we are to contend for the the Crown of Pearl: which is Christ's per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect Deity in his Eternal Humanity in our Souls, we are yet to strive with all earnest<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness, for to obtain the Banner of Victory, over the Hell, Sin, Death, and Curse in our Souls; by reigning with the risen Lamb <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 word">

This will be our Reigning-Day indeed, when Hell, and Sin, and Death, and Mortality in us shall be swallowed up of Immortal Life and Glory: When we shall

know but one Heavenly Life, moving and acting through every form of the Soul. Seeing such a Ministration is left us by Christ, on this the Grave to be enjoyed, when the Seventh Angel shall sound his Trumpet, and it is so near us, and we near it; let us give all Diligence, all Watchfulness, all Labour for the Possession of it. Then Christ within us, and Christ without us will meet, in one Center of Glory; and both will make up but one Wonder.
