            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            <head>OF
Transubstantiation:
OR, A
REPLY
TO A
LATE PAPER,
CALL'D,
A Full ANSWER to Dr. Tenison's CONFERENCES
concerning the EUCHARIST.</head>
            <p>THese <hi>Transubstantiators,</hi> it seems, are
as apt to fancy one Man, as one thing
to be another; hence it is, that
they have turn'd the Publisher of the
<hi>Six Conferences,</hi> lately put out, into a <hi>French</hi> man;
for such a one, I am assur'd, was the Author
of those Dialogues. And therefore both this
Gentleman, and his Friend, who, he says, was
so good at guessing, must guess again. <hi>Transub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stantiation</hi>
is a Doctrine so absurd and ground<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>less,
that a man can never want Arguments
against it. But Protestants sensible of the good<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness
of their Cause, will sometimes give Over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plus
in reasoning with their Adversaries; and
when they have prov'd that there is no such Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrine
as that of <hi>Transubstantiation,</hi> reveal'd, they
next endeavour to shew <hi>ex abundanti,</hi> that 'tis
impossible it shou'd; if it were never so possi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble
it shou'd, yet it does not follow that it is.
Nor can Papists ever prove it, till they first
prove themselves Infallible in interpreting Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture.
For, as for those Words, <hi>This is my
Body, which is broken for you;</hi> 'tis evident that
they lye much more easy and naturally to be
interpreted in the Protestant than Popish Sense,
as some of their own Authors have been so in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>genuous
as to confess. So that here is a desperate
hard Task still lying upon 'em, were it grant<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
possible that such a thing shou'd be reveal'd.
But that that is impossible, may be thus made
out. It cannot be reveal'd, but by giving us
greater Evidence to think it true, than we
have to think it false. Now we prove it false
by the clear Evidence, both of Sense and
Reason. Of Sense, because all our Senses tell
us, that that is Bread, which if their Doctrine
be true, is not Bread, but the Body of a Man.
Of Reason, because that Faculty does assure
us as much as it can of any thing, that one and
the same Body cannot be in several places at
once, nor the whole Body of a Man crowd<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
into the compass of a Pins head, and that
still divisible into a great many more whole
Bodies, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> But here the Papists stop us
short, catching at one part of the Argument.
For, Sense, say they, may deceive us as it did
<hi>Abraham,</hi> who thought he saw Men, when he
saw Angels: And why then, if God will have
it so, may not we see the Body of Christ in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed,
when we think we see Bread? I an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>swer,
They that appear'd to <hi>Abraham</hi> in the
18<hi>th</hi> of <hi>Genesis,</hi> for ought that can be prov'd,
did for that time assume the real Bodies of
Men (it shou'd seem so by their eating.) And
<hi>Abraham</hi>'s Senses could only tell him that
they did appear like Men. If he thereupon
concluded immediately that they were Men,
he erred, and was led into the Error by his
Senses, which no one ever denied, but a Man
might be. But he might know (and did, 'tis
like, upon a little Reflection) that the Eye alone
was not sufficient to inform him at all times,
whether what looked like a Man, was one, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause
an Angel might assume and actuate a
humane Body. However, it is certain, that to
the making up of that Creature which we call
a Man, there goes something more than what
is visible to the Eye, <hi>viz.</hi> a humane Soul.
And whether that were there or no, or an Angel
in the room of it, was more than <hi>Abraham</hi> could
certainly discern by his Senses. But there is
not the same case in seeing of a piece of Bread,
because there is no ground to think there is
any thing in a piece of Bread, more than what
is discernable by Sense. To talk of a Substance
distinct from the Colour, Tast, Smell, and from
the very Quantity and Dimensions also, is but
a piece of Scholastick Nonsence. A Body has
<pb facs="tcp:51244:2"/>
the name of Bread given it, because its matter or
quantitative Dimensions (which is all one) have
such a certain Colour, Tast, Smell, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> from
the Concurrence or Combination of which, we
<hi>English</hi> Men agree to call it <hi>Bread,</hi> the <hi>La<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tins
Panis.</hi> Now to say, That a Body having
all these, whence by general Consent it is
wont to be called Bread, yet is not Bread; is
all one, as to say, That Bread is not Bread,
which <gap reason="illegible" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>s Nonsence and a Contradiction, and
we take <hi>Transubstantiation</hi> to be so, from one end to
the other.</p>
            <p>Suppose a man shou'd come and shew me a lit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle
black Dog, and shou'd face me down that it
was no Dog, but the City of <hi>Rome,</hi> nay, and
that that whole City was not onely crowded in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to
so little a compass, but that, cut him into ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver
so many pieces, still every Bit was the whole
City of <hi>Rome.</hi> If, I say, a man shou'd come and
tell me thus, sure this Gentleman would give
me leave to think he was out of his Wits. But
suppose then such a man as <hi>Xaverius,</hi> who <hi>A. Pul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ton</hi>
says had the Gift of Tongues (tho' he him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>self
complains sadly in one of his Epistles that he
had it not, and knew not what to do for want of
it, Ep. <hi>Iapan.</hi> 3. p. 30.) and raised Twen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty
five Persons from the Dead: Suppose, I say,
he shou'd come and work all these Miracles
which <hi>A. Pulton</hi> believes he did work, in my
sight, and so as to convince me of the Truth of
them, and when he had done, shou'd tell me
he wrought all these to convince me that that
same black Cur was no Dog, but the whole
City of <hi>Rome, &amp;c.</hi> as before. In this case, and
upon this mad impossible Supposition (for such
we must make, if we would draw a Parallel right)
tho' I were never so much convinced of the
Truth of his Miracles before, yet I must needs
tell him, Sir, you do but confound me. I be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieved
your Miracles to be true, because they
seemed so when I had examined them by Sense
and Reason as well as I cou'd. But if this into<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lerable
absurdity be that which you wou'd
prove by 'em, then I find my Sense and Rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son
signify nothing. And believe you, I cannot
after all; because I have as great, if not greater
evidence that this is but a Dog still, than I had,
or could have of the Truth of your Miracles.
Now let him shew that can, that in this suppo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sition
I have made, there are greater absurdities
than what are in <hi>Transubstantiation.</hi> But to make
it a Parallel case betwixt an Angel sometimes
appearing in humane shape, and not being di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>scern'd
from a man by the Eye, and a Bit of Bread
being turn'd in Ten thousand places, into the same
Natural Body of our Saviour, and every Bit of it
into the whole Body; and yet to all mens Senses
appearing to be nothing in the World but Bread
still; this certainly is a great extravagance.
And I must tell this Gentleman, that whereas he
says it might have been said to <hi>Abraham,</hi> Ask
your Eyes, ask your Nose, ask your hands—they
will all tell you, 'tis a man you see; herein
he says more than he can prove. For we have
no Reason to think that <hi>Abraham</hi> did either smell
to, or feel the Angels; and unless the Angels
did really take humane Bodies, I suppose, feel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
wou'd have discovered the Truth; because
our Saviour says, <hi>Handle me and see, for a Spirit
hath not Flesh and <unclear>Bones</unclear> as ye <unclear>see</unclear> me have.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>But this Gentleman charges the Doctor (his
falsly supposed Author of the Conferences) with
great ignorance in Logick, <unclear>for</unclear> reasoning in this
manner. <hi>If our Senses deceive us in the Report
they make of the Eucharist, they may as well de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive
us in every thing else.</hi> Now I confess I
see no ill Logick in this; for the <unclear>sequel</unclear> is easily
proved thus; Because our Senses report nothing
with clearer Evidence than they do in this mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
of the Eucharist. And how, I pray, is there
here an Universal drawn from a Particular?</p>
            <p>As for comparing <hi>Transubstantiation</hi> with the
Trinity, I wou'd desire this Gentleman to an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>swer
what has been already written in some
Dialogues lately printed on that Subject. Or let
him but shew us as good <unclear>Scripture-proof</unclear> for
<hi>Transubstantiation,</hi> as there is for the Trinity;
and try next whether he can load the Doctrine of
the Trinity, as deliver'd in Scripture, with as ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny
Absurdities as follow from <hi>Transubstantiation;</hi>
And then it will be time to consider, whether we
had best believe <hi>Transubstantiation,</hi> or turn <hi>Soci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nians.</hi>
But this will be a long while a doing. In the
mean time it is denied that the Doctrine of the
Trinity does at all contradict that Maxime, <hi>Quae
conveniunt in un tertio conveniunt inter se,</hi> in the
true sence of it.</p>
            <p>As for this Gentleman's way of dealing with
an Infidel, to make him believe <hi>Transubstantiation;</hi>
I must tell him, that if his Infidel understood
himself, it will prove insufficient. For, 1. Where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>as
he says that they agree, God sees Truths
which we cannot understand, and that he can
reveal those Truths; his Infidel may tell him,
That if there be any Truths repugnant to the first
Principles of all humane Knowledg, God must
give us other Faculties, before he can reveal such
Truths to us. And, 2. That he can never make
it appear, that the Moral Evidence he talks of, is
equal to the Moral Evidence we have of the fal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sity
of <hi>Transubstantiation.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Lastly, As for the Threatning Conclusion,
That the Doctor may chance to smart for attem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pting
the Destruction of their Church; If he
means in this World, let him say it plainly: If he
means in the next, he might know we fear not
that upon this Account. All the danger we fear
for opposing that Church (in this way of Dispu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation
and Reasoning) is wholly in this World;
in the other we believe they will be more in dan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger
to suffer for defending it.</p>
