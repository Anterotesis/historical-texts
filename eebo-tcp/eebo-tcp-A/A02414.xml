            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

<pb n="2" facs="tcp:6:6"/>
Chriſts boſome he leaned at Supper,<note place="margin">
                  <hi>Ioh</hi> 13.23.</note> and to him Chriſt at his death com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mended his Mother, ſo that wee may thinke that Chriſt did impart more to him then to the reſt: therefore ſhall wee finde in his Goſpell higher myſteries of the nature and workes of Chriſt then in the other: and in him alone we finde this myracle of raiſing <hi>Lazarus</hi>: which (if it bee lawfull to compare) may ſeeme to be the grea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teſt of all that Chriſt did whilſt hee was in this world. It is a ſtory not altogether vnbefitting this preſent occaſion, if it were not for the diſpa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity of the ſexe. Both of them treat of Funeralls. I will firſt tell you what this was in the Goſpell, and after I haue done with that, this preſent oc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>caſion ſhall bee preſented vnto you. I muſt not (in the relation of this Story) ſpend time vpon the ſeuerall circumſtances, wherein the Euange<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liſt is ſo exact; thats done at large in the Chapter: onely for introduction
<pb n="3" facs="tcp:6:6"/>
of this particular which wee haue in hand, ſome paſſages I will point out vnto you. Firſt, of the Perſon that was ſicke and dyed. Secondly, of the meanes his friends vſed for his reco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uery. Thirdly, of Chriſts comfortable ſpeech which he gaue vnto them.</p>
            <p>Firſt, for the Perſon, it was <hi>Laza<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rus,</hi> brother to <hi>Martha</hi> and <hi>Mary Magdalene,</hi> which waſhed Chriſts feet with her teares, and wiped them with her Haires, and anointed them with Ointment; this was his Kindred by nature; and by grace hee was ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>noured with the title, to be <hi>a friend of Chriſts,</hi> whom Chriſt more eſpecially loued. Thus euen <hi>they who are the moſt dearely beloued of Chriſt must looke for afflictions,</hi> and infirmities, and ſick<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe, and death in this world. <hi>La<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zarus</hi> whom Chriſt loued was ſicke. 2. His Siſters therefore vſe the beſt meanes they can whilſt hee was ſicke. For his recouery they ſend to Chriſt, to teach vs that <hi>we can ſue and ſeeke to
<pb n="4" facs="tcp:6:7"/>
none in compariſon of Chriſt in all our troubles.</hi> For as hee was reputed in thoſe dayes a great Phycitian for the body, who cured all diſeaſes: ſo is he for the ſoule too, to heale all our mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeries. 3. For Chriſts part, though he loued <hi>Lazarus,</hi> yet hee doth not pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſently come to cure him, but ſuffers him to dye. Hee abode two dayes in the place where hee was, till <hi>Lazarus</hi> was dead: from whence wee may note, that <hi>Chriſt ſuffers the euill of af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fliction to come vpon his ſeruants whom hee loues, rather then preuents it with grace</hi>; and then alſo he doth not pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſently relieue them, but ſuffers them to ſend and pray, as theſe Siſters did here: and as <hi>Iacob</hi> wreſtled with God, and Saint <hi>Paul</hi> prayed thrice. And this he doth for diuers cauſes, both to manifeſt our grace and his glory. Our faith and loue to him by this meanes will expreſſe themſelues the more: and this alſo will more manifeſt his glory in bringing downe to Hell and
<pb n="5" facs="tcp:6:7"/>
the graue, and then bringing againe to life. If Chriſt had come at the firſt and healed his ſickneſſe, an ordinary Phyſitian haply could haue done as much: but though he tarry long, yet at laſt hee comes and ſhewes the gra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cious light of his countenance vpon vs<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> ſo that now you ſhall heare him with comfortable words, ſpeaking both to his Apoſtles in priuate, and afterward to the Siſters when they come to meet him: to his Apoſtles he ſaith, <hi>Our friend Lazarus ſleepeth:</hi> ſo that <hi>if wee can get friendſhip with Chriſt, our death ſhall bee but a ſleepe,</hi> and Chriſt will certainely awake vs from it at the reſurrection of the iuſt. So Chriſt goes forward to the houſe of mourning, where the Iewes were comforting the Siſters for the death of their brother <hi>Lazarus.</hi> But they were like <hi>Rachel</hi> mourning for her children, <hi>they refuſed to bee comforted</hi> becauſe their brother <hi>Lazarus</hi> was not. When <hi>Martha</hi> heard that Chriſt
<pb n="6" facs="tcp:6:8" rendition="simple:additions"/>
was comming on the way, ſhe went forth to meete him: few ſuch <hi>Mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thaes</hi> who meet Chriſt comming to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward them, we rather flye from him. When ſhee was come to Chriſt, ſhee tells him with a heauy heart of the death of her brother <hi>Lazarus,</hi> which his preſence might haue preuented. Chriſt therefore, in the words I haue read vnto you preacheth a comforta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble Sermon, to pacifie the friends of the deceaſed, that they ſhould not ſorrow as thoſe without hope; and tells <hi>Martha</hi> that her brother <hi>Lazarus</hi> (though he be dead) ſhall riſe againe. And that ſhe may not doubt of it, hee addes, That he will bring it to paſſe, not onely for <hi>Lazarus,</hi> but for all o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther deceaſed in the faith: and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore he ſayes, <hi>I am the reſurrection and the life, he that beleeueth in me, though he were dead, yet ſhall he liue; and who<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſoeuer liueth and beleeueth in mee ſhall neuer dye.</hi> So that the words of the Text which I haue read vnto you are
<pb n="7" facs="tcp:6:8"/>
a gracious and a large Charter or pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſe of Chriſts, wherwith he comforts <hi>Martha</hi> for her particular, and grants the ſame in generall to euery one of vs: In which is comprehended no leſſe then the ſumme or Epitome of the Goſpell, which is, To beleeue in Chriſt, and we ſhall be ſaued.So it is ſaid,<note place="margin">
                  <hi>Ioh.</hi> 3.16.</note> 
               <hi>God ſo loued the world that hee gaue his onely begotten Sonne, that who<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſoeuer beleeueth in him ſhould not periſh but haue euerlaſting life.</hi> All the Goſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pell can ſay no more, and ſo much is ſaid in theſe words that I haue read vnto you, <hi>whoſoeuer liueth, &amp;c.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>The Law and the Goſpell are as two lines tending to the ſame Center, or as diuers Riuers leading to the ſame Ocean, or as the Cherubins on each ſide of the Throne: though they ſee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med oppoſite one to the other, yet both of them looked with their faces towards the mercies Seat: ſo the Law and the Goſpell intend and aime at one and the ſame end, which is to
<pb n="8" facs="tcp:6:9"/>
bring men to life; but the difference is in the Author and in the tenure of the one and the other: the Author of the Law was <hi>Moſes; Chriſt</hi> of the Goſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pell.<note place="margin">

               <hi>The Law was giuen by Moſes, but grace and truth came by Ieſus Chriſt.</hi> The tenure of the Law runnes thus: <hi>Hoc fac &amp; viues: Doe this and thou ſhalt liue.</hi> But the Goſpell goes ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther way: <hi>Crede &amp; viues: Beleeue and thou ſhalt liue.</hi> And thus in this Text, <hi>whoſoeuer liueth and beleeueth in mee ſhall neuer dye.</hi>

            <p>In the words we will conſider theſe foure particulars:</p>
            <p>Firſt, the <hi>Author</hi> or Donour of this Charter, <hi>Christ.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Secondly, the large <hi>extent</hi> of it, next onely to ſome particular Nation or people, but <hi>whoſoeuer liueth.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Thirdly, the <hi>Condition</hi> requiſite on their parts, which is faith; <hi>Beleeueth in me.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Fourthly, the <hi>Priuiledge</hi> it ſelfe, ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>emption from death; <hi>ſhall neuer dye.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <pb n="9" facs="tcp:6:9"/>Firſt, of the <hi>Author</hi> or Donour. Hee that promiſeth and intendeth to performe, muſt haue both will and power to performe what hee promiſeth: or elſe wee cannot ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpect that it will euercome to paſſe. The willingneſſe of the minde muſt bee firſt procured, as the originall from whence hee muſt be moued to good: but this ready minde or deſire is not ſufficient without power and ability to performe what the will deſires. From men ſometime God accepts the will for the deed: as hee did <hi>Abrahams</hi> intention to ſacrifice his ſonne as well as the action; as if he had really ſacrificed his ſonne. The reaſon is, becauſe God ſtands in need of nothing that is ours, and all that hee exacts of vs is no more but the heart: if there be not further ſtrength to expreſſe a good deſire by a good deede;<note place="margin">2 <hi>Cor</hi> 8.12.</note> 
               <hi>a man ſhall bee accepted accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding to that which hee hath, not accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding to that which he hath not:</hi> but
<pb n="10" facs="tcp:6:10"/>
when there is want and neceſſity (and euen ſuch is our want and neceſſity in reſpect of God) there onely a willing minde or compaſſionate heart or good words <hi>(Vox &amp; preterea nihil)</hi> are ſufficient for vs. Many promiſe more then they can performe. Thus the Deuil in his temptation of Chriſt ſaith,<note place="margin">

               <hi>All theſe will I giue thee if thou wilt fall downe and worſhip me,</hi> as if all the Kingdomes in the world, and the glory of them, had beene his to giue. In like manner the <hi>Pope</hi> freely diſpo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeth Kings and their Kingdomes, as hee dealt with <hi>Henry</hi> the fourth, the Emperour, and <hi>Childerick</hi> of France. But this is (as we ſay) to be <hi>free of ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther mans purſe,</hi> which is not in his power to giue. Thus it were eaſie to giue large gifts, to promiſe much and performe nothing: ſo that both will and power in matter of grant or pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſe are as the two legs to ſupport the body: either without the other, will goe lame or limping home: but
<pb n="11" facs="tcp:6:10"/>
this is our comfort, that in Chriſt there are both theſe, Will and Power. Firſt, for his Will: the Apoſtle tells vs,<note place="margin">1 <hi>Tim.</hi> 2.4.</note> that <hi>he would haue all men come to the knowledge of the truth, that they may be ſaued.</hi> And if we will not take him on his bare word wee haue his oath for it.<note place="margin">

Hence in the Church Catho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tique, the company of beleeuers are of all people, and kinds, and kindreds that liued in the world: ſo that the Law was like a Torch or Candle, but the Goſpell as the Sunne. The Law (ſaid <hi>Dauid</hi>) was <hi>a Lantherne to his feet,</hi>
               <note place="margin">
                  <hi>Pſal.</hi> 119.105.</note> but the Goſpell is as the beames of the Sunne, which <hi>com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>meth out of his chamber and goeth to the ends of the earth,</hi> giuing light vnto all people. Thus is the light of Chriſt the Sunne of righteouſneſſe, as the beames of the Sunne which ſhineth to all; and if any one doe not partake of that light, it is becauſe they ſhut their eyes againſt it: ſo ſeeing they doe not perceiue nor vnderſtand, leaſt they ſhould ſee, beleeue and bee ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ued.

none, comprehending all, <hi>who<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſoeuer liueth</hi>; vpon condition that he <hi>beleeueth.</hi> By faith he partakes of the priuiledge.

Faith is the Chanell by which it is drawne and diſperſed ouer all the world, and makes the earth to bee fruitfull as <hi>Eden,</hi> the Garden of God. The eternall fauour and goodneſſe of God is as the Fountaine, Chriſt is the Wel or Ceſterne, and Faith is the Bucket whereby we draw from Chriſt liuing waters. <hi>He that beleeues in him ſhall neuer dye</hi>: So that when wee ſay, Faith is the condition of life and ſalua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, you muſt note that it is not ſuch a condition, as we vſually make in Bonds and Obligations, and bargaine and ſale, which runnes in this tenure, Vpon conſideration of ſomething of equall value, wee become bound for the performance of ſuch Couenants: as if the condition of faith ſhould bee worth Heauen.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="21" facs="tcp:6:15"/>It is not for the worth of our faith, put for the merit of Chriſt, that the faithfull ſhall never dye eternally. And therefore the Scripture phraſe runnes thus; <hi>By faith,</hi> and <hi>through faith wee are iuſtified.</hi> Not for faith, but for Chriſt apprehended by faith. So that it is not faith as an habite, or worke in the ſoule, as other graces, loue and pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tience, &amp;c. which is of equall worth and vertue to preſerue vs that we pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riſh not, but it is Chriſt alone, who yet hath no vertue or operation in our ſalvation, and redemption without beleeving on our parts, to apply him to vs: no more then phyſicke can cure a deadly diſeaſe, or cloth affoord any warmth to our bodies, if they be not both applyed vnto vs: ſo that the Charter runneth betweene God and man, like as if a King ſhould grant a great priuiledge to his ſubiects, which they ſhould not purchaſe at a hard price, or with a great ſumme, but one<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly vpon condition to acknowledge
<pb n="22" facs="tcp:6:16"/>
him their ſoueraign Lord from whom they had receiued ſuch great immuni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties: which is a point of great comfort to the Chriſtian weake in faith: be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe it is not for the worth or excel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lencie of our faith that we muſt thinke to ſtand. Though a ſtrong faith is an excellent grace, which will make vs as a Rocke, or as houſes built vpon the ſure Rocke Chriſt: the ſtormes and ſea and windes of temptation and af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fliction may beat, but they ſhall not be able to ouerthrow vs, becauſe wee are built vpon a Rocke: yet a little and feeble faith, which with feare &amp; trem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bling layes hold vpon Chriſt ſhall neuer periſh, becauſe it is not the dig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nitie of faith, which conueyes the be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nefit vnto vs: but the worth, excel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lency &amp; ſufficiencie of Chriſt, which is apprehended by faith. It was not for the vertue of the eye which looked vp to the brazen ſerpent that men were healed, that had been ſtung with fierie Serpents; the weakeſt eyes
<pb n="23" facs="tcp:6:16"/>
as well as the moſt ſharpe ſighted, if they could but look vp to it, were hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led: and the begger which receiues a gift may be fully poſſeſſed of it, euen with a trembling and ſhaking hand, as well as he that hath the moſt ſtedfaſt hand.

out vnder the Ceremoniall Law, in the coniunction of the ſin-offering which pointed out Chriſt, and the burnt-offering, which (as Saint <hi>Paul</hi> hath interpreted it) more eſpecially ſignifieth the ſacrificing of the fleſh, the crucifying of the old <hi>Adam.

the priuiledge here granted. <hi>Exemp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion from Death.</hi> Death hath a three<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fold: acception. It is either naturall, ſpirituall, or eternall. Whoſoeuer beleeueth in Chriſt is exempted from all theſe. The two later onely haue properly the name of Death. For Death, to ſpeake properly, is either a ſeparation from God here in his Kingdome of grace, or a ſeparation from him hereafter in his Kingdome of glory. Not to partake of his ſauing grace here in this world, is to bee ſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritually dead; and not to be crowned with his glory in the world to come, is to be eternally dead. They who haue onely <hi>vitam naturae,</hi> the life of nature here in this world, and haue not <hi>vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tam gratiae,</hi> the life of grace, are ſpiri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tually dead, according to that of the Apoſtle,<note place="margin">1 <hi>Tim.</hi> 5.6.</note>

For as they who enioy natural life are ſaid to bee dead, becauſe they are depriued of the ſpirituall life: ſo they who are naturally dead may be ſaid to be aliue, becauſe they enioy the life of glory.

Such reſpect did this Gentlewo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man beare to the Miniſterie of Gods Word, that when it was told her that her ſuter had diuerted his ſtu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dies to Diuinitie, and intended to bee a Preacher, ſhee anſwered, <hi>I am ſo farre from diſliking a man of that profeſsion, as of all other cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lings, I moſt deſire an Husband, being o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>therwiſe well qualified, of that function.</hi> A pious minde in a maiden ſo yong, and in a Gentlewoman of ſo good meanes as ſhee was! To her eter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nall comfort ſhee had her deſire ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>compliſhed. And anſwerably did ſhee carie herſelfe, <hi>A pious, prudent, prouident, painfull, carefull, faith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full, helpfull, graue, modeſt, ſober, tender, louing Wife, Mother, Miſtris, Neigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bour.</hi> Many were the graces which made her acceptable in Gods ſight, a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miable in her Husbands eyes, &amp; com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mendable among all that well knew

her. But that I may keepe my ſelfe within ſome bounds, I will eſpecially inſiſt on foure, wherein ſhee made her ſelfe a patterne worthy of admiration and imitation; Theſe were <hi>Sobrietie, Sedulitie, Charitie, Piety.</hi>

                  </gap>, an entire louer of her husband, and children. Her loue to her Husband made her to yeeld all dutifull reſpect to him, and to bee very carefull ouer him, and that both well to nou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riſh and cheriſh him, and alſo to free him from the trouble of all thoſe things which ſhee in her place could manage: For ſhee moſt prudently and
<pb n="44" facs="tcp:6:28"/>
prouidently ordered the affaires of her houſe, whereby hee had the more lea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure to attend his publike function. Her loue to her Husband was further ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nifeſt by that delight ſhee tooke in his company: It was grieuous to her to be where he was not, except vrgent &amp; neceſſary imployments required as much: neither did ſhe care her ſelfe to goe abroad vnleſſe her Husband went with her. And when they were abſent one from another, they made a ſupply of that bodily abſenee by continuall entercourſe of Letters one to another, in which Letters ſhee teſtified much pietie, wiſdome and loue. If at any time he had beene ſicke, ſhee was very tender ouer him, and very carefull to prouide all things needfull for him in that caſe. Her entire loue to him was many wayes teſtified to the very laſt act of her life. The longer they liued together, the more did this loue ſhew it ſelfe.</p>
               <p>Her care ouer her children did
<pb n="45" facs="tcp:6:28"/>
alſo declare her true loue of them. She did not onely beare them, and bring them forth into the world, which ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſitie forceth all mothers to doe, but with her owne milke ſhe nurſed ſeuen, as many as poſſibly ſhee could, which too many mothers doe too much neg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lect. It was not ſore nipples or breſts, nor an Infants wrangling, nor brea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king her ſleepe in the night, nor any other diſturbance that could make her neglect this bounden dutie. Her ten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derneſſe ouer her children was not di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miniſhed by their growth in yeares: yet as they encreaſed in vnderſtanding, ſo wiſely ſhee ordered her authoritie ouer them, as with a child-like feare they much reuerenced her. For well ſhe knew how to keepe both children and ſeruants in dutifull awe. As ſhee was carefull well to nouriſh, ſo alſo well to nurture her children. In nurtu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring them, though ſhe were not negli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gent of their ciuill behauiour, &amp; good manners, yet her greateſt care and
<pb n="46" facs="tcp:6:29"/>
paines was like <hi>Eunice,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">2 <hi>Tim.</hi> 1.5. <hi>&amp;</hi> 3.15. <hi>Eph.</hi> 6.4.</note> to <hi>bring them vp in the nurture and admonition of the Lord,</hi> teaching them, ſo ſoone as they were capable, the Principles of Religi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, wherein ſome of them ſo profited, as before they were three yeares old, they were able diſtinctly to anſwer all the queſtions of a Catechiſme which her Husband publiſhed. Many good inſtructio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>s alſo from time to time they receiued from her after they were put forth,<note place="margin">Prou <hi>31.1.</hi>
                  </note> wherein ſhee ſhewed her ſelfe like the good mother of <hi>Lemuel.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Her poore Neigbours alſo, as ſhee had notice of their need, taſted of her charity: for very ready ſhee was and forward to viſite the ſicke, and to ſend them ſuccour. It was her vſuall pra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctiſe, on the Lords dayes ſpecially, to ſend ſome hot, wholſome refreſhing to ſuch as needed it.</p>
               <p>This her charity extended it ſelfe alſo to ſtrangers. For where ſhe had a quarterly allowance of her Husband for her owne proper vſe, ſhe ſet a part
<pb n="47" facs="tcp:6:29"/>
a good part therof for charitable vſes, and ſo dedicated it to that purpoſe, as ſhe accounted it ſacriledge to imploy any part thereof to any other vſe. Out of this ſacred ſtocke ſhe was ready to contribute to all charitable motions made in the Church: to all priuate Collections made knowne vnto her; and to many, that time after time came to her Husband for reliefe, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſides thoſe, whom ſhe her ſelfe, with her owne hands, of her owne motion relieued. So as herein alſo ſhee was like to that good woman whom the wiſeman thus commendeth,<note place="margin">
                     <hi>Prou.</hi> 31. 20.</note> 
                  <hi>She ſtret<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cheth out her hands to the poore.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="4">4. Her Piety, as it was the beſt of her graces, whereby all the reſt were ſeaſoned, ſo was it not leſſe eminent then the reſt. For ſhe was a conſcio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nable obſeruer of the Lords Day, and a conſtant frequenter of the weeke day Lectures where ſhe inhabited. Shee did both her ſelfe diligently and reuerendly attend to the dayly exer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciſes
<pb n="48" facs="tcp:6:30"/>
of piety in her houſe, and alſo cauſed her children and ſeruants to do the like. She had alſo her ſet houres euery day, which ſecretly betwixt God and her ſelfe ſhee ſpent in holy De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uotions. With her owne hand ſhee penned ſundry deuout Prayers, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of ſome being for helps to humble her ſoule the more before God, were very large. She hath alſo left written by her ſelfe many diuine directions for Deuotions. She further tyed her ſelfe by a ſet dayly taske to reade the holy Scriptures, whereby ſhe was able rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dily to anſwer any queſtion propoun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded about the Hiſtory and Doctrin of the Scriptures. Shee did alſo ſpend much time in reading Engliſh books of diuinity, whereof ſhee had a pretty Library. She carefully put in practiſe this precept of the Apoſtle to wiues, <hi>Let them aske their Husbands at home.</hi>
                  <note place="margin">1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 14 35.</note> Her piety left her not till her breath left her. For (to come to the time of her ſickneſſe and departure) being long
<pb n="49" facs="tcp:6:30"/>
weake before her departure, and great with Childe, ſhee was diſabled from doing ſo much worke as in her health ſhe vſed to do, yet was ſhee not idle, but ſpent the more time in reading &amp; conferring with her Husband, and that eſpecially, about euidences of true grace, and aſſurances of ſaluati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on. It pleaſed the Diuine prouidence about a yeere and a quarter before, when ſhee was great with Childe, to viſit her with a Dropſie, though ſhee was very temperate in her diet, no Wine bibber. Of her Liuer ſhe com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plained from her youth, ſo as queſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>onleſſe her ill-diſpoſed Liuer was the cauſe of her diſeaſe. After her deliue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry of that Childe, thorow Gods bleſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing on the meanes, which her good Neighbour, Maſter Doctor <hi>Argent,</hi> an ancient, experienced, and skilfull Phyſician preſcribed, ſhe was recoue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red: and continued very well from September, 1624 till Febr following, when conceiuing againe with Child,
<pb n="50" facs="tcp:6:31"/>
the Dropſie returned againe. Not<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>withſtanding the returne of that Diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eaſe, ſhe was on the ſixt of October 1625 deliuered of her thirteenth and laſt Childe, which was a ſonne, and retained ſuch ſtrength as ordinarily ſhee was wont to doe in the time of her Childbed, ſo as on the baptizing day ſhe ſate vp, as women in that time vſe to doe. But before ſhee gathered ſuch ſtrength as might enable her to take Phyſicke for her Diſeaſe, death began to ſeaze vpon her. For on the very day wherein the foreſaid Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctor <hi>Argent</hi> had preſcribed ſuch Phy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſicke as was fit for one in her caſe, which was the fourteenth day after her deliuery, the violence of her Diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eaſe was ſuch, as accuſtomed reſt, and vſe of vnderſtanding was taken from her. This made her talke much: but in all her talke not an impious word came from her. (Her tongue was ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uer accuſtomed thereto) But that it might appeare how faſt fixed, and
<pb n="51" facs="tcp:6:31"/>
deeply rooted piety was in her, in her greateſt weakneſſe and extremity, if any Broth, Drinke, or other ſuſtenance were offered her, ſhe would lift vp her eyes to Heauen, and craue a bleſſing of him whom ſhe knew to be aboue. In that her reſtleſſe time, ſhe was much perſwaded by her Husband to doe what he aduiſed. To ſhort queſtions, eſpecially about her Chriſtian faith &amp; hope, ſhe would giue ſhort, but very pithy and comfortable anſwers. Af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter ſhe had thus remained two whole dayes, it pleaſed the Lord to giue ſome reſt, whereby for two dayes ſhe reco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uered good vſe of her vnderſtanding, and made good vſe thereof, by giuing many good euidences of her ſted faith in Ieſus Chriſt. Which after ſhe had done, the former violence of her Diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eaſe returned vpon her, and ſoone de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>priued her of her ſweet breath. Thus would God take her away euen in her calling, in the time of her Child-bed, wherein for a woman to dye, is as for
<pb n="52" facs="tcp:6:32"/>
a Souldier to dye in battell; yea, as for a Preacher to dye in the Pulpet<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> They that in Scripture are recorded to dye in that time, are recorded to dye as Saints, as the Wiues of <hi>Iaakob</hi> and <hi>Phinehas</hi>: and ſo vndoubtedly did this pious Matron; whoſe ſoule, euer in that moment wherein by Prayer it was commended to God, aſcended to God, with whom ſhe now, as we haue great and iuſt cauſe to hope, raigneth in euerlaſting glory: whether God bring vs alſo in our time, thorow Ie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſus Chriſt our Lord, to whom with the Father and the holy Ghoſt bee all honour and glory, now and for euer. <hi>Amen.</hi>
