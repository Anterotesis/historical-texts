         <editorialDecl>
            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            <p>WHEREAS it is very plain and evi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent unto all whose Eyes are clear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly open, that this is a day of great Brightness and Glory, wherein the Great and Invisible God hath ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peared in a most Glorious, and Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venly manner: And the Light of Heaven hath so shined that it exceedeth the very Light of the Sun, and all o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther natural lights whatever: And great and Glorious Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>velations from the Great and Almighty God, is seen and witnessed through the Glorious appearance and coming of our Lord Jesus Christ: Whose coming to as many as Faithfull are, have experienced to be in Power and great Glory; which gives us the true knowledge of God the Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, whom to know is life eternal: And thus we come to the true understanding of the great Mystery of Godliness: Through the inspiration of the Almighty. So that now we being as men awakened out of the great sleep of sin, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in we were in times past, with many more, held in great Cap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tivity and darkness; but being turned to the light, in it we come to see our way to God: And so come to wait upon him,
<pb n="4" facs="tcp:41210:3"/>
to be taught by him; who is the best teacher that ever man had for by his teachings, who is pure and holy: we that were unlearned, come truly to learn and know the great Myste<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries of Godliness: and such as were ignorant, and knew not the things of God, comes to be made wise unto Salvation; and thus we come to have good and sound experience of the good work of God upon our Hearts and Soules; for it's the Lord alone that works the Change in us; and that fits and prepars us for his own Service, and for the perform<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing that duty that he requires of us; for the Lord God is the good Husband-man, and we are of his Husbandry; and he is the good and perfect workman, and we are his workman<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ship, created in Christ Jesus unto good works: So that here is the Effects of the Husbandry and workmanship of this good and perfect workman; which is no other then the most Holy God, working in us through his beloved Son Christ Jesus the works of Salvation, Sanctification and Redemp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion; all which are the good and perfect works of God in his Son Christ Jesus: And all these good and perfect works they are wrought in the light (where the Devil, the imper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect worker cannot come, nor his Ministers, without tnrning from sin) and by walking in the light as Christ our Lord is in the light, we come to see more light, by which the Thief, this wicked one, the Devil, that would steal our Hearts &amp; minds away from the pure God who is light; he comes to be seen over and to before he was: and by Christ the Light, the works of the Devil are destroyed; and so he is discovered in all his wiles, although he appears never so fairly and speci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ously in what disguise transforming or pretence soever; yet in the light by which we see, discover and distinguish, all Colours and things whatever he is seen and discovered in all his Ministers and Messengers to be as he is, Anti-christ, a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainst Christ Jesus, opposing and gain-saying his coming &amp; appearance in all his Servants, Ministers and Messengers; for how hath he risen up in all sorts of Professors and people in
<pb n="5" facs="tcp:41210:3"/>
whom (he) this wicked and imperfect worker had any pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er and rule against the Blessed appearance and second co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ming of our Lord Jesus, whose coming is without sin unto Salvation: And with what Bitterness, Cruelty and Enmi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty hath all Nations, Tongues and People who are crying out against perfection, (and who have not the mark of God in their fore-heads) how have they been stirred up and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flamed with Rage and madness against the Saints of the most high, and against the coming and Raign of the Lamb who takes away the sins of the World, and whose Right it is to Raign: And he must and will Raign, until he hath put down all Rule and Authority under his feet; and he alone must be Exalted, who is King of Kings, and Lord of Lords, and Head of his Church through all the World: I say his coming hath been and is as with thunderings and lighten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings and terible Earthquakes, not onely to shake the Earth, but the Heavens also, and he caused the Firmament to melt before him and pass away as a scrole; and so his coming is in Light, in Power &amp; in great Glory: by whom all the wick<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, the disobedient and Rebellious ones must be called to an account, and must answer before him the great and Just Judge of all the Earth; who will Judge both Quick &amp; Dead: I say, before his great Tribunal Seat of Judgment, must all the scoffers and scorners, with all the rest of the whole ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble of the wicked, the Rebellious and gain-sayers too, to give an account for all the hard, wicked and ungodly speeches that they have wickedly spoken, and for all the cruel wick<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed and ungodly deeds that they have wickedly done against the Lamb and his followers: and amongst the many oppo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sers of the Gospel and gain-sayers of the Truth and Power of Godliness, I find not one more ripe in envy, and that wicked work of the Serpent, then <hi>Iohn Pennyman, who once was con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vinced in some measure of the pure Truth of God; but finding the way too straight, and not being willing to bear the yoke of Christ; nor yet liked to retain God in his knowledge, so he is given
<pb n="6" facs="tcp:41210:4"/>
over to a Reprobate mind, and is led away with many strange de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lusions; that the Evil Spirit that went out of him, and walked in dry places is returned to his house again; and finding it swept and garnished hath taken with himself seven other Spirits worse than the former, and the last Estate of that man is worse then the first; and in this bad State and Condition, he is fretting, labouring and scrib<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling against the pure and Blessed Truth, speaking evil of things he knows not, Revileing the Saints of the most high, uttering many Blasphemies against them that dwell in Heaven; and this doth not satisfie him neither; but he must Rake into the Ashes of the dead; and gather together the old Letters and papers of strife and conten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion which</hi> Rob. Rich <hi>and</hi> John Perrot <hi>gave forth in a time when great darkness was over them both: for they went from the Light into darkness; having been once convinced of the way of Life and Truth they like Hipocrites (turned from the grace by which they were called) into wantonness, and so went out from us, that it might be known they were not of us, and turned again with the dog to his vomit, joyning with the Rotten Principles of the Ranters.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>And as for <hi>Iohn Perrot</hi> who had once tasted more then the other of the good work of God, and of the Powers of the World to come: Yet he with <hi>Corah</hi> and his Company gain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sayd and withstood the Spiritual appearance of Christ a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mong the Saints and people of God, and with his strange Prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciples and whimsies, (as the keeping on his Hat in his Pray<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers to God and the like) he grieved the People of God, and prov'd a great trouble amongst the Faithfull, because with his flattery &amp; faigned humility he deceived the hearts of the sim<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple; the which I can speak by experience. So when he saw that he was seen through here in <hi>England,</hi> then he would needs go over into <hi>Barbadoes</hi> contrary to the good Counsel and ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vice of Friends; he having been a long time, yea several years from his Wife and family before, and then had but been a little time with her; And not having sufficient of his own to maintain his Wife and Family, and bear his own Charge &amp; great Expence in travelling, some Moneys he bor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rowed
<pb n="7" facs="tcp:41210:4"/>
here in <hi>England,</hi> &amp; when come to <hi>Barbadoes</hi> he got into the affections of some Friends there, who gave him very Libe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rally and bought him a Sloop, which came down to <hi>Iamaica</hi> sull Fraighted with the Gifts of Friends from the <hi>Barbados,</hi> (for him and <hi>Robert Mailins,</hi> who was too much tainted with the Rotten Principles of the Ranters, and proved a Castaway as well as he) and thus from time to time he was even Loa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded with the Love and Kindness of Friends, in hopes he would become a Reformed Man again but he like an unhappy and unworthy Man abused all the kindness of Friends and the very Mercies of God unto him (for I was at <hi>Iamaica</hi> when he came there, and while he lived and dyed there and when he came down thither first, he made a great show of love to us, and of Humillity and self-deniall, and the like: but it was soon manifest what his Heart run after: for he loved and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lighted in the Company of the Loose, Debaucht &amp; Prophane People of the World more then ours. Ah! many a night have I and others sate up with aking hearts waiting for him, being desirous to a had his Company from amongst such a Lewd Crew, which would be so loud with Singing, Leaping and Danceing, &amp;c. that we could hear them at a great distance off; so then he having gotten several hundred pounds worth of goods that Friends from other parts had given him and trusted him with together, Poor Man! he Bragged and Swaggered too much what great matters he would do for the <hi>Island</hi> and <hi>Planters,</hi> &amp;c. and went to them into the Fields of a Generall Muster day, when that part of the Country was generally met together in <hi>arms,</hi> and there at the Head of the <hi>regiment</hi> he made a <hi>Large</hi> Speech, <hi>What he would do for the Country,</hi> and withal gave them directions, <hi>How they should Plant their Tobacco for him,</hi>
               <note place="margin">Note, The Tobacco of that Country was generally Bad, and a great Drugg.</note> 
               <hi>and he would take it off their Hands</hi>: but alas! alas! all came to nothing, or worse in the End; al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>though whilst he let them have Goods
<pb n="8" facs="tcp:41210:5"/>
a Trust, and to Receive pay for it when the Tobacco was Ripe, and fit for Sale, Oh! they Cryed him up for a <hi>Brave Man,</hi> and none like him; and he loved it as well: but when the time of payment came, then it proved quite ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther thing; then their Tobacco was <hi>Bad,</hi> and <hi>not done according to His order:</hi> And their pay was bad: and indeed the people were many of them bad too; Insomuch that he Entred <hi>Six<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty</hi> or <hi>Seventy</hi> Actions against them at one Court, of which he was the <hi>Clerke</hi>; it being a small petty Court for the busi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness of that part of the Country; but could determine no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing of above 20 l. value: well, but many of these Debts which he sued for were proved there in the Court to be paid, so he was put by all the Rest for that time: And then he that was so <hi>Brave a man</hi> before with them, was now accounted as the very <hi>worst of men</hi>; And so having this great occasion given them, they Raild on him exceedingly, and the whole Country Cryed out against him very much: and so like an unstable man that had lost his guide, and as its said of the wicked, <hi>grew worse and worse</hi> every way: for one while he would have a <hi>Plantation</hi> and be a <hi>Planter:</hi> Another while he would <hi>Build a house,</hi> and talk as if he would have a <hi>Fish Pond a top on it,</hi> although it was about three miles from any springs or wells of water, and he would go and live there: but that when it was almost built, was all CONSUMED BY FIRE IN ONE NIGHT ALTHOUGH NO OTHER HOUSE WAS NEER IT, OR ANY WAYS JOYNED TO IT. And so the Hand of the Lord turned against him Every way in every thing he took in hand. And then he went and got liberty of the <hi>Governour</hi> to turn Lawyer and plead in the Courts, which he did; and as a Justice told me,<note place="margin">
                  <hi>Note his place to give the Oath to men was as he was Clerks of the Court.</hi>
               </note> 
               <hi>If a man would go to the Devil, my Friend</hi> John Perrot <hi>would send them head<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>long; for he never saw one swear men so closely as he did in all his life:</hi> but I answered, <hi>he

            <head>A Testimony against <hi>Robert Rich</hi> and <hi>Iohn Perrot,</hi> and their filthy Books lately printed against God's People in Scorn called <hi>QUAKERS.</hi>
            </head>
            <p>IS it not an Unworthy thing for <hi>R. Rich</hi> to publish in print the private Discourse that <hi>G.F. F.H. E.B.</hi> and others had with <hi>Iohn Perrot,</hi> in which Friends did admonish him a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout his <hi>Extravagant Expences,</hi> and Wearing of his Hat in time of Prayer, and other private Discourses, and he to pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lish the same many Years after? And did not <hi>I.P.</hi> mani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fest in the End, <hi>that he had great Need of such Admonition?</hi>
            </p>
            <p>And as for <hi>I.P.</hi> and <hi>R.R.</hi> laying his and their Keeping on their Hats in Prayer (<hi>Ranter</hi>-like) upon the Lord, in time of Prayer; was it not known in <hi>Iamaica</hi> and <hi>Barbadoes,</hi> how <hi>I.P.</hi> could afterwards follow the Complements of the World, and put off his Hat, as others did, to Men, and <hi>R. Rich</hi> also in <hi>Barbadoes?</hi> Who made a great Pudder because we judged <hi>I.P.</hi> for not being Uncovered in time of Pray<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er to the Lord. And did not <hi>Iohn Perrot</hi> keep on his Hat in Prayer; and then did not he turn again to the World, and put off his Hat to the World? And therefore such unsta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble Spirits we never could have Unity and Fellowship with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>al in the Light of Christ, when they go from it.</p>
            <p>And it is well known, that it was not only the <hi>Paper con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerning the Hat,</hi> which Friends desired <hi>I. Perrot</hi> to call in, but also <hi>another Paper,</hi> which for Modesty's sake we cannot mention. And whereas he sayes, <hi>We denyed him a Meeting:</hi> That's False; for we had a Meeting with him at <hi>Wm. Tra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vers</hi>
               <pb n="12" facs="tcp:41210:7"/>
his House, and other Places. And a many Lyes hath <hi>I. Perrot</hi> uttered, which are not worth speaking of: And he said, <hi>It was contrary to his Conscience to put off his Hat in the Sight of God</hi>; and then presently after, he alter'd his <hi>Consci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence,</hi> and could <hi>put it off to Men.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>And as for <hi>I. Perrot's Iustifying himself;</hi> and <hi>Boasting of his Dispute with the Papists,</hi> and <hi>Challenge to the Pope</hi>; the End of that did manifest it self, which was not for his Credit; and he needed not to have boasted of it.</p>
            <p>And did not <hi>I. Perrot</hi> undo himself, his Wife and Chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren, and run out, so that <hi>Friends were fain to Keep his Chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren</hi>; who boasted of <hi>Restoring Friends the Money laid out for him?</hi> And <hi>Friends</hi> had more <hi>Compassion</hi> and <hi>Tenderness</hi> to his <hi>Wife</hi> and <hi>Children,</hi> than he had; <hi>who were fain to take Care for them because of his Extravagancy.</hi> And did not the <hi>Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phecy</hi> become true upon him in the End? <hi>For did not he turn like the Worst of Men?</hi> And because we dealt <hi>Plainly, Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nestly</hi> and <hi>Truly</hi> with <hi>I.P.</hi> he falsly calls us <hi>Persecuting Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rits</hi>; for he saith, G.F. <hi>waited to see pure Fruit in the Life:</hi> But what was his Fruit and his Life in the End?</p>
            <p>And <hi>R. Rich</hi> publishes a Letter of <hi>I. Perrot</hi>'s, and sayes, <hi>It was written a little before his Death.</hi> And are not these hor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rid Lyes? Was he not run into <hi>Drunkenness</hi> and <hi>Swearing of People</hi> long before he dyed? And why could not <hi>I. Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rot</hi> send his <hi>Letter</hi> to <hi>G.F.</hi> and others, as well as to <hi>R. Rich</hi>? much of which were Discourses of Friends, which they had in private with <hi>I. Perrot</hi> in <hi>London?</hi> where he hath ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded many Perversions and Lyes to their Words, and sent them to <hi>R.R.</hi> but never to them that were concerned; which <hi>R.R.</hi> hath basely done to print and publish them; for they never came to them that were concerned therein while <hi>I.P.</hi> was living.</p>
            <p>Further, <hi>R.R.</hi> sayes, G.F. <hi>endeavours to Limit the Life
<pb n="13" facs="tcp:41210:7"/>
of God in others</hi>: Which is a Horrid Lye, that we are sorry he should Dye unrepented of. For <hi>G.F.</hi> would have all People come to the Light of God and Christ in their Hearts. And many such Lyes are uttered in his Book, which are not worth the taking notice of.</p>
            <p>And People may see, that <hi>I. Perrot</hi> was turned from the Truth the <hi>Quakers</hi> profess, when he had got <hi>Gorgeous Ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parel and a Velvet Coat, a Staff tipt with Gold and a Carnal Sword, and was shooting off Gunns on Ship-board, and making of Feasts</hi>; which <hi>R.R.</hi> seems to justifie. And <hi>G. F.</hi> and others might very well send <hi>Papers</hi> after him to Reprove him, who at last ran into <hi>Swearing</hi> and <hi>Drunkenness</hi>; yet <hi>R.R.</hi> queries, <hi>Whether those were not the Floods of the Dragon, cast out of his Mouth to Devour the Manchild that must Rule?</hi> We say, Nay; for he that ran into <hi>Swearing</hi> and <hi>Drunkenness,</hi> vvas not like unto the <hi>Manchild,</hi> that must Rule.</p>
            <p>And <hi>R.R.</hi> has manifest a great deal of <hi>Maliciousness</hi> and <hi>Enmity</hi> in his <hi>Papers,</hi> which is not according to the <hi>Govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of Love,</hi> as he speaks of. And <hi>R.R.</hi> saith, <hi>Why should</hi> G.F. <hi>be Angry at</hi> I. Perrot's <hi>Velvet Coat, and wearing a Sword, and for his Gunns and Carnal Weapons?</hi> But <hi>I.P.</hi> pretended to go and preach the Gospel when he went to <hi>Barbadoes</hi> and <hi>Virginia</hi>; not to get <hi>Gunns,</hi> and <hi>Swords,</hi> and a <hi>Velvet Coat,</hi> and a <hi>Staff tipt with Gold, &amp;c.</hi> and so he chang'd from his Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>spel, as he deceitfully pretended to.</p>
            <p>And it is utterly false both in <hi>R.R.</hi> and <hi>I.P.</hi> that <hi>G.F</hi>'s Name was to any Papers for naming of <hi>Sober Iustices</hi> in the other Powers dayes, that would not Persecute us: For <hi>G.F.</hi> was out of <hi>London</hi> when the <hi>Parliament</hi> desired such a thing of Friends; and never was his Name to any such Papers. These are Forgeries of <hi>R.R.</hi> and <hi>I.P</hi>'s. And those <hi>Ten Thousand</hi> and <hi>Fifteen Thousands Hands,</hi> presented to the <hi>Parlia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment,</hi> were the <hi>Sufferings of Friends,</hi> which <hi>R.R.</hi> prints, and
<pb n="14" facs="tcp:41210:8"/>
makes an <hi>Ill Construction</hi> of. And as for <hi>I. Harwood,</hi> he hath manifested his End sufficiently, who <hi>Opposed Friends</hi> with his <hi>Hat on in Prayer,</hi> and manifested his Bad Life, <hi>Ran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter-like,</hi> as <hi>I. Perrot</hi> did.</p>
            <p>Again <hi>R.R.</hi> sayes, <hi>Seven of</hi> G.F's <hi>Friends were chosen for a Committee, &amp;c. G.F.</hi> knows nothing of that; therefore he was not like to <hi>Exalt</hi> himself in that. And <hi>G.F.</hi> does not meddle with the <hi>Carnal Sword of the Civil Magistrate:</hi> In these things <hi>R.R.</hi> hath belied <hi>G.F.</hi> and Friends, besides many other <hi>Scoffing</hi> and <hi>Reproachful Words,</hi> which are not worth mentioning, are in his Book. And he sayes scoffing<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, <hi>What is the Name</hi> Quaker <hi>thou givest to thy self? R. Rich</hi> knew, it is a Scornful Nick-Name given unto us: And <hi>Thee</hi> and <hi>Thou</hi> is the true Language, which he makes a pudder a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout, and he himself did once use it. And <hi>Swearing I.P. I.H.</hi> and <hi>R.R.</hi> once denyed it; but <hi>R.R.</hi> makes little of it now. And also <hi>I.P.</hi> did not he <hi>Swear,</hi> and tender the <hi>Oath</hi> to others at <hi>Iamaica</hi>? which <hi>G.F.</hi> and other <hi>Quakers</hi> alwayes denyed. And Christ and the Apostles forbid <hi>All Swearing:</hi> But <hi>Verily, Verily,</hi> and <hi>Calling God to record,</hi> as <hi>R.R.</hi> speaks of, is no <hi>Swearing.</hi> And the <hi>Quakers</hi> Suffer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings are not as other Sects, as <hi>R.R.</hi> scoffingly speaks. And what have been the <hi>Forms and Figures of Good Things to come</hi> among the <hi>Quakers,</hi> that thou speakest of?</p>
            <p>And over and over <hi>R.R.</hi> sayes, <hi>That</hi> G.F. <hi>exercised his Cruelty over</hi> J. Perrot <hi>and</hi> I. Nailor; which is false, the Lord knows; for he had nothing in his Heart but for their Good; and <hi>I.N.</hi> hath confest it, and given forth a <hi>Recantation</hi> of all his <hi>Runnings out</hi>; which <hi>R. Rich</hi> did feed upon. And <hi>I.N.</hi> never <hi>bowed down</hi> to <hi>G.F.</hi> its a horrid Lye for <hi>R.R.</hi> to say he did (p. 37.) neither did he ever desire it. So we are sorry that <hi>R.R.</hi> should dye before he had Repented of his Lyes. So as for <hi>Arrogancy, Pope, Lucifer, &amp;c.</hi> are these
<pb n="15" facs="tcp:41210:8"/>
               <hi>R.R's Words of Love,</hi> as he calls it? And these words he had better applyed to himself.</p>
            <p>Further, <hi>R.R.</hi> sayes, <hi>The Lord found him in Innocency, wherewith he had clothed him.</hi> But his Fruits in his Book from his Lying Spirit have not manifested it; neither are they the Fruits of a <hi>New Heart</hi> (as he speaks of in his <hi>Epistle</hi> printed 1680.) but the Fruits of a Railing Spirit against <hi>G.F.</hi> and others. As for <hi>Enmity, Self exaltation, Division, Rending, Tearing,</hi> and <hi>Bitter, Wrathful, Envious</hi> and <hi>Persecuting Spirits</hi>; with such like words he rails against <hi>G.F.</hi> and others; they were but the Fruits of his own Spirit, which he casts upon <hi>G.F.</hi> and others.</p>
            <p>And <hi>R.R.</hi> saith, <hi>That</hi> J.N. <hi>was led into the Wilderness to be Tryed and Tempted by</hi> G.F. <hi>and others.</hi> This was hor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rible <hi>Enmity</hi> and <hi>Malice</hi> in <hi>R.R.</hi> for 'tis well known, that <hi>G.F.</hi> was in <hi>Prison</hi> in <hi>Cornwall</hi> when <hi>I.N.</hi> run out.</p>
            <p>And <hi>R.R.</hi> sayes, (<hi>Epist.</hi> pag. 4.) <hi>The great Offence that</hi> G.F. <hi>takes at</hi> Iohn Perrot's <hi>Book, is, That I.P. own'd the Spirit of God's Grace and Light to be in the</hi> Presbyterians, Inde<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pendents, Anabaptists, Seekers, <hi>and others; and also, that he hath Unity and Amity with all that walk therein.</hi> We are sorry that <hi>R.R.</hi> should Belye <hi>G.F.</hi> and others; for it is known, that <hi>G.F.</hi> and others own the true Light and declare it, <hi>which enlightens every man that cometh into the World,</hi> and <hi>haeve Unity with them that walk in it</hi>; yea, <hi>have Unity with the Light in them that hate it.</hi> But its known, that these before-mention<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed have <hi>Printed against Friends,</hi> and both <hi>Anabaptists, Pres<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>byterians</hi> and <hi>Independents</hi> have called the <hi>Light, which enligh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tens every man that comes into the World,</hi> a <hi>Natural Light:</hi> And so its clear, that <hi>R.R.</hi> Belyed <hi>G.F.</hi> and Friends.</p>
            <p>And <hi>many</hi> other Books <hi>R.R.</hi> has given forth against the People of God called <hi>Quakers,</hi> which are stufft with known Lyes, Scoffs and Slanders, which are not worth mentioning;
<pb n="16" facs="tcp:41210:9"/>
for he was well enough known what he vvas in his-Life<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>time</p>
            <p>Another writes against the People called <hi>Quakers,</hi> calling himself, <hi>Phil. Ang.</hi> who sayes, <hi>A man, &amp;c. his Strength is to sit still, deny himself, and his own Life too, or else he cannot be Christ's Disciple.</hi> But he should have taken his Advice to himself, then he would not have brought forth his Confused Work. He makes a great pudder against <hi>Images, Forms and Shadows, which Delude men</hi>; but has not told us, what those <hi>Images, Forms</hi> and <hi>Shadows</hi> are. And he tells of <hi>Peoples pin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning their Faith upon other mens Sleeves, and boasting of things without their measure:</hi> If he applies this to the <hi>Quakers,</hi> he is deceived; for Christ is the Author of our <hi>Faith</hi>; for our <hi>Faith</hi> stands in God and Christ: but he does not declare his own <hi>Faith,</hi> nor what it is <hi>pinn'd</hi> upon. And the Fruits of his Book are not the Fruits of the true Light; nor doth he ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nifest, that he stands in it, or that he is one that feareth and trembleth at the Word of God: For he saith, <hi>Let Men and all the Womanly Weakness in Man Decrease, &amp;c.</hi> If the Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thor of this <hi>Epistle</hi> had done so, then his own Mouth would have been stopt; if he had taken that Counsel to himself, then he would not have manifest his Weakness, Enmity and Folly to the World.</p>
            <p>And there is another Book printed by <hi>Ieffery Bullock</hi> (or some body for him) with his <hi>Epistle</hi> to it, wherein are published the Papers that some <hi>Friends</hi> writ to <hi>Iohn Wilkinson</hi> and <hi>Iohn Story,</hi> with their <hi>Answers:</hi> And <hi>I.B.</hi> writes a railing <hi>Epistle</hi> to those <hi>Friends,</hi> wherein he justifies <hi>I.S.</hi> and <hi>I.W.</hi> Some of his Railing Words are, viz. <hi>An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tichrist's Teachers called Quakers, &amp;c.</hi> and saith, <hi>Iudge not, and ye shall not be judged</hi>; yet in Contradiction to himself he
<pb n="17" facs="tcp:41210:9"/>
hath falsly <hi>judged</hi> the <hi>Quakers,</hi> and so brought <hi>Iudgment</hi> upon himself. Moreover he saith, —<hi>such things as are of a Spiritual Concernment, which things alone do belong to the Light and Measure of the Spirit in every ones own particular to judge of, and it doth not belong to the Light in others to judge others in Matters of Conscience, &amp;c.</hi> What! is the Light divided? Is it not the same in one as in the other? What a Contra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diction and Confusion is this! Did not the Apostle see such as <hi>made Shipwrack of Faith and a Good Conscience</hi>? Were not They and the Children of Light able to judge who walk in the Light, and who walk contrary to it? And those <hi>Eleven Elders</hi> he speaks of, <hi>that did give forth a Testimony</hi>: if others did not own it, and gave a Testimony against it, what is that to the purpose? And what can <hi>I. Bullock</hi> tell, what those <hi>Eleven</hi> did say to them, that did not own their Testimony? They are not bound to give him an Account, nor Print it to the World, as he has foolishly done.</p>
            <p>And <hi>I.B.</hi> sayes scoffingly, <hi>We should first have drawn a Bill of Indictment against I.S. and I.W. before we had judged them.</hi> But <hi>I.B.</hi> should have asked <hi>I.S.</hi> and <hi>I.W.</hi> in the North for those <hi>Articles</hi> that were given forth against them, and what part of them they condemned. But he goes over and over in his Book, and tells of <hi>Orders and Decrees Im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>posed by G.F. and other Teachers</hi> (as he calls them) but what these <hi>Orders and Decrees</hi> were, he hath not mention'd: So these are but his Calumnies.</p>
            <p>And <hi>Iohn Pennyman</hi> has published several Pamphlets with a <hi>Reviling Language</hi> against several of God's People, as his Pamphlets declare his dark spirit, and what it is, though he doth pretend <hi>Love:</hi> but <hi>One Fountain does not send forth Sweet Water and Bitter.</hi> Neither does he shew, that he is of a Low<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly and Meek Spirit, nor in the <hi>Love of God,</hi> that he much
<pb n="18" facs="tcp:41210:10"/>
talks of; his <hi>Railing Language</hi> bewrays him. And as for his words, <hi>Hypocrisie, Falshoods, Temporizing Hypocrites, Babylo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nish Worship, Pride, Envy, and laying all his Railing Expressions upon God:</hi> his spirit and work does manifest, that they are not of God; and these Revilings of his are like his own spirit. And why is <hi>I.P.</hi> in such a Rage? because we cannot re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive his false words. And he makes a great Noise against our <hi>Forms, Prescriptions, Laws, Orders, Moods, Impositions, &amp;c.</hi> but tells not what they are. But all these he may apply at home, who stigmatizes God's People with Black Names.</p>
            <p>And whereas he saith, <hi>G.F. betrayed his Trust concerning</hi> Abiah Trott: That's false; and its no great matter what he says. And <hi>R. Cannon</hi> denyes thy false Charge thou bring'st against <hi>G.F.</hi> and says, <hi>To his Knowledge he did not speak such words</hi> [Witness <hi>Tho. Tanton.</hi>] And here thou art a Busie-body in other Peoples Matters; and it seems thou wantedst something to Print against <hi>G.F.</hi> and others; but thou hadst better study to be quiet, and to mind thy own Condition.</p>
            <p>And then <hi>I.P.</hi> sayes, <hi>If the publishing thereof</hi> (viz. of his Abusing Railing Pamphlet) <hi>be not according to the Will of God, &amp;c. then let his Grey Hairs not go down to the Grave in Peace.</hi> Be sure the Lord will reward thee according to thy Works (thy Lyes) and thy Words, though thou may'st cry <hi>Peace, Peace</hi>; but take heed, lest sudden Destruction does not come upon thee unawares, for the spreading of all thy Lying Scandalous Pamphlets, both of thy own writing and of others, against God's People; for be sure what thou dost Sow, thou must Reap, and God will reward thee according to thy Works.</p>

Rich's</hi> rambling Testimony, and something of others that opposed Friends &amp; <hi>T.C.</hi> calls them <hi>such weighty Truths, Testimo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nys, and sound Doctrins, that being kept, the Enemy had no opportunity to Enter by Divisions &amp;c. and the same</hi> 24. <hi>page of</hi> severall Testimonys he saith, <hi>mind what is aforesaid by these Servant's of God, for they are such needfull things in this day that could not he let pass; for its believed many among them never read them, therefore in love they are here Imparted to you, and who Acts or Teaches contrary thereto may be said to bring in another Gospel, and are going into the Seperation, and gain saying Spirit, having a form of Godliness, but denying the Power thereof, &amp;c.</hi> Now observe <hi>T.C</hi>'s Directory, who opposeth and vehe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mently crys out against for writing or giving out that he Scoffingly calls <hi>Orders, Forms</hi> and <hi>Prescriptions</hi>; and yet is crying up his own, or <hi>R.R. I.S.</hi> and <hi>I.W</hi>'s. And the man that is against Judging, at once passeth Sentence, Judges and Condemns them who act or teach contrary to his Directory, or <hi>R.R</hi>'s Testimony, &amp;c. as gone into Separation, and Gain-saying Spirit, and charges them <hi>with bringing in another Gospel, and denying the Power of God.</hi> Yet presently to manifest what he is, <hi>viz</hi> a <hi>Ba. Builder</hi>—He saith, <hi>The King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom of Heaven is within, and consists in Righteousness, &amp;c.—and not in speak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing one sort of Speech or Language, and conforming to</hi> Orders <hi>and</hi> Prescriptions <hi>from without:</hi> And yet all must be judged <hi>iu Separation, Gainsaying Spirit and Denying the Power of God that acts or teaches contrary to</hi> T.C's <hi>Directory, or</hi> R.R's <hi>prescribed Form, &amp;c.</hi> Oh! what an exquisite <hi>Babel-Builder</hi> is here! and yet <hi>F. Bugg</hi> his Brother in that ungodly Work of Opposing Friends, &amp;c.

quotes him, as if his <hi>Babels</hi> were to be taken notice of, though the very Deeds and Works of Darkness, Enmity and Folly; but as the Proverb is it may be said, <hi>Like to Like,</hi> and <hi>Birds of a Feather Flock together</hi>: But seeing <hi>T.C.</hi> so highly cryes up this <hi>Directory,</hi> or <hi>R.R</hi>'s Testimony or Prescription, let him examin and search whether it be according to Scripture; for I am of the mind, that there is not any danger or fear of incurring those Sensures aforesaid, if they be not complyed with (except from such who call Evil Good, and Good Evil) but rather an incurring of them, by acting or teaching according to it. Now <hi>R. Rich</hi> pretends (in his highly applauded little worth <hi>Testimony,</hi> printed by <hi>T.C.</hi>) <hi>to see that daily more and more will fall off from that Body</hi> [viz Friends] pag. 23.—<hi>and that some that separate from them, will with</hi> Daniel <hi>stand in their Lot</hi>: And though T.C. calls R.Rs, &amp;c. Testimony, <hi>Weighty Truths, Sound Doctrines,</hi> and R.R. &amp;c. <hi>Servants of God,</hi> and saith (as afore) that <hi>who acts or teaches contrary thereto, may be said to bring in another Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>spel, and are going into a Gain-saying Spirit, and denying the Power of God</hi>: but notwithstanding all this, T.C. saith, pag. 26. (in his Testimony following R.R's) <hi>Take no Delight in the Greatness of your Number—because the Body Grows Great, and Number Increases.</hi> So I shall leave the Candid and Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stian Reader to consider, whether T.C. hath not (after his great Applaud of R.R.) gain-sayed R.Rs Testimony; and whether, according unto his own Sentence, he is not <hi>gone into the Separation, Gain-saying Spirit, Denying the Power of God, &amp;c.</hi> So having thus in brief hinted at these things, to shew the enquiring Reader, that <hi>T.C. I. Pennyman, W.R. F. Bugg,</hi> have re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived the same spirit them poor miserable Men <hi>I. Perrot</hi> and <hi>R.R.</hi> were of, notwithstanding their great Pretence and high Title they give themselves, who would be accounted <hi>Christian-Quakers,</hi> &amp;c. though as certainly departed from the Power of God, and gone out of the Unity of Friends (whose unity is in the Light, Spirit and Power of God) as the aforesaid J.P. R.R. &amp;c. And if they, <hi>viz.</hi> T.C. J.P. W.R. F.B. &amp;c. do not return unto the Lord by un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feigned Repentance, they will certainly end their dayes in Misery. So hearti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly desiring the Lord by his Eternal Power may preserve all them, that in any measure truly fear him, from the Infectious Venom of that Spirit by which the aforesaid Persons have been acted to Oppose Truth, the Friends in it, and the Order it hath brought forth among the Lord's People, I conclude.</p>
