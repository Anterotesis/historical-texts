            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

If I had a suite to master Shallow, I would humour his men with the imputation, of beeing neere their maister: if to his men, I would curry with maister Shallow, that no man could better commaund his seruants. It is certaine, that eyther wise bearing, or ignorant cariage is caught, as men take diseases one of another: therefore let men take heede of their company. I will deuise matter enough out of this Shallow, to keepe prince Harry in continuall laughter, the wearing out of sixe fashions, which is foure termes, or two actions, and a shal laugh without interuallums. O it is much that a lie, with a slight oathe, and a iest, with a sad browe, will doe with a fellow that neuer had the ach in his shoulders: O you shall see him laugh til his face be like a wet cloake ill laide vp.</p>

            <p>First my feare then my cursie, last my speech. My feare, is your displeasure, my cursy, my duty, &amp; my speech, to beg your pardons: if you looke for a good speech now, you vndo me, for what I haue to say is of mine owne making, and what indeed (I should say) wil (I doubt) proue mine own mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring: but to the purpose, and so to the venture. Be it knowne to you, as it is very well, I was lately here in the end of a displea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sing play, to pray your patience for it, and to promise you a bet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter: I meant indeed to pay you with this, which if like an il ven<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture it come vnluckily home, I breake, and you my gentle cre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ditors loose, here I promisde you I would be, and here I com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mit my body to your mercies, bate me some, and I will pay you some, and (as most debtors do) promise you infinitely: and so I kneele downe before you; but indeed, to pray for the Queene.</p>
            <p>If my tongue cannot intreate you to acquit mee, will you commaund me to vse my legges? And yet that were but light payment, to daunce out of your debt, but a good consci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence will make any possible satisfaction, and so woulde I: all the Gentlewomen heere haue forgiuen me, if the Gentlemen will not, then the Gentlemen doe not agree with the Gentle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>women, which was neuer seene in such an assemblie.</p>
            <p>One word more I beseech you, if you bee not too much cloyd with fatte meate, our humble Author will continue the storie, with sir Iohn in it, and make you merry with faire Ka<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tharine of Fraunce, where (for any thing I knowe) Falstaffe shall die of a sweat<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> vnlesse already a be killd with your harde opinions; for Olde-castle died Martyre, and this is not the man: my tongue is weary, when my legges are too, I wil bid you, good night.</p>
