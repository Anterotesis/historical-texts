            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

               <opener>My Lords and Gentlemen.</opener>
               <p>HIS Majestie having long expected a conclusion of a happie Peace within that Kingdome, and his affaires having highly suffered by the faylure of his expectations from thence, cannot chuse but wonder what cause is of it; calling to mind those faire professions and promises which you made unto him, when you were imployed here as Agents,
<pb n="2" facs="tcp:113176:3"/>
and knowing well what powers and instructions he hath long since given my Lord Lieutenant to comply with you for your satisfaction, as farre forth as with any reason or honour his Majestie could in civill things, or with prudence, or con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>science, in matters of Religion; and in this latter, as to the utmost of what for any wordly consideration, hee will ever be induced unto: so did he conceive it nothing lesse, then what you de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clared unto him, you were perswaded the Catho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liques would be satisfied withall; nay, ought not in their owne interests, to seeke more in the pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sent Condition His Majestie was in, lest any further concessions might by confirming former scandalls cast upon his Majestie in matters of Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion, so alienate the hearts of his Faithfull and Loyall Adherents, as to make them abandon him, which as yet would draw inevitable ruine upon him; so were you rightly apprehensive, that when the Rebells should by that meanes have prevailed here, it must soone after bring a cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taine destruction upon your selves; What your change of Principles, or Resolutions are, His Majestie knowes not: But he findes, by the not concluding of a Peace there, that your Partie (it seemes) is not satisfied with the utmost that His Majestie can grant in Matters of Religion; that is, the taking away of the Penall Lawes against Roman Catholiques within that King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome: And his Majestie heares that you insist
<pb n="3" facs="tcp:113176:3"/>
upon the Demands of Churches, for the Pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lique Exercise of your Religion, which is the oc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>casion that His Majestie hath commanded me to Write thus Frankly unto you, and to tell you, that he cannot believe it possible, that Rationall and Prudent men (had there beene no Proposi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions made to the contrary) can insist upon that, which must needs be so destructive to His Maje<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stie at the present, and to your selves, in the consequences of His Ruine; that is, inevitably to be made a prey to the Rebells of these King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>domes, or to a Forraine Nation. Wherefore, (my Lords and Gentlemen) to disabuse you, I am commanded by His Majestie to Declare unto you, that were the condition of His Affaires much more desperate then it is, hee would never redeeme them by any concession of so much wrong, both to His Honour, and Conscience. It is for the defence of His Religion principal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, that he hath undergone the extremities of Warre here, and hee will never redeeme His Crowne by sacrificing of it there: so that to deale clearely with you, you may be happie your selves, and be happie Instruments of His Majesties resto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring, if you will be contented with reason, and give him that speedie assistance which you well may; and so if nothing will content you, but what must wound His Honour, and Conscience, you must expect, that how low soever his Condi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion is, and how detestable soever the Rebells of

this Kingdome are to Him, hee will in that poynt joyne with them, the <hi>Scots,</hi> or with any of the Protestant Profession,, rather then doe the least act that may hazard that Religion, in which, and for which, hee will live and die. Having said thus much by his Majesties Command, I have no more to adde, but that I shall thinke my selfe very happie, if this take any such effect as may tend to the Peace of that Kingdome, and make me</p>
