         <editorialDecl>
            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

               <head type="sub">Who may be ſaid to be a Good Subject?</head>
               <p>IN theſe very confuſed times, I find, no Title more generally aſſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med
by all ſorts of Men in theſe Dominions of Great <hi>Bri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain</hi>
and <hi>Ireland,</hi> then that of a Good <hi>Subject;</hi> Inſomuch
that if the <hi>Neighbouring Princes</hi> would be as eaſily Cheated
with the noiſe thereof, as many of our Fellow <hi>Subjects</hi> would per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwade
themſelves able thereby to impoſe upon their <hi>Own,</hi> we ſhould
be ſecured from Forreign attempts, by the Veneration of our <hi>Kings</hi>
Majeſty, and Fear of his Strength, ſuppoſed to be in the <hi>Peoples</hi>
affections. But our too too apparent diſorders are ſufficient evi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence
of Notorious Fraud in many Mens Pretentions, and that this
great <hi>Name,</hi> which includeth <hi>Religion</hi> and <hi>Prudence,</hi> is by more Men
injuriouſly Uſurped, then honeſtly deſired to be appropriate. Now
although this <hi>Title</hi> be ſuch, that the Community thereof leſſeneth
none, but rather diſpoſeth each particular Man to better Fortunes
and Enjoyments, yet this is only ſo, when it is the due Character of
what it is affixed to, the conſequences of ſeparating Duties and Names,
being alway very unhappy, eſpecially the more eminent the concerns
of any Duty are. When therefore ſo many Men of contrary Tempers
and Practices, do even with clamour and fury, arrogate to themſelves
the credit of being <hi>Good Subjects,</hi> and as violently complain of wrong,
<pb n="2" facs="tcp:56685:5"/>
if ſo much as ſuſpicion ſeem to aſſail it; and yet the vaſtly different
inclinations and paſſions of the Challengers hurry them on to as diffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rent
Actions, it being impoſſible that all, who lay hold of it, can merit
it, yet that none can enjoy it except he merit it, the right of poſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeſſion
is the more ſtrictly to be enquired into.</p>
               <p>A <hi>Good Subject</hi> I conclude him who ſubmitteth to the <hi>Higher Pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers,</hi>
under the Regiment whereof he is placed, as to the <hi>Ordinance
of God for Conſcience ſake.</hi> And in this, be their ways and Opinions
never ſo diſcrepant, they all agree with me, at leaſt I have not met
with any denying it. Now the <hi>Higher Power,</hi> this <hi>Ordinance of God</hi>
among us is the <hi>Regal Authority,</hi> which the <hi>Authors</hi> of <hi>Reformation</hi>
whether <hi>Church</hi> or <hi>States-Men,</hi> have juſtly cammanded all Perſons
within theſe <hi>Dominions</hi> to own as <hi>Supream in all Cauſes, as well Ec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cleſiaſtical
as Civil, under God.</hi> Accordingly <hi>the Church of England,</hi>
by ſo Praying, doth Teach as that the <hi>Obedience</hi> we pay unto the
<hi>King,</hi> is <hi>in God, and for God.</hi> And indeed all the Preſcriptions of
<hi>Government</hi> how Subtil ſoever, find no Bonds ſo firm as thoſe of
Subjection for <hi>Gods</hi> ſake, which Unite Men to their <hi>Governors</hi> by a
delivery of their Hearts into Cuſtody; So long as they believe <hi>God,</hi>
they will obey their <hi>King.</hi> If any obey for other reaſons then for
<hi>God</hi> and <hi>Conſcience,</hi> they are not by this <hi>Obedience good Subjects,</hi>
becauſe their Subjection not being Founded upon <hi>Religion,</hi> but <hi>In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tereſt</hi>
and <hi>Fancy,</hi> muſt be as the Foundation is, mutable. But ſuch
as are Loyal and Obedient for his ſake, <hi>by whom Kings Reign,</hi> are
in their <hi>Obedience</hi> conſtant and indefatigable as the <hi>Cauſe</hi> is. There
are good Men, Stable and preſerving in their Duty; The others are
either cunning Men, <hi>Timeſervers,</hi> or Fooliſh Man, led about as
<hi>Aſſes</hi> with a Bridle, which way ſoever thoſe cunning <hi>Timeſervers</hi>
manage them: They are either Tame Beaſts for the <hi>Publick Service,</hi>
or unruly and rapacious to the <hi>General Annoyance,</hi> as their <hi>Guides</hi> uſe
the Word of Command. Now, nothing is properly to be Termed
<hi>Good,</hi> but what is well directed <hi>to a good End,</hi> and to benefit all
that are therein concerned. The Publick Actions of Inferiours then,
that they may be well directed to a <hi>Publick Good,</hi> have their cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain
Rules, whereby the deſign of them cannot Fail; But if they are
done according to thoſe Rules, are certainly of General advantage.
So that a <hi>Good Subject</hi> is one that is Regular and conſtant, that
knoweth his Place and Duty preſcribed, and perſiſteth in maintain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
his Station, and ſo becometh uſeful abroad, happy at home. His
good Acts are not a Diſtemper, which after extremity of chilneſs,
<pb n="3" facs="tcp:56685:5"/>
Fly out into a High Feaver, and relapſe again into the former Shiver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
condition; But are promoted by a conſiderate Vigour of mind,
which compelling him to be dutifull for <hi>Gods</hi> ſake, ſheweth him
withall the <hi>Divine Wiſdome,</hi> which has mixed <hi>Obedience</hi> and <hi>Profit</hi>
moſt inſeperably. While his Ingenious Subjection is of concern to
others, it is cheifly ſo to himſelf. For as his ſtrict obſervance of
Duty conduceth to his <hi>Princes peace,</hi> and is his <hi>Neighbours</hi> Example
and Tranquillity, ſo is it of much more advantage to the <hi>Authour</hi>
then others, who as a Member of the <hi>Body,</hi> ſhares in the <hi>Publick
Good;</hi> and moreover (beſides the ſatisfaction and joy thereof) hath
from the Treaſures of <hi>Divine Bounty</hi> an unconceivable reward. In
fine, he is juſtly to be Termed <hi>Good,</hi> becauſe his Sole aim is to
pleaſe <hi>God,</hi> and imitate his communicative <hi>Property</hi> of <hi>Goodneſs,</hi> he
readily Executing the <hi>Good</hi> which he deſireth or commendeth, ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
by himſelf or his <hi>Vicegerents;</hi> And this he doth ſo joyfully,
that he accounteth <hi>Submiſſion</hi> and <hi>Obedience</hi> no Yoke or Burden, but
the moſt Auguſt aſſertion of his <hi>Liberty</hi> and <hi>Propriety.</hi>

               <p>WE commonly obſerve that nothing is ſo Univerſally deſired
and deſpiſed, as <hi>Peace,</hi> earneſtly longed for upon the leaſt
abſence, and welcomed frequently with full Teſtimonies of grati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tude
and admiration, but ſcarce enjoying the entertainment ſo u<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſual
to things of leaſt conſequence and eaſier Purchaſe, <hi>a nine days
wonder.</hi> The want of her, is wont even to Murmuring to be La<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mented,
the return Admired, Magnified, and (the ſhort Solemni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties
thereof over) a ſuddain forgetfulneſs overwhelmeth her Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vours.
But this is no other then the common courſe of Mankind,
to prize what is Courted, and Villifie the ſame grown Familliar;
as if we longed chiefly for diſatisfaction, or Loved a ſhort enjoy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
only in order to long abſtinence. But that an ill Trouble
of any thing wanting in Subſtance or Value poſſeſſeth us, is cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainly
an affliction proceeding from our ſelves, and is the want of
<pb n="4" facs="tcp:56685:6"/>
diſcretion and Piety, which makes the moſt deſirable Goods, firſt un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eaſie
to us, and quickly intollerably. Our continually Whirling fan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cies
make us ſuppoſe Changes in what continueth moſt the ſame,
and when we will not ſee our own Folly, we muſt be Senſible of
Miſery. And truly diſſatisfaction is a weighty one; But it is in our
own Pleaſure to Lighten or Aggravate it, no Miſchief being more
eaſily Contracted or Removed. For if we ſet our ſelves Induſtri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ouſly
to look into the Cauſes of things, begining firſt with our
ſelves, we ſhall Seldom ſee any reaſon to ſearch any farther. The
wanton undervaluing the Bleſſings of <hi>Peace,</hi> is alway the firſt breach
of <hi>Peace,</hi> ingratitude being the Root of diſorder, diſtempering the
Mind with Groundleſs Jealouſies, and the Brain with extravagancies.
But this Miſchief befalleth no diſcreet or good Man, who by put<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting
a true eſtimate upon things, is inoffenſive to himſelf and others.
The way to preſerve <hi>Peace</hi> is for each Man Seriouſly to enquire
whether himſelf hath been conſtantly juſt in his eſteem of her, and
by Rectifying the apprehended Injuſtice every Man in himſelf, loſt
<hi>Peace</hi> is reſtored. And thus we remove diſatisfaction without that
Tumult and amuſing Agitation, wherein our Pollititians are at this
day ſo much concerned. By being conſiderate we are either in it,
or ſoon reduced to a true State of happineſs, and need no Labori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous
Care or deſperate Councels to keep or repair that which is ſo
much in our own Power, which cannot be wanting nor rendered
infirm without our being Fooliſhly unthankfull. By keeping his
thoughts quiet, every Man contributeth to the <hi>Publick Peace;</hi> and
the Private perfecteth the Common Security.</p>
               <p>But the diverſity of Diſpoſitions, cauſeth a diverſe conſtruction of
<hi>Peace,</hi> which too too frequently is not given according to what it
ſelf is, but what the Speaker would have it thought. As was be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
obſerved, the deſire of being accounted <hi>Good Subjects,</hi> is great
even in thoſe, who run Courſes contrary to the Rules of Obedience;
ſo is the name of <hi>Peace</hi> Coveted as a Reconciling Ornament by
thoſe, whoſe affections are Monſtrouſly inform and Brutiſh, whoſe
Sanguinary perverſeneſs makes them the Scandal of Mankind. For
ſo Numerous, ſo Delicious, Rich and Weighty are the benefits,
which <hi>Peace</hi> brings, ſo Amiable and Divine thoſe minds, wherein ſhe
reſideth, and ſuch a Flouriſhing Beauty encompaſſing her Habita<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions,
that he who is her Profeſſed Enemy, muſt by reaſon of the
general hatred abandon humane Society. Thence it is that the very
affronts and Injuries, which compel her to ſeek <hi>Heaven</hi> for Refuge,
<pb n="5" facs="tcp:56685:6"/>
walk under the Diſguiſes of <hi>Peaceable deſignes, and Peaces Vindicati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
and promotion.</hi> And becauſe there is Viſibly a breach of Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cord,
the Authours thereof not able to bear the blame with a miſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cheivous
induſtry Shift it upon ſuch as are moſt jealous of at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tempts
againſt <hi>Peace.</hi> So that upon cautious <hi>Vertue,</hi> which by
prudent Love and Innocence ſeeks to retain her, are thrown the
imputations of Treachery and Diſcord. And in the mean time be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween
thoſe, who on one Side aloud plead her Cauſe, and on the
other hand Act according to her Diſcipline, <hi>Peace</hi> is loſt and <hi>Union</hi>
diſſolved. Now the Cauſe is in the credulity of unwary Men,
(who are the moſt of any Age) who by Turbulent Men impoſed
upon, think many things wanting to them, and moſt of what they
enjoy Deficient; that Supplies and Stores would abound were not
the Care of them committed to heavy and unſeeing Men; More<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>over,
they are affrighted with a <hi>Puppetry</hi> of dangers repreſented as
<hi>Real</hi> and <hi>Gigantine,</hi> which the Drowſineſs of their <hi>Protectors</hi> ſuffer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth
to invade them without endeavour of prevention. At the be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginning
of Conſpiracies and Diſorder the wiſeſt deſires of <hi>Peace</hi> are
only called <hi>Neglect</hi> and <hi>Stupidity,</hi> and the People intoxicated with
Plenty, are perſwaded to believe themſelves Poor, Wretched, and in
danger, and by Mutinous Clamours, to awake their careleſs <hi>Gover<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nours,</hi>
and animate them to diligence. But if their inſolent behaviour
be repreſſed, and <hi>Fortitude</hi> (the bleſt <hi>Guardian</hi> of <hi>Peace</hi>) appeareth
to check the contrivances of <hi>Sedition,</hi> preſently this is Termed <hi>War,
Oppreſſion,</hi> and <hi>Tyranny,</hi> and the <hi>Peoples</hi> condition becometh Lamen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted,
as if they were immediately to be Subjected to Slaughter, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe
required to be Quiet and Proſperous. And here nothing can
be allowed to be <hi>Peace;</hi> but what <hi>an impracticable Lenity</hi> ſhall per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mit
to the impudent requeſts or (rather) demands of Men deſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tute
of Sobriety. But ſuch requeſts being a Manifeſt Violation
of <hi>Peace,</hi> the conſenting and yielding to them is no other then an
invitation of diſorder; and every <hi>Subject,</hi> which appeareth pleaſed
either with the gravity of pretentions or the way of promoting
them, recedeth from the <hi>Office</hi> of a <hi>Good Subject</hi> by aſſenting to what
eſtabliſheth no ſafety. And the excuſe of being enſnared by the
ſpecious aſſurances of <hi>Publick good</hi> is not to be admitted; For miſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>underſtanding
freeth him not from guilt, who ought to know cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainly
what he doth, before he moveth out of the <hi>Rules</hi> and <hi>Ways</hi>
appointed to him, and Antiently obſerved by Men of Eminent and
Fortunate Obedience. Neither is it the proper deſign of <hi>Peace,</hi>
                  <pb n="6" facs="tcp:56685:7"/>
which ſome ſo much extol and call <hi>Moderation,</hi> whilſt they comply
with all <hi>
                     <gap reason="illegible" extent="1 word">
                        <desc>〈◊〉</desc>
                     </gap> actions,</hi> and think their cold indifferency interpoſed be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween
the diverſe extremities of heat, will in time reduce all to a
convenient Temper. For this is either a Cowardly Submiſſion to
the Practiſers againſt the <hi>General good</hi> given under a Fairer Title
only, or a Fooliſh preſumption concluding Succeſs in the <hi>Vnion,</hi> it
would form before acquaintance had of the Nature of the Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jects
of the work propoſed. The firſt of theſe hath alway proved
an unfortunate and Fatal endeavour of prevention, which the Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thours
of miſchief ſo eaſily diſcern, that nothing more encourageth
them, and is commonly the ſharpeſt Spur of their Galloping Fury.
And the latter advanceth it alſo by believing it ſelf Proſperous
when moſt deluded. For unquiet Men together with Viperous
affections, have a creeping and ſoft way of Guile, whereby they
inſinuate hopes of Submitting to reconciling Propoſals, when
they leaſt Harbour ſuch intentions. And the eaſineſs of theſe <hi>In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dulgent
Pacifiers;</hi> they uſe to carry on with more Security and leſs
obſervance whatſoever their devices and conſpiracies. But beſides
this Evil of being Inſtrumental and aſſiſtant to the <hi>Contrivers</hi>
againſt <hi>Peace,</hi> he is himſelf a breaker of it, who without Licenſe
obtained, ſhall upon any pretence, recede from the Station, to which
he is ordered. Let what <hi>Prudentials</hi> or Fancied <hi>Polliticks</hi> ſoever
poſſeſs him, they are no Warrant, for his indifferent Demeanor in
reſpect to <hi>Obedience;</hi> but whoſoever is not Strictly <hi>Obedient,</hi> is partly
<hi>Factious,</hi> and ſo far Strengthens the ill <hi>Deſigner</hi> as he hath with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>drawn
himſelf from his exactneſs of performance of Duty. For
this taketh ſome Liberty, the other doth but take more, not to do
what he ought; but the latter hath as Lawfull a permiſſion as the
former. In any part to move towards or ſhew a compliance with
unruly Men, is not a promoting <hi>Peace;</hi> for although it may ſeem
for the preſent to abate their Madneſs, it is alway found in the
main more violently to excite it.</p>
               <p>A <hi>Peace</hi> therefore, which being obtained, hath no firm hopes of
eſtabliſhment, is not that, which ſo ſtrongly engageth the thoughts
and care of a <hi>Good Subject.</hi> A <hi>Peace</hi> patched up and compoſed of
uncertainties, and dawbed over with the fallacious promiſes of Men
by experience known to be inſincere, maketh Wiſe Men fear, and
Good Men mourn, being rather then a <hi>Peace</hi> to be accounted a
time of reſpite for wickedneſs to gather Strength, which ſhould be
cruſht in the infancy. But a <hi>Good Subject,</hi> is Studious of the ſame,
<pb n="7" facs="tcp:56685:7"/>
he Prayeth for, that the <hi>Peace</hi> obtained may be ſuch an one, as is
without danger of <hi>Leading into Captivity,</hi> and when there is <hi>no com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plaining
in the Streets;</hi> when there is Security from Forreign incur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſions,
and enjoyment each Man of his own, a general Satisfaction
at home. That force from without may not Allarm the People,
Duty and reaſon directeth the <hi>Subject</hi> by Prayers and ready aids
both Pecuniary and Military to give his <hi>Prince</hi> ſtrength and Repu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation.
Duty enjoyneth this; and the reaſon of Self preſervation
adviſeth it, becauſe neither Money nor Arms afford the owners
defence whil'ſt altogether retained in Private Hands, but are their
beſt Guard and moſt their own when cheerfully reſigned to their
<hi>Princes</hi> diſpoſal. The Splendor of his <hi>Sceptor</hi> rendereth his <hi>Sword</hi>
formidable and moſt uſefull; and we beſt keep and enlarge our own
Fortunes, by a Generous contribution of Jewels to the Beautifying
of it, the Glory and Benefit being certainly more the <hi>Subjects</hi> then
the <hi>Kings.</hi> But there muſt be a farther Care of being every Man
Religiouſly juſt at home, the great ones not oppreſſing the leſſer,
nor the leſſer joyning into Parties and conſpiring again the greater,
if they begin to think him for his Neighbourly behaviour and meek<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs
meet only to be cullied and undermined. Theſe things done
on either hand occaſion <hi>complaining in the Streets,</hi> which a <hi>Good
Subject</hi> induſtriouſly Laboureth to prevent and cure as opportunity
and the place he ſtandeth in permit him. Injuries ſtir Men up ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
to mutual Revenge or Publick Clamours for ſatisfaction, which
if Craft or Power hinder, the Innocent <hi>Government</hi> is Caluminiated,
and Private abuſes frequently grow into open diſorder. And by theſe
means pernicious Examples are Multiplied, Men looſe their <hi>Liberty</hi>
and have no free enjoyment of <hi>Property.</hi> For <hi>Liberty</hi> is not (as
ſome in our days would have it eſteemed) a ſufferance, ſuch as the
Holy Text mentioneth of <hi>Iſraelites,</hi> when for want of Government,
<hi>Every Man did that, which was right in his own Eyes;</hi> but is <hi>an
Exemption from a Forreign Yoke,</hi> and a <hi>priviledge of Subjection to
our own Natural and Lawful King.</hi> Neither doth the <hi>enjoyment of
Property</hi> conſiſt in uſing our own at any rate after our own will,
but in uſing our own according to the preſcriptions of <hi>Religion</hi>
and <hi>Juſtice.</hi> So that to be able, every Man according to his qua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lity
and in his proper place of Subjection, freely to Act that, which
is good and praiſe-worthy, and to Reap the benefits of ſo acting, is
to enjoy <hi>Liberty</hi> and <hi>Property.</hi> To endeavour as he may his own
and his Neighbours good, is Religious and Juſt; but to go beyond
<pb n="8" facs="tcp:56685:8"/>
theſe, is not what we uſually Term <hi>to take Liberty,</hi> but is uſurping
upon <hi>Liberty,</hi> and becoming Licentious. And to repreſs all Licen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tionſneſs
is the part of a <hi>Subject</hi> Practiſing <hi>Peace;</hi> notwithſtanding
he muſt warily keep within the Lines of his Office or Power allow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed,
becauſe even the repreſſion of Evil by other means and Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons
then thoſe duly appointed, is a breach of <hi>Peace.</hi> All Irregula<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rities,
as they are greater or leſs, do more or leſs tend to her Annoyance
both in conſequence and Example; therefore by good and Wiſe Men are
carefully avoided, that She may be the more entire and indiſſolu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble.
So that by advancing their <hi>Princes Power and Glory,</hi> and pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moting
by piety and Integrity the Common Intereſt, they endeavour
both to obtain and Settle <hi>Peace;</hi> which is then only firm, when
our <hi>Defender</hi> is Glorious abroad and Honoured at home, and we
all deteſt to do to each other <hi>the things that is Evil. Good Subjects</hi>
are not for Innovation, nor can they bear with ſuch as Clamour
for <hi>Peace,</hi> and pretend to Settle it by <hi>Faction and Seditious Tumults.</hi>
They very well know the vaſt Latitude of their expoſitions of <hi>Peace,</hi>
and the narrowneſs of their intentions to her, whoſe obtended Zeal
is ſo Loud and Fiery; and in ſhort, that the <hi>People</hi> have no other
Rules for happineſs but thoſe of <hi>Obedience</hi> to their <hi>King,</hi> and a diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>creet
Government of themſelves.</p>

               <p>TO Speak a Man to be a true Lover of <hi>Peace,</hi> is to affirm him a

<hi>Temple,</hi> whereas his unfurniſhed <hi>Brain</hi> could have contributed
nothing toward the Erecting of a meaner <hi>Fabrick.</hi> At the ſame

Leadeth them as a ready <hi>Guide,</hi> inſpiring them with Councells ſuit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing

with their propoſed ends, but <hi>the way of Peace have they not
known,</hi> nor are they capable of Inſtructions how to find them or
Demean themſelves in them. But as the Arts of <hi>Government</hi> do
excell all others; (the reſt being only attendants to them) ſo of
all <hi>Regal Excellencies;</hi> a thorough converſation and intimacy with
the <hi>Arts</hi> of <hi>Peace</hi> is undoubtedly the Sublimeſt. And thoſe <hi>Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jects,</hi>
who in their Truſts and Stations, ſedulouſly apply themſelves
to the Execution of <hi>Kingly</hi> Dictates, and to be fit Miniſters of Injuncti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons
of this ſort, are queſtionleſs the moſt nobly aſpiring; and the more
nearly and immediately they are concern'd in diſcharge of this Office,
the more delicately fine and polite their frame and temper ought to
be. All men indeed have their executive parts to act and account
for, but they are for the moſt part different, and the moſt accompliſh't
(becauſe <hi>Subjects</hi>) are but ſubordinate. In which condition to do well,
is their true Glory, but to attempt their own Promotion, to ſet them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves
forward out of Self-confidence, is the greateſt forfeiture, and
moſt manifeſt diſcovery of Infirmity of judgment. For although the
<hi>Love of Peace</hi> is an admired <hi>Virtue</hi> in both Prince and People, yet the
<hi>Offices</hi> are not the ſame; The <hi>Prince</hi> is as the <hi>Head</hi> directive, the <hi>Subjects</hi>
partly executive, partly paſſive. Even thoſe whom the <hi>King</hi> from his
obſervations of them, receiveth into the receſſes of Conſultation are,
if not altogether, yet in this very point, for the moſt part Executive,
their adviſes being Inſignificative, until they have his approbation, and
are by his Will formed into a <hi>Law,</hi> to which even they are to yield a
ready obedience. Now the <hi>Counſels of Peace</hi> are <hi>Kings</hi> peculiar <hi>Skill,</hi>
a <hi>Myſterious and God-like Faculty,</hi> into which <hi>Subjects</hi> are not to pry
any farther then the admiſſions of <hi>Royal Grace.</hi> To attempt upon
them is a Sacrilegious breach of their <hi>Peace,</hi> and a great interruption
of the <hi>Subjects</hi> own, which nothing deſtroyeth like <hi>Suſpition,</hi> that em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>boldeneth
this ſawcy ſcrutiny, and overthroweth in order to outward
diſturbances our beſt Peace, even that of our Minds. What therefore
the <hi>Prophet</hi> ſpake in <hi>Gods</hi> cauſe, I may to the <hi>People</hi> inoffenſively ſpeak
in the <hi>Kings, In reſt ſhall ye be Saved, in quietneſs and confidence ſhall be
your Strength.</hi> This is the <hi>Subjects</hi> ſafeſt courſe, although they are
ſometimes taught the contrary, that Queſtion being reiterated with
oſtentation of judgment in the Speakers, at what time this duty and
counſel is preſſed upon them; <hi>What, ſhall we all lye ſtill, ſeeing ſuch ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proaching
dangers, and ſuffer our throats to be cut like fools and cowards?</hi>
And here, alas! how quick-ſighted we would needs be, when the
<hi>Dreamers of Dreams</hi> have ſomewhat awakened, and told us their
<pb n="10" facs="tcp:56685:9"/>
dreadful Viſions? Whereas, were we throughly awakened, we could not
but ſee more clearly, and above all, plainly diſcern, that our watchful
<hi>Pilot,</hi> who ſitteth at Helme, doth naturally (as bred up to Specula<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions)
and judiciouſly (as having all the accumulative advantages of
knowledge) foreſee any tempeſt, which being like to ariſe, may en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>danger
the <hi>Ship of State.</hi> We that lie below too much fear ſinking
by every high Blaſt, and hearken fooliſhly to envious deſtractors Sail<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
in the ſame bottome, to whom our <hi>Maſters</hi> wiſdom and greatneſs
are a grief and Eye-ſore. Thence, when there is really a time of need,
help is mutinouſly (I had almoſt ſaid, Rebelliouſly) denied, becauſe
our <hi>Commander</hi> doth not to the certain ruin of all, direct his courſe
by common advice in an extraordinary caſe. At the beginning of a
Storm they'l not be under his Command, becauſe they are told, that
they know not what perilous Rocks lye hidden in ſuch a Tract. Inſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>much
that in the want of due aſſiſtance, if all be proſperous beyond
expectation, the ſucceſs is miraculous, and to be aſcribed only to <hi>Gods
immenſe goodneſs,</hi> and our excellent <hi>Conductors</hi> judgment and experi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence.
But all this while, what probability can we have, that our
<hi>Prince</hi> either doth not, cannot, or will not ſee miſchief drawing on,
nor protect us, and by ſo doing, preſerve himſelf? Of the eminence of
his abilities, hath been enough, if not here ſpoken, yet every where
known; What reaſon then that his own ſafety ſhould be ſo cheap in
his own eſtimate? Doth he it out of hatred to himſelf? Or are his
<hi>Subjects</hi> ſo odious to him, that he becometh contented to ruin himſelf,
that we may all certainly Periſh? Having no reaſon to conclude the
firſt, we Anſwer the ſecond with an Enquiry; What have we done?
How have we behaved our ſelves towards him, to excite in him an
Indignation ſo Prodigious, that taketh away all care and reſpect for
himſelfe? And ſuch an Indignation there muſt be by our undutiful de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>meanour,
or elſe it is manifeſt, that our Conſciences accuſe us of
Evil in the height deſigned and endeavoured, which meriteth ſuch an
one, although he harbour it not in his <hi>Sacred Boſome;</hi> For we cannot
fear that which is not, or which hath not been deſerved. But inno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cence
is free from ſuſpition, eſpecially where the concerns are vaſtly
more his, then any particular <hi>Subjects,</hi> and at leaſt equal to all. But
the fears are raiſed, and the ſuſpitions ſomented by men, who (not<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>withſtanding
their Profeſſions, and the peoples opinion of them) hate
their <hi>King,</hi> and have no deſires of their <hi>Countrys</hi> tranquility. And
where ever ſuch appear, the <hi>King</hi> in his Rules of <hi>Peace</hi> cannot but
ſee a neceſſity of taking them off by violence, (if other means procure
<pb n="11" facs="tcp:56685:9"/>
not a ſpeedy Remedy) becauſe the <hi>Publick</hi> Peace is preſerved, when
diſorder is prevented; and ſuch Victims are very ſatisfactory to her.
Nay, ſo far are they from being in the leaſt offenſive to <hi>Peace,</hi> that
thoſe <hi>Princes</hi> who have too long Tampered with other Medicines be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
they ſet upon this way of Cure, have offended againſt her Laws
by too much delay. For when Buſy Men have been permitted to
goe on too far in diſperſing their Mallice under ſpecious pretences,
rather then they would ſtrike off the Cancred Member to the
general preſervation, although this forbearance proceed meerly from
compaſſion, the <hi>Authours</hi> have been (unwillingly indeed, but) <hi>Ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſaries</hi>
to the Calamities which followed. It is (I know) a much
applauded diſcourſe; That for the <hi>King</hi> to pleaſe his <hi>Subjects,</hi> to
Rely upon their Love, and caſt himſelf wholly upon their affections,
are the only means for him to eſtabliſh <hi>Peace,</hi> and attain to the height
of Formidable <hi>Grandure:</hi> No <hi>Prince</hi> being ſo powerful and Rich as
he, that winneth and ſo Ruleth in the Hearts of his <hi>People.</hi> But while
they urge this to him, what in the mean time do they make
their <hi>King,</hi> whom they would ſuppoſe not to know this, and how
far it is true? For if the conſtant exerciſe and practice of <hi>Religion,
Juſtice</hi> and <hi>Clemency,</hi> be not <hi>Princely Obligations</hi> ſufficiently command<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
all dutiful and grateful returns from reaſonable and good Men,
<hi>Subjects</hi> who are not theſe, will never nor ought by any endeavours
to be otherwiſe wonne; becauſe the <hi>Prince,</hi> who would gratifie un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reaſonable
Men, in ſo doing knoweth himſelf to offend againſt the
Rules of <hi>Peace: God</hi> is thereby made angry and good Men to mourn,
and innumerable muſt the miſchiefs be, which will of neceſſity fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low.
If thoſe Acts of <hi>Magnanimity</hi> do not Influence them, a deſcent
from his <hi>Majeſty,</hi> which will render him leſs Honoured, will not
purchaſe him more Love. Thoſe bold Men from whoſe ill repreſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tations
the moſt <hi>Heroick Vertues</hi> are Traduced, need not much uſe
of Art to bring compliances under contempt. For they muſt either
be aſſented to through want of Judgment or Tumultuarily Forced:
And in either Caſe new Breaches will be made, and former made
wider. <hi>Subjects,</hi> who ſhall find the advantage they have gotten o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver
their <hi>Prince,</hi> cannot (as I ſaid) Love him the more becauſe they
will leſs Reverence him; neither can they think themſelves ſafe,
who muſt alway expect Revenge either of the Blemiſh left upon re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>putation
(then which nothing hath a deeper impreſſion) when diſco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vered,
or the undutiful carriage, which hath preſumed to take his
<hi>Throne</hi> lower then his <hi>Anceſtours.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>But ſtill the thoughts of <hi>Religion</hi> ſeem to urge an extraordinary
<pb n="12" facs="tcp:56685:10"/>
care, by reaſon of the manifeſt dangers ſaid to threaten it. And indeed,
the concerns thereof are ſo tranſcendently high, that they juſtly de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mand
all our skill and utmoſt vigilancy to be employed for its pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſervation,
<hi>Peace</hi> with preſent, and the hopes of our future welfare,
being all enjoyments, which are <hi>Religions</hi> Bleſſings. Neither can any
man truely love his <hi>Prince,</hi> his Neighbour, or himſelf, who liveth in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>different,
and careleſly contented with any thing that beareth that
<hi>Name,</hi> whether true or falſe; becauſe ſuch an one hath ſomewhat,
which he prizeth at an higher rate, in the enjoyment whereof, if
diſturbed, or in danger of diſturbance, he will not ſcruple as he ſhall
be able to act to the violation of <hi>Vnion.</hi> Nothing certainly more
conduceth to <hi>Peace,</hi> then an earneſt <hi>Zeal</hi> for <hi>Religion,</hi> which ſeeth
the State enervated by every <hi>Faction</hi> that maketh Eruptions in the
<hi>Church,</hi> and dareth object all its powers to its excluſion. Neverthe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſs,
this <hi>Zeal</hi> muſt be <hi>according to knowledge,</hi> and the power it uſeth
muſt be lawful, otherwiſe when it is erroneous and blind, it is alſo
head-ſtrong and outragious, and ſo is an adverſary to <hi>Peace;</hi> and
when it tranſgreſſeth the limits of the power the <hi>Law</hi> preſcribeth, it
undertaketh to defend <hi>Religion</hi> by <hi>Impiety.</hi> And how acceptable that
perſons ſervices are, who bringeth to the <hi>Altar Offerings of Abomi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nations,</hi>
is eaſie to judge. Now the moſt undoubted powers of con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tending
againſt <hi>Faction</hi> and <hi>Innovation,</hi> which every man is allowed
and enjoyned equally to uſe, are devout <hi>Prayers</hi> and <hi>Innocence</hi> of
life. Which if duely practiſed by the profeſſed <hi>Children of the Church,</hi>
would alone make her Victorious, and prevent all ſolicitous Counſels
of diſappointing her Adverſaries. And it is to be feared, that the
greateſt difficulty is in daring to uſe and confide in the ſucceſſes of
theſe beſt defenſive Armes; yet if theſe be not chiefly relyed upon,
other means afford little or no help. When therefore I hear ſo much
daily ſaid of Religion and its Preſervation, and ſee theſe moſt neceſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſary
coercives of attempts upon it ſo altogether ſlighted by them,
who ſeem moſt Zealous, I cannot ſufficiently admire why they un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dertake
ſo great a work, who are moſt ignorant how to effect it. Eſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cially,
ſtrange it is to obſerve ſo much action and fury, both condemn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able,
the firſt for want of <hi>Commiſſion,</hi> the later as contradictory to the
Principles of <hi>Chriſtianity.</hi> And to all that are ſerious, the event is foretold
when theſe <hi>Agents</hi> for <hi>Truth</hi> are conſidered; for they are either men
deſtitute of <hi>Piety,</hi> having not ſo much as the Form, or elſe ſuch as
proceed to exalt her in the very methods, which they condemn in
others as tending to her depreſſion. By the joynt aſſiſtance of moſt
<hi>Atheiſtical Debauches and notorious Hypocrites,</hi> we are great with ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pectation
<pb n="13" facs="tcp:56685:10"/>
of a <hi>glorious Church.</hi> I confeſs I do not ſo much wonder at
the impudence of the principal <hi>Conductors,</hi> as that many pretending
to be and fortunately eſteemed Men of Sobriety, ſhould be led aſide
with an opinion and hope of theſe Mens counſels, notwithſtanding ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parently
pernicious. For neither <hi>Peace</hi> nor <hi>Religion</hi> can ſtand upon theſe
frames made up of materials unlawfully and unskilfully caſt together
and diſagreeing from what they are to ſupport, <hi>Religion</hi> is not to be
modelled by every man, who fancieth himſelf a Workman for that
purpoſe; nor if that eſtabliſhed by Law happen at any time to be er<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>roneous
or deficient in ſome parts, may <hi>Subjects</hi> without eſpecial <hi>Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſſion</hi>
for that very end attempt alteration or amendment. Every man
is bound to be well ſatisfied of the <hi>Truth</hi> of what himſelf profeſſeth;
but muſt abſtein from what is the <hi>Office of Supream Authority</hi> only, un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſs
that be pleaſed to impower him to inquire into and correct what
ſhall merit a rectifying inſpection. Otherwiſe, although they ſhould
be never ſo urgent, <hi>Religion</hi> tolerateth not a relief of her neceſſities,
by private mens invading the <hi>Kingly Power</hi> and <hi>Prerogative;</hi> It is <hi>Diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>obedience,</hi>
from which ſhe will not own aſſiſtance. <hi>Subjects</hi> may deſire
and pray, and ſome few of the wiſeſt and moſt remarkably Loyal, may
modeſtly and privately Petition their <hi>King,</hi> that he would graciouſly
remedy and prevent ſuch evils as the <hi>Church</hi> ſuſteineth or feareth. But
in either caſe they ought evidently to ſhew the complaints to be of in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>conveniencies
really incumbent, and their jealouſies to be juſt and
weighty, otherwiſe they give him juſt ſuſpition of their either Wiſdom
or Integrity, that they are themſelves enſnared by ill deſigning men,
or would enſnare him. No <hi>Aſſembly</hi> of men, although met together
in <hi>Council</hi> by his <hi>Majeſties</hi> eſpecial Command, are to meddle with mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters
of <hi>Religion</hi> (more then concerneth Piety in the practiſe) any farther
then their <hi>Maſter</hi> recommendeth it to their care to conſider of it, and
report to him the reſults of their Conſultations. To <hi>Act, Vote,</hi> or <hi>Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolve</hi>
herein, without his leave and direction, is to diſown his <hi>Autho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity
in matters Eccleſiaſtical,</hi> and make themſelves a <hi>Supream Conſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tutive</hi>
                  <hi>Power.</hi> If ſome very meek Addreſſes be (as I ſaid before) mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deſtly
and privately made of their apprehenſions of <hi>His and the publick
Danger,</hi> by miſchiefs threatning the <hi>Church,</hi> and ſome humble over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures
of Prevention ſubmitted to his <hi>Princely Judgment,</hi> they have gone
as far as <hi>Good Subjects</hi> dare. But if their <hi>Prince</hi> ſee more ſharply into
his own affairs, while they will needs ſuppoſe him to overſee, it is
utterly incoherent with the <hi>Office of Religious and good Subjects,</hi> to uſe
any violence or ill Arts to compel him, foraſmuch as they can but bare<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
juſtifie their moſt humble Entreaties. Some have exceeded their
<pb n="14" facs="tcp:56685:11"/>
                  <hi>Commiſſion,</hi> and extended their <hi>Priviledges</hi> from <hi>Juſt</hi> and <hi>Honourable,</hi>
to <hi>Vnwarrantable</hi> and <hi>Rebellious,</hi> under pretence that their <hi>Prince</hi> did
not ſee, neither would be adviſed how imminent his danger was. In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtead
of <hi>Faithful</hi> and <hi>Loyal Subjects</hi> aſſembled, to offer him their Lives
and Fortunes, againſt <hi>Forreign</hi> or <hi>Domeſtick Enemies,</hi> they have firſt
fallen to other <hi>Debates,</hi> and more trifled out time about <hi>Eye-ſores</hi> and
harmleſs <hi>Wens</hi> in the <hi>Body Politick,</hi> then to apply themſelves to the
cure of the <hi>Diſtempers</hi> ſo much complained of, to endanger the <hi>Vitals.</hi>
And then to pare the Nails of his <hi>Power,</hi> and ſhave the Excreſcencies
(as they call them) of his <hi>Prorogatives,</hi> at the time of greateſt need
(as themſelves confeſſed) when ſupplies ſhould have been freeſt, were
the onely means they found to reſtore health to theſe <hi>Kingdoms,</hi> and
exalt above his <hi>Neigbours</hi> their <hi>Princes Scepter.</hi> At length when his
acute <hi>Judgment</hi> ſaw, and great <hi>Spirit</hi> diſdained their Counſels, they
reſolved as <hi>Guardians</hi> of a fooliſh or mad <hi>Pupil</hi> by Fetters to perſwade,
and moſt horrid indignities to laſh him into compliance, and (had
not <hi>Divine Providence,</hi> as his <hi>Shield,</hi> diverted their aims) would no
doubt have accompliſhed their promiſed <hi>Glory</hi> and <hi>Grandeur,</hi> by the
before practiſed courſe of rendring their <hi>King</hi> Immortal.</p>
               <p>How rationally theſe and the like actions conclude the Peace of
<hi>Church</hi> and <hi>State</hi> deſigned, and the <hi>Authors</hi> meriting the Name of
<hi>Good Subjects,</hi> is ſo unfit to be enquired into, that I wonder even Fools
and Madmen, who take almoſt any thing upon credit of the <hi>Delive<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rers,</hi>
have no Stones to hurl at theſe groſſeſt of <hi>Pretenders.</hi> But the
<hi>Lovers of Peace</hi> are exceſſively aſhamed, and our incomparably <hi>Refor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med
Church</hi> ſcandalized, to hear and obſerve the moſt reproachfully
diſtracting ſtudies of men, who ſeem to envy all others the Fame of
<hi>Religious</hi> and <hi>Loyal,</hi> all their expreſſions proclaiming their reſtleſs care
of <hi>Gods</hi> and the <hi>Kings Honour.</hi> But we ſee that ſmooth words tend
moſt to the breach of <hi>Peace,</hi> when there is <hi>War in the Heart,</hi> and that
no Crimes are ſo odious as thoſe over which the <hi>Name</hi> of <hi>Holineſs</hi> is
ſuperintended. To prevent the exceſs of which Debauchery of the
Mind, and the Calamities which inſeparably attend it, we muſt wari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
avoid the creeping Folly at the beginning, which admitted, open<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth
the paſſage for what is moſt monſtrous and prodigious. To that
end we muſt reſerve no patience of the ear for them, who by the mag<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nitude
of danger (whether fictitious or real) perſwade men that they
may divert themſelves ſomewhat from the exactneſs of duty. This once
received, preſently confineth and enlargeth <hi>Obedience</hi> at will, allowing it
no proper bounds or aſſigned ſtation, nor indeed any thing more then a
bare <hi>Name</hi> to ſerve the baſeſt ends. The ſtrictneſs of Duty towards our
<pb n="15" facs="tcp:56685:11"/>
                  <hi>Prince</hi> well obſerved, is the greateſt aſſurance of <hi>Peace,</hi> becauſe the firm<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eſt
Bond of <hi>Religion,</hi> being <hi>in God,</hi> and <hi>for God</hi> performed. This calmeth
all thoughts in us, by begetting a due and ſeaſonable <hi>Confidence</hi> in our <hi>King,</hi>
truſting him with our ſelves and fortunes, which he cannot injure ſo long
as we <hi>Love and Honour him.</hi> And <hi>ſuſpition</hi> removed, we ſhall be generouſly
executive <hi>Miniſters</hi> of <hi>Peace,</hi> either in our common Employments, or the
particular charges, with which he vouchſafeth to honour us, leaving the
grand care thereof upon him, with whom <hi>God</hi> hath entruſted it. This is
virtuous, noble, and conſentaneous to <hi>Religion,</hi> being the Ornament of that
<hi>Profeſſion.</hi> While we know our <hi>Duty</hi> diſtinguiſhed from our <hi>Superiours,</hi> and
act <hi>Chriſtianity</hi> more than diſcourſe it, we need not fear our tranquillity to
be over-whelmed by force, or undermined by Subtilty. For our care of
<hi>Peace</hi> and <hi>Religion,</hi> will make us watchful over our ſelves to continue Inno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cent,
and over Pretenders to keep them from Sacrificing to their Malice
and Ambition our moſt glorious and deareſt fruitions: And by dutiful re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turns
of ſeaſonable proviſions, in token of gratitude to our <hi>King,</hi> and the
better to enable his Love and Care of us, reciprocal affections will alway
abound, and <hi>Gods</hi> Bleſſing will manifeſt his approbation, that this is the

be obteined by the <hi>Primitive Chriſtians;</hi> therefore was it enjoyned as the

afflicting. Sometimes men are troubled and augment their trou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bles,
by cauſleſly accuſing their <hi>Prince</hi> of miſtakes, when it was their own
perverſneſs firſt diſturbed him, and that continuing, is his farther vexation,
and much more both theirs and every Mans. It happeneth to them as to

Whereas his only deſire is that with them he may be quiet and Proſperous.
The Vexations are great and Spreading until they are reduced to good

<hi>Saul</hi> being poſſeſſed of the <hi>Iſraelitiſh Diadem,</hi> was ſent by <hi>God</hi> with
an eſpecial Commiſſion to lead an Army againſt the <hi>Amalekites and utterly

that ſo chargeable an <hi>Expedition of two Hundred and ten Thouſand Men</hi>

and ſuch Plenty of <hi>Fat Sheep and Oxen, Younger Fatlings and Lambs,</hi> ſhould

Periſh to no Mans benefit; That at their return there muſt be Publick
Thanksgivings, Sacrifices and Feaſtings, with their Wives, Children and Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lations
at Home; which they judged would prove a Lean and Barren joy,
if the Sacrifices and Beaſts to be Slaughtered, muſt be fetched from their
own Folds and Stalls: Theſe or the like, were the Voices of the Multi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tude,
and were ſpecious Arguments uſed by the <hi>Nobles, Rulers</hi> and <hi>Chief-Captains</hi>
to perſwade the <hi>King</hi> to neglect his Duty towards <hi>God for the good

and that the ſhew and noiſe of Sacrifice would Silence <hi>Heavens De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cree</hi>
pronounced for the <hi>Contempt</hi> of its <hi>Laws.</hi> Neither was this eaſily
obtained of the <hi>King,</hi> who, although a Valiant Man, was forced to yield,

miſeries and diſſatisfactions did even infinitely abound. And then to find
what they ſought for, they were compelled to retreat, to acknowledge
their folly and diſtreſs, ſupplicating him whom they moſt rebelliouſly and
ignominiouſly diſpoſſeſſed of his <hi>Crown and Dignities, Return thou and all thy

be otherwiſe adminiſtred, then by <hi>Religion</hi> and <hi>Juſtice,</hi> and practi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing
the bleſſed <hi>Rules of Peace.</hi> The concerns of <hi>Religion</hi> and <hi>Juſtice,</hi>
are for the moſt part within the publick view: But I have ſhown that
the <hi>Miſtery</hi> of <hi>Peace</hi> is their peculiar Skill, not to be pryed into any
further than they are pleaſed to permit, but that the <hi>Subjects</hi> Acqui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eſcence
is their beſt Strength and Safety. And although this be true, yet
there are too commonly men Diſſatisfied, Ambitious and Malicious,
who will not be Happy, who will be peeping, medling with, and <hi>Speak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
evil of the things they underſtand not.</hi> And ſometimes it happeneth
that theſe pernicious wretches go on with a Fatal Proſperity, inſomuch
that (as the <hi>Wiſe man</hi> ſpeaks) <hi>The City</hi> (by which he meaneth the <hi>King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom</hi>
or <hi>Commonwealth) is overthrown by the mouth of the wicked.</hi> Some<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times
the commotions only threaten, and having begun the works of
<pb n="20" facs="tcp:56685:14"/>
ruine, are not able to finiſh them, <hi>God</hi> being pleaſed <hi>to put an hook into
the Noſes</hi> of the Inſolent, and to curb <hi>the madneſs of the people.</hi> But
in any of theſe Caſes, the calamity beginneth at the <hi>Head;</hi> all the
vitious <hi>Members</hi> blowes and reproaches are at that: Although they are
pretenſively aimed at ſomething elſe, yet there they are deſigned to fall.
But then, alas! how ſenſible is every ſound <hi>Member</hi> of all the Affronts
Indignities and Sufferings, which it ſuſtaineth? If it Ake and Grieve, how
they languiſh? If it ſmart, how ſpeedily do they feel the pain? And its
Agonies put all on Trembling? Every injury they feel, each deprivati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
is their loſs, every reproach their ſhame. Then they mourn and cry out
as lamenting <hi>Jeremy, For this our heart is faint, for theſe things our eyes are
dim.</hi> Ordinary troubles obſerved in equals, create commiſeration in
thoſe who have not put off Humanity; but <hi>Chriſtians</hi> have a fellow
feeling of their Brethrens afflictions by the greatneſs of their compaſſion,
<hi>bearing one anothers burthens;</hi> as if ſuffering in the ſame Body, and un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der
the ſame Calamities. If ſuch be the Affection of common Neigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bourhood,
which the general rules of <hi>Chriſtian Charity,</hi> and peradven<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture
ſome, peradventure no particular Obligations of dependance or
communion have enlivened; how boundleſs muſt thoſe Paſſions and
Griefs be, which proceed from <hi>Charity,</hi> enflamed by all that the free
exerciſe of <hi>Religion,</hi> Temporal Hopes and Dependencies, and the en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>joyments
of a pleaſant Fraternal Communion can adminiſter? By
the Injuries and Diſturbances of the <hi>Kings Peace,</hi> the Publick Exerciſe
of Religion is alſo interrupted; for then <hi>when the wicked ariſe, a man is
hidden,</hi> then what they celebrated before with open Joy and Thanks<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>giving,
<hi>Gods Children</hi> being ſcattered by the Perſecutions of the <hi>Vngodly,</hi>
are forced mournfully to perform in Corners. They that will not allow
their <hi>Nurſing Father</hi> quiet, will afford the <hi>Pious Sons</hi> as little Tranqui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lity.
And although no other moleſtation enſue from the impious <hi>Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thors</hi>
of the <hi>Kings</hi> Grief, yet the remembrance by whom <hi>God</hi> hath
hitherto conveyed thoſe moſt Heavenly pleaſures to his <hi>Servants</hi> upon
Earth, mingleth even thoſe ſweets with Gall, when <hi>God</hi>'s <hi>moſt Sacred
Subſtitute</hi> is forc'd to drink of the Cup of Bitterneſs. Each good man
is deſirous to undergo in his own perſon what he ſuſtaineth, and would
gladly give his Life in exchange for the Afflictions of the <hi>King,</hi> who is
<hi>worth ten thouſand of us. David</hi> although a <hi>King,</hi> was ſo concerned at
the death of <hi>Abner</hi> a reconciled Enemy, that <hi>all the People</hi> could not
perſwade <hi>him to eat,</hi> becauſe there was <hi>a Prince, and a Great Man then
fallen in</hi> Iſrael; much more <hi>Good Subjects,</hi> when they ſee Miſchief de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſigned
againſt their <hi>Soveraign,</hi> and carried on with Fury and Inſolence,
<pb n="21" facs="tcp:56685:14"/>
do Faſt and Mourn, and when they do Eat, it is the Bread of Afflicti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons
and Tears. And in the next place (although they do not move Pious
men with equal affection, yet) our Temporal Dependencies and En<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>joyments
conſidered, help to add weight to our Grief, when <hi>the Al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mighty's
great Almoner,</hi> by and under whom <hi>our Table was prepared,
our Head anointed, and our Cup did run over,</hi> ſhall be reduced to
ſtreights and anxieties. When he alſo whoſe love and care of his
<hi>People</hi> laboureth to ſecure to each man (as far as humane ſcrutiny can
give judgment) his juſt rights and fruitions <hi>redeeming the Souls of the
Poor from Deceit and Violence, and breaking in pieces the Oppreſſor,</hi> when
he ſhall be under diſtreſs, or in any danger, by the Conſpiracies of Cruel
and Blood-thirſty men, ſo great is the Horrour that ſurprizeth them,
that in the poſſeſſion of what hath been preſerved by paſt care, there is
no comfort, no enjoyment. Love cannot be ungrateful, and Gratitude
cannot be forgetful, but the memory of each delight cauſeth a melting
of hearts, and as it were a diſſolution of nature, when the <hi>Principal</hi> Cauſe
is threatned to be taken away or removed out of ſight. Neither is this
Grief but in the leaſt part proceeding from any fear of Sequeſtrations
and loſſes of Eſtates and Fortunes by the violence offered to our <hi>Princes
Peace.</hi> Although there's little need of Remembrancers to mind us how
<hi>Religious</hi> and <hi>Loyal men</hi> were treated, when Slaves were mounted and
<hi>Princes</hi> depreſſed, and that ſo juſt a fear is cauſe enough for trouble of
mind, and that trouble no way diſcommendable, yet this leaſt afflicteth
any <hi>good Subjects</hi> thoughts. For ſhould ſuch as move towards our <hi>So<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veraign</hi>'s
Diſquiet never ſo plauſibly and largely promiſe the ſame free<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom
in <hi>Spirituals</hi> and as full enjoyment of our <hi>Liberties</hi> and <hi>Properties</hi>
as we either do or can deſire to obtain, nay could they give us cau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
and ſecurity ſufficient to prevent all fears of non-performance of
thſe promiſes, when it ſhould be in the power of their hands to per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>form
or change; yet could none of theſe promiſes or offered ſecurities
remove a <hi>good Subjects</hi> ſorrow. For in the firſt place <hi>Vſurpers</hi> account
all that they leave in the poſſeſſion of thoſe, over whom they have aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſumed
Authority, to be matter of <hi>Courteſy,</hi> not of <hi>Right</hi> and <hi>Juſtice,</hi>
And the ſubverſion of the fundamental <hi>Right,</hi> the alteration of <hi>Property,</hi>
although the thing be retained, doth ſo much abate the pleaſures of frui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion,
that it rather appeareth a gently protracted miſery. But then by a
nearer inſpection into things, <hi>good and wiſe Men</hi> ſee an impoſſibility of
performing theſe promiſes, although the <hi>Promiſers</hi> would be, what <hi>Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bells</hi>
never are, exact in theſe their <hi>Covenants.</hi> For not to be diſquieted
in gathering in and eating our own Bread and of our own Flocks and
<pb n="22" facs="tcp:56685:15"/>
Herds, or ſitting and drinking our own Labours under our own <hi>Vine,</hi> is
not <hi>Peace</hi> nor a <hi>Bleſſing,</hi> but a <hi>Curſe.</hi> Every morſel we ſwallow goeth
down with dread and menaces, and our drink chilleth our very <hi>Spirits</hi>
as at <hi>Death</hi>'s approach. For in the midſt of all plenty looking up in ſtead
of that glorious and auſpicious <hi>Star,</hi> which <hi>God</hi> hath alway graciouſly
appointed to influence and be the bleſſing of our <hi>Fortunes,</hi> we ſee black
and prodigious <hi>Clouds</hi> and <hi>wandring Stars</hi> with flaming denunnciations
of Wrath, which cauſe to vaniſh whatſoever pretendeth to joy. <hi>God</hi>
will have his Work done his own way, and his Bleſſings adminiſtred by
Sacred Hands. Men of impudence, riots and luſts, who are uncapable
of well uſing a private Fortune although too large for them, yet rapa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciouſly
extend their deſires to the <hi>State,</hi> which is above <hi>ſubjection,</hi> can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not
at the ſame time be the <hi>Publick Scourges</hi> and <hi>Bleſſings.</hi> They never
appear but for humane puniſhment; the ſight of them admoniſh us re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pentance
and ſorrow, which when we religiouſly abound with, they are
deſigned for the <hi>Fire.</hi>

               <p>OUr <hi>Nation</hi> at this time aboundeth with men who pleaſe themſelves
with Religious Diſcourſes; and this inviteth me to head this part
of my Diſcourſe with a <hi>Scripture Example. Mephiboſheth</hi> being the
Son of <hi>Jonathan, David</hi>'s admired Friend, was after <hi>David</hi>'s Coronation
called to Court, made to eat daily at the <hi>King</hi>'s <hi>Table,</hi> and all the Lands
of <hi>King Saul</hi> reſtored unto him. After a long proſperous Reign <hi>King
David</hi>'s <hi>Son Abſalom</hi> conſpired againſt him; the <hi>Conspiracy</hi> was ſo
ſtrong and ſudden that the <hi>King</hi> had no time to prepare himſelf for De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fence,
ſcarce enough to fly. But among all the true-hearted <hi>Subjects</hi>
which lamented the <hi>Kings</hi> diſtreſs, that of <hi>Mephiboſheth</hi> is moſt remar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kable,
who being <hi>lame in his Feet,</hi> yet <hi>had not dreſſed his Feet, nor trimmed
his Beard, nor waſhed his Cloaths, from the day the King departed, until the
<pb n="23" facs="tcp:56685:15"/>
day he came again in peace.</hi> There was a rare Divine Soul in a weak and
informe body; and the grief of the mind was exceedingly the greater,
becauſe diſabled of corporal aſſiſtance in his <hi>Princes</hi> neceſſity. But he
would not be deficient wherein he was able; therefore he produceth a
powerful ſupply of prayers and tears inſtead of Arms and Sinews of
War. Neither was he afraid in dangerous times to ſhew his diſlike of
the publick joy at <hi>Jeruſalem,</hi> or to be a mourner amidſt <hi>Abſalom</hi>'s Tri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>umphs.
To ſhew fear had been to caſt out love, and was beneath his
large <hi>Gratitude,</hi> and incomparable <hi>Loyalty.</hi> Theſe rendred him fearleſs
and regardleſs of all other misfortunes after the <hi>King</hi>'s departure. He
ſo much ſaw his <hi>Maſter</hi>'s danger, that he ſaw not his own; beyond
him he had no hopes, without him no pleaſure. Which is eaſily diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerned
ſeeing his lameneſs being from his infancy, and needing a conti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nual
care, yet his ſorrow and cares for his exiled <hi>King</hi> afforded no time
for cure or refreſhment. He could not mind eaſe and decency, when
the <hi>Kingdom</hi> was in diſorder, nor let his thoughts that were high in con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſultation
and ſuſpence for the ſick <hi>Head</hi> and faint <hi>Heart</hi> deſcend ſo low
as to be employed about his <hi>Feet.</hi> Self preſervation would have been
the firſt of moſt mens thoughts, but it was none of his at all, the weigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tieſt
concerns taking deepeſt impreſſion in his great and capacious mind.
Mean <hi>Spirits</hi> would have thought of nothing elſe, but how to preſerve
themſelves and their Fortunes; let <hi>David</hi> or <hi>Abſalom</hi> or whoſoever
could get the <hi>Throne</hi> much alike to them; ſo long as they could find
ways to Ingratiate and Fawn, no matter by what hand they were fed.
But Generous and Divine Souls reject thoſe deſpicable politicks, which
certainly ruine <hi>Conſcience</hi> and <hi>Fame,</hi> and run greater hazards of Tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>porals
then they, who firmly adhere to their <hi>Loyalty</hi> and <hi>Integrity.</hi> For
<hi>Rebellions</hi> are ſeldom proſperous, or not long ſo: And although con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtant
<hi>Fidelity</hi> doth willingly adventure all, yet it never hath need to
Apologize for Deſertion, or ſupplicate a returning <hi>Princes</hi> Mercy and
Pardon. His Peaceable <hi>Reſtauration</hi> is the Faithful <hi>Subjects</hi> Prayer and
Fortune; this he chiefly deſireth and aimeth at; and if other Fortunes
ſink in the acquiring, he eſteemeth the purchaſe cheap enough. Thoſe
other men of mean Spirits, like Ratts and ſuch contemptible Vermine,
if the Building wherein they are threaten a downfal, preſently ſhift for
themſelves, not caring what becometh of any thing, provided they are
far enough from the danger, whether it ſtand or fall: But <hi>Good Men</hi>
put their Shoulders as props to Suſtain the <hi>Fabrick</hi> of the <hi>State,</hi> and
never move from their undertaken Charge, ſo long as they have any
Hopes of benefiting it by their Endeavours: And rather had they be
<pb n="24" facs="tcp:56685:16"/>
oppreſt in the ruine, then not to have endeavoured the utmoſt, when
need ſo required. And this is certainly the greateſt <hi>Policy</hi> to them, who
make any Profeſſions of <hi>Religion,</hi> or think juſtly of <hi>God.</hi> I add this laſt,
<hi>Or think juſtly of God,</hi> becauſe it is too well known, that they who in
Later times, and in theſe days, make loudeſt Profeſſions of <hi>Religion,</hi>
are the firſt in Seditious and Rebellious practices. But this ſheweth
their Profeſſions inſincere, and that in Truth they do but make a mock
of the name of <hi>Conſcience,</hi> and think of <hi>God,</hi> (as that <hi>Royal Prophet</hi>
expreſſeth it) that <hi>he is altogether ſuch an oxe as themſelves,</hi> or rather,
<hi>Do ſay in their hearts, there is no God.</hi> The better ſort of <hi>Moraliſts</hi> have
in all times outdone theſe <hi>Chriſtians,</hi> believing their <hi>Allegiance</hi> to their
<hi>Prince</hi> to exceed all private Intereſts, whether Perſonal or Relative;
and exhibiting incorrupt <hi>Loyalty</hi> under the greateſt Temptations and
durance. Nay even the better ſort of Doggs have ſhewn grateful Fide<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lity
to their <hi>Maſters</hi> to the extremity of Breath. So far have thoſe
other pretenders to the great <hi>Titles</hi> of <hi>Piety,</hi> put off even Morality and
Nature. But ſuch as truly fear <hi>God,</hi> and revere <hi>Conſcience</hi> upon each
neglect, or injurious act, declare to themſelves what <hi>David</hi> proclaimed
to <hi>Abner and the People,</hi> who ſleeping left the <hi>King</hi> to <hi>David</hi> and <hi>Abi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhai</hi>'s
mercy; <hi>As the Lord liveth we are worthy to die, becauſe we have
not kept the Lords Anointed.</hi> And wiſe men, who know the danger,
will be as careful not to incurr the <hi>Divine Diſpleaſure</hi> by ſleeping
when it is time of Action; but rather they hate the Act of Negligence
more then the deſert, and are ſo in love with their duty, that no violence
can ſeperate Affections, or hinder their diligence in Preſerving or
Reſcuing from danger the <hi>Lords Anointed, the Breath of our Noſtrils.</hi>
And this (although good men in the performance of their duty, leaſt
think of a Temporal reward, yet) they know to be the higheſt part of
<hi>Prudence</hi> too, or Rational <hi>Subtilty.</hi> They know the <hi>Divine Power</hi> to be
no Fiction, or Dream, but recollect and treaſure up in their Memories
the Omnipotent Acts of revenge of its diſhonour upon the unthinking
Contrivers of Treaſon, and the moſt frequent Temporal manifeſtations
of his Love and Honour to the Faithful. They ſee it to be but a Tryal,
and being confirmed for their Duty, are ſure of being approved, and that
when <hi>God</hi> ſeeth his time to <hi>Turn again the Captivity of his people,</hi> for
their preſent Grief, they ſhall obtain the chief places in <hi>the Theaters of
Joy.</hi> It being Gods promiſe, <hi>That the King ſhall joy in Gods ſtrength, and
that he will prevent him with the Bleſſings of Goodneſs,</hi> They know, that
as the <hi>Kings</hi> Sorrow was theirs, ſo ſhall his Joy be. So that their
Trouble, although exceſſive, hath yet much Conſolation; becauſe they
<pb n="25" facs="tcp:56685:16"/>
Hope always, and their Hope is Rational depending on <hi>God,</hi> who be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſides
Scriptural moſt delicious Promiſes and Examples, hath further
amply furniſhed us with incomparable modern Patterns and Obſerva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions.
In the midſt of their Griefs, Sufferings and Endeavours, they ſeem
to hear directed to each of them, as well as lamenting <hi>Rachel, Refrain
thy Voice from Weeping, and thine Eyes from Tears, for thy work ſhall be
rewarded, and they ſhall come again from the Land of the Enemy.</hi> They
are as a Faithful Wife, whoſe Husband being either in the field ready to
engage in a deſperate Battle, or at Sea in ſtormy weather, and a road In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſted
by Pyrats; Anxity and Fear make her continually Mournful,
ſhe is viduated and neglectful of Ornaments and Food, uſing but little,
enjoying nothing. Yet Hope taketh its viciſſitudes of adminiſtring Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fort,
minding her of the prevalency of Prayer and Patience, repeating
the ſucceſſes with which <hi>God</hi> hath hitherto bleſſed either him or others,
who Induſtriouſly relyed upon the excellency of their Cauſe, and which
he hath to ſuch promiſed. This giveth Intermiſſions of Grief, and often
gaineth victory, although ſubject to frequent relapſes. At length his
return baniſheth Hope and Fear, but both ſerve to make great the
joy, which without them muſt have remained among the ſmall and
diſregarded ones. The <hi>King</hi> is the <hi>Soul</hi> of his <hi>Countreys Joy</hi> and <hi>Felicity,</hi>
whoſe Dangers or Abſence cauſe Convulſions of Spirits in his <hi>Faithful
Subjects,</hi> who are Eſpouſed to him, and ſharers in all his Fortunes. And
it is impoſſible while men are under greatly diſtracting cares for the <hi>Pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lick,</hi>
but that private Affairs and Pleaſures muſt ceaſe to be reſpected.
But before theſe Thoughts ſwell the heart to deſpair, <hi>Divine Comfort</hi>
appeareth encouraging <hi>Fidelity,</hi> with Promiſſes of a Bleſſed Concluſion.
For by the Generations paſt they are taught, that Adverſities may fall
upon <hi>Kings</hi> for their <hi>Kingdoms</hi> Wickedneſs, <hi>God</hi> deſigning them as Pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſhments
and Tryals for the Peoples Amendment; but in his appointed
time is wont to <hi>Turn him to the Prayer of the poor deſtitute, and not to
deſpiſe their deſire.</hi> And although <hi>God</hi> doth ſometimes afflict, yet he pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tronizeth
<hi>the Cauſe of Kings,</hi> and calleth it his <hi>own.</hi> And the very ſuc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſs
of the wicked is an aſſurance of their approaching fall; for it is al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>way
by them tyrannically and ſavagely uſed, and accompanied with
ſuch prodigious haughtineſs, that the expectation muſt be inevitable
ruine.</p>
               <p>Theſe interchangeable ſorrows and hopes did once long contend for
victory in the minds of the <hi>Loyal party</hi> of theſe <hi>Kingdoms.</hi> The delays
and improbabilities of our <hi>moſt Gracious Kings Reſtauration</hi> (after we
had ſeen His <hi>Bleſſed Father</hi> exalted to a more <hi>glorious Crown</hi>) gave grief
<pb n="26" facs="tcp:56685:17"/>
the longer poſſeſſion. But our reaſon (when grief well nigh ſpent would
permit us the uſe of it) ſhewed us the impoſſibility of ſuch ſanguinary
Pride long continuing, or that thoſe mens inſatiable deſires, which by
receiving were the more extended, till at length they were <hi>enlarged as
Hell,</hi> ſhould wanting ſupplies abroad not fall to feed upon their own In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtruments
firſt, afterward one upon another, and in the end ravingly ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpire.
This reaſon was ſtrengthened by a firm belief that <hi>God</hi> would not
ſuffer ſuch and ſo much blood to cry unrevenged, that <hi>the patient abiding
of the Meek ſhould not alway be forgotten,</hi> but that our <hi>God</hi> would be plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed
to <hi>ſhew a token upon us for good, that they who hated us, might be aſham<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed.</hi>
Our fears were more durable, but our hopes by theſe dependencies
and encouragements were more quick and powerful, and in the end
vanquiſhing our fears were themſelves loſt in the following pleaſant
and celeſtial enjoyments. The benefits whereof, I humbly beſeech
<hi>God,</hi> we may by our virtues and pious thankfulneſs make truely our own,
and by ſuch patterns leave the poſſeſſion of Poſterities.</p>
               <p>But the foul interruption, which ill men have by indirect counſels
made, putteth us again upon the rack, and giveth even the name of <hi>Joy</hi>
but an unwelcom reception, until judicious <hi>Hope</hi> relieveth us with aſſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rances
that their expectation is but ſhort, and ſheweth us the <hi>Achitophels</hi>
politickly contriving the frame and as cunningly erecting the Ladder,
from the top of which they may boaſt their ſucceſs and give perpetuity
to their memories. Each <hi>dutiful Subject</hi> in the mean time with a lamen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting
care beholdeth his <hi>Princes</hi> troubles and the fate of thoſe, who ſo oc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>caſion
them. And (ſuch is the uſual courſe of <hi>Divine Rewards</hi> deſcen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding
upon prudent <hi>Obedience</hi>) although he is leaſt in his own thoughts,
yet by all his faculties endeavouring it, he beginneth his own proſperity
at his <hi>Soveraignes.</hi> Being careleſs of all even life it ſelf, that is, being
reſolutely willing to expoſe all that is deareſt to him as the purchaſe of
the <hi>Kings peace,</hi> he beſt keepeth and ſecureth his <hi>All.</hi> By this means
his <hi>adverſity</hi> is ſhortned, his <hi>joy</hi> rendred more durable and copious.</p>

They who repent not what Injuries they committed againſt the <hi>Father,</hi>
could not ſincerely Pray for the <hi>Sons</hi> Peaceable <hi>Return,</hi> as to His Juſt
and undoubted <hi>Rights;</hi> and what they could not Pray for, they could
not cheerfully rejoyce in: And they who uſe all Scurrilous wayes of
ſhewing a diſlike to <hi>that Church,</hi> whereof he, is pleaſed to declare Him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf
a Reſolute <hi>Defender,</hi> cannot love Him, who Defendeth what they
hate: For certainly they, who Threaten and ſpare not to ſpeak their
Hopes of our <hi>Churches</hi> downfal, muſt ruine the <hi>Defender,</hi> before they
can fix any fatal Weapon in her. As I confine <hi>Joy</hi> to <hi>Religion,</hi> ſo <hi>Joy</hi> and
<hi>Religion</hi> to the love of <hi>Vnity:</hi> It <hi>was</hi> for <hi>Vnity</hi>'s ſake (as knowing none
but a <hi>King, Gods Ordinance</hi> could reſtore it, and that an <hi>Vſurper</hi> could
not be <hi>Gods Ordinance,</hi> neither <hi>Vnity</hi> conſiſt with his Intereſt) that the
<hi>Faithful</hi> were in ſuch trouble, and Prayed day and night with ſuch fer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vency.
When by our <hi>Lords</hi> gracious reſpects to their Petitions, the
<hi>Grand Artificer, Inſtrument and Means</hi> were given, they could not be
partners either in the <hi>Petitions</hi> or <hi>Joy,</hi> who would not be wrought up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
to contribute to the <hi>Vnity,</hi> but like ſo many <hi>Sanballats</hi> and <hi>Ammo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nites,</hi>
were rather <hi>exceedingly grieved that there was come a Man to ſeek the
Welfare of Gods people;</hi> as not withſtanding their firſt Pretences, their after
Scoffs and Oppoſitions, and their late practices have manifeſted. Now
theſe men by His <hi>Majeſties</hi> mild <hi>Reign</hi> and maniſold <hi>Indulgentes</hi> are
Rich, living in Eaſe and Plenty, wanting nothing that conduceth to
<hi>Joy,</hi> which is within the Immenſe Power of a <hi>King</hi> to give: Yet want
of Gratitude and Piety makes Contentment wanting; ſo that in fine,
they have, but rejoyce not in the Bleſſings, which make glad the Hearts
of others. If (as they have over-boaſted) they were of thoſe, who de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſired
and prepared the way for the <hi>Kings Return;</hi> yet to offer this with
<hi>Propoſitions</hi> and upon <hi>Terms,</hi> (which was Diſloyalty, as tending to His
Diſhonour) or upon ſuch <hi>Hopes</hi> as the granting them was inconſiſtent
with the <hi>Splendor</hi> and <hi>Safety</hi> of His <hi>Crown,</hi> or upon <hi>Revenge</hi> to an In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferior
<hi>Faction,</hi> which ungratefully Uſurped Authority over thoſe, who
Tutored and Nurſed it up, had none of the reſpects and zeal of <hi>Good
Subjects,</hi> nor could they entertain true <hi>Joy,</hi> who were blindly tranſpor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted
with divers Luſts and Intemperate Deſires. The <hi>Joy</hi> for the <hi>King</hi> and
<pb n="29" facs="tcp:56685:18"/>
                  <hi>Kingdoms Peace</hi> reſtored as the greateſt of <hi>Divine Mercies,</hi> requireth a
Serene mind, free from all miſts and vapors of Paſſions, all dreggs of
Luſt, Envy and Malice, and all whifling clouds of Irreſolute Fancy,
a mind ſatisfied with the diſcharge of its duty, and which by preſent
perceptions hath a fair proſpect of greater Benefits, which theſe beauti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful
ones only uſher in to ſtrengthen <hi>Faith</hi> and cheriſh holy <hi>Expectation.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>But while my Reſtrictions are of this ſort, they may ſeem to exclude
from this <hi>Joy</hi> all <hi>Subjects,</hi> none having minds ſo clear and innocent, as
never to admit any thing contrary to thoſe preſcribed Qualifications.
And indeed every admiſſion is a diminution, or weakning of it, indi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpoſing
mens Appetites to the reliſhing thoſe admirably pleaſant Fruits,
which <hi>Providence</hi> hath ſet ſo plentifully before them. And with uncon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtant
minds, nothing ſooner prevaileth to a diſlike than the Plenty,
Wantonneſs making them ſnuffe upon theſe unvaluable Delights, whoſe
nouriſhment is too high for their unrefined Conſtitutions. But as
to what is incident to Humanity, the beſt of men have ſuffered under
ſome ſurprizals of infirmity, and do rather ſometimes forget, than com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mit
againſt the ſtrictneſs of Duty, ſo that by the abatement of their Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cred
pleaſures they are quickned to it again. Now ſuch as by their Vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gilance
overcome evil paſſions and condemnable motions, I ſpeak In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nocent
and pure from them accounting love and deſire of perfection to
be the fulneſs of the vertues required. For it is but reaſon that as <hi>God</hi>
accepteth them, man ſhould eſteem them; and he indeed putteth the
full value upon Faithful endeavours. And (as to the preſent Diſcourſe)
the deſires of being Loyally obedient is a through <hi>Obedience,</hi> which will
not be miſguided by Paſsions, improper expectations, bottomleſs con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceits
and ſuſpicions, or revengeful hopes, but rejoyceth in the perfor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mance
of its duty making it ſelf its chief reward. An obedient man de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſireth
and endeavoureth <hi>Peace,</hi> and being obtained imbraceth and keep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth
it as ſtudiouſly as he laboured for it, Praying for its Bleſſed conti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nuance,
loving all that joyn with him in the ſame Affections, and hating
none but as they are its Enemies. <hi>Peace</hi> is his deſire, his delight and
glory, the end of all his Actions, the emblem of his Eternal recom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pence,
his Heaven upon Earth. And this no corrupt minds can truly re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>joyce
in; they may peradventure be pleaſed with it for a time, but are
ſoon glutted with its pleaſures and ſtores, grow inſolent and kick at her
Bleſsings. But good men cannot ſurſeit upon her favours, though abun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dantly
ſatisfied with them. For in ſound minds the ſame plenty be
getteth deſire, which in depraved, groweth to an abhorrency. Neither
can <hi>Peace</hi> be obtained by evil or unſtable men, any more then continue
<pb n="30" facs="tcp:56685:19"/>
by them, when it is in their power to diſturb it: For the <hi>Sacred Oracle</hi>
declaring, that <hi>there is no peace to the wicked,</hi> they certainly can never
give that to others, which they cannot procure for themſelves, or
brook in others. So that to be able to rejoyce in <hi>Peace,</hi> every man muſt
conform to a Virtuous Life, and be wife with Sobriety. For vitious
living enclineth men to anger, ſuſpitions and all ſorts of unruly courſes,
and generally begetteth in them an over-value of their own Judgments
and Abilities; which hath been ſadly experienced in ſome of the great
Debauches of our times.</p>
               <p>Some men again well deſerving, and who have been long known to
govern themſelves in the proper rules of this <hi>Joy,</hi> have at length become
too apprehenſive of being uſeful, and thereby have ceaſed to become
<hi>Good Subjects,</hi> a proud confidence deſtroying that Loyalty, which
had been admirably excellent, had it continued among <hi>the works and la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bours
of Love.</hi> Becauſe they hear that well doing deſerveth a reward, they
wrong their judgments in reaching at an immature one, and too much
diſcover a long concealed malignity in their minds, which hath diſtur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bed
their <hi>Joy</hi> although without publick obſervation. For where there are
illegitimate hopes, there muſt be ſometimes great fears, which (as we
ſee) break out into diſorders, and are ever diſturbing the contentment
of the Soul, which by well doing only ſhould be kept in tranquility.
The Pious ſatisfaction of <hi>Gods</hi> great favour in hearing the cries of his
afflicted people, and reſtoring to us our <hi>Dread Soveraign in Peace,</hi> and
the virtuous care of continuing this mercy certainly mind nothing but
<hi>God</hi> and the <hi>Kings'</hi> approbation. If theſe performances obſerved pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duce
any further <hi>Grace,</hi> it is venerably received, not as a recompence,
but a Princely condeſcention and Bounty. Good <hi>Mephiboſheths Loyalty</hi>
is an incomparable pattern, who was ſo truly glad of his <hi>Princes Return,</hi>
that the <hi>Joy</hi> was to him a Poſſeſsion; for other things he careth not, but
ſaith Calumniating <hi>Ziba, Yea, let him take all, foraſmuch as my Lord
the King is come again in Peace.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>But ſome of the great pretender to <hi>Loyalty</hi> have ſtained the glorious
repute, which they had gotten, at a moſt fooliſh rate. For where the
<hi>King</hi> hath been pleaſed to accept the Services of ſome <hi>Subjects,</hi> and to
ſignalize them with grants of eminent <hi>Indulgences;</hi> they who were pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fitable
<hi>Servants,</hi> became fooliſh <hi>Favourites,</hi> and what they have indu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtriouſly
managed to their <hi>Princes</hi> advantage in an Inferior Station, their
Pride hath ruined in advancement. For wanting continence in elated
Fortunes, they though their Deeds merit, not Duty; and judging
themſelves ſuch men of excellence, that the <hi>Scepter</hi> could not be weild<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
<pb n="31" facs="tcp:56685:19"/>
without their councell, they have preſumed to act above the condi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
of <hi>Subjects,</hi> forgetting their Original and the Humility which gave
their Honour a Being. And theſe were ſo far from following <hi>Mephibo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſheth</hi>'s
example of leaving all for <hi>Joy,</hi> that they have thought nothing
ſufficient reward, which accumulative liberality hath laid upon them.
And indeed herein the ſtrength of their judgments met with the ſevereſt
tryal. For they, who could laudably ſuſtain and overcome the ſharpeſt
adverſities, have been drawn into a ſnare by the blandiſhments of <hi>For<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tune,</hi>
and their <hi>Fortitude</hi> being eneruated by her leniments, ſhe hath
led them about as the moſt ridiculous Captives. So eaſily are heedleſs
men diveſted of their <hi>Joy,</hi> in the midſt of their Triumphs, by yielding
to the beginning of temptations of making reward the chief induce<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
to <hi>Loyalty.</hi>

               <p>TRue <hi>Loyalty</hi> is ſo little ſwayed by intereſt, that it is its own con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tentment,

excellency of the Example biddeth me again repeat it, and make Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>marques
upon the ſacred <hi>Hiſtory</hi> or <hi>Mephiboſheth.</hi> He was the <hi>Son</hi> of
<hi>Saul,</hi> (as the Holy Text ſpeaketh it in the relation of that action more
obſervably) yet came down with an unparallel'd <hi>Joy</hi> to meet King <hi>David</hi>
returning from Exilement. This <hi>Mephiboſheth</hi> was <hi>Heir Apparent</hi>
to the <hi>Crown</hi> of <hi>Iſrael,</hi> as it reſpecteth the <hi>Houſe of Saul,</hi> being the
Son of <hi>Jonathan, Saul</hi>'s eldeſt Son. Neither the reflections upon his
diſinheriſon not withſtanding his Title by a moſt direct deſcent, nor <hi>Da<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vid</hi>'s
preceipitate diſpoſſeſſing him of his Lands, upon the falſe accuſati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons
of <hi>Ziba</hi> his ſervant before he had liberty to anſwer for himſelf, did
any thing prevail with him to leſſen his affections to the <hi>King,</hi> or his
gladneſs that he was <hi>returned in Peace.</hi> The <hi>King</hi> indeed had ſent for
him to <hi>eat at his own Table,</hi> and reſtored unto him all his Patrimony.
<pb n="32" facs="tcp:56685:20"/>
But the reſpect to his ſucceſſion could ſoon have fitted him with replies;
That the ſpecious <hi>Kindneſs</hi> of calling him to <hi>Court</hi> might be both <hi>pride,</hi>
and <hi>policy; pride,</hi> to render his own <hi>Majeſty</hi> the more awful by ſo great
a <hi>Princes</hi> attendance; And <hi>policy,</hi> to keep him near him alwaies in view,
that ſo he might not be able to cauſe Sedition or Innovation. And then
what did an Inheritance (which, his <hi>Title</hi> to the <hi>Crown</hi> conſidered,
was but part of his right) in a corner of one of the <hi>Tribes</hi> ſignifie to a
man thoughtful of the loſs of a <hi>Kingdom?</hi> What was it but an occaſion
for his Brethren the <hi>Benjamites</hi> to upbraid him with want of courage and
judgment, who ſhould ſo tamely <hi>acquieſce</hi> in this as a favour, and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tent
himſelf with a <hi>private Fortune,</hi> who was born unto ſo glorious a
<hi>Scepter?</hi> But <hi>piety</hi> quaſht all theſe ſuggeſtions (ſo apt to ſwell and puff
up a young <hi>Princes</hi> mind) and gave him a moſt ſacred Judgment to
diſcern <hi>God</hi>'s <hi>Work</hi> and <hi>Decree,</hi> and taught him by meekneſs to enjoy
himſelf, and all that the <hi>King</hi> beſtowed upon him as truly <hi>Royal favours.</hi>
The ſame <hi>Almighty power,</hi> which exalted his <hi>Grandfather Saul</hi> to be
<hi>King,</hi> had for diſobedience to his commands denounced by the ſame
<hi>Prophet,</hi> who anointed him, the <hi>renting away of his Kingdom and giving
it to his Neighbour,</hi> and ſoon after the denunciation cauſed <hi>David</hi> by the
ſame <hi>Prophet</hi> to be anointed. That he was ordained <hi>King</hi> by <hi>God,</hi>
                  <hi>Saul</hi> knew and envied him for it, and often endeavoured to fruſtrate the
<hi>Divine Decree</hi> by killing him; This <hi>Jonathan</hi> knew and loved him; this
<hi>Mephiboſheth</hi> knew, and thence gave him the Honour, which true <hi>Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jeſty</hi>
demanded and <hi>Conſcience</hi> enjoyned ſhould be given by all <hi>Subjects.</hi>
This being a well weighed ground for him to deſpiſe his own <hi>Title,</hi> he
ſaw as little cauſe to be angry at the diſpoſing his eſtate to treacherous
<hi>Ziba.</hi> He conſidered it to be the <hi>King</hi>'s meer bounty at firſt, and was
thankful for ſo long a time of enjoyment. And his <hi>Joy</hi> at the <hi>King</hi>'s
<hi>Return</hi> was only leſſened by pity, that the <hi>Crown,</hi> which <hi>taketh away
all perſonal defects,</hi> did not as well remove the defects of the mind, and
make the <hi>King</hi> leſs humane by being infallible. With all wiſe men a
large and ponderous good begetteth oblivion of a ſmall inconvenience or
evil, (none but fools bemoaning the loſs of trifles, and purſuing them
in their thoughts to the contempt of ſolid pleaſures) and with all good
men the <hi>publick good</hi> is the greateſt. That vulgar expreſſion, <hi>That eve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry
man is neareſt to himſelf,</hi> is only true in reſpect to Neighbourhood and
private commerce, but never (that I know or have heard) owned by
men of any underſtanding to extend to the Publick. For thoſe very
men, who ſeek themſelves only by the ruine of others placed above
them, hypocritically move under the ſhadow of the <hi>General Welfare,</hi>
                  <pb n="33" facs="tcp:56685:20"/>
becauſe Mankind univerſally abhorreth any ſuch Poſition, That <hi>Private
Injuries are to be revenged by a publick miſchief.</hi> Therefore diſcontented
Perſons we ſee ſhunned as peſtiferous, there's no coming near them
without danger, nor letting them abroad with ſafety, until they are
throughly purged and cured. If once a real wrong done by his <hi>Prince</hi>
(as ſuch may happen to be ſuſtained) ſhall juſtifie a <hi>Subjects</hi> diſorders,
innumerable fained or ſuppoſed ones will continually appear to the de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtruction
of <hi>Peace</hi> and <hi>Government.</hi> Now a wiſe man conſidereth, that
if by any miſreſentation of him to his <hi>Prince</hi> (as was <hi>Mephiboſheth</hi>'s
caſe) he hath undergone ſome damages, by his diligent continuing in
his <hi>duty</hi> and <hi>Allegiance</hi> he may become obſerved, and probably repaid
with advantage; but if not, that injuries of this nature are more diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>creetly
diſſembled than reparation proſecuted, which is both difficult,
unjuſt and ill natured. For ſuch is the power of a <hi>King,</hi> that <hi>he that
provoketh him</hi> is generally ſeen to <hi>ſin againſt his own Soul;</hi> his <hi>hopes</hi> are
ſtronger than his <hi>Arms, Wit,</hi> or <hi>Religion.</hi> And withal they are as ill
grounded as his <hi>Religion,</hi> which requireth the <hi>Subject</hi> in this caſe above
all others (if there ſhould in a <hi>King</hi> appear manifeſt intentions of
wrong doing) to leave <hi>Vengeance to God.</hi> By endeavouring to do him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf
juſtice he ſacrilegiouſly robbeth <hi>God</hi> of his <hi>Prerogative.</hi> But if his
Power be ſuppoſed to equal his <hi>Soveraigns,</hi> yet how barbarouſly ill<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>natur'd
is he, who by the deſtruction of multitudes of Innocents aim<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth
to arrive at ſatisfaction, uncertain whether he ſhall recover, or add
his guilty Soul to his other loſſes? <hi>Religion</hi> (wherein is contained <hi>pru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence</hi>
and <hi>Mercy</hi>) directeth a <hi>Subject</hi> better, and ſilenceth him from ſo
much as complaining out of Joy, that his caſe is ſingular, that it is no
worſe with him, and that the reſt of his fellow <hi>Subjects</hi> are pleaſant and
happy. Nothing with him ſavoureth more of diſingenuity than to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>face
the bliſs of a <hi>general Feſtivity</hi> with Tears, or mix with laments the
<hi>Peoples</hi> acclamations. If by bad Offices his good be maliciouſly or
fraudulently evil ſpoken of and any thing unworthy his <hi>Vertue</hi> and <hi>Loy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>alty</hi>
doth thereby happen unto him, he looketh upon his <hi>Prince</hi> as chiefly
injured by the approach of Sycophants to his <hi>Sacred Perſon,</hi> and only
wondring at the Impudence with Indignation hath a ſhort diverſion
from his <hi>Joy</hi> by conſidering that <hi>God</hi> giveth in his tlife no pleaſures
without mixture of ſomewhat ſharp, becauſe he will have per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect
<hi>Felicity</hi> another <hi>Worlds Glory,</hi> the <hi>Fruition</hi> of man tranſlated
to <hi>the ſtate of Incorruption.</hi> Immediately from theſe thoughts he is
reſtored to his uſual liberty and improveth his <hi>Joy</hi> by theſe accidents.
For when the craft of the <hi>Devil,</hi> and cunning devices of men would
<pb n="34" facs="tcp:56685:21"/>
put him out of his proper ſtation, and tempt him to reſign his internal
<hi>Peace,</hi> he glorieth that it is not in the power of enmity to diſturb that
without a voluntary ſurrender, and that <hi>God</hi> bleſſeth his ſincerity, with
reſolutions to retain his own, to adhere firmly to his <hi>Obedience,</hi> and to
rejoyce with his fellow Subjects for the common Safety. To do the
Will of <hi>God</hi> is his Felicity, and it is no leſs to bear it. And although
like <hi>Mordecai</hi> that ſpake good for the <hi>King,</hi> he bears <hi>Haman</hi>'s indigna<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion,
yet he continueth unaltered; he cheefully waiteth the time of
being made known, although not extreamly Solicitious, whether in this
Life or another. Neither again will he juſtify a malignant Detracter by
acting, or ſo much as Speaking to the leaſt Diſhonour of his <hi>Maſter,</hi>
but ſtill pleaſantly and obediently intendeth his <hi>Peace</hi> and <hi>Welfare</hi> to the
utmoſt of his power, and ſo <hi>putteth te ſilence</hi> the Calumnies <hi>of fooliſh men.</hi>
He at firſt prayed for the <hi>publick Peace;</hi> and <hi>God</hi> anſwering his Peti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions,
he is reſolved not to break it. He prayed for the Proſperity of
the <hi>Church,</hi> to which the <hi>publick Peace</hi> chiefly conduceth; his peculiar
outward loſſes are no hindrance to it; therefore his <hi>Religion</hi> being ſecure,
ſo is he; the <hi>Church</hi> flouriſhing, he is happy; the <hi>King</hi> in the defence
thereof graciouſly encouraging and promoting the Faithful, and curbing
the inſolence of Gainſayers, he hath the deſire of his Soul; Gods Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vants
Religiouſly aſſembled to thank him for the general <hi>Redemption</hi> of
mankind by <hi>the blood of his Son,</hi> for the particular <hi>Redemption</hi> of theſe
parts of his <hi>Church</hi> among us, and all other his mercies exhibited to us,
and to Pray for a continuance and encreaſe of his loving kindneſs to us,
and to all men; upon the wings of theſe Devotions is he wrapt up into
<hi>Paradice.</hi> His virtue is extreamly reproached by thoughts that he,
who hath ſuch bliſsful preceptions, can deſcend from them to the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiderations
of ſome Temporal diſadvantages. His and the common way

            <p>THe conſideration of our advancement as <hi>Men</hi> and <hi>Chriſtians,</hi> im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſeth
on us a neceſſity to be <hi>Good</hi> and <hi>Juſt,</hi> and Subjection being
our natural condition, cannot be any way uneaſie or improſperous, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out
our either imprudent or wanton renunciation of it: By aiming at what
is ſet above us, we uſually fall beneath thoſe inferioritis, which we be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
viewed with contempt; for the injuſtce of our diſcountented <hi>Pride</hi>
hath not a more proper recompence. Inviolate <hi>Prerogatives</hi> are the <hi>Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jects
Safety and Honour,</hi> and the ſureſt <hi>Charter</hi> of their <hi>Freedom,</hi> which
protect them from injury, who have never practiſed to their diminu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
or weakning. Let <hi>Reaſon</hi> or <hi>Intereſt</hi> be conſulted, the reſolve will
be, that the leaſt invaſion of them is unjuſt, and not to be attempted by
any, that are good and wiſe, becauſe certainly prejudicing the general
Welfare. Men of unſetled but ſelf-confident Councels, think themſelves
great and able for the moſt eminent Atchievements, and ſufficient for the
higheſt flight, if but bedeckt withſome of the <hi>Ealges Plumes;</hi> but being
too feeble for the work and conſequent weight of envy do ſhame their
undertakings and followers, whom ſome <hi>Name of reproach</hi> ſignifying
their folly and crime diſtinguiſheth from the reſt of mankind. Additions
to them, or at leaſt fortifications of ſuch as impairing time hath in any
part enfeebled, are looked upon by all that judiciouſly mind their own
preſervation to be continually neceſſary. For the <hi>Prerogative</hi> of the
<hi>Crown</hi> rendred infirm do inevitably cauſe to halt the <hi>Priviledges</hi> of the
<hi>Members,</hi> which may peradventure ſwell high, but then ſpeak their
Sicklineſs and Fate, and that they then incline moſt to Diſſolution.
Without doubt that <hi>Kingdom</hi> is moſt Happy, where Diſcourſes of this
nature are leaſt heard: But on the other hand it much more conduceth
to the <hi>publick Good,</hi> that the <hi>Prince</hi> be rigourous, even to the brink of
<hi>Tyranny,</hi> then addicted to <hi>Lenity</hi> and eaſie <hi>Conceſſions</hi> of Popular de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mands.
The errors of the firſt ſort are little felt, and ſcarce diſcernible;
thoſe of the latter are univerſally and apparently pernicious. But in no
part are the <hi>Prerogatives</hi> more dangerouſly intrench'd upon then in thoſe,
which concern <hi>Religion,</hi> wherein the <hi>People</hi> by ſeeking, and the <hi>Prince</hi>
by yeilding, do the ſame as when Fond <hi>Parents</hi> to their crying <hi>Children</hi>

theſe terms being taken up premeditatly to the Diſſolution of

whom <hi>Rebellion, Blood</hi> and <hi>Devaſtation</hi> hath ſeparated from her? Such
<hi>Vnitings</hi> are the Debauches of <hi>Religion,</hi> and the directeſt courſes to
the Subverting <hi>Monarchy</hi> and <hi>Hierarchy.</hi> What Fury did before Act,
is now required to have a legal Introduction: And although we abhorr
the Murderers of <hi>Kings</hi> and <hi>Prince,</hi> and give Sacrilegious men their
merited Epithites, yet that theſe be by opinion admitted into the great
Employes of <hi>State</hi> and Boſome of the <hi>Church,</hi> no Contrition or deſires
of Reconciliation preceding, is the beſt preſcribed <hi>Rule</hi> of <hi>Preſervation</hi>
and <hi>Canon</hi> of <hi>Eccleſiaſtical Communion.</hi> In fine, the much applauded
<hi>Projectors</hi> of our <hi>Conſtitutions</hi> of <hi>Peace,</hi> do no otherwiſe then tell us,
that to prevent the Potency of ſuch as are feared will ſpare neither <hi>King</hi>
nor <hi>Church;</hi> our only courſe is to promote and Impower thoſe, whoſe
hatred to both is known and implacable. It is not to be doubted but that
the Indulgences and Connivances of theſe times, have raiſed to this
height of Inſolence (as their accuſtomed gratitude) the Spirits of theſe
Zealots; and thence is to be conjectured their future deportment upon
a <hi>Toleration</hi> fortified with Legality. <hi>Reaſon</hi> not aſſiſted by the ſadeſt
Domeſtick Experiences, ſheweth any <hi>Toleration</hi> of diverſities of <hi>Reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gions</hi>
to be of ill conſequence; but that inevitably deſtructive to <hi>Monar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chy,</hi>
which ceaſeth to be a favour, and ſtanding guarded with one Law,
is enabled to command more, and at length what it will. All theſe miſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chiefs
(which the humourous Multitude, led by ſome Peſtilent Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cellors,
eſteem their Happineſs, till the pungent ſting of their enjoy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments
ſharpen them to an apprehenſion of their folly) <hi>Good Subjects</hi> re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolutely
oppoſe, yet behold with pitty, to ſee <hi>Religious Aſſemblies</hi> void
of <hi>Piety, Kingdoms,</hi> whoſe <hi>Adminiſtrator</hi> of <hi>Juſtice</hi> hath his hands
bound, and <hi>Obedience Charity, Humility,</hi> and all other <hi>Virtues</hi> dwindle
into names only, ſtir up their magnanimous Souls by commiſeration to
cares of Relief: And this they diſcern no way to be effected, but by re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtoring
and confirming their <hi>King</hi> to and in His <hi>Royal Prerogatives,</hi> by
promoting his <hi>Peace,</hi> that by it all <hi>may live a quiet and peaceable life in
all godlineſs and honeſty.</hi> And as they are herein zealous, ſo conſtant, not
apt to be diverted by the gawdy hopes of Change, nor diſencouraged
either by ſuſpition of diſreſpected merit, or apparentcy of good ſervices
<pb n="37" facs="tcp:56685:22"/>
ill repay'd. They Act knowingly and ſo are above Change; and their
generous minds admit not the torments of Suſpition, unleſs of deficiency
in themſelves. And this ſame temper inclineth them to an aſſurance, that
beſides his <hi>Princly</hi> inclinations the <hi>Kings</hi> Intereſt diverſeth him from
remunerating <hi>Loyally</hi> with injuries; which, if at any time thy befal
a <hi>Good Subject,</hi> he conſidereth, and findeth them to proceed from the
ill repreſentation of envious Detractours, a ſort of State Moths, which
cannot without great difficulty be kept out of the Linings of the <hi>Crown.</hi>
Reward is leaſt in their deſires, (except that great one, the innocent
Glory of well performing) and nothing but omiſſion of duty can afflict
them; thence they are <hi>ſtedfaſt and unmoveable, knowing that their labour
is not in vain,</hi> but that their recompence and inheritance ſhall be for
ever.</p>
            <p>And now that <hi>Peace</hi> and <hi>Love</hi> may unite us under our <hi>Head,</hi> by the
virtuous government of our ſelves let us work His Security. By vitious
living all miſchief is propagated; that introduceth ruine of <hi>Subjects,</hi> and
bringeth contempt upon <hi>Princes,</hi> who become not <hi>Governours</hi> of Men,
but <hi>Kings</hi> of Beaſts, and <hi>God</hi> angry that his ineſteemable <hi>Pearls are caſt
before Swine,</hi> ſurrendereth them to the poſſeſſion of the <hi>Legion.</hi> That
inſuperable <hi>Goodneſs,</hi> which magnifieth its <hi>power moſt chiefly in ſhewing
mercy and pity,</hi> is wearied and made deficient by ingratitude; nay more,
is converted into fury by our miſguided and corrupted affections. It is
from this cauſe that the clamours and murmurings, too much heard in
our Land, do proceed. Vices abounding, encreaſe Suſpitions, prepare men
for ſtrifes, and multiply diſorders: then theſe make mens minds <hi>like the
troubled Sea,</hi> to <hi>caſt up mire and dirt.</hi> And indeed <hi>God</hi> ſeemeth to have
abandoned a great part of this wretched Nation to the Curſe of their
own follies and imaginations, to delight in Seduction, and to believe
Lies, becauſe they would not retain the diſcipline and order of holy <hi>Peace</hi>
and <hi>Joy.</hi> Continually leading Lives contrary to Divine Obligations and
their own Profeſſions; they were brought firſt to ſuſpect what they
knew, afterward to believe what they ſuſpected. They have loſt their
<hi>Reaſon,</hi> by becoming enemies to <hi>Virtue</hi> its illuſtrious <hi>Guardian;</hi> ſo that
the reclaiming them is an impoſſibility to all but a miraculous Compaſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion.
This happening to many, ought to be the more exemplary to
others. All of us who ſee their miſcarriges, and the cauſe, ſhould be
as quickſighted into the ways of duty, and keep our ſelves happy by
loving and eſteeming <hi>Peace,</hi> that is, by an holy care of continning
affectionatly zealous of <hi>Gods Honour,</hi> obeying his <hi>Ordinance</hi> with true
<hi>Love</hi> and a pure <hi>Conſcience.</hi> Let us therefore duely offer up our Thanks<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>givings
<pb n="38" facs="tcp:56685:23"/>
for what we enjoy, and perfect them by <hi>Obedience,</hi> by the hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mility
and ſincerity of which, let us aſpire each man to an Immortal
<hi>Crown,</hi> magnanimouſly raiſing our <hi>Subjection</hi> to <hi>Heaven,</hi> by imitating
the Lowlineſs and Meekneſs of the <hi>King</hi> of <hi>Kings.</hi> Amen.</p>
