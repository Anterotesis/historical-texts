            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

And she said, why do you ask me, and Coll. <hi>Cornwall</hi> said, he did not lye at home last night; then <hi>Nell Guin</hi> said, we shall see him come out by and by like a drowned Mouse, and so I went to make my Lady Dutchess Bed, and found a Handkerchief and Ruffles. And Mrs. <hi>Kniveson</hi> came and said, come hither and I will shew you a sight, and when I came, there lay a Shirt and Wastcoat, and I took them away, because it was a place that any body as they came, might see them, and my Lord Duke was not in Town.</p>

               <p>There is one thing, that I find my Wife is setting up to have a great Equipage, this I do not like: I hear, said he, she is about to have a Coach, Horses, and two or three Footmen.

And so I went from the Duke of <hi>Norfolk</hi> to the Dutchess, and told her what the Duke said; and my Lord of <hi>Peterborough</hi> hearing of it, he was angry that I went to the Duke.</p>

               <p>The Dutchess, she came over again in 86; after that she stayed in <hi>England</hi> some Time, and about the time of the Revolution; then it was given out, that she was gone over again.</p>

            <sp>
               <speaker>Att. Gen.</speaker>
               <p>For as all unlawful Conversations must have a beginning, it is necessary we should shew something of that and the Time, and that doth fortifie the Evidence that is given within the Time.</p>

               <p>Pray my Lord, if you Lordship please; This is the use we make in giving in Evidence, somethings before, to shew the Fact within the six Years, their frequent meeting in a Lascivious manner; and we make use of that before the six Years, to explain what use we make of it, in matters done done within the six Years.</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>Serj. Tremain.</speaker>
               <p>I do appeal to your Lordship, and all that hear me, whether within this six Years they have proved any Lascivious Action, or any undecent Action, so that this will not charge the Defendant; for if the Dutchess will come to his House, when he is not at home, he cannot help it. All the Proof is without the six Years, and no Proof within the six Years to charge him to inflict such a Crime. If they had car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ried it down, as to have proved Acts within the six Years, I should have said they have done something.</p>

               <p>GEntlemen of the Jury, you understand very well the Nature of this Action, and the Record has been opened to you, which was to this effect,</p>
               <p>That the Defendant the <hi>2d</hi> Day of <hi>April,</hi> in the <hi>2d</hi> Year of the Late King <hi>Iames,</hi> he did intice a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>way the Plantiffs Dutchess, whereby he had not the Benefit of her Society, and that he had Lascivious Conversation with her, lived in Adultery with her and caused her to Commit Adultery. The Defen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dant pleaded that he did not commit any thing within this six Years.</p>
               <p>Gentlemen, what hath been before, is not now to be taken Notice of;</p>
               <p>But the Plantiffs Council hath given in Evidence of some Acts before, which is not for any Damages, as we exprest before; but to explain some Actions that hath been between them.</p>
               <p>For my part, I must declare that these matters may be given in Evidence to explain; but they are not to be given in Evidence to any other purpose.</p>
               <p>The first Witness, is one <hi>Owen,</hi> and he telleth you, that he was sent to <hi>White-Hall,</hi> and he saith that he went into the Lodgings there, and then he did see the Dutchess and <hi>Germain</hi> in Bed toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther.</p>
               <p>Then there is another Witness, that proves it another Time and Place, That is <hi>Margaret Ellwood,</hi> and she telleth you in what manner she found the Dutchess, and <hi>Germain</hi> was very Angry at her, and that his Hat and Sword lay upon the Table; and you are told by her, that looking through the Key-Hole, she perceived them in Bed: she said the Curtains at the Beds-Feet was actually open, and she saw them in Bed together, and found <hi>Germains</hi> Handkerchief and Ruffles in my Lady's Bed.</p>
               <p>The next Witness is one <hi>Anne Benskin,</hi> and she saith, they were in expectation of him one Night at <hi>Windsor,</hi> they stayed up till Two a Clock, and laid Chairs and Stools in his way, that if he came, he might fall, but he did not come down that time: All this is about Seven Years ago, and out of the time mentioned in the Declaration; and then after they come, and begin about the Year 1689. and they tell you of a Lodging taken at <hi>Fox Hall,</hi> at one <hi>Scriber's</hi> House, for a couple of Ladies, one went by the name of <hi>Bateman,</hi> and the other <hi>Brian;</hi> during that time, the Man of the House knew nothing of one that went by the name of Mr. <hi>Germaine,</hi> but of my Lady's Brother; he had been seen walking in the Garden: They tell you, they have seen that Lady that went by the name of the Lady <hi>Bateman;</hi> and that very Lady was the same that was the Dutchess of <hi>Norfolk:</hi> And the Wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terman saith, That he hath carried him often by Water, and he went by the name of my Lady <hi>Bateman</hi>'s Brother: He hath carried him from the Stairs in <hi>Channel-Row</hi> to <hi>Fox-Hall,</hi> when the Lady <hi>Bateman</hi> lodged there; and hath carried Wood from <hi>Fox-Hall,</hi> by the Lady <hi>Bateman</hi>'s Order, to the <hi>Cock-Pit,</hi> and there is no manner of question, but Mr. <hi>Germaine</hi>'s House is at the <hi>Cock-Pit.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>But then they come to Mrs. <hi>Wadsworth,</hi> and she is a Woman that lived next Door, and she had oc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>casion to go to <hi>Germaine</hi>'s House for a Pint Pot, and there coming, she met with a <hi>Dutch-</hi>Woman, and asked her for the Pint Pot, she saith, she bade her go up stairs for it, which she did, and then she saw the Dutchess of <hi>Norfolk</hi> undressed, in a Morning Gown, she said she very well knew her, she had seen her many times, and she was sure this was the Dutchess of <hi>Norfolk.</hi> She telleth you, that at another time, I think it was in <hi>May</hi> last, that she did see Mr. <hi>Germaine</hi> go to the <hi>Mill-Bank;</hi> she was sure it was him, and she did think he would go there; and thereupon she doged him from that very place: She said, she had told one <hi>Harman,</hi> that she had seen the Dutchess of <hi>Nor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>folk; How,</hi> said he, <hi>If my Master had seen you he would have killed the Dutch-Woman.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Then cometh one <hi>Foster,</hi> the Coach-man, and saith, That about four Years since he hath carried the Dutchess of <hi>Norfolk,</hi> and Mr. <hi>Germaine,</hi> oft<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times: and one time (he driving) he looked back, he saw Mr. <hi>Germaine,</hi> and the Dutchess of <hi>Norfolk,</hi> lying with their heads together.</p>
               <p>Then cometh Mr. <hi>Bowtell,</hi> and he telleth you, That in <hi>April</hi> last he was at Mr. <hi>Germaine</hi>'s House, and he saw the Dutchess in Man's Apparel, and he said, there was an old Maid had a Hand-Basket with some Cloaths, and this was the Servant of the Dutchess of <hi>Norfolk.</hi> Now Gentlemen, these are Witnesses that prove to you the Issue in the time mentioned.</p>
               <p>Now Gentlemen, they have called some to dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>credit these Witnesses; they begin with <hi>Iane Wad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sworth,</hi>
                  <pb n="12" facs="tcp:103660:7"/>
they bring one <hi>Candy</hi> that should say, That she heard <hi>Iane Wadsworth</hi> say, that she thought at the first it was the Dutchess of <hi>Norfolk,</hi> but she was mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>staken.</p>
               <p>Then they call some more Witnesses, that is Mrs. <hi>Pennington,</hi> that was her Mistress twelve Years ago, and she saith, That she pretended to be sick a while after she had been with her, and so going away, she seeing her Cloaths tuck'd up, she seeing what was the matter she had some of her Linnen, she said she lived with her not above a Fortnight, and they parted; she said she was indigent and poor, and her Maid saith the same.</p>
               <p>And then they bring another Witness against one <hi>Foster,</hi> the Coach-man; telling him of what he had said against Mr. <hi>Germaine;</hi> he said he was got to be Drunk, and when a Man is Drunk, he will say any thing.</p>
               <p>Then, as to Mr. <hi>Bowtell,</hi> whereas he salth he saw the Dutchess in Man's Apparel at <hi>Germaine</hi>'s House, and the M<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">
                     <desc>•…</desc>
                  </gap>id was there, and the Maid co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>meth and saith, that she was not there; that she was ill, and her Leg was bro<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">
                     <desc>•…</desc>
                  </gap>k, rnd denieth that ever the Dutchess was there, or that she saw her in a Chair, or in Man's Apparel.</p>
               <p>Now for <hi>Ann Read,</hi> no Evidence at all against her Testimony, and she is very Positive of what was done in <hi>May</hi> last.</p>
               <p>They have called one Mr. <hi>Welborne,</hi> who saith that the Duke sent for him, and after some Dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>course spake to him about <hi>Bestow-Billing,</hi> and <hi>Castle Rising;</hi> and he saith the Duke sent to him to have the Dutchess to know, if she would comply with him, he did not question, but to prosecute a Bill of Divorce in the House of Lords with Effect.</p>
               <p>They tell you indeed, of <hi>Foster</hi> that <hi>Germain</hi> had turn'd him out of his Service, and that he should say he would be reveng'd of him; but he denyed that.</p>
               <p>And then the Dutchess Letter in 87. was read: I cannot see what Inference you can make of it, but that the Duke had no design of shewing any Unkindness, you have heard the Letter read, and you may make your In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ference, as you will.</p>
               <p>Then, as to Mrs. <hi>Wadsworth,</hi> they have brought some Persons to speak to her Repu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation; and they tell you, She is is an indu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>strious Woman, and of fair Conversation, and rented an House of Threescore Pounds a Year<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> And as to what they alleadged, that she was kept by the Parish; no such thing was: but her Husband being sick, and about going into the Country, the Church-Wardens helped him with about Sixteen Shillings. But she neve<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">

                  </gap> was in the Poors-Rates, or in the Poors Book.</p>
               <p>And then as to Mrs. <hi>Pennington,</hi> what sh<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">

                  </gap> why she did Live no longer with her, she saith<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> Her Mistress kept a disorderly House.</p>
