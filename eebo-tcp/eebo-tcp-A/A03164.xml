            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            <lg>
               <l>IT was an old man, which with his poore wife,</l>
               <l>in great diſtreſſe did fall:</l>
               <l>They were ſo feeble with age God wot</l>
               <l>they could not worke at all</l>
               <l>A gallant ſonne they had</l>
               <l>which liued wealthily</l>
               <l>To whom they went with full intent,</l>

               <l>Alack and alas for wo.</l>
               <l>¶ A hundred miles when they had gone</l>
               <l>with many a weary ſtep</l>
               <l>at length they ſaw their ſonnes faire houſe</l>
               <l>which made their harts to leape:</l>
               <l>They ſate them on the greene</l>
               <l>their ſhoes and hoſe to trim</l>
               <l>And put cleane bands about their necke</l>
               <l>gainſt they ſhould enter in. Alack &amp;c.</l>

               <l>now you are olde and Lame</l>

               <l>Héere are we come to thee our ſonne</l>
               <l>for ſuccour and reliefe. Alack, &amp;c.</l>
               <l>¶ This is thy father gentle ſonne</l>
               <l>and I thy louing mother</l>
               <l>That brought thee vp moſt tenderly,</l>
               <l>and lou'd thee aboue all other</l>
               <l>I bore thée in this wombe</l>
               <l>theſe breſtes did nouriſh thée</l>

               <l>The world is not now as when I was born</l>
               <l>all things are growne more deare:</l>
               <l>My charge of Children is not ſmal</l>
               <l>as plainely doth appeare</l>
               <l>The beſt that I can doe</l>
               <l>will hardly them maintaine:</l>
               <l>Therefore I ſay be packing away,</l>
               <l>and get you home againe. alack, &amp;c,</l>
               <l>The olde man with his hat in hand</l>
               <l>full many a leg did make.</l>
               <l>The woman wept and wrong her hands</l>
               <l>and prayd him for Chriſt his ſake:</l>
               <l>Not ſo to ſend them back,</l>
               <l>diſtreſſed and vndone</l>
               <l>But let vs lie in ſome barne here by</l>
               <l>quoth ſhe my louing ſonne Alack &amp;c,</l>
               <l>¶ By no meenes would he thereto conſent,</l>
               <l>but ſent them ſoone away,</l>
               <l>Nuoth he you know the perill of Lawe</l>
               <l>if long time here you ſtay:</l>
               <l>The ſtockes and whipping poaſt</l>
               <l>will fall vnto your ſhare</l>
               <l>Then take you heede and with all ſpéed</l>
               <l>to your country do repaire. Alack, &amp;c.</l>
               <l>¶ Away then went this woful olde man,</l>
               <l>full ſad in heart and minde</l>
               <l>With weeping teares his wife did lament</l>
               <l>their ſonne was ſo vnkinde.</l>
               <l>Thou wicked child quoth they</l>
               <l>for this thy cruell deede:</l>
               <l>The Lord ſend thee as little pittie,</l>
               <l>when thou doſt ſtand in neede. Alack &amp;c.</l>
               <l>¶ His children hearing his father ſet</l>
               <l>his parents thus at nought</l>
               <l>In ſhort time after to haue his lands</l>

               <l>in their great wretchednes Alack, &amp;c.</l>
               <l>¶ They murdered him in pittifull ſort</l>
               <l>they wayde not his intreates:</l>
               <l>The more he prayd impaſſionately</l>
               <l>the greater were his threates</l>
               <l>Speake not to vs quoth they,</l>

               <l>according to their minde</l>
               <l>They buried him in a ſtinking ditch</l>
               <l>where no man could him finde:</l>
               <l>But now behold and ſee</l>
