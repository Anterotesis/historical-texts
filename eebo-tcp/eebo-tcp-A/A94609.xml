            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            <p>THAT your poore Petitioners being fallen into great want and neceſſity through the great decay of Tra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding,
as it is generally conceived, occaſioned for want of due execution of Iuſtice upon incendiaries and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>linquents
upon this State, producing the manifold diſtractions and diſtempers that are now therein; and
having divers times petitioned for redreſſe thereof, and compoſing the differences in the ſame, the reliefe
and remedying the exceſſive grievances not onely by the Citizens of London, and Tradeſmen in and about the
Suburbs thereof, which have not yet been anſwered, not as wee conceive through the neglect or reiection of the
Honourable Houſe of Commous, but by the meere oppoſition of ſome Biſhops and Lords ſitting in the
Houſe of Peeres: And there having alſo beene ſeverall Petitions by your Petitioners delivered formerly into
the Lords Houſe, which they having received no ſatisfactory anſwere of as yet, info<gap reason="illegible" resp="#UOM" extent="1 letter">

this Honourable Houſe for anſwer to the ſame, in granting your Petitioners their iuſt deſires and requeſts,
which are:</p>
            <p>Firſt, that Biſhops, with their whole uſurped government, both Spirituall and Temporall, and all Offices
appertaining to the ſame government, wherein they have exerciſed and executed iniuſtice and oppreſſion o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver
the Children and Saints of God, the Kings faithfull and loyall Subiects; may be extinguiſhed and a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>boliſhed,
all ſuperfluous and ſuperſtitious Ceremonies now ioyned to the ſervice of Almighty God, and
introduced into the exerciſe of true Religion, and war<gap reason="illegible" resp="#UOM" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>anted by the ſame, but repugnant to the purity and
ſincerity thereof, whoſe beginning is from Satan and that ſonne of Perdition, who is the childe of that
bottomleſſe pit, Antichriſt and his followers and Diſciples, children of diſobedience to God and their law<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full
Princes, the principall ſteppes leading to idolatry; and finally to Apoſtaſie from God and his true Religi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on,
the onely meanes and inſtrument to nouriſh vice and impurity in the Clergie and Miniſtery in their lives and
converſations; the mixing with the true Doctrine of Chriſt and his Apoſtles, the Traditions and Inventions of
man, thereby corrupting the pure and ſincere teaching of the Word of God, ſeducing and blinding the people
and Diſciples of Chriſt in their Religion; may bee annihilated and utterly aboliſhed in the Church of England,
and other his Maieſties Dominions under his Royall ſubiection.</p>
            <p>Secondly, that faithfull, laborious and learned Teachers may be placed in the Miniſtery, whereby the people
of God may rightly be taught and inſtructed in the wayes of Godlineſſe and Holineſſe, and ſuch as are ſcandalous
and vicious in their lives and converſations, whoſe examples doth more encreaſe the Kingdome of Darkneſſe,
whoſe originall is the Divell, by teaching men to live in uncleanneſſe and unholineſſe, then their Doctrines win
ſoules to God, or ſuch as are unſound and corrupt in their doctrines, may be removed from the place of the Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſtery.</p>
            <p>Thirdly, that Popiſh Lords, and all ſuch in the Houſe of Peers may be ſequeſtred the Houſe, that are any
wayes diſſaffected to the Proteſtant Religion, who are generally conceived to bee the hinderers and oppoſers of
compoſing the differences in the State, of bringing evill doers to triall, and deſerved puniſhment, and of ſetling
true Religion in this Kingdome.</p>
            <p>Fourthly, that the diſtreſſed eſtate in <hi>Ireland</hi> may be in time remembred before it be too late, and that ſpee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy
aide and aſſiſtance of men money and ammunition may be thither tranſported for their Releefe.</p>
            <p>Fiftly, that this Kingdome may be put into a preſent poſture of Warre, for the ſafety and defence there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of.</p>
            <p>Sixtly, that all incendiaries and delinquents, may without any further delay, be brought to tryall, and puniſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment,
as they ſhall be found to deſerve the protraction of time therein, hath been the onely cauſe of the decay of
trading, as it is conceived, and of all the miſeries and troubles this Kingdome now groanes under.</p>
            <p>And your humble and diſtreſſed Petitioners, with bended knees, and upright hearts, ſhall
daily pray for the continuance and proſperous ſucceſſe of this High and Honourable
Court of Parliament, to ſettle and reforme all things that are amiſſe in this Common-Wealth,
both in Church and State, and all other his Maieſties Kingdomes, to which they
ſhall ever ſay, <hi>Amen.</hi>
