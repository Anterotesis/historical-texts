            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            <head>THE FIRST VISION OF THE <hi>Algouazil</hi> (or Catchpole) possest.</head>
            <p>I Was going t' other day to hear Mass at a Convent in this Town, but the door it seems was shut, and a world of people pressing and begging to get in; I ask'd, What was the matter? They told me that there was a <hi>Demoniac</hi> to be <hi>exor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cised</hi> (or dispossest): Whereupon, I thrust into the Crowd for company, to see the Ceremony; but to little pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pose: for after I had half smothered my self in the throng, I was e'en glad to get out again, and bethink my self of my Lodging. Upon my way homeward, at the streets end, it was my fortune to meet a familiar friend of mine of the same Convent; who told me over again what I had heard before, and taking notice of my curiosity, bad me
<pb n="2" facs="tcp:40642:6"/>
follow him; which I did, and with his <hi>Passe-par-tout</hi> he brought me through a little back-door into the Church, and so into the Vestry, where we saw a wretched kind of a dog-look'd fellow, with a Tippet about his neck, as ill ordered as you'd wish; his Cloaths all in tatters, his hands bound behind him, roaring and tearing after a most hide<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous manner. Bless me, quoth I, (cros<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sing my self) what spectacle have we here? This (said the good Father who was to do the Feat) is a man that's pos<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sest with an <hi>Evil-spirit.</hi> That's a damn'd lye (with respect of the Company, cryed the Devil that tormented him) for this is not a <hi>man</hi> possest with a <hi>De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vil,</hi> but a <hi>Devil</hi> possest with a <hi>man</hi>; and therefore you should do well to have a care what you say, for both by the Question and Answer it is most evi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent, that you are but a Company of Sots. You are to understand that we <hi>Devils</hi> never enter into the body of a <hi>Catchpole,</hi> but by force, and in spight of our hearts; and therefore to speak pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perly, you are to say, This is a <hi>Devil Catchpol'd,</hi> and not a <hi>Catchpole bedevil'd.</hi>
               <pb n="3" facs="tcp:40642:6"/>
To say the truth, you <hi>men</hi> can deal better with us <hi>Devils,</hi> than with the <hi>Catchpoles,</hi> for <hi>we</hi> fly from the Cross, whereas <hi>They</hi> make use of it for a Cloak for their villany.</p>
            <p>There is somewhat a better agree<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, I must confess, between our Offi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces: If <hi>we</hi> draw men into <hi>Iudgment</hi> and <hi>Condemnation,</hi> so do the <hi>Catchpoles; we</hi> pray for an encrease of <hi>wickedness</hi> in the world, so do <hi>they</hi>; nay and more zealously than <hi>we,</hi> for it is their <hi>live<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lihood,</hi> and <hi>we</hi> do it only for <hi>company</hi>: And in this, the <hi>Catchpoles</hi> are worse than the <hi>Devils, they</hi> prey upon their own Kind, and worry one another; for <hi>our</hi> parts we are <hi>Angels</hi> still, though <hi>black ones,</hi> and were turn'd into <hi>Devils</hi> only for aspiring into an equality with our Maker: whereas <hi>the very corrupti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of mankind is the generation of a Catchpole</hi>; so that, my good Father, your labour is but lost in plying this Wretch with Reliques; for you may as soon redeem any thing from Hell as (be it never so holy, if he once seizes it) out of his Clutches. In fine, your <hi>Algou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>
                  <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>zils</hi> (or <hi>Catchpoles</hi>) and your <hi>Devils</hi> are
<pb n="4" facs="tcp:40642:7"/>
both of an Order, only your <hi>Catch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pole Devils</hi> wear <hi>Shoes</hi> and <hi>Stockings,</hi> and <hi>we</hi> go <hi>barefoot</hi> after the Fashion of this reverend Father, and (to deal plainly) have a very hard time on't.</p>
            <p>I was not a little surprized to find the <hi>Devil</hi> so great a Sophister, but all this notwithstanding, the holy man went on with his <hi>Exorcism,</hi> and to stop the Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rits mouth, washt his face with a little <hi>Holy Water,</hi> which made the <hi>Demoniac</hi> ten times madder than before, and set him a yelping so horridly, that it deaf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned the company, and made the very ground under us to tremble. And now, says he, you may, perchance, imagine this extravagance to be the effect of your <hi>Holy Water</hi>; but let me tell you, that meer <hi>Water</hi> it self would have done the same thing; for your <hi>Catchpole</hi> hates nothing in this world like <hi>Water,</hi> [espe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cially that of a <hi>Grays-Inne Pump.</hi>] But to conclude, They are so reprobated a sort of <hi>Christians,</hi> that they have quit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted even the very name of <hi>Misins,</hi> by which they were formerly known, for that of <hi>Algouazils</hi>; the latter being of <hi>Pagan extraction,</hi> and made suitable to their manners.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="5" facs="tcp:40642:7"/>Come, come, says the Father, there is no ear, nor credit to be given to this Villain, set but his tongue at liberty, and you shall have him fall foul upon the Government, and the Ministers of Justice, for keeping the World in Or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der and suppressing wickedness, because it spoils his market. No more chopping of Logick, good Mr. <hi>Conjurer,</hi> says the <hi>Devil,</hi> for there's more in't than you are aware of; but if you'l do a poor <hi>Devil</hi> a good office, give me my dispatch out of this accursed <hi>Algouazil</hi>; for I am a <hi>Devil,</hi> you must know, of <hi>Reputation</hi> and <hi>Quality,</hi> and shall never be able to endure the gibes and affronts will be put upon me at my return to Hell, for hav<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing kept this Rascal company. All in good time, said the <hi>Father,</hi> thou shalt have thy discharge, but in pity to this miserable Creature, and not for thy own sake. But tell me now, what makes thee torment him thus? Nothing in the world, quoth the <hi>Devil,</hi> but a con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>test betwixt him and me, which was the <hi>greater Devil</hi> of the <hi>two.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>The Conjurer did not at all relish these wild and malicious replies; but <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

me the Dialogue was extream pleasant, especially being by this time a little familiariz'd with the <hi>Devil.</hi> Upon which confidence my <hi>Good Father,</hi> said I, here are none but Friends; and I may speak to you as my Confessour, and the Confident of all the secrets of my soul; I have a great mind with your leave, to ask the <hi>Devil</hi> a few Questions, and who knows but a man may be the better for his Answers, though per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chance contrary to his intention! keep him only in the interim from torment<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the poor creature. The <hi>Conjurer</hi> granted my request, and the <hi>Spirit</hi> went on with his babble: Well, says he smiling, the <hi>Devil</hi> shall never want a Friend at Court, so long as there's a <hi>Poet</hi> within the Walls. And indeed the Poets do us many a good turn, both by Pimping and otherwise; but if you, said he, should not be kind to us, (looking upon me) you'l bethought very ungrate<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful, considering the honour of your en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tertainment now in Hell. I ask't him then what store of Poets they had? whole swarms, says the <hi>Devil</hi>; so many, that we have been forc'd to make more
<pb n="7" facs="tcp:40642:8"/>
room for them: Nor is there any thing in nature so pleasant as a Poet in the first year of his probation; he comes ye laden forsooth with Letters of Recom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mendation to our Superiours, and en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quires very gravely for <hi>Charon, Cerbe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rus, Rhadamanthus, AEacus, Minos.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Well said I, but what's their punish<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment (for I began now to make the <hi>Poets</hi> case my own) Their punishments, quoth the <hi>Devil,</hi> are many, and suited to the Trade they drive. Some are condemn'd to hear other mens works: (and this is the plague of the <hi>Fidlers</hi> too) We have others that are in for a thousand year, and yet still poring up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on some old Stanzas they have made of Jealousie. Some again are beating their fore-heads with the palms of their hands, and even boring their very Noses with hot Irons, in rage that they can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not come to a resolution, whether they shall say <hi>Face</hi> or <hi>Visage</hi>; whether they shall write <hi>Iayl</hi> or <hi>Gaol</hi>; whether <hi>Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny</hi> or <hi>Cunny,</hi> because it comes from <hi>Cu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niculus, a Rabbet.</hi> Others are biting their Nails to the quick, and at their Wits end for a Rime to <hi>Chimney</hi>; and
<pb n="8" facs="tcp:40642:9"/>
dozing up and down in a brown study, till they drop into some hole at last, and give us trouble enough to get them out again. But they that suffer the most, and fare the worst, are your Comick Poets, for whoring so many Queens and Princesses upon the stage, and coupling Ladies of Honour with Lacquies, and Noblemen with common Strumpets, in the winding up of their Plays; and for giving the Bastonado to <hi>Alexander</hi> and <hi>Iulius Caesar</hi> in their Interludes and Far<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces. Now be it known to you, that we do not lodge these with other <hi>Poets,</hi> but with <hi>Petty-foggers</hi> and <hi>Attournies,</hi> as common dealers in the mystery of Shifting, Shuffling, Forging, and Cheat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing: And now for the discipline of Hell, you are to understand we have incom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parable <hi>Harbingers</hi> and <hi>Quarter-masters</hi>; insomuch that let them come in whole <hi>Caravans,</hi> as it hapn'd t' other day, every man is in his quarter before you can say what's this.</p>
            <p>There came to us several Trades<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men; the first of them a Poor Rogue that made profession of <hi>drawing the long Bow</hi>; and him we were about to
<pb n="9" facs="tcp:40642:9"/>
put among the Armorers, but one of the company moved and carried it, that since he was so good at draughts, he might be sent to the <hi>Clerks</hi> and <hi>Scriv<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ners</hi>; a sort of people that will fit you with draughts good and bad, of all sorts and sizes, and to all purposes. Ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther called himself a <hi>Cutter,</hi> we ask'd him whether in <hi>Wood</hi> or <hi>Stone</hi>? Nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther said he, but in <hi>Cloth</hi> and <hi>Stuffe: (Anglice</hi> a <hi>Taylor)</hi> and him we turn'd over to those that were in for Detra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction and Calumny, and for cutting large Thongs out of other mens Lea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther. There was a <hi>Blind fellow</hi> would fain have been among the <hi>Poets,</hi> but (for likeness sake) we quartered him among the <hi>Lovers.</hi> After him, came a <hi>Sexton,</hi> or (as he styl'd himself) a <hi>Bu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ryer</hi> of <hi>the Dead</hi>; and then a <hi>Cook</hi> that was troubled in Conscience for putting off <hi>Catts</hi> for <hi>Hares:</hi> These were dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>patch'd away to the <hi>Pastry-men.</hi> A matter of half a dozen <hi>Crack-brain'd Fools</hi> we disposed of among the <hi>Astrolo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gers</hi> and <hi>Alchymists.</hi> In the number, there was one notorious <hi>Murtherer,</hi> and him we pack'd away to the Gentlemen

of the Faculty, the <hi>Physitians.</hi> The <hi>Broken Merchants</hi> we kennel'd with <hi>Iu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>das</hi> for making ill bargains. <hi>Corrupt Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nisters</hi> and <hi>Magistrates,</hi> with the <hi>Thief</hi> on the left hand. The <hi>Embroylers</hi> of <hi>Affairs,</hi> and the <hi>Water-bearers</hi> take up with the <hi>Vintners</hi>; and the <hi>Brokers</hi> with the <hi>Iews.</hi> Upon the whole matter the policy of Hell is admirable, where eve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry man has his place according to his condition.</p>
            <p>As I remember (said I) you were speaking e'en now concerning <hi>Lovers.</hi> Pray tell me, have you many of them in your Dominions? I ask, because I am my self a little subject to the itch of <hi>Love,</hi> as well as <hi>Poetry. Love</hi> (says the Devil) is like a great spot of Oyl, that diffuses it self every where, and conse<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quently Hell cannot but be sufficiently stockt with that sort of Vermine. But let me tell you now, we have several sorts of <hi>Lovers</hi>; some dote upon them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves; others upon their <hi>Pelf</hi>; these upon their own <hi>Discourses</hi>; those upon their own <hi>Actions</hi>; and once in an Age perchance, comes a fellow that dotes upon his <hi>own Wife</hi>; but this is very
<pb n="11" facs="tcp:40642:10"/>
rare, for the Jades commonly bring their Husbands to repentance, and then the Devil may throw his Cap at them. But above all, for sport (if there can be any in Hell) commend me to those <hi>Gawdy Monsieurs,</hi> who by the variety of Colours and Ribbands they wear (<hi>Favours</hi> as they call them) one would swear, were only dress'd up for a <hi>Sample,</hi> or kind of <hi>Inventory</hi> of all the <hi>Gew-Gaws</hi> that are to be had for love or money at the <hi>Mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cers.</hi> Others you shall have so over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>charged with <hi>Perrugue,</hi> that you'l hard<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly know the <hi>Head</hi> of a <hi>Cavalier,</hi> from the ordinary <hi>Block</hi> of a <hi>Tire-woman.</hi> And s<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

But, oh! the pleasant postures of the Maiden-Lover, when he is upon the practice of the <hi>Gentle-Leere,</hi> and embracing the Air for his Mistress!

            </p>
            <p>One story lower is the abode of <hi>con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tented Cuckolds</hi>; a nasty poisonous place, and strewed all over with the Horns of Rams and Bulls, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> Now these are so well read in Woman, and know their destiny so well before hand, that they never so much as trouble their heads for the matter. Ye come next to the <hi>Admirers</hi> of <hi>old Women</hi>; and these are wretches of so depraved an Appe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tite, that if they were not kept tyed up, and in Chains, they'd horse the very <hi>Devils themselves,</hi> and put <hi>Barrabbas</hi> to his Trumps, to defend his Buttocks: For the truth is, whatever you may think of a Devil, he passeth with them for a very <hi>Adonis,</hi> or a <hi>Narcissus.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>So much for your Curiosity; a word now for your Instruction. If you would make an interest in Hell, you must give over that Roguy way ye have got of abusing the <hi>Devils</hi> in your Shews, Pi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctures, and Emblems: One while for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sooth we are painted with <hi>Claws,</hi> or <hi>Ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lons,</hi>
               <pb n="13" facs="tcp:40642:11"/>
like <hi>Eagles,</hi> or <hi>Griffons.</hi> Another while we are drest up with <hi>Tails,</hi> like so many Hackney-Jades with their <hi>Fly-flaps</hi>: And now and then ye shall see a <hi>Devil</hi> with a <hi>Coxcomb.</hi> Now I will not deny, but some of us may indeed be very well taken for <hi>Hermites,</hi> and <hi>Phi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>losophers.</hi> Help us, if you can, in this particular, and you shall find one good turn paid with another. I was asking <hi>Michael Angelo</hi> here a while ago, why he drew the Devils in his Great Peice of the <hi>Last Iudgment,</hi> with so many <hi>Monkey Faces,</hi> and <hi>Iack-Pudding Postures.</hi> His answer was, that he follow'd his Fancy, without any Malice in the World, for as then, he had never seen any Devils; nor (indeed) did he believe that there were any; but he has now learn'd the contrary to his cost. There's another thing too we take extreamly ill, which is, that in your ordinary discourses, ye are out with your Purse presently to every Rascal, and calling of him <hi>Devil.</hi> As for Example. Do you see how this <hi>Devil</hi> of a <hi>Taylor</hi> has spoil'd my Suit? how the <hi>Devil</hi> has made me wait? how this <hi>Devil</hi> has couzen'd me. <hi>&amp;c.</hi> whic
<pb n="14" facs="tcp:40642:12"/>
is very ill done, and no small disparage<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment to our Quality, to be rank'd with <hi>Taylors:</hi> A company of Slaves, that serve us in Hell only for Brush-wood; and they are fain to beg hard to be ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitted at all: though I confess they have <hi>possession</hi> on their sides, and <hi>Cu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stom,</hi> which is <hi>another Law</hi>: Being in <hi>possession</hi> of Theft, and <hi>stoln goods</hi>; they make much more Conscience of keep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing your <hi>stuffs,</hi> then your <hi>Holidays,</hi> grumbling and domineering at every turn, if they have not the same respect with the Children of the Family. Ye have another trick too, of giving every thing to the Devil, that displeases ye, which we cannot but take very un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kindly. <hi>The Devil take thee,</hi> says one: A goodly present I warrant ye; but the <hi>Devil</hi> has something else to do, then to take and carry aw<gap reason="illegible: missing" extent="1 letter">

Another gives that whelp of <hi>Laquey</hi> to the <hi>De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vil</hi>; but the <hi>Devil</hi> will none of your <hi>Laqueys,</hi> he thanks ye for your love, for those Rogues are commonly worse than Devils, and to say the truth, they are

I give that <hi>Italian</hi> to the <hi>Devil,</hi> cryes a third; thank you for nothing: For ye shall have an <hi>Italian</hi> will <hi>chouse</hi> the <hi>Devil</hi> himself, and take him by the Nose like Mustard. Some again will be giving a <hi>Spaniard</hi> to the <hi>Devil</hi>; but he has been so cruel wherever he has got footing, that we had rather have his Room then his Company, and make a Present to the <hi>Grand-Signior</hi> of his <hi>Nutmegs.</hi>

And yet we are now e'en upon the point of discarding them, for they are so pragmatical, and ungrateful, there's no enduring of them. They are at this present in Consultation about an <hi>Impost</hi> upon the <hi>High-way</hi> to <hi>Hell</hi>; and indeed payments run so high already, and are so likely to encrease too, that 'tis much fear'd in the end, we shall quite lose our Trading and Commerce. But if ever they come to put this in Execution, we shall be so bold, as to treat them next bout to the Tune of <hi>Fortune my Foe,</hi> &amp;c. and make them cool their Heels on the wrong side of the Door, which will be worse then <hi>Hell</hi> to them, for it leaves them no retreat, being expell'd <hi>Paradise,</hi> and <hi>Purgatory</hi> already. This Race of Vipers, said I, will never be quiet, till they tax the way to Heaven it self. Oh, quoth the <hi>Devil,</hi> that had been done long since, if they had found the Play worth the Candles: but they have had a Factor abroad now these half-score years, that's glad to wipe his nose on his sleeve still, for want of a Handkerchief. But these new im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>positions, upon what I pray ye do they

intend to levy them? For that (quoth the <hi>Devil</hi>) there's a Gentleman of the Trade at your Elbow can tell you all; pointing to my old Friend the Publican. This drew the Eyes of the whole Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pany upon him, and put him so damn'd<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly out of Countenance, that he pluck't down his Hat over his Face, clap't his tail between his Legs, and went his way; with which we were all of us well enough pleas'd, and then the <hi>De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vil</hi> went on. Well (said the <hi>Devil</hi> and laught) my Voucher is departed ye see; but I think I can say as much to this point as himself; The Impositions now to be set on foot, are upon <hi>bare<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neck'd Ladies, Patches, Mole-skins; Spa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nish-paper,</hi> and all the <hi>Mundus Mulie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bri<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

put up our Pipes, and you'l find <hi>Hell</hi> a very <hi>Desart.</hi> Well said I, and methinks I see nothing in all this, but what is very reasonable; for to what end serves it but to corrupt good manners, stir up ill Ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>petites, provoke and encourage all sorts of Debauchery, destroy all that is good and Honourable in humane Socie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty, and chalk out in effect the ready way to the Devil.</p>
            <p>But you said something e'en now of Magistrates, I hope (said I) there are no <hi>Iudges</hi> in Hell. You may as well ima<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gine (cry'd the spirit) that there are no <hi>Devils</hi> there; for let me tell you (Friend mine) your <hi>corrupt Iudges</hi> are the great <hi>Spawners</hi> that supply our Lake; for what are those Millions of <hi>Catchpoles, Proctors, Atturneys, Clerks, Barristers,</hi> that come sailing to us every day in <hi>Shoals,</hi> but the <hi>Fry</hi> of such <hi>Iudges!</hi> nay sometimes, in a lucky year, for <hi>cheating, forging,</hi> and <hi>forswear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing,</hi> we can hardly find Cask to put them in.</p>
            <p>From hence now (quoth I) would you infer, that there's no <hi>Iustice</hi> upon the face of the Earth. Very right (quoth

She presented her self in many places, and people askt her what she was? She

Moreover they take no thought for to morrow, but setting a just value on their hours, they are good Husbands of the present; considering that what is past, is as good as <hi>Dead,</hi> and what's to come <hi>Vncertain.</hi> But they say, <hi>when the Devil preaches, the world's neer an End.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>The divine Hand is in this (said the Holy Man that perform'd the <hi>Exor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cism</hi>) Thou art the Father of Lyes, and yet deliver'st truths, able to mollify
<pb n="25" facs="tcp:40642:17"/>
and convert a Heart of stone. But do not you mistake your selves, (quoth the Devil) to suppose that your Conversion is my Business; for I speak these Truths to aggravate your Guilt, and that you may not plead ignorance another day, when you shall be call'd to answer for your Transgressions. 'Tis true, most of you shed tears at parting, but 'tis the Apprehension of Death, and no true Repentance for your sins that works up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on you: For ye are all a pack of <hi>Hy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pocrites</hi>: Or if at any time you enter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain those Reflections, your trouble is, That your Body will not hold out; and then forsooth ye pretend to pick aquar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rel with the <hi>Sin</hi> it self. Thou art an <hi>Impostor</hi> (said the Religious) for there are many Righteous Souls, that draw their sorrow from another Fountain. But I perceive you have a mind to amuse us, and make us lose Time, and perchance your own hour is not yet come to quit the Body of this miserable Creature; however, I conjure thee in the name of the most High to leave tor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>menting him, and to hold thy Peace. The Devil obey'd; and the Good Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther

applying himself to us, My Masters (says he) though I am absolutely of Opinion that it is the <hi>Devil</hi> that has talkt to us all this while through the Organ of this unhappy wretch, yet he that well weighs what has bin said, may doubtless reap some benefit by the Discourse. Wherefore without considering whence it came; Remember, that <hi>Saul</hi> (al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>though a wicked Prince) Prophesied; and that Honey has been drawn out of the Mouth of a Lyon. Withdraw then, and I shall make it my Prayer (as 'tis my hope) that this sad and prodigious spectacle may lead you to a true sight of your Errours, and in the end, to amendment of Life.</p>

            <p>MEan Souls do naturally breed sad Thoughts, and in Soli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tude, they gather together in Troops to assault the Unfortunate; which is the Tryal (according to my Observation) wherein the Coward does most betray himself; and yet cannot I for my life, when I am alone, avoid those Accidents and Surprizes in my self, which I condemn in others. I have sometime, upon Reading the Grave and Severe <hi>Lucretius,</hi> been seized with a strange Damp; whether from the strik<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of his Counsels upon my Passions, or some tacite reflection of shame upon my self, I know not. However, to render this Confession of my weakness the more excusable, I'l begin my Dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>course

with somewhat out of that ele<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gant and excellent Poet;

            <p>This passage brought into my mind, the words of <hi>Iob.</hi> Cap. 14. and I was carried on from one Meditation to another, till at length, I fell fast asleep over my Book, which I ascribed rather to a favourable providence, then to my natural Disposition. So soon as my Soul felt her self at Liberty, she gave
<pb n="29" facs="tcp:40642:19"/>
me the entertainment of this following Comedy, my Phansy supplying both the Stage and the Company.</p>
            <p>In the first Scene, enter'd a Troop of <hi>Physicians,</hi> upon their Mules, with deep Foot-cloths; marching in no very good Order, sometime fast, sometime slow, and to say the Truth, most commonly in a huddle. They were all wrinkled and wither'd about the Eyes; I sup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pose with casting so many sowre looks upon the Piss-pots and Close-stools of their Patients: bearded like Goats; and their Faces so overgrown with Hair, that their Fingers could hardly find the way to their Mouths. In their left hand they held their Reins, and their Gloves roul'd up together; and in the right, a Staffe <hi>à la mode,</hi> which they carryed ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther for Countenance, then Correction; (for they understood no other Manege than the Heel) and all along, Head and Body went too, like a Baker upon his Panniers. Divers of them I observ'd, had huge Gold Rings upon their Fing<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers, and set with Stones of so large a size, that they could hardly feel a Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tients Pulse, without minding him of
<pb n="30" facs="tcp:40642:20"/>
his Monument. There were more tha<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

               </gap> a good many of them, and a world of Puny Practisers at their heels, that came out <hi>Graduates,</hi> by conversing ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther with the <hi>Mules</hi> than the <hi>Doctors</hi>: Well! said I to my self; if there goes no more than This to the making a <hi>Physitian,</hi> it is no marvel we pay so dear for their Experience.</p>
            <p>After These, follow'd a long Train of <hi>Mountebank Apothecaries</hi> laden with <hi>Pestles,</hi> and <hi>Mortars, Suppositories, Spa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tulas, Glister-Pipes</hi> and <hi>Siringes,</hi> ready charg'd, and as mortal as Gun-shot, and several <hi>Titled Boxes</hi> with <hi>R<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

<pb n="32" facs="tcp:40642:21"/>
have the old Proverb at their fingers ends, <hi>He that knows thee will never buy thee</hi>; and therefore every thing must be made a Mystery, to hold their Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tients in ignorance, and keep up the Price of the Market. And were not the very names of their Medicines suf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficient to fright away any Distemper, 'tis to be fear'd the Remedy would prove worse than the Disease. Can any pain in Nature, think ye, have the confidence to look a <hi>Physitian</hi> in the face, that comes arm'd with a Drug made of <hi>Man's Grease</hi>? though dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guis'd under the name of <hi>Mummy,</hi> to take off the Horrour and Disgust of it: Or to stay for a dressing with Dr. <hi>Wha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chums Plaster,</hi> that shall fetch up a man's leg to the size of a Mill-post? When I saw these people Herded with the <hi>Phy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sitians,</hi> methought the old sluttish Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verb, that says, <hi>There is a great distance between the Pulse and the Arse,</hi> was much to blame for making such a difference in their Dignities, for I find none at all; but the <hi>Physitian</hi> skips in a trice from the <hi>Pulse</hi> to the <hi>Stool</hi> and <hi>Vrinals,</hi> ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to the Doctrine of <hi>Galen,</hi> who
<pb n="33" facs="tcp:40642:21"/>
sends all his Disciples to those unsavou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry Oracles: from whose hands the De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vil himself, if he were sick, would not receive so much as a Glister. Oh! these cursed and lawless Arbitrators and Disposers of our Lives! that with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out either Conscience or Religion, di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vide our Souls and Bodies, by their damn'd poysonous <hi>Potions, Scarifica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions, Incisions, Excessive Bleedings,</hi> &amp;c. which are but the several wayes of exe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cuting their Tyranny and Injustice up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on us.</p>
            <p>In the tail of These, came the <hi>Surge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons,</hi> laden with <hi>Pincers, Cranes-bills, Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>theters, Desquamatories, Dilaters, Scis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sers, Saws</hi>; and with them, so horrid an outcry, of <hi>Cut, Tear, Open, Saw, Flay, Burn,</hi> that my Bones were ready to creep one into another for fear of an Operation.</p>
            <p>The next that came in, I should have taken by their <hi>Min,</hi> for <hi>Devils</hi> disguised, if I had not spyed their Chains of Rot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten Teeth, which put me in some hope they might be <hi>Tooth-drawers,</hi> and so they prov'd; which is yet one of the lewdest Trades in the world; for they
<pb n="34" facs="tcp:40642:22"/>
are good for nothing but to depopu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>late our Mouths, and make us old before our time. Let a man but yawn, and ye shall have one of these Rogues examin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing his <hi>Grinders,</hi> and there's not a sound Tooth in your head, but he had rather see't at his Girdle, than in the place of its nativity: Nay, rather than fail, hee'l pick a quarrel with your <hi>Gums.</hi> But that which puts me out of all pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tience, is to see these Scoundrels ask twice as much for drawing an <hi>old Tooth</hi> as would have bought ye a <hi>new One.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Certainly (said I to my self) we are now past the worst, unless the Devil himself come next: And in that instant I heard the Brushing of <hi>Guy<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>ars,</hi> and the Ratling of <hi>Citterns,</hi> Raking over certain <hi>Passacailles</hi> and <hi>Sarabands.</hi> These are a Kennel of <hi>Barbers</hi> thought I, or I'l be hang'd; and any man that had ever seen a Barber's shop might have told you as much without a Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jurer, both by the Musick, &amp; by the very Instruments, which are as proper a part of a <hi>Barbers Furniture,</hi> as his <hi>Comb-Cases</hi> and <hi>Wash-balls.</hi> It was to me a pleasant entertainment, to see them
<pb n="35" facs="tcp:40642:22"/>
lathering of <hi>Asses heads,</hi> of all sorts and sizes, and their Customers all the while winking and sputtering over their Ba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sons.</p>
            <p>Presently after these, appear'd a Consort of <hi>loud</hi> and <hi>tedious Talkers,</hi> that tired and deafen'd the Company with their <hi>shrill,</hi> and <hi>restless Gaggle</hi>: but as one told me, these were of several sorts. Some they call'd <hi>Swimmers</hi> from the motion of their Arms in all their Dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>courses, which was just as if they had been <hi>Padling.</hi> Others they called <hi>Apes,</hi> (and we <hi>Mimicks</hi>) these were perpetu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally making of <hi>Mopps,</hi> and <hi>Mowes,</hi> and a thousand Antick Ridiculous Gestures, in derision and imitation of Others. In the third place, were <hi>Make-Bates,</hi> and <hi>Sowers of Dissention,</hi> and these were still Rolling their Eyes (like a <hi>Bartlemey-Puppet,</hi> without so much as moving the Head) and leering over their Shoulders, to surprize people at unawares in their Familiarities, and Privacies, and ga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther matter for <hi>Calumny</hi> and <hi>Detraction.</hi> The <hi>Lyers</hi> follow'd next; and these seem'd to be a jolly contented sort of People, well Fed, and well Clothed;
<pb n="36" facs="tcp:40642:23"/>
and having nothing else to trust to, me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thought it was a strange Trade to live upon. I need not tell you, that they are never without a full Audience, since <hi>all Fools and Impertinents are of their Congregation.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>After these, came a Company of <hi>Medlers</hi>; a Pragmatical Insolent Ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neration of men that will have an Oar in every Boat, and are indeed the Bane of honest Conversation, and the Trou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>blers of all Companies and Affairs: The most Prostitute of all Flatterers; and only devoted to their own Profit. I thought this had been the last Scene, because no more came upon the Stage for a good while; and indeed I won<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der'd that they came so late themselves, but one of the <hi>Bablers</hi> told me (unaskt) that this kind of Serpent carrying his Venome in his tayl, it seem'd reasona<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble, that being the most Poysonous of the whole Gang, they should bring up the Rear.</p>
            <p>I began then to take into thought, what might be the meaning of this <hi>Oglio</hi> of People of several Conditions and Hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mours, met together; but I was quickly
<pb n="37" facs="tcp:40642:23"/>
diverted from that Consideration, by the Apparition of a Creature which lookt as if 'twere of the Feminine Gen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der. It was a Person, of a thin and slender <hi>make</hi>; laden with <hi>Crowns, Gar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lands, Scepters, Scythes, Sheep-hooks, Pattins, Hob-nail'd-shooes, Tiaras, Straw-hats, Miters, Mounmoth Caps, Embroideries, Skins, Silk, Wool, Gold, Lead, Diamonds, Shells, Pearl,</hi> and <hi>Pebles</hi>: She was drest up in all the Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lours of the Rainbow; she had one eye shut, the other open; young on the one side, and old o' the other. I thought at first, she had been a great way off, when indeed she was very neer me, and when I took her to be at my Chamber-door, she was at my Beds head. How to unridle this mystery I knew not; nor was it possible for me to make out the meaning of an Equi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>page so extravagant, and so fantasti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cally put together. It gave me no affright however, but on the contrary I could not forbear laughing, for it came just then into my mind that I had for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>merly seen in <hi>Italy</hi> a <hi>Farce,</hi> where the <hi>Mimick,</hi> pretending to come from the
<pb n="38" facs="tcp:40642:24"/>
other world, was just thus Accoutred, and never was any thing more Nonsen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sically pleasant. I held as long as I could, and at last, I askt what she was? she answer'd me, I am <hi>Death. Death</hi>! (the very word brought my Heart into my Mouth) and I beseech you Madam, quoth I (with great Humility and Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>spect) whither is your Honour a going? No further (said she) for now I have found you, I am at my Journey's End. Alas, Alas! and must I Dye then (said I) No, no, (quoth <hi>Death</hi>) but I'l take thee Quick along with me: For since so many of the <hi>Dead</hi> have been to visit the <hi>Living,</hi> It is but equal for once, that one of the <hi>Living</hi> should Return a Visit to the <hi>Dead.</hi> Get up then and come along; and never hang an Arse for the matter: for what you will not do wil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lingly, you shall do in spight of your Teeth. This put me in a Cold Fit; but without more delay up I started, and desired leave only to put on my Breech<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>es. No, no, (said she) no matter for Clothes, no body wears them upon this Road; wherefore come away, naked as you are, and you'l Travel the better.
<pb n="39" facs="tcp:40642:24"/>
So up I got, without a word more and follow'd her; in such a Terrour, and Amazement, that I was but in an ill Condition to take a strict account of my Passage; yet I remember, that up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on the way, I told her; Madam, under Correction, you are no more like the <hi>Deaths</hi> that I have seen, then <hi>an Apple's like an Oyster.</hi> Our <hi>Death</hi> is pictur'd with a <hi>Scyth</hi> in her hand; and a <hi>Carkass</hi> of bones, as clean, as if the Crows had pick'd it: Yes, yes (said she) turning short upon me, I know that very well: but in the mean time your Designers, and Painters, are but a Company of Buzzards. The <hi>Bones</hi> you talk of, are the Dead, or otherwise <hi>the miserable Remainders of the Living</hi>; but let me tell you, that you your selves are your own <hi>Death,</hi> and that which you call <hi>Death, is but the Period of your Life, as the first moment of your Birth, is the be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginning of your Death:</hi> And effectually, ye <hi>Dye Living,</hi> and your <hi>Bones</hi> are no more then what <hi>Death</hi> has left, and committed to the Grave. If this were rightly understood, every man would find a <hi>Memento Mori,</hi> or a <hi>Death's Head</hi>
               <pb n="40" facs="tcp:40642:25"/>
in his own Looking-glass; and consi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der every house with a Family in't, but as a Sepulchre fill'd with Dead Bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dies; a Truth which you little dream of, though within your daily View and Experience. Can you imagine a <hi>Death</hi> elsewhere, and not in your selves? Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve't y' are in a shameful mistake; for you your selves are <hi>Skeletons</hi> before ye are aware.</p>
            <p>But Madam, under Favour, what may all these People be that keep your Ladish<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

               <g ref="char:punc">▪</g> are neerer your Person, and more in your Good Graces, than the <hi>Physicians</hi>? Why (sayes she) there are more People <hi>Talk'd</hi> to Death and dispatcht by <hi>Bablers,</hi> then by all the Pestilential Diseases in the World. And then your <hi>Make-bates,</hi> and <hi>Medlers</hi> kill more then your <hi>Physicians,</hi> though (to give the Gentlemen of the Faculty their due) they labour night and day for the enlargement of our Em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pire.

about any other sort of Reputa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion.</p>
            <p>The Entertainment of these Lectures, and discourses made the way seem short and Pleasant, and we were just now en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tring into a Place, betwixt Light, and Dark; and of Horrour enough, if <hi>Death</hi> and I had not by this time been very well acquainted. Upon one side of the Passage, I saw <hi>three moving Figures; Arm'd,</hi> and of <hi>Humane shape</hi>; and so alike, that I could not say which was which. Just Opposite, on the other side, a Hideous <hi>Monster,</hi> and these <hi>Three</hi> to <hi>One,</hi> and <hi>One</hi> to <hi>Three,</hi> in a Fierce, and Obstinate <hi>Combate.</hi> Here <hi>Death</hi> made a stop, and facing about, askt me, if I knew these People. Alas! No (quoth I) Heaven be praised, I do not, and I shall put it in my Litany that I never may. Now to see thy Ignorance, cry'd <hi>Death</hi>; These are thy old Acquain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance, and thou hast hardly kept any other Company since thou wert born. <hi>Those Three</hi> are, the <hi>World,</hi> the <hi>Flesh,</hi> and the <hi>Devil</hi>; the Capital Enemies of thy Soul: and they are so like one ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, as well in Quality, as Appearance,
<pb n="43" facs="tcp:40642:26"/>
that Effectually, whoever has One, has All. The Proud, and Ambitious man thinks he has got the <hi>World,</hi> but it proves the <hi>Devil.</hi> The <hi>Lecher,</hi> and the <hi>Epicure,</hi> perswade themselves that they have gotten the <hi>Flesh,</hi> and that's the <hi>Devil</hi> too; and in fine, thus it fares with all other kinds of Extravagants. But what's He there, said I, that ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pears in so many several shapes? and fights against the other three? That (quoth <hi>Death</hi>) is the <hi>Devil</hi> of <hi>Money,</hi> who maintains that <hi>He</hi> himself <hi>Alone</hi> is Equivalent to them <hi>Three,</hi> and that wherever <hi>He</hi> comes, there's no need of <hi>Them.</hi> Against the <hi>World,</hi> He argues from their own Confession, and Expe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rience: for it passes for an Oracle; that <hi>There's no World but Money; He that's out of Money, 's out of the World. Take away a man's Money, and take away his Life. Money answers All things.</hi> Against the <hi>second</hi> Enemy, he pleads that <hi>Money</hi> is the <hi>Flesh</hi> too: witness the <hi>Girles</hi> and the <hi>Ganimedes</hi> it procures, and main<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tains. And against the <hi>Third,</hi> He urges that there's nothing to be done with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out this <hi>Devil</hi> of <hi>Money. Love does
<pb n="44" facs="tcp:40642:27"/>
much but Money does All: And Money will make the Pot boyl, though the Devil piss in the Fire.</hi> So that for ought I see, (quoth I) <hi>the Devil of Money has the better end of the staffe.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>After this, advancing a little further, I saw on One hand, <hi>Iudgment; and Hell,</hi> on the other (for so <hi>Death</hi> called them) Upon the sight of <hi>Hell,</hi> making a stop, to take a stricter Survey of it, <hi>Death</hi> askt me, what it was I look't at? I told her, it was <hi>Hell</hi>; and I was the more intent upon it, because I thought I had seen it, somewhere else before. She question'd me, where? I told her, that I had seen it in the <hi>Corruption</hi> and <hi>Avarice</hi> of <hi>Wick<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed Magistrates</hi>; In the <hi>Pride</hi> and <hi>Haugh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiness of Grandees</hi>; In the <hi>Appetites</hi> of the <hi>Voluptuous</hi>; In the <hi>lewd Designs</hi> of <hi>Ruine,</hi> and <hi>Revenge</hi>; In the <hi>Souls</hi> of <hi>Op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pressours</hi>; and in the <hi>Vanity</hi> of divers <hi>Princes.</hi> But he that would see it whole, and Entire, in one subject, must go to the <hi>Hypocrite</hi> who <hi>is a kind of a Religi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous Broker, and puts out at five and forty per Cent. the very Sacraments, and ten Commandments.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>I am very glad too (said I) that I
<pb n="45" facs="tcp:40642:27"/>
have seen <hi>Iudgment</hi> as I find it here, in it's Purity; for That which we call <hi>Iudgment</hi> in the World, is a meer Mock<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ery: If it were like This, men would live otherwise than they do. To con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clude; if it be expected that <hi>our Iudges</hi> should govern Themselves and Us by <hi>This Iudgment,</hi> the world's in an ill Case; for there's but little of't there. And to deal plainly, as matters are, I have no great maw to go home again: for 't is better being with the <hi>Dead,</hi> where there's <hi>Iustice,</hi> then with the <hi>Li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving,</hi> where there's <hi>None.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Our next step was into a fair and spa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cious <hi>Plain,</hi> encompass'd with a huge wall, where he that's once in, must never look to come out again. Stop here (quoth <hi>Death</hi>) for we are now come to my <hi>Iudgment-Seat,</hi> and here it is that I give <hi>Audience.</hi> The <hi>Walls</hi> were hung with <hi>Sighs</hi> and <hi>Grones, Ill-News, Fears, Doubts,</hi> and <hi>Surprizes. Tears</hi> did not there avail, either the <hi>Lover</hi> or the <hi>Beg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gar</hi>; but <hi>Grief</hi> and <hi>Care</hi> were without both <hi>Measure</hi> and <hi>Comfort</hi>; and serv'd as <hi>Vermine,</hi> to gnaw the Hearts of <hi>Em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perours,</hi> and <hi>Princes,</hi> feeding upon the
<pb n="46" facs="tcp:40642:28"/>
Insolent, and Ambitious; as their pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per Nourishment. I saw <hi>Envy</hi> there drest up in a <hi>Widdow's Vail,</hi> and the very Picture of the <hi>Governant</hi> of one of your Noblemen's Houses. She kept a Continual <hi>Fast</hi> as to the <hi>Shambles, Prey<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing</hi> only upon <hi>her self</hi>; and could not but be a very <hi>slender Gentlewoman,</hi> up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on so <hi>spare</hi> a <hi>Diet.</hi> Nothing came a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miss to her <hi>Teeth (Good</hi> or <hi>Bad</hi>) which made the whole set of them <hi>Yellow</hi> and <hi>Rotten,</hi> and the reason was, that though she <hi>bit,</hi> and set her <hi>mark</hi> upon the <hi>Good,</hi> and the <hi>Sound,</hi> she could never <hi>swallow</hi> it. Under her, sate <hi>Discord</hi>; the Legi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>timate Issue of her own Bowels. She had formerly convers'd much with <hi>married people,</hi> but finding no need of her there, away she went to <hi>Colleges</hi> and <hi>Corporations,</hi> where it seems they had more already than they knew what to do withall: and then she betook her self to <hi>Courts,</hi> and <hi>Palaces,</hi> and Officia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted there, as the <hi>Devil's Lieutenant.</hi> Next to <hi>Her,</hi> was <hi>Ingratitude,</hi> and she out of a certain <hi>Paste</hi> made up of <hi>Pride</hi> and <hi>Malice,</hi> was moulding of <hi>New De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vils.</hi> I was extreme glad of this Disco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>very,

no <hi>Match-makers</hi> (said she) we should not have the Tenth part of these <hi>Ske<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>letons,</hi> and <hi>Desperado's.

Nay then I perceive (quoth <hi>Death</hi>) now you have a mind to seize me; for that Rascally sort of Cater<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pillers have been my undoing. Had not a man better dye by the <hi>Common Hangman,</hi> than by the <hi>Hand</hi> of an <hi>At<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>torney</hi>? to be killed by <hi>Falsities, Quirks, Cavils, Delays, Exceptions, Cheats, Cir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cumventions</hi>: Yes, yes, And it must not be deny'd, that these <hi>Makers of Matches,</hi> and <hi>Splitters of Causes, are the Principal support of this Imperial Throne.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>At these words, I rais'd my Eyes, and saw <hi>Death</hi> seated in her Chair of state, with abundance of little <hi>Deaths</hi> crowd<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing about her; As the <hi>Death</hi> of <hi>Love,</hi> of <hi>Cold, Hunger, Fear,</hi> and <hi>Laughter</hi>; All, with their several Ensigns and
<pb n="49" facs="tcp:40642:29"/>
Devices. The <hi>Death</hi> of <hi>Love,</hi> I per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived, had very <hi>little Brain,</hi> and to keep her self in Countenance, she kept Company with <hi>Pyramus</hi> and <hi>Thisbe; Hero</hi> and <hi>Leander,</hi> and some <hi>Amadis's</hi> and <hi>Palmerins d' Oliva</hi>; all Embalm'd, steep'd in good Vinegar, and well Dry'd. I saw a great many other sorts of Lovers too, that were brought, in all Appearance, to their last Agonies, but by the singular Miracle of self-In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terest recover'd, to the Tune of
<q>Will, if Looking well won't move her, Looking Ill prevail?</q>
            </p>
            <p>The <hi>Death</hi> of <hi>Cold,</hi> was attended by a many <hi>Prelates, Bishops, Abbots,</hi> and other <hi>Ecclesiasticks</hi>; who had neither Wives, nor Children, nor indeed any body else that cared for them, further than for their Fortunes. These, when they come to a Fit of <hi>sickness,</hi> are <hi>Pil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lag'd</hi> even to their <hi>sheets</hi> and <hi>Bedding,</hi> before ye can say a <hi>Pater-noster.</hi> Nay, many times they are <hi>stript,</hi> e're they are <hi>Laid,</hi> and destroy'd for want of Clothes to keep them warm.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="50" facs="tcp:40642:30"/>The <hi>Death</hi> of <hi>Hunger</hi> was encom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>passed with a Multitude of <hi>Avaritious Misers,</hi> that were <hi>Cording</hi> up of <hi>Trunks; Bolting</hi> of <hi>Dores,</hi> and <hi>Windows; Lock<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing</hi> up of <hi>Cellars,</hi> and <hi>Garrets</hi>; and <hi>Nailing</hi> down of <hi>Trap-doors; Burying</hi> of Pots of <hi>Money,</hi> and starting at every Breath of Wind they heard. Their <hi>Eyes</hi> were ready to drop out of their heads, for want of <hi>sleep</hi>; their <hi>Mouths</hi> and <hi>Bellies</hi> complaining of their <hi>Hands,</hi> and their <hi>Souls</hi> turn'd into <hi>Gold</hi> and <hi>Sil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver</hi> (the Idols they ador'd.)</p>
            <p>The <hi>Death</hi> of <hi>Fear,</hi> had the most <hi>Magnificent Train</hi> and <hi>Attendance,</hi> of all the rest, being accompanied with a great number of <hi>Vsurpers,</hi> and <hi>Tyrants,</hi> who commonly do Justice upon Them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves, for the Injuries they have done to Others: Their own Consciences do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the Office of Tormentors, and Avenging their Publique Crimes by their Private Sufferings; for they live in a perpetual Anguish of Thought, with Fears and Jealousies.</p>
            <p>The <hi>Death</hi> of <hi>Laughter,</hi> was the last of all, and surrounded with a Throng of people, <hi>hasty</hi> to <hi>Believe,</hi> and <hi>slow</hi> to

               <hi>Repent; Living</hi> without <hi>fear</hi> of <hi>Iu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stice,</hi> and <hi>Dying</hi> without <hi>hope</hi> of <hi>Mercy.</hi> These are they that pay all their Debts and Duties with a Jest. Bid any of them give every man his Due, and Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turn what he has either Borrow'd, or wrongfully taken, His Answer is, <hi>You'd make a man dye with Laughing.</hi> Tell him, my Friend, You are now in years, <hi>Your dancing dayes are done,</hi> and your Body is worn out; what should such a <hi>Scare-Crow</hi> as you are, do with a Bed-fellow? Give over your Bawdy Haunts for shame, and do n't make a man Glory of a Sin, when you're past the Pleasure of it, and your self upon all Accompts con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>temptible into the Bargain. <hi>This Fellow</hi> (sayes He) <hi>would make a man break his heart with Laughing.</hi> Come, come, say your Prayers, and bethink your self of Eternity, you have one Foot in the Grave already, and 'tis high time to fit your self for the other World. <hi>Thou wilt absolutely kill me with Laughing.</hi> I tell thee <hi>I'm as sound as a Roche,</hi> and I do not Remember that ever I was bet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter in my Life.

Beds</hi> and even at the last Gasp, to send for a <hi>Divine,</hi> or to make some handsome <hi>settlement</hi> of their <hi>Estates.</hi> Alas, Alas! they'l cry; <hi>I have been as bad as this many a time before,</hi> and (with <hi>Falstaffe's Hostess) I hope in the Lord there's no need to think of him yet.</hi> These men are lost for ever, before they can be brought to understand their Danger. This Vision wrought strangely upon me, and gave me all the Pains and Marques Imagina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble of a true Repentance. Well, (said I) since so it is, that man has but <hi>one life</hi> allotted him, and <hi>so many Deaths</hi>; but <hi>one way into</hi> the World, and so many <hi>Millions out</hi> of it, I will certainly at my Return make it more my Care than it has been to Live with a Good Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>science, that I may dye with Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fort.</p>
            <p>These last words were scarce out of my Mouth, when the <hi>Cryer</hi> of the Court with a loud Voice, Called out, <hi>The Dead, The Dead; Appear the Dead.</hi> And so immediately, I saw the <hi>Earth</hi> begin to <hi>Move,</hi> and gently opening it self, to make way, first for <hi>Heads</hi> and <hi>Arms,</hi> and then by Degrees for the <hi>whole Bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dies</hi>

of <hi>Men</hi> and <hi>Women,</hi> that came out, half muffled in their Night-Caps, and ranged themselves in excellent Order, and with a profound silence. Now (says <hi>Death</hi>) let every one speak in his Turn; And in the instant, up comes One of the <hi>Dead</hi> to my very Beard, with so much Fury and Menace, in his Face and Action, that I would have gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven him half the Teeth in my Head for a Composition. These <hi>Devils</hi> of the <hi>World</hi> (quoth he) what would they be at? my Masters, cannot a poor Wretch be quiet in his Grave for ye? but ye must be Casting your Scorns upon him, and charging him with things that up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on my Soul, he's as Innocent of as the Child that's Unborn. What hurt has he done any of you (ye Scoundrels you) to be thus Abused. And I beseech you, Sir, said I (under your Favourable Correction) who may you be? for I confess I have not the Honour either to Know or to understand ye.

Did I ever rebell against my Superiors? Or, was I ever so arrant a Coxcomb, as by colouring my Cheeks and Hair, to imagine that I could reform Nature, and make my Self young again? Can ye say, that I ever put an Oath to a Lye? or, broke a solemn Promise, as you do every day that goes over your Heads? Did I ever enslave my self to money? Or, on the other side, make Ducks and Drakes with it? and squander it away in Gaming,

Revelling, and Whoring? Did my Wife <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

Was I ever so very a fool as to believe any man would be True to me, who had betray'd his Friend? Or, to ven<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture all my Hopes upon the Wheel of For<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tune? Did I ever envy the Felicity of a Court-life, that sells and spends all for a Glance? What pleasure did I ever take in the lewd Discourses of</hi> Hereticks <hi>and</hi> Li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bertines? <hi>Or, did I ever List my self in the party, to get the name of a</hi> Gifted-Brother? <hi>Who ever saw me Insolent to my Inferiors, or Basely Servile to my bet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters? Did I ever go to a Conjurer, or to your Dealers in Nativities, and Horoscopes upon any Occasion of Loss or Death? Now if you your selves be guilty of all these Fopperies, and I innocent, I beseech ye where's the</hi> Tony? So that you see <hi>To<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny</hi> is not the <hi>Tony</hi> you take him for. But (to Crown his other Vertues) he is also endued with so large a stock of Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tience, that whoever needed it, had it for the asking: Unless it were such as came to borrow money; or in Cases of Women, that claim'd Marriage of him;

or <hi>Laquais</hi> that would be making sport with his Bauble; and to These, He was as Resolute as <hi>Iohn Florio.</hi>

            <p>While we were upon this Discourse, another of the Dead came marching up to me, with a Spanish pace and gra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vity; and giving me a Touch o'the El<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bow; <hi>Look me in the Face</hi> (quoth he with a stern Countenance) <hi>and know Sir, that you are not now to have to do with a Tony.</hi> I beseech your Lordship (said I, saving your Reverence) let me know your Honour, that I may pay my Respects accordingly; for I must confess, I thought all people here had been, <hi>Hail fellow well met</hi>? I am call'd (quoth he) by mortals, <hi>Queen Dick</hi>; and whether you know me or not, I'm sure you'l think of me often enough: and if the Devil did not possess ye, you would let the Dead alone, and content your selves to persecute One Another. Ye can't see a High-crown'd Hat, a Thred-bare Cloak, a Basket-hilt Sword, or a Dudgeon Dagger, nay not so much as a Reverend Matron well stri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken in years, but presently ye cry This or That's of the Mode or Date of

               <hi>Queen Dick.</hi> If ye were not every Mother's Child of ye stark mad, ye would confess that <hi>Queen Dick's</hi> were Golden-daies to those ye have had since, and 'tis an easie matter to prove what I say. Will ye see a Mother now teaching her Daughter a Lesson of good Government? <hi>Child</hi> (says she) <hi>you know that modesty is the great Ornament of your Sex; wherefore be sure, when ye come in Company, that you don't stand staring the men in the Face, as if ye were looking Babies in their Eyes, but rather look a little Downward, as a Fashion of Behaviour, more sutable to the Obligations of your Sex.</hi> Downward? (says the Girl) I beseech you, Madam, Excuse me: This was well enough in the Days of <hi>Queen Dick,</hi> when the poor Crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures knew no better. Let the Men look downward toward the Clay of which they were made, but Man was our Ori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginal, and it will become us to keep our Eyes upon the matter from whence we came.

            <p>Hereupon, <hi>Queen Dick</hi> withdrew, and then appear'd a large <hi>Glass-bottle,</hi> wherein was Luted up (as I heard) a famous <hi>Necromancer,</hi> hackt and minc'd according to his own Order, to render him Immortal. It was boiling upon a Quick fire, and the Flesh by little and little began to piece again, and made first an Arm, then a Thigh, after That a Leg; and at last there was an entire Body, that rais'd it self upright in the Bottle. Bless me (thought I!) what's here? A <hi>man</hi> made of a <hi>Pottage,</hi> and brought into the world out of the Bel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly of a Bottle? This Vision affrighted me to the very Heart; and while I was yet panting and trembling, a voice was heard out of the Glass. <hi>In what year of our Lord are we.</hi> 1636 (quoth I) And welcome, said he; for 'tis the hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>py
<pb n="59" facs="tcp:40642:34"/>
year I have longed for this many a day. Who is it, I pray'e (quoth I) that I now see and hear in the belly of this Bottle? I am (said he) the Great <hi>Necromancer</hi> of <hi>Europe</hi>; and certainly you cannot but have heard both of my Operations in General, and of this par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticular Design. I have heard talk of you from a Child (quoth I) but all those stories I took only for old Wives Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bles. You are the man then it seems: I must confess that at first, at a Distance I took this bottle for the Vessel that the Ingenious <hi>Rablais</hi> makes mention of; but coming neer enough to see what was in it, I did then imagine it might be some <hi>Philosopher by the fire,</hi> or some <hi>Apothecary</hi> doing Penance for his Er<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rors. In fine, it has cost me many a heavy step to come hither, and yet to see so great a Rarity I cannot but think my Time and Pains very well bestow'd. The <hi>Necromancer</hi> call'd to me then to unstop the Bottle, and as I was breaking the Clay to open it: Hold, Hold a lit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle, He cry'd; and I prethee tell me first how go squares in <hi>Spain</hi>? What Mony? Force? Credit? The <hi>Plate-Fleets</hi> go
<pb n="60" facs="tcp:40642:35"/>
and come (said I) reasonably well; but the Forreigners that come in for their snips have half spoil'd the Trade. The <hi>Genoeses</hi> run out as far as the mountains of <hi>Potoss,</hi> and have almost drain'd them dry. My Child (quoth He) That Trade can never be secure and open, so long as <hi>Spain</hi> has any Enemy that's Po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tent at Sea. And for the <hi>Genoeses,</hi> they'l tell you this is no Injustice at all, but on the Contrary, a new way of quitting old scores, and justifying his Catholick Majesty for a good Pay-master. I am no Enemy to that Nation, but upon the Accompt of their Vices and Encroch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments; and I confess, rather than see these Rascals prosper, I'd turn my self into a <hi>Bouillon</hi> again, as ye saw me just now; nay, I did not care if 'twere into a <hi>Powder,</hi> though I ended my daies in a <hi>Tobacco-box.</hi> Good Sir, (said I) com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fort your self, for these people are as miserable as you'd wish them. You know they are <hi>Cavaliers and Signeurs</hi> already, and now (forsooth) they have an Itch upon them to be <hi>Princes</hi>: A va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity that gnaws them like a <hi>Cancer</hi>; and by drawing on great Expences, breeds
<pb n="61" facs="tcp:40642:35"/>
a Worm in their Traffick, so that you'l find little but Debt and Extravagance at the foot of the Accompt. And then the <hi>Devils</hi> in them for a Wench, inso<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>much, that 'tis well, if they bring both ends together; for what's gotten upon the <hi>Change</hi> is spent in the <hi>Stews.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>This is well (quoth the <hi>Necromancer</hi>) and I'm glad to hear it. Pray'e tell me now, what price bears <hi>Honour and Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesty</hi> in the World? There's much to be said (quoth I) upon that point: but in brief, there was never more of it in <hi>Talk,</hi> nor less in <hi>Effect.</hi> Upon my <hi>Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesty</hi> cries the <hi>Tradesman</hi>: Upon my <hi>Honour,</hi> says his <hi>Lordship.</hi> And in a word, Every man has it, and Every thing is it, in some disguise or other: but duly consider'd, there's no such thing upon the Face of the Earth. The <hi>Thief</hi> says 'tis more <hi>Honourable</hi> to <hi>Take</hi> than <hi>Beg.</hi> He that asks an <hi>Alms,</hi> pleads that 'tis <hi>Honester</hi> to <hi>Beg</hi> than <hi>Steal.</hi> Nay the <hi>False Witnesses</hi> and <hi>Murtherers</hi> them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves, stand upon their points, as well as their Neighbours, and will tell ye that a <hi>Man</hi> of <hi>Honour</hi> will rather be <hi>bu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ried alive</hi> than <hi>Submit</hi>: (though they
<pb n="62" facs="tcp:40642:36"/>
will not alwayes do as they say) Upon the whole matter, every man sets up a <hi>Court of Honour</hi> within <hi>himself</hi>; pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nounces every thing <hi>Honourable</hi> that serves his <hi>Purpose,</hi> and laughs at them that think otherwise. To say the Truth, All things are now <hi>Topsy Turvy.</hi> A good <hi>Faculty</hi> in <hi>Lying</hi> is a fair step to <hi>Prefer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment</hi>; and to Pack a Game at Cards, or help the frail Dye, is become the <hi>Marque,</hi> and <hi>Glory</hi> of a <hi>Cavalier.</hi> The <hi>Spaniards</hi> were heretofore, I confess, a very Brave, and well govern'd People: But they have Evil Tongues among them now adays, that say they might e'en go to School to the <hi>Indians</hi> to learn <hi>Sobriety,</hi> and <hi>Vertue.</hi> For they are not really <hi>Sober,</hi> but at their own Tables, which indeed, is rather Avarice<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> than Moderation; for when they Eat or Drink at another man's Cost, there are no greater Gluttons in the World; and for Fudling, they shall make the best <hi>Pot-Companion</hi> in <hi>Switzerland</hi> knock under the Table.</p>
            <p>The <hi>Necromancer</hi> went on with his Discourse, and askt me what store of <hi>Lawyers,</hi> and <hi>Atturneys</hi> in <hi>Spain</hi> at pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sent?
<pb n="63" facs="tcp:40642:36"/>
I told him, that the whole world swarm'd with them, and that there were of several sorts; some, by <hi>Profession</hi>; Others, by <hi>Intrusion,</hi> and <hi>Presumption</hi>; and some again by <hi>Study,</hi> but not many of the last, though in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed sufficient of every kind to make the People pray for the <hi>Egyptian Lo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>custs</hi> and <hi>Caterpillars</hi> in Exchange for that <hi>Vermine.</hi> Why then (quoth the <hi>Necromancer</hi>) if there be such Plagues Abroad, I think I had best e'en keep where I am. It is with <hi>Iustice</hi> (said I) as with <hi>sick men</hi>; In time past, when we had fewer <hi>Doctors</hi> (as well of <hi>Law</hi> as of <hi>Physick</hi>) we had more <hi>Right,</hi> and more <hi>Health</hi>: but we are now destroy'd by <hi>Multitudes,</hi> and <hi>Consultations,</hi> which serve to no Other end than to enflame both the <hi>Distemper,</hi> and the <hi>Reckoning. Iustice,</hi> as well as <hi>Truth,</hi> went naked, <hi>In the Dayes of Old</hi>; One single <hi>Book</hi> of <hi>Laws</hi> and <hi>Ordinances,</hi> was enough for the best Order'd Governments in the world. But <hi>the Iustice of our Age,</hi> is trickt up with <hi>Bills, Parchments, Writs,</hi> and <hi>Labels</hi>; and furnish't with Millions of <hi>Codes, Digests, Pandects,
<pb n="64" facs="tcp:40642:37"/>
Pleadings, and Reports</hi>; And what's their use, but to make <hi>wrangling</hi> a <hi>Sci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence</hi>? and to Embroil us in seditions, Suits, and Endless Trouble and Confu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sion. We have had more books pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lish't this last Twenty years, than in a Thousand before, and there hardly passes a Term without a New Author, in four or five Volumes at least under the Titles of <hi>Glosses, Commentaries, Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ses, Iudgments,</hi> &amp;c. And the great strife is, who writes <hi>Most,</hi> not <hi>Best</hi>; so that the whole Bulk, is but a <hi>Body</hi> with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out a <hi>Soul,</hi> and fitter for a <hi>Church-yard</hi> than a Study. To say the Truth, These <hi>Lawyers</hi> and <hi>Sollicitors,</hi> are but so ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny <hi>Smoak-Merchants; Sellers of Wind,</hi> and <hi>Troublers of the Publick Peace.</hi> If there were no <hi>Atturneys,</hi> there would be no <hi>Suits</hi>; if no <hi>Suits,</hi> No <hi>Cheats,</hi> No <hi>Serjeants</hi>; No <hi>Catchpoles,</hi> No <hi>Prisons</hi>; If no <hi>Prisons,</hi> no <hi>Iudges</hi>; No <hi>Iudges,</hi> No <hi>Passion</hi>; No <hi>Passion,</hi> No <hi>Bribery</hi> or <hi>Subornation.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>See now what a Train of Mischiefs one wretched <hi>Pettyfogger</hi> draws after him! If you go to him for Counsel, he hears your Story, Reads your Case,
<pb n="65" facs="tcp:40642:37"/>
and tells you very gravely: Sir, This is a Nice point, and would be well hand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led; Wee'l see what the Law says. And then he runs ye over with his Eye and Finger, a matter of a Hundred Volums, grumbling all the while, like a Cat that Claws in her Play 'twixt jest and Earn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>est. At last, down comes the Book, he shews ye the Law, bids ye leave your Papers, and hee'l study the Question. But your Cause is very good (sayes he) by what I see already, and if you'l come again in the <hi>Evening,</hi> or <hi>to mor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>row morning,</hi> I'le tell ye more. But pardon me, Sir, now I think on't, I am so full of Business at present, It cannot be till <hi>Munday Next,</hi> and then I'm for ye. When ye are to part, and that you come to the Greasing of his Fift; (The best Thing in the World both for the Wit, and Memory) <hi>Good Lord! Sir</hi> (says he) <hi>what do ye Mean? I beseech you Sir; Nay, pray'e Sir,</hi> and if he spyes you drawing back, the Paw opens, sei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zes the <hi>Guinneys, and Good morrow Country man</hi>; sayst thou me so? (quoth the good Fellow in the Glas) stop me up close again as thou lov'st me then:
<pb n="66" facs="tcp:40642:38"/>
for the very Air of these Rascals will poyson me, if ever I put my Head out of this Bottle, till the whole Race of them be extinct. In the mean time, take this for a Rule. <hi>He that would thrive by Law, must fee his Enemies Counsel as well as his own.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>But now ye talk of great Cheats; what News of the Venetians? Is <hi>Ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nice</hi> yet in the World or no? <hi>In the World</hi> do ye say? Yes, marry Is't (said I) and stands just where it did. Why then (quoth He) I prethee give it to the Devil from me as a Token of my Love; for 'tis a Present equal to the severest Revenge. Nothing can ever destroy that Republick but Consci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence; and then you'l say 'tis like to be Long-liv'd; for if every man had his own, it would not be left worth a Groat. To speak freely, 'tis an od kind of <hi>Common-wealth.</hi> 'Tis the very <hi>Arse<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gut,</hi> the <hi>Drain</hi> and <hi>Sink</hi> of <hi>Monarchies,</hi> both in War and Peace. It helps the <hi>Turk</hi> to Vex the <hi>Christians,</hi> and the <hi>Christians</hi> to Gall the <hi>Turk,</hi> and main<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tains it self to torment Both. The <hi>In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>habitants</hi> are neither <hi>Mores</hi> nor <hi>Christi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans,</hi>
               <pb n="67" facs="tcp:40642:38"/>
as appears by a <hi>Venetian Captain,</hi> in a <hi>Combat</hi> against a <hi>Christian Enemy: Stand to't my Masters (says he) Ye were Venetians before ye were Christians.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Enough enough, of This, cry'd the <hi>Necromancer,</hi> and tell me, how stand the people affected? what <hi>Malecontents</hi> and <hi>Mutiners? Mutiny</hi> (said I) is so Univer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sal a Disease, that every Kingdom is (in Effect) but a Great Hospital, or ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther a Bedlam (for all men are mad) to entertain the Disaffected. There's no stirring for me then (quoth the <hi>Necro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mancer</hi>) but pray'e commend me how<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever to those busy Fools, and tell them, that carry what Face they will, there's <hi>Vanity and Ambition</hi> in the <hi>Pad. Kings</hi> and <hi>Princes</hi> have in <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>heir Nature much of <hi>Quick silver.</hi> They are in <hi>perpetual Agitation,</hi> and without any <hi>Repose</hi> Press them too hard, (that is to say be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>yond the Bounds of Duty and Reason) and they are lost. Ye may observe, that your <hi>Guilders,</hi> and great Dealers in <hi>Quick-silver,</hi> are generally troubled with the <hi>Palsy</hi>; and so should all <hi>Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jects Tremble</hi> that have to do with <hi>Majesty,</hi> and better to do it at first, out
<pb n="68" facs="tcp:40642:39"/>
of <hi>Respect,</hi> then <hi>afterward,</hi> upon <hi>Force and Necessity.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>But before I fall to pieces again, as you saw me e'en now (for better so than worse) I beseech ye, One word more, and it shall be my Last. <hi>Who's King of Spain now?</hi> You know (said I) that <hi>Phillip</hi> the 3<hi rend="sup">d</hi>. is <hi>Dead</hi>: Right (quoth he) A Prince of Incomparable Piety, and Vertue (or my stars deceive me) After him, (said I) came <hi>Philip</hi> the 4<hi rend="sup">th</hi>. If it be so (quoth he) Break, break my Bottle immediately, and help me out; for I am resolv'd to try my Fortune in the world once again, under the Reign of that Glorious Prince. And with that word, he dash't the Glass to pieces against a Rock, crept out of his Case and away he ran. I had a good mind to have kept him Company; but as I was just about to start, Let him go, let him go, cry'd one of the Dead; (and laid hold of my Arm) He has Devil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lish Heeles, and you'l never overtake him.</p>
            <p>So I staid, and what should I see next? but a wondrous Old Man, whose Name might have been <hi>Bucephalus</hi> by his <hi>Head,</hi>
               <pb n="69" facs="tcp:40642:39"/>
and the Hair on his Face might very well have stuff'd a Couple of Cushions: take him together, and you'l find his Picture in the Map, among the <hi>Savages.</hi> I need not tell ye that I stared upon him sufficiently; and he taking notice of it, came to me, and told me; Friend (says he) My Spirit tells me that you are now in Pain to know who I am; Understand, that my Name is <hi>Nostrada<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mus.</hi> Are you the Author then (quoth I) of that <hi>Gallimaufry of Prophecyes</hi> that's publish't in your Name? <hi>Galli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maufry</hi> say'st thou? Impudent and Bar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>barous Rascal that thou art; to despise Misteries, that are above thy Reach, and to Revile the Secretary of the Stars, and the Interpreter of the Destinyes; Who is so Brutal as to doubt the Mean<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of these Lines?
<q>
                  <l>From second Causes This I gather,</l>
                  <l>Nought shall befal us, Good, or Ill,</l>
                  <l>Either upon the Land, or Water,</l>
                  <l>But what the Great Disposer will.</l>
               </q>
            </p>
            <p>Reprobated and besotted Villains that ye are! what greater blessing
<pb n="70" facs="tcp:40642:40"/>
could betide the world, then the Ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>complishment of this Prophecy? would it not Establish Justice and Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lyness, and suppress all the vile suggesti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, and motions of the Devil? Men would not then any longer set their Hearts upon Avarice, Cozening and Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tortion; and make Money their God; That Vagabond Money, that's perpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tually trotting up and down like a wan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dring whore, and takes up most com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monly with the unworthy, leaving the <hi>Philosophers</hi> and <hi>Prophets,</hi> which are the very <hi>Oracles</hi> of the <hi>Heavens</hi> (such as <hi>Nostradamus</hi>) to go barefoot. But let's go on with our <hi>Prophecyes,</hi> and see if they be so frivolous and dark, as the world reports them.
<q>
                  <l>When the marry'd shall Marry,</l>
                  <l>Then the Jealous will be sorry.</l>
                  <l>And though Fools will be talking,</l>
                  <l>To keep their tongues walking;</l>
                  <l>No man runs well I find,</l>
                  <l>But with's Elbows behind.</l>
               </q>
            </p>
            <p>This gave me such a Fit of Laughing, that it made me cast my nose up into the
<pb n="71" facs="tcp:40642:40"/>
Air, like a Stone-horse that had got a Mare in the Wind: Which put the <hi>Astrologer</hi> out of all Patience. Buffon, and Dog-whelp, as ye are (quoth he) There's a Bone for you to pick; you must be snarling and snapping at every thing. Will your Teeth serve ye now to fetch out the Marrow of this Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phecy? Hear then in the Devils name, and be Mannerly. Hear, and Learn I say, and let's have no more of that Grin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning, unless ye have a mind to leave your Beard behind he. Do you ima<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gine that all that are <hi>Marry'd, Marry</hi>? No, not the one half of them. When you are <hi>Marry'd,</hi> the <hi>Priest</hi> has done his part; but after that, to <hi>Marry,</hi> is to do the Duty of a <hi>Husband.</hi> Alack! How many <hi>Marry'd</hi> men live as if they were single; and how many <hi>Batchelors</hi> on the other side, as if they were <hi>Marry'd!</hi> after the Mode of the Times. And <hi>Wedlock,</hi> to divers Couples, <hi>is no other than a more sociable state of Virginity.</hi> Here's one half of my Prophecy ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pounded already, now for the Rest. Let me see you run a little for Experi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, and try if you carry your El<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bows
<pb n="72" facs="tcp:40642:41"/>
before or behind. You'l tell me perhaps, that this is ridiculous, because every body knows it. A pleasant shift: As if Truth were the worse for being Plain. The things indeed that you de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liver for <hi>Truths,</hi> are for the most part meer <hi>Fooleries</hi> and <hi>Mistakes</hi>; and it were a hard matter to put Truth in such a Dress as would please ye. What have ye to say now, either against my Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phecy or my Argument? not a Sylla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble I warrant ye, and yet somewhat there is to be said, for <hi>There's no Rule without an Exception.</hi> Does not the <hi>Physician</hi> carry his <hi>Elbow before</hi> him, when he puts back his hand to take his Patients Money? And away he's gone in a Trice, so soon as He has made his Purchase. But to proceed, here's ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther of my Prophecies for ye,
<q>
                  <l>Many Women shall be Mothers,</l>
                  <l>And their Babbies,</l>
                  <l>Their N'own Daddies.</l>
               </q>
            </p>
            <p>What say ye to this now? are there not many <hi>Husbands</hi> do ye think (if the Truth were known) that father <hi>more
<pb n="73" facs="tcp:40642:41"/>
Children</hi> than <hi>their own?</hi> Believe me (Friend) <hi>A man had need have good security upon a Womans Belly,</hi> for <hi>Chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren</hi> are commonly made in the <hi>Dark,</hi> and 'tis no easie matter to know the <hi>Workman,</hi> especially having nothing but the woman's bare word for't. This is meant of the Court of <hi>Assistance</hi>; And whoever Interprets my Prophe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sies to the Prejudice of any Person of Honour, abuses me. You little think what a world of our Gay folks in their <hi>Coaches and six,</hi> with <hi>Lacquies</hi> at their Heels by the Dozens, will be found <hi>at the last Day,</hi> to be only the <hi>Bastards</hi> of some <hi>Pages, Gentlemen-Vshers,</hi> or <hi>Valets de Chambre</hi> of the Family; nay per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chance the <hi>Physician</hi> may have had his hand in the wrong Box, and in case of necessity, good Use has been made of a <hi>Lusty Coachman.</hi> Little do you think (I say) how many Noble Families upon that Grand Discovery, will be found Extinct for want of Issue.</p>
            <p>I am now convinc'd (said I to the <hi>Mathematician</hi>) of the Excellency of your Predictions; and I perceive (since you have been pleas'd to be your own
<pb n="74" facs="tcp:40642:42"/>
Interpreter) that they have more weight in them, than we were aware of. Ye shall have one more (quoth he) and I have done.
<q>
                  <l>This Year, if I've any skill i'th' Weather,</l>
                  <l>Shall many a one take Wing with a Feather.</l>
               </q>
            </p>
            <p>I dare say that your wit will serve ye now to Imagine, that I'm talking of <hi>Rooks</hi> and <hi>Iack-daws</hi>; but I say, No. I speak of <hi>Lawyers, Attorneys, Clerks, Scriveners,</hi> and their Fellows, that with the Dash of a <hi>Pen,</hi> can defeat their <hi>Cli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ents</hi> of their <hi>Estates,</hi> and <hi>flye away with them</hi> when they have done.</p>
            <p>Upon these words <hi>Nostradamus</hi> Va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nisht, and some body plucking me be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hind, I turn'd my face upon the most meager, melancholick Wretch that ever was seen, and cover'd all in white. For pitty's sake (says he) and as you are a good Christian, do but deliver me from the Persecution of these <hi>Impertinents</hi> and <hi>Bablers</hi> that are now tormenting me, and I'l be your Slave for ever (casting himself at my Feet in the same
<pb n="75" facs="tcp:40642:42"/>
Moment, and crying like a Child.) And what art thou (quoth I) for a misera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble Creature? I am (says he) an Anci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ent, and an Honest man, although de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fam'd with a thousand Reproches and Slanders: And in fine, some call me <hi>Another,</hi> and others <hi>Some-body,</hi> and doubtless ye cannot but have heard of me. As <hi>Some-body</hi> says, cryes one, that has nothing to say for himself; and yet till this Instant, I never so much as open'd my mouth. The <hi>Latines</hi> call me <hi>Quidam,</hi> and make good use of me to fill up Lines, and stop Gaps. When you go back again into the World, I pray'e do me the Favour to own that you have seen me, and to justifie me for one that never did, and never will either speak or write any thing, whatever some Tatling Ideots may pretend. When they bring me into <hi>Quarrels</hi> and <hi>Brawles,</hi> I am call'd forsooth, <hi>A certain Person</hi>: In their <hi>Intrigues, I know not who</hi>: and in the Pulpit, <hi>A certain Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thor</hi>: and all this, to make a Mystery of my Name, and lay all their Foole<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries at my Door. Wherefore I beseech ye help me; which I promis'd to do.

Let the Inhabitants pray heartily<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> for Peace then; and all little enough to keep them quiet. But to see my mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stake now.

have made many of them <hi>Cross</hi> them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves, that took me for a Ghost. Our <hi>Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sters</hi> they curse us too, for Embroyling the Family. So that I have rather Chosen to take up here, betwixt the <hi>Dead</hi> and the <hi>Living,</hi> than to return again to my Charge of a <hi>Doüegna,</hi> the very sound of the Name being more Terrible than a Gibbet. As appears by one that was lately Travailing from <hi>Madrid,</hi> to <hi>Vailladolid,</hi> and asking where he might lodge that night. Answer was made at a small Village call'd <hi>Doüegnas.</hi> But is there no other place (quoth he) within some reasonable Distance, either short or beyond it. They told him no, un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>less it were at a <hi>Gallows.</hi> That shall be my <hi>Quarter</hi> then (quoth he) for a <hi>thou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sand Gibbets</hi> are not so bad to me as one <hi>Doüegnas.</hi> Now ye see how we are abus'd (quoth the <hi>Gouvernante</hi>) I hope you'l do us some Right, when it lyes in your Power.</p>
            <p>She would have talk't me to Death, if I had not given her the slip upon the removing of her Spectacles; but I could not scape so neither, for looking about me for a Guide to carry me home
<pb n="82" facs="tcp:40642:46"/>
again, I was arrested by one of the <hi>Dead</hi>; a good proper Fellow, only he had a pair of <hi>Rams-horns</hi> on his head, and I was about to salute him for <hi>Aries</hi> in the <hi>Zodiac</hi>: but when I saw him plant himself, just before me, with his <hi>best Leg</hi> forward, stretching out his Arms, Clutching his Fists, and looking as Soure as if He would have <hi>Eaten</hi> me without <hi>Mustard</hi>; Doubtless, (said I) <hi>the Devil is Dead and This is He.</hi> No, No, cry'd a by-stander, This is a <hi>man:</hi> Why then (sayd I) he's Drunk, I per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive, and <hi>Quarrelsome in his Ale,</hi> for here's no body has touched him. With that as he was just ready to fall on, I stood to my Guard, and we were arm'd at all points alike, only he had the Ods of the Head-piece. Now, Sirrah, (says he) <hi>have at ye,</hi> slave that you are to make a Trade of Defaming Persons of Honour. By the Death that Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mands here, I'l ha' my Revenge, and <hi>turn your skin over your Ears:</hi> This In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>solent Language stir'd my Choler I confess, and so I call'd to him; Come, come on, Sirrah; A little neerer yet, and if ye have a mind to be twice kill'd,
<pb n="83" facs="tcp:40642:46"/>
I'l do your business; who the Devil brought this <hi>Cornuto</hi> hither to trouble me? The word was no sooner out, but we were immediately at it, Tooth and Nail, and if his Horns had not been flatted to his head, I might have had the worst on't. But the whole Ring pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sently came in to part us, and did me a singular kindness in't, for my Adversary had a Fork, and I had none. As they were <hi>staving and Tayling,</hi> you might have had more manners (cry'd one) than to give such Language to your Bet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters, and to call <hi>Don Diego Moreno, Cuckold.</hi> And is this That <hi>Diego Moreno</hi> then, said I,? Rascal that he is to charge me with abusing persons of Honour. A Scoundrel (said I) that 'tis a shame for Death to be seen in's Company, and was never fit for any thing in his whole life, but to furnish matter for a Farce. And that's my Grievance, Gentlemen, (quoth <hi>Don Diego</hi>) for which with your Leave he shall give me satisfaction. I do not stand upon the matter of being a <hi>Cuckold,</hi> for there's many a Brave fel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low lives in <hi>Cuckolds-Row.</hi> But why does he not name <hi>others,</hi> as well as
<pb n="84" facs="tcp:40642:47"/>
me? As if the Horn grew upon no bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dies head but mine: I'm sure there are Others that a Thousand times bet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter deserve it. I hope, he cannot say that ever I gor'd any of my Superiors; or that my being <hi>Cornuted</hi> has rais'd the Price of <hi>Post-horns, Lanthorns,</hi> or <hi>Pocket-Ink-horns.</hi> Are not <hi>shooing-horns,</hi> and <hi>Knife-handles</hi> as cheap now as ever? Why must I walk the stage then more than my Neighbours? Beyond question there never liv'd a more peace<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able Wretch upon the face of the Earth, all things consider'd, than my self. Ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver was man freer from <hi>Ielousy,</hi> or more careful to step aside at the Time of Vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sit: for I was ever against the spoiling of sport, when I could make None my self. I confess I was not so charitable to the poor as I might have been; The truth of't is, I watcht them as a Cat would do a Mouse, for I did not love them. But then in Requital, I could have out-snorted the seven sleepers, when any of the better sort came to have a word in private with my Wife. The short on't is, We agreed blessedly well together, she and I; for I did what<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever
<pb n="85" facs="tcp:40642:47"/>
she would have me: and she would say a Thousand and a Thousand times: <hi>Long live my poor Diego, the best Condi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion'd, the most complaisant Husband in the World; whatever I do is well done, and he never so much as opens his mouth Good or Bad.</hi> But by her leave that was little to my Credit, and the Jade when she said it, was beside the Cushi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on. For many and many a Time have I said, <hi>This is Well,</hi> and <hi>That's Ill.</hi> When there came any <hi>Poets</hi> to our house, <hi>Fid<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lers</hi> or <hi>Morrice-Dancers,</hi> I would say, <hi>This is not well.</hi> But when the <hi>Rich Merchants</hi> came; <hi>Oh very good,</hi> would I say, <hi>This is as well, as well can be.</hi> Sometime we had the hap to be visited by some <hi>Pennyless Courtier,</hi> or <hi>Low-Country Officer</hi> perchance; then should I take her aside, and Rattle her to some Tune: <hi>Sweetheart,</hi> would I say, <hi>Pray'e what ha' we to do with these Frippery Fellows, and Damme Boyes, shake them off, I'd advise ye, and take this for a warning.</hi> But when any came that had to do with the <hi>Mint,</hi> or <hi>Chequer,</hi> and spent freely, (for lightly come, lightly go) <hi>I marry, my Dear</hi> (quoth I) <hi>there's
<pb n="86" facs="tcp:40642:48"/>
nothing to be lost by keeping such Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pany.</hi> And what hurt in all this now? Nay, on the Contrary, my poor Wife enjoy'd her self happily under the Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tection of my shadow, and being a <hi>Femme Couverte,</hi> not an Officer durst come neer her. Why should then this <hi>Buffon</hi> of a <hi>Poetaster</hi> make <hi>me</hi> still the <hi>Ridicu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lous Entertainment</hi> of all his <hi>Interludes</hi> and <hi>Farces,</hi> and <hi>the Fool in the Play?</hi> By your Favour (quoth I) we are not yet upon even terms; And before we part, you shall know what 'tis to pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>voke a <hi>Poet.</hi> If thou wert but now alive, I'd <hi>write</hi> the to <hi>Death,</hi> as <hi>Archi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>locus</hi> did <hi>Lycambes.</hi> And I'm resolv'd to put the History of thy life in a Satyre, as sharp as Vinegar, and give it the Name of <hi>The Life and Death of Don Diego Moreno</hi>; It shall go hard, (quoth he) but I'l prevent That, and so We fell to't again, Hand and Foot, till at length the very Fancy of a Scuffle wak'd me, and I found my self as weary, as if it had been a Real Combat. I began then to reflect upon the Particulars of my Dream, and to Consider what Ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vantage
<pb n="87" facs="tcp:40642:48"/>
I might draw from it: for the <hi>Dead</hi> are past <hi>fooling,</hi> and <hi>Those are the soundest Counsels, which we receive from such as advise us without either Passion or Interest.</hi>

            <head>THE THIRD VISION OF THE LAST JUDGMENT.</head>
            <p>
               <hi>HOmer</hi> makes <hi>Iupiter</hi> the Author, or Inspirer of Dreams; espe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cially the Dreams of Princes and Governours; and if the matter of them be pious and important. And it is likewise the Judgment of the Learned <hi>Propertius,</hi> that <hi>Good Dreams come from above, have their weight, and ought not to be slighted,</hi> And truly I am much of his mind, in the Case of a Dream I had the other Night. As I was reading a Discourse touching the <hi>End of the World,</hi> I fell asleep over the Book, and Dreamt of <hi>The Last Iudg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment.</hi> (A thing which in the House of a Poet is scarce admitted so much as in a Dream.) This Phansie minded me of a Passage in <hi>Claudian; That all Creatures
<pb n="89" facs="tcp:40642:49"/>
dream at Night of what they have heard and seen in the Day: as the Hound dreams of Hunting the Hare.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Methought I saw a very handsome Youth towring in the Air, and sound<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of a Trumpet; but the forcing of his Breath did indeed take off much of his Beauty. The very Marbles, I per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived, and the Dead obey'd his Call; for in the same moment, the Earth be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gan to open, and set the Bones at Liber<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty, to seek their Fellows. The First that appear'd, were <hi>Sword-men</hi>; As <hi>Generals of Armies, Captains, Lieute<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nants<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> Common-Souldiers</hi>; who suppo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sing that it had <hi>sounded a Charge,</hi> came out of their Graves, methought, with the same Briskness and Resolution, as if they had been going to an Assault or a Combat. The <hi>Misers</hi> put their Heads out, all Pale and Trembling, for fear of a <hi>Plunder.</hi> The <hi>Cavaliers</hi> and <hi>Good Fellows</hi> believed they had been going to a <hi>Horse-Race,</hi> or <hi>a Hunting-match.</hi> And in fine, though they all heard the <hi>Trum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pet,</hi> there was not any Creature knew the meaning of it (for I could read their Thoughts by their Looks and Ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stures.)
<pb n="90" facs="tcp:40642:50"/>
After This, there appear'd a great many <hi>Souls</hi>; whereof some came up to their <hi>Bodies,</hi> though with much Difficulty and Horrour: Others stood wondring at a Distance, not daring to come near so hideous and frightful a Spectacle. This wanted an Arm, That an Eye, T'other a Head. Upon the whole, though I could not but smile at the Prospect of so strange a variety of Figures; yet was it not without just matter of Admiration at the <hi>All-pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>erful Providence,</hi> to see <hi>Order</hi> drawn out of <hi>Confusion,</hi> and every part re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stor'd to the right Owner. I Dreamt my self then in a <hi>Church-Yard</hi>; and there, methought, divers that were loth to appear, were changing of Heads; and an <hi>Attorney</hi> would have <hi>Demurrer</hi> upon Pretence that He had got a Soul was none of his Own, and that his Bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy and Soul were not fellows.</p>
            <p>At length, when the whole Congre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gation came to understand that This was <hi>the Day of Iudgment,</hi> it was worth the while, to observe what shifting and shuffling there was among the <hi>Wicked.</hi> The <hi>Epicure</hi> and <hi>Whore-master</hi> would
<pb n="91" facs="tcp:40642:50"/>
not own his <hi>Eyes,</hi> nor the <hi>Slanderer</hi> his <hi>Tongue,</hi> because they'd be sure to ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pear in Evidence against them. The <hi>Pick-Pockets</hi> ran away as hard as they could drive from their own <hi>Fingers.</hi> There was one that had been Embalm'd in <hi>Egypt,</hi> and staying for his <hi>Tripes,</hi> an Old Usurer askt him, if the <hi>Bags</hi> were to rise with the <hi>Bodies</hi>? I could have laught at this Question, but I was pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sently taken up with a Crowd of <hi>Cut-purses,</hi> running full speed from their own Ears (that were offer'd them again) for fear of the sad Stories they expected to hear. I saw all this from a Conve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nient Standing; and in the Instant, There was an Outcry at my Feet, <hi>With<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>draw, Withdraw.</hi> The word was no sooner given, but down I came, and immediately a great many <hi>Handsom La<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dies</hi> put forth their Heads, and call'd me Clown, for not paying them that Respect and Ceremony which belong'd to their Quality (now you must know that the <hi>Women</hi> stand upon their Pan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>toffles, even in H<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

After This, I saw a many People dri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving a <hi>Physician</hi> along the bank of a Ri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver, and these were only such as He had unnecessarily dispatcht before their time. They follow'd him with Cries of, <hi>Iustice, Iustice,</hi> and forc'd him on toward the <hi>Iudgment-Seat,</hi> where they arriv'd in the end with much ado. While This pass'd, I heard, methought, upon my left-hand a <hi>Paddling</hi> in the <hi>Water,</hi> as if one had been Swimming: and what should this be, but a <hi>Iudge</hi> in the middle of a River washing and rinsing his hands, over and over. I askt him the meaning of it; and he told me, that in his life time he had been often dawb'd in the Fist, to make business slip the better, and he would willingly get out the Grease before he came to hold up his hand at the Bar. There follow'd next a Multitude of <hi>Vintners</hi> and <hi>Tay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lers,</hi> under the Guard of a Legion of <hi>Devils,</hi> arm'd with <hi>Rods, Whips, Cud<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gels,</hi> and other Instruments of Corre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction: and These Counterfeited them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves Deaf, and were very loth to leave their Graves, for fear of a worse lodging. As they were passing on, up
<pb n="94" facs="tcp:40642:52"/>
started a <hi>little Lawyer</hi> and askt whither they were going; They made answer, that they were going to give an ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>compt of their Works. With that the <hi>Lawyer</hi> threw himself flat upon his Belly in his hole again: if I am to go down<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward at last (says he) I am thus much onward of my way. The <hi>Vintner</hi> sweat as he walkt, 'till one drop follow'd ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther; That's well done cry'd a <hi>Devil</hi> at's Elbow, to purge out thy water, that we may have none in our Wine. There was a <hi>Tayler</hi> wrapt up in <hi>Sarce<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nets, crook-finger'd</hi> and <hi>Baker-leg'd,</hi> spake not one word all the way he went, but <hi>Alas! Alas</hi>! how can any man be a <hi>Thief</hi> that dies for want of Bread? But his Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>panions gave him a Rebuke for Discre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diting his Trade. The next that ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peared were a <hi>Band</hi> of <hi>High-way-men,</hi> following upon the Heels one of ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, in great Distrust and Jealousie of Thieves among themselves. These were fetcht up by a Party of Devils in the <hi>turning of a Hand</hi> and lodg'd with the <hi>Taylers</hi>; for (said one of the Compa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny) your <hi>High-way-man</hi> is but a <hi>Wild Tayler.</hi> They were a little Quarrelsome
<pb n="95" facs="tcp:40642:52"/>
at first, but in the Conclusion, they went down into the Vally, and Ken<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nell'd quietly together. After these came <hi>Folly</hi> with her Gang of <hi>Poets, Fid<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lers, Lovers,</hi> and <hi>Fencers</hi>: the People of all the World, that Dream the least of a Day of Reckoning; These were di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sposed of among the <hi>Hangmen, Iews, Scribes,</hi> and <hi>Philosophers.</hi> There were also a great many <hi>Sollicitors</hi> wondring among themselves, that they should have so much <hi>Conscience</hi> when they were <hi>Dead,</hi> and none at all <hi>Living.</hi> In fine, the <hi>Word</hi> was given, <hi>Silence.</hi>

The <hi>Righteous</hi> they were employ'd in <hi>Prayers</hi> and <hi>Thanks<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>givings</hi>; and the Ungodly in framing of <hi>Shifts</hi> and <hi>Evasions,</hi> to <hi>Extenuate</hi> their Pains. The <hi>Guardian Angels</hi> were at hand, on the one side to acquit them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves
<pb n="96" facs="tcp:40642:53"/>
of their Duties and Commissions. And on the other side, were the <hi>Devils</hi> hunting for more matters of Aggrava<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion and Charge against Offenders. The <hi>Ten Commandments</hi> had the Guard of a <hi>Narrow-Gate,</hi> which was so strait, that the most mortify'd body could not pass it, without leaving a good part of his skin behind him.</p>
            <p>On one Hand, there were in Multi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tudes; <hi>Disgraces, Misfortunes, Plagues, Griefs,</hi> and <hi>Troubles</hi>; All in a Clamour against the <hi>Physicians.</hi> The <hi>Plague</hi> Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fest indeed, that she had struck many; but 'twas the <hi>Doctor</hi> did their business. <hi>Melancholy</hi> and <hi>Disgrace</hi> said the like; and <hi>Misfortunes</hi> of all sorts made open Protestation, that they never brought any man to his Grave, without the Help and Advice of a <hi>Doctor.</hi> So that the <hi>Gentlemen of the Faculty</hi> were call'd to Accompt for those they had kill'd.

(cry'd <hi>Iudas</hi> that was by) if that were such a fault, what will become of me that sold and betray'd my Lord and Master? Next came the <hi>Patriarchs,</hi> and then the <hi>Apostles,</hi> who took their Places by St. <hi>Peter.</hi> It was worth the Noting, that at this Day there was no Distinction between <hi>Kings</hi> and <hi>Beggars,</hi> before the <hi>Iudgment-Seat.

            <p>There came in immediately upon this, a kind of a sowre rough-hewn fellow; Look ye (says he) stretching out his Arm, here are my Letters. The Company wonder'd at the Humour, and askt the Porter what he was; which

At which word, all his Testimonials fell out of his Hand, and a Couple of Devils would fain have whipt them up, to have brought them in Evidence against him at his Tryal; but the Fencer was too Nimble for Them, and took them Up himself. At which time, an <hi>Angel</hi> offer'd him his Hand to help him in; but He, for fear of an <hi>Attaque,</hi> leapt a step backward, and with great agility, <hi>alonging</hi> withall, Now (says he) if ye think fit, I'l give ye a Tast of my skill. The Company fell a laughing, and This Sentence was past upon him; <hi>That since by his Rules of Art He had oc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>casioned so many Duels and Murders, He should Himself go to the Devil by a Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pendicular Line.</hi> He pleaded for Him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>self, that He was no <hi>Mathematician,</hi> and knew no such Line: but while the word was in his Mouth a Devil came up to him, gave him a turn and a half, and down he Tumbled.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="99" facs="tcp:40642:54"/>After Him, came the <hi>Treasurers,</hi> and with such a Cry following them, for what they had Cheated and Stoln; that some said, the <hi>Thieves</hi> were coming; Others said No; And the Company was divided upon't; They were much trou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bled at the word, <hi>Thieves,</hi> and desired the Benefit of Counsel to plead their Cause.

That's e'en as't hitts; (said he) At that Word, the Devil that manag'd the Cause against him, prest his Charge, and laid it Home to him, that He had put off <hi>Catts</hi> for <hi>Hares</hi>; and filled his <hi>Pyes,</hi> with <hi>Bones</hi> instead of <hi>Flesh</hi>; and not only so, but that he had sold <hi>Horse<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flesh, Dogs</hi> and <hi>Foxes</hi> for <hi>Beef</hi> and <hi>Mut<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ton.</hi> Upon the Issue, it was prov'd against him, that <hi>Noah</hi> never had so many <hi>Animals</hi> in his <hi>Ark</hi> as this poor fellow had put in his <hi>Pyes,</hi> (for we read of no <hi>Rats</hi> and <hi>Mice</hi> there) so that he e'en gave up his Cause, and went away to see if his Oven were hot.

Away with him to Hell Once again then they cry'd; and let him get out now if He can. So they all fil'd off, and <hi>Orpheus</hi> was their <hi>Guide,</hi> because he had been there once before. So soon as the <hi>Poets</hi> were gone, there knockt at the Gate a Rich <hi>Penurious Chuffe</hi>; but 'twas told him, that the <hi>Ten Commandments</hi> kept it, and that he had not kept them. It is Impossible (quoth he) under favour, to prove that ever I broke any One of them.

to set Him Right, and all was well again.</p>
            <p>In the next place, came a fellow, weeping, and wayling; but my Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sters, (says he) my Cause is never the worse for my <hi>Crying,</hi> for if I would stand upon my Merits, I could tell ye that I have kept as good Company, and had as much to do with the <hi>Saints,</hi> as ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther Body. What have we here (cry'd one) <hi>Dioclesian,</hi> or <hi>Nero</hi>? for They had enough to do with the Saints, though 'twere but to persecute Them. But up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on the Upshot, what was this poor Creature, but a small <hi>Officer,</hi> that swept the Church, and dusted the Images and Pictures. His Charge, was for stealing the <hi>Oyl</hi> out of the Lamps, and leaving all in the Dark; pretending that the <hi>Owles,</hi> and <hi>Iack-daws</hi> had drunk it up. He had a Trick too of Clothing him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>self out of the <hi>Church-habits,</hi> which he got new-dy'd; And of <hi>Crumming his Porrege with Consecrated Bread,</hi> that he stole every <hi>Sunday.</hi> What He said for Himself, I know not: but he had his <hi>Mittimus,</hi> and took the Left-hand way at parting.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="109" facs="tcp:40642:59"/>With that, a voice was heard, <hi>Make way there, Clear the Passage</hi>: And this was for a <hi>Bevy</hi> of handsome, buxsome <hi>Bona Roba's,</hi> in their <hi>Caps</hi> and <hi>Feathers,</hi> that came <hi>dancing, laughing,</hi> and <hi>singing</hi> of <hi>Ballads</hi> and <hi>Lampoons,</hi> and as mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry as the Day was long. But They quickly chang'd their Note, for so soon as ever they saw the Hideous Looks of the Devils, they fell into Violent Fits of the Mother; Beating their Breasts, and Tearing their Hair, with all theHor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ror and Fury Imaginable. There was an Angel offer'd in their Favour, that they had been great Frequenters of <hi>Our La<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy's Chappel.</hi> Yes, yes (cry'd a Devil) <hi>less of her Chappel, and more of herVirtue,</hi> would have done well. There was a Notable Whipster, among the rest, that confest, the Devil had reason. And then her Tryal came on, for making a Cloak of a <hi>Sacrament</hi>; and only <hi>Marrying,</hi> that she might play the <hi>Whore</hi> with <hi>Pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vilege,</hi> and never want a <hi>Father</hi> for her <hi>Bastards.</hi> It was her fortune alone to be condemn'd; and going along, well, she cry'd!

            <p>And now, after long waiting, came <hi>Iudas</hi> and <hi>Mahomet</hi> upon the Stage, and to them <hi>Iack of Leyden</hi>: Up comes an Officer, and askt which of the Three was <hi>Iudas?</hi> I am He, quoth <hi>Iack of Leyden.</hi> Nay, but I am <hi>Iudas</hi> cry'd <hi>Mahomet.</hi> They're a Couple of <hi>Lying Rascals,</hi> says <hi>Iudas</hi> himself, for I am the man: only the Rogues make use of my Name to save their Credit. 'Tis True I sold my Master Once, and the World has ever since been the better for't: But these Villains sell Him and Themselves too, every hour of the Day, and there follows nothing but Misery and Confu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sion. So they were all Three packt away to their Disciples.</p>
            <p>The Angel that kept the Book, found that the <hi>Serjeants</hi> and <hi>Remembrancers</hi> were to come on next; whereupon they were call'd, and appear'd: but the Court was not much troubled with them, for they confest Guilty at first word, and so were ty'd up without any more ado.</p>
            <p>The next that appear'd was an <hi>Astro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>loger,</hi> loaden with <hi>Almanacks, Globes,

Astrolabes, &amp;c.</hi> making Proclamation as loud as He could bawl, that there must needs be a gross Mistake in the Reckoning, for <hi>Saturn</hi> had not finisht his Course, and the world could not be yet at an End. One of the Devil<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

But This I must needs tell ye, (says he to the <hi>Mathematician</hi>) 'Tis a strange thing, ye should create so ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny <hi>Heavens</hi> in your <hi>Life,</hi> and go to the <hi>Devil</hi> for want of one after your <hi>Death.</hi> Nay, for <hi>Going,</hi> (cry'd the <hi>Astrologer</hi>) ye shall excuse me; but if you'l <hi>Carry</hi> me, <hi>Well and Good.</hi> And immediately Order was given to carry him away and Pay the Porter.</p>
            <p>Hereupon methought, the Court rose, the Throne Vanisht; the Shadows and Darkness withdrew; the Air sweet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>en'd; the Earth was cover'd with Flowers; the Heavens Clear: And then I waked; not a little satisfy'd to find that after all this, I was still in my Bed, and among the Living. The Use I

made of my Dream was this: I betook my self presently to my Prayers, with a firm Resolution of changing my life, and putting my Soul into such a Frame of Piety and Obedience, that I might attend the coming of the Great Day with Peace and Comfort.</p>

I was carry'd then (me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thought I knew not how) into a fair Medow: A Medow, pleasant and agreeable infinitely beyond the very Fictions of your half-witted Poets,

with all their far-fetch't Gildings, and Enamellings (for a Paper of Verses is worth nothing with them, unless they force Nature for't, and Riffle both the <hi>Indies.</hi> This Delicious Field was wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter'd with <hi>two Riv'lets</hi>; the <hi>One, Bitter</hi>; the <hi>Other, Sweet</hi>; and yet they ming<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led their streams with a pretty kind of Murmur, Equal perhaps to the best Mu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sick in the World. The use of these <hi>Waters</hi> was, (as I observ'd) to temper the Darts of <hi>Love</hi>; for while I was up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on the Prospect of the Place, I saw several of <hi>Cupid's little Officers,</hi> and sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jects, dipping of <hi>Arrows</hi> there, for their Entertainment, and Ease. Upon this, I Phansy'd my self in one of the Gar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dens of <hi>Cyprus,</hi> and that I saw the very <hi>Hive,</hi> where the <hi>Bee</hi> liv'd, that stung my <hi>Young Master,</hi> and occasion'd that Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cellent Ode which <hi>Anacreon</hi> has writ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten upon the Subject.

            <p>The <hi>Finishing,</hi> and <hi>Materials</hi> were pleasant to Admiration.

               <hi>Beauty.</hi> She would let any man in to see the House for a <hi>Look</hi>; and that was all I paid for my Passage.

that ever I saw. And withal (as I observ'd) no small Authority in the Place, which made me enquire after this Creature's <hi>Name,</hi> and <hi>Office.</hi> My <hi>Name</hi> (quoth she) for now it prov'd to be a <hi>Woman</hi>) is <hi>Ielousy,</hi> and methinks, you and I should be better acquainted, for how come you here else? However, for your satisfaction; you are to un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derstand that the greater part of the Distemper'd people you see here, are of my bringing; and yet I am not their <hi>Physician,</hi> but their <hi>Tormentor</hi>; and serve only to <hi>aggravate,</hi> and <hi>Embitter</hi> their <hi>Misfortunes.</hi> If you would know any thing further of the <hi>House,</hi> never ask me, for 'tis Forty to One I shall tell you a Lye; I have not told you half the Truth even of my self; and to deal plainly with you, I am made up of <hi>In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ventions, Artifice,</hi> and <hi>Imposture</hi>: But the Good Old man that walks there, is the <hi>Major Domo,</hi> and will t<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

            <p>I past out of the <hi>First Court,</hi> into the <hi>Maids-Quarter,</hi> which was the very strongest part of the whole Building; and so't had need; for divers of the <hi>Young Wenches</hi> were so Extravagant and Furious, that no other place would have held them.

            <p>When I had tyr'd my self with this Variety of <hi>Folly</hi> and <hi>Madness,</hi> I went to the <hi>Devotes</hi>; where I found a great many <hi>women</hi> and <hi>girles</hi> that had <hi>Cloy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stered</hi> up themselves from the Conver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sation of the <hi>World</hi>; and yet were not a jot <hi>soberer</hi> than their <hi>Fellows.</hi> These one would have thought might have been easily cur'd, but many of them were in for their Lives, in despight of Either <hi>Counsel</hi> or <hi>Physick.</hi> The Room where they were was <hi>Barricado'd</hi> with strong Bars of Iron; and yet when the Toy took them, They'd make now and then a <hi>Sally:</hi> for when the Fit was up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on them, they'd own no <hi>Superior</hi> but <hi>Love,</hi> come what would on't in the Event. The greater part of these good People, were writing of <hi>Tickets</hi> and <hi>Dispatches,</hi> which had still <hi>the sign of the Cross</hi> at the <hi>Top,</hi> and <hi>Satan</hi> at the
<pb n="125" facs="tcp:40642:67"/>
               <hi>Bottom,</hi> concluding with This, or some such <hi>Postscript; I commend this Paper to your Discretion.</hi> The <hi>Fools</hi> of <hi>This Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vince</hi> would be <hi>Twatling</hi> Night and Day; and if it happen'd that any one of them had talkt her self a weary, (which was very rare) she would presently take up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on her very gravely to admonish the Rest, and read a Lecture of <hi>Silence</hi> to the <hi>Company.</hi> There were some that for want of better Entertainment fell in Love with one another; but these were lookt upon as a sort of <hi>Fops</hi> and <hi>Ninnys,</hi> and therefore the more favou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rably us'd; but they'd have been of another mind, if they had known the Cause of their Distemper.</p>
            <p>The Root of all these several Extra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vagancies was <hi>Idleness,</hi> which (accord<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to <hi>Petrarch's</hi> Observation) never fails to make way for <hi>wantonness.</hi> There was One among the Rest, that had <hi>more Letters of Exchange upon the Credit of her insatiable desires, than a whole Regiment of Banquiers.</hi> Some of them were sick of their <hi>Old Visiter,</hi> and call'd for a <hi>Fresh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man.</hi> Others, by Intervals, I perceiv'd had their wits about them, and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tented
<pb n="126" facs="tcp:40642:68"/>
themselves discreetly with <hi>the Physician of the House.</hi> In short, It e'en pity'd my heart to see so many poor people in so sad a Condition, and with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out any hope of Relief, as I gather'd from him that had them in care: for they were still Puddering and Royling their Bodies; and if they got a little Ease for the present, they'd be down again, as soon as they had taken their Medicine.</p>
            <p>From thence, I went to the <hi>single women</hi> (such as made Profession never to marry) which were the least Outra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gious, and discompos'd of all; for they had a thousand wayes to <hi>Lay the Devil</hi> as well as to <hi>Raise</hi> him. Some of them liv'd like <hi>common High-way men, by Robbing Peter</hi> to <hi>Pay Paul</hi>; and strip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ping honest men to cloth Rascals, which is (under favour) but a lewd kind of Charity. Others there were, that were absolutely out of their seven senses, and as Mad as <hi>March-Hares</hi> for <hi>This Wit,</hi> and <hi>t'other Poet</hi>; that never fail'd to pay them again in <hi>Rimes,</hi> and <hi>Madri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gals,</hi> with <hi>Ruby Lips; Pearly Teeth</hi>: so that to read their Ver<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

            <p>I saw One in Consultation with a <hi>Cunning man</hi> to know her <hi>Fortune</hi>; Another, dealing with a <hi>Conjurer</hi> for a <hi>Philtre,</hi> or <hi>Drink</hi> to make her Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lov'd. A Third was <hi>dawbing</hi> and <hi>patch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing</hi> up an <hi>Old ruin'd-Face,</hi> to make it fresh and young again: but she might as well have been <hi>washing of a Black<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moor to make him White.</hi> In fine, a world there were, that with their <hi>borrow'd Hair, Teeth, Eyes, Eye-Brows,</hi> look't like fine folks at a Distance, but would have been left as Ridiculous, as <hi>AEsop's Crow,</hi> if every Bird had fetch't away his own Feather.

            </p>
            <p>And so I step't into the <hi>Men's Quar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter</hi> which was but next door, and only a Thick Wall between. Their great Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sery was that they were <hi>deaf to good ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vice,</hi> obstinately <hi>hating,</hi> and <hi>despising</hi>
               <pb n="128" facs="tcp:40642:69"/>
both <hi>Physick,</hi> and <hi>Physician:</hi> for if they would have either <hi>quitted,</hi> or <hi>chang'd,</hi> they might have been <hi>cured.</hi> But they chose rather to dye, and though they saw their Errour, would not mend it. Which minded me of the Old Rime:

            </p>
            <p>These <hi>Fools-male</hi> were all in the same Chamber; and one might per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fectly read their <hi>Humour,</hi> and <hi>Distemper,</hi> in their <hi>Looks</hi> and <hi>Gestures. Oh! how many a gay Lad did I see there, in his Poynt Band, and Embroyder'd Vest, that had not a whole Shirt to his Back!

How many a poor Devil that wanted Bread, and was yet troubled with the Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bellion of the Flesh!</hi> Some there were, that spent much time in setting their

the poor <hi>Mutes,</hi> and I wish't with all my Heart, their <hi>Mistresses</hi> had been <hi>Witches,</hi> that <hi>they might have known their Meaning by their Mumping</hi>; but they were lost to all Counsel, so that there was no advising them. There was another sort of <hi>Elevated,</hi> and <hi>Conceited Lovers</hi>: and These forsooth were not to be satisfy'd without the <hi>Seven Libe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral Sciences,</hi> and <hi>the Four Cardinal Ver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tues,</hi> in the shape of a <hi>Woman</hi>; and their Case was Desperate. The next I ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>serv'd, were a Generation of <hi>Modest Fools,</hi> that past there under the Notion of people <hi>Diffident of Themselves.</hi> They were generally men of good Under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derstanding, but for the most part <hi>Younger Brothers,</hi> of <hi>low fortunes,</hi> and such as for want of wherewithal to go to the Price of <hi>higher Amours,</hi> were fain to take up with <hi>Ordinary Stuffe,</hi> that brought them nothing in the End, but <hi>Beggery,</hi> and <hi>Repentance.</hi> The <hi>Hus<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bands,</hi> I perceiv'd, were horribly furi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous, although in <hi>Manacles,</hi> and <hi>Shackles.

            <p>I came now to reflect upon what I had seen, and as I was walking (in that Meditation) toward another lodging, I found my self (ere I was aware) in the <hi>first Court</hi> again; where I enter'd, and in it I observ'd new Wonders: I saw that the Number of the <hi>Mad fools</hi> in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>creas'd every moment; Although Time (I perceiv'd) did all that was possible to recover them. There was <hi>Ielousy</hi> tor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>menting even those that were most con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fident of the Faith of what they lov'd. There was <hi>Memory</hi> rubbing of <hi>Old sores.</hi> There was <hi>Vnderstanding,</hi> lock't up in a <hi>dark Cellar</hi>: and <hi>Reason</hi> with <hi>both her Eyes out.</hi> I made a little pause, the better to observe these Varieties, and Disgui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ses. And when I had look't my self a weary, I turn'd about and spy'd a Door; but so Narrow that it was hardly passa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble; And yet streight as it was, divers there were that <hi>Ingratitude,</hi> and <hi>Infide<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lity</hi> had set at <hi>Liberty</hi>; and made a shift to get through.

            <p>IT is utterly Impossible for any thing in this World to fix our <hi>Appetites,</hi> and <hi>Desires,</hi> but they are still flit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting and restless like <hi>Pilgrims</hi>; delight<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed and nourish't with <hi>Variety</hi>: which shews how much we are mistaken in the Value and Quality of the things we co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vet. And hence it is, that what we <hi>pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sue</hi> with the greatest <hi>delight,</hi> and <hi>Passi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on</hi> Imaginable, yields us nothing but <hi>Satiety,</hi> and <hi>Repentance</hi> in the <hi>Possession</hi>; yet such is the Power of these <hi>Appetites</hi> of ours, that when they <hi>call,</hi> and <hi>com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mand</hi>; we <hi>follow,</hi> and <hi>Obey</hi>; though we find in the End, that what we took for a <hi>Beauty</hi> upon the <hi>Chace,</hi> proves but a <hi>Carkass</hi> in the <hi>Quarry</hi>; and we are

sick on't as soon as we have it. Now the <hi>World,</hi> that knows our <hi>Palate,</hi> and <hi>In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clination,</hi> never fails to feed the Hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mour, and to flatter, and entertain us, with all sorts of <hi>Change,</hi> and <hi>Novelty</hi>; as the most certain Method of gaining upon our Affections.</p>
            <p>One would have thought, that these Considerations might have put sober Thoughts and Resolutions in my Head, but it was my fate to be taken off, in the very Middle of my <hi>Morality</hi> and <hi>Specula<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions</hi>; and carry'd away from my self by <hi>Vanity,</hi> and <hi>Weakness,</hi> into the wide world, where I was for a while after, not much unsatisfy'd with my Condi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion. As I past from one place to ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, several that saw me (I perceiv'd) did but make sport with me: for the further I went, the more I was at a loss in that <hi>Labyrinth</hi> of <hi>Delusions.</hi> One while, I was in with the <hi>Sword-men</hi> and <hi>Bravoes</hi>; up to the Ears in <hi>Challenges,</hi> and <hi>Quarrels</hi>; and never without an Arm in a Scarf, or a broken Head. Another Fit; I was never well, but either at the <hi>Fleece-Tavern,</hi> or <hi>Bear</hi> at <hi>Bridg-foot,</hi> stuffing my Guts with <hi>Food,</hi>

and <hi>Tipple,</hi> till the Hoops were ready to burst. Beside twenty other Enter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainments that I found, every jott as Extravagant as these, which to my great Trouble and Admiration, left me not so much as one moment of Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pose.</p>
            <p>As I was in one of my unquiet, and pensive Moods; some body call'd after me and pluck't me by the Cloak: which prov'd to be <hi>A person of a Venerable age; His Clothes miserably poor and Tat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter'd; and his Face, just as if He had been Trampl'd upon in the Streets,</hi> which did not yet hinder, but that <hi>he had still the Ayr and Appearance of one that de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>serv'd much Honour and Respect.</hi> Good Father, (said I to him) why should you envy me my Enjoyments? Pray'e let me alone, and do not trouble your self with me, or my doings. <hi>You're past the pleasure of Life your self, and can't endure to see other people merry, that have the world before them.</hi> Consider of it; you are now upon the point of leaving the world, and I am but newly come into't.

Son (said the old man, smiling) I shall neither hinder, nor envy thy Delights, but in pure pity I would fain reclaim Thee. <hi>Do'st thou know the Price of a Day; an hour; or a Minute?</hi> Did'st ever examine the value of <hi>Time?</hi> If thou had'st, thou would'st employ it better; and not cast away so many blessed Opportunities upon Trifles; and so Easily, and Insensibly, part with so inestimable a Treasure. <hi>What's become of thy past hours? have they made thee a Promise, to come back again at a Call when thou hast need of them? Or, can'st thou show me which way they went?</hi> No, No; They are gone without Recovery; and in their Flight, methinks, Time seems to turn his Head, and laugh over his shoulder, in Derision of those that made no better use of him, when they had him. Do'st thou not know, that all the Minutes of our life, are but as so many Links of a Chain, that has Death at the End on't? and every Moment brings thee nearer thy Expected End, which perchance, while the word is speaking, may be at thy very door: And doubtless at thy rate of Living, it will
<pb n="140" facs="tcp:40642:75"/>
be upon thee before thou art aware. <hi>How stupid is He, that Dyes while he Lives, for fear of Dying! How wicked is He that Lives, as if He should never Dye; and only fears Death when he comes to feel it!</hi> which is too late for comfort, either to Body, or Soul: And He is certainly none of the Wisest that spends all his days in Lewdness, and Debauchery; without considering<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> that of his whole Life, any Minute might have been his last.</p>
            <p>My Good Father (said I) I am be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>holding to you for your Excellent Dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>courses, for they have deliver'd me out of the Power of a Thousand Frivolous and Vain Affections, that had taken pos<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>session of me.

If thou hast a Mind to see the <hi>World</hi> I talk of, come along with me, and I'l carry thee into a place<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> where thou shalt have a full Prospect of it; and without any Incon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venience, see all that's in't; or in the People that dwell in't; and look it through and through.

her Cheeks; if that of her Lips and Teeth did not Exceed it. In a word, all she look't upon was her own; and This was the Vision for my Money, from all the Rest. As she was marching off, I could not chuse but take up a Resolu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion to follow her. But my old man laid a Block in the way, and stop't me at the very starting; which was an Af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>front, to a Man that was both in <hi>Love,</hi> and in <hi>Haste,</hi> that might very well stir his Choler. My Officious Friend (said I) <hi>He that does not love a Woman, suck't a Sow.</hi> And questionless, He must be either Blind or Barbarous, that's Proof against the Charms of so Divine a Beauty. Nor would any but a Sot, let slip the blessed Opportunity of so fair an Encounter. A Handsome Wo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man? why, <hi>what was she made for, but to be Lov'd?</hi> And He that has Her, has all that's Lovely, or Desireable in Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture. For my own part, I would re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nounce the World for the fellow of her, and never desire any thing either beyond her, or beside her.

Motions, for the very Souls of her Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>holders! Was ever any thing so clear as her forehead? Or so black as her Eye-brows? One would swear, that her Complexion had taken a Tincture of Vermilion, and Milk: and that Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture had brought her into the World with Pearl, and Rubies in her Mouth. To speak all in little, she's the Master<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>piece of the Creation, worthy of Infi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nite Praise, and Equal to our largest Desires.</p>

            <head>THE SIXTH VISION OF HELL.</head>
            <p>BEing one <hi>Autumn,</hi> at a Friend's house in the Country, (which was indeed a most delicious Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>treat) I took a walk one Moon-light into the Park; where all my past Visions came fresh into my Head again, and I was well enough pleas'd with the Medita<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion. At length, the Humour <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>ook me to leave the Path, and go further into the wood: what Impulse carry'd me to this, I know not. Whether I was mov'd by my good Angel, or some higher Power, but so it was<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> that in half a quarter of an hour, I found my self a great way from home, and in a place where 'twas no longer Night; with the Pleasantest Prospect round
<pb n="172" facs="tcp:40642:91"/>
about me that ever I saw since I was born. The Air was calm, and Tempe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rate; and it was no small Advantage to the Beauty of the Place, that it was both Innocent, and Silent. On the one hand, I was entertain'd with the Mur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>murs of Christal Rivolets; On the Other, with the whispering of the Trees; The Birds singing all the while either in Emulation, or Requital of the Other Harmonies. And now, to shew the Instability of our Affections, and Desires, I was grown weary even of Tranquillity it self, and in this most agreeable Solitude, began to long for Company.</p>
            <p>When in the very Instant, (to my great wonder) I discover'd <hi>two Paths,</hi> issuing from One, and the same Begin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing; but dividing themselves forwards, more and more, by Degrees, as if they liked not One Another's Company. That on the <hi>right Hand</hi> was <hi>Narrow,</hi> almost beyond Imagination; and being very little frequented, it was so over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>grown with <hi>Thorns</hi> and <hi>Brambles</hi>; and so stony withal, that a man had all the Trouble in the world to get into't.
<pb n="173" facs="tcp:40642:91"/>
One might see however, the Prints and Marks of several Passengers, that had rubb'd through, though with Exceed<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing Difficulty; for they had left pieces of Heads, Arms, Legs, Feet, and many of them their whole skins behind them. Some we saw yet upon the way, pres<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sing forward, without ever so much as looking back; and these were all of them <hi>Pale-faced, Lean, Thin,</hi> and <hi>Mise<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rably Mortify'd.</hi> There was no passing for <hi>Horse-men</hi>; and I was told, that <hi>St. Paul himself</hi> left his Horse, when He went into't. And indeed, there was not the footing of any Beast to be seen. Neither Horse, nor Mule; Nor the Track of any Coach, or Charret. Nor could I learn that any had past that way in the memory of man. While I was bethinking my self of what I had seen, I spy'd at length, a <hi>Beggar,</hi> that was Resting himself a little to take Breath; and I ask'd him what Inns or Lodging they had upon that Road? His Answer was that there was no stop<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ping there, till they came to their Journey's End. For This (said he) is the way to <hi>Paradise,</hi> and what should
<pb n="174" facs="tcp:40642:92"/>
they do with <hi>Inns</hi> or <hi>Taverns,</hi> where there are so <hi>few Passengers?</hi> Do not you know that in the Course of Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, to <hi>Dye,</hi> is to be <hi>Born</hi>; to <hi>Live,</hi> is to <hi>Travel</hi>; and the <hi>world</hi> is but <hi>a great Inn,</hi> after which, it is but one stage Ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther to <hi>Pain</hi> or <hi>Glory.</hi> And with these words he March'd forward, and bad me God b'w'y'; telling me withal, that it was time lost to linger in the way of Virtue, and not safe to entertain such Dialogues, as tend rather to Curiosity, then Instruction. And so he pursued his Journey, stumbling, tearing his Flesh, and Sighing, and Groning at every step; and weeping as if he thought to soften the stones with his Tears. This is no way for me, thought I to my self; and no Company Nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther; for they are a sort of <hi>Beggarly, Morose people,</hi> and will never agree with my Humour. So I drew back and strook off into the left hand way.</p>
            <p>And there I found Company Enough, and Room for more. What a world of <hi>Brave Cavaliers! Guilt Coaches, Rich Liveries,</hi> and <hi>handsome, Lively Lasses,</hi> as Glorious as the Sun! Some <hi>were
<pb n="175" facs="tcp:40642:92"/>
Singing,</hi> and <hi>Laughing</hi>; Others <hi>tick<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling One another,</hi> and <hi>Toying</hi>; Some again, at their <hi>Cheese-Cakes</hi> and <hi>China-Orenges</hi>; Or appointing a Set at <hi>Cards:</hi> so that taking all together, I durst have sworn I had been at the <hi>Park.</hi> This minded me of the Old saying, <hi>Tell me thy Company, and I'l tell thee thy Man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ners</hi>: and to save the Credit of my Education, I put my self into the <hi>Noble Mode,</hi> and Jogg'd on. And there was I at the first Dash up to the Ears, in <hi>Balls, Playes, Mascarades, Collations, Dallian<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces, Amours,</hi> and as full of Joy as my Heart could hold.</p>
            <p>It was not here, as upon t'other Rode, where folks went <hi>bare-foot,</hi> and <hi>Naked,</hi> for want of <hi>Shoo-makers,</hi> and <hi>Taylors</hi>: for here were Enow, and to spare; Beside <hi>Mercers, Drapers, Iewellers, Bodyes-ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kers, Perruque-makers, Milleners,</hi> and a <hi>French Ordinary</hi> at every other Door. You cannot imagine the Pleasure I took in my New Acquaintance; And yet there was now and then, some Justling and Disorder upon the way; Chiefly between the <hi>Physicians</hi> upon their <hi>Mules,</hi> and the <hi>Infantry</hi> of the <hi>Lawyers,</hi>
               <pb n="176" facs="tcp:40642:93"/>
that march't in great Bodies before the <hi>Iudges</hi>; and contested for Place. But the <hi>Physicians</hi> carry'd it, in favour of their <hi>Charter,</hi> which gives them <hi>Privi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lege,</hi> to <hi>Study, Practise,</hi> and <hi>Teach</hi> the <hi>Art of Poysoning</hi>; and to read <hi>Lectures</hi> of it in the <hi>Vniversities.</hi> While this point of Honour was in dispute, I per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiv'd divers crossing from one way to the Other, and changing of parties. Some of them stumbled, and Reco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver'd; Others fell down right. But the pleasantest Gambole of all, was that of the <hi>Vintners.</hi> A whole Litter of them tumbled into a Pit together, one over another, but finding they were out of their Element, they got up again as fast as they could. Those that were in the <hi>right hand way,</hi> which was the way of <hi>Paradise,</hi> or <hi>Virtue,</hi> advanc'd very hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vily, and made us Excellent sport. <hi>Prethee look what a Friday-face that fel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low makes!</hi> cryes one; <hi>Hang him, Prick-Ear'd Cur,</hi> says another; <hi>Dam' me cryes a Third, if the Rogue be not Drunk with Holy water; If the Devil h<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

<pb n="177" facs="tcp:40642:93"/>
Some of them stop't their Ears, and went on without minding us. Others we put out of Countenance, and they came over to us. And a Third sort came out of pure Love to our Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pany.</p>
            <p>After this, I observ'd a great many People a far off in a <hi>By-path</hi>: with as much <hi>Contrition,</hi> and <hi>Devotion,</hi> in their <hi>Looks,</hi> and <hi>Gestures</hi> as ever I saw in Men. They walk'd <hi>shaking their Heads,</hi> and <hi>lifting up their hands to Heaven</hi>; and they had most of them <hi>large Ears,</hi> and to my thinking <hi>Geneva-Bibles.</hi> These thought I, are a People of sin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gular Integrity, and strictness of Life, above their Fellows; but coming near<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er, we found them to be <hi>Hypocrites</hi>; and that though they'd none of <hi>our Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pany</hi> upon the <hi>Road,</hi> They would not fail to <hi>meet us</hi> at our <hi>Iourney's End. Fasting, Repentance, Prayer, Mortifica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion,</hi> and <hi>other Holy Duties,</hi> which are the <hi>Exercise</hi> of <hi>Good Christians,</hi> in Or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der to their <hi>Salvation,</hi> are but a Kind of <hi>Probation</hi> to <hi>these men,</hi> to fit them for the <hi>Devil.</hi> They were follow'd by a Number of <hi>Devotes,</hi> and <hi>Holy Sisters</hi>;
<pb n="178" facs="tcp:40642:94"/>
that Kiss't the Skirts of their Garments all the way they went, but whether out of <hi>Zeal, Spiritual,</hi> or <hi>Natural,</hi> is hard to say; and undoubtedly, <hi>some Women's Kisses</hi> are worse then <hi>Iudass<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>es.</hi> For though <hi>his Kiss</hi> was <hi>Treacherous</hi> in the <hi>Intention,</hi> it was <hi>right</hi> yet in the <hi>Appli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cation</hi>: but This was <hi>one Iudas Kissing Another,</hi> which makes me think there was more of the <hi>Flesh,</hi> then of the <hi>Spirit</hi> in the Case. Some would be drawing a Thred now and then out of the Holy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man's Garment, to make a Relique of. Others would cut out large Snips, as if they had a Mind to see them Naked<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> 
               <hi>Some again desir'd they would remember them in their Prayers; which was just as much as if they had commended them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves to the Devil by a Third Person.</hi> Some Pray'd for <hi>good Matches</hi> for their <hi>Daughters; Others,</hi> beg'd <hi>Children</hi> for <hi>themselves</hi>: And <hi>sure the Husband that allows his Wife to ask Children abroad, will be so Civil as to take them Home, when they are given him.</hi> In fine, these <hi>Hypocrites</hi> may for a while perchance impose upon the world, and Delude the Multitude; but no Mask, or Dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guise
<pb n="179" facs="tcp:40642:94"/>
is proof against the all-piercing Eye of the Almighty. There are I must confess many Religious, and Godly men, for whose Persons and Pray<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers, I have a great Esteem. But these are not of the <hi>Hypocrites</hi> Humour, to build their Hopes, and Ambition upon Popular applause, and with a Counter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feit Humility, to proclaim their Weak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness, and Unworthiness; their Failings; Yea and their Transgressions in the Market place; All which is indeed but a <hi>True Iest</hi>; for they are really what they say, though they would not be thought so.</p>
            <p>These went apart, and were look't upon to be <hi>neither Fish, nor Flesh; nor Good Red-Herring.</hi> They wore the <hi>Name</hi> of <hi>Christians</hi>; but they had nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther the <hi>wit,</hi> nor the <hi>honesty</hi> of <hi>Pagans.</hi> For they content themselves with the Pleasures of this Life, because they know no better. But the <hi>Hypocrite,</hi> that's instructed both in the <hi>Life Tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poral,</hi> and <hi>Eternal,</hi> lives without either <hi>Comfort</hi> in the <hi>One,</hi> or <hi>Hope</hi> in the <hi>Other; and takes more pains to be damn'd, then a Good Christian does to Compass his Sal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vation.</hi>
               <pb n="180" facs="tcp:40642:95"/>
In short, we went on our way in Discourses. The <hi>Rich</hi> follow'd their <hi>Wealth,</hi> and the <hi>poor</hi> the <hi>Rich</hi>; beg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ging there, what Providence had deny'd them. The <hi>Stubborn,</hi> and <hi>Obstinate</hi> went away by <hi>Themselves,</hi> for they would hear no Body that was wiser then them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves, but ran hudling on, and prest still to be foremost. The <hi>Magistrates</hi> drew after them, all the <hi>Sollicitors,</hi> and <hi>At<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turneys. Corrupt Iudges</hi> were carry'd away by <hi>Passion,</hi> and <hi>Avarice.</hi> And <hi>Vain,</hi> and <hi>Ambitious Princes,</hi> trayl'd along with them, <hi>Principalities,</hi> and <hi>Common-wealths.</hi> There were a world of <hi>Cler<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gy</hi> upon <hi>this Rode</hi> too. And I saw one <hi>full Regiment of Souldiers</hi> there, which would have been brave Fellows indeed, if they had but been half so good at <hi>Praying,</hi> and <hi>Fighting,</hi> as they were at <hi>Swearing.</hi> Their whole discourse was of their Adventures, How Narrowly they came off at such an Assault; What wounds they receiv'd upon t'other Breach; and then what a Destruction they made at such a time, of Mutton, and Poultry. But all they said, came in at one Ear, and went out at t'other.

Do' n't you remember, Sirrah, sayes one, how we claw'd it away at such a Place! Yes, ye Damn'd Rogue you, cryes t'other, when you were so drunk you took your Aunt for the Bawd. These and such as these were the Only Exploits they could truly brag of.</p>
            <p>While they were upon these Glori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous <hi>Rhodomontades,</hi> certain generous Spirits from <hi>the Right Hand way,</hi> that knew what they were, by the Boxes of <hi>Pass-ports, Testimonials,</hi> and <hi>Recommen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dations</hi> they wore at their Girdles, cry'd out to them, as if it had been to an Attacque: <hi>Fall on, Fall on, my Lads, and Follow me.

And that it is as much as his Soul is worth, to put himself, but for one Minute out of his Guard. Princes tell ye, that your Bloods, and your Lives are Theirs, and that to shed the One, and lose the Other, in their Service, is no Obligation, but a Duty. You are still however to look to the Cause; Wherefore turn head, and come along with us, and be happy.</hi> The <hi>Soul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diers</hi> heard all this with Exceeding Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tience, and Attention: But the Brand of <hi>Cowardice</hi> had such an effect upon them, that <hi>without any more ado, like men of Honour, they presently quitted the Rode; Drew; and as bold as Lyons, charg'd headlong into a Tavern.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>After this, we saw a great Troop of <hi>Women</hi> upon <hi>the High-way to Hell,</hi> with
<pb n="183" facs="tcp:40642:96"/>
their <hi>Bags</hi>; and their <hi>fellows,</hi> at their Heels, ever, and anon, hunching, and Justling one Another. On the <hi>other side</hi>; A number of <hi>Good people,</hi> that were almost at the End of their Jour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ney, came over into <hi>the wrong Rode</hi>; for the <hi>Right-hand way,</hi> growing <hi>Easier,</hi> and <hi>Wider</hi> toward the <hi>End,</hi> and that on the <hi>left hand,</hi> on the Contrary, <hi>Narrower,</hi> they thought they had been out of their way, and so came in to <hi>Vs</hi>; As many of <hi>Ours,</hi> went over to <hi>Them,</hi> upon the same Mistake. Among the Rest, I saw <hi>a great Lady,</hi> without either <hi>Coach, Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dan,</hi> or any living Creature with her, foot it all the way to <hi>Hell</hi>: which was to me so great a wonder, considering how she had liv'd in the world, that I presently look't about for a <hi>Publick Notary,</hi> to make an <hi>Entry</hi> of it. The <hi>Woman</hi> was in a most Miserable Pickle; and I did not know what design she might Drive on, under that Disguise; but finding never a <hi>Notary,</hi> or <hi>Register</hi> at hand, though I mist my Particular Aim, yet I was well Enough pleas'd with it, for I took it then for Granted that I was in my Ready way to <hi>Heaven.</hi>

But when I came afterward to reflect upon the <hi>Crosses, Afflictions</hi> and <hi>Morti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fications,</hi> that lye in the way to <hi>Para<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dise</hi>: And to Consider, that there was Nothing of That upon <hi>this Rode.</hi> But on the Contrary, <hi>Laughing, Singing, Frollicking,</hi> and all manner of <hi>Iollity</hi>: This I must confess, gave me a <hi>Qualm,</hi> and made me a little doubtful whither I was going.</p>

            <p>Going further on; I was gotten in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to a Crowd of <hi>Taylors,</hi> that stood up sneaking in a Corner, for fear of the Devils. At the first Door, there was <hi>Seven Devils,</hi> taking the Names of those that Came in: and they ask't me <hi>mine,</hi> and my <hi>Quality,</hi> and so they let me pass. But examining the <hi>Taylors; These fellows</hi> (cry'd one of the Devils) <hi>come in such shoals, as if Hell were made only for Taylors.

Certainly, said I, these folks are but in an ill Condition, when 'tis a
<pb n="187" facs="tcp:40642:98"/>
Menace for the Devils themselves to refuse to receive them: Thereupon, a Huge, <hi>over-grown, Club-footed, Crump-shoulder'd Devil,</hi> threw them all into a Deep Hole. Seeing such a Monster of a Devil, I ask't him, how He came to be so deform'd. And He told me, He had spoyl'd his Back with Carrying of <hi>Taylors:</hi> for said he, I have been formerly made use of as a Sumpter to fetch them; but now of late they save me that Labour, and come so fast of themselves, that 'tis one Devils work to dispose of them. While the word was yet speaking, there came Another Glut of them, and I was fain to make way, that the Devil might have Room to work in, who pil'd them up, and told me they made the best Fewel in Hell.</p>
            <p>I pass'd forward then into a little <hi>Dark Ally,</hi> where it made me start to hear one call me by my Name, and with much ado I perceiv'd a fellow there all wrapt up in <hi>Smoke,</hi> and <hi>Flame.</hi> Alas! Sir s<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

            <p>I was diverted from this Medita<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, by the ruful Grones, of a great many Souls that were <hi>under the Lash</hi>; and the <hi>Devil</hi> Tyrannizing over them with <hi>Whips,</hi> and <hi>Scourges.</hi> I ask't what they were; and it was told me, that there was a <hi>Plot</hi> among the <hi>Hackney-Coach-men</hi> to exhibit an <hi>Information</hi> against the <hi>Devils,</hi> for taking the <hi>Whip</hi> out of their Hands, and <hi>setting up a Trade they had never serv'd to,</hi> (which is Contrary to <hi>Quinto Elizabethae.</hi>) Well, said I: But why are they tor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mented here?

            <p>My next Adventure was into a <hi>Deep Vault,</hi> where I began immediately to <hi>shudder,</hi> and <hi>my Teeth chatter'd in my Head.</hi> I ask't the Meaning of it; and there came up to me a Devil, with <hi>Kib'd Heels,</hi> and his <hi>Toes</hi> all <hi>Mortify'd</hi>; and told me that That Quarter was alotted to the <hi>Buffons</hi> and <hi>Drolls,</hi> which are a people (says he) of so starv'd a Conceipt, and so cold a Discourse, that we are fain to Chain, and Lock them up, for fear they should spoil the Tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per of our Fire.

The <hi>other Buffons</hi> are condemn'd (quoth the De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vil) <hi>for want of Favour</hi>; and <hi>These,</hi> for having <hi>too much,</hi> and <hi>abusing</hi> it. You must know, they come upon us, still at Unawares; and yet they find all things in Readiness; the Cloth laid, and the Bed made, as if they were at home. To say the Truth, we have some sort of Kindness for them; for they save us a great deal of Trouble, in Tormenting one another.</p>

               <hi>Do you see him there?

and turn'd <hi>both</hi> into an <hi>Annuity.

And This again made me think, it might be some <hi>Iack-pudding,</hi> or <hi>Mounte-bank,</hi> shewing his Tricks, or his Attestations; with his Congregation of fools about him. But nearer hand, I found my Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stake; and that the Devils Mirth made the Gentlemen angry.

There is no Honour, but Virtue.</hi> And if your Children, though they had a Scoundrel to their Father, should come to do honourable and worthy things, we should look upon them as Persons Sacred, and not dare to Meddle with them.

of <hi>Civility,</hi> and <hi>Respect.</hi> Cavalier (quoth the Devil) if you have brought no better Plea along with you, then the Antiquity of your House, you may e'en follow your Camerade, for ought I know, for <hi>we find very few ancient Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>milies, that had not some Oppressor or Vsurper, for their Founder</hi>; and they are commonly continu'd by the same means, they were begun. How many are there of our <hi>Titular Nobility,</hi> that write <hi>Noble,</hi> purely upon the Accompt of their <hi>Violence,</hi> and <hi>Injustice</hi>? Their Subjects, and Tenants, what with Im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>positions, hard services, and Rack't Rents, are they not Worse then slaves? If they happen to have any thing Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>traordinary, as a pleasant Fruit; A Handsome Colt; a Good Cow; and that the Landlord, or his Sweet Lady take a liking to it, they must either sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mit to part with it <hi>Gratis,</hi> or else take their <hi>Pay</hi> in <hi>foul Language,</hi> or <hi>Bastina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>does.</hi> And 'tis well if they 'scape so: For many times when the sign's in <hi>Ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mini</hi>; their Wives and Daughters go to Pot, without any regard of Laws either Sacred or Prophane. What
<pb n="203" facs="tcp:40642:106"/>
Damn'd Blasphemies and Imprecations do they make use of, to get Credit with a <hi>Mistress</hi> or a <hi>Creditor,</hi> Upon a Faith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>less Promise! How intolerable is their Pride, and Insolence, even towards ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny Considerable Officers, both in Church and State! for They behave themselves as if all people below their Quality and Rank in the World, were but as so many Brutes, or Worse. As if Humane Blood were not all of a Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lour: As if Nature had not brought them into the world the Common way, or Moulded them of the same Materi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>als with the Meanest Wretches upon the Earth. And then for such as have Military Charges, and Commands; How many Great Officers are there, that without any Consideration of their Own, or Their Princes Honour, fall to spoil and Pillage? Cousening the State with false Musters, and the Soul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diers of their Pay; and giving them, instead of their Due from the Prince, a Liberty of taking what is not their due from the People; forcing them to take the Bread out of the poor La<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bourers Mouths, to fill their own Bel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lies,
<pb n="204" facs="tcp:40642:107"/>
and protecting them when they have done, in the most Execrable Out<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rages Imaginable. And when the poor Souldier comes at last to be dismist, or disbanded; Lame, Sick, Beggerly, Naked almost, and Enraged; with Nothing left him to trust to, but the high-way to keep him from starving. What Mischief is there in the world, that these men are not the Cause of? How many good Families are utterly ruin'd, and at this day in the Hospital, for trusting to their Oaths and Promises! and becoming bound for them, for vast sums of Money to maintain them in Tipple, and Whores, and in all sorts of Luxury, and Ryot? This Rhetorical Devil would have said a Thousand times more, but that his Companions call'd him off, and told him they had business elsewhere. The Cavalier hear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing that, my Friend, (said he) your Morals are very good, but yet with your Favour, all men are not alike. <hi>There's never a Barrel better Herring,</hi> (said the Devil) You are all of ye tainted with <hi>Original Sin,</hi> and if you had been any better then your fellows,
<pb n="205" facs="tcp:40642:107"/>
you had never been sent hither. But if you are indeed so Noble, as you say, you're worth the <hi>Burning,</hi> if 'twere but for your <hi>Ashes.</hi> And that you may have no Cause of Complaint, you shall see, Wee'l treat you like a person of your Condition. And in that Instant, Two Devils presented themselves; the one of them Bridled, and Sadled; and the other, doing the Office of the Squire; holding the Stirrop, with his left hand, and giving the Gentleman a Lift into the Saddle with the Other. Which was no sooner done, but away he went like an Arrow out of a Bow. I ask't the De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vil then into what Countrey he car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry'd him. And he told me, Not far: for 'twas only matter of <hi>Decorum,</hi> to send the Nobility to Hell, <hi>a Horse-back.</hi> Look on that side now, says he, and so I did; and There I saw the poor Cava<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lier in a huge Furnace, with the first Inventers of Nobility, and Arms: As <hi>Cain; Cham; Nimrod; Esau; Romulus; Tarquin; Nero; Caligula; Domitian; Heliogabalus</hi>; and <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 word">

               </gap> world of other Brave fellows, that had made themselves famous by Usurpation, and Blood. The
<pb n="206" facs="tcp:40642:108"/>
Place was a little too hot for me, and so I retir'd, meditating on what I had heard; and not a little satisfied with the Discourse of so learned a Devil. Till that time, I took the Devil for a Notorious Lyer; but I find now that He can speak the Truth too, when he pleases; and I would not for all I am worth, but have heard him Preach.</p>
            <p>When I was thus far, my Curiosity carry'd me still farther; and within Twenty Yards, I eame to a huge Mud<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy, Stinking Lake, near 'twice as big as that of <hi>Geneva</hi>; and heard in't so strange a Noise, that I was almost out of my Wits, to know what it was. They told me that the <hi>Lake</hi> was stor'd with <hi>Doüegna's,</hi> or <hi>Governantes,</hi> which are turn'd into a kind of Frogs in Hell, and perpetually Driveling, Sputtering, and Croaking. Me thought, The Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>version was apt enough; for they are Neither Fish, nor Flesh, no more then Frogs; And Only the lower Parts of them are Man's-Meat, but their Heads are Enough to turn a very good Sto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mach. I could not but Laugh, to see
<pb n="207" facs="tcp:40642:108"/>
how they Gaped, and stretch't out their Legs as they swam, and still as we came Neer, They'd Scud away and Dive.</p>
            <p>This was no place to stay in, there was so Noysome a Vapour; and so I strook off, upon the Left-Hand; where I saw a Number of old men, beating their Breasts, and Tearing their Faces; with bitter Grones, and Lamentations. It made my Heart ake to see them, and I ask't what they were: Answer was made, that I was now in The Quarter of <hi>the Fathers that damn'd themselves, to raise their Posterity</hi>; which were called by some, The Unadvised. Wretch that I am! (cry'd one of them) The great<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>est Penitent that ever liv'd, never suf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fer'd the Mortification I have endur'd; I have <hi>Watch'd</hi>; I have <hi>Fasted</hi>; I have scarce had any <hi>Clothes</hi> to my <hi>Back</hi>
               <g ref="char:punc">▪</g> My whole Life has been a Restless Course of <hi>Torment,</hi> both of <hi>Body,</hi> and <hi>Mind</hi>
               <g ref="char:punc">▪</g> and all This, to get <hi>Money</hi> for my <hi>Chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren</hi>; that I might see them <hi>well Mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry'd; Buy them Places at Court,</hi> or pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cure them some other Preferment in the World: starving my self in the Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clusion, rather then I would lessen the
<pb n="208" facs="tcp:40642:109"/>
Provision, I had made for my Posterity. And yet Notwithstanding this my fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>therly care, I was scarce sooner Dead, then forgotten: and my <hi>Next Heir</hi> bu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry'd me without <hi>Tears,</hi> or <hi>Mourning</hi>; and indeed without so much as paying of <hi>Legacies,</hi> or <hi>praying</hi> for my <hi>Soul</hi>: as if they had already received certain In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>telligence of my <hi>Damnation.</hi> And to aggravate my Sorrows, The <hi>Prodigals</hi> are now <hi>Squandering,</hi> and <hi>consuming</hi> that <hi>Estate</hi> in <hi>Gaming, Whoring,</hi> and <hi>Debauches,</hi> which I had scraped together by so much <hi>Industry, Vexation</hi> and <hi>Oppression,</hi> and for which I suffer at this Instant such <hi>Insupportable Torments.</hi> This should have been thought on before (cry'd a Devil) for sure you have heard of the Old saying. <hi>Happy is the Child whose Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther goes to the Devil.</hi> At which word, the <hi>Old Misers</hi> brake out into fresh Rage, and Lamentation, Tearing their Flesh, with Tooth and Nayl, in so ru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful a manner, that I was no longer able to endure the Spectacle.</p>
            <p>A Little further, there was a <hi>Dark, Hideous Prison,</hi> where I heard the <hi>Clat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tering</hi> of <hi>Chains</hi>; the <hi>Crackling</hi> of
<pb n="209" facs="tcp:40642:109"/>
               <hi>Flames</hi>; the <hi>Slapping</hi> of <hi>Whips</hi>; and a confused <hi>out-cry</hi> of <hi>Complaints.</hi> I ask't what Quarter this was; and they told me it was the Quarter of the <hi>Oh that I had's</hi>! What are those said I? Answer was made, that they were a Company of Brutish Sots, so absolutely deliver'd up to Vice, that they were damn'd in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sensibly, and in Hell before they were aware. They are now reflecting upon their Miscarriages, and Omissions, and perpetually crying out; <hi>Oh that I had Examin'd my Conscience! Oh that I had frequented the Sacraments! Oh that I had humbled my self with Fasting, and Prayer! Oh that I had serv'd God as I ought! Oh that I had Visited the Sick<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> and Reliev'd the Poor! Oh that I had set a Watch before the Door of my Lips!</hi>
            </p>
            <p>I left these <hi>late Repentants,</hi> (as it ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pear'd) in Exchange for worse, which were shut up in a Base Court, and the Nastiest that ever I saw. These were such as had ever in their Mouths. <hi>God is Merciful, and will pardon me.</hi> How can this be, (said I) that these people should be <hi>Damn'd?</hi> When <hi>Condemna<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion</hi>
               <pb n="210" facs="tcp:40642:110"/>
is an Act of <hi>Iustice,</hi> not of <hi>Mercy</hi>; I perceive you are simple, (quoth the Devil) for half these you see here, are condemn'd with the <hi>Mercy of God</hi> in their Mouths. And to Explain my self, Consider I pray'e, how many Sin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ners are there, that go on in their Wayes, in spight of Reproof, and Good Counsel: and still this is their Answer; <hi>God is Merciful, and will not damn a Soul for so small a Matter.</hi> But let them talk of <hi>Mercy</hi> as they please; so long as they persist in a Wicked Life, we are like to have their Company at last. By your Argument (said I) there's no trusting to <hi>Divine Mercy.</hi> You mistake me (quoth the Devil) for <hi>every good Thought, and Work, flows from that Mercy.</hi> But This I say: He that per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>severes in his Wickedness, and makes use of the Name of <hi>Mercy,</hi> only for a Countenance to his Impieties, does but Mock the Almighty, and has no Title to that <hi>Mercy.</hi> For 'tis vain to expect <hi>Mercy</hi> from above, without do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing any thing in order to it. It properly belongs to the Righteous, and the Pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nitent; and they that have the most
<pb n="211" facs="tcp:40642:110"/>
of it upon the <hi>Tongue,</hi> have commonly the least thought of it in their <hi>Hearts</hi>: And 'tis a great Aggravation of Guilt, to Sin the more, in Confidence of an Abounding Mercy. It is True that many are receiv'd to <hi>Mercy,</hi> that are utterly Unworthy of it, which is no wonder, since No man of himself can deserve it: But men are so Negligent of seeking it betimes, that they put that off, to the last, which should have been the first part of their bus'ness; and many times their Life is at End, before they begin their Repentance. I did not think so Damn'd a Doctor could have made so good a Sermon. And there I left him.</p>
            <p>I came next, to a Noysome Dark hole, and there I saw a Company of <hi>Dyers,</hi> all in <hi>Dirt,</hi> and <hi>Smoke,</hi> inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mixt with the Devils, and so alike, that it would have posed the subtlest <hi>Inqui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sitor</hi> in <hi>Spain,</hi> to have said, which were the <hi>Devils,</hi> and which the <hi>Dyers.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>There stood at my Elbow, a strange kind of <hi>Mungrel Devil,</hi> begot betwixt a <hi>Black,</hi> and a <hi>White</hi>; with a Head so bestuck with Little <hi>Horns,</hi> that it look't
<pb n="212" facs="tcp:40642:111"/>
at a Distance like a <hi>Hedg-hog.</hi> I took the Boldness to ask him, where they quarter'd the <hi>Sodomites,</hi> the <hi>Old Women</hi> and the <hi>Cuckolds.</hi> As for the <hi>Cuckolds,</hi> (said He) they are all over Hell, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out any Certain Quarter, or Station; and in Truth, 'tis no easie matter to know a <hi>Cuckold</hi> from a <hi>Devil,</hi> for (like kind Husbands) they wear their Wives favours still, and the very same Head<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pieces in Hell, that they wore living in the world. As to the <hi>Sodomites,</hi> we have no more to do with them, then needs must; but upon all Occasions, we either Fly, or Face them: for if ever we come to give them a Broad-side, 'Tis ten to one but we get a Hit betwixt Wind and Water; and yet we fence with our Tayls, as well as we can, and they get now and then a Flap o're the Mouth into the Bargain. And for the <hi>Old women,</hi> we make them stand off; for we take as little pleasure in them, as you do: And yet the Jades will be per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>secuting us with their Passions; and <hi>ye shall have a Bawd of five and fifty, do ye all the Gamboles of a Girl of fifteen.</hi> And yet after all this, <hi>There's not an old
<pb n="213" facs="tcp:40642:111"/>
Woman in Hell</hi>; for let her be <hi>as old as Pauls; Bald, Blind, Toothless, Wrinckled, Decrepit: This is not long of her Age,</hi> shee'l tell you; <hi>but a Terrible Fit of sick<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness last year, that fetch't off her Hair, and brought her so low, that she has not yet recover'd her flesh again. She lost her</hi> Eyes <hi>by a Hot Rheum: and utterly spoil'd her</hi> Teeth <hi>with Cracking of Peach-stones, and Eating of Sweet-meats, when she was a Maid.</hi> And when the Weight of her Years has almost brought both Ends together, 'Tis nothing shee'l tell ye but a Crick she has got in her Back: And <hi>though she might recover her Youth again, by confessing her Age, shee'l never acknowledge it.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>My next encounter was, a Number of People making their mone, that they had been taken away by <hi>sudden Death.</hi> That's an Impudent Lye (cry'd a De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vil) saving this Gentleman's presence) for <hi>no man dyes suddenly. Death sur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prizes no man, but gives all men sufficient warning, and Notice.</hi> I was much taken with the Devil's Civility, and Dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>course; which he pursu'd after this manner. <hi>Do ye complain</hi> (says He) <hi>of
<pb n="214" facs="tcp:40642:112"/>
sudden Death? that have carry'd Death about ye, ever since you were Born; That have been entertain'd with daily Spectacles of Carkasses and Funerals; That have heard so many Sermons upon the subject; and read so many good Books upon the Frailty of Life, and the Certainty of Death. Do ye not know that every Moment ye live, brings ye nearer to your End? Your Cloaths wear out; Your Woods, and your Houses decay; and yet ye look that your Bodies should be Immortal. What are the Common Acci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dents and Diseases of Life, but so many warnings to provide your self for a Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>move?

With what Face then can you Charge your Misfortunes upon sudden Death? that have spent your whole Life, both at Bed, and at Bord, among so many Remembrances of your Mortality.</hi> No, No; change your stile, and hereafter confess your selves to have been <hi>Care<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>less</hi> and <hi>Incredulous.

            <p>Turning toward my left Hand, I saw a great many Souls that were put up in <hi>Gally-pots,</hi> with <hi>Assa foetida, Gal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>banum,</hi> and a Company of <hi>Nasty Oyls</hi> that served them for <hi>Syrrup.</hi> What a Damn'd stink is here (Cry'd I, stopping my Nose) We are now come undoubt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>edly to <hi>the Devil's house of Office</hi>; No, No, (said their Tormenter) which was a kind of a Yellowish Complexion'd Devil) 'Tis a Confection of <hi>Apothecaries.

Ye know that <hi>Scaevola,</hi> when he found his Mistake, in killing <hi>Another,</hi> for <hi>Porsenna</hi> (the <hi>Secretary,</hi> for the <hi>Prince</hi>) burn't his <hi>Right-Hand</hi> in Revenge of the Miscarriage: Now the severity of the Vengeance, was not so much the Maiming or the Cripling of Himself, but the Condemning of himself to be for ever <hi>Left-handed.</hi> And so 'tis with a Malefactor that suffers Justice; The Shame, and Punishment, does not lye so much in the Loss of his <hi>Right-Hand,</hi> as that the other is <hi>Left.</hi> And it was the Curse of an old Bawd, to a fellow that had vex'd her, <hi>That He might go to the Devil by the stroke of a Left-handed Man.</hi> If the Poets speak Truth, (as 'twere a Wonder if they should not) The <hi>Left</hi> is the <hi>Vnlucky side</hi>; and there
<pb n="220" facs="tcp:40642:115"/>
never came any Good from it.

            <p>Hereupon, a Devil becken'd me to come softly to him; and so I did, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out a word speaking or the least Noise in the World. Now (says he) if you'l see the Daily Exercise of <hi>Ill-favour'd Women,</hi> look through that <hi>Lattice-Win<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dow.</hi> And there I saw such a Kennel of <hi>Vgly Bitches,</hi> you would have blest your self.

<pb n="221" facs="tcp:40642:115"/>
by the Roots,</hi> like Mad: And some that had none to tear, were fetch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing out of their <hi>black Boxes,</hi> such as they could get, or make. Others were <hi>powd'ring,</hi> and <hi>curling</hi> their <hi>false Locks</hi>; or fast'ning their <hi>new Ivory Teeth,</hi> in the place of their <hi>old Ebony Ones.</hi> Some were <hi>Chewing Lemon-pill,</hi> or <hi>Cinamon,</hi> to countenance <hi>a foul Breath</hi>; And rai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sing themselves upon their <hi>Ciopines,</hi> that their View might be the fairer, and their fall the Deeper. Others were quarrelling with their <hi>Looking-Glasses,</hi> for shewing them such <hi>Hags-faces</hi>: and cursing <hi>the state of Venice</hi> for Enter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taining no Better <hi>workmen.</hi> Some were <hi>stuffing</hi> out their <hi>Bodies,</hi> like <hi>Pack-sad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dles,</hi> to cover secret Deformities: And some again had so many Hoods over their faces, to conceal the Ruines, that I could hardly discern what they were; And These past for <hi>Penitents.</hi> Others, with their pots of <hi>Hogs Grease,</hi> and <hi>Po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>matum,</hi> were <hi>sleeking,</hi> and <hi>polishing</hi> their faces, and indeed their <hi>fore-heads</hi> were <hi>bright,</hi> and <hi>shining,</hi> though there were neither <hi>Suns,</hi> nor <hi>Stars</hi> in <hi>That Firma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment:</hi> Some there were (in Fine) that

would have fetch't a man's Guts up at's mouth, to see them with their <hi>Masques of After-Births</hi>; and with their <hi>Men<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>struous Slibber Slobbers,</hi> dawbing one another to take away the <hi>Heats,</hi> and <hi>Bubos.</hi> Nasty and Abominable! I cry'd. Well (quoth the Devil) you see now how far a Woman's Wit, and Invention will carry her to her own Destruction. I could not speak one word for Asto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nishment at so horrid a spectacle; till I had a little recollected my self: and then (said I) If I may deal freely with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out Offence; I dare Defy all the De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vils in Hell, to out-do these Women. But pray'e let's be gone, for the sight of them, makes my very Heart ake.</p>
            <p>Turn about then, (said the Devil) and there was <hi>a fellow</hi> sitting in a <hi>Chair, all alone</hi>; never a <hi>Devil</hi> near him; No <hi>Fire,</hi> or <hi>Frost</hi>; No <hi>Heat,</hi> or <hi>Cold</hi>; or any thing else; that I could perceive, to torment him; and yet crying and Roar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing out the most hideously of any thing I had yet heard in Hell: Tearing his Flesh; and Beating his Body, like a Bedlam; and his Heart, all the while, Bleeding at his Eyes. Good Lord,
<pb n="223" facs="tcp:40642:116"/>
thought I, what ails this Wretch, to yell out thus when no Body Hurts him<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> So I went up to Him; Friend (said I) what's the meaning of all this Fury, and Transport? for, so far as I can see, there's nothing to trouble you. <hi>No, No,</hi> (says he with a Horrid Out-cry, and with all the Extravagances of a Man in Rage, and Despair) <hi>you do not see my Tormentors; but the all-searching Eye of the Almighty, sees my Pains, as well as my Transgressions; and with a severe, and Implacable Iustice, has condemn'd me to suffer Punishments answerable to my Crimes.</hi> (Which Words He utter'd with redoubled Clamours) <hi>My Exe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cutioners are in my Soul, and all the Plagues of Hell in my Conscience. My</hi> Memory <hi>serves me instead of a Cruel Devil. The</hi> Remembrance <hi>of the Good I should have done, and Omitted; And of the Ill, I should not have done, and did. The</hi> Remembrance <hi>of the wholesome Counsels I have rejected, and of the Ill example I have given. And for the Ag<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gravation of my Misery; where my</hi> Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mory <hi>leaves afflicting me, my</hi> Under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>standing <hi>begins: shewing me the Glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries,
<pb n="224" facs="tcp:40642:117"/>
and Beatitudes I have lost, which others enjoy, who have gain'd Heaven, with less Anxiety, and Pain then I have endur'd, to compass my Damnation. Now am I perpetually meditating on the Comforts, Beauties, Felicities, and Rap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures of Paradise, only to enflame, and exasperate my Despair in Hell: begging in Vain, but for one moments Interval of Ease, without obtaining any; for my</hi> Will <hi>is also as Inexorable, as either my</hi> Memory, <hi>or my</hi> Understanding. <hi>And These</hi> (my Friend of the other world) <hi>are the Three Faculties of my Soul, which Divine Iustice, for my Sins, has conver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted into three Tormentors, that Torture me without Noise; Into Three Flames, that burn me without consuming. And if I chance at any time to have the least Remission, or Respite; The Worm of my Conscience gnaws my Soul, and finds it, to an Insatiable Hunger, an Immortal Aliment, and Entertainment.</hi> At that word, turning towards me with a Hel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lish Yell; <hi>Mortal</hi> (says he) <hi>learn, and be assur'd from me, that all those that either bury or misemploy their Talents, <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

Damn'd even above ground</hi>; and so He return'd to his Usual Clamours. Upon this, I left him, miserably sad and pen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sive. Well, thought I, what a weight of sin lyes upon this Creatures Conscience! Whereupon the Devil observing me in a Muse, told me in my Ear, that this Fellow had been an <hi>Atheist,</hi> and believ'd neither <hi>God,</hi> nor <hi>Devil. Deliver me</hi> then, said I, <hi>from that Vnsanctify'd Wis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom, that serves us only for our fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther Condemnation.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>I was gone but a step or two aside, and I saw a world of people running after <hi>Burning Chariots,</hi> with a great ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny Souls in them, and the Devils tear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing them with Pincers: and before them, march't Certain Officers, making <hi>Proclamation</hi> of their <hi>Sentence,</hi> which with much ado I got near enough to hear, and it was to this effect. <hi>Divine Iustice hath appointed this Punishment to the Scandalous, for giving Ill Examples to their Neighbours.</hi> And at the same time, several of the Damn'd laid their sins to their Charge, and cry'd out, that <hi>'twas long of Them they were thus Tor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mented.</hi> So that <hi>the Scandalous were
<pb n="226" facs="tcp:40642:118"/>
punish't both for their own Sins, and for the Offences of those they had misled to their Destruction.</hi> And these are they of whom 'tis said, that <hi>They had better ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver have been born.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>My very Soul was full of Anguish, to see so many Doleful Spectacles; and yet I could not but smile, to see the <hi>Vintners</hi> every where up and down Hell, as free, as if they had been in their <hi>Taverns,</hi> and only <hi>Pris'ners upon Parole.</hi> I ask't how they came by that Privilege; and a Devil told me, there was no need of shackling them, or so much as shutting them up; for there was no fear of their making a 'scape, that took so much pains in the World, and made it their whole Business to come thither. Only, says he; if we can keep them from throwing <hi>Water</hi> in the <hi>Fire,</hi> as they do in their <hi>Wines,</hi> we are well Enough. But if you would see somewhat worth the while, leave these fellows, and follow me; and I'le shew ye <hi>Iudas</hi> and his <hi>Brethren,</hi> the <hi>Stew<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ards,</hi> and <hi>Purse-bearers</hi>: so I did as he bad me, and he brought me to <hi>Iudas,</hi> and <hi>his Companions,</hi> who had <hi>no Faces,</hi>
               <pb n="227" facs="tcp:40642:118"/>
divers of them, and most of them <hi>no Foreheads.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>I was well enough pleas'd to see him, and to be better inform'd; for I had ever Phansy'd him to be a kind of <hi>an Olive-colour'd Tawny Complexion'd fel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low,</hi> without a <hi>Beard</hi>; and an <hi>Eunuch</hi> into the Bargain: which perhaps (nay probably) He was; for nothing but a <hi>Capon, a Thing un-man'd,</hi> could ever have been guilty of so sordid, and Treacherous a Villany, as to sell, and betray his Master, with a Kiss; and af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter That, so Cowardly, as to hang him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>self in Despair, when he had done. I do believe, however, what the Church says of him: That He had a <hi>Carrot Beard,</hi> and a <hi>Red Head;</hi> but it may be his <hi>Beard</hi> was <hi>burn't,</hi> and as he ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pear'd to me in Hell, I could not but take him for an <hi>Eunuch,</hi> which to deal freely, is my Opinion of all the <hi>De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vils,</hi> for they have no Hair; and they are for the most pa<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>Iudas</hi> was beset with a Great many <hi>Money-Mongers,</hi> and <hi>Purse-bearers,</hi> that were telling him stories of the pranks
<pb n="228" facs="tcp:40642:119"/>
they had play'd, and the Tricks they had put upon their Masters, after his Example. Coming up to them, I per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiv'd that their Punishment was like that of <hi>Titius,</hi> who had a <hi>Vultur</hi> con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinually gnawing upon his <hi>Liver</hi>; for there were a Number of <hi>Ravenous Birds</hi> perpetually preying upon them, and tearing off their Flesh; which grew again as fast as they devour'd it; a De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vil in the mean time crying out, and the Damn'd filling the whole place with Clamour and Horrour; <hi>Iudas,</hi> with his <hi>Purse,</hi> and his <hi>Pot</hi> by his side, bearing a large part in the <hi>Out-cry,</hi> and <hi>Torment.</hi> I had a huge mind (me thought,) to have a word or two with <hi>Iudas</hi>; and so I went to him with this Greeting: <hi>Thou Perfidious, Impudent, Impious Traytor,</hi> (said I) <hi>to sell thy Lord and Master at so base a Price, like an Avarici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous Rascal.</hi> If men, (said he) were not ungrateful, they would rather pity, or Commend me, for an Action so much to their Advantage, and done in Order to their Redemption. The Misery is Mine that am to have no part my self, in the Benefit I have procured to others.
<pb n="229" facs="tcp:40642:119"/>
Some <hi>Heretiques</hi> there are, (I must con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fess to my Comfort) that adore me for't. But do you take <hi>me</hi> for the <hi>only Iudas?</hi> No, No. There have been many since the Death of my Master, and there are at this Day, more wicked, and ungrateful, Ten thousand times then my self; that <hi>buy</hi> the Lord of Life, as well as <hi>sell him,</hi> scourging and Cru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cifying him daily with more Spite, and Ignominy then the <hi>Iews.</hi> The Truth is, I had an Itch to be fingering of Money, and Bartering, from my Entrance into the <hi>Apostleship.</hi> I began, you know, with <hi>the Pot of Oyntment,</hi> which I would fain have sold, under colour of a <hi>Relief</hi> to the <hi>Poor.</hi> And I went on<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> to <hi>the selling of my Master,</hi> wherein I did the World a greater good then I in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tended, to my own irreparable ruine. My <hi>Repentance,</hi> now signifies Nothing. To conclude, <hi>I am the only Steward that's condemn'd for</hi> Selling; <hi>All the rest are damn'd for</hi> Buying: And I must entreat you, to have a better Opinion of me; for if you'l look but a little lower here, you'l find people a Thou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sand times worse then my self. With<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>draw
<pb n="230" facs="tcp:40642:120"/>
draw then (said I) for I have had talk enough with <hi>Iudas.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>I went down then, some few steps, as <hi>Iudas</hi> directed me; and There, I saw a world of Devils upon the March, with <hi>Rods,</hi> and <hi>Stirrup-leathers</hi> in their Hands, lashing a Company of <hi>handsome Lasses, stark naked,</hi> and driving them out of Hell (which me thought was pity, and if I had had some of them in a Corner, I should have treated them better) With the <hi>Stirrup-Leathers,</hi> they disciplin'd <hi>a Litter of Bawds.</hi> I could not Imagine why These; of all others, should be expell'd the place, and ask't the Question. Oh, says a Devil, <hi>These</hi> are our <hi>Factresses</hi> in the <hi>world,</hi> and the best we have, so that we send them back again to bring more Grist to the Mill: And indeed, <hi>if it were not for Women, Hell would be but thinly peopled</hi>; for what with the <hi>Art,</hi> the <hi>Beauty,</hi> and the <hi>Allurements</hi> of the <hi>Young Wenches</hi>; and the <hi>Sage Advice</hi> and <hi>Counsel</hi> of the <hi>Bawds,</hi> they do us very great services. Nay; for fear any of our Good Friends should tire upon the Rode, they send them to us on <hi>Horse-back,</hi> or bring
<pb n="233" facs="tcp:40642:120"/>
them themselves, e'en to the very Gates, lest they should miss their way.</p>
            <p>Pursuing my journey, I saw, a good way before me, a large Building, that lookt (me thought) like some <hi>Enchant<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed Castle,</hi> or the <hi>Picture of Ill-Luck:</hi> It was all ruinous, the <hi>Chimneys</hi> down, the <hi>Planchers</hi> all to pieces, only the <hi>Bars</hi> of the <hi>Windows</hi> standing: The <hi>Doors</hi> all bedaw'd with dirt, and patcht up with <hi>Barrel-Heads,</hi> where they had been broken. The <hi>Glass</hi> gone, and here and there a <hi>Quarrel</hi> supply'd with <hi>Paper.</hi> I made no doubt at first but the house was forsaken; but coming nearer, I found it otherwise, by a horrible confusion of tongues and noises within it. As I came just up to the Door; one open'd it, and I saw in the house many <hi>Devils, Thieves,</hi> and <hi>Whores.</hi> One of the craftiest Jades in the Pack, placed her self presently upon the Threshold, and made her address to my Guide and me. Gentle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men, says she, <hi>how comes it to pass, I pray'e, that people are damn'd both for giving and taking?</hi> The <hi>Thief</hi> is con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demn'd for <hi>taking</hi> away from another; and <hi>we</hi> are condemn'd for <hi>giving</hi> what
<pb facs="tcp:40642:121"/>
is our own. I do not find, truly, any injustice in our Trade; and if it be lawful to give every one their own, and out of their own; why are we con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demn'd? We found it a nice point, and sent the Wench to <hi>Counsel learned in the Law,</hi> for a resolution in the Case. Her mentioning of <hi>Thieves</hi> made me inquire after the <hi>Scriveners</hi> and <hi>Notaries.</hi> Is it possible (said I) that you should have none of them here? for I do not re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>member that I have seen so much as one of them upon the way; and yet I had occasion for a <hi>Scrivener,</hi> and made a search for one. I do believe indeed (quoth the Devil) that you have not found any of them upon the Road. How then? (said I) what, are they all sav'd? No, no (cry'd the Devil) but you must understand, that they do not <hi>foot it</hi> hither, as other mortals; but come upon the <hi>Wing,</hi> in Troops like <hi>Wild-geese</hi>; so that 'tis no wonder you see none of them upon the way. We have <hi>millions</hi> of them, but they cut it away in a trice, for they are damn'dly <hi>rank-wing'd,</hi> and will make a flight, in the third part of a minute, betwixt
<pb n="233" facs="tcp:40642:121"/>
               <hi>Earth</hi> and <hi>Hell.</hi> But if there be so ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny (said I) how comes it we see none of them? For that (quoth the Devil) we change their names, when they come hither once, and call them no longer <hi>Notaries or Scriveners,</hi> but <hi>Cats</hi>: and they are so good <hi>mousers,</hi> that though this place is large, old, and ruinous; yet you see not so much as a <hi>Rat</hi> or a <hi>mouse</hi> in <hi>Hell</hi>: how full soever of all other sorts of <hi>Vermine.</hi> Now ye talk of <hi>Ver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mine</hi> (said I) are there any <hi>Catchpoles</hi> here? No not one (says he.) How so (quoth I?) when I dare undertake there are five hundred Rogues of the Trade for one that's ought. The Rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son is (says the Devil) that every <hi>Catch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pole</hi> upon <hi>Earth,</hi> carries a <hi>Hell</hi> in's <hi>Bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>som.</hi> You have still (said I, crossing my self) an aking tooth at those poor Var<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lets. Why not (cry'd he) for they are but Devils incarnate, and so damn'dly verst in the art of tormenting, that we live in continual dread of losing our pla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces, and that his Infernal Majesty should take these Rascals into his Service.</p>
            <p>I had enough of this, and travelling on, I saw a little way off, a great enclo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sure,
<pb n="234" facs="tcp:40642:122"/>
and a world of Souls shut up in't; some of them weeping and lamenting without measure, others in a profound silence. And this I understood to be the <hi>Lovers Quarter.</hi> It sadn'd me to consider, that Death it self could not kill the lamentations of Lovers. Some of them were discoursing their passions, and teizing themselves with <hi>fears</hi> and <hi>jelousies</hi>; casting all their miseries up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on their <hi>appetites</hi> and <hi>phansies,</hi> that still made the <hi>Picture</hi> infinitely fairer than the <hi>Person.</hi> They were for the most part troubled with a simple disease, call'd (as the Devil told me) <hi>I Thought.</hi> I askt him what that was, and he an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>swer'd me, it was a Punishment suita<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble to their Offence: for your Lovers, when they fall short of their Expecta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions, either in the pursuit, or enjoy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of their Mistresses, they are wont to say, Alas! <hi>I Thought</hi> she would have lov'd me: <hi>I Thought</hi> she would never have prest me to marry her: <hi>I Thought</hi> she would have been a Fortune to me: <hi>I Thought</hi> she would have given me all she had: <hi>I Thought</hi> she would have cost me nothing: <hi>I Thought</hi> she would have

askt me nothing: <hi>I Thought</hi> she would have been true to my Bed: <hi>I Thought</hi> she would have bin dutiful and modest: <hi>I Thought</hi> she would never have kept her Gallant. So that all their Pain and damnation comes from <hi>I thought</hi> This or That, or So, or So.</p>
            <p>In the middle of them was <hi>Cupid,</hi> a little beggarly Rogue, and as naked as he was born, only here and there co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver'd with an odd kind of <hi>Embroidery</hi>; but whether it was the workmanship of the <hi>Itch, Pox,</hi> or <hi>Measles,</hi> I could not perfectly discover; and <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

How now (said I?) have ye your Quirks and Conceipts in Hell? In troth ye are pleasant: I thought your edge had been taken off. With that, out stept the most miserable Wretch of the whole Company laden with Irons: Ah!

When you die, your Estate goes to your Children; and for their parts, you are scarce cold, before you are forgotten. You are not to expect they should bestow much upon Works of Charity; for if nothing went that

            <p>From thence, I went to the <hi>Witches</hi> and <hi>Wizards</hi>; such as pretend to cure Man and Beast by <hi>Charms, Words, A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mulets, Characters:</hi> and These were all burning alive. These (says a Devil) are a Company of Cousening Rogues; the most accursed Villains in Nature. If they help one man, they kill another, and only remove the Disease from a <hi>worse</hi> to a <hi>Better:</hi> And yet there's no great Clamour against them neither; for if the Patient recover, hee's well enough content, and the Doctor Gets both Reputation and Reward for his Pains. If He dyes, his mouth is stop't, and forty to one the next Heir does him a good turn for the Dispatch. So that, <hi>Hit,</hi> or <hi>Miss</hi>; All is well at last. If you enter into a Debate with them about their Remedies, They'll tell you, <hi>they learn't the Mystery of a certain Iew</hi>; and

There's the <hi>Original</hi> of the <hi>Secret.</hi> Now to hear these <hi>Quacks</hi> give you the History of their Cures, is beyond all the <hi>Playes</hi> and <hi>Farces</hi> in the World.

As <hi>Haly, Gerard, Bart'lemew</hi> of <hi>Parma,</hi> and one <hi>Toudin</hi>; a familiar Friend, and Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>panion of the Great <hi>Cornelius Agrippa,</hi> the famous <hi>Conjurer</hi>: who though he had but <hi>one Soul,</hi> was yet burning in <hi>four Bodies.</hi> (I mean the <hi>four Damnable

Books</hi> he left behind him.) There was <hi>Trithemius</hi> too, with his <hi>Polygraphy,</hi> and <hi>Stenography</hi>: that had Devils now, his <hi>Belly full,</hi> though in his Life time his Complaint was, that He could never have enough of their Company: Over against him was <hi>Cardan</hi>; but they could not set their horses together, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause of an old Quarrel; whether was the more Impudent of the Two. And there I saw <hi>Misaldus,</hi> tearing his Beard, in Rage, to find himself Pumpt dry; and that he could not fool on, to the End of the Chapter. <hi>Theophrastus</hi> was there too, bewailing himself for the Time he had spent at the <hi>Alchymists Bellows.</hi> There was also the Unknown Author of <hi>Clavicula Solomonis,</hi> and <hi>The Hundred Kings of Spirits</hi>; with the Composer of the Book, <hi>Adversus Omnia pericula Mundi. Taysnerus</hi> too, with his Book of <hi>Physiognomy,</hi> and <hi>Chi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>romancy</hi>; and He was doubly punish't, first for the <hi>Fool</hi> he <hi>was</hi>; and then for <hi>those</hi> he had <hi>made</hi>

but a very uncertain aim. There were <hi>Magicians, Necromancers, Sorcerers,</hi> and <hi>Enchanters</hi> innumerable, beside divers <hi>private Boxes</hi> that were kept for Lords and Ladies; and other Personages of great quality, that put their trust in these Disciples of the Devil, and go to <hi>Strand-Bridge</hi> or <hi>Billeter-Lane,</hi> for reso<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lution in cases of <hi>Death, Love,</hi> or <hi>Mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riage,</hi> and now and then to recover a <hi>Gold Watch</hi> or a <hi>Pearl Neck-lace.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Not far from these, were a company of <hi>handsome Women,</hi> that were tor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mented in the quality of <hi>Witches</hi>; which griev'd my very heart to see it: but to comfort me, What? (says a De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vil) Have you so soon forgot the rogue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry of these Carrions? Have you not had tryal enough yet of them? they are the very poyson of life, and the on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly dangerous <hi>Magicians</hi> that corrupt all our senses, and disturb the faculties of your soul; these are they that cousen your <hi>Eyes</hi> with <hi>false appearances,</hi> and set up your <hi>wills</hi> in opposition to your <hi>Vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derstanding</hi> and <hi>Reason.</hi> 'Tis right, said I, and now you mind me of it, I do very well remember, that I have found
<pb n="252" facs="tcp:40642:131"/>
them so; but let's go on and see the rest.</p>
            <p>I was scarce gone three steps further, but I was got into so hideous a dark place, that it was e'en a mercy we knew where we were. There was first at the entrance, <hi>Divine Iustice,</hi> which was most dreadful to behold; and a little beyond stood <hi>Vice,</hi> with a countenance of the highest pride and insolence ima<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginable: There was <hi>Ingratitude, Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lice, Ignorance, obstinate</hi> and <hi>incorrigi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble Infidelity, brutish</hi> and <hi>head-strong Dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>obedience, rash</hi> and <hi>imperious Blasphemy,</hi> with Garments dipt in <hi>bloud, Eyes spark<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling,</hi> and a <hi>hundred pair of Chops, barking at Providence, and vomiting rage and poyson.</hi> I went in (I confess) with fear and trembling) and there I saw all the Sects of <hi>Idolaters</hi> and <hi>Hereticks,</hi> that ever yet appeared upon the stage of the Universe: And at their feet, in a glori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous array, was lascivious <hi>Barbara, second Wife</hi> to the Emperor <hi>Sigismund,</hi> and <hi>the Queen of Harlots:</hi> One that agreed with <hi>Messalina</hi> in This, <hi>that Virginity</hi> was both a <hi>burden</hi> and a <hi>folly</hi>; and that in her whole life she was never either
<pb n="253" facs="tcp:40642:131"/>
               <hi>wearied</hi> or <hi>satisfy'd</hi>; but herein she went beyond her; in that she held the <hi>mortality</hi> as well of the <hi>Soul</hi> as of the <hi>Body</hi>; but she was now better instru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cted, and burnt like a bundle of <hi>Matches.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Passing forward still, I spy'd a fellow in a corner, all alone, with the flames about his ears, gnashing his teeth, and <hi>blaspheming</hi> through <hi>fury</hi> and <hi>despair.</hi> I askt him what he was, and he told me he was <hi>Mahomet.</hi> Why then (said I) thou art the damn'dest Reprobate in Hell, and hast brought more Wretches hither than half the World beside: and <hi>Lucifer</hi> has done well to allot thee a Quarter here by thy self, for certainly thou hast well deserv'd the first place in his Dominions. But since every man chuses to talk of what he loves, I prethee good <hi>Imposter</hi> tell me, What's the reason that thou hast forbidden <hi>Wine</hi> to all thy <hi>Disciples?</hi> Oh (says he) I have made them so drunk with my <hi>Alchoran</hi> they need no <hi>Tipple.</hi> But why hast thou forbidden them <hi>Swines-flesh</hi> too (said I?) because (says he) I would not affront the <hi>Iambon</hi>; for <hi>Water</hi> up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
<pb n="254" facs="tcp:40642:132"/>
               <hi>Gammon,</hi> would be <hi>false Heraldry.</hi> And beside I never lov'd my people well enough to afford them the plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sure, either of the <hi>Grape</hi> or the <hi>Spare-Rib.</hi> Nay, and for fear they should chance to grope out the way to Heaven, I have establisht my power and my Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minion by force of Arms; without subjecting my Laws to idle disputes and discourses of reason. Indeed there is lit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle of <hi>Reason</hi> in my <hi>Precepts,</hi> and I would have as little in their <hi>obedience.</hi> A world of Disciples I have, but I think they follow me more out of <hi>appetite</hi> than <hi>Religion,</hi> or for the <hi>miracles I work.</hi> I allow them <hi>Liberty of Conscience</hi>; they have as many Women as they please, and do what they list, provided they meddle not with the Government. But look about ye now, and you'l find that there are more Knaves than <hi>Mahomet.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>I did so, and found my self presently surrounded with a Ring of <hi>Hereticks,</hi> and <hi>their Adherents</hi>; many of which were ready to tear out the Throats of their <hi>Leaders.</hi> One among the rest was beset with a brace of Devils, and either of them a pair of Bellows, puffing into
<pb n="255" facs="tcp:40642:132"/>
each ear <hi>Fire</hi> instead of <hi>Air,</hi> which made him a little <hi>hot-headed.</hi> There was ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, that; as I was told, was a kind of a <hi>Symoniac,</hi> and had taken up his seat in a <hi>Pestilential Chair</hi>; but it was so dark I could not well discern whether it was a <hi>Pope</hi> or a <hi>Presbyter.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>By this time I had enough of Hell, and began to wish my self out again; but as I was looking about for a Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>treat, I stumbled upon a <hi>Long Gallery</hi> before I was aware: and there I saw <hi>Lucifer</hi> himself with all his <hi>Nobility</hi> a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout him, <hi>male</hi> and <hi>female.</hi> (For let <hi>marry'd men</hi> say their pleasure, there are <hi>she-Devils</hi> too) I should have been at a damn'd loss what to do, or how to be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>have my self among so many strange faces, if one of the <hi>Vshers</hi> had not come to me, and told me, that being a stranger, it was his Majesties pleasure, I should enter and have free liberty of seeing what was there to be seen. We exchang'd a couple or two of Comple<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments, and then I began to look about me, but never did I see a Palace so fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nisht, nor indeed comparable to it.</p>
            <p>Our Furniture at the best is but a
<pb n="256" facs="tcp:40642:133"/>
choice collection of <hi>dead</hi> and <hi>dumb Sta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tues,</hi> or <hi>paintings</hi> without <hi>life, sense,</hi> or <hi>motion</hi>: But <hi>there,</hi> all the pieces were <hi>animated,</hi> and no trash in the whole Inventory. There was hardly any thing to be seen, but <hi>Emperors</hi> and <hi>Princes,</hi> with some few (perhaps) of their choicest Nobility and <hi>Privados.</hi> The first <hi>Banque</hi> was taken up by the <hi>Otto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man Family</hi>; and after them sate the <hi>Roman Emperors,</hi> in their order; and the <hi>Roman Kings</hi> down to <hi>Tarquin the proud</hi>; beside <hi>Highnesses</hi> and <hi>Graces, Lords Spiritual</hi> and <hi>Temporal</hi> innumera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble. My <hi>Lungs</hi> began now to call for a little <hi>fresh air,</hi> and I desired my Guide to shew me the way out again. Yes, yes, with all my heart (says he) follow me then: And so he carry'd me away by a <hi>back passage</hi> into <hi>Lucifer's House of Of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fice,</hi> where there was I know not how many Tun of <hi>Sr</hi> 
               <hi>Reverence,</hi> and Bales of <hi>flattering Panegyricks,</hi> not to be num<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber'd; all of them <hi>Licens'd,</hi> and <hi>En<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter'd according to Order.</hi> I could not but smile at this provision of <hi>Tail-Tim<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber,</hi> and my Guide took notice of it; who was a good kind of a <hi>damn'd Droll.</hi> But
<pb n="257" facs="tcp:40642:133"/>
I call'd still to be gone, and at length he led me to a little hole like the vent of a Vault, and I crept through it as nimbly as if the Devil himself had gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven me a lift at the Crupper; when to my great wonder, I found my self in the <hi>Park</hi> again, where I begun my story: not without an odd medly of Passions, partly reflecting upon what others en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dur'd, and in part, upon my own con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dition of ease and happiness, that had deserv'd, perhaps, the contrary as well as they. This thought put me upon a resolution of leading such a course of life, for the future, that I might not come to <hi>feel</hi> these torments in <hi>Reality,</hi> which I had now only seen in <hi>Vision.</hi>

            <p>And I must here entreat the Reader to follow my example, without making any further experiment; and likewise not to cast an <hi>ill construction</hi> upon a <hi>fair meaning.</hi> My design is to discredit, and discountenance the works of darkness, without scandalizing of Persons; and since I speak only of the <hi>damn'd,</hi> I'm sure no honest man alive will reckon this discourse a Satyre.</p>

            <p>THere happen'd lately so terrible an <hi>Vproar,</hi> and <hi>Disorder</hi> in <hi>Hell,</hi> that (though it be a place of perpetual <hi>Outrage,</hi> and <hi>Confusion</hi>) the oldest Devil there never knew the Fel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low of it; and the Inhabitants expected nothing less then an absolute <hi>Topsy-Turvy,</hi> and <hi>Dissolution of their Empire.</hi> The <hi>Devils</hi> fell upon the <hi>Damn'd</hi>; and the <hi>Damn'd</hi> fell upon the <hi>Devils,</hi> with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out knowing One from t'other: and all running <hi>helter-skelter,</hi> to and again, like Mad; for in fine, it was no other then a general <hi>Revolt.</hi> This <hi>Hurly-Burly</hi> lasted a good while, before any Mor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tal could imagine the meaning of it; but at length, there came certain Intel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligence of a <hi>Monstrous Talker</hi>; A <hi>Prag<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>matical,
<pb n="259" facs="tcp:40642:134"/>
Medling Vndertaker,</hi> and an <hi>old Bawd</hi> of a <hi>Gouvernante,</hi> that had knock't off their Shackles, and made all this Havock: <hi>Which may give the Reader to Vnderstand what kind of Cat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tel These are, that could make Hell it self more Dangerous, and Vnquiet.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>Lucifer,</hi> in the Mean time, went <hi>Yelp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing</hi> up and down, and <hi>Bawling,</hi> for <hi>Chains, Hand-Cuffes, Bolts, Manacles, Shackles, Fetters,</hi> to tye up his Pris'ners again; when, in the Middle of his <hi>Car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riere, He</hi> and the <hi>Babler,</hi> or <hi>Talker,</hi> I told ye of, met <hi>full-butt</hi>; and after a little staring one Another in the Face, upon the Encounter, the <hi>Babler</hi> open'd. Prince mine; (says he) you have a pack of <hi>Lazy, Droning Devils</hi> in your <hi>Domi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nions,</hi> that look after Nothing, but sit with their Arms and Legs across, and leave all your affairs at <hi>Six and Seven,</hi> And you have divers abroad too, upon <hi>Commission,</hi> that have staid out their Time, and yet give you no Accompt of their Employment. The <hi>Gouvernante,</hi> that had been blowing the <hi>Coal,</hi> and Whispering <hi>Sedition</hi> from one to ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, chanc'd to pass by in the <hi>Interim</hi>

               <pb n="260" facs="tcp:40642:135"/>
and stopping short, address'd her self to <hi>Lucifer</hi>: Look to your self; (she cry'd) there is a <hi>Desperate plot</hi> upon your <hi>Dia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bolical Crown,</hi> and <hi>Dignity.</hi> There are <hi>Two Tyrants</hi> in't; <hi>Three Parasites</hi>; A world of <hi>Physicians,</hi> and whole <hi>Legions</hi> of <hi>Lawyers,</hi> and <hi>Atturneys.</hi> One word more in your Ear. There is among them, a <hi>mungrel Priest</hi> (a kind of a <hi>Lay-Elder</hi>) that will go near to sit upon your Skirts, if you have not a care of him.</p>
            <p>At the very name of <hi>Priest,</hi> and <hi>Lay-Elder, Lucifer</hi> look't as Pale as Death; stood stone-still; as mute as a Fish; and in his very looks, discover'd his Ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prehensions. After a little pause, he rous'd himself, as out of a Trance; A <hi>Priest</hi> do ye say? a <hi>Lay-Elder? Ty<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rants? Lawyers? Physicians?</hi> A Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>position (he cryes) to poyson all the Devils in Hell, and purge their very Guts out. With that, away he went to visit the <hi>Avenues,</hi> and set his <hi>Guards,</hi> and who should he meet next, but the <hi>Medler</hi>? in a monstrous hast, and hurry. Nay then (says he) here is <hi>the Fore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>runner of Ill-Luck.</hi> But <hi>what's the Mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter?</hi>
               <pb n="261" facs="tcp:40642:135"/>
The Matter? cry'd the <hi>Medler</hi>; And then with a huge deal of tedious, and Impertinent Circumstance, he up, and told him, that a great many of the <hi>Damn'd</hi> had Contriv'd an <hi>Escape</hi>; and that there was a Design to call in <hi>four</hi> or <hi>five Regiments</hi> of <hi>Hypocrites,</hi> and <hi>Vsur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers,</hi> under colour forsooth of Esta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>blishing a better <hi>Intelligence</hi> betwixt <hi>Earth,</hi> and <hi>Hell,</hi> with a Hundred other Fopperies; and had gone on till this time, if <hi>Lucifer</hi> would have found Ears. But he had other Fish to fry; for Neck and All was now at Stake; and so he went about his Business of put<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting all in a posture, and strengthening his Guards. And for the further Secu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity of his Royal Person, he enter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain'd into <hi>his own Immediate Regiment,</hi> several <hi>Reformadoes</hi> of the <hi>Society,</hi> that he particularly knew to be no Flinchers.</p>
            <p>He began his Survey in the <hi>Vaults,</hi> and <hi>Dungeons,</hi> among his <hi>Iaylers,</hi> and <hi>Pris'ners.</hi> The <hi>Make-Bate Babler</hi> March't in the <hi>Van,</hi> breathing an Air that kindled, and Enflam'd wherever he past, without giving any Light (set<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting

People together by the Ears, they know not why) In the second Place the <hi>Gouvernante,</hi> as full of <hi>News,</hi> and <hi>Tittle-Tattle</hi> as she could hold, and tel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling her tale all the way she went. In the Breech of her, follow'd the <hi>Medler,</hi> learing as he past along, first on one side, then on the Other, without ever moving his Head, and making fair with every Soul He saw in's way. He gave <hi>One,</hi> a <hi>Bowe</hi>; T'<hi>other,</hi> a <hi>Kiss; Your most humble Servant,</hi> to a <hi>Third; Can I serve you Sir</hi> to a <hi>Fourth</hi>: But every Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plement was worse to the poor Crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures, then the Fire it self. Ah Traytor! says one; For Pity's sake, away with this new Tormenter! crys another. This Fellow is Hell upon Hell, says a Third. As he trudg'd on, there was a Rabble of Rascals, got together; and in the Middle of the Crowd, a most Eminent <hi>Knight of the Post,</hi> (a great Master of his Trade) that was <hi>reading a Lecture to that Venerable Assembly, of the Noble Mystery of Swearing and Ly<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing</hi>; and would have taught any man in one Quarter of an hour, to prove any thing upon Oath, that he never

saw, nor heard of in his life. This Doctor had no sooner cast his Eye upon the <hi>Intermedler,</hi> but up he started in a Fright. How no? says he; <hi>Is that Devil here?</hi> I came hither on purpose t<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

            <p>As He was speaking, we heard a great, and a confused Noise of <hi>Arms, Blows,</hi> and <hi>Out-cryes</hi>; and presently we discover'd several Persons falling one upon Another like lightning; and in short with such a Fury, that 'tis not for any Tongue, or Pen to Des<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

Lucifer</hi>
               <pb n="264" facs="tcp:40642:137"/>
came then roundly up to him, and with a Voice that made Hell quake; what are you Sir, (says he) that take upon you thus in my Dominions? I am the Great <hi>Iulius Caesar,</hi> (says he) that in this general Tumult, thought to have reveng'd my self upon <hi>Brutus,</hi> and <hi>Cas<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sius,</hi> for Murthering me in the <hi>Senate,</hi> under colour (forsooth) of asserting the <hi>Common Liberty</hi>: Whereas these Traytors did it merely out of <hi>Envy, Ava<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rico,</hi> and <hi>Ambition.</hi> It was the <hi>Empe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rour</hi> not the <hi>Empire</hi> they hated.

It is not the Drawing of a Charge, or the making of a fine Oration, that fits people for Govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment; nor will a Crown sit well upon the Head of a Pedant</hi>; but let him wear it that deserves it. <hi>He is the true Patriot that advances the Glory of his Country, by Actions of Bravery and Honour.

<q>Gentlemen of the Senate (<hi>say's he</hi>) do ye not hear <hi>Caesar?</hi> or will ye adde sin to sin, and suffer all the blame to be cast upon the <hi>Instruments,</hi> when you your selves were the <hi>Contrivers</hi> of the Villany? Why do ye not answer? for <hi>Caesar</hi> speaks to you, as well as to us. <hi>Cassius</hi> and my <hi>self</hi> were but <hi>your Bravos,</hi> and govern'd by <hi>your perswa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sions and advice,</hi> little dreaming of that insatiable ambition that lay lurk<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing under the gravity of your long Beards and Robes. But 'tis the pra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctice of you all, to arraign that Ty<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ranny in the Prince, which you would exercise your selves: in effect, when you have gotten Power, and the co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lour of Authority in your hands, it is
<pb n="267" facs="tcp:40642:138"/>
more dangerous for a Prince not to comply with you, than for a Vassal to rebel against his Prince. To what end serv'd your perfidious and ungrateful Treason? Make answer to <hi>Caesar.</hi> But for our parts, in the conscience of our sin, we feel the severity of our Punish<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment.</q>
            </p>
            <p>At these words a <hi>hollow-Ey'd, super<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cilious Senator</hi> (that had been of the Conspiracy, and was then <hi>blazing</hi> like a <hi>Pitcht Barrel</hi>) rais'd himself, and with a faint voice, askt <hi>Caesar</hi> what reason he had to complain?
<q>For <hi>Prince (says he</hi>) if King <hi>Ptolomy</hi> murther'd <hi>Pom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pey the Great,</hi> upon whose score he held his Kingdom: why might not the <hi>Senate</hi> as well <hi>kill you,</hi> to recover what you had taken from them? And in the case betwixt <hi>Caesar</hi> and <hi>Pompey,</hi> let the Devils themselves be Judges. As for <hi>Achillas (who was one one of the murtherers</hi>) what he did, was by <hi>Ptolomy</hi>'s command, and then he was but a <hi>Free-booter</hi> neither, a fellow that got his living by Rapine and Spoil: but <hi>Caesar</hi> was undoubtedly the more infamous of the two. 'Tis
<pb n="268" facs="tcp:40642:139"/>
true, you wept at the sight of <hi>Pom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pey</hi>'s <hi>head,</hi> but such tears as were more treacherous than the Steel that kill'd him. Ah cruel compassion and revengeful piety! that made thee a more barbarous Enemy to <hi>Pompey, dead</hi> than <hi>living.</hi> Oh that ever two Hypocrite Eyes should creep into the first Head of the World! To con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clude, the death of <hi>Caesar,</hi> had been the <hi>Recovery</hi> of our <hi>Republick,</hi> if the multitude had not call'd in others of his Race to the Government, which render'd <hi>thy fall</hi> the very <hi>Hydra</hi> of the Empire.</q>
            </p>
            <p>We had had another skirmish upon these words, if <hi>Lucifer</hi> had not com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manded <hi>Caesar</hi> to his Cell again, upon pain of Death; and there to abide such correction as belong'd to him, for slight<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the warnings he had of his Disaster. <hi>Brutus</hi> and <hi>Cassius</hi> too were turn'd over to the <hi>politick Fools:</hi> and the <hi>Senators</hi> were dispatch'd away to <hi>Minos</hi> and <hi>Rhadamanthus,</hi> and to sit as <hi>Assistants</hi> in the <hi>Devils Bench.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>After this I heard a murmuring noise, as of people talking at a distance, and
<pb n="269" facs="tcp:40642:139"/>
by degrees I made it out that they were wrangling and disputing still lowder and lowder, till at length it was but a word and a blow; and the nearer I came the greater was the clamour. This made me mend my pace; but before I could reach them, they were all toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther by the Ears in a <hi>bloudy fray</hi>: They were persons of great quality all of them, as <hi>Emperors, Magistrates, Generals of Armies. Lucifer,</hi> to take up the Quarrel, commanded them <hi>Peace</hi> and <hi>Silence,</hi> and they all obey'd, but it vext them to the hearts to be so taken off in the full <hi>carriere</hi> of their <hi>Fury</hi> and <hi>Revenge.</hi> The first that open'd his mouth, was a fellow so martyr'd with wounds and scars, that I took him at first for an <hi>indigent Officer</hi>; but it prov'd to be <hi>Clitus</hi> (as he said himself) And one at his Elbow told him, he was a sau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy Companion, for presuming to speak before his time; and so desir'd Audi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence of <hi>Lucifer,</hi> for <hi>the high and mighty</hi> Alexander, <hi>the Son of</hi> Jupiter, <hi>and the Emperor and Terror of the World</hi>: He was going on with his <hi>Qualities</hi> and <hi>Ti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tles</hi>; but an Officer gave the word, <hi>Si<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lence,</hi>
               <pb n="270" facs="tcp:40642:140"/>
and bad <hi>Clitus</hi> begin; which he took very kindly, and told his story.</p>
            <p>
               <q>If it may please your Majesty <hi>(says he)</hi> I was the first Favourite of this Emperor; who was then Lord of all the known World; bare the Title of <hi>the King of Kings,</hi> and Boasted himself for the <hi>son</hi> of <hi>Iupiter Hammon</hi>; and yet after all this Glory, and Conquest, he was himself a slave to his Passions: He was Rash, and Cruel, and conse<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quently, Incapable either of Counsel, or Friendship. While I liv'd, I was near him, and serv'd him faithfully; but it seems, He did not Entertain me, so much for my Fidelity, as to aug<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment the Number of his Flatterers: But I found my self too honest for a Base Office; and still as he ran into any foul Excesses, I took a Freedom with all possible Modesty, to shew him his Mistakes. One day, as he was talking slightly of his Father <hi>Philip (that brave Prince,</hi> from whom he re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiv'd as well his Honour, as his Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing) I told him frankly what I thought of that <hi>Ingratitude,</hi> and <hi>Va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity,</hi> and desired him to treat his
<pb n="271" facs="tcp:40642:140"/>
                  <hi>Dead Father</hi> with more <hi>Reverence,</hi> as a Prince Worthy of Eternal Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour, and Respect. This Commenda<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of <hi>Philip,</hi> so enflam'd him, that presently he took a Partisan and struck me Dead in the place with his own Hand. After this; pray'e where was his Divinity, when he gave <hi>Abdo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lominus,</hi> (a poor Garden-Weeder) the Kingdome of <hi>Sidonia</hi>: which was not, as the World would have it, out of any Consideration of his Vir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tue, but to Mortify, and take down the Pride, and Insolence of the <hi>Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sians.</hi> Meeting him here just now in <hi>Hell,</hi> I askt him what was become of <hi>his Father Iupiter</hi> now; that he lay so long by't; and whether he were not yet convinc'd that all his Flatterers were a Company of Rascals, who with their <hi>Incense,</hi> and <hi>Altars,</hi> would perswade him that He was of <hi>Divine Extraction,</hi> and <hi>Heir apparent to the Throne, and Thunder of Iupiter.</hi> This now was the Ground of our Quar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rel. Invectives apart; who but a <hi>Ty<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rant</hi> would have put <hi>a Loyal Subject</hi> to <hi>Death,</hi> only for his <hi>Affection,</hi> and
<pb n="272" facs="tcp:40642:141"/>
                  <hi>Regards to</hi> the <hi>Memory</hi> of his <hi>Dead</hi> Father? how barbarously did he treat his Favourites, <hi>Parmenio, Philotas, Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>listhenes, Amintas, &amp;c.</hi> so that good or bad is all a case, for 'tis crime e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nough to be the Favourite of a Tyrant: As in the course of humane life, every man <hi>dies</hi> because he is <hi>mortal,</hi> and the <hi>disease</hi> is rather the <hi>pretext</hi> of his <hi>death,</hi> than the <hi>cause</hi> of it.</q>
You find now (says <hi>Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tan</hi>) that <hi>Tyrants</hi> will shew their <hi>people</hi> many a <hi>Dog-trick,</hi> when the humour takes them. The <hi>good,</hi> they <hi>hate,</hi> for not being <hi>wicked</hi>; and the <hi>bad,</hi> because they are no <hi>worse.</hi> How many <hi>Favou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rites</hi> have you ever seen come to a <hi>fair</hi> and <hi>timely end</hi>? Remember the <hi>Emblem</hi> of the <hi>Sponge,</hi> and that's the use that <hi>Princes</hi> make of their <hi>Favourites: they let them suck and fill, and then squeeze them for their own profit.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>At that word there was heard a la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mentable cry, and at the same time a venerable <hi>old man,</hi> as pale as if he had no bloud in his veins, came up to <hi>Lu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cifer,</hi> and told him, that his <hi>Emblem</hi> of the <hi>Sponge</hi> came very pat to his <hi>Case</hi>;
<pb n="273" facs="tcp:40642:141"/>
For (says he) <hi>I was a great</hi> Favourite, <hi>and a great</hi> horder of Treasure: <hi>a</hi> Spa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niard <hi>by</hi> birth, <hi>the</hi> Tutor <hi>and</hi> Confident <hi>of</hi> Nero; <hi>and my</hi> name <hi>is</hi> Seneca. <hi>In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed his bounties were to excess, he</hi> gave <hi>me without asking, and in</hi> taking <hi>I was never</hi> covetous <hi>but</hi> obedient. <hi>It is in the nature of Princes, and it befits their quality, to be</hi> liberal where they take a liking, both of <hi>Honour</hi> and <hi>Fortunes: and 'tis hard for a Subject to refuse, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out some reflection upon the generosity or discretion of his Master.</hi> For 'tis not the <hi>merit,</hi> or <hi>modesty</hi> of the <hi>Vassal,</hi> but the <hi>glory</hi> of the <hi>Prince</hi> that is in questi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on: and he is the <hi>best Subject,</hi> that con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tributes the most to the <hi>splendor</hi> and <hi>re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>putation</hi> of his <hi>Sovereign. Nero</hi> indeed gave me as much as such a Prince could bestow; and I manag'd his liberalities with all the <hi>moderation</hi> imaginable: yet all too little, to preserve me from the strokes of envious and malicious tongues; which would have it, that my <hi>philosophizing</hi> upon the <hi>contempt of the World,</hi> was nothing else but a meer <hi>im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>posture,</hi> that with less <hi>danger</hi> and <hi>notice</hi> I might feed and entertain my <hi>avarice,</hi>

and with the fewer <hi>Competitors.</hi> Find<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing my credit with my Master decli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning, it stood me upon to provide some way or other for my quiet, and to with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>draw my self from being the <hi>mark</hi> of of a <hi>publick envy.</hi> So I went directly to <hi>Nero,</hi> and with all possible respect and humility made him a <hi>Present</hi> back again of his <hi>own <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="2 letters">

               <pb n="275" facs="tcp:40642:142"/>
was <hi>prevented,</hi> and <hi>Nero</hi> never the <hi>better.</hi> At the same time he put <hi>Lucan</hi> to <hi>death,</hi> only <hi>for being a better Poet than himself.</hi> And if he gave me my <hi>choice</hi> what death to die, it was rather <hi>cruelty</hi> than <hi>pity:</hi> for in <hi>the very delibe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration which death to chuse, I suffer'd all even in the terror and apprehension that made me refuse the rest.</hi> The election I made, was to <hi>bleed to death</hi> in a <hi>Bath,</hi> and I finisht my own dispatches hither; where to my further affliction, I have again encountred this infamous Prince, studying new cruelties, and instructing the very Devils themselves in the Art of tormenting.</p>
            <p>At that word <hi>Nero</hi> advanc'd, with his <hi>ill-favour'd face</hi> and <hi>shrill voice.</hi>
               <q>It is very well (<hi>says he</hi>) for a Princes Favourite, or Tutor to be wiser than his Master; but let him manage that advantage then with respect, and not like a rash and insolent Fool make proclamation presently to the world, that he's the wiser of the two. While <hi>Seneca</hi> kept himself within those, bounds, I lodg'd him in my bosome, and the love I had for that man was
<pb n="276" facs="tcp:40642:143"/>
the glory of my Government; but when he came to publish once (what he should have dissembled or con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceal'd) that it was not <hi>Nero,</hi> but <hi>Sene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ca</hi> that rul'd the Empire, nothing less than his bloud could make satis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>faction for so intolerable a scandal, and from that hour I resolv'd his ru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ine. And I had rather suffer what I do a hundred times over, than enter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain a Favourite that should raise his credit upon my dishonour. Whether I have reason on my side or no, I ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peal to all this Princely Assembly: Draw neer I beseech ye, as many as are here, and speak freely, my Royal Brethren; Did ye ever suffer any Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vourite to scape unpunisht, that had the impudence to write [<hi>I and my King</hi>] to make a <hi>Stale,</hi> of <hi>Majesty,</hi> and to publish himself a <hi>better Statesman</hi> than his <hi>Master?</hi>
               </q>
No, no, (they cry'd out all with one voice) it never was, and never shall be endured, while the world lasts: For we have left our Suc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cessors under an Oath, to have a care on't. 'Tis true, <hi>a wise Counsellor at a Prince's elbow, is a Treasure, and ought
<pb n="277" facs="tcp:40642:143"/>
to be so esteem'd,</hi> while he makes it his business to cry up the abilities and ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stice of his Sovereign: but in the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stant that his vanity transports him to the contrary; <hi>away with him to the dogs,</hi> and <hi>down with him,</hi> for there's no enduring of it.</p>
            <p>
               <q>All this (<hi>cry'd Sejanus</hi>) does not yet concern me; for though I had in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed more brains than <hi>Tiberius,</hi> yet I so order'd it, that he had the credit in publick of all my private Advices. And so sensible he was of my services, that he made me his Partner and Companion in the Empire: he caus'd my Statues to be erected, and invested them with sacred Privileges. <hi>Let Sejanus live,</hi> was the daily cry of the People; and in truth, my well-being was the joy of the Empire; and far and neer there were publick Prayers and Vows offer'd up for my health. But what was the end of all? when I thought my self surest in my Master's Arms and favour; he let me fall, nay he threw me down, caus'd me to be cut in pieces, delivering me up to the fu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry of a barbarous and enraged Multi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tude,
<pb n="278" facs="tcp:40642:144"/>
that drag'd me along the Streets, and happy was he that could get a piece of my flesh to carry upon a Javelins point in triumph. And it had been well if this inhumane cruelty had stopt here; but it extended to my poor <hi>Children,</hi> who, though un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>concern'd in my <hi>crimes,</hi> were yet to partake in my <hi>fate.</hi> A Daughter I had, whom the very Law exempted from the stroke of <hi>Iustice,</hi> because of her <hi>Virginity</hi>; but to clear that scruple, she was condemn'd first to be <hi>ravisht</hi> by the <hi>Hangman,</hi> and then to be <hi>be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>headed,</hi> and treated as her Father. My first failing was upon temerity and pride: I would out-run my destiny; defie fortune: and for <hi>Divine Provi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence</hi> I lookt upon it as a <hi>ridiculous thing.</hi> When I was once out of the way, I thought doing worse was some<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>what in order to being better; and then I began to fortifie my self by vio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lence, against craft and malice.

I had my <hi>Physician</hi> for <hi>poysoning</hi>; my <hi>Assassins</hi> for <hi>revenge</hi>; I had my <hi>false Witnesses</hi> and <hi>corrupt Iudges</hi>; and in truth, what Instru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments of wickedness had I not? And all this not upon choice or inclination; but purely out of the necessity of my condition. When ever I should come to fall, I was sure to be forsaken both of good and bad; and therefore I shun'd the <hi>better sort,</hi> as those that would only serve to accuse me; but the <hi>lewd</hi> and <hi>vicious</hi> I frequented, to encrease the number of my <hi>Complices,</hi> and make my <hi>party</hi> the <hi>stronger.</hi> But after all; if <hi>Tiberius</hi> was a <hi>Tyrant,</hi> I'le swear he was never so by my advice: But on the contrary; I have suffer'd more from him for <hi>plain dealing</hi> and disswading him, than the very subjects of his severity have commonly suffer'd by him.

To speak sincerely, I can never forgive that <hi>Dog-Leech.</hi> Was it not enough to make me <hi>Sick,</hi> when I was <hi>well,</hi> without making me <hi>Dead,</hi> when I was <hi>Sick?</hi> And not to rest there neither, but to persecute me in my <hi>Grave</hi> too.

               <p>The <hi>dead man</hi> ply'd his discourse with so much <hi>Gravity</hi> and <hi>Earnestness,</hi> that <hi>Lucifer</hi> began to believe what he said.

               <p>His mouth was no sooner stopt, but another was open'd; and one of the damn'd came running cross the Compa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny, and so up and down, back and for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward (like a Cur that had lost his Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ster) bawling as if he had been out of his Wits, and crying out,
<q>Oh! Where am I? Where am I? I am abus'd, I am chous'd: What's the meaning of all this? Here are <hi>damning Devils; tempt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing Devils</hi>; and <hi>tormenting Devils</hi>; but the Devil a Devil can I find of the <hi>Devils</hi> that brought me hither: They have gotten away my <hi>Devils</hi>: where

               <p>It might well make the Company stare, to see a Fellow hunting for <hi>Devils</hi> in <hi>Hell,</hi> where they swarm in <hi>Legions.</hi> But as he was in this <hi>Hurry,</hi> a <hi>Governante</hi> caught him by the arm, and gave him a <hi>half turn,</hi> and stopt him.

               <p>Immediately upon the composing of this Fray, we heard the shooting of <hi>Bars</hi> and <hi>Bolts,</hi> the opening of <hi>Doors</hi> and <hi>Hinges</hi> that creakt for want of Grease, and a strange humming of a great number of <hi>People.</hi> The first that appear'd, were a company of <hi>Bold, Tal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kative,</hi> and <hi>painted old Women</hi>; but as <hi>bonny</hi> and <hi>gamesome,</hi> tickling and toying with one another, as if they had never <hi>seen Fifteen</hi>; and carrying it out with

an Air of much satisfaction and content.

and charitable friends, would fain have drawn us off from the course we were in; and to give them their due, bestow'd a great deal of good counsel upon us to very little purpose; for we were in a pretty way of Thriving, and had got<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten a habit of, and could not leave it. We askt them, <hi>What would you have us do</hi>? Money <hi>we have</hi> none, <hi>and</hi> without it, there's no living: <hi>should we stay till it were</hi> brought, <hi>or</hi> came alone? <hi>How would ye have a poor</hi> Individuum Vagum <hi>to live?

               <p>They would tell us sometime, how <hi>base</hi> a thing it was to defame the <hi>house,</hi> and abuse the <hi>Bed</hi> of a <hi>Friend.</hi> Our <hi>An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>swer</hi> was ready;

Upon this, our Grave <hi>Counsellours</hi> find<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing us so resolute, e'en gave us over, and told us as before; that, <hi>In the other world we should meet with our Reward.</hi> Now taking <hi>This</hi> to be <hi>the other World</hi> these honest men told us of, we are inquiring after the <hi>Rewards</hi> they pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mis'd us.</p>

               <p>Just as this storm blew over, there drew neer a multitude of <hi>Bayliffs, Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jeants, Catchpoles,</hi> and <hi>other Officers of Prey,</hi> with the <hi>Thieves Devil, bound hand and foot,</hi> and a foul <hi>Accusation</hi> against him. Whereupon <hi>Lucifer</hi> with a fell countenance took his seat in a flaming Chair, and call'd his Officers about him. So soon as the Prince had taken his place, a certain Officer began his Report.
<q>Here is before thee (quoth he) a Devil (most mighty <hi>Lucifer</hi>) that stands charg'd with Ignorance in his

Trade; and the shame of his Quali<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty and Profession, instead of <hi>damning</hi> men, he has made it his business to <hi>save</hi> them. The word <hi>save,</hi> put the Court in such a Rage, that they bit their lips, till the bloud started, and the fire sparkled at their Eyes; and <hi>Lucifer,</hi> turning about to his <hi>Atturney; Who would ever have imagin'd,</hi> said he, <hi>that so treacherous a Rascal could have been harbour'd in my Dominions</hi>? It is most certain, my gracious Lord, re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ply'd the <hi>Atturney,</hi> that this Devil has been very diligent in drawing people into <hi>Thefts</hi> and <hi>Pilferies,</hi> and then when they come to be discover'd, they are clapt up and hang'd, or some mis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chief or other. But still <hi>before Execu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion,</hi> the <hi>Ordinary</hi> calls them to shrift; and many times the toy takes them in the head, to <hi>confess</hi> and <hi>repent,</hi> and so they are <hi>sav'd.</hi> Now this si<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

themselves. But when they are once left to the <hi>Priest,</hi> he commonly brings them to a sight of their sins, and they 'scape. Now <hi>this simple Devil</hi> was not aware, it seems, that <hi>many a soul goes to Heaven from the Gallows,</hi> the <hi>Wheel,</hi> and the <hi>Faggot</hi>: and this failing has lost your Highness many a fair Pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chase.

The poor Devil thought it was high time to speak now, when they were just upon the point of pas<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sing his Sentence: and so he cry'd out, My Lord (said he) I beseech you hear me; for though they say the Devil is deaf, it is not meant of your Great<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness: so there was a general silence, and thus he proceeded.</q>

liv'd very Comfortably in that Condi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion; for he has no more to do, that I can see, then to <hi>keep his Ears open,</hi> and <hi>learn his Trade.</hi> For put Case it should be some <hi>Pretender</hi> to <hi>a Good Office,</hi> or <hi>a fat Bishoprick</hi> (though the <hi>Fathers,</hi> and <hi>Counsels</hi> are <hi>against Pretenders</hi> in <hi>This Case</hi>) I Phansy to my self, all the Plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sure, and Divertisement that may be.

to Banish</hi> Order <hi>and</hi> Reason <hi>out of it: To turn</hi> Sauciness, <hi>and</hi> Importunity <hi>into</hi> Merit; Example <hi>into</hi> Necessity; <hi>To give</hi> Law <hi>to</hi> Success; Authority <hi>to</hi> Infamy; <hi>and</hi> Credit <hi>to</hi> Insolence. <hi>I have the</hi> Tongues <hi>of all</hi> Counsellers <hi>at my Girdle, and they shall speak neither more nor less then just as I please.</hi> In short, <hi>That's Easie to me which others account Impossible, and while I live, ye need ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver fear either</hi> Virtue, Justice <hi>or Good Government</hi> in the World.

I have a pretty faculty in doing <hi>good Offices</hi> for <hi>Distressed Ladies,</hi> at a time of <hi>Need</hi>; and I make the whole Sex sensible how great a <hi>Folly,</hi> and <hi>Madness</hi> it is to <hi>neg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lect</hi> those <hi>sweet opportunities.</hi> Among other Secrets, <hi>I have found out a way to establish an Office for Thievery, where the Officers shall be Thieves and Iustify it when they have done.</hi> Here he stop't.</p>
               <p>There was a short Silence, and then there appear'd <hi>another Devil, of about a foot and a half long.</hi> I am (says he) a <hi>Devil</hi> but of a small size, and perhaps one of the least in Hell; and yet the Door opens to me as well as to ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther;

                  <hi>Lucifer</hi> then casting a Soure Look over his Shoulder, and spying the <hi>Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernante</hi>: I'm of his Mind (quoth he) that said, <hi>Let God dispose of the Doüeg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nas (or Governantes) as he pleases</hi>: for <hi>I'm in no little Trouble, how to dispose of these Confounded Carrions.</hi> Whereupon, the <hi>Damn'd</hi> cry'd out with one Voice: <hi>Oh</hi>!

Cursed Lucifer</hi>; (cry'd every one to himself) <hi>stow them any where, so they come not near me.

Lucifer,</hi> finding how the <hi>Dread</hi> of the <hi>old Women</hi> wrought upon the <hi>Devils,</hi> contented himself, at the present, to let it pass only, <hi>in Terrorem; but withal,</hi> he swore, <hi>by the honour of his Imperial Crown, and as he hop'd to be sav'd; that what Devil, Devil s Damme, or Reprobate soever, should in time to
