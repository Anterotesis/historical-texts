            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>

            <head>AN ADVERTISEMENT OF THE AUTHOR.</head>
            <p>THIS Small Treatiſe is altogether more be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>holding for its Birth to Fortune, or ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther to an Accident of Divertiſement, then to any ſerious Deſign. For it hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pen'd, That a Perſon of Quality, entertaining a Young Nobleman, who made appear a Solidity of Judgment, and a Penetration of Wit much above his years; among other Diſcourſe told him, that when he himſelf was a Young Man, he had met with a Perſon, from whom in fifteen days time he had learnt the greateſt and moſt material Part of <hi>Logic.</hi> This Diſcourſe gave occaſion to another Perſon then preſent, and one who was no great Ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mirer of that Science, to anſwer with a Smile of Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tempt, That if <hi>Monſieur—</hi>would give him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf the trouble, he would undertake to teach him all that was of any uſe, in the ſo much cry'd up <hi>Art</hi> of <hi>Logic,</hi> in four or five Days. Which Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſal made in the Air, having for ſome time ſerv'd us for Paſtime, I reſolv'd to make an Eſſay: And becauſe I did not think the vulgar <hi>Logic</hi>'s, either Compendiouſly or Politely written, I deſign'd an Abridgment for the particular uſe of the Young Gentleman himſelf.</p>
            <p>This was the only Aim I had when I firſt began the Work; nor did I think to have ſpent above a
<pb facs="tcp:60750:3"/>
day about it. But ſo ſoon as I had ſet my ſelf to work, ſo many new Reflections crowded into my Thoughts, that I was conſtrain'd to write 'em down for the diſcharge of my Memory. So that inſtead of one day, I ſpent four or five; during which time, this Body of <hi>Logic</hi> was form'd, to which af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terwards ſeveral other things were added.</p>
            <p>Now tho it ſwell'd to a greater Bulk of Matter then was at firſt intended, yet had the Eſſay the ſame ſucceſs which I at firſt expected. For the young Nobleman having reduc'd the whole into four Tables, he learnt with eaſe one a day, without any aſſiſtance of a Teacher. Tho true it is, we can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not expect that others ſhould be ſo nimble as he, who had a Wit altogether extraordinary and prompt to attain whatever depended upon the Underſtanding.</p>
            <p>And this was the accidental occaſion that pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duc'd this Treatiſe. But now whatever cenſure it may undergo in the World, I cannot be juſtly blam'd for committing it to the Preſs; ſince it was rather a forc'd then voluntary Act. For ſeveral Perſons having obtain'd Copies of it in Writing (which can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not well be done without ſeveral Errors of the Pen) and underſtanding withal, That ſeveral <hi>Bookſellers</hi> were about to Print it, I thought it better to ſend it into the World corrected and entire, than to let it be Printed from defective <hi>Manuſcripts.</hi> But then a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gain I thought my ſelf oblig'd to make divers Addi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions, which ſwell'd it above a <hi>Third Part,</hi> believing the Limits of the <hi>Firſt Eſſay</hi> too ſhort for a <hi>Public View.</hi> And to that purpoſe we have made it the Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject of the following Diſcourſe to explain the End, which we propoſe to our ſelves, and the reaſon why we have included ſo much variety of Matter.</p>

            <head>THE TRANSLATORS TO THE READER.</head>
            <p>THE Common Treatiſes of LOGIC are almoſt without number, and while every Author ſtrives to add ſomething of his own, ſometimes little to the purpoſe, ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times altogether from the matter, the Art is be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come, not only Obſcure and Tedious, but in a great meaſure Impertinent and <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>ſeleſs.</p>
            <p>Thus the Schoolmen may be ſaid to have clogg'd and fetter'd Reaſon, which ought to be free as Air, and plain as Demonstration it ſelf, with vain miſapplications of this Art to Notion and Nicety, while they make uſe of it only to main<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain litigious Cavils and wrangling Diſputes. So that indeed the common LOGICS are but as ſo many Counterſcarps to ſhelter the obstinate and
<pb facs="tcp:60750:4"/>
vain-glorious, that diſdain Submiſſion and Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vincement, and therefore retire within their For<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tifications of difficult Terms, wrap themſelves up in Quirk and Suttlety, and ſo eſcape from Rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon in the Clouds and Miſts of their own Raiſing.</p>
            <p>For remedy of which we are beholden to this Famous Author, who has at length recover'd this Art, (then a noble Science when not Pedantic) from Night and Confuſion; clear'd away the Rub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>biſh that oppreſs'd it, and prun'd off thoſe <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>n<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derwoods and ſuperfluous Boughs, that overſha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded and ecclipſed the light of true Reaſon; ſo that now LOGIC may be ſaid to appear like Truth it ſelf, naked and delightful, as being freed from the <hi>Pedantic</hi> Dust of the Schools.</p>
            <p>It has had this Influence upon the World alrea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy, that ſeveral Books have been already Writ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten from the Rules of this LOGIC, not only by the Author himſelf, no leſs Celebrated for his Wri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tings, then for many other worthy Actions that recommend him to the Commonwealth of Learn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing: Nor is his diligence in this particular, leſs to be applauded, for having cleans'd the <hi>Augean</hi> Stables of ſo many <hi>Syſtems,</hi> from ſtudied <hi>Barba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riſm</hi>
               <pb facs="tcp:60750:4"/>
and <hi>Delirium.</hi> For which reaſon this LOGIC was thrice Reprinted in <hi>France,</hi> ſo great was the ſatisfaction in thoſe <hi>Parts;</hi> and likewiſe Tran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſlated into <hi>Latin</hi> for <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>niverſal Benefit; and now is rendered into <hi>Engliſh,</hi> as being a Small Treatiſe, no leſs <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>ſeful for the Conduct of <hi>Human Life,</hi> than to inſtruct and guide us wandring in the <hi>Labyrinths</hi> of <hi>Unſettl'd Reaſon.</hi>

            <head>THE FIRST DISCOURSE; Shewing the DESIGN Of this New Logic.</head>
            <p>THERE is nothing more worthy of Eſteem, than ſoundneſs of Judgment, and an exact meaſure of Wit to diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cern between truth and falſhood. All the other faculties of the Mind are of ſingular uſe, but exactneſs of Reaſon is univerſally pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fitable upon all occaſions, and in all the employments of Life. For it is not only in the Sciences that it is a difficult thing to diſcern truth from error, but alſo in all thoſe affairs and actions both of the Body and Mind, which are the ſubjects of human diſcourſe. There is in every one a ſignal difference, while ſome are true and ſome are falſe; and therefore it be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>longs
<pb n="2" facs="tcp:60750:6"/>
to Reaſon to make the choice. Who chuſe aright, are they who are indu'd with an equal poiſe of Wit; ſuch as make a wrong choice are they whoſe Judgments are deprav'd; wherein conſiſts the chiefeſt and moſt Impor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tant difference between the faculties of the Underſtanding.</p>
            <p>And therefore it ought to be the moſt prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cipal Study of a Man to form and ſhape his Judgment, and to render it the moſt exact that poſſible may be; the main aim to which his ut<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moſt diligence ought to tend. To this end we muſt make uſe of Reaſon, as the Inſtrument to acquire Knowledg, and on the other ſide, we ought to make uſe of Knowledg to perfect Reaſon. Truth of Underſtanding being Infi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nitely of greater value than all ſpeculative Knowledg, by means of the moſt ſolid and certain Sciences: Which ought to be a caution to all men of Prudence, not to engage farther in thoſe ſpeculations, than while they ſerve to that end; and only to make tryal of thoſe Stu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dies; not to employ therein the whole force of their Wit.</p>
            <p>For if the diligence of Men do not tend to this end, they will not find the ſtudy of the ſpecula<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tive Sciences, ſuch as Geometry, Aſtronomy, and Phyſick, to be other than a vain amuzement, or that they be much more to be valued than the Ignorance of thoſe things; which at leaſt
<pb n="3" facs="tcp:60750:6"/>
has this advantage that it is leſs troubleſome, and does not puff Men up with that ſottiſh va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity, which they aſcribe to themſelves from the knowledg of thoſe fruitleſs and barren Sciences.</p>
            <p>The hidden ſecrets and miſteries of thoſe Arts are not only of little profit, but altoge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther uſeleſs, if Men conſider 'em only in them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves and for themſelves. For Men were not born to employ their time in meaſuring Lines, in examining the proportion of Angles, or con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſidering the different motions of Subſtance. Their Souls are too lofty, their Life too ſhort, their time too precious, to buſy themſelves a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout ſuch petty Objects. But they are obliged to be juſt, to be upright, to be judicious in all their diſcourſes, in all their actions, and in all affairs which they undertake.</p>
            <p>Which Care and Induſtry is ſo much the more neceſſary, by how much this one rare per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fection, exactneſs of judgment, is to be admired above all others: for every where we meet with none but wandring Underſtandings, uncapable of diſcerning Truth, who in all things take a wrong Courſe; who ſatisfy themſelves with cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rupted reaſons, and fain would impoſe the ſame upon others; who ſuffer themſelves to be led away with the ſmalleſt Experiences; who are always in exceſſes and extremities; who want ſufficient ſtaidneſs to preſerve themſelves con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtant to the Truths which they know, as adher<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
<pb n="4" facs="tcp:60750:7"/>
thereto rather by hazard, then ſound and judicious choice; or elſe quite contrary, con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinue ſo obſtinately fix'd in their opinions, that they will not ſo much as liſten to thoſe that could undeceive them; who boldly decide and determine Arguments, which they neither know nor underſtand, and which were never yet un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtood by any other: who make no diffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rence at all between Speaking and Speaking; or only judg of the truth of things by the tone of the Voice: he that talks ſmoothly and grave<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, ſpeaks reaſon; he that cannot readily explain himſelf, and ſeems to be in a heat, muſt be in the wrong; and more then this they know not.</p>
            <p>Which is the reaſon that there are no abſur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dities how inſupportable ſoever, which do not find their Champions. He that has a deſign to deceive the World, ſhall not fail of Perſons as ready to be gull'd, and the moſt ridiculous Fopperies ſhall meet with Underſtandings pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portionate to their Folly. And indeed we ought not to wonder at any thing, while we find ſo many People infatuated with the Foole<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries of judicial Aſtrology, and perſons of gravity ſo ſeriouſly handling that Subject. There is a cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain Conſtellation in the Firmament which ſome men have been pleas'd to call a <hi>Ballance;</hi> as like a Ballance as a Wind-Mill and all one. This <hi>Ballance,</hi> they cry, is an Emblem of Juſtice, and all that are born under that conſtellation ſhall be
<pb n="5" facs="tcp:60750:7"/>
upright and juſt. There are three other Signs in the Zodiac which they call, the one a <hi>Ram,</hi> the other a <hi>Bull,</hi> the third a <hi>Goat;</hi> and which they might as well have call'd an <hi>Elephant,</hi> a <hi>Crocodile,</hi> or a <hi>Rhinoceros.</hi> Now the <hi>Ram,</hi> the <hi>Bull,</hi> and the <hi>Goat</hi> are Beaſts that chew the Cud; and therefore they that take Phyſick when the Moon is in any of theſe Conſtellations ſhall be in danger to vomit it up again. Theſe are ſtrange extravagancies; yet as extravagant as they are, there are perſons that utter 'em a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>broad for ſound ware, and others that as eaſily believe 'em.</p>
            <p>This falſhood of the Underſtanding is not only the Cauſe of thoſe Errors that are inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mix'd in the Sciences, but of the greateſt part of thoſe faults and Crimes that are committed in Civil Life and Converſation, of unjuſt Quar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rels, of ill grounded Law-ſuits, of raſh advice, and of Enterprizes ill contriv'd and worſe man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nag'd. There are few of theſe miſcarriages that have not their ſource from ſome Errour or Defect of Judgment. <gap reason="illegible" extent="1 word">
                  <desc>〈◊〉</desc>
               </gap> that there is no Defect which it more concerns a man to Correct in himſelf then this.</p>
            <p>But as this amendment is greatly to be deſir'd and wiſh'd for, ſo is it equally as difficult to maintain, ſeeing it depends much upon that meaſure of Intelligence which we bring into the World at our Birth. For common Sence is no
<pb n="6" facs="tcp:60750:8"/>
ſuch Vulgar Quality as men take it to be. There are an infinite company of dull and ſtupid Heads which are not to be reform'd by Inſtru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction, but by reſtraining 'em within thoſe bounds which are proper for their Capacity, and hin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dring 'em from medling with thoſe things of which they are uncapable. Nevertheleſs, 'tis very true, that the greateſt part of the fallaci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous Judgments among men proceed not from this Principle; as being rather caus'd by the precipitation of the Brain, and through defect of Conſideration; from whence it comes to paſs that they judge raſhly of what they only know obſcurely and confus'dly. The little regard and love of Truth in Men, is the reaſon that they take ſo little pains, the cheifeſt part of their time, to diſtinguiſh what is true from what is falſe. They admit into their Breaſts all ſorts of Diſcourſes and Tenents, rather chooſing to ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe them to be true, then to examine 'em. If they underſtand them not, they are willing to believe that others do. And thus they load their memories with an infinite number of falſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties, and afterward argue upon thoſe Principles, never conſidering what they ſay or what they think.</p>
            <p>Vanity and Preſumption alſo contribute very much to this Miſcarriage. They think it a ſhame to doubt, and not to know; and they rather chuſe to talk, and determine at a ven<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture,
<pb n="7" facs="tcp:60750:8"/>
then to acknowledge their not being ſuffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciently inform'd to judge aright. Alaſs! we are full of Ignorance and Errour; and yet it is the moſt difficult labour in the World to draw from the lips of Men ſuch a Confeſſion as this, <hi>I am deceiv'd, I am at a ſtand;</hi> though ſo juſt and ſo conformable to their Natural Condition.</p>
            <p>Others there are, on the other ſide, who not having wit enough to know that there are a thouſand things full of obſcurity and uncertain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty; and yet out of another ſort of vanity, deſirous to let the World ſee that they are not ſway'd by Popular Credulity, take a pride in maintaining that there is nothing at all certain. Thus they diſcharge themſelves of the trouble of examination, and miſguided by this evil Principle, they queſtion the moſt conſtant Truths, even of Religion it ſelf.</p>
            <p>This is the Source of <hi>Pyrrhoniſm,</hi> which is a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nother extravagance of human Wit; which though it appears quite contrary to the raſhneſs of thoſe that decide and determine all things, flows nevertheleſs from the ſame Spring, that is to ſay, want of Conſideration. For as the one will not take the pains to find out Errour, the other will not be at the trouble to face Truth with that ſtedfaſtneſs which is requiſite for con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vincement. The leaſt glimmering ſuffices to make the one believe notorious falſhoods; and to the other is a ſufficient ſatisfaction to make
<pb n="8" facs="tcp:60750:9"/>
'em queſtion the greateſt certainties. But as well in the one as the other; it is only want of Induſtry that produces ſuch different effects.</p>
            <p>True Reaſon places all things in their proper ſtation. She cauſes us to ſcruple all things that are doubtful, to reject what is falſe, and inge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niouſly to acknowledge what is clear and evi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent; without contenting our ſelves with vain Arguments of the <hi>Pyrrhonians,</hi> which do no way deſtroy the rational aſſurance we have of things certain, not in the very judgments of thoſe that propoſe 'em. No man ever ſeriouſly doubted whether there were a World, a Sun and a Moon, or whether the whole were bigger then it's part? Men may outwardly ſay with their Lips that they doubt ſuch a thing, but they can never affirm it in their hearts. Therefore <hi>Pyrrhoniſm</hi> cannot be call'd a Sect of People that are perſwaded of what they aver, but a Sect of Liars. So frequently do they contradict one another in diſcourſing of their Opinions, their hearts not being able to accord with their Tongues, as we may find in <hi>Montaigne,</hi> who has endeavour'd to reſtore that Sect to this Latter Age. For after he has affirm'd that the <hi>Acade<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mic</hi>'s differ'd from the <hi>Pyrrhonians,</hi> he declares himſelf for the <hi>Pyrrhonians</hi> in theſe words, <hi>The Opinion of the</hi> Pyrrhonians, ſaith he, <hi>is more bold, and altogether much more probable:</hi> Whence it appears, that there are ſome things more pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bable
<pb n="9" facs="tcp:60750:9"/>
then others. Nor does he ſpeak this to maintain a piece of ſuttlety: they are words that eſcap'd him before he was aware, and that proceeded from the bottom of Nature, which the falſhood of Opinion cannot ſtifle.</p>
            <p>But the miſchief is that in things that are not ſo ſubject to Sence, theſe Perſons that place their whole delight in doubting all things, will not permit their Wit to apply it ſelf to what might confirm their Judgments; or if they do, 'tis very ſlightly; by which means they fall in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to a voluntary ſuſpence and wavering in matters of Religion, as being pleas'd with that ſtate of Darkneſs which they procure to themſelves, and more convenient to allay the ſtings and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proaches of their Conſcience, and give the free Reins to their paſſions.</p>
            <p>Seeing then, that theſe irregularities of the Underſtanding, which appear ſo oppoſite, while the one gives eaſie beleif to what is obſcure and uncertain, the other ſtill queſtions what is clear and evident, have yet the ſame Source, that is to ſay, want of attentive Study to diſcern the Truth; the Remedy is viſible, ſince there is but one way to guard our ſelves from thoſe miſcarria<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ges by rectifying our Judgments, and our thoughts with mature and ſtudious deliberation. Which is the only thing abſolutely neceſſary to defend a man from ſurpriſes. For as to what the <hi>Aca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demics</hi> affirm'd, that it is impoſſible to find out the
<pb n="10" facs="tcp:60750:10"/>
Truth, unleſs we had the marks of it, as it would be impoſſible to know a Runagate Slave, if met by chance, unleſs his peculiar marks were known, it is a meer frivolous peice of ſut<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tlety. For as we need no other marks to di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtinguiſh Light from Darkneſs but the Light it ſelf, ſo neither do we need any other marks to diſtinguiſh Truth, then the brightneſs of the E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vidence which ſurrounds it, and ſubdues and convinces the Underſtanding, maugre all oppo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſition. So that all the Arguments of theſe Phi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>loſophers are not able to prevent the Soul from ſurrendring her ſelf to Truth, when fully pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>netrated by it's peircing rays, then they are able to hinder the Eyes from ſeeing, when open, and that they are peirc'd by the light of the Sun.</p>
            <p>But becauſe the Underſtanding ſuffers it ſelf to be ſometimes abus'd by falſe Appearances, for want of neceſſary conſideration, and be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe it has not attain'd to a knowledge of things by long and difficult examination, moſt certainly it would be of great advantage to find out Rules for the improvement of the Search of Truth, that ſo it might become more eaſie and more ſurely effectual; nor is it impoſſible but that ſuch Rules might be found out. For ſince that Men are frequently deceiv'd in their judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments, and ſometimes again as rightly underſtand when they argue one while ill, another while well; and after they have argu'd ill, are capable to
<pb n="11" facs="tcp:60750:10"/>
ſee their Errour; 'tis but obſerving by reflecting upon their own thoughts, what method they fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low'd when they argu'd well, and what was the cauſe of their miſtake, when they happen'd to be deceiv'd, and by vertue of thoſe reflexions to frame Rules to themſelves, whereby to avoid being ſurpriz'd for the future.</p>
            <p>This is properly that which the Philoſophers undertake and which they make ſuch magnifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cent promiſes to perform: And therefore if we may believe 'em, they furniſh us in that ſort of Learning which they deſign to this purpoſe, calling it by the name of <hi>Logic,</hi> with a Light ſufficient to diſſipate all thoſe Clouds that dark'n our Underſtanding. They correct all the Errours of our thoughts, and give us ſuch infallible Rules that we cannot miſs the Truth, and ſo neceſſary withal, that without 'em it is impoſſible to know any thing of certainty. Theſe are the Applauſes which they themſelves give their own precepts. But if we conſider, what we find by experience concerning the uſe which theſe Philoſophers have made of thoſe Rules as well in Logic, as in other parts of Phi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>loſophy, we may have ſufficient cauſe to miſtruſt the verity of their Promiſes.</p>
            <p>But becauſe it is not juſt to reject whatever is beneficial in Logic, becauſe of the ill uſe that is made of it; and for that it is not probable that ſo many great Wits, who have ſo ſedulouſly
<pb n="12" facs="tcp:60750:11"/>
ſtudied the Rules of Reaſoning, could find out nothing that was ſolid and material; and laſtly, for that cuſtom has introduc'd a kind of ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſity for us to have at leaſt a rough knowledg of Logic, we thought it might in ſome meaſure contribute to the publick advantage, to draw from thence whatever it contain'd moſt ſervice<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able to rectifie our judgments. And this is cheifly the deſign of this Treatiſe, together with ſome new Reflections that came into our thoughts while the Pen was in our hands, and which indeed make up the greateſt and moſt conſiderable part of the whole.</p>
            <p>For we find that the ordinary Philoſophers had no other intention then to ſet down the Rules of good and bad Arguments. Now though it cannot be ſaid that theſe Rules are al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>together uſeleſs, ſince many times they ſerve to diſcover the fraud of intricate and puzling Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guments, and to diſpoſe our thoughts to argue and refel in a more convincing manner; never<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>theleſs we are not to believe that this benefit ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tends very far; the greateſt part of the Errors of men not conſiſting in their ſuffering them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves to be deluded by ill Conſequences, but in permiting themſelves to be ſway'd by falſe judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments, from whence falſe Conſequences, are drawn. And this is that for which they who have hi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>therto treated of Logic have found but little re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>medy; and which is therefore the ſubject of
<pb n="13" facs="tcp:60750:11"/>
the new Reflections ſo frequent in this Treatiſe.</p>
            <p>Nevertheleſs we are oblig'd to acknowledge, that theſe Reflections which we call new, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe they are not to be found in Common <hi>Lo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gics,</hi> are not all the Author's own; but that we have borrow'd ſome from the Writings of a fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mous Philoſopher of this Age, wherein appears as much perſpicuity and curioſity of Wit, as there does confuſion in others. Some few o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther Reflections we have alſo drawn from a ſmall <hi>Manuſcript</hi> of the deceas'd <hi>Monſieur Paſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chal,</hi> entitl'd, <hi>The Soul of Geometry,</hi> and this is that which we have made uſe of in the Ninth Chapter of the firſt part of the Difference be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween the Definitions of <hi>Name,</hi> and the Defini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions of <hi>Thing,</hi> and the five Rules which are explain'd in the fourth Part, more largely handl'd there then in this Treatiſe.</p>
            <p>As to what we have taken out of the ordinary Logic Books, our following obſervations declare.</p>
            <p>In the firſt place we had a deſign to bring in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to this Treatiſe all that was really beneficial in others, as the Rules of Figures, the Diviſions of Terms and Ideas, with ſome reflections upon the Propoſitions: other things we thought of little uſe, as the <hi>Categories</hi> or <hi>Predicaments</hi> and <hi>Places;</hi> but becauſe they were ſhort, eaſie and common, we did not think fit to omit 'em with a caution however, what judgment to make of 'em, to the end they might not be
<pb n="14" facs="tcp:60750:12"/>
thought more uſeful then indeed they are.</p>
            <p>We were more doubtful what to do with cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain other Things, ſufficiently knotty, but of little profit, as the <hi>Converſion</hi> of <hi>Propoſitions,</hi> the <hi>Demonſtration</hi> of the Rules of <hi>Figures;</hi> but at length we reſolv'd not to leave 'em out, the difficulty it ſelf not being altogether uſeleſs: For true it is that when it does not terminate in the knowledg of any Truth, we may have rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon to ſay, <hi>Stultum est difficiles habere nugas, 'Tis a fooliſh thing to labour in difficult trifles.</hi> Yet are they not altogether to be avoided, when they lead us to ſomething of Truth, ſince it may prove to a mans advantage to exerciſe himſelf in the underſtanding of Truths that are intri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cate.</p>
            <p>There are ſome ſtomacks that only digeſt light and delicate Dyet, and there are ſome Wits that cannot apply themſelves to the ſtudy of other then eaſie Truths array'd in the Orna<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments of Eloquence. Both the one and the o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther is a niceneſs not to be commended, or ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther a real Weakneſs. For a man muſt endea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vour to enable himſelf to diſcover Truth, when it is moſt conceal'd and envelopp'd, and to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpect her, in what ſhape ſoever ſhe appears. For if a man be not able to ſurmount that nice<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs and diſtaſte; which is eaſily conceiv'd of things that appear a little ſuttle and Scholaſtic, he does but thereby contract and ſhrivel up his
<pb n="15" facs="tcp:60750:12"/>
Underſtanding, and render himſelf uncapable to apprehend any more then what is to be known by a long ſeries of ſeveral Propoſitions. So that when one Truth depends upon three or four Principles which he muſt neceſſarily con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſider and ſtudy all at one time, he is amaz'd and foil'd, and many times depriv'd of the know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledg of ſeveral things highly advantageous; which is a fault of great conſequence.</p>
            <p>The capacity of Man's Underſtanding ſhrinks or dilates it ſelf according to uſe and cuſtom, and therefore for the enlarging of the Intellect the Mathematicks and all difficult Studies chief<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly conduce; for they cauſe an expanſion of thoughts, and exerciſe 'em in diligence, and embolden 'em in a ſteddy confidence to ſtick to what they know.</p>
            <p>Theſe are the reaſons that induc'd us not to omit thoſe thornie Subjects, and to diſcourſe of 'em as nicely as any other treatiſe of Logic. They who think 'em tedious, may forbear to read 'em, and indeed we have already given 'em that caution at the beginning, that they may have no reaſon to complain, ſince it is at their own choice to read or let 'em alone.</p>
            <p>Nor did we think it neceſſary to mind the diſguſt of ſome perſons that abhor certain terms of Art, fram'd only to retain more eaſily the ſeveral figures of Argumentation, as if they were ſome Charms in Magic, and frequently
<pb n="16" facs="tcp:60750:13"/>
ſpend their inſipid jeſts upon <hi>Baroco</hi> and <hi>Bara<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lipton,</hi> as being too Pedantical; for we look'd upon their <hi>Puns</hi> to be more Pedantical then the words; for there is nothing ridiculous in the Terms, provided they be not ador'd for too great Miſteries, for it would be very abſurd in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed for a Man that was going to diſpute, to admoniſh his opponent before-hand that he in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tended to diſpute in <hi>Baroco</hi> or <hi>Felapton.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Men ſometimes make an ill uſe of that re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proach of <hi>Pedantry,</hi> and ſometimes fall into it themſelves. while they lay it upon others. <hi>Pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dantry</hi> is a Vice of the Mind not of the Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſſion; for there are Pedants in all habits, of all conditions, and all qualities. To utter Law and mean things in bombaſt expreſſions, to bring in <hi>Greek</hi> and <hi>Latin</hi> by head and ſhoul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders, to be in a pelting chafe about the order of the Attick Months, the habits of the <hi>Mace<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>donians</hi> or ſuch like frivolous diſputes; outra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>giouſly to abuſe another, that is not of his opi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion about a paſſage in <hi>Seutonius;</hi> or about the Etimologie of a word, as if his Religion and his Country lay at Stake; to endeavour to raiſe all the World againſt a Man, as a diſturb<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er of the peace of Chriſtendom, that has not a venerable opinion of <hi>Cicero,</hi> as <hi>Julius Scaliger</hi> has endeavour'd to do againſt <hi>Eraſmus;</hi> to in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tereſt himſelf for the reputation of an antient Philoſopher, as if he were one of his neareſt
<pb n="17" facs="tcp:60750:13"/>
Relations, this is properly that which entitles a Man to <hi>Pedantry.</hi> But to make uſe of a term of Art ingeniouſly found out, for the eaſe of the Memory may be eaſily allow'd without any ſuch reproach.</p>
            <p>It remains that we ſhould give a reaſon for omitting ſo many queſtions as are found in the common Logic-Books, as thoſe which are hand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led in the <hi>Prolegomenus,</hi> univerſal <hi>a parte rei, Relations,</hi> and ſuch like. To which it may ſuffice to anſwer, that they belong rather to <hi>Metaphiſicks</hi> then to Logic, tho' that was not the principal reaſon that induc'd us ſo to do; for when we believe that ſuch or ſuch a thing may conduce to rectify the Judgment, 'tis not material to what Science it belongs. The order<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of various ſorts of knowledg is as free as the ranging and methodizing Letters in a Print<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing-houſe, provided the method be natural. 'Tis ſufficient that the thing inſerted be ſervice<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able to our uſe, and not to conſider whether it be forreign, but whether it be proper, and therefore it is that you ſhall meet in this trea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiſe with ſeveral things appertaining to <hi>Phyſick,</hi> and <hi>Ethicks,</hi> and as much <hi>Metaphiſicks</hi> as are ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſary to be known; tho' as for thoſe things we do not pretend to have borrowed from any o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther perſon. Whatever may be ſerviceable to Logic appertains to it: and indeed it is a ri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diculous thing to ſee how ſeveral Authors tor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
<pb n="18" facs="tcp:60750:14"/>
themſelves, eſpecially <hi>Ramus</hi> and the <hi>Ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſts,</hi> tho' otherwiſe Men of ſence, to bound the juriſdiction of every Science, and to keep 'em from entrenching one upon another, as if they were marking out the Limits of Kingdoms, or bounding the Prerogatives of Parliaments.</p>
            <p>But that which induc'd us wholly to lay aſide theſe School-queſtions was not barely their dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficulty, and their being out of uſe; for we have handled ſeveral of the ſame nature; but be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe that having ſo many bad qualities, we thought they might be diſpenc'd with, without offending any perſon, as being ſo little regarded or eſteem'd.</p>
            <p>For it behoves us to make a great difference between unprofitable queſtions, with which the writings of Philoſophers are inſignificantly ſtuff'd. Some there are ſufficiently contemn'd by the Authors themſelves; and others there are which are celebrated and authentick, and which are notoriouſly handled in the writings of perſons otherwiſe of great eſteem.</p>
            <p>And therefore it ſeems to be a kind of obli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gation upon us, in reference to thoſe celebrated and common Opinions, how falſe ſoever they may be thought to be, not to be ignorant of what has been ſaid concerning 'em. We owe that Civility or rather that Juſtice, not to their falſhood, which deſerves it not, but to men pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>judic'd againſt 'em, to prevent their rejecting
<pb n="19" facs="tcp:60750:14"/>
what others value without Examination. It being but reaſonable to purchaſe at the trouble of underſtanding thoſe queſtions, the priviledg to ſcorn 'em.</p>
            <p>But there is a greater liberty allow'd in re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ference to the former, and thoſe Logical ones which we have thought fit to omit are of that nature: They have this convenience that they are of little Credit, not only in that part of the World where they are unknown, but even among thoſe that profeſs to teach 'em. No Man, God be thank'd, takes the part of <hi>
                  <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>ni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſal a parte rei,</hi> the <hi>unities of Reaſon,</hi> nor <hi>Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cond Intentions,</hi> and ſo we have no reaſon to fear leaſt any one ſhould be offended, for paſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing 'em over in Silence.</p>
            <p>Nor will it be amiſs to advertize the Read<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er, that we have allow'd our ſelves a diſpenſati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, not always to follow the rules of a Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thod altogether exact, as having ſet down ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny things in the <hi>Fourth Part,</hi> which relate to the <hi>Second</hi> and <hi>Third.</hi> But we did it of ſet purpoſe becauſe we thought it more proper to ſee in one and the ſame place, all that was neceſſary to render a Science altogether perfect, which is the main deſign of the method handled in the <hi>Fourth Part,</hi> and for that reaſon it was that we reſerv'd the diſcourſe of <hi>Axioms</hi> and <hi>Demonſtra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions</hi> for that place.</p>
            <p>And thus we have well nigh given ye a pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpect
<pb n="20" facs="tcp:60750:15"/>
of our deſign in this Logic. Peradventure for all this there will be very few that will reap any advantage by it, becauſe it is not their Cu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtom uſually to practice Precepts by expreſs Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flections. Nevertheleſs we hope that they who will carefully peruſe theſe Sheets, will receive ſuch a Tincture from thence, as will render 'em more exact and ſolid in their Judgment before they perceive it; as there are certain remedies that cure the Diſeaſes of the Body by augment<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing and fortifying the vigour of the Parts. However it be; the Treatiſe will be no long trouble to any one; for they who are but a lit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle before hand in the World of Learning may read and con it in ſeven or eight days, and it is a hard caſe, if in a Treatiſe that contains ſo much variety; they do not find ſomething ſufficient to repay their trouble.</p>

For if they are really uninterreſted, they ought to have abandon'd their propriety in making the thing publick, and from that time look upon it with the ſame indifference, as up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on the Works of a Stranger.</p>
            <p>The only right that they can reſerve to them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves is that of correcting what ſhall be found defective, to which end thoſe various Cen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſures that are made of Books, are very advan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tageous. For they are always profitable when they are juſt; and when unjuſt, they do no harm.</p>
            <p>Nevertheleſs Prudence ſometimes requires
<pb n="22" facs="tcp:60750:16"/>
that upon ſeveral Occaſions we ſhould ſubmit to Cenſures not always altogether ſo juſt; for though they do not make appear the thing re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prov'd to be bad, they ſhew us at leaſt that it is not proportionable to the Underſtanding of thoſe that find fault. Now it is better without doubt, if it may be done without falling into any greater inconvenience to chuſe a tempe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rature ſo juſt, as in ſatisfying the judicious, not to diſpleaſe thoſe whoſe judgments are not ſo exact; ſince 'tis not to be ſuppos'd that all our Readers will be men of Wit and Intelligence.</p>
            <p>Thus, it were to be wiſh'd, that men would not look upon the firſt Editions of Books, but as rude Eſſays which the Authors propoſe to the Learned to underſtand their Sentiments of the Compoſition; to the end that by a Collection of various thoughts and Cenſures, they may en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deavour upon a ſecond review to bring their work to perfection to the utmoſt of their Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pacities.</p>
            <p>And this is the Courſe we would willingly have taken in the <hi>Second Edition</hi> of this Lo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gic; had we heard more then what the World had already ſaid of the former. Nevertheleſs we have done what we could: as having added, ſtruck out, and Corrected ſeveral things accord<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to the thoughts of thoſe who were ſo kind as to let us know their objections.</p>
            <p>And firſt of all for the Language, we have
<pb n="23" facs="tcp:60750:16"/>
almoſt in every thing follow'd the advice of two Perſons, who gave themſelves the trouble to obſerve ſome faults that were crept in through inadvertency: and certain Expreſſions which they thought were not properly choſen. Nor did we adhere to their Opinions till by Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſultation with others, we found' that all their Opinions agreed. In which caſe we thought we might be allow'd our Liberty.</p>
            <p>The Reader will find more Additions then Alterations or Retrenchments; not being duly inform'd of the faults that were found in what was already done. However tis true that we underſtood of ſome general Objections that were made againſt the Book, which we thought no Let to our farther Progreſs; believing that they themſelves who made 'em, would eaſily be ſatis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fy'd, when we ſhould give our Reaſons for what we did. For which Cauſe, it will not be amiſs to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turn an anſwer to the cheifeſt of thoſe Objections.</p>
            <p>Some there were offended at the Ti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle, <hi>Of the Art of Thinking,</hi> inſtead of which they would have had, <hi>The Art of well Reaſoning.</hi> But we deſire 'em to conſider, that in regard the aim and deſign of Logic is to give Rules for all the Actions of the Underſtanding and as well for ſimple <hi>Ideas,</hi> as for Judgment and Argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments, there was no other word that compre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hended all thoſe different Actions; whereas the word <hi>Thought</hi> comprehends 'em all. Simple <hi>I<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deas</hi>
               <pb n="24" facs="tcp:60750:17"/>
are thoughts; <hi>Judgments</hi> are <hi>thoughts,</hi> and <hi>Arguments</hi> are <hi>thoughts.</hi> True it is, a man might have ſaid the Art of <hi>well thinking;</hi> but that Addition was not neceſſary, being ſufficiently imply'd by the word <hi>Art,</hi> which ſignifies of it ſelf a method of doing any thing well. And therefore it is enough to ſay <hi>the Art of Painting, the Art of Numbring;</hi> ſince no man ſuppoſes it to be an Art to Paint ill, or miſtake in caſting accompts.</p>
            <p>There is another Objection againſt that mul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>titude of things drawn from other Sciences diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cours'd of in this Logic. Which becauſe it aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſaults the whole deſign, and gives us an occaſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on to explain our ſelves, it is neceſſary to exa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mine with ſo much the more care. To what purpoſe ſay they, all this motley, variety of <hi>Rhe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>toric, Ethics, Phyſic, Metaphyſics,</hi> and <hi>Geometry?</hi> When we thought to meet only with Logical Precepts, we are tranſported of a ſuddain into the Upper Region of the moſt lofty and notio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal Sciences, before the Author know whether we underſtand 'em or not. Rather ought he not to have conſider'd, that if we had all thoſe Sciences already perfect, we ſhould have no need of his Logic? And had it not been better for him to have given us a plain and down-right Logic with Rules explain'd by Examples drawn from common Things, then to encomber 'em with perplex'd and intricate Notions.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="25" facs="tcp:60750:17"/>
But they who argue thus have not ſufficiently conſider'd, that the greateſt diſadvantage to a Book is not to be read; ſince it can only be ſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viceable to thoſe that read it. And ſo whate<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver contributes to cauſe a Book to be read, con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tributes to render it uſeful. Now it is certain that had I gratify'd their fancies, and made a dry barren Logic with the uſual Examples of <hi>Animal</hi> and <hi>Horſe,</hi> how exact ſoever and me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thodical it might have been, it would have on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly augmented the number of ſo many other Books, of which the World is full, and which are therefore never read. Whereas it is this Collection of different Things that has pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cur'd the Sale of this, and caus'd it to be with leſs annoyance and diſtaſt then o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers.</p>
            <p>Nevertheleſs this was not the Principal Aim we had in this mixture; for we are apt to believe we have follow'd the moſt natural and moſt uſeful way of handling this Art, by applying a remedy as much as in us lay to an inconvenience that rendr'd the Study of it almoſt fruitleſs.</p>
            <p>The Experience ſhews us, that of a thouſand young men that Learn Logic, there are hardly ten that know any thing of it, ſix months after they have performed their Exerciſes. Now the real cauſe of this ſo frequent either forgetful<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs or negligence ſeems to be this, for that all
<pb n="26" facs="tcp:60750:18"/>
the Subjects treated of in Logic, being of them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves abſtracted and remote from uſe, the ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>amples alſo by which they are explain'd are no way taking, and ſeldom diſcourſt of other<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>where; ſo that making no impreſſion upon the fancy, they are with the greater difficulty re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain'd in memory, which ſuddenly loſes all the <hi>Ideas</hi> it had a while ago conceiv'd.</p>
            <p>Moreover finding theſe common Examples not ſufficient to prove that the Art it ſelf may be appli'd to any thing uſeful, they accuſtom themſelves to immure Logic within it ſelf, not ſuffering it to extend any farther; whereas Logic was invented to be ſerviceable as an In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrument to the reſt of the Sciences; ſo that having never ſeen its true uſe, they never make any uſe of it, but are glad to be rid of it, as of a mean and unprofitable Knowledg.</p>
            <p>For remedy of which Inconveniency, we thought it the beſt way not to ſeperate Logic, according to the uſual cuſtom, ſo far from the reſt of the Sciences, for the Service of which it was deſign'd, but to join them together both the one and the other by the means of Exam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ples drawn from ſolid Reading, ſhewing at the ſame time both the Rules and the Practiſe, to the end that ſo the Schollar may learn to judg of thoſe Sciences by Logic, and retain Logic in his memory by the help of the Sciences.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="27" facs="tcp:60750:18"/>
So that this variety is ſo far from being a means to darken theſe precepts, that nothing can contribute more to brighten and explain them; for of themſelves they are too ſubtil to make any Impreſſion upon the Mind, if there be not ſomething to make 'em pleaſing and ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceptable to the Fancy.</p>
            <p>Therefore to render this mixture the more acceptable, we have not borrow'd examples at a venture from thoſe Sciences, but have made choice of the moſt important Points of truth, and which might be moſt ſerviceable to the Rules and Principles to find out the truth in o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther matters, which could not be handled at the ſame time.</p>
            <p>For Example, as to what concerns Rheto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rick, we conſider'd that there is little advan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tage to be drawn from that Art, for the finding out of thoughts, expreſſions, and embelliſhments. Our wit furniſhes us with thoughts; Uſe affords us Expreſſion, and for figures and ornaments they are many times ſuperfluous; ſo that all the Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nefit from thence conſiſts in avoiding certain evil habits of writing and ſpeaking, eſpecially an Artificial and Rhetorical Stile compos'd of falſe Imaginations, <hi>Hyperboles,</hi> and forc'd Fi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gures, the moſt unpardonable of all Vices in an Oratour. Now perhaps you will find in this Logic, as much Information for the knowing and avoiding thoſe defects, as in thoſe Books
<pb n="28" facs="tcp:60750:19"/>
that expreſly handle that Subject. The laſt Chapter of the <hi>First Part,</hi> ſhewing the nature of figured Stile, at the ſame time ſhews the uſe of it, and diſcovers the true Rule by which you may know <hi>Legitimates</hi> from <hi>Spurious</hi> Figures. The Chapter where we treat of <hi>Places</hi> in gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral may very much avail to prune off the ſuper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fluous abundance of vulgar Arguments. That article wherin are mark'd out falſe and ill-cohe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring Ratiotinations, into which the Vain-glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry of long and ornamental Haranguing fre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quently engages many, while it throws diſgrace upon all manner of falſhood, propoſes by the by, a moſt important Rule of Rhetorick, then which there is nothing more prevalent, to frame and adapt the Mind to a ſimple, natural and ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dicious Stile. Laſtly, where we are in the ſame Chapter caution'd to beware of provoking thoſe to whom we direct our Speech by ſharp and biting Language, we are alſo taught to avoid ſeveral Errors which are therefore ſo much the more dangerous, by how much they are moſt difficult to be obſerv'd.</p>
            <p>As for <hi>Ethics,</hi> the principal Subject of this Treatiſe would not permit us to inſert more then we have done; nevertheleſs I am apt to believe by what is ſet down in the Chapter of falſe <hi>Ideas,</hi> of <hi>Good</hi> and <hi>Evil,</hi> in the <hi>Firſt Part,</hi> as alſo in that other Chapter of fallacious ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guing that happens in civil converſe, that Men
<pb n="29" facs="tcp:60750:19"/>
may ſee the large extent of it, and how it con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duces to diſplay a great part of human Irregu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>larities.</p>
            <p>There is nothing in <hi>Metaphyſics</hi> more con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiderable than the Original of our <hi>Ideas,</hi> and the ſeperation of Spiritual <hi>Ideas,</hi> from Forms Corporeal. The diſtinction of the Soul from the Body, and the proofs of it's Immor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tality founded upon that diſtinction. All which things are largely handl'd in the <hi>Firſt</hi> and <hi>Fourth</hi> Part.</p>
            <p>In ſeveral places alſo occur the greateſt part of the general Principles of <hi>Phyſic,</hi> which it will be no difficult thing to Collect together. From whence the Reader may be ſufficiently enlightn'd in what is moſt proper to be known concerning Ponderoſity, the ſenſible Qualities, Actions, the Sences, the attractive Faculties, the occult Vertues, ſubſtantial Forms, ſufficient to undeceive Us of an innumerable company of falſe <hi>Ideas</hi> which we ſuckt in from our Infancy to the prejudice of Truth.</p>
            <p>Not that I however, becauſe here are many things to be learnt, would have the Reader neglect ſuch Books as expreſly treat upon thoſe Subjects, which are therefore carefully to be ſtudy'd. But we have conſider'd that there are certain Perſons, who may think this gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral and curſory knowledge of the Sciences ſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficient; and ſo it may be perhaps to thoſe that
<pb n="30" facs="tcp:60750:20"/>
never intend to devote themſelves to the ſtudy of Divinity. For Theology requires an accu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rate knowledge of Scholaſtic Philoſophy, which is as it were it's Mother Language. Now though it is impoſſible they ſhould find all that they ought to learn in this Book, nevertheleſs I dare affirm they may find whatever is convenient to be laid up in the memory for Uſe.</p>
            <p>As to what they object that there are ſome of the Examples that are not proportionate to the Capacities of young Beginners; they err in their affirmation, unleſs it be in reference to Geometry. For as for any of the reſt, they may be eaſily underſtood by all that are not altoge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther void of underſtanding, though they never learnt any thing of Philoſophy. Nay, perhaps they may be more eaſily underſtood by thoſe who are as yet free from all manner of preju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dice, then by ſuch as are amply furniſh'd with the Maximes of Common Philoſophy.</p>
            <p>As for the Examples of Geometry, 'tis very true they will not be underſtood by all the World; but where lies the inconvenience? For they are only brought where Geometry is expreſly, &amp; by it ſelf, diſcours't of, and ſo may be paſs'd over without any harm; or at leaſt where the things are ſo clear of themſelves, that they need no illuſtration, or elſe are ſo explain'd by other examples, that the help of a Geometrician is no way requiſite.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="31" facs="tcp:60750:20"/>
Beſides, if they examine the places where theſe Examples are made of; they will ſee that it was a hard matter to find others that were ſo proper: there being only this Science which is able to afford us clear Ideas and Propoſitions not to be controverted.</p>
            <p>For Example, ſpeaking of Reciprocal Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prieties, we have affirm'd, that there is ſuch a Propriety in Rectangle Triangles, where the Square of the <hi>Hypotenuſe</hi> is equal to the Squares of the reſt of the ſides. Which is clear and certain to all that underſtand it: They that do not ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prehend it, may ſuppoſe it ſo to be; nor will they for that the leſs apprehend the thing it ſelf which the Example is brought to prove.</p>
            <p>Again if we had been to produce the Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon Example of <hi>Riſibility,</hi> which is the reci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>procal Propriety of Man, certainly we had pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pos'd a thing not only very obſcure but very much controverted. For if we underſtand by <hi>Riſibility,</hi> a power of contracting and dilating the Lips, I know not why we may not teach Beaſts to imitate thoſe Motions of the Lips; and ſome we know there are that do ſo. But if we include within the ſignification of this word not only the change of the Countenance, but alſo the thoughts that accompany and produce it; and ſo by <hi>Riſibility</hi> mean a Power to Laugh, <hi>by thinking;</hi> in that manner all human Actions may be call'd reciprocal Qualities; there being
<pb n="32" facs="tcp:60750:21"/>
none but what are proper to men, if we joyn 'em with <hi>Thoughts:</hi> And thus Walking, Eating, Drinking ſhall be call'd reciprocal Qualities of Men; ſince one Man Walks, Eats, and Drinks <hi>thinking.</hi> Which if it be granted, we ſhall ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver want Examples of Reciprocal Proprieties; which however will never ſatisfie thoſe, who attribute <hi>thinking</hi> to Beaſts, and who may as well allow 'em <hi>Laughter</hi> with <hi>Thought.</hi> Where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>as the Example before alledg'd will not admit theſe Cavils as being certain and uncontrovert<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed among all Men.</p>
            <p>In another place we hinted that there are ſome Corporeal things which we apprehend af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter a Spiritual manner without the help of Ima<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gination. And to confirm this we brought the Example of the <hi>Chiliogon</hi> or Thouſand Angl'd Figure. Which Figure we conceive clearly and diſtinctly in our minds, though the Imagination cannot from any delineation of it be ſo diſtinct as to diſplay it's Proprieties. Curſorily alſo we aſſerted that one of the Proprieties of this Fi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gure was that all theſe Angles were equal to 1996 Right Angles. And it is apparent that this Example proves what we intended to make out in that place.</p>
            <p>It remains that we clear our ſelves from an envious Complaint that ſome Perſons have made againſt Us, that we have taken out of <hi>Ariſtotle</hi>'s Examples of vitious definitions, and
<pb n="33" facs="tcp:60750:21"/>
ill cohering Argumentations; which ſeems to be done out of a ſecret deſign to deſtroy the Peripatetic Philoſophy.</p>
            <p>But they had never pronounc'd ſo ſevere a Sentence againſt Us, had they conſider'd the Rules to be obſerv'd in citing of Exam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ples of Errors, which however we have adher'd to in quoting <hi>Ariſtotle.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Firſt, Experience ſhews us, that thoſe which are vulgarly propos'd, are of little or no uſe, and difficult to be remembred, as being fram'd at pleaſure; beſides that the Errors are ſo palpable and ſo viſible, that a Man would think it impoſſible to ſtumble upon 'em. Therefore it is much more to the purpoſe, to the end that what is ſaid concerning thoſe Errors may be the more deeply retain'd in Memory, and the more eaſily avoid<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, to ſelect ſome notable example of the Errors, into which ſome celebrated Author has already fallen.</p>
            <p>For finding the Reputation of great Men not free from noted ſlips, we are in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cited by Care and Induſtry to preſerve our ſelves from the like ſurprizes.</p>
            <p>Moreover ſeeing every Man is bound to make what he writes as profitable as may be, therefore of ſet purpoſe thoſe examples of Errors are to be produc'd, of which it moſt imports us not to be Ignorant. For it
<pb n="34" facs="tcp:60750:22"/>
would be an endleſs toil to remember all the dreams and trifles of <hi>Flud, Vanhelmont</hi> and <hi>Paracelſus.</hi> And therefore it is better to ſearch examples in famous Authors, whoſe Errors it may be worth while to underſtand.</p>
            <p>Now all this is to be found in <hi>Ariſtotle</hi> to a Hair's Breadth. For nothing can ſo ef<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fectually perſwade a Man to avoid a fault, as to ſhew that ſuch a Man as he, ſtumbled at the ſame Block. And his Philoſophy is become ſo famous through the vaſt number of deſerving Perſons that have embrac'd it, that there is all the reaſon in the World his defects ſhould be expos'd. Which being ſo, we thought it would be worth while for the Reader to take a review of the maxims of the Peripatetic Philoſophy, yet becauſe it is never good to be deluded, thoſe Maxims are ſo propos'd, that what they are may be eaſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly known, as having curſorily mark'd out the defects, for farther detection of their fal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lacies.</p>
            <p>Which we have not done to leſſen the Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>putation of <hi>Ariſtotle;</hi> but rather to do him honour as much as may be done by thoſe that differ in opinion from him. And 'tis viſible in other places, that the points which are tax'd of errors, are of no great Importance, nor ſhake the foundations of his Philoſophy, which we had no Intention to aſſail.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="35" facs="tcp:60750:22"/>
But if we make no mention of thoſe things wherein <hi>Ariſtotle</hi> has excell'd in ſeveral of his Books, the reaſon was this, becauſe the ſeries of the diſcourſe did not afford an op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portunity ſo to do; which however we would willingly and gladly have done, if occaſion had offer'd; nor had <hi>Aristotle</hi> wanted his due applauſe; who beyond all controverſy was a perſon of a capacious and ſearching Genius, upon which he relying, has link'd together long Chains of conſequences in ſuch matters upon which he diſcours'd: and therefore he has been very proſperous in what he has writ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten in the ſecond Book of his Rhetorick con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerning the Paſſions. Egregious alſo are his notions and obſervations which he has deli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vered in his Politicks, his Ethics, his Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>blems, and his Hiſtory of Animals: and as confus'd as his <hi>Analtics</hi> are, yet we muſt con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſs that almoſt all we know concerning the Rules of Logic, is taken from thence; ſo that there is not any Author from whom we have borrowed more then from <hi>Aristotle</hi> in this Logic, as one to whom the Body of the precepts belong.</p>
            <p>True it is that the moſt imperfect of his Works ſeems to be his Phiſicks, as being alſo that which for a long time has been condemn'd and forbidden by the Church as a Learned Perſon has made appear in a Treatiſe written
<pb n="36" facs="tcp:60750:23"/>
to that purpoſe; though the principal fault of it was not that it was falſe, but that it was too true, and taught nothing but ſuch things as could not be conceal'd from our Know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledg. For whoever doubted but that all things were compoſed of matter, and a cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain form of matter? Whether matter being to put on form did not want it before, that is to ſay, whether it did not ſuffer Privation? Or whoever queſtion'd thoſe other principles of his Metaphiſicks, wherein we are taught that all things depend upon form; that bare mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter is void of action; that there are place, motion, faculties and qualities: But after all this, we do not ſeem to have learnt any thing new, or are we more able to give a reaſon of any of Natures Effects.</p>
            <p>But if there be any perſons, a many there are, who believe it a Crime to diſſent from <hi>Ariſtotle,</hi> it will be no difficult thing to make it appear how far remote from Reaſon ſuch a vain aſſertion is.</p>
            <p>For if we are oblig'd to reverence the me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mory of ſome Philoſophers, that is only for two Reaſons, either out of a proſpect of the truth to which they have adher'd, or for the Reputation which they have acquir'd among the Learned.</p>
            <p>For the ſake of Truth we reverence 'em, when they keep cloſe to it; but truth does
<pb n="37" facs="tcp:60750:23"/>
not require that we ſhould honour falſhood, in whomſoever it appears.</p>
            <p>As for the conſent of Men in the approba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of a Philoſopher, certain it is, that 'tis a good reaſon for giving reſpect; nor can it be denied, but very imprudently, without great wearineſs. And the reaſon is, becauſe in contradicting the generality, we may be juſtly ſuſpected of Preſumption, as believing our ſelves more clear-ſighted then ſo many others.</p>
            <p>But when the learned World is divided in their opinions, as to the worth of an Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thor, and that Perſons of Reputation ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pear on both ſides, we are not then oblig'd to that Reſervedneſs, and we may freely de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clare, what we approve, and what we diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>like in thoſe Writings about which the Lear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned are divided. For then we do not oppoſe our <hi>Sentiments</hi> againſt the <hi>Senſe</hi> of the Author and his Abetters, but ſide with thoſe that maintain the contrary Party.</p>
            <p>And now behold the true Condition of <hi>A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riſtotle</hi> at this day. His Philoſophy has expe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rienc'd both Fortunes, ſomtimes exploded and condemn'd by all; otherwhile receiv'd and applauded by all: at this day it is reduc'd into a middle Condition between the two Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>treams. In <hi>France, Flanders, England, Ger<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>many,</hi> and <hi>Holland</hi> they write frequently for,
<pb n="38" facs="tcp:60750:24"/>
and againſt <hi>Ariſtotle</hi>'s Philoſophy. The <hi>Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riſian</hi> Conferences as well as their Writings are divided into two parts; nor does any one complain of this open War, declar'd a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt him. The moſt famous Profeſſors no longer condemn themſelves to that ſlavery of blindly receiving and maintaining what<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever they find in his Books, and ſome of his Opinions are utterly exterminated; for what Phyſician will now maintain that the Nerves proceed from the Heart, as <hi>Aristotle</hi> believ'd, ſince Anatomy clearly demonſtrates now, that they derive ther Original from the Brain. Whence proceeded that ſaying of St. <hi>Auſtin.</hi>
            </p>
            <q>Qui ex puncto cerebri &amp; quaſi Centro omnes Senſus diffudit.</q>
            <q>Who diffus'd all the Senſes from the point, and as it were the Center of the Brain.</q>
            <p>And what Philoſopher dares be ſo obſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nate as to affirm, that the ſwiftneſs of pon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derous things deſcending encreaſes propor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tionably to the proportion of their weight? When any Man may end this diſpute, by let<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting two ponderous Bodies never ſo unequal in proportion, fall from a high place; at what time he ſhall find very little difference in the ſwift<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs of their Motion.</p>
            <p>All things violent are of ſhort Continu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance, and all extreams are violent. 'Tis ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry hard meaſure to proſcribe all <hi>Ariſtotle's</hi> o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pinions,
<pb n="39" facs="tcp:60750:24"/>
as formerly has been done. On the other ſide it is an unreaſonable Servitude, for a Man to pledg his aſſent to all he has written, and to allow only him for the ſtan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dard of Philoſophy, as afterwards they went about to do. Men cannot long endure ſuch a Tyranny, but by degrees they will recover the Poſſeſſion of their rational liberty, which conſiſts in approving what they judg to be true, and rejecting that which they judg to be falſe.</p>
            <p>For it does not ſeem contrary to Reaſon, that Reaſon ſhould ſubmit to Authority in Sciences, which treating of things above Reaſon, are bound to follow another Light; which is that of Divine Authority. But in Sciences that depend upon the ſupport of Reaſon; Reaſon acts well and by her own Precepts, when ſhe decrees that there is no Obedience to be given to the Authority of Philoſophers againſt Reaſon.</p>
            <p>This is the Rule, which we have follow'd in diſcourſing the Opinions of the Philoſophers, as well antient as modern, we have ſought for Truth in both, neither eſpouſing the quar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rel of any Sect, nor bidding battle to any.</p>
            <p>So that all that is to be concluded, when we reject the Opinion of <hi>Ariſtotle,</hi> or any o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther is only this, that in ſuch a point we diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcent from; not, that we do not conſent in o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers;
<pb n="40" facs="tcp:60750:25"/>
much leſs that we have any averſion againſt 'em; or ſeek to degrade or leſſen their worth. And this modeſt Procedure of ours we hope will be approv'd by all juſt Judges, and that they will acknowledg, that there is nothing in the whole world, but a ſincere de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſire to contribute to the Publick Good, as far as lyes in the Power of a Treatiſe of this na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, without Paſſion or Hatred againſt any Perſon Living.</p>

            <head>LOGIC; OR THE ART OF THINKING.</head>
            <p>LOGIC is the Art of well uſing Reaſon in the knowledge of Things for the inſtruction as well of a mans ſelf, as of others.</p>
            <p>This Art is deriv'd from the Reflexions which men have made upon the four Princi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pal Operations of the mind, <hi>Apprehenſion, Judgment, Diſcourſe,</hi> and <hi>Diſpoſition.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>We call <hi>Apprehenſion</hi> the ſimple Contempla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of Things that preſent themſelves to the
<pb n="42" facs="tcp:60750:26"/>
Mind, as when we conſider the <hi>Sun,</hi> the <hi>Earth,</hi> a Tree, Rotundity, a Square, Cogitati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, Entity, pronouncing nothing expreſly concerning 'em; and the form under which we conſider 'em is call'd an <hi>Idea.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>We call <hi>Judgment,</hi> that Action of the Mind, by which aſſembling together ſeveral <hi>Ideas,</hi> we either deny or affirm this to be That. Thus conſidering the <hi>Idea</hi> of the <hi>Earth,</hi> and the <hi>Idea</hi> of <hi>Round,</hi> we affirm or deny the <hi>Earth to be round.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>Diſcourſe</hi> we call that Operation of the Mind, by which out of ſeveral Judgments we frame another: Thus when we have judg'd that true Vertue ought to be referr'd to God, but that the <hi>Pagans</hi> did not refer it to God, from thence we infer that the Vertue of the <hi>Heathen's</hi> was not true.</p>
            <p>We call <hi>Diſpoſition</hi> that Action of the Mind, by which we range various <hi>Ideas Judgments,</hi> and <hi>Ratiocinations</hi> upon one and the ſame Subject; in that Order which is moſt proper for it's Explanation; and this by another Name we call Method.</p>
            <p>Theſe Operations proceed meerly from Nature, and that ſometimes more perfectly from thoſe, that are altogether ignorant of Logic, then from others that have learn't it. So that it is not the buſineſs of this Art to find out the way to perform theſe Operations,
<pb n="43" facs="tcp:60750:26"/>
for that we have from Nature alone, that has given us the uſe of Reaſon, but rather to make certain Animadverſions upon thoſe things which Nature her ſelf operates in us, which may be of a threefold uſe to us.</p>
            <p>Firſt we are thereby aſſur'd, that we make a right uſe of our Reaſon. For the Conſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deration of Rules begets in us a more fervent Application and attentive Induſtry of the Mind.</p>
            <p>The Second is, that thereby we more eaſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly detect and explain the Errours and Defects which we meet within the Operations of the Mind. For oftentimes it falls out, that we diſcover by the meer Light of Nature the faults of Ratiocination, yet are not able to give a reaſon why it is falſe. Thus they who know not what belongs to Painting, may take exceptions at the defects of a Picture; tho' they are not able to tell the reaſon why they find fault.</p>
            <p>The third is that we are brought to a more accurate knowledge of the nature of our Un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtanding by theſe Reflections upon the O<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perations of the Mind. Which, if we look no farther then meer Speculation, is to be preferr'd before the knowledge of all Corpo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>real Things, which are infinitely below Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritual Conſiderations.</p>
            <p>Now ſuppoſing thoſe things, which we re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>volve
<pb n="44" facs="tcp:60750:27"/>
in our Minds, in reference to our own Thoughts, were only done with reſpect to our ſelves, it would ſuffice to conſider 'em in themſelves, not cloath'd with words or any other ſigns: but in regard we cannot manifeſt our thoughts to others but by the benefit of exterior Marks; and for that this Cuſtom is ſo prevalent, that when we meditate alone, the Things themſelves do not preſent themſelves to our Thoughts, but in the cloathing of thoſe words by which we expreſs 'em to o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers, it is neceſſary for Logic to conſider <hi>Ideas</hi> joyn'd to words, and words joyn'd to <hi>Ideas.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>And thus by what we have ſaid it follows, that Logic may be divided into four Parts, ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to the ſeveral Reflections which we make upon the four Operations of the Mind.</p>
            <div type="part">
               <head>FIRST PART. <hi>Containing Reflections upon Ideas or upon the firſt Operation of the Mind which is call'd Apprehenſion.</hi>
               </head>
               <p>SINCE we cannot have any knowledge of what is without us, but by the aſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtance of <hi>Ideas</hi> which are within us, what we
<pb n="45" facs="tcp:60750:27"/>
ſhall diſcourſe of <hi>Ideas</hi> may be thought per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>haps to be the moſt important Part of Logic, as being the foundation of all the reſt.</p>
               <p>We may reduce theſe Reflections to five Heads, according to the five ways of conſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dering <hi>Ideas.</hi>

               <p n="1">1. According to their Nature and Ori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginal.</p>

               <p n="5">5. According as they are clear and obſcure, diſtinct or confus'd.</p>

                  </head>
                  <p>THE word <hi>Idea</hi> is of the number of thoſe words which are ſo clear, that they need not to be explain'd by any other; there being no other more clear and ſimple.</p>
                  <p>
                     <pb n="46" facs="tcp:60750:28"/>
So that all that can be done in this caſe to avoid errour and miſtake, is to obſerve the falſe notions and interpretations that may be attributed to this word: while ſome make uſe of it only to ſignifie that manner of conceiving, which is perform'd by the appli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cation of the Mind to thoſe Forms that are depainted in our Fancies, and is call'd <hi>Ima<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gination.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>For as St. <hi>Auſtin</hi> obſerves, Man ever ſince his fall has been ſo accuſtom'd to contemplate Corporeal <hi>Things,</hi> the forms of which en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter through our Sences into our Brains, that the moſt part believe they cannot apprehend a thing, when they cannot imagine it, that is, contemplate it as a <hi>Thing</hi> Corporeal: As if Man had no other way to think or appre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hend.</p>
                  <p>Whereas no man can make a Reflection upon what occurs to his <hi>Thoughts,</hi> but he muſt acknowledg, that he conceives many things altogether deſtitute of Corporeal Form; and finds a difference between <hi>Imagination</hi> and perfect underſtanding. As for example, when I imagine a Triangle, I do not contemplate it only as a Figure conſiſting of three Right Lines; but I alſo conſider thoſe three Right Lines as preſent by the force and internal Ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plication of the Mind; and this is properly to <hi>imagine.</hi> Or if I would think of a Figure
<pb n="47" facs="tcp:60750:28"/>
with a Thouſand Angles, I preſently apprehend that it is a Figure conſiſting of a Thouſand Sides, as eaſily, as I apprehend a Triangle to conſiſt of three Sides; but I cannot imagine the Thouſand ſides of that Figure, nor be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hold 'em as being preſent, with the Eyes, as I may ſo ſay, of my mind.</p>
                  <p>Nevertheleſs, 'tis very true, that the day<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly practice of <hi>Imagination,</hi> in apprehending Corporeal things is the reaſon, that oft times, when we imagine a Figure of a thouſand An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gles, we form in our <hi>Thoughts</hi> ſome confuſed Figure or other. But it is evident that the Figure thus form'd by the aſſiſtance of <hi>Ima<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gination,</hi> is not a Figure of a Thouſand An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gles; as nothing differing from that form, which any one would frame in his <hi>Thoughts,</hi> were he to imagine a Figure of ten Thouſand Angles; as alſo for that it is no ways ſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viceable to diſcover the Proprieties that made the difference between a Figure of a Thou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſand Angles from any other <hi>Polygon.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>And therefore I cannot properly imagine a Figure of a Thouſand Angles, for that the Figure which I would frame in my <hi>Imaginati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on</hi> would repreſent to me any other Figure with a great Number of Angles; and yet I can very clearly and diſtinctly conceive it, as being able to demonſtrate all it's proprieties; as that all the Angles together are equal to
<pb n="48" facs="tcp:60750:29"/>
1996. Right Angles. And thus by conſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quence it is one thing to <hi>imagine,</hi> another thing to <hi>apprehend.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>This is yet more evident by the Conſidera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of many things which we clearly appre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hend, and yet can no way in the World at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain 'em by <hi>Imagination.</hi> For what do we apprehend more clearly, then our <hi>thought</hi> when we <hi>think?</hi> Nevertheleſs, it is impoſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble to <hi>imagine</hi> a <hi>thought,</hi> nor to delineate any form of it in the Brain. What forms of the Particles of Affirmation, <hi>Yes,</hi> and Ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gation, <hi>No,</hi> can be deſcrib'd in the Fancy. Yet both he that denies, and he that affirms the <hi>Earth</hi> to be round have the ſame expreſs <hi>Imaginations, Earth,</hi> and <hi>Rotundity.</hi> To theſe the one adds Affirmation, which is an Action of the Mind, which conceives with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out any Corporeal form; the other adds a Negative, which is another Action of the Mind, and much more incapable of a formal deſcription.</p>
                  <p>When we ſpeak then of <hi>Ideas,</hi> we do not call by that name thoſe Images that preſent themſelves to the Fancy, but whatever of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fers it ſelf to our <hi>thoughts;</hi> at what time we may truly affirm, that we apprehend a cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain <hi>Thing,</hi> after whatever manner we appre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hend it.</p>
                  <p>Whence it follows that we can expreſs no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing
<pb n="49" facs="tcp:60750:29"/>
in words, ſo that we underſtand what we ſay, but that it is evident from thence, that we have in our ſelves the <hi>Idea</hi> of the thing ſignifi'd by our words; though that <hi>I<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dea</hi> may happen to be ſometimes more plain and diſtinct; ſometimes more obſcure and confus'd, as we ſhall declare hereafter. For he would contradict himſelf that ſhould af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firm he knew what he meant by the words which he pronounces, and yet at the ſame time that he pronounces 'em, ſhould un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtand nothing but the ſound of thoſe words.</p>
                  <p>And this is that which ſhews us the falſity of two Opinions broach'd by the Philoſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phers of theſe Times.</p>
                  <p>The firſt is, that we have no <hi>Idea</hi> of God. For if we had none, in pronouncing the word <hi>God,</hi> we ſhould apprehend no more then the three Letters <hi>G, O, D,</hi> and he that only ſpeaks <hi>Engliſh,</hi> would have no more in his <hi>thoughts,</hi> when he hears that word pronounc'd, then if he ſhould come into a Synagogue not underſtanding a tittle of <hi>Hebrew</hi> and hear the names of God <hi>Adonia</hi> or <hi>Elohim.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Moreover when ſome men would be call'd Gods (which was the Frenzie of <hi>Caligula</hi> and <hi>Domitian)</hi> there could be no Crime of Impiety laid to their charge, for that there is nothing in the three Letters <hi>G, O, D,</hi> or the
<pb n="50" facs="tcp:60750:30"/>
two Syllables <hi>De-us</hi> which may not be attri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>buted to a Man, abſtracting the <hi>Idea</hi> from the word: For which reaſon the <hi>Hollander</hi> was never tax'd with Impiety, who call'd himſelf <hi>Ludovicus De-us.</hi> What was then the Impiety of thoſe Princes, but that they left at leaſt a part of it's <hi>Idea</hi> to the word <hi>Deus,</hi> ſo that it ſignifi'd that tranſcendent and adorable Nature of a Deity, and appropria<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted to themſelves both the Word and the <hi>Idea.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>But had we not the <hi>Idea</hi> of God, upon what could we ground all that we ſay of God? As that he is <hi>One,</hi> that he is <hi>Eternal, Omnipo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tent,</hi> all <hi>Mercy,</hi> and all <hi>Wiſdom.</hi> Of which there is nothing comprehended in the ſound of the word <hi>God,</hi> but in the <hi>Idea</hi> which we have of <hi>God,</hi> and which we joyn to the ſound of the word.</p>
                  <p>And hence it is that we refuſe the name of God to all falſe Divinities; not but that the Word might be attributed to 'em, being tak'n materially; but becauſe the <hi>Idea</hi> which we have in our ſelves of the Supreme <hi>Being</hi> and which we have annex'd to the word <hi>God,</hi> be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>longs only to the <hi>True God.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>The ſecond of theſe falſe Opinions is what an <hi>Engliſh</hi> man aſſerts, <hi>That Ratiocination is nothing elſe but a Connexion and Chain of names linkt together by the word,</hi> Eſt, <hi>it is. Whence it</hi>
                     <pb n="51" facs="tcp:60750:30"/>
                     <hi>follows, that by reaſoning we can conclude nothing of the nature of Things, but only concerning their Appellations; That is to ſay, that we barely ſee whether we aſſemble together well or ill, ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to the Covenants we have made with our Fancy concerning their ſignifications.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>To which the ſame Author adds, <hi>If this be true, as it may be it is, reaſoning will depend upon words, words upon imagination, and ima<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gination perhaps, and which is my Opinion, will depend upon the motion of the Corporeal Organs; and ſo our Soul will prove no other then the mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of ſome parts of the Organical Body.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>We are willing to believe that theſe words contain an Objection far remote from the Sence of the Propoſer; but in regard that being ſo Dogmatically expreſs'd, they ruin the Immortality of the Soul, it will be of great importance to lay open the fallacy of the Objection; which it will be no difficult thing to do. For the <hi>Covenants</hi> of which the Philoſopher ſpeaks, can be no other then the conſent of men to take certain ſounds for ſigns of thoſe <hi>Ideas</hi> exiſting in our Minds. So that if we had not beſides the Names, the <hi>Ideas</hi> of <hi>Things</hi> in our ſelves, thoſe Covenants would have been impoſſible; as it is impoſſible by any ſuch Covenant to make a blind man underſtand what is meant by the words, <hi>Red, Green,</hi> or <hi>Blew.</hi> For not having theſe <hi>Ideas</hi>
                     <pb n="52" facs="tcp:60750:31"/>
in his Mind, he cannot joyn 'em to the ſound.</p>
                  <p>Moreover ſeveral Nations having given different Names to <hi>Things,</hi> even to thoſe that are moſt apparent and ſimple, as are thoſe which are the Objects of Geometry, they could not diſcourſe in the ſame manner of the ſame Truths, if diſcourſe were nothing but a Connexion of names by the word, <hi>Eſt, it is.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>And ſince it appears by this variety of words that the <hi>Arabians</hi> (for example ſake) do not agree with the <hi>Engliſh</hi> about the ſame ſignification of Names, ſo could they never agree in judgment or diſcourſe, if their Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcourſe depended upon that Covenant.</p>
                  <p>Laſtly, when we ſay that the ſignification of words are <hi>Arbitrary</hi> or <hi>ad placitum,</hi> we ſtick deep in Equivocation. For it is true that it is a thing altogether <hi>Arbitrary</hi> to joyn this <hi>Idea</hi> to that Sound, rather then another. But <hi>Ideas</hi> are not <hi>Arbitrary</hi> things that depend upon our Fancy, more eſpecially thoſe that are evident and diſtinſt: Which that we may make manifeſt we ſay, that it would be very ridioulous to think that real Effects could de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pend upon <hi>things</hi> purely <hi>Arbitrary.</hi> Now when a man has concluded by his Reaſon, that the Iron Axel that paſſes through the two Mill-ſtones of a Corn-Mill could turn a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/> about,
<pb n="53" facs="tcp:60750:31"/>
without turning the lower Mill-ſtone, if being round it paſs'd through a round hole; but that the ſame Axle could not turn without turning the upper Mill-ſtone; if be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing ſquare, it were faſtn'd in a ſquare hole of the upper Mill-ſtone; what he has underta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken to prove undenyably follows. And by conſequence this Diſcourſe is not a Connexi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of Names according to a Covenant en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tirely depending upon the Fancy of men; but a ſolid and concluſive Judgment of the Nature of Things by the conſideration of <hi>I<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deas,</hi> which men have been pleas'd to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>note and ſignifie by certain Names.</p>
                  <p>Thus much as to what we underſtand by the word <hi>Idea;</hi> we are now to ſay ſomething concerning their Original.</p>
                  <p>And now the Queſtion is, whether our <hi>I<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deas</hi> proceed from the Senſes, and whether that common Maxim be true; <hi>There is nothing in the Intellect, which was not firſt in the Senſe.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>This is the Opinion of a Philoſopher of Great Reputation in the World, who begins his <hi>Logic</hi> with this <hi>Propoſition; Every Idea de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rives it's Original from the Senſes.</hi> He confeſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes however that all <hi>Ideas</hi> are not the ſame in our Senſes, as they are in the mind. But he pretends that they were at leaſt form'd out of thoſe that paſt through our Senſes, either by
<pb n="54" facs="tcp:60750:32"/>
compoſition; as when out of the ſeparate <hi>I<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deas</hi> of <hi>Gold,</hi> and a <hi>Mountain,</hi> we make a <hi>Mountain of Gold;</hi> or by <hi>Amplification</hi> and <hi>Diminution,</hi> as when out of the <hi>Idea</hi> of a Man of <hi>Ordinary Stature,</hi> we make a <hi>Giant,</hi> or a <hi>Pigmee;</hi> or by <hi>ſimilitude</hi> and <hi>Proportion;</hi> as when out of the <hi>Idea</hi> of a Houſe we have ſeen, we make the Delineations of a Stru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cture that we have not ſeen: And thus, ſaith he, we apprehend God, who is above the reach of Senſe, under the ſhape of a vene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rable Old Man.</p>
                  <p>But according to this Doctrine, it would follow, that all our <hi>Ideas,</hi> tho' relating to no particular Object that ever approach'd our Senſes: muſt be all Corporeal, and repreſent nothing to us, but what has paſt at leaſt by parts, through our Senſes: and conſequently that we can conceive nothing but by the help of Images, like thoſe which are form'd in the Brain when we ſee, or imagine Bodies.</p>
                  <p>But tho this Opinion be maintain'd by o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther School Philoſophers as well as himſelf, I ſhall not ſcruple to affirm that it is very ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſurd, and as contrary to Religion as to true Philoſophy. For to ſpeak nothing but what is evident, what is there that we conceive more diſtinctly then our thoughts themſelves? What propoſition clearer then this, <hi>I think, therefore I am?</hi> However we can never be
<pb n="55" facs="tcp:60750:32"/>
certain of the truth of this Propoſition, un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſs we underſtand diſtinctly what it is to <hi>Be,</hi> and what to <hi>think.</hi> Neither is it to be re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quir'd from us to explain theſe terms any far<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther; becauſe they are ſuch that Men ſo clearly underſtand, that a copious explanation would but render 'm more obſcure. If then it cannot be denied but that we have in our ſelves the <hi>Ideas</hi> of <hi>Entity</hi> and <hi>Thought,</hi> I ask, through what door of the Senſes they enter'd into the Mind? Are they <hi>Ideas</hi> of Light or Colours to enter through the <hi>Sight?</hi> Are they ſhrill or deep ſounds to make way through the <hi>Ear?</hi> Are they Odoriferous or noiſom to enter the <hi>Smelling?</hi> Are they ſavory or nauſeous to enter the <hi>Taſte?</hi> hot or cold, ſoft or hard, to glide through the Feeling. If it be ſaid they were form'd of other ſenſible Images, let 'em demonſtrate what thoſe ſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſible Images are, from vvhence theſe <hi>Ideas</hi> of <hi>Entity</hi> and <hi>Thought</hi> proceeded; as alſo hovv they were form'd, whether by <hi>Compoſition,</hi> or by <hi>Amplification,</hi> by diminution or propor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion; for if they cannot anſwer agreably to Reaſon, it muſt be taken for granted, that the <hi>Ideas</hi> of <hi>Entity</hi> and <hi>Thought</hi> are far from any way deriving their Original from Senſe; but that our Soul is endu'd with a Faculty to form'em of her ſelf, though it may happen ſometimes, that ſhe may be incited to make
<pb n="56" facs="tcp:60750:33"/>
uſe of ſomething that ſtrikes the Sence. As a Painter may be induc'd to paint a Picture for the price that is promis'd him; and yet it cannot be ſaid that the picture drew its O<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riginal from the Money.</p>
                  <p>But what the ſame Authors add, that the <hi>Idea</hi> which we have of God, draws its origi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal from Sence, becauſe we apprehend him under the <hi>Idea</hi> of an Old-Man, is a thought unworthy any other then the <hi>Anthropomor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phites,</hi> and which confounding the true <hi>Ideas</hi> that we have of Spiritual things with the falſe Imaginations that we conceive of thoſe Sublimites out of an evil cuſtom, of imagining all things amiſs; whereas it is as abſurd to pretend to imagine that which is not Corporeal, as to hear Colours, and ſee Sounds.</p>
                  <p>To refute this opinion, we need no more then conſider, that if we had no other <hi>Idea</hi> of <hi>God,</hi> then of a venerable Old-Man, all thoſe other Judgments which we make of that <hi>Idea</hi> ought to appear falſe to us, that are contrary to that <hi>Idea;</hi> for we are natu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rally induc'd to believe that our judgments are falſe, when we clearly ſee that they are contrary to the <hi>Ideas</hi> which we have of things. Otherwiſe we ſhall never be able to conclude certainly that God does not con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiſt of parts, that he is <hi>Incorporeal, Omnipre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent,</hi> and <hi>Inviſible,</hi> when all thoſe <hi>Ideas</hi> are
<pb n="57" facs="tcp:60750:33"/>
no way agreeable to that of a venerable Old Man. And if God had at any time ever ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pear'd in that form, it does not preſently follow that we ſhould have no other <hi>Idea</hi> of him but that; for ſo we ſhould have no other <hi>Idea</hi> of the <hi>Holy-Ghoſt</hi> then that of a <hi>Dove</hi> becauſe he once appear'd in that Shape, as God in the ſame manner might be conoeiv'd to be a <hi>Sound,</hi> becauſe the ſound with which the Name of God is pronounc'd, awakens the <hi>Idea</hi> of God in our Minds.</p>
                  <p>It is therefore falſe that all our <hi>Ideas</hi> pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceed from the Senſe: rather it may be affirm<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed on the other ſide, that none of thoſe <hi>I<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deas</hi> that enter our Minds, deduce their Ori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginal from the Senſes unleſs by accident, that is when the motions ſtirr'd up in the Brain, which is all the Senſes can do, give an occa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion to the Soul to produce true <hi>Ideas,</hi> which it would not otherwiſe do; tho' for the moſt part thoſe <hi>Ideas</hi> are nothing like the other that are form'd in the Sence and in the Brain; and beſides the greateſt number of <hi>Ideas</hi> be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing ſuch, as not having any mixture of Cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poreal form, cannot without a moſt manifeſt abſurdity, be referr'd to the Senſe.</p>
                  <p>If any one object that at the ſame time that we have an <hi>Idea</hi> of ſpiritual things, as of <hi>Thought</hi> (for examples ſake) we entertain alſo a certain Corporeal Image of the ſound
<pb n="58" facs="tcp:60750:34"/>
that expreſſes it, they averr nothing contra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry to what we have alreadly prov'd; for that form of the Sound which is preſent in the ima<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gination is not the Image of the <hi>Thought,</hi> but of the Sound; nor does it ſerve to repreſent it otherwiſe, then as the Soul being accuſtom'd when ſhe hears this Sound, to conceive the thought, forms at the ſame time an <hi>Idea</hi> of thought, altogether Spiritual; which has no reference to the <hi>Idea</hi> of Sound, but as only an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nexed to it by Cuſtom; Which is apparent in Deaf people, who have no <hi>Ideas</hi> of Sound, yet have the <hi>Ideas</hi> of their thoughts, at leaſt when they reflect upon their thoughts.</p>

                  <p>WHatever we conceive, is repreſented to our Minds, either as a <hi>Thing,</hi> or a <hi>manner of a Thing,</hi> or as a <hi>thing modified.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>I call that a <hi>Thing</hi> which is conceiv'd to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiſt of it ſelf, and as the Subject of all thoſe things that are comprehended in it, which by another name is call'd <hi>Substance.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>The <hi>Manner, Attribute,</hi> or <hi>Quality</hi> of a <hi>Thing,</hi> I call that, which when it is conceiv<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed to be comprehended in the Subſtance, and
<pb n="59" facs="tcp:60750:34"/>
not to be able to ſubſiſt without it, deter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mines it to exiſt after a certain manner, and gives it a certain denomination.</p>
                  <p>A <hi>Thing modified,</hi> I call a ſubſtance, as it is determin'd by a certain mode or manner.</p>
                  <p>All which things will be apprehended more clearly by Examples.</p>
                  <p>When I conſider a Body, the <hi>Idea</hi> of it repreſents to me a Thing or Subſtance: be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe I conſider it as a thing ſubſiſting by it ſelf, and which has need of no other to exiſt.</p>
                  <p>But when I conſider this Body to be <hi>round,</hi> I conſider a <hi>Round-Body,</hi> and this <hi>Idea</hi> re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſents to me the <hi>Thing Modified.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>The names which are uſed to expreſs theſe things are called Subſtantives, or abſolute, as <hi>the Earth, the Sun, the Soul, God.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Thoſe alſo that primarily and directly ſig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nify the <hi>Modes</hi> or <hi>Manners,</hi> becauſe they have ſome Correſpondence with Subſtantives, are call'd Subſtantives and Abſolutes, as <hi>Hard<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs, Heat, Juſtice, Prudence,</hi> &amp;c.</p>
                  <p>Such names as ſignifie the <hi>Things</hi> as <hi>Modifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed,</hi> marking out primarily and directly the <hi>Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtance,</hi> tho' more confuſedly, and indirectly the <hi>Manner,</hi> tho' more diſtinctly, are call'd <hi>Adjectives,</hi> and <hi>Connotatives,</hi> as <hi>Round, Hard, Juſt, Prudent.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>
                     <pb n="60" facs="tcp:60750:35"/>
But here we are to obſerve that the Mind being accuſtom'd to know moſt things as <hi>Modified</hi> (in regard ſhe attains not the know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledg of 'em but only by accident, or by thoſe qualities that ſtrike the Senſes) often di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vides one eſſence of a <hi>Subſtance</hi> into two <hi>Ide<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>as,</hi> of which the one ſhe takes for the <hi>Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject,</hi> the other for the <hi>Mode.</hi> Thus altho there be nothing in God, which is not God himſelf, yet we apprehend him as an <hi>Infinite Being;</hi> and with us <hi>Infinite</hi> is the Attribute of God, as <hi>Being</hi> the Subject of the Attribute. Thus alſo we conſider Man as the Subject of Humanity, or having Humanity, and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſequently as a <hi>Thing Modified.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>And then the eſſential Attribute, which is the thing moſt it ſelf, is apprehended by the <hi>Manner</hi> of the <hi>Manner,</hi> becauſe it is as it were inherent in the Subject. And this is call'd the Subſtantive Abſtraſted, as <hi>Humani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty, Corporeity, Reaſon.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Nevertheleſs it is of great Importance to diſtinguiſh that which is truly the Mode from that which onely ſeems to be ſo, For the Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>founding of <hi>Manners</hi> with Subſtances, and Subſtances with Manners is the chief ground of all our Errors. Therefore the Nature of the true Mode is ſuch, that the Subſtance of which it is the <hi>Manner,</hi> may be clearly and diſtinctly conceiv'd without it; but the man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner
<pb n="61" facs="tcp:60750:35"/>
cannot be alternately clearly conceiv'd; unleſs the Relation which it has to it's Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtance be as readily apprehended, without which it cannot naturally exiſt.</p>
                  <p>Not but that we may apprehend the <hi>Man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner,</hi> without ſuch an exact and diſtinct conſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deration of the Subject. But that which de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monſtrates that the Relation of the <hi>Manner</hi> to the <hi>Subjest,</hi> is contain'd, at leaſt, confuſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſedly in it's conception; becauſe we cannot deprive the <hi>Manner</hi> of that <hi>Relation,</hi> but that we muſt deſtroy the <hi>Idea</hi> of it at the ſame Time. Whereas when we conceive two <hi>Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtances,</hi> we may deny one thing of the o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther; yet never deſtroy the <hi>Ideas</hi> of either.</p>
                  <p>For example, I may deny <hi>Prudence,</hi> without conſidering the Man, who is prudent; but I cannot conceive <hi>Prudence,</hi> and at the ſame time deny the Relation, which it has to <hi>Man,</hi> or any other intelligible Nature capable of <hi>Prudence.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Contrariwiſe, when I conſider what ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pertains to an extended Subſtance, which is call'd a Body, as <hi>Extenſion, Figure, Mobility, Diviſibility,</hi> and on the other ſide whatever belongs to the Mind, as Thinking, Doubting, Memory, Will, Diſcourſe, I may deny all that of the <hi>Extended Subſtance,</hi> which I conceive belongs to the <hi>Thinking Subſtance,</hi> and yet di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtinctly apprehend the <hi>Extended Subſtance,</hi> and
<pb n="62" facs="tcp:60750:36"/>
all the Adjuncts that belong to it. And I may reciprocally deny of the <hi>Thinking Subſtance,</hi> whatever I apprehend of the <hi>Extended Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtance,</hi> without conſidering what I have con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiv'd of the <hi>Thinking Subſtance.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Which alſo proves, that <hi>Thinking</hi> is not the <hi>Manner</hi> of the <hi>Extended Subſtance,</hi> becauſe that <hi>Extenſion</hi> with all the reſt of the Attri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>butes belonging to <hi>Extended Substance</hi> may be deny'd of Thought, and yet a man may rightly apprehend of <hi>Thinking.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>It may be here farther obſerv'd, that there are ſome of theſe <hi>Modes</hi> or <hi>Manners,</hi> which may be call'd <hi>Intrinſic;</hi> becauſe they are ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prehended to be in the Subſtance, as <hi>round</hi> or <hi>ſquare;</hi> others may be ſaid to be <hi>extrinſic;</hi> be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe they are tak'n from ſomething which is not inherent in the Subſtances; as <hi>beloved, ſeen, deſired;</hi> but theſe things depend upon the A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctions of others. And theſe ſorts of <hi>Modes</hi> or <hi>Manners,</hi> are called in the Schools, <hi>Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinſical Denominations.</hi> But if theſe <hi>Modes</hi> are taken according to the <hi>Manner</hi> whereby things are apprehended, they are called <hi>Second Intentions.</hi> Thus <hi>to be Subjected, to be Predicated</hi> are <hi>Second Intentious,</hi> becauſe they are the <hi>Manners</hi> whereby the things them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves are apprehended, as they are in the Underſtanding, conjoining two <hi>Ideas,</hi> affirm<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing one to be the other.</p>
                  <p>
                     <pb n="63" facs="tcp:60750:36"/>
It is farther to be obſerv'd, that there are other <hi>Modes</hi> which we may call <hi>Subſtantials,</hi> becauſe they repreſent to us true <hi>Subſtances</hi> applied to other <hi>Subſtances</hi> like to <hi>Manners;</hi> of which ſort are <hi>Cloath'd, Arm'd, &amp;c.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>There are others which we may call ſimply <hi>Real,</hi> and theſe are the true <hi>Manners,</hi> which are not <hi>Subſtances,</hi> but <hi>Manners</hi> of <hi>Subſtance.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Laſtly, there are others which we may call <hi>Negatives,</hi> becauſe they repreſent the Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtance to us with a Denial of ſome real or ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtantial <hi>Manner.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Now if the Objects repreſented by theſe <hi>Ideas,</hi> whether <hi>Subſtances</hi> or <hi>Manners,</hi> are re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally ſuch as they are repreſented to us, we call 'em true. If not, they are falſe <hi>Ideas,</hi> in ſuch a manner as they may be. And theſe are they which in the Schools are called <hi>En<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tia Rationes, Entities of Reaſon,</hi> which hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pen for the moſt part when the Mind con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>joins two <hi>Ideas</hi> real in themſelves, but di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtinct; thus the <hi>Idea</hi> of a <hi>Golden Mountain</hi> is an <hi>Entity of Reaſon,</hi> compounded of two <hi>Ideas</hi> of a <hi>Mountain</hi> and <hi>Gold,</hi> which the Mind repreſents as conjoin'd, when really they are not ſo.</p>

                  <p>TO this Head of the Objects of <hi>Ideas,</hi> the ten Predicaments of <hi>Ariſtotle</hi> may be reduc'd; as being but ſeveral Claſſes, under which that Philoſopher comprehended all the Objects of our Thoughts; compredending all Subſtances under the Firſt, and all acci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dents under the other Nine.</p>
                  <p>The firſt <hi>Subſtance,</hi> which is either Spiritu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>al or Corporeal; the ſecond <hi>Quantity,</hi> which is either <hi>diſcrete,</hi> when the Parts are divided as Numbers.</p>
                  <p>Or <hi>Continued,</hi> when the parts are conjoin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, and then either ſucceſſive, as <hi>Time</hi> and <hi>Notion;</hi> or Permanent, which by another name is call'd Space, or Extenſion in Length, Breadth, and Profundity; length alone mak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing lines, Length and Breadth making ſur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>face, and all together cauſing <hi>Solidity.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Third <hi>Quality,</hi> of which <hi>Aristotle</hi> makes four Kinds.</p>
                  <p>The firſt comprehends <hi>Habitude,</hi> a diſpo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſition of Mind or Body, acquir'd by reitera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted Acts, as the Sciences, Vertue, Vice, Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cellency
<pb n="65" facs="tcp:60750:37"/>
in Painting, Writing, Dancing.</p>
                  <p>The Second <hi>Natural Ability;</hi> ſuch as are the Faculties of the Soul or Body, the Under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtanding, the Will, the Memory, the Five Sen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes, Swiftneſs of Foot.</p>
                  <p>The Third, <hi>Senſible Qualities,</hi> as Hardneſs, Softneſs, Ponderoſity, hot, cold, colours, ſounds, odors and ſeveral ſorts of Reliſhes.</p>
                  <p>The Fourth, <hi>Form</hi> and <hi>Figure,</hi> which is the extrinſecal determination of Quantity, as <hi>Round, Square, Spherical, Cubical.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Fourthly Relation of one thing to another, <hi>as of Father to Son, Maſter to Servant, King to Subject, of Power to the Object, of ſight to the Thing Viſible;</hi> to which may be added all things denoting Compariſon; as <hi>like, equal, bigger, leſs.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Fifth, <hi>Action,</hi> either conſider'd in it ſelf; as to <hi>walk, leap, to know, to love;</hi> or externally, as <hi>to ſtrike, to ſaw, to break, to manifeſt, to hear.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Sixth, <hi>Suffering;</hi> as <hi>to be ſtricken, broken, to be manifeſted, heated.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Seventh, <hi>where;</hi> as when we anſwer to Que<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtions about Place; <hi>He is at</hi> Rome, at Paris, <hi>in his Study, or a bed.</hi>
                  </p>

                  <p>The Tenth, the manner of having, as to have any thing about a Man for <hi>Cloathing, Ornament, Armour; or to be Cloath'd, Adorn'd, Arm'd, to wear Breeches,</hi> &amp;c.</p>
                  <p>Theſe are <hi>Ariſtotle</hi>'s Ten Predicaments form'd for the Birth of ſo many Miſteries, though to ſay truth, of very little uſe, and ſo far from rectifying of Judgment, which is the Scope of Logic, that they frequently do much miſchief; and that for two Cauſes which it will be worth while to diſplay in this place.</p>
                  <p>The firſt is that theſe Predicaments are things lookt upon as things grounded upon Reaſon and Truth, whereas they are things meerly Arbitrary, and which have no ground but the Imagination of a Man that has no Authority to preſcribe Laws to others, who have as much Right as he, to diſpoſe in the ſame, or any other order the Objects of Think<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, according to the Rules of Philoſophy, which every one embraces. In a word, the following Diſtic contains whatever falls un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der our Conſideration according to the new Philoſophy.</p>
                  <p>
                     <pb n="67" facs="tcp:60750:38"/>
                     <hi>Mens, Menſura, quies, motus, Poſitura, Figura, Sunt cum materia Cunctarum Exordia rerum.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>For the followers of this Philoſophy be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve they have drain'd all Nature out of theſe ſeven Heads.</p>
                  <p n="1">1. <hi>Mens</hi> or the <hi>Thinking Subſtance.</hi> 2. <hi>Matter,</hi> or the Extended Subſtance. 3. <hi>Meaſure,</hi> or the Bigneſs or Smallneſs of eve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry part of the Matter. 4. <hi>Poſition,</hi> or Scituati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on one in reſpect of another. 5 Figure. 6. Their Motion. 7. Their <hi>Reſt,</hi> or ſlower Motion.</p>
                  <p>The other Reaſon why we think this Series of Predicaments to be pernicious is this, becauſe it occaſions Men to ſatisfie themſelves with the outward Rind of Words, inſtead of Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fiting by the wholſome Fruit, and to believe they know all things, ſo they are able to ſay by rote certain names of <hi>Arbitrary</hi> Sig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nification, which yet imprint no clear or di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtinct <hi>Ideas,</hi> as we ſhall afterwards demon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrate.</p>
                  <p>Here ſomething might be ſaid of the At<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tributes of the <hi>Lullists,</hi> Goodneſs, Patience, Magnitude, and the reſt. But it is ſuch a ridiculous Invention, to think that they are able to give a Reaſon of all things by the ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plication of a few Metaphiſical words, that it is not worth refuting.</p>
                  <p>

And therefore a very Modern Author has affirm'd with great Reaſon, <hi>that the Rules of</hi> Ariſtotles <hi>Logic are ſerviceable, not ſo much to diſcover what we are Ignorant of, but to explain to others, what we know already: but that</hi> Lully <hi>taught us to prattle fluently and without Judgment of that of which we know nothing at all.</hi> And there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore Ignorance is to be preferr'd far before this falſe Knowledg; for as St. <hi>Auſtin</hi> judiciouſly obſerves in his Book of the utility of Belief, ſuch a diſpoſition of the Mind is highly to be blam'd for two Reaſons. One, <hi>for that he who is perſwaded that he underſtands the Truth, renders himſelf uncapable of Learning any more:</hi> and Secondly becauſe ſuch a Preſumption and Raſhneſs is a ſign of an ill-govern'd and ill<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>qualified Mind. <hi>Opinari</hi> ſaith he, <hi>Duas ob res turpiſſimum, eſt, quod diſcere non poteſt, qui ſibi jam ſe ſcire perſuaſit, &amp; per ſe ipſa te<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>meritas non bene affecti Animi ſignum est;</hi> For the word <hi>Opinari,</hi> in the purity of the Latin Tongue, ſignifies a diſpoſition of Mind, that conſents too lightly to uncertain things, and ſo believes that he knows what he does not underſtand, and therefore all the Philo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſophers maintain'd, <hi>Sapientem nihil Opinari;</hi> and <hi>Cicero</hi> blaming himſelf for that defect, ſays that he was <hi>Magnus Opinator,</hi>

                  <head>CHAP. IV. <hi>Of the Compoſition and Simplicity of</hi> Ideas, <hi>wherein is diſcours'd the manner of knowing by Abſtraction or Preciſion.</hi>
                  </head>
                  <p>WE have affirm'd by the by, in the ſecond Chapter; that we may ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prehend the Mode or Form without conſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dering diſtinctly the <hi>Subſtance</hi> of which it is the <hi>Mode,</hi> from whence we take an occaſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on to explain, what is <hi>Abſtraction of the In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tellect.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>The narrow Limits to which our Souls are confin'd are the reaſon that we cannot per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fectly apprehend things, if a little compound<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, without conſidering 'em in Parts, and ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to the ſeveral ſhapes that they may receive. Which is that, which we generally call knowing by <hi>Abſtraction.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>But in regard that things are variouſly compounded, ſome of Parts really diſtinct, which we call <hi>Integral,</hi> as the <hi>Body of Man, Number,</hi> &amp;c. It is eaſie thence to underſtand, that the Mind may conſider one Part and not another, becauſe theſe Parts are really di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtinguiſh'd:
<pb n="70" facs="tcp:60750:40"/>
But this is not that which we call <hi>Abſtraction.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Now it will be more advantagious to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſider theſe Parts ſeparately, to a diſtinct knowledg of which we can never elſe attain. For example the <hi>Body of Man</hi> can be no o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>therwiſe known, then by dividing it into all it's Parts; as well ſimilar as diſſimilar, and by ſetting ſeveral names upon every one. <hi>A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rithmetic</hi> alſo ſtands upon this foundation. For we have no need of Art to meaſure or compt little Numbers, for the Mind is a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble to receive them entire. So that the whole Art conſiſts in numbring ſeperately thoſe Parts of Number, which being whole we cannot reck'n. For as Capacious as the Mind is, it is impoſſible for it to multiply two Numbers conſiſting of eight or nine Figures, without a ſeperate Multiplication of each Fi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gure by it ſelf.</p>
                  <p>Secondly, we know by Parts, when we apply our ſelves to one manner not conſider<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the Subſtance; or to two ſeperately, which are not however inherent in one and the ſame Subject. This is done by the Geo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>metricians who make a Body extended in Length, Breadth, and Profundity, the Ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject of Geometry. But for the more accu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rate knowledg of this they firſt apply them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves to the Conſideration of one only Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>menſion.
<pb n="71" facs="tcp:60750:40"/>
Then they conſider two dimenſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, <hi>Length</hi> and <hi>Breadth,</hi> which they call a <hi>Superficies;</hi> and laſtly all the three dimenſions together, which they call <hi>ſolid Bodies.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Hence it appears how vain and ridiculous the <hi>Subtleties</hi> of the <hi>Skeptics</hi> are, who endea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vour to call in queſtion the certainty of <hi>Geometry,</hi> becauſe it ſuppoſes Lines and Su<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perficies that never were; for it does not ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe Lines without Latitude, nor Superficies without Profundity; but it ſuppoſes that Longitude may be conſider'd without the conſideration of Latitude; which is a thing beyond all Controverſy, for in meaſuring the diſtance between City and City, we only meaſure the length of the way, not troubling our ſelves about the Breadth.</p>
                  <p>Now by how many the more <hi>Manners</hi> we divide <hi>things,</hi> ſo much the more capable we become of accurately underſtanding 'em. Thus we ſee in motion, when the determina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion to what place, is not rightly diſtinguiſh'd as well from the motion, as the parts of the determination, ſo long nothing can clearly be concluded concerning the cauſes of <hi>Reflecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on</hi> and <hi>Distinction,</hi> which is done by the help of this Diſtinction, as may be ſeen in the Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cond Chapter of <hi>Des Cartes's Optics.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Thirdly we know by <hi>Abſtraction,</hi> when the thing has ſeveral Attributes, but we only
<pb n="72" facs="tcp:60750:41"/>
conſider one, ſetting all the reſt aſide. For Example, I conſider, <hi>That I think</hi> and by Conſequence that <hi>I am he who thinks.</hi> Now in this <hi>Idea</hi> of <hi>my ſelf thinking,</hi> I can only conſider the <hi>Thing-Thinking,</hi> not conſidering that I am the <hi>Thing-Thinking,</hi> tho' in <hi>Me,</hi> My ſelf, and the <hi>Thing-Thinking</hi> are one and the ſame, and ſo the <hi>Idea</hi> which I have con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiv'd of the <hi>Perſon-Thinking</hi> will not only repreſent <hi>me my ſelf</hi> but all other <hi>Perſons that think.</hi> In the ſame manner, if I conſider an E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quilateral Triangle, as it is deſcrib'd in ſuch a Paper, with all its other determining Cir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cumſtances; that <hi>Idea</hi> will only repreſent this Triangle to me. But if I call off my thoughts from the conſideration of theſe par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticular accidents, and apply my ſelf to the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſideration of this Figure, as conſiſting of three Lines; the <hi>Idea</hi> thus form'd will hence more clearly explain the Equality of the Lines, and thence I become more apt and Skilful to make a repreſentation of all other Triangles of the ſame Nature. If I am to go farther, and not to ſtop at the Contemplation of the E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quality of Lines, but am to conſider it as a figure conſiſting of three right Lines, this <hi>Idea</hi> will expreſs all the ſorts of Triangles. Laſtly, if omitting the number of the Lines, I only conceive a ſuperficies bounded with Right-Lines, I ſhall form an <hi>Idea</hi> of Figures
<pb n="73" facs="tcp:60750:41"/>
conſiſting of Right-Lines; and thus by de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>grees I may aſcend to extenſion it ſelf. For in theſe Abſtractions, the inferiour degree contains the Superiour, together with ſome conjoin'd determination. Thus <hi>I think</hi> con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tains the <hi>Thing Thinking:</hi> thus an equilateral Triangle contains a Triangle, and thus a Tri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>angle comprehends a Right-lin'd Figure, and the upper degree repreſents many things ſo much the more clearly, by how much the leſs it is determin'd.</p>
                  <p>Laſtly, It is manifeſt, that by the benefit of <hi>Extraction, Common Ideas</hi> are produc'd out of <hi>Singular,</hi> and out of <hi>Common</hi> ones ſtill more <hi>Common.</hi> By which we are admoniſh'd to proceed to what is to be ſaid concern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the <hi>

                  <p>
                     <hi>Ideas</hi> repreſenting one thing, are calld <hi>Sin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gular</hi> and <hi>Individual:</hi> and their Objects are called Individuals, but they that repreſent ſeveral things, are called <hi>
                        <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>niverſal, Common</hi> or <hi>General.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>The names that denote the firſt, are Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per Names, as <hi>Socrates, Rome, Bucephalus.</hi> Theſe that ſignify the latter <hi>Common</hi> and <hi>Ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pellatives:</hi> as a <hi>Man,</hi> a <hi>City,</hi> a <hi>Horſe.</hi> And
<pb n="75" facs="tcp:60750:42"/>
as well <hi>
                        <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>niverſal Ideas</hi> as <hi>Common</hi> names may be call'd <hi>Generical Terms.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Note that there are two ſorts of <hi>Generical Terms,</hi> one of thoſe that are called <hi>
                        <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>nivo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cals,</hi> to which the <hi>
                        <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>niverſal Ideas</hi> are ſo tied, that the ſame name may agree with ſeveral things according to the ſame ſound, and the ſame Notion that is annexed to the Sound; of which ſort are a <hi>Man,</hi> a <hi>City,</hi> a <hi>Horſe.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>The other is of thoſe that are called <hi>E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quivocalls,</hi> the Sound of which is the ſame, annexed to different <hi>Ideas,</hi> ſo that the ſame ſound or word may agree to ſeveral things, but not according to the ſame but various <hi>I<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deas</hi> which cuſtom has ſubjected to the word. Thus <hi>Canon</hi> ſignifies a great Gun, and Eccle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiaſtical decree, and a Rule of Art; for theſe ſignifications belong all to different <hi>Ideas.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Theſe <hi>
                        <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>niverſal Equivocalls</hi> are of two ſorts. For various <hi>Ideas</hi> ſubjected to one Sound, have either no Relation one with another, as in the word <hi>Canon;</hi> or elſe they have ſome Relation; as when the name primarily ſigni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fies one <hi>Idea:</hi> others no otherwiſe then as they relate to the firſt <hi>Idea,</hi> as the <hi>Cauſe, Effect</hi> or <hi>Sign,</hi> and theſe <hi>Equivocalls</hi> are called <hi>A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nalogous;</hi> thus <hi>Animals,</hi> the <hi>Air,</hi> and <hi>Diet</hi> are ſaid to be Healthy.</p>
                  <p>Now the <hi>Idea</hi> firſt joyn'd to the word, de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>notes Health, which is proper to Animals;

                     <pb n="76" facs="tcp:60750:44"/>
but others are added, approaching near to the primary <hi>Idea,</hi> as being the Cauſe of Health; and therefore we call the Air Heal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thy, and Diet healthy, becauſe they both con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tribute to the preſervation of Health.</p>
                  <p>Nevertheleſs when we hear ſpeak only of <hi>
                        <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>niverſal Terms,</hi> we underſtand <hi>
                        <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>nivocalls</hi> only, with the <hi>
                        <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>niverſal Ideas</hi> annexed.</p>
                  <p>But among all theſe <hi>
                        <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>niverſal Ideas</hi> there are two which it highly concerns us rightly to diſtinguiſh, that is to ſay, <hi>Comprehenſion</hi> and <hi>Extenſion.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>I call the <hi>Comprehenſion</hi> of an <hi>Idea</hi> all thoſe Attributes that are contain'd within it, ſo that none can be taken away, but the <hi>Idea</hi> muſt be deſtroy'd. Thus the <hi>Comprehenſion</hi> of the <hi>Idea</hi> of a Triangle, includes <hi>Extenſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, Figure,</hi> Three Lines, three Angles, and the equallity of thoſe Angles with two right Angles.</p>
                  <p>I call <hi>Extenſion</hi> the <hi>Subjects</hi> with which the <hi>Idea</hi> agrees, which are alſo call'd the <hi>Inferi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ors</hi> of the <hi>
                        <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>niverſal Term,</hi> which being rela<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted to thoſe, carries the name of Superior. Thus the <hi>Generical Idea</hi> of a Triangle ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tends it ſelf to all the ſeveral <hi>Species</hi> of Trian<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gles.</p>
                  <p>But tho the <hi>Generical Idea</hi> confuſedly ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tends it ſelf to all the inferior Subjects, never<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>theleſs between the Attributes which it com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prehends,
<pb n="77" facs="tcp:60750:44"/>
and the <hi>Subjects</hi> to which it is ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tended, the difference ariſes from hence, that we cannot deſpoil the <hi>Idea</hi> of any of its attributes without deſtroying it, as hath been ſaid; whereas we may reſtrain the <hi>Extenſion</hi> of the ſame, by applying it to ſome of the <hi>Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jects,</hi> yet never injure the <hi>Idea.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Now the <hi>Reſtriction</hi> of the <hi>Generical Idea</hi> may happen two ways.</p>
                  <p>Firſt by the addition of an <hi>Idea</hi> diſtinct and determin'd. Thus if I add to the <hi>Generical Idea</hi> of a Triangle, that it has a right Angle, I reſtrain the <hi>Generical Idea</hi> of a Triangles to a certain ſpecies of a Triangle, which is therefore called a <hi>Rectangle Triangle.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Secondly, By the addition of an <hi>Idea</hi> con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fus'd, and undetermin'd; as if a Man ſhould ſay, <hi>ſome Triangle.</hi> In which caſe the <hi>Term</hi> is made particular, becauſe that now it extends it ſelf only to a part of the <hi>Subjects,</hi> which before comprehended all, and yet that part to which it is reſtrain'd is not deter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>min'd.</p>

                  <p>WHAT has been ſaid in the former Chapters opens us a way for the ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>planation in few words of thoſe <hi>

                  <p>For when the <hi>Generical Idea</hi> repreſents to us their Objects as <hi>Things,</hi> and that in <hi>Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stantives</hi> and abſolute Terms, it is call'd either <hi>Genus</hi> or <hi>Species.</hi>

                        <hi>Genus</hi> is call'd an <hi>Idea</hi> as being ſo common that it extends it ſelf alſo to other <hi>
                           <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>niverſal Ideas.</hi> Thus a ſquare Figure of four ſides is a <hi>Genus,</hi> in reſpect of a <hi>Parallellogram</hi> or a <hi>Trapezium.</hi> And in like manner Subſtance is the ſame in reſpect of <hi>Subſtance extended,</hi> which is a Body, and the <hi>Thinking Subſtance,</hi> which is a Spirit.</p>

                     <p>But the common <hi>Idea</hi> which is another more Common and General, is call'd <hi>Species.</hi> Thus a <hi>Parallellogram,</hi> and <hi>Trapezium</hi> are <hi>Spe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cies</hi>'s of a Square Figure: and thus Body and Spirit are <hi>Species</hi> of Subſtance.</p>
                     <p>But one and the ſame <hi>Idea</hi> may be call'd a <hi>Genus,</hi> if it be referr'd to other <hi>Ideas</hi> to which it extends it ſelf: but the <hi>Species,</hi> if it relates to an <hi>Idea</hi> more General, to which it is ſubſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vient. Thus <hi>Body</hi> is a <hi>Genus</hi> in reſpect of a <hi>Body</hi> animate or inanimate; but a <hi>Species</hi> in reſpect of <hi>Subſtance.</hi> Thus a Square is a <hi>Ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nus</hi> in reſpect of a <hi>Parallellogram,</hi> but a <hi>Spe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cies</hi> in reſpect of a Figure indeterminately taken.</p>
                     <p>But there is another Notion of <hi>Species,</hi> which does not fall but upon thoſe <hi>Ideas,</hi> which cannot be call'd <hi>Genus</hi>'s; as when any <hi>Idea</hi> has only under it <hi>individuals</hi> and <hi>ſingulars.</hi> Thus a Circle has only under it ſingular Cir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cles, which yet are all of the ſame <hi>Species,</hi> and theſe <hi>Species</hi>'s are call'd the <hi>Lowermoſt.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>There is alſo a <hi>Genus</hi> which cannot be a <hi>Species,</hi> which is call'd the Supreme of all <hi>Ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nus</hi>'s; whether it be <hi>Ens</hi> or <hi>Substance.</hi> Nor is it much material to know it as relating ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther to <hi>Metaphyſics</hi> then <hi>Logic.</hi>

I have call'd thoſe <hi>Ideas</hi> which repreſent to us their Objects as <hi>Things</hi> either <hi>Genus</hi>'s or <hi>Spe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cies</hi>'s. However it is not abſolutely neceſſary that thoſe Objects ſhould be either <hi>Things</hi> or <hi>Subſtances;</hi> it ſuffices that they be apprehend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed to be like'em.

                     <p>On the contrary, <hi>Ideas</hi> that repreſent to us their Objects as <hi>Things modify'd,</hi> and that in <hi>adjective</hi> or <hi>connotative</hi> Terms, if they be com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>par'd with <hi>Substances</hi> which theſe <hi>Connotative</hi> Terms ſignifie but confuſedly, though direct<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, whether theſe <hi>Connotative</hi> Terms denote <hi>Eſſential Attributes</hi> (which indeed are nothing elſe but the <hi>Things</hi> themſelves) or <hi>Manners,</hi> yet are they not call'd either <hi>Genus</hi>'s or <hi>Spe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cies</hi>'s, but either <hi>Differences,</hi> or <hi>Propers,</hi> or <hi>Ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cidents.</hi>

                     <head>Of Difference.</head>
                     <p>Now whereas <hi>Genus</hi> has under it two Spe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cies; of neceſſity the <hi>Ideas</hi> of Both include ſomething of themſelves, which is not com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prehended in the <hi>Idea</hi> of the <hi>Genus.</hi> For if they had nothing different from the <hi>Genus,</hi> they would be <hi>Genus</hi>'s themſelves; and as the <hi>Genus</hi> is predicated of both the <hi>Species</hi>'s, ſo both the <hi>Species</hi>'s are predicated one of a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nother. Hence the Eſſential Attribute to the <hi>Species</hi> not being found in the <hi>Genus,</hi> is call'd the <hi>Difference</hi> of it, and is the <hi>
                           <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>niverſal Idea</hi> which we have of it: becauſe it can ſolely and only repreſent to Us this <hi>Difference,</hi> wherever it be found; that is, in all Inferiors of that <hi>Species.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>For Example, Body and Spirit, are two <hi>Species</hi>'s of <hi>Subſtance:</hi> therefore there muſt be ſomething more in the <hi>Ideas</hi> of Body and
<pb n="82" facs="tcp:60750:47"/>
Spirit, then in the <hi>Idea</hi> of <hi>Subſtance.</hi> Now that which we firſt ſee more in <hi>Body</hi> is <hi>Exten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion;</hi> what we ſee firſt in <hi>Spirit</hi> is <hi>Thought.</hi> Hence the <hi>Difference</hi> of <hi>Body</hi> will be <hi>extenſion;</hi> of <hi>Spirit, Cogitation.</hi> That is Body will be a <hi>Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtance extended,</hi> Spirit, a <hi>Thinking Body.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>Hence it follows, that Difference is doubly referr'd, either to the <hi>Genus,</hi> which it divides, or to the <hi>Species</hi> which it Conſtitutes; and farther that it is the primary part of that which in the <hi>Comprehenſion</hi> of the <hi>Idea</hi> is included in the <hi>Species.</hi> Hence every <hi>Species</hi> may be expreſs'd by one word only, as <hi>Mind, Body;</hi> or by two conjoyntly, that is of <hi>Genus</hi> and <hi>Species,</hi> which is alſo call'd a Defini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, as <hi>Subſtance extended,</hi> a <hi>Thinking Subſtance.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>Secondly, <hi>Difference,</hi> becauſe it conſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tutes the <hi>Species,</hi> and <hi>Differences</hi> it from other <hi>Species's,</hi> ought to have the ſame extent with <hi>Species;</hi> and for that reaſon <hi>Difference</hi> and <hi>Species</hi> ought to be predicated one of ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther; as thus, <hi>Whatever thinks is a Spirit, e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>very Spirit thinks.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>But often times it happens, that in ſeveral things there is no Attribute that offers it ſelf which agrees ſo fully with the whole <hi>Species</hi> as to agree only with that <hi>Species</hi> and no o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther. In this caſe the way is to join together ſeveral Attributes, and the <hi>Aſſemblage</hi> not be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to be found in any other <hi>Species,</hi> conſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tutes
<pb n="83" facs="tcp:60750:47"/>
the difference. Thus the <hi>Platonics</hi> aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerting that the <hi>Daemons</hi> were no leſs rational Animals, then Men, would not admit <hi>Ratio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal</hi> to be the Reciprocal difference of Man, but added another to it, that is to ſay, <hi>Mor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tal;</hi> which is not the Reciprocal difference of Man, as being common to Beaſts: yet be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing both join'd together, they only relate to Man. And thus we frame to our ſelves <hi>Ideas</hi> of the moſt part of Beaſts.</p>
                     <p>Laſtly, It is to be obſerv'd, that it is not always requir'd that both the <hi>Differences</hi> di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viding the <hi>Genus,</hi> ſhould be Poſitive: it ſuffices that only one be ſuch. Thus two Men are ſufficiently diſtinguiſh'd, if he be ſaid to follow an Employment which the other does not; tho' he that wants the Employment has no leſs poſitively then what the other has.</p>
                     <p>Thus Man is generally diſtinguiſh'd from Brutes; for Man is a <hi>Creature endu'd with a Soul;</hi> but Brutes are <hi>meer Animals.</hi> Yet the <hi>Generical Idea</hi> of Brutes contains nothing in it <hi>poſitively,</hi> that is not found in Men; only we add to that <hi>Idea,</hi> a denial of that to be in them which is in Men; that is the <hi>Soul.</hi> So that the difference between the <hi>Idea</hi> of an <hi>Animal,</hi> and the <hi>Idea</hi> of a Brute conſiſts in this, that the <hi>Idea</hi> of an <hi>Animal</hi> neither ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cludes nor includes Cogitation within its Comprehenſion, whereas nevertheleſs it is
<pb n="84" facs="tcp:60750:48"/>
contain'd in its Extenſion. On the other ſide, the <hi>Idea</hi> of a <hi>Brute</hi> excludes Cogitati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on out of its <hi>Comprehenſion,</hi> and therefore cannot ſort with <hi>Man.</hi>

                     <p>The <hi>difference</hi> being found out which con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtitutes the <hi>Species,</hi> that is, the primary eſſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tial Attribute diſtinguiſhing it from any other <hi>Species,</hi> if enquiring farther into the nature of it, we find another attribute depending upon the Principal by neceſſary Connexion, and conſequently altogether agreeing with this only <hi>Species,</hi> ſuch an <hi>Attribute</hi> we call <hi>Propriety:</hi> and becauſe it agrees with all the Inferiors of the ſame <hi>Species</hi> whereever it be, we adopt it into the number of Univerſals, and make a Fourth.</p>
                     <p>For Example, To have a <hi>Right-Angle</hi> is the eſſential difference of a <hi>Rectangle Triangle.</hi> Now becauſe it neceſſarily follows that <hi>Angles</hi> being <hi>Right,</hi> the Square of the <hi>Hypote<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nuſe</hi> is equal to the ſquares of the other ſides, the Equality of thoſe Squares is taken for the Propriety of a <hi>Rectangle Triangle,</hi> which a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>grees with all and only <hi>Rectangle Triangles.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>Nevertheleſs ſome will have this name of <hi>Proper</hi> to be of a larger Extent, and hence ariſe thoſe four <hi>Species</hi> of it.</p>
                     <p>
                        <pb n="85" facs="tcp:60750:48"/>
The firſt is that which we have already ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plain'd, and which agrees with <hi>all ſolely, and al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ways:</hi> thus it is the propriety of all Circles, and only Circles, and always to have all Lines drawn from the Center to the Circum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ference equal.</p>
                     <p>The Second agrees with <hi>All,</hi> but not <hi>only All.</hi> Thus it agrees with an extended Body to be diviſible, becauſe all extended Bodies may be divided, altho <hi>Duration, Number,</hi> and <hi>Force</hi> may alſo be divided.</p>
                     <p>The third may agree with <hi>one only;</hi> but not with all. Thus it is only proper to a Man to be a Phyſitian or a Philoſopher; tho' all Men are neither Philoſophers nor Phyſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tians.</p>
                     <p>The Fourth may agree with <hi>all</hi> and <hi>only,</hi> but not <hi>always.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>An Example of this we have in Grey-hairs of Old-men, which is proper <hi>ſolely</hi> and to <hi>all Men,</hi> but not <hi>always;</hi> that is, not till Men arrive to Old-age.</p>

                     <head>Of Accidents.</head>
                     <p>We have already declar'd in the Second Chapter, that a form or <hi>Manner</hi> is that which cannot naturally ſubſiſt but by the ſubſtance, and that it is not join'd to the Subſtance with any neceſſary Connexion; So that the thing
<pb n="86" facs="tcp:60750:49"/>
may be exactly underſtood, though the Form or Manner be not conceiv'd. Thus we exact<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly underſtand a Man, not conſidering whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther he be <hi>Prudent</hi> or no; but <hi>Prudence</hi> can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not be conceiv'd unleſs we apprehend the Man, or ſome Intelligence being capable of <hi>Prudence.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>But when we couple the confus'd and inde<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terminate <hi>Idea</hi> of Subſtance with the <hi>Diſtinct Idea</hi> of any form or manner, this <hi>Idea</hi> may repreſent all things, wherein this manner is included.</p>
                     <p>Thus the <hi>Idea</hi> of a Prudent Man will re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſent all prudent Men; the <hi>Idea</hi> of <hi>Round</hi> will repreſent all <hi>Round</hi> Bodies. And theſe <hi>Ideas</hi> being thus expreſs'd by <hi>Connotative</hi> Terms, are thoſe things which make the <hi>firſt <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>niverſal,</hi> call'd <hi>an Accident;</hi> becauſe it does not eſſentially belong to the <hi>Thing</hi> to which it is attributed; for if it did, it would be either <hi>Difference</hi> or <hi>Propriety.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>But here it is alſo to be obſerv'd, as we have hinted before, that when two Subſtances are conceiv'd together, another may be con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiv'd as the form or manner of the other. Thus a <hi>Man Cloath'd</hi> may be conſider'd as ſomething compounded of a <hi>Man</hi> and <hi>Cloaths.</hi> But <hi>to be Cloath'd,</hi> in reſpect of that Man, is the manner of his appearing only, under which that Man is conceiv'd, though the

Garments are Subſtances: and thus, to be clad: will belong to the <hi>firſt <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>niverſal.</hi>

                     <p>And ſo much for the Univerſalls ſo pom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pouſly cri'd up in the Schools; for 'tis little material to know that there are <hi>Genus, Spe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cies, Difference, Propriety,</hi> and <hi>Accident;</hi> but to know the true <hi>Genus's,</hi> the true <hi>Species's</hi> of <hi>Genus's,</hi> their Proprieties and accidents, that's the main thing requir'd; for the at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taining of which knowledg we make no queſtion to give ſome light in the following Chapters, after we have ſpok'n ſomething before-hand of the <hi>Complex'd Terms.</hi>

                  <head>CHAP. VII. <hi>Of the Complex'd Terms, their <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>niverſality, and Particularity.</hi>
                  </head>
                  <p>Sometimes to ſome certain Term we join other Terms, from which ariſes in our Minds a <hi>total Idea,</hi> of which we may affirm or deny thoſe things, which cannot either be de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ni'd or affirm'd of the ſingle terms ſeparately taken; from whence proceed the <hi>Complex'd Terms;</hi> as a <hi>Prudent Man,</hi> a <hi>Tranſparent Bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy, Alexander the Son of Phillip.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>
                     <pb n="88" facs="tcp:60750:50"/>
Theſe additions are ſometimes made by Pronouns Relative, as <hi>the Body which is Tran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſparent, Alexander who is the Son of Philip; the Pope who is Antichriſt.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>And indeed it may be affirm'd that altho theſe Pronouns are not always expreſſ'd, yet they are always to be underſtood, becauſe that in altering the Propoſition, they may be Expreſt. <hi>For a Tranſparent Body, and a Body that is Tranſparent,</hi> are equivalent.</p>
                  <p>But that which is chiefly to be obſerv'd in <hi>Complex'd Terms</hi> is, that there are two kinds of <hi>Additions,</hi> of which the one may be cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led <hi>Explicative,</hi> and the others <hi>Determinative.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>The <hi>Explicative</hi> in poſitive words, explains that which before lay hid either in the <hi>Compre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>henſion</hi> of the <hi>Idea</hi> of the firſt Term, or at leaſt which agrees with it as an <hi>Accident,</hi> ſo that it agrees with it generally and according to its entire Extenſion. As when I ſay, <hi>A Man who is a Creature endu'd with Reaſon;</hi> or <hi>a Man who naturally deſires Happineſs;</hi> or a <hi>Man who is Mortal.</hi> For what is here added is only <hi>Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plicative,</hi> not changing any thing in the whole <hi>Idea,</hi> which is annex'd to the word <hi>Man:</hi> nor reſtraining it to ſignifie only certain Men; but only it denotes thoſe things more clearly which are common to all Mankind.</p>
                  <p>Of this nature are thoſe <hi>Additions</hi> which are appli'd to Names, diſtinctly denoting
<pb n="89" facs="tcp:60750:50"/>
                     <hi>Individuals,</hi> as when we ſay, <hi>London is the largeſt City in</hi> Europe; Julius Caeſar <hi>was the greateſt Captain in the World;</hi> Ariſtotle <hi>the Prince of Philoſophers;</hi> Lewis <hi>the Fourteenth King of</hi> France; for here the <hi>Single Terms</hi> ſo pronounc'd, looſe nothing of their Exten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion, as being firſt determin'd as much as they could be.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Determinative</hi> is that, which being added, reſtrains the Signification of the <hi>General Term,</hi> ſo that it is not now accepted in its full extenſion, but comprehends only a part of it; as <hi>Tranſparent Bodies, Wiſe men,</hi> a <hi>Rational Creature.</hi> Theſe additions are not ſimply <hi>Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plicative,</hi> but <hi>Determinative,</hi> becauſe they maim and curtail the Extenſion of the firſt Term; for the name of <hi>Body</hi> here ſignifies only a part of the Body <hi>of Man,</hi> as a part of Men; <hi>of a Creature,</hi> as part of the Creatures.</p>
                  <p>But it is the Nature of theſe additions ſometimes to create a <hi>Singular</hi> out of a <hi>Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon Term,</hi> when they contain Conditions <hi>Individuant:</hi> as when I ſay <hi>the King now Reign<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing,</hi> the Common name of King is determin'd to the ſingle and only Perſon of <hi>James</hi> II.</p>
                  <p>There are alſo two other kinds of <hi>Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plex'd Terms;</hi> of which the firſt is <hi>Complex'd</hi> in words, the other in Sence only.</p>
                  <p>Of the firſt kind are thoſe that have the Addition expreſs'd, as in the Examples hi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>therto mention'd.</p>
                  <p>
                     <pb n="90" facs="tcp:60750:51"/>
Of the other kind are They, in which one of the Terms is only pronounc'd, the other underſtood: as when we ſay, <hi>the King.</hi> This Term is <hi>Complex'd</hi> in Senſe; becauſe when we pronounce the word, the <hi>Idea</hi> of the Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon name does not preſent it ſelf to our minds alone, but, as adjoyn'd to it, the <hi>Idea</hi> of <hi>Lewis</hi> 14. who now Raigns in <hi>France.</hi> The <hi>infinite</hi> number of <hi>Terms</hi> is meant of thoſe which being thus <hi>complex'd,</hi> occur in daily Talk, as in every Family, <hi>Maſter,</hi> implying ſuch a One. Some Terms are alſo <hi>Complex'd</hi> as well in Words as Senſe; but after various manners. Thus the <hi>Prince of Philoſophers</hi> is complex'd in words, becauſe the name of <hi>Prince</hi> is determin'd by the word <hi>Philoſopher;</hi> but in reſpect of <hi>Ariſtotle,</hi> to whom the School-men are ſo addicted to give that Ti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle, it is complex'd in Senſe, when the <hi>Idea</hi> of <hi>Ariſtotle</hi> is only obvious to the mind, nor be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing expreſs'd by any Sound that denotes the Perſon.</p>
                  <p>All <hi>Adjectives</hi> or <hi>Connotatives</hi> are either Parts of <hi>Connex</hi>'d Terms, though they are clapt to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether with their Subſtances, or <hi>complex'd</hi> in Senſe, when the Subſtantives are underſtood. Becauſe, as we have ſaid in the Second Chap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter, theſe Connotative Names denote the Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject directly indeed, but more confuſedly; the <hi>Mode</hi> or <hi>Form</hi> indirectly; but more di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtinctly.</p>
                  <p>
                     <pb n="91" facs="tcp:60750:51"/>
And therefore the Idea of the Subject is very General and very confus'd, repreſenting ſometimes <hi>Entity,</hi> ſometimes a <hi>Body,</hi> which for the moſt part is determin'd by a diſtinct Form of the <hi>Idea.</hi> Thus <hi>White</hi> ſignifies a Thing that has <hi>Whiteneſs.</hi> And hence the Confus'd <hi>Idea</hi> of the Thing, is determin'd to ſignifie thoſe things only that are <hi>White:</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>However in this Matter, it is chiefly to be obſerv'd, that there are ſome <hi>Complex'd</hi> Terms, which although they be only de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>termin'd to one only <hi>Iudividual,</hi> nevertheleſs retain an <hi>Equivocal <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>niverſality,</hi> which may be call'd an <hi>
                        <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>niverſality</hi> of <hi>Error.</hi> For when men agree that one only Thing is ſignify'd by ſuch a Term, but diſpute what that <hi>only Thing</hi> really is, it happens that this Term is apply'd by ſome to ſignifie this Thing, by o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers, another Thing. Hence it is requiſite that ſuch a Term be farther determin'd ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther by the variety of Circumſtances or the Series of Diſcourſe that the ſignification of the Term may be made preciſely appa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rent.</p>
                  <p>Thus <hi>true Religion</hi> ſignifies one ſole Reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gion, which is really the <hi>Church of Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land;</hi> but becauſe all People and eve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry Hereſie think their own Religion to be trueſt, theſe <hi>Terms</hi> are highly <hi>Equivo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cate,</hi> by <hi>Equivocation</hi> of <hi>Error.</hi> For if an
<pb n="92" facs="tcp:60750:52"/>
Hiſtorian ſhould write that his Prince was moſt addicted to the <hi>true Religion,</hi> it cannot be ſaid what he means, unleſs it be known what Religion the Hiſtorian profeſs'd. For if he were a <hi>Church of England Man,</hi> it is under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtood of a Church of <hi>England</hi> Prince, or of a <hi>Mahumetan,</hi> if the <hi>Hiſtorian</hi> were an <hi>Arabian Mahumetan;</hi> and ſo of a <hi>Roman Catholic</hi> Prince; if the <hi>Author</hi> were a <hi>Roman Catho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lick.</hi>

                     <hi>Complex'd Terms,</hi> wherein there is <hi>Equivo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cation</hi> of <hi>Error</hi> cheifly comprehends thoſe Qualities of which the Senſe is no Judge, but the Mind. For men are prone to differ in their Opinion, concerning ſuch Things.</p>
                  <p>For Example, ſhould we affirm, that no Soldiers were liſted by <hi>Marius,</hi> but ſuch as were ſix foot high, this <hi>Complex'd</hi> Term, <hi>Sol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dier, ſix foot high,</hi> is not ſubject to <hi>Equivocation</hi> of <hi>Error,</hi> when it is eaſie for Soldiers to be meaſur'd, that we may know whether they be ſix foot high or no. But had it been decreed that none ſhould be liſted but ſuch as were <hi>stout,</hi> this Term had been much more liable to <hi>Equivocation,</hi> when as it might be attribu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted to ſuch Soldiers, that lookt like ſtout Men, but are indeed but meer Cowards.</p>
                  <p>This <hi>Equivocation</hi> of <hi>Error</hi> is often found in <hi>Complex'd Terms, The Chiefeſt of the Pariſian Geometricians; the most Learned, the wicked<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eſt,</hi>
                     <pb n="93" facs="tcp:60750:52"/>
                     <hi>the richeſt of Men.</hi> For though theſe Terms are divided by <hi>Individuant</hi> Conditions, ſeeing that one Perſon might be the chiefeſt of the <hi>Pariſian</hi> Geometricians; nevertheleſs this Term might be aſcrib'd to ſeveral, though proper only to one; in regard it is an eaſie thing for men to vary in their Judgments con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerning this matter; ſo that every one ſhall give this Title to him, whom he thinks to be the beſt and moſt excellent Geometrician.</p>
                  <p>Theſe Forms of Speech alſo; <hi>The Sence of the Author, what the Author declares upon this Subject,</hi> are of the Number of theſe <hi>Equivo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cates;</hi> eſpecially if the Author be ſo obſcure, that there be any Diſpute about his Senſe. And thus we find continual Altercations concern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing <hi>Ariſtotle</hi>'s Opinion of Philoſophers, while every one endeavours to draw him to their Party. For although <hi>Ariſtotle</hi> had but one Sence concerning one Thing; yet becauſe he is variouſly underſtood by ſeveral, theſe words, the <hi>Sence of Ariſtotle,</hi> are the Equivocations of Error. For every one pronounces that to be the Judgment of <hi>Aristotle,</hi> which he is perſwa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded that <hi>Aristotle</hi> meant; and ſo if ſeveral believe, That <hi>Ariſtotle</hi> had a different Opi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion of the ſame thing; theſe Terms, <hi>the Sence of Ariſtotle in ſuch a matter,</hi> though ſingular in themſelves, can never be apply'd to Many, that is to ſay, to all thoſe things, that <hi>Ariſtotle</hi>
                     <pb n="94" facs="tcp:60750:53"/>
ſhall be ſaid to have written upon ſuch a Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject; for ſo they ſhall ſignifie with every one, what every one is perſwaded the Philoſopher thought.</p>
                  <p>But that we may the better underſtand, where lies this Equivocation of <hi>Error,</hi> it is to be obſerv'd, that the Terms of it are <hi>Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>notative;</hi> either expreſly, or in ſence. Now as I have ſaid, in <hi>Connotative</hi> Terms may be conſider'd as well the Subject, which is di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rectly or confus'dly expreſs'd, as the <hi>Form</hi> or <hi>Mode</hi> which is directly and indiſtinctly ſigni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fi'd.</p>
                  <p>Thus <hi>White</hi> confuſedly denotes a body, di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtinctly <hi>Whiteneſs;</hi> thus, <hi>the Sence of Ariſtotle,</hi> confuſedly ſignifies ſome Sentence, Thought, or Doctrine of his; diſtinctly, the Relation of that Doctrine to <hi>Ariſtotle,</hi> to whom it is attributed.</p>
                  <p>However the <hi>Equivocation</hi> which is found in theſe Terms does not properly ariſe from the <hi>Form</hi> or <hi>Mode,</hi> which being diſtinct, can never vary; nor from the Subject confus'dly conſider'd, as not being freed from that con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fuſion. For Example theſe words, <hi>Prince of Philoſophers,</hi> cannot be <hi>Equivocates,</hi> in re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gard the <hi>Idea</hi> of <hi>Prince of Philoſophers</hi> can be diſtinctly apply'd to no <hi>Individual.</hi> But E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quivocation conſiſts only in This, that the Mind inſtead of the confus'd Subject ſubſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tutes
<pb n="95" facs="tcp:60750:53"/>
another which is diſtinct and determi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nate, to which <hi>Form</hi> or <hi>Manner</hi> are apply'd. But in regard men diſpute about this matter; they may aſcribe the Title of Prince or Cheif to ſeveral Perſons, and ſignalize 'em after<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards with what additional word they think moſt convenient. Thus formerly <hi>Plato</hi> was call'd the <hi>Prince of Philoſophers;</hi> which Title is now conferr'd upon <hi>Ariſtotle.</hi> Thus the words, <hi>True Religion,</hi> not having any diſtinct, but a con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fus'd <hi>Idea</hi> of any Religion, are no <hi>Equivo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cates,</hi> becauſe they denote nothing but that Religion which is abſolutely <hi>True.</hi> But when the Mind has annex'd the <hi>Idea</hi> of <hi>True Reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gion</hi> to the diſtinct <hi>Idea</hi> of ſome particular Worſhip diſtinctly known, they become e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gregious equivocates, and ſignifie that Worſhip with every one, which they account the <hi>True Religion.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>The ſame is the Condition of theſe words, <hi>That which ſuch a Philoſopher held of ſuch a Mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter.</hi> For while they abide in their general <hi>I<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dea,</hi> the general <hi>Idea</hi> ſimply and generally will ſignifie the Doctrine deliver'd by ſuch a Philoſopher concerning ſuch a Matter; as the Doctrine of <hi>Ariſtotle</hi> concerning the Nature of the Soul. Whereas the ſame words, <hi>that which,</hi> &amp;c. that is to ſay, this Doctrine, while it is under a confus'd <hi>Idea</hi> apply'd to no di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtinct <hi>Idea,</hi> is not capable of <hi>Equivocation.</hi>
                     <pb n="96" facs="tcp:60750:54"/>
But when the Mind inſtead of that Doctrine confus'dly conceiv'd, ſubſtitutes a diſtinct Doc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trine, &amp; a diſtinct Subject; then according to the variety of diſtinct <hi>Ideas,</hi> that ſame <hi>That which,</hi> &amp;c. may be liable to <hi>Equivocation.</hi> Thus the Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrine of <hi>Ariſtotle</hi> touching the Nature of the Soul is an Equivocate with <hi>Pomponatius,</hi> who aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerts that <hi>Ariſtotle</hi> believ'd the Soul to be Mor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tal; and with ſeveral others of his Interpreters, who on the other ſide affirm that <hi>Ariſtotle</hi> taught the Immortality of the Soul, as well as <hi>Plato</hi> and <hi>Socrates.</hi> Hence it is, that words of this nature moſt frequently ſignify the thing with which the form indirectly expreſs'd cannot agree. Suppoſe for example's ſake, that <hi>Philip</hi> was not the Father of <hi>Alexander,</hi> as <hi>Alexander</hi> himſelf endeavoured to make out; theſe words, the <hi>Son</hi> of <hi>Philip,</hi> denoting Generality, any perſon begot by <hi>Philip,</hi> erro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neouſly ſpoken of <hi>Alexander,</hi> denote the per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon that is not really the Son of <hi>Philip.</hi> In like manner theſe words, the <hi>Sence of Scripture</hi> alledg'd by a Quaker, to prove a Sect quite contrary to Scripture ſhall denote that very Sect in his Mouth, which he thinks to be ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to the Sence of Scripture, and which he has therefore dignify'd with that name, of the <hi>Sence of Scripture;</hi> nor are the Papiſts more in the right then they, who pretending to adhere to the <hi>Word of God;</hi>
                     <pb n="97" facs="tcp:60750:54"/>
for among them the <hi>word of God,</hi> ſignifies that <hi>O<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>glio</hi> of Superſtitions which they would obtrude upon the Proteſtants inſtead of Gods Word.</p>

                  <head>CHAP. VIII. <hi>Of the Clearneſs and Diſtinction of</hi> Ideas, <hi>as alſo of their Obſcurity and Confuſion.</hi>
                  </head>
                  <p>IN <hi>Ideas</hi> clearneſs may be diſcern'd from <hi>Diſtinction,</hi> and obſcurity from confu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion; for we may call that a clear <hi>Idea,</hi> when it imprints in us a lively, as I may call it, Sence of it ſelf, whereas otherwiſe it may not be ſo diſtinct. The Idea of Pain becauſe it ſtrikes us ſo ſenſibly, may be call'd a <hi>Clear Idea;</hi> but yet it is confus'd, becauſe it repre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſents <hi>Pain</hi> to us, as being in the Hand, when indeed it lies in the Sence.</p>
                  <p>Nevertheleſs we may call every <hi>Idea</hi> clear, ſo far as it is diſtinct; for all obſcurity ariſes out of Confuſion. Thus the ſence of the Pain that hurts us is clear and alſo diſtinct; but what is confus'd in the Feeling, that is to ſay, that the <hi>Pain</hi> is in the hand, cannot be ſaid to be clear.</p>
                  <p>Now becauſe <hi>Clearneſs</hi> and Diſtinction are one and the ſame in <hi>Ideas,</hi> it will be very re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quiſite to examine why ſome <hi>Ideas</hi> are clear, others confus'd.</p>
                  <p>
                     <pb n="98" facs="tcp:60750:55"/>
But this will be more apparent by the help of examples, then any other way, and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore let us weave together a Catalogue of the firſt <hi>Ideas,</hi> as well clear and diſtinct, as ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcure and confus'd.</p>
                  <p>The moſt clear <hi>Idea</hi> is that which every Man has of himſelf, as of the <hi>Thing that thinks;</hi> as alſo the <hi>Ideas</hi> of thoſe other Appendixes to our thoughts, as to <hi>Judg, Diſcourſe, De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liberate, Perceive, Imagine.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Ideas</hi> of extended <hi>Subſtances</hi> alſo are moſt chiefly clear to us, as alſo the <hi>Ideas</hi> of their Properties; as <hi>Figures, Motion, Reſt;</hi> for tho' we may feign that there is no Body, no Figure, (tho' we cannot feign any ſuch thing of the thinking Subſtance, while we think) yet we cannot ſay we clearly perceive what is <hi>Extenſion</hi> and <hi>Figure.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>We alſo clearly apprehend <hi>Duration, Or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der,</hi> and <hi>Number,</hi> ſo that we conſider the <hi>Du<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration</hi> of any thing to be form, under which we conſider the thing, ſo long as the form continues in it. Thus order and number no way differ in effect from things Order'd and Number'd.</p>
                  <p>All theſe <hi>Ideas</hi> are ſo clear, that we fre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quently render 'em more obſcure, while we endeavour to illuſtrate 'em with new Ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſervations, and frame to our ſelves other <hi>Ide<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>as</hi> then thoſe which we have from Nature.</p>
                  <p>
                     <pb n="99" facs="tcp:60750:55"/>
We may alſo ſay, that the <hi>Idea</hi> of <hi>God</hi> is clear in one reſpect, tho' in another moſt ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcure and imperfect.</p>
                  <p>It is clear, becauſe it ſuffices to diſcover the great number of Attributes in God, which we certainly know are no where elſe to be found but in God, but it is obſcure in reſpect of that <hi>Idea</hi> which the Bleſſed have of him in Heaven. And it is alſo Imperfect, in regard our Minds being limited and finite, cannot but moſt Imperfectly conceive an infinite <hi>Being;</hi> for Perfection and Clearrieſs in <hi>Ideas</hi> are two different things. For they are <hi>Perfect,</hi> when they repreſent to us whatever is in the Object; <hi>Clear</hi> when they repreſent to us as much as ſuffices to apprehend the object clearly and diſtinctly.</p>
                  <p>On the other ſide they are confus'd and obſcure <hi>Ideas</hi> which we have of <hi>Senſible Qua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lities;</hi> as of <hi>Colours, Sounds, Odors, Taſts, Cold, Heat, Ponderoſity,</hi> &amp;c. As alſo thoſe of our deſires, as of Hunger, Thirſt, Pain, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> Now mark the reaſon of the Obſcurity of theſe <hi>Ideas.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>In regard we were firſt Children before we were Men, and that exterior things operating within us, ſtirr'd up various Senſations in our Mind by the help of thoſe Impreſſions which they made in our Bodies; the Mind conſcious that thoſe Senſations are affected againſt her
<pb n="100" facs="tcp:60750:56"/>
will, and that by ſome Body's (as for example the Senſation of heat by the Eire) would not only judg that there were ſome things without her, which were the cauſes of theſe Senſations, (wherein ſhe was not deceiv'd) but going farther, imagin'd ſomething in the Objects, altogether like Senſation, or at leaſt like the <hi>Ideas</hi> thence ariſing. Upon theſe Conſidera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions therefore, ſhe form'd <hi>Ideas</hi> to her ſelf, and transfer'd the Senſations of <hi>Heat, Cold, &amp;c.</hi> into thoſe things that are without her. And by that means thoſe confuſed and obſcure <hi>I<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deas</hi> of ſenſible qualities aroſe from hence, that the Mind intermix'd her own falſe Judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments with thoſe that ſhe deriv'd from Nature.</p>
                  <p>Now in regard theſe <hi>Ideas</hi> are not natural but <hi>Arbitrary,</hi> Men have made a moſt fanta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtical uſe of 'em, and turn'd 'em into meer <hi>Chimeras;</hi> for tho' that <hi>Heat</hi> and <hi>Burning</hi> are two ſorts of <hi>Senſation;</hi> the one weaker, the other fiercer, we have allow'd heat to the Fire, affirming Fire to be endu'd with Heat, yet we have depriv'd Fire of the burning faculty, or of the pain which we feel in ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proaching too near it, denying Fire to be af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fected with Pain.</p>
                  <p>But if Men had rightly apprehended that <hi>Pain</hi> is not to be attributed to the Fire that burns the Hand; yet had they been in ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther error, while they thought pain to be in
<pb n="101" facs="tcp:60750:56"/>
the hand which the Fire burns, when as pain is only in the Senſe.</p>
                  <p>This was not only the Opinion of ſome of the antient Philoſopers, as the <hi>Cyrenarchs,</hi> but even of St. <hi>Austin</hi> himſelf; <hi>For</hi> ſays he <hi>in his</hi> 14 <hi>Book, de civitat. dei, Pains ſaid to be Pains of the Fleſh, are pains of the Soul in the Fleſh and out of the Fleſh; for pain of the Fleſh is only an Injury to the Soul, and a certain diſſent from its ſuffering: as the Pain of the Soul, which is Sadneſs, is a diſſent from thoſe things that befal us againſt our Wills.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Thus in his ſeventh Book upon <hi>Geneſis. C.</hi> 19. <hi>When the Soul feels the Afflictions of the Bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy, ſhe is offended in her act of Government of the Body, her Rule being diſturb'd, and this of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fence is call'd Pain.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Now that that <hi>Pain</hi> which is call'd the <hi>Pain</hi> of the Body, belongs to the Soul and not to the Body, is manifeſt from this, that thoſe things that affect us with Pain, ſeldom trou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble us when our minds are intent upon other things, as we ſind by the <hi>Affrican</hi> Prieſt, (of whom <hi>St. Auſtin L.</hi> 14. <hi>de Civitat. dei C.</hi> 24. <hi>Who when pleas'd, upon the Counterfeiting of Groans and Lamentations,</hi> would ſo abſtract himſelf from <hi>his Senſes, and lye as it were for Dead, that they could not make him ſenſible of Pinching and Pricking, nor of the heat of Fire, till it began to ſcorch his Skin.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>
                     <pb n="102" facs="tcp:60750:57"/>
Moreover it is to be obſerv'd, that neither the ill diſpoſition of the hand, nor any motion a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riſing from burning, cauſes the Soul to be ſenſible of the Pain, unleſs this Motion be Communicated to the Brain, by certain ſmall Strings included in the Nerves, and extended from the Brain to the Hands, and other parts of the Body, which cannot be mov'd unleſs that part of the Body be alſo mov'd from whence they derive themſelves. So that if there be any accident that hinders theſe little Strings from communicating their motion to the Brain (as in the <hi>Palſy)</hi> a Man may en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dure Wounds and Pain without any Sence of Pain. Inſomuch that what appears yet more ſtrange, a Man may have a pain in his hands that wants hands, as often it happens to thoſe whoſe hands are cut off; for that if the threads of the Nerves extended from the Hand to the Brain be mov'd near the Elbow, where they terminate, they may move that part of the Brain to which they are faſtened, in the ſame manner as it might be mov'd, if the ſame threads deſcended to the hand, as the one end of a ſmall Rope may be moved in the ſame manner, if drawn about the mid<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dle, as if pull'd at the other extremity; and thus the Soul ſhould feel the ſame Pain as it would feel if the Perſon had hands. For the Soul directs its attentiveneſs thither from
<pb n="103" facs="tcp:60750:57"/>
whence that motion of the Brain us'd to pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceed, which before affected it with that ſort of Pain. Thus the Reflections that we be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hold in a Glaſs appear in the ſame place where they would be, ſhould they be lookt upon with direct beams, as being the moſt uſual manner of beholding Objects.</p>
                  <p>And theſe things ſhall ſuffice to let us un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtand that it may well be, that a Soul ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parated from the Body may be liable to the Torments of Hell-Fire, and to feel the ſame Pain, as any one would feel through the tor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures of Earthly Fire; in regard that when it was join'd to the Body, it was not the Body but the Soul that felt the pain of the Fire, and that pain was nothing but a certain ſadneſs of the Mind wherewith it was afflicted for the ſuffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rings of the Body, to which it was join'd by God. Why then may we not conceive that di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vine Juſtice may ſo accommodate ſome part of the material Body to the ſeparate Soul, that the motion of that matter may excite trouble<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſome and afflicting thoughts in the Soul ſo ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parated.</p>
                  <p>But let us return to confus'd <hi>Ideas.</hi> The <hi>Idea</hi> of Ponderoſity is no leſs confus'd then any of the reſt already recited; for having obſerv'd from our Infancy, that Stones and other heavy things fall down as ſoon as let go out of our hands, we form'd an <hi>Idea</hi> of
<pb n="104" facs="tcp:60750:58"/>
the thing falling which is genuine and true. We alſo form'd an <hi>Idea</hi> of the reaſon why the thing does fall, which is true likewiſe; but when we only ſaw the Stone, and nothing elſe that forc'd it downward, out of the raſhneſs of our Judgment we concluded that there was no ſuch thing as what we did not ſee, and therefore that the Stone fell by ver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tue of its own proper and intrinſic Force, and at length we affix'd to this confuſed <hi>Idea,</hi> coin'd only in our own Judgments the name of Ponderoſity.</p>
                  <p>It came to paſs alſo that we made diffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rent Judgments of the ſame things of which the ſame Judgment was to be aſſerted, for as we ſaw Stones mov'd toward the Earth, we found straw move toward Jet, and Steel toward the Loadſtone. Therefore the ſame Reaſon that bequeathes that quality to Stones to be mov'd toward the Earth, ought to al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low the ſame qualities to Straw and Iron for moving towards Jet and the Loadſtone. However this would not ſatisfy; but on the contrary we have aſſign'd to Jet, Amber, and the Loadſtone certain qualities which we call <hi>Attractive,</hi> when with the ſame eaſe we might have endu'd the Earth with the ſame quality of attracting heavy things. However theſe attractive qualities, (as alſo Ponderoſity it ſelf) ſprang from Illegitimate <hi>Ratiocina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion,</hi>
                     <pb n="105" facs="tcp:60750:58"/>
by which it was concluded, that Iron was neceſſarily attracted by the Loadſtone, becauſe there was nothing ſeen that puſh'd the Iron toward the Magnet; whereas it can never be conceiv'd, that one Body ſhould attract another, unleſs the Body attracting be mov'd, and the Body attracted be faſten'd to it.</p>
                  <p>To theſe Judgments of our infancy we owe for thoſe <hi>Ideas</hi> that repreſent to us Pon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derous and hard things, more ſolid then Light and thin, and having more Body or Matter. Thus we believe that a Veſſel full of Gold contains more matter then if it were fill'd with Air, for thoſe <hi>Ideas</hi> deriv'd themſelves from no other Foundation, then that when we were Children we were wont to make ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trinſical Judgments of all things, according to their Actions in reference to us. Hence becauſe ponderous and hard Bodies acted more violently then Light and Thin, we con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cluded that they contain'd more Subſtance then the other. When true Reaſon tells us, that the ſame part of matter poſſeſſes the ſame ſpace, and the ſame ſpace is always fill'd with the ſame quantity of Matter.</p>
                  <p>So that a Cubic Veſſel of a Foot will con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain no more Matter, being fill'd with Gold then Air. Nay, in ſome Sence it may be ſaid that being fill'd with Air, it contains more
<pb n="106" facs="tcp:60750:59"/>
matter for a Reaſon not now longer here to be inſiſted on.</p>
                  <p>It may be ſaid that from the ſame Root of fore-judging of things, ſprang the fooliſh o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pinions of ſome, that our Souls are either the thinneſt part of the Air compos'd of <hi>A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>toms,</hi> according to <hi>Democritus</hi> with the <hi>Epi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cureans,</hi> or the Air kindled, as the <hi>Stoicks;</hi> or a particle of Celeſtial Light, as the <hi>Mani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cheans,</hi> or of later days <hi>Flud;</hi> or a ſuttle Wind, as the <hi>Socinians;</hi> for none of theſe could ever perſwade themſelves that Wood, Stones or Durt could ever be capable of thinking. And therefore <hi>Cicero</hi> at the ſame time that he aſſerts with the <hi>Stoicks,</hi> our Soul to be a ſuttle Flame, places it among abſurdi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties, not to be endu'd to think it ſhould e're derive its Original from Earth or thick Air; <hi>For</hi> ſaith he, <hi>I beſeech ye, is it poſſible to think that ſuch a force and maſs of Memory was ever ſowed in the Earth to ſpring up again, or thicken'd together out of Cloudy and Foggy Air?</hi> For they believ'd that the more ſuttle and pure they made the matter, ſo much the leſs ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terial, the leſs thick and corporeal it would be, that ſo at length they might rarify it into a <hi>thing of Thought,</hi> which however is very ri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diculous; for a Body is not thinner then a Body, only that it is divided into leſſer par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticles, and more eaſily agitated. For thus on

the other ſide it makes leſs reſiſtance then o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther Bodies; on the other it more eaſily pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>netrates their Pores. But whether it be indi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viſible or divided, whether it reſt or be mov'd, however it is not leſs material, leſs corporeal, or more capacious of Thought, it being impoſſible that the motion or figure of the Matter whether ſuttle or thick ſhould have any thing common with Cogitation; or that a certain part of the matter that never thought, when it reſted like the Earth, or was gently mov'd like the Water, ſhould come to a knowledg of it ſelf upon a more vehe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment Motion or augmenting the force of A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gitation.</p>

                  <p>There is one Remedy for this miſchief, to caſt away all prejudicate opinions ingraft<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed in our Infancy, and to aſſert nothing of what it belongs to Reaſon to pronounce, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe we ſo judg'd it heretofore, but becauſe we now judg it to be ſo upon Examination.

are puſh'd down by ſome certain cauſe; not determining any thing of what is in the Fire that cauſes that burning, or of the cauſe that makes the Stone fall down till I find my know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledg confirm'd by clear Reaſons.</p>

                  <head>CHAP. IX. <hi>Some Examples of confus'd and obſcure</hi> Ideas <hi>drawn from</hi> Ethics.</head>
                  <p>IN the former Chapters we have brought ſome Examples of confus'd <hi>Ideas,</hi> which for the reaſons given we legally aſſert to be falſe; But being all taken out of Phyſicks, it may not be from the purpoſe to produce ſome others out of <hi>Ethics,</hi> in regard that falſe <hi>Ide<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>as,</hi> which are form'd of Vertues and Vices, are far more dangerous.</p>
                  <p>Nor indeed is any one more happy, or more unhappy becauſe he has a true or falſe, a clear or obſcure <hi>Idea</hi> of <hi>Ponderoſity, Senſible Qualities, or the Senſes.</hi> If in thoſe things he be more or leſs knowing, he will neither be the better nor the worſe; whatever our opi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion be touching thoſe things, we ſhall never
<pb n="109" facs="tcp:60750:60"/>
alter it for our own ſakes. Their Being is in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dependant from our knowledge, and the Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duct of our Life is Independant from their Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing. So that all Men are allow'd to await that Knowledg which ſhall be our portion after this Life, and to leave the Government of the World to the Goodneſs and Wiſdom of God who governs it.</p>
                  <p>But no Man can excuſe himſelf from en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deavouring to acquire a right Information concerning Vertue and Vice, becauſe that from the preſcripts of Judgments made upon theſe things, our Lives are to be go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vern'd, our Manners compos'd, and the E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ternity of good or evil to be expected.</p>
                  <p>And as the falſe <hi>Ideas</hi> of Vertue and Vice are the reaſon that we judg amiſs of 'em; ſo in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>finitely better would it be to know and amend theſe with Care and Induſtry, then to ſtudy the rectifying of thoſe other, which precipitancy of Judgment, or the prejudicate errors of Youth have obtruded upon us in reference to natu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral things, which can only ſupply Matter for lean and barren Speculation.</p>
                  <p>To diſcover all thoſe falſe <hi>Ideas,</hi> would require a Tranſcription of the whole Body of <hi>Ethics;</hi> but our only deſign here is to pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe certain Examples of the manner, how they are form'd by annexing together ſeveral <hi>Ideas</hi> that are not really annexed, which
<pb n="110" facs="tcp:60750:61"/>
produces ſeveral vain and idle Phantoms, which Men never ceaſe hunting after, and miſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rably waſte their time in hopes to attain that which is of no value when attain'd.</p>
                  <p>Man finds in himſelf the <hi>Ideas</hi> of Miſery and Happineſs, which is neither falſe nor confus'd, while general and abſtracted: He has alſo the <hi>Ideas</hi> of Baſeneſs and Excellency. He covets Happineſs, avoids Miſery; he ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mires Excellency, deſpiſes Baſeneſs.</p>
                  <p>But the Contamination of Sin, which has a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lienated God from Man, in whom alone he could have found true felicity, and to whom alone he ought to affix the <hi>Idea</hi> of it, has af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fix'd this <hi>Idea</hi> of Happineſs to an Innumera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble company of other things. To the Love and Proſecution of which Man is carried headlong, as if he thought to recover his loſt felicity in <hi>them.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Hence has ariſen a vaſt heap of falſe and obſcure <hi>Ideas,</hi> while every one thinks he ſhall be happy in the poſſeſſion of what he loves; miſerable, if depriv'd of it. But Man has loſt his true Nobility, and real Excellen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy by Sinning. Hence, that he may love him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf, he is conſtrain'd to repreſent himſelf to himſelf, other then what indeed he is, and to hide his Indigencies and Miſeries from him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf; to add many things to the <hi>Idea</hi> of him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf, which belong not to him to the end he
<pb n="111" facs="tcp:60750:61"/>
may appear Greater and more <hi>Auguſt.</hi> And now behold the common Series of theſe falſe <hi>Ideas.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>The firſt and chiefeſt is the propenſity of Concupiſcence to the Pleaſures of the Sence, ariſing from ſome exterior things: For when the Soul perceives that her darling Pleaſures proceed from thoſe things, ſhe immediately joyns the <hi>Idea</hi> of good to thoſe things, and the <hi>Idea</hi> of bad to thoſe other things that de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prive her of thoſe Pleaſures. And obſerving afterwards that Power and Riches are the u<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſual Inſtruments, whereby to acquire the means to indulge Concupiſcence, ſhe be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gins to eſteem theſe for great Happineſſes, and pronounces for Bleſſed, the Rich and Potent that enjoy 'em; the poor miſerable, for being depriv'd of theſe Delights.</p>
                  <p>But now as Felicity has always Excellency for her Companion, the Mind never ſeparates thoſe two <hi>Ideas,</hi> but always looks upon as great, all thoſe that ſhe conſiders as happy, and as little and mean, all thoſe that are poor and unhappy. And this is the reaſon that we con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>temn the poor, and admire the opulent. But theſe are ſuch unjuſt and falſe Judgments, that St. <hi>Thomas</hi> believes, it is this worſhip and ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miration of Riches, which is ſo much con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demn'd by St. <hi>James</hi> the Apoſtle, while he for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bids a more honourable place to be aſſign'd to
<pb n="112" facs="tcp:60750:62"/>
the Rich then to the Poor; tho' this place is not to be ſo literally expounded, as if we were not to ſhew ſome outward-veneration to the Rich, which is not due to the Poor; ſeeing that the order of the World, which Religion does not diſturb, requires it, and this practiſe has been all along obſerv'd among men, high<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly eminent for their Piety. And therefore it is to be underſtood of that inward reſpect, which looks upon the Poor as ſubjected under the Feet of the Rich, and the Rich as infi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nitely exalted above the Poor.</p>
                  <p>But though theſe Ideas and the judgments that ariſe from thence are falſe and unreaſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able, yet are they common to all men that have not rectifi'd 'em, as proceeding from concupiſcence with which all men are infected. Hence it happens that we not only think ſo honourably of the Rich, but that we alſo know that all other Mortals render 'em the ſame honour and eſteem. So that we repre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent to our ſelves their Condition not only as environ'd with all ſplendour and advantages that attend it, but worſhip it with all that inward Adoration of Judgments with which we flatter the Wealthy, and are known not only by the Common Diſcourſe of Men, but by our own Experience.</p>
                  <p>This Phantome of a Rich man, whom the Croud of his admirers ſurround, gaze upon
<pb n="113" facs="tcp:60750:62"/>
with fixed Eyes, and reverence with an inward Worſhip of Fear, obſervance and abject ſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vility, is the true Idol of the Ambitious, for for whoſe ſake they endure ſo many miſeries and throw themſelves into ſo many dangers.</p>
                  <p>Now that it may appear that this is that which they all covet and adore, let us ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe that there were but one only man in the World endu'd with Reaſon, and all the reſt men meerly in ſhape, were all but Statues mov'd by Engines; and that that one Think<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing Man, knowing well that all thoſe Statues that reſembl'd him outwardly, were all de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>priv'd of reaſon and thought, had a ſecret way to move 'em by certain Springs ſo that they might perform all the Offices which he had a mind to require from men; we may be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve this Perſon would ſometimes take plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure to divertiſe himſelf with the ſeveral Movments he ſhould give to theſe Statues; but certainly he could never delight himſelf or take any pride in the Honours, Bows and Cringes that they made him: rather he would be as weary of 'em as of ſo many Puppets; and at length would ſatisfie himſelf with ſuch a train as ſhould ſuffice for neceſſary Services, without deſiring any greater number of theſe Statues then ſhould be for his uſe.</p>
                  <p>So that it is not the ſimple and external Obe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dience of Attendants ſeperated from the inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal
<pb n="114" facs="tcp:60750:63"/>
ſubmiſſion of the Mind that is the Object of aſpiring Ambition. 'Tis Dominion over men not Statues which they covet; and the plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure of thoſe that Rule proceeds from the im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſions of Fear, eſteem and admiration which they imprint in others.</p>
                  <p>From whence it is manifeſt that the Idea with which they are blinded is no leſs vain and empty, then the Idea of thoſe whom we properly call <hi>Vain-glorious</hi> men, who are they that feed themſelves with Praiſes, Eulogies, Titles, and other things of this nature: The only thing that diſtinguiſhes the one from the other is the ſingle difference of Opinions and Judgments, which both are deſirous to com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>municate to others. For as it is the main de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſire of the <hi>Vain-Glorious</hi> to excite in others a ſenſe of Love and Eſteem for their Know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledg, Eloquence, Wit, and Dexterity; 'tis the delight of the ambitious to excite in others motions of Terrour, of Obedience and Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſſion to their Grandeur, and Ideas conform<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able to thoſe judgments, by means whereof they appear formidable, exalted and Potent. So that both the one and the other place their happineſs in the Thoughts of another: but the one make choice of one ſort of Thoughts, the other of another.</p>
                  <p>There is nothing more common then to ſee theſe vain Phantomes compos'd of the falſe
<pb n="115" facs="tcp:60750:63"/>
Judgments of men, how they overturn Enter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prizes of greateſt importance, as being the principal mark to which all the Actions of our lives are directed.</p>
                  <p>That ſame Valour ſo highly eſteem'd in the World, which cauſes them that would be ſignaliz'd for brave and ſtout, to throw them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves into the moſt apparent and threatning dangers, is no more oft times then an over ear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſt bending the Mind to theſe vain and ſhal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low Things that fill the Brain. Few Perſons when they are ſerious deſpiſe Life, and they who ſeem to dare death at a Breach or in a Battel, tremble like others and frequently are more afraid when Death attacques 'em in their Beds. But this ſame bravery of theirs which they ſhew upon ſundry Occaſions proceeds from hence; that they have ſtill hovering be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore their Eyes the reproaches thrown upon Cowards and Puſilanimous Creatures; and on the other ſide the applauſes which are gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven to the Valiant; and the Phantoſm ariſing from theſe two Conſiderations ſo poſſeſſes their Minds, that they have no leiſure to think upon Death.</p>
                  <p>For this reaſon the Perſon that is moſt con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſant in the ſight of men, becomes the moſt Generous and Brave; and that, becauſe of the Judgments which other men make of him. Hence it comes to paſs that the Captains are
<pb n="116" facs="tcp:60750:64"/>
more couragious then the Common Souldiers, and that the Nobility and Gentry carry more lofty minds then the Ordinary Sort of People. For that having more honour to looſe and to acquire, they are more ſenſible and jealous of it. The ſame labours, ſaid a great Captain, are not equally toylſome to a General of an Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>my and a Common Soldier: For the Captain of an Army, upon whom the Eyes of all men are fix'd, is thruſt forward to difficult under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>takings, whereas a Common Souldier dilates his thoughts no farther then the hopes of his Pay, or the gains of Plunder, or the Repu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation of being ſtout, which ſeldom extends beyond his own Regiment.</p>
                  <p>What do they propoſe to themſelves that build ſuch ſtately Fabricks above their Condition and their Fortune? Not the ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vantage of commodious living therein. For ſuch a coſtly Magnificence does 'em more harm then good; and it is evident, that if they were alone in the World, they would never put themſelves to that Charge and trouble; or if they thought they ſhould be deſpis'd by all that ſaw thoſe Houſes. Therefore the Houſes are built for the ſake of others that they think will applaud the Buildings. They imagine that all that ſhall behold thoſe Pala<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces, will entertain motions of Reſpect and Admiration for the Maſter. And therefore
<pb n="117" facs="tcp:60750:64"/>
they repreſent themſelves to themſelves as in a Theater, ſitting in the midſt of their Palaces environ'd with erouds of People, that behold all from top to bottom, and thence conceive 'em Great, Potent, Happy and Magnificent; and this <hi>Idea</hi> filling their Minds, ſpurs 'em on to thoſe expences and to be at that trou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble.</p>
                  <p>Why do men load their Coaches with ſuch a great number of Lacqueys? Not for the great ſervice they do, for they are rather a trouble then a Convenience; but to imprint in the minds of the beholders an <hi>Idea,</hi> that it is ſome perſon of great Quality that paſſes by; and the proſpect of that <hi>Idea,</hi> which they i<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>magine the ſight of a Coach ſo loaden will create in the beholders, ſatisfies the vanity of him to whom thoſe Coaches belong.</p>
                  <p>And thus, if we weigh in the ſame ballance all Conditions, all Employments, all Profeſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons that are eſteem'd in the World, we ſhall find that that which renders 'em delightful, and alleviates the pains and toyl that attends 'em, is this, that they repreſent to the Mind the <hi>Ideas</hi> of Reſpect Eſteem, Fear and Admira<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion that others have for us. On the other ſide, that which renders ſolitude tedious to the moſt part of the World, is this, that in ſeperating themſelves from the view, they alſo ſeperate themſelves from the judgments and thoughts
<pb n="118" facs="tcp:60750:65"/>
of men. For ſo their hearts become empty and famiſh'd as being depriv'd of their uſual nouriſhment, and not finding in themſelves, wherewithal to feed their Thoughts. And therefore the Heathen Philoſophers deem'd a ſolitary Life ſo inſupportable; that they ſcrupl'd, not to aver, that a wiſe man would not be bound to enjoy all the bleſſings of Bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy and Mind, to live alone; and not to have any perſon to whom he might impart his hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pineſs by diſcourſe. And indeed there is no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing but the Chriſtian Religion that can ren<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der Solitude deſirable; for becauſe it teaches men to deſpiſe the World, it affords 'em at the ſame time other Objects to employ the mind and more worthy to fill the heart, for which they have no need of the ſight and commerce of Company.</p>
                  <p>But here it is to be obſerv'd, that the de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſires of men do not terminate in knowing the thoughts and judgments of others concerning themſelves; but being known, they make a farther uſe of 'em to aggrandiſe and exalt the <hi>Idea</hi> which they have of themſelves, adding to <hi>them,</hi> and incorporating other Aſcititious and Forreign <hi>Ideas,</hi> and imagining through a groſs deluſion that they are really greater, be cauſe they live in a larger Houſe, and that there are more people who admire 'em. Though all theſe things are extrinſecal as to
<pb n="119" facs="tcp:60750:65"/>
themſelves, and belong not to 'em at all; nor can the thoughts of other men preſerve or vindicate 'em from the want and miſery to which they were before obnoxious.</p>
                  <p>From whence we may diſcover what it is that renders agreeable to men ſeveral things which otherwiſe are altogether incapable to divert and delight the mind. For the rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon of the pleaſure that men take therein a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riſes from this, that the <hi>Idea</hi> of themſelves re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſents 'em to themſelves greater then ordina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry, by means of ſome vain circumſtance which they add to it.</p>
                  <p>They take delight in diſcourſing óf the dangers they have run, as forming from the ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cidents an Idea which repreſents us to our ſelves either as prudent, or elſe particularly favour'd by God. We love to diſcourſe of ſickneſſes we have eſcap'd, as repreſenting to our ſelves the ſtrength of our Bodies, able to encounter ſuch deſperate attacks of Mor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tality.</p>
                  <p>We love to be Victorious in every thing, e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven in Play, wherein there is nothing of cun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing but all hazard, though we do not play for gain; adding to our own <hi>Idea</hi> the Idea of Hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pineſs at the ſame time. This imaginary hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pineſs we are apt to think, belongs to us, as a permanent Quality, which makes us claim the ſame ſucceſs for the future as our Right. Thus
<pb n="120" facs="tcp:60750:66"/>
Gameſters chuſe to try the Fortune of the Dice with ſome before others: which is ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vertheleſs very ridiculous: for a man may be ſaid to have liv'd happily to ſuch a moment; but that he ſhall have the ſame Fortune the next hour; there is no farther probability, but that we may be as certain that they who have been hitherto miſerable, may for the fu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture be happy.</p>
                  <p>And thus their Minds who are addicted to the World, have no other Objects of their deſires, then theſe vain Chimera's that daily diſtract their Brains; and even they who carry the greateſt reputation for wiſdom, feed them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves with theſe Dreams and Deluſions. And therefore only they who direct their Lives and the Action of their Lives to Eternal Things, may be ſaid to fix their thoughts upon real, ſolid, and permanent Objects, when all o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers do but follow vanity and empty No<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing, and give themſelves over to Lies and Errours.</p>

                  <head>CHAP. X. <hi>Of another Cauſe of Confuſion in our Thoughts and Diſcourſe;</hi> Ideas <hi>annex'd to Words.</hi>
                  </head>
                  <p>WE have already ſaid that the Neceſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty we have to make uſe of Exter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal ſigns to expreſs our Minds, is the reaſon that we fix <hi>Ideas</hi> to words in ſuch a manner, that many times we conſider the words more then the things.</p>
                  <p>For it is to be obſerv'd, that tho' Men have frequently different <hi>Ideas</hi> of the ſame things, nevertheleſs they make uſe of the ſame words to expreſs 'em; as the <hi>Idea</hi> which a Heathen Philoſopher has of Vertue, is not the ſame which a Divine hath, yet both expreſs their <hi>Idea</hi> by the ſame word <hi>Vertue.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Moreover the ſame Men at different Ages have conſider'd the ſame things after very different Manners; and yet they have ram<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maſs'd all theſe <hi>Ideas</hi> under one name: which is the reaſon that in pronouncing the word or hearing it pronoun'cd, a Man is preſently Confounded, apprehending the word ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times according to one <hi>Idea,</hi> ſometimes ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to another. For Example, a Man
<pb n="122" facs="tcp:60750:67"/>
underſtanding that he has ſomething within him, whatever it be, which is the occaſion of his Nouriſhment and Growth, has call'd it a <hi>Soul,</hi> and has extended this <hi>Idea</hi> not only to what reſembles it in Animals, but in Plants.</p>
                  <p>And perceiving alſo that he had <hi>Thoughts,</hi> he has call'd this principle of <hi>Thought</hi> by the Name of the Soul. Whence it has come to paſs that by this Reſemblance of the name, he has taken for the ſame thing, the princi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple of Thought, and the principle of Nou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riſhment and Growth. In like manner the name of <hi>Life</hi> is given to that Faculty from whence the Animal functions proceed, as al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſo the Cogitative Faculty, which are two things abſolutely different.</p>
                  <p>Thus theſe words, <hi>Sence</hi> and <hi>Senſation,</hi> when they are ſpoken of any of the five Sen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes, are vehemently peſter'd with <hi>Equivocati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons.</hi> For three things happen to us when we make uſe of our Senſes, as 1. when we ſee any thing. There is a Motion in the Corporeal Organs, as the Brain and Eye. 2. Theſe motions give an occaſion to the Soul to per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive ſomething. As when by the motions firſt begun in the Eye, by the reflexion of the Light, in the falling Rain oppos'd to the Sun-Beams, it has the <hi>Ideas</hi> of Red, Blew, and Yellow. 3. We make a Judgment of what
<pb n="123" facs="tcp:60750:67"/>
we ſee; and thus we judg theſe Colours to belong to the Rainbow, which we pronounce to be of ſuch a Magnitude, of ſuch a Figure, and at ſuch a diſtance from us. Of theſe three the firſt only belongs to the Body; the other two ſolely to the Mind; however by oc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>caſion of what is perform'd in the Body. Nevertheleſs we comprehend all theſe three things under the name of the <hi>Sence</hi> or <hi>Senſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion</hi> of the Sight or Hearing. For when we ſay the Eye ſees, or the Ear hears, it cannot be underſtood but according to the Corpore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>al Organ; it being apparent that the Eye does not apprehend the objects which it ſees, nor judg of 'em. On the other ſide we do not ſay we have ſeen ſuch a one, if the mind call'd off by another object has not made re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flection upon the perſon that preſented him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf before our Eyes. And then we take the word <hi>See</hi> for the thought form'd in our Mind, in purſuit of what paſs'd in our Eye and in our Brain. And according to this Significa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of the word <hi>See,</hi> it is the Soul and not the body which ſees, as <hi>Plato</hi> maintains and <hi>Cicero</hi> after him. <hi>For indeed</hi> ſaith he, <hi>we do not now behold with our Eyes the thing which we ſee; for there is no ſence in the Body. There are as it were certain Paſſages made from the ſeat of the Soul to the Eyes, the Ears and Noſe, and therefore ſeeing often interrupted either by ſome</hi>
                     <pb n="124" facs="tcp:60750:68"/>
                     <hi>thought, or the force of ſome Diſeaſe, we neither hear nor ſee with open or entire Eyes or Ears. Whence we may eaſily apprehend that the Soul both hears and ſees, not thoſe parts which are but as the Windows of the Soul.</hi> In ſhort, we take thoſe words <hi>Senſation</hi> of Sight, Hearing, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> for the laſt of theſe three things, that is, for the Judgments which the Soul makes in pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſuance of the Preceptions it has made, by occaſion of what paſs'd in the Corporeal Organs, as when we ſay the Sences are de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiv'd, at the ſame time that we ſee a crook<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed Stick ſo appearing in the Water, or the Sun but two foot in Diameter. For it is cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain there can be no Error or Falſity neither in thoſe things that happen in the Corporeal Or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gans, nor in the bare Perception of the Soul, which is only a ſimple apprehenſion; but the Error proceeds from hence, that we judg a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſs, in concluding that the Sun is but two Foot in Diameter, in regard that by reaſon of its vaſt diſtance from us, it comes to paſs that the Image of the Sun which is form'd in the bottom of the Eye, is near at hand, of the ſame bigneſs which an object of two Foot would form at a diſtance more proportionable to our manner of Sight. But becauſe we have made this Judgment in our Youth, and for that we are ſo much accuſtom'd to it, that it is made at the ſame Inſtant that we ſee the
<pb n="125" facs="tcp:60750:68"/>
Sun, without any Examination hardly, we attribute it to the Sight, and we ſay we ſee the objects little or great, as they are nearer or more diſtant from us, tho' it be indeed the Mind, not the Eye that judges of their ſmallneſs or magnitude.</p>
                  <p>All Languages are full of words of the ſame nature, which not having any more then one Sound, are nevertheleſs the ſignifications of <hi>Ideas</hi> altogether different.</p>
                  <p>But we are to underſtand that when an E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quivocal word ſignifies two things which have no Relation one to another, and which Men have never confounded in their thoughts, it is almoſt impoſſible that Men ſhould there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by be deceiv'd, or that they ſhould be the cauſe of Errors. For the Equivocal word <hi>Aries</hi> a <hi>Ram,</hi> which ſignifies both a certain Creature, and a <hi>Sign</hi> in the <hi>Zodiac,</hi> ſhall ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver impoſe upon a Perſon that has but a grain of common Sence. Whereas it is a difficult thing not to be deceiv'd when the Equivoca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion ariſes from the errors of Men, who have regligently confounded different <hi>Ideas,</hi> as in the word <hi>Soul;</hi> for we take it for granted, that they who firſt made uſe of thoſe words, did inquire into their Significations, and ſo it ſuffices us to pronounce 'em, without ever exa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mining whether the <hi>Idea</hi> which we have of it be clear and diſtinct. Nay, ſometimes
<pb n="126" facs="tcp:60750:69"/>
we attribute thoſe things to the ſignification of the ſame word, which falls not, but upon <hi>Ideas</hi> of things altogether Incompatible, not perceiving that we have confounded two dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferent things under the ſame Word.</p>

                  <head>CHAP. XI. <hi>Of the Remedy of</hi> Confuſion <hi>in our</hi> Thoughts <hi>and</hi> Ratiocinations, <hi>ariſing from the Confuſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of Words: Of the Benefit of defining Words; and of the difference between the de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>finition of</hi> Things <hi>and</hi> Names.</head>
                  <p>THE beſt way to avoid the confuſion of Words, which we find in different Languages is to make a new Language, and to coyn new Words, to belong only to thoſe <hi>I<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deas,</hi> which they are aſſign'd to ſignifie. To which purpoſe there is no neceſſity to frame new Sounds of Words, becauſe we may make uſe of ſuch as are uſually practis'd, looking upon 'em, as if they had no ſignification, that we may aſcribe to 'em thoſe Notions which we intend 'em; which it behoves us deſign by other ſimple words, free from all Equivo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cation. Thus were it to be prov'd, that the Soul is Immortal, this Word <hi>Anima,</hi> the Soul,
<pb n="127" facs="tcp:60750:69"/>
being <hi>Equivocal,</hi> will eaſily make a Confuſion in what is to be ſaid. For the avoiding of which, I will retain this word <hi>Soul,</hi> as a ſound deſtitute of all Notion, and make uſe of it only to denote that thing which in us is the principle of Thought, by ſaying <hi>I call the Soul that, which in us is the Principle of Thought.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Behold here the definition of the word, with ſo much benefit made uſe of by the Geometri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cians, which is cautiouſly to be diſtinguiſh'd from the definition of the thing.</p>
                  <p>For in the definition of the thing, as thus, <hi>a Man is a Rational Creature, time is the mea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure of motion,</hi> we leave to the Term defi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned, that is <hi>Man,</hi> and <hi>Time</hi> the uſual notion wherein we aſſert other <hi>Ideas</hi> to be contain'd, as the <hi>Idea</hi> of <hi>Rational Creature, Meaſure of time,</hi> whereas in the definition of the word, as we have already ſaid, we only mind the Sound, and afterwards determine the ſound to be the ſign of ſome <hi>Idea,</hi> deſign'd for other Words.</p>
                  <p>But great heed is to taken leaſt we con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>found this definition of the word of which we here diſcourſe, with that other of which others ſpeak, who will have it be the explana<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of what a word ſignifies according to the vulgar Idiom of the Language, or its Etimo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>logie, which we ſhall ſpeak more of in another
<pb n="128" facs="tcp:60750:70"/>
place. But here we only mind the particular uſe to which he that defines a word, will have it apply'd for the better underſtanding his meaning, not caring whether it be taken in the ſame Sence by others.</p>
                  <p>And from hence it follows 1. That the De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>finitions of words are at pleaſure, but that thoſe of things are not ſo. For every Sound being of it's ſelf and in it's own nature indif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferent, to ſignifie any thing, it is lawful for me for my particular uſe, provided I adver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiſe others of it, to determine a Sound to ſignifie any thing preciſely without the mix<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture of any other. But it is quite otherwiſe with the Definition of things. For it does not depend upon the pleaſure of men that <hi>I<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deas</hi> ſhould include whatever they would have 'em to include: for that if in defining <hi>Ideas</hi> we add any thing which they do not com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prehend, we fall into inevitable Errour.</p>
                  <p>To give an Example of the one and the o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther: If in deſpoiling the word <hi>Parallello<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gram</hi> of all other ſignification, I apply it on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly to ſignifie a <hi>Triangle;</hi> this is lawful for me to do, nor do I commit any Error in ſo do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing: nay provided I only take it in this Man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner; I may affirm that a <hi>Parallellogram</hi> has three Angles equal to two Right Angles. But if I leave the Vulgar <hi>Idea</hi> to this word, to fig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nifie a Figure whoſe ſides are Parallel, and
<pb n="129" facs="tcp:60750:70"/>
yet affirm that a Parallellogram is a figure con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiſting of three Lines, in regard this would be then a Definition of the Thing, it would be abſolutely falſe; it being impoſſible that a Figure conſiſting of three Lines ſhould have it's ſides Parallel.</p>
                  <p>In the ſecond place it follows, that Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tentions about the Definitions of words ought not to be rais'd, for that Reaſon, becauſe they are Arbitrary. For you cannot deny that a man has not given the ſignification to a Sound which he ſays, he has, after he has given no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tice of it, nor that it has not that ſignificati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on according to the uſe which he makes of it; but we may contend about the Definitions of Things becauſe they may be falſe, as we have already ſhewn.</p>
                  <p>Thirdly it follows that every Definition of a word when it cannot be call'd in Queſtion, may be taken for a Principle. Which cannot be ſaid of the Definitions of Things; in re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gard they are propoſitions that may be de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny'd by thoſe who ſhall find any Obſcurity therein. And therefore like other Propoſiti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons they ought to be prov'd, and not to be taken for True; unleſs they appear perſpicu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous in themſeves, like Axioms.</p>
                  <p>But as to what I ſaid but now, that the De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>finition of a Name may ſupply the place of a Principle, it requires a farther Illuſtration.
<pb n="130" facs="tcp:60750:71"/>
For it is only true, in regard it cannot be controverted but that the determin'd Idea may be call'd by the aſſign'd name. Never<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>theleſs we ought not to conclude any thing of the Idea it ſelf, nor to believe it can exhi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bite any thing poſitively to us for that reaſon alone, becauſe it is call'd by ſuch a Name. For Example, I may define the Name of <hi>Chi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mera</hi> and ſay, I call a <hi>Chimera</hi> that which implies a contradiction; however it does not thence follow that a <hi>Chimera</hi> is any thing. In like manner, a Philoſopher ſays to me; I call Pon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deroſity the Interior Principle which cauſes a Stone to deſcend without any compulſive vio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lence; I ſhould willingly grant the Definiti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on without contradiction, becauſe it leads me to the knowledg of what he deſires to make me underſtand; but I will deny, that what is ſignified by the word Gravity is any thing real, in regard there is no ſuch princi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple in Stones.</p>
                  <p>I will explain this a little farther, becauſe there are two great Errours committed in Vul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gar Philoſophy upon this Subject. For it con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>founds the Definition of the Name with the Definition of the Thing, and attributes to the former what only belongs to the Second. For the Philoſophers having coyn'd an infinite number not of Names but of Things accord<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to their own Fancies which are altogether
<pb n="131" facs="tcp:60750:71"/>
falſe, as not explaining neither the Nature of Things nor the <hi>Ideas</hi> which naturally we have of 'em, yet they obtrude theſe Definitions up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on us for ſuch as are not to be contradicted. So that if any one deny 'em, when deſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vedly they may be denied, they exclaim a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt him as one that ought to be exter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minated the Schools, as not fit to be diſputed with.</p>
                  <p>Secondly the vulgar Philoſophers very ſel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom or never make uſe of thoſe Definitions of names, to remove or clear any obſcurity, nor fix 'em to any certain <hi>Ideas</hi> clearly de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſign'd, but leave 'em in darkneſs and confuſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on. Whence it happens that moſt of their diſputes, are only diſputes of words; and whatever is clear and true in Ideas, that they abuſe, to eſtabliſh and maintain, what is con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fus'd and dark in the ſame: which Errour would be avoided by the Definition of the Name. Thus the Philoſophers believe that there is nothing in the World more unqueſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>onable then that Fire is hot, or that a Stone is heavy, and that it would be a folly to deny either. Which indeed they may make all the World believe, ſo long as they forbear from the Definition of Names. But when once they do that, it will preſently appear what is obſcure, and what apparent in reference to thoſe things. Firſt then it is to be ask'd 'em,
<pb n="132" facs="tcp:60750:72"/>
what they mean by theſe words <hi>Hot</hi> and <hi>Pon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derous?</hi> For if they anſwer that by <hi>Hot</hi> they only mean that which is only proper to cauſe in us a Sentiment of Heat, and by <hi>Heavy</hi> that which falls downward not being propt up; they may then deſervedly ſay, that it is a folly to deny Fire to be <hi>Hot</hi> and Stones to be <hi>Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vy.</hi> But if they mean by <hi>Heat</hi> that which has in it's ſelf a Quality like to that which we imagine when we feel heat; and by <hi>Heavy</hi> that which has in it ſelf an Internal Principle which cauſes it to fall to the Center, not being compell'd by any violence from without; it will be eaſy then to demonſtrate to 'em, that it is no denial of a clear thing, but of a thing which is very obſcure, if not altogether falſe, that Fire is hot in that Sence, or that a Stone is heavy; in regard it is apparent that Fire cauſes in us a ſence of Heat, by that acti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on whereby it operates upon our Bodies, but it is no way evident that there is in the Fire any thing like to that which we feel in the Fire. And it is as evident in the ſame man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner that Stones fall down; but it is not ſo clear, that they fall of themſelves without a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny outward detruding Violence.</p>
                  <p>Thus we ſee the great benefit of defining names, for that by this means we underſtand what it is we diſpute of, that we may not contend in vain about words, which
<pb n="133" facs="tcp:60750:72"/>
we underſtand ſome one way, ſome another, as is frequently practis'd even in our ordina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry diſcourſes.</p>
                  <p>But beſides this benefit there is alſo ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, which is, that we cannot many times have a diſtinct <hi>Idea</hi> of a thing, unleſs we make uſe of many words to denote it. Now it would be Impertinent eſpecially in writings that concern the Sciences to be always repea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting a long Series of words. And therefore having once defin'd the thing by ſeveral words, we fix to ſome one word the <hi>Idea</hi> con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiv'd to ſerve inſtead of all the reſt.</p>
                  <p>Thus after we have found that there are numbers that may be divided into two equal Numbers, to avoid the often repetition of thoſe words, we fix this Propriety, and call a number that may be divided into two e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>qual Numbers, an <hi>even Number.</hi> Whence it is apparent, that as often as we make uſe of the defin'd Name, the Definition is to be mentally ſuppli'd, which a Man muſt have al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ways ſo ready in his Mind, that as ſoon as he hears even Numbers, he preſently underſtands ſuch a number as may be divided into two Numbers: and theſe two things ought to be ſo inſeparable from the thoughts, that the Tongue ſhould no ſooner expreſs the one, but the Mind ſhould add the other. For they who have defin'd Names as the Geometrici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans
<pb n="134" facs="tcp:60750:73"/>
do with ſo much Care, did it only to a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bridg their Writings (or as St. <hi>Auſtin</hi> ſays) <hi>Leaſt by continual Circumlocution they ſhould Create delays:</hi> but yet they do not do it to abridg the <hi>Ideas</hi> of the things of which they diſcourſe, believing the Mind will ſupply the entire Definition to ſhort words, which they only make uſe of to a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>void the Perplexity which multitude of words would produce.</p>

                  <p>HAving thus explain'd the nature, bene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fit and neceſſity of the definition of Names, it will not be from the purpoſe to ſpeak ſomething of their uſe, leaſt an ill uſe be made of 'em.</p>
                  <p>Firſt, all Names are not to be defin'd; for that would be often unprofitable and impoſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſible to be done. I ſay unprofitable; for that when the <hi>Ideas</hi> conceiv'd of things are di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtinct, and that all Men underſtanding the ſame Language, conceive the ſame <hi>Idea,</hi> it
<pb n="135" facs="tcp:60750:73"/>
would be ſuperfluous to define ſuch a name, becauſe we have already the intent of the Definition, as being fix'd without a definition to the diſtinct and clear <hi>Idea.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>But this happens in things that are purely ſimple, of which all Men naturally have the ſame <hi>Idea,</hi> ſo that the words by which they are denoted, are underſtood by all men in the ſame ſence, or if there be any mixture of obſcurity, that which is clear is primari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly underſtood. And ſo they who make uſe of ſuch words to denote a clear <hi>Idea,</hi> need not fear leaſt they ſhould be underſtood amiſs. Such are the words, <hi>Ens, or being, Thought, Extenſion, Equality, Duration</hi> or <hi>Time.</hi> For tho' ſome may obſcure the <hi>Idea</hi> of Time by ſeveral Propoſitions, which they call Definiti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons; as <hi>that Time is the meaſure of motion accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding to Priority and Poſteriority;</hi> nevertheleſs they never mind theſe definitions themſelves, when they ſpeak of Time, nor do they con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive any other thing of it. So that both Learned and Unlearned with the ſame facili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty underſtand the ſame thing when they hear, <hi>that a Horſe takes up leſs time in pacing a Fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>long then a Tortoiſe.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>I have ſaid moreover, that it is impoſſible to define all words. In regard that to define ſome words, there is a neceſſity of uſing other words that expreſs the <hi>Idea,</hi> to which that
<pb n="136" facs="tcp:60750:74"/>
word is to be annex'd. And then if theſe words which were made uſe of to explain the the firſt, be alſo to be defin'd; there will be a neceſſity for other words, and ſo to the Worlds end. And therefore there are ſome primitive words which cannot be defind, and it would be as great a fault to be too curious about their Definitions, as not to define ſuffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciently; for both ways we fall into the ſame Confuſion, which we labour to avoid.</p>
                  <p>The ſecond obſervation is, that we ought not to change Definitions known and alrea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy receiv'd, unleſs we meet with ſomething in 'em that is to be found fault with; for it is always more eaſy to teach the ſignification of a word to others, when Cuſtom already re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiv'd, at leaſt among the Learned has fix'd it to an <hi>Idea,</hi> then to annex it anew to ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther <hi>Idea,</hi> and force it from a former, to which it has been properly join'd by daily uſe. And therefore it would be a great error to alter the Definitions receiv'd by the Mathematici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans, unleſs where there are any that are not ſufficiently plain and obvious to Sence, or ſuch whoſe <hi>Ideas</hi> are not Politely deſcrib'd as in <hi>Euclid</hi> may be thought the Definition of <hi>Angle</hi> and <hi>Proportion.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Thirdly it is to be obſerv'd that when there is a neceſſity to define a name, it behoves us to approach as near as may be to common
<pb n="137" facs="tcp:60750:74"/>
Cuſtom, and not to give to words a Sence altogether foreign to what they already have, or which are contrary to their Etimo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>logie; as if a Parallelogram ſhould be de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fin'd, a figure conſiſting of three Lines. But if the word has two ſignifications, it muſt be depriv'd of one, that the other may be only affix'd to it. Thus when <hi>Heat</hi> ſignifies as well the feeling which we have of it, as the <hi>Quality</hi> which we believe to be in the Fire, like to that which we feel, to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>move this ambiguity, I will uſe the name of <hi>Heat,</hi> but I muſt not apply it but to one of theſe <hi>Ideas,</hi> diſmiſing it from the other, ſay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, I call <hi>Heat</hi> that feeling which I have when I come near the Fire; and to the cauſe of this <hi>Senſation</hi> I would give a name altoge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther different, as of <hi>Ardour</hi> or <hi>Burning;</hi> or elſe the ſame name with ſome addition, which determines and diſtinguiſhes it from Heat ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken for the <hi>Senſation</hi> of it, as is that of <hi>Vir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tual-Heat.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>The reaſon of this obſervation is taken from hence, that Men after they have once affix'd an <hi>Idea</hi> to a word, are not eaſily in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duc'd to ſeparate it from the word: and ſo the old <hi>Idea</hi> ſtill returning, obliterates the new which they have from the late Definition. So that Men more eaſily accuſtom them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves to a word of no Signification, as if a
<pb n="138" facs="tcp:60750:75"/>
man ſhould rather uſe the word <hi>Bara</hi> to ſigni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fie a Figure conſiſting of three Lines, then deſpoyl the word <hi>Parallellogram</hi> of the <hi>Idea</hi> of a Figure whoſe oppoſite ſides are Parel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lel, to make it ſignifie a Figure whoſe oppo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſite ſides are not Parallel.</p>
                  <p>This is an Errour into which all the Chy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſts are fallen, who take delight to change the names of the moſt things of which they diſcourſe, and to give them names which already ſignifie quite other things, and which have no correſpondence with the Ideas to which they joyn the words. Hence thoſe ri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diculous Ratiocinations of ſome of thoſe people, particularly of one who aſſerts, that the Peſtilence as he imagin'd, being a <hi>Satur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nine Diſeaſe,</hi> was to be cur'd by hanging a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout the Neck of the Patient, a plate of Lead, which is call'd <hi>Saturn</hi> by the Chymiſts, and whereon is alſo to be engrav'd upon a Satur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>day, which day is alſo ſacred to <hi>Saturn,</hi> the <hi>Character</hi> by which the Aſtronomers denote that Planet. As if arbitrary and feigned ſympathetic Affinities between Lead and the Planet <hi>Saturn,</hi> or between the ſame Planet and <hi>Saturday</hi> or the little Signature of the A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtronomers could be any way effectual for the Cure of Diſeaſes.</p>
                  <p>But that which is more inſufferable in this jargonry, or gibbriſh of the Chymiſts, is
<pb n="139" facs="tcp:60750:75"/>
their Prophaning the Sacred Miſteries of Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion to make 'em ſerve as a Vail to cover their pretended Secrets; inſomuch that ſome are arriv'd at that hight of Impiety; as to apply what the Scriptures ſpeaks of the true Chriſtians, <hi>That they are the Choſen Race, the Royal Prieſthood, the Holy Nation, the People purchas'd by God, and whom he has call'd out of darkneſs to his wonderful Light,</hi> to the Chi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>merical Fraternity of the <hi>Roſie Crucians,</hi> whom in their own Imaginations they term the only wiſe men that have attain'd Immortal Happi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs; as having by vertue of the Philoſophers Stone found out the way to fix the Soul in the Body; for as much, ſay they, as there is no Body ſo fix'd and incorruptible as Gold. Of which dreams, and of ſeveral others of the ſame nature there are to be found a great number in <hi>Gaſſendus</hi>'s <hi>Examen</hi> of <hi>Fludd</hi>'s Phi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>loſophy. Which demonſtrates that there is no diſeaſe of the mind more dangerous then that of Enigmatical Scribling, which cauſes men to imagine that their leaſt ſolid thoughts, if I may not call 'em falſe and altogether Im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pious, will paſs for great Myſteries, if clad in words unintelligible to the Common ſort of men.</p>

                  <p>ALL that has been ſaid of the Definiti<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>on of names, ought to be underſtood only of thoſe, by which every one defines the words for his particular uſe; and this is that which renders 'em free and Arbitrary, it be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing in the power of every one to make uſe of what Sound he pleaſes to expreſs his <hi>Ideas,</hi> provided he give notice before hand.

And there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore ſeeing that notion of words is not to be explain'd which is proper to our ſelves, but that which is proper to the word according to Common Uſe, ſuch Definitions are not to be call'd Arbitrary; yet are they to be oblig'd
<pb n="141" facs="tcp:60750:76"/>
to repreſent, though not the truth of the Thing, yet the truth of the Uſe; and they are to be eſteem'd falſe, if they do not really expreſs the Uſe, that is, if they do not joyn to Sounds the ſame Ideas which are annex'd to ſuch Sounds by the Common Cuſtom of thoſe that make uſe of 'em. And this demon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrates alſo to us that Definitions may be con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teſted, becauſe we find daily diſputes about the ſignification which Cuſtom gives to words.</p>
                  <p>Now, though theſe ſorts of Definitions of words ſeem to be the buſineſs of the Gramma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rians, whoſe Province it is to make Dictiona<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries, which are nothing elſe but the Explica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of Ideas which men have agreed to af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fix certain Sounds, yet may we raiſe upon this Subject ſeveral important Reflections for the rectifying our Judgments.</p>
                  <p>The firſt, which may ſerve as the founda<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of all the reſt, that men do not many times conſider the whole ſignification of words; that is, that the words often ſignifie more then they ſeem to ſignifie, and that therefore they who interpret the ſignification, do not thoroughly unfold all the Ideas which the words imprint in the minds of the Hearers.</p>
                  <p>For to ſignifie in a Sound pronounc'd or written is no other then to raiſe an <hi>Idea</hi> by ſtriking our Ears or our Eyes. Now it
<pb n="142" facs="tcp:60750:77"/>
comes frequently to paſs, that one word, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſides the principal <hi>Idea,</hi> which is look'd upon as the proper ſignification of the word, ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cites ſeveral other Ideas, which may be term'd <hi>Acceſſories,</hi> of which we take little no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tice, although the mind receive their Im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſion.</p>
                  <p>For Example, if a man ſhould ſay to ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther; <hi>You Lie,</hi> and that there ſhould be no more notice taken then of the principal ſig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nification of the Expreſſion, 'tis no more then to ſay, <hi>You know the contrary of what you affirm.</hi> But beſides this principal ſignificati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, the words according to Cuſtom raiſe an immediate Idea of Scorn and Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tempt, and make a man believe that he who ſpeaks the words cares not what injury he does the other; which renders the ſignifica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of the words injurious and offenſive.</p>
                  <p>However ſometimes theſe <hi>Acceſſory</hi> Ideas are not fix'd to words by Common Uſe, but are only added thereto by him that makes uſe of 'em. And theſe are ſuch as are rais'd by the Tone of the Voice, by the Alteration of the Countenance, by Geſtures, and other natural Signs which ſix to our words an infi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nite number of <hi>Ideas</hi> which vary, change, diminiſh, augment the ſignification by joyn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing thereto the Image of the Motions, Judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments and Opinions of him that ſpeaks.</p>
                  <p>
                     <pb n="133" facs="tcp:60750:77"/>
And therefore if he who affirm'd that the Tone of the Voice was to be meaſur'd by the Ears of the Hearers, believ'd it ſufficient to ſpeak loud enough to be heard, he under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtood not the uſe of the Tone of the Voice, the Tone oft times ſignifying as much as the words themſelves. There is one Tone for Inſtruction, another for Flattery, another for Reprehenſion. Sometimes a man is willing that his Voice ſhould not only reach the Ears of him he ſpeaks to, but that it ſhould peirce and run through 'em. Nor would any one think it well, that a Lacquey being loudly and vehemently reprov'd, ſhould anſwer, <hi>Sir ſpeak lower, I hear you well enough.</hi> For 'tis the Tone of the Voice that makes one part of the Reproof; and it is neceſſary to im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>print that <hi>Idea</hi> in the mind of the Servant, which the Maſter would have it make.</p>
                  <p>But ſometimes theſe acceſſory <hi>Ideas</hi> are fix'd to the words themſelves, for that u<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſually they thoroughly excite thoſe that pronounce 'em. And this is the reaſon that among ſeveral expreſſions that ſeem to ſigni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fie the ſame thing, ſome are injurious, ſome are mild, ſome modeſt, others impudent, ſome honeſt, others diſhoneſt; for that beſides the principal <hi>Idea</hi> with which they agree, men have affix'd other <hi>Ideas</hi> which are the cauſe of this variety.</p>
                  <p>
                     <pb n="144" facs="tcp:60750:78"/>
And this obſervation may ſerve to diſco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver a peice of Injuſtice very uſual among thoſe who complain of the reproaches thrown up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on 'em, which is to change the Subſtantives into Adjectives. For example, if they are accus'd of <hi>Ignorance</hi> or <hi>Impoſture,</hi> preſently they cry out for being call'd <hi>ignorant</hi> and <hi>fal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſifying</hi> fellows, which is not reaſonable be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe that the words do not ſignifie the ſame thing; for the Adjective, <hi>ignorant</hi> and <hi>falſifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing,</hi> beſide the ſignification of the offence which they diſcover; they include the <hi>Idea</hi> of Scorn; whereas the Subſtantives of <hi>igno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rance</hi> and <hi>impoſture,</hi> denote the thing to be ſuch as it is, without aggravation or extenu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ation. And we might inſtance other things that would ſignifie the ſame thing after ſuch a manner, as would include moreover a ſoft and lenifying <hi>Idea,</hi> and which would demonſtrate that the perſon had a deſire to excuſe and extenuate the Crime which he laid to the o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers charge. And thoſe are the ways which prudent and moderate men make uſe of, un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſs ſome reaſon prevail with 'em to act with more tartneſs and vehemency.</p>
                  <p>Hence alſo may be underſtood the diffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rence between a plain and a figur'd Stile, and why the ſame thoughts ſeem much more lovely, when they are expreſs'd by a figure, then if they were reſtrain'd to a plain man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner
<pb n="155" facs="tcp:60750:78"/>
of Speech. Which proceeds from hence, that figur'd expreſſions, beſides, the principal thing, ſignifie the Motion and Geſture of him that ſpeaks, and imprint both the one and the other <hi>Idea</hi> in the mind, whereas ſimple expreſſions ſets forth only the naked Truth: For example, of this half Verſe of <hi>Virgil,</hi>
                     <q>
                        <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>ſque adeone mori miſerum eſt?</q>
were expreſs'd ſimply and without a Figure;
<q>Non eſt uſque adeo mori miſerum:</q>
Without doubt the ſentence would not have had that force; and the reaſon is, becauſe the firſt Expreſſion ſignifies more then the ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cond; for it does not only expreſs the thought, that it is not ſo miſerable a thing as Men think to die; but it repreſents alſo the <hi>Idea</hi> of a Man, as it were provoking death; and undauntedly looking it in the face; which; without queſtion is a great and lively Acceſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on to the ſignification of the words: Hence it is no wonder that it makes a deep impreſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion in the Hearer; for the mind is only in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtructed by the verity of <hi>Ideas,</hi> but ſhe is not rous'd but by the repreſentation of Af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fections.</p>
                  <q>
                     <pb n="156" facs="tcp:60750:79"/>
                     <l>—ſivis me flere dolendum est</l>
                     <l>Primum ipſe tibi—</l>
                  </q>
                  <q>
                     <l>—If thou wouldſt have me weep it firſt behoves</l>
                     <l>thy ſelf to grieve—</l>
                  </q>
                  <p>But as figur'd ſtile not only ſignifies the things themſelves, but alſo thoſe affections of the mind, which we conceive in meditating and ſpeaking, we may judge from thence, the uſe which we ought to make of it, and what are the Subjects moſt proper for it. Viſible it is, that it is ridiculous to make uſe of it in matters meerly ſpeculative, which we con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>template with a calm and placid Eye, and which produce no motion in the Mind. For ſince that Figures expreſs the Paſſions of the Soul, when Figures are intermix'd where the Soul is no way mov'd, ſuch agitations of the Mind are contrary to Nature, and ſeem to be a kind of Convulſion. For which reaſon there can be nothing more prepoſterous then the ſtir and hurlyburly which ſome Preachers make, who fly out into fury and extravagant Bombaſts, upon all manner of Subjects, and who are no leſs furious upon Philoſophical Digreſſions, then upon truths, the moſt weigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty and neceſſary for Salvation.</p>
                  <p>On the other ſide, when the Subject of the
<pb n="157" facs="tcp:60750:79"/>
Diſcourſe is ſuch, that it requires a rouſing and waking of the mind, it is a fault to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liver himſelf in a jejune and frigid ſtile, and without any manner of motion.</p>
                  <p>Therefore Divine Truths not being ſimply propos'd only to be known, but much more to be belov'd, reverenc'd and ador'd by Men, without doubt, the noble, elevated and fi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gur'd manner of Elocution, obſerv'd by the Holy Fathers, is much more proportiona<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble to the Subject, then a flat and meager Stile, like that of the Scholaſtics; ſince it not only teaches us the Truths we are to know, but alſo endeavours to raiſe in us, thoſe Sentiments of Love, Reverence and Affection, which the Fathers had for thoſe Truths, when they wrote, and which repre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſenting to us the Image of that Holy diſpoſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, muſt of neceſſity contribute more to imprint the like in us. Whereas the Schola<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtic ſtile being plain, and contenting it ſelf with the <hi>Ideas</hi> of the Naked Truth, is no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing ſo effectual to produce in our Souls thoſe Motions of Reſpect and Love, which we ought to have for the Truths of Chriſtianity, which render it not only leſs profitable, but leſs delightful, ſince the ſoul it ſelf is more delighted in obſerving the motions of her af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fections, then in acquiring knowledg.</p>
                  <p>
                     <pb n="158" facs="tcp:60750:80"/>
Laſtly, 'tis by means of this Obſervation, that we may reſolve that famous Queſtion a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mong the Ancient Philoſophers, whether there be any words to be counted unchaſt? And by which we may alſo refute the Arguments of the <hi>Stoicks,</hi> who juſtify'd that we might make uſe indifferently of any words, though impudent and obſcene.</p>
                  <p>They were of opinion, ſaith <hi>Cicero</hi> in a Let<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter, which he wrote upon this Subject, that there were no words that were either naſtie or obſcene; for they ſay, that the obſcenity proceeds either from the things, or it is in the words. It does not proceed ſimply from the things, becauſe they may be expreſs'd in other words that are not eſteem'd ſo nauſeous; nor is it in the words, conſider'd as they are, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe it happens ofttimes, that one word ſig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nifies two things, and ſo in one ſignification it may be nauſeous, in another well enough approv'd.</p>
                  <p>But all this is no more then a vain piece of ſuttlety which grew from hence, that thoſe Philoſophers did not conſider thoſe acceſſory accidents, which the mind adds to the princi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pal <hi>Ideas</hi> of things: for from thence it comes to paſs, that one and the ſame thing may be ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſs'd honeſtly by one ſound, and laſciviouſly by another, if one of the ſounds has an <hi>Idea</hi> which covers the obſcenity, and the other an <hi>Idea</hi> that lays it open.</p>
                  <p>
                     <pb n="159" facs="tcp:60750:80"/>
Thus <hi>Adultery, Interest, Male-Copulation</hi> are no obſcene words, tho' they ſignifie moſt obſcene actions, becauſe they repreſent 'em cover'd with a vail of Abhorrency, which ſhews that we look upon 'em as crimes, ſo that thoſe words rather ſignifie the wicked<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs of the actions themſelves. Whereas there are certain words that expreſs thoſe Acts, without any Abhorrency, and which deſcribe 'em rather grateful and pleaſing with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>al, adding an <hi>Idea</hi> of Impudence and Laſci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viouſneſs. And thoſe are the words which are ſaid to be bawdy and diſhoneſt.</p>
                  <p>There are alſo certain Circumlocutions, by which certain actions are chaſtly expreſt, which though lawful, yet participate ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing of the Corruption of Nature; for ſuch Circumlocutions, not only plainly expreſs the things themſelves, but alſo the diſpoſition of him who ſpeaks of 'em in that manner, and which by his reſerv'dneſs teſtifie, that he mentions 'em with trouble and diſlike, and that it is his deſire they ſhould be conceal'd, as well from himſelf as from others: Where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>as others uttering the ſame things more free<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly and at random, make it appear, that they take delight in thoſe kind of objects, which being a Laſcivious pleaſure, it is no wonder, if the words which imprint that <hi>Idea,</hi> ſhould be accounted contrary to modeſty.</p>
                  <p>
                     <pb n="160" facs="tcp:60750:81"/>
For which reaſon it comes to paſs, that ſometimes the ſame word is eſteem'd modeſt at one time and immodeſt at another; which has conſtrain'd ſome of the <hi>Hebrew</hi> Rabbies, to place certain <hi>Hebrew</hi> words in the Margin of the Bible, to be pronounc'd by thoſe that read it, inſtead of thoſe which the Scripture makes uſe of; which happen'd from hence, that when thoſe words were made uſe of, they were not at all immodeſt, becauſe they were read with ſome certain <hi>Idea</hi> that repre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſented theſe words with reſerv'dneſs and mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deſty. But afterwards that <hi>Idea</hi> being ſepa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rated, and cuſtom having added another of impudence and Wantonneſs, they became nau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeous and uncivil: And therefore the <hi>Rab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bies,</hi> to prevent the mind from being amus'd with that evil <hi>Idea,</hi> were ſolicitous, that the People ſhould make uſe of others in reading the Bible, which no way alter'd the Text.</p>
                  <p>And therefore it was an ill Excuſe of an Author, whom the profeſſion of Religion oblig'd to an exact Modeſty, and who was deſerv'dly tax'd to have made uſe of an un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>decent word, to ſignifie an infamous place, to alledge, that the Fathers had not ſcrupl'd to make uſe of the word <hi>Iupanar,</hi> a <hi>Brothel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>houſe,</hi> and that he often found in their wri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tings, the words <hi>Meretri<gap reason="illegible" extent="1 letter">
                           <desc>•</desc>
                        </gap>e,</hi> and <hi>Leno, whore</hi> and <hi>Pander,</hi> and ſeveral others hardly to be
<pb n="161" facs="tcp:60750:81"/>
endur'd in our Language. For the liberty which the Fathers took to make uſe of thoſe words, ought to have convinc'd him, that they were not at that time accounted words of Ignominie; that is to ſay, that cuſtom had not added that <hi>Idea</hi> of obſcenity which render'd 'em Infamous; and therefore he drew an ill concluſion from thence, that it was for that reaſon, permitted him to make uſe of terms of Debauchery, ſo eſteem'd to be in our language; for that theſe words do not really ſig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nifie the ſame thing, which thoſe did of which the Fathers made uſe; ſeeing that beſides the Principal <hi>Idea</hi> in which they agree, they alſo exhibit the <hi>Idea</hi> of a debauch'd mind, and contain a mixture of Licentious Impudence.</p>
                  <p>Seeing then theſe <hi>Acceſſory Ideas</hi> are of ſo great Importance, and diſſolve the <hi>Pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>marie Notions</hi> into ſo many various <hi>Ideas,</hi> they would do well, who compile <hi>Vocabularies</hi> or <hi>Dictionaries,</hi> to mark out thoſe ſignifications, and make a diſtinction to the Readers, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween words Contumelious and Civil, Tart, Chaſt and Immodeſt, or rather abſolutely to obliterate the Latter, which it would be much better to be ignorant of, then to underſtand.</p>

                  <p>This Judgment is otherwiſe call'd a Propo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſition; and it is manifeſt that it ought to have two Terms, the one, of which any thing is affirm'd or deny'd, which is call'd the <hi>Subject,</hi> the other which is affirm'd and deny'd, which is call'd the <hi>Attribute</hi> or <hi>Predicate.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Nor does it ſuffice to have apprehended theſe two Terms, but they muſt be conjoyn'd or ſeparated in the Mind. And this operati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of the mind, is noted in the Propoſition, by the worſt <hi>Est, it is;</hi> when it is alone, it is Affirmative; but when we deny, we add the Participle <hi>non</hi> or <hi>not:</hi> Thus when I ſay, <hi>God is juſt, God</hi> is the Subject of the Propo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſition, <hi>juſt</hi> the Predicate. The Verbs <hi>is,</hi> de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>notes the action of the mind affirming, that is conjoyning the <hi>Idea</hi> of <hi>God,</hi> and the <hi>Idea</hi> of <hi>just,</hi> as agreeing together. But if I ſhould ſay, <hi>God is not unjust,</hi> the Verb <hi>is,</hi> with the Adverb joyn'd, denotes an action contrary to affirmation; by which I affirm thoſe <hi>Ideas</hi> do not agree together; for that there is ſomething in the <hi>Idea</hi> of <hi>unjuſt,</hi> which does not agree with that which is contain'd in the <hi>Idea</hi> of God.</p>
                  <p>But though it be neceſſary that every Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſition ſhould conſiſt of theſe three words, yet it may conſiſt of two, and ſometimes on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly of one.</p>
                  <p>
                     <pb n="164" facs="tcp:60750:83"/>
For Men, for the more ſuccinct way of ſpeaking, have invented ſeveral words, which ſignifie both the affirmation, that is the Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtantive, and the attribute which is affirm'd. Of this number are all thoſe words that are call'd Subſtantives, as <hi>God exiſts,</hi> that is, <hi>is exiſtent: God loves Men,</hi> that is, <hi>He is a lover of Men;</hi> but the Subſtantive, when it is ſin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gle, ceaſes to be purely Subſtantive; for that then the moſt general of the attributes, is joyn'd to it, which is <hi>ens,</hi> or <hi>being,</hi> and ſo <hi>non ego ſum, I am not,</hi> is as much as, <hi>I am not a being, or any thing.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>In the ſame manner at other times, the Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject and the Affirmation is included in the ſame word, as in the firſt and ſecond Perſons among the Latins, as when I ſay, <hi>ſum Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtianus, I am a Chriſtian;</hi> for <hi>ego</hi> is the Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject of this Propoſition, included in the word <hi>ſum.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Hence it is apparent, that one word among the Latins conſtitutes a Propoſition, in firſt and ſecond Perſons of thoſe Verbs, which before contain'd the affirmation with the Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dicate; ſo <hi>veni, vidi, vici,</hi> are three intire Propoſitions.</p>
                  <p>Hence it may alſo be concluded, that eve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry Propoſition is either Negative or Affirma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tive; and this is that which is contain'd ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther in the affirmation or the denial.</p>
                  <p>
                     <pb n="165" facs="tcp:60750:83"/>
But there is another difference of Propo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſitions deduc'd from the Univerſality, Parti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cularity or Singularity.</p>
                  <p>For the Terms, as is ſaid in the firſt part, are either ſingular, particular or Univerſal.</p>
                  <p>Univerſal Terms may be taken, either ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to the full extent, the ſigns of U<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niverſality being either expreſs'd or under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtood. As are <hi>all,</hi> for an affirmation, for denial <hi>none,</hi> as <hi>all Men, no Men,</hi> or accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding to the indefinite part of the extent, with the addition of the word <hi>ſome,</hi> as <hi>aliquis Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mo, ſome Man;</hi> or any other way, accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding to propriety of Speech.</p>
                  <p>Hence happens a certain variety, greatly to be obſerv'd in propoſitions; for when the ſubject of the propoſition is the Univerſal Term, taken in its full extent, it is call'd a univerſal propoſition, whether it be affirma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tive; as every impious Man is a fool; or ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gative, no wicked Man is bleſſed.</p>
                  <p>When the common Term is taken accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to the indefinite part of its extent, as be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing reſtrain'd by the addition of the word <hi>ſome,</hi> it is call'd a particular propoſition, whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther it be Affirmative, as <hi>ſome cruel Men are Cowards;</hi> or Negative, <hi>ſome poor Men are not miſerable.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>But if the Subject of a Propoſition be ſin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gular, as when I ſay, <hi>Lewis the</hi> 13th. <hi>hath ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken Rochel,</hi> it is call'd ſingular.</p>

                     <pb n="166" facs="tcp:60750:84"/>
But tho this Propoſition ſingular be diffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rent from the Univerſal in this, that the Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject of it is not common, yet has it a greater Affinity with it, then with the particular, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe the Subject, for the very reaſon that it is ſingular, is neceſſarily taken in its full ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tent, which is the Eſſential Propriety of an Univerſal Propoſition, and diſtinguiſhes it from the particular; for, that a propoſition may be univerſal it little imports, whether the extent of the Subject be great or ſmall, pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vided it comprehend all things: And this is the reaſon that ſingular Propoſitions ſupply the place of Univerſals in Argumentation; ſo that all Propoſitions may be reduc'd to four ſorts; which are mark'd by theſe four Vow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>els <hi>A.

                  <p>Propoſitions are alſo divided according to matter, into true or falſe; and it is clear, that there can be no Propoſition, which is neither true nor falſe; for that every Propoſition de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>claring the judgment which we make of things, it is true, when that judgment is con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formable to truth, and falſe when it is not conformable.</p>
                  <p>But becauſe we often fail of ſufficient light, to diſcern truth from falſehood, beſides thoſe Propoſitions that ſeem to be true, and thoſe that ſeem to us to be falſe, there are ſome that ſeem to be true; but of which the truth is not ſo evident, but that we have ſome ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prehenſion

                  <head>CHAP. II. <hi>Of the oppoſition of Propoſitions, having the ſame Subject and Predicate.</hi>
                  </head>
                  <p>WE have already declar'd, there are four ſorts of propoſitions, <hi>A. E. I. O.</hi> Now it may be demanded wherein they agree or differ, when ſeveral ſorts of Propo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſitions are deduc'd from the ſame Subject, and the ſame Attribute, which is call'd oppoſiti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on.</p>
                  <p>It is eaſily ſeen, that there can be but three ſorts of oppoſitions; tho one of the three is ſubdivided into two others.</p>
                  <p>For if they be oppos'd in quantity and quality both together, <hi>A. O.</hi> and <hi>E. I.</hi> they are call'd contradictories, as <hi>every Man is an Animal; Some Man is not an Animal: No Man is free from ſin. Some Man is free from ſin.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>
                     <pb n="169" facs="tcp:60750:85"/>
If they differ in Quantity only, and agree in Quality, as <hi>A. I.</hi> and <hi>E. O.</hi> they are call'd <hi>Subalterns.</hi> As every Man is a Creature, ſome Man is a Creature: No Man is free from ſin; ſome Man is not free from ſin.</p>
                  <p>But if they differ in Quality, and agree in Quantity, then they are call'd <hi>contraries</hi> or <hi>ſubcontraries: Contraries,</hi> when they are <hi>
                        <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>ni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſal;</hi> as <hi>Every Man is a Creature, No Man is a Creature.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Subcontraries,</hi> when they are particular: <hi>Some Man is a Creature; Some Man is not a Creature.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Now if theſe Propoſitions are lookt upon as they are true or falſe; it is eaſie to judg,</p>
                  <p>That contradictories are never together ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther true or falſe; but if one be true, the other is falſe; and if one be falſe, the other is true; For if it be true that every Man is a Creature, it cannot be true that ſome Man is no Creature; on the other ſide, if it be true that ſome Man is no Creature, it can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not be true that every Man is a Creature.</p>
                  <p>This is ſo clear that a farther explanation would but render it more obſcure.</p>
                  <p n="2">2. Contraries can never be probable, but they may be both falſe. They cannot be true, becauſe then contradictories would be true; for if it be true that every Man is an Animal, it is falſe that ſome Man is not an Animal, which is the contradictory, and by conſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quence,
<pb n="170" facs="tcp:60750:86"/>
much more falſe, that no Man is an Animal; which is its contrary.</p>
                  <p>But the falſity of the one does not infer the falſity of the other; for it may be falſe; that all Men are juſt, and yet it may not be true, that no Man is juſt; ſince there may be juſt men, though all men are not ſo.</p>
                  <p n="3">3. Subcontraries, by a Rule altogether op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſite to that of contraries may be probable, as in theſe two Propoſitions. <hi>Some Man is juſt; ſome Man is not juſt;</hi> for juſtice may agree with one part of Men; and not with the other. And therefore affirmation and negation never happen in the ſame Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject; for <hi>ſome Man</hi> is taken for one part of Men, in one part of the Propoſition, and for another part in the other. But they can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not be both falſe; for if it were falſe, that <hi>ſome Man is juſt,</hi> it would be true, that <hi>no Man is juſt,</hi> which is the Contradictory, and much more true, that <hi>ſome Man is not juſt,</hi> which is the <hi>ſubcontrary.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p n="4">4. As for the oppoſition of <hi>Subalterns,</hi> it is no true oppoſition: becauſe the particular is the conſequence of the Univerſal; for if <hi>all Men are Creatures; ſome Man is a Crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture:</hi> If <hi>no Man be an Ape, ſome Man is not an Ape:</hi> Therefore the truth of Univerſality in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fers that of Particulars; but the truth of Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticulars does not infer that of Univerſals;
<pb n="171" facs="tcp:60750:86"/>
for it does not follow, becauſe it is true, that <hi>ſome Man is juſt,</hi> that it ſhould be true, <hi>that all Men are juſt:</hi> On the other ſide the falſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hood of Particulars infers the falſhood of Univerſals; for if it be falſe that ſome Man is free from ſin, it is more falſe that all Men are free from ſin: But the falſhood of Uni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſals does not infer the falſhood of Parti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culars; For though it be falſe, that all Men are juſt, yet it does not follow, but that ſome Man may be juſt: Whence it follows, that many times <hi>Subaltern</hi> Propoſitions may both happen to be true, and ſometimes both to be falſe.</p>
                  <p>I forbear to ſpeak of the Reduction of oppoſite propoſitions to the ſame ſence, as be altogether unprofitable, and for that the Rules are only true in the Latin.</p>

                  <head>CHAP. III. <hi>Of Propoſitions ſimple and compos'd; That there are ſome which ſeem to be ſimple, but are not, and which may be call'd complex. Of Complex Propoſitions both as to the Subject and Attri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bute.</hi>
                  </head>
                  <p>VVE have ſaid, that every Propoſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion ought to have at leaſt, one
<pb n="172" facs="tcp:60750:87"/>
Subject and one Attribute; but it does not follow from thence, that it ought not to have no more then one Subject and one Predicate. Such then as have but one Subject and one Attribute are call'd ſimple, and they that have more then one Subject and one Predicate are call'd Compos'd. As when I ſay Good and Evil, Life and Death, Poverty and Riches come from the Lord. The predicate, <hi>Come from the Lord</hi> is affirm'd not only of one Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject, but of many, that is of <hi>Good and Evil, &amp;c.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>But before we explain the compos'd Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſitions, we muſt obſerve that there are ſome which ſeem to be compos'd that are not ſo, but Simple. For the ſingleneſs of a Propoſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion is taken for the Unity of the Subject and the Attribute. Now there are ſeveral Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſitions that have properly but one Predi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cate and one Attribute; but of which either the Subject or the Attribute is a term com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plex, which includes other Propoſitions, that may be call'd <hi>Incident,</hi> which make no part of the Subject or Predicate, being join'd by the Pronoun Relative, <hi>who or which,</hi> whoſe propriety it is to join together ſeveral Propo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſitions, to the end they may all encorporate into one.</p>
                  <p>Thus when Chriſt ſays, <hi>He that does the will of my Father who is in Heaven, ſhall enter into the Kingdom of Heaven.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>
                     <pb n="173" facs="tcp:60750:87"/>
The Subject of this Propoſition contains two Propoſitions, as containing two Verbs; but in regard they are join'd by the Relative <hi>who,</hi> they only make a part of the Subject. Whereas when I ſay, good and evil proceeds from the Lord, there are properly two Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jects, becauſe I affirm equally both of the one and the other, that they come from God.</p>
                  <p>The reaſon is this, for that the Propoſiti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons being join'd to others by the Relative, <hi>who,</hi> are either Propoſitions but imperfectly, as ſhall be ſaid hereafter; or elſe are not con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſider'd as Propoſitions then made, but as Propoſitions that have been made before, which are at that time only conceiv'd like ſingle <hi>Ideas.</hi> Whence it happens to be the ſame thing, whether we pronounce theſe Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſitions by Noun-Adjectives, or by Partici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ples without Verbs, and without the Relative, <hi>who;</hi> or with Verbs and with the Relative. For it is the ſame thing to ſay, <hi>The inviſibile God has oreated the viſible world;</hi> or God who is viſible, has <hi>Created the World which is viſible.</hi> Alexander <hi>themoſt valiant of Princes vanquiſh'd</hi> Darius; <hi>or</hi> Alexander <hi>who was the moſt vali<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ant of Princes, vanquiſh'd</hi> Darius. For as well in the one as the other, my principal aim is, not to affirm that God is Inviſible, or that <hi>Alex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ander</hi> was the moſt generous of Princes; but ſuppoſing both the one and the other as af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firm'd
<pb n="174" facs="tcp:60750:88"/>
before, I affirm of God, conceiv'd as Inviſible, that he Created the viſible World; and of <hi>Alexander</hi> conceiv'd to be the moſt ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nerous of Princes, that He vanquiſh'd <hi>Da<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rius.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>But if I ſhould ſay, <hi>Alexander was the moſt valiant of Princes, and the Vanquiſher of</hi> Dari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>us, 'tis evident that I ſhould no leſs affirm of <hi>Alexander,</hi> both that was he the moſt valiant of Princes, and that he was the Vanquiſher of <hi>Darius;</hi> and therefore there is good rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon that the latter ſort of Propoſitions ſhould be call'd compos'd Propoſitions; whereas we may call the other Propoſitions complex'd.</p>
                  <p>We are alſo to obſerve, that complex'd Propoſitions may be of two ſorts. For Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plexity, if I may ſo call it, may light either upon the matter of the Propoſition, that is to ſay, upon the Subject, or the Predicate, or both; or elſe upon the <hi>form</hi> only.</p>
                  <p n="1">1. Complexity falls upon the Subject, when the Subject is a Term Complex'd, as in this Propoſition. <hi>He is a King who fears nothing.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <q>
                     <l>Beatus ille qui procul negotiis</l>
                     <l>
                        <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>t priſca gens Mortalium,</l>
                     <l>Paterna Rura bobus exercet Suis</l>
                     <l>Solutus omni foenore.</l>
                  </q>
                  <p>
                     <pb n="175" facs="tcp:60750:88"/>
For the Verb <hi>Eſt</hi> is underſtood in the laſt Propoſition; <hi>Beatus</hi> being the Predicate, and all the reſt the Subject.</p>
                  <p n="2">2. Complexity falls upon the Attribute, when the Attribute is a Term complex'd, as <hi>Piety is a Vertue that renders a Man happy in the greateſt Adverſities.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <q>Sum Deus Aeneas, fama ſuper aethera notus.</q>
                  <p>But here we muſt obſerve that all Propo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſitions compos'd of Verbs active, and their caſes govern'd, may be call'd Complex, as containing in ſome manner two Propoſitions. For example, if I ſay, <hi>Brutus</hi> kill'd a Ty<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rant, this is as much as to ſay, that <hi>Brutus</hi> kill'd ſome-body, and that he whom he kill'd was a Tyrant; which is very remarka<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble to be obſerv'd; for when theſe Propoſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions are urg'd in Arguments, ſometimes there is but one part prov'd, the other being ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pos'd, by which we are frequently oblig'd to reduce thoſe Arguments into the moſt natural Form, and to change the Active into the Paſſive, to the end, that the part which is prov'd may be directly expreſs'd; as we ſhall ſhew when we come to diſcourſe of Argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments compos'd of complex Propoſitions.</p>
                  <p n="3">3. Sometimes Complexity falls upon both Subject and Predicate, both the one and the
<pb n="176" facs="tcp:60750:89"/>
other being a complex Term, as in this Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſition. <hi>The great ones who oppreſs the Poor, ſhall be puniſh'd by God, who is the Protector of the Poor.</hi>

                  </p>
                  <p>Theſe are the three ways that Propoſitions may be complex'd as to their Matter, that is to ſay, both as to the Subject and the Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dicate.</p>

                  <head>CHAP. IV. <hi>Of the Nature of Incident Propoſitions, that make a part of Propoſitions Complex'd.</hi>
                  </head>
                  <p>BUT before we ſpeak of Propoſitions, whoſe Complexity may fall upon the Form, that is to ſay, upon the Affirmation or Negation, there are ſeveral important re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>marks to be made upon the nature of <hi>Incident</hi> Propoſitions, which make one part of the Subject or Attribute of thoſe that are com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plex'd according to matter.</p>
                  <p n="1">1. It has been already ſaid, that <hi>Incident</hi> Propoſitions are thoſe whoſe Subject is the Pronoun, <hi>Who;</hi> as <hi>Men who are created to know and love God;</hi> or <hi>Men who are Pious,</hi> where the Term <hi>Men</hi> being taken away, the reſt is an <hi>Incident</hi> Propoſition.</p>
                  <p>But here we muſt call to mind what has been ſaid in the ſixth Chapter of the firſt Part. That the additions of Terms complex'd are of two ſorts, the one may be call'd ſimple Explications, when the addition alters no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing in the <hi>Idea</hi> of the Term, in regard that what is added, agrees generally with the term in its full extent: as <hi>Men who are created to know and love God.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>
                     <pb n="178" facs="tcp:60750:90"/>
The other may be call'd Determinations; for that, what is added to the term not a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>greeing with it in its full extent, reſtrains and determines the Signification, as in the ſecond Example Men who are Pious. From whence it follows that there is a Pronoun, <hi>Who, Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plicative,</hi> and a Pronoun <hi>(Who) Determina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tive.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Now when the Pronoun <hi>(who)</hi> is <hi>Explica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tive,</hi> the Attribute of the <hi>Incident</hi> Propoſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion is affirm'd of the Subject, to which the Pronoun <hi>(who)</hi> refers; tho' it be but incident<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly in reſpect of the total Propoſition; ſo that the Subject it ſelf may be ſubſtituted to the Pronoun <hi>(who)</hi> as in the firſt Example, <hi>Men who were Created to know and love God.</hi> For we might ſay, <hi>Men were created to know and love God.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>But when the <hi>(who)</hi> is Determinative, the Predicate of the Incident Propoſition, is not properly affirm'd of the Subject to which the <hi>(who)</hi> refers. For if in this Propoſition, <hi>Men who are Pious are Charitable,</hi> we ſhould put the word <hi>Men</hi> in the place of <hi>(who)</hi> by ſay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, <hi>Men are Pious,</hi> the Propoſition would be falſe, for this would be to affirm the word <hi>(Pious)</hi> of Men, as Men. But in the other Propoſition, <hi>Men who are Pious are Charitable,</hi> we affirm neither of Men in general, nor of any Man in particular, that they are Pious;
<pb n="179" facs="tcp:60750:90"/>
but the Underſtanding joining together the <hi>Idea</hi> of <hi>(Pious)</hi> with that of <hi>Men,</hi> and ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king an entire <hi>Idea,</hi> judges, that the attri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bute of <hi>Charitable</hi> agrees with the entire <hi>Idea.</hi> And therefore the entire Judgment which is expreſs'd in the Incident Propoſition is only that, by which our Underſtanding Judges that the <hi>Idea</hi> of <hi>Pious,</hi> is not incompatible with that of <hi>Men,</hi> and ſo they may be conſider'd as join'd together; and afterwards we may examine how they agree together, being thus united.</p>
                  <p>Many times there are <hi>Terms</hi> that are dou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bly and trebly Complex'd, being compos'd of ſeveral parts, of which every one is ſepa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rately complex'd; and ſo we may meet with ſeveral <hi>Incident</hi> Propoſitions, and of ſeveral ſorts; the Pronoun of the one being <hi>Expli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cative,</hi> and the other <hi>Determinative,</hi> as in this Example. <hi>The Doctrine that places Soveraign Happineſs in the pleaſures of the Body, which was taught by</hi> Epicure, <hi>is unworthy a Philoſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pher.</hi> The attribute of this Propoſition is <hi>
                        <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>nworthy a Philoſophyer</hi> and all the reſt is the Subject: and ſo the Propoſition is a Complex Term that includes two incident Propoſitions. The firſt, <hi>That places Soveraign happineſs in the pleaſures of the Body,</hi> where the Pronoun is determinative; for it determines (Doctrine) in general to be that which affirms Soveraign
<pb n="180" facs="tcp:60750:91"/>
Felicity to conſiſt in the pleaſures of the Body; whence it would be an abſurdity to ſubſtitute the word <hi>Doctrine</hi> to the Pronoun, by ſaying <hi>Doctrine places Soveraign Happineſs in bodily Pleaſure.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p n="2">2. The ſecond incident Propoſition is, which was taught by <hi>Epicurus,</hi> and the Subject where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to the Pronoun <hi>[which]</hi> refers, is the whole complex Term <hi>[The Doctrine which places Soveraign happinneſs in bodily Pleaſure]</hi> which denotes a ſingular and individual Doctrine, capable of divers accidents; as to be main<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tained by ſeveral perſons: tho' in its ſelf it be determin'd to be taken always after the ſame manner, at leaſt in this preciſe caſe, as it is extended. And therefore it is, that the Relative of the ſecond <hi>Incident</hi> Propoſition, [which was taught by <hi>Epicurus]</hi> is not deter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minative but only Explicative; ſo that the Subject to which the Pronoun refers may be ſubſtituted in the place of the pronoun, by ſaying, <hi>The Doctrine which places Soveraign happineſs in bodily Pleaſure, was taught by</hi> Epi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>curus.</p>
                  <p n="3">3. The laſt remark is, that to judg of the nature of theſe Propoſitions, and to know whether it be determinative or explicative, it behoves us to mind rather the Sence and Intention of him that ſpeaks, then the Expreſſion alone.</p>
                  <p>
                     <pb n="181" facs="tcp:60750:91"/>
For there are many times complex'd Terms, that ſeem uncomplex'd; or leſs complex'd then indeed they are; for that one part of what they encloſe in the mind of him that diſcourſes, is altogether underſtood and not expreſs'd, as has been ſaid in the ſixth Chapter of the firſt part, where we have ſhown that there is nothing more uſual in diſcourſe then to ſignify ſingulars by general words, for that the Circumſtances of diſcourſe make it appear that there is a ſingular and diſtinct <hi>Idea,</hi> join'd to that common <hi>Idea</hi> which anſwers to the word, that determines it to ſignifie only one thing.</p>
                  <p>I ſaid that this was generally known by the Circumſtances, as in <hi>French,</hi> the word <hi>Roy</hi> or <hi>King</hi> ſignifies <hi>Lewis</hi> XIV.</p>
                  <p>But there is yet a Rule that may ſerve us to judg, when a common Term retains a ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neral <hi>Idea,</hi> and when it is determin'd by a di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtinct and particular <hi>Idea,</hi> though not ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſs'd.</p>
                  <p>When it is a manifeſt Abſurdity to apply a Predicate to a Subject, retaining a general <hi>Idea,</hi> we muſt believe that he who made that Propoſition, has depriv'd that Subject of its general <hi>Idea.</hi> Thus if I hear a Man ſay, <hi>the King has commanded me ſuch a thing,</hi> I am aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſur'd that he has not left the word <hi>King</hi> in its general <hi>Idea,</hi> for a King in general gives no particular Command.</p>
                  <p>
                     <pb n="182" facs="tcp:60750:92"/>
If a Man ſhould ſay to me, <hi>The Bruſſells Gazet of the 24th of</hi> January 1662. <hi>is falſe as to what was tranſacted at Paris,</hi> I ſhould be aſſur'd, that there was ſomething more in the mind of him that ſpoke, then what was expreſſ'd in thoſe Terms. For thoſe words are not ſufficient to make me judge whether the Gazet be true or falſe: So that the Rela<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tor muſt have in his thoughts ſome piece of News Diſtinct, and particular which he judges contrary to the Truth; as if the Gazet had related, <hi>that the King had made a hundred Knights of the Order of the Garter.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Alſo in ſuch judgments as are made of the Opinions of Philoſophers, when we ſay, that the Doctrine of ſuch a Philoſopher is falſe, without expreſſing diſtinctly what that do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrine; is as (the Doctrine of <hi>Lucretius,</hi> touch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the Nature of our Soul is falfe) it neceſſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rily follows, that in ſuch ſorts of Judgments they who make 'em, do mean a diſtinct and particular Opinion under the general words (Doctrine of ſuch a Philoſopher). And ſo ſuch ſorts of Propoſitions diſſolve into others like to theſe. <hi>Such an opinion that was main<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain'd by ſuch an Author is falſe. The opinion that our Soul is Compos'd of Atoms, which was taught by</hi> Lucretius <hi>is falſe.</hi> So that theſe kinds of Judgments always encloſe two Affir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mations, when they are not diſtinctly ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſs'd.
<pb n="183" facs="tcp:60750:92"/>
The one Primary which relates to the Truth it ſelf; which is, that it is a great error to believe that our Soul is compos'd of Atoms; the other <hi>Incident,</hi> which refers on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly to the Hiſtorical part; that this error was generally taught by <hi>Lucretius.</hi>

                  </head>
                  <p>WHAT we have already ſaid may ſerve in anſwer to one celebrated Queſtion, how to know whether there be no falſhood but in Propoſitions, and whether there be none in <hi>Ideas</hi> and ſimple Terms.</p>
                  <p>I ſpeak of falſhood, rather then of Truth; for there is a truth in things that is cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain, which is their Conformity to the Will of God, whether Men think of 'em or not; but there can be no falſhood of things, but as they relate to the underſtanding of Man, or any other underſtanding ſubject to errors, which judges falſly that a thing is that which it is not.</p>
                  <p>
                     <pb n="184" facs="tcp:60750:93"/>
The Queſtion is, whether this falſhood is only to be met in Propoſitions and Judgments.</p>
                  <p>The uſual anſwer is, no; which is true in one ſence; however that hinders not, but that there may be falſhood, not in ſingle <hi>Ideas,</hi> but in complex Terms. For it is ſufficient, that ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing may be judg'd or affirm'd in them, ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther expreſly or virtually.</p>
                  <p>Which will be more plain, if we conſider particularly two ſorts of complex Terms; the one, of which the Pronoun is explicative, the other of which it is determinative.</p>
                  <p>In the firſt ſort of Complex Terms, we are not to wonder if we find any falſhood. For the attribute of the Incident Propoſition, is affirm'd by the Subject to which the Pronoun relates. As in <hi>Alexander who is the Son of Phi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lip,</hi> I affirm, though incidently, the Son of <hi>Philip</hi> of <hi>Alexander;</hi> and by conſequence there is a falſhood in it, if it he not ſo.</p>
                  <p>But here we are to make two or three re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>marks of moment.</p>
                  <p n="1">1. That the faſilty of an <hi>Incident Propoſition</hi> does not blemiſh the truth of the <hi>Principal Propoſition.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>For example, <hi>Alexander who was the Son of Philip, overcame the</hi> Perſians: This propoſition ought to paſs for true, though <hi>Alexander</hi> were not the Son of <hi>Philip;</hi> becauſe the affirmati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of the principal Propoſition, falls only up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on <hi>Alexander,</hi> and what is incidently added,
<pb n="185" facs="tcp:60750:93"/>
does not hinder, but that <hi>Alexander</hi> might vanquiſh the <hi>Perſians.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Nevertheleſs, if the attribute of the prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cipal propoſition, had relation to the incident propoſition, as if I ſhould ſay, <hi>Alexander the Son of</hi> Philip <hi>was</hi> Amintas<hi>'s Grandchild:</hi> Then would it only be, that the falſhood of the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cident propoſition, would render the princi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pal propoſition falſe.</p>
                  <p n="2">2. Titles that are given to certain Dignities may be given to all that poſſeſs that Dignity; though what is ſignify'd by the Title, do not at all agree with 'em. Thus becauſe the Ti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tles of <hi>Holy,</hi> and <hi>Thrice Holy,</hi> was formerly given to all Biſhops, we find, that the Catho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lic Biſhops at the conference of <hi>Carthage,</hi> did not ſcruple to give that Title to the <hi>Donatiſt</hi> Biſhops <hi>(the moſt Holy</hi> Petelian <hi>ſaid it)</hi> though they knew well that there could be no true Holineſs in a Heretic Biſhop. We find alſo, that St. <hi>Paul</hi> gives the title of <hi>beſt</hi> and <hi>moſt ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cellent</hi> to <hi>Festus</hi> Governour of <hi>Judea,</hi> becauſe it was the Title uſually given to the Chief Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernours,</p>
                  <p n="3">3. But it is not ſo, when a Perſon is the Author of a Title which he gives to another, and which he gives according to his own, and not the opinion of others, or according to popular error; for then we may impute to himſelf the falſhood of ſuch propoſition. Thus
<pb n="186" facs="tcp:60750:94"/>
when a Man ſays, Ariſtotle <hi>who is the Prince of Philoſophers,</hi> or ſimply, <hi>The Prince of Philo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſophers,</hi> believ'd that the Original of the Nerves was in the Heart; we have no reaſon to tell him this is falſe, becauſe <hi>Ariſtotle</hi> was not the beſt of Philoſophers; for it is enough that he has follow'd in this the common opinion, though it were falſe. But if a Man ſhould ſay, That Gaſſendus, <hi>who is the moſt Learned of Phi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>loſophers, believ'd that there was a</hi> Vacuum <hi>in nature;</hi> we may with reaſon diſpute the Title which he would give <hi>Gaſſendus,</hi> and make him reſponſible for the falſhood, couch'd in that incident propoſition. A Man may be al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſo accus'd of Falſhood, who gives to the ſame perſon a Title which is not ſuitable to him, yet not be blam'd for giving him another Ti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle, which is leſs true and leſs agreeable. For example, <hi>Pope</hi> John <hi>the XII. was neither Holy, nor Chaſt, nor Pious:</hi> As <hi>Baronius</hi> acknow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledges; for tho' they who call'd him <hi>most Holy</hi> could not be tax'd of falſhood, yet they who call'd him moſt Chaſt and Pious, were very great Liars, though they did it by Inci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent Propoſitions; as if they had ſaid, <hi>John</hi> the XII. <hi>the moſt Chaſt Pope, decree'd ſuch a thing.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>This is what I had to ſay concerning inci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent Propoſitions, where the Pronouns (Who or Which) are explicative; as to thoſe
<pb n="187" facs="tcp:60750:94"/>
other where the Pronouns are determinative, as <hi>Men who are Pious, Kings who love their Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jects,</hi> certain it is, they are not liable to falſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hood, becauſe the predicate of the Incident Propoſition is not affirm'd of the <hi>Subject</hi> to which the Pronoun relates. For example, ſhould it be ſaid, <hi>That ſuch Judges as do nothing for favour or reward, are worthy of applauſe,</hi> it is not therefore affirm'd, that there are any ſuch Judges, who are ſo upright. Nevertheleſs I be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve there is always in theſe Propoſitions a ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cit and virtual Affirmation, not of the actual Congruity of the Predicate, with the Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject to which the Pronoun relates; but of the poſſible Congruity. And if there be any de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceit in this, we may rationally conclude there is a falſhood in the Incident Propoſitions. As if it had been ſaid, <hi>Souls that are ſquare are more ſolid than thoſe which are round;</hi> here the <hi>Idea's</hi> of Square and Round being Incompati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble with the <hi>Idea</hi> of a Soul, taken for the principle of Thought, I judg that thoſe Inci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent Propoſitions ought to paſs for falſe.</p>
                  <p>And hence it may be ſaid, that the great<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eſt part of our errors proceed. For having the <hi>Idea</hi> of a thing we frequently join to it another incompatible <hi>Idea,</hi> and by that means attribute to the ſame <hi>Idea,</hi> that which is not ſuitable to it.</p>
                  <p>Thus finding in our ſelves two <hi>Ideas,</hi> one
<pb n="188" facs="tcp:60750:95"/>
of the thinking Subſtance, another of the extended Subſtance, it frequently happens, that when we conſider our Soul, which is the thinking Subſtance, we inſenſibly intermix ſomething of the <hi>Idea</hi> of the extended Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtance, as when we imagine that the Soul fills up a ſpace like the Body, and that it could not be at all if it were no where, which are not Properties that belong to a Body. Whence aroſe that Impious error of the Mor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tality of the Soul. We may read an excel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lent diſcourſe of St. <hi>Auſtin</hi> upon this Subject, in his tenth Book of the Trinity; where he ſhews that there is nothing ſo eaſy as to know the nature of our Soul. But that which con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>founds men is this, that being deſirous to know it, they are not ſatisfied with what they know, without any great trouble; that is to ſay, that it is a Subſtance that thinks, deſires, doubts, and knows; but they add to what it is, what it is not, fancying the Soul under ſome of thoſe Phantoſms, under which they were wont to conceive Corpore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>al things.</p>
                  <p>On the other ſide, when we conſider Bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dies, we have much adoe to abſtain from in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>termixing ſomething of the <hi>Idea</hi> of the Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtance that thinks, hence we affirm that hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vy things tend to the Center; of Plants, that they ſeek for proper nouriſhment; of <hi>Criſis</hi>'s
<pb n="189" facs="tcp:60750:95"/>
in Diſeaſes, that it is nature that goes about to diſcharge it ſelf of what is baneful, and a thouſand other Whimſeys. More eſpecial<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly in our Bodies, that Nature has an Inclinati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on to do this or that; when we are aſſur'd that we have no ſuch deſire, nor ever had any ſuch thought, and that it is ridiculous to imagine, that there is within us any other thing then our ſelves, that knows what is good or hurt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful for us, that deſires the one, and eſchews the other.</p>
                  <p>I believe moreover that we are to attri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bute to theſe incompatible <hi>Ideas,</hi> all thoſe murmurings of Men againſt the Deities; for it would be impoſſible to murmur againſt God, if we conceiv'd him aright: as he is, al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>together Wiſe, Omnipotent, and all Good<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs. But the Ungodly conſidering him as Omnipotent, and the Sovereign Lord of all the World, attribute to him all the misfor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tunes that befall 'em, wherein they are not deceiv'd; but becauſe at the ſame time they apprehend him to be cruel and unjuſt, which is incompatible with his goodneſs, they im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>piouſly inveigh againſt him as the Author of the miſeries which they ſuffer.</p>

                  <head>CHAP. VI. <hi>Of Complex Propoſitions, according to Affirma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion and Negation: of one ſort of thoſe kinds of Propoſitions which the Philoſophers call</hi> Modal.</head>
                  <p>BEſides thoſe Propoſitions where the Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject or Attribute is a Term Complex, there are alſo others that are Complex; be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe there are Terms or incident Propoſitions, which only regard the form of the Propoſiti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, that is, the Affirmation or Negation which is expreſs'd by the Verb; as if I ſhould ſay, <hi>I affirm that the Earth is round.</hi> Here <hi>I affirm,</hi> is only an incident Propoſition, which ought to make a part of ſomething in the principal Propoſition. Nevertheleſs it is viſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble that it makes no part either of the Subject or of the Attribute: for they ſuffer no alte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration, as being underſtood as entirely as if I ſhould ſimply aver, <hi>the Earth is round.</hi> So that the incident Propoſition falls only upon the Affirmation which is expreſs'd in two man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ners; the one moſt commonly by the Verb <hi>[Eſt] the Earth is round;</hi> and the other ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſly by the Verb I maintain.</p>
                  <p>
                     <pb n="191" facs="tcp:60750:96"/>
So when they ſay, I deny it, it is true; it is not true. Or when they add in one Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſition that which ſupports the Truth; as when I ſay, <hi>The Reaſons of Aſtronomy convince us, that the Sun is much bigger then the Earth.</hi> For the firſt part is only a ſupport of the Argument.</p>
                  <p>Nevertheleſs it is of great Moment to know that there are a ſort of theſe Propoſiti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons which are Ambiguous, and which may be taken differently, according to the deſign of the Propounder. As when I ſay, <hi>all Phi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>loſophers aſſure us,</hi> that heavy things fall of <hi>themſelves.</hi> Now if it be my Intention to ſhew that heavy things fall down of them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves, the firſt part of this Propoſition will be only Incident, and will only ſupport the affirmation of the latter part. But if I intend to report this opinion of the Philoſophers, without approving it, then the firſt part will be the principal Propoſition, and the laſt will only be a part of the Attribute. For ſo I af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firm not only that heavy things fall of them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves, but that all Philoſophers aſſert it. And it is eaſily ſeen that theſe two ways of changing the propoſition, alter it in manner, that it becomes two different Propoſitions, and different in Sence. But it is eaſy to judg by the Conſequence, in which of the two Senſes the Propoſitions are to be taken. For
<pb n="192" facs="tcp:60750:97"/>
Example, the Propoſition being laid down, I ſhould add; <hi>But Stones are heavy, therefore they fall down of themſelves,</hi> would be plain that I had taken the firſt Sence, and that the firſt part was only <hi>Incident.</hi> On the other ſide, if I ſhould conclude thus, <hi>Now this is an Error, and by conſequence an Error may be taught by the Philoſophers,</hi> then it would be ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nifeſt that I had taken the Propoſition in the ſecond Sence; that is, that the firſt part will be the principal Propoſition, and the ſecond part only the predicate.</p>
                  <p>As for Complex Propoſitions, where the Complexity falls upon the verb, and not up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on the Subject, nor the Predicate, Philoſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phers have particularly taken notice of thoſe that are called <hi>Modal;</hi> becauſe the Affirma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion or Negation is modified by one of the four Modes, <hi>Poſſible, Contingent, Impoſſible, Neceſſary.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>And becauſe every Mode may be affirm'd or denied, as <hi>it is poſſible, it is not poſſible,</hi> and in both manners be join'd with the Affirma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tive or Negative Propoſition, every Mode may have four Propoſitions, and the four to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether ſixteen, which are denoted by theſe four words, <hi>P<g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>RP<g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>REA, ILIACE, AMABIM<g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>S, EDENT<g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>LI;</hi> of which this is the Miſtery.

                  <head>CHAP. VII. <hi>Of ſeveral ſorts of Compos'd Propoſitions.</hi>
                  </head>
                  <p>WE have already ſaid, that compos'd Propoſitions have either a dou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble Subject, or a double Predicate. Now of theſe there are two ſorts. One where the Compoſition is expreſly mark'd; the reſt where it lies more conceal'd, and which the <hi>Logici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans</hi> for that reaſon call <hi>Exponable;</hi> which require Expoſition or Explanation.</p>
                  <p>Thoſe of the firſt ſort may be reduc'd to ſix Kinds, Copulatives, Disjunctives, Conditi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal, Cauſal, Relative and Diſcretive.</p>

                     <p>We call Copulatives thoſe that include ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veral Subjects or ſeveral Attributes join'd to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether by an Affirmative or Negative Conjun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction; that is to ſay, <hi>(And)</hi> or <hi>(neither)</hi> For
<pb n="195" facs="tcp:60750:98"/>
                        <hi>(Neither)</hi> does the ſame thing as <hi>(and)</hi> in theſe ſorts of Propoſitions; for that <hi>(neither)</hi> ſignifies <hi>[and]</hi> with a Negative which falls upon the Verb and not upon the Union of the two words which it joins; as if I ſhould ſay, <hi>that Knowledg and Riches do not make a Man happy.</hi> Here I unite Knowledg and Rich<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>es, affirming of both that they do not make a Man happy, in the ſame manner as if I ſhould have ſaid, <hi>that Knowledg and Riches render a Man vain-glorious.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>Theſe Propoſitions may be diſtinguiſhed in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to three ſorts.</p>
                     <p n="1">1. When they have more Subjects.</p>
                     <q>Life and Death are in the power of the Tongue.</q>

                     </q>
                     <p>A well Compos'd Mind hopes for good Fortune in bad, and fears not bad fortune in Proſperity.</p>
                     <p n="3">3. When they have ſeveral Subjects and ſeveral Attributes.</p>

                        <l>Nor anxious cares repel.—</l>
                     </lg>
                     <p>The truth of theſe Propoſitions depends upon the truth of both the two parts. Thus if I ſay that Faith and a good Life are neceſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſary to Salvation, this is true, becauſe both the one and the other is neceſſary. But ſhould I have ſaid, a good Life and Riches are neceſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſary for Salvation, this is a falſe Propoſition, becauſe Riches are not neceſſary for Salva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion.</p>
                     <p>Propoſitions that are conſider'd as Nega<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tives, and contradictory in reſpect of Copu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>latives and all others compos'd, are not all ſuch, where Negations occur, but only ſuch where the Negation falls upon the Conjuncti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, which happens ſeveral ways, as by put<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting the <hi>[Not]</hi> at the head of the Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſition. Thou doſt not love, and forſake thy Friend.</p>
                     <p>For thus it is, that a Propoſition is made Contradictory to the Copulative, by expreſs<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly denying the Conjunction; as when we ſay that it cannot be, <hi>that a thing ſhould be this and that at the ſame time.</hi>
                     </p>

                     </q>
                     <p>The truth of theſe Propoſitions depends upon the neceſſary Oppoſition of the parts, which admits no Medium. But as they ought to admit no Medium, that they may be ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>caſſarily true; ſo that they may be only morally true, it ſuffices that they do not uſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally admit a Medium. And therefore it is abſolutely true that an action done with Judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment is either good or bad, the <hi>Theologians</hi> making it manifeſt that there is nothing in particular that is untrue. But when they ſay, that Men never act but by intereſt or fear; this is not abſolutely true, ſince there are ſome who are lead neither by the one or the other of theſe Paſſions, but meerly upon the conſideration of their Duty: So that the main truth of this Propoſition lies in this, that the greateſt part of Men are govern'd by theſe two Affections.</p>
                     <p>Propoſitions contradictory to disjunctives are thoſe where the Truth of the Disjuncti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on is denied.

                     <p>Thoſe are call'd Excluſive, which denote, that a Predicate ſo agrees with his ſubject, as to agree with that alone, and no other. Whence it follows, that they include two various Judgments, and by conſequence are composd in ſence. Which is expreſs'd by the word

                        <hi>Lucan</hi> ſpeaking of the Druids, makes this Disjunctive Propoſition compos'd of two Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cluſives</p>
                     <q>
                        <l>—you know</l>
                        <l>The God and Heavenly Numens, you alone,</l>
                        <l>Or elſe to only you they are unknown.</l>
                     </q>
                     <p>Theſe Propoſitions are contradicted three manner of ways.</p>
                     <p n="1">1. <hi>By denying that the predicate agrees with the ſubject alone.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p n="2">2. <hi>By affirming it agrees with ſomething elſe.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p n="3">3. <hi>By alleadging it agrees with the one and the other.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>Thus this Propoſition, <hi>only Vertue is true Nobility,</hi> it may be contradicted.</p>
                     <p n="1">1. <hi>That Vertue does not make any one Noble.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p n="2">2. <hi>That Birth renders a Man Noble as well as Vertue.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p n="3">3. <hi>That Birth ennobles a Man, and not Vertue.</hi>
                     </p>

                        <pb n="206" facs="tcp:60750:104"/>
So the Maxim of the Academic's, <hi>this is only certain that there is nothing certain,</hi> was variouſly contradicted by the <hi>Dogmatics,</hi> and the <hi>Pyrrhonians.</hi> For the <hi>Dogmatics</hi> deny it, by maintaining that it is doubly falſe, becauſe there are many things that we know moſt certainly; and therefore it was not true, that we were certain that we knew nothing. And the <hi>Pyrrhonians</hi> averr'd that it was falſe, for the contrary reaſon, that every thing was ſo uncertain, that it was uncertain whether any thing was certain.</p>
                     <p>And therefore there is a defect of Judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment in what <hi>Lucan</hi> ſpeaks of the <hi>Druids;</hi> be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe there was no neceſſity, that only the <hi>Druids</hi> ſhould be in the truth, in reſpect of the Gods, or that they ſhould only be in an error. For in regard there were ſundry er<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rors, concerning the nature of the Gods, it might well be, that though the <hi>Druids</hi> had different thoughts concerning the Gods, from thoſe of other Nations, they were no leſs in an error then other Nations. Here it is alſo to be obſerv'd, that there are Propoſitions which are excluſive in ſence, though the ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cluſion be not expreſs'd. As in this Verſe of <hi>Virgil,</hi> where the Excluſion is mark'd out,</p>
                     <q>
                        <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>na ſalus victis, nullam ſperare ſalutem.</q>
                     <pb n="207" facs="tcp:60750:104"/>
                     <p>Thus luckily Tranſlated into <hi>French,</hi> where the Excluſion is underſtood.</p>
                     <q>
                        <l>Le ſalut des vaincus eſt de n'en point attendre.</l>
                        <l>The ſafety of the vanquiſh'd, is not to expect it.</l>
                     </q>
                     <p>Nevertheleſs it is more uſual in the <hi>Latin</hi> then <hi>French,</hi> to ſuppreſs Excluſions. So that there are ſome paſſages not to be Tranſlated with all their force, without making excluſive Propoſitions, though in the <hi>Latin</hi> the Exclu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion be not mark'd.</p>
                     <p>Thus 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 10. 17. <hi>Qui gloriatur, glorietur Domino;</hi> ought to be thus Tranſlated, <hi>Who<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever rejoices, let him rejoice in the Lord.</hi>

                     <p>Propoſitions where a Comparative is de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſign'd, include two judgments.

                        <hi>is the greatest of Evils,</hi> was contradicted one way by the <hi>Stoicks,</hi> and after another manner by the <hi>Peripatetics,</hi> while the <hi>Peripatetics</hi> aver'd that pain was an evil; but they likewiſe main<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain'd that Vice and other Irregularities of the Mind were far greater Evils then Pain. On the other ſide the <hi>Stoicks</hi> would not al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low Pain to be an Evil, ſo far were they from acknowledging it to be the greateſt of all Evils.</p>
                     <p>But here it may be diſputed, whether it be always neceſſary that in theſe Propoſitions the Poſitive of the Comparative, ſhould agree with both the Members of the Compariſon; for Example, whether we ought to ſuppoſe two things to be good, that we may aver the one to be better then the other?</p>
                     <p>It ſeems at firſt that it ſhould be ſo; but we find it otherwiſe in practice; for we ſee the Scripture makes uſe of the word <hi>Better,</hi> not only in comparing two good things toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther: <hi>Better is Wiſdom then Strength, and a prudent Man then a ſtrong Man.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>But alſo in comparing a good with an Evil, <hi>Better is the patient then the proud Man.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>And ſometimes in comparing two evil things together. <hi>Better is it to live with a Dragon then a ſcolding Woman.</hi> And in the Goſpel, <hi>it is better for a Man to be thrown into the Sea with a Milſtone about his Neck, then to hurt one of the Faithful.</hi>
                     </p>

                        <pb n="211" facs="tcp:60750:106"/>
The reaſon of this practice is, becauſe a greater good is better then a leſſer. And by the ſame reaſon we may ſay, tho leſs pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perly, that a benefit is better then an Evil; for that whatever has ſome goodneſs, has more then that which has none at all. We may alſo ſay, that a leſſer Evil is better then a greater Evil, being lookt upon as a kind of Good, in reſpect of Evil, and therefore the leſſer Evil has more of that ſort of good<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>neſs then the greater Evil.</p>
                     <p>But we are to take care leaſt the over-heat of Diſpute carry us unawares into vain bran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gles about theſe forms of Speech, as they did <hi>Creſconius</hi> the Donatiſt <hi>Grammarian,</hi> diſputing againſt St. <hi>Auſtin.</hi> For that ſame Father hav<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing ſaid that the Catholics had more reaſon to upbraid the Donatiſts with Tradition, then the Donatiſts to reproach the Catholicks, <hi>Creſconius</hi> thought he might from thoſe words, <hi>Traditionem nos vobis probabilius Objicimus,</hi> conclude, that St. <hi>Auſtin</hi> acknowledg'd that the Donatiſts had reaſon to tax the Catho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>licks. <hi>For if you</hi> ſaid he, <hi>more probably; we therefore probably.</hi> For the degree augments what is plac'd before it, does not impugn or deny what is ſaid before it.

                  <p>CErtainly it is a defect of vulgar Logic, that it does not accuſtom young begin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ners to underſtand the nature of Propoſiti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons or Arguments, but according to the order and formes which are uſed in the Schools, which are frequently different from what we find in the Writings of others, whether in Oratory, Morality, or any other of the Sci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ences.</p>
                  <p>And therefore they have no other <hi>Idea</hi> of a Subject or an Attribute, but that the one is the firſt Term of the Propoſition, and the <gap reason="illegible" extent="1 letter">

                     </gap>he other the latter. And of Univerſality and Particularity, but that there is in the <gap reason="illegible" extent="1 letter">

                     </gap>ne, <hi>(All)</hi> or <hi>(None)</hi> and in the other, <hi>(Some)</hi> whereas all theſe things are ſubject to Frequent Errors; and it requires Judgment to diſcern theſe things in ſeveral Propoſitions. Let us begin with the Subject and Attri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bute.</p>
                  <pb n="214" facs="tcp:60750:109"/>
                  <gap reason="duplicate" extent="1 page">

                     <pb n="216" facs="tcp:60750:110"/>
The only and true Rule is to obſerve by the Sence, of what a thing is affirm'd, and what is affirm'd is this, for the firſt is always the Subject, and the latter the Predicate, how<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever diſpos'd in order.</p>
                  <p>Thus there is nothing more common then theſe ſorts of Propoſitions; It is a ſhameful thing to be a ſlave to Luſt. Where by the Sence it is viſible, that <hi>a ſhameful thing</hi> is that which is affirm'd, and conſequently the Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dicate; <hi>and to be a ſlave to Luſt,</hi> is that which is affirm'd of the thing, that it is a ſhameful thing, and conſequently the Subject. Like<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe in St. <hi>Paul</hi> according to the Latin. <hi>Eſt queſtus magnus Pietas cum ſufficientia;</hi> where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>as the true order ſhould be Godlineſs, with ſufficiency, is great gain.</p>
                  <p>Likewiſe in this verſe.</p>
                  <q>Happy the Man that knows the cauſe of things.</q>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Happy</hi> is the Predicate, all the reſt is the Subject.</p>
                  <p>But the Subject and the Attribute are yet more difficult to be found out in complex Propoſitions. And we have already ſhew'd that ſometimes there is no diſcerning, but by the conſequence of the Diſcourſe, and the Authors Intention, which is the chief Propo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſition,
<pb n="217" facs="tcp:60750:110"/>
and which the Incident in the two pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſitions.</p>
                  <p>But beſides what has been ſaid we may yet obſerve, that in complex propoſitions, where the firſt part is only the Incident Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſition, and the latter is the principal; as in the Major and Concluſion of this Argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment,
<q>
                        <l>
                           <hi>God Commands us to honour Kings.</hi>
                        </l>
                        <l>Lewis <hi>the XIV. is King.</hi>
                        </l>
                        <l>
                           <hi>Therefore God commands us to honour</hi> Lewis <hi>the XIV.</hi>
                        </l>
                     </q>
                  </p>
                  <p>Here the Verb Active is to be chang'd into the Paſſive, to find out the true Subject of this principal Propoſition. For it is plain when I argue after this manner, that my principal intention in the <hi>Major,</hi> is to affirm ſomething of Kings, Whence I may conclude that we are to honour <hi>Lewis</hi> the XIV. And therefore what I affirm of the Command of God is only an incident Propoſition which confirms this Affirmative, that Kings are to be honour'd. Whence it follows that <hi>Kings</hi> is the Subject of the Major, and <hi>Lewis</hi> the XIV. the Subject of the Concluſion. Tho if we conſider things but only ſuperficially, both the one and the other ſeem to be no more than a part of the Attribute.</p>

Theſe Propoſitions are alſo frequent in our Language. <hi>It is a folly to liſten to Flatterers. It is the Hail that falls. It is God who has pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chas'd us;</hi> But the Sence ſufficiently demon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrates, that to replace theſe Propoſitions in their natural order, they ought to be thus expreſs'd.</p>

                     <l>To liſten to Flatterers is a folly.</l>

                     <l>He that has purcbaſed us is God.</l>

                  <p>And this is almoſt Univerſal in all Propoſiti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons that begin with <hi>It is,</hi> and where after<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards follows <hi>(who)</hi> or <hi>(that)</hi> to have the Attribute at the beginning, and the Subject at the end. And let this ſuffice for once, to let you ſee, that the examples produc'd de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monſtrate, that we are to judg by the Sence, and not by the order of the words. And this is neceſſary to be known, that we may not be deceiv'd in taking thoſe for falſe Syllogiſms, that are really true. For that want of di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcerning the Subject and the Attribute in the Propoſitions, we believe 'em contrary when they are conformable to the Rules.</p>

                     <p>I call Moral Univerſality, that which ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mits ſome exception: For in Moral things it ſuffices, that things are ſo for the moſt part. As St. <hi>Paul</hi> both cites and proves,</p>
                     <p>

                     </p>
                     <p>Or according to the uſual Phraſes,
<q>
                           <l>All Women love to chatt.</l>
                           <l>All Young Men are inconſtant.</l>

                        </q>
In all theſe Propoſitions it ſuffices that it be ſo <hi>for the moſt part,</hi> neither is any thing to be concluded ſtrictly.</p>
                     <p>For as all theſe Propoſitions are not ſo ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neral, but that they admit exceptions, ſo they may render the concluſion falſe. For it could not be particularly inferr'd, that any <hi>Cretan</hi> was a Lyar, or an evil Beaſt, tho the Apoſtle cites in general that Verſe of one of their own Poets.</p>
                     <q>The Cretans are always Lyars, evil Beaſts, and Slow-bellies.</q>
                     <p>For that ſome of that Iſland might not be guilty of thoſe vices which were common to others.</p>
                     <p>Therefore the moderation to be obſerv'd in theſe Concluſions, which are only morally Univerſal, is on the one ſide, to draw from thence with great judgment particular Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cluſions; and on the other ſide, not to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tradict 'em, nor to reject 'em as falſe; tho we may oppoſe certain Inſtances wherein they may ſtray from the Truth, but to be ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tisfy'd, if they may be extended from others

                     </head>
                     <p>There are ſome Propoſitions that ought to paſs for Metaphyſically Univerſal, tho they may admit of Exceptions, that is, when thoſe Exceptions are exotic, and ſuch, as according to common uſe, are not comprehended in thoſe Univerſal Terms. As when I ſay, <hi>All Men have two Arms.</hi> This Propoſition ought to paſs for true, according to ordinary uſe. And it would be but mere brangling to op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe againſt it, that there have been Monſters who were Men, though they had four Arms. It being plain that there was nothing intend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed concerning Monſters, in theſe general Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſitions; and that the only meaning of the Aſſertion was, that according to the order of Nature, all Men had two Arms.</p>
                     <p>In like manner it may be ſaid, that all Men make uſe of words to expreſs their thoughts; but that all Men do not make uſe of writing. Nor would it be a rational Objection to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tradict the truth of the Propoſition, by in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtancing dumb People, becauſe it is evident, though the ſence be not expreſs'd in words, that it was not meant of ſuch as had a natu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral impediment to make uſe of ſounds, either
<pb n="222" facs="tcp:60750:113"/>
clude, it will not be amiſs to ſpeak of another ſort of Knowledge, which ofttimes is no leſs certain, nor leſs evident in its manner, then that which we draw from Authority.</p>
                     <p>For there are two general ways, by which we know a Thing to be true; The firſt is the know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge which we have by our ſelves, whether we have attain'd it by Obſervation or Ratiocination, whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther by our Sences or by our Reaſon; which may be generally term'd <hi>Reaſon,</hi> in regard the Sences themſelves depend upon the judgment of <hi>Reaſon</hi> or <hi>Knowledge;</hi> the word being here more generally taken than in the Schools; for all manner of know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge of an object drawn from the ſame object.</p>
                     <p>The other way is the Authority of Perſons wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thy of credit, who aſſure us that a thing is ſo. Tho of our ſelves we know nothing of it. Which is call'd Faith or Belief, according to the words of St. <hi>Auſtin,</hi> for what we know, we owe to reaſon; for what we believe, to Authority.</p>
                     <p>But as this Authority may be of two ſorts, either from God or Men, ſo there are two ſorts of Faith, Divine and Human.</p>
                     <p>Divine Faith cannot be Subject to error, becauſe that God can neither deceive us nor be deceiv'd.</p>
                     <p>Human Faith is of its ſelf ſubject to error, for all Men are Lyars according to Scripture: And be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe it may happen, that he who ſhall aſſure us of the certainty of a thing, may be deceiv'd himſelf. Nevertheleſs as we have already obſerv'd; there are ſome things which we know not, but by a Hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man Faith, which nevertheleſs we ought to believe for as certain and unqueſtionable, as if they were Mathematically demonſtrated. As that which is
<pb n="223" facs="tcp:60750:113"/>
known by the conſtant relation of ſo many Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons, that it is morally impoſſible they ſhould ever have conſpir'd to affirm the ſame things, if they were not true. For example, Men have been na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turally moſt averſe from conceiving any <hi>Antipodes,</hi> nevertheleſs though we never were in thoſe places, and know nothing of any <hi>Antipodes</hi> but by human Faith, he muſt be a Fool that does not believe 'em. And he muſt be out of his wits, who queſtions whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther ever there were any ſuch Perſons as <hi>Caeſar, Pom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pey, Cicero</hi> or <hi>Virgil,</hi> or whether they were not feigned Names, as <hi>Amadis de Gaul.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>True it is, that it is a difficult thing to know when Human Faith has attain'd to this ſame aſſurance; and this is that which leads Men aſtray into two ſuch oppoſite Deviations: So that ſome believe too ſlight<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly upon the leaſt report. Others ridiculouſly make uſe of all the force of their wit, to annul the belief of things atteſted by the greateſt authority, when it thwarts the prejudice of their underſtanding. And therefore certain Limits are to be aſſign'd, which Faith muſt exceed to obtain this aſſurance; and o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers, beyond which there is nothing but uncertain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty, leaving in the middle a certain ſpace, where we ſhall meet with certainty or uncertainty, as we approach nearer to the one or the other of theſe Bounds.</p>
                     <p>Now then if we do but compare the two gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral ways, by which we believe a thing to be true, Reaſon and Faith; certain it is, that Faith always ſuppoſes ſome Reaſon. For as St. <hi>Auſtin</hi> ſays in his 122. Epiſtle, and in ſeveral other places, we could never bring our ſelves to believe that which is above our reaſon, if reaſon it ſelf had not perſwaded us,

that there are ſome things which we do well to be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve, tho' we are not capable to apprehend 'em, Which is principally true in reſpect of Divine Faith. For true Reaſon teaches us, that God being truth it ſelf, he cannot deceive us in what he reveals to us concerning his Nature and his Myſteries; whence it appears that though we are oblig'd to captivate our Underſtanding in obedience to Faith, as ſaith St. <hi>Paul,</hi> yet we do it neither blindly nor unreaſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nably (which is the original of all falſe Religions;) but with a knowledg of the Cauſe, and for that it is but a reaſonable Act to Captivate our ſelves to the Authority of God, when he has given us ſuffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cient Proofs, ſuch as are his Miracles and other Prodigious Accidents, which oblige us to believe that he himſelf has diſcovered to Men the Truths which we are to believe.</p>
                     <p>As certain it is in the ſecond Place, that divine Faith ought to have a greater Power over our Underſtanding then our own Reaſon. And that upon this Dictate of Reaſon it ſelf, that the more certain is to be prefer'd before the leſs certain; and that is more certain which God aſſures us to be true, then that which Reaſon perſwades us; when it is more contrary to the Nature of God to deceive us, then the nature of our own Reaſon to be deceiv'd.</p>

                  <head>CHAP. XIII. <hi>Certain Rules for the guidance of Reaſon, the belief of Events that depend upon Human Faith.</hi>
                  </head>
                  <p>THE moſt cuſtomary uſe of ſound Judgment, and that faculty of the Soul, by which we diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cern Truth from falſhood is not employ'd in ſpecu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lative Sciences, about which ſo few Perſons are o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>blig'd to ſpend their time, and yet there is no occaſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on wherein it is more frequently to be made uſe of, and where its more neceſſary then in that Judgment which we ought to make of what paſſes every day among Men.</p>
                  <p>I do not ſpeak of judging whether an Action be good or bad, worthy of applauſe or reproof, for that belongs to the regulation of Morallity; but of judging of the Truth or Falſhood of human E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vents, which may only be referr'd to Logic, whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther we conſider 'em as paſt, as when we only en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deavour to know whether we ought to believe 'em or not; or whether we conſider 'em as being to come, as when we fear or hope they will come to paſs, which regulates our hopes and our fears.</p>
                  <p>Certain it is, that ſome Reflexions may be made upon this Subject; which perhaps may not be alto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether unprofitable, or rather may be of great uſe for the avoiding of certain Errors into which moſt People fall, becauſe they do not ſufficiently ſtudy the Rules of Reaſon.</p>
                  <p>
                     <pb n="226" facs="tcp:60750:115"/>
The firſt Reflexion is, that there is a vaſt diffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rence to be made between two ſorts of Truths; the one that only relates to the nature of things, and their Immutable Eſſences abſtracted from their exiſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence, the other that relates to things exiſtent that re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>late to human and contingent events, which may or may not come to paſs when we ſpeak of the future, and may probably never have been, when we talk of what is paſt. I ſpeak this with reference to their next cauſes, making an abſtraction of their Immu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>table order in Divine Providence; becauſe on the one ſide it does not hinder Contingence, and on the other ſide being unknown to us, it contributes no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing to make us believe the things themſelves.</p>
                  <p>Now as all things are requiſite in truths of the firſt ſort, there is nothing ſure, which is not Uni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſally true, and ſo we muſt conclude that a thing is falſe if it be falſe in any caſe.</p>
                  <p>But if we think to make uſe of the ſame Rules in human Events; we ſhall always judg falſly, and make a thouſand falſe Arguments.</p>
                  <p>For theſe Events being naturally contingent, it would be ridiculous to ſeek out in them for a neceſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſary Truth. And ſo that perſon would be altoge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther void of Reaſon, who would believe nothing of ſuch things unleſs it were made out to him, that it was abſolutely neceſſary they ſhould be ſo.</p>
                  <p>Now would he leſs deviate from Reaſon that would require me to believe any particular Event, (ſuppoſe it were the Converſion of the King of <hi>Chi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>na</hi> to the Chriſtian Religion) upon this only ground, becauſe it is not Impoſſible to be ſo. For ſeeing that another who ſhould aſſure me to the contrary may make uſe of the ſame Reaſon; it is clear that that
<pb n="227" facs="tcp:60750:115"/>
reaſon alone cannot determine me to believe the one rather then the other.</p>
                  <p>We muſt therefore lay it down for a certain and unqueſtionable Maxim upon this occaſion, that the Poſſibillity alone of an Event is not a ſufficient rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon to make me believe it, and that I may have rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon alſo to believe a thing, tho I judg it not impoſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſible, but that the contrary may have come to paſs; So that of the Two Events I may rationally believe the one and not the other, tho I believe 'em both poſſible.</p>
                  <p>How then ſhall we reſolve to believe the one ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther than the other, if we judg 'em both poſſible? Obſerve the following Rule.</p>
                  <p>To judge of the Truth of an Event, and to per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwade my ſelf into a Reſolution to believe, or not to believe a thing; it muſt not be conſider'd naked<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, and in it ſelf, like a Propoſition in Geometry; but all the circumſtances that accompany it, as well internal as external, are to be weigh'd with the ſame conſideration; I call Internal Circumſtances ſuch as belong to the Fact it ſelf; and external, thoſe that relate to the Perſons, whoſe Teſtimonies induce us believe it. This being done, if all the Circum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtances are ſuch, that it never, or very rarely hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pens, that the ſame Circumſtances are accompa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny'd with Falſhood: Our Underſtanding naturally carrys to believe the thing to be true; and there is a reaſon for ſo doing, eſpecially in the Conduct of the Actions of our Life, that never requires a greater aſſurance than a moral Certainty, and which is ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tisfy'd upon moſt occaſions with a great Probability.</p>
                  <p>But on the other ſide, if theſe Circumſtances are ſuch as are frequently accompany'd with Falſhood;
<pb n="228" facs="tcp:60750:116"/>
Reaſon requires us to ſuſpend our Belief; or that we ſhould look upon as falſe what is told us, when we ſee no likelyhood, that it ſhould be true, tho we do not find any abſolute Impoſſibility.</p>
                  <p>For Example, we demand, whether the Hiſtory of the Baptiſm of <hi>Conſtantine</hi> by <hi>Silveſter</hi> be true, or falſe? <hi>Baronius</hi> believes it true; but Cardinal <hi>Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ron,</hi> Biſhop <hi>Spondanus, Petavius, Morinus,</hi> and the moſt eminent of the <hi>Roman</hi> Church believe it falſe. Now if we inſiſt upon the ſole Poſſibility, we have no reaſon to reject <hi>Baronius.</hi> For his opinion contains nothing abſolutely impoſſible; and to ſpeak abſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lutely, it is alſo poſſible, that <hi>Euſebius,</hi> who affirms the contrary, affirm'd an untruth in favour of the <hi>Arrians;</hi> and that the Fathers that follow'd him were deceiv'd by his Teſtimony. But if we make uſe of the Rule already laid down, which is to conſider what are the Circumſtances both of the one and the other Baptiſm of <hi>Conſtantine,</hi> and which are thoſe that carry the greateſt marks of Truth, we ſhall find 'em to be the latter. For on the one ſide, there is no great reaſon to rely upon the Teſtimony of a Wri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter as fabulous as the Author of the Acts of <hi>Syl<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veſter</hi> who is the only perſon of Antiquity, who has ſpoken of <hi>Conſtantin</hi>'s being baptiz'd at <hi>Rome.</hi> And on the other ſide there is no liklihood that a Perſon ſo Serious and Learned as <hi>Euſebius</hi> ſhould preſume to report an untruth relating to a thing ſo remarkable, as the Baptiſm of the firſt Empe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ror that reſtor'd the Church to her Liberty, and which ought to have been ſpread over all the World, at the ſame time that he wrote, which was not above four or five Hundred years after the Death of the ſaid Emperor.</p>
                  <p>
                     <pb n="229" facs="tcp:60750:116"/>
Nevertheleſs there is an Exception to this Rule, by which we ought to be ſatisfied with poſſibillity or likelihood. That is, when an action, which is otherwiſe ſufficiently atteſted, is contradicted by In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>congruities, and apparent contrarieties with other Hiſtories.</p>
                  <p>For then it ſuffices that the Solutions brought to enervate theſe Repugnancies be poſſible and proba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble; and it would be unreaſonable to require other poſitive Proofs; for that the Act it ſelf being ſuffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciently prov'd, it is not equitable to require that we ſhould prove all the Circumſtances in the ſame manner. Otherwiſe we might call in queſtion a thouſand moſt certain Hiſtories, which we cannot make agree with others of leſs Authority, but by Conjectures which it is impoſſible to prove poſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tively.</p>
                  <p>For example, we cannot bring to an agreement what is deliver'd in the <hi>Kings</hi> and <hi>Chronicles</hi> concern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the years of the Reigns of ſeveral of the Kings of <hi>Juda</hi> and <hi>Iſrael,</hi> but by aſſigning to ſome of the Kings, two beginnings of their Reigns, the one du<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring the Life of the Reigning Prince, and the other after the deceaſe of their Parents. Now if it be ask'd what Proof we have that ſuch a Prince raign'd for ſome time with his Father; we muſt confeſs there is none Poſitive. But it ſuffices that it is a thing Poſſible, and which has often come to paſs at other times, to make it Lawful for us to ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe it, as a Cicumſtance neceſſary to reconcile Hi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtories otherwiſe certain.</p>
                  <p>And therefore there is nothing more ridiculous then the endeavours of ſome perſons of this latter Age, to prove that St. <hi>Peter</hi> never was at <hi>Rome.</hi>
                     <pb n="230" facs="tcp:60750:117"/>
They cannot deny this Truth to be atteſted by all the Eccleſiaſtic Writers, and thoſe the moſt ancient, as <hi>Papias, Dioniſius of Corinth, Caius, Irenaeus, Tertullian;</hi> againſt whom there is not any one that has made the the leaſt Contradiction.</p>
                  <p>Nevertheleſs they imagine they can ruin this Truth by Conjectures; for example, becauſe St. <hi>Paul</hi> makes no mention of St. <hi>Peter</hi> in his Epiſtles written to <hi>Rome;</hi> and when they are anſwer'd that St. <hi>Peter</hi> might be then abſent from <hi>Rome,</hi> in re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gard he is not ſaid to have fix'd his ſeat there, as being one that often travail'd abroad to Preach the Goſpel in other places; they reply that this is urg'd without any Proof, which is Impertinent, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe the Act which they oppoſe, being one of the moſt confirm'd Truths in Eccleſiaſtical Hiſtory, it is ſufficient for thoſe that uphold it to reconcile theſe pretended Contrarieties, as they do thoſe of the Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture it ſelf; for which, as we have ſhew'd Poſſibilli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty is ſufficient.</p>

                  <head>CHAP. VII. <hi>An Application of the preceeding Rule to the Belief of Miracles.</hi>
                  </head>
                  <p>THE <hi>Rule</hi> which we have explain'd is without doubt of great Importance for the well re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gulating our Reaſon in the belief of particular Acts. For want of the due Obſervation of which we are in great danger of falling into the two dangerous extremities of Credulity and Incredulity.</p>
                  <p>
                     <pb n="231" facs="tcp:60750:117"/>
For example, there are ſome, who make a Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcience of queſtioning any Miracle; becauſe they have a fancy, that they ſhould be oblig'd to queſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on all, ſhould they queſtion any; and for that they are perſwaded, that it is enough for them, by know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing that all things are poſſible with God, to believe whatever is told 'em touching the Effects of his Om<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nipotency.</p>
                  <p>Others as ridiculouſly imagin, that it is in the Power of the Underſtanding to call all Miracles in queſtion, for no other reaſon, becauſe ſo many have been related that have prov'd to be falſe, and therefore there is no more reaſon to believe the one than the other.</p>
                  <p>The Inclination of the firſt is much more tolera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble than that of the latter; tho true it is, that both the one and the other argue equally amiſs.</p>
                  <p>They both depend upon common Places. The firſt upon the Power and Goodneſs of God; upon certain and unqueſtionable Miracles, which they bring for proof of thoſe that are called in queſtion; and upon the Blindneſs of <hi>Libertines;</hi> who will be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve nothing, but what is proportionable to their Reaſon. All this is very good in it's ſelf; but very weak to convince us of a particular Miracle. For God does not always act according to his Power; nor is it an Argument, that a Miracle was wrought, becauſe others of the ſame nature have been wrought. And we may do well to believe, what is a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bove our Reaſon, without being oblig'd to believe all that Men are pleas'd to obtrude upon us, as being a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bove our Reaſon.</p>
                  <p>The latter make uſe of common Places of ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther ſort.</p>
                  <p>
                     <pb n="232" facs="tcp:60750:118"/>
                     <hi>Truth</hi> ſays one of 'em, <hi>and Falſhood appear with Countenances alike; the ſame Gate, the ſame Steps we behold with the ſame Eyes. I have ſeen the riſe of ſeveral miracles in my Time. And tho' they vaniſh'd in the birth, yet we cannot but foreſee the Train they would have gathered, had they liv'd to their full Age. For it is but to find out the end of the Thread, and to cut it into as many peices as we pleaſe, and there is not a greater diſtance between nothing and the ſmalleſt thing in the World, then there is between this and the greateſt. Now the firſt that were intoxicated with this beginning of No<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>velty, coming to ſpread their Hiſtory, find by the op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſition which they meet with, where the difficulty of Perſwaſion lodges, and make it their buſineſs to Fucus over that part of a falſe Peice. Particular Error firſt cau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes publick Miſtake, and afterwards publick miſtake cau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes particular Error. Thus the whole Structure of the miracle by ſome pull'd down, by others upheld, and by addition enlarg'd at length grows up to a conſiderable Pile. So that the moſt remote Witneſs is better inſtru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cted then he that lives cloſe by, and the laſt that heard of it, better confirm'd then the firſt Publiſher.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>This Diſcourſe is ingenious, and may be profita<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble to prevent us from being led away with every Idle Report. But it would be an Extravagance from hence to conclude generally that we ought to ſuſpect whatever is ſaid of Miracles. For certain it is, that what is here alledg'd relates only to thoſe things which are taken up upon common Fame, without enquiring into the original cauſe of the Report. And we have no reaſon to be confident of what we know upon no better grounds.</p>
                  <p>
                     <pb n="233" facs="tcp:60750:118"/>
But who ſo blind as not to ſee that we may make a common place oppoſite to this, and that at leaſt upon as good a Foundation?</p>
                  <p>For as there are ſome miracles that would de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerve but little credit, ſhould we enquire into their Original, ſo there are others that vaniſh out of the memories of Men, or which find but little credit in their judgments, becauſe they will not take the pains to inform themſelves. Our underſtanding is not ſubject only to one ſort of diſtemper, but ſeveral, and thoſe quite contrary. There is a ſottiſh ſtupi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dity, that believes all things the leaſt probable. But there is a conceited preſumption that condemns for falſe, whatever ſurpaſes the narrow limits of the underſtanding. Sometimes we hunt after trifles, and neglect things of greateſt moment. Falſe ſto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries ſpread themſelves every where, while true ones can hardly get liberty to creep abroad.</p>
                  <p>Few Perſons have heard of the miracle that hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pen'd in our time, at <hi>Faramonſtier,</hi> in the Perſon of a Nun, ſo blind, that hardly the Balls of her Eyes were left in her Head, who recover'd her ſight by touching the Reliques of St. <hi>Fara,</hi> as I am aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſur'd by the Teſtimony of a Perſon that ſaw her in both conditions.</p>
                  <p>St. <hi>Auſtin</hi> affirms, that many real miracles were wrought in his time, that were known but to few; and which, though moſt remarkable and wonder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful, ſpread no farther then from one end of the Town to the other. Which induc'd him to write, and relate, in his Sermons, to the People, ſuch as were moſt certain. And he obſerves in his <hi>Twenty ſecond Book of the City of God,</hi> that in the ſingle ci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty of <hi>Hippo,</hi> near Seventy Miracles were wr<gap reason="illegible" extent="5 letters">
                        <desc>•••••</desc>
                     </gap>
                     <pb n="234" facs="tcp:60750:119"/>
within two years after the Building of a Chappel in Honour of St. <hi>Stephen,</hi> beſides a great number of others which he did not commit to writing, which however he teſtifies to be true upon his know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge.</p>
                  <p>We therefore ſee that there is nothing more irra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tional, then to guide our ſelves by common places, upon theſe occaſions; whether it be in rejecting all Miracles, or embracing all. And therefore we muſt examin 'em by their particular Circumſtances, and by the credit and knowledg of the Reporters.</p>
                  <p>Piety does not not oblige a Man of Sence to believe all the Miracles in the <hi>Golden Legend</hi> or the <hi>Metaphraſt:</hi> In regard thoſe Books are ſo full of Fables, that there is nothing to be credi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted upon their Authority: As Cardinal <hi>Bellarmin</hi> has made no ſcruple to confeſs of the laſt.</p>
                  <p>But I affirm, that every Man of Sence, bating his Piety, ought to acknowledge for true the Mira<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cles which St <hi>Auſtin</hi> recites in his Confeſſions and his Book <hi>de Civitate Dei,</hi> ſome of which he ſaw, and others of which he was inform'd by the Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons themſelves, in whoſe ſight they were wrought. As of the Blind Man cur'd at <hi>Milan</hi> before all the People, by touching the Relics of St. <hi>Gervace</hi> and <hi>Protaſius,</hi> which he reports in his Confeſſion, and of which he ſpeaks in the <hi>22d.</hi> Book <hi>de Civi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tate Dei,</hi> cap. 8. <hi>A certain Miracle was wrought at</hi> Milan, <hi>when we were there, when a Blind Man was reſtor'd to his ſight, which could not be unknown to Thouſands; For it is a large City, and there was then the Emperor; and the thing was done before a vaſt Multitude of People, crowding to the Bodies of the Martyrs, St.</hi> Gervaſe <hi>and</hi> Protaſius.</p>
                  <p>
                     <pb n="235" facs="tcp:60750:119"/>
Of a Woman cur'd in <hi>Africa</hi> by Flowrs that had touch'd the Relics of St. <hi>Stephen,</hi> as he teſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fies in the ſame Book.</p>
                  <p>Of a Lady of Quality cur'd of a Cancer by the ſign of the Croſs which ſhe caus'd to be made up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on the Soar, by one that was newly Baptiz'd ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to a Revelation which ſhe had had.</p>
                  <p>Of a Child that dy'd unbaptiz'd, whoſe reſto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration to Life the Mother obtain'd by her prayers to St. <hi>Peter,</hi> in the ſtrength of her Faith, invo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king him in theſe words, <hi>Holy Martyr reſtore me my Son: thou knoweſt, I ask his Life for no other reaſon, but becauſe he ſhould not be eternally ſeparated from God.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Now if theſe things may be ſuppos'd to have happen'd as they are related, there is no rational Perſon but muſt acknowledge theſe things to be the Finger of God. So that all their Incredulity could do, would be to doubt of the Teſtimony of St. <hi>Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtin,</hi> and to believe him a falſifyer of the Truth, to gain a Veneration of the Chriſtian Religion a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mong the <hi>Pagans.</hi> Which is that which they have no colour to imagine.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Firſt,</hi> becauſe it is not likely that a Perſon of his judgment would have told an untruth in things ſo public, wherein he might have been convinc'd of falſhood by infinite Numbers of Teſtimonies, which would have redounded to the Ignominy of the Chriſtian Religion.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Secondly,</hi> becauſe there was never any Perſon more a profeſs'd Enemy of Falſhood, then this Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly Man, eſpecially in matters of Religion, having made it the work of entire Treatiſes, to prove that it is not only unlawful to tell a lie; but a thing ſo de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teſtable,
<pb n="236" facs="tcp:60750:120"/>
that it is not to be made uſe of, though for the Converſion of Men to the Chriſtian Faith.</p>
                  <p>I have the more enlarg'd my ſelf upon this re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>markable example, of the judgment that is to be made of the Truth of Actions, to ſerve as a Rule upon the like occaſions, becauſe we moſt common<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly deviate in thoſe things. For every one thinks, that it is ſufficient for the deciſion of theſe to make a common Place, which for the moſt part is only compos'd of Maxims, which not only are not Uni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſally True, but not ſo much as probable when they are joyn'd with the particular Circumſtances of Actions, that fall under Examination. And therefore Circumſtances are to be compar'd and conſider'd together, not conſider'd a part. For it often happens, that an Act which is not very pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bable in one Circumſtance, ought to be eſteem'd and taken for certain, according to other Circum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtances: And on the other ſide, an Action which appears to us true, according to one Circumſtance which is uſually joyn'd with truth, ought to be deem'd falſe, according to other weakning Circumſtances, as we ſhall make out in the following Chapter.</p>

                  <p>THere is yet one other Remark of great Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, to make upon the Belief of Events. Which is, that among thoſe Circumſtances which we ought to conſider, that we may know whether credit be to be given to the Fact, or no; there are ſome which we may call <hi>common Circumſtances,</hi> be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe they frequently occur; and are far oftner joyn'd to Truth then Falſhood, and then if they be not Counter-ballanc'd by other particular Circumſtan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces, that ruin the motives of belief drawn from common Circumſtances, we have reaſon to believe thoſe events, if not to be certain, yet at leaſt to be probable; which probability is ſufficient, when we are bound to pronounce our opinion in ſuch caſes. For as we ought to be ſatisfy'd with a moral aſſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rance, in things not capable of Metaphyſical cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainty; ſo when we cannot obtain a full moral aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſurance, the beſt we can do, when we are to reſolve, is to embrace the moſt probable; for it would be contrary to reaſon to embrace the leaſt probable.</p>
                  <p>But if on the other ſide theſe common Circum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtances, which would have induc'd us to believe a thing, be joyn'd with other particular Circumſtan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces that ruin the motives of belief, drawn from common Circumſtances, or be ſuch as are rarely
<pb n="238" facs="tcp:60750:121"/>
found without falſehood, we are not then any lon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger to believe that event. But either we remain in ſuſpence, if the particular Circumſtances enfeeble the weight of common Circumſtances, or we be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve the action to be falſe, if the Circumſtances are ſuch as are uſually the marks of Falſhood.</p>
                  <p>For example, it is a common Circumſtance, for many Contracts to be ſign'd by two public Nota<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries; that is, by two public Perſons, whoſe chiefeſt Intereſt it is to be juſt and true in their employ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments, becauſe not only their Conſcience and Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>putation, but their Lives and Eſtates lie at Stake. This conſideration alone is ſufficient, if we know no other particularities of the contract, to make us believe that the Contract is not Antidated. Not but that it might be ſo; but becauſe it is certain, that of a Thouſand Contracts, Nine Hundred Ninety Nine are not. So that it is infinitely more probable, that this contract is one of the Nine Hundred Ninety Nine, then the only Antidated Contract of a Thou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſand. So that if withal, the integrity of the No<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tary that ſign'd it be known to me, I ſhall moſt cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainly believe, that there is no foul play in the Writing.</p>
                  <p>But if to this common Circumſtance of being ſign'd by two Notaries, there are joyn'd other par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticular Circumſtances, as that the Notaries are Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons of no Conſcience or Reputation, ſo that they might be inſtrumental in falſifying the deed, yet ſhall not this make me conclude that the deed is antidated. But if beſides all theſe, I can diſcover other proofs of the Antidate, either by Witneſſes or convincing Arguments, as the inability of the Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon to lend Twenty Thouſand Crowns, at a time
<pb n="239" facs="tcp:60750:121"/>
when it ſhall be demonſtrable that he had not a Hundred in caſh, I will then reſolve to beleive the contract to be falſify'd, and it were unreaſonable for any Perſon to believe me to believe otherwiſe; and I ſhould do ill, to ſuſpect others, where I did not however ſee the ſame marks or Falſhood, not to be falſe, ſince they might be as well Counterfeit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed as the other.</p>
                  <p>We may apply all this to ſeveral matters that cauſe frequent diſputes among the Learned. We demand if ſuch a Book were written by ſuch an Author whoſe Name was always to it? And whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther the Acts of a Council are True or Counter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feit?</p>
                  <p>Certain it is, that we ought to give Sentence for the Author, whoſe name has been long acknoledg'd and affix'd to the Work; and for the Acts of a Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cil which we read every day; nor are we to believe the contrary, but upon very ſtrong Reaſons.</p>
                  <p>Therefore a moſt learned Perſon of this Age, being to prove, that the Epiſtle of <hi>Cyprian</hi> to Pope <hi>Steven,</hi> about <hi>Martian</hi> Biſhop of <hi>Arles,</hi> was none of the Holy Martyrs, he could not convince the Learned, his Conjectures not ſeeming ſufficient to deprive St. <hi>Cyprian</hi> of a Peice that had always car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry'd his Name, and which has a perfect reſemblance of Style, with the reſt of his Works.</p>
                  <p>In vain alſo it is, that <hi>Blondel</hi> and <hi>Salmaſius,</hi> not able to anſwer the Argument drawn from the Epi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtles of <hi>Ignatius,</hi> for the ſuperiority of Biſhops a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bove Prieſts, in the Infancy of the Church, pretend thoſe Epiſtles to be Counterfeit, though as they were Printed by <hi>Voſſius</hi> and <hi>
                        <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>ſher,</hi> from the An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tient Manuſcript in the <hi>Florentine</hi> Library: Inſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>much
<pb n="240" facs="tcp:60750:122"/>
that they have been refut'd by thoſe of their own party. For that confeſſing as they do, that we have the ſame Epiſtles which were cited by <hi>Eu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſebius,</hi> St. <hi>Jerom, Theodoret,</hi> and <hi>Origen</hi> him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf, there is no likelihood that the Epiſtles of <hi>Ig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>natius,</hi> being collected by <hi>Polycarp,</hi> that the true Epiſtles ſhould have diſappear'd, and others be coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terfeited in the time between <hi>Polycarp</hi> and <hi>Origen</hi> or <hi>Euſebius.</hi> Beſides that thoſe Epiſtles of <hi>Ignati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>us,</hi> which we have now wear ſuch a Character of the holineſs and ſimplicity, ſo proper to the Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtolic Times, that they juſtifie themſelves againſt the vain accuſations of being falſe and counterfeit.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Laſtly,</hi> all the difficulties that Cardinal <hi>Perron</hi> propoſes againſt the Epiſtles of the Council of <hi>A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fric,</hi> to Pope <hi>Celeſtin<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
                     </hi> touching Appeals to the See, cannot prevail with us to beleive otherwiſe now then before, but that thoſe Epiſtles were really written by the Council.</p>
                  <p>But it happens ſometimes that particular Circum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtances carry more weight in Perſwaſion, then long Poſſeſſion.</p>
                  <p>So that altho' the Epiſtle of St. <hi>Clement</hi> to St. <hi>James</hi> Biſhop of <hi>Jeruſalem</hi> be tranſlated by <hi>Ruffinus,</hi> near upon thirteen hundred Years ago, and that it is cited and own'd for St. <hi>Clement</hi> by a Council of <hi>France,</hi> above twelve Hundred years ago, yet we can hardly believe it otherwiſe then Counterfeit. In regard that St. <hi>James</hi> being Martyr'd before St. <hi>Peter,</hi> it is impoſſible that St. <hi>Clement</hi> ſhould write after the Death of St. <hi>Peter,</hi> as the Epiſtle ſuppoſes.</p>
                  <p>Thus tho the Commentaries upon St. <hi>Paul</hi> are attributed to St. <hi>Ambroſe,</hi> and cited under his Name by a great number of Authors, together with that
<pb n="241" facs="tcp:60750:122"/>
imperfect Work upon St. <hi>Mathem,</hi> under the name of <hi>Chryſoſtome.</hi> All Men however at this day agree that they belong to neither, but to other antient Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thors full of many Errors.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Laſtly,</hi> the Acts of the two <hi>Sinueſſan</hi> Councils under <hi>Marcellin,</hi> and two or three at <hi>Rome,</hi> under <hi>Silveſter,</hi> and another at <hi>Rome</hi> under <hi>Sixtus</hi> III. might be ſufficient to perſwade us of the verity of thoſe Councils, if they contain'd nothing but what were congruous to reaſon, and which might be pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per for the times, wherein they are ſaid to be Ce<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lebrated; but they contain ſo many abſurdities, ſo diſagreeable from thoſe times, that there is great likelihood of their being falſe and counterfeit.</p>
                  <p>And theſe are the Remarks which may ſerve for theſe ſorts of judgments. But we muſt not ima<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gin 'em to be of ſuch great uſe, as always to free us from the danger of being deceiv'd. All that they can do at moſt, is to guard us from the more groſs and apparent Abſurdities, and to enure us not to be carry'd aſtray by common Places, which contain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing ſomething of general Truth, ceaſe not however to be falſe upon many particular occaſions, which is one of the chiefeſt ſources of human Error.</p>

                  <head>CHAP. XVI. <hi>Of the Judgments we ought to make of Future Accidents.</hi>
                  </head>
                  <p>THeſe Rules that ſerve us to judge of Things paſt, may be apply'd to things to come. For as we probably judge a Thing to have come to paſs, when the certain Circumſtances which we know to be uſually joyn'd to the Fact; we may as probably believe that ſuch a thing will happen, when the preſent Circumſtances are ſuch as are u<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſually attended by ſuch an Effect. Thus the Phy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſitians judge of the good or bad ſucceſs of Diſeaſes; Captain of the future Events of War; and that we judge in the world of the moſt part of contin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gent Affairs.</p>
                  <p>But as to theſe Accidents of which we are ſome part our ſelves, and which we may either promote or prevent by our care and foreſight, in avoiding or expoſing our ſelves to harm or danger; it hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pens that moſt perſons fall into many errors, ſo much the more greivous, by how much they ſeem to be guarded by reaſon; becauſe they only ſet before their Eyes, the Grandeur and conſequence of the advantage which they wiſh for, or the miſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chiefs that they fear, not conſidering the likelihood and probability that this advantage or inconve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nience may happen or not happen.</p>
                  <p>In like manner, when it is any great misfortune which they fear, as loſs of Life or Eſtate, they
<pb n="243" facs="tcp:60750:123"/>
think it prudence not to take any care to prevent it. Or if it be any great advantage which they expect, as the gain of a Hundred Thouſand Crowns, they think they act wiſely to endeavour the gain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of it, if the Venter coſt but little, let the pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bability of ſucceſs be never ſo ſmall.</p>
                  <p>By ſuch a Ratiocination as this it was, that a Princeſs hearing that ſome Perſons had been over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>whelm'd by the fall of a Roof, would never go in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to a Houſe, 'till ſhe had all the Roofs firſt view'd; and ſhe was ſo fully perſwaded, that ſhe had a rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon for ſo doing, that ſhe accounted all other im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prudent, that did not as ſhe did.</p>
                  <p>'Tis alſo this appearance of Reaſon, that engages ſeveral Perſons into inconvenient and exceſſive cauti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons for the preſervation of their Health. This is that which renders others diſtruſtful even in little Things; for that having been ſometimes deceiv'd, they believe they ſhall be deceiv'd in all their other Buſineſs.</p>
                  <p>This is that which enveagles ſo many People to Lotteries, to gain, cry they, Twenty Thouſand Crowns for one Crown, is not that a very great ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vantage? And every one believes himſelf ſhall be that happy Perſon, upon whom this great Fortune ſhall ſhowr it ſelf: Never conſidering, that though the Lots promiſe Twenty Thouſand for One, 'tis Thirty times more probable to every particular perſon, that he ſhall be a looſer then a winner.</p>
                  <p>And this is the Defect of this Ratiocination; for that we may judge what is fit to be done, to ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain the good and avoid the evil, we ought not only to conſider the good and the evil in its ſelf; but al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſo the probability whether it may happen or no; and Geometrically to conſider the Proportion which
<pb n="244" facs="tcp:60750:124"/>
the things hold together; which may be demonſtra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted by this Example.</p>
                  <p>Ten Men at play, ſtake every one a Crown, there is but one can win the whole Stake, all the reſt are looſers. So that every one has theſe two chan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces, either to looſe One Crown or win Nine. Now if we ſhould conſider only the gain and loſs in them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves, it might ſeem that all had an equal advan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tage: But we are to conſider moreover, that if e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>very one may win Nine Crowns, and can only looſe one, it is alſo nine times more probable in reſpect of every one, that he ſhall looſe his One, then win the Nine; while every Man has nine De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>grees of Probability to looſe one Crown, and but one degree of Probability to gain Nine; which equals the hopes and fears of Gain and Loſs.</p>
                  <p>All Plays of this Nature, are as equitable as Plays can be, but all that are not under this Equal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lity of Lots are unjuſt. And hence it is that it may be plainly made out, that there is an evident Inju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtice in all ſorts of Lotteries; for the Maſter of the Lottery uſually claiming the tenth part of the whole Fund for his own ſhare, the whole crowd of thoſe that play is cheated in the ſame manner as if a Man playing at a Game, wherein there were as much likelihood of winning as looſing ſhould Play nine Piſtols to one. Now if this be diſadvantageous to the whole Crowd, it muſt be alſo the ſame to eve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry particular perſon, becauſe the Probability of looſing, far more ſurpaſſes the Probability of gain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, then the advantage we hope for, the diſadvan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tage of Looſing.</p>
                  <p>Sometimes there is ſo little likelihood in the ſuc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſs of a thing, that how advantageous ſo ever it
<pb n="245" facs="tcp:60750:124"/>
be, and how ſmall ſoever the hazard of winning, it is better not to hazard. Thus it would be a foo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liſh thing to play twenty <hi>Sols</hi> againſt ten Millions of <hi>Livres,</hi> or againſt a Kingdom, upon condition he ſhould not win, unleſs ſuch an Infant taking out the Letters out of a Printers Caſe by accident, did all of a ſuddain Compoſe the firſt twenty Verſes of <hi>Virgil's Aeneiads.</hi> For indeed there are few Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments ſcape us, wherein we do not run the Riſco of looſing more, than a King that ſhould ſtake his Kingdom to ſuch a Condition.</p>
                  <p>Theſe Reflexions ſeem of little value, and are ſo indeed if weſtop here; but we may make uſe of 'em in matters of greater Importance; and the chiefeſt uſe we can make of 'em is to render us more rational in our hopes and fears. For Example, there are ſome Perſons that are in a Pannic dread when they hear it Thunder; which clatter and hurly-burly in the Sky, if it put 'em in mind of God and Death, 'tis well; but if only the fear of being Thunder-ſtruck cauſes this extraordinary ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prehenſion, then it will eaſily appear how little Rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon they have. For of two Millions of Perſons 'tis very much if one be kill'd in that manner: and we may alſo averr, that there is no ſort of violent Death happens ſo rarely. Since then the fear of miſchief ought to be Proportionable to the great<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs of the danger, and the Probability of the E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vent, as there is no ſort of danger that ſo rarely be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>falls us as to be kill'd with Thunder, ſo have we the leaſt reaſon to fear it: ſince that fear will no way avail us to avoid it.</p>
                  <p>Hence Arguments may be produc'd not only to undeceive ſuch People as are ſo over moroſely and
<pb n="246" facs="tcp:60750:125"/>
unſeaſonably cautious in the Preſervation of their Health and Lives, by ſhewing 'em that thoſe Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cautions are much more miſcheivous then the dan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger ſo remote from the accident which they fear; but alſo to diſabuſe another ſort that always argue thus in other affairs, there is danger in this Buſineſs, therefore it is evil. There is Profit in this, there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore it is good: In regard we are not to judg of thoſe things, either by the danger or the advantage, but by their proportion one with another.</p>
                  <p>It is the Nature of things Finite to be exceeded, how bulky ſoever they be by the leaſt of things, if multiplied often enough; or if the little things are far more Superiour to the great ones in probability of Event, then they are inferiour to 'em in big<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs.</p>
                  <p>For an Atome may exceed a Mountain if it be ſufficiently multiplied, or if this great Good we wiſh for is ſo difficult to be obtain'd, that it ſurpaſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes the little one more in Magnitude, then the little one ſurpaſſes the greater in facility of being obtain'd. The ſame is to be ſaid of thoſe miſchiefs which we fear; that is, that the leaſt Evil may be more con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiderable then the greateſt Evil, which is not Infinite, if it ſurpaſs it according to this Proportion.</p>
                  <p>There are nothing but Infinite things that can be equall'd by any temporal advantage, and therefore they are never to be put in the Ballance with any of the things of this Word. And therefore the leaſt degree of Facility for a Man to ſave himſelf is worth all the felicities of this World join'd together. And the leaſt danger of looſing it is more conſide<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rable then all temporal miſcheifs, if only look'd upon as Misfortunes.</p>
                  <p>
                     <pb n="247" facs="tcp:60750:125"/>
And this may be ſufficient, for all rational perſons to draw from what has been ſaid, this Concluſion, with which we will end our Logic. <hi>That the grea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teſt of all Imprudence, and higheſt of all Madneſſes is this, to ſpend our Lives and our Time in any thing elſe then in what may be ſerviceable to acquire us a Life that never ſhall have any end.</hi> Since the Good and Evil of this Life is nothing, if compar'd to the feli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cities and ſufferings of the other; and the danger of falling into the one is as great as the difficulty of acquiring the other.</p>
                  <p>They who draw this Concluſion, and follow it is the conduct of their Lives, are Prudent and Wiſe, let 'em be never ſo unlearned in Arguments con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cening the Sciences. Whereas they who neglect it, tho never ſo Learned in other things, are call'd in Scripture Fools, Madmen, and make but an ill uſe of Logic, Reaſon, or their Lives.</p>
