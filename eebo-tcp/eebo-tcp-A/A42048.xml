            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

of the Goſpell of Jeſus Chriſt.</hi> And that this is indeed <hi>Operis Titulus,</hi> the <hi>Title</hi> of his <hi>whole</hi> Book, which comprehends the ſumme of all his following Diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>courſe, and ſheweth that his deſign was to treat of <hi>nothing</hi> elſe but <hi>Chriſt,</hi> is the acknowledgement of <hi>Eraſmus,</hi> who denieth St. <hi>Matthew</hi>'s Title ſo to be and doe.</p>
            <p>And what is the Subject <hi>Matter</hi> of St. <hi>Luke</hi>'s Goſpel,<note place="margin">Act. 1.1.</note> himſelf acquaints his friend <hi>Theophilus: The former Treatiſe have I made of all that Jeſus be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gan both to doe and teach. Partitus eſt omnem Chriſti Vitam in Facta &amp; Doctrinam,</hi> ſaith <hi>Eraſmus</hi>; St. <hi>Luke</hi> doth here divide the <hi>whole Life</hi> of <hi>Chriſt</hi> into the <hi>Miracles</hi> which he <hi>wrought,</hi> and the <hi>Sermons</hi> which he <hi>preached</hi>; and tells <hi>Theophilus,</hi> that theſe two were the great <hi>Contents</hi> of his former <hi>Book.</hi> Thus <hi>Grotius: Haec verba brevem Evangelii deſcrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tionem continent</hi>; Theſe words contain a ſhort de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcription of St. <hi>Luke</hi>'s whole <hi>Goſpel,</hi> and ſhew that <hi>Chriſt</hi> is the <hi>Subject</hi> of it.</p>
            <p>And as for the <hi>Acts</hi> of the <hi>Apoſtles, Quid aliud eſt quàm Evangelii pars</hi>? ſaith <hi>Eraſmus,</hi> What is it elſe but a <hi>part</hi> of the <hi>Goſpel</hi>?

            </p>
            <p>And what Saint <hi>John,</hi> our fourth <hi>Evangeliſt,</hi> treats of, the very firſt line of his <hi>Goſpel</hi> tells us, <hi>In the beginning was the Word:</hi> 'Tis but <hi>one Word</hi> that makes up his <hi>whole Book,</hi> and that <hi>Word</hi> is <hi>Chriſt.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>So then, 'tis clear enough that <hi>Chriſt</hi> is the <hi>onely Subject</hi> of all four <hi>Goſpels</hi>; but what do the <hi>Epiſtles</hi> treat of? St. <hi>Matthew, Mark, Luke</hi> and <hi>John</hi> do write of <hi>Jeſus</hi>; but what doth St. <hi>Paul</hi>

            <p>'Tis not enough to give <hi>credit</hi> to the Holy Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture in whatever it <hi>ſaith,</hi> but we muſt alſo yield an univerſal <hi>Obedience</hi> to every thing that it doth <hi>require.</hi> For, as every <hi>Aſſertion</hi> contained in Sacred Writ, as being the <hi>Word of Chriſt,</hi> deſerves our <hi>Belief,</hi> in reſpect of his <hi>Truth</hi> and <hi>Faithfulneſs:</hi> ſo every <hi>Precept</hi> delivered therein, as being <hi>the Word of the ſame Chriſt,</hi> expects our <hi>Obedience,</hi> in reſpect of his abſolute <hi>Sovereignty</hi> and <hi>Dominion.</hi> See this in two Particulars.</p>
            <p n="1">I. Since the whole Scripture is undoubtedly the <hi>Word</hi> of <hi>Chriſt,</hi> we muſt <hi>obey</hi> it in all its <hi>Poſitive</hi> Laws, by <hi>doing</hi> whatever it doth <hi>require.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>There are indeed many <hi>ſevere</hi> Commands which the Scriptures lay upon us: ſuch <hi>Injuncti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons</hi> hath the <hi>Law</hi> impoſed, and ſuch <hi>Duties</hi> doth the very <hi>Goſpel exact,</hi> as are quite <hi>contrary</hi> to the corrupt <hi>Inclinations</hi> of humane Nature, and conſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quently ſeem exceeding <hi>harſh</hi> to Fleſh and bloud. Such was that unexpected Command of God to <hi>Abraham,</hi>

               <hi>Take thy ſon, thine onely ſon Jſaac, whom thou loveſt, and offer him up for a burnt-offering.</hi> Such another was that to <hi>Moſes,</hi>

               <hi>Sell all that thou haſt, and diſtribute to the poor,</hi> &amp;c. Certainly theſe and many other like Commands, at the very firſt hearing, ſound exceeding <hi>harſh</hi> and ſo ſevere, that were they im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſed by any perſon of but <hi>ordinary</hi> Authority, man would rather <hi>hazard</hi> his <hi>diſpleaſure,</hi> then

               <hi>obey</hi> his <hi>will</hi> by doing that which, in his own appre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>henſion, doth ſo much tend to his Diſadvantage. Should a <hi>man,</hi> like our ſelves, require us, upon the <hi>firſt</hi> wanton Glance of our deareſt Eye, to pluck it out, rather then run the danger of <hi>ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cond</hi>; ſhould any <hi>man,</hi> like our ſelves, command us to <hi>loſe</hi> the <hi>greateſt Eſtate,</hi> rather then <hi>deny</hi> or <hi>diſſemble</hi> the <hi>ſmalleſt Truth</hi>; ſhould any <hi>worldly</hi> Power enjoyn us to lie in the flame our <hi>ſelves,</hi> ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther then caſt a little <hi>Incenſe</hi> into it; where dwells the man that would not diſobey?</p>
            <p>But although the <hi>matter</hi> of ſeveral Commands be ſo <hi>diſtaſtfull</hi> to fleſh and bloud, and ſeems ſo <hi>contrary</hi> to that which man is apt to count his great <hi>Intereſt</hi> in the world, that, with ſome little plauſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bility and pretences of carnal Reaſon, it is wont to diſcourage and retard our <hi>Obedience:</hi> yet the due conſideration of that <hi>Authority,</hi> Dominion, Wiſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome and Goodneſs which hath impoſed theſe Commands, even the <hi>ſevereſt</hi> of them, ſhould <hi>ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cite</hi> and quicken us to obey. We are ſtrictly charged to <hi>renounce</hi> the <hi>World,</hi> ſo far at leaſt as it ſtands in competition with its Maker: and if this ſeem a difficult task, let us remember <hi>who</hi> it is that hath enjoyned it.

There is not a man amongſt us but doth avouch and own <hi>Chriſt</hi> to be his <hi>Lord,</hi> and the <hi>Scripture</hi> to be his <hi>Rule:</hi> and if ſo, ſince all theſe Commands, how <hi>diſpleaſing</hi> ſoever to the nature of man, are <hi>impoſed</hi> by this <hi>Lord,</hi> and <hi>contained</hi> within this <hi>Holy Writ</hi>; 'tis certain that

we ſtand obliged, by all that <hi>Service</hi> and Homage we ow our <hi>Lord,</hi> and by all that <hi>reſpect</hi> we pretend to every <hi>Sacred Text,</hi> to obey even the moſt un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>welcom Precepts, by <hi>doing</hi> whatever is <hi>required</hi> in any <hi>page</hi> or <hi>line</hi> which contains <gap reason="foreign">

            <p n="1">I. The Champions of the <hi>Roman</hi> Faith do pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tend to prove their Traditions by ſeveral Texts of the <hi>Written Word</hi>; the chief whereof are theſe.</p>
            <p n="1">1. That Expreſſion of our Bleſſed <hi>Saviour</hi> to his Apoſtles recorded by the Evangeliſt is one, <hi>I have yet many things to ſay unto you,</hi>
               <note place="margin">Joh. 16.12.</note>

            </p>
            <p>
               <pb n="47" facs="tcp:94450:24"/>But it will be no injury to <hi>Bellarmine</hi>'s reputati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, if we do not count him <hi>infallible,</hi> ſince he was, and would be, no more then a <hi>Cardinall</hi>; having begged of God, as ſome ſay, that he might never be <hi>Pope,</hi> leſt perhaps he might probably be <hi>dam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned</hi> too; being, it ſeems, of the ſame mind with <hi>Marcellus</hi> the Second, who ſaid, <hi>Non video quo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>modo qui altum hunc locum tenet ſalvari poſſit,</hi> I do not ſee how the man that holds this high place can poſſibly be <hi>ſaved.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>But let us view his Argument. <hi>Chriſt</hi> ſaid, <hi>I have yet many things to ſay unto you, but ye cannot bear them now:</hi> What then? The <hi>Cardinall</hi> thus infers, 'Tis evident that our <hi>Lord ſpake</hi> many things which are not <hi>written.</hi> MethinKs this Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſequence is not neceſſary, nor can be proved, from this Text at leaſt, <hi>I have yet many things to ſay unto you, but ye cannot bear them now.</hi> All that can be gathered from this Text is onely this, That our Lord did not ſpeak at <hi>this time</hi> ſeveral matters which he had to ſay to his Apoſtles, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe they were not <hi>then</hi> fit to receive them. Yea, but the <hi>Cardinall</hi> farther adds, <hi>Illa quae pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mittebat Dominus ſe dicturum, dixit haud dubiè poſt Reſurrectionem ſuam,</hi> Thoſe things which our <hi>Lord promiſed</hi> that he himſelf <hi>would</hi> ſay, without all doubt he <hi>did</hi> ſay after his Reſurrection; and that St. <hi>Luke</hi> doth teſtifie thus,<note place="margin">Act. 1.3.</note>

            </p>
            <p>Whether theſe things which our Bleſſed <hi>Savi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>our</hi> delivered to his Apoſtles were <hi>afterwards
<pb n="48" facs="tcp:94450:25"/>
recorded</hi> by them or not, can neither be <hi>proved</hi> nor <hi>denied</hi> by any ſolid and certain Arguments, except it can firſt be infallibly known <hi>what</hi> his ſeveral Diſcourſes were St. <hi>Chryſoſtom</hi> tells us, <gap reason="foreign">

But mark another.<note place="margin">Act. 1.2.</note> The Text ſaith, <hi>He gave commandments to the Apoſtles.</hi> But <hi>what</hi> Commands might they be? were <hi>any</hi> of them <hi>written,</hi> or were they <hi>all</hi> afterwards delivered to the Church by <hi>Tradition?</hi> What the great one was, St. <hi>Chryſoſtom</hi> tells us, <gap reason="foreign">

            <p>But certain it is, thoſe Doctrines which the Apoſtles could not have well <hi>born</hi> before <hi>Chriſt</hi>'s <hi>Paſſion,</hi> and were therefore adjourned till after his <hi>Reſurrection,</hi> were, and muſt needs be, of an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>other nature: indeed, what they were in parti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cular, cannot certainly be known.<note place="margin">

From the warrant of this Text we do affirm, that <hi>Chriſt</hi> told not his Diſciples whatever he thought perti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nent to our Salvation; and that the Holy Ghoſt did not afterwards doe it neither, we have cauſe
<pb n="50" facs="tcp:94450:26"/>
to believe.

            </p>
            <p>'Tis ſtrange to think into what <hi>Abſurdities</hi> and Contradictions the <hi>Romaniſts</hi> do run themſelves, that they may juſtify thoſe <hi>Doctrines</hi> and <hi>Practices</hi> which they are loath to part with.

            </p>
            <p>But as to thoſe forenamed Diſcourſes, wherein our Bleſſed <hi>Saviour</hi> did privately inſtruct his <hi>A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſtles,</hi> and whereupon the <hi>Roman Church</hi> doth mightily ground their Doctrine of <hi>Tradition:</hi> though it cannot be <hi>certainly</hi> diſcovered what was the very <hi>Subject</hi> and particular <hi>Arguments</hi> of our Saviour's frequent Talk with his Diſciples at his ſeveral <hi>Apparitions</hi> to them after his Reſurrection; yet perhaps ſome <hi>probable</hi> gueſſes may be given; and accordingly ſeveral <hi>Conjectures</hi> are offered us by Interpreters.<note place="margin">

            <p>But beſides this Gueſſe of <hi>Origen</hi>'s and <hi>Chryſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtom</hi>'s, St. <hi>Auſtine</hi> gives us ſome ground for ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, when he tells us,<note place="margin">

            <p>That theſe Opinions of <hi>Origen, Chryſoſtom</hi> and <hi>Auſtine,</hi> concerning the <hi>matter</hi> of our Saviour's perſonall Diſcourſes with his Apoſtles betwixt his Reſurrection and Aſcenſion, which the <hi>Romaniſts</hi> urge for their <hi>Traditions,</hi> are but <hi>conjecturall,</hi> we do acknowledge: but withall, we do avouch that they are ten times <hi>more probable</hi> then that of <hi>Lorinus.</hi> For, that the <hi>many things</hi> which the Apoſtles <hi>could not yet bear,</hi> and therefore <hi>Chriſt</hi> did not deliver till after his Reſurrection, ſhould be ſuch as concerned the <hi>Abolition</hi> of the <hi>Moſai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>call Law,</hi> or the <hi>Diſciples</hi> own <hi>Sufferings,</hi> rather then the <hi>Authority</hi> of the <hi>Romane Biſhop,</hi> the <hi>In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vocation</hi> of <hi>Saints,</hi> and other <hi>ſuperſtitious</hi> Doctrines and Practices now taught and uſed in the <hi>Roman Church,</hi> as delivered by <hi>Chriſt</hi> in his forenamed private Diſcourſes with his Apoſtles, is much more conſonant to <hi>Chriſtian Religion,</hi> humane <hi>Rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon,</hi> and the <hi>Authority</hi> of the written <hi>Word.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>And if ſo, if we may take the Judgment of <hi>Origen, Chryſoſtom</hi> and <hi>Auſtine,</hi> whoſe Opinions in this matter are countenanced by Holy Writ,
<pb n="53" facs="tcp:94450:27"/>
rather then the Judgment of <hi>Lorinus,</hi> whoſe Opi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion in this caſe the Scriptures themſelves op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe; though there be in this buſineſs no <hi>Certainty</hi> on either ſide, yet if we have <hi>fairer Probabilities</hi> on our part then the <hi>Romaniſts</hi> have on theirs; if it be more likely, that the <hi>many things</hi> which <hi>Chriſt</hi> had to ſay before his Paſſion, but did not for pruden<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiall conſiderations <hi>actually</hi> declare till after his Reſurrection, might concern, as the forenamed Fathers probably thought, the <hi>Abrogation</hi> of the <hi>Jewiſh</hi> Religion, the <hi>Calling</hi> of the <hi>Gentiles,</hi> and the <hi>Martyrdom</hi> of his <hi>Apoſtles,</hi> rather then thoſe <hi>unwarrantable Traditions</hi> for which the <hi>Romaniſts</hi> do now contend; how then comes <hi>Bellarmine</hi> to aſſert that they are not written?</p>
            <p>But, upon the whole matter, the Truth is this: Since 'tis altogether impoſſible to find out what thoſe <hi>many things</hi> were which <hi>Chriſt</hi> had to teach his Diſciples before his Death, but did not doe it, becauſe <hi>as yet they could not bear them,</hi> till after his Reſurrection; 'tis equally impoſſible to prove that they <hi>are</hi> or <hi>are not</hi> regiſtred. But if the <hi>Ro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maniſts</hi> are of another mind, and will undertake by <hi>infallible Teſtimonies</hi> to demonſtrate to us what were the particular <hi>matters</hi> of our Saviour's ſeve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rall Diſcourſes at the time of his ſeverall Appari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions to his Apoſtles before his Aſcenſion, then will we alſo undertake to demonſtrate with equall evidence, <hi>when</hi> and by <hi>what Apoſtles</hi> whatever he ſo delivered ſtands recorded. And till the <hi>Roman Church</hi> ſhall make this out, certain we are, that thoſe words of our Bleſſed Saviour, <hi>I have yet many things to ſay,</hi> aſſiſted with thoſe of St. <hi>Luke, he ſpake of the kingdom of God,</hi> prove

not the thing for which our Adverſaries urge them, namely, That there were ſeverall <hi>neceſſary Doctrines</hi> delivered by <hi>Chriſt</hi> to his Apoſtles after his Reſurrection that are nowhere found in the <hi>written</hi> Word of God.</p>
            <p n="2">2.

            <p>There is another expreſſion of the Evangeliſt St. <hi>John</hi> that is often urged as a Text that will doe their buſineſſe indeed;<note place="margin">Joh. 20.30.</note> and thus it runs, <hi>Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny other ſigns truly did Jeſus in the preſence of his Diſciples, which are not written in this Book.</hi> No; 'tis obſerved of St. <hi>John</hi> by one of the Greek Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers, that he wrote <gap reason="foreign">

                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap>, other <hi>Doctrines,</hi> but <gap reason="foreign">

to thoſe Traditions about matters of <hi>Faith</hi> and <hi>Man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ners,</hi> which the <hi>Roman</hi> Church pretends to be as neceſſary to Salvation as thoſe great Doctrines of <hi>Chriſt</hi> and his Apoſtles which are clearly found in the written Word?</p>
            <p>I remember that St. <hi>Chryſoſtom</hi> and ſome other Interpreters do reſtrain this expreſſion of the E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vangeliſt to thoſe Miracles onely which <hi>Chriſt</hi> wrought after his Reſurrection, <hi>Many other ſigns truly did Jeſus.</hi> Here <hi>Theophylact</hi> puts the Queſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on thus, <gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap>; What Miracles were thoſe which the Evangeliſt here ſpeaks of? were they ſuch as our Saviour wrought publickly and before his Paſſion? He anſwers thus, <gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap>. So Saint <hi>Chryſoſtom</hi> conjectures too, <gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap>, It ſeems to me that the Evange<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liſt means thoſe Miracles which were done by our Saviour after his Reſurrection; and that, <gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap>, onely for the ſake of his Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſciples. And methinks this Conjecture of St. <hi>Chry<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſoſtom, Theophylact,</hi> and others, hath a very fair foundation in the Text it ſelf, which tells us, <hi>Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny other ſigns did Jeſus, which are not written in this Book,</hi>

And certainly, if theſe Miracles of <hi>Chriſt</hi> were wrought in private before his Diſciples, and for their ſakes onely, to be, as <hi>Theophylact</hi> ſtyles them, <gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap>, Evidences and Proofs of his Reſurrection, to remove their perſonall doubts,
<pb n="56" facs="tcp:94450:29"/>
to ſatisfie their Curioſity, and to eſtabliſh their Faith; 'tis not eaſy to imagine, that the omiſſion of ſome of theſe Miracles by all the Evangeliſts ſhould any way countenance the <hi>Traditions</hi> of the <hi>Roman</hi> Church, nor prejudice the <hi>Faith</hi> of the <hi>
                  <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>niverſall,</hi> which hath otherwiſe ſuch abundant Teſtimonies of <hi>Chriſt</hi>'s Reſurrection from the written Word, that it cannot need the Aſſiſtence and Supplement of Traditions for its Confirmati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on in that, or indeed in any other, Article of its Belief.</p>
            <p>And as for thoſe mighty Works of wonder which were publickly wrought by our Bleſſed Saviour, to prove his Commiſſion from God, and to confirm the Divinity of that new Religion which he was then to introduce into the world, that they were not all written, we do eaſily grant. There might be ſeveral Miracles done by <hi>Chriſt</hi> which St. <hi>John</hi> and the other Evangeliſts thought fit to paſſe by, <hi>ut minimè neceſſaria,</hi> ſaith <hi>Grotius,</hi> as things no way neceſſary to be recorded. For although our Bleſſed Saviour, being deſirous to doe good where-ever he came, and being willing to convince the whole <hi>Jewiſh</hi> Nation that he was indeed the <hi>true Meſſias,</hi> had frequent occaſions to work various Miracles, becauſe he went to ſeve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rall places, and converſed amongſt ſeverall com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>panies, where he met with divers objects of Mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy, and various perſons that were to be brought over to his new Religion: yet we do affirm, that any <hi>one</hi> Miracle of his, being rightly conſidered and duly weighed, had been enough to have ſatis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fied all its Spectatours, that the <hi>Perſon</hi> and <hi>Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrine</hi> of <hi>Chriſt</hi> were both approved and ſent by
<pb n="57" facs="tcp:94450:29"/>
God. And this bleſſed effect ſome one <hi>ſingle</hi> Miracle did ſometimes produce. When <hi>Chriſt</hi> had raiſed <hi>Lazarus</hi> from the dead, we are imme<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diately told upon that,<note place="margin">Joh. 11.45.</note> 
               <hi>Many of the Jews which came to Mary, and had ſeen the things which Jeſus did, believed on him.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>And if ſo, if <hi>one</hi> Miracle were ſufficient to ſecure that End for which <hi>all</hi> Miracles were wrought, 'tis ſure that we have enough recorded. What though the Apoſtles did not regiſter all the Miracles of <hi>Chriſt</hi> 
               <gap reason="foreign">

So thinks St. <hi>Chryſoſtom:</hi> and learned <hi>Grotius</hi> is of the ſame mind too, who tells us, <hi>Hîc ſignificat Praecepta quaedam pertinentia ad</hi>

            <p n="2">2. We ſhall enquire whether theſe <hi>Traditions,</hi> mentioned by St. <hi>Paul</hi> as delivered by <hi>word</hi> of <hi>mouth,</hi> might not afterwards be <hi>written.</hi>

            <p>But although our receiving the Euchariſt <hi>faſting</hi> were granted to be the <hi>Dictate</hi> of <hi>God</hi>'s Holy Spirit, ſignified to the Church either by the <hi>Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtles</hi> themſelves, or their immediate <hi>Succeſſours</hi> in that Age wherein the extraordinary Revelati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons of the <hi>Holy Ghoſt</hi> were as yet continued;

however, they give ſufficient evidence, that the <hi>Euchariſt</hi> of old was received by the Communi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nicants with their <hi>Hands,</hi> not their <hi>Mouths.</hi> The truth is, the <hi>Roman</hi> Church hath no more warrant from any <hi>Apoſtolicall</hi> Tradition for theſe and ſome other Ceremonies uſed therein about the <hi>Eucha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riſt,</hi> then they have for their <hi>half</hi>-Communion, whereby, againſt the <hi>Inſtitution</hi> of <hi>Chriſt,</hi> the <hi>Diſcourſe</hi> of St. <hi>Paul,</hi> and the <hi>Evidence</hi> of <hi>Primi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tive</hi> Practice, the Laiety are unworthily robbed of half the Sacrament, and are admitted onely to a <gap reason="foreign">

            <p>'Tis very evident, that theſe and many other <hi>

            <p n="2">II. The Champions of the <hi>Roman</hi> Church do endeavour to prove their Traditions to be Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtolicall by the Teſtimonies of their <hi>own Biſhops,</hi> as if they were Infallible.</p>
            <p>Thus, that the yearly <hi>Renovation</hi> of their <hi>Chriſm</hi> is an <hi>Apoſtolicall</hi> Tradition, doth <hi>Bellarmine</hi> offer to prove by the Authority of <hi>Pope Fabian,</hi> who, in his ſecond Epiſtle to the Biſhops of the <hi>Eaſtern</hi> Church, tells them thus, <hi>Iſta à Sanctis Apoſtolis &amp; eorum Succeſſoribus accepimus, Vobíſque tenenda
<pb n="79" facs="tcp:94450:40"/>
mandamus</hi>; 'Tis that which we have received from the <hi>Apoſtles</hi> and their <hi>Succeſſours,</hi> and ſo we require from you its Obſervation. To this he adds the Teſtimony of <hi>Innocent</hi> the Firſt, who, in his firſt Epiſtle to <hi>Decentius,</hi> ſaith, <hi>Si Inſtituta Eccleſiaſtica ut ſunt à beatis Apoſtolis tradita inte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gra vellent ſervare Domini ſacerdotes,</hi> &amp;c. If our <hi>Lord</hi>'s Prieſts would entirely obſerve the Inſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tutions of the Church as they were delivered by the bleſſed <hi>Apoſtles,</hi> &amp;c. Now to theſe and the like Teſtimonies of the <hi>Roman</hi> Biſhops, which are cited in the defence of ſuch and ſuch Traditi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, we have two things to anſwer.</p>
            <p n="1">1. The <hi>Roman Biſhops</hi> that have pleaded for the unwritten Traditions of that Church are not <hi>competent</hi> Witneſſes; nor doth their Teſtimony deſerve to be admitted in matters of this Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cern.</p>
            <p>'Tis notoriouſly known, that there are ſeverall Traditions maintained by the <hi>Roman</hi> Church that are very <hi>advantageous</hi> to their <hi>Biſhop,</hi> and others of their <hi>Clergy</hi> too, and that upon ſeverall ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>counts. That Doctrine which teacheth the Pope's <hi>Primacy</hi> and Supremacy over all other <hi>Biſhops</hi> and Secular <hi>Princes</hi> makes much for his <hi>Greatneſs,</hi> Splendour and Magnificence: that Doctrine which aſſerts his Power to diſpenſe with <hi>Vows, Oaths,</hi> and in ſeveral caſes with <hi>Matrimonial Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tracts,</hi> either to <hi>allow</hi> or <hi>null</hi> them; that Doctrine which aſſigns him a Power, more then ordinarily Miniſteriall, to <hi>pardon</hi> Sin, and deliver whom he will from <hi>Purgatory,</hi> &amp;c. makes for his <hi>Wealth,</hi> and fills his Bags apace.</p>
            <p>And if ſo, if theſe and other Doctrines do bring
<pb n="80" facs="tcp:94450:41"/>
in ſuch a Revenue to the <hi>Roman</hi> Biſhop, and ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny more of his Church too; 'tis very likely that they will be ſo kind to themſelves, as to plead for thoſe Traditions by which alone thoſe Doctrines can be maintained. That the Biſhops of <hi>Rome</hi> have the uſual Infirmities of other men, and may perhaps fail now and then in matters of <hi>Morall</hi> Concern, I think no man denieth. 'Tis a bug word that <hi>Baronius</hi> ſpeaks of Pope <hi>Vigilius,</hi>
               <note place="margin">
                  <hi>Baron.</hi> tom. 7.

            <p>Now then, if the <hi>Roman</hi> Biſhops, as well as other men, may poſſibly ſo far forget themſelves, as to be guilty of <hi>Ambition</hi> and <hi>Avarice</hi>; 'tis not reaſonable that we ſhould admit their Teſtimony for the Juſtification of thoſe Traditions wherein their own <hi>Advantage</hi> and <hi>Honour</hi> is ſo very much concerned: they are <hi>Parties</hi> ſo mightily intereſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed in this Cauſe, that there is ground enough to <hi>ſuſpect</hi> their <hi>Evidence,</hi> and to imagine, that they will repreſent the matter, not <hi>impartially,</hi> as it really ſtands; but with thoſe <hi>favourable Conſtru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctions,</hi> or <hi>falſe Gloſſes</hi> and Equivocations, which an <hi>ambitious</hi> or <hi>covetous heart</hi> may probably ſug<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>geſt, and a <hi>bad Cauſe</hi> doth certainly require. But,</p>
            <p n="2">2. Although the Teſtimony of the <hi>Roman</hi> Bi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhops ſhould be admitted for the juſtification of their own Traditions, ſhould we be ſo kind as to
<pb n="82" facs="tcp:94450:42"/>
accept their Evidence in a Cauſe which ſo deeply concerns themſelves, nay, ſhould we paſs a candid interpretation upon it, and ſuppoſe it to be im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>partial; yet neither ſo would it doe their work, nor prove firm, ſure, and cogent. See why, upon a double ground.</p>
            <p n="1">1. The Teſtimonies of ſeveral <hi>Roman</hi> Biſhops, eſpecially thoſe early ones, who would indeed have been very credible Witneſſes in any matter which concerns the Church, have been <hi>counterfei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted</hi> and notoriouſly <hi>forged.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Methinks we may uſe the ſame Conſideration to invalidate the Teſtimony of any <hi>Roman Biſhop,</hi> which <hi>Bellarmine</hi> himſelf doth to weaken and take off the Evidence of a <hi>Roman Cardinall.</hi> We find what horrid Crimes (if Simony, Hereſie, Sorcery and Adultery be ſuch indeed) are by ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veral Authors laid to the Charge of Pope <hi>Gregory</hi> the Seventh. And becauſe theſe deteſtable Vil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lanies do much reflect upon the <hi>Honour</hi> of the <hi>Roman</hi> See, and do intrench too much upon that Fundamental Point of the Pope's <hi>Infallibility</hi>; 'tis the great endeavour of <hi>Bellarmine,</hi> by all ways and means to wipe off this Guilt, and to make the world believe, that all theſe Vices, ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jected againſt (as he ſtyles him) an innocent Pope, were but unworthy <hi>Reproaches</hi> and baſe <hi>Calum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nies,</hi> that were raiſed by <hi>Tilmannus</hi> and the <hi>Centu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riatours</hi> out of a forged Book, that was fathered indeed upon Cardinal <hi>Benno,</hi> but was probably written (ſo <hi>Bellarmine</hi> would have it) by ſome <hi>Lutheran</hi> or other.</p>
            <p>This kind of Argumentation we may juſtly re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tort upon the <hi>Roman</hi> Church, who juſtifie their
<pb n="83" facs="tcp:94450:42"/>
own Traditions, and unjuſtly charge us with He<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reſie, as having departed from the true Faith of the Primitive and Catholick Church: and this they would fain prove by Teſtimonies produced out of ſome Writings, which are aſcribed to ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veral ancient Biſhops of <hi>Rome:</hi> whereas 'tis very certain that thoſe Writings neither were, nor could be, theirs.</p>
            <p>'Tis the great Honour of the <hi>Roman</hi> See, that, in the <hi>three</hi> firſt <hi>Centuries,</hi> the <hi>Biſhops</hi> who gover<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned that Church were very choice and excellent Perſons: we reade that Thirty and one ſucceſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſive Biſhops of theirs, even from <hi>Linus</hi> to <hi>Syl<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veſter,</hi> (if we except but <hi>Hyginus</hi> and <hi>Pius,</hi> who lived under the kinder Empire of <hi>Antoninus Pius</hi>) were <hi>Martyrs,</hi> or <hi>Confeſſours</hi> at leaſt. The me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mory of theſe Champions and ſtout Aſſertours of the true Catholick Faith being precious, and their Authority being venerable in the Church of <hi>Chriſt</hi>; ſome well-wiſhers to the preſent <hi>Roman</hi> Church, that there might be ſome pretence of great <hi>Antiquity</hi> for their ſuperſtitious <hi>Novelties,</hi> have written ſuch and ſuch <hi>Epiſtles, Conſtitutions,</hi> and other <hi>Tracts,</hi> in the names of theſe Primitive <hi>Roman</hi> Biſhops, which they have publiſhed and ſent abroad into the world with as much confi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence as if they were <hi>genuine</hi> and <hi>authentick</hi> in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed.</p>
            <p>What Authority ſuch Epiſtles have in the <hi>Ro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man</hi> Church, we learn from <hi>Gratian,</hi> who equals them to the Definitions of <hi>General Councils</hi>; and is not aſhamed to make St. <hi>Auſtine</hi> ſay, that they are equal to the very <hi>written Word</hi> of God. But St. <hi>Auſtine</hi> is ſo much wronged in being produced
<pb n="84" facs="tcp:94450:43"/>
by <hi>Gratian</hi> as the Authour of ſuch an intolerable Aſſertion, that <hi>Bellarmine,</hi> who for once hath ſomething more of Modeſty, doth thus excuſe it, <hi>Deceptus eſt Gratianus ex depravato Codice quem ipſe habuit beati Auguſtini, Gratian</hi> was deceived by a <hi>corrupted</hi> Copy which he had of St. <hi>Auſtine</hi>'s Works. But however, though <hi>Bellarmine</hi> dare not equal theſe <hi>Decretall Epiſtles</hi> to the very <hi>written Oracles</hi> of God; yet 'tis clear enough, that himſelf, <hi>Baronius,</hi> and others of the <hi>Roman</hi> Faith, do uſe the <hi>Authority</hi> of theſe <hi>forged Epi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtles</hi> to countenance ſeveral Doctrines and Practi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces wherein the Reformed Church and theirs differ.</p>
            <p>And yet for all this, there are ſeveral learned Writers of the <hi>Roman</hi> Church, who cannot but acknowledge that ſuch and ſuch <hi>Epiſtles, Conſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tution, Recognitions,</hi> fathered upon their <hi>Primi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tive</hi> and Martyred Biſhops, are ſhrewdly ſuſpec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted, yea and clearly proved too, to be <hi>falſe</hi> and <hi>counterfeit.</hi>

            <p n="2">2.

So that the whole Queſtion in hand being concerned about <hi>matters</hi> of <hi>Fact,</hi> wherein they themſelves acknowledge the <hi>Fallibility</hi> of the <hi>Pope,</hi> we have little Reaſon to acquieſce in his Determinations, and to be ſo well ſatisfied with his Teſtimony, as to think our ſelves obliged thereby to <hi>believe</hi> and <hi>doe</hi> thoſe things which the Scriptures do neither <hi>aſſert</hi> nor <hi>command.</hi>

            <p>And that ſeveral Biſhops of <hi>Rome</hi> have been, not onely ſhrewdly <hi>ſuſpected,</hi> but publickly <hi>accu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed</hi> and <hi>condemned</hi> too, and that of the fouleſt <hi>Hereſies,</hi> 'tis not to be denied by any man whoſe <hi>brow</hi> is not made of <hi>Braſs.</hi> 'Tis recorded by ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veral Authours, and thoſe of good name and cre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dit, that ſome <hi>Roman Biſhops</hi> have been <hi>Monothe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lites,</hi> ſome <hi>Montaniſts,</hi> ſome <hi>Eutychians,</hi> ſome <hi>Arrians,</hi> yea and ſome downright <hi>Atheiſts</hi> too.

            <p>And here, that Pope <hi>Marcellinus</hi> offered In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cenſe to Idols, might be proved with eaſe and evidence enough: but becauſe he did it barely for <hi>fear</hi> of <hi>Diocletian,</hi> and afterwards repented and became a <hi>Martyr,</hi> we <hi>paſs</hi> him by.<note place="margin">

            <p>So that whatſoever Traditions the Church of <hi>Rome</hi> can prove to be <hi>Apoſtolical</hi> by an unanimous Conſent of <hi>all</hi> the ancient, learned and holy <hi>Bi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhops</hi> and <hi>Doctours,</hi> who from Age to Age have governed and taught the Church, though ſuch Traditions are no-where recorded in the <hi>writ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten</hi> Word, yet being obliged by the <hi>univerſal</hi> Te<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtimony of all Antiquity to eſteem them Apoſto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lical Inſtitutions, and conſequently no-way re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pugnant to Holy Writ, we ſhall moſt readily re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive and practiſe them upon the very firſt Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viction. For ſo great a reſpect hath the <hi>Church</hi>

of <hi>England</hi> for all her pious <hi>Forefathers</hi> in <hi>Chriſt,</hi> that ſhe doth moſt chearfully follow their Example in every thing that is convenient and laudable; and doth pay to venerable <hi>Antiquity</hi> all that ima<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginable Reverence which is conſiſtent with that <hi>inviolable Rule</hi> ſhe walks by, which is the <hi>written Word</hi> of God. But,</p>
            <p n="2">2. Although we are thus ready to embrace all thoſe Doctrines and Practices which can be re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>commended to us by the <hi>general Conſent</hi> and Ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>probation of Antiquity; yet the Teſtimonies of ſuch and ſuch <hi>particular Fathers,</hi> which the <hi>Ro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maniſts</hi> produce for the juſtification of their un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>written Traditions, we cannot think our ſelves obliged to accept, nor is it ſafe to comply with them in <hi>all</hi> Points whatſoever.</p>
            <p>'Tis the great Prerogative of the <hi>Scripture</hi> alone to deſerve and require our Aſſent to every thing that is there delivered by every <hi>particular</hi> Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phet, Evangeliſt, and Apoſtle. When once we do but clearly underſtand the meaning of Divine Revelations, and comprehend what ſuch and ſuch a Text doth <hi>import,</hi> there is no room for any farther <hi>Scrutiny</hi> or Examination; but all our bu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſineſs is to <hi>believe</hi> and <hi>practiſe.</hi> Thus ſtands the caſe with the <hi>Word</hi> of <hi>God,</hi> every line whereof is of unqueſtionable Authority: but as for the <hi>Writings</hi> of <hi>men,</hi> how holy or learned ſoever, but not infallibly guided by God's unerring and holy Spirit, we have ground enough, in all Points and matters of <hi>Controverſie,</hi> which the Scriptures do not clearly determine, to <hi>pauſe</hi> a while, <hi>ſuſpend</hi> our <hi>faith,</hi> and not immediately to give too <hi>quick</hi> an Aſſent to ſuch and ſuch Aſſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions,
<pb n="95" facs="tcp:94450:48"/>
till we have taken mature Advice, and deli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>berately conſidered what is the <hi>matter</hi> of ſuch and ſuch Propoſitions that relate to the <hi>Worſhip</hi> of <hi>God, Points</hi> of <hi>Faith,</hi> or other <hi>Concerns</hi> of the <hi>Church,</hi> as well as <hi>who</hi> it is that recommends them. And for this we have ſeveral Reaſons.</p>
            <p n="1">1. That the whole Church of God in after-Ages ſhould, without all farther Examination, give an immediate Aſſent to all Propoſitions, Principles, Concluſions, Doctrines or Practices, which are laid down, recorded or recommended in the Works of ſuch and ſuch ancient Fathers, is a thing which thoſe <hi>Fathers</hi> themſelves did ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver <hi>doe</hi> or <hi>expect.</hi> The truth is, to give a firm and quick Credit to every thing which ſuch or ſuch a perſon hath ſaid, were an inſtance of ſuch a Reſpect as the <hi>beſt</hi> of <hi>men</hi> cannot <hi>deſerve,</hi> nor did the <hi>beſt</hi> of the <hi>Fathers</hi> ever <hi>require</hi> or <hi>ſhew.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>We are in this to imitate St. <hi>Auſtine,</hi>
               <note place="margin">
                  <hi>Aug.</hi> ad Hie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ron.

<pb n="96" facs="tcp:94450:49"/>
aliorum, tales volo eſſe Intellectores meorum</hi>; Such am I in other mens Works, and ſuch would I have other men be in mine. But how is that? he tells us;<note place="margin">

               <hi>Neminem velim ſic amplecti omnia mea, ut me ſequatur, niſi in iis quibus me non errare per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpexerit</hi>; I would have no man ſo to credit what I write, as immediately to comply with my Judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, except it be in thoſe things onely wherein he perceives me to be in the right.

                  <hi>Aug.</hi> ad Vin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>centium, Ep. 48.</note>

            <p>So then, though perhaps we may diſſent, in ſome particular matters not determined in the <hi>written</hi> Word, from ſuch and ſuch <hi>particular</hi> Fathers; though we have entred our Diſlike and do ſolemnly proteſt againſt ſome Expreſſions that have unwarily dropped from ſome of their Pens: yet ſince theſe good men have declared them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves to be no-way injured or affronted thereby; we do not need (or, if we did, we ſhould not matter) a <hi>Pardon</hi> from his <hi>Holineſs,</hi> who wants indeed ſome better Evidences to confirm the <hi>Va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lidity</hi> of his <hi>Indulgencies,</hi> and make them <hi>ſaleable</hi> in <hi>Engliſh</hi> Markets. But,</p>
            <p n="2">2. To comply with every thing that <hi>ſuch</hi> and <hi>ſuch</hi> a <hi>Father</hi> hath aſſerted, and to receive <hi>all</hi> their Teſtimonies indifferently as undoubted Truths, is a thing ſo <hi>groſs</hi> and irrational, that even our Adverſaries of <hi>Rome themſelves</hi> will not doe it.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="97" facs="tcp:94450:49"/>'Tis indeed very uſual with them to exclaim againſt us as perſons that have no Reverence for Antiquity, but reject the Fathers, and tread them under foot: but the truth is, if it be a fault to diſſent from ancient Writers in any thing what<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever, if our refuſal to ſubſcribe to their Opinions in all matters of Controverſie may be interpreted as a <hi>Contempt</hi> done to thoſe excellent Perſons, from whom in ſome things we diſagree; then do we retort this Argument upon our Adverſaries, and, having a juſt ground of <hi>Recrimination,</hi> we do tell and can eaſily prove to the world, that if this be indeed <hi>our Crime,</hi> it is certainly <hi>theirs</hi> too.</p>
            <p>That the Church of <hi>Rome</hi> doth give an <hi>univer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſal Aſſent</hi> to whatſoever <hi>all</hi> the Fathers have writ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten, will not be imagined by any perſon who con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiders what the <hi>Jeſuits</hi> and other <hi>Doctours,</hi> who well underſtood the Senſe of that Church, and durſt not openly contradict it, have left upon Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cord.

            <p>Indeed, whatſoever is delivered by <hi>Tertullian, Chryſoſtom, Ambroſe, Auſtine,</hi> or any other anci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ent Father, how <hi>agreeable</hi> ſoever it be to the writ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten <hi>Word</hi> of God, yet if it be <hi>inconſiſtent</hi> with the preſent <hi>Traditions</hi> and Practices of the <hi>Roman</hi> Church, they will not grant it to be a Truth. And if ſo, if the <hi>Romaniſts</hi> themſelves, when<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever their <hi>Intereſt</hi> doth ſo require, do make ſo bold with the Fathers, as to <hi>ſuſpect</hi> their <hi>Judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments,</hi> and <hi>deny</hi> their <hi>Authority</hi>; methinks they ſhould be ſo ingenuous, as to allow <hi>us</hi> the ſame liberty of Diſſent, which they take to <hi>themſelves.</hi> If <hi>they</hi> diſſent from <hi>Tertullian, Chryſoſtom, Am<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>broſe, Auſtine,</hi> and other Fathers, and that in thoſe very matters wherein thoſe Fathers have clearly, <hi>dogmatically</hi> and deſignedly delivered their Judgments; why may not <hi>we</hi> diſſent from <hi>Clemens Alexandrinus, Origen,</hi> and ſome others, eſpecially in thoſe things which they have onely <hi>rhetorically</hi> and <hi>accidentally</hi> mentioned, and yet are now violently drawn, forced and <hi>wreſted</hi> to countenance thoſe Articles of the <hi>Trent</hi> Faith whereof thoſe Fathers did never dream?</p>
            <p>But however, what juſt ground we have to diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent from ſuch and ſuch <hi>particular</hi> Fathers in ſuch and ſuch particular caſes, eſpecially in thoſe Points now in <hi>Controverſie</hi> betwixt the <hi>Reformed</hi> and <hi>Roman</hi> Church, we ſhall ſhew in two Parti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culars.</p>
            <p n="1">
               <pb n="99" facs="tcp:94450:50"/>1. The firſt Reaſon (and that which indeed our Adverſaries may juſtly plead as well as we) why we cannot think our ſelves obliged to com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ply with every <hi>particular Father,</hi> in every parti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cular thing which they have delivered, is, Becauſe they were but <hi>Men,</hi> and ſo <hi>might erre</hi>; and indeed often <hi>did,</hi> and ſome of them <hi>foully</hi> too.</p>
            <p>'Tis very uſuall with the Champions of the <hi>Roman</hi> Church, to produce the Teſtimonies of ſeverall perſons who are men of great Name and Authority in the Church of God, to juſtifie ſeve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rall of thoſe Traditions with which we can by no means comply.

ſuch, I ſuppoſe, as our <hi>Adverſaries</hi> themſelves will by no means allow.

               </gap>, there is no place, either in this world or in the next, void of the Goodneſs of God.</p>
            <p>And methinks, if this excellent and learned Perſon were betrayed into ſuch groſs and abſurd Opinions as are directly contrary to the written Word, through thoſe <hi>Traditions</hi> which had even thus early crept into the Church, and were fathe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red upon St. <hi>Paul,</hi> St. <hi>Peter,</hi> and other Apoſtles; we muſt beg, and may juſtly expect, our very Ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſaries pardon, if we ſtill ſuſpect that ſuch and ſuch Traditions, mentioned by this <hi>Clemens,</hi> are very far from being, as <hi>Bellarmine</hi> contends, <hi>Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtolicall.</hi>

and counterfeiting their <hi>Voices,</hi> and that to very ill Purpoſes too, then the men that we have now to deal with. 'Tis the great Shame of the <hi>Roman</hi> Church, and ſuch a Blemiſh as is not to be wiped off for ever, that they put unſavoury words into their <hi>Fathers</hi> mouths, and cite the <hi>Dead</hi> to bear Teſtimony to thoſe <hi>Follies</hi> and Falſhoods which, when <hi>alive,</hi> they would have abhorred with juſt Indignation and Zeal.</p>
            <p>'Tis well obſerved and unanſwerably proved by an eminent Divine of our own Church, that the <hi>Romaniſts</hi> have uſed ſeveral Tricks to <hi>corrupt</hi> the Fathers, and make them ſpeak even as they themſelves would have them.

            <p>No; the certain truth is, this Canon was un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>worthily <hi>corrupted</hi> in favour of the <hi>Roman</hi> Biſhop: and although our Adverſaries cannot for ſhame ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>knowledge their own corrupting of Councils; yet they cannot deny but that it hath been familiarly done by other perſons.

For if the Authority of ſuch or ſuch a Council be urged againſt the <hi>Roman</hi> Church, and cannot otherwiſe be well eſcaped, they have no other Shift to ſave themſelves, but onely to pretend that ſuch and ſuch a <hi>Canon,</hi> which they cannot anſwer, is <hi>falſe</hi> and counterfeit. 'Tis a certain Truth, that their Pope <hi>Honorius</hi> was condemned for a downright <hi>Heretick</hi> by the <hi>ſixth</hi> General Council, which conſiſted of an hundred and ſeventy Fathers aſſembled at <hi>Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtantinople</hi>; ſo 'tis recorded:<note place="margin">Auctor In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>certus de Synodis.</note>

               </gap>, they brought them under a <hi>righte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous</hi> Condemnation.</p>
            <p>But will the <hi>Roman</hi> Church contentedly ſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fer any <hi>Biſhop</hi> of <hi>theirs</hi> to be condemned, bran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded and recorded for an arrant <hi>Heretick,</hi> and plead nothing in his behalf? What would then become of their dear <hi>Infallibility?</hi> what would then become of Pope <hi>Agatho</hi>'s Letter to the ſixth General <hi>Council,</hi> wherein he bragged, that the <hi>Biſhops</hi> of <hi>Rome</hi> never erred in Points of <hi>Faith?</hi> Or will the <hi>Roman</hi> Church acknowledg that a <hi>General Council</hi> may be miſtaken, and that in a matter of ſo great Concern to themſelves as they take the <hi>Infallibility</hi> of their Biſhops to be? 'Tis a ſhrewd <hi>Dilemma</hi> that our Adverſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries lie under in this caſe. For, if <hi>Honorius</hi> were certainly an <hi>Heretick,</hi> their <hi>Infallibility</hi> ceaſeth: but if <hi>Honorius</hi> were <hi>no</hi> Heretick, then may <hi>General Councils</hi> erre, which the <hi>Ro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man</hi> Church is loath to grant. Well; to ſecure the <hi>Credit</hi> of <hi>Honorius,</hi> and the <hi>Authority</hi> of that General <hi>Council</hi> which condemned him too, <hi>Bel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>larmine</hi> invents this trick,<note place="margin">

With<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out doubt the name of <hi>Honorius</hi> was inſerted a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mong thoſe <hi>Hereticks</hi> whom the ſixth <hi>Council</hi> con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demned
<pb n="131" facs="tcp:94450:66"/>
by ſome perſons that bore no good will to the <hi>Roman</hi> Church. Thus would the <hi>Cardi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal</hi> make the world believe, that what <hi>Canon</hi> ſoever ſpake any thing againſt a <hi>Biſhop</hi> of <hi>his Church,</hi> muſt certainly be <hi>corrupted</hi> and forged by the <hi>Grecians</hi>; who, as he intimates, had no great Kindneſs for the <hi>Roman</hi> See.</p>
            <p>And methinks, if <hi>Bellarmine</hi> be real in what he ſaith; if he did verily ſuſpect that ſuch and ſuch Councils were indeed corrupted and forged by the <hi>Grecians,</hi> as being diſaffected to the <hi>Ro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man</hi> Church; we have greater cauſe to be jea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lous, that ſuch and ſuch Councils have been mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerably <hi>corrupted</hi> and forged by the <hi>Latines,</hi> who are ſworn enemies to <hi>every Church</hi> which differs from their own. For, ſince 'tis evident that they have made ſo bold with that famous Council of <hi>Nice,</hi> as to falſifie a <hi>Canon</hi> of <hi>theirs</hi>; we cannot think that they have ſo great a Veneration for any <hi>other</hi> Council beſides, but that they will corrupt and forge them, even as oft as their In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tereſt doth ſo require.</p>
            <p>And ſince 'tis thus; ſince, by the Confeſſion of our Adverſaries themſelves, ſuch and ſuch <hi>particular Fathers</hi> have ſtrangely erred; ſince the moſt Learned men of the <hi>Roman</hi> Church have acknowledged that even <hi>Popes</hi> and <hi>Councils</hi> have been, if not <hi>miſtaken</hi> in themſelves, yet baſely <hi>corrupted</hi> by others: we cannot think our ſelves obliged to accept the Authority and Teſtimonies of ſuch <hi>Fathers, Popes</hi> and <hi>Councils,</hi> as ſure and infallible Proofs of thoſe Traditions which are now received in and recommended by the <hi>Roman</hi> Church, though neither atteſted
