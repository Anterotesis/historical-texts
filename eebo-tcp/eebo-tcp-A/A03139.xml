         <editorialDecl>
            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

of those fine stories and inventions, which we are like to finde
within. One that conjectured of the house by the trimme or

slight of substance; counterfeit stuffe most of it, and wrought
with so much fraud, and falshood, that there is hardly one
true stitch in all the Worke: From the beginning to the end,
our <hi>Minister</hi> is still the same, no Changeling:

            </p>
            <p>And yet if all these <hi>piae fraudes,</hi> (for so they must be thought
in so grave a <hi>Minister</hi>) did aime at nothing else, than to ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vance
the reputation of his <hi>holy Table;</hi> the answering of his
worke were more proper for another Adversary. The <hi>holy

he is faine to flie to <hi>Rome,</hi> to finde out some that are <hi>asha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med

pretence of setting up his <hi>holy Table,</hi> this Minister hath disper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed
throughout his booke, such principles of <hi>faction, schisme,</hi>
and <hi>disobedience,</hi> that even that <hi>Table</hi> also is <hi>made a snare</hi> to
those, who, either out of weaknesse, or too great a stomacke,
doe greedily devoure what ever is there set before them. So
venomous a discourse requires an <hi>Antidote,</hi> a timely and a pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sent

is, is not yet discovered; all that is openly revealed, is that
hee was a <hi>Minister in Lincoln-shire,</hi> as in the Title; <hi>some Mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ster

than at this time under the most auspitious Raigne of our
Gracious Soveraigne. And therefore they that practise with
all art and cunning to cast such scandals on the State, and such
foule slanders on the Church, are utterly unworthy of those in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>finite
blessings, which by the <hi>sword of God and Gideon,</hi> the fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vour
of the Lord, and our religious Soveraigne, they enjoy in
both: So that the supposition of a booke <hi>written long agoe, in

            <p>This factious figment thus rejected, all that is left us to find

argument, both in the maine, and on the by, shewes that hee is
a true descendant of those old <hi>Ministers</hi> of <hi>Lincoln shire,</hi> which

Church of England;</hi> you might perchance be apt to give cre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dit
to him, and lend too credulous an eare to his slie temptati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons.
Therefore to save that title which the Church hath in you,
and to preserve that interest which it claimes in your best affe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctions,
I have adventured to put in this <hi>Caveat,</hi> in the Chur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ches
name; which if you should neglect, as I hope you will
not, I must bee forced in maintenance of her right and interest,
to bring my <hi>double quarrell.</hi> Bookes of a popular argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment,
and followed in a popular way, are commonly much
cherished by that race of men, who love to runne crosse to all
publick-order. And therefore it concernes all Churchmen,
and you especially of that <hi>Diocese,</hi> for which that worthy
Woke was printed, to have a wise and timely care, that those
which are committed to your severall charges, be rightly bal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lanced,
and not inv<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>igled and abused by the neate subtleties of
those, who onely labour to deceive them.</p>
            <p>
               <pb facs="tcp:4200:8"/>
And it concernes us all, the rather, because those factious
and schismaticall Pamphlets, that came out with, and since the
good <hi>Ministers</hi> Booke, seeme to indeavour nothing more,
than to possesse mens mindes, as before I said, with dangerous
and desperate, though most needlesse feares, that all things goe
not right amongst us. The placing of the <hi>holy Table</hi> in that
comly sort, as is most co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>sonant to the practise of the <hi>Primitive</hi>
times, and to the generall usage of all <hi>Cathedrals</hi> in this King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom,
and his Majesties <hi>Chappels,</hi> given out by false and factious
men; onely to bee a preamble to a greater change: And how<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>soever
in it selfe it bee a matter of <hi>indifferent nature,</hi> and so
acknowledged to bee both by the <hi>Minister</hi> himselfe, good
man, and by the writer of the letter to the <hi>Vicar</hi> of <hi>Grantham;</hi>
and that the <hi>Table</hi> be so placed in his Lordships Chappell, (by
whom the Ministers booke was allowed and licenced) as is
<note n="f" place="margin">Vide Sect. 2. ch. 4. in fine.</note> elsewhere said; this comes all to one: for place them<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> how
they will in Cathedrall Churches, his Majesties and the Bi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>shops
Chappels, and be the matter so indifferent, as no one
thing more; yet take we heed we doe not place them <hi>Altar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wise</hi>
in <hi>Parochiall</hi> Churches; rather than so, poore people must
bee frighted with wee know not what, and told that there is
somewhat in it which is worth their feares; something that
mainly tends unto the alteration of religion here by law esta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>blished.
As if the Table could not stand where the <hi>Altar</hi> did,
or be placed <hi>Altar-wise</hi> all along the wall; but it must needs
implie some <hi>Popish</hi> and prohibited sacrifice, to be intended for
the same, though not yet ready to be offered. In which most
false and scandalous imputations, as all the Pamphlets of these
times are extremely guilty; so there is none more positive in
it, than this <hi>Minister of Lincoln Diocesse.</hi> 
               <q>These <hi>new Refor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mers</hi>
(I desire you to observe his words) though they pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pare
and lay grounds for the same, dare not (for feare of so
many lawes and Canons) apparently professe this <hi>Eleusinian</hi>
doctrine. They are as yet busied in taking in the out-works,
and that being done, they may in time have a bout with
the Fort it selfe.</q> A speech of that schismaticall, facti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous,
and seditious nature, that greater of that kinde was ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver
<pb facs="tcp:4200:8"/>
uttered by <hi>Bastwicke, Layton, Burton, Prynne,</hi> or any pesti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lent
Pasquill of the present, <hi>ne dum</hi> in any of the former times.
And though you may conjecture <hi>ex pede Herculem,</hi> what you
are like to finde by this, in the whole bulke of the discourse:
yet for your better satisfaction, I will lay before you, as by way
of Parallel, the harmony or agreement which is betweene him
in his <hi>holy Table,</hi> and <hi>H. Burton</hi> in his late seditious <hi>Sermon,</hi>
and <hi>Apologie.</hi> Not in the language onely, which is in both so
like, and so full of clamour, as if they had but one pen between
them; but in their factious and schismaticall positions, in which
they doe agree so sweetly. Which done, it shall be left to you
to consider of it, whether it may be possible that they should
jump so even, in so many passages, by meere inspiration, and
the enthusiasme of the same ill spirit, or that they rather fell
upon it, (as <hi>Iuglers</hi> sometimes doe their tricks) by combina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
and confederacy.</p>

Thinke, you not that they hold intelligence with one another,

both what they meane to write of, and how to follow it?
Certainly this must needes bee done by mutuall correspon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence

without speciall influence of the same ill spirit. Yet I must tell
you by the way, that of the two, the <hi>Minister of Lincoln</hi> is the
most adventurous: who befides all that here is said, hath a long
studied discourse in maintenance of sitting at the holy Sacra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment,
which good Master <hi>Burton</hi> never winched at. But now
upon the stating of the question by this man of <hi>Lincolnshire,</hi>
some of the latter libells (of which wee have had many since
the <hi>Ministers</hi> booke) have brought in that too; and made it
one of the disparities or <hi>Antitheses,</hi> betweene our Saviour and
the Prelates. And yet the brethren may doe well, not to give
too much credence to him. For howsoever hee hath strained
so much to gaine their favour; and set them out with a <hi>long Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>talogue
of graces, as vigilant, sober, blamelesse, modest, learned,
hospitall,</hi> and <hi>I know not what.</hi> pag. 191. Yet at another time,
he flings them off, as if they had no reference to him. For if

did first occasion me to write that answer to it, which passeth

also, from the most insolent, though weake assaults of this un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>certaine
certaine <hi>Minister</hi> of the Diocesse of <hi>Lincoln;</hi> who
comes into the field with no other weapons, than <hi>insolence, ig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>norance</hi>
and <hi>falsehood.</hi> In my defence whereof, and all my refe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rences
thereunto, I am to give you notice here, that whereas
there were two Editions of it, one presently upon the other;
I relate onely in this <hi>Antidote</hi> to the first Edition: because the
<hi>Minister</hi> takes no notice but of that alone.</p>
            <p>The method which I use in this <hi>Antidotum,</hi> shall be shewn
you next, that you may know the better what you are to look
for. The whole discourse I have divided into three Sections.
Into the first wherof I have reduced the point in controversie,
as it relates to us of the Church of <hi>England:</hi> following the <hi>Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nister</hi>
at the heeles in his three first Chapters, touching the
<hi>state</hi> of the question, the <hi>Regall</hi> and <hi>Episcopall</hi> power in matter
of Ceremony; and in the fourth bringing unto the test, all that
he hath related in severall places of his booke, touching the ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king
downe of <hi>Altars,</hi> and alteration of the <hi>Liturgie</hi> in King
<hi>Edwards</hi> time. The second Section comprehends the tendries
of the <hi>Primitive</hi> Church, concerning <hi>Sacrifices, Priests,</hi> and
<hi>Altars;</hi> together with their generall usage in placing of the <hi>Al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tar</hi>
or <hi>holy Table:</hi> and that containes foure Chapters also. In
which we have not only assured our cause, both by the judge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
and the usage of the purest Ages: but answered all those
Arguments (or Cavils rather) which by the <hi>Minister</hi> have been
studied to oppose the same. The third and last exhibites to
<pb facs="tcp:4200:12"/>
you those <hi>Extravagancies,</hi> and <hi>Vagaries</hi> which every where
appeare in the <hi>Ministers</hi> booke; and are not any way reducible
to the point in hand: wherein wee have good store of confi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent
ignorance, fal<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="2 letters">

               </gap>fications farre more grosse, because more
unnecessary; and not a little of the old <hi>Lincolnshire Abridge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment.</hi>
And in this wise I have di<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>posed it for your ease, who

                  <p>First, for your stating of the question, you have an
excellent advantage, (could you hold it fast) in ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king,
as you doe, your owne case, your own evidence,
and your owne authorities. The principals in this bu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sinesse,
were the Vicar of <hi>Grantham,</hi> the <hi>Alderman</hi>
thereof, and my Lord <hi>Bishop</hi> of the Diocesse; the on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
<hi>Accessary</hi> thereunto, the Bishops <hi>Secretary.</hi> Of all
these there is none that either can, or will confute you
in any thing you say, say you what you will. The <hi>Vicar</hi>
                     <pb n="10" facs="tcp:4200:22"/>
hee is dead, and you may use him as you please; for
<hi>mortui non mordent,</hi> as the saying is: But yet take heed,
(and say a friend advised you to it) what you lay upon
him. For though he cannot answer to your slanders
now, hee may bring you to answer for them another
day. The <hi>Alderman</hi> being set forth unto us for<note n="a" place="margin">pag. 12.</note> 
                     <hi>a
discreete and modest man,</hi> as the letter tells us;<note n="b" place="margin">pag. 7.</note> 
                     <hi>A
prudent and discreet man,</hi> as your booke informes us;
did never shew his wisdome and discretion more, than
that he was<note n="c" place="margin">pag. 7.</note> 
                     <hi>affraid to offend the Bishop.</hi> And being,
if he be alive, as <hi>prudent and discreet</hi> as ever, must needs
be now as much <hi>affraid to offend the Bishop,</hi> as before
he was; and therefore you may say your pleasure, and
call the <hi>Alderman,</hi> and the <hi>Aldermans letter</hi> to witnesse
what you please to say; you are sure of that. As for
the <hi>Bishop,</hi> from whose mouth you must have the sto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rie,
hee hath good reason to confirme and justifie his
owne relation; that it may set him off the better, and
give the world a full accompt of his most moderate
proceedings in a point so agitated. Then for the <hi>Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cretary,</hi>
being wee finde not in the storie, that he was
any more imployed, than<note n="d" place="margin">pag. 9, 10.</note> 
                     <hi>sitting up</hi> with his Lord
that <hi>night,</hi> fetching <hi>the booke of Martyrs out of</hi> the <hi>hall,</hi>
and <hi>borrowing Bishop Iewels workes from the Parish

he was but <gap reason="foreign">

                     </gap>, a living instrument; and if ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>amined,
can say nothing that will doe you hurt. So
that in case, the Bishop can but keepe your counsell,
as no doubt hee will; and M<hi rend="sup">r</hi> 
                     <hi>Alderman</hi> hath not lost
his ancient <hi>prudence and discretion,</hi> which God for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bid,
you may stand forth, and tell your tale, and tell
it with as high a confidence, as if wee were obliged
to take all for Gospell. This you conceive at least,

to light, but by confession of the parties. Now in
your storie of the businesse,<note place="margin">pag. 3.</note> you tell us that the Vicars
head was full of <hi>

                     <hi>turning out of the

preachers,</hi> as you set them forth. For being <hi>salaried</hi> by
the Parish (to which the Bishop was so <hi>good a friend)</hi>
you cannot but extoll them, whatsoever they were; or
what just cause soever the poore Vicar had to rid the
towne of them. Then for the second Crochet, that
was, you say, the <hi>removing</hi> of <hi>the Communion table from
the upper part of the quire, where it was comely placed be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore,
(and had stood time out of minde) unto the Altar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>place,
as he called it;</hi> and telling M<hi rend="sup">r</hi>. <hi>Alderman</hi> (who
out of his <hi>discretion,</hi> must needs <hi>question the Vicar</hi> for
it) <hi>that he had done it, and would justifie it.</hi> What proofe
have wee for this, (for of the other you bring none) I
meane, that the Communion table stood in the upper
part of the Quire, in such a comely fashion, for so long
continuance; and that it was removed by the <hi>Vicar</hi>
onely, without consulting with the <hi>Chancellour,</hi> or
perhaps the <hi>Ordinary?</hi> For proofe of this we are re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferred
to M<hi rend="sup">r</hi> 
                     <hi>Aldermans letter.</hi> Then that the Vicar
called the Communion table by the name of <hi>Tresle,</hi>
saying that <hi>he would build an Altar of stone at his owne
charge;</hi> and that the rude people made reply, that <hi>hee
should set up no dressers of stone in their Church:</hi> What
proofe have we of that? M<hi rend="sup">r</hi> 
                     <hi>Aldermans letter.</hi> Next
<note n="f" place="margin">pag. 7.</note> that he used <hi>light gestures in bowing at the name of</hi>
Jesus, <hi>so as sometimes his booke fell down, and once him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selfe,

<pb n="12" facs="tcp:4200:23"/>
to that religious Ceremony:</hi> What evidence to make
that good? M<hi rend="sup">r</hi> 
                     <hi>Aldermans letter.</hi> These are the most
materiall things in the whole relation, so farre as it
concerned the ground of the whole proceeding; and
for the proofe of all we must take your word, aswell
as M<hi rend="sup">r</hi> 
                     <hi>Aldermans</hi> letter. For what if M<hi rend="sup">r</hi>

writno such letter, or if he writ it on the <hi>Post-fact</hi> on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly,
to make good your tale; or if you make more of it
than he mentioned in it: as who can tell but you may
deale with M<hi rend="sup">r</hi> 
                     <hi>Aldermans</hi> letters, as you have done
throughout your booke with the <hi>Aldermans</hi> better?
Or what if M<hi rend="sup">r</hi> 
                     <hi>Aldermans</hi> letter say as much as you
would have him, why would you have us credit M<hi rend="sup">r</hi>.
<hi>Aldermans</hi> letter, to the discredit of the <hi>Vicar;</hi> espe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cially
as things stood betweene them? the <hi>Alderman</hi>
being most apparently not a party only, but <hi>dux parti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>um,</hi>
the leader of a party against his Minister. For you
your selfe have told us, that<note n="g" place="margin">pag. 6.</note> M<hi rend="sup">r</hi> 
                     <hi>Alderman</hi> (being
nor<note n="g" place="margin">pag. 6.</note> 
                     <hi>Bishop, Chancellour,</hi> nor <hi>Surrogate,</hi> as I conceive
him) <hi>commanded</hi> his owne <hi>officers,</hi> (Sergeants, and
Beadles, and such fellowes) <hi>to remove the Table to the
place</hi> where it stood before. Which being done ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cordingly,
he cries out first; and makes<note n="h" place="margin">Whereupon the Alderman presently wrote unto his Lordsh. <hi>pag.</hi> 7.</note> complaint

thought it an high point of wisdome, being so <hi>prudent

worke there; and then a <hi>fico</hi> for the Vicar. So that the

not to be admitted for a witnesse also, except it be by

                     </gap>e the letter his, or not, you think that you have
gained three points. First, a good ground to change
the tenour of your owne, charging the Vicar in your
printed Copy, with an intent of setting up an <hi>Altar of
stone,</hi> which was not<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> to be found in all the <hi>Manu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>script:</hi>
Besides, that you have brought him into some

                     <hi>friend, the Bishop,</hi> for daring to
remove the <hi>Communion table,</hi> without leave from him.
Next, for that slovenly and disgracefull phrase of
<hi>Dresser,</hi> given in the Bishops written letter to the
Communion table placed <hi>Altar-wise,</hi> and from him
borrowed by M<hi rend="sup">r</hi> 
                     <hi>Prynne,</hi> that is now found out to be
a phrase of the <hi>rude peoples,</hi> as you call them; and on
them fathered in the printed letter, to take off that
scandall. Last of all, whereas bowing at the name of
JESUS was in the written letter glanced at, as if it
did procure derision from the lookers on: that is now
turned wholly on the Vicar, and his <hi>light gestures</hi> in
performance of that pious ceremony: the printed let<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
being altered and explained in that particular ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cordingly.
Having got thus much by the hand, you
need say no more, but beare your head up bravely,
and proclaime your victory. But as he in <hi>Macrobius</hi>

to the <hi>Altar place;</hi> and stood so, till the Alderman,
<note n="o" place="margin">pag. 12</note> 
                     <hi>a discreet and modest man, and far from any humour of
Innovation,</hi> did by farre lesse authority bring it down
againe, and was never checked for it. Nor can you
say, that the word <hi>last</hi> there mentioned, <hi>(when I spake
with you last)</hi> is to relate unto that time, when the Vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>car
and the Alderman encountred at his Lordships
house: Because it follows in the next words, <hi>that which
I did not then suspect, is come to passe;</hi> viz. <hi>the Alder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man
and better sort of the towne have complained against
it.</hi> The conference then meant, wherein his Lord<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ship
shewed himselfe so indifferent in the businesse
proposed unto him, must needs precede the Vicars
action; as did the Vicars action the Aldermans riot;
the Aldermans riot, the complaint; and the complaint,
that sudden and tumultuary journey to his Lordships
house, which drew out the learned letter now be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tweene
us. And so your first report of the <hi>half-Vicars</hi>
hasty running, before hee was sent, is, for the truth
thereof disproved, or made very disputable. The o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
branch thereof, touching the <hi>stone Altar</hi> that you
talke of, is farre more improbable, and you are faine
<pb n="15" facs="tcp:4200:24"/>
to chop &amp; change the Bishops letter to make it good,<note place="margin">Cap. 2.</note>
and yet cannot doe it. For whereas it was charged
upon the Vicar in the M. S. Copies, that he should <hi>be
so violent and earnest for an Altar at the upper end of the
Quire:</hi> you have it in the printed letter, that he <hi>should
say he would upon his omne cost build</hi> an Altar of stone <hi>at
the upper end of his Quire:</hi> which is too great a diffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rence
to be an errour in the transcripts. Secondly, in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stead
of <hi>that oblation which the Papists were wont to offer
upon their Altars,</hi> you now have made it <hi>that oblation
which the Papists were wont to offer upon these Altars:</hi>
and so by changing <hi>these</hi> to <hi>theirs,</hi> have turned a <hi>Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>testant

whereas the first section in the written copies, conclu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded
thus, <hi>therefore I know you will not change a table in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to
an Altar:</hi> you have converted it to this, <hi>therefore. I
know you will not build any such Altar;</hi> As great an al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teration
in the businesse, as the words themselves. For
had that beene the businesse then in agitation; and not
the placing of the Table <hi>Altar-wise,</hi> his Lordship
might have gone to bed that night, (as indeed he did)
&amp; ended all his letter with the first section; being bu<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

a tale of a Tubb? Had the <hi>rude people,</hi> as you call
them, applyed the name of <hi>dresser</hi> unto the <hi>holy table</hi>
placed along the wall, the speech had beene more
proper, though not lesse prophane. But now to put
the name of <hi>dresser of stone</hi> into the mouthes of Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>try
people, who never heard of any such thing as a
<hi>dresser of stone:</hi> shewes plainly, that neither any <hi>Altar

occasion such an idle and absurd expression; nor that
the writer of the letter tooke up the name of <hi>dresser</hi>

is from God, that the Kings<note n="c" place="margin">pag. 32.</note> of <hi>England</hi> have <hi>had
the flowers of Ecclesiasticall jurisdiction, stuck in their
Imperiall garlands, by the finger of Almighty God from
the very beginning of this Christian Monarchy within
this Island;</hi> and that <hi>the Kings Majesty may command a
greater matter of this nature, than that the holy Table
should be placed where the Altar stood.</hi> An excellent
<hi>Royalist</hi> verily in your <hi>speculations.</hi> But look upon you
in your <hi>practicks,</hi> and then you tell us in your corre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cted
copy of the Bishops letter, that <hi>the Table (without
some new Canon) is not to stand Altar-wise;</hi> which is di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rectly
contrary to that before. I trow you are not ig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>norant
that the Church makes <hi>Canons,</hi> it is the <hi>work of
Clergy men in their Convocations,</hi> having his Majesties
leave for their conveening, and approbation of their
doings. His Majesty in the <hi>Declaration before the Arti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cles</hi>

his raigne, what time the booke of <hi>Canons</hi> was com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>posed
in the <hi>Convocation,</hi> hath declared so too. If then
the Table may not be removed &amp; placed <hi>Altar-wise,
without some new Canon;</hi> his Majesty may command
it, for ought I see by you, and yet goe without. Or if
<pb n="30" facs="tcp:4200:32"/>
you mean that any order from his Majestie, or inti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mation
of his pleasure, shall be as forcible with you,
as any Canon of them all; why doe you so much
slight his Majesties Declaration about S. <hi>Gregories?</hi>
For neither can the man indure it should be called an
<hi>Act of Counsell,</hi> (which yet the Doctor never calls
it, to his best remembrance;) or that it should have
any influence beyond that one particular case, which
first occasioned it: in no respect that it should have the
operation of <hi>Canon,</hi> either to force obedience, or in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duce
conformity. So that in fine, you deale no other<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wise

when he heares the businesse. The question was, whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
the King lost any thing of that power which was

Ploydon,</hi> (for so the last edition calls him) that
if a man give lands to the King by deed inrolled, a
<hi>fee-simple doth passe,</hi> without these words <hi>successors
and heyres,</hi> because in Judgement of Law the King
never dyeth.</q> This is an argument <hi>à comparatis<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
                     </hi> And
what see you therein with your Eagles eyes, (the
Doctor being but a <hi>blinker,</hi>
                     <note n="o" place="margin">pag. 190.</note> as you please to style
him) that you should fall upon him with such scorne

The Argument was good to the point in hand,
which was not what the King could doe by his power
<hi>Originall,</hi> that which he claimes onely from the King
of Kings, which was never questioned: but how far
hee might use that Statute, if occasion were, for the

ordaining of such rites and ceremonies, as he with the
<hi>advice of his Metropolitan,</hi> should think fit to publish.
You may call in your laugh again, for ought I see yet:

                     <hi>next pranke,</hi> you say, is worse, where hee
affirmes, (<hi>most ignorantly, and most derogatorily to his
Majesties right and just prerogative) that the Statute
1. of Eliz. 2. was a confirmative of the old law:</hi> whereas
his Author hath it rightly, <hi>that it was not a Statute in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>troductorie
of a new law, but declaratorie of the old.</hi> This
is the hint you take to introduce your studied dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>course
of the power of Kings <hi>in ecclesiasticis,</hi> which
neither is <hi>ad rem,</hi> nor <hi>Rhombum:</hi> but that you would
doe somewhat faine to be thought a Royalist; how<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever
the poor people take it to be so deserted. For tell
mee in good earnest, doth the Doctor say that the said
Statute 1. of <hi>Eliz.</hi> was onely <hi>confirmative,</hi> and not <hi>de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>claratorie
of the old?</hi> Doth he not say expressely as you
would have him? <q>Last of all,<note n="r" place="margin">Coal, p. 61, 62.</note> (saith his book) it may
be argued, that the said clause or any thing therein
contained, is not indeed <hi>introductory of any new power,</hi>
which was not in the Crown before, but rather <hi>decla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ratorie
of the old,</hi> which anciently did belong to all
Christian Kings, (as before any of them to the Kings

your Readers of the best part of all the businesse. For
here we have two things which are worth the finding:
First what it is, which, as you say, is by that honoura<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble
personage made to be of <hi>treasonable</hi> nature: <hi>viz.</hi>
not onely to maintaine that Kings have their authori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty
by the positive law of nations, but that they have
no more power than the people hath. Next, who
they be that teach this doctrine, not onely <hi>Traitors,</hi>
and <hi>treasonable Papists,</hi> as you make him say, but also
<hi>seditious Sectaries and Puritanes, Buchanan, Knox, and
Penry,</hi> and such like. Nor was it taught by them, the
leaders onely, but as it followeth in that place, by
<hi>these, and those that are their followers, and of their facti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on,
there is in their pamphlets too much such traiterous
<pb n="36" facs="tcp:4200:35"/>
seed sowne.</hi> The <hi>Puritans</hi> are, I see, beholding to you,
for lending them so fine a cloake to hide their kna<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>very.
And hereupon I will conclude, how great a
<hi>Royalist</hi> soever you pretend to be, <hi>you love 'the King
well, but the Puritans better.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>From the originall and fountaine of the soveraigne
power, wee must next follow you unto the exercise
thereof. And here you aske the question,<note n="a" place="margin">pag. 32.</note> 
                     <hi>How
doth the Doctor make it appeare, that his most excellent
Majesty hath commanded any such matter? or that there
is (as he avows) any publick order for the same?</hi> viz: for
placing the Communion Table <hi>Altar-wise.</hi> To this
you answer, (for you play all parts) that he shall make
it <hi>cock-sure by three Apodicticall demonstrations:</hi> which
are, as afterwards you dispose them, the <hi>practice of
his Majesties Chappell,</hi> the <hi>Queenes Injunctions,</hi> and
his most excellent <hi>Majesties declaration</hi> about S. <hi>Gre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gories.</hi>
But first, before we proceed further, let mee
aske one question: Where doe you finde the Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctor
say that his most excellent Majesty hath <hi>com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manded</hi>
any such matter? No where, most certaine, in
the booke; nor any where that I can tell of, but in the
mint of your imagination, where there is coynage all
the yeere of these poore<note n="b" place="margin">
                        <hi>Double</hi> a piece of brasse coyn in <hi>France,</hi> of which five goe to an Engl<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

                     <hi>double</hi> ones. The Doctor
saith indeed, <q>His sacred Majesty hath already decla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red
his pleasure in the case of S. <hi>Gregories,</hi> and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by
given <hi>incouragement</hi> to the <hi>Metropolitans, Bishops,</hi>
and other <hi>Ordinaries,</hi> to require the like in all the
Churches committed to them.</q>
                     <note n="c" place="margin">Co<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

                     <hi>Incouragements</hi> are
no <hi>Command,,</hi> you had best say so howsoever. For if
they were, I could soone tell you in your eare, who is
a very disobedient subject. But let that passe, <hi>cum coe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teris
erroribus,</hi> and see if that be better which comes
<pb n="37" facs="tcp:4200:35"/>
after next. I would faine hope some good of you, but
I finde no ground for it: you misreport him so excee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding
shamelesly in every passage. The first (you say)
of his <hi>three Apodicticall demonstrations,</hi> (as you please
to slight them) is, that it is so<note n="d" place="margin">pag. 32, 33.</note> in his Majesties <hi>Chap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pell,
where the ancient Orders of the Church of Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land
have beene best preserved, and without which (per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>haps)
we had before this beene at a losse amongst our selves
for the whole forme and fashion of divine service. The
Chappell of the King being the best Interpreter of the
law which himself enacted, wherein the Communion Ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble
hath so stood as now it doth, sithence the beginning of
Qu.</hi> Elizabeth, <hi>what time that Rubrick in the Common-prayer-booke
was confirmed and ratified.</hi> Thus you re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>port
the Doctors words, and with shame enough.
The Doctor saith not any where, (exclusively of the
Cathedralls, as you vouch him here) that the <hi>ancient
Orders of the Church of</hi> England <hi>have beene best preser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved
in his Majesties Chappell, without the which (per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>haps)
we had been at a losse, &amp;c.</hi> These are your words,
and not the Doctors. The Doctors words are these:

of <hi>England</hi> have beene best preserved in the Chap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pels
of the Kings Majesty, and <hi>the Cathedrals of this
Kingdome</hi> (good Sir marke you that;) without the
which, perhaps, we had before this beene at a losse
amongst our selves, for the whole forme and fashi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
of divine service.</q> Here you leave out, most wil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fully,
to say no worse, <hi>and the Cathedrals of this King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome,</hi>
not so much to belye the Doctor, as to devise
some quarrell with his Majesties <hi>Chappell,</hi> which you
cast many an evill eye at. And thereupon conclude
most gravely,<note n="f" place="margin">pag 35.</note> 
                     <hi>To what use serve our grave and wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thy

if we had been long before this at a losse in England
for the whole form and fashion of divine service, but for
one Deane, and so many Gentlemen of the Kings Chappell.</hi>
Lord what a grosse of words is here drawne together,
to fight with nothing but a poore fancy of your own;
at most with one poore Deane, and a few simple gen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tlemen
of that contemptible place, the Kings Chap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pell
Royall. Lesse strength, and fewer weapons
would have beene sufficient, to drive this silly troope
before you; whom you might easily have scattered
with your very breath, and made them waite upon
your triumph at the first words speaking. <hi>Dicite Io

                  </p>
                  <p>As little truth you use in citing of the other passage
from the Doctors text; and far lesse modesty in your
second onset on his Majesties Chappell. You make
the Doctor say, <hi>The Chappell of the King, being the best
Interpreter of the law which himselfe enacted, wherein
the Communion table hath so stood as now it doth, since the

Good Sir have patience but a little, I will pay you all.
And tell me I beseech you first, where did the Doctor
ever say they should? The former place you guelded

<hi>Interpreter</hi> of the law which himselfe enacted, &amp;c.
as before we had it: or <hi>of Collegiate and Cathedrall
Churches,</hi> the best observers of the forme and order
of Gods publike service; the Vicar had good war<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rant
for what he did.</q> Here you leave out again the
<hi>Cathedrall and Collegiate Churches,</hi> to pick a second
quarrell with his Majesties <hi>Chappell:</hi> the Doctor say<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
no where, as you make him say, that the Parochi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>all
Churches are to precedent themselves (expresly
and exclusively) by the Chappell Royall (though had
he said so, you would hardly make your part against
him) but that they are to precedent themselves by the

<q>And therefore if it bee so in the Chappels and Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thedrall
Churches, as the Epistoler doth acknow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge,
it is a pregnant argument that so it ought to be

of the Mother Churches.</q> 
                     <hi>The Mother Churches,</hi>

observations of publishing the new Missall by

the distinct service in the Chappels of <hi>Salamanca,</hi> from
those that are in Parish Churches; the severall uses of
singing service in this Church, the ancient courses in
some others. All these are onely toyes to take up the
time with, and conclude nothing to the purpose which
we have in hand, as they confute not any thing that
the Doctor saith. Yet since you speake so despicably
of his Majesties <hi>Chappell,</hi> and the <hi>use</hi> thereof;<note n="l" place="margin">pag. 36.</note> as one
that <hi>never heard till now the use of the Chappell:</hi> I trust

those <hi>Rubricks, Lawes,</hi> and <hi>Canons,</hi> which you else<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>where
speake of. Nor could you preach a worse,

as little truth. Those words, <hi>and as shall be appointed by
the Visitors,</hi> relate not to the placing of the table,
which was determined of in the <hi>Injunction,</hi> but to the
covering of the same, wherein the said <hi>Injunctions</hi> had
determined nothing. For marke the words; <q>

that being the table was (by the <hi>Injunction</hi>) to bee
placed where the Altar stood, above the steps, (as by

and will not let a <hi>why not</hi> passe, if it come in your way.
But this is, as <hi>Domitian</hi> said of <hi>S<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

proverb, <hi>like pebbles</hi> in a withe. But so, it seemes, you
will not leave us. You have another answer to the
<hi>Queenes Injunction,</hi> touching the <hi>setting of the table in
the place where the Altar stood:</hi> which is, <hi>that it might
stand above the steps with the end Eastward, and the side
Northward,</hi> and<note n="l" place="margin">pag. 44.</note> yet <hi>obey the words of the Injunction,</hi>
and be in the place where the Altar stood. How so? Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause,
say you, the <hi>Injunction was directed to her Majesties
subjects, not to her Mathematicians,</hi> and <hi>therefore was
more likely to use the terme of a common and ordinary,
than a proper and Mathematicall place.</hi> And so the place
of the Altar, in this Injunction, is not all and in all di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mensions,
but some part onely of the room which the
Altar filled. I gather by your style, you are some great
body, <hi>some Minister,</hi> as the <hi>Licence</hi> stiles you; &amp; doubt
not but you have many servants, although not many
<hi>Mathematicians,</hi> attending on you. And let me put you
a familiar case, this once. It is a thing I use not often.
Suppose you have an old <hi>side-board,</hi> or <hi>Court-cupboard</hi>
standing in your dining-room; &amp; you command your
servants (being no <hi>Mathematicians,</hi> suppose that too) to
take the <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>aid old <hi>side-board,</hi> or <hi>Court-cupboard</hi> away, &amp;
set another in the place: If he should set it end-wise,
where the other stood side-wise, would not your bloud
be up, and your black staffe about his eares? Your dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ference
out of <hi>Aristotle</hi> between <gap reason="foreign">

                     </gap>,
serves for nothing here, more than to make a shew,
and to deceive poore people that understand it not.
And yet in confidence of the cause, you tell the Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctor,

whatsoever scandalous conceit comes next to hand,
we are sure to heareof. It would do better, as I take it,
if when you write next of a sacred argument, some

                  </p>
                  <p>Now for the 3. in which you have disposed the
flower of all your Armie, your very <hi>Ianizaries,</hi> you
tell us with like confidence, that<note n="p" place="margin">pag. 47.</note> if by these <hi>In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>junctions,</hi>
the table was to stand where the Altar
stood; then should the said <hi>Injunctions vary from the
rites, which but few daies before had been prescribed by
Parliament, to be used in the booke of Common-prayers.</hi>
How prove you that? Marry say you, the <hi>Minister
appointed to reade the Communion, is directed to reade the
Commandements, not at the end, but the North side of the
table, which implyes the end to be placed towards the East
great window.</hi> 2. It <hi>was practiced so in K.</hi> Edwards
<hi>time, as</hi> is (not proved, but) <hi>endeavoured to be proved
out of the</hi> troubles at Francofurt. 3. <hi>Because it is very
likely that</hi> Cox, Grindall, <hi>and</hi> Whitehead (<hi>being
halfe the number of the per<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                           <desc>•</desc>

                        </gap> which
was to be confirmed in the Parliament following) would
observe that ceremonie in placing the Communion-table,
which themselves abroad, and at home had formerly pra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cticed.</hi>
These are the Arguments we must trust to, to
<pb n="49" facs="tcp:4200:41"/>
confirme the point; but these will not do it: for they
are onely say-soes, and no proofes at all; and might as
justly be denied by us, as venturously affirmed by you.
But we will scan them severally, beginning first with
that comes last, and so proceeding <hi>ascendendo,</hi> untill
all be answered. First then, <hi>Cox, Grindall</hi> and <hi>White<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>head,</hi>
made not up halfe the number of the Perusers
of the Liturgie. The Author whom you cite,
<note n="q" place="margin">Camden in Eliz. An. 1558.</note> names us eight in all, <hi>Parker, Bill, May, Cox, Grin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dall,
Whitehead, Pilkington,</hi> and Sir <hi>Thomas Smith;</hi> all
joynt-Commissioners in the business. So that unless
it may be proved that three and three makes eight;
(and if it may be proved you are more cunning at
Arithmetick, than in all the <hi>Mathematicks</hi> beside:)
<hi>Grindall,</hi> and <hi>Cox,</hi> and <hi>Whitehead</hi> made not halfe the
number. But let that passe for once, how shall wee
know that they did place the Communion-table end-long,
both at home and abroad? For this we are di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rected
to the <hi>troubles at Francofurt,</hi> pag. 23. and 24.
in which there is not any word that reflects that way.
All we finde there, is the recitall of a letter sent from
the conformable <hi>English-men</hi> at <hi>Strasburgh</hi> to the
<hi>schismaticall congregation</hi> of the <hi>English-men</hi> in
<hi>Francofurt,</hi> about reducing them unto the booke of
Common-prayers established in the latter end of
K. <hi>Edward</hi> 6. which letter was delivered to them, by
M<hi rend="sup">r</hi>. <hi>Grindall</hi> and M<hi rend="sup">r</hi>. <hi>Chambers,</hi> and signed by 16. of
their hands, <hi>Grindals</hi> being one; but not one word of
<hi>Cox</hi> or <hi>Whitehead.</hi> Or grant this too, that <hi>Grindall, Cox</hi>
and <hi>Whitehead</hi> placed their Communion table, end-long,
when they were abroad, and might be fearefull
of offending those amongst whom they lived: yet
would it be no good conclusion, that therefore they

of an oblong square.</hi> This, if well done, is worth the

had <hi>about him all the best Mathematicians in</hi> Europe,
<hi>when he renewed</hi> (or changed) <hi>the Calendar,</hi> doth call

strangest sequele that I ever heard of. Nor can it
possibly hold good, unlesse it had beene said withall,
that in the setting out the said <hi>Pontificall,</hi> he had con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sulted
with those <hi>Mathematicians,</hi> in this very thing, by
whose advise and counsell he renewed the Calendar.
And be that granted too: what then? Why then say
you, in <hi>his Pontificall he makes no more sides of an Al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tar,

being in mine of <hi>Paris,</hi> 1615. pag. 232. &amp; 247. But
cleerely this makes good what the Doctor saith. For
the <hi>anteriour</hi> part must needs be that at which the

order, is with his face to the East: and the <hi>posteriour,</hi>
that which is next the wall, which <hi>pag.</hi> 183. you call
the back-side of the <hi>Altar.</hi> And then it must needs
be, that the two sides thereof, as they are called in the

the meaning and intent thereof) is aswell fulfilled
by the Minister, standing at the North end of the
Table, placed along the wall, as at the <hi>north side</hi> of
the same standing towards the window.</q> I hope you
have no cause to brag of this discovery. That which
comes after, concerneth the translation of the booke
of Common prayer,<note n="e" place="margin">pag. 56.</note> by <hi>Walter Haddon,</hi> as you con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jecture:
which you except against, as recommended
to a few Colledges, and not unto the Church of <hi>Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land:</hi>
and yet acknowledging in your <hi>margin,</hi> that it
was recommended unto all the Colledges, which are
the Seminaries, no doubt, of the Church of <hi>England.</hi>
2. That it never was confirmed by Act of Parliament,
or by K. <hi>Iames</hi> his Proclamation; but take notice of
the authorizing thereof under the great Seale of Qu.
<hi>Elizabeth,</hi> no lesse effectuall for that purpose than a
Proclamation. 3. That in that translation<note n="f" place="margin">pag. 57.</note> the <hi>Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lendar</hi>
is full of Saints, and some of them got into red
scarlet; which howsoever it may cast some scandall
on the Queene, (whom you have a stitch at) is nothing
to the prejudice of that translation of the <hi>Rubrick.</hi>
4. That D<hi rend="sup">r</hi> 
                     <hi>Whitaker,</hi> when he was a young man, was
set by <hi>his Vncle, the Deane of Pauls, to translate it again
into Latine,</hi> which makes you thinke that <hi>other version
was either exhausted, or misliked.</hi> Misliked you cannot
say, till you bring a reason; and if it was so soone ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hausted,
it is a good argument that it was well done,
and universally received. Lastly, you fly to your old
shift, affirming, that those times considered, the <hi>Li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turgie</hi>
was <hi>translated rather to comply with the forraigne,
than to reigle and direct the English Churches.</hi> Which
were it so, yet it makes nothing to this purpose. For
whether it be <hi>pars septentrionalis,</hi> the northerne part,
<pb n="55" facs="tcp:4200:44"/>
or <hi>latus septentrionale,</hi> the northerne side, it must be
equally displeasing to the <hi>forraigne Churches,</hi> (for you
meane onely those of the Church of <hi>Rome)</hi> in which
the <hi>Priest</hi> officiating is injoyned to stand <hi>in medio Al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taris,</hi>
with his back towards the people; being a dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferent
way from that prescribed the Minister in the
Liturgie of the Church of <hi>England.</hi> Certes you doe

                        </gap>.</note> I must have
one pull more with you about this <hi>Rubrick;</hi> and since
you give so faire an hint, about the <hi>Statute</hi> which con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firmes
it. The Parliament 1. of Qu. <hi>Elizabeth</hi> began
at <hi>Westminster, Ian. 23. An.</hi> 1558. and there continued
till the 8. of <hi>May</hi> next following: in which there
passed the <hi>Act, for uniformity of Common prayer, and
service of the Church, and administration of the Sacra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments,
cap.</hi> 2. Together with this <hi>Act</hi> there passed
another, inabling the Queene to delegate what part
she pleased, of her supreame power <hi>in Ecclesiasticis,</hi> to
such Commissioners as she should appoint, according
to the forme in that Act laid down. Presently on the
dissolving of the said Parliament, the Queene sets out
a booke of <hi>Injunctions, aswell to the Clergie, as to the
Laitie of this Realme:</hi> in one of<note n="h" place="margin">Injunct. for Tables in the Chu<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                           <desc>•</desc>
                        </gap>ch.</note> which <hi>Injunctions,</hi>
it is cleere and evident, that howsoever <hi>in many and
sundry parts of the Realme, the Altars of the Churches
were removed, and Tables placed for the administration
of the Sacrament: yet in some other places the Altars
were not then removed, upon opinion of some other order to
be taken by her Majesties Visitours.</hi> This put together,
I would faine have leave to aske this question: The
<hi>Rubrick</hi> ordering that the <hi>Minister should stand at the
<pb n="56" facs="tcp:4200:45"/>
north-side of the Table,</hi> (there where tables were;) and
in so <hi>many places</hi> of this Kingdome, the <hi>Altars standing</hi>
as before: where should the Minister stand to dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>charge
his duty? Not in the <hi>middle</hi> of the Altar, as
was appointed in the Liturgie of K. <hi>Edw. An.</hi> 1549.
That was disliked and altered in the Service-booke of
the yeere 1542. confirmed this Parliament. Nor on
the <hi>North-side,</hi> as you cal a <hi>side:</hi> for that supposeth such
a situation, as was not proper to the Altar. Therefore
it must be at the <hi>northern end,</hi> or narrower side there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of,
as before was said; or else no Service to be done,
no Sacraments administred. The Parliament was so
farre from determining any thing touching the taking
downe of Altars, that a precedent Act 1 <hi>Mar. cap.</hi> 3.
for punishment of such as should deface them, was by
them continued. This was left solely to the Queene,
the Metropolitan and Commissioners, to be done, o<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>
not done, as might seeme most convenient to them:
and yet the Parliament confirmed that <hi>Rubrick</hi> for
<hi>standing at the north side of the Table.</hi> And for the
<hi>Queene,</hi> the B<hi rend="sup">p</hi> yeelds it in his letter, that shee and her
<hi>Commissioners</hi> (or as your altered Copie hath it, <hi>she
and her Counsell) were content the Altars should stand</hi>
still as before they did: the <hi>Injunction</hi> leaving it as a
thing indifferent, and <hi>of no great moment, so that the
Sacrament be duely and reverently administred.</hi> Neither
did the <hi>Commissioners</hi> in their Visitation, determine
any thing for taking downe of <hi>Altars,</hi> where they
found them standing, that wee can meet with in their
<hi>Orders</hi> of the yeere 1561. Nor need you stick at the
word <hi>Table,</hi> mentioned in the <hi>Rubrick,</hi> confirmed in
that Parliament, as if that did imply, or intimate the
necessary taking downe of <hi>Altars.</hi> For you your selfe
<pb n="57" facs="tcp:4200:45"/>
have told us, that sacrifice and Altars being relatives,
no sooner<note n="i" place="margin">pag. 16.</note> was the <hi>sacrifice abolished, but these (call
them what we will) are no more Altars, but tables of
stone and timber;</hi> in the Epistle to the Vicar. So then,
that which was once an <hi>Altar,</hi> when there was a <hi>sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crifice,</hi>
(the <hi>sacrifice</hi> of the <hi>Masse</hi> you mean) is now be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come
a <hi>table only;</hi> whether of stone or timber, that's
no way materiall: and therefore standing as they did
when the <hi>Act</hi> was made, the Minister could not pos<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sibly
officiate at the <hi>north-side,</hi> unlesse you call the nar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rower
end, a <hi>side,</hi> as the Doctor doth; and as your
selfe doe, did you understand your selfe, out of the
<hi>Pontificall.</hi> Besides, the meaning of the Act is to be
considered, not the words alone: which was to fixe
the Minister to some certaine posture. For in K. <hi>Ed<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards</hi>
first Liturgie, <hi>An.</hi> 1549. the Minister was ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pointed,
as before is said, to stand <hi>in medi<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                           <desc>•</desc>
                        </gap> Altaris,</hi>
with his back towards the people. After, when as
the King had commanded to take downe the <hi>Altars,</hi>
and to set up <hi>tables,</hi> then followed first a difference a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout
the situation of those <hi>Tables;</hi> some being <hi>placed</hi>
like <hi>Altars,</hi> and some like <hi>tables,</hi> according as we have
it in the Acts and Monuments, <hi>part 2. pag.</hi> 700. Here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>upon
followed that confusion which <hi>Miles Huggard</hi>
speakes of amongst the Ministers themselves: <hi>some
standing north-ward, some south-ward, and some west-ward.</hi>
For remedy whereof, it was appointed in the
second Liturgie, that hee, the Minister, should have
some certaine point, whereupon to fixe: your selfe af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firming,<note n="k" place="margin">pag<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> 48.</note> that <hi>this contention was determined by the</hi>
Rubrick, <hi>still in force, for the</hi> North-side <hi>of the Table.</hi>
So that the meaning of the <hi>Rubrick</hi> being onely this,
to assigne the Minister some certaine point whereon to
<pb n="58" facs="tcp:4200:46"/>
fasten his aspect, in his officiating at the holy <hi>table<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
                     </hi>
that meaning is aswell complyed withall, in standing
at the north or narrower side thereof, placed along
the wall; as standing at the longer side, with one e<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>d
towards the East great window. Nay I will goe a lit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle
farther, and put it to consideration, (and no more
than so) whether the Rubrick ordering that the Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nister
shall stand at the North side of the Table, doth
not imply the Tables standing Altarwise, close along
the wall, if within the Chancell; and close to the
partition, if within the Church. And I propose it on
this ground: Because in case it had been meant in the
composure of that Rubrick, that the holy Table
should stand endlong, and farre off from the wall, or
the partition, the fittest posture for the Minister had
beene at the East-end thereof, with his face down<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards,
towards the people. Certaine I am, that in
that posture he would be best both seene and heard of
all the Congregation, (better by farre than standing
at either side thereof either north or south) which
seemes to be the thing most stood upon in the Bishops
letter to the Vicar. But I propose this onely as a con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sideration;
I affirme it not.</p>
                  <p>Next, wee must follow you to the third Argument
of the Doctor, drawne from the exercise of that su<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preme
power <hi>in Ecclesiasticis,</hi> which is invested in the
King. For granting<note n="l" place="margin">pag. 42.</note> that the <hi>King may command a
greater matter of this nature, than that the Table should
be placed where the Altar stood:</hi> you onely seeme to
doubt<note n="m" place="margin">pag. 58.</note> whether his Majesty hath any way decla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red
his pl<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

                     </gap>asure<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> that hee would have it so or not.
Before you asked the Doctor where the King <hi>com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manded</hi>
it, as if not any thing but an expresse com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mand,
<pb n="59" facs="tcp:4200:46"/>
had the power to stir you: when other men, as

this to be) sufficient inducements for a subject

style, and onely stand on the denyall, that his most
sacred Majesty hath not in this case <hi>declared his plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sure:</hi>
you meane, perhaps, not so declared it, as that
it pleaseth you to obey his pleasure. The Doctor
saith<note n="o" place="margin">Co<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

already declared his pleasure in the case of S.</hi> Gregories,
<hi>and thereby given encouragement to the Metropolitans,
Bishops, and other Ordinaries, to require the like in all the
Churches committed to them.</hi> Your answer is as short,
but not halfe so sweet,<note n="p" place="margin">pag. 58.</note> that it <hi>is most untrue, that his
Majesty hath declared in that Act, one word of his plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sure
hereupon:</hi> i. e. (as you expound your selfe) <hi>a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainst
the contents of the Bishops letter.</hi> Most gravely
spoken. What had his Majesty to doe with the <hi>Bi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>shops
letter,</hi> that he should signifie his pleasure there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>upon,
when as the merit of the same was not called in
question? <hi>Aquila non capit muscas,</hi> you know the
proverbe. The businesse then in question, was the
standing of the Table in S. <hi>Gregories Church,</hi> which
by the Ordinary there, was placed <hi>Altar-wise:</hi> and
his most sacred Majesty did <hi>thereupon declare his plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sure,
approving and confirming the Act of the said Or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinary.</hi>
You chalenge this as most <hi>untrue,</hi> and present<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
fall foule on the poore man, for <hi>libelling against the
Bishop, malicious falsifying of his Authors in every
page:</hi> and finally (your owne turne served) for com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ming
to that <hi>height of impudency,</hi> as <hi>ponere os in coelum,</hi>
to out-face <hi>heaven it selfe, and mis-report the justice of
<pb n="60" facs="tcp:4200:47"/>
so divine a Maiesty.</hi> Why so? Because, say you, <hi>If
we abstract from this Declaration, (which the bold man
hath printed for an Act of Counsell) the allegations,
which he,</hi> the said bold fellow, <hi>calleth the relations of
both parties; and his Maiesties iust pleasure for the dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>solving
of the appeale: the remainder will prove a full
confirmation of the Bishops letter.</hi> If so, <hi>then</hi>

                     <hi>frange
leves calamos, &amp; scinde Thalia libellos,</hi> the Doctor
tooke much paines to little purpose. And that it is so,
you are peremptorie, as in all things else, because the
Declaration tels us, <q>That the liberty given by the
Communion booke, or Canon, for placing the
Communion Table in any Church or Chappell
with most conveniencie, is not to be understood,
as if it were ever left to the discretion of the Parish,
much lesse to the particular fancie of any humorous
person, but to the judgement of the <hi>Ordinarie,</hi> to
whose place and function it doth properly belong
to give direction in that point, both for the thing it
self, and for the time when and how long, as he may
finde cause.</q> These are his Ma<hi rend="sup">ties</hi> words indeed, <hi>men<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tis
aureae verba bractcata,</hi> as you rightly call them:
but they oppose not any thing that the Doctor saith.
You finde not in the Doctor, that the placing of the
holy table, or the interpreting of those <hi>Canons</hi> and
<hi>Rubricks</hi> which concerne it, was either left to <hi>the
discretion of the Parish,</hi> or <hi>to the particular fancie of any
humorous person</hi> in the same: which is the onely thing
which that part of his Majesties Declaration doth re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>late
unto. That which the Doctor saith is this, that
by the <hi>declaration</hi> of his Majesties pleasure in that pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sent
businesse, there was <hi>incouragement given to the
Metropolitans, Bishops,</hi> and <hi>other Ordinaries</hi> to doe the
<pb n="61" facs="tcp:4200:47"/>
like: <hi>i. e.</hi> to place the <hi>holy table</hi> in the severall Chur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ches
committed to them, as it was placed in S. <hi>Grego<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries</hi>
by the <hi>Ordinary</hi> thereof. This I am sure, his Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jesties

                     <seg rend="decorInit">T</seg>His day was debated before his
Majesty sitting in Counsell, the
question and difference which
grew about the removing of the
Communion table in S. <hi>Gregories</hi> Church, neer
the Cathedrall Church of S. <hi>Paul,</hi> from the
middle of the Chancell to the upper end, and
there placed <hi>Altar<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

                        </gap>wise,</hi> in such maner as it stan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deth
in the said Cathedrall &amp; Mother Church,
(as also in all other Cathedrals, and in his Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jesties
<pb n="63" facs="tcp:4200:48"/>
owne Chappell) and as is consonant to
the practise of approved Antiquity. Which re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>movall
and placing of it in that sort, was done
by order from the Deane and Chapter of S.
<hi>Pauls,</hi> who are <hi>Ordinaries</hi> thereof, as was a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vowed
before his Majesty by D<hi rend="sup">r</hi>. <hi>King,</hi> and D<hi rend="sup">r</hi>.
<hi>Montfort,</hi> two of the Prebends there. Yet some
few of the Parishioners, being but five in num<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber,
did complaine of this Act by Appeale to
the Court of Arches, pretending that the booke
of Common-prayer, and the 82. Canon, doe
give permission to place the Communion ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble,
where it may stand with most fitnesse and
convenience. Now his Majesty having heard a
particular relation made by the Counsell of
both parties of all the cariage and proceedings
in this cause, was pleased to declare his dislike
of all Innovation, and receding from ancient
constitutions, grounded upon just and warran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>table
reasons, especially in matters concerning
Ecclesiasticall order and government, knowing
how easily men are drawne to affect novelties,
and how soone weake judgements in such ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ses
may be over-taken and abused. And he was
also pleased to observe, that if those few Pari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>shioners
might have their wills, the difference
<pb n="64" facs="tcp:4200:49"/>
thereby from the foresaid Cathedrall mother
Church, by which all other Churches depend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
thereon ought to be guided, would be the
more notorious, and give more subject of dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>course
&amp; disputes that might be spared, by rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son
of S. <hi>Gregories</hi> standing close to the wall
thereof. And likewise for so much as concerns
the liberty given by the said <hi>Common</hi> booke or
<hi>Canon,</hi> for placing the Communion table in a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny
Church or Chappell with most conveni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ency:
that liberty is not so to be understood, as
if it were ever left to the discretion of the Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rish,
much lesse to the particular fancy of any
humorous person, but to the judgement of the
<hi>Ordinary</hi> to whose place and function it doth
properly belong to give direction in that point,
both for the thing it self, and for the time, when
and how long, as hee may finde cause. Vpon
which consideration his Majesty <hi>declared him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selfe,
That he well approved and confirmed the Act
of the said Ordinary,</hi> and also gave command, that
if those few Parishioners before mentioned,
doe proceed in their said appeale, then the <hi>Dean
of the Arches</hi> (who was then attending at the
hearing of the cause) shall confirme the said <hi>Or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der</hi>
of the aforesaid Deane and Chapter.</p>

This is the Declaration of his sacred Majesty, faith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fully
copyed out of the Registers of his Counsell-Table.
Out of the which I doe observe, first, that
the <hi>Ordinary</hi> did <hi>de facto,</hi> remove the Communion-Table
from the middle of the Chancell, and place it
<hi>Altar wise</hi> at the upper end. Secondly, that in the
doing of it, they did propose unto themselves, the
patterne not alone of their owne Cathedrall mother
Church, but of all other Cathedralls, and his Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jesties
Chappell; and therewithall the practice of
approved Antiquity. Thirdly, that his most excel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lent
Majestie upon the hearing of the businesse, de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>claring
his dislike of all <hi>Innovations,</hi> did yet ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prove
the order of the <hi>Ordinary;</hi> which shewes, that
hee conceived it not to be any variance from the an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cient
constitutions of this Church. Fourthly, that all
<hi>Parochiall</hi> Churches ought to be guided by the pat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terne
of the <hi>Mother</hi> Church, upon the which they
doe depend. Fifthly, that not the people, but the
<hi>Ordinary,</hi> is to interpret as well the <hi>R<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

<hi>Canon,</hi> touching the most convenient placing of the
holy table. Sixthly, that i<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap> pertaineth to the place
and function of the <hi>Ordinary</hi> to give directions in
that kinde, both for the thing it selfe <hi>(how it shall
stand)</hi> and for the time, when and how long, <hi>(it shall
so stand)</hi> as hee findes occasion. And last of all, that
notwithstanding any thing that was objected from
the said Canon and Communion booke, his Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jesty
did well <hi>approve</hi> the Act of the said <hi>Ordinary;</hi>
and not <hi>approve</hi> it onely, but <hi>confirme</hi> it too: giving
command to the Deane of the Arches, that he should
finally and judicially <hi>confirme</hi> the same, if the appeale
were followed by the said Parishioners. This is, I
<pb n="66" facs="tcp:4200:50"/>
trow, a <hi>Declaration of his Majesties pleasure;</hi> not onely
in relation to the present case, that of S. <hi>Gregories</hi> then
and there by him determined; but to all others also
of the same nature. Hee that so well approved that
Act of the Deane and Chapter of S. <hi>Pauls;</hi> would
questionlesse approve the like in another <hi>Ordinary.</hi>
                     <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

same, the <hi>Mother Churches</hi> no lesse to be followed by
the <hi>Parochials</hi> in one place than others: why should
you thinke the sentence or decision should be diffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rent?
Or if you thinke this Declaration of his Maje<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sties
pleasure is no incouragement to other <hi>Ordinaries,</hi>
to bring the Parish-Churches to conforme with the
<hi>Cathedrals</hi> in this particular; because his Majesty doth
not say, in termes expresse, that hee would also very
well approve the like in all other <hi>Ordinaries:</hi> you doe

the mark he aimes at: not caring (so he looke like
some furious driver, and make his chariot wheeles

tells us, he hath<note n="a" place="margin">pag. 60. 61.</note> 
                     <hi>reduced into a body all the Regall;</hi>

having undertaken him, we must do our best, to
blow away this dust, and cleere the passage, that every

The Doctor saith in severall places of his booke,
<q>that the <hi>Ordinary, of his owne authority, may,</hi> if he

that his most sacred Majesty hath <hi>given in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>couragement

do, in his decision of the case about S. <hi>Gregories:</hi> and
therefore as the case then stood with the Doctors

<hi>require more of his obedience, than his curiosity.</hi>
Otherwise should all men be so affected as to demur

exteriour order and publick government, till they
are satisfied in the grounds and reasons of the said
commands; or should they flie off from their duty,
at sight of every new device that was offered to
them; there would soone be a speedy dissolution
both of Church and State. And to that purpose
there was used a speech from <hi>Tacitus,</hi>

Bishops immediate officers the Church-wardens were, or
ought to have: and that he did not any thing against the
Canon, in causing the table to be disposed of to a more con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venient
place than before it stood in.</hi> Where finde you
this? Not in the Doctor certainly, if you marke him
well. The Doctor speakes not any thing <hi>of the Canons</hi>

The Vicar, as before you charged it, <hi>desired to have an

Vicar, <hi>but the</hi> Church-wardens <hi>were to provide (uten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sils,</hi>

                     <q> that for any thing those
<hi>Canons</hi> (and not the Canon) tell us, the Minister (as
in this case the Vicar) was to have a greater hand in
ordering the said table, being so provided, than the
Church-wardens were or ought to have. And that
the Vicar did not any thing in this case against the
<hi>Canon (i. e.</hi> the Canon then proposed) for he provi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded
not the table, but onely caused the table which
he found provided, to be disposed of to a more con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venient
place than before it stood in.</q> Have you

The Doctor neither there, nor elsewhere, doth justi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fie
the Vicars Act, <hi>peromnia;</hi> nor indeed in any thing,
if he did any thing in this, against the Canon: but saith

that the <hi>Vicar</hi> did acquaint the <hi>Bishop</hi> with his desires,
and found from him a toleration at the least, if not an
approbation, as before I said. Yet upon this weake
ground, which will beare no foundation of a solid
building, you runne into a long and vaine discourse,
of the authority and office of <hi>Bishops, Archdeacons,</hi> and

seemes, to take all this paines for you, and doe no ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour

you trust them somewhat further than a wise man
would; and suffer them to plume themselves with the
Bishops feathers: taking that power unto themselves,
which you full faine would fixe originally in the <hi>Dio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cesan.</hi>

the <hi>piety of these times,</hi> inclinable in an higher degree
to that <hi>uniformity,</hi> than any of the times before?
When did you ever finde a King, that did so seriously
affect <hi>Church-worke;</hi> or that hath more endeavoured
to advance that decency and comlinesse in the perfor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mance
of divine Offices, which God expecteth and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quires,
than his sacred Majestie? His owne example
in the constant keeping of the houres of prayer, and
most devout behaviour in the acts thereof: thinke you
they are not sweet incitements unto all his subjects, to
follow those most pious steps in the which he walks?

His Majesties religious carriage in the house of
God, and due observance of those <hi>Orders</hi> which the
law requires in common people, is a more excellent
<pb n="85" facs="tcp:4200:59"/>
Sermon upon that text, than ever you yet preached
on any. They must be needs exceeding dull, or some<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>what
worse, which will not profit very much by such
heavenly doctrine. If you have <hi>opened your eyes so wide,</hi>
as you say you have, it is not that you cannot, but you
will not see it; and are growne blinde, not out of want
of sight, but want of piety. Adde to all these, the
Princely zeale of his magnificent heart, for the repai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring
of S. <hi>Pauls;</hi> by which example, questionlesse, the
other Churches in this land will fare the better. And
adde to that, his Majesties most sacred care, that in all
places where he comes in Progresse, what scantnesse
of roome soever was wont to be pretended, no conse<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crated
place shall bee prophaned by those imploy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments,
to which they have beene put in the times be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore.
And see you nothing all this while, no good
worke, no piety? Then looke into those <hi>Countrey
Churches,</hi> to which his Majestie in his times of <hi>Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gresse</hi>
repaires most frequently for hearing and atten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding
Gods publike service: leaving the privacy of his
owne Court, and presence, to set a copy to his people,
how to performe all true humility and religious ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>servations
in the house of God. If you see nothing yet,
and that there must be something which hath spoiled
your eye-sight; it is the too much light you live in: by
which you are so dazeled that you cannot see this part
of piety, or else so blinded that you will not. And we
may say of you in the Poets language, <hi>Sunt tenebrae per
tantum lumen obortae.</hi> Then to goe forwards, <hi>descendo,</hi>
can you remember any Metropolitan of and in this
Church (and gather all your wits about you) which
hath more seriously endeavoured to promote that <hi>uni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formity
of publike Order,</hi> than his Grace now being?
<pb n="86" facs="tcp:4200:60"/>
His cares and consultations to advance this worke, to
make <hi>Hierusalem</hi> (if such as you disturbed him not)
at <hi>unity within it selfe,</hi> are very easie to be seene: so
easie, that it were <hi>sensibile super sensorium ponere,</hi> to
insist long on it. The very clamours raised upon him,
by those who love nor <hi>unity</hi> nor <hi>uniformity,</hi> and have
an art of fishing with most profit, in a troubled water;
are better evidence of this, than you have any in your
booke to maintaine the cause. Nor heare wee any of
the <hi>other bels,</hi> which are not willing for their parts to
make up the <hi>Harmony;</hi> but that great <hi>Tom</hi> rings out of
tune. For when did you or any other know the
<hi>Prelates,</hi> generally, more throughly intent upon the
work committed to them; more earnest to reduce the
service of this Church to the <hi>Ancient Orders,</hi> ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pointed
in the Common-prayer booke? It is not long
since, that we had but halfe prayers in most Chur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ches;
and almost none at all in some, your friend
<hi>I. Cottons</hi> for example. See you no alteration in this
kinde? Is not the Liturgie more punctually observed
of late, in the whole forme and fashion of Gods
service, than before it was? Churches more beauti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fied
and adorned than ever since the Reformation; the
people more conformable to those reverend gestures
in the house of God, which though prescribed be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore,
were but little practised? <hi>Quisquis non videt,
coecus; quisquis videt, nec laudat, ingratus; quisquis

                     <note n="h" place="margin">August de Civit. Dei l. 1. c. 7.</note> as the Father hath
it. This, if ingratitude to God, and obstinate malice to
his Church, hath not made you blinde, you cannot
choose but see, though you would dissemble it: And
if you see it, do you not thinke it a <hi>good worke?</hi> and is

                     <hi>inclines</hi> to the advancement of that <hi>worke,</hi> than of the

case you will not help it forwards, (as I doubt you

                  </p>
                  <p>Having made merry with your friends, about the
<hi>inclination of these times to piety,</hi> and the advance<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
of so <hi>good a worke</hi> as the <hi>uniformity of publick</hi>
order: you pass, I know not how, to the <hi>Acts and
Monuments,</hi> and the examination of such passages as
were thence taken by the Doctor. Perhaps you are a
better <hi>Artist</hi> than I take you for: And being it is <hi>Art is
celare artem,</hi> you meane to tender to the world such
an <hi>Art</hi> of writing, as hath no <hi>art</hi> in it. But the lesse
cunning, the more truth, as we use to say. If we could
find it so, it were some amends; and though I see but
little hope, yet I meane to trie. The Doctor told you
in his<note n="k" place="margin">
                        <hi>Coal.</hi> p. 14.</note> 
                     <hi>Coale from the Altar,</hi> that <q>not a few of
those which suffered death for opposing the grosse
and carnall doctrine of <hi>transubstantiation,</hi> did not
onely well enough indure the name of <hi>Altar,</hi>
but without any doubt or scruple called the <hi>Lords
Supper</hi> sometimes a <hi>sacrifice,</hi> and many times the
<hi>Sacrament of the Altar.</hi>
                     </q> So that if they <hi>indured</hi> it
well enough, in others, or <hi>used</hi> it themselves <hi>without
<pb n="88" facs="tcp:4200:61"/>
doubt or scruple;</hi> it is as much as was intended by the
Doctor. And for the proofe of this, he first brings in
<hi>Iohn Fryth,</hi> relating in a letter to his private friends,
<hi>that they</hi> his adversaries <hi>examined</hi> him touching the
<hi>Sacrament of the Altar;</hi> whether it was the very body
of Christ, or no. <hi>These are</hi>

his.</hi> Why man, whose words soever they were in the

or scruple?</hi> finde you that he did stumble at them, or
dislike the phrase? Had he beene halfe so quarrelsome
at the phrase, as you are, he might have testified his
dislike in a word or two; the <hi>Sacrament of the Altar, as
they call it.</hi> Your selfe informe us from him, that in
some cases, at sometimes, he used that qualification,
as <hi>viz.</hi> p. 308. <hi>I added moreover that their Church (as
they call it) hath no such power and authority, &amp;c.</hi> An
Argument there of his dissent, none here: <hi>their Church

up once for all in his owne person, is yet said to be
offered up, not onely every yeare at <hi>Easter,</hi> but
also every day in the celebration of the Sacrament,

pag.</hi> 553. viz. <hi>as touching their Sacrament, which they
terme of the Altar;</hi> and so make it their terme, not his;
that is answered in, and with the former. Hee doth
not say, <hi>The Sacrament which they terme of the Altar;</hi>
but <hi>their Sacrament</hi> which they so terme, that is, the
<hi>Masse.</hi> The <hi>Sacrament of the Altar</hi> was the Fathers
language; to call their <hi>Masse</hi> so, was <hi>their</hi> owne.
Your other instance touching <hi>Philpot,</hi> out of the same
part, <hi>pag.</hi> 571. we shall see hereafter. Concerning Bp
<hi>Latimer,</hi> the Doctor told you,<note n="h" place="margin">Coal from the Altar, <hi>p.</hi> 15.</note> that hee plainly
granteth, that <hi>it (i. e.</hi> the holy Table) <hi>may be called an
Altar, and so the Doctors call it in many places; but
there is no propitiatory sacrifice but onely Christs.</hi> You,
in your repetition, leave out this, <hi>It may be called an
Altar,</hi> and make the Doctor say no more, than that
old <hi>Latimer</hi> plainly granteth, that the Doctors call it
so in many places: and thereupon inferre, he doth not
<note n="i" place="margin">pag. 90.</note> 
                     <hi>call it so himselfe.</hi> Then for the Doctors, (having

1 <hi>Edw. 6. cap.</hi> 1. of which the Doctor tells us,
<note n="p" place="margin">Coal from the Altar, <hi>p.</hi> 16.</note> that <q>it was resolved in the same, that the <hi>whole

a plaine abolition of the former <hi>Masse;</hi> yet the Act
was entituled, <hi>An Act against such persons as shall
speak irreverently against the Sacrament</hi> of the body
and bloud of Christ, commonly called the <hi>Sacra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment

of the Act, that there was a <hi>Writ</hi> determined of, up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on

Why doe you thinke the Doctor should be such a
flincher? First, as you say,<note n="r" place="margin">pag. 93.</note> 
                     <hi>because the</hi> Sacrament
of the Altar <hi>was not the name, but the addition onely to

imposture here on the Doctors-part? Affirmes hee
otherwise, than that the Sacrament of the Lords Sup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per
was, and is by that Statute (still in force) entituled
also by the name of <hi>Sacrament of the Altar?</hi> It is, you
say, a <hi>penall law,</hi> and being it was a <hi>penall law,</hi> it was to
speak <hi>ad captum vulgi.</hi> Doe you not call to mind, that

                  <p>You challenge upon all, and on no occasions, a spe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciall
interest in antiquity; and cite, as you have cause
sometimes, some of the Ancients that call it the Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crament
of the <hi>Altar:</hi> yet tell us, upon better thoughts,
that it is <hi>called so indeed, but not by the law of God,</hi>
                     <note n="z" place="margin">pag. 95.</note> 
                     <hi>nor
by the law of man; but commonly, that is, by the common
error and Popery of these times.</hi> The <hi>Papists</hi> are behol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding
to you, for giving them such interest in the An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cient
<hi>Fathers.</hi> The Fathers call it so, and it was cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led
so only by the common error and <hi>Poperic</hi> of these
later daies. Doe not you make the <hi>Fathers</hi> exceeding

young, or <hi>Popery</hi> exceeding old, in that you make the
<hi>Fathers</hi> and <hi>Popery</hi> of an equall standing. Your slender
observation, that in those times this very Sacrament
was called the <hi>Masse,</hi> and allowed to be called so by
Act of Parliament, (you meane it is so called in the
<hi>Liturgie,</hi> confirmed that Parliament, 2. <hi>&amp; 3. Edw.
6. c.</hi> 1.) is not worth the noting. Yet thereupon you
make this inference, that if the Doctor <hi>shall report of
you, that you have said Masse, when you have onely admi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nistred
the Communion, you will have your remedy against
him, as in case of slander.</hi> And well you may. You
know that Statute is repealed, there being another
<hi>Liturgie</hi> confirmed by Parliament, which makes void
the old. But so it is not with the Statute touching the
Sacrament <hi>of the Altar,</hi> which is as much in force as
the second <hi>Liturgie.</hi> Nor need you feare that any
man will report of you, that you have said <hi>Masse,</hi>
when you have only administred the <hi>Communion:</hi>
though some perhaps may say (and bid you take the
remedy that the law allowes you) that you, or some
good friend of yours, have offered to say <hi>Masse,</hi>
there where you ought to have administred the <hi>Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>munion</hi>
onely. Be not too busie on your chalenges, as
you love your selfe; lest some adventurous Sword<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man
bid you doe your worst, and take up the wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sters.</p>
                  <p>As for the <hi>Writ,</hi> directed in the body of the <hi>Act</hi> to

but onely that it was grounded on the Statute made con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerning

which you have already pronounced him guilty. For
you must needs <hi>correct the Statute,</hi> which the whole
Parliament (wiser I take it than your selfe) hath
thought fit to stand: and tell us of the Writ, (which
yet my Lord B<hi rend="sup">p</hi> of <hi>Lincoln,</hi> when he was <hi>Lord Keeper,</hi>
had no power to alter) that it<note n="f" place="margin">pag. 97.</note> ought to be issued <hi>con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tra

At least it should and might be lawfull for the rude
people so to call it, and none so bold as to controule
them. On them indeed you have trans-ferred it, in
your new edition of the letter, to excuse the Bishop:
<pb n="98" facs="tcp:4200:66"/>
but then you never tell us, as you might have done as

<hi>Prynne</hi> may furnish you with as good a note as that

new figure of the Doctors, all Bishops and Deanes of those

meant not. Hee knowes there have beene many Bi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>shops

conclude is this: that as there was a <hi>Bishop</hi> of <hi>Lincoln,</hi>

standing <hi>Table-wise,</hi> or in the middle of the Chaun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cell,
by the name of <hi>oyster-boorde:</hi> so to cry quitts
with them, there is (as you have now discovered him)
one Bishop of <hi>Lincoln</hi> and Deane of <hi>Westminster,</hi> that
calls it standing <hi>Altar-wise,</hi> by the name of <hi>Dresser.</hi>
As for <hi>Iohn Fox</hi> his marginall notes of <hi>the blasphemous

used the name of <hi>Altar,</hi> calling the blessed Sacrament,
the <hi>Sacrament of the Altar,</hi> without <hi>doubt or scruple.</hi>
And howsoever you endeavoured to stop their

and the condition of the writ in the same awarded,
from your vaine assaults; by which you cannot but
perceive, that if a man should call the Sacrament of
the Lords Supper, by the old knowne and common
name, (as your selfe confesseth it to be) of <hi>Sacrament

                     <hi>Injuctions,</hi> in the said first yeere of his
raigne, where it is called the blessed <hi>Sacrament of the
Altar.</hi> And in the <hi>Liturgie</hi> of the yeere 1549. being
the third yeere of that Kings raigne, it is agreed upon
both sides, that the holy Table is generally called an
<hi>Altar: every where called an Altar,</hi> as in the first, and
<hi>almost every where,</hi> as in your second Edition of the
Bishops Letter. Nor was it to be doubted, but that the
old <hi>Altars</hi> being standing, the old name continued.
The difference is, both for the <hi>time,</hi> how long they
stood; and for the <hi>manner,</hi> how they were taken
downe; and for the <hi>Liturgie</hi> it selfe, on what occasion
it was changed.</p>
                  <p>First for the time, the Bishop tels us in his letter,
that they <hi>stood a yeare or two in King Edwards time:</hi>
Now you enlarge the time, to <hi>foure yeeres,</hi> as the
D<hi rend="sup">r</hi>. doth: saying<note n="c" place="margin">pag. 88.</note> 
                     <hi>they stood three or foure yeeres before
the Kings declaration;</hi> but in the same you tell us also,
that they <hi>stood not one compleat yeere,</hi> before <hi>the godly
consideration of the people</hi> (that is, as you expound your
selfe, the <hi>irregular forwardnesse</hi> of the people) <hi>had
taken them to taske.</hi> That they stood foure yeeres at
the least, the Doctor proves by an historicall deducti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
out of the stories of those times.<note n="d" place="margin">Coal f<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

                        </gap>om the Altar. <hi>p.</hi> 28, 29.</note> In which it
doth appeare that An. 1547. the <hi>Act of Parliament</hi>
                     <pb n="103" facs="tcp:4200:68"/>
was passe, wherein it was intituled the <hi>Sacrament of
the Altar:</hi> that An. 1548. the <hi>Common-prayer booke</hi>
was confirmed, although not published till the next,
then neere at hand, which was 1549. where the word
<hi>Altar</hi> is oft used, <hi>everywhere,</hi> or <hi>almost everywhere,</hi>
you know not which. That in the said yeere 1549. an
Order came to B<hi rend="sup">p</hi>. <hi>Bonner</hi> from the Lords of the
Councell, for abrogating <hi>private Masses,</hi> wherein it
was appointed that the holy blessed Communion be
ministred at the high Altar of the Church, and in no
other place of the same, <hi>Act. and Mon. part. 2. p.</hi> 662.
And finally, that in the fourth yeere of his raigne
(Novemb. 24. 1550) there came an Order from the
Councell to B<hi rend="sup">p</hi>. <hi>Ridley,</hi> (who succeeded <hi>Bonner</hi>) for
taking downe the Altars in his Dioces. p. 699. which

also sent from the Lords of the Councell, the fore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>named
B<hi rend="sup">p</hi>. of <hi>London,</hi> as the storie tels us, did hold
his <hi>Visitation,</hi> 
                     <q>wherein he did exhort those
Churches in his diocess, wherein the <hi>Altars</hi> did re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maine,
to conforme themselves unto those other
Churches which had taken them downe, and had
set up in stead of the multitude of their <hi>Altars</hi> one
decent <hi>Table</hi> in every Church.</q> Which exhortation,
as it seemeth, did prevaile so farre, that not long after
the <hi>Altars</hi> were taken downe, and <hi>Tables</hi> set up in
the Churches. That it was done thus in all other
dioceses, the Doctor finds not any where, but in the
letter to the Vicar: where it is said indeed, and no
more but said, that <hi>on the Orders of breaking downe</hi>
Altars, <hi>all dioceses did agree upon receiving Tables;</hi> all
dioceses <hi>aswell as that of London,</hi> as your corrupted
Copie hath it. For proofe of which, as you have
<pb n="104" facs="tcp:4200:69"/>
falsified the Bishops letters to bring it in; so you have
falsified the Acts and Monuments to make it good.
For where the words run on in a continued stile or
sense; you stop them where you list, to make them
speake that, which they never meant. The words run
thus in the <hi>Edition</hi>

                        <hi>Furthermore</hi> in the yeere next follow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing,
1550. other Letters likewise were sent for the

Here, say you,<note n="g" place="margin">pag. 128.</note> the full point should be, at <hi>setting up
the Table instead of the same.</hi> And then a new period to
begin with the following words, <hi>unto Nicholas Ridley,</hi>
&amp;c. By this device you thinke to have wonne the day,
not seeing that by this fine fancy, you have made
non-sence of the first period, and very strange <hi>English</hi>
in the last. For let the first be thus; <q>
                        <hi>Furthermore in

                        <hi>It were well then</hi> (saith he) that it might

<hi>Tables,</hi> according to the first institution of <hi>Christ,</hi>
to take away the false perswasion of the people,

For as long as the <hi>Altars</hi> remaine, both the igno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rant
<hi>people,</hi> and the ignorant and evill perswaded
<hi>Priest,</hi> will dreame alwaies of <hi>sacrifice.</hi>
                     </q> By which
it is apparent, that whatsoever had beene done by

                     <hi rend="sup">p</hi>. <hi>Ridley,</hi> all other dioceses, <hi>aswell as that of London,</hi>
did not agree on putting downe of <hi>Altars,</hi> and setting
up of <hi>Tables,</hi> as you rashly say. Nor is it likely that
the <hi>Altars</hi> generally were taken downe throughout
the Kingdome, untill the second <hi>Liturgie</hi> was confir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med
by <hi>Parliament,</hi> which was not till the yeere 1552

                  <p>Next for the manner how they were taken downe,

<pb n="107" facs="tcp:4200:70"/>
                     <hi>because the people being scandalized herewith in Country
Churches, first it seemes beat them downe</hi> de facto; <hi>and

would beat them downe at home, in their owne
Countries, because the people (which they never
heard of) were scandalized herewith in <hi>England.</hi>
Faith tell mee, doe you not thinke them very <hi>honest
fellowes,</hi> and that a dozen of <hi>Grantham</hi> Ale were well
bestowed upon them, by the <hi>Alderman</hi> there, for do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
such an excellent piece of service, to promote the
cause? I need not tell you more of this trim inven<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion,
which made you falsifie the letter, with a long
<hi>Parenthesis, as here the King,</hi> &amp;c. to bring in this Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>geant.
Onely I shall advise you as a speciall friend, to
take a care you see it entred in the next edition of the
<hi>Acts and Monuments,</hi> which every time it comes into
the world, growes bigger, by such hands as yours;
and will, no doubt, in time grow great, and be<note n="p" place="margin">Pellibus exiguis arcta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tur Livius in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gens. <hi>Mart.</hi>

                  </p>
                  <p>Well then, the <hi>Altars</hi> in the Church of <hi>England</hi>
being thus beaten downe by the <hi>high-Germanes,</hi> what
did the <hi>English</hi> doe themselves? No doubt but they
did beat them downe too; and so they did: the one,
in your imagination onely, that dainty forge of new
devices; the other in very deed, <hi>de facto.</hi> And then
the King came after with his <hi>bottle and bag,</hi> to learne
of such good teachers what he was to doe in the case
<hi>de jure.</hi> First beaten downe <hi>de facto,</hi> then put downe
<hi>de jure:</hi> first by the people, after by the King; who
as the Doctor told you in his <hi>Coale from the Altar,
could not but come too late to carry any stroake at all in so
great businesse,</hi> which they had done before he came.
<pb n="108" facs="tcp:4200:71"/>
I warrant you, the King, being young, could not con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taine
himselfe within doores, but must needs runne to
see the sport, when hee heard them at it: and being
come, thanked his good people for their paines, and
so sent them home. But that your thoughts were ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken
up amongst the <hi>Germans,</hi> you should have told
your storie thus: <hi>viz.</hi> That first the people beat down
some <hi>de facto,</hi> and then the King much taken with the
example, put downe the rest <hi>de jure,</hi> and by publick
order. Yet had you told it thus, the Doctor possibly
might have questioned you for the relation: desiring
you, as formerly, to tell where you find it: either that
they were <hi>beaten downe,</hi> or <hi>beaten downe</hi> de facto <hi>by the
common people.</hi> That they<note n="q" place="margin">Acts and Mon. part. 2. p. 699.</note> 
                     <hi>were taken downe in the
most part of the Churches of this Realme,</hi> the Kings let<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters
tell us: but <hi>taking downe</hi> implies an orderly pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceeding;
<hi>beating downe,</hi> hath none. And the Kings
letters say withall, that they were taken downe on
<hi>good and godly considerations:</hi> which as the Doctor
thinks,<note n="r" place="margin">Coal from the Altar, <hi>p.</hi> 41.</note> 
                     <hi>implyes some order and authority from them
that had a power to doe it;</hi> some secret Order possibly,
from the Lord <hi>Protectour,</hi> or those that after signed
the letter, who meant to try this way how the thing
would relish, before they would appeare in it, or be
seene to act it. Or put the case, some Bishops now,
should on some grounds to them best knowne, give
way unto the Clergie of their severall Diocesses, to
place the Table Altar-wise; and then the King should
signifie to the Bishop of <hi>Lincoln,</hi> that it was come un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to
his knowledge, that in many places of the King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome
the holy table was removed to the Altar place
on certain good and godly considerations: would this
be an Argument unto future ages, that this was done
<pb n="109" facs="tcp:4200:71"/>
                     <hi>de facto</hi> by the Countrie people? Besides, why should
you think the <hi>people in most places of the Realme,</hi> were
scandalized with <hi>Altars</hi> in the Countrie Churches;
when in so many places of the Realme, they tooke up
Armes, because the <hi>Masse</hi> was taken from them.
Those enterprises which you speake of, of some cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taine
(<hi rend="sup">s</hi>) <hi>Zelots</hi> in the beginning of K. <hi>Edwards,</hi> Qu.
<hi>Maries,</hi> and Qu. <hi>Elizabeths</hi> raigne, which sometimes
you call <hi>good and godly considerations,</hi> and sometimes
the <hi>irregular forwardnesse of the people,</hi> were before
any law established: and therefore of no kin to these.
Things were now setled by a law, and by that law the
<hi>Altars</hi> were to stand as before they did. Nor durst
the people in the most part of the Churches of the
Realme have taken downe the <hi>Altars</hi> then by law
established, on any <hi>private consideration</hi> how good so<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever:
therefore I should rather think that it was done
in some places, and by authority from some Ordina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries,
such whom the Lords found fittest for the altera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion.
You cavill with the Doctor, and reckon it<note n="t" place="margin">I will give you a short tast of his faining and his failing. <hi>p.</hi> 2.</note> a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mongst
his <hi>fainings,</hi> for telling you what <hi>fine doctrine
this was for the common people;</hi> viz. this your report of
beating downe the <hi>Altars</hi> in the Country Churches:
wherein he <hi>failes,</hi> you say, because the <hi>writer onely
mentioneth it as a matter of Fact.</hi> But being it was such
a <hi>Fact,</hi> as drew on the <hi>law,</hi> the <hi>kind of law</hi> you tell us
of, which after put them downe <hi>de jure:</hi> think you to
meet with no apt schollers, that can tell how to raise
a <hi>doctrine</hi> out of the relation? <q>Our Ancestours in
K. <hi>Edwards</hi> daies were zealous of the reformation,
and beat downe those <hi>dressers;</hi> and why should we
betray Gods cause, and suffer them to be advanced?</q>
Are you assured, that none amongst your <hi>partizans</hi>
                     <pb n="110" facs="tcp:4200:72"/>
will applie it so, and after vouch you for their <hi>Author?</hi>
As for the <hi>Order</hi> of K. <hi>Edward,</hi> which you have sligh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted
off with a <hi>kind of law,</hi> (as you did that in Q<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

A most pretty quillet<note n="u" place="margin">pag. 128.</note> Here is a subtilty in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed,
a subtilty in print, as they use to say. But take
heed, <hi>nihil odiosius est nimio acumine.</hi> You should not
spend too many of your nice distinctions upon Kings
and Princes.</p>
                  <p>Now for the <hi>alteration</hi> of the <hi>Liturgie,</hi> which did
indeed draw with it a full and finall alteration in the
thing now talked of: you take great paines to make it
visible unto the world, that <hi>Calvin</hi> had no finger in it.
It had beene happy for this Church, if hee and <hi>Beza</hi>
could have kept themselves to their meditations, and
not beene <hi>curiosi in aliena republica,</hi> as they were too
much. You say of <hi>Calvin</hi> that he was a <hi>Polypragmon</hi>
                     <note n="a" place="margin">pag. 144.</note>
and <hi>made his letters flie to all Princes in the world that
did but looke towards a Reformation:</hi> and that <hi>no man</hi>
                     <note n="b" place="margin">pag. 145.</note> 
                     <hi>conceives him to be more pragmatically zealous than
you doe, even in those Countries which cared least for him.</hi>
If so, why take you up the Bucklers for him, or thinke
hee might not stickle here, as in other places? The
Doctor drew a storie of it from his owne <hi>Epistles;</hi>
which you indeavour to refell, by making <hi>ante-dates,</hi>
or <hi>false dates</hi> unto all his letters, and unto most of all
the rest, whom you there produce. As for example:
The Letter to my Lord <hi>Protectour,</hi> you date <hi>Octo.</hi> 22.
1546. which was <hi>a yeere before K. Edward came unto
the Crowne</hi>
                     <note n="c" place="margin">Ibid.</note> as you say your selfe: what time hee

how? not by reducing the opponents to conformity,
but by incouraging them rather in their opposition:
especially by supporting <hi>Hooper</hi> then B<hi rend="sup">p</hi>. of <hi>Gloucester,</hi>
the principall leader of that faction, and very zealous
(amongst other things) against the <hi>Altar's</hi> yet re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maining,
as before I shewed. For so it followeth in
that letter, <hi>hortatus ergo sum hominem, ut Hoppero

propounded. For in another unto <hi>Bullinger</hi> dated the

<hi>Hooper was restored to his Bishoprick.</hi> Now this being
but the yeere before the alteration of the <hi>Liturgie,

than <hi>Calvin</hi> with the <hi>Duke</hi> of <hi>Somerset,</hi>
(whereof consult your author, the <hi>Acts</hi> and <hi>Mon.
par. 3. p. 147.)</hi> being so eager on the chase: it is not to
be doubted but the businesse went forwards, though
the Duke went backwards. In the relating of
which storie you flutter up and downe, and have
no consistency. You tell us pag. 147. that in <hi>the
<pb n="117" facs="tcp:4200:75"/>
first sitting of that Parliament wherein the second Li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turgie
was confirmed, he was attainted, and condemned,
and presently executed:</hi> whereas indeed hee was
attainted almost two months, and executed just a
day, before that sitting. You tell us, pag. 149.
that hee <hi>was a condemned Prisoner, looking every day
for the stroke of the Axe, when the booke was pas<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sing
the Committies</hi> (if at all any such <hi>Committie</hi>
ever was about that Booke, which I somewhat
question:) whereas the Axe had done, and the
stroke was past, before the Session.</p>
                  <p>Finally, whereas, in many places of the <hi>Bishops</hi>
letter, you call the second <hi>Liturgie,</hi> the <hi>Liturgie
of the yeere</hi> 1552. as indeed it was: you tell us here,
pag. 148. of a certaine Letter which was <hi>delive<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red
to the Duke from Calvin,</hi> An. 1551. (as most
true it was so) <hi>the Liturgie being then newly alte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red.</hi>
And so by that account, the <hi>Liturgie</hi> was al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tered,
when as the Duke of <hi>Somerset</hi> was neither
attainted, condemned, or executed, as before you
said. <hi>Is this your looking unto the storie of the times,</hi>
which you so much bragge of? But as before I
told you, however the Duke went backward, the
worke went forwards; the <hi>partie</hi> being growne
so well compacted, that it could go alone, without
any leader: especially <hi>Duke Dudley</hi> who then ru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led
the rost, having a great opinion of Bishop <hi>Hooper;</hi>
who being no friend unto the <hi>Altars</hi> of the Church
himselfe, might easily induce his Patron to promote
the cause.</p>
                  <p>Next for his tampering with the King and

not for the date, then be pleased to know, that
<hi>Calvin</hi> in that letter relates to somewhat that had

                  <p>The Doctor hereupon concludes, as before he did,
that leaving the word <hi>Altar</hi> out of the <hi>Common-prayer

were therein made, grew not from any<note n="m" place="margin">Coal, <hi>p.</hi> 40.</note> scandall
taken at the <hi>Altars</hi> by the Countrie people, but a
dislike that <hi>Calvin</hi> had conceived against the Litur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gie,
as before was said. Of any hand that <hi>Martin
Bucer</hi> had therein, more than that hee had signified
unto <hi>Calvin,</hi> the quality and condition of this
Church, and of the Liturgie thereof, the said Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctor

with a <hi>sic videtur,</hi>

                     <hi>that it was the King, the

<hi>in the point of</hi> Altars. An alteration there was
made by the King and State, though not by the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>citement
of <hi>Martin Bucer,</hi> but of <hi>Calvin</hi> rather,
that <hi>Polypragmon,</hi> as you call him.</p>
                  <p>For, that the Alteration of K. <hi>Edwards</hi> Liturgie
proceeded rather of some motions from without,
than any great dislike at home; the Doctor was indu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ced
to beleeve, the rather, because the King<note n="o" place="margin">Co<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

And secondly, because hee had observed, that in the

                     <q>Forasmuch as wee constantly beleeve, that
after the <hi>Priest</hi> hath spoken the words of consecra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion,
being at <hi>Masse,</hi> there celebrating and conse<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crating
the same; there is very really the body and
bloud of our Saviour <hi>Iesus Christ,</hi> God and man;
and that no substance of bread and wine remaineth
after, but the very selfe same body that was borne
of the <hi>Virgin Mary,</hi> and was given upon the <hi>Crosse</hi>
for our Redemption; therefore wee will have
<hi>Masse celebrated as it was in times past,</hi> without
any man communicating with the <hi>Priests,</hi> foras<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>much
as many rudely presuming unworthily to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive

many other abused termes.</q>
                  </p>
                  <p>Now to this Article of theirs, the King thus
replyed:</p>
                  <p>
                     <note n="r" place="margin">Acts and Mon. part. 2. p. 667.</note> 
                     <q>For the <hi>Masse,</hi> I assure you no small studie
nor travell hath beene spent, by all the learned
<hi>Clergie,</hi> therein, and to avoid all contention, <hi>it is
brought even to the very use as</hi> Christ <hi>left it, as the</hi>
Apostles <hi>used it, as the holy</hi> Fathers <hi>delivered it,</hi>
indeed somewhat altered from that the <hi>Popes</hi> of
<hi>Rome</hi> for their <hi>lucre</hi> brought it to. And although
yee may heare the contrary from some <hi>Popish</hi> evill
men, yet Our Majesty, which for Our Honour may
not be blemished and stained, assureth you, that
they deceive, abuse you, and blow these opinions
into your heads, to finish their owne purposes.</q>
                  </p>
                  <p>
                     <pb n="123" facs="tcp:4200:78"/>
This is the <hi>plaine song,</hi> as it passed betweene the
<hi>Rebells</hi> and the <hi>King.</hi> And now I will set down your
descant on it, in your owne words <hi>verbatim,</hi> not a tit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle
altered, that all which <hi>runne may reade,</hi> and see
how shamefully you abuse your owne dearest Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thor.</p>
                  <p>
                     <note n="s" place="margin">pag. 150, 151</note> The <hi>Rebels,</hi> in their third Article, (set on by
the <hi>Popish</hi> Priests) doe petition for their <hi>Masse</hi> (that
is, that which wee call <hi>the Canon of the Masse) and
words of consecration,</hi> as they had it <hi>before,</hi> and that the
<hi>Priests</hi> might <hi>celebrate it alone, without the communica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting
of the people.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>To this the <hi>King</hi> answers, <hi>That for the Canon of the
Masse and words of Consecration,</hi> (which is nothing
altered in the second <hi>Liturgie) they are such as were
used by</hi> Christ, <hi>the</hi> Apostles, <hi>and the ancient</hi> Fathers:
that is, They are the very <hi>words</hi> of the <hi>Institution.</hi>
But for the second part of their demand, which was
for the <hi>sacrifice</hi> of the <hi>Masse,</hi> or <hi>the Priests eating alone,</hi>
they must excuse him: <hi>For this the Popes of</hi> Rome <hi>for
their l<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                           <desc>•</desc>
                        </gap>cre added to it.</hi> So there is a cleare <hi>Answer</hi> to
both parts of the Article.</p>
                  <p>A <hi>very cleare answer,</hi> if you marke it well. The
<hi>Rebels</hi> make demand of the whole <hi>Masse, modo</hi> &amp; <hi>for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ma,</hi>
as before it had beene celebrated: you make
them speake onely of the <hi>Canon of the Masse,</hi> and
<hi>words of Consecration.</hi> The <hi>King,</hi> in his reply, makes
answer to the <hi>whole Masse,</hi> as it was commonly then
called, the whole forme and order of the <hi>Communion</hi>
in the publick Liturgie, that it was <hi>brought even to the
very use as</hi> Christ <hi>left it, the</hi> Apostles <hi>used it, and the
holy</hi> Fathers <hi>delivered it:</hi> you make him answer one<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
<pb n="124" facs="tcp:4200:79"/>
of the <hi>Canon,</hi> and words of <hi>Institution,</hi> as if that
were all. This is not to report an answer, but to make
an answer; and draw that commendation to a <hi>part</hi> of
the <hi>common Liturgie,</hi> which was intended of the
<hi>whole.</hi> And yet your Inference is farre worse than
your Report: For you have made the King to say,
that they should have a <hi>Table,</hi> and a <hi>Communion,</hi> and
the <hi>words</hi> of <hi>Consecration,</hi> as they were used by <hi>Christ,</hi>
the <hi>Apostles,</hi> and the ancient <hi>Fathers:</hi> but they
should have no <hi>Altar,</hi> nor <hi>sacrifice; for these the
Popes of Rome, for their lucre, had added to the Insti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tution.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>This, were there nothing else, would set you forth
for what you are; a man that care not what you say,
or whom you <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

                     </gap>alsifie, so you may runne away from
the present danger, though afterwards it overtakes
you, and falls farre heavier on you than before it
did.</p>
                  <p>Next, let us see what you reply to that which con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cernes
the <hi>Parliament,</hi> and the opinion which it had
of the <hi>former Liturgie,</hi> as both <hi>agreeable to Gods Word,
and the Primitive Church.</hi> And first you charge the
Doctor with borrowing<note n="t" place="margin">pag. 151</note> that passage from father
<hi>Parsons three Conversions.</hi> Whether it be in father
<hi>Parsons,</hi> the Doctor knowes not. But whether it be
or not, that comes all to one, as long as it is so delive<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red
in the Act of <hi>Parliament.</hi> Then for the <hi>Act</hi> it<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selfe,
<note n="u" place="margin">pag. 152.</note> you answer, that whereas some <hi>sensuall per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sons,

the</hi> Parish-Churches <hi>upon the establishment of the</hi> En<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>glish

the offenders against this</hi> new law, <hi>that</hi> praiers in the
<pb n="125" facs="tcp:4200:79"/>
mother-tongue <hi>is no invention of theirs, as the</hi> Priests
<hi>would make them beleeve, but the doctrine of the</hi> Word
of God, <hi>and the practice of the</hi> Primitive Church: <hi>med<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling
no farther with the</hi> Liturgie <hi>in this part of the Act,
than as it was a service in the</hi> mother-tongue.</p>
                  <p>I have been told, it was a saying of my Lord Chan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cellour
<hi>Egerton,</hi> that D<hi rend="sup">r</hi> 
                     <hi>Day,</hi> once Dean of <hi>Windsor,</hi>
had the most excellent arts of <hi>creeping out of the law,</hi>
of any man whose name was ever brought in <hi>Chan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>c<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                           <desc>•</desc>
                        </gap>ry.</hi>
That Doctor, and this <hi>Minister,</hi> are much
of the same quality; our <hi>Minister</hi> being as expert in
<hi>creeping out of an authority,</hi> as ever was that Doctor
in <hi>creeping out of the law.</hi> But yet hee creepes not so a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>way,
but a man may catch him: and catch him sure
we will for all his cunning. For if wee looke into the
Act of Parliament, wee shall easily finde, that not the
language onely, but the order, forme, and fabrick of
the divine Service before established, is said to bee
<hi>agreeable to the Word of God, and the Primitive Church,</hi>
which I desire you to observe, as it is here presented
<note n="x" place="margin">5. &amp; 6. Ed. 6. cap. 1.</note> to you.</p>
                  <p>
                     <q>Whereas (saith the Act) there hath beene a
<hi>very godly order</hi> set forth by authority of Parlia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment,
for <hi>Common prayer and administration of the
Sacraments to be used in the mother tongue,</hi> within this
Church of England, <hi>agreeable unto the Word of God,
and the Primitive Church,</hi> very comfortable to all
good people, desiring to live in <hi>christian</hi> Conver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sation,
and most profitable to the estate of this
Realme, &amp;c.</q> What thinke you, on your second
thoughts, is that so much commended by the <hi>Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liament?</hi>
either the very <hi>Order</hi> it selfe, of <hi>Common
<pb n="126" facs="tcp:4200:80"/>
prayer and administration of the Sacraments,</hi> or the be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
of it in the <hi>English</hi> tongue. It could not be the
being of it in the <hi>English</hi> tongue. For then the <hi>Ro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mish
Missall,</hi> had it beene translated word for
word, without more alteration than the language
onely, might have beene also said to <hi>be agreeable to the
Word of God, and the Primitive Church;</hi> which I am
sure you will not say. And therefore it must be the
whole <hi>forme and order,</hi> that <hi>godly order,</hi> as they call it,
of <hi>common prayer</hi> and administration of the Sacra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments,
to be used in the <hi>English tongue</hi> (take them
both together) which they so commended. Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pare
this testimony of the Parliament, with that
before given of it by the King; and see if they affirme
it of the <hi>language,</hi> or of the <hi>order</hi> of the <hi>service.</hi> The
King affirmed that it was <hi>brought unto that use as</hi>
Christ <hi>left it, the</hi> Apostles <hi>used it, and the holy</hi> Fathers
<hi>delivered it:</hi> the Parliament, that it was <hi>agreeable to
the Word of God</hi> (including <hi>Christ</hi> and the <hi>Apostles)</hi>
and to the <hi>Primitive Church,</hi> including the <hi>holy
Fathers.</hi> Nor did the Parliament alone vouchsafe
this testimonie of the first Liturgie<note n="y" place="margin">pag. 53.</note> Archbishop
<hi>Bancroft</hi> speaking of it in his Sermon preached at S.
<hi>Pauls Crosse, An.</hi> 1588. affirmes that it was publi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>shed
first <hi>with such approbation, as that it was accounted
the worke of God.</hi>

                  <p>Besides, <hi>Iohn Fox,</hi>
                     <note n="z" place="margin">Acts <hi>and</hi> Mon. part 2. p. 660.</note> whose testimony I am sure
you will not refuse, (though you corrupt him too if
hee come in your way) hath told us of the Compilers
of that Liturgie, <q>first that they were commanded by
the King to have as well an eye and respect unto the
most sincere and pure Christian religion, taught by
<pb n="127" facs="tcp:4200:80"/>
the holy Scriptures, as also to the usages of the
<hi>Primitive Church,</hi> and to draw up one convenient
and meet <hi>order,</hi> rite and fashion of <hi>Common prayer,</hi>
and <hi>Administration of the Sacraments,</hi> to be had and
used within the Realme of <hi>England,</hi> and the Domi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nions
of the fame. And then hee addes <hi>de proprio,</hi>
as his own opinion, that <hi>through the ayde of the holy
Ghost,</hi> and with one uniforme agreement, they did
conclude, set forth, and deliver to the King a booke
in <hi>English,</hi> entituled, <hi>A booke of the Common prayer,
&amp;c.</hi>
                     </q> This, as it shewes his judgement of the aforesaid
<hi>Liturgie,</hi> so doth it very fully explaine the meaning
of the <hi>Act</hi> of <hi>Parliament;</hi> and that it did not, as you
say, relate unto the language onely, but the whole
<hi>order,</hi> rite, and fashion, of the <hi>Common prayer</hi> booke.</p>
                  <p>Thus have we seene the a<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>teration of the <hi>Liturgie;</hi>
and by that alteration, a change of <hi>Altars</hi> into <hi>Tables,</hi>
for the holy Sacrament. The next inquiry to be made,
is how the <hi>Table</hi> stood, and how they called it; and
that aswell upon the taking down of <hi>Altars,</hi> An. 1550
in some places by the Kings owne Order; as on the
generall removall of them, by the second <hi>Liturgie.</hi>
First for the <hi>placing</hi> of the <hi>Table</hi> your owne Author
tels you,<note n="a" place="margin">Acts and Mon. part. 2. p. 700.</note> that on occasion <q>of taking downe the
<hi>Altars,</hi> here arose a great diversity about the
forme of the <hi>Lords b<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                              <desc>•</desc>
                           </gap>ard:</hi> some using it after the
forme of a <hi>Table,</hi> and some of an <hi>Altar.</hi> But finally
it was so ordered by the Bishop of <hi>London (Ridley)</hi>
that he appointed the forme of a <hi>right Table,</hi> to be
used in all his Diocesse: himselfe incouraging them
unto it, by breaking downe the wall standing then
by the <hi>high Altar</hi> side, in the Cathedrall of S. <hi>Paul.</hi>
                     </q>
                     <pb n="128" facs="tcp:4200:81"/>
But that it was so ordered <hi>in all other Dioceses,</hi> the
Doctor findes not any where, but in the <hi>new Edition</hi>
of the Bishops letter, which you have falsified of pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pose
to make it say so, as before was noted. Nor
did the <hi>old Edition</hi> say, that they the <hi>other Dioceses,</hi>
agreed at all upon the <hi>forme and fashion</hi> of their <hi>Ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bles;</hi>
though they agreed, as you would have it, on
the thing it self. And therefore you have now put in
these words, <hi>so soone,</hi> which tells another tale, than
before was told: as if <hi>all Dioceses</hi> having agreed as
well as <hi>London,</hi> on receiving <hi>Tables,</hi> did agree too,
but not <hi>so soone</hi> upon the <hi>fashion</hi> of their <hi>Tables.</hi> For
that it was not thus in all other places, your owne

                        <hi>pag.</hi> 48. Of the holy Table.</note> you; and to him I send you
to observe it. But <hi>this diversity,</hi>
                     <note n="c" place="margin">Ibid. p. 48.</note> say you, was <hi>set<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led
by the Rubrick, confirmed by law.</hi> What universally?
There is no question but you meane it; or to what
purpose doe you say so? Yet in another place you
tell us, that notwithstanding the said <hi>Rubrick,</hi> the
<hi>Tables</hi> stood like <hi>Altars</hi> in <hi>Cathedrall</hi> Churches; in
some of them at least, which had no priviledge, I am
sure, more than others had. For thus say you,<note n="d" place="margin">pag. 183.</note> 
                     <hi>In
some of the</hi> Cathedralls, <hi>where the</hi> steps <hi>were not
transposed in</hi> tertio <hi>of the Queene, and the wall on the
back-side of the</hi> Altar <hi>untaken downe, the</hi> Table
<hi>might stand all along, as the</hi> Altar <hi>did.</hi> If it did stand
in some, it might stand in all; and if in the <hi>Cathe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dralls,</hi>
then also in <hi>Parochiall</hi> Churches; unlesse
you shew us by what meanes they procured that
<hi>might,</hi> which could not be attained unto by any

                  <p>And this I am the rather induced to thinke, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause
that in the Statute 1 <hi>Elizab.</hi>
                     <note n="g" place="margin">1 Eliz. c. 2.</note> wherein the

be in use, as was in the Church of <hi>England</hi> by
the authority of Parliament, in the 2. of King
<hi>Edw.</hi> 6. untill other order should therein be
taken by the authority of the Queene, &amp;c.</q>
Which makes it plaine in my opinion, that in the
latter end of King <hi>Edw.</hi> the <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>

nothing altered in the point of the Churches <hi>Or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>naments,</hi>
nor consequently in the placing of the
<hi>holy Table.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Then for the <hi>name,</hi> it seemes they stood as lit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle
upon that, as upon the former. When the old
<hi>Altars</hi> stood, they called them <hi>Tables;</hi> and when
the <hi>Tables</hi> were set up, they called them <hi>Altars.</hi>
Your Author<note n="h" place="margin">Acts and Mon. part 2.
p. 700.</note> could have told you at the first,
<q>that the <hi>book of Common prayer</hi> calleth the thing
<pb n="130" facs="tcp:4200:82"/>
whereupon the Lords Supper is ministred, in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>differently
a <hi>Table,</hi> an <hi>Altar,</hi> or the <hi>Lords boord,</hi>
without prescription of any forme thereof, ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
of a <hi>Table,</hi> or of an <hi>Altar.</hi> For as it calleth
it an <hi>Altar,</hi> whereupon the Lords Supper is
ministred, a <hi>Table,</hi> and the <hi>Lords boorde;</hi> so it
calleth the <hi>Table</hi> where the holy Communion
is distributed with laud and thankesgiving unto
the Lord, an <hi>Altar;</hi> for that there is offered the
same sacrifice of praise and thankesgiving.</q> So
when the <hi>Liturgie</hi> was altered, &amp; the word <hi>Altar</hi>
quite left out; they spared not, as occasion was, to
call the <hi>holy table</hi> by the name of <hi>Altar.</hi> The bles<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed
Sacrament it selfe, they thought no sacriledge
to intitle by the name of <hi>Sacrament of the Altar:</hi>
so did the <hi>Martyrs,</hi> some of them, in Qu. <hi>Maries</hi>
time; and the whole body of the State, in Parlia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment,

<hi>Latimer</hi> speakes positively, that <hi>it may be called an

have slipped aside that passage, and made him cast
the common calling of it so,<note n="i" place="margin">Holy table, p. 97.</note> upon the <hi>Doctors,

The <hi>Rubrick</hi> was no other then, than we finde it

                     </gap>, which did relate to <hi>Christ</hi> our Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viour,
as types of that most perfect <hi>expiatory sacrifice,</hi>
which in the fulnesse of time hee was to offer on the
Crosse, for the sin of man. Which practice of the <hi>Iewes,</hi>
abstracted from the end to which by God it was in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tended,
was generally in use also with the <hi>Gentiles:</hi>
whether delivered to them by tradition from their
predecessours, or that it was dying sparke of the light
of Nature, or that they tooke it from the <hi>Iewes,</hi> whose
Apes they were, needs not now be questioned. Suffice
it, that however they could not reach the height of
the true religion, nor knew not the intent of those
frequent <hi>sacrifices</hi> which were imposed upon the
<pb n="5" facs="tcp:4200:86"/>
                     <hi>Iewes;</hi> yet they would come as neare it, as they could.
And therefore as they had their <hi>sacrifices,</hi> so would
they also have their <hi>Temples,</hi> their <hi>Priests,</hi> and <hi>Altars:</hi>
places selected for divine worship, and Ministers ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pointed
for those places, and <hi>Altars</hi> upon which to
minister, being of like antiquitie. The severall gods
in <hi>Rome,</hi> the <hi>Temples</hi> unto them belonging, the <hi>Altars</hi>
in those Temples, and Colledges of <hi>Priests</hi> attending
on those <hi>Altars,</hi> are things so generally knowne; that
it were losse of time to insist upon them. The like
may also be observed in all other places, and of all <hi>I<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dols</hi>
whatsoever. For whatsoever the <hi>Idol</hi> represen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted,
and by whomsoever it was worshipped, if it were
once set up and honoured as a Deitie, it drew along
with it all those necessary attendants, which were by
God himselfe thought fit to wait upon the true reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gion.
The <hi>Groves and high places,</hi> the <hi>Priests and Al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tars</hi>
destinated to the service of that foule <hi>Idol Baal,</hi>
mentioned in the holy Scriptures, were proofe enough

a <hi>Sacrifice</hi> in fact; and so by consequence, <hi>a Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crifice</hi>
in the commemorations, or upon the <hi>Post-fact.</hi>
A <hi>Sacrifice</hi> there was among the <hi>Iewes,</hi> shewing forth
<hi>Christs</hi> death unto them, before his comming in the
flesh: a <hi>Sacrifice</hi> there must bee amongst the <hi>Christi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans,</hi>
to shew <hi>forth the Lords death till he</hi> come in judge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment.
And if a <hi>Sacrifice</hi> must bee, there must be also

without a <hi>Priest,</hi> and <hi>Altar,</hi> there can bee no sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crifice:
Yet so that the precedent sacrifice was of a

both the <hi>Priest</hi> and <hi>Altar</hi> from those before: a bloudy
sacrifice then, an unbloudy, now; a <hi>Priest</hi> derived
from <hi>Aaron</hi> then, from <hi>Melchisedech,</hi> now; an <hi>Altar</hi>

take those that follow by way of Commentary<note n="s" place="margin">
                        <hi>Ib.</hi> v. 26.</note>: <hi>For

unto them, but such as was from them to bee derived
upon others, and by them communicated unto o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers,
for the instruction of Gods people, and the per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formance
of his service. Though the <hi>Apostles</hi> at that
time might represent the Church of <hi>Christ,</hi> and every

private men, to intermeddle in the <hi>sacrifice,</hi> but
unto the <hi>Apostles</hi> onely, and their successours in the

                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>fe, that we should offer <gap reason="foreign">

                     </gap>,
this our commemoration for a Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crifice: The
second, that withall wee should offer to
him the <hi>sacrifice of praise &amp; thanksgiving,</hi> which is the
reasonable Sacrifice of a Christian man, and to him
<pb n="24" facs="tcp:4200:96"/>
most acceptable. Finally, he joynes both these toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
in the Conclusion of that Book, and therein doth

<hi>&amp;c.</hi> 
                     <q>Therefore,
saith he, we <hi>sacrifice,</hi> &amp; offer as it were with Incense,
the <hi>memory</hi> of that great <hi>Sacrifice,</hi> celebrating the
same according to the <hi>mysteries</hi> by him given unto
us, and<note n="q" place="margin">
                           <gap reason="foreign">

                           </gap>.</note> giving thankes to him for our salvation;
with godly hymnes and prayers to the Lord our
God; as also offering to him our whole selves, both
soule and body, and to his high Priest, which is the
Word.</q> See here, <hi>Eusebius</hi> doth not call it onely the
memorie or <hi>commemoration</hi> of <hi>Christs Sacrifice;</hi> but
makes the very memory or commemoration, in, and
of it selfe, to bee a <hi>Sacrifice</hi> which <hi>instar omnium,</hi> for,
and in the place of all other Sacrifices, wee are to
offer to our God, and offer it with a <gap reason="foreign">

                     </gap>, the In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cense
of our prayers and prayses.</p>
                  <p>This was the doctrine of the Church in <hi>Eusebius</hi>
time, touching the Sacrament of the body and blood
of our blessed Saviour. Of any <hi>expiatorie Sacrifice,</hi> of
any offering up of <hi>Christ</hi> for the quick and dead, more
than what had beene done by him once, and once for
all, those blessed Ages never dream't. And howsoever
some of the ancient Fathers did amplifie with the choi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cest
of their <hi>Rhetorick</hi> the dignity and nature of this
holy <hi>Sacrament,</hi> the better to inflame the people with
a lively zeale, at their partaking of the same: yet they
meant nothing lesse, than to give any opportunity to
the future Ages of making that an <hi>expiatorie Sacrifice,</hi>
which they did onely teach to bee <hi>Commemorative,</hi> or
<hi>representative</hi> of our Saviours passion. A <hi>Sacrifice</hi> they
<pb n="25" facs="tcp:4200:96"/>
did confesse it, <hi>Altars</hi> and <hi>Priests</hi> they did allow of, as
necessary thereunto; not thinking fit to change those
terms, which had bin recommended to them from pure
antiquitie. Those blessed spirits were not <gap reason="foreign">
                        <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                     </gap>,
contentious about words and formes of speech, in
which there was not manifest impiety. The Supper of
the Lord, they called sometimes a <hi>Sacrifice,</hi> and
sometimes a memoriall of the Sacrifice, <gap reason="foreign">

still as well the Office of Priesthood, as the name of
<hi>Priest,</hi> must needs admit of <hi>Altars,</hi> and of <hi>Sacrifices,</hi> as
things peculiar to the <hi>Priesthood:</hi> But not to trust so
great a matter to your rules of <hi>Logicke,</hi> wee will next
see, what is the judgement of the Church in the point
of <hi>Sacrifice.</hi> Two wayes there are by which the Church
declares her selfe in the present businesse: First, posi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tively
in the Booke of Articles, and that of Homilies;
and practically in the Booke of Common prayers.
First, in the <hi>Articles;</hi> 
                     <q>
                        <note n="e" place="margin">Art. 31.</note> The offering of <hi>Christ</hi> once
made, is that perfect redemption, propitiation, and
satisfaction for all the sinnes of the whole world,
both originall and actuall, and there is no other sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tisfaction
for sinne, but that alone.</q> This <hi>Sacrifice</hi> or
<hi>oblation</hi> once for ever made, and never more to bee
repeated, was by our <hi>Saviours</hi> owne appointment to
bee commemorated and represented to us, for the
better quickning of our faith: whereof if there be no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing
said in the Booke of <hi>Articles,</hi> it is because the
Articles related chiefly unto points in Controversie:
but in the Booke of <hi>Homilies,</hi> which doe relate unto
the <hi>Articles,</hi> as confirmed in them, and are (though not
dogmaticall, but rather popular discourses) a Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment,
<pb n="29" facs="tcp:4200:98"/>
as it were, on those points of doctrine, which
are determined of elsewhere:<note n="f" place="margin">Hom. of the Sacrament, part. 2. p. 197.</note> wee finde it thus:
<q>That the great love of our Saviour <hi>Christ</hi> to man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kinde
doth not only appeare, in that deare-bought
benefit of our redemption, and satisfaction by his
death and passion, but also in that he hath so kindly
provided that the same most mercifull work might
bee had in continuall <hi>remembrance.</hi> Amongst the
which meanes is the publick celebration of the <hi>me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>morie</hi>

our Saviour having ordained and established the <hi>re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>membrance</hi>
of his great mercie expressed in his pas<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sion,
in the <hi>Institution</hi> of his heavenly Supper.</q>
Here is a <hi>commemoration</hi> of that blessed <hi>Sacrifice</hi>
which <hi>Christ</hi> once offered, a publick celebration of the
<hi>memorie</hi> thereof, and a continuall <hi>remembrance</hi> of it
by himselfe ordained. Which if it seeme not full
enough for the <hi>Commemorative sacrifice,</hi> in the Church
observed, the <hi>Homilie</hi>

                     </note> will tell us further: <q>that
<hi>this Lords supper is in such wise to be done and mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stred,
as our Lord and Saviour did, and commanded it
to be done, as his holy Apostles used it, and the good Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers
in the Primitive Church frequented it.</hi>
                     </q> So that
what ever hath beene proved to bee the purpose of
the <hi>Institution,</hi> the practise of the holy <hi>Apostles,</hi> and

the <hi>sacrifices</hi> which we reade of in the scripture, were
necessarily to be destroied. But presently you change
his termes, and for his <hi>sacrifices in the Scripture,</hi> put

sacrifice of the <hi>Altar,</hi> it helpes but little to your pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pose:
the Doctour no where saying that hee had it
from them. And if they call it not <hi>interminis,</hi> the <hi>sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crifice</hi>
of the <hi>Altar,</hi> they call it so at least <hi>ex consequen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>te,</hi>
when they entitle the Lords Supper by the name
of <hi>Sacrifice,</hi> and such a <hi>sacrifice</hi> as is to bee offred on a

Of what I pray you? Not of the <hi>things professed in the

lawfull to the <hi>Priests</hi> to be partakers of the doctrine of
our Lord and Saviour. Why did the Apostles preach
unto the <hi>Iewes,</hi> in case it were not lawfull for them to

in all his stile. But his said affectation doth appeare
in nothing here, save that hee useth the word <hi>Ara,</hi>
when as, in that proprietie of speech which generally
was observed in Christian Writers, hee should have
used the word <hi>Altare.</hi> Nor need you take such paines
to adde some reason for your opinion, that there by

must it here be <hi>ara Dei,</hi> at <hi>Gods hillock,</hi> or (as your
selfe translate it after) the <hi>rising of Almighty God?</hi>
But herein you mistake the point extremely, as in all
things else: The proper signification of the word, is
<hi>Altar,</hi> as you may see in <hi>Varro de lingua latina, lib.</hi> 5. and
<hi>Isidore de Origin. lib. 15. c.</hi> 4. used for a <hi>banke</hi> or <hi>hillock</hi>
by a Metaphor onely, as in that <hi>de Pallio.</hi> So that to
call the Table <hi>ara,</hi> onely because it was a kinde of <hi>ri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sing</hi>
above the pavement; and to call banks or risings
<hi>aras,</hi> because of that similitude they had to <hi>Altars:</hi>
were to runne round <hi>in circulo,</hi> and borrow Meta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phors
from <hi>metaphors, ad infinitum.</hi> And yet you take
away this Metaphor also, by telling us immediately,
<pb n="62" facs="tcp:4200:115"/>
that <hi>Tertullian</hi> by alluding to the reservations from
the <hi>Heathen Altars,</hi> doth call the Communion-Table
<hi>Ara Dei,</hi> Gods Altar. Doth he so? That's well. You
give as much in this, as one needs desire, that were not

                  <p>Thus also was it with the Christians in the <hi>Primi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tive</hi>
times, compelled too often, to hold their mee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tings
and assemblies, as Bishop <hi>Iewell</hi> rightly notes it,
in <hi>vacant places,</hi> in <hi>woods and forrests, and caves under
the ground.</hi> And after as by sufferance or by speciall
favour, they were permitted to build them <hi>Oratories,</hi>
for the publick use: they neither built them in such
sumptuous manner, as might have drawne upon them
the Common envie of the <hi>Gentiles;</hi> or furnished them
in such rich sort as might have been a burden to them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves
in their poore estate. But when the Church
was setled, and had got the better hand of her cruell
enemies; <hi>Temples</hi> in all parts were erected: the whole
world seeming to exult that opportunity was given to
poure out its treasures to so good a purpose. To these
<pb n="72" facs="tcp:4200:120"/>
three periods, we may reduce what ever is to be ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>served
in the present businesse. Touching the first, it
is that we are told by <hi>Platina,</hi>
                     <note n="p" place="margin">in vit. Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>listi.</note> 
                     <hi>Occulta esse omnia, &amp;
sacella potius at que etiam abdita, &amp; plerumque subter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ranea.</hi>
Churches they had, places designed and set
apart for their holy exercises; but poore and meane,
and almost hidden from mens eyes, agreeable unto
the present state in the which they were. However
being destinate to those holy uses, they were not suffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red
to bee defiled and abused by prophane imploy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments.
That of <hi>S. Paul,</hi>
                     <note n="q" place="margin">1. Cor. 11<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> 22</note> 
                     <hi>Have yee not Houses to eate
and drinke in,</hi> discovers manifestly that there was a
difference to be made between house and house, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween
Gods house and mans, the places of religious
and civill meetings. Now as there was a difference
between house and house; so in the selfe same house,
there was a difference between place and place: that
which was separated for the <hi>Priest</hi> and the <hi>holy Sacra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment,</hi>
not being to bee pressed into by the Common
people. And of the people there were some that
might approch more neere to the holy places, than
the others could: which is a thing so knowne, that
no man which pretends to learning did ever doubt it.
The second period was when the Church had rest,
what times the <hi>Christians</hi> set themselves to build them
Churches: Churches, I meane, avowed for such, and
publickly frequented for religious meetings, visible as
well unto the <hi>Gentiles</hi> as unto the <hi>faithfull,</hi> and well
knowne to be so. The first observed by <hi>Polydor Virgil,</hi>

<hi>Pius</hi> the first, <hi>An.</hi> 150. or thereabouts, by the name of
<hi>S. Prudentianae.</hi> Another Church (but somewhat af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
<pb n="73" facs="tcp:4200:120"/>
this) doth <hi>Platina</hi> remember<note n="s" place="margin">in vita Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lixti.</note> to have been built
by Pope <hi>Calixtus, in regione Transtyberina,</hi> and dedica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted
by the name of the <hi>Blessed Virgin.</hi> But for a gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rall
view of their works of this kind, we may best take
it from <hi>Eusebius,</hi>
                     <note n="t" place="margin">Hist. Eccl. lib. 8. cap. <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

                        </gap>.</note> who speaking of the calme that was
between the ninth and tenth persecutions, informes
us of the <hi>Christians,</hi> that not content with those <hi>small
Churches which before they had,</hi> they built them <hi>fairer,</hi>
and <hi>more large,</hi> in every citie. But take his owne
words with you for your more assurance. <gap reason="foreign">
                        <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                     </gap>.
Where you may also see, that they had Churches
<gap reason="foreign">
                        <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                     </gap>, as before hee cals them) in the former
times, but <hi>meane</hi> and <hi>small,</hi> agreeable unto those mise<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rable
and calamitous dayes. Nor was it long before
those Churches built so lately,<note n="u" place="margin">Ibid. cap. 2</note> were all againe demo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lished
by <hi>Dioclesian;</hi> and so continued till the time of
the Emperour <hi>Constantine:</hi> what time being raised
more beautifully, than before they had beene; they
were set out and furnished with all costly furnitures.
So that when <hi>Iulian</hi> was in state, who next but one
succeeded <hi>Constantine</hi> in the <hi>Roman</hi> empire, and that
the treasures of the Church were made a pray unto
the spoiler: <hi>Felix</hi> the <hi>Proconsul</hi>
                     <note n="x" place="margin">Theodor. hist. eccl. l. 3. c. 11.</note> could not chuse

                     </gap>, behold in what rich
utensiles they doe administer to the Sonne of <hi>Marie.</hi>
Nor was it ever thought till now, in these later dayes,
that God created such and so many glorious things, to
be served only with the basest.</p>
                  <p>This ground-work laied, we may the better see
what wee have to say to those objections, which are
<pb n="74" facs="tcp:4200:121"/>

times, to prove that in those early daies of Christi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>anity
there were no Churches. And this I will the
rather do, because the Authors which you have pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duced
against the being of Altars in the Christians
Churches, conclude aswell, that then they had no <hi>Churches</hi> for religious uses: which being examined in
this place, will more cleerely manifest what kinde of
Altars, and what kinde of Churches, were then enqui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red
of by the <hi>Gentiles,</hi> and in what sence the having
of them was denied by the Christian writers. Now
they that gave the hint unto this surmise, lived either
in the heat of persecution, when as the faithfull were
dispersed, and neither durst or could be suffered to
meet in publick: or else considering that their Chur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ches
were but mean and poore, they did not use to
call them <hi>Temples;</hi> as did the <hi>Gentiles</hi> those magnifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cent
and stately structures, which had been consecra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted
to their Idols. When therefore they were cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lenged
by the <hi>Gentiles</hi> to render an accompt of their
religion; and were demanded why they had no <hi>Al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tars:</hi>
they were interrogated also why they had no
<hi>Churches.</hi> Not any of those Authors which you have
produced, but speak of one as well as the other: the
objection being made of both, and the answere unto
both set down accordingly. <hi>Origen</hi> mentions <gap reason="foreign">

therefore cut <hi>Minutius</hi> off at <hi>cur nullas aras,</hi> not suf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fering

<note n="b" place="margin">p. 156.</note> why they (the Christians) built no Altars, <hi>venerati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>onis

when as the question was not why they had no
<hi>Altars</hi> to officiate on; but why they had no <hi>Churches</hi>
to officiate in. Is this faire dealing think you, in a

                  <p>Then for the Answers to these Cavils, in case they

                     <note n="c" place="margin">ibid.</note> as you
please to say in the case of <hi>Altars:</hi> then will it follow
thereupon, not only that they had no Churches, but
that they ought to have none neither. You grant your

<hi>time;</hi> and <hi>Churches</hi> you must also grant, because you

13. and also in his book de <hi>Corona militis,</hi> which makes
it plain, that whereas <hi>Origen</hi> and <hi>Minutius Felix</hi> lived
both after him, and yet reply unto the <hi>Quaere</hi> of the
Gentiles, that they had neither <hi>Temples,</hi> nor <hi>Altars:</hi>
it must be understood, not <hi>absolutely and simply,</hi> as you
simply say, as if they had no <hi>Churches,</hi> or no <hi>Altars</hi> in
them; but with relation to those <hi>Temples,</hi> and those
<hi>Altars,</hi> which were so honoured by the Gentiles.
The like is also to bee said unto <hi>Arnobius,</hi> who living
in those very times which <hi>Eusebius</hi> speaks of, wherein

                     <hi>Churches</hi> they had for sacred and religious meetings,
but no such stately and magnificent structures as were
erected by the <hi>Gentiles,</hi> to be the locall habitation of
their severall Idols. And they had <hi>Altars</hi> too for
that <hi>mysticall Sacrifice,</hi> which had beene constantly
continued in the Church of God; but no such <hi>Altars</hi>
as the <hi>Gentiles</hi> had, and enquired after, which were
for bloody sacrifices of Sheep and Oxen. And this
you might have seen in <hi>Arnobius</hi> also, but that you use
to wink when you meet with any thing you would not
willingly observe. For presently on this, <hi>quod non
Altaria fabricemus, non ar as,</hi> he addes these words, <hi>non
caesorum sanguinem animantium demus:</hi> which cleere<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
shewes what <hi>Altars</hi> they were said to want by the
Inquisitors.</p>
                  <p>Thus having found that in the primitive times the
Christians had their Churches, and in them their Al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tars,
our next iuquirie must be this, how, and in what
particular place those <hi>Altars</hi> were disposed of in the
<hi>Churches.</hi> For that they had some proper and pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culiar
place, is not a matter to be doubted. Not that
I think the <hi>Altars</hi> were so fixed at first, that there was
no removing of them if occasion was; but that there
was some certain place allotted to them, which was
reserved for the <hi>Priest,</hi> and the Administration of the
<hi>Eucharist:</hi> out of which place they were not to bee
moved, unlesse they were quite moved out of the
Church, as sometimes it hapned. For that they were
not fixed at first may be well collected from the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dition
of the Church, which was then still in moti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on,
and unsetled, the winds of persecution beating as
they did, so fierce upon it. Nor were the <hi>Altars</hi> only
moveable in those first daies, but also portable: and
<pb n="77" facs="tcp:4200:122"/>
purposely made moveable, that they might be porta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble,
according to the qualitie of the times. And if we
may relie upon <hi>Gabriel Biel,</hi> as in this case I think wee
may, he tels us of a Table, or Altar, (<hi>Altare ligneum</hi> in
his language)<note n="f" place="margin">v. Hospi. de orig. <hi>Altar</hi> cap. 6.</note> whereat the Popes of <hi>Rome</hi> did use to
celebrate the Sacrament: which was removed by the
Priests from place to place, <hi>ubicunque episcopus Ro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manus
latuerit,</hi> where ever the then <hi>Roman</hi> Bishops
did retire themselves in times of danger. Then for
the situation of them, whether towards the East, or
West, or any other part of the heavenly bodies, if
<hi>Walafridus Strabo</hi> may be credited; there was no cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taintie
thereof in the said times neither: the <hi>Altars</hi>
or <hi>Communion Tables</hi> being sometimes disposed of<note n="g" place="margin">de rebus Eccles. cap. 4.</note> in
<hi>diversas plagas,</hi> East, West, North, or South; and that
as there he tels us, <hi>propter aliquam locorum opportuni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tatem,</hi>
according to the qualitie and conveniencie of
the place it selfe. Indeed it was not possible, as the
times then were, that it should be otherwise. For
holding their assemblies, as before we told you, in
<hi>private houses,</hi> in <hi>dennes,</hi> and <hi>cavernes under ground,</hi>
they were to make a vertue of necessity, and suit them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves
according to the qualitie of the place, consi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dering
that they could not suit the place to their own
desires. But this held only for a time: no longer than
the faithfull were in those extremities, and put unto
their shifts, as wee use to say. For after when they
were permitted, either on sufferance, or by speciall fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vour,
to fit their Churches to their minds, they con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trived
them so, that in their prayers and addresse to
Almightie God, they turned themselves unto the
East. The Author of the Questions and Answeres <hi>ad

the Sunne: for which there was no other ground, but
that they turned unto the East in the times of prayer.
<hi>Inde suspicio quod innotuerit nos ad Orientis regionem
precari,</hi> as he there informs us. Which being so, it is not
to be thought but that the Churches were contrived
and built accordingly, fit to the posture of the people
in the times of prayer. Not that they were not built in
any place, at any time, in any other form or fashion, but
that it was thus generally, and for the most part, <gap reason="foreign">
                        <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                     </gap>,
in all parts of Christendome, from those times
downwards. And so it is resolved by<note n="i" place="margin">de rebus Eccl. Cap. 4.</note>

                  </p>
                  <p>For further proofe of which, let us but look upon
the formes of our antient Churches, and wee shall
finde that generally they are built in one uniforme
fashion: which fashion questionlesse was borrowed
from the pattern of the first Churches erected in the
primitive times. <hi>Baronius</hi> tels us of some Churches<note n="k" place="margin">Baron. Ann. Anno. 57.</note> in

nothing in the forme, either for situation or di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stinction,

Of these the greater was called <gap reason="foreign">

<hi>Paulinus</hi> hath it, to place the <hi>Quire</hi> or <hi>Chancell</hi> in the

had their <hi>Auditorium,</hi> their place for reading of the
<hi>Scripture,</hi> and so much of the publick Offices, as might
be heard by those whom they called <hi>Catechumeni,</hi> that
were instructed in the faith, and not as yet admitted

which was the Sacrament of the bodie and

not took up in the latter times, but such as
may plead strongly for as much antiquitie as any other
custome in the Church besides; and in the which
they were directed as well by Gods command, as by
naturall reason. For in the <hi>Taberna<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

part of the <hi>Iewish</hi> ceremonie, which was the ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>piating

that there should be a proper and selected<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> place, and
that the same should be secluded from all other use:

                     <hi>Numerianus,</hi> one of the

This is but small amends, save that you let us ther<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in

one way, and the continuall <hi>practice</hi> of the <hi>Church</hi> an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>other

the second <hi>Liturgie,</hi> the appointing of the place for

and as it seemeth by this <hi>Rubrick,</hi> the holy Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crament
was to be there administred, where he so ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pointed.
Whether it hath been practised accordingly,
I cannot positively say; but if at all, it was <hi>aut raro aut

<hi>Order</hi> might as much take off the opinion of inherent
sanctitie (if that were then the matter questioned,) as
the execution. Which were it so, the reason of the
law being ceased, the law ceaseth also. But this I
onely offer as a Consideration, and no more than so.</p>
                  <p>Then for the 82. <hi>Canon,</hi> there it is said, <q>that in the

that the <hi>Agenda</hi> of Pope <hi>Gregorie,</hi> and the said <hi>S. Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stin,</hi>
were celebrated by the Priest of the place every
<hi>Sabbath day</hi> (as you meane <hi>Sabbath day,</hi> and would

onely every <hi>Saturday, per omne Sabbatum.</hi> It had been
very fairely done, had you expressed your Authors

as you ought to doe, speaking in <hi>English</hi> to the

with an Argument, to prove that the <hi>Lords day</hi>
was called the <hi>Sabbath,</hi> and so reckoned in the time of

have made it. Last of all for your strong conclusion,
that it is <hi>utterly impossible, that no Church of the English
nation should imitate herein her first Metropolis:</hi> when
you have proved that the said Church there mentio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned,

Meane time the most that you have got, (besides the
sport that you have made) is<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> that the <hi>Altar</hi> in a private

Church not being finished when <hi>S. Austin</hi> died, was
not compleatly finished, neither, when <hi>Bede</hi> wrot the

                     <hi>the Table at Communion time, having a faire white
linnen cloath upon it, shall stand in the body of the Church,
or in the Chancell, where morning and evening prayer
be appointed to be said.</hi> So saith the <hi>Rubrick;</hi> and for
the former part thereof, there is not any thing that
can serve for your present purpose. The Table, in
Communion time, doth stand <hi>in the Chancell:</hi> though
it stand <hi>Altar-wise,</hi> close along the wall: and in the
<hi>Chancell</hi> too, <hi>i. e.</hi> in the most eminent part of it. The
writer of the letter saw this well enough: and to
avoyd the consequence could finde no better shift up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on

was done accordingly. For in the<note n="c" place="margin">Coal. p. 76.</note> letter to the <hi>Vicar</hi>
instead of <hi>in the body of the Church,</hi> or <hi>in the Chancell,</hi>
we had it, in the <hi>body of the Church,</hi> or <hi>of the Chancell:</hi>
as if the <hi>Rubrick</hi> did appoint, that in those places

the <hi>Table</hi> should bee placed at that time in the

                     <hi>in the Chancell:</hi> but then it is as true, that in your

                     </gap>r a <hi>directive Canon,</hi> to guide us as occasion is,
and as may bee convenient for the Communicants.
Now where you fall upon the Doctor, for saying it is
a matter of <hi>permission</hi> rather than command: because,<note n="e" place="margin">p. 205.</note>
say you, the <hi>Reverend house of Convocation is not con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vened
to make permissions, that men may doe what they
list<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> but to make strong and binding</hi> Canons, <hi>to be obey<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
by all the subjects, and pursued by all the Ordinaries
of the Kingdome:</hi> In saying this, you doe not onely
thwart your <hi>Bishop,</hi> but confute your <hi>King.</hi> For if it be
to be <hi>pursued by all the Ordinaries in the Kingdome,</hi> ill
did the Bishop state the Question, in saying the <hi>Table
might stand Altar wise at the upper end</hi> of the Quire
or Chancell, <hi>in ca<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                           <desc>•</desc>
                        </gap>e the Minister may be seen and heard
of all the Congregation.</hi> And on the other side, you
both confute the <hi>King,</hi> and <hi>your selfe</hi> to boote. The
<hi>King,</hi> in that he hath determined, that placing of the
Table <hi>in Church or Chancell,</hi> as both the <hi>Rubricke</hi>
and the <hi>Canon</hi> have resolved therein, is to be constru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
only a thing of <hi>libertie.</hi> And being a thing of <hi>libertie,</hi>
is left unto the Judgement of the Ordinarie, <hi>both for
the thing it selfe, and for the time when, and how long,
as he may finde cause. Your selfe,</hi> in that you have sele<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cted
that particular passage<note n="f" place="margin">p. 59.</note> for your <hi>Euge tuum,</hi> and
honoured that alone with your <hi>mentis aureae verba
bracteata;</hi> as before was noted. Besides, you may ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>serve
in the <hi>Declaration,</hi> that those who pleaded for
the <hi>Appellants</hi> in <hi>S. Gregories</hi> case, urged not the <hi>Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>non</hi>
or the <hi>Rubrick,</hi> for <hi>strong and binding lawes,</hi> as you
please to call them: but onely urged them to this
purpose, that<note n="g" place="margin">
                        <hi>Coal from the Altar.</hi> p. 65.</note> they <hi>did give permission to place the Ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble
where it might stand with most fitnesse and conveni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence.</hi>
                     <pb n="95" facs="tcp:4200:133"/>
So that you see, the <hi>Canon</hi> and the <hi>Rubrick</hi> are
<hi>permissions</hi> onely, and not <hi>commands;</hi> which is but
what the Doctor said: and which you see confirmed
by your Lord the <hi>Ordinarie,</hi> the <hi>Advocates</hi> in the plea
aforesaid, the <hi>King, qui tot imperat legionibus;</hi> and
which is most of all, <hi>Your selfe.</hi>
                     <q>
                        <l>

                     </q>
Besides, the <hi>Canon</hi> being generall, was so to be drawn
up, as it might meet with all particular cases of what
sort soever. Now you know well enough, that in
some <hi>Churches</hi> there are no <hi>Chancels,</hi> and most espe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cially
in those of a latter building: and some such you
m<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

case the <hi>Canon</hi> had named onely <hi>Chancels,</hi> it might
have left some Churches without Communions, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause
they had no <hi>Chancels</hi> in the which to celebrate;
and so by consequence there had been no remedie, in
and by the <hi>Canon;</hi> if the Communion should not bee
duely ministred by the <hi>Priest,</hi> or not so frequently
received by the people, as it ought to be.</p>

the most holy Altar in the midst thereof, and
compassed it about with rayles, to hinder the rude

along the Eastern wall, it may be well interpreted to
be <gap reason="foreign">
                           <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                        </gap>, in the middle of the Chancell, in reference
to the North and South, as it since hath stood. And
secondly that were it otherwise, yet it were only a
particular case of the Church in <hi>Syria,</hi> wherein the
people being more mingled with the <hi>Iewes</hi> than
<pb n="98" facs="tcp:4200:135"/>
in other places, might possibly place the <hi>Altar</hi> in

                        </hi>
in the midst of the <hi>Temple,</hi> the better to conforme
unto them.</q> And this hee was the rather inclined
to think, because that Church in the whole structure
of it, came very neere unto the modell of that Tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple:
the Gate or entrance of the same being <gap reason="foreign">
                        <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                     </gap>
directly open to the East,
as was that of <hi>Solomons.</hi> Now you replie unto the first,
(after a scoffe or two bestowed on the simple Doctor)
that you had thought<note n="m" place="margin">p. 208.</note> the <hi>Panegyrist</hi> in <hi>Eusebius</hi> had
beene describing in that place a brave <hi>Chancell,</hi> set all
about with seats and other Ornaments, and that hee
had placed the <hi>Altar</hi> in the <hi>midst</hi> of that <hi>Chancell.</hi> The
Bishop of <hi>Lincoln</hi> had small reason to <hi>approve</hi> of this,
had he so throughly perused your book, as the <hi>Licence</hi>

you cannot think, that he doth meane by <hi>middle,</hi>
there, the middle between North and South. How
so? Because, say you, in case that Altar had stood
along the Eastern wall, and in the middle of the wall,
<note n="o" place="margin">p. 209.</note> a <hi>Grecian</hi> would not say that
<q>it stood <gap reason="foreign">

                        </gap>, but

                        </gap>, over-aneanst the middle of the

of the <hi>Altar of Incense,</hi> to be <gap reason="foreign">

Why man? I trow you cannot say of any thing that
standeth close unto the middle of a wall, and is
built up to it, as commonly the <hi>Altars</hi> were; that it
is built <gap reason="foreign">

with the <hi>Communion Table,</hi> placed exactly in the

                     </gap> over against the middle of the
<hi>Eastern</hi> wall. You might have found this in your own
instance of the <hi>Altar of Incense,</hi> said to be placed <gap reason="foreign">
                        <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                     </gap>,

                     <hi>close to the vaile,</hi> as you <hi>unlearnedly</hi> relate. But this
debate about the placing of the <hi>Altar</hi> of <hi>Incense</hi> will
fall more properly within the compasse of your reply
unto the Doctors second Answer; to which now we
hasten. Only I tell you by the way, that if the <hi>Pa<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                           <desc>•</desc>
                        </gap>e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gyrist</hi>
could not set the Table close along the wall,<note n="q" place="margin">p. 208. 209.</note> in
the middle between North and South, <hi>without a pain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted
Sea-card of the winds, and the foure points in hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven;</hi>
as you are pleased to laugh it out: he must make
use no doubt of the same invention, to place it in the
<hi>very midst of the Chancell.</hi> Where, you say, he placed
it. Your other flamme, is more impertinent, and ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>surd.
For though <hi>all substantiall bodies here on earth,
are equally measurable by those foure points in heaven,</hi>
as you truly say: yet your illation thereupon, that it
<hi>is not conceivable how this Altar should stand in the mid<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dle
betweene North</hi> and <hi>South, rather than in the middle
betweene East</hi> and <hi>West,</hi> is so ridiculous; that no man
but your selfe would have ventured at it. For when
we talke of setting up a <hi>Table</hi> in the <hi>midst</hi> of a <hi>Roome,</hi>
                     <pb n="100" facs="tcp:4200:136"/>
betweene <hi>East</hi> and <hi>West:</hi> I trow you do not think, but
in that roome, it may stand rather in the middle be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween
<hi>East</hi> and <hi>West,</hi> than in the middle of the same
between <hi>North</hi> and <hi>South:</hi> though it stands equally
distant from all foure points, in the heavenly bodies.</p>
                  <p>Then to the Doctors second answer, you reply and
say, <hi>that like</hi>
                     <note n="r" place="margin">p. 209.</note> 
                     <hi>unto a child in a sandy banck, hee puls
down</hi> with one hand, what he had built up with the
other. Why so? Because in case you did not like his
former answer, you might see something else for
your satisfaction. Call you this pulling <hi>down with one
hand,</hi> what he had <hi>built up</hi> with the other? I see the
Doctor cannot please you, say he what he will. But be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
said, what answer do you make unto it? Marry you
tell us out<note n="f" place="margin">p. 209. 210.</note> of <hi>Adricomius,</hi> that <q>though <hi>Tyre</hi> was in
<hi>Syrià,</hi> yet were the people thereof never mingled
with the <hi>Iewes,</hi> nor the <hi>Iewes</hi> with them, untill their
imbracing of the Christian faith, after the utter ruin
and subversion of that Nation.</q> Why man? And doth
the Doctor tell you, that the said Church or Temple in
<hi>Eusebius,</hi> was built before the <hi>ruin of that Nation,</hi> or be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
any of the <hi>Iewes</hi> had received the faith? You could
not be so ignorant as not to know by course of story,
that the said Church was built above 200. yeeres after
the ruine and subversion of the <hi>Iewish</hi> Nation: and
therfore it would best becom you, either to speak more
to the purpose, or to hold your peace. Yes that
you will you say. And rather than the <hi>Altar</hi> in <hi>Euse<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bius</hi>
shal l stand in the <hi>middle</hi> of the <hi>Chancell,</hi> to car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry

you are pleased to have the <hi>Communion Tables</hi>) as oc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>casion

the vaile, you finde no warrant in the Scripture. The

                     <hi>Tostatus</hi> whom you cite for <hi>fastning it unto the

velum, i. e. ante velum.</hi> That <hi>Altar</hi> is here said to
be against the vaile; that is, before it. What else? <hi>Hic
ponitur situs hujus altaris, scilicet in qua parte Sanctua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rii
poneretur.</hi> Here is described the situation of this
<hi>Altar,</hi> namely in what part of the Sanctuary it was
placed. Is this to set it close unto the <hi>vaile,</hi> and there
to fasten it? we may conjecture how you use <hi>Ribera</hi>
by your faire dealing with <hi>Tostatus,</hi> whom you thus
abuse. Besides, your selfe hath told us, that the <hi>Altar of
Incense</hi> did<note n="y" place="margin">p. 210.</note> stand between <hi>the Table on the North</hi> (you
mean the <hi>Table of Shewbread,</hi> do you not?) and the <hi>Can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dlestick
upon the South:</hi> and I presume you will not say,
the <hi>Table of the Shewbread,</hi> and the <hi>Candlesticke</hi> did
stand close unto the <hi>vaile,</hi> or were fastned to it. But
for these things, the <hi>Altar,</hi> and the <hi>Table,</hi> and the <hi>Can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dlesticke,</hi>
how they were disposed of in the <hi>Tabernacle:</hi>
you may consult the Schemes thereof in <hi>Torniellus,
Ann. M.</hi> 2544. where you will finde the <hi>Altar</hi> stood not
<hi>close unto the vaile,</hi> but a good distance off, towards
the nether end, though not exactly in the midst. You
<pb n="102" facs="tcp:4200:137"/>
might as well have let the <hi>Altar</hi> in <hi>Eusebius</hi> stand
close along the wall, in the middle betweene <hi>North</hi>
and <hi>South,</hi> as the Doctor placed it; as have betraied
your ignorance, both in the <hi>Criticisme</hi> and the <hi>fact,</hi>
to so little purpose; yea and your honestie to boot.
And here I would have left you and <hi>Eusebius,</hi> but that
you will not let the Doctor goe away with any thing.
For whereas the poore Doctor said, that the Gate or

the leading way or entrance into the Court, or
Church-yard, as we call it now: And thinke you they
went round about the Church, to finde another way
at the further end? Besides, you might have found,
if you would have sought, that there were three dores
into the very Church it selfe, all of them in the Ea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sterne
end, <gap reason="foreign">

                     </gap>, as<note n="a" place="margin">Euseb. l. 10. c. 4.</note> the Authour
hath it. Finally, whereas you had said before, that
there<note n="b" place="margin">p. 210.</note> 
                     <hi>was nothing true in all this relation,</hi> but <hi>that the
word Altar is named in Eusebius;</hi> now you have ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken
from him that comfort also: that <hi>Altar</hi> being <hi>by

                     </gap>, <hi>the sanctification of a Christian soule.</hi>
You might as well have said, the <hi>Temple</hi> there descri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bed
is a <hi>Metaphoricall Temple:</hi> because the <hi>Panegyrist</hi>
descanting upon it, compares the <hi>Soule</hi> unto that <hi>Tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple,</hi>
as the <hi>sinceritie</hi> thereof to the holy <hi>Altar.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>We have been long about <hi>Eusebius,</hi> but will be brie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ser
in the rest; as briefe as possibly we can, your old
tricks considered. The next that followes is the first
Councel of <hi>Constantinople,</hi> as it is called in Bish. <hi>Iewel,</hi>
                     <pb n="103" facs="tcp:4200:137"/>
being that <hi>sub Agapeto &amp; Menna,</hi> as the Doctor had it.
Here you<note n="c" place="margin">p. 211.</note> conceive you have him at a fine advantage;
<hi>Agapetus</hi> being <hi>dead before that Councell</hi> sate; and
<hi>Menna Patriarch of Constantinople</hi> presiding in it. But
Sir, you cannot chuse but know, that howsoever <hi>Aga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>petus</hi>
died before the sitting of the Councell: yet it
was called especially by his procuring; (being then
at <hi>Constantinople</hi>) although hee lived not to see
the effects thereof: his Legates also being there, by ver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tue
of a Commission to them made, when he was alive.
And this was possibly the reason, why <hi>Binius</hi> in the
top of every page throughout the <hi>Acts</hi> of this whole
<hi>Councell,</hi> being 112. in all, sets it <hi>Sub Agapeto &amp; Men<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>na,</hi>
as the Doctor did: your next exception, if it be not
better, will be worse than nothing. The place allea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ged
by Bishop <hi>Iewell,</hi> is this, that <hi>Tempore dyptichoram,</hi>
at the <hi>Reading of the Dypticks,</hi> the <hi>people with great

<hi>grammatically, medium</hi> doth signifie the <hi>middle part or
space;</hi> therefore <hi>afferre in medium</hi> cannot signifie to
bring a thing unto us, or before us. This said, you
make another sally, to shew your Criticall learning
(you have such store of it) touching the derivation of
the Greek word <gap reason="foreign">

                        <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                     </gap>, because this
<hi>Vtensil,</hi> saith <hi>Varro,</hi> 
                     <q>is ever placed in the middle
space between us: so that according to this great and
antient Critick, it cannot properly be called a <hi>Table,</hi>
unlesse it be placed, as Saint <hi>Austin</hi> reports it, <hi>in

Finde you in this that the latine word for a <hi>Table</hi> was

is your own, no such thing in <hi>Varro:</hi> and consequent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
<hi>Mesa</hi> was not the first Latine word for <hi>Table</hi> as you
have falsified the Author, only to place it in the

which you would not see; and that is, <hi>quod ponebant
pleraque in cibo mensa,</hi> because that on the Table the
meat was served out by measure. Every man had his
own <hi>dimensum,</hi> as the word still holds. So then, it may
bee called a <hi>Table,</hi> although not <hi>placed in the middle.</hi>
Your Grammer learning being showne, we must next
take a turne in your Divine and <hi>Theologicall Philology:</hi>
where we are told<note n="t" place="margin">p, 216. 217.</note> of <hi>Audientes, genuflectentes, com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>petentes,</hi>
and <hi>intincti,</hi> severall kinds of <hi>Catechumeni,</hi>
in the primitive times; as if those names had never
beene heard of, but amongst the fennes: you would be
thought to lie at wrack and manger with Lady <hi>Philo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>logy,</hi>
though you never kist her. For had you but the
least acquaintance with her, you would not runne into
those errours which you do continually. You tell us
of these <hi>Audientes,</hi> that<note n="u" place="margin">p. 217.</note> if the <hi>Table were in the Chan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cell,
they could not be admitted to draw so neere as to see
and view it:</hi> and therefore make Saint <hi>Austin</hi> say,
<hi>that's the Lords Table there, which you see placed in the
midst of the Church.</hi> Why? could they not more easily
see it in the <hi>midst of the Church,</hi> than if it had been in
the <hi>Chancell?</hi> Were they so Eagle-sighted a far off, and
could they not discerne it, if placed neerer hand? This
<pb n="109" facs="tcp:4200:140"/>
is a mystery indeed, above my capacity. Perhaps you
think, that commonly, and at other times, it stood in
the middle of the <hi>Church:</hi> but when the <hi>Catechumeni</hi>
were driven forth, and the holy Sacrament to bee ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ministred,
it was removed into the <hi>Chancell.</hi> And
then consider with your selfe, how fitly you would
have the <hi>Table</hi> to bee set at other times in the upper
end of the <hi>Chancell;</hi> and be brought down in time of
the <hi>Communion</hi> into the body of the <hi>Church.</hi> Next you
have made S. <hi>Austin</hi> say, that if these <hi>Audientes</hi> could
<hi>but by chance get a glympse of the holy Table, they were in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stantly
(all discipline notwithstanding) to be baptized:</hi>
and yet Saint <hi>Austin</hi> saith expressely, <hi>ut mensam vide<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>atis,</hi>
that they did see the <hi>T<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

                        </gap>ble,</hi> though they came not
to it; nor do we finde they were baptized so present<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
on the sight thereof. Therefore to set the matter
right, I rather should conceive that the word <hi>illae</hi>
there, is of specall efficacie: and points not to a Ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble,
which was then before them, (for then <hi>haec mensa
est ipsius,</hi> might have been more proper): but to some
<hi>Table</hi> further off, in the <hi>Quire</hi> or <hi>Chancell,</hi> made ready
for all those that purposed to Communicate; which
the said <hi>Catechumen!</hi> might see, though they came
not neere it. And so Saint <hi>Austin</hi> in these words,

interpreted; <hi>His Table is that yonder</hi> which is now

that you can look upon the Table; and yet not fit

As for your note from<note n="x" place="margin">Observat<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> l. 2. cap. 2. <hi>cited</hi> p. 217.</note> 
                     <hi>Albaspinus,</hi> that if the

were all instantly to be baptized:</hi> you do most shame<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fully
abuse that learned Bishop; who was too great
<pb n="110" facs="tcp:4200:141"/>
a scholler to be so mistaken. And therefore take along
that passage for a close of all, to which you point us
in your margin: where you shall finde he speaks
not of their getting a glympse the holy <hi>Table,</hi> but
of the <hi>holy mysteries</hi> celebrated on the Table. <hi>Si cui

                  <p>Next for <hi>Durandus,</hi> it was observed out of him by
Bishop <hi>Iewell,</hi> that the Priest turning about at the <hi>Al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tar,</hi>
doth use to say, <hi>Aperui os meum in medio Ecclesiae:</hi>
which proves not, as the Doctor said<note n="y" place="margin">Coal. <hi>from t<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

stood in the midst of the <hi>Church;</hi> but that the <hi>Priest</hi>
stood at the midst of the <hi>Altar.</hi> You know this well
enough, that the Priest doth stand so; but you must
needs say somewhat, what soever you know: and ther<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
bring <hi>Durandus</hi>
                     <note n="z" place="margin">p. 226.</note> to expound himselfe. Well
then, what saith <hi>Durandus</hi> to it. <q>
                        <hi>Per Altare Cor no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>strum
intelligitur, quod est in medio Corporis, sicut Alta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>re
in medio Ecclesiae.</hi> By the <hi>Altar</hi> is to be understood
our heart, which is in the midst of the body, as the
<hi>Altar</hi> is in the midst of the Church.</q> This is almost the
only place you have cited fairly in all your book: &amp; in
congratulation to your selfe for your honest dealing,
you presently flie out on the poore Doctor, as if there
were no <hi>sensible sacrifice,</hi> nor <hi>materiall Altar:</hi> because
<hi>Durandus</hi> in his way of <hi>Allegories,</hi> compares the <hi>Altar</hi> to
our <hi>heart.</hi> Iust thus before you dealt with the <hi>Panegyrist</hi>
in <hi>Eusebius;</hi> and too ridiculously in both. Therefore
to let your <hi>Allegories</hi> passe, as not considerable in this
case, we must reply unto the words. And here I will
<pb n="111" facs="tcp:4200:141"/>
make bold to tell you, that by <hi>in medio Ecclesiae</hi> here,
<hi>Durandus</hi> doth not meane the <hi>middle</hi> of the Church,
that is, the <hi>body</hi> of the Church: but which I know you
meane to laugh at, the middle of the upper end of the
<hi>Quire,</hi> or <hi>Chancell;</hi> there where the <hi>Altar</hi> stood in
those times he lived, and long before him. Will you
the reason why I say it? then look into the former
Chapter, where hee will tell you of those <hi>rayles,</hi> or
<hi>barres,</hi> which part the <hi>Altar</hi> (or the <hi>Altar place</hi>) from
the rest of the <hi>Quire:</hi> as it is now in our Cathedrals,
and many others of this kingdome. <hi>Cancelli quibus Al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tare
a Choro dividitur, separationem significat coelestium
a terrenis.</hi> And so the <hi>Altar</hi> stood not in <hi>Durandus</hi>
time, in the midst of the Church, but generally at the
end<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> of the <hi>Chancell,</hi> and thus much briefly for <hi>Du<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>randus.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>For those exceptions which you make against the
testimony produced by the Doctor<note n="a" place="margin">Coal. p. 56.</note> from <hi>Socrates</hi> and
<hi>Nicephorus,</hi> about the standing of the <hi>Altars</hi> in <hi>Anti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ochia;</hi>
we must needs runne them over for your satis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>faction,
though not worth the while. What they af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firme
herein, we have at full laied down in our former
Chapter: <hi>Cassiodore</hi> being there brought in, into the
bargaine. The first thing you except against, is that
the place he cited from <hi>Nicephorus</hi>
                     <note n="b" place="margin">228.</note> is not to be <hi>found</hi>
lib. 12. c. 24. <hi>but</hi> lib. 12. c. 34. This is another of those
<hi>malicious falsifications</hi> that you charge him with, p. 58.
and<note n="c" place="margin">and I be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>shrew him for this t<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

errour if you mark it well; and such as <hi>Printers</hi> will
commit, do we what we can. But it was <hi>found,</hi> it seems
at last; that's well: more than man can say, of you and
your quotations, I am sure of that: And so the wretched
Doctor hath dealt with <hi>Socrates</hi> also,<note n="d" place="margin">Ibid.</note> 
                     <hi>citing him right,</hi>
                     <pb n="112" facs="tcp:4200:142"/>
you say, in <hi>Latine, cap.</hi> 21. whereas it is the 22. Chapt.
in the <hi>Greek.</hi> It would be well if you would cite your
Authors right in any Language; or else finde greater
matters to except against, before you quarrell: yes
that you will you say. <q>For these <hi>Historians doe not
note those rites of the Altars</hi> of the Citie of <hi>Antioch,</hi>
as different from all other <hi>Altars,</hi> or from the gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rall
practice of the Church: but that they differed
in those rites from the Church of <hi>Rome,</hi> only, as <hi>Io<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sephus
Vice-comes</hi> proves at large.</q> What ever <hi>Vice-comes</hi>
proves in other places, I am sure hee proves it
not in the place you cite; being <hi>de Missae Ritib. l. 2. c.</hi> 5.
in which there is not one poore word that reflects
that way. Nor will I take the paines to search, if hee
saith it elsewhere. For whatsoever he saith in that, he
can never prove it: the Authors being so expresse in
the affirmation. <gap reason="foreign">
                        <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                     </gap>, as it is in
<hi>Socrates; contrarium ab aliis Ecclesiis situm,</hi> the trans<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>latour
reades it, <hi>diversum prorsus quam alibi situm,</hi> so
<hi>Nicephorus</hi> hath it. The words are generall enough,
without relation any way to the Church of <hi>Rome.</hi>
Now where you say,<note n="a" place="margin">p. 229.</note> that neither <hi>Socrates</hi> nor <hi>Ni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cephorus,</hi>
doe say that the <hi>Altars</hi> did stand <hi>Westward;</hi>
that <hi>Socrates</hi> doth not speake of the <hi>position of these
Altars,</hi> but the <hi>Churches</hi> onely; and that <hi>Nicephorus
adding besides his Author, the posture of the Altars,</hi> doth
<hi>presently correct himselfe</hi> in the words of <hi>Socrates:</hi> all
these are worse than so many mistakings, as you have
made them in the Doctor, they are wilfull falsehoods.

words to another matter? For shame presume not
thus on the credulitie of your Readers: and think not
all the world so stupid, as to bee cheated with your
faire words, and a loaded margin. The rest of your
exceptions are so slight, they need no reply. The
Doctor saith not as you<note n="f" place="margin">p. 229.</note> charge him, that <hi>all the people</hi>

of your owne against the standing of the <hi>Altar,</hi> at

your particular instances will prove but weake and sil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
Arguments, like the <hi>Cathedrall Church at Dover, or
the round Church of Cambridge,</hi> which wee met with
lately. That which you tell us from the Greek Chur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ches
is indeed considerable, if it were as true. You tell
us out of <hi>Gentian Hervetus,</hi>
                     <note n="h" place="margin">p. 213.</note> that in the <gap reason="foreign">

                     </gap> or <hi>Chan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cell</hi>
there be two <hi>Altars,</hi> whereof <hi>the greater stands in
the midst of that Roome, and the lesse close by, at the left

<pb n="114" facs="tcp:4200:143"/>
the <hi>Pluralitie of Masses,</hi> cites many of the Ancient
Fathers that say, there is but one <hi>Altar</hi> in every
Church: and then concludes with <hi>Gentian Hervet;
In Graetorum templis unum tantum est Altare, idque in

reason to beleeve it was not in the middle of the <hi>Chan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cell</hi>
neither. One of you I am sure is out with your
<hi>Gentian Hervet,</hi> touching the number of your Altars:
and think you, that you are not both out in the pla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cing
of them? No certainly say you, that cannot bee,
<note n="i" place="margin">p. 213.</note> because <hi>the setter forth of the Greek and Latine Litur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gies,</hi>
hath affirmed as much: <hi>viz. that there be in those
Churches two Altars, the greater in the middest, and
called the holy Table, the lesser called the Prothesis, o<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

of Proposition.</hi> And then you bring in <hi>Claudius
Sainctes,</hi> to tel us, that in the <hi>Greek Temples, there is but
one high</hi> Altar, <hi>and that placed in the midst of the Quire.</hi>
You should doe well to reconcile your witnesses, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
you bring them to give evidence. <hi>Claudius Sain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctes,</hi>
as you cite him, hath told us of one <hi>Altar</hi> only;
the <hi>setter forth</hi> of the <hi>Greeke and Latine Liturgies,</hi> as
you please to call him, tels us of two; but placeth, as
you cite him, the greatest only in the midst: and <hi>Gen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tian
Hervet</hi> setting the great <hi>Altar</hi> in the midst, hath
placed the least close by it, at the left side of the grea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter.
Your selfe and Bishop <hi>Iewell</hi> with your <hi>Gentian

his <hi>Claudius Sainctes,</hi> agree but very ill together. We

And first beginning with your <hi>Claudius Sainctes,</hi> you

cite him<note n="k" place="margin">p. 214. in margine.</note> in his <hi>Edition of the Greeke Liturgie</hi> at <hi>Paris,</hi>

conceale the matter; that so your Reader might bee
drawne rather to take it on your word, than take the
paines to looke for it upon such uncertainties. But

compassed them about, we know that also. But that
the <hi>Altars</hi> stood so in the Christian Church, you do

which were it <hi>fastned to the wall, were as
you say impossible for a man so to do.</hi> Iust so. But tell
me in good earnest, do you conceive the Bishop is en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>joyned
in the <hi>Pontificall,</hi> to go round about the <hi>Al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tar,</hi>
(as you meane round about it, when you tell us so)

because he could not come to do it. If not to cense
it, then certainly much lesse to <hi>compasse</hi> it about, as

                  <p>From Authors you proceed to Precedents,<note n="q" place="margin">p. 218.</note>

answering these Authorities in all ages, and in

there's never a Scriveners Clerk in <hi>London,</hi> but will
shew better <hi>Precedents</hi> for a poore <hi>Noverint Vniversi.</hi>
And of this quality is your first, a generall <hi>Precedent,</hi>
a perfect <hi>Noverint Vniversi.</hi> For as you say, you were
extreamly <hi>laught at by all strangers, for making unto
them such a foolish question, as they deemed it.</hi> And like
enough, I would have laught at you my selfe, had I
heard you aske it: for never did so great a <hi>Critick</hi> aske
so poore a question. I know your meaning yet, how<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever.
You would bee thought to have been laught at,
for thinking that the <hi>Altars</hi> generally stood at the <hi>East</hi>
end of the <hi>Church:</hi> but if you asked the question, you
were only laught at by the strangers, for thinking it a
matter questionable, that they should stand in any
other place than that. And though I take this for a
<hi>tale,</hi> a very <hi>winters tale,</hi> fit only to bee told by such a
confidence as yours: yet being told by one of the
right faction, no doubt but it will passe for currant,
and finde a credence among those who are not able
to distinguish between <hi>chalk</hi> and <hi>cheese,</hi> but swallow
all that comes before them. Your <hi>Noverint Vniversi</hi>

you cannot hence conclude, that the <hi>High Altar</hi>
stood indifferently in any part of the Church; or that
in those small Churches wherein there was one <hi>Altar</hi>
only, that one and only <hi>Altar</hi> stood as it hapned in the

in the greater Churches there were severall <hi>Altars,</hi>
none of the which come under our consideration, but
that one <hi>Altar,</hi> which was disposed of in the <hi>Chancell.</hi>
Your <hi>Pillar-Altars,</hi> and your <hi>Chappell-Altars</hi> were of

                  <p>This said, those few particulars which you have to
shew, might very easily be granted, and do no preju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dice
at al to the cause in hand: and it were not amisse

you have to shew. Your instance of an<note n="a" place="margin">p. 220.</note> Antient <hi>Mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble
Altar,</hi> in the middle of the <hi>Catacombe,</hi> wee will
freely yeeld you? For say you not your selfe, that
it <hi>was a place, in which the antient Bishops of Rome were
wont to retire themselves in time of persecution?</hi> If so,
it was well they had an <hi>Altar.</hi> Those were no times
to be sollicitous about the placing of the same, as be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
we told you. Next in Saint <hi>Peters</hi> Church in the
<hi>Vatican</hi> you have found an <hi>Altar,</hi> called <hi>Altare Maggi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ore;</hi>
but the worst is, you know not where to place
it. The Italian Author whom you<note n="b" place="margin">p. 221.</note> cite, tels you <hi>the
posture of this High Altar, was in the midst of the Quire:</hi>
and yet <hi>Chemnitius,</hi> whom you cite p. 222. and allow
of too, hath placed it <hi>ante Chorum,</hi> before the very
Quire. This, as you say, was not <hi>observed by your for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer

if you report him right, hath placed it in <hi>the midst

that it stood before it. But stand it where it will,

you spake of, for ought there appeares; but only tels
you, <hi>apud Altare ante Chorum,</hi> that before the <hi>Quire</hi>

it where you will, either in the middle of the <hi>Quire,</hi>
or before the doore, you cannot thence conclude
that there was no High Altar anciently at the East end
of the Church; no more than if a man should say,

there informes us. Nor can it but seem strange to any
man that hath his wits about him as he ought to have,
that the Altar with the <hi>raile</hi> about it, or the Altar
<hi>place,</hi> should be entituled the <hi>Diaconie;</hi> wherein the
<hi>Deacons</hi> had so little, if at all anything to do. But were
it so as you would have it, yet were this little to the
honour of the <hi>Archdeacons</hi> office as now it stands; and
very much unto the <hi>Priests.</hi> All that is given the <hi>Dea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cons</hi>
here is but a trust committed to them above those
other Ministers which were <hi>insacrati</hi> (as the later of
your Councels cals them) not yet admitted unto any
of the holy Orders, or to them onely of the lowest or
inferiour sort, which are not properly to be called <hi>Or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders,</hi>
but rather preparations to them. The washing of
the plate, and laying up the sacred <hi>utensils,</hi> in their pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per
places, was not conceived to be a fitting service for
so high a dignity as the holy <hi>Priesthood:</hi> and therefore
was put off to them, who being <hi>in ordine ad spiritua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lia,</hi>
in some degree or way unto it, were thought most
fit to undertake it. So that this charge was plainly cast
upon the <hi>Deacon,</hi> rather to ease the <hi>Priest,</hi> and for the
honour of his calling; than to give any place or privi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge

Not in the Councell of <hi>Aquisgrane,</hi> or <hi>Aken,</hi> I am sure
of that, though thither you referre us in your margi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nall

However other of your passages might

For did he not when he <hi>was in place,</hi> put many

thinking it so great an avocation from their <hi>studies,</hi> but
that they might doe well with both. And have you

that a man might beare it with content enough? But

but you have made good game to all the brethren of

should be no <hi>Altar</hi> in the Church, for the mysticall

                  <p>In the next place you set before us a pretty quil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>let:
the holy Table<note n="o" place="margin">p. 123.</note> 
                     <hi>in the Christian Church, not
being exemplified,</hi> as you say, <hi>from the square Altars,</hi>
Exod. 27. but <hi>from the long Table of the Shew-bread
which stood in the Temple,</hi> Exod. 25. This is good <hi>fish</hi>
indeed, if it were well fryed; but upon better view,
proves not worth the eating. You say the <hi>holy table</hi>
in the Christian Church was not exemplified from
the square <hi>Altars</hi> in the Law: and yet you tell us, p.
<pb n="42" facs="tcp:4200:173"/>
126. that by the <hi>Canons of their Church, that very
forme is required amongst the Papists,</hi> and to them you
leave it. You might do well, before you make it
proper to the <hi>Papists,</hi> and to them alone, to have
considered of the forme of the ancient <hi>Altars;</hi> and
told us what those <hi>Canons</hi> were, and of what anti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quitie,
that do so enjoyne it. You point us in your
Margin, unto <hi>Suarez,</hi> in <hi>tertiam partem:</hi> as good and
punctuall a direction to finde out the <hi>Canon,</hi> as if you
had enjoyn'd us to enquire for your House in <hi>Lin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>colnshire,</hi>
and never told us what's your name. Then
for the <hi>Table of Shew-bread,</hi> to which you do referre
the originall of the <hi>holy Table,</hi> you flutter up and
downe, as one that knows not what to trust to: as
most an end they do not that propose new fancies.
For p. 125. you bring in the conceits of <hi>two Iewish
Rabbins,</hi> tending you say, unto <hi>your purpose.</hi> How fo?
Ezek. 4. 22. (it should be 41. 22.) it is thus written,
<hi>And he said unto me, this is the Table</hi> before the <hi>Lord,
meaning without doubt the Altar of incense.</hi> You say
exceeding right in that, the Table spoken of by the
Prophet, is the <hi>Altar of incense:</hi> but what hath that
to do with the <hi>Table of Shew-bread?</hi> This you con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firme
by that which followeth. The question then
grows, how the <hi>Altar,</hi> is called a <hi>Table:</hi>
                     <note n="p" place="margin">125.</note> and you
replie unto it from those <hi>Rabbins, that at this day the
Table performes what the Altar was wont to do.</hi> Where
first you blend together the Table o<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap> the <hi>Shew-bread,</hi>
and the Altar of <hi>Incense,</hi> as if both one thing:
and next you make the <hi>Rabbins</hi> speake of the <hi>Christi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>an
Table,</hi> as if it did performe what the <hi>Altar</hi> should,
whereas they spake it of their owne. For why should
you beleeve that any of the <hi>Rabbins</hi> would conceive
<pb n="43" facs="tcp:4200:173"/>
so honourably of the <hi>Christian Tables,</hi>
                     <note n="q" place="margin">Ibi. p. 125.</note> that <hi>since
the destruction of the Temple,</hi> they should <hi>become the

have no such conceit of the <hi>holy Table<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
                     </hi> and it was
done but like a <hi>Gentile</hi> to report so of them. Last
of all, where before you make the <hi>holy Table</hi> to be
exemplified from the <hi>long-table of the Shew-bread,</hi>
you shut up this vagarie with this handsome close,
<note n="r" place="margin">p. 126.</note> that <hi>the onely</hi> utensil <hi>you relate unto</hi> (for the forme
and fashion of your Table) <hi>is the long-square table of
the Incense.</hi> Which as it plainly contradicts what you
said before, touching the Petigree of the <hi>holy Table,</hi>
from the <hi>Table of Shew-bread,</hi> so it confutes the Scri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pture
also: which never told you of a <hi>Table,</hi> but an
<hi>Altar of Incense;</hi> or if a <hi>Table,</hi> yet a square table cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainly,
for <hi>foure-square shall it be,</hi> saith the very Text,
Exod. 30. 2. So excellent an invention was your
new originall of the <hi>Christian Table;</hi> and so bravely
followed.</p>
                  <p>But then you say, you have some Authors for it:
so you have for every thing, till it is brought unto
the tryall. Remember what you are to prove, and
then shew your evidence. The point in issue, is that

Church, is not exemplified from the square.</hi> Altars,
<hi>but from the long Table of the Shew-bread that stood in

home to this, we are gone in law; but all your wit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesses
fall short. <hi>Isidore Peleusiota,</hi> whom you first

had beene hidden in the law, but was now revealed.
This is the totall of his evidence. And this makes
nothing for the <hi>forme and situation of the Table,</hi> which
was the matter to be proved; but onely that, as he
conceived, the <hi>Shew-bread</hi> did prefigurate som<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

which afterwards was instituted in the <hi>Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stian</hi>

you presse this matter hard, as if our <hi>Christian sacri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fice</hi>
did relate to that; you give the <hi>Papists</hi> more ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vantage
for their halfe Communion, then you will
gaine unto your selfe, about the <hi>forme and fashion</hi> of
your <hi>holy Table.</hi> You say indeed<note n="u" place="margin">p. 124.</note> it <hi>will be long,
yer we will bring so cleare and ancient an extruction for
the forme and fashion of the</hi> Altars <hi>in Christianitie;</hi>
though you brought nothing hence for either.
When we see more, we shall know better what to
answer. To make a transcript of your allegations,
from <hi>Irenaeus</hi> and S. <hi>Ambrose, Origen,</hi> and <hi>Hierome,</hi>
being no more unto the purpose, were onely to wast
time and paper. All that they say, is nothing to the
<hi>forme and situation of the holy table,</hi> but to the analogy
and proportion, betweene the <hi>bread</hi> in the Lords
Supper now, and the <hi>Shew-bread</hi> then: &amp; yet you fal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sifie
your Authors also, to make that good. You tell
us out of <hi>Irenaeus,</hi> that <hi>omnes justi sacerdotalem habent

when you say, <hi>all that are justified by</hi> Christ <hi>have a</hi>

<hi>The Minister appointed to reade the Communion (which

                     <hi>either in the first or second service,</hi> as you distin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guish.
Is this to cite and to approve the appellation:
Yes, that it is say you, and more. For the good wri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
of the letter, finding the<note n="u" place="margin">P. 173. 174</note> Vicar <hi>used it (as it
seemes)</hi> in <hi>his discourse,</hi> and that the <hi>neighbours boggled
at it, excuseth it as done in imitation of that grave and
pious booke.</hi> That grave and pious booke, good Lord,
how wise you are upon a sudden, and yet how sud<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>denly
doe you fall againe to your former follies<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
That booke, as <hi>grave and pious</hi> as it is, was <hi>never in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tended</hi>
(as you say in that which followes <hi>to give Ru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brickes
to the publike Liturgie;</hi> and therefore howsoe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver the
<hi>Fast-booke</hi> cals it (so <hi>grave and pious</hi> though
it were) let never any Country Vicar in <hi>Lincolne Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ocese</hi>
presume to call it so hereafter. Iust so you dealt
<pb n="58" facs="tcp:4200:181"/>
before with his Majesties Chappell. Having extol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led
it to the heavens, and set forth all things in the
same,<note n="x" place="margin">p. 34.</note> as <hi>wisely and religiously done:</hi> yet you are
resolute, that <hi>Parish Churches,</hi> are not, nor ought not
to be bound, to <hi>imitate the same in those outward</hi> cir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cumstances.
A grievous sinne it was no doubt, for
the poore Vicar to apply the distribution of the Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vice,
in the booke of <hi>Fast,</hi> unto the booke of <hi>Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon-Prayer:</hi>
and it was very timely to be done, to <hi>ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cuse
him</hi> in it, as if he did relate onely to the Book of
Fast. Else who can tell, but that the Alderman of
<hi>Grantham</hi> and the neighbours there, might have con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived
he used it<note n="y" place="margin">p. 174.</note> in <hi>imitation of the two Masses
used of old;</hi> that <hi>viz. of the Catechumeni, and that of
the Faithfull:</hi> neither of which, the Alderman (a
<hi>prudent and discreet,</hi> but no learned man) nor any of
his neighbours had ever heard of. Great reason to
excuse the Vicar from so foule a crime; which God
knows how it might have scandalized poore men,
that never had tooke notice of it, till it was glanced
at in the letter.</p>
                  <p>The Vicar being thus excused, you turne your
stile upon the Doctor, for justifying the distribution
of the Common Prayers<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> into a first and second ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vice.
You said even now, that you <hi>approved the ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pellation;</hi>
yet here you give us severall Arguments
for reproofe thereof. For first, say you,<note n="a" place="margin">p. 174.</note> the <hi>Or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der
of Morning Prayer,</hi> is not (as the poore man sup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poseth)
the <hi>whole Morning Prayer,</hi> but a little <hi>frag<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
thereof</hi> called the Order of <hi>Matins,</hi> in the old
Primers of King <hi>Henry</hi> the eight, King <hi>Edward</hi> the
sixth, and the Primer of <hi>Sarum,</hi> what no where else?
Do you not finde it in your Common-Prayer book,
<pb n="59" facs="tcp:4200:181"/>
to be called <hi>Mattins?</hi> Look in the Calendar for pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per
Lessons, and tell me, when you see me next,
how you finde it there? <hi>Matens and Evensong,</hi> 
                     <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>aith it
there; <hi>Morning and Evening Prayer,</hi> saith the Booke
else-where<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> which makes, I trow, the order of
<hi>Morning prayer</hi> to be the same now, with the order
of <hi>Mattins,</hi> and that in the intention of the Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon-Prayer
Book, not in the Antient <hi>Primers</hi> onely.
<hi>Not the whole Morning prayer</hi> say you, but you speake
without booke: your booke instructing you to finde
the full course and tenor of <hi>Morning and Evening
Prayer throughout the yeare.</hi> Yet you object, that if we
should make <hi>one service of the Mattins, we must make
another of the Collects, and a third of the</hi> Leta<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="2 letters">
                        <desc>••</desc>
                     </gap>e: and
<hi>the Communion at the soonest will be the</hi> fourth, <hi>but by
no meanes the second service.</hi> Why Sir, I hope the
<hi>Collects</hi> are distributed, some for the first, and others
for the <hi>second service:</hi> there's no particular <hi>service</hi>
to be made of them. And for the <hi>Letanie,</hi> compa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring
the <hi>Rubrick</hi> after <hi>Quicunque vult,</hi> with the
Queenes <hi>Injunctions,</hi> that seemes to be a preparato<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rie
to the <hi>second service.</hi> For it is said<note n="b" place="margin">Cap. 18.</note> there,
<q>That immediately before the time of Communi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
of the Sacrament, the <hi>Priests</hi> with other of the
Quire shall kneele in the midst of the Church, and
sing or say plainly the Letany, &amp;c.</q> And you may
marke it in some Churches, that whiles the <hi>Letanie</hi>
is saying, there is a Bell tolled, to give notice unto
the people, that the Communion service, is now co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ming
on. Secondly, you<note n="c" place="margin">p. 174<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
                     </note> object, that by this rec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>koning,
we shall have <hi>an entire service without a prayer
for King or Bishop;</hi> which you are <hi>bold to say,</hi> and may
say it boldly, is <hi>in no Liturgie this day, either</hi> Greeke
<pb n="60" facs="tcp:4200:182"/>
                     <hi>or</hi> Latine. Stay here a while. Have you not found it o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>therwise
in your observations? What say you then to
these? <hi>O Lord save the King,</hi> &amp; then, <hi>Endue thy Ministers
with righteousnesse.</hi> Are these no praiers for King or Bi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>shop?
Those which come after in the <hi>Letanie,</hi> &amp; that in

the <hi>Act of Parliament</hi> doth <hi>call it service, and not services;</hi>
therefore (for so you must conclude) there is no distri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bution
