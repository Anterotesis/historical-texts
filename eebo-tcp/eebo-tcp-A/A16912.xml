            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

OVT OF BRITANIE, IN

                  <p>
                     <seg rend="decorInit">S</seg>IR, by my laſt letters of the 20. of Auguſt, I did acquaint
you with thoſe reaſons that
moued the Prince <hi>de Dombes</hi>
in ſuch earneſtneſſe to vrge,
and my Lord Generall to
yeeld vnto this viage of the
South: which concluſion ſo
mightelie perplexed the In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>habitantes
of S. <hi>Brieux,</hi> that their greeues forcing
th' ordinarie paſſage of a popular diſcontentment, re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolued
into moſt bitter railinges againſt the Prince,
vpon whom they publickly exclaimed: That hauing
ſixe moneths ſince ſupplied his armie with al things
neceſſarie, (entertained both him and it 14. daies in
their Towne, and laſtly yeelded to a contribution
of a thouſand crownes,) he woulde now abandon
them vnto the implacable furie of their profeſsed e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nemies,
the <hi>Lambalists,</hi> and the greedie couetousnes
of the Duke <hi>de Mercurie,</hi> who alreadie had extorted
1400. crownes from them: Some did ſolemnly vow
<pb facs="tcp:16713:4"/>
to ſeeke new habitations, and the greateſt number
abſolutelie to geue themſelues vnto the League.
How be it in verie trueth theſe reaſons were not ſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficient,
to binde an armie to the conſeruation of ſo
meane a place, which by neither partie can be other<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe
preſerued.</p>
                  <p>The Gentlemen of thoſe partes ſeeking to di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uert
this reſolution, by drawing the Prince vnto a ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>conde
vndertaking of <hi>Lambalta,</hi> made proffer of
10000. men, toward the better performance of the
ſeruice, and offered an hundred of the beſt of them,
vnto the firſt breach that ſhould be made by the Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>non.
Theſe were of thoſe Gallants, which left vs at
the late ſiege of <hi>Lamballa.</hi> who co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>tented themſeles
to looke on at the cutting of our throats, while they
(good men) did figure vnto themſelues no other
care, but the fetching in of harueſt, and the conſerua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
of their petie menage; as if the warres of their
Countreie, nothing apperteining to themſelues,
were onely to be determined by her Maieſties For<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces.
But ſeeing the armie readie to march, and that
reckoning ſome what diſappointed, knowing withal
notwithſtanding, the Duke <hi>de Mercuries</hi> ſafegard,
which the moſt of them haue, that their owne neere
neighbouring hungry Garriſons, woulde eternallie
praie vpon them: after the fayned inſtance of <hi>Ixion,</hi>
and the Aegle: they became vntimely ſutors for that,
which not long before (thorow their owne ende<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uors)
they might eaſilie haue conquered vnto them
ſelues.</p>
                  <p>Vpon this Text you muſt geue me leaue tonote,
that theſe Petitioners were onlie ſuch, whoſe whole
<pb n="2" facs="tcp:16713:4"/>
liuings did lie ſubiect to the dailie incurſions of the
<hi>Lamballiſts.</hi> Thoſe which dwelt but ſix leagues from
<hi>Lamballa,</hi> were neuer moued at our departure, no
more doe the Britanes otherwiſe apprehende this
general quarrel, then in regard of ſome particular in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tereſt:
which error, the King (being aſſiſted with her
Maieſties Forces) may eaſilie reforme.</p>
                  <p>The Prince being taught by former experience
that thoſe fewe particularities could bring no great
aduancement to the Kinges ſeruice, continued his
former determination of carrying his armie into the
South, where a great ſupplie of forces was promiſed
by Monſieur <hi>de la Verdun,</hi> and others: and according
to that, our army diſlodged from S. <hi>Brieux,</hi> vpon the
one and twentie day of Auguſt. That night we came
to <hi>Kerſoe,</hi> the 23. to <hi>Plemy,</hi> the 25. to <hi>Collinie,</hi> where the
Prince receiued information, that the Duke <hi>de Mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>curie</hi>
was diſlodged from <hi>Dinant,</hi> and marched that
night toward a ſdmal village called <hi>Brun:</hi> by the opor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tunitie
of which place, he might, to his reaſonable
aduantage, charge vs in our next daies march. <hi>Brun</hi> is
ſomewhat more then two leagues from <hi>Collinie,</hi> and
not a quarter of a league from the hie-way, by which
we were to paſſe vnto S. <hi>Meyn.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Vppon which intelligence, the Prince, with
ſome of his principal Counſellers, came to my Lord
Generals lodging, which then was an Engliſh mile
from <hi>Collinie,</hi> where Monſieur <hi>de la Verdun,</hi> dilating
all the circumſtances of that late receiued aduertiſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
concluded with theſe two doubtfull conſide<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rations.
The firſt, that in regard of the enemies pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſes
to croſſe our paſſage into the South partes of
<pb facs="tcp:16713:5"/>
Brittanie, it was neceſſarie to conſider, whether our
Forces were ſufficient to ſecond our defences. The
other, that in holding a right forward courſe, the
Duke <hi>de Mercurie</hi> might cut vs from al ſupplie of vic<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tuals,
comming from <hi>Reines,</hi> and <hi>Monford,</hi> by taking
his lodging at S. <hi>Meyn.</hi> Vnto theſe two doubtes, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
the onelie matter of moment propounded by
Monſieur <hi>de la Verdun,</hi> my L. Generall moſt grauelie
and reſolutelie anſwered, that the Prince, Monſieur
<hi>de la Verdun</hi> himſelfe, and the reſt of the Princes
Counſaile, after a long deliberation, and moſt ear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſt
opportunitie, hauing embarked themſelves, and
him into this courſe, it was not now to looke into
their weakeneſſe, which before ſhould haue beene
weighed with better iudgement. Wherby ſince their
reputation were ſo deepelie engaged, hee nowe
thought them all tied in honour, to march directlie
forward, without anie regard to their ſmal numbers;
and that to take any other courſe, would altogether
ſauour of an exceeding feare, vnto the ſecond, that
Duke <hi>de Mercurie</hi> could no more anoy vs by putting
himſelfe betweene <hi>Reynes</hi> and our armie, then we, by
poſſeſſing thoſe paſſages which leade to <hi>Dinant</hi> and
S. <hi>Malo,</hi> from which place he was likewiſe to attend
his greateſt reliefe.</p>
                  <p>Theſe reaſons being highlie approoued by the
prince, and Monſieur <hi>de la Verdun</hi> himſelfe, who wil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>linglie
would haue driuen a wider courſe by <hi>Malle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>troit</hi>
and <hi>Plermer,</hi> it was concluded, that by breake of
daie following, the armie ſhould diſlodge, &amp; marche
directlie towards S. <hi>Meyn,</hi> and that foorth with cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taine
light horſes ſhould be ſent foorth, to diſcouer
<pb n="3" facs="tcp:16713:5"/>
whether the enemie was that night come to <hi>Brun,</hi>
or not. The order of march, and the place whereun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to
the army ſhould the next day march, was referred
to the morning conſultation, at the place of <hi>Kende<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>
                        <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                           <desc>•</desc>
                        </gap>ous.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>At the Councel, I remember, Monſieur <hi>de la
Verdun</hi> would needes preſcribe a ſolemne platte of
battell, againſt the next daies expected encounter,
but that deuiſe was readelie altered by my Lord Ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neral,
who affirmed, that al formes of fighting were
euermore tied to the circumſtances of thoſe places,
wherein men were to fight, and therefore, not to be
determined, til the place were firſt viewed.</p>
                  <p>The 26. our armie diſlodged from <hi>Collinie;</hi> and
becauſe the Prince was certainly enformed by thoſe
light horſe, ſent foorth the night before, to diſcouer
that Duke <hi>Mercurie</hi> was not come to <hi>Brun,</hi> it was re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolued
that the armie ſhould march that day to Saint
<hi>Meyn:</hi> But through the vnreadines of al things ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pertaining
to the Cannon, whereby the beſt part of
the morning was waſted, and the diſhabilitie of our
weak men, in ſo ſhort a time to performe a march of
ſuch length, this courſe was cutte off by the waſte,
and at night we came to <hi>Medrimack,</hi> which ſtandeth
in the mid way betwixt <hi>Collinie,</hi> and Saint <hi>Meyn.</hi> At
<hi>Medrimack</hi> the Prince was truelie enformed, that the
Duke de <hi>Mercurie,</hi> the day before in al ſecrecie, about
ſeuen of the clocke in the euening, diſlodged from
<hi>Dinant</hi> with his armie, and was that night come to
<hi>Plenaden,</hi> where this day he repoſed himſelfe, mea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning
thereby (as afterwarde it appeared) the better
to couer his intention, which was, with a ſpeedie
<pb facs="tcp:16713:6"/>
march in the night following, to poſſeſſe Saint <hi>Meyn</hi>
before we ſhould ſuſpect his departure from <hi>Plena<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>den,</hi>
which is foure Leagues from S. <hi>Meyn.</hi> From <hi>Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>drimack</hi>
thether are counted but three leagues: but
this fraud was eaſilie diſcouered by my Lord Gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rall,
who aduiſed the Prince, our Groſe being not
able to performe that march, through the comber of
the Cannon, and the great number of weake men,
that Monſieur <hi>de la Verdun,</hi> hauing foure hundred
of our ableſt Footemen ioyned to his fourſcore Cu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>races,
and not aboue fiue hundred Harquebuzers, a
cheual ſhould diſlodge about midnight, and aſſaie,
if by a ſpeedie diligence he coulde diſappoint the e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nemie
of his intended lodging at S. <hi>Meyn;</hi> which
was accordingly performed.</p>
                  <p>My Lord Generall, moſt exceedinglie carefull
vpon al hazards to ſecond theſe troupes, cauſed our
armie to diſlodge from <hi>Medrimack</hi> the next mor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning,
almoſt two howers before day, which was the
ſeuen and twentieth. In our march the Prince re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiued
aduertiſement from Monſieur <hi>de la Verdun,</hi>
that Saint <hi>Meyn</hi> was inueſted with his Forces, and
that nothing could be diſcouered of the enemies in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tention
that way: So that all ſeemed to be very ſure
on our ſide. But my Lord Generall ſuſpecting that
which in trueth folowed, perſwaded the Prince to
aduance with his Caualarie in ſo much the greater
ſpeede towards S. <hi>Meyn.</hi> And to the ende that our
Footemen might follow with the better haſt, his
Lordſhip commanded the Cannon and baggage to
be placed after the Rerewarde, and for the guarde
thereof appointed certaine Launceknightes. The
<pb n="4" facs="tcp:16713:6"/>
euent did ſhew ſome ſpirite of diuination of what
ſhould follow. For the Prince had not beene three
quarters of an houre in S. <hi>Meyn,</hi> when a very warme
report was brought vnto him, that the Duke <hi>de Mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>curie</hi>
with his whole armie, was within halfe a league
of the Towne. The trueth of theſe matters was verie
ſenſible, for the reporter brought with him two Spa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſh
Captaines, whom he and his companions, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
all but common Soldiers, had preſently made
priſoners: the one of theſe two did afterward ſweare
<hi>Bota dios,</hi> that hee was taken <hi>per Caritad</hi> in their
march, and going to their ſuccours; they were ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken
by thoſe French companions, which came the<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
<hi>A la picoree,</hi> not two hundred pace from the
head of the Duke <hi>de Mercurie</hi> his armie.</p>
                  <p>Some wil ſay, that Monſieur <hi>de la Verdun,</hi> did
this day forget himſelfe: for comming by ſixe of the
clock in the morning to Saint <hi>Meyn,</hi> hee did neither
ſend foorth his light horſes, <hi>(pour batre le ſtrado,)</hi>
whereby the enemies approaches might haue been
aduertiſed in time conuenient; nor imploy the ſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uice
of his foote in garding the enemies, but in a
plaine ſecuritie of all that might happen, he lodged
himſelf and his in a village, halfe a league from Saint
<hi>Meyn,</hi> quite oppoſite from the way the enemies
ſhould take, and left our foote embattailed in the
towne, rather for a <hi>Parade,</hi> then to any other ſeruice<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able
purpoſe. By the like careleſneſſe in Monſieur <hi>de
la Verdun,</hi> the Countie <hi>Soyſons</hi> was two yeeres ſince
taken at <hi>Shateau-giron,</hi> his armie abſolutely defeated,
and himſelfe did meete with a very narrowe eſcape:
but our leiſure at that time did not verie well ſerue
<pb facs="tcp:16713:7"/>
vs to diſpute of errors.</p>
                  <p>The Allarum amongſt our French, you may
be ſure, was verie hotte, the Prince confuſed, and
thoſe about him, who in calmes would ouer-rule all
councels; in this little ſtorme did knowe, neuer a
point in the Compaſſe. The enemy was within halfe
a league of S. <hi>Meyn,</hi> Monſieur <hi>de la Verdun</hi> had beſto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wed
himſelfe and his troupes ſo farre, or farther off
from vs. The French horſe that came with the
Prince, had alreadie lodged themſelues in villages,
and where the Prince was, were onlie left thoſe four
hundred, ſent the night before with Monſieur <hi>de la
Verdun,</hi> and my Lord Generals Cornets of horſe:
Our Vantgarde was at the leaſt a long league and a
halfe from vs. In which harde plight, neither the
Prince, nor thoſe about him, could apprehende anie
other courſe of proceeding, but what they did ſee
with the eies of a moſt deſperate feare. But my Lord
Generall, with a moſt chearefull countenance, and
excellent perſwaſions, full of all comfortable aſſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rance,
did firſt winne the Prince vnto a better opi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion
of his fortune, and then, to repoſe himſelfe on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lie
vpon his ſeruice. By his Lordſhips commande<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment,
the Engliſh troupes were preſentlie drawn out
of the towne, and by himſelfe placed in thoſe waies
which did leade directly towards the enemie. Firſt,
the horſe were appointed to aduance the foot ſome
quarter of a mile. The dikes and hedges were lyned
with ſhotte, to the beſt aduauntage that might bee
thought on: and in the high-way which was ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>what
large, our pikes were diſpoſed into three ſeue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rall
ſtandes. Meane while, the Prince had ſent for
<pb n="5" facs="tcp:16713:7"/>
Monſieur <hi>de la Verdun,</hi> and the reſt; ſo that hauing a
greater encreaſe of horſe, diſcouerers were ſent ſom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>what
further off, to ſee what courſe the Duke <hi>de Mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>curie</hi>
did take, who being certainlie enformed, that
the Prince had alreadie inueſted S. <hi>Meyn,</hi> became ſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>denlie
more perplexed in the field, then his Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>treimen
were in the towne: his armie was excee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding
weary, for the ſame had marched all that night.
To make anie faire retreite they could not; to tarrie
and fight with vs they durſt not; much leſſe to force
vs from our lodging at S. <hi>Meyn,</hi> where they ſuppoſed
all our armie was: So that the confuſion amongſt
the enemie became verie great, and it was verely be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leeued,
that at that time, with two thouſand Engliſh
men, the Duke <hi>de Mercurie</hi> and all his armie, might
eaſilie haue beene defeated. But how ſo euer, cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taine
it is, that in a verie gentle feare hee retired to
<hi>Luedilliack,</hi> which did verie wel appeare, for not fin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding
that place of ſuch ſtrength as hee ordinarilie v<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeth
to encampe in, and nothing liking our neere
neighborhood, <hi>Luedilliack</hi> being but one league and
a halfe from S. <hi>Meyn,</hi> hee was contented to diſlodge
from that place. After that the <hi>Logas</hi> for the <hi>Cor-de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gard
Fiers</hi> were laide together, and to encampe at
Saint <hi>Iohn.</hi> Whereby the Duke <hi>de Mercurie</hi> did find
the meane, to put a reaſonable good riuer betweene
him and vs, and to lie two long leagues and a halfe
from S <hi>Meyn.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Thus with a handfull of men, and my Lord Ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nerals
carefull foreſight, the Prince was deliuered
from the greateſt hazard that euer he was in, and we
became quiet poſſeſſors of our lodging at S. <hi>Meyn,</hi>
                     <pb facs="tcp:16713:8"/>
which was a ſeruice of great conſequence, princi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pallie,
in regard of the multitude of our ſicke men,
who otherwiſe had beene left vnto many harde diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>comfits:
beſides, the enemies diſgrace hereby recey<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ued,
was not little.</p>
                  <p>As for the reſt of the armie, they came not vnto
vs in two long houres after the enemies retreit, and
it was almoſt night before the arriual of our Canon.
This is the ſumme of that daies worke.</p>
                  <p>And becauſe it was the nexte day founde that
the Duke <hi>de Mercurie</hi> diſlodged not, the Prince
was aduiſed by ſome, in whoſe heartes (peraduen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture)
ſome relicks of the former daies feare yet re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mained,
to follow his courſe towards <hi>Reines,</hi> which
he might very wel doe, hauing aboundantlie ſatiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fied
his reputation in his laſte confronting the ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mie,
and croſſing his purpoſes. But my Lorde Ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nerall
directlie oppoſed himſelfe againſt this coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cell;
affirming, that if we diſlodged firſt, the enemie
would be encouraged to purſue vs, and beating ſtill
vpon the taile of our weake armie, trauel the ſame
with continuall paine and trouble, which could not
be tollerated; beſides the performance of his former
vaunt, which was, that he would driue vs before him
into <hi>Reines.</hi> That it was therefore better for the
Prince, to ſend for ſuch ſuccors as might be drawen
from <hi>Reines,</hi> and other places not farre off, to make
good the place whereof they were alreadie poſſeſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed,
and to attend, either the enimies firſt diſlodging,
or ſome good opportunitie, whereby hee might be
forced vnto the ſame.</p>
                  <p>This counſel was folowed, and ſuch diligence
<pb n="6" facs="tcp:16713:8"/>
vſed in the execution thereof, that by the next mor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning
two hundred horſe were come vnto vs, and
two Cannons ſent from <hi>Reines,</hi> were alreadie ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uanced
as farre as <hi>Monford.</hi> Vpon the arriuall of this
ſmall ſupplie, it was preſently reſolued, that our ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mie
ſhould diſlodge the next day, and encamp with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in
a quarter of a league of Saint <hi>Iohn.</hi> But the Duke
<hi>de Mercury</hi> (who al this while did but ſeek to coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tenance
himſelfe with his ſtaie at that place) vnder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtanding
the reſolution of our armie, diſlodged the
next morning before tenne of the clock, and mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ched
foure leagues, vnto a village called <hi>Ereat,</hi> where
(for him ſelfe and his Spaniardes) hee founde a lod<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ging
of great ſtrength.</p>
                  <p>Certaine knowledge being geuen, that the Duke
<hi>de Mercurie</hi> had made his retreate to <hi>Ereat,</hi> the Prince
ſtreitelie commaunded, that all our armie ſhould be
in readineſſe by nine of the clocke in the night, to
march towardes the enemie. For it was preſuppo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed,
that by the aduauntage of that march in the
night, we ſhould fall vppon the Duke <hi>de Mercurie</hi> his
army, weary, and not looking for vs, and ſo perform
ſome great peece of ſeruice; or at his next mornings
riſing, diſtreſſe the rereward of his armie. Our ſicke
men and baggage were left at S. <hi>Meyn,</hi> and an hun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dred
of ours for their gard.</p>
                  <p>My Lord Generall being wel acquainted with
the weakeneſſe of our armie, and obſeruing the thin
repaire of thoſe that were ſent for, did very much
oppoſe himſelfe againſt this courſe, the rather, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe
at that time ther was not one in our army, that
<pb facs="tcp:16713:9"/>
coulde iuſtly enforme the ſtate of the Enemies lod<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ging.</p>
                  <p>But the Prince, to ſatisfie my Lord herein, told
him in great ſecreſie, that al was but <hi>Pour fair la Meyn;</hi>
and that after ſome two leagues march, it was meant
that we ſhould returne. How be it, in our march one
peece ſo pulde on another, that <hi>la Mein</hi> was quite
forgotten, and ſomething before day light, we were
come within two miles of the enemies lodging:
where, (and that not without good cauſe) a ſtande
was made, and it was ſolemnlie demaunded, what
could be done vpon the enemie. The ſtate of their
lodging was freſhly enquired after, whereunto an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwere
was made by a French Gentleman, dwelling
in thoſe partes, that there were but two Riuers be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tweene
vs and the enemies <hi>Groſe</hi> of his armie: wher<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of
the one was hardlie to be foorded. And that from
thence, the way to <hi>Ereat</hi> was exceeding ſtreite. By
meanes whereof, wee did now begin to learne how
our Canon might haue beene loſt, and our enemies
notablie engaged. Vpon which conſiderations, eue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rie
man began to diſauow this councell: firſt <hi>la Ver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dun,</hi>
then <hi>Momertin, Baſtine,</hi> and the reſt: yet God of
his goodnes did ſaue all our honeſties; for while the
Prince, my Lord General, and the reſt were in coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cell,
ſome of vs had taken a prieſt and a peazaunt: by
whom they were informed, that a compaine of the
enemies hargabuzers a cheuall, did lodge within
halfe a league of vs, and that there were nothing
more eaſie, then the cutting them in peeces. To the
ſeazing of this pray, <hi>la Verdun,</hi> and Monſieur <hi>de Ba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtine,</hi>
                     <pb n="7" facs="tcp:16713:9"/>
with thirtie Curaſſes, and three hundred Har<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gabuzers
a cheuall, were preſentlie ſent foorth, (for
in ſodaine enterpriſes it was thought better to vſe
the ſeruice of thoſe French ſhot on horſeback, then
on foote.</p>
                  <p>Theſe following their guides, found not onlie
that compaine, but three French Regiments lodged
<hi>al eſtart,</hi> euerie man in a ſounde ſleepe, and not ſo
much as one Centronel to geue the allarum, which
being wel perceiued by <hi>Baſtine,</hi> he willinglie would
haue ſent for foure hundred of our ſhot and pikes,
wherewith queſtionles all the skirtes of the enemies
armie might haue beene handſomelie cutte off. But
<hi>la Verdun,</hi> either in an emulation towards vs, in too
great impatiencie with himſelfe, with his Curaſſes
farre inough off, he ſent thoſe <hi>Herga a Chi</hi> to the en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terpriſe,
who finding no kinde of reſiſtance, ſlewe
an hundred and twentie of the enemie. In which
number Captaine <hi>Meſſandere</hi> was one: and at that
time <hi>la Mott Cheure</hi> was taken priſoner, who com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maunded
another compaine of <hi>Herga a Chi.</hi> The reſt
which were not, but might very well in like ſorte
haue beene aſſayled, receiued the allarum by their
companions laſte cries, and ſo ſaued themſelues.
The armie likewiſe warned by theſe, did preſentlie
put themſelues in armes.</p>
                  <p>This ſeruice thus perfourmed, wee did ſtande
three long houres imbattelled vppon a faire ſpatious
heath, not halfe a league from the Duke <hi>de Mercury</hi>
his Armie, but when it was perceyued, that neither
honour, nor loſſe, could driue him vnto a tryall of
<pb facs="tcp:16713:10"/>
Armes (although beſides his French forces, it was
certen that he had then with him aboue three thou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſand
Spanyards) that it was not poſsible to paſſe any
further without apparant loſſe, the Prince thought
good to commaund our retreite.</p>
                  <p>Wee poor ſoules were not this day able to march
twelue thouſand ſtrong: but had you ſeene theyr
notable reſolutions, and earneſt deſires to fight, you
would peraduenture greeue that ſuch men, and a
commaunder of my Lords woorth, ſhould be expo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed
into ſo great an inequalitie as hitherto wee haue
mette with. For I proteſt vnto you before the liuing
God, that our ſoldiours onely haue borne the en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tire
burden of this Sommers ſeruice. At <hi>Lamballa</hi> we
were not aſſiſted with three hundred French, which
may ſeeme very ſtraunge, but what I write is moſt
true: and how farre my Lord Generall will in all
ſeruice aduenture his owne perſon, is ſo well known
vnto you, that I ſhal not neede to mention the ſame.
Vpon euerie opinion of encounter with the Spany<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ards,
, a faire blew ſcarfe (in likelyhoode preſented
by ſome honourable Lady) is faſtened to the ende
of his Pike: for his Lordſhippe vnderſtanding that
Don <hi>Iohn de Laguilla</hi> had vſed ſome braue ſpeeches:
did ſende him worde by Monſieur <hi>Gibrian,</hi> that by
that fauour hee would make himſelf knowne at their
firſt meeting.</p>
                  <p>After our returne to Saint <hi>Meyn,</hi> the Prince per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiuing
that the Duke <hi>de Mercury</hi> meant that daye
to diſlodge from <hi>Ereat,</hi> and that the place of our
abode, did yeelde no kinde of comfort vnto our
<pb n="8" facs="tcp:16713:10"/>
weake armie, other then ſuch as came thither from
<hi>Reines</hi> and <hi>Vittrie,</hi> which was ſometime cutte off
by the way, thought good likewiſe to diſlodge the
day following, and ſo for this time the Duke <hi>de Mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>curie</hi>
and wee did part compaine. He vppon the thir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tith
day leauing <hi>Ereat,</hi> did take the way towards <hi>Ioce<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lin:</hi>
we vppon the day following diſlodged from S.
<hi>Meyn,</hi> and ſo to <hi>Hendet:</hi> the ſecond of September
to <hi>Breall,</hi> the third to <hi>Noyall,</hi> where the Prince did ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cord
vnto vs twentie daies reſt at <hi>Shatteau-grion,</hi> for
the refreſhing of our weake men: at this place wee
arriued the fourth of September.</p>
                  <p>The day following, my Lord Generall was
ſolempnly inuited by the principall Magiſtrates of
<hi>Reines</hi> to viſite their Cittie, and the thirde day af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
was receyued into the ſame with all thoſe te<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtimonies
that might aſſure a moſt kinde and frendly
welcome.</p>
                  <p>The Prince in the meane time hauing three
hundred men, and three Cannons from <hi>Vittrie,</hi> did
inueſt the Caſtle of <hi>Chattillion,</hi> vpon the ſeuenth of
this inſtant. But after three dayes triall, finding
thoſe forces nothing ſufficient (for he had but thoſe
three hundred French, and fiue hundred Launce-knights)
he ſent vnto <hi>Reines</hi> for ſixe Cannons more,
and to my Lord Generall, in all earneſtnes, to aſſiſte
him with ſixe hundred Engliſh. His Lordſhippe
conſidering, that after ſuch a deduction, the remain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der
would be verie weake, and by ſuch a ſeperation
ſubiect vnto hazard, thought good with all his com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>panies
to remoue to Saint <hi>Aubin de Cormer:</hi> whereby
<pb facs="tcp:16713:11"/>
the ſtrength of our Armie might ſtande ſtill vnited,
and the Prince, according to his deſire, readily e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nough
aſsiſted. For from Saint <hi>Aubin</hi> to <hi>Chattillion</hi>
are but three little leagues. In the meane ſeaſon his
Lordſhippe ſent two hundred ſhotte and pikes, to at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tend
the Cannon of <hi>Reines,</hi> whoſe ſeruice afterwards
the Prince vſed to great purpoſe.</p>
                  <p>Thus not hauing ſtaide ſixe dayes at <hi>Shatteau-giron,</hi>
wee diſlodged vppon the tenth of September,
and incamped that night at <hi>Shatteau-burga,</hi> the next
day to Saint <hi>Aubin.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>The Prince hauing receyued thoſe Canons ſent
from <hi>Reines,</hi> and planted the ſame, vppon the twelfth
of September, were diſcharged ſome loſt volleys vp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pon
the defences of the Caſtle: The morning fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowing
my Lord came to the Prince with three hun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dred
Engliſh more, and then the battery was purſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
with ſuch furie, that by twelue of the clocke the
breach was made very faire and aſſaultable: which
beeing well perceiued by the defendants, they came
to a parley, and from the Prince receyued theſe laſt
conditions: That all Gentlemen and Captains with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in
the Caſtle ſhould become priſoners: That the ſol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diours
ſhould haue their liues, only except twentie,
which ſhould reſt at the Prince his diſcretion: for he
ment to make ſome examplary puniſhment of them.</p>
                  <p>While the enemie did entertaine ſomewhat too
long time in the acceptance of theſe conditions, our
launce knights in a hungrie deſire after ſpoyle, drew
themſelues (vncommaunded) towardes the aſſault:
my Lord Generall perceiuing the ſame, and doub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting
<pb n="9" facs="tcp:16713:11"/>
that ſome touch in honour to the Prince might
thereby ariſe, partly by perſwaſions, and ſometimes
by threatnings, did ſtay them from that purpoſe a
long half houre: but in concluſion they offered vio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lence
to their Coronel, diſobeyed all their comman<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders,
forced the breach, where they founde no reſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtance,
and of two hundred and thereeſcore that were
within the Caſtle, left not twentie aliue. But in the
eager purſuite after ſpoyle, they fiered (vnawares)
ſome barrels of powder, with the furie whereof thir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie
of them were preſently ſlaine, and at leaſt fiftie
more came from thence, the moſt miſerable crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures
that euer I did behold. The iudgement of God
was moſt iuſtly executed vppon them both; in theſe
for their diſobedience; in the enemie, for their no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>torious
ſpoyles and infinite outrages committed vp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pon
the country: it is conſtantly affirmed, that theſe
companions did yearely ſpoyle <hi>La vall, Vittrie,</hi> and
<hi>Reines,</hi> of more then twelue thouſand crownes.</p>
                  <p>They of <hi>Fougiers</hi> were ſo terrified at the taking
of <hi>Shattillion,</hi> that in doubt of our next remoue to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wardes
them, they did beginne the verie ſame day
to burne their Suburbs, which (peraduenture) was
but a needleſſe feare: for in plaine Engliſh, we haue
neither men, nor meanes, to vndertake the ſiege of
ſuch a place.</p>
                  <p>Monſieur <hi>de la Verdun</hi> did leaue the Prince at
<hi>I. Iendit,</hi> and promiſed to return within three weekes
with three thouſande footemen, and fiue hundred
horſe. His preparations (for ought that I perceiue)
doe come but ſlowlie forwarde, and yet I know the
<pb facs="tcp:16713:12"/>
King hath of late vrgentlie haſtened the ſame, our
men doe now begin to die, and that verie faſte: ſo
that without a preſent ſupplie, wee are like to haue
but a poore armie.</p>
                  <p>The Spaniardes paie arriued at <hi>Blanett,</hi> about
the eighteenth of Auguſt laſt. The ſame was brought
thether in foure Galliaſſes. The Duke <hi>de Mercurie</hi>
