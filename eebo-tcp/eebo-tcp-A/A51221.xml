            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>

            <p>OUR Lord made a private entry into the World, without pomp, or force, neither attended with a numerous and ſplendid train, nor at the head of a great Army: And although the deſign of his coming was to erect a Kingdom, and to bring men of all ranks and conditions into ſubjection to it, yet he uſed neither worldly polity, nor arms to accompliſh it. For as his Kingdom was of a different nature, from all thoſe which had been before it, ſo he took a quite contrary method to form and ſupport it. He was ſo far from enſlaving the perſons of men, and ſpilling their bloud to encreaſe his own glory, and from putting the Countries about him under a contribution to carry on his Wars, and up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hold the majeſty of his Court, that he did condeſcend to make his firſt appearance in a Stable, and to take upon himſelf the form of a Servant.</p>
            <p>The dominion he intended, was to be over the mind, upon which outward force can take no place: and to tranſplant the deſires and affections of the Soul from this lower world, to the glories and pleaſures of Heaven: for the effecting whereof, grandeur, riches and power are ſo far from being neceſſary means, that they often prove moſt fatal impediments. And accordingly <hi>Chriſt,</hi> without a fund of treaſure, without Soldiers, or the
<pb n="2" facs="tcp:59519:5"/>
help of any earthly intereſt, gave Laws to the World; and diſpoſed men to be ſubject to them, by the authori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty of his Divine Miracles, and the convincing efficacy of his Sermons and holy life: and his Diſciples preacht his Doctrines, made them ſpread, and be received by the power onely of plain perſuaſion, by ſetting an example according to the rules they had taught, and bearing te<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtimony to the truth of their Doctrine by patiently ſuffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring perſecution for it.</p>
            <p>To tax the World, and draw the Sword, were things ſo foreign to his purpoſe, ſo utterly repugnant to the great end of his coming, the redemption of Mankind from the power and guilt of ſin, that on the contrary he has declared it is a matter, in it ſelf, <hi>eaſier for a Camel to paſs through the eye of a needle,<note place="margin">Mat. 19.24.</note> than for a rich man to enter into the Kingdom of God,</hi>
               <note place="margin">Mat. 26.52.</note> and <hi>that they that take the ſword, ſhall periſh with the ſword.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Whereupon moſt remarkable was the patience of the firſt Chriſtians under their ſufferings, and their peace of mind and joy, and ready ſubmiſſion to the divine Will in the bittereſt trials, was ſo beyond example, that as no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing did more <hi>abate the rage</hi> of their <hi>per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſecutours,</hi>

               <hi>than their chearfulneſs under perſecution,</hi> ſo they added more to the Church by dying for the Cauſe of <hi>Chriſt,</hi> than they had done before by preaching it up.</p>
            <p>Indeed our Saviour was the firſt that did effectually recommend this paſſive virtue to the World, and furniſht men with ſuch true arguments to bear the Croſs, as made the moſt afflicted ſtate not onely ſupportable, but to be preferr'd before all the happineſs of this life. It is true, the Philoſophers had deeply conſider'd the cauſes of humane miſery, and apply'd themſelves with all ſtudy
<pb n="3" facs="tcp:59519:5"/>
and diligence to find remedies for it. But they wan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted ſound principles to build their diſcourſes upon, made to compoſe the diſorders of the mind, and ſo their rules for the government of the calamitous be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>came liable to infinite and unanſwerable exceptions; and all their receipts, though adorned with eloquence and the countenance of Philoſophy prov'd dry and comfortleſs to men in pain and trouble: <note n="(b)" place="margin">Marcus Tullius <hi>mul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ta quidem praeclarè, &amp; egregiè de pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tientia, &amp; contemtu ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſae fortunae diſputare noverat; exilium tamen ſuum ubique diutiſſimè deplorat, &amp; ſui temporis calami<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tate lamentanda mollis, &amp; propemodum effaeminatus apparet.</hi> J. Pieri. <hi>de infelic. Literat. lib.</hi> 2. <hi>p.</hi> 99.</note> none ſinking more under their burthen, or making more effeminate complaints of the weight of it, than ſome of theſe Philoſophers who had writ the wiſeſt maxims about patience and the contempt of adverſe fortune.</p>
            <p>And that which chiefly render'd them unfit for ſo great an undertaking was their falſe notions of God, and their ignorance of another life, which ſometimes they ſeem'd to believe, and ſometimes they deny'd, and when they were on the affirming ſide, if we ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerve with what weak and unſatistactory arguments they endeavour to prove and maintain the point, there will be reaſon to conclude, that their doubts and dark<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs as to theſe things would have continued to this day, had not our Lord brought life and immortality to light by the Goſpel.</p>
            <p>For as it is not to be conceiv'd that a man ſhould bring himſelf to be quiet and eaſie under an evil that preſſes hard upon him, unleſs it be in hopes by his pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tience to get rid of it, or to mend his condition: So it is manifeſt that they, who believe little or nothing themſelves of a future ſtate, cannot be ſtored with true arguments to prevail upon a man to be patient under a ſequeſtration from the happineſs and pleaſures
<pb n="4" facs="tcp:59519:6"/>
of this life. For where will they find juſt motives to reduce him to a compoſed mind, who by a fire or a ſtorm has his Eſtate ſwept away, or by a malitious ſtory his reputation blaſted, or by the acute pains of a Diſeaſe his Body weakned beyond hopes of recovery, if neither they nor he are poſſeſt with a perſuaſion, that, being gone off this ſtage, they ſhall live again, and receive the recompence of their vertue? and with what conſcience could the Philoſophers upbraid and reproach men in diſtreſs for their grief and complaints, paſſions moſt natural to their condition, when all they could offer to comfort them, fell ſhort of an equivalent to their preſent loſſes and misfortunes?</p>
            <p>He then onely can be allow'd to be the true Phy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſician for the mind, who is able to aſſure his Patients, that even the malice of thoſe, who torment their Bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dies, ſhall never have power to reach and harm their Souls; and that for their ſufferings in this world, they ſhall receive an hundred fold in the next. And as <hi>Chriſt</hi> alone is the Authour of thoſe means which will up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hold the Spirit in the moſt ſorrowfull condition, ſo he did likewiſe foreſee, there ſhould be no men expoſed to ſeverer trials than the Profeſſours of his Religion, which is the reaſon he exhorts his Diſciples to <hi>poſſeſs their ſouls in patience,</hi> and that the Apoſtles do ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moniſh their new Converts of the <hi>need they have of patience, that after they have done the will of God, they might receive the reward.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>In managing of this argument, I ſhall uſe the fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowing method.<list>

                  <item>IV. Prove that no Religion or Philoſophy furniſhes men with ſuch true and powerfull motives to pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tience as Chriſtianity does.</item>
               </list>
            </p>
            <p n="1">I. I am to explain the nature of Patience. By Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tience, in the moſt comprehenſive ſenſe of it, we are to underſtand that Chriſtian vertue, whereby with a calm and even mind, we do not onely bear pains, in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>juries, loſſes and reproaches, but perform all thoſe duties, that are difficult, tedious and irkſome to fleſh and bloud, which our Religion does require, and when it is for the ſake of our Lord.</p>
            <p>Or Patience is that vertue which diſpoſeth us not onely to ſubmit to the wrong and miſery, which by the cruelty and injuſtice of others may happen unto us, but obſtinately to deny the importunity of our ſenſual appetites, in order to promote the intereſts of piety, and the glory of God. In a word, Patience is that bleſt temper of mind which enables us with all cheerfulneſs both to doe and ſuffer the will of God.</p>
            <p>Patience then is not ſo properly any particular ver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tue, as that happy diſpoſition in our Souls, which has a general influence upon all vertue. It is the kee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ping the Paſſions within their due bounds, free from commotion and diſorder, without which, a man is not capable of real happineſs, or to be the maſter of any one vertue.</p>
            <p>For as we are obliged by our Religion to be meek, ſo what pretence can he make to that vertue, who is uneaſie to himſelf and others, let things go as they will, and clamours ſtill in what condition ſoever God puts him? it is our duty to be mercifull, but who ſo
<pb n="6" facs="tcp:59519:7"/>

We are commanded to watch and pray without ceaſing, and we may as well preſume to ſee without light, as to continue the performance of theſe duties without Chriſtian patience. The many benefits of patience are elegantly heap'd together by <hi>Tertul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lian.</hi>

            </p>
            <p>But for the more full underſtanding of the nature of Patience, and to render it beneficial to us in our converſations, I will preſent you with ſome of the
<pb n="7" facs="tcp:59519:7"/>
conſiderable inſtances in which the Chriſtian Man does exerciſe his patience.</p>
            <p n="1">1. The firſt inſtance ſhall be this, that as none of the difficulties he does find in the duties of Religion do make him lay thoſe duties aſide, ſo neither the number of temptations, nor the frequency with which they aſſault him, do cauſe him to give over his watch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, and making reſiſtance againſt them; or to fling away the ſpiritual weapons with which God has ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med him for a defence. His patience has given him leave to conſider the whole matter, and he is convin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ced, that the greateſt difficulties in Religion, as in all Arts and Sciences, do happen at the firſt, and that when the hardſhips of the beginning are once paſt over, the ſervice of God will prove not onely eaſsie, but very pleaſant: and that with the ſame, or leſs labour, than a man can raiſe an eſtate, get a name, or become powerfull, he may fill his Soul with the ſolid and ſincere pleaſures of Religion. A Poſſeſſion incomparably more to be eſteem'd than riches, fame, or power. For though a man can never ſo clip the wings of his riches, as that they may not, in a mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, all fly away; never ſo ſecure his fame, as that all on a ſudden it may not quite periſh by the ſame fickle breath, which gave it being; never ſo diſcipline and govern his arm'd powers, as that they may not all turn upon him, and deſtroy him, yet neither the envy, nor the ſtrength of the whole world can rifle his mind of that tranquillity and joy, which ſprings up from the conſcience of things well done, and the faithfull diſcharge of his duty to God.</p>
            <p>Moreover why ſhould we grudge at the pains to be taken in a godly life, when the reward of them will be ſo great and inexpreſſible? it is alſo fit and reaſonable that there ſhould be ſome hard parts in the buſineſs of
<pb n="8" facs="tcp:59519:8"/>
Religion, to the end that the pleaſures which it does create, might make the more deep and laſting impreſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſions upon us, and teach us to ſet the higher rate upon them, and to be very ſolicitous and fearfull, leſt by any falſe ſtep we loſe thoſe bleſſings, which coſt us ſo much care and toil.</p>
            <p>Beſides, there will be ſtill leſs cauſe to complain of the labour that goes to the making of a good man, when we ſhall conſider that the uneaſineſſes in God's ſervice do proceed from our own fault: for what can be more agreeable to the native ſentiments of our mind than the Laws of our God, before we contract ſinfull habits and cuſtoms, and thereby alter the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plexion and very conſtitution of our nature, and ſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fer our ſelves to be enſlaved to the luſts of the world and the fleſh? And it is but juſt we ſhould taſte of the fruit of our own planting. And though the paths that lead to Heaven prove ſtrait and ſometimes rugged, yet Chriſtian patience will ſo cheer up our drooping hearts, that we ſhall not return back out of them, nor go aſtray from them, nor ſit down in de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpair of ever arriving at the end of our race. We ſhall not fail to work out our ſalvation with fear and trembling, while it frequently refreſheth our memo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry, and animates our courage with the pleaſing aſſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rance, that it is God who works in us both to will, and to doe of his good pleaſure. And the more work lies on our hands, the greater diligence we ſhall give to make our calling and election ſure.</p>
            <p n="2">2. If the Petitions the patient man puts up to Heaven be not preſently granted, he does not grow weary of his devotions, and give them over, as if God neither heard him, nor had any regard to what he deſired. For there be many good reaſons which convince him, that God's time to anſwer his Prayers
<pb n="9" facs="tcp:59519:8"/>
is the beſt, and that he ought ſubmiſſively to wait for it. Perhaps the thing he prays for, is not proper for his condition, and might doe him harm if he had it. Or perhaps he does not addreſs himſelf to his Prayers, with that juſt preparation which may teſtify his ſenſe of the Divine Preſence, and that awfull regard he ought to have of the great God, with whom now he has more immediately to doe. Or it may be he does not pray with that warmth and intention of mind, which the vaſt importance of the mercy, he begs for, does deſerve.</p>
            <p>Therefore he ceaſeth not to pray, although a ſpee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy return be not made to his Prayers; as well know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing God's Ears are always open, and his Mercies ever free, but that the fault muſt lie on his own ſide. Which obligeth him narrowly to look into the de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fects of his own performance, and to mend them.</p>
            <p>The patience with which his Soul is ſuſtained, even when God refuſeth to grant the things he has pray'd for, preſerves him from running into any ſinfull extreme. From either being ſo prophane, as to believe his condition may be proſperous though he prays not at all, or ſo vainly fancifull, as to hope by any ſuper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtitious practice to render his Prayers the more effec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tual. He is as far on the one hand, from being puft up with the haughty confidence of the <hi>Stoic,</hi> who bids his wiſe man <hi>fac te ipſe felicem</hi> make himſelf happy, as he is from degenerating into the ſuperſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of the <hi>Papiſts,</hi> who, leſt their Prayers ſhould miſcarry, addreſs them to hundreds of Mediatours, more than God has either appointed, or allow'd, and without one example in the Primitive Church to ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtify it.</p>
            <p>Inſomuch as ſome honeſt and learned men of that Church could not forbear laying open the abſurdneſs
<pb n="10" facs="tcp:59519:9"/>

            <p>He does not hope to move God to hear him the ſooner by ſcourging his back, or by a Pilgrimage per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>form'd barefoot. He does not croſs his Body, but he crucifies his Luſts; he does not put off his ſhoes, but he layeth aſide every weight which may clog and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cumber him, ſo that he cannot run with patience the race ſet before him. But he has a great care that the fear of being drawn into the ſenſeleſs ſuperſtitions of <hi>Rome</hi> betray him not into a neglect of natural reve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rence in his devotions, and the omitting of decency and order in the Worſhip of God. Neither does he believe that the length of his Prayers will the more recommend them to Heaven, or that he ſhall have a
<pb n="12" facs="tcp:59519:10"/>
ſpeedier grant of them, when they are utter'd in un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>premeditated, and ſometimes unſeemly expreſſions, than when offer'd up in a grave form of proper and well choſen words.</p>
            <p>He is not ſo much concern'd for the circumſtances of his Prayers, as the ſincerity of them. He is even afraid of being ſo loud in private, as to make the Streets the witneſſes of his Devotion, leſt he ſhould onely receive the <hi>Phariſee</hi>'s reward; but he retires in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to the ſecreſies of his Cloſet, and there poureth forth his ſoul before God, with a profound reverence, an unfeigned humility, and deep ſenſe of his own wants; and though his Prayers be not always long, yet he ſuffers few hours of any day to paſs without ſending up to Heaven hearty and earneſt ſupplications, with thankſgivings.</p>
            <p n="3">3. He does not unreaſonably terrify himſelf with diſtant dangers, and anticipate calamities before they come. For the remote evils we ſo much dread, may both prove very tolerable when they come, and make but a ſhort ſtay with us. Nay, though to us they may ſeem inſufferable, and by no humane means to be avoided, yet the alwiſe Providence of God, whoſe ways are as unſearchable as the great deeps, may pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vent their coming at all, and ſcatter our proud enemies before the wind, who boaſted of their powers as invin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cible; contriving for us a wonderfull deliverance, when we ſuppose our ſelves on the brink of deſtruction.</p>
            <p>And ſurely the <hi>Iſraelites,</hi> when they beheld <hi>Pha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>raoh</hi> and his Hoſts floating upon the Red-ſea, could not but with ſhame reflect upon their own diſtruſt of God's wiſedom and goodneſs, and thoſe unjuſt reproa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ches they had caſt upon <hi>Moſes,</hi> as if they had been deliver'd on purpoſe from their bondage in <hi>Aegypt</hi> to periſh in the Wilderneſs</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="13" facs="tcp:59519:10"/>But ſuch fears never more, deſerve cenſure, than when we are ſo confounded by them as to neglect our Callings, deſert the ſtations wherein God has placed us, and take ill courſes to preſerve our ſelves againſt them. When we are ſo terrify'd about the events of things, as to ſeek to <hi>cunning</hi> men for a reſolution: and perhaps embarke our ſelves in ſome down-right ſinfull methods for our own ſecurity. We ought al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ways to keep our eye upon our Lord's rule;<note place="margin">Matth. 6.30.</note> 
               <hi>Take therefore no thought for the morrow, ſufficient unto the day, is the evil thereof.</hi> It being a reproof to thoſe impatient Chriſtians, who are not content with ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving made an honeſt proviſion for their preſent neceſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſities, but are alſo ſo anxiouſly and unmeaſurably ſoli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>citous about the future, as to evidence unto the World their independency upon Divine Providence.</p>
            <p n="4">4. The humble and patient Chriſtian, when croſſes and afflictions overtake him, neither grows froward under them, nor ſtupid. He neither ſuffers himſelf to be caſt into deſpair by immoderate grief, nor his vertue to be ſtained by getting looſe from his troubles. He neither diſhonours God, nor injures his Neigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bour, nor lays violent hands upon himſelf. He does not murmur and fill all peoples ears with complaints for ſuch calamities, as are as natural to his condition, as it is for the ſparks to fly upward, and of which all men taſte more or leſs.</p>
            <p>He ſets the good he receives, againſt the evil he ſuffers, and by a juſt compariſon finds his happineſs far to overbalance his misfortunes. He diſcovers an exact wiſedom in God's Providence under the great variety of its diſpenſations: and ever mildly compoſes himſelf into an entire ſubmiſſion to all that is harſh and grievous in his Chriſtian warfare: ſo far is he in bad times, and when he is ill uſed from falling into
<pb n="14" facs="tcp:59519:11"/>
violent fits of ſorrow, and languiſhing away in a me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lancholy retirement.</p>
            <p>And indeed the more a man indulges his grief, the greater head it will make againſt him, and in tract of time ſo diſpirit his mind, that he ſhall not be fit ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther to graple with his preſent diſtreſs, or to guard himſelf againſt any other. For <note n="(k)" place="margin">Jo. Stearne <hi>de obſtinatione, p.</hi> 121.</note> though all other things in the world by uſe and cuſtome become eaſie to us, yet grief is ever to be excepted; becauſe it is impoſſible to make grief become gratefull and plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſant to us, by accuſtoming our ſelves to grieve: but on the contrary, grief by continuance, is ſo far from being aſſwaged and depoſing its ſour and churliſh nature, that it grows more fierce and outrageous, and by our tame yielding to it, will bring both body and mind ſo low, as in the concluſion to overwhelm and ſtupify all our faculties and powers.</p>
            <p>Farthermore, although he does not allow his pains to throw him into the exceſſes of ſorrow, yet he is not ſo ſtupid and void of all ſenſe, as to pretend, or endeavour to perſuade others, that he does not feel them; nor arrived to that pitch of vanity with the <hi>Stoics,</hi> as to boaſt of the indifference between the reſt on a Bed, and the tortures on a Rack, juſt as if the one was as agreeable to his conſtitution as the o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther. He does not therefore think it his privilege to be without paſſions, whereof he knows ſo good an uſe may be made, but he ſtrives to govern them by his reaſon. He ſees no cauſe to judge that the ſeveral hardſhips and miſeries which fill the world with ſighs, and groans, and lamentations, have nothing of reality in them, but are all to be reſolved into mere opinion or fancy; or that torments can be the more eaſily en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dured, when they are call'd by fine names.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="15" facs="tcp:59519:11"/>No, he is ſenſible of his pain, and it is his great bu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſineſs, that the ſenſe of it may not breed in him any unworthy apprehenſions of God, or tranſport him in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to any evil or indecent ſpeech or carriage, ſuch as may reflect diſhonour upon his moſt holy Religion. And he ever upholds in his ſoul a juſt abhorrence of that falſe and wicked tenet, aſſerted by the ſame Sect of Philoſophers, that it is a piece of heroical gal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lantry for a man in ſharp pain or great troubles to ſtarve himſelf, or cut his own throat. For ſo to doe is a violation of the Laws of Nature, and an uſurpa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion upon God's Prerogative, who has a right to that ſervice, which by ſelf-murther we are render'd unca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pable to perform: it is an injury to humane Society, who have a claim to ſome ſhare of our labour: it is making our ſelves the judges in God's ſtead, whether it be fit for us to live any longer or no? it is the higheſt affront we can put upon the Divine good<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs, ſince by evident conſtruction, we declare, that it is better for us to die, than to ſub-ſiſt any longer in that uncomfortable condition Providence has choſen for us; and that we are ſo little be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>holden to God for all the mercies of this life, that irreverently and unmannerly we turn them all back upon him.</p>
            <p>In a word, the Chriſtian fortified by patience, as he doth not think death is to be feared, when it comes upon him by Divine appointment, ſo neither believes he that life is to be deſpiſed, ſo long as God ſhall pleaſe to continue it. Seeing it will ever be in his power by God's grace, whether in ſickneſs, or in troubles, to enjoy a contented and ſerene mind.</p>
            <p>And to make his patience the more ſteddy, he en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quires into the cauſes of his calamity: and if he hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neth to have been involv'd in it by his own crime,
<pb n="16" facs="tcp:59519:12"/>
neglect, or miſmanagement, he neither burſts out in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to complaints, nor ſits down ſlothfully under it, nor yet does any other violence to himſelf than what is in order to the cure, and may be the moſt effectual means to remove the cauſe.</p>
            <p>But if the evil comes by another man's fault, he employs his clemency and patience in forgiving it; and is ſo far from returning the injury, that he prays God alſo to pardon it, and ſtands prepared to receive another.</p>
            <p>And laſtly, if it do not come directly, either by his own folly, or another man's malice, he ſubmits, and is thankfull for it, as an act of Providence, de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſigned either to reform his manners, or to try his ver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tue, and the ſincerity of his love of God.</p>
            <p>And it was the ſenſe of the great good that afflic<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions may bring, and of the joy holy men perceive in their ſufferings for the cauſe of <hi>Chriſt,</hi> that did tran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſport St. <hi>Chryſoſtome</hi> into ſuch an hyper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bolical rapture, as to profeſs, <note n="(l)" place="margin">

I intreat leave ſomewhat the more largely to in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiſt upon theſe two things. 1. To prove that all re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiſtence to the Supreme Authority is unlawfull. 2. To ſhew with what care, impartiality and patience the good Chriſtian ſearches into the grounds and cauſes of his perſuaſion, that the commands of Authority are ſinfull, before he refuſes to pay obedience to them.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Firſt,</hi> To prove, that all reſiſtence to Supreme Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thority is unlawfull; in order to which we may ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerve theſe three things.</p>
            <p n="1">1. That there is an univerſal command in holy Scripture laid upon all Chriſtians to be ſubject to the Supreme Powers.</p>
            <p n="2">2. That this command is enforced with ſtrong and clear reaſons.</p>
            <p n="3">3. That the Popes of <hi>Rome</hi> were the firſt Preten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders from Scripture to a right to reſiſt the Civil Power.</p>
            <p n="1">1. That there is an univerſal and abſolute com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mand in holy Scripture laid upon all Chriſtians to be ſubject to the Supreme Powers in all caſes. Now no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing is plainer than that, if we be required to be ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject in all caſes,<note place="margin">Rom. 13.1.</note> reſiſtence in any will be ſinfull. <hi>Let every ſoul be ſubject to the higher power,</hi> to which Chriſtian Precept there's no exception to be found for any perſon in any inſtance, from one end of the Chriſtian Inſtitution to the other. The duty of Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jection is grounded both upon the Precepts of <hi>Chriſt</hi> and his Apoſtles, and confirmed by their conſtant prac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tice.
<pb n="21" facs="tcp:59519:14"/>
He and they not onely paid tribute to <hi>Caeſar,</hi> but gave proof of their ſubmiſſion even to the bitter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs of death it ſelf. And his and their examples have been faithfully copied out by the Apoſtolic Church, in the lives of its pious Confeſſours and glorious Mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tyrs. Subjection is a duty than which, there hardly is any oftner repeated in the Chriſtian Law, ſo as we cannot plead ignorance of it; it is preſſed with ſuch evidence of reaſon, that cuts off all pretences of eva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding it; it is ſet down in ſuch plain, eaſie, and full expreſſions, as that there can be no colour to doubt about the right underſtanding of it. The holy Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture gives permiſſion no more to the People collected into one body to rebell, than it does to each of them, by himſelf ſingly conſidered. Every Chriſtian, in all circumſtances, is required to conform to the Laws of the Supreme Authority, if they have no repugnancy to God's Laws; and to ſuffer patiently where obedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence would be a ſin. Now there being in our Reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gion a general Precept to be ſubject to our Gover<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nours, without one exception to it, what will the Sons of diſobedience urge in excuſe of themſelves? will they ſay that the Evangelical Precepts were not to bind perpetually, and that our obligation to obſerve them is already ceaſed? If it be, then we have done with our Religion and our Bibles, and may lay them both aſide.</p>
            <p>It is moſt certain, that by the ſame argument they would take off their obligation to this plain Chriſtian Duty, they may excuſe themſelves from their obliga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion to all the reſt. Will they plead, that the Goſpel is not a perfect rule of duty, and that the inſpired Writers did not foreſee and provide for all caſes; and that therefore it is but reaſonable there ſhould be a ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plement of new Doctrines and Rules, where the
<pb n="22" facs="tcp:59519:15"/>
Goſpel has been defective? But is not this rank Po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pery do we not juſtly condemn the Church of <hi>Rome</hi> for taking upon her to make new Articles of Faith? is not this to incur the guilt of St. <hi>Paul</hi>'s <hi>Ana<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thema,</hi> which ſhall paſs upon whoſoever preaches ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther Doctrine?</p>
            <p>Or will they ſay that the general Laws of the Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpel bind but ſometimes, and the univerſal Rules hold onely in particular caſes? That is, notwithſtanding St. <hi>Paul</hi> does lay a ſtrict injunction upon every Soul to be ſubject to the Higher Powers, yet that ſome ought to be excepted. But is not this the way to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtroy all the Laws of the Chriſtian Religion? ſince upon the ſame ground they diſpenſe with one Law of <hi>Chriſt,</hi> they may diſpenſe with as many as they pleaſe. Is not this to open a gap to all impiety and looſeneſs? yet to theſe miſerable ſhifts muſt the Ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vocates of Rebellion be driven.</p>
            <p>So it was the fate of our unhappy Nation to run it ſelf into a moſt unnatural and bloudy Rebellion, by a ſet of diſtinctions that had not the leaſt footſtep in the Chriſtian Religion. <note n="(r)" place="margin">England's <hi>diſtract. p.</hi> 11.</note>

            <p>Now if the Magiſtrate be ordained by God, then it is no more lawfull for an <hi>hundred thouſand</hi> men to reſiſt him, than for <hi>twelve,</hi> and if we are bound to ſubmit for Conſcience ſake, no encreaſe of our num<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bers or ſtrength can alter the rule of our duty, or take off the obligation of Conſcience. So that had the firſt Chriſtians had more potent Armies than <hi>Nero</hi> or <hi>Julian,</hi> yet no right ever could have accru'd to them thereby to oppoſe God's Ordinance, or to proceed againſt their Conſcience. We may perceive therefore a wide difference between the <hi>Cardinal</hi> and the <hi>Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtles</hi> in this matter. He reſolves the ſubjection of the Primitive Chriſtians into a mere point of prudence
<pb n="30" facs="tcp:59519:19"/>
and diſcretion, but they into a principle of duty and conſcience. He aſcribes their quiet and peaceable be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>haviour under Tyrants to their defect in ſtrength and numbers; but we find them, in what circumſtances ſoever placed, always avowing the neceſſity of ſubjec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, as an indiſpenſable Precept of their Religion: but, with more modeſty certainly, we may charge the <hi>Cardinal</hi> with the guilt of grievous ſlander, than raiſe a ſuſpicion of the leaſt hypocriſie in the Primi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tive <hi>Martyrs.</hi>

            <p>Wherefore notwithſtanding the Supreme Authority of a Nation may ſometimes be reduced to ſuch extre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mity, as that Rebels may be out of both the fears and danger of the public Sword, yet they can never get out of the reach of their own Conſciences, nor free themſelves of thoſe terrible convictions, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>with it will ever ſting the Children of diſobedience, and teſtify that they ſhall receive to themſelves dam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nation.</p>

Many hun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dred years after our Saviour's time the Doctrine of non-reſiſtence to the Higher Powers was conſtantly taught, and univerſally practiſed in the Chriſtian Church. There was a great degeneracy from the pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitive ſtrictneſs in the lives of Chriſtians, and much humane mixture in the Doctrines of Chriſtianity, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore men did claim, by a title derived from <hi>Chriſt,</hi> a right to controll the Supreme Authority. And as the luſts of the fleſh did more vigorouſly put forth them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves in the converſation of thoſe who profeſt the doctrine of the Croſs, ſo the greater pains was taken to corrupt a moſt pure Religion, that it might warp

into a compliance therewith, till at length men had near worn out of their minds the ſenſe of their duty to God and the King.</p>

            </p>
            <p>I farther obſerve under this head, that the Popes did take upon them firſt onely to confirm the Empe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rours by putting the Crown on their Heads, and from thence afterwards they pretended to a right to depoſe them.

            </p>
            <p>Now ſhould it be ſaid, that the relation we make is of matters done at a remote diſtance from our times, and that we may preſume the Doctrines of depoſing and killing of Kings (though not yet condemned by the Church of <hi>Rome</hi>) to be diſown'd by all the Mem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bers of it, ſince ſome of them have writ expreſly againſt them, and none of them have lately given us any occaſion to charge them with holding theſe wick<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed and unchriſtian Doctrines. To this it may be an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwer'd, that although the preſent Pope <hi>Innocent</hi> XI. has cenſured ſixty five lewd and pernicious Propoſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions,
<pb n="43" facs="tcp:59519:25"/>
taught by <hi>Jeſuits,</hi> and other <hi>Popiſh</hi> Caſuiſts, if that may be call'd a cenſure which is ſo very ſoft and gentle, yet he has ſlipt over this Doctrine ſo fre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quently taught by the ſame men, <hi>That a Prince ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>communicated or depriv'd by the Pope, may and ought to be depoſed or killed by his own Subjects, or any what<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſoever, as heretical,</hi> without taking the leaſt notice thereof. What reaſon can we aſſign for this? could his <hi>Holineſs</hi> be ignorant of a Propoſition maintained by <hi>Parſons, Mariana, Roſſaeus, Bellarmine, Suarez, Becanus, Heſſius, Valentia, Hereau, Gretſer, Sancta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rellus,</hi> and many others? Or could he think there was not ſo much need to condemn this King-killing Doctrine, and that the conſequences of it were leſs dangerous than thoſe by him condemned, when yet the teaching thereof has been the occaſion of ſpilling of ſo much Chriſtian bloud, and was the foundation upon which the <hi>Powder Plotters</hi> laid their horrible Deſign, and when but a few months before this De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cree of the <hi>Pope</hi> came forth, ſo many of the Sons of his Church in our Nation fell by the ſtroke of Juſtice for conſpiring the death of the King.</p>
            <p>What can we then ſay, but that this ſmall and harmleſs errour of the Caſuiſts teaching the lawful<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs and duty of killing Heretical Princes was ſpar'd by his <hi>Holineſs,</hi> when he condemned ſo many others, out of prudent foreſight of the good ſervice it yet one time or other may doe the <hi>Roman</hi> Church? And there will be more ground for this conjecture, when we remember that <hi>Cardinal Perron</hi> did ſolemnly pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſs, that before he and his brethren the Biſhops of <hi>France</hi> would by ſubſcription declare the depoſing Doctrine to be unlawfull, they would die Martyrs at the Stake.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="44" facs="tcp:59519:26"/>And as for thoſe of that Church who have writ againſt this Power in the Pope of depoſing Kings, we know ſome of them labour under an Excommunica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion at <hi>Rome</hi> for their pains to this day. And whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther there be freſh occaſion to charge any <hi>Papiſt</hi> with theſe Doctrines, let what follows determine.</p>
            <p>One <hi>J. D.</hi> a Jeſuit, after the late Plot, puts forth a Catechiſm, entitling it, <hi>A brief Inſtruction touching the Oath of Allegiance.</hi> And with his Deſign he ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quaints us in his Preface, that <hi>it is to defend the Reſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſers of the Oath of Allegiance, and to confirm them in their Chriſtian Reſolution, and to reclaim ſuch as have been miſled.</hi> As, in his opinion, all thoſe are, who have ſworn Allegiance to the King. And upon them he makes this odious and prophane Reflexion. <hi>Some who took the Oath, have ſince, to eaſe their fault, ſlept at a Miniſter's Sermon, and taken the</hi> cheering Cup <hi>and Lord's Supper to help its digeſtion.</hi> Then as to the Oath it ſelf he tells us, <note n="(y)" place="margin">Catech. <hi>p.</hi> 15.</note> 
               <hi>That to hold this Oath cannot be taken without grievous ſin, and without per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jury, is but what two Popes have declared with ſeveral</hi> Breves. And accordingly, after ſeveral frivolous matters debated, he brings his Scholar to acknowledge <note n="(z)" place="margin">Catech. <hi>p.</hi> 47.</note> 
               <hi>I am ready to ſubſcribe that you have made good the un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lawfulneſs of the Oath. Firſt by reaſon of the</hi> Title <hi>of</hi> Parliament <hi>exacting it.</hi> 2. <hi>For want of truth in all the Clauſes of the Aſſertory Part.</hi> 3. <hi>For want of juſtice in the Clauſe of the Promiſſory Part.</hi> Laſtly, <hi>For want of neceſſity; there being a neceſſity under a grievous ſin, as the</hi> Pope <hi>declares, for the not taking it.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>And yet every one knows that the very deſign of the Oath ſo much condemn'd, is onely to bring men to acknowledge their allegiance to the King, and to abjure that damnable Doctrine, that Princes which are excommunicated, or deprived by the Pope, may
<pb n="45" facs="tcp:59519:26"/>
be depoſed or murther'd by their Subjects or any whatſoever.</p>
            <p>Now ſince in the Triennial Aſſembly of the <hi>Jeſuits</hi> in <hi>London, April</hi> 1678. ſo great a part of the late Popiſh Plot was ſworn to have been hatch'd, ſince the diſco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>very thereof proved fatal to ſo many of them, ſince at their death they did renounce the Doctrine of the lawfulneſs, upon any occaſion or pretence whatsoe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver, to deſign and cotrive the death of the King; and ſince the very ſcope of the Oath of Allegiance was to preſerve the King's Leige People from being tainted with thoſe opinions which the <hi>Jesuits</hi> in their dying Speeches did condemn, it might reaſonably have been thought, not onely that no Member of that So<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciety for the time to come would have writ againſt the Oath of Allegiance, but alſo that the whole <hi>En<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gliſh</hi> Order, in their next <hi>Triennial Aſſembly,</hi> would by ſome publick Acts, have condemned the Doctrines of depoſing and killing of Kings, and thereby have gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven both credit and authority to the Declarations, upon this occaſion, made by their dying Friends, and like<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe evidence to the World of their own loyalty.</p>
            <p>But ſo far were they from giving the King any far<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther aſſurance of their loyalty and allegiance, that by a Decree they condemn afreſh the Oath of Allegiance, and refuſe to admit to abſolution, thoſe of their Church both that have taught the Oath to be lawfull and that have taken it, without they will publickly recant, and give manifeſt ſigns of their repentance, and promiſe amendment for the future.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>The</hi> Decree <hi>of the</hi> Fathers <hi>of the</hi> Society <hi>of Jeſus of the</hi> English <hi>Province, at their Provincial Congregation made, againſt the</hi> Oath <hi>of</hi> Allegiance <hi>at</hi> Ghent, <hi>the fifth day of</hi> July <hi>this preſent year</hi> 1681.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="46" facs="tcp:59519:27"/>
               <hi>That we may procéed with Uniformity amongſt our ſelves in the manner of acting touching the Oath of Allegiance.</hi>
            </p>
            <p n="1">1. <hi>Let us all profeſs, that as much obedience and fidelity ought to be ſincerely ſworn and exhibited to our King from every one of us, as is wont to be ſworn and exhibited to any Prince whatſoever from other Catholick Subjects.</hi>
            </p>
            <p n="2">2. <hi>That the Oath, as now it is, ſprinkled with many heterodox clauſes, cannot be taken, as being condemned by many Breves of Popes.</hi>
            </p>
            <p n="3">3. <hi>If any (againſt the Decrées of Popes) have taught the foreſaid Oath to be lawfull, let him not be admitted to abſolution, without public Recanta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, either made or ſacredly promiſed.</hi>
            </p>
            <p n="4">4. <hi>Thoſe who againſt their Conſcience have taken the Oath, let them be deprived of abſolution, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out manifeſt ſigns of repentance, and promiſe of amendment for the future. But thoſe who with a good</hi> Conſcience <hi>have taken it, are to be inſtructed: and if they renounce it, are to be abſolved.</hi>
            </p>
            <p n="5">5. <hi>Let care be taken, leſt either too much</hi> facility, <hi>or</hi> moroſity <hi>in abſolving, bréed ſcandal.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Thus we ſee what opinion, not onely ſingle Mem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bers, but a whole Aſſembly of <hi>Engliſh Jeſuits</hi> have of the Oath of Allegiance, and how they think them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves bound in Conſcience to treat thoſe of their Church, who either take the Oath, or write in de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fence of it: and what little ground any Prince can have to hope they ever ſhould become truly loyal Subjects. For all their ſpecious profeſſions of ſwea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring as much obedience and fidelity to the King, as other Catholic Subjects do to their Prince, will come to juſt nothing, ſo long as they refuſe to abjure all
<pb n="47" facs="tcp:59519:27"/>
power in the <hi>Pope</hi> or the <hi>People</hi> to depoſe them. Since, ſhould the <hi>Pope</hi> proceed to a ſentence of depoſition, they that acknowledge ſuch a power in the <hi>Pope,</hi> muſt take themſelves to be abſolved from all that alle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>giance they had ſworn, and from owning him any longer for their King. So that both the King's ſafety, and their allegiance will entirely depend upon the Pope's pleaſure.</p>
            <p>Neither can the King have better hold of them, by any Oath they ſhall pleaſe themſelves to take, ſince that Oath alſo, according to the doctrine of the De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cree, would become unlawfull, and ſo ceaſe to bind them, if it ſhould happen once to be condemn'd by one of the <hi>Breves</hi> or <hi>Bulls</hi> of the Pope. Moreover, though theſe <hi>Jeſuits</hi> do profeſs, yet indeed they do not exhibit as much obedience to the King, as other Popiſh Subjects do to their Prince: for it is well known that they of the <hi>Gallican</hi> Church do pay obe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dience to the Laws and Edicts of their King even a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt his <hi>Holineſs</hi>'s <hi>Bulls:</hi> and ſixty Doctours alſo of the <hi>Sorbon</hi> have declared, that the <hi>Engliſh</hi> Subjects of the <hi>Roman</hi> Perſuaſion may lawfully and ſafely take the Oath of Allegiance, which this <hi>Conſult</hi> of <hi>Jeſuits</hi> has condemned.</p>
            <p>But to doe the Reverend Fathers of that Order right, it muſt be confeſs'd, that notwithſtanding all the affronts they have put upon Kings, they can groſly flatter them, when it will ſerve the intereſt of their Society. Of which egregious flattery the <hi>French Jeſuits</hi> in their College at <hi>Paris,</hi> founded by the Bi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhop of <hi>Clermont,</hi> have given a very late inſtance. Where in the place of their old Inſcription, <hi>Collegium Claromontanum Jeſu,</hi> they have put up this, <hi>Collegium Ludovici Magni,</hi> wiping out at once the <hi>names</hi> both of their <hi>Founder</hi> and <hi>Saviour.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <pb n="48" facs="tcp:59519:28"/>What a change will Intereſt make in the Opinions and Practices of Men! Pope <hi>Hildebrand</hi> (to whoſe <hi>dictates</hi> the <hi>Jesuits</hi> pay moſt religious reſpect) de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clares Kings to be the Prieſts Servants, and even infe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riour to the <hi>Exorciſt:</hi> but theſe pious Fathers did not think they had given teſtimony ſufficient of their loy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>alty, till they had preferr'd their <hi>King</hi> before <hi>Jeſus Chriſt.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>And having thus proved that all reſiſtence to the Supreme Authority is unlawfull, and that the Popes were the firſt abettours of it in the Chriſtian Church by pretended Arguments from Scripture; I come,</p>
            <p n="2">2. To ſhew with what care, impartiality and pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tience the good Chriſtian ſearches into the grounds and cauſes of his Perſuaſion, that the commands of Authority are ſinfull, before he refuſes to pay obe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dience to them. No power on Earth can make him withdraw his obedience to God, nor any danger awe him into the doing of that which he believes to be a ſin. Where Man's Laws ſtand in oppoſition to God's Law, if it may be done without detriment to his Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion, he accepts the benefit of <hi>Chriſt</hi>'s Licence given to his Diſciples, and makes his eſcape by flying from one City to another, or elſe he patiently ſubmits to the penalty decreed to be inflicted upon him for his conſcientious refuſal.</p>
            <p>But becauſe men have refuſed to conform to the Laws of the Government when there has been no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing in them repugnant to the Will of God, and have been juſtly puniſhed for their diſobedience, at the ſame time they have thought themſelves Martyrs for the Cauſe of <hi>Chriſt</hi>; and ſince on the one hand it is moſt unhappy for them to ſuffer for their miſtakes, and on the other of ill conſequence to Governours, that their Laws, when juſt and expedient, ſhould not be
<pb n="49" facs="tcp:59519:28"/>
duly obſerved; therefore the man, who has poſſeſt his Soul with patience, does not run away with the firſt appearances of things, as being prone to ſuſpect the errour may lie rather in his underſtanding, than in the Laws of his Superiours; nor does he forbear to comply with the will of the Higher Powers, till up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on much conſideration he becomes perſuaded there can be no compliance without involving himſelf in ſin. And if a Law chance to be enacted, the matter whereof may ſeem evil to him, he does not haſten raſhly into any concluſion, but he imploys his pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tience, his ſincerity, his prudence in all the proper methods to inform his judgment truly, before he comes to a reſolution how he muſt behave himſelf.</p>
            <p>And in order to proſper in a work of ſuch impor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance, he begins it with hearty prayer to God to bleſs his undertaking, and guide him into all truth. Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore he enters into the merits of the Cauſe it ſelf, he impartially enquires, whether he be not carried into it by prejudice, paſſion, profit, fame or ſome other ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cular end. Whether he has not taken up this opinion of the unlawfulneſs of conformity to the Laws, as well as many falſe ones, by the prejudices of a diſad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vantagious education; by having heard the Argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments, read the Books, and converſed with the Men onely, who are of one ſide? There being reaſon to believe that many of the Diſſenters from our Church are mere ſtrangers to all the conſtitutions of it. They have rarely, if ever, been preſent all the time of Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vine Service, they have never ſeriouſly peruſed any one office of our Liturgy, and fairly weighed what may be ſaid for it.</p>
            <p>They ſcarce can pretend to have read more leaves of the Book of Publick Prayers than of the <hi>Alcoran.</hi> However theſe men ſeparate from us, becauſe they
<pb n="50" facs="tcp:59519:29"/>
have been taught to doe ſo, and becauſe their Friends do, upon whom they have ſuch a dependence, as not to dare to diſpleaſe them. And in which courſe while they continue, their moſt dangerous errours will be incurable.</p>
            <p>He farther conſiders whether his preſent diſſent does not proceed from his having had a known repu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation in ſuch a Party a long time, and although he could now without any violence to his Conſcience, yet he is aſhamed to retreat? or whether it be not becauſe he finds his oppoſition to the Government to be popular, and he draws crowds after him of admi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rers; or to be very profitable, he gains a fair livelihood by it, and ſhould be at a loſs for his ſubſiſtence, did he not engage himſelf in the intereſts of the Diſſenters?</p>
            <p>Laſtly, He conſiders whether he doth paſs judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment in the other caſes which occur in his life, with the ſame ſcrupuloſity and tenderneſs, he does in this? for if he have with ſuch art managed his Conſcience, that notwithſtanding it's tenderneſs in the matter of Conformity, it can allow him to live quietly in the known breach of any of the moral duties of Religion, he has juſt reaſon to ſuſpect his want of ſincerity as to the cauſes for which he divides from the Church. If notwithſtanding his long refuſal to join with us in our Common Prayers, as ſtinting the Spirit, and not tending to edification, he yet can ſubmit to the forms of ſolemnization of Marriage to gain a perſon with a great fortune, and to legitimate his iſſue to inherit it; and if after many years abſence from our Churches and ſeparation from our Communion as antichriſtian and unlawfull, he yet can receive the holy Sacrament with us to qualify himſelf for an office or employment, it will be obvious either that his Conſcience is per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſely inſtructed, or that he is an hypocrite.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="51" facs="tcp:59519:29"/>Now as none of the reaſons before-mentioned can juſtify any Man's diſobedience to Authority, ſeeing they owe their riſe to pride, intereſt, or paſſion, ſo were ſuch heads of enquiry duly poiſed in the balance, and allow'd their juſt weight, they would diſcharge out of mens minds abundance of thoſe ſcruples, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>with they have brought much charge and trouble up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on themſelves, and given great diſturbance to their Governours; and they would be able by theſe me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thods to diſtinguiſh between what was done out of pure conſcience, and what under the colour of it onely.</p>
            <p>But if having proceeded thus far, by a removal of thoſe things, which, in this caſe, ought to have no influence upon Conſcience, ſome diſſatisfaction ſticks ſtill in the mind, the proper work remaining is, to try the objections of Conſcience by the rule of Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcience. The rule of Conſcience is the will of God; the will of God is diſcover'd by the light of Nature, and revealed in the holy Scripture. And by an ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plication of the objection to the rule, the Conſcience may diſcern whether there be any ſtrength in it. For whatſoever we find God to have commanded, we are bound in conſcience to doe it; whatever to have for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bidden, we are bound in conſcience to avoid it: and in matters, by God neither commanded nor forbid<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>den, the thing is indifferent, and the Conſcience free. A man may let it alone, without omitting his duty; he may doe it, without committing a ſin. For how is it poſſible, that ſhould be a duty, which God never has commanded, or that a ſin, which God never has forbidden? thus the Apoſtle argues moſt truly,<note place="margin">Rom. 4.15.</note> 
               <hi>where no law is, there is no tranſgreſſion.</hi> Wherefore if upon a juſt compariſon between theſe commands of Autho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity, againſt which the meek Chriſtian's ſcruples have
<pb n="52" facs="tcp:59519:30"/>
lain, and the word of God, there does not appear any thing in them injoined, which by the Divine Laws is forbidden; nor any thing forbidden which God has required, it will evidently follow, that he muſt acquit the commands of his Governours from all imputation of evil, and diſmiſs thoſe ſcruples from his Conſcience, which hitherto have been the occaſion of his diſobedience, and expoſed him to the laſh of the Law. And this is the caſe of the Church of <hi>England,</hi> for few of the ſober Nonconformiſts have been ſo far carry'd away with the power of prejudice, as to af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firm that there is any thing in her Conſtitutions ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſly forbidden by any Law of God, and thoſe few who have been ſo hardy as to paſs this unjuſt cenſure upon her, neither yet have, nor ever will be able to prove their aſſertion. And thoſe places of holy Writ which ſome men would have preſt into the ſervice of this Cauſe, when the reaſon and occaſion of them has been thoroughly examined, to all unprejudiced men have appear'd, to look another way.</p>
            <p>But if the ſcruple againſt Conformity is not taken from the words of Scripture immediately, but infer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red upon ſome conſequence which is thought to flow from them, or bottoms upon ſome difficult Text, which may require learning and depth of judgment to the finding out of its meaning, or upon a metaphor or allegory, as many miſtakes in Religion have done, or upon his ignorance of the ſtate of the Church, and the Controverſies and Errours on foot, when thoſe portions of the Divine Writings were penned where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>from he deduceth his argument, and ſo he finds it an hard matter to deliver himſelf from his doubt; then he repairs to ſome ſober, grave, wiſe man, eminent for his piety, learning, and skill in controverſies; and having ſtript his Soul from prejudices, and that biaſs,
<pb n="53" facs="tcp:59519:30"/>
which either paſſion or profit may have clapp'd upon it, with all candour and ingenuity he opens and lays his caſe before him, reſolving firmly to ſubmit himſelf to his reaſons, ſo far as they ſhall convince him; and to order his converſation accordingly.</p>
            <p>And by taking this courſe, there will be great rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon to hope he ſhall have his doubts cleared, his ſcru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ples removed, and thoſe objections diſſolved, which had he relied alone upon his own abilities, might have enſnared him in unwarrantable diſobedience to thoſe God has ſet over him, and pull'd down heavy calami<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties upon himſelf.</p>
            <p>But if after all theſe honeſt and commendable en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deavours, again and again repeated according as the difficulty of his Cauſe required, and he had opportu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity to do it, he cannot attain to an entire maſtery of his Scruples, and give his Conſcience full ſatisfaction, however he will evidence to the World the upright<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs of his heart in the pains he has taken by his quiet and humble deportment. For what Scruples ſoever he may have as to other things, he is well aſſured that meekneſs, peace and charity, are eſſential ingredients in the character of a true Chriſtian. <note n="(a)" place="margin">

               <pb n="54" facs="tcp:59519:31"/>He does not therefore grow peeviſh or cenſorious, and forthwith condemn all that differ from him in opinion or practice: he does not ſet up for a Patron of a new Sect, and lay aſide all due reſpects to Anti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quity, draw as many as ever he can into his own Party, and confine ſalvation to the ſmall number of his own perſuaſion, as if the Divine Providence had engaged it ſelf in ſecuring them alone from all damnable ſins in practice and miſtakes in Faith. He does not whiſper ſtories and jealouſies into Mens ears to diſpoſe them to turbulency and ſedition, nor ſpeak evil of Dignities, and libel the Rulers of his People; he does not cla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mour againſt, nor arreign the whole management of Publick Affairs, much leſs enter into wicked Plots, and with the ſame illegal violences go about to main<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain his own Religion, by which thoſe of the Church of <hi>Rome</hi> have ſo often attempted to introduce theirs. But he is meek and patient, and eaſie to the Govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment under which he lives; he conforms to all its Conſtitutions as far as in conſcience he can; he is af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fable and courteouſ to his Neighbours, and upon all occaſions ſhews a great charity for thoſe who have not the ſame ſentiments with him in matters of Religion: he minds his own buſineſs, keeps his peculiar opini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons to himſelf whenever they ſtand oppoſite to the eſtabliſhments of Authority, and is contented private<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly to enjoy them.</p>
            <p>And having thus preſented you with ſeveral in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtances which go to the deſcription of the good Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtian, who in patience has poſſeſt his Soul, I will now briefly propoſe the means by which he doth at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain it.</p>
            <p n="1">1. He is daily leſſening his deſires of thoſe things, whereof there is but ſmall uſe, and he may ſubſiſt well without them. And having once contracted
<pb n="55" facs="tcp:59519:31"/>
and confined his Appetite to what onely is neceſſary to the comfortable ſupports of life, or in the firſt rank of things convenient for it, as he is but a little con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cern'd for the purchaſe of whatever elſe the World can afford, ſo the loſs of it never torments him.</p>
            <p>Now the neceſſaries to life, are ſo few, and almoſt in all places, through the goodneſs of God, ſo eaſie to be procured, that he who has ſtript himſelf of all co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vetous deſires of the vanities and ſuperfluities, that moſt men ſpend their time in eagerly purſuing, may have his will at a cheap rate; and there are ſo few things which will come croſs upon him, that he hath hardly left a blot open for even the ſpitefull to hit, which can ruffle and diſorder his Patience.</p>
            <p n="2">2. He takes more care to govern his Paſſions, than to ſecure himſelf againſt adverſity. For it may al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ways be in our power, by the grace of God and good management to keep our Appetites and Paſſions under the conduct of our Reaſon: but the niceſt care can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not ſecure us from Diſeaſes, cannot preſerve the lives of our neareſt Relations, Children and Friends, or be a ſufficient guard againſt the effects of other Mens ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lice; or exempt us from our proportion in the miſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries, which a Floud, or a Fire, or any other public Calamity brings along with it. Moreover tempeſts in our Paſſions utterly unfit us for the ſervice of God, and rob our Souls of all ſincere pleaſure. Whereas there is no inſtance of adverſe fortune, but by a gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rous patience will be conquer'd, and we may turn it into an inſtrument of vertue, that ſhall either haſten our repentance, or increaſe our truſt in God, or make us fair examples for leſs exerciſed Chriſtians to imitate.</p>
            <p n="3">3. It is good often to ſuppoſe, that the ſevere hard<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhips, which we ſee others to labour under, may in a
<pb n="56" facs="tcp:59519:32"/>
ſhort time come to our own turn, by which courſe, as we ſhall learn to be mercifull to thoſe in diſtreſs, and charitable in the cenſures we paſs upon the un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fortunate, ſo we ſhall be admirably prepared to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive all ſorts of afflictions, which can never ſurpriſe and confound them, who live in conſtant expectation of them.</p>
            <p n="4">4. When our minds are moſt free from the diſtur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bances and rage of paſſion, let us form judgments of all the good and evil things, which in the courſe of this life may happen unto us. And then peremptori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly reſolve in our practice to adhere to, and follow theſe deliberate and well-adviſed judgments, notwith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtanding afterwards, our fears, or our fury, may tu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>multuouſly preſent us with new meaſures to order our ſelves by.</p>
            <p n="5">5. That we may not be miſtaken in the judgments we frame of things, let us be carefull to love every thing in proportion to it's goodneſs. And the true way to rate this proportion, will be to find out how much every thing can contribute to the peace of our mind, which is the greateſt good we poſſibly can re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive from things. From which rule we may certain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly conclude that we are abſolutely to love God onely, and vertue: but to eſteem and covet all things elſe with limitations, with conditions, and ever with ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſſion to the Divine Pleaſure.</p>
            <p>For as God is the ſole Authour of all true Peace and joy of mind, ſo Vertue is the means alone, whereby we can qualify our Souls for ſo great a bleſſing, and prevail with God to beſtow it upon us. How vain then is it to ſet our affections upon any of the goods of this World, and to make them ſo neceſſary to our happineſs, as to think our ſelves miſerable, if we ſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fer a diſappointment in our expectation?</p>
            <p n="6">
               <pb n="57" facs="tcp:59519:32"/>6. The moſt powerfull means to the attaining of Patience, is to carry our eyes beyond the next and immediate cauſes of adverſity unto the great diſpoſer of things, by whoſe ſufferance, if not decree, every public calamity, every private affliction comes to paſs. So we ſhall diſcover a righteous Judge, never puni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhing the wicked above their demerit, a mercifull Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther ever deſigning to reclaim the perverſeneſs of his Children by his gentle chaſtiſements; a wiſe Gover<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour, ſtill bringing great good out of all the diſor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders, combuſtions, and diſaſters in the World.</p>
            <p>Did we but take this proſpect of affairs, we ſhould diſcern the beauty of Providence in the moſt crooked and harſh paſſages of this preſent ſtate. We ſhould behold the events of the wildeſt jars and confuſions or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derly and methodically conſpiring to the glory of God, and the good of the Creation. Were we but conſtantly affected with a lively ſenſe of the wiſedom of the Divine management in all the iſſues of things, we ſhould be ſo far from loſing our patience by be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing defeated in a little deſign, by a trifling loſs, by a tedious attendance for a ſmall debt or an act of com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon juſtice, by a denial of a reaſonable requeſt, by an unkindneſs in a friend, by a light diſgrace from a ſuperiour, by a ſlight from an equal, or by a neglect in an inferiour and dependant, that we ſhould faſhion our ſelves into an exact compliance with the alwiſe diſpoſals of Providence, even when we were ready to be deprived of the deareſt of our relations, the beſt part of our eſtate, and our own lives were in evident danger.</p>
            <p>Did we but reflect how uncertain an hold we have in the goods under the Sun, ſhould we to that degree place our ſecurity in them, as to bid our Souls take their reſt? ſhould we ſo ſet our affections upon them,
<pb n="58" facs="tcp:59519:33"/>
as to grieve and murmur, upon their loſs, like men utterly undone? did we but conſider our dependance upon God, not onely for food and raiment, but the very breath of our noſtrils; ſhould we thus inſolently trample upon our poor and harmleſs neighbours, and be ſo laviſh of their reputation, and yet forget all mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deration and patience upon the leaſt affront or injury from others?</p>
            <p>Did we but remember how much God has born with the beſt of us, how many open abuſes of his grace he has paſt by, and how long he is pleaſed to wait, expecting the return of his prodigal Sons, we could not, at this unchriſtian rate, lock up the bowels of our charity and compaſſion from the needy and di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtreſſed, and account ſo ſeverely with each other for every little treſpaſs.</p>
            <p>Let then the conſideration that God never puni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſheth us more than we need, that God never afflicts us but in meaſure, and with regard to our ſtrength, that God never correcteth us, but with deſign to reform us, engage us every one, through all the parts of our lives, readily and chearfully to ſubmit to his moſt holy will, and to demean our ſelves with all patience, cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity, and long-ſufferance one towards another.</p>
