         <editorialDecl>
            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            <head>THE
ANATOMY
OF A
PROJECT
For raiſing Two Millions.</head>
            <p>BEfore I enter upon the Project I will premiſe three things.
Firſt, That the Conſumption amongſt our ſelves of the
wrought Silks, Bengals, and Painted Callico's of <hi>India</hi>
is prejudicial to this Nation, and not only carries out
our Money, but hinders our Silk and Woolen Manufactures at
home. And here I ſhall not enter into a Diſpute, whether the
Indian Trade in general is beneficial to the Kingdom or not? for
in my Opinion that ought to be made no part of the Queſtion;
but, whether, if thoſe Manufactures were prohibited here, the
Trade would not be more beneficial, or leſs deſtructive than it is?</p>
            <p>I never heard but of two Objections againſt ſuch a Prohibition
that weighed with any body.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Firſt,</hi> That the Trade cannot be carried on without theſe Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nufactures,
which is as much as to ſay, that the Kings of <hi>China</hi>
and <hi>Japan</hi> will not ſell us their Commodities unleſs we buy the
Emperor of <hi>Perſia</hi>'s and the Great <hi>Mogul</hi>'s; or that the Great
<hi>Mogul</hi> will not ſell us for ready Money raw Silks, Pepper, Muſlins,
white Callico's, Fans, Salt-petre, nor even theſe Manufactures
unleſs we take as many as he pleaſes to impoſe upon us, and ſpend
them in <hi>England</hi> too. If they ſay that the Trade will not turn
to account without theſe Manufactures, they ſpeak againſt mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
of Fact; for they all know we carried on the Trade many
years with great Succeſs before they were thought on, this Miſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chief
being but of a few years date.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="2" facs="tcp:60100:2" rendition="simple:additions"/>
The ſecond Objection is, That it is our Intereſt to ſpend the
<hi>Eaſt-India</hi> Manufactures our ſelves, which coſt but little, and ſo
ſend our own to other Countries to a greater advantage. Now I
would ask of theſe Gentlemen, Whether it is not full as reaſona<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble
to let Corn come in from <hi>Dantzick</hi> and <hi>Poland,</hi> Cattel and
Cloth from <hi>Ireland,</hi> Silks, Stuffs and Salt from <hi>France,</hi> &amp;c. at a
low Price, that we may ſell our Corn, Cattel, Cloth, Stuffs
and Salt to other Countries at a high one, as to ſay we muſt
wear <hi>Eaſt-India</hi> Silks, Bengals and Callico's at home, that we
may ſend our own Silks and Stuffs to Foreign Parts? as if the
ſame reaſon which makes the <hi>Eaſt-India</hi> Commodities beat us out
of our own Markets, will not beat us out of Foreign; and then
we ſhall neither wear any of our own Manufactures at home, nor
ſend them any where elſe: beſides, we all know that many thou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſands
of both Woolen and Silk Manufacturers are ready to ſtarve
in <hi>England</hi> for want of Work; and that we do already ſell as
much Woolen Drapery abroad as we can have vent for, not<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>withſtanding
all that is ſpent at home, and could make as much
more if we could diſpoſe of it.</p>
            <p>The ſecond thing I ſhall premiſe is, That we have ſent former<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
as many of theſe Commodities to the other Parts of <hi>Europe</hi>
as we are like to do hereafter: <hi>France</hi> that took off a great part
of them having already prohibited them intirely, and other Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions
may do the ſame. Beſides, <hi>France</hi> as well as <hi>Holland, Den<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mark</hi>
and <hi>Scotland,</hi> have <hi>Eaſt-India</hi> Companies, and other Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tries
in probability in time will have the like, who all will ſhare
in that Trade, which we formerly in a great meaſure ingroſs'd;
ſo that if we increaſe much in it, it muſt be by our own Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſumption.</p>
            <p>The third thing is, That there never was a Million <hi>per Annum</hi>
(I believe not two thirds of it) ſpent in this Trade, (I mean
original Stock outward bound) and there is no reaſon to
believe this Project will enlarge the Trade; for no Perſon will
have any liberty or advantage by it more than he hath at this
time: for now every Man may trade for as much as he pleaſes
without any limitation; whereas, if this Project takes, all that
are not Subſcribers will be reſtrained. When they talk of diſco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vering
new Trades, I ſay, this Reſtraint will rather diſcourage
than promote ſuch a Diſcovery, for the Reaſons before given;
<pb n="3" facs="tcp:60100:2" rendition="simple:additions"/>
nor is there any probability of ſuch an Attempt, whilſt they can
make ſo great Advantage by theſe Commodities.</p>
            <p>I am not poſitive in any thing I have here ſaid; but as I am
more or leſs miſtaken in theſe Principles, ſo I ſhall be propor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tionably
in all the Deductions I make from them.</p>
            <p>Theſe things being premiſed, let us examine this Project,
which runs thus, <hi>viz.</hi> Any Perſons whatſoever that will ſubſcribe
2000000 <hi>l.</hi> of Money to his Majeſty's uſe, ſhall have 8 <hi>per Cent.</hi>
perpetual Intereſt, redeemable by Parliament, iſſuing out of a
double Duty upon Salt; and ſhall beſides have a liberty of tra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding
to the <hi>Eaſt-Indies</hi> for as much more; and if they will not
trade themſelves, may ſell or rent that Liberty to any others, in
the nature of Licenſes to Hackny-Coachmen: ſo that here is
4000000 <hi>l.</hi> of Money to be raiſed, two for his Majeſty, and two
to trade with.</p>
            <p>I do not pretend here to recite the Project offer'd to the Houſe
of Commons, for that I know nothing of; but this is a Project
talk'd and cry'd up in Coffee-houſes. Now I ſay, the Encourage<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
offer'd to the Subſcribers is not ſufficient to bring in the
Money; and if it was, it would bring utter Ruin to the King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom.
To diſſect it, let us enquire what the 8 <hi>per Cent.</hi> is worth
as <hi>Exchequer</hi> Credit goes now. We may remember not many
Months ago, that Salt-Tallies which had 7 <hi>per Cent.</hi> Intereſt,
were ſold for fifty <hi>per Cent.</hi> and now will not ſell for above ſixty
four, tho it is the beſt Fund in <hi>England</hi> (it having paid off
already near 80000 <hi>l.</hi> of the principal Money) and much bet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
than it can be when the Tax is doubled. I believe the
Projectors will agree with me, that they are not like to ſell bet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
for increaſing our Funds; nothing being more certain than
that the more Tallies or Stock we have, they will ſell the cheaper:
beſides, when two Millions worth of Stock is to be ſold together,
it will not bear the ſame Price as when there is not above two or
three thouſand Pounds worth; for where lumping Sums are to
be raiſed, there muſt be lumping Penniworths.</p>
            <p>Therefore taking it for granted, that the 8 <hi>per Cent.</hi> will not
be Encouragement enough, then this Defect muſt be ſupplied by
Licenſes to trade to the <hi>Eaſt-Indies,</hi> to the value of 2000000 <hi>l.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Now I have ſuppoſed before that a Million of Money is as much
as can be turned, eſpecially for a great many years, in this Trade;
which, if true, then here are twice as many Licenſes as can be
<pb n="4" facs="tcp:60100:3" rendition="simple:additions"/>
made uſe of. Now it is certain that every Man will rather make
ſomething of his Licenſe than nothing, and then of conſequence
they will beat down one another ſo low, that ſome of them may
be bought upon very reaſonable terms to put under Tarts and
Cheeſcakes. I would ask of our Projectors, whether, if there
were twice or thrice as many Licenſes for Hackny-Coaches as
could be employ'd about the Town, ſome of them would not
be us'd for Bumfodder?</p>
            <p>To avoid this neceſſary Conſequence, perhaps they will ſay
that 2000000 <hi>l. per Annum</hi> may be imploy'd in the Trade: then
let us ſee what conſequence that will be to the Kingdom.</p>
            <p>Dr. <hi>Davenant</hi> ſays in his Eſſay upon the <hi>Eaſt-India</hi> Trade, that
we uſually ſend forth 500000 <hi>l. per Annum</hi> in value to the <hi>Eaſt-Indies,</hi>
whereof I believe he will allow that not above 200000 <hi>l.</hi>
was in Commodities: now I do not ſee any probability of more
than that quantity in Commodities being ever ſent hereafter; for
if they could have diſpoſed of more, the <hi>Eaſt-India</hi> Company
and Interlopers would rather have carried it out, tho they got
but two <hi>per Cent.</hi> by it, than have ſent empty Ships. Indeed all parts
of the <hi>Eaſt-Indies</hi> are ſo hot that our Cloth is of little uſe to them;
and that which is ſent is a Clog on the <hi>Eaſt-India</hi> Company, and
little Benefit to us, for they ſend moſt of it up the Perſian Gulf,
which prevents the Sale of as much from <hi>Turkey:</hi> then the other
1800000 <hi>l.</hi> muſt be ſent out in Silver and Gold. Now if what
the <hi>Eaſt-India</hi> Company ſays be true, the Returns for this Money
will be five times as much, which will make 9000000 <hi>l.</hi> but be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe
we will be ſure to be within compaſs, we will take it to be
but ſix; and if what I have ſaid in my ſecond Propoſition be
true, all <hi>Europe</hi> beſides <hi>England</hi> will not take off above 500000 <hi>l.</hi>
of this Sum, according to the Computations of Dr. <hi>Davenant,</hi>
who without doubt makes the moſt it: then there muſt be the
value of 5500000 <hi>l. per Annum</hi> of theſe Commodities ſpent in
<hi>England,</hi> which muſt put an end to every Manufacture we have,
and in a few years not leave one Penny of Money in the Nation.
It is not material whether my Computations are exactly right;
for I intend only to ſhew, that if 2000000 <hi>l.</hi> can be turn'd in the
Trade, then much the greateſt part of it (if not nine parts in
ten) will be carried out in ready Money; and we have no aſſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rance
of ever ſeeing any Proportion of it again, that depending
upon the Faſhions, and uncertain Humours of other Countries.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="5" facs="tcp:60100:3" rendition="simple:additions"/>
If I am anſwer'd, That the Parliament deſigns to keep the
Trade within their own Power, and to lay what Impoſitions or
Reſtraints upon it they pleaſe; I reply, That deſtroys the very
Project: for nothing is more certain than that theſe Inconveni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ences
will happen, and 'tis very probable the Cries of the People
will at laſt prevail upon the Parliament to prevent them, as hath
been attempted four Seſſions together, and twice Bills have paſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed
the Houſe of Commons to that purpoſe: and can it be con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived
that the Merchants will ſubſcribe a vaſt Sum of Money at
ſuch Uncertainties, when every Year they will be in pain about
loſing the moſt beneficial part of the Trade? The ſame Objecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
lies againſt its being made redeemable by Parliament; for tho
that is never likely to be done, yet the very mentioning it may
ſpoil the Propoſal: for it is telling the Subſcribers after they have
ſtood the brunt of the day, if another Set of Men hereafter,
when Money is more plenty, ſhall offer to raiſe the ſame Sum
upon eaſier Terms, then they ſhall be laid aſide.</p>
            <p>From all this I infer, That if 2000000 <hi>l.</hi> is not employed in the
Trade, the Licences will be worth little or nothing; for no body
will be reſtrained when there are more Licences than can be uſed:
and if the whole 2000000 <hi>l.</hi> is employed in the Trade, the King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom
is undone. Beſides, the <hi>East India</hi> Company that now is
muſt either be aboliſhed, or continued; if the former, it ſeems
to be great Injuſtice to them, when the King hath granted them
a Patent purſuant to the Votes and Addreſs of the Houſe of Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mons;
if the latter, then there will be a great Stock without
limitation employed in the Trade over and above this 2000000 <hi>l.</hi>
and ſo conſequently much more Money will be carried out, and
theſe Licences of much leſs value.</p>
            <p>We may add to this, That nothing can be more fatal to the
Nation than ſettling perpetual Funds; for they maim the Pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lick,
and in effect cut off ſo many Counties from the Govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment,
by diverting more Supplies than they contribute towards
the National Charge to private Uſes. It's a moſt miſerable
thing to conſider, beſides the Funds that will expire in about 8
years time, that we ſhall pay, if this Project goes on, near
800000 <hi>l. per Ann.</hi> for Perpetuities or long Tracts of years;
which will make the Publick as much weaker, as if the 6 Nor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thern
Counties, with all the People in them, were ſunk in the
Sea. This it is that hath brought <hi>Spain</hi> to ſo low an ebb, not<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>withſtanding
<pb n="6" facs="tcp:60100:4" rendition="simple:additions"/>
their great Territories in <hi>Europe,</hi> and the Riches of
the <hi>East</hi> and <hi>West Indies.</hi> Beſides, theſe long Funds ſtrike at the
very Foundation of our Government; for if in a future Reign
the Court ſhould ſhut up the Exchequer, what will become of
our Conſtitution, and the Power of Parliaments, for which, in
my Opinion, we have no Security but their Power of giving Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ney?
and therefore unleſs I was a Miniſter of State, I would ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver
conſent to a Project that ſeems ſo pernicious to me.</p>
            <p>They tell us this Fund ſhall be made redeemable by Parlia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment;
which is a Chimera, when there is the united Intereſt of
ſuch a number of People to continue it, and 2000000 <hi>l.</hi> of Money
muſt be raiſed to redeem it: and whoever doubts this, let him
conſider not only what the <hi>East India</hi> Company hath done to pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerve
themſelves, but what Intereſt the <hi>African, Ruſſia, Hambo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rough,</hi>
and other Companies, have always made when they have
been in danger, and he will be ſatisfied that ſo great a body of
Men armed with ſuch a Revenue and ſuch Privileges, will not
only preſerve themſelves, but almoſt govern the Kingdom.</p>
            <p>But farther, if this takes, in all probability it will deſtroy the
<hi>Bank of England,</hi> not only by leſſening the Price of their Stock,
but by making ſuch Demands upon them as 'tis impoſſible they
ſhould pay; and if they ſhould be broke a ſecond time, they muſt
not expect another Reſurrection; the conſequence of which muſt
be the deſtroying the Credit, and depretiating all the Tallies in
<hi>England,</hi> which have advanced or decreaſed always with the
Bank-Stock: nay, even this very Stock will have the ſame fate.</p>
            <p>Beſides, the doubling the Salt Fund in all likelihood will not
double the Income, as we have experimented already in the Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciſe
upon Beer and Ale; and then it will leſſen the Security of
the Salt Tallies, which now pays off every year part of the Prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cipal
Money, and then perhaps will not pay off the Intereſt, and
by that means make that Fund perpetual, which otherwiſe would
clear it ſelf in leſs than 20 years.</p>
            <p>Before I have done, I will take notice of a Saying that is in al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moſt
every ones mouth, viz. <hi>That we must ſettle the</hi> Eaſt India
<hi>Trade one way or other, or elſe it will be loſt;</hi> tho, by the way, this
can't be ſuch a ſettling it; for this Project gives no Man any
Advantage, Benefit, or Facility in Trading that he had not be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore,
but only ſays, No Man ſhall trade that is not ſo qualified.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="7" facs="tcp:60100:4" rendition="simple:additions"/>
Now let us conſider what Trades we are in poſſeſſion of, and
that we are likely to loſe. We have little or no Trade but to
<hi>Perſia, India, China,</hi> or <hi>Japan,</hi> for the Commodities of thoſe
Countries, moſt of which we buy with our ready Money. Now
I would ask, whether if we ſhould diſcontinue this Trade for 20
years (which cannot be the caſe) they would not ſell us their
Commodities for ready Money whenever we offer'd it. The
<hi>Engliſh</hi> and <hi>Dutch East India</hi> Companies know this by woful Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perience;
for tho they have had the Monopoly of theſe Trades
for many years, yet now the Interlopers beat them both out of
them.</p>
            <p>There is one part of the Trade to the <hi>East Indies</hi> which would
be beneficial to us if we could get it, which perhaps requires
joynt Counſels, Stock, and Forts to manage, which is the Trade
for Spices to the <hi>Molucca</hi> and <hi>Philippine</hi> Iſlands. The reaſon that
Forts may be neceſſary here is, becauſe they are ſmall Iſlands
inhabited by few People, and may be ſeized by the <hi>Dutch</hi> and
other Nations, if we do not protect both them and our ſelves:
but this Reaſon will not hold in thoſe vaſt Dominions where
Forts cannot defend us againſt the Natives, and the Natives will
protect us againſt other Nations: ſo that nothing can be more
ridiculous than to have Forts there to ſecure the Trade of the
Coaſts of 10000 Miles; as if we ſhould have a Fort at <hi>Archangel</hi>
to ſecure the Trade to <hi>Turky.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>This Trade for Spices would be a prodigious Advantage to the
Kingdom, tho not ſo great Profit to the <hi>East India</hi> Company
as the Manufactures they now trade in; which is the reaſon they
have never yet applied themſelves to get it, as might be eaſily
done if <hi>Dampeir</hi> tells us true, who ſays, that many of the <hi>Philip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pine</hi>
Iſlands have Spices which the <hi>Dutch</hi> know nothing of; and
ſome of them have made Overtures to the Company, but without
ſucceſs: ſo that upon the whole matter it appears to me, the pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>judicial
part of the Trade we can't loſe, and the other we either
will not, or cannot get.</p>
            <p>But after all, if we are reſolved to encourage theſe Manufa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctures,
in my Opinion the beſt way will be to eſtabliſh the <hi>East
India</hi> Company, not for the Reaſons they give, but becauſe it will
diſcourage the Trade; for as they would manage a beneficial
Trade to leaſt Advantage, ſo they will a deſtructive one to leaſt
Diſadvantage.</p>

I do not pretend here to have recited the Project exactly, nor
am I poſitive in any of my Computations, but have endeavoured
to take them the ſtrongeſt againſt my ſelf; and if I am miſtaken
in them, there muſt be proportionable Allowances made: and
yet I believe the Subſtance of what I have ſaid will hold true. Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſides,
I have not entred into the Practicableneſs of the Project, as
how it will be poſſible to confine Men to trade for no more than
they ought to do, when Gold, Silver, or Jewels, may be carried
out privately, and Money may be tranſmitted by Bills of Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>change;
and then what will become of the Licences? but this I
will leave till I know more of it, and then I will either own my
ſelf in the wrong, or ſhew it to be a ſenſleſs Project.</p>
            <p>It cannot be doubted but thoſe whoſe buſineſs it was, conſider<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
of all the Propoſals for raiſing of Money before the Parliament
ſat; and ſince they thought this a good one, they would have
done their Country great Service if they could have offered it
ſooner: for by that means they might have ſaved the great Diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>counts
we have paid; they might have diſcharged a great many
thouſand Seamen, which we have kept in conſtant Pay for want of
Money to clear them; they might have disbanded all the Army
which the Parliament have not allowed, and have been kept up
ſince at the expence of that Money which is and muſt be given to
maintain thoſe that were allowed, becauſe a few thouſand Pounds
could not be got to disband them; beſides the great Inconveni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence
it has been to the Country-Gentlemen, who have been kept
from their Affairs at home, and at laſt may be under a neceſſity
to leave the whole Buſineſs of Parliament to thoſe whoſe Occaſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons
require them to be about <hi>Westminster.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>I will conclude, with my hearty Wiſhes for raiſing the Money
by the moſt effectual means, for his Majeſty's and the King of
<hi>Spain</hi>'s Life, and a Triennial Parliament.</p>
