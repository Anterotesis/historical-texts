         <editorialDecl>
            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            <p>
               <seg rend="decorInit">H</seg>Is Majeſtie being himſelfe ſo deeply afflicted with the
miſeries and calamities brought upon all his poore
Subiects in generall by this unnaturall war, doth not
at all wonder, that the grievous and more particular
ſufferings of the Inhabitants of the Countie of Dorſet
ſhould urge them to ſeek eaſe and releefe, though by
wayes leſſe regular; and being entirely perſwaded, that their intenti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons
in their late aſſembly, and in their preſent addreſſe to his Maieſtie,
are full of dutie and loyaltie to his perſon and government, is ſo far
from reprehending them, that hee is verie glad to find ſo many of his
loyall Subiects united in a joynt and heartie ſence of the publike. And
that by this particular application of themſelves to his Maieſtie, they
have afforded him the meanes to informe them more particularly of the
Juſtice of his cauſe, and his ſincere and conſtant deſires and endeavours
for peace, than appeares by their profeſt neutralitie they have hitherto
been: which that he might the better do, and that there may thereby
be wrought a perfect union and coniunction between his Maieſtie, and
thoſe who profeſſe to be ſo ſincerely affected with the ſame pious de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſires
of the publike good, his Maieſtie will verie ſpeedily ſend unto the
Petitionees, or unto ſuch as they ſhall depute within the ſaid Countie,
perſons fully inſtructed in the courſe of all his Maieſties former pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceedings,
and of his preſent reſolutions. And in the meane time, as an
inſtance of his gracious intentions towards the Petitioners, hee is plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed
to give theſe particular anſwers to their ſeverall deſires.</p>
            <p>To the firſt, that whenſoever propoſitions of peace ſhall be made
unto his Majeſtie by thoſe at Weſtminſter, his eares ſhall be alwayes
open unto them and not only ready to receive them, but even to ſeek
and ſollicit for them, when ever hee can probably judge that they will
not reject his overture, whereof the Petitioners need make no doubt,
his Majeſtie having neglected no occaſion to invite them to a treatie of
peace, the bleſſing therof was never more to be implored of Almightie
God, nor to be more induſtriouſly endeavoured by all good men, than
at this time, when without it (as the Petitioners well obſerve) this
Kingdome is likely to be made the prey of a forraine Nation, the Scots
<pb n="4" facs="tcp:43173:3"/>
being at this preſent advanced with an Army ſo far into the heart of
the Kingdome, as already even to threaten the Weſterne parts. And
his Majeſtie doth further promiſe in the word of a King, that if a Trea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie
may be procured, hee will ſeek no other conditions of peace, than
thoſe mentioned by the Petitioners, <hi>viz</hi> The glorie of God, in the
maintenance of the true Reformed Proteſtant Religion, the juſt and
inſeparable right of the Crowne, the juſt power and priviledges of
Parliament, and the lawfull rights and liberties of the Subject, and all
theſe under none of theſe ambiguous termes whereby the contaarie
partie have deluded and miſled ſo many of his good Subjects, preten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding
they fight for the ſame, making the knowne Lawes of the Land
(which cannot deceive) the meaſure of each particular.</p>
            <p>To the ſecond his Majeſtie doth promiſe, that if a Treatie may be
procured, he will earneſtly deſire a ceſſation of Armes, as hee did in the
laſt at Vxbridge, though to his great griefe not conſented unto by the
other partie, to the end that a Treatie tending to peace may not proceed
bloud: And his Majeſties deſire is, that the book of the ſaid Treatie at
Vxbridge to be read to the Petitioners for their ſatisfaction in this
point, and manifeſtation of his deſire of peace.</p>
            <p>To the third, that in caſe for the ſins of the Nation, the obſtinacie of
the other partie cannot be overcome; but that his Majeſtie and his
People muſt yet be further ſcourged by Gods afflicting hand of war,
that his Majeſtie is ſo deeply ſenſible of his Supplicants, and all his o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
good Subjects ſufferings, by contributions, taxes, free quarter and
plunder, that whatſoever can be done on his Majeſties part in the three
firſt, by all the moderation that can poſſibly be uſed, unto the latter by
the ſevereſt juſtice ſhall be carefully and effectually endeavoured: As
for the point of truſting in the Petitioners hands ſuch of his Forts and
Garriſons as ſhall be thought neceſſarie to be continued, his Majeſtie
makes no doubt, but if peace may not be procured, it ſhall ſo evidently
appeare unto the Petitioners, who have been the Authours, and are the
Contrivers of their miſeries, that they will prove the heartieſt Cham<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pions
of their Kings, their owne, and Gods cauſe; and conſequently,
be as fit perſons as any his Majeſtie can chuſe, with what neere beſt
concernes his ſafetie, and their protection: but for this particular, as
after for the future maintaining of the ſaid Garriſons, his Majeſtie will
by thoſe whom he ſhall employ unto the Petitioners, adviſe with them
of the time, and manner how his ſervice may be done, muſt be their
ſatisfaction.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="5" facs="tcp:43173:3"/>
To the laſt, that a chiefe calamitie of war, is the ſilencing of the
Lawes, and if it were poſſible to uphold their due and currant execu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion,
the Sword could no longer: but as far forth as it is poſſible, that
militarie affaires can be governed by legall inflictions on offenders, his
Majeſtie is verie deſirous to give the Petitioners all imaginable ſatisfa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction;
but being a matter of ſuch intricacie, the particular wayes and
method of it muſt be ripened by further debate.</p>
            <p>As for the point of leave for His Majeſties miſ-led Subjects, to
lay downe armes, and to returne to their habitations, there to live
unqueſtioned and unmoleſted, it is that whereunto his Majeſtie hath
already many times given more then a permiſſion, that is a ſpeciall in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vitation
by ſeverall gracious Proclamations, which for the Petition<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers
ſatisfaction, he ſhall very willingly renew; as for the other part
which concernes thoſe at preſent ingaged in His Majeſties ſervice, and
thoſe under reſtraint, His Majeſtie is too confident of the Petitioners
affection to him and his Kingdomes ſafety, to believe while his ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mies
are ſo ſtrong, and daily forcing every man to take up Armes a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt
him, and whilſt a Forraigne Nation is in the bowells of this
Kingdome ready to devoure it, that they would wiſh him one man
leſſe in his Army, or one man more at libertie to joyne with them;
as for all ſuch perſons as are abſent from their home, and not inga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ged,
in His Majeſties ſervice, it ſhalbe verie accomptable to His Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jeſtie,
that they returne to their homes to tend the ſervice and quiet of
their Countrey, according to the Petitioners deſires, and for all
Acts of Parliament, and Lawes unrepealed, in what concernes the
Civill Government in particular, for Aſſiſes, Seſſions, and the like,
the Petitioners undertaken the protection of His Majeſties Miniſters

            <p>VVHereas His Majeſtie ſeemes to be deeply afflicted with the mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerable
calamities of his people, and knowes how to remedie it;
What is the ſum of that expreſſion? An unnaturall warre it is indeed,
but faire words will not hide an ill cauſe; Are not theſe waies irregu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lar,
when Ieſuits, Popiſh Prieſts, Papiſts, and out-lawd perſons are prote<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cted
from juſtice? all good men are very ſenſible of the publike calami<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty
herein.</p>
            <p>1. You may take notice that in this Anſwer, there is no notice ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken
of the Lords and Commons at Weſtminſter, to be a Parliament,
though the King by Letters ſent by <hi>Rupert</hi> to them gives them that
appellation.</p>
            <p>2. For theſe things ſeemingly vowed to be ſought for, how unlike is
it, to what is indeed laboured for? Is Gods glory ſought, in throwing
downe the Kingdome of Jeſus Chriſt? and making warre againſt his
Members? Is the true Proteſtant Religion ſought? by advancing Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>piſts,
Ieſuits, and Popiſh Prieſts? and we hope none will deny but that
if the Crowne of any Prince, ſhall ſtand in oppoſition to the Crown and
Power of Jeſus Chriſt, we are to follow the lamb whereſoever he goes,
though perſecuted; where is the Priviledges of Parliament if not ſo
much as acknowledged, but hunted after, reviled, and with force of
armes withſtood? and Delinquents, Jeſuits, and breakers of the Laws
protected from their power, and where is the Liberties of the Subject,
if tyrannized over, perſecuted and plundered, as daily they are under the
Kings Forces?</p>
            <p>3. Which party have miſ-led his Majeſties Subjects, may eaſily ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peare

                  <p>YOu have had many meetings, but few ſalutations from me,
not that I love you leſſe than other Governours: but that
I knew not how to ſhape a diſcourſe to you, till I ſaw which
way you did encline. I have ſeene ſome of your Articles, and find
you pretend chiefly to ſtand up in your owne defence, and the pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſervation
of that little which is left to maintain and preſerve you
and yours. If that onely be your intent, I know not how, or why
it ſhould be withſtood by any one that loves his Countrey; but
then I would wiſh you would manifeſt it, by your yeelding
no asſiſtance to the aduerſe partie, and we will endeavour to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quire
none from you; otherwiſe we muſt look on you as not what
you profeſſe your own friend onelie, but our profeſſed enmie. Put
us in a way by your asſiſtance to get the Kings party to quit their
holds, and we I aſſure you, will ſpeedily relinquiſh our land Gar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riſons.
If your intentions are according to your expresſions, then
I deſire you would manifeſt it; Firſt, by your prohibiting Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>piſts,
and ſuch as are notorious enemies to the Parliament. Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>condly,
by warily declining the counſell and the wily practiſes of
ſome eminent men now in Armes againſt us, who plott and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trive
to abuſe and ſeduce your honeſt and innocent intentions.
Thirdly, wee intreat you likewiſe not to ſuffer ſcandalous nor
drunken miniſters to have any great power with you, nor influence
upon you, becauſe we know ſuch are our profeſſed enmies; for
they know the Parliament intends to call them to a ſtric<gap reason="illegible" extent="2 letters">

you, that if they behave themſelues amiſſe, and fall into
your hands, you would acquaint us with their offences that wee

brought to paſſe. If you canot apprehend the great neceſſities of it,
yet I adviſe you at leaſt to ſtand ſtill, aud not to lift up your hand
againſt it; for if it be of God, it will ſtand, if it bee not of him, it
will fall of it ſelfe to the ground. Take heede then good Neigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bours

of a Treaty, the late printed Letters between the King
and Queen, it is hoped have given full ſatisfaction to every ratio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nall
man; and yet (ſuch is the Parliaments deſire of Peace, if it
may be, that) the Lords and Commons have both agreed to ſend
Propoſitions to the King for Peace, and that without any Treaty;
but forthwith by Bill to require a poſitive anſwer: to which if it
ſhall pleaſe His Majeſty to give his Royall Aſſent, an end will bee of
the Wars, and the kingdom ſetled in peace, and he received with joy,
and honoured with the love and loyalty of all his Subjects.</p>

               </gap>n little ſatisfaction to reaſonable men, who
will without doubt be fully ſatisfied in the Declartion, which the
Parliament are putting out concerning the ſame.</p>
            <p>6. What faithfull Proteſtant can be ſo blinded, as not to under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtand,
and in his conſcience confeſſe, that the ſins of the Kings Army
are exceeding great, both in drinking, ſwearying, whoring, robbing,
plundering, killing, and idolatry, and all manner of wickedneſſe and
barbarous cruelties daily exerciſed in all parts where they come.
And what redreſſe is here promiſed for the reliefe of His Majeſties
Subjects herein. To the third, you may ſee the anſwer is, that
Taxes and Free-quarter ſhall be done with moderation, and ſevere
juſtice is promiſed for plunder; but ſhould that be fulfilled, the
King would ſoone hang up all his ſouldiers.</p>
            <p>7. For the truſting of any to keepe the Garriſons for the King,
it is notoriouſly knowne, that the Queen muſt approve of them, and
none but Papiſts muſt bee entruſted there with; is it not ſo in all
parts of the kings quarters.</p>
            <p>8. For the want of Iuſtice, the kingdome is very ſenſible, that
that very thing hath beene a great cauſe of theſe Wars; which Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>piſts,
Ieſuits, and Delinquents were the fomenters of, to be a Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tection
