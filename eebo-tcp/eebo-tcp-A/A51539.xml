            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            <head type="sub">As also somewhat relating to the satisfaction of all Inquirers into Captain <hi>Iohn Wood</hi>'s present Voyage in search of a Passage by the <hi>North-Pole,</hi> &amp;c.</head>
            <byline>By <hi>JOSEPH MOXON,</hi> Hydrographer to the King's most Excellent Majesty.</byline>
            <p>I Formerly set forth a small Pamphlet intituled, <hi>A brief Discourse of a Passage by the</hi> North-Pole <hi>to</hi> Japan, China, <hi>&amp;c. with a small Map of the Countries about the</hi> Pole: Which Pamphlet of mine, when it came to the sight of that worthy and ingenious Commander, my good friend, Capt. <hi>Iohn Wood,</hi> had the luck to be so accept<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able to him, that upon the Consideration of my Arguments, he resolved to use his in<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>terest with the King, to set him forth in a Ship upon this Discovery: And now he is, Ihope, happily upon it, if by this time he hath not found it. But that Draft being ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>judged by some Gentlemen, of my acquaintance, too small for their more nice inquiries into the Attempts that have formerly been made to find a Passage both by the <hi>North-East,</hi> and also by the <hi>North-West,</hi> they solicited me to set forth one so large as conveniently I could upon a Royal sheet of Paper, with some brief Notes and Observations upon the proceedings of such English Commanders that have attempted to finde a Passage either way: and also because they knew I us'd to keep frequent Conferences and Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sultations with Capt. <hi>Wood,</hi> to describe the Track of his intended Voyage: To gratifie whom, and to satisfie others that dayly enquire of me concerning his Voyage, I have herein complied with their requests, and set forth this Draft, and the Relations of for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer Voyages to the <hi>North-East</hi> and <hi>North-west,</hi> with two Passages taken out of Dutch Journals relating to a farther confirmation of a Passage, and also the Track he intended to sail before he set forth.</p>
            <p>The First therefore we find recorded in <hi>Hackluit,</hi> fol. 265. was Sir <hi>Hugh Willoughby</hi> to the <hi>North-East,</hi> who set forth from <hi>Deptford, May</hi> 10. 1553. with three Ships, <hi>viz.</hi> the <hi>Bona Esperanza,</hi> the <hi>Edward Bonadventure,</hi> and the <hi>Bona Confidentia,</hi> and sailed as far as Sir <hi>Hugh Willoughby</hi>'s Land in the Latitude of 72; from whence he returned <hi>South<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward</hi> into <hi>Lapland,</hi> where in the Haven of <hi>Arzina</hi> he intended to winter; but he and all his company perished there with extremity of cold.</p>
            <p>The Second was Capt. <hi>Stephen Burrough,</hi> in a Pinace called the <hi>Searchthrift,</hi> to the <hi>North-East,</hi> who set forth from <hi>Radclif, April</hi> 23. 1556, and sailed almost to <hi>Novae Zembla,</hi> where finding bad wind and weather, and the Winter drawing on, he returned home.</p>
            <p>The Third was Sir <hi>Martin Frobrisher</hi> to the <hi>North-west,</hi> who set forth from <hi>Blackwall</hi> with two small Barques of 25 Tuns apiece, and a Pinace of 10 Tuns, <hi>Iune</hi> 15. 1577, and sailed 60 leagues up <hi>Frobrisher-Straits,</hi> where he lost his Boat and five of his men by the Salvages, which were never heard of since; but the abundance of Ice and ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tremity of Cold forced him to return home.</p>
            <p>The Fourth was Sir <hi>Martin Frobrisher</hi>'s second Voyage to the <hi>North-West,</hi> who set forth from <hi>Blackwall, May</hi> 26. 1577. with three Ships, <hi>viz.</hi> the <hi>Aid,</hi> the <hi>Michael,</hi> and the <hi>Gabriel,</hi> and sailed into <hi>Iackman</hi>'s <hi>Sound</hi> in <hi>Frobrisher</hi>'s <hi>Straits,</hi> laded their Ships with supposed Gold-Oar, and so returned home again.</p>
            <p>The Fifth was Sir <hi>Martin Frobrisher</hi>'s third Voyage to the <hi>North-West,</hi> who set forth from <hi>Harwich, May</hi> 31. 1578, with fifteen Ships, and sailed to <hi>Liecester</hi>'s <hi>Point</hi> in <hi>Fro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brisher</hi>'s <hi>Straits:</hi> Here they intended to inhabit with 120 men, and to leave them three Ships for their use; yet they did not, but onely laded their Ships as before with supposed Oar, and so returned home to <hi>England</hi> again.</p>
            <p>The Sixth was Capt. <hi>Arthur Pet,</hi> and Capt. <hi>Charles Iackman</hi> to the <hi>North-East,</hi> who set forth from <hi>Harwich</hi> with two Barques, <hi>viz.</hi> the <hi>George,</hi> and the <hi>William, May</hi> 30. 1580, and sailed about five or six leagues beyond the <hi>Weygats;</hi> but by extremity of cold and frost about the 25th of <hi>Iuly</hi> they were forced to return. The 22 of <hi>August</hi> in their re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turn, being off <hi>Colgoyeve,</hi> the <hi>George,</hi> of which Capt. <hi>Pet</hi> was Commander, lost the sight of the <hi>William,</hi> in which Capt. <hi>Iackman</hi> was Commander, who never returned, but doubtless there perished.</p>
            <p>The Seventh was Capt. <hi>Iohn Davis</hi> to the <hi>North-West,</hi> who set forth from <hi>Dartmouth</hi> with two Barques, <hi>viz.</hi> the <hi>Sunshine</hi> of 50 Tuns, and the <hi>Moonshine</hi> of 35 Tuns, <hi>Iune</hi> 7. 1585, and sailed into <hi>Davis Strait,</hi> and then returned home.</p>
            <p>The Eighth was Capt. <hi>Iohn Davis</hi>'s second Voyage to the <hi>North-west,</hi> who set forth from <hi>Dartmouth</hi> with four Ships, <hi>viz.</hi> the <hi>Mermaid</hi> 100 Tuns, the <hi>Sunshine</hi> 60 Tuns, the <hi>Moonshine</hi> 35 Tuns, and the <hi>North-star</hi> 10 Tuns, <hi>May</hi> 7. 1578, and sailed as far as the Latitude of 66. 17. Long. from <hi>London</hi> 70 deg.</p>
            <p>The Ninth was Capt. <hi>Iohn Davis</hi>'s third Voyage to the <hi>North-West,</hi> who set forth from <hi>Dartmouth</hi> with three Ships, <hi>viz.</hi> the <hi>Elizabeth,</hi> the <hi>Sunshine,</hi> and a Clinker called the <hi>Hellen of London, May</hi> 19. 1587, and sailed into the Latitude of 73 deg. on the <hi>West-</hi>side of <hi>Groynland,</hi> which he named <hi>London-Coast,</hi> and then returned home.</p>
            <p>The Tenth was Capt. <hi>George Waymouth</hi> to the <hi>North-West,</hi> who set forth with two Flyboats, one of 70 Tuns, the other of 60 Tuns, Victualled for 18 months by the <hi>Mus<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>covia</hi> and <hi>Turkey</hi> Companies, <hi>May</hi> 2. 1602, and sailed into the Latitude of 63 d. 55 m. towards <hi>London-Coast,</hi> where his men began to mutiny, and so he returned home.</p>
            <p>The Eleventh was Capt. <hi>Iohn Knight</hi> to the <hi>North-West,</hi> at the cost and charge of the <hi>Muscovia</hi> Company and the <hi>East-India</hi> Merchants, who set forth from <hi>Gravesend, A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pril</hi> 18. 1606, and sailed no farther than the Latitude of 56 <hi>deg. 48 min.</hi> for there a violent storm took him, so as his Ship bulged, and he going on shoar to endeavour to mend his Ship, was never heard of more; but with much ado the Ship returned home.</p>
            <p>The Twelfth was Capt. <hi>Henry Hudson</hi> to the <hi>North-West,</hi> who set forth of the River of <hi>Thames, April</hi> 22. 1610, and sailed into <hi>Hudson</hi>'s Bay, (which in this Draft is called <hi>Iames</hi> his Bay) but having spent too much time in search of the Passage here, so as the Winter came upon him, he was forced to winter here: And as he was about his return home, some of his men conspired against him and eight more of the Ships company, and

turned them into a Shalop to shift for themselves: but they were never heard of since; yet the Ship and some of the other men that remained in her, after a miserable Voy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>age for want of Provision, got safe home into <hi>England.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>The Thirteenth was Sir <hi>Thomas Button</hi> to the <hi>North-West,</hi> who set forth with two Ships, the <hi>Resolution,</hi> and the <hi>Discovery,</hi> Victualled for 18 months, about the beginning of <hi>May</hi> 1612, and sailed into <hi>Button</hi>'s Bay, where he wintered in a small River called <hi>Port Nelson,</hi> in Lat. 57. 10. But the next year he continued his search of a Passage in the same Bay, and Coasted to and fro till he came into the Latitude of 62 <hi>deg. 57 min.</hi> and then the year being spent, he returned home.</p>
            <p>The Fourteenth was Capt. <hi>Gibbons</hi> to the <hi>North-West,</hi> who set forth with a Ship cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led the <hi>Discovery,</hi> in the year 1614; but sailed no farther than the mouth of <hi>Hudson's Straits,</hi> where he was frozen in for 20 weeks in Lat. 57, in a little Bay which his men called <hi>Gibbons his Hole;</hi> and the season being thus spent, he was forced to return.</p>
            <p>The Fifteenth was Capt. <hi>Bilot</hi> to the <hi>North-West,</hi> in the <hi>Discovery,</hi> Burthen 55 Tuns, in the year 1615; who sailed as far as <hi>Cape Comfort</hi> in the Lat. of 65 <hi>deg.</hi> 25. <hi>min.</hi> being to the <hi>Northwards</hi> of <hi>Button</hi>'s Bay, and so returned home.</p>
            <p>The Sixteenth was Mr. <hi>Will. Baffin</hi> to the <hi>North-West,</hi> set forth at the charge of Sir <hi>Dud<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ley Diggs,</hi> Sir <hi>Tho. Smith,</hi> Mr. <hi>Iohn Wolstenholme</hi> 
               <abbr>Esq</abbr> and Alderman <hi>Iones,</hi> in the <hi>Dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>covery,</hi> 1616; he sailed round that great Bay called <hi>Baffin</hi>'s Bay, into the Latitude of 79 <hi>deg.</hi> and finding no Passage, returned home.</p>
            <p>The Seventeenth and Eighteenth were Capt. <hi>Luke Fox,</hi> and Capt. <hi>Thomas Iames,</hi> who set forth 1631, who searched round <hi>Hudson</hi>'s Bay, and <hi>Button</hi>'s Bay: But their Voyages being the last that have been made to the <hi>North-West</hi> upon a Discovery, I have with prick<gap reason="illegible" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>lines, traced down in the Draft it self, therefore I refer you to it.</p>
            <p>Capt. <hi>Iames</hi> was forced to winter in <hi>Iames</hi> his Bay, where he suffered great hard<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ships, and the loss of some of his men by extremities of cold and frosts; but the next year returned with his Ship home.</p>
            <p>Here you may perceive, that all the Attempts made to the <hi>North-West,</hi> were made in several Bays; and indeed the whole Sea it self, where the Passage was expected to be found, is but one great Bay, which receives great quantities of Ice out of many fresh-water Rivers that empty themselves into it, and so this Sea or great Bay delivers it in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to <hi>Hudson</hi>'s <hi>Straits,</hi> which makes that so unpassable. And the attempted Passage by the <hi>North-East</hi> is found but a great fresh-water Bay, which also receives the Ice of ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny fresh-water Rivers into it, and so makes that unpassable: as appears by the Copy of that Letter sent from <hi>Muscovy</hi> to <hi>Amsterdam,</hi> and from <hi>Amsterdam</hi> to Mr. <hi>Oldenburgh,</hi> Secretary to the Royal Society, which he published in <hi>Transact.</hi> 101<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> which I also set forth in my <hi>Brief Discourse of the Passage by the</hi> North-Pole <hi>to</hi> Japan, China, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> to either of which I refer you.</p>
            <p>Besides these performed by English men, there have been other attempts made for the finding of a Passage to <hi>Iapan, China,</hi> &amp;c. both by the <hi>Danes,</hi> and <hi>Dutch;</hi> but the <hi>Dutch</hi> have made the fairest Progress therein: For one <hi>William Barents</hi> being satisfied that no Passage was between <hi>Nova Zembla</hi> and the Main, steered his Course to the <hi>Northwards</hi> of <hi>Nova Zembla,</hi> and sailed into the <hi>Tartarian</hi> Sea about 2 or 300 leagues beyond <hi>Nova Zembla;</hi> and had doubtless sailed through, had not the <hi>Dutch East-India</hi> Company (a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainst whose interest it was) corrupted him, and taken him off the prosecution.</p>
            <p>They have also made such other Navigations from the <hi>East-Indies,</hi> as may in my opi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion satisfie any considerate understanding person of a Passage; and more especially the Navigations of two Ships, whose Journals have come to my hands. One was a Ship sent from <hi>Batavia,</hi> to discover beyond <hi>Iapan</hi> to the <hi>Northwards,</hi> because of reports they had in <hi>Batavia</hi> of Gold and Silver-mines to be in <hi>Yedso,</hi> or some Countries or Islands a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout it; which ship having sailed somewhat beyond <hi>Yedso,</hi> in their Journal they write, that <hi>to their great amazement they found themselves in the</hi> Tartarian <hi>Ocean.</hi> This Sen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tence I did perceive, by the scope of the whole Journal, was writ without designe, nay, not so much as reflection upon a Passage; and therefore I think it may be accepted for truth.</p>
            <p>The other Navigation was of a Ship sent from <hi>Batavia,</hi> and intended for <hi>Iapan</hi> to trade; but by contrary winds was driven to <hi>Corea,</hi> a little to the <hi>Westward</hi> of <hi>Iapan,</hi> where a violent storm arising, the Ship was broken to pieces, and of 64 men in her, only 36 escaped shipwrack, and were made Slaves of by the <hi>Coreans:</hi> but after 13 years slavery there was no more than 16 of these men left alive, and 8 of them escaped in a Boat, and got to <hi>Iapan</hi> among their Country-men. <hi>Hendrick Hamel</hi> of <hi>Gorcum</hi> was the Book-keeper to the Ship, and kept the Journal of their Voyage, and Passages that happened to them in their Slavery; which Journal and Passages was afterwards printed at <hi>Rotterdam,</hi> together with <hi>A brief Description of the Kingdom of</hi> Corea; <hi>with its Laws, Maxims, and Policies both Civil and Military:</hi> And in this Description of <hi>Corea,</hi> he relates as follows: <hi>That on the</hi> West-<hi>side trends the Coast of</hi> China, <hi>or the Bay of</hi> Nankin; <hi>and that its</hi> North-<hi>end is fastened to</hi> China <hi>with a mighty huge Mountain, which makes</hi> Corea <hi>no Island but a Peninsula, because that on the</hi> North-East-<hi>side is no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing but an open Sea, in which is found every year many Whales with</hi> French <hi>and</hi> Hol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land <hi>Harping-irons in their bodies. There is also in the months of</hi> December, January, February, <hi>and</hi> March, <hi>great quantities of Herrings caught, which in the two first months are very like the</hi> Hollands <hi>Herrings, and in the two other months are much less, like the Pan-herrings in</hi> Holland; <hi>so that of necessity it must follow, that between</hi> Japan <hi>and</hi> Corea <hi>there must be a Passage to the</hi> Wey-gats. [Note, this Writer should have said, <hi>A Passage to</hi> Nova Zembla, <hi>or</hi> Greenland: For a Passage through the <hi>Weygats</hi> is since contradicted by the Discovery made by the express order of the Czar of <hi>Muscovy,</hi> as appears by the Letter aforesaid sent to Mr. <hi>Oldenburg.] And we have,</hi> saith he, <hi>often en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quired of the</hi> Coreans <hi>that inhabited on the</hi> North-East-<hi>side of</hi> Corea, <hi>if there were any more Land on the</hi> North-East-<hi>side:</hi> but they answered us, <hi>No, there is nothing but an o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pen Sea.</hi>
