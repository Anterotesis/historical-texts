            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            <head>A PROPOSAL
OF
UNION
AMONGST
PROTESTANTS,
FROM THE
LAST-WILL
Of the Most Reverend
Doctor SANDS
Sometime Archbishop of YORK;
(As the Sentiment of the first Reformers)
Humbly presented to the PARLIAMENT.</head>
            <opener>
               <salute>Right Honourable,</salute>
            </opener>
            <p>FOR the divisions of <hi>Reuben</hi> there once were great thoughts and search<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings
of heart; and well may there be the like at this day for those among
us in <hi>England,</hi> by which, not the <hi>seamless Coat of Christ,</hi> but his <hi>precious
mystical Body</hi> is miserably rent and torn in pieces. At this many are ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceeding
angry (if from a right principle it is well), and complaints do
every where abound; But what, ah! what is done in order to a Cure? Some indeed
have offer'd at it, but greatly mistaken their way, inflaming the wounds, instead of
healing them. Peace with God, and Conscience, and among the Brethren, is that
Legacy, which our dearest Lord left unto his Disciples. Cordial and mutual love
springing up in all expressions of kindness, is that amiable Badg by which he would
have them known in the World. In a word, <hi>Vnion</hi> and <hi>Communion</hi> among Christi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans,
is both the beauty and strength of the Church; That renders her <hi>lovely as a Ci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty
compacted together, and terrible as an Army with Banners.</hi> Hence it is, that our
Saviour did so earnestly pray his Father, that his people might be <hi>one,</hi> and <hi>made
perfect in one;</hi> and <hi>Paul</hi> did with utmost importunity press the <hi>Philippians</hi> to have the
same love, to be like minded, and of one accord. And oh! that all, upon whom
the name of Christ is called, would carefully attend to this Advice, and follow it,
keeping <hi>The unity of the spirit in the bond of peace:</hi> For by this means our <hi>Church</hi>
would become a <hi>Paradise,</hi> and <hi>Earth</hi> a kind of <hi>Heaven.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <pb n="2" facs="tcp:54432:2"/>
To endeavour, and (by the happy concurrence of a Divine Blessing) to effect
so great and good a work as <hi>unity in the Church,</hi> and <hi>concord among Christians,</hi> is
most worthy of so August an Assembly as an <hi>English Parliament;</hi> yea, of <hi>such</hi> a Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liament
as you are, whom we have many and many a year longed for, and do now
with our souls rejoyce to see. What doth more nearly concern you, or what pos<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sibly
can more highly exalt you in the love<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> and esteem of all truly religious and so<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber
persons both in the present and future Generations, than your being instruments
in the Divine hand for the undoing of <hi>heavy burdens,</hi> breaking every <hi>oppressing yoke,</hi>
and taking <hi>stumbling blocks</hi> out of the way, that all the Sons and Daughters of <hi>Sion</hi>
may worship God in the <hi>Beauties of holiness, with one shoulder, and with one con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sent.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>And is not this a time for it? Is not this <hi>the</hi> time? When can you find a fitter?
When can <hi>healing-endeavours</hi> be more in season? Violence of storms should drive
the Sheep together. <hi>Desperate Plots,</hi> practices and attempts of busie and <hi>irrecon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cilable
enemies,</hi> should more closely and firmly unite <hi>jarring friends. Hannibal</hi> is
at the Gate. The <hi>Pope</hi> and his <hi>Emissaries,</hi> the <hi>Iesuits</hi> with their Vassals, seek our
ruine. They have been long travailing with mischief, and brought to the birth,
and were at the very point of bringing forth, had not our Gracious God wonder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fully
interposed both for discovery and prevention. Oh! Let not <hi>Protestants</hi> de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vour
one another, when their <hi>Popish Adversaries</hi> would devour all; who are not
yet satisfied, but as much as ever thirst for blood. Besides, not only the <hi>rage of men,</hi>
but the <hi>Rod of God</hi> should teach us peace and quietness. It becomes us to give
over our unchristian contendings with one another, seeing God hath with great se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verity
in various ways contended with us all. Sundry years we have been in the
furnace of affliction, and should be so througly melted, as easily to run into <hi>one:</hi> I
mean all those in <hi>England</hi> who fear God, and desire to see the King of Saints in his
beauty. I know there is an implacable enmity put by God himself between the
<hi>seed of the woman,</hi> and the <hi>seed of the serpent;</hi> and as <hi>Luther</hi> saith, <hi>Cain</hi> will mur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der
<hi>Abel</hi> to the end of the world. But if any, professing Religion, should be of im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>placable
spirits, resolved to carry their heats and animosities down with them to the
Grave, their speedy march off would be a mercy to the <hi>Church</hi> and <hi>Nation,</hi> unless
God please to mollifie their hearts into a brotherly compliance upon good terms.
And blessed be his Name, there is a <hi>cementing, healing spirit</hi> to be found among ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny,
very many in the Nation, who long for <hi>peace,</hi> and pray for <hi>peace,</hi> and are most
willing to deny themselves, and do any thing for <hi>peace,</hi> only they dare not forsake
<hi>holiness,</hi> neglect their Duty, nor wound their Consciences by offending God: And
I doubt not, but many of their Brethren would go far to meet them, and welcom
that day in which all middle-walls of partition shall be broken down. How sweet,
how exceeding sweet is that passage lately dropt from the Lip and Pen of that very
Learned and Reverend Divine, Dr. <hi>Tillotson, Being Brethren upon so many accounts,
and by so many bonds and endearments all united to one another, and all travelling to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward
the same countrey, why do we fall out by the way? Since we are Brethren, why
do we not, as becomes Brethren, dwell together in unity?</hi>
            </p>
            <p>His Most Excellent Majesty (under whose refrigerating shadow we have enjoyed
so much tranquillity) hath made frequent motions for the composing of differences
among us; but unto this day, too too few in <hi>place</hi> and <hi>power</hi> have written after so
fair a Copy, or trodden in the steps of His Royal clemency. He hath now again in
His late most gracious Speech to your Honours, propounded <hi>Vnion</hi> as the <hi>end</hi> he ai<gap reason="illegible" extent="2 letters">
                  <desc>••</desc>
               </gap>
at, and <hi>which,</hi> he wisheth, <hi>would be extended to Protestants abroad as well as at
home.</hi> A Saying most highly becoming so <hi>Great a Prince,</hi> a <hi>Defender of the Faith,</hi>
and unquestionably, <hi>Chief of the Protestant Party.</hi> God grant he may live long,
and act vigorously toward the effecting of so glorious a design, that not only we,
but the Children yet unborn may rise up and call him blessed. Most Noble Sirs,
give us leave with some confidence to hope, that you are like-minded, and herein
will joyn issue with His Sacred Majesty. Among those other weighty and arduous
<pb n="3" facs="tcp:54432:2"/>
affairs which will be before you, be pleased, as our great Physicians, to reach out to
us an healing hand.</p>
            <p>A Divine told us of late. That the Church of <hi>England</hi> is ready with open arms to
embrace those that do dissent; and it may be rationally concluded, that <hi>Dissenters</hi>
are full out as ready to be embraced; doubtless those that have been so long <hi>under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>foot,</hi>
and in the <hi>dust,</hi> having very hard measure meted out to them, would gladly
be taken up now into the <hi>arms;</hi> surely such unwonted kindness would fill their mouths
with thankfulness, and put them into an extacy of joy provided there be nothing in
the terms to choak them. It is no kindness to <hi>hug</hi> the man, and <hi>wound</hi> his consci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence.
May it please you, <hi>Right Honourable,</hi> with a <hi>tender hand,</hi> by a <hi>safe and right
way,</hi> to bring them into the <hi>bosom of their Mother.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>It is not for me, the meanest of ten thousand, to act <hi>the Dictator;</hi> no, no, I will
turn <hi>Orator,</hi> and humbly pray, That you may be all taught of God, and endued
with a Spirit of Wisdom and Understanding, to find out proper and effectual means
and methods, for the bringing about this ever-to be desired harmony and accord a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mong
Protestants. Only this I crave leave with all humility and earnestness to beg,
That what God hath not set up in the Church, may be pull'd down; and those things
taken out of the way, which have been, and always will be bones of contention a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mong
persons <hi>truly learned</hi> and <hi>godly.</hi> May that be rejected as an <hi>Innovation,</hi> which
is not as <hi>old as the Apostles;</hi> and nothing imposed upon Ministers or People, but what
hath footing and warrant in the <hi>holy Scriptures:</hi> Oh that all <hi>Dissenters</hi> would come
up to the <hi>Church of England,</hi> as far as ever they can with a <hi>good conscience;</hi> and oh
that they also may be so far condescended to. And certainly it can neither be pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>judicial
to the Church to yield in those things which <hi>(Dissenters</hi> account sinful, and)
she her self calls <hi>indifferent;</hi> and upon that score are at best but <hi>chips in Porridg,</hi>
not worth contending for. Nor can it be any unhandsome or dishonourable re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flexion
upon our first <hi>Renowned Reformers,</hi> whose Memory is deservedly dear to us;
for they did famously in this our <hi>Israel,</hi> casting out abundance of <hi>filth</hi> and <hi>rubbish,</hi>
laying a good <hi>foundation,</hi> and making an admirable progress in the <hi>structure;</hi> yet
such was the iniquity of the Times, the rage of their Enemies, and the opposition
they met with, that they did not, nay they could not finish the work, nor add the
<hi>top-stone</hi> to the <hi>Reformation,</hi> but left something for their Successors to do, which
are You: the good Lord give you an heart to do it. <hi>Rome was not built,</hi> nor could
it be <hi>pull'd down in a day,</hi> or in an Age.</p>
            <p>Since therefore His most Sacred Majesty, (being thorowly sensible of the great ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vantage
our common Enemy, the <hi>Papist,</hi> hath received by the breaches that have not
only been made, but hitherto continued among such as profess the same faith), hath
been graciously pleased to recommend to your special care the concern of the <hi>Prote<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stant
interest,</hi> as well at <hi>home</hi> as <hi>abroad,</hi> and hath commanded the Honourable the
Lord Chancellor of <hi>England</hi> to acquaint you, that he judgeth it a thing ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cessary
for you in your great Wisdom, to find out some way for the relief of such
Protestants as do <hi>wander</hi> only from the Church of <hi>England,</hi> thorow the tenderness
of their consciences, being such as would not destroy it, but do build upon the same
foundation with your selves; I take upon me the humble boldness to offer to your
Honours serious Consideration, the <hi>Sentiments,</hi> and very words of one of the very
<hi>first Reformers</hi> of our <hi>Church of England<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
               </hi> as it remains upon Record, being extracted
out of the <hi>Last Will and Testament</hi> of the most Reverend Father in God, <hi>Edward
Sands,</hi> late Arch-Bishop of <hi>York,</hi> being the general sense of the said Reformers, of
which you may be more fully satisfied from the words themselves.</p>

                        <p>COncerning Rights and Ceremonies, by Political Constitutions authorized among us;
As I am, and have been perswaded, that such as are set down by publick Autho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity
in this Church of <hi>England,</hi> are no way either ungodly or unlawful, but may with
good conscience for order and obedience-sake be used of a good Christian (for the pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vate

<pb n="4" facs="tcp:54432:3"/>
so have I ever been, and presently am perswaded, that some of them be not so expedient
for this Church now, but that in the Church reformed, and in all this time of the Gos<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pel,

in my conscience, all such rude and undigested platforms as have been more lately and
boldly, than either learnedly or wisely preferred, tending not to the Reformation,
but to the destruction of the Church of <hi>England.</hi> The particularities of both sorts re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferred

of a <hi>small private Church,</hi> and the form of a <hi>large Christian Kingdom,</hi> neither would
long like, nor can at all brook one and the same Ecclesiastical Government. Thus much
I thought good to testifie concerning these Ecclesiastical matters, to clear me of all sus<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>picion

Office, I have not halted, but walked sincerely according to that skill and ability which

<hi>viz.</hi> It is not for private persons to undertake in matters of publick concern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment;
but I think we have no cause to doubt, but the Governours of our Church (not<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>withstanding
all the advantages of Authority, (and we think of Reason too on our side)
are persons of that Piety and Prudence, that for peace-sake, and in order to a firm Vnion
among Protestants, they would be content, if that would do it, not to insist upon little
things, but to yield them up, whether to the infirmity, or importunity, or perhaps in some
very few things, to the plausible exceptions of those who differ from us. <hi>Oh that it may
be according to his word; and so I shall most cheerfully yield to him, that,</hi> On the
other side, men ought to bring along with them a peaceable disposition, and a mind rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy
to comply with the Church in which they were born and baptized, in all reasonable
and lawful things, and desirous upon any terms that are tolerable to return to the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>munion
of it; a mind free from passion and prejudice, from peevish exceptions, and
groundless and endless scruples: <hi>And such I perswade my self all sober and Pious
Dissenters will be found.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>And now, Right Honourable, I humbly crave your gracious entertainment of these
few lines, sent indeed from a mean and unknown hand, but from an heart full-fraught
with Loyalty to His Majesty, and dutiful respects to your Honours, and Zeal for the
Purity, Peace and Prosperity of the Reformed Church, and particularly that part
of it, which Gods right hand hath planted in this famous Island. I shall not sin in
ceasing to pray, <q>That the good hand of God may be upon you, that he would spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit,
direct, assist and succeed you, that you may be the <hi>repairers of our breaches,</hi> and
<hi>the restorers of paths to dwell in.</hi> The Father of mercies, and God of peace grant,
that there may be no longer among us the noise of Axes and Hammers; no more
crumbling into parties and factions, no more divisions nor causes of them; but
that our <hi>English Ierusalem</hi> may be as a Bride made ready for her Husband. That
upon all our Assemblies there may be a glory, and upon that glory a defence.</q>
