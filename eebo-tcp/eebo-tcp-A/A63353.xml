            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            <head>To the RIGHT HONOURABLE Sir Thomas Pilkington, Kt. LORD MAYOR OF THE City of London.</head>
            <p>THO' there be ſeveral Remarkable Occurrences Contri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>buting to the Solemnity of this Day, (as the Preſence of their Majeſties, the Court, <hi>&amp;c.)</hi> yet the general Joy, and Satisfaction of the City, is no leſs Worthy of Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cord, which is an Univerſal as their PREPARATIONS are Publick. Nor can it Chuſe but add a Rubrick in the Kalender of Your Life, that you were the firſt Advanced to the Pretorical Chair of this Great <hi>Metropolis,</hi> after the Year of Redemption, the Happy Day of Deliverance from <hi>Pagan</hi> and <hi>Egyptian</hi> Bondage, by Miracles and Wonders. When Ido<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>latry, like a Deluge, had Over-ſpread the Land, and the Church, like the Ark, lay Tottering upon the Billows, then came the <hi>Dove</hi> with the <hi>Olive-Branch</hi> of <hi>Joy;</hi> He Allay'd the Swelling of the Waters, Reſtoring us to our Liberty, and Religion. When Arbitrary Force, and Lawleſs Uſurpation had Unreaſonably Impoſed upon us New <hi>Lords,</hi> and New <hi>Laws,</hi> contrary to the Practice, and known Cuſtoms, of this City. Then did You, in Defence of our Juſt Rights and Liberties, ſtand in the Gap, and Bravely Oppos'd the Violence of the Impetu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous Torrent. So great a Champion were You, and ſo zealous an Aſſerter of theſe Rights, that You prefer'd our Privi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leges before your Liberty, and Glorying in Your Chains, while
<pb facs="tcp:100280:3"/>
You were yet a Magiſtrate, became Twice a Priſoner. Like <hi>Daniel,</hi> You are taken out of the Lion's Den to be a Ruler o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver us. Nor had thoſe Ravenous Beaſts any Power over You, altho' their Malice was ſufficiently Exaſperated againſt You. Their Jaws were ſtop'd till the Delivering Monarch Order'd You Enlargement, raiſing You Higher by Your <hi>Fall,</hi> and a greater Object of His Favour by Your <hi>Sufferings.</hi> This Royal Bounty of the Prince could not but beget in us a Grate<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful Emulation to Prefer You in the City, for whoſe ſake You had Suffer'd ſuch long and ſevere Perſecution. The Chair being Vacant by the Death of Sir <hi>John Chapman,</hi> with one Conſent You are Choſen for the remaining Time, and then with an Unanimous Heart and Voice of the Elective Aſſem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>blies to continue for the Enſuing Year. <hi>My Lord,</hi> we men<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion not this as a Favour done, but as a Debt due to Your Suf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferings, and at laſt ſhould think all this too little, were it in our Power to do more. This muſt ſtop the Mouth of Envy, that all Tongues muſt confeſs Your own Merits have moſt juſtly Advanced You. You have Aſſerted our Rights, Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtor'd our Cuſtoms, and Immunities. Every thing runs clear in its proper Channel. That it may never again be Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſturb'd by the Violence of Impetuous and Arbitrary Men, is the Prayer of</p>

               <p>AS a further Mark of their Bounty, the Company have this Year Added the Ship <hi>Perſeus</hi> and <hi>Andromeda,</hi> In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward Bound, from the <hi>LEVANT,</hi> Laden with Spices, Silks, Furs, Sables, Panthers, and all manner of Beaſts Skins, hanging in the Shrouds and Rigging. This Ship is peculiarly Attributed to the Lord Mayor, as a proper Emblem and Characteriſtick of his way of Traffick and Adventure, being a <hi>Turkey Merchant.</hi> Nor is the Name of <hi>Perſeus</hi> and <hi>Andromeda</hi> leſs properly Apply'd, having Analogy and Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpect, as well to his Lordſhip, as the Company. <hi>Perſeus</hi> was the Son of <hi>Jupiter</hi> and <hi>Danae. Mercury</hi> gave him Wings, that is, Sails, with which he Mounts his <hi>Pegaſus,</hi> that is, his

This is peculiarly Adopted to his Lordſhip, who has over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come his Malicious Enemies, and this Day Rides in Triumph over them. <hi>Minerva</hi> gives him a Golden ſhield Cover'd with a <hi>Goat</hi> Skin, called <hi>Aegis,</hi> which is an <hi>Hieroglyphick</hi> of the Companies. He Reſcues <hi>Andromeda</hi> from the Sea-Monſter; the Moral is, the Church from the Deluge, that was ready to Over-flow it. How Applicable this is to the preſent Revoluti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons of this Year, will need no Comment to Explain.</p>
               <p>This Ship has on Board it a Jolly Brave Captain, Maſter, Gunner and his Mate, Boatſwain, Pilot, beſides the ſhip's Crew, continually Toping, Bouſing, and Carouſing, who for Joy of coming into <hi>England,</hi> having the Pot, or Quar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter-Can, continually at their Noſes, get Merry with Drink<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing their Majeſties, and his Lordſhips Health, diſcharging a Cannon at every Round.
