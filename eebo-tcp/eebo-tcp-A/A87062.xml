            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            <head>To the Right Honourable the High Court of PARLIAMENT.</head>
            <head type="sub">The humble Petition of <hi>Edward Hanchett,</hi> 
               <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>ſher of the late Court of Wards and Liveries.</head>
            <p>
               <seg rend="decorInit">H</seg>Umbly ſheweth unto your Honours, That your Petitioner did purchaſe the Office of Uſher to the Court, to him and his Heirs for ever, at the rate of 4000 l. it being an Office of in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>heritance granted by Letters Patents under the great Seale of <hi>England.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>About 4. yeares after that your Petitioner was poſſeſſed of the ſaid Office, the High Court of Parliament were pleaſed to take away the ſaid Court, but in their juſtice thought fit, that the Officers of the Court which had their places by Letters Patents under the great Seale of <hi>England,</hi> ſhould have a competent ſatisfaction for the loſſe of their Offices, and in order thereunto, referred it to a Committee of their own Members to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſider and make allowances to the ſeverall Officers, who did upon ſerious conſideration allow to your Petitioner the ſum of 3500 l. for the loſſe of his ſaid Office.</p>
            <p>The great Officers of the ſaid Court were Members of Parliament, and did procure the ſatisfaction allotted to them; your Petitioner had the ſame Juſtice for him, but not the ſame Friends.</p>
            <p>Notwithſtanding the ſaid Order and Vote of the Houſe, and your Peti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tioners conſtant, and faithfull adhering to the Cauſe and Intereſt of the Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liament, even in their greateſt extremities, your Petitioner being ſent for by the late King to execute his Office at <hi>Oxford,</hi> upon paine of loſing it, and refuſed to go, to the hazard of his utter undoing, if the King had prevailed, and your Petitioner as yet hath had no recompence.</p>
            <p>Your Petitioner borrowed a great part of the money that purchaſed the ſaid Office; upon the diſſolution of the Court your Petitioner was diſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bled to pay his Debts, and was ſoon after clapped up Priſoner in the Upper Bench, and there hath remained ever ſince, to his utter ruine and deſtruction, having ſold all his goods and perſonall Eſtate to maintain himſelfe and his Wife, and ſatisfie his Creditors what he could, that now your Petitioner is in a very ſaid condition, not able to ſubſiſt, his friends having been wearied with ſo long ſupplying his great wants and neceſſities, unleſſe this honoura<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble Parliament be pleaſed to conſider his Cauſe that crieth for their Juſtice, and afford him ſuch reliefe as their Wiſdomes ſhall think convenient.</p>
            <closer>And your Petitioner ſhall ever pray, &amp;c.</closer>
