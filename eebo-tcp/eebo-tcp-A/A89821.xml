            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            <head>THE Navall Expedition, OF The Right Honourable, <hi>Robert</hi> Earl of <hi>Warwicke,</hi> (Lord High Admirall of ENGLAND) a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt the revolted Ships.</head>
            <p>
               <seg rend="decorInit">W</seg>Hen wee call to minde thoſe many acts of Gods providence and goodneſſe, which was manifeſted from time to time to the Parliaments Fleet under the Command of the Right Honourable <hi>Robert</hi> Earl of <hi>Warwicke,</hi> Lord High Admirall of <hi>Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land</hi> in the late expedition againſt the revolted ſhips, who had moſt perfidiouſly betrayed their truſt, as alſo their owne conſciences in violating and breaking thoſe Oaths and Proteſtations which the Officers and Marriners of the ſaid ſhip, had formerly taken to be true to the Parliament and Kingdomes.
<pb n="4" facs="tcp:115274:3"/>Therefore wee ſay, having had much experience of Gods love and goodneſſe in the ſaid juſt undertakings for the Kingdomes, We thought our ſelves obliged from that duty wee owe unto Al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mighty God the Author of this great mercy, and to all Chriſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>an good men who are lovers of truth and righteouſneſſe, and alſo their Countreyes liberties, not to be altogether ſilent in this, but to ſpeake and publiſh ſorth ſomething of it to the World, that all ſuch who feare the Lord, may praiſe his Name with us, who have been eye-witneſſes of Gods power and goodneſſe in ow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning of us, and wee doe verily believe it may convince many, who were then great Enemies to our late proceedings, if they ſhall ſeriouſly lay to heart the following particulars.</p>
            <p>As firſt, when our Lord Admirall went to <hi>Chatham,</hi> to or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der the ſetting out of ſhips appointed for that ſervice, It is not unknown to many, that his Lordſhip had many Enemies who laboured night and day as much as in them lay to obſtruct the ſetting forth the ſaid Fleet, and yet many of theſe would be ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>counted faithfull Members to the Parliament and Kingdome, but they at that time proved themſelves to be the Kingdomes greateſt Enemies.</p>
            <p>Secondly, There was great endeavouring in all places to hin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der the Sea-men from engaging thoſe wicked Revolters, and to accompliſh this if it had beene poſſible, there were great and large promiſes made to ſeverall Marriners in caſe they would forbeare Engaging in that Cauſe of God, which they themſelves and many thouſands had long ſerved in, and ſo long as they con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinued faithfull to their Engagements, Gods bleſſing and favour was ſtill upon them in their undertakings.</p>
            <p>Thirdly, The falling off of the Sea-men, was (as it were) univerſall in all places, for that a mighty ſpirit of Errour and Deluſion had poſſeſt them, inſomuch as they were for a time gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven over to ſtrong deluſions to believe lyes, and ſo farre blinded in their judgements, that many or moſt of them went againſt their owne Intereſt, in ſtanding for thoſe who reſolved to joyne with the Iriſh or any Sea-rover whatſoever, to accompliſh and
<pb n="5" facs="tcp:115274:3"/>bring to paſſe their wikced deſignes. And certainly this was the very roade to have deſtroyed all Trade: and that ſailing, Mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riners with their Families in a ſhort time might beg their bread: and to confirme the truth of this, we doe believe many can ſpeak by ſad experience, who have ſuffered in the loſſe of their ſhips and goods which were ſurprized by the Revolters, and ſince that what a Harveſt hath the Iriſh had upon the Merchant and owner, even unto the undoing of ſome, and all this principally occaſio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned by the revolt of the ſaid ſhips.</p>
            <p>Fourthly, The malice, rage, and madneſſe of many was ſo high againſt all who engaged under his Lordſhip, that their mouths were filled with curſings, railings, and revilings, ſaying many of them, that our going forth would prove our deſtruction. And this our Enemies were confident of, though (bleſſed be God) we were perſwaded to the contrary, knowing the Cauſe to be Gods Cauſe wee engaged in: But notwithſtanding all this Oppoſition and Malignant working, there were a number of faithfull and cordiall men, whoſe hearts God drew forth to en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gage with his Lordſhip, and for others who were (unſtable in their mindes) as the Apoſtle ſaith, wanting principles to cary them out in ſuch a time, when ſo much difficulty appeared: and for theſe many of them as they were taught, did often ſay, that they would never engage againſt their Brothers, as they called them. But when the Prince his Fleet came up into the River with a full aſſurance of having moſt or all the ſhips which then were with his Lordſhip. Wee ſay at that time of their comming up, Almighty God was pleaſed then to ſhew his pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er in changing the hearts of many who were unſtable, inſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>much that they immediately reſolved as one man to live and dye with his Lordſhip againſt the Revolters, though then they in number for ſhipping and men were more then his Lordſhip, the Portſmouth Fleete not then being joyned with him, and this great worke of ſetting the hearts of the men right, was imme<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diately done at the very time they had firſt fight of the Enemy, and wee muſt acknowledge this to be Gods owne worke, for none hath power over the hearts of the Sonnes of men but him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelfe, being able to change them as he pleaſesh. At that time
<pb n="6" facs="tcp:115274:4"/>his Lordſhip called a Councell of Warre, finding much gal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lantry and reſolution amongſt his men, that it was then reſol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved to fight the Revolters; which accordingly had been done, had not the Almighty prevented the ſame by a ſuddaine guſt of winde which came downe upon them and us, and in this was a ſpeciall hand of Providence; For had there beene an Engage<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment at that time in the place wee and they were in, being a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mongſt the Sands, in all probability, it would have hazarded all or the loſſe of the greateſt part of both the Fleetes, but this was prevented by the hand of Heaven.</p>
            <p>Fifthly, As his Lordſhip had much experience of the Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter-workings of Enemies, ſo wee the reſpective Commanders of <hi>Portſmouth</hi> and <hi>Harwich</hi> ſhips under his Lordſhips command, had ſufficient Experience of Malignant Agents working amongſt our men, as they had opportunity to meete them aſhore, fil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling their heads with lyes and falſities, as telling them the Prince had forty States-men of Warre with him, many Danes ſhips, and the like, but this was not all; for they had variety of lyes, which they daily ſpread amongſt them, purpoſely to diſtract them, and breake our Deſigne of comming forth if they could, which horrid wicked lying ſpirit, then working in all parts, wee confeſſe occaſioned many diſturbances among the men, to the griefe and ſadning the ſpirits of all honeſt men who beheld the ſame: but the bleſſing of God being upon our Endeavours, who were the reſpective Commanders, wee brought the ſhips to Sea ſo ſoone as wee had Order from his Lordſhip to ſaile towards him, and the twenty ſeventh of <hi>Auguſt</hi> was the day the <hi>Portſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mouth</hi> Fleet ſet ſaile from that Harbour, which in number great and ſmall were tenne: And the laſt of the ſaid moneth, the ſaid Fleet came to an Anchor off of the place called the <hi>Long-ſand</hi> head, the Revolters being then betweene the Lord Admi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rall and the <hi>Portſmouth</hi> Fleete, and about eight in the night they paſſed by, onely the <hi>Swallow</hi> their Rare-Admirall, and the <hi>Conſtant-Warwicke</hi> came in amongſt the <hi>Portſmouth</hi> Fleet to tell them lyes, ſaying they were of the Lord Admirall his Fleete, and therefore adviſed ſome whom they then ſpoke withall, to wey their Anchors and follow them, for that his Lordſhip
<pb n="7" facs="tcp:115274:4"/>(as they ſaid) with his Fleet was gone after the P<gap reason="illegible" resp="#OXF" extent="3 letters">
                  <desc>•••</desc>
               </gap>nce to the Norward: but none of this treachery or lyes of their would take with the Commanders they then ſpoke withall, God giving them more wiſdome then to believe lyes, being that which their perfidious Deſigne both by Sea and Land hath been carryed on by.</p>
            <p>The next day being <hi>Friday</hi> the firſt of <hi>September,</hi> God brought the two Fleetes to a happy conjunction, at which meeting there was great ſhouting among the men for joy: and wee are confident that newes of our joyning gladded the hearts of all honeſt men ſo ſoone as they heard of it: but as for the Enemie, it was apparant, they were filled with feare, as alſo enfatuated in their mindes and judgements, o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>therwiſe certainely they never would have paſſed by the <hi>Portſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mouth</hi> Fleete as they did, without attempting to doe ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing upon them, in regard they had advantage and ſight of them before night, in that they knew them to be the ſaid Fleete; yet they were miſtaken in them, and knew them not to be the Revolters' till they were paſſed by.</p>
            <p>In this very act of Providence among all others, we cannot but acknowledge God in it: But ſuch was the enemies feare, God bringing the 2. Flee<gap reason="illegible" resp="#OXF" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>s ſo neere a conjunction as that they would not abide to ſee their uniting, knowing the ſame would prove deſtructive to them, which undoub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tedly, had Providence ordered their ſtay one day longer up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on our Coaſt, by Gods bleſſing wee ſhould have given them their fatall blow, but their time not being come, in that their Iniquity and Sip is not yet at the height, they had liberty at that time to eſcape, and ſo fled into <hi>Holland</hi> Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minions: But after the joyning of the Portſmouth Fleet with the Lord Admiralls, his Honour ſhaped his courſe for the DOWNES, and after ſome ſhort ſtay there, at a Councell of Warre, reſolution was taken to ſayle for HOLLAND, and the ſeaventeenth of <hi>September,</hi> wee ſet Sayle out of the DOWNES with our Fleete
<pb n="6" facs="tcp:115274:5"/>the Nineteenth wee arrived at GOREE in HOL<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>LAND.</p>
            <p>Now at our going over, many of the Fleet had not much Victuall in, and after ſome time of our being there, the Winde comming faire, a Councell of Warre was called, to debate whether we ſhould there continue longer or no, and it was then reſolved, that wee ſhould cloſe with the Opportunity then preſenting for our returne to ENGLAND, and in this wee did then Vote as wee were then perſwaded in our judgements, would bee for the beſt, but no ſooner had wee taken this reſolution, but GOD Almighty the very next day that wee were to ſayle, cauſed the Winde to ſhift, which prevented our going out at that time, and wee further obſerved the Winde had beene three dayes fayre before, and all that time no reſolution taken for ſayling from GOREE, and this wee ſpeake of, that it may appeare to all honeſt men, as it hath to us, to bee GODS owne worke in detaining of us ſo long in HOLLAND, which wee hope hath not beene to no purpoſe, as ſome are ready to ſay:</p>
            <p>But as GOD was pleaſed to change the Winde at that time for our ſtay, ſo hee did immediately alter the mindes of the reſpective Commanders, in letting them ſee, that it was his will and pleaſure they ſhould abide longer there, whereby they might ſee more of his Almighty power, in breaking the ſtrength of a deſperate, perfidious, wicked, proud, inſulting Enemy; For certainly all they which knew them, will ſay as much of them, being great and deſperate Blaſphemers of the bleſſed name of GOD, deri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders of goodneſſe, and all ſuch who profeſſed the ſame, drinking till many of them dyed as it were in the place, we ſay theſe crying ſinnes were common among them, and will GOD who is a GOD of holineſſe, proſper and bleſſe ſuch in thoſe unjuſt wayes they are now upon? We leave this to all Chriſtian men to judge.</p>
            <pb n="7" facs="tcp:115274:5"/>
            <p>6ly. As God was pleaſed to order our ſtay longer in thoſe parts then we determined, ſo hath he clearely let us ſee it was for good to a poor diſtracted Kingdome. For <hi>Novem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber</hi> the fifth in the night, the <hi>Conſtant Warwick</hi> broke away from the Revolters, and came to our Fleet, (and the eight of that current, we weighed with our Fleet from <hi>Goree,</hi> and went up to tide before <hi>Helvord</hi> Sluce among the Revolters, the wind then being at <hi>North Eaſt,</hi> but ſalling calme, all the Fleet could not get up that night, though part did. The ſame night the <hi>Hind</hi> Frigot broke from them alſo, at both theſe they ſhot guns, but did them no harme. The next day being <hi>Thurſday,</hi> we got up with the reſt of our Fleet, but the Enemy being amaz'd and ſtruck with feare, as it plainly appeared to us by their working, for that ſome let ſlip their Cables, others cut and left their Anchors behind them, which after were taken up by our Fleet, and after this valiant act of theirs, they run their ſhips aſhore at the head of the ſluce, where they lay two or three daies expoſed to all weathers. But for the ſhips called the <hi>Love</hi> and <hi>Satisfa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction,</hi> theſe after ſome ſhort diſpute were both delivered up, and not any man hurt in the action, though both of them man'd with Soldiers and Seamen. And that which is re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>markable in this, ſome of them ingeniouſly acknowledged that feare fell upon them.</p>
            <p>7ly. By our ſtaying there, the greateſt part of their men run from them, and got ſome of them over into <hi>England,</hi> o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers into <hi>Oftend,</hi> and many came away in our Fleet, ſo that when we left them, they were in no condition to ſet forth the foure Navy ſhips this winter, their Deſign being much broken, which was for <hi>Ireland,</hi> and for future we hope will be prevented if God permit. Now hath not God in all this, fruſtrated the expectations of many, as namely thoſe eſpecially, who boaſted high of their Intereſt in the Seamen, aſſuring themſelves and Prince with his Adherents, that if the Revolters did but appeare where the Lord Admi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ralls Fleet was, all or moſt of his ſhips would come and joyne with them. But expertence we hope by this time hath made
<pb n="8" facs="tcp:115274:6"/>that perſwaſion, of theirs, to appeare to be falſe, and to be on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly fictions, from the workings of their own carnal backſliding heart, and as experience may convince them ſo we heartily deſire it may all others who were and are honeſt yet through unbeliefe and diſtruſt diſpaired of ſucceſſe, not conſidering God hath the hearts of all men in his hands, and the Cauſe being his own, certainly the Lord was ingaged to fit Inſtru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments to doe his own worke, his Glory, and the deliverance of his poore People being concern'd therein. Had not the Almighty aſſured the hearts of many of us, who ingaged in this Buſineſſe, certainly we ſhould never have undertaken the ſame, but we were made confident of ſucceſſe, knowing we had Gods enemies to deale withall, being ſuch who had betrayed their Truſt, their own Conſciences, and as much as in them lay, the Cauſe of God, and their Countries Liber<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties, yea to ſuch to whom ſome of them became a ſcorne themſelves, being caſt off as men not fit to be truſted, ſuch was the Juſtice of God upon them for their perfidiouſneſſe, and in this the promiſe of God was made good, as the Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phet ſayes, <hi>the pit which they have digged for others, themſelves are fallen into.</hi> Therefore be convinced all you Enemies who are fighters againſt God and his people, for you may ſee if any thing of God be in you, that all your wicked and treacherous Deſignes, he himſelf hath broken from time to time, both by Sea and Land, and ſtill will doe attempt what you can, for thoſe hom you fight againſt have an Intereſt in God, and are a praying people, with weapon we meane the ſpirit of Prayer, whowever derided by ſuch deſperate wretches as you are, is that which will overthrow all your Deſignes, God having an Eare to the prayers of his people. Read the ſtorie of King <hi>Pharoah</hi> and his Hoſt, and obſerve the ſtory well, you ſhall ſee what became of them who fought againſt God and the Deliverance of his people, but we ſtill pray, and wiſh that the Lord would awaken all ſuch as are Enemies to his glory, that they may at length ſee if it bee his will. For it will not be ſufficient for you to ſay in the great day of the Lord Chriſt, that you ſought for a King or a Prince, but remember what the Lord ſaith by the Prophet
<pb n="9" facs="tcp:115274:6"/>in the Pſalmiſt, a place often cited by the Royalliſts of our times, though much abuſed and wreſted by them, for there is nothing in the Text for their purpoſe. The words are, <hi>[Tench not mine anointed, nor doe my Prophets no harme] For I will</hi> (ſaith the Lord) <hi>rebuke even Kings for their ſakes, who are my people.</hi> Would the Arme of fleſh have done your worke? certainly you have had enough of that from time to time, but alas it is vaine, truſt not in it, for you may ſee it hath failed you al along, eſpecially in this laſt great Deſign of yours, wher<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in you boaſted high, that all the Kingdomes were for you. We muſt acknowledge through the perfidiouſneſſe of baſe ſpirited men, who <hi>Judas</hi> like, betrayed their truſt, you had gotten a great part in the Kingdomes. But you have ſeen on may it God will pleaſe to let you, that its even all come to no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing, and ſhall in a ſhort time we are confident all falſe you, for that we know the God of heaven is ingaged againſt you, therefore you ſhall not proſper, plot what you can, for he who hath begun the glorious work of REFORMATION, is able and will perfect the ſame, to his own glory, and the Kingdomes good, in deſpight of all oppoſition of men and Devills. Now God is, and hath been our ſtrength, whom then ſhould we feare.</p>
            <p>8ly. Can any rationall man thinke or conceive, that it can any wayes be for the honour of our Nation, to have any part of the Navy, under the Command of a Foraign Prince, as he is who is their Admirall, '<hi>Pr. Rupers</hi> a wicked wretch, who hath bin an Inſtrument of much ruin &amp; ſpoil to our Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion in the late War, as by ſad experience many Families can ſpeak, it having been wholly ruinated and deſtroyed by him. Others put to death as hanged by his command, when no of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fence hath bin given by thoſe who have innocently ſuffered under him, and theſe horrid cruel wicked acts of his were done only to ſatisfie his diviliſh will, but we are aſſured the righte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous God will one day reckon with him, and all ſuch blood<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thirſty ones for all their wickednes, and though they have hi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>therto eſcaped the ſword of Juſtice which was due unto them,
<pb n="10" facs="tcp:115274:7"/>we are confident the Divine hand of God will one day over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>take and reach them.</p>
            <p>9ly, and laſtly. We have endeavoured in this, to give a brief and perfect Relation of thoſe many acts of Gods provi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence, which happened to us in our late proceedings againſt the Revolted Ships. And now we hartily wiſh, that as Almighty God hath owned us by Sea, and the Army by land, he would now put it into the hearts of the Parliament, to exe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cute Juſtice and Judgement upon the Kingdoms enemies, and were this once effectually done, we are confident it would de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terre men, from attempting to doe ſuch horrid villanous acts as theſe; in carrying away part of the Kingdoms ſtrength into the Ports of a forraigne Nation, to be diſpoſed of by a forraign Prince. But we may juſtly ſay, the want of executing with the ſword of juſtice hath occaſioned this and much more, to the expending of the Kingdoms Blood and Treaſure.</p>
            <p>We know theſe lines will diſtaſt ſome, who have cauſe e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nough to be aſhamed, in that they were very active, aſmuch as in them lay, to hinder the ſetting forth of that Fleet under his Lorſhip, which God hath owned and bleſſed hitherto in deſpight of all oppoſition of malignant and malicious Spirits, and hath made uſe of the Fleet as an inſtrumentall cauſe of good to theſe poore ſhaken Kingdoms. But if it be objected by any that the Revolters are not as yet all reduced, therefore you might have forborn to ſpeak any thing of the action till the whole work had bin accompliſht. To this, we ſhall give this anſwer, That if Men will eye Providence in their actings, then certainly we have done aſmuch as was allotted by the Almighty at this time; For, we muſt conſider Gods Enemies are bounded, having their ſtation ſet, and further they can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not nor ſhall not goe, if ſo this may quit all, and teach us pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiently to wait Gods own time, for the bringing downe his and our enemies; had we been free to have acted in that place where we were, by Gods bleſſing the whole worke of Redu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction would have been perfected. For certainly never did
<pb n="11" facs="tcp:115274:7"/>more reſolution appeare among men, then God gave in gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rall to our whole Fleet, who were athirſt to ſee them out of the Port, where they might be free to fall upon them. But we may juſtly feare the Lord hath reſerved the remaining part of theſe Revolters, to be a further ſcourge to this Nation, yet we verily believe the time of their Reigne will not be long; For, wee doubt not but God almighty will ſtill have inſtruments to ſtand faſt and cloſe to his cauſe in all times of ſtreights and difficulties whatever; <hi>For, the back ſlider in heart ſhall be filled with his own wayes,</hi> for times of difficulty is Gods only oportu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity to ſhew himſelf that it may appeare to be himſelf, who worketh all our workes in us, and for us, and this is that which will teach us to give all the honour prayſe and glory to him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelfe, who is the Author and Fountaine of all good, being due to no other in the world, which we hartily deſire to do in this.</p>
            <p>Now to conclude, we cannot omit to ſpeake ſomthing of that gallantry, faithfulnes, and reſolution, which God was pleaſed to give to our Generall, the Lord Admirall, yea ſo much that his Lordſhip was willing to part with all relati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons to doe his Country Service, Therefore we are, and ſhall be ready at al times (if God permit) to witnes, that al thoſe many falſe &amp; ſcandalous reports of joyning with the Princes Fleet, as namely, that falſe and ſcandalous Pamphlet entituled; <hi>The Lord Admirall and his Officers Declaration,</hi> to be utterly falſe, being a piece of ſome Ieſuiticall ſpirit or other, and we are ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry confident his Lordſhip hath bin as faithfull in this under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taking of his, as any whoever ſerved the Parliament and Kingdomes, If ſo, certainly all honeſt men have cauſe to bleſſe God for him, who hath bin a inſtrument of ſo much good in regaining of loſt Affections, and who ſo freely and cheerfully hath offered to ſacrifice his life in the cauſe of God for his Countries liberties, and as the Lord was pleaſed to fill the heart of our ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nerall the Lord Admirall with reſolution, integrity
<pb n="12" facs="tcp:115274:8"/>and faithfullnes notwithſtanding all thoſe Calumnies caſt upon him, by his and our enemies, ſo we cannot but acknowledge that the Lord was as gracious to all under his Lordſhips co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>mand, in making them faithful in their ſeverall places to the executing their reſpective duties, as they were commanded by his Honour, that we may truly and juſtly ſay his Lordſhip, and all thoſe under him were cordially united as one man to live and dye together.</p>
            <p>Now to ſhut up all, as we have had many pledges of the Almighties love and favour unto us, and not on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly to us, but to the Army in their undertakings, againſt the Kingdomes Enemies; So our prayers ſhall bee, that God who is wiſedom it ſelf, would fill the hearts of Parliament, Army, and Navy, whereby they and we may ſtill be acted, united, and carried out with reſolu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion and interity for the good of the publique, and to this Wee doe heartily ſubſcribe.</p>
