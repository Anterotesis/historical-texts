            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

                     <hi>Then ſhall the Kingdom of Heaven be likened unto ten Virgins</hi>; By the <hi>King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom of Heaven</hi> is meant the ſtate and condition of things under the <hi>Goſpel</hi>; By the <hi>ten Virgins,</hi> thoſe who embraced the Profeſſion of it, which is here repre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſented by their <hi>taking their Lamps and go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
<pb n="4" facs="tcp:33693:7"/>
forth to meet the Bridegroom</hi>: in allu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion to the ancient Cuſtom of <hi>Marria<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ges,</hi> in which the <hi>Bridegroom</hi> was wont to lead home his <hi>Bride</hi> in the Night by the light of <hi>Lamps</hi> or <hi>Torches.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>But this Profeſſion was not in all equal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly firm and fruitful; and therefore thoſe who perſever'd and continued ſtedfaſt in this Profeſſion, notwithſtanding all the temptations and allurements of the World, and all the fierce ſtorms and aſſaults of perſecution to which this Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſſion was expoſed; and being thus firm<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly rooted in it, did bring forth the fruits of the Spirit and abound in the Graces and Virtues of a good life, Theſe are the <hi>wiſe Virgins</hi>: But thoſe who either deſerted this Profeſſion, or did not bring forth fruits anſwerable to it, are the <hi>fooliſh Virgins.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>And that this is the true difference be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween them will appear, if we conſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der how the <hi>Parable</hi> repreſents them, <hi>verſ.</hi> 3, 4. <hi>They that were fooliſh took their Lamps, and took no Oyl with them: But the wiſe took Oyl in their Veſſels with their Lamps.</hi> So that they both took their <hi>Lamps,</hi> and both lighted them, and therefore muſt both be ſuppos'd to have ſome <hi>oyl</hi> in their <hi>Lamps</hi> at firſt, as ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pears from <hi>verſe</hi> 8. where <hi>the fooliſh
<pb n="5" facs="tcp:33693:7"/>
Virgins ſaid unto the wiſe, give us of your oyl, for our Lamps are gone out.</hi> They had it ſeems ſome Oyl in their Lamps at firſt, which kept them lighted for a little while, but had taken no care for a future ſupply. And therefore the dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ference between the <hi>wiſe</hi> and <hi>fooliſh</hi> Vir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gins did not, as ſome have imagin'd, conſiſt in this, that the <hi>wiſe</hi> Virgins had Oyl, but the <hi>fooliſh</hi> had none; but in this, that the <hi>fooliſh</hi> had taken no care for a further ſupply, after the Oyl which was at firſt put into their Lamps was ſpent; as the <hi>wiſe</hi> had done, who be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſides the Oyl that was in their Lamps carried likewiſe a <hi>Reſerve</hi> in ſome other <hi>Veſſel,</hi> for a continual ſupply of the <hi>Lamp,</hi> as there ſhould be occaſion; <hi>the wiſe took Oyl in their Veſſels with their Lamps.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Now the meaning of all this is, That they who are repreſented by the <hi>wiſe Vir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gins</hi> had not only embraced the Profeſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of the <hi>Chriſtian</hi> Religion, as the <hi>fool<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iſh Virgins</hi> alſo had done, for they both had their Lamps lighted; but they like<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe perſever'd in that Profeſſion, and brought forth fruits anſwerable to it. For by <hi>Oyl</hi> in their <hi>Lamps</hi> and the firſt lighting of them, which was common to them both, is meant that ſolemn Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſſion
<pb n="6" facs="tcp:33693:8"/>
of <hi>Faith</hi> and <hi>Repentance</hi> which all <hi>Chriſtians</hi> make in <hi>Baptiſm</hi>: By that far<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther <hi>ſupply of Oyl,</hi> which the <hi>wiſe Vir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gins</hi> only took care to provide, is ſigni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fied our conſtancy and perſeverance in this Profeſſion, together with the fruits of the Spirit, and the improvement of the <hi>Grace</hi> received in <hi>Baptiſm</hi> by the pra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctice and exerciſe of all the <hi>Graces</hi> and <hi>Virtues</hi> of a good life whereby men are fitted and prepar'd for <hi>Death</hi> and <hi>Judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment,</hi> which are here repreſented to us by the <hi>coming of the Bridegroom.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>This being plainly the main ſcope and intention of the <hi>Parable,</hi> I ſhall explain the reſt of it, as there ſhall be occaſion, under the ſeveral <hi>Obſervations</hi> which I ſhall raiſe from the ſeveral parts of it. And they ſhall be theſe.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Firſt,</hi> I obſerve the charitable <hi>Deco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rum</hi> which our <hi>B. Saviour</hi> keeps in this as well as in the reſt of his <hi>Parables</hi>; as if He would fain ſuppoſe and hope, that among thoſe who enjoy the <hi>Goſpel</hi> and make profeſſion of it, the number of them that are truly good is equal to thoſe that are bad. For our <hi>B. Saviour</hi> here repreſents the whole number of the <hi>Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſſors</hi> of <hi>Chriſtianity</hi> by <hi>ten Virgins,</hi> the half whereof the <hi>Parable</hi> ſeems to ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe
<pb n="7" facs="tcp:33693:8"/>
to be truly and really good, and to perſevere in goodneſs to the end, <hi>verſ.</hi> 1, 2. <hi>Then ſhall the Kingdom of Heaven be likened unto ten Virgins, which took their Lamps and went forth to meet the Bride<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>groom: And five of them were wiſe, and five were fooliſh.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Secondly,</hi> I obſerve how very common it is for men to neglect this great con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cernment of their Souls, <hi>viz.</hi> a due pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>paration for another World; and how willing men are to deceive themſelves herein, and to depend upon any thing elſe, how groundleſs and unreaſonable ſoever, rather than to take pains to be really good and fit for Heaven. And this is in a very lively manner repreſented to us in the deſcription of the <hi>fooliſh Virgins,</hi> who had provided no <hi>ſupply</hi> of <hi>Oyl</hi> in their <hi>Veſſels,</hi> and when the <hi>Bride<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>groom</hi> was coming would have furniſh'd themſelves by <hi>borrowing</hi> or <hi>buying</hi> of o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers, <hi>verſ.</hi> 8.9, 10.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Thirdly,</hi> I obſerve, That even the bet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter ſort of Chriſtians are not careful and watchful as they ought to prepare them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves for Death and Judgment: <hi>Whilſt the Bridegroom tarried, they all ſlumbered and ſlept</hi>; even the <hi>wiſe</hi> Virgins as well as the fooliſh.</p>
                  <p>
                     <pb n="8" facs="tcp:33693:9"/>
                     <hi>Fourthly,</hi> I obſerve further, how little is to be done by us, to any good pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe, in this great work of <hi>Preparation,</hi> when it is deferr'd and put off to the laſt. Thus the <hi>fooliſh Virgins</hi> did, and what a ſad confuſion and hurry they were in we may ſee <hi>verſ.</hi> 6, 7, 8, 9. <hi>And at midnight there was a cry made, Behold! the Bride<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>groom cometh; go ye out to meet Him. At midnight</hi>; the moſt diſmal and unſea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſonable time of all other: <hi>Then all thoſe Virgins aroſe, and trimmed their Lamps: and the fooliſh ſaid unto the wiſe, give us of your Oyl for our Lamps are gone out: But the wiſe anſwered, not ſo; leſt there be not enough for us and you; but go ye rather to them that ſell, and buy for your ſelves.</hi> And how ineffectual all that they could do at that time prov'd to be, we find, <hi>verſe</hi> 10, 11, 12; <hi>And whilſt they went to buy the Bridegroom came, and they that were ready went in with him to the marriage, and the door was ſhut. Afterwards came alſo the other Virgins, ſaying, Lord, Lord, open to us: But he anſwered and ſaid, ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rily I ſay unto you, I know you not.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Fifthly,</hi> I obſerve that there is no ſuch thing as <hi>Works</hi> of <hi>Super-erogation</hi>; That no man can do more than needs, and is his duty to do, by way of preparati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
<pb n="9" facs="tcp:33693:9"/>
for another World. For when the <hi>fooliſh Virgins</hi> would have begg'd of the <hi>wiſe</hi> ſome <hi>Oyl for their Lamps, the wiſe anſwered, not ſo; leſt there be not enough for us and you.</hi> It was only the <hi>fooliſh Virgins</hi> that had entertain'd this fooliſh conceit, that there might be an <hi>over-plus</hi> of <hi>Grace</hi> and <hi>Merit</hi> in others ſufficient to ſupply their want: But the <hi>wiſe</hi> knew not of any that they had to ſpare, but ſuppos'd all that they had little enough to qualify them for the reward of eter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal life; <hi>Not ſo,</hi> ſay they, <gap reason="foreign">
                        <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                     </gap>, <hi>leſt at any time,</hi> leſt when there ſhould be need and occaſion, all that we have done, or could do, ſhould prove little enough for our ſelves.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Sixthly</hi> and <hi>laſtly,</hi> I obſerve, That if we could ſuppoſe any perſons to be ſo over-good, as to have more grace and goodneſs than needs to qualify them for the reward of eternal life, yet there is no <hi>aſſigning</hi> and <hi>transferring</hi> of this <hi>over-plus</hi> of <hi>Grace</hi> and <hi>Virtue</hi> from one man to another. For we ſee, <hi>verſe</hi> 9, 10. that all the ways which they could think of, of <hi>borrowing,</hi> or <hi>buying Oyl</hi> of others, did all prove ineffectual; becauſe the thing is in its own nature impracticable,
<pb n="10" facs="tcp:33693:10"/>
that one Sinner ſhould be in a condition to merit for another.</p>
                  <p>All theſe <hi>Obſervations</hi> ſeem to have ſome fair and probable foundation in ſome part or other of this <hi>Parable</hi>; and moſt of them, I am ſure, are agreeable to the main ſcope and intention of the whole. I ſhall ſpeak to them ſeverally, and as briefly as I can.</p>
                  <p>
                     <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="I"/>
                     <hi>Firſt,</hi> I obſerve the charitable <hi>Deco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rum</hi> which our <hi>B. Saviour</hi> keeps in this, as well as in the reſt of his <hi>Parables</hi>; as if he would fain ſuppoſe and hope, that among thoſe who enjoy the <hi>Goſpel</hi> and make <hi>Profeſſion</hi> of it, the number of thoſe who make a firm and ſincere Profeſſion of it, and perſevere in goodneſs to the end, is equal to the number of thoſe who do not make good their Profeſſion, or who fall off from it.</p>
                  <p>I ſhall not be long upon this, becauſe I lay the leaſt ſtreſs upon it, of all the reſt. I ſhall only take notice, that our <hi>B. Saviour</hi> in this <hi>Parable</hi> repreſents the whole number of the <hi>Profeſſors</hi> of <hi>Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtianity</hi> by <hi>ten Virgins,</hi> the half of which the <hi>Parable</hi> ſeems to ſuppoſe to have ſin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerely embraced the <hi>Chriſtian Profeſſion,</hi>
                     <pb n="11" facs="tcp:33693:10"/>
and to have perſever'd therein to the laſt; <hi>The Kingdom of heaven ſhall be likened un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to ten Virgin, which took their Lamps and went forth to meet the Bridegroom: And five of them were wiſe, and five were foo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liſh.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>And this <hi>Decorum</hi> our <hi>B. Saviour</hi> ſeems carefully to obſerve in his other <hi>Parables:</hi> As in the <hi>Parable</hi> of the <hi>Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>digal, Luke</hi> 15. where for <hi>one</hi> Son that left his Father, and took riotous courſes, there was <hi>another</hi> that ſtayed always with him and continued conſtant to his duty. And in the <hi>Parable</hi> of the <hi>ten Talents,</hi> which immediately follows that of the <hi>ten Virgins, two</hi> are ſuppoſed to improve the Talents committed to them, for <hi>one</hi> that made no improvement of his. He that had <hi>five Talents</hi> committed to him made them <hi>five more,</hi> and he that had <hi>two</hi> gained <hi>other two</hi>; and only he that had but <hi>one Talent, hid it in the earth,</hi> and made no improvement of it. And in the <hi>Parable</hi> which I am now upon, the number of the <hi>Profeſſors</hi> of <hi>Chriſtia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity,</hi> who took care to fit and prepare themſelves for the <hi>coming of the Bride<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>groom,</hi> is ſuppoſed equal to the number of thoſe who did not.</p>
                  <p>
                     <pb n="12" facs="tcp:33693:11"/>And whether this be particularly in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tended in the <hi>Parable</hi> or not, it may however be thus far inſtructive to us; That we ſhould be ſo far from leſſening the number of <hi>true Chriſtians,</hi> and from confining the <hi>Church</hi> of <hi>Chriſt</hi> within a narrow compaſs, ſo as to exclude out of its <hi>Communion</hi> the far greateſt part of the <hi>Profeſſors</hi> of <hi>Chriſtianity</hi>; that on the contrary, we ſhould enlarge the <hi>King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom</hi> of <hi>Chriſt</hi> as much as we can, and extend our charity to all <hi>Churches</hi> and <hi>Chriſtians,</hi> of what <hi>Denomination</hi> ſoever, as far as regard to Truth and to the foun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dations of the <hi>Chriſtian</hi> Religion will permit us to believe and hope well of them; and rather be contented to err a little on the favourable and charitable part than to be miſtaken on the cenſorious and damning ſide.</p>
                  <p>And for this reaſon perhaps it is, that our <hi>B. Saviour</hi> thought fit to frame his <hi>Parables</hi> with ſo remarkable a <hi>Byaſs</hi> to the charitable ſide: Partly to inſtruct us, to extend our charity towards all <hi>Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtian</hi> Churches, and <hi>Profeſſors</hi> of the <hi>Chriſtian</hi> Religion, and our good hopes concerning them, as far as with reaſon we can: And partly to reprove the un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>charitableneſs of the <hi>Jews,</hi> who poſitive<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
<pb n="13" facs="tcp:33693:11"/>
excluded all the reſt of Mankind, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſides themſelves, from all hopes of Salva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion. An odious temper, which to the infinite Scandal of the <hi>Chriſtian</hi> Name and Profeſſion, hath prevail'd upon ſome <hi>Chriſtians</hi> to that notorious degree, as not only to ſhut out all the <hi>Reform'd</hi> Part of the <hi>Weſtern</hi> Church, almoſt equal in num<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber to themſelves, from all hopes of Sal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vation under the notion of <hi>Hereticks</hi>; but likewiſe to un-church all the other Churches of the <hi>Chriſtian</hi> World, which are of much greater extent and number than themſelves, that do not own ſubje<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction to the <hi>Biſhop</hi> of <hi>Rome:</hi> And this they do, by declaring it to be <hi>of neceſſity to Salvation for every Creature to be ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject to the Roman Biſhop.</hi> And this <hi>Su<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>premacy</hi> of the <hi>Biſhop</hi> of <hi>Rome</hi> over all <hi>Chriſtian</hi> Churches <hi>Bellarmin</hi> calls <hi>the Sum of the Chriſtian Religion.</hi> So that the <hi>Roman</hi> Communion is plainly founded in <hi>Schiſm,</hi> that is, in the moſt unchriſtian and uncharitable <hi>Princi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple</hi> that can be, namely, <hi>that they are the only true Church of Chriſt, out of which none can be ſaved:</hi> which was the very <hi>Schiſm</hi> of the <hi>Donatiſts.</hi> And in this they are ſo poſitive, that the Learned men of that Church, in their Diſputes and Wri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tings,
<pb n="14" facs="tcp:33693:12"/>
are much more inclinable to be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve the Salvation of <hi>Heathens</hi> to be poſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſible, than of any of thoſe <hi>Chriſtians</hi> whom they are pleas'd to call <hi>Hereticks.</hi> The <hi>Faith</hi> of the Church of <hi>Rome</hi> is cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainly none of the beſt; but of one of the greateſt and moſt eſſential Vertues of the <hi>Chriſtian Religion,</hi> I mean <hi>Charity,</hi> I doubt they have the leaſt ſhare of any <hi>Chriſtian</hi> Church this day in the World.</p>
                  <p>
                     <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="II"/>
                     <hi>Secondly,</hi> I obſerve, not from any par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticular <hi>circumſtance,</hi> but from the main <hi>Scope</hi> and deſign of this <hi>Parable,</hi> How very apt a great part of <hi>Chriſtians</hi> are to neglect this great concernment of their Souls, <hi>viz,</hi> a careful and due preparation for another World; and how willing they are to deceive themſelves in this matter, and to depend upon any thing elſe, how groundleſs and unreaſonable ſoever, rather than to take the pains to be really good and fit for Heaven. And this is in a very lively manner repreſented to us in the deſcription of the <hi>fooliſh Vir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gins,</hi> who had provided no <hi>ſupply</hi> of <hi>Oyl</hi> in their <hi>Veſſels,</hi> and when the <hi>Bridegroom</hi> was <hi>coming</hi> would have furniſh'd them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves by <hi>borrowing</hi> or <hi>buying</hi> of others, <hi>verſ.</hi> 8, 9, 10. They contented them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves
<pb n="15" facs="tcp:33693:12"/>
with having their <hi>Lamps</hi> lighted at their firſt ſetting out to meet the <hi>Bride<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>groom,</hi> that is, with their being admitted into the <hi>Profeſſion</hi> of <hi>Chriſtianity</hi> by <hi>Bap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiſm,</hi> but either were not ſtedfaſt in this <hi>Profeſſion,</hi> or were not careful to adorn it with the <hi>Graces</hi> and <hi>Vertues</hi> of a good life.</p>
                  <p>And the true Reaſon why men are ſo very apt to deceive themſelves in this matter, and are ſo hardly brought to thoſe things wherein Religion mainly conſiſts, I mean the fruits of the Spirit and the practice of real Goodneſs; I ſay, the true reaſon of this is, becauſe they are extremely deſirous to reconcile, if it were poſſible, the hopes of eternal happi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs in another World with a liberty to live as they liſt in this preſent World: They are loth to be at the trouble and drudgery of mortifying their luſts, and governing their paſſions, and bridling their tongues, and practiſing all thoſe duties which are comprehended in thoſe <hi>two great Commandments</hi> of the <hi>Love of God</hi> and of our <hi>Neighbour</hi>: They would fain gain the favour of God, and make their calling and election ſure, by ſome eaſier way than by <hi>giving all diligence</hi> to add to their <hi>Faith</hi> and <hi>Knowledge</hi> the <hi>Graces</hi> and <hi>Vertues</hi> of a good life.</p>
                  <p>
                     <pb n="16" facs="tcp:33693:13"/>For the plain truth of the matter is, men had rather that Religion ſhould be any thing than what indeed it is, <hi>viz,</hi> the thwarting and croſſing of their vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cious inclinations, the curing of their evil and corrupt affections, the due care and government of their unruly appe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tites and paſſions, the ſincere endeavour and the conſtant practice of all holineſs and virtue in their lives: And therefore they had much rather have ſomething that might handſomely palliate and ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cuſe their evil inclinations and practices, than to be obliged to retrench and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nounce them; and rather than amend and reform their wicked lives, they would be contented to make an <hi>honoura<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble amends</hi> and compenſation to Almighty God in ſome other way.</p>
                  <p>This hath been the way and folly of Mankind in all ages, to defeat the great end and deſign of Religion, and to thruſt it by, by ſubſtituting ſomething elſe in the place of it which, as they think, may ſerve the turn as well, having the ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pearance of as much devotion and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpect towards God, and really coſting them more money and pains, than that which God requires of them. Men have ever been apt thus to impoſe upon
<pb n="17" facs="tcp:33693:13"/>
themſelves, and to pleaſe themſelves with a conceit of pleaſing God full as well, or better, by ſome other way than that which he hath preſcribed and ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pointed for them.</p>
                  <p>By this means, and upon this <hi>falſe Principle,</hi> Religion hath ever been apt to degenerate both among <hi>Jews</hi> and <hi>Chriſtians,</hi> into external and little obſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vances, and into a great zeal for leſſer things with a total neglect of the great<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er and weightier matters of Religion; and, in a word, into infinite <hi>Superſtiti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons</hi> of one kind or other, and an arro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gant conceit of the extraordinary righte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ouſneſs and merit of theſe things: In which ſome have proceeded to that height, as if they could drive a ſtrict bargain with God for eternal life and happineſs; and have treated Him in ſo inſolent a manner, by their Doctrine of the <hi>Merit</hi> of their <hi>Devotions</hi> and <hi>good Works,</hi> as if God were as much be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>holden to them for their ſervice and obe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dience, as they are to Him for the reward of them; which they are not afraid to ſay they may challenge at God's hands as of right and juſtice belonging to them.</p>
                  <p>Nay, ſo far have they carried this <hi>Doctrine</hi> in the Church of <hi>Rome,</hi> as not

only to pretend to merit eternal life for themſelves, but likewiſe to do a great deal more for the benefit and advantage of others who have not righteouſneſs and goodneſs enough of their own: Which was the ſilly conceit of the <hi>fooliſh Virgins</hi> here in the <hi>Parable,</hi> as I ſhall have occaſion to ſhew more fully by and by.</p>
                  <p>And it is no great wonder that ſuch eaſy ways of Religion and pleaſing God are very grateful to the corrupt nature of Man, and that men who are reſolv'd to continue in an evil courſe are glad to be of a Church which will aſſure Salvation to men upon ſuch terms: The great dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficulty is, for men to believe that things which are ſo apparently abſurd and un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reaſonable can be true; and to perſuade themſelves that they can impoſe upon God by ſuch pretences of ſervice and obedience, as no wiſe <hi>Prince</hi> or <hi>Father</hi> upon earth is to be deluded withal by his <hi>Subjects</hi> or <hi>Children.</hi> We ought to have worthier thoughts of God, and to conſider that He is a <hi>great King,</hi> and will be obey'd and obſerv'd by his crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures <hi>in his own way</hi> and make them happy upon his own terms: and that obedience to what he commands is better and more acceptable to him than any other ſacri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fice

that we can offer, which he hath not required at our hands: and likewiſe, that he is infinitely wiſe and good; and therefore that the <hi>Laws,</hi> which he hath given us to live by, are much more likely and certain means of our happineſs, than any <hi>inventions</hi> and <hi>devices</hi> of our own.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Thirdly,</hi> I obſerve that even the better <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="III"/> and more conſiderate ſort of <hi>Chriſtians</hi> are not ſo careful and watchful as they ought to prepare themſelves for <hi>Death</hi> and <hi>Judgment; whilſt the Bridegroom tar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ried, they all ſlumbered and ſlept.</hi> Even the <hi>Diſciples</hi> of our <hi>Saviour,</hi> whilſt he was yet perſonally preſent with them, and after a particular charge given them from his own mouth, <hi>Watch and pray leſt ye enter into temptation</hi>; yet did not keep that guard upon themſelves as to <hi>watch with him for one hour. In many things,</hi> ſays <hi>St. James, we offend all</hi>; even the beſt of us: And who is there that doth not, ſome time or other, remit of his vigilancy and care, ſo as to give the De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vil an advantage and to lye open to temptation, for want of a continual guard upon himſelf? But then the difference between the <hi>wiſe</hi> and <hi>fool<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iſh Virgins</hi> was this, that tho they both
<pb n="20" facs="tcp:33693:15"/>
                     <hi>ſlept,</hi> yet the <hi>wiſe</hi> did not let their <hi>Lamps</hi> go out; they neither quitted their <hi>Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſſion,</hi> nor did they extinguiſh it by a bad life: and tho when the <hi>Bridegroom</hi> came ſuddenly upon them, they were not ſo actually prepar'd to meet him by a con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinual vigilancy, yet they were habitual<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly prepar'd by the good diſpoſition of their minds and the general courſe of a holy life: Their <hi>Lamps</hi> might <hi>burn dim</hi> for want of continual trimming, but they had <hi>Oyl</hi> in their <hi>Veſſels</hi> to <hi>ſupply</hi> their <hi>Lamps,</hi> which the <hi>fooliſh Virgins</hi> had taken no care to provide. But ſurely the greateſt wiſdom of all is to maintain a continual watchfulneſs, that ſo we may not be ſurpriz'd by the <hi>coming of the Bridegroom,</hi> and be in a confuſion when <hi>Death</hi> or <hi>Judgment</hi> ſhall overtake us. And <hi>bleſſed are thoſe Servants,</hi> and <hi>wiſe</hi> indeed, whoſe <hi>Lamps</hi> always <hi>burn bright,</hi> and whom the <hi>Bridegroom</hi> when <hi>he comes ſhall find watching</hi> and in a fit poſture and preparation to meet Him.</p>

<pb n="21" facs="tcp:33693:15"/>
but what a ſad confuſion and hurry they were in at the ſudden coming of the <hi>Bridegroom,</hi> when they were not only <hi>aſleep,</hi> but when after they were awaken'd they found themſelves altogether unpro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vided of that which was neceſſary to trim their <hi>Lamps</hi> and to put them in a poſture to meet the <hi>Bridegroom:</hi> When they wanted that which was neceſſary at that very inſtant, but could not be pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vided in an inſtant: I ſay, what a tu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mult and confuſion they were in, being thus ſurpriz'd, the <hi>Parable</hi> repreſents to us at large, <hi>verſ.</hi> 6, 7, 8, 9. <hi>and at mid<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>night there was a cry made, Behold! the Bridegroom</hi> cometh, <hi>go ye out to meet him.

                  <p>
                     <hi>At midnight there was a cry made,</hi> that is, at the moſt diſmal and unſeaſonable time of all other; when they were faſt aſleep, and ſuddenly awaken'd in great terror, when they could not on the ſud<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>den recollect themſelves, and conſider what to do; when the ſummons was ſo very ſhort, that they had neither time to conſider what was fit to be done, nor time to do it in.</p>
                  <p>
                     <pb n="22" facs="tcp:33693:16"/>And ſuch is the Caſe of thoſe who put off their <hi>Repentance</hi> and <hi>Preparation</hi> for another World, till they are ſurpriz'd by <hi>Death</hi> or <hi>Judgment</hi>; for it comes all to one in the iſſue, which of them it be. The <hi>Parable</hi> indeed ſeems more particu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>larly to point at our <hi>Lord's coming to Judgment,</hi> but the caſe is much the ſame as to thoſe who are ſurpriz'd by <hi>ſudden Death</hi>; ſuch as gives them but little, or not ſufficient time for ſo great a work: becauſe ſuch as <hi>Death</hi> leaves them, <hi>Judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment</hi> will certainly find them.</p>
                  <p>And what a miſerable confuſion muſt they needs be in, who are thus ſurpriz'd either by the one or the other?

Or if they could have any, what time will there then be to put them in execution? when they ſhall ſee the <hi>An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gel, that ſtandeth upon the Sea and upon the Earth, lifting up his hand to Heaven and ſwearing by Him that liveth for ever and ever that Time ſhall be no longer</hi>; as this dreadful Day is deſcribed <hi>Rev.</hi> 10.5, 6. and <hi>chap.</hi> 6.15. where Sinners are repreſented at the <hi>Appearance</hi> of this <hi>Great Judge,</hi> not as flying to God in hopes of mercy, but as flying from Him in utter deſpair of finding mercy with Him: <hi>The Kings of the Earth, and the Great Men, and the Mighty Men, and the Rich Men, and the Great Captains hid themſelves in the Dens and in the Rocks of the Earth; and ſaid to the Mountains and Rocks fall on us and hide us from the face of Him that ſitteth on the Throne, and from the wrath of the Lamb: For the Great Day of his wrath is come, and who ſhall be

able to ſtand?</hi> The biggeſt and the bold<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eſt Sinners that ever were upon Earth, ſhall then flee from the face of Him whom they have ſo often blaſphemed and denied; and ſhall ſo far deſpair of finding mercy with Him in that Day, who would ſue to Him for it no ſooner, that they ſhall addreſs themſelves to the <hi>Mountains</hi> and <hi>Rocks,</hi> as being more pi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiful and exorable than <hi>He; to hide them from the face of Him that ſitteth on the Throne, and from the wrath of the Lamb: From the wrath of the Lamb,</hi> to ſignify to us that nothing is more terrible than <hi>Meekneſs</hi> and <hi>Patience</hi> when they are throughly provok'd and turn'd into <hi>Fury.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>In ſuch dreadful confuſion ſhall all impenitent Sinners be, when they ſhall be ſurpriz'd by that <hi>Great and terrible Day of the Lord:</hi> And the <hi>Caſe</hi> of a <hi>dy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing Sinner,</hi> who would take no care in the time of his Life and Health to make preparation for another World, is not much more hopeful and comfortable.</p>
                  <p>For alas! how little is it that a ſick and dying man can do in ſuch a ſtrait of time? in the midſt of ſo much pain and weakneſs of Body, and of ſuch confuſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on and amazement of Mind. With what
<pb n="25" facs="tcp:33693:17"/>
heart can he ſet about ſo great a Work, for which there is ſo little time? With what face can he apply himſelf to God in this extremity, whom he hath ſo diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dainfully neglected all the days of his Life? And how can he have the confi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence to hope, that God will hear his cries and regard his tears that are forc'd from him in this day of his neceſſity? when he is conſcious to himſelf that in that <hi>long day</hi> of God's <hi>Grace</hi> and <hi>Pati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence</hi> he turned a deaf ear to all his merci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful invitations, and <hi>rejected the counſel of God againſt himſelf.</hi> In a word, how can he who <hi>would not know, in that his Day, the things which belonged to his peace,</hi> expect any other but that they ſhould now be for ever <hi>hid from his eyes,</hi> which are ready to be clos'd in utter dark<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs?</p>
                  <p>I will not pronounce any thing con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerning the impoſſibility of a <hi>death-bed Repentance:</hi> But I am ſure that it is ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry difficult, and I believe very rare. We have but one <hi>Example,</hi> that I know of, in the whole <hi>Bible</hi> of the Repentance of a dying Sinner; I mean that of the <hi>pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nitent Thief</hi> upon the <hi>Croſs:</hi> And the circumſtances of his Caſe are ſo peculiar and extraordinary, that I cannot ſee that
<pb n="26" facs="tcp:33693:18"/>
it affords any ground of hope and encou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ragement to men in ordinary Caſes. We are not like to ſuffer in the company of the <hi>Son of God</hi> and of the <hi>Saviour of the World</hi>; and if we could do ſo, it is not certain that we ſhould behave our ſelves towards Him ſo well as the <hi>penitent Thief</hi> did, and make ſo very good an end of ſo very bad a Life.</p>
                  <p>And the <hi>Parable</hi> in the <hi>Text</hi> is ſo far from giving any encouragement to a <hi>Death bed Repentance</hi> and <hi>Preparation,</hi> that it rather repreſents their Caſe as deſperate who put off their <hi>Preparation</hi> to that Time.

any Perſons to be ſo overgrown with Goodneſs, as to have more than needs to qualify them for the Reward of eternal Life; yet there can be no <hi>aſſigning</hi> and <hi>transferring</hi> of this <hi>over-plus</hi> of <hi>Grace</hi> and <hi>Virtue</hi> from one man to another.

the general courſe of a holy and virtu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous Life, the <hi>Merit</hi> of <hi>Chriſt's perfect Obedience</hi> and <hi>Sufferings</hi> will be availa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble with God for the acceptance of our <hi>ſincere</hi> though but <hi>imperfect Obedience.</hi> But if we take no care to be <hi>righte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous</hi> and good our ſelves, the <hi>perfect righ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teouſneſs</hi> of <hi>Chriſt</hi> will do us no good; much leſs the <hi>imperfect righteouſneſs</hi> of any other man who is a Sinner him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf.

                     <hi>for ye know neither the day nor the hour wherein the Son of man cometh</hi>; as if he had ſaid, the deſign of this <hi>Parable</hi> is to inſtruct us that we ought to be continually vigilant, and always upon our guard and in a con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtant readineſs and preparation <hi>to meet the Bridegroom</hi>; becauſe we know not the time of his coming to <hi>Judgment,</hi> nor yet, which will be of the ſame conſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quence and concernment to us, do any of us know the preciſe time of our own <hi>Death.</hi> Either of theſe may happen at any time, and come when we leaſt expect them.

                  </epigraph>
                  <p>I Am ſufficiently aware that the parti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cular occaſion of theſe <hi>Words</hi> is, in ſeveral reſpects very different from the Occaſion of this Day's Solemnity. For
<pb n="44" facs="tcp:33693:27"/>
theſe Words were ſpoken by <hi>Ezra</hi> at a time appointed for Publick and Solemn Humiliation. But I ſhall not now con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſider them in that relation, but rather as they refer to that Great <hi>Deliverance</hi> which God had ſo lately wrought for them; and as they are a Caution to take heed of abuſing great mercies received from God; and ſo they are very proper and pertinent to the great Occaſion of this Day. Nay theſe Words, even in their ſaddeſt aſpect, are not ſo unſuitable to it. For we find in <hi>Scripture</hi> upon the moſt ſolemn Occaſions of Humiliation, that good Men have always teſtified a thankful ſenſe of the goodneſs of God to them. And indeed, the Mercy of God doth then appear above meaſure merci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful, when the Sinner is moſt deeply ſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſible of his own Vileneſs and Unworthi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs. And ſo <hi>Ezra</hi> here, in the depth of their ſorrow and Humiliation, hath ſo great a ſenſe of the greatneſs of their Deliverance, that he hardly knew how to expreſs it; <hi>And haſt given us ſuch a De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liverance as this.</hi> And on the other hand, we find that good Men, in their moſt ſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lem Praiſes and Thankſgivings, have made very ſerious reflections upon their own unworthineſs. And ſurely the beſt
<pb n="45" facs="tcp:33693:27"/>
way to make Men truly thankful is firſt to make them very humble. When <hi>Da<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vid</hi> makes his moſt ſolemn acknowledg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments to God for his great Mercies to him; how doth he abaſe himſelf before Him; <hi>But who am I, and what is my peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple?</hi> And ſo likewiſe,<note place="margin">1 Chron. 29.4.</note> after he had ſum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moned all the powers and faculties of his Soul to join in the praiſes of God, he in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terpoſeth this ſeaſonable meditation,<note place="margin">Pſal. 103.10.</note> 
                     <hi>He hath not dealt with us after our ſins, nor re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>warded us according to our iniquities.</hi> The greater and more lively ſenſe we have of the goodneſs of God to us, the more we ſhall abhor our ſelves in duſt and aſhes; nothing being more apt to melt us into tears of Repentance, than the conſide<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration of great and undeſerved Mercies vouchſafed to us. <hi>The goodneſs of God</hi> doth naturally <hi>lead to repentance.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Having thus reconciled the <hi>Text</hi> to the preſent <hi>Occaſion,</hi> I ſhall for the more diſtinct handling of the <hi>Words</hi> take no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tice of theſe two Parts in them.</p>

                     <hi>Firſt,</hi> Here is a Caſe ſuppoſed; ſhould we, <hi>after all that is come upon us for our evil deeds,</hi> and <hi>ſince God hath puniſhed us leſs than our iniquities deſerve, and hath given us ſuch a deliverance as this; ſhould we again break his Commandments.</hi>

                     <hi>Secondly,</hi> Here is a ſentence and deter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mination in the Caſe; <hi>Wouldſt thou not be angry with us till thou hadſt conſum'd us, ſo that there ſhould be no remnant nor eſca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ping?</hi> This is not ſpoken doubtfully, though it be put by way of queſtion; but is the more vehemently poſitive, the more peremptorily affirmative; as if he had ſaid, it cannot otherwiſe be in reaſon expected, but that after ſuch repeated provocations <hi>God ſhould be angry with us till he had conſumed us.</hi>

                     <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="I"/>
                     <hi>Firſt,</hi> Here is a Caſe ſuppoſed; ſhould we, <hi>after all that is come upon us for our evil deeds, and for our great treſpaſs; and ſince God hath puniſh'd us leſs than our ini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quities deſerve, and hath given us ſuch a deliverance as this: Should we again break his commandments, and join in affinity with the People of theſe abominations.</hi> In which <hi>Words</hi> theſe following <hi>Propoſitions</hi> ſeem to be involv'd, which I ſhall but juſt men<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, and paſs to the <hi>Second</hi> Part of the <hi>Text.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p n="1">1. That Sin is the cauſe of all our ſufferings, <hi>after all that is come upon us for our evil deeds, and for our great treſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>paſs. Our evil deeds</hi> bring all other evils upon us.</p>
                  <p n="2">
                     <pb n="47" facs="tcp:33693:28"/>2. That great Sins have uſually a pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portionable puniſhment; <hi>after all that is come upon us,</hi> there is the greatneſs of our <hi>puniſhment; for our evil deeds, and for our great treſpaſs,</hi> there is the great<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs of our <hi>Sin.</hi> But when I ſay that great Sins have a proportionable Puniſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, I do not mean that any temporal Puniſhments are proportionable to the great evil of Sin; but that God doth uſually obſerve a proportion in the tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poral puniſhments of Sin, ſo that al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>though no temporal puniſhment be pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portionable to Sin, yet the temporal pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſhment of one Sin holds a proportion to the puniſhment of another; and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſequently, leſſer and greater Sins have proportionably a leſſer and greater Pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſhment.</p>
                  <p n="3">3. That all the Puniſhments which God inflicts in this Life do fall ſhort of the demerit of our Sins; <hi>and ſeeing thou our God haſt puniſh'd us leſs than our ini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quities deſerve.</hi> In the <hi>Hebrew</hi> it is, <hi>and haſt kept down our iniquities,</hi> that is, that they ſhould not riſe up againſt us. The LXX. expreſſeth it very emphatically, <hi>thou haſt eaſed us of our ſins,</hi> that is, thou haſt not let the whole weight of them fall upon us. Were it not for the reſtraints
<pb n="48" facs="tcp:33693:29"/>
which God puts upon his anger, and the merciful mitigations of it, the Sinner would not be able to bear it, but muſt ſink under it. Indeed it is only ſaid in the <hi>Text,</hi> that the puniſhment which God inflicted upon the <hi>Jews,</hi> though it was a long Cap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tivity, was beneath the deſert of their Sins: But yet it is univerſally true, and <hi>Ezra</hi> perhaps might intend to inſinuate ſo much, that all temporal Puniſhments, though never ſo ſevere, are always leſs than our iniquities deſerve.</p>
                  <p n="4">4. That God many times works very great Deliverances for thoſe who are very unworthy of them; <hi>and haſt given us ſuch a Deliverance as this,</hi> notwithſtanding <hi>our evil deeds,</hi> and notwithſtanding <hi>our great Treſpaſs.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p n="5">5. That we are but too apt, even af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter great Judgments, and after great Mercies, to relapſe into our former Sins; <hi>ſhould we again break thy Commandments. Ezra</hi> inſinuates that there was great rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon to fear this, eſpecially conſidering the ſtrange temper of that People, who when God multiply'd his bleſſings upon them, were ſo apt to <hi>wax fat and kick againſt Him</hi>; and tho he had caſt them ſeveral times into the furnace of Afflicti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, though they were melted for the pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent
<pb n="49" facs="tcp:33693:29"/>
yet they were many times but the harder for it afterwards.</p>
                  <p n="6">6. That it is good to take notice of thoſe particular Sins which have brought the Judgments of God upon us. So <hi>Ez<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ra</hi> does here; <hi>after all that is come upon us for our evil deeds, and for our great treſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>paſs</hi>; and, <hi>ſhould we again join in affinity with the People of theſe abominations.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Secondly,</hi> Here is a Sentence and deter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mination <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="II"/> in the Caſe; <hi>wouldſt thou not be angry with us till thou hadſt conſumed us, ſo that there ſhould be no remnant nor eſca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ping?</hi> Which Queſtion, as I ſaid before, doth imply a ſtrong and peremptory af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firmative; as if he had ſaid, after ſuch a provocation there is great reaſon to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clude that God would be angry with us till he had conſumed us.</p>
                  <p>From whence the <hi>Obſervation</hi> contain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed in this part of the <hi>Text</hi> will be this, <hi>That it is a fearful aggravation of Sin, and a ſad preſage of ruin to a People, after great Judgments and great Deliverances, to return to Sin, and eſpecially to the ſame Sins again.</hi> Hear how paſſionately <hi>Ezra</hi> expreſſes himſelf in this Caſe, <hi>verſe</hi> 6. <hi>I am aſhamed, O my God, and bluſh to lift up mine eyes to thee, my God.</hi> Why? what
<pb n="50" facs="tcp:33693:30"/>
was the cauſe of this great ſhame and confuſion of face? He tells us, <hi>verſe</hi> 9. <hi>for we were bondmen, yet our God hath not forſaken us in our bondage, but hath extend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed his mercy to us, to give us a reviving, to ſet up the Houſe of our God, and to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pair the deſolations thereof, and to give us a Wall in</hi> Judah <hi>and in</hi> Jeruſalem; that is, to reſtore to them the free and ſafe exerciſe of their Religion. Here was great Mercy, and a mighty Deliverance indeed; and yet after this they preſently relapſed into a very great ſin, <hi>verſe</hi> 10. <hi>And now, O our God, what ſhall we ſay after this? for we have forſaken thy Command<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>In the handling of this <hi>Obſervation,</hi> I ſhall do theſe <hi>two</hi> things.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Firſt,</hi> I ſhall endeavour to ſhew that this is a very heavy aggravation of Sin, and</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Secondly,</hi> That it is a fatal preſage of ruin to a People.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Firſt,</hi> It is a heavy aggravation of Sin after great Judgments, and after ſignal Mercies and Deliverances to return to Sin, and eſpecially to the ſame Sins again.
<pb n="51" facs="tcp:33693:30"/>
Here are <hi>three</hi> things to be diſtinctly ſpo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken to.</p>
                  <p n="1">1. That it is a great aggravation of Sin to return to it after great Judgments.</p>
                  <p n="2">2. To do this after great Mercies and Deliverances.</p>
                  <p n="3">3. After both to return to the ſame Sins again.</p>
                  <p n="1">1. It is a great aggravation of Sin af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter great Judgments have been upon us to return to an evil courſe. Becauſe this is an Argument of great obſtinacy in evil. The longer <hi>Pharaoh</hi> reſiſted the Judgments of God, the more was his wicked heart hardned, till at laſt he ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riv'd at a monſtrous degree of hardneſs, having been, as the <hi>Text</hi> tells us, hard<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned under <hi>ten plagues.</hi> And we find, that after God had threaten'd the People of <hi>Iſrael</hi> with ſeveral Judgments, he tells them,<note place="margin">Lev. 26.13.</note> that if they <hi>will not be reformed by all theſe things, he will puniſh them ſeven times more for their ſins.</hi> And if the juſt God will in ſuch a caſe puniſh ſeven times more, we may conclude that the Sin is Seven times greater.</p>

                     <hi>they will revolt more and more.</hi> They were but the worſe for Judgments. This renders them <hi>a ſinful Nation, a People laden with iniquity.</hi>

                  <p n="2">2. It is likewiſe a ſore aggravation of Sin, when it is committed after great Mercies and Deliverances vouchſafed to us. Becauſe this is an argument of great

ingratitude. And this we find recorded as a heavy charge upon the People of <hi>Iſrael,</hi>
                     <note place="margin">Judges 8.34, 35.</note> that <hi>they remembred not the Lord their God, who had delivered them out of the hand of all their enemies on every ſide; neither ſhewed they kindneſs to the Houſe of</hi> Jerubbaal, <hi>namely Gideon</hi> who had been their Deliverer, <hi>according to all the good<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs which he had ſhewed to</hi> Iſrael. God, we ſee, takes it very ill at our hands, when we are ungrateful to the <hi>Inſtru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments</hi> of our Deliverance; but much more, when we are unthankful to <hi>Him</hi> the <hi>Author</hi> of it. And how ſeverely does <hi>Nathan</hi> the Prophet reproach <hi>David</hi> upon this account? <hi>Thus ſaid the Lord God of</hi> Iſrael, <hi>I anointed thee King over</hi> Iſrael, <hi>and delivered thee out of the hand of</hi> Saul, &amp;c. <hi>And if this had been too lit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle, I would moreover have done</hi> ſuch and ſuch things. <hi>Wherefore haſt thou deſpis'd the Commandment of the Lord to do evil in his ſight?</hi> God here reckons up his mani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fold mercies and deliverances, and aggra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vates <hi>David</hi>'s Sin upon this account. And he was very angry likewiſe with <hi>Solomon</hi> for the ſame reaſon,<note place="margin">1 Kings 11.9.</note> 
                     <hi>becauſe he had turned from the Lord God of</hi> Iſrael, <hi>who had appear'd to him twice.</hi> However we may ſlight the mercies of God, he
<pb n="54" facs="tcp:33693:32"/>
keeps a punctual and ſtrict account of them. It is particularly noted, as a great blot upon <hi>Hezekiah,</hi>
                     <note place="margin">2 Chron. 32.25.</note> that <hi>he returned not again according to the benefits done unto him.</hi> God takes very ſevere notice of all the unkind and unworthy returns that are made to Him for his Goodneſs.</p>
                  <p>Ingratitude to God is ſo unnatural and monſtrous, that we find Him appealing againſt us for it to the inanimate Crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures.<note place="margin">Iſaiah 1.2.</note> 
                     <hi>Hear O Heavens, and give ear O Earth! for the Lord hath ſpoken; I have nouriſh'd and brought up Children, but they have rebelled againſt me.</hi> And then he goes on and upbraids them with the <hi>Brute</hi> Creatures, as being more grate<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful to men than men are to God. <hi>The Ox knoweth his owner,</hi>

                     <pb n="55" facs="tcp:33693:32"/>There is no greater evidence in the World of an intractable diſpoſition, than not to be wrought upon by kindneſs, not to be melted by mercies, not to be obliged by benefits, not to be tamed by gentle uſage. Nay, God expects that his mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cies ſhould lay ſo great an obligation up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on us, that even a Miracle ſhould not tempt us to be unthankful.<note place="margin">Deut 13.1, 2.</note> 
                     <hi>If there ariſe among you a Prophet,</hi> ſays <hi>Moſes</hi> to the People of <hi>Iſrael, or a Dreamer of dreams, and giveth thee a Sign or a Wonder, and the Sign or the Wonder cometh to paſs, whereof he ſpake to thee, ſaying, let us go after other Gods and ſerve them; thou ſhalt not hearken to the words of that Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phet.</hi> And he gives the reaſon<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>

                     <hi>And the Lord ſaid unto the Chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren of</hi> Iſrael, <hi>did not I deliver you from the</hi> Egyptians, <hi>and from the</hi> Amorites; <hi>from the Children of</hi> Ammon, <hi>and from the</hi> Philiſtins? <hi>The</hi> Zidonians <hi>alſo and the</hi>

                  <p>Thus much for the <hi>firſt part of the Ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſervation,</hi> namely, that it is a fearful ag<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gravation of Sin, after great Judgments and great deliverances to return to Sin, and eſpecially to the ſame Sins again. I proceed to the</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Second</hi> part, namely, That this is a fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tal preſage of ruin to a People; <hi>Should we again break thy Commandments, and join
<pb n="58" facs="tcp:33693:34"/>
in affinity with the People of theſe abomina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions, wouldſt thou not be angry with us till thou hadſt conſumed us, ſo that there ſhould be no remnant nor eſcaping?</hi> And ſo God threatens the People of <hi>Iſrael</hi> in the <hi>Text</hi> which I cited before, <hi>wherefore I will de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liver you no more.</hi>
                     <note place="margin">Judges 10.13.</note>

                  <p>And there is great reaſon why God ſhould deal thus with a People that con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinues impenitent both under the Judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments and Mercies of God.</p>
                  <p n="1">1. Becauſe this doth ripen the Sins of a Nation; and it is time for God to put in his Sickle when a People are ripe for ruin. When the meaſure of their Sins is full, it is no wonder if the Cup of his indignation begin to overflow. It is ſaid of the <hi>Amorites,</hi> four hundred years before God brought that fearful ruin up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on them, that God deferr'd the extirpa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of them,<note place="margin">Gen. 15.16.</note> becauſe <hi>the iniquity of the</hi> Amorites, <hi>was not yet full.</hi> When nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther the Mercies nor the Judgments of God will bring us to repentance, we are then fit for deſtruction; according to

                     <hi>What if God willing to ſhew his wrath, and make his power known, endured with much long ſuffering the veſſels of wrath fitted for deſtruction?</hi> They who are not wrought upon neither by the patience of God's Mercies, nor by the patience of his Judgments, ſeem to be fitted and prepared, to be ripe and ready for deſtruction.</p>
                  <p n="2">2. Becauſe this incorrigible temper ſhews the Caſe of ſuch perſons to be deſperate and incurable.<note place="margin">Iſaiah 1.5.</note> 
                     <hi>Why ſhould they be ſmitten any more?</hi> ſays God of the People of <hi>Iſrael, they will revolt more and more.</hi>

                  <p>When God ſees that all the means which he can uſe do prove ineffectual and to no purpoſe, he will then give over a People, as Phyſicians do their Patients when they ſee that nature is ſpent and their caſe paſt remedy.

                  </p>
                  <p n="1">1. God hath inflicted <hi>great Judgments</hi> upon us <hi>for our evil deeds, and for our great Treſpaſſes.

                  </p>
                  <p>This <hi>War</hi> was drawn out to a great length, and had a Tragical end, in the <hi>Murther</hi> of an excellent <hi>King</hi>; and in the <hi>Baniſhment</hi> of his <hi>Children</hi> into a ſtrange Countrey, whereby they were expoſed to the <hi>Arts</hi> and <hi>Practices</hi> of thoſe of <hi>ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther</hi> Religion; the miſchievous Conſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quences whereof we have ever ſince ſadly labour'd under, and do feel them at this day.</p>
                  <p>
                     <pb n="62" facs="tcp:33693:36"/>And when God was pleas'd in great mercy at laſt to put an end to the miſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rable <hi>Diſtractions</hi> and Confuſions of almoſt <hi>twenty</hi> years, by the happy <hi>Reſto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration</hi> of the <hi>Royal Family,</hi> and our <hi>an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cient Government</hi>; which ſeem'd to pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſe to us a laſting ſettlement, and all the felicities we could wiſh: yet how ſoon was this bright and glorious morn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing overcaſt, by the reſtleſs and black Deſigns of that ſure and inveterate Ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>my of ours, the Church of <hi>Rome,</hi> for the reſtoring of their Religion amongſt us. And there was too much encourage<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment given to this Deſign, by thoſe who had power in their hands, and had brought home with them a ſecret good will to it.</p>
                  <p>For this <hi>great Treſpaſs,</hi> and for our many other Sins, God was angry with us, and ſent among us the moſt raging <hi>Peſtilence</hi> that ever was known in this Nation, which in the ſpace of <hi>eight</hi> or <hi>nine</hi> Months ſwept away near a third part of the Inhabitants of this vaſt and populous <hi>City,</hi> and of the <hi>Suburbs</hi> there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of; beſides a great many <hi>thouſands</hi> more in ſeveral parts of the Nation. <hi>But we did not return to the Lord, nor ſeek him for all this.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>
                     <pb n="63" facs="tcp:33693:36"/>And therefore, the very next year af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter, God ſent a terrible and devouring <hi>Fire,</hi> which in leſs than <hi>three</hi> days time laid the greateſt part of this great <hi>City</hi> in aſhes. And there is too much reaſon to believe that <hi>the Enemy</hi> did this; <hi>that</hi> per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>petual and implacable <hi>Enemy</hi> of the peace and happineſs of this Nation.</p>
                  <p>And even ſince the time of that dread<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful Calamity, which is now above <hi>twenty</hi> years agone, we have been in a continual fear of the cruel Deſigns of that Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty, which had hitherto been inceſſantly working under ground, but now began to ſhew themſelves more openly: and eſpecially ſince a <hi>Prince</hi> of that Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion ſucceeded to the Crown, our eyes have been ready <hi>to fail us for fear, and for looking after</hi> thoſe dreadful things that were coming upon us, and ſeem'd to be even at the door. A <hi>fear</hi> which this Nation could eaſily have rid it ſelf of, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe they that cauſed it were but a handful in compariſon of us, and could have done nothing without a foreign force and aſſiſtance; had not the Princi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ples of Humanity, and of our Religion too, reſtrain'd us from violence and cru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>elty, and from every thing which had the appearance of undutifulneſs to the
<pb n="64" facs="tcp:33693:37"/>
Government which the Providence of God had ſet over us. An inſtance of the like patience under the like provoca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions, for ſo long a time, and after ſuch viſible and open attempts upon them, when they had the Laws ſo plainly on their ſide, I challenge any Nation or Church in the World, from the very foundation of it, to produce. Inſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>much, that if God had not put it into the hearts of our kind <hi>Neighbours,</hi> and of that incomparable <hi>Prince,</hi> who laid and conducted that great Deſign with ſo much skill and ſecrecy, to have appear'd ſo ſeaſonably for our reſcue, our Patience had infallibly, without a Miracle, been our ruine. And I am ſure if our <hi>Enemies</hi> had ever had the like Opportunity in their hands, and had overbalanced us in numbers but half ſo much as we did them, they would never have let it ſlip; but would long ſince have extirpated us utterly, and have <hi>made the remembrance of us to have ceas'd from among men.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>And now if you ask me, for what Sins more eſpecially God hath ſent all theſe Judgments upon us? It will not, I think, become us to be very particular and poſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tive in ſuch determinations. Thus much is certain, That we have all ſinn'd and
<pb n="65" facs="tcp:33693:37"/>
contributed to theſe Judgments; every one hath had ſome hand, more or leſs, in pulling down this vengeance upon the Nation. But we are all too apt to remove the meritorious cauſe of God's Judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments as far as we can from our ſelves, and our own Party, and upon any ſlight pretence to lay it upon others.</p>
                  <p>Yet I will venture to inſtance in <hi>one</hi> or <hi>two</hi> things which may probably enough have had a more particular and immedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ate hand in drawing down the Judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments of God upon us.</p>
                  <p>Our horrible contempt of Religion on the one hand, by our <hi>Infidelity</hi> and <hi>Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phaneneſs</hi>; and our ſhameful abuſe of it on the other, by our groſs <hi>Hypocriſy,</hi> and ſheltering great wickedneſs and immora<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lities under the cloak and profeſſion of Religion.</p>
                  <p>And then, great <hi>Diſſenſions</hi> and Divi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſions, great uncharitableneſs and bitter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs of Spirit among thoſe of the ſame Religion; ſo that almoſt from the be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginning of our happy Reformation the <hi>Enemy</hi> had ſown theſe <hi>Tares,</hi> and by the unwearied Malice and Arts of the Church of <hi>Rome</hi> the ſeeds of Diſſenſion were ſcattered very early amongſt us; and a ſowre humour had been ferment<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
<pb n="66" facs="tcp:33693:38"/>
in the Body of the Nation, both up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on account of <hi>Religion</hi> and <hi>Civil</hi> Inte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reſts, for a long time before things broke out into a Civil War.</p>
                  <p>And more particularly yet; That which is call'd the <hi>great Treſpaſs</hi> here in the <hi>Text,</hi> their <hi>joining in affinity with the People of theſe abominations,</hi> by whom they had been detain'd in a long Capti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vity: This, I ſay, ſeems to have had, both from the nature of the thing, and the juſt Judgment of God, no ſmall influence upon a great part of the Miſeries and Calamities which have befallen us. For had it not been for the countenance which <hi>Popery</hi> had by the <hi>Marriages</hi> and <hi>Al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liances</hi> of our <hi>Princes,</hi> for two or three Generations together, with thoſe of <hi>that</hi> Religion, it had not probably had a con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinuance among us to this day. Which will, I hope, now be a good warning to thoſe, who have the Authority to do it, to make effectual proviſion by Law for the prevention of the like inconvenience and miſchief in this Nation for ever.</p>
                  <p n="2">2. Another <hi>Parallel</hi> between our Caſe and that in the <hi>Text,</hi> is, That <hi>God hath puniſh'd us leſs than our iniquities did de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerve.</hi> And this acknowledgment we have as much reaſon to make for our
<pb n="67" facs="tcp:33693:38"/>
ſelves, as <hi>Ezra</hi> had to do it in behalf of the <hi>Jews; Thou our God haſt puniſh'd us leſs than our iniquities deſerve.</hi> Thou, our <hi>God,</hi> haſt puniſh'd us; there is the reaſon of ſo much mercy and mitigation. It is <hi>God,</hi> and not <hi>Man,</hi> with whom we have to do; and therefore it is, that we <hi>the children of men are not conſumed.</hi> And it is <hi>our</hi> God likewiſe, to whom we have a more peculiar relation, and with whom, by virtue of our Profeſſion of <hi>Chriſtianity,</hi> we are in <hi>Covenant:</hi> Thou <hi>our</hi> God haſt puniſh'd us leſs than our Iniquities deſerve. <hi>He</hi> might juſtly have <hi>pour'd forth all his wrath,</hi> and have made <hi>his jealouſie to have ſmoak'd againſt us,</hi> and have <hi>blotted out the remembrance of us from under Heaven: He</hi> might have <hi>gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven us up to the will of our Enemies,</hi> and into the hands of thoſe <hi>whoſe tender mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cies are cruelty:</hi> He might have <hi>brought us into the net</hi> which they had ſpred for us, and have <hi>laid</hi> a terrible load of <hi>affli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction upon our loins,</hi> and ſuffer'd inſolent <hi>men to ride over our heads,</hi> and <hi>them that hated us</hi> with a perfect hatred, to have <hi>had the rule over us:</hi> But he was gra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciouſly pleas'd <hi>to remember mercy in the midſt of judgment,</hi> and to <hi>repent himſelf for his ſervants, when he ſaw that their
<pb n="68" facs="tcp:33693:39"/>
power was gone,</hi> and that things were come to that extremity, that we were in all humane probability utterly unable to have wrought out our own Deliverance.</p>
                  <p n="3">3. The <hi>laſt Parallel</hi> between <hi>our</hi> Caſe, and <hi>that</hi> in the <hi>Text,</hi> is the great and wonderful <hi>Deliverance</hi> which God hath wrought for us. And whilſt I am ſpeak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of this, <hi>God is my witneſs, whom I ſerve in the Goſpel of his Son,</hi> that I do not ſay one word upon this Occaſion in flattery to men, but in true thankfulneſs to Almighty God, and conſtrain'd there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to from a juſt ſenſe of his great mercy to us all, in this marvellous Deliverance, in this <hi>mighty Salvation which he wrought for us.</hi> So that we may ſay with <hi>Ezra, Since thou our God haſt given us ſuch a De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liverance as THIS:</hi> So great, that we know not how to compare it with any thing but it <hi>Self. God</hi> hath <hi>given us this Deliverance.</hi> And therefore, <hi>Not unto us, O Lord, not unto us, but to thy Name be the praiſe.</hi> For thou knoweſt, and we are all conſcious to our ſelves, that we did in no wiſe deſerve it; but quite the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary. <hi>God</hi> hath <hi>given</hi> it, and it ought to be ſo much the welcomer to us, for co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ming from ſuch a Hand. <hi>It is the Lord's doing,</hi> and therefore ought to be the more
<pb n="69" facs="tcp:33693:39"/>
                     <hi>marvellous in our eyes.</hi> It is a Deliverance full of <hi>Mercy,</hi> and I had almoſt ſaid, full of <hi>Miracle. The Finger of God</hi> was viſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bly in it; and there are plain Signatures and Characters upon it, of a more im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mediate Divine interpoſition. And if we will not <hi>wiſely conſider the Lord's do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings,</hi> we have reaſon to ſtand in awe of that Threatning of <hi>His,</hi>
                     <note place="margin">Pſal. 28.5.</note> 
                     <hi>Becauſe they re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gard not the works of the Lord, nor the operation of his hands, he ſhall deſtroy them, and not build them up.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>It was a wonderful <hi>Deliverance</hi> in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed, if we conſider all the Circumſtan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces of it: The <hi>Greatneſs</hi> of it; and the <hi>ſtrangeneſs</hi> of the <hi>Means</hi> whereby it was brought about; and the <hi>Suddenneſs,</hi> and <hi>Eaſineſs</hi> of it.</p>
                  <p>The <hi>Greatneſs</hi> of it; it was a great Deliverance, from the greateſt Fears, and from the greateſt Dangers; the apparent and imminent Danger of the ſaddeſt Thraldom and <hi>Bondage, Civil</hi> and <hi>Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritual</hi>; both of <hi>Soul</hi> and <hi>Body.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>And it was brought about in a very <hi>extraordinary</hi> manner, and by very <hi>ſtrange</hi> means: Whether we conſider the <hi>great<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs</hi> and <hi>difficulty</hi> of the Enterpriſe; or the cloſeneſs and <hi>ſecrecy</hi> of the Deſign, which muſt of neceſſity be communica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted
<pb n="70" facs="tcp:33693:40"/>
at leaſt to the <hi>Chief</hi> of thoſe who were to aſſiſt and engage in it: Eſpecial<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly the <hi>States</hi> of the <hi>
                        <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>nited Provinces,</hi> who were then in ſo much danger them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves, and wanted more than their own Forces for their own Defence and Secu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity: a kindneſs never to be forgotten by the <hi>Engliſh</hi> Nation. And beſides all this, the difficulties and diſappointments which happen'd, after the Deſign was open and manifeſt, from the uncertainties of <hi>Wind</hi> and <hi>Weather,</hi> and many other <hi>Accidents</hi> impoſſible to be foreſeen and prevented. And yet in Concluſion a ſtrange concurrence of all things, on all ſides, to bring the thing which the Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vidence of God intended to a happy iſſue and effect.</p>
                  <p>And we muſt not here forget the many <hi>Worthies</hi> of our <hi>Nation,</hi> who did ſo ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nerouſly run all hazards of Life and For<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tune, for the preſervation of our <hi>Religi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on,</hi> and the aſſerting of our ancient <hi>Laws</hi> and <hi>Liberties.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Theſe are all ſtrange and unuſual means; but which is ſtranger yet, the very counſels and methods of our Ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mies did prepare the way for all this, and perhaps more effectually, than any coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſel and contrivance of our own could
<pb n="71" facs="tcp:33693:40"/>
have done it. For even the <hi>Jeſuits,</hi> thoſe formal <hi>Politicians</hi> by <hi>Book</hi> and <hi>Rule,</hi> with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out any conſideration or true knowledge of the temper, and intereſt, and other circumſtances of the People they were deſigning upon, and had to deal withal; and indeed without any care to know them: I ſay, the <hi>Jeſuits,</hi> who for ſo long a time, and for ſo little reaſon, have af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fected the reputation of the deepeſt and craftieſt <hi>Stateſ-men</hi> in the World, have upon this great Occaſion, and when their whole <hi>Kingdom of Darkneſs</hi> lay at ſtake, by a more than ordinary <hi>infatuation</hi> and <hi>blindneſs,</hi> ſo outwitted and over-reach'd themſelves in their own counſels, that they have really contributed as much, or more, to our Deliverance from the De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtruction which they had deſigned to bring upon us, than all our wiſeſt and beſt Friends could have done.</p>
                  <p>And then, if we conſider further, how <hi>ſudden</hi> and ſurpriſing it was, ſo that we could hardly believe it when it was ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>compliſh'd; and like the Children of <hi>Iſrael, when the Lord turned again the Captivity of</hi> Zion, <hi>we were like them that dream.</hi> When all things were driving on furiouſly, and in great haſte, then God gave an unexpected check to the Deſigns
<pb n="72" facs="tcp:33693:41"/>
of men, and ſtopp'd them in their full <hi>cariere.</hi> Who among us could have ima<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gin'd, but a few Months ago, ſo happy and ſo ſpeedy an end of our fears and troubles? God hath at once ſcatter'd all our fears, and outdone all our hopes by the greatneſs and ſuddenneſs of our De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liverance. <hi>O that men would praiſe the Lord for his goodneſs, and for his wonder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful works to the children of men.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>And <hi>laſtly,</hi> If we conſider the cheap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs and eaſineſs of this Deliverance. All this was done without a <hi>Battel,</hi> and al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moſt without <hi>Blood.</hi> All the danger is, leſt we ſhould loath it, and grow ſick of it, becauſe it was ſo very eaſy. Had it come upon harder terms, and had we waded to it through a <hi>Red Sea</hi> of Blood, we would have valued it more. But this ſurely is great wantonneſs, and whatever we think of it, one of the higheſt pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vocations imaginable: For there can hardly be a fouler and blacker Ingrati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tude towards Almighty God, than to ſlight ſo great a Deliverance, only be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe it came to us ſo eaſily, and hath coſt us ſo very cheap</p>
                  <p>I will mention but one Circumſtance more, which may not be altogether un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>worthy our obſervation. That God ſeems
<pb n="73" facs="tcp:33693:41"/>
in this Laſt Deliverance, in ſome ſort to have united and brought together all the great Deliverances which He hath been pleas'd to work for this <hi>Nation</hi> againſt all the remarkable attempts of Popery, from the beginning of our <hi>Reformation.</hi> Our wonderful Deliverance from the formida<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble <hi>Spaniſh Invaſion</hi> deſign'd againſt us, happen'd in the Year 1588. And now juſt a <hi>hundred</hi> years after, God was plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed to bring about this <hi>laſt</hi> great and moſt happy Deliverance. That horrid <hi>Gun-powder Conſpiracy,</hi> without <hi>Precedent,</hi> and without <hi>Parallel,</hi> was deſign'd to have been executed upon the <hi>Fifth</hi> Day of <hi>November</hi>; the ſame Day upon which his <hi>Highneſs</hi> the <hi>Prince</hi> of <hi>Orange</hi> landed the <hi>Forces</hi> here in <hi>England</hi> which he brought hither for our Reſcue. So that this is a <hi>Day</hi> every way worthy to be ſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lemnly ſet apart and joyfully celebrated by this <hi>Church</hi> and <hi>Nation,</hi> throughout all Generations; as the fitteſt of all other to comprehend, and to put us in mind to commemorate all the great Deliverances which God hath wrought for Us, from <hi>Popery,</hi> and its inſeparable Companion, <hi>Arbitrary Power.</hi> And we may <hi>then</hi> ſay with the <hi>Holy Pſalmiſt,</hi>
                     <note place="margin">Pſal. 118.23, 24.</note> 
                     <hi>This is the Lord's doing, it is marvellous in our eyes. This is
<pb n="74" facs="tcp:33693:42"/>
the Day which the Lord hath made, we will rejoice and be glad in it.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Secondly,</hi> As the <hi>Caſe</hi> in the <hi>Text</hi> is much like <hi>Ours,</hi> ſo let us take heed that the <hi>Doom</hi> and <hi>Sentence</hi> there be not ſo too. <hi>If after all that is come upon us for our evil deeds, and for our great treſpaſs, and ſince God hath puniſh'd us leſs than our iniquities</hi> did <hi>deſerve; ſhould we again break</hi> his <hi>Commandments, and join in affinity with the People of theſe Abominations, would</hi> He <hi>not be angry with us till he had conſumed us, ſo that there ſhould be no remnant nor eſcaping?</hi> What could we in reaſon expect after all this, but utter ruin and deſtru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction? We may here apply, as St. <hi>Paul</hi> does, God's Dealing with the People of <hi>Iſrael,</hi> to the Times of the <hi>Goſpel</hi>; for he ſpeaks of it as an <hi>Example</hi> and <hi>Admo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nition</hi> to all Ages to the end of the World.<note place="margin">1 Cor. 10.6, 7, 9, 10, 11.</note> 
                     <hi>Now theſe things,</hi> ſays the <hi>Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtle, were our Examples, to the intent we ſhould not luſt after evil things, as they al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſo luſted; Neither be ye Idolaters, as were ſome of them,</hi> &amp;c. <hi>Neither let us tempt Chriſt, as ſome of them alſo tempted, and were deſtroyed of Serpents.</hi> For the ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plication of this <hi>paſſage</hi> we muſt have re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>courſe to the Hiſtory, which gives this
<pb n="75" facs="tcp:33693:42"/>
account of it. <hi>And the People ſpake againſt</hi> God, <hi>and againſt</hi> Moſes,<note place="margin">Numb. 2.5, 6.</note> 
                     <hi>Wherefore have ye brought us up out of</hi> Egypt, <hi>to die in the Wilderneſs?</hi> &amp;c. impeaching <hi>God</hi> and his Servant <hi>Moſes,</hi> as if by this Delive<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rance they had put them into a much worſe condition than they were in when they were in <hi>Egypt. And the Lord ſent fiery Serpents among the People, and they bit the People, and much People of</hi> Iſrael <hi>died.</hi>\ But how was this a <hi>tempting of Chriſt? Neither let us tempt Chriſt, as ſome of them alſo tempted</hi>; that is, let not us, now under the <hi>Goſpel,</hi> tempt <hi>our Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viour</hi> and <hi>Deliverer,</hi> as the <hi>Iſraelites</hi> did <hi>theirs,</hi> by ſlighting that great Deliverance, and by <hi>ſpeaking againſt</hi> God, <hi>and againſt</hi> Moſes. <hi>Neither murmur ye, as ſome of them alſo murmured, and were deſtroyed of the Deſtroyer.</hi> And how far this may con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cern Us, and all Others, to <hi>the end of the World,</hi> who ſhall tempt <hi>Chriſt,</hi> the great <hi>Patron</hi> and <hi>Deliverer</hi> of his Church, and <hi>murmur</hi> without cauſe, as the <hi>Iſrae<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lites</hi> did, at the Deliverances which He works for them, and againſt the <hi>Inſtru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments</hi> of it, the <hi>Apoſtle</hi> tells us in the next words:<note place="margin">V. 11.</note> 
                     <hi>Now all theſe things happened unto them for Enſamples,</hi> or Types; <hi>and they are written for our admonition upon whom
<pb n="76" facs="tcp:33693:43"/>
the ends of the World are come. Let us not tempt Chriſt; who</hi> is now beginning the Glorious Deliverance of his <hi>Church</hi> from the Tyranny of <hi>Antichriſt.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>To draw now towards a Concluſion; I will comprehend my Advice to you upon the whole matter, in as few words as I can.</p>
                  <p>Let us uſe this great <hi>Deliverance</hi> which God hath given us, [<hi>ſuch a Deliverance as this] from our Enemies, and from the Hand of all that hate us</hi>; not by uſing Them as they would have done Us, had we fallen under their Power, with great Inſolence, and Rage, and Cruelty; but with great Moderation and Clemency making as few Examples of Severity as will be conſiſtent with our future ſecurity from the like Attempts upon our <hi>Reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gion</hi> and <hi>Laws:</hi> And even in the Exe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cution of <hi>Juſtice</hi> upon the greateſt <hi>Offen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders,</hi> let us not give ſo much countenance to the ill <hi>Examples</hi> which have been ſet of <hi>Extravagant Fines</hi> and <hi>Puniſhments,</hi> as to imitate thoſe Patterns which with ſo much reaſon we abhor; no, not in the Puniſhment of the <hi>Authors</hi> of them.</p>
                  <p>And let us endeavour, for once, to be ſo wiſe, as not to forfeit the fruits of this
<pb n="77" facs="tcp:33693:43"/>
                     <hi>Deliverance,</hi> and to hinder our ſelves of the benefit and advantage of it, by Breaches and Diviſions among our ſelves. As we have no reaſon to deſire it, ſo I think we can hardly ever hope to under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtand <hi>Popery</hi> better, and the Cruel De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſigns of it, than we do already, both from the long Trial and Experience which we have had of it in this <hi>Nation,</hi> and likewiſe from that diſmal and horrid View which hath of late been given us of the true Spirit and Temper of it in <hi>One</hi> of our Neighbour <hi>Nations,</hi> which hath long pretended to the Profeſſion of the moſt refin'd and <hi>moderate Popery</hi> in the World; but hath now at laſt ſhewed it ſelf in its true Colours, and in the per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fection of a perſecuting Spirit; and have therein given us a moſt ſad and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plorable <hi>Inſtance,</hi> of a <hi>Religion</hi> corrupted and degenerated into that which, if it be poſſible, is worſe than <hi>None.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>And ſince, by the undeſerved Mercy of God to us, we have, upon ſuch eaſy terms in compariſon, eſcap'd their Rage and Fury; let us now at length reſolve, never to <hi>join in affinity with the People of theſe Abominations</hi>; ſince our <hi>Alliances</hi> with them by <hi>Marriage</hi> have had ſo fatal an Influence, both upon the <hi>publick Peace</hi>
                     <pb n="78" facs="tcp:33693:44"/>
and Tranquility of the <hi>Nation,</hi> and upon the Welfare alſo of <hi>private Families.</hi> I have known <hi>Many</hi> Inſtances of this kind, but hardly ever yet ſaw <hi>One</hi> that prov'd happy; but a great many that have been pernicious and ruinous to thoſe <hi>Proteſtant</hi> Families in which ſuch unequal, and, as I think, unlawful <hi>Matches</hi> have been made: Not that ſuch <hi>Marriages</hi> are void in themſelves, but yet for all that ſinful; becauſe of the apparent Danger and Temptation to which thoſe of our <hi>Church</hi> and <hi>Religion</hi> that enter into them do evi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dently expoſe themſelves, of being ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duc'd from their Religion; not by the good Arguments which the other can offer to that purpoſe, but by the ill Arts which they have the Confidence and the Conſcience to make uſe of in the making of <hi>Proſelytes.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>And let us pay our moſt hearty and thankful Acknowledgments, chiefly and in the firſt place to <hi>Almighty God,</hi> the Bleſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed <hi>Author</hi> of this <hi>Deliverance</hi>; and un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der <hi>Him,</hi> to that happy <hi>Inſtrument,</hi> whom God hath been pleaſed, in great pity to this ſinful and unworthy <hi>Nation,</hi> to raiſe up on purpoſe for it, his Highneſs the Prince of <hi>Orange</hi>; and to that end did in his All-wiſe Providence lay the Founda<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
<pb n="79" facs="tcp:33693:44"/>
of our then future <hi>Deliverance,</hi> in that <hi>auſpicious Match</hi> which was conclu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded here in <hi>England,</hi> about eleven years ago, between this Renowned <hi>Prince</hi> and our Excellent <hi>Princeſs.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>This is that moſt Illuſtrious Houſe of <hi>Naſſau</hi> and <hi>Orange,</hi> which God hath ſo highly honoured <hi>above all the Families</hi> of the Earth, to give a Check to the <hi>Two</hi> Great aſpiring <hi>Monarchies</hi> of the <hi>Weſt,</hi> and bold <hi>Attempters</hi> upon the <hi>Liberties</hi> of <hi>Europe:</hi> To the <hi>One,</hi> in the laſt Age; and to the <hi>Other,</hi> in the preſent. As if the <hi>Princes</hi> of this Valiant and Victo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rious <hi>Line</hi> had been of the <hi>Race</hi> of <hi>Her<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cules,</hi> born to reſcue Mankind from Op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſion, and to quell Monſters.</p>
                  <p>And <hi>laſtly,</hi> let us beſeech Almighty God, all whoſe Ways and Works are perfect, That he would <hi>eſtabliſh that which he hath wrought,</hi> and ſtill carry it on to further and greater Perfection. Which, after ſuch an <hi>Earneſt</hi> of his Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vour and Good Will to us, we have no reaſon to doubt but that he is ready to do for us; if by our own <hi>fickleneſs</hi> and <hi>inconſtancy,</hi> diſguſting the Deliverance now it is come, which we ſo earneſtly deſir'd before it came; if by our ingrate<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful <hi>Murmurings</hi> and <hi>Diſcontents,</hi> by our

                  <p>THE <hi>Goſpel</hi> hath promiſed forgive<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs of Sins to us upon <hi>two</hi> Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ditions; That we ſincerely repent of the Sins which we have committed againſt God; and, That we heartily forgive to men the injuries and offences which they have been guilty of towards us.</p>
                  <p>I ſhall at this time, by God's Aſſiſtance, treat of the latter of theſe, from the <hi>Words</hi> which I have recited to you; which are part of our <hi>Saviour</hi>'s excellent
<pb n="84" facs="tcp:33693:47"/>
                     <hi>Sermon upon the Mount.</hi> In which he doth not only explain, but enlarge and perfect the Moral and Natural Law, by adding to it <hi>Precepts</hi> and <hi>Prohibitions</hi> of greater perfection, than either the Law of <hi>Moſes</hi> or the <hi>Natural</hi> Law, in their largeſt extent, did contain.</p>
                  <p>He forbids <hi>Polygamy,</hi> and <hi>Divorce</hi> ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cept only in caſe of <hi>Adultery</hi>; and like<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe <hi>Revenge</hi>; none of which were for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bidden either by the <hi>Law</hi> of <hi>Nature,</hi> or by the <hi>Law</hi> which was given by <hi>Moſes.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>And to theſe <hi>Prohibitions</hi> our <hi>Bleſſed Saviour</hi> adds ſeveral new <hi>Precepts</hi> of greater perfection than any Laws that were extant before. <hi>But I ſay unto you, love your enemies.</hi> The <hi>Jewiſh</hi> Law com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manded them to <hi>love their Neighbour,</hi> meaning their brethren and thoſe of their own Nation: But our <hi>Saviour,</hi> by com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manding us <hi>to love our enemies,</hi> hath in the moſt emphatical manner that can be commanded us to love <hi>all men.</hi> For if any were to be excluded from our Chari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty, none ſo likely to be ſo as our Enemies. So that after a command to love our Ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mies it was needleſs to name any others; becauſe men are naturally apt to love thoſe that love them.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>I ſay unto you, love your enemies</hi>; here
<pb n="85" facs="tcp:33693:47"/>
the inward affection is requir'd. <hi>Bleſs them that curſe you</hi>; here outward Civili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty and Affability are requir'd, in oppoſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion to rude and uncivil Language; for ſo <hi>bleſſing</hi> and <hi>curſing</hi> do in <hi>Scripture</hi> fre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quently ſignify. <hi>Do good to them that hate you</hi>; here real acts of kindneſs are com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manded to be done by us to our bittereſt and moſt malicious Enemies. <hi>Pray for them that deſpitefully uſe you, and perſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cute you.</hi> Theſe are the higheſt expreſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons of Enmity that can be, <hi>calumny</hi> and <hi>cruelty</hi>; and yet we are commanded to pray for thoſe that touch us in theſe <hi>two</hi> tendereſt Points of all other, our <hi>Repu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation</hi> and our <hi>Life</hi> And to ſecure the ſin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerity of our Charity towards our Ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mies, we are requir'd to expreſs it by our hearty Prayers to God for them: <hi>To God,</hi> I ſay, before whom it is both impious and dangerous to diſſemble; and from whom we can expect no mercy for our ſelves, if with feigned Lips we beg it of Him for others.</p>
                  <p>You ſee what is the Duty here requi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red; That we bear a ſincere affection to our moſt malicious and implacable Ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mies, and be ready upon occaſion to give real teſtimony of it.</p>
                  <p>And becauſe this may ſeem a hard du<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty,
<pb n="86" facs="tcp:33693:48"/>
and not ſo eaſy to be reconciled either to our Inclination, or our Reaſon; I ſhall endeavour to ſhew, that this Law is not only reaſonable, but much more perfect and excellent, and the practice of it more eaſy and delightful, and upon all accounts much more for our benefit and advan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tage, than the contrary: And that upon <hi>four</hi> Conſiderations; which I ſhall endea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vour to repreſent with their juſt advan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tage, and ſo as may, I hope, not only con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vince our Judgments of the reaſonable<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs of this Precept, but likewiſe bend and ſway our Wills to the obedience and practice of it.</p>
                  <p n="1">I. If we conſider the nature of the <hi>act</hi> here requir'd, which is to <hi>Love</hi>; which when it is not a mere Paſſion, but under the government of our Reaſon, is the moſt natural, and eaſy, and delightful of all the Affections which God hath planted in Humane Nature: Whereas <hi>ill will,</hi> and <hi>hatred,</hi> and <hi>revenge,</hi> are very troubleſome and vexatious Paſſions. Both the deviſing of miſchief, and the accompliſhment of it, and the reflection upon it afterwards, are all uneaſy: and the conſequences of it many times pernicious to our ſelves. The very deſign of Revenge is troubleſome, and puts the Spirits into an unnatural fer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mentation
<pb n="87" facs="tcp:33693:48"/>
and tumult. The man that me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ditates it is always reſtleſs, his very ſoul is ſtung, ſwells and boiles, is in pain and an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guiſh, hath no eaſe, no enjoyment of it ſelf ſo long as this Paſſion reigns. The execution of it may perhaps be attended with ſome preſent pleaſure, but that plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure is unreaſonable and brutiſh, momen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tany and ſhort, like a flaſh of Lightning, which vaniſheth in the twinkling of an Eye.</p>
                  <p>It is commonly ſaid that Revenge is ſweet, but to a calm and conſiderate mind Patience and Forgiveneſs are ſweeter, and do afford a much more rational and ſolid and durable pleaſure than Revenge. The Monuments of our Mercy and Goodneſs are a far more pleaſing and delightful ſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctacle, than of our Rage and Cruelty. And no ſort of thought does uſually haunt men with more terror, than the reflection upon what they have done in way of Revenge.</p>
                  <p>Beſides that the conſequences of this Paſſion do commonly prove very prejudi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cial to our ſelves. For the Revenge of one injury doth naturally draw on more, and will oblige us for the ſame reaſon to a new Revenge of <hi>them</hi>; and this brings on a perpetual and endleſs circulation of Injuries and Revenges. So that whoever
<pb n="88" facs="tcp:33693:49"/>
ſeeks Revenge upon another doth com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monly in the iſſue take it upon himſelf, and whilſt he thinks to transfer the inju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry which he hath receiv'd upon him that did it, he doubles it upon himſelf.</p>
                  <p>Such, and ſo great are the troubles and inconveniences of a malicious and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vengeful temper: but <hi>there is no torment in Love,</hi> as St. <hi>John</hi> excellently ſays. To be kindly affection'd towards all, to bear no grudge or ill-will, no thought of diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pleaſure or revenge towards any man, is the eaſieſt poſture, the moſt pleaſant ſtate of the Mind. So that if not for their ſakes, yet for our own, we ſhould <hi>Love our Ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mies and do good to them that hate us</hi>; be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe to be thus affected towards all men, is as great a kindneſs to our ſelves as it is charity to others.</p>
                  <p n="2">II. If we conſider the qualification of the <hi>Object</hi>; it is <hi>our Enemy</hi> whom we are requir'd <hi>to Love.</hi> In whom though there be ſomething that is juſtly diſguſtful, yet there is ſomething alſo that is lovely; and if we perſiſt in our kindneſs to him, not<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>withſtanding his enmity to us, the enmity may wear off, and perhaps at length be chang'd into a ſincere and firm friendſhip.</p>
                  <p>'Tis true indeed, that with regard to our ſelves perſonal enmity towards us is
<pb n="89" facs="tcp:33693:49"/>
one of the moſt inconvenient qualities that a man can have, but not therefore the worſt in it ſelf. If we could be im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>partial and lay aſide prejudice, we might perhaps diſcern ſeveral very lovely quali<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties in him who hates us: And Vertue is to be own'd, and prais'd, and lov'd, even in an Enemy. And perhaps his enmity to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards us is not ſo great and inexcuſable a fault, as we apprehend; he is not perhaps our Enemy to that degree, nor ſo altoge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther without cauſe, as we imagine; poſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſibly we have provok'd him, or by his own miſtake, or through the malicious repreſentation of others, he may be in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duc'd to think ſo: And are not we our ſelves liable to the like miſapprehenſions concerning others? of which we are ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny times afterwards convinc'd and a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſham'd: and ſo may he, and then his enmi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty will ceaſe, if we will but have a little pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tience with him, as we always wiſh in the like caſe that others would have with us.</p>
                  <p>At the worſt, though never ſo ſore and cauſeleſs an Enemy, though never ſo bad a Man, yet he is a Man, and as ſuch, hath ſomething in him which the blindeſt Paſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion cannot deny to be good and amiable. He hath the ſame Nature with our ſelves, which we cannot hate, or deſpiſe, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out
<pb n="90" facs="tcp:33693:50"/>
hatred and contempt of our ſelves. Let a man's faults be what they will, they do not deſtroy his Nature and make him ceaſe to be a Man.</p>
                  <p>The <hi>two</hi> great Foundations of <hi>Love</hi> are <hi>Relation</hi> and <hi>Likeneſs. No one thing,</hi> ſays <hi>Tully, is ſo like, ſo equal to another, as one man is to another.</hi> What difference ſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever there may be between us and another man, yea, though he be our Enemy, yet he is ſtill like us in the main; and per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>haps, but too like us in that for which we find ſo much fault with him, a proneneſs to offer affronts and injuries.</p>
                  <p>And there is an eſſential <hi>Relation,</hi> as well as <hi>Likeneſs,</hi> between one man and another; which nothing can ever diſſolve, becauſe it is founded in that which no man can diveſt himſelf of,<note place="margin">Dr. <hi>Bar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>row.</hi>
                     </note> in <hi>Humane Nature.</hi> So far is it from being true, which Mr. <hi>Hobbs</hi> aſſerts as the fundamen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tal <hi>Principle</hi> of his <hi>Politicks, That men are naturally in a ſtate of War and enmity with one another</hi>; that the contrary <hi>Prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciple,</hi> laid down by a much deeper and wiſer man, I mean <hi>Ariſtotle,</hi> is moſt cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainly true, <hi>That men are naturally akin and friends to each other.</hi> Some unhappy accidents and occaſions may make men Enemies, but <hi>naturally every man is friend
<pb n="91" facs="tcp:33693:50"/>
to another:</hi> and that is the ſureſt and moſt unalterable reaſon of things which is founded in Nature, not that which ſprings from mutable accidents and occaſions. So that whoever is recommended to us un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der the notion of a <hi>Man,</hi> ought not to be look'd upon by us, and treated as an Enemy.</p>
                  <p>Conſider farther that an Enemy, even whilſt he is exerciſing his enmity towards us, may do us many acts of real advan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tage; which though they do not pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceed from kindneſs, yet in truth are bene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fits. The malicious Cenſures of our E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nemies, if we make a right uſe of them, may prove of greater advantage to us, than the Civilities of our beſt friends. We can eaſily afford, nay the wiſeſt Men can hardly forbear, to love a <hi>Flatterer</hi>; to em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brace him, and to take him into our bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſom; and yet an open <hi>Enemy</hi> is a thou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſand times better and leſs dangerous than <hi>he.</hi> It is good for many men that they have had Enemies, who have many times been to them the happy occaſion of re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>forming thoſe faults, which none but an Enemy would have taken the freedom, I had almoſt ſaid would have had the Friendſhip, to have told them of.</p>
                  <p>But what if after all, this Enemy of
<pb n="92" facs="tcp:33693:51"/>
ours, this hated man, prove to be one of our beſt Friends? For ſo reconciled Ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mies uſually are. And if any thing will reconcile an Enemy, Love and Kindneſs will. An obſtinate goodneſs is apt to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quer even the worſt of Men. It is hard<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly in the nature of man to withſtand the kindneſs of one whom, by all that we could do, we have not been able to make our enemy. After a man hath done the greateſt injury to another, not only to find no revenge following upon it, but the firſt opportunity taken to oblige him, is ſo very ſurprizing, that it can hardly fail to gain upon the worſt diſpoſition and to melt down the hardeſt temper. So that we ſhould love our Enemies, if not for what they are at preſent, yet for what they may be, and in hope that by theſe means they may in the time become our Friends.</p>
                  <p n="3">III. If we conſider the Excellency and Generoſity of the thing it ſelf. <hi>To love our enemies, and to do good to them that hate us,</hi> is the perfection of goodneſs, and the ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vancement of it to its higheſt pitch. It is the moſt excellent and perfect act of the greateſt and moſt perfect of all Graces and Vertues, I mean <hi>Charity</hi>; which by St. <hi>Paul</hi> is call'd <hi>the bond of perfection</hi>; and
<pb n="93" facs="tcp:33693:51"/>
by St. <hi>James, the perfect</hi> and <hi>the Royal Law:</hi> becauſe it inſpires men with a greatneſs of Mind fit for Kings and Prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces, in whom nothing is more admirable than a generous Goodneſs and Clemency, even towards great Enemies and Offen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders, ſo far as is conſiſtent with the Pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lick Good. Love for love is but Juſtice and Gratitude; Love for no love is favour and kindneſs; but Love for hatred and enmity is a moſt Divine Temper, a ſted<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy and immutable Goodneſs that is not to be ſtirr'd by provocation, and ſo far from being conquer'd that it is rather confirm'd by its contrary: For if Hatred and Enmity do not extinguiſh Love, what can? This is Goodneſs indeed; not only without Merit and Obligation, without Invitation or Motive; but a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt all reaſonable expectation, and in deſpite of all Temptation and Provoca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion to the contrary.</p>
                  <p>So that to return good for evil and love for hatred, is one of the greateſt arguments of a great Mind, and of deep wiſdom and conſideration: For naturally our <hi>firſt</hi> in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clinations and thoughts towards our Ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mies are full of Anger and Revenge; but our <hi>ſecond</hi> and wiſer thoughts will tell us, that Forgiveneſs is much more ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nerous
<pb n="94" facs="tcp:33693:52"/>
than Revenge. And a more glori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous Victory cannot be gain'd over ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther man than this, that when the Injury began on his part the Kindneſs ſhould be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gin on ours. If both the ways were equal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly in our power, yet it is a much more de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſirable Conqueſt to <hi>overcome evil with good,</hi> than with <hi>evil.</hi> By <hi>this,</hi> we can on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly Conquer our Enemy, and may perhaps fail in that; but by the <hi>other,</hi> we certain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly Conquer our ſelves, and perhaps our Enemy too; overcoming him in the no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bleſt manner, and walking him gently till he be cool, and without force effectually ſubduing him to be our Friend. This, as <hi>One</hi> fitly compares it,<note place="margin">Dr. <hi>Bar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>row.</hi>
                     </note> is like a great and wiſe <hi>General,</hi> by Art and Stratagem, by meer dint of Skill and Conduct, by Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tience and wiſe delay; without ever ſtri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king a ſtroke, or ſhedding one drop of blood, to vanquiſh an Enemy, and to make an end of the War without ever putting it to the hazard of a Battel.</p>
                  <p>Revenge is blind and raſh, and does al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ways proceed from impotency and weak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs of Mind. 'Tis Anger that ſpurs men on to it; and Anger is certainly one of the fooliſheſt Paſſions of Humane Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, and which commonly betrays men to the moſt imprudent and unreaſonable
<pb n="95" facs="tcp:33693:52"/>
things. So <hi>Solomon</hi> obſerves,<note place="margin">Prov. 14.29.</note> 
                     <hi>He that is haſty of ſpirit exalteth folly</hi>; and again, <hi>Anger reſteth in the boſom of Fools:</hi>
                     <note place="margin">Eccl. 7.9.</note> But to be able to bear provocation, is an argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of great Wiſdom; and to forgive it, of a great Mind: So the ſame <hi>Wiſe-man</hi> tells us,<note place="margin">Prov. 16.32.</note> 
                     <hi>He that is ſlow to anger is better than the mighty, and he that ruleth his ſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit, than he that taketh a City.</hi> It is a greater thing, in caſe of great Provocati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, to calm a mans own ſpirit, than to ſtorm and take a ſtrong City.</p>
                  <p>Whereas the Angry Man loſeth and lets fall the government of himſelf, and lays the Reins upon the neck of the <hi>Wild Beaſt,</hi> his own brutiſh Appetite and Paſſion; which hurries him on firſt to Revenge, and then to Repentance for the folly which he hath been guilty of in gratify<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing ſo unreaſonable a Paſſion. For it very ſeldom happens that any man executes an act of Revenge, but the very next mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment after he hath done it, he is ſorry for it, and wiſheth he had not done it: Where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>as Patience and Forgiveneſs do wiſely prevent both the miſchief to others, and the trouble to our ſelves, which is uſual<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly conſequent upon Revenge.</p>
                  <p n="4">IV. If we conſider the perfection and prevalency of the <hi>Examples</hi> which the
<pb n="96" facs="tcp:33693:53"/>
                     <hi>Goſpel</hi> propoſeth to us, to allure and en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gage us to the practice of this Duty. And they are the <hi>Examples</hi> of <hi>God</hi> himſelf, and of the <hi>Son of God</hi> in the Nature of Man.</p>
                  <p n="1">1. The Example of <hi>God</hi> himſelf. The <hi>Scripture</hi> doth frequently ſet before us the goodneſs of Gods common Providence to Sinners, for our Pattern. And this is the Argument whereby our Bleſſed <hi>Saviour</hi> preſſeth the Duty in the <hi>Text</hi> upon us, in the <hi>Verſe</hi> immediately after it; <hi>That ye may be the children of your heavenly Father,</hi>
                     <note place="margin">Verſe 45.</note> 
                     <hi>who maketh his Sun to riſe on the evil and the good, and his Rain to fall on the juſt and the unjuſt.</hi> The ſame Argument <hi>Seneca</hi> al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſo urgeth to the ſame purpoſe. <hi>How many</hi> (ſays he) <hi>are unworthy of the light, and yet the Day viſits them?</hi> And ſpeaking of the <hi>Gods, They beſtow,</hi> (ſays he) <hi>their be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nefits upon the unthankful, and are ready to help thoſe who make a bad conſtruction</hi> and uſe <hi>of their kindneſs.</hi> And almoſt in the very words of our <hi>Saviour, Etiam ſcele<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ratis Sol oritur,</hi> &amp;c. <hi>The Sun riſeth even upon the moſt vile and profligate perſons, and the Seas are open to Pirates.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Thus is God affected towards thoſe who are guilty of the greateſt provocati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons towards Him. He beſtows upon them the gifts of his Common Provi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence;
<pb n="97" facs="tcp:33693:53"/>
and not only ſo, but is ready to forgive innumerable Offences to them for <hi>Chriſt</hi>'s ſake. This Pattern the <hi>Apoſtle</hi> pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſeth to our imitation, <hi>Be ye kind,</hi>

                     <hi>tender-hearted, forbearing one another, forgiving one another, even as God for Chriſt's ſake hath forgiven you: Be ye therefore imita<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters of God as dear children.</hi>
                     <note place="margin">chap. 5.1.</note> This temper and diſpoſition of Mind, is the prime ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cellency and perfection of the Divine Nature; and who would not be ambi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tious to be like the moſt perfect and beſt of Beings? And ſo our <hi>B. Saviour</hi> con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cludes this Argument, in the laſt <hi>Verſe</hi> of this <hi>Chapter, Be ye therefore perfect, as your Father which is in Heaven is perfect,</hi> which St. <hi>Luke</hi> renders, <hi>Be ye therefore merciful, as your Father which is in Heaven is merciful.</hi> So that in that very thing which we think to be ſo hard and diffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cult, you ſee that we have Perfection it ſelf for our Pattern. And this <hi>Example</hi> ought to be of ſo much greater force with us, by how much greater reaſon there is why <hi>we</hi> ſhould do thus to one another, than why <hi>God</hi> ſhould do thus to us. Our Offences againſt God are more and great<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er, than any man ever was or could be guilty of towards us: Beſides, that there are many Conſiderations which ought to
<pb n="98" facs="tcp:33693:54"/>
tye up our hands, and may reaſonably re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrain us from falling furiouſly upon one another, which can have no place at all in God. We may juſtly fear, that the conſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quence of our Revenge may return upon our ſelves, and that it may come to be our own caſe to ſtand in need of Mercy and Forgiveneſs from others: And there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore out of neceſſary caution and pru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence, we ſhould take heed not to ſet any bad example in this kind, leſt it ſhould recoil upon our ſelves. We who ſtand ſo much in need of Forgiveneſs our ſelves, ought in all reaſon to be very eaſy to for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>give others. But now the Divine Nature is infinitely above any real injury or ſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fering. God can never ſtand in need of pi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty or forgiveneſs; and yet of his own meer Goodneſs, without any intereſt or deſign, how <hi>ſlow</hi> is he <hi>to anger,</hi> and how <hi>ready to forgive?</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>And, which comes yet nearer to us, there is alſo the <hi>Example</hi> of the <hi>Son of God,</hi> our <hi>Bleſſed Saviour</hi>; who in our Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, and in caſe of the greateſt Injuries and Provocations imaginable, did practiſe this Vertue to the height: And all this for our <hi>ſakes,</hi> as well as for our <hi>Example.</hi> So that he requires nothing of us, but what he himſelf ſubmitted to with the
<pb n="99" facs="tcp:33693:54"/>
greateſt Patience and Conſtancy of Mind; in our <hi>ſtead,</hi> and wholly for our advantage.</p>
                  <p>He <hi>render'd good for evil</hi> to all Mankind, and ſhew'd greater <hi>Love</hi> to us, whilſt we were Enemies to Him, than ever any man did to his Friend.</p>
                  <p>He <hi>pray'd</hi> for thoſe <hi>that deſpitefully uſed him and perſecuted him.</hi> And this, not up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on cool conſideration, after the injury was done, and the pain of his Sufferings was over; but whilſt the ſenſe and ſmart of them was upon him, and in the very Agony and bitterneſs of Death: In the height of all his anguiſh, he pour'd out his Soul an Offering for the Sins of Men, and his Blood a Sacrifice to God, for the expiation of the Guilt of that very Sin whereby they ſhed it; pleading with God, in the behalf of his Murderers, the only Excuſe that was poſſible to be made for their <hi>Malice,</hi> that is, their <hi>Ignorance</hi>; and ſpending his laſt breath in that moſt charitable Prayer for them, <hi>Father forgive them, for they know not what they do.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>The laſt Declaration which he made of his mind, was <hi>Love</hi> to his <hi>Enemies</hi>; and the laſt Legacy he bequeath'd was an ear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſt Requeſt to God for the <hi>Forgiveneſs</hi> of his <hi>Perſecutors</hi> and <hi>Murderers.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>So that if any <hi>Example</hi> ought to be dear
<pb n="100" facs="tcp:33693:55"/>
to us, and effectually to engage us to the imitation of it, this of our <hi>Bleſſed Saviour</hi> ſhould; ſince the Injuries which he ſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fer'd have ſaved us from ſuffering, and the greateſt <hi>Bleſſing</hi> and <hi>Happineſs</hi> that ever befel Mankind is due to this excellent <hi>Example</hi>: And then with what Confi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence, nay with what Conſcience, can we pretend to ſhare in the Benefits of this Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ample, without imitating the Vertues of it?</p>
                  <p>Can we ſeriouſly contemplate the ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſive Kindneſs and Charity of the Son of God to the ſinful Sons of Men, after all our bittereſt Enmity towards him, and moſt cruel and injurious Uſage of him; and all this Charity exercis'd towards us, whilſt he was under the actual ſenſe and ſuffering of theſe things: and yet not be provok'd by an Example ſo admirable in it ſelf, and of ſuch mighty advantage to us, <hi>to go and do likewiſe?</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>But notwithſtanding the power of theſe <hi>Arguments</hi> to perſwade to this <hi>Duty,</hi> I muſt not diſſemble ſome <hi>Objections</hi> which are, I believe, in many of your minds a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt it; and to which for the full clear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of this matter, it will be fit to give ſome ſatisfaction. And they are theſe:</p>
                  <p n="1">1. That this Precept in the <hi>Text</hi> does
<pb n="101" facs="tcp:33693:55"/>
not ſeem ſo well to agree with another of our <hi>Bleſſed Saviour</hi>'s,<note place="margin">Luke 17.3, 4.</note> in another <hi>Evange<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liſt, If thy brother treſpaſs againſt thee, re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>buke him; and if he repent, forgive him. And if he treſpaſs againſt thee ſeven times in a day, and ſeven times in a day turn again to thee, ſaying, I repent, thou ſhalt forgive him. Here</hi> our <hi>Bleſſed Saviour</hi> ſeems not to require Forgiveneſs, unleſs he that hath done the Injury declare his Repentance for it: but the <hi>Text</hi> plainly requires us to forgive thoſe who are ſo far from repent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of their Enmity, that they ſtill purſue it, and exerciſe it upon us. Thus our <hi>Lord</hi> teacheth us, and thus <hi>He</hi> himſelf practiſed towards his <hi>Perſecutors.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>But this appearance of Contradiction will quickly vaniſh, if we conſider that <hi>Forgiveneſs</hi> is ſometimes taken chiefly <hi>for abſtaining from Revenge</hi>; and ſo far we are to forgive our Enemies, even whilſt they continue ſo, and though they do not repent: And not only ſo, but we are alſo to pray for them, and to do good offices to them, eſpecially of common Humani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty: and this is the meaning of the Precept in the <hi>Text.</hi> But ſometimes <hi>Forgiveneſs</hi> does ſignify a <hi>perfect Reconciliation</hi> to thoſe that have offended us, ſo as to take them again into our <hi>Friendſhip</hi>; which
<pb n="102" facs="tcp:33693:56"/>
they are by no means fit for, till they have repented of their Enmity, and laid it aſide. And this is plainly the meaning of the <hi>other Text.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p n="2">2. It is further objected, That this ſeems to be a very imprudent thing, and of dangerous conſequence to our ſelves; becauſe by bearing one Injury ſo patient<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, and forgiving it ſo eaſily, we invite more; and not only tempt our Enemy to go on, but others alſo by his Example to do the like: Which will make ill na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tur'd Men to provoke us on purpoſe, with a crafty deſign to wreſt benefits from us: For what better Trade can a man drive, than to gain Benefits in ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>change for Injuries?</p>
                  <p>To this I anſwer <hi>three</hi> things:</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Firſt,</hi> It is to be feared that there are but few ſo very good, as to make this kind return for Injuries: Perhaps, of thoſe that call themſelves <hi>Chriſtians,</hi> not one in a hundred. And he is not a cunning man that will venture to make an Enemy, when there is the odds of a hundred to one againſt him, that this Enemy of his will take the firſt opportunity to take his Revenge upon him.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Secondly,</hi> It is alſo on the other hand to be hoped, that but very few are ſo pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>digiouſly
<pb n="103" facs="tcp:33693:56"/>
bad, as to make ſo barbarous a return for the unexpected kindneſs of a generous Enemy. And this is encourage<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment enough to the practice of this Duty, if there be a probable hope that it will have a good effect; and however, if it ſhould fall out otherwiſe, yet this would not be reaſon enough to diſcourage our goodneſs, eſpecially ſince the kindneſs which we do to our Friends is liable al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moſt to an equal Objection, that they may prove ungrateful, and become our Enemies: it having been often ſeen that great Benefits, and ſuch as are beyond re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quital, inſtead of making a man more a Friend have made him an Enemy.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Thirdly,</hi> Our <hi>Saviour</hi> never intended by this Precept, that our goodneſs ſhould be blind and void of all prudence and diſcre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, but that it ſhould be ſo managed, as to make our Enemy ſenſible both of his own fault, and of our favour; and ſo, as to give him as little encouragement, as there is reaſon for it, to hope to find the like favour again upon the like provocati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on. Our <hi>Saviour</hi> commands us to do the thing, but hath left it to our prudence to do it in ſuch a manner as may be moſt ef<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fectual, both to reclaim the Offender, and likewiſe to ſecure our ſelves againſt future and further Injuries.</p>
                  <p n="3">
                     <pb n="104" facs="tcp:33693:57"/>3. <hi>Laſtly,</hi> It is objected, What can we do more to our beſt Friends, than to love them and bleſs them, than to do good to them and to pray for them? And are we then to make no difference betwixt our Enemies and our Friends?</p>
                  <p>Yes ſurely; and ſo we may, notwith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtanding this Precept: For there are de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>grees of Love, and there are Benefits of ſeveral rates and ſizes. Thoſe of the firſt rate we may with reaſon beſtow upon our Friends, and with thoſe of a ſecond or third rate there is all the reaſon in the World why our Enemies ſhould be very well contented. Beſides that we may ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtain from Revenge, yea, and love our E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nemy, and wiſh him and do him good; and yet it will not preſently be neceſſary that we ſhould take him into our boſom, and treat and truſt him as our intimate and familiar Friend. For every one that is not our Enemy is not fit to be our Friend; much leſs one that hath been our Enemy, and perhaps is ſo ſtill. There muſt be a great change in him that hath been our E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nemy, and we muſt have had long expe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rience of him, before it will be fit, if ever it be ſo, to take him into our Friendſhip.</p>
                  <p>All that now remains is to make ſome <hi>Inferences</hi> from the Diſcourſe which I
<pb n="105" facs="tcp:33693:57"/>
have made upon this Argument, by way of Application. And they ſhall be theſe <hi>four:</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p n="1">I. If we think it ſo very difficult to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mean <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="I"/> our ſelves towards our Enemies, as the <hi>Chriſtian</hi> Religion doth plainly re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quire us to do; to forgive them, and love them, and pray for them, and to do good offices to them, then certainly it concerns us in prudence to be very careful how we make Enemies to our ſelves. One of the firſt Principles of Humane Wiſdom, in the conduct of our Lives, I have ever thought to be this, To have a few inti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mate Friends, and to make no Enemies, if it be poſſible, to our ſelves. St. <hi>Paul</hi> lays a great ſtreſs upon this, and preſſeth it very earneſtly. For after he had forbidden Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venge, <hi>Recompence to no man evil for evil.</hi>
                     <note place="margin">Rom. 12.17.</note> As if he were very ſenſible how hard a matter it is to bring men to this, he advi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeth in the next words, to prevent, if it be poſſible, the occaſions of Revenge,<note place="margin">V. 18.</note> 
                     <hi>If it be poſſible, and as much as lieth in you, live peace<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ably with all men:</hi> That is, if we can avoid it, have no Enmity with any man. And that for two weighty Reaſons.</p>
                  <p>The <hi>firſt</hi> I have already intimated; be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe it is ſo very hard to behave our ſelves towards Enemies as we ought. This we
<pb n="106" facs="tcp:33693:58"/>
ſhall find to be a difficult Duty to Fleſh and Blood; and it will require great Wiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom, and Conſideration, and Humility of Mind, for a Man to bring down his Spirit to the Obedience of this Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mand: For the fewer Enemies we have, the leſs occaſion will there be of conteſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing this hard Point with our ſelves.</p>
                  <p>And the <hi>other</hi> Reaſon is, I think, yet plainer and more convincing, becauſe E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nemies will come of themſelves, and let a man do what he can, he ſhall have ſome. Friendſhip is a thing that needs to be cultivated, if we would have it come to any thing; but Enemies, like ill Weeds, will ſpring up of themſelves without our care and toil. <hi>The Enemy,</hi> as our <hi>Saviour</hi> calls the <hi>Devil,</hi> will ſow theſe <hi>Tares in the night,</hi> and when we leaſt diſcern it will ſcatter the Seeds of Diſcord and Enmity among men; and will take an advantage either from the Envy, or the Malice, or the Miſtakes of Men, to make them E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nemies to one another. Which would make one wonder to ſee what care and pains ſome men will take, to provoke Mankind againſt them; how they will lay about them, and ſnatch at opportuni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties to make themſelves Enemies, as if they were afraid to let the happy occaſion
<pb n="107" facs="tcp:33693:58"/>
ſlip by them: But all this care and fear ſurely is needleſs; we may ſafely truſt an ill natur'd World, that we ſhall have Ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mies enough, without our doing things on our part to provoke and procure them.</p>
                  <p>But above all, it concerns every man in prudence to take great care not to make perſonal Enemies to himſelf; for theſe are the <hi>ſoreſt</hi> and the <hi>ſureſt</hi> of all other, and when there is an opportunity for it, will ſit hardeſt upon us. Injuries done to the Publick are certainly the greateſt, and yet they are many times more eaſily forgiven, than thoſe which are done to particular Perſons. For when Revenge is every bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dies work, it may prove to be no bodies. The general Wrongs which are done to Humane Society, do not ſo ſenſibly touch and ſting men, as perſonal Injuries and Provocations. The <hi>Law</hi> is never angry or in paſſion, and it is not only a great inde<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cency, but a fault, when the <hi>Judges</hi> of it are ſo Heat of Proſecution belongs to par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticular Perſons; and it is <hi>their</hi> memory of Injuries, and deſire to Revenge them, and diligence to ſet on and ſharpen the Law, that is chiefly to be dreaded: And if the truth were known, it is much to be fear'd that there are almoſt as few private as publick <hi>Acts</hi> of <hi>Oblivion</hi> paſs'd in the
<pb n="108" facs="tcp:33693:59"/>
World; and they commonly paſs as ſlow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, and with as much difficulty, and not till the grace and good effect of them is almoſt quite loſt.</p>
                  <p n="2">
                     <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="II"/> II. <hi>Secondly,</hi> If we ought to be thus af<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>fected towards our Enemies, how great ought our kindneſs, and the expreſſions of it, to be to others? To thoſe who never diſ<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>obliged us, nor did us any Injury by word or deed; to thoſe more eſpecially, who ſtand in a nearer relation to us; to our na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tural Kindred, and to our ſpiritual Bre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thren to whom we are ſo ſtrongly link'd and united by the common Bond of Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtianity; and laſtly, to our Benefactors, and thoſe who have been before-hand with us in obligation: For all theſe are ſo many ſpecial Ties and Endearments of men to one another, founded either in <hi>Nature</hi> or <hi>Religion,</hi> or in common <hi>Juſtice</hi> and <hi>Grati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tude.</hi> And therefore between all theſe and our Enemies we ought to make a very wide and ſenſible difference, in our Car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riage and Kindneſs towards them. And if we do not do ſo, we repreſent our <hi>Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viour</hi> as an unreaſonable Lawgiver, and do perverſly interpret this <hi>Precept</hi> of his contrary to the reaſonable and equitable meaning of it. For whatever degree of Kindneſs is here required towards our E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nemies,
<pb n="109" facs="tcp:33693:59"/>
it is certain that ſo much more is due to others, as according to the true pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portion of our tie and obligation to them they have deſerved at our hands: nothing being more certain than that our <hi>Bleſſed Saviour,</hi> the Founder of our Religion, did never intend by any Precept of it to cancel any real Obligation of Nature, or Juſtice, or Gratitude; or to offer Violence in the leaſt to the common Reaſon of Mankind.</p>
                  <p n="3">III. <hi>Thirdly,</hi> Hence we learn the excel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lency <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="III"/> and the Reaſonableneſs of the <hi>Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtian Religion,</hi> which hath carried our Du<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty ſo high in things which do ſo directly tend to the Perfection of <hi>Humane Nature,</hi> and to the Peace of <hi>Humane Society</hi>; and, which if all things be rightly conſider'd, are moſt agreeable to the cleareſt and beſt Reaſon of Mankind: So that thoſe things which were heretofore look'd upon, and that only by ſome few of the wiſer ſort, as Heroical Inſtances of Goodneſs and above the common rate of Humanity, are now by the <hi>Chriſtian Religion</hi> made the indiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>penſable Duties of all Mankind. And the Precepts of no other Religion, that ever yet appeared in the World, have advan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ced Humane Nature ſo much above it ſelf, and are ſo well calculated for the Peace and Happineſs of the World, as
<pb n="110" facs="tcp:33693:60"/>
the Precepts of the <hi>Chriſtian Religion</hi> are: for they ſtrictly forbid the doing of In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>juries, by way of prevention; and in caſe they happen, they endeavour to put a preſent ſtop to the progreſs of them, by ſo ſeverely forbidding the revenging of them.</p>
                  <p>And yet after all this, it muſt be ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>knowledg'd to be a very untoward <hi>Obje<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction</hi> againſt the Excellency and the Effi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cacy of the <hi>Chriſtian Religion,</hi> that the Practice of ſo many <hi>Chriſtians</hi> is ſo un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>equal to the Perfection of theſe Precepts. For who is there in the Changes and Revolutions of Humane Affairs, and when the Wheel of Providence turns them uppermoſt, and lays their Enemies at their Feet, that will give them any Quarter? Nay, that does not greedily ſeize upon the firſt opportunities of Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venge, and like an <hi>Eagle,</hi> hungry for his Prey, make a ſudden ſtoop upon them with all his force and violence; and when he hath them in his <hi>Pounces,</hi> and at his Mercy, is not ready to tear them in pieces?</p>
                  <p>So that after all our Boaſts of the Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cellency of our Religion, where is the practice of it? This, I confeſs is a terri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble <hi>Objection</hi> indeed; and I muſt intreat of you, <hi>my Brethren,</hi> to help me to the
<pb n="111" facs="tcp:33693:60"/>
beſt Anſwer to it: Not by any nice <hi>Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtinctions</hi> and <hi>Speculations</hi> about it, but by the careful and honeſt Practice of this Precept of our Religion.</p>
                  <p>This was the old <hi>Objection</hi> againſt <hi>Philo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſophy,</hi> that many that were Philoſophers in their Opinions were faulty in their Lives: But yet this was never thought by wiſe men to be a good Objection againſt Phi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>loſophy. And unleſs we will lay more weight upon the <hi>Objections</hi> againſt Religi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, and preſs them harder than we think it reaſonable to do in any other Caſe, we muſt acknowledge likewiſe, that this <hi>Ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jection</hi> againſt Religion is of no force. Men do not caſt off the <hi>Art</hi> of <hi>Phyſick,</hi> be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe many <hi>Phyſicians</hi> do not live up to their own Rules, and do not themſelves follow thoſe Preſcriptions which they think fit to give to others: and there is a plain reaſon for it becauſe their ſwerving from their own Rules doth not neceſſarily ſignify that their Rules are not good, but only that their Appetites are unruly, and too hard and headſtrong for their Rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon: Nothing being more certain than this, That Rules may be very reaſonable, and yet they that give them may not fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low them.</p>
                  <p n="4">
                     <pb n="112" facs="tcp:33693:61"/>
                     <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="IV"/> IV. The <hi>fourth</hi> and <hi>laſt Inference</hi> from this whole Diſcourſe ſhall be this, That being convinced by what hath been ſaid upon this Argument, of the Reaſonable<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs of this Duty, we would reſolve upon the Practice of it, when ever there is oc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>caſion offer'd for it in the courſe of our Lives. I need not to put you in mind, that there is <hi>now</hi> like to be great occaſion for it: I ſhall only ſay, that whenever there is ſo, nothing can be tied more ſtrictly upon us than this Duty is.</p>
                  <p>It hath often been a great Comfort and Confirmation to me, to ſee the <hi>Humanity</hi> of the <hi>Proteſtant Religion,</hi> ſo plainly diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>covering it ſelf, upon ſo many occaſions, in the practice of the Profeſſours of it. And ſetting aſide all other advantages which <hi>our</hi> Religion hath been evidently ſhewn to have above <hi>Popery</hi> in point of Reaſon and Argument, I cannot for my life but think <hi>that</hi> to be the beſt Religi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on which makes the beſt Men, and from the nature of its Principles is apt to make them ſo; moſt kind and merciful, and charitable; and moſt free from Malice, and Revenge, and Cruelty.</p>
                  <p>And therefore our <hi>Bleſſed Saviour,</hi> who <hi>knew what was in man</hi> better than any man that ever was, knowing our great relu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctancy

and backwardneſs to the practice of this Duty, hath urged it upon us by ſuch forcible and almoſt violent Argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments, that if we have any tenderneſs for our ſelves, we cannot refuſe Obedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence to it. For he plainly tells us, That no Sacrifice that we can offer will appeaſe God towards us, ſo long as we our ſelves are implacable to Men; <hi>Verſe</hi> 23<hi>d.</hi> of this <hi>Chapter, If thou bring thy gift to the Al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tar, and there remembreſt that thy brother hath ought againſt thee, leave thy gift be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore the Altar, and go thy way: firſt go and be reconciled to thy brother, and then come and offer thy gift.</hi> To recommend this Duty effectually to us, <hi>He</hi> gives it a pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ference to all the <hi>poſitive</hi> Duties of Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion: <hi>Firſt go and be reconciled to thy brother, and then come and offer thy gift.</hi> Till this Duty be diſcharged, God will accept of no <hi>Service,</hi> no <hi>Sacrifice</hi> at our hands. And therefore our <hi>Liturgy</hi> doth with great reaſon declare it to be a neceſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſary Qualification for our Worthy Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiving of the Sacrament, that we be <hi>in Love and Charity with our Neighbours</hi>; becauſe this is a <hi>Moral</hi> Duty, and of eter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal Obligation, without which no <hi>poſitive</hi> part of Religion, ſuch as the <hi>Sacraments</hi> are, can be acceptable to GOD; eſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pecially
<pb n="114" facs="tcp:33693:62"/>
ſince in this <hi>Bleſſed Sacrament</hi> of <hi>Chriſt</hi>'s Body and Blood we expect to have the Forgiveneſs of our Sins ratified and confirmed to us: Which how can we hope for from GOD, if we our ſelves be not ready to forgive one ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther?</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>He ſhall have judgment without mercy,</hi> ſays St. <hi>James, who hath ſhewed no mercy.</hi> And in that excellent <hi>Form</hi> of <hi>Prayer</hi> which our <hi>Lord</hi> himſelf hath given us, <hi>He</hi> hath taught us ſo to ask Forgiveneſs of God, as not to expect it from Him, if we do not forgive one another. So that if we do not practice this Duty, as hard as we think it is, every time that we put up this <hi>Petition</hi> to God, [<hi>Forgive us our Treſpaſſes, as we forgive them that Treſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>paſs againſt us</hi>;] we ſend up a terrible <hi>Imprecation</hi> againſt our ſelves, and do in effect beg of God not to forgive us. And therefore, to imprint this matter the deeper upon our minds, our <hi>Bleſſed Savi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>our</hi> immediately after the recital of this Prayer, hath thought fit to add a very re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>markable enforcement of this <hi>Petition,</hi> above all the reſt; <hi>For if,</hi> ſays He, <hi>ye forgive men their treſpaſſes,</hi>
                     <note place="margin">Matth. 6.14, 15.</note> 
                     <hi>your heavenly Father will alſo forgive you: But if ye for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>give not men their treſpaſſes, neither
<pb n="115" facs="tcp:33693:62"/>
will your Father forgive your treſpaſſes.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>And our <hi>Saviour</hi> hath likewiſe in his <hi>Goſpel</hi> repreſented to us, both the rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſonableneſs of this Duty, and the Dan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger of doing contrary to it, in a very lively and affecting Parable, deliver'd by him to this purpoſe:<note place="margin">Matth. 18.23.</note> Concerning <hi>a wick<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed Servant,</hi> who, when <hi>his Lord</hi> had but juſt before forgiven him a vaſt Debt of <hi>ten thouſand Talents,</hi> took his poor <hi>Fellow-ſervant by the throat,</hi> and, notwithſtand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing his humble Submiſſion and earneſt In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>treaties to be favourable to him, haled him to Priſon for a trifling Debt of an <hi>hundred Pence.</hi> And the <hi>Application</hi> which he makes of this <hi>Parable,</hi> at the end of it, is very terrible, and ſuch as ought never to go out of our minds; <hi>So likewiſe,</hi>
                     <note place="margin">V. 35.</note> ſays <hi>He, ſhall my heavenly Father do alſo unto you, if ye do not from your hearts forgive every one his brother his treſpaſſes.</hi> One might be apt to think at firſt view, that this <hi>Parable</hi> was over done, and wanted ſomething of a due <hi>Decorum</hi>; it being hardly credible, that a man after he had been ſo mercifully and generouſly dealt withal, as upon his humble Requeſt to have ſo huge a Debt ſo freely forgiven, ſhould whilſt the memory of ſo much Mercy was freſh upon him, even the ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry
<pb n="116" facs="tcp:33693:63"/>
next moment, handle his <hi>Fellow Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vant,</hi> who had made the ſame humble ſubmiſſion and requeſt to him which he had done to his <hi>Lord,</hi> with ſo much roughneſs and cruelty, for ſo inconſide<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rable a Sum. This, I ſay, would hardly ſeem credible; did we not ſee in experi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence how very unreaſonable and unmer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciful ſome men are, and with what con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fidence they can ask and expect great mercy from God, when they will ſhew none to Men.</p>
                  <p>The greatneſs of the Injuries which are done to us, is the reaſon commonly pleaded by us why we cannot forgive them. But whoever thou art, that makeſt this an Argument why thou canſt not forgive thy Brother, lay thine hand up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on thy heart, and bethink thy ſelf how many more and much greater Offences thou haſt been guilty of againſt God: Look up to that Juſt and Powerful Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing that is above, and conſider well, Whether thou doſt not both expect and ſtand in need of more Mercy and Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vour from <hi>Him,</hi> than thou canſt find in thy heart to ſhew to thine offending Bro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther?</p>
                  <p>We have all certainly great reaſon to expect that as we uſe one another, God
<pb n="117" facs="tcp:33693:63"/>
will likewiſe deal with us. And yet after all this, how little is this Duty practis'd among Chriſtians? And how hardly are the beſt of us brought to love our Ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mies, and to forgive them? And this, notwithſtanding that all our hopes of Mercy and Forgiveneſs from God do de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pend upon it. How ſtrangely inconſiſtent is our practice and our hope? And what a wide diſtance is there between our ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pectations from GOD, and our dealings with Men? How very partial and un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>equal are we, to hope ſo eaſily to be for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>given, and yet to be ſo hard to forgive?</p>
                  <p>Would we have GOD, for <hi>Chriſt</hi>'s ſake, to forgive us thoſe numberleſs and monſtrous provocations which we have been guilty of againſt His Divine Maje<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſty? And ſhall we not for <hi>His</hi> ſake, for whoſe ſake we our ſelves are forgiven, be willing to forgive one another?</p>
                  <p>We think it hard to be oblig'd to for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>give great Injuries, and often repeated; and yet <hi>Woe</hi> be to us all, and moſt miſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rable ſhall we be to all Eternity, if GOD do not all this to us, which we think to be ſo very hard and unreaſonable for us to do to one another.</p>
                  <p>I have ſometimes wonder'd how it ſhould come to paſs, that ſo many perſons
<pb n="118" facs="tcp:33693:64"/>
ſhould be ſo apt to deſpair of the Mercy and Forgiveneſs of GOD to them; eſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pecially conſidering what clear and ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſs Declarations GOD hath made of his readineſs to forgive our greateſt Sins and Provocations upon our ſincere Repentance: But the wonder will be very much abated, when we ſhall conſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der with how much difficulty men are brought to remit great Injuries, and how hardly we are perſwaded to refrain from flying upon thoſe who have given us any conſiderable provocation. So that when men look into themſelves, and ſhall care<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fully obſerve the motions of their own minds towards thoſe againſt whom they have been juſtly exaſperated, they will ſee but too much reaſon to think that For<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>giveneſs is no ſuch eaſy matter.</p>
                  <p>But our comfort in this caſe is, That <hi>GOD</hi> is not as <hi>Man</hi>; that <hi>his ways are not as our ways, nor his thoughts as our thoughts</hi>; but <hi>as the Heavens are high above the Earth, ſo are his ways above our ways, and his thoughts above our thoughts.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>And the beſt way to keep our ſelves from deſpairing of GOD's Mercy and Forgiveneſs to us, is to be eaſy to grant Forgiveneſs to others: And without this, as GOD hath reaſon to deny For<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>giveneſs
<pb n="119" facs="tcp:33693:64"/>
to us, ſo we our ſelves have all the reaſon in the World utterly to deſpair of it.</p>
                  <p>It would almoſt tranſport a <hi>Chriſtian</hi> to read that admirable Paſſage of the Great <hi>Heathen</hi> Emperour and Philoſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pher <hi>M. Aurelius Antoninus, Can the Gods,</hi>

                  </p>

                  <p>IN the accounts of Wiſe men, one of the firſt Rules and Meaſures of human actions is this, <hi>To regard every thing more or leſs, according to the degree of its conſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quence and importance to our happineſs.</hi> That which is moſt neceſſary to that End ought in all reaſon to be minded by us in the firſt place, and other things only ſo far as they are conſiſtent with that great End, and ſubſervient to it.</p>
                  <p>Our <hi>B. Saviour</hi> here tells us that <hi>there is one thing needful,</hi> that is, one thing which ought firſt and principally to be regarded by us: And what <hi>that</hi> is, it is of great concernment to us all to know, that we may mind and purſue it as it de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerves.</p>
                  <p>
                     <pb n="124" facs="tcp:33693:67"/>And we may eaſily underſtand what it is by conſidering the Context, and the occaſion of theſe Words, which was brief<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly this: Our <hi>Saviour,</hi> as He went about preaching the Kingdom of God, came into a certain Village, where He was enter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain'd at the houſe of two devout Siſters. The <hi>elder,</hi> who had the care and manage<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of the Family and the Affairs of it, was imployed in making entertainment for ſuch a <hi>Gueſt:</hi> The <hi>other</hi> ſate at our <hi>Saviour</hi>'s feet, attending to the Doctrine of Salvation which he preach'd.</p>
                  <p>The <hi>elder</hi> finding her ſelf not able to do all the buſineſs alone, deſires of our <hi>Saviour</hi> that he would command her Siſter <hi>to come and help her.</hi> Upon this our <hi>Saviour</hi> gives her this gentle repre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>henſion, <hi>Martha, Martha, Thou art care<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful and troubled about many things, but one thing is needful.</hi> And what <hi>that</hi> is he declares in the next words, <hi>And</hi> Mary <hi>hath choſen that good part, which ſhall not be taken away from her</hi>; that is, ſhe hath choſen to take care of her Salvation, which is infinitely more conſiderable than any thing elſe.</p>
                  <p>Our <hi>Saviour</hi> doth not altogether blame <hi>Martha</hi> for her reſpectful care of Him, but cmmends her <hi>Siſter</hi> for her greater
<pb n="125" facs="tcp:33693:67"/>
care of her Soul; which made her either wholly to forget, or unwilling to mind other things at that time. So that, upon the whole matter, He highly approves her wiſe choice, in preferring an attentive regard to his <hi>Doctrine,</hi> even before that which might be thought a neceſſary civi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lity to His <hi>Perſon.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>From the <hi>Words</hi> thus explain'd the <hi>Ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſervation</hi> which I ſhall make is this.</p>
                  <p>That the care of Religion and of our Souls is <hi>the one thing neceſſary,</hi> and that which every man is concern'd in the firſt place and above all other things to mind and regard.</p>
                  <p>This <hi>Obſervation</hi> ſeems to be plainly contain'd in the <hi>Text.</hi> I ſhall handle it as briefly as I can; and then by way of Ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plication ſhall endeavour to perſuade You and my ſelf to mind this <hi>one thing neceſſary.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>And in ſpeaking to this ſerious and weighty Argument I ſhall do theſe <hi>two</hi> things.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Firſt,</hi> I ſhall endeavour to ſhew where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in this care of Religion and of our Souls does conſiſt.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Secondly,</hi> To convince men of the ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſity of taking this care.</p>
                  <p n="1">I. I ſhall ſhew wherein this care of <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="I"/> Religion and of our Souls doth conſiſt.
<pb n="126" facs="tcp:33693:68"/>
And this I ſhall endeavour to do with all the plainneſs I can, and ſo as every one that hears me may underſtand and be ſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficiently directed what is neceſſary for him to do in order to his eternal Salvation.</p>
                  <p>And of this I ſhall give an account in the <hi>five</hi> following <hi>Particulars,</hi> in which I think the main buſineſs of Religion and the due care of our Souls does conſiſt.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Firſt,</hi> In the diſtinct knowledge, and in the firm belief and perſuaſion of thoſe things which are neceſſary to be known and believed by us in order to our eternal Salvation.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Secondly,</hi> In the frequent Examination of our lives and actions, and in a ſincere Repentance for all the errours and miſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>carriages of them.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Thirdly,</hi> In the conſtant and daily ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>erciſe of Piety and Devotion.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Fourthly,</hi> In avoiding thoſe things which are pernicious to our Salvation, and whereby men do often hazard their Souls.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Fifthly,</hi> In the even and conſtant pra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctice of the ſeveral Graces and Vertues of a good Life.</p>
                  <p n="1">I. The due care of Religion and our Souls does conſiſt in the diſtinct know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge, and in the firm belief and perſua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion of thoſe things which are neceſſary to
<pb n="127" facs="tcp:33693:68"/>
be known and believ'd by us in order to our eternal Salvation.</p>
                  <p>For this knowledge of the neceſſary Principles and Duties of Religion is the foundation of all good Practice, wherein the life of Religion doth conſiſt. And without this no man can be truly Religi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous. <hi>Without faith,</hi> ſaith the Apoſtle to the <hi>Hebrews,</hi> it is <hi>impoſſible to pleaſe God:</hi>
                     <note place="margin">Heb. 11.6.</note> 
                     <hi>For he that cometh to God, muſt believe that He is, and that He is a rewarder of them that diligently ſeek Him.</hi> Now theſe two expreſſions of <hi>pleaſing God</hi> and <hi>ſeeking Him,</hi> are plainly of the ſame importance, and do both of them ſignify <hi>Religion,</hi> or the <hi>Worſhip</hi> and Service of God; which doth antecedently ſuppoſe our firm belief and perſuaſion of theſe <hi>two</hi> fundamental <hi>Principles</hi> of all Religion, That <hi>there is a God,</hi> and, That <hi>He will reward thoſe that ſerve him:</hi> Becauſe unleſs a man do firſt believe theſe, there would neither be ground nor encouragement for any ſuch thing as Religion.</p>
                  <p>And this knowledge of the neceſſary <hi>Principles</hi> of Religion our <hi>B. Saviour</hi> calls <hi>eternal Life,</hi> becauſe it is ſo fundamen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tally neceſſary in order to our attaining of it: <hi>This is life eternal,</hi> ſays <hi>He,</hi>
                     <note place="margin">Joh. 17.3.</note> 
                     <hi>to know thee, the only true God; and Him
<pb n="128" facs="tcp:33693:69"/>
whom thou haſt ſent, Jeſus Chriſt,</hi> that is, to be rightly inſtructed in the knowledge of <hi>the only true God,</hi> and <hi>of his Son Jeſus Chriſt our Lord:</hi> Under which <hi>two</hi> general <hi>Heads</hi> are comprehended all the neceſſary Principles both of the <hi>Natural</hi> and of the <hi>Chriſtian</hi> Religion.</p>
                  <p>And to the attaining of this know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge which is abſolutely neceſſary to Sal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vation, no ſuch extraordinary pains and ſtudy is requir'd; but only a teachable diſpoſition, and a due application of mind. For whatever in Religion is neceſſary to be known by all, muſt in all reaſon be plain and eaſie, and lye level to all capa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cities; otherwiſe we muſt ſay, that God <hi>who would have all men to be ſaved</hi> hath not provided for the Salvation of all men. And therefore, now that the knowledge of the true God and the light of Chriſtia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity are ſhed abroad in the world, all that enjoy the Goſpel are, or may be, ſuffici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ently inſtructed in all things neceſſary to their happineſs: unleſs ſuch care be uſed, as is in the Church of <hi>Rome,</hi> to <hi>take away the key of knowledge,</hi> and to lock up the Scriptures from the People in an un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>known Tongue; and this, as they pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tend, upon a very charitable conſiderati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, only it is to be hop'd that it is not
<pb n="129" facs="tcp:33693:69"/>
true, that the generality of Mankind are mad and have need to be kept in the dark. But ſuppoſing men to be allowed thoſe means of knowledg which God affords, and hath appointed for us, the great diffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culty doth not commonly lie in mens Un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtandings, but in their Wills: Only when men know theſe things, they muſt attend to them and conſider them; that the light which is in their Underſtandings may warm their Hearts, and have its due in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fluence upon their Lives.</p>
                  <p n="2">II. The due care of our Souls conſiſts in the frequent Examination of our lives and actions, and in a ſincere Repentance for all the errors and miſcarriages of them: In a more <hi>particular</hi> and deep hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miliation and repentance for deliberate and wilful ſins, ſo far as we can call them to our remembrance; and in a <hi>general</hi> repentance for ſins of <hi>Ignorance,</hi> and <hi>In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firmity,</hi> and <hi>Surprize.</hi> In the exerciſe whereof we are always to remember, that the nature of true Repentance doth not conſiſt only in an humble confeſſion of our ſins to God, and a hearty trouble and contrition for them; but chiefly in the ſtedfaſt purpoſe and reſolution of a better life, and in proſecution of this reſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lution, in actual reformation and amend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment.</p>

                     <pb n="130" facs="tcp:33693:70"/>By the conſtant exerciſe hereof, we are put into a ſafe condition; provided that we perſevere in this holy reſolution and courſe: But if we ſtill retain the love and practice of any known ſin, or if after we have taken up theſe good reſolutions we return again to an evil courſe; this is a clear evidence, either that our Repentance was not ſincere at firſt, or that we are re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>laps'd into our former ſtate: And then our Souls are ſtill in apparent danger of being loſt, and will continue in that dan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gerous ſtate, till we have renew'd our Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pentance and made it good in the follow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing courſe of our lives.</p>
                  <p n="3">III. The due care of our Souls conſiſts in the conſtant and daily exerciſe of piety and devotion, both in private, and in publick if there be opportunity for it, eſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pecially at proper times and upon more ſolemn occaſions: By fervent prayer to God, and by hearing and reading the Word of God with reverence and godly fear: By frequenting his publick Wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhip, and demeaning our ſelves in it with that ſolemnity and ſeriouſneſs which be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>comes the preſence and ſervice of the great and glorious Majeſty of God, who obſerves our behaviour and ſees into our hearts: And by receiving the B. Sacra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment,
<pb n="131" facs="tcp:33693:70"/>
as often as we have opportunity, with due preparation and devotion of mind.</p>
                  <p>For theſe are not only outward teſtimo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nies of our inward piety, but they are means likewiſe appointed by God to im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prove and confirm us in holineſs and goodneſs. And whoever neglects theſe Duties of Religion, or performs them in a flight and ſuperficial manner, doth plain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly ſhew that he hath neither a due ſenſe of God, nor care of himſelf: For in vain does any man pretend that he does in good earneſt deſign the End, when he ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>glects the beſt and moſt proper means for the attainment of it.</p>
                  <p n="4">IV. The due care of our Souls conſiſts alſo in avoiding thoſe things which are pernicious to our Salvation, and whereby men do often hazard their Souls. Such in general is the practice of any known Sin. By this we do, as it were, run up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on the ſwords point, and do endanger our Salvation as much as a deep wound in our Body would do our Life: And tho ſuch a wound may perhaps be cur'd af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terwards by Repentance, yet no man that commits any wilful Sin knows the diſmal conſequence of it, and whither by de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>grees it may carry him at laſt: For upon
<pb n="132" facs="tcp:33693:71"/>
ſuch a provocation God may leave the Sinner to himſelf, and withdraw his grace from him, and give him up to a hard and impenitent heart to proceed from evil to worſe, and from one wickedneſs to ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, till he be finally ruin'd. So dange<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rous a thing is it knowingly to offend God, and to commit any deliberate act of Sin.</p>
                  <p>More particularly, an inordinate love of the World is very pernicious to the Souls of men; becauſe it quencheth the heavenly life, and fills our minds with earthly cares and deſigns; it tempts men to forſake God and Religion when their worldly intereſts come in competition with them; and betrays them to fraud, and falſhood, and all kind of injuſtice, and <hi>many other hurtful luſts which drown the Soul in perdition.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>But beſides theſe dangers which are more viſible and apparent, there is ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther which is leſs diſcernible becauſe it hath the face of Piety; and that is <hi>Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction</hi> in Religion: By which I mean an unpeaceable and uncharitable zeal about things wherein Religion either doth not at all, or but very little conſiſt. For be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſides that this temper is utterly inconſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtent with ſeveral of the moſt eminent
<pb n="133" facs="tcp:33693:71"/>
                     <hi>Chriſtian</hi> Graces and Vertues, as <hi>humility, love, peace, meekneſs,</hi> and <hi>forbearance</hi> to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards thoſe that differ from us; it hath likewiſe <hi>two</hi> very great miſchiefs com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monly attending upon it, and both of them pernicious to Religion and the Souls of men.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Firſt,</hi> that it takes ſuch men off from minding the more neceſſary and eſſential parts of Religion They are ſo zealous about ſmall things, <hi>the tithing of mint and aniſe and cummin,</hi> that they <hi>neglect the weightier things of the Law, Faith</hi> and <hi>Mercy, and Judgment,</hi> and <hi>the Love</hi> of God: They ſpend ſo much of their time and heat about things doubtful, that they have no leiſure to mind the things that are neceſſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry: And are ſo concern'd about little <hi>Spe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culative Opinions</hi> in Religion, which they always call <hi>fundamental Articles</hi> of Faith, that the Practice of Religion is almoſt wholly neglected by them: And they are ſo taken up in ſpying out and cenſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring Error and Hereſy in others, that they never think of curing thoſe Luſts and Vices and Paſſions which do ſo viſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bly reign in themſelves. Deluded people! that do not conſider that the greateſt He<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reſy in the World is a wicked life, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe it is ſo directly and fundamentally
<pb n="134" facs="tcp:33693:72"/>
oppoſite to the whole deſign of the Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtian Faith and Religion: And that do not conſider, that God will ſooner forgive a man a hundred defects of his Under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtanding than one fault of his Will.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Secondly,</hi> Another great miſchef which attends this temper is, that men are very apt to interpret this zeal of theirs againſt others to be great Piety in themſelves, and as much as is neceſſary to bring them to Heaven; and to think that they are very Religious, becauſe they keep a great ſtir about maintaining the Out-works of Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion, when it is ready to be ſtarv'd with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in; and that there needs no more to deno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minate them good Chriſtians, but to be of ſuch a Party, and to be liſted of ſuch a Church, which they always take for granted to be the only true one; and then zealouſly to hate and uncharitably to cen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure all the reſt of Mankind.</p>
                  <p>How many are there in the World, that think they have made very ſure of Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven, not by the old plain way of leaving their ſins and reforming their lives, but by a more cloſe and cunning way of car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rying their Vices along with them into another Church, and calling themſelves <hi>good Cathliques,</hi> and all others <hi>Heretiques?</hi> And that having done this, they are in a
<pb n="135" facs="tcp:33693:72"/>
ſafe condition; as if a mere Name would admit a man into Heaven, or as if there were any Church in the World that had this phantaſtical Privilege belonging to it, that a wicked man might be ſaved for no other reaſon but becauſe he is of it.</p>
                  <p>Therefore, as thou valueſt thy Soul, take heed of engaging in any Faction in Religion; becauſe it is an hundred to one but thy zeal will be ſo employed about leſ<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ſer things, that the main and ſubſtantial parts of Religion will be neglected: Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſides, that a man deeply engag'd in heats and controverſies of this nature, ſhall ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry hardly eſcape being poſſeſs'd with that Spirit of uncharitableneſs and contention, of peeviſhneſs and fierceneſs, which reigns in all Factions, but more eſpeci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally in thoſe of Religion.</p>
                  <p n="5">V. The due care of our Souls conſiſts in the even and conſtant practice of the ſeveral Graces and Vertues of a good life; or, as the <hi>Apoſtle</hi> expreſſeth it, in <hi>exerci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing our ſelves always to have a conſcience void of offence towards God and men.</hi> For herein is Religion beſt ſeen, in the equal and uniform practice of every part of our Duty: Not only in ſerving God de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>voutly, but in demeaning our ſelves peaceably and juſtly, kindly and charita<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bly
<pb n="136" facs="tcp:33693:73"/>
towards all men: Not only in re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtraining our ſelves from the outward act of ſin, but in mortifying the inward in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clination to it, in ſubduing our Luſts, and governing our Paſſions, and bridling our Tongues. As he that would have a prudent care of his health and life, muſt not only guard himſelf againſt the chief and com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon diſeaſes which are incident to men, and take care to prevent them; but muſt likewiſe be careful to preſerve himſelf from thoſe which are eſteemed leſs dange<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rous, but yet ſometimes do prove mortal: He muſt not only endeavour to ſecure his Head and Heart from being wounded, but muſt have a tender care of every part; there being hardly any diſeaſe or wound ſo ſlight but that ſome have dyed of it: In like manner, the care of our Souls con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiſts in an univerſal regard to our Duty, and that we be defective in no part of it: Though we ought to have a more eſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cial regard to thoſe Duties which are more conſiderable and wherein Religion doth mainly conſiſt; as <hi>Piety</hi> towards God, <hi>Temperance</hi> and <hi>Chaſtity</hi> in regard of our ſelves, <hi>Charity</hi> towards the poor, <hi>Truth</hi> and <hi>Juſtice, Goodneſs</hi> and <hi>Kindneſs</hi> towards all men: But then no other <hi>Grace</hi> and <hi>Vertue,</hi> though of an infe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riour
<pb n="137" facs="tcp:33693:73"/>
rank, ought to be neglected by us.</p>
                  <p>And thus I have endeavour'd, as plain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly and briefly as I could, to declare to you in what Inſtances the due care of Reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gion and our Souls doth chiefly conſiſt.</p>
                  <p>And I would not have any man think that all this is an eaſy buſineſs and requires but little time to do it in, and that a ſmall degree of diligence and induſtry will ſerve for this purpoſe: To maſter and root out the inveterate Habits of Sin, to bring our Paſſions under the command and govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of our Reaſon, and to attain to a good degree of every Chriſtian Grace and Vertue: That <hi>Faith</hi> and <hi>Hope</hi> and <hi>Chari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty; Humility</hi> and <hi>Meekneſs</hi> and <hi>Patience,</hi> may all <hi>have their perfect work</hi>; and that, as <hi>St. James</hi> ſays, we <hi>may be perfect and en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tire, wanting nothing</hi>; nothing that be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>longs to the perfection of a good man, and of a good Chriſtian. And this, whenever we come to make the trial, we ſhall find to be a great and a long work.</p>
                  <p>Some indeed would make Religion to be a very ſhort and eaſy buſineſs, and to conſiſt only in believing what Chriſt hath done for us, and relying confidently upon it: Which is ſo far from being the true Notion of Chriſtian <hi>Faith,</hi> that, if I be not much miſtaken, it is the very Defi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nition
<pb n="138" facs="tcp:33693:74"/>
of <hi>Preſumption.</hi> For the <hi>Bible</hi> plainly teacheth us, that unleſs our Faith <hi>work by Charity,</hi> and <hi>purify our hearts</hi> and reform our lives; unleſs like <hi>Abraham</hi>'s Faith it be <hi>perfected by works,</hi> it is but a <hi>dead Faith,</hi> and will in no wiſe avail to our Juſtification and Salvation. And our <hi>B. Saviour,</hi> the great <hi>Author and finiſher of our Faith,</hi> hath no where, that I know of, ſaid one word to this purpoſe, That Faith ſeparated from obedience and a good life will ſave any man: But He hath ſaid very much to the contrary, and that very plainly. For he promiſeth Bleſſed<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs to none, but thoſe who live in the practice of thoſe Chriſtian Graces and Vertues which are particularly mention'd by Him in the beginning of his excellent <hi>Sermon</hi> upon the Mount;<note place="margin">Matth. 5.3, 4, <hi>&amp;c.</hi>
                     </note> of <hi>Humility,</hi> and <hi>Repentance,</hi> and <hi>Meekneſs,</hi> and <hi>Righ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teouſneſs,</hi> and <hi>Mercifulneſs,</hi> and <hi>Purity,</hi> and <hi>Peaceableneſs,</hi> and <hi>Patience</hi> under perſecution and ſufferings for Righteouſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs ſake. And afterwards in the ſame <hi>Sermon,</hi>
                     <note place="margin">Matth. 7.21.</note> 
                     <hi>Not every one,</hi> ſaith He, <hi>that ſaith unto me, Lord, Lord, ſhall enter into the Kingdom of heaven, but he that doth the Will of my Father which is in heaven.</hi> And again,<note place="margin">V. 24.</note> 
                     <hi>Whoſoever heareth theſe ſay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings of mine, and doth them, I will liken

                     <hi>happy are ye if ye do them.</hi> And he does very ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verely check the vain confidence and pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſumption of thoſe, who will needs rely upon Him for Salvation without keeping his commandments; <hi>Why call ye me,</hi>
                     <note place="margin">Luke 6.46.</note> ſays He, <hi>Lord, Lord, and do not the things which I ſay?</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Does any man think that he can be ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved without loving God and Chriſt? <hi>And this,</hi> ſaith <hi>St. John, is the love of God,</hi>

                     <note place="margin">John 14.15.</note> ſaith our <hi>B. Lord, keep my commandments:</hi> And a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gain,<note place="margin">V. 21.</note> 
                     <hi>He that hath my commandments and keepeth them, he it is that loveth me.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Does any man think, that any but the children of God ſhall be heirs of eternal

                  </p>
                  <p>In a word, this is the perpetual tenour of the <hi>Bible,</hi> from the beginning of it to the end.<note place="margin">Gen. 3.7. Iſa. 3.10, 11.</note>

                     <hi>keep the commandments.</hi> And in the very laſt <hi>Chapter</hi> of the <hi>Bible</hi> we find this ſolemn declaration, <hi>Bleſſed are they that do his commandments, that they may have right to the Tree of Life, and enter in through the Gates into the City,</hi> that is, into Heaven, which the <hi>Apoſtle</hi> to the <hi>Hebrews</hi> calls the <hi>City which hath foundations, whoſe builder and maker is God.</hi> So vain and groundleſs is the imagination
<pb n="141" facs="tcp:33693:75"/>
of thoſe, who truſt to be ſaved by an idle and ineffectual Faith, without holineſs and obedience of life.</p>
                  <p n="2">II. I proceed now in the <hi>Second</hi> place <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="II"/> to convince us all, if it may be, of the ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſity of minding Religion and our Souls. When we call any thing neceſſary, we mean that it is ſo in order to ſome End, which cannot be attained without it. We call thoſe things the neceſſaries of Life, without which men cannot ſubſiſt and live in a tolerable condition in this World: And that is neceſſary to our eternal happi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs, without which it cannot be attain'd. Now happineſs being our chief End, whatever is neceſſary to <hi>that</hi> is more ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſary than any thing elſe; and in com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pariſon of <hi>that,</hi> all other things not only may, but ought to be neglected by us.</p>
                  <p>Now to convince men of the neceſſity of Religion, I ſhall briefly ſhew, That it is a certain way to happineſs: That it is cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain that there is no other way but this: And that if we neglect Religion, we ſhall certainly be extremely and for ever miſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rable.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Firſt,</hi> That Religion is a certain way to happineſs. And for this we have God's ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſs Declaration and Promiſe, the beſt aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſurance that can be. He <hi>that cannot lye</hi> hath
<pb n="142" facs="tcp:33693:76"/>
promiſed <hi>eternal life, to them who by pati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ent continuance in well-doing ſeek for glory and honour and immortality</hi> All the happi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs that we can deſire, and of which the nature of man is capable is promiſed to us upon the terms of Religion, upon our <hi>de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nying ungodlineſs, and worldly luſts, and li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving ſoberly, and righteouſly and godlily in this preſent world:</hi> A mighty reward for a little ſervice; an eternity of happineſs, of joys unſpeakable and full of glory, for the diligence and induſtry of a few days: A happineſs large as our wiſhes, and laſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing as our Souls.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Secondly,</hi> 'Tis certain alſo that there is no other way to happineſs but this. He, who alone can make us happy, hath pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſed it to us upon theſe and no other terms He hath ſaid, That <hi>if we live after the fleſh, we ſhall die; but if by the ſpirit we mortify the deeds of the fleſh, we ſhall live:</hi> That <hi>without holineſs no man ſhall ſee the Lord:</hi> And, that he that lives in the ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bitual Practice of any Vice, of <hi>Covetouſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs,</hi> or <hi>Adultery,</hi> or <hi>Malice,</hi> or <hi>Revenge, ſhall not enter into the kingdom of God:</hi> And we have reaſon to believe Him con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerning the terms of this happineſs, and the means of attaining it, by whoſe fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vour and bounty alone we hope to be made partakers of it.</p>
                  <p>
                     <pb n="143" facs="tcp:33693:76"/>And if God had not ſaid it in his Word, yet the nature and reaſon of the thing doth plainly declare it. For Religion is not only a condition of our happineſs, but a neceſſary qualification and diſpoſiti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on for it. We muſt be like to God in the temper of our minds, before we can find any felicity in the enjoyment of him. Men muſt be purged from their Luſts, and from thoſe ill-natur'd and deviliſh Paſſions of <hi>Malice,</hi> and <hi>Envy,</hi> and <hi>Revenge,</hi> before they can be fit company for their heaven<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly Father, and meet to dwell with <hi>him who is love, and dwells in love.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Thirdly,</hi> If we neglect Religion, we ſhall certainly be extreamly and for ever miſerable. The <hi>Word of Truth</hi> hath ſaid it, that <hi>indignation and wrath, tribulation and anguiſh ſhall be upon every ſoul of man that doth evil.</hi> Nay, if God ſhould hold his hand, and ſhould inflict no poſitive tor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment upon ſinners, yet they could not ſpare themſelves, but would be their own Executioners and Tormentors. The guilt of that wicked Life which they had led in this World, and the Stings of their own Conſciences muſt neceſſarily make them miſerable, whenever their own Thoughts are let looſe upon them; as they will cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainly be in the other World, when they
<pb n="144" facs="tcp:33693:77"/>
ſhall have nothing either of pleaſure or buſineſs to divert them.</p>
                  <p>So that if we be concern'd, either to be happy hereafter, or to avoid thoſe Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeries which are great and dreadful be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>yond all imagination, it will be neceſſary for us to mind Religion; without which we can neither attain that Happineſs, nor eſcape thoſe Miſeries.</p>
                  <p>All that now remains, is to perſwade you and my ſelf ſeriouſly to mind this <hi>one thing</hi> neceſſary. And to this end, I ſhall apply my Diſcourſe to two ſorts of Perſons; thoſe who are remiſs in a matter of ſo great concernment, and thoſe who are groſly careleſs, and mind it not at all.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Firſt,</hi> To thoſe who are remiſs in a matter of ſuch vaſt concernment: Who mind the buſineſs of Religion in ſome de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gree, but not ſo heartily and vigorouſly as a matter of ſuch infinite conſequence doth require and deſerve.</p>
                  <p>And here I fear the very beſt are great<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly defective; and ſo much the more to be blamed, by how much they are more convinc'd than others, of the neceſſity of a Religious and Holy Life, and that without this no man ſhall ever be admit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted into the Manſions of the Bleſſed: They believe likewiſe, that according to
<pb n="145" facs="tcp:33693:77"/>
the degrees of every mans holineſs and vertue in this Life, will be the degrees of his happineſs in the other; that <hi>he that ſows ſparingly ſhall reap ſparingly, and he that ſows plentifully ſhall reap plentifully</hi>; and that the meaſure of every man's reward ſhall be according to his improve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of the Talents that were commit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted to him.</p>
                  <p>But how little do men live under the power of theſe convictions? And not<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>withſtanding we are allur'd by the moſt glorious promiſes and hopes, and aw'd by the greateſt fears, and urg'd by the moſt forcible argument in the world, the evi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent neceſſity of the thing; Yet how faintly do we run the Race that is ſet be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore us? How frequently and how eaſily are we ſtop'd or diverted in our Chriſtian courſe by very little temptations? How cold, and how careleſs, and how incon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtant are we in the Exerciſes of Piety, and how defective in every part of our Du<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty? Did we act reaſonably, and as Men uſe to do in matters of much leſs moment, we could not be ſo indifferent about a thing ſo neceſſary, ſo ſlight and careleſs in a matter of Life and Death, and upon which all Eternity does depend.</p>
                  <p>Let us then ſhake off this ſloth and ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>curity,
<pb n="146" facs="tcp:33693:78"/>
and reſolve to make that the great buſineſs of Time, which is our great con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cernment to all Eternity: And when we are immers'd in the cares and buſineſs of this Life, and <hi>troubled about many things,</hi> let this thought often come into our minds, That there is <hi>one thing needful,</hi> and which therefore deſerves above all other things to be regarded by us.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Secondly,</hi> There are another ſort of per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons, who are groſly careleſs of this <hi>one thing neceſſary,</hi> and do not ſeem to mind it at all: Who go on ſecurely in an evil courſe, as if either they had no Souls, or no concernment for them. I may ſay to theſe as the Maſter of the Ship did to <hi>Jo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nah,</hi> when he was faſt aſleep in the Storm, <hi>What meaneſt thou, O ſleeper? Ariſe and call upon thy God.</hi> When our Souls are every moment in danger of ſinking, it is high time for us to awake out of ſleep, to ply every Oar, and to uſe all poſſible care and induſtry to ſave a thing ſo pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cious from a danger ſo threatning and ſo terrible.</p>
                  <p>We are apt enough to be ſenſible of the force of this Argument of neceſſity in other caſes, and very carefully to provide againſt the preſſing neceſſities of this life, and how to avoid thoſe great temporal
<pb n="147" facs="tcp:33693:78"/>
evils of poverty and diſgrace, of pain and ſuffering: But the great neceſſity of all, and that which is mainly incumbent up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on us, is to provide for Eternity, to ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cure the everlaſting happineſs, and to prevent the endleſs and inſupportable miſeries of another World. <hi>This, this,</hi> is the <hi>one thing neceſſary</hi>; and to <hi>this</hi> we ought to bend and apply all our care and endeavours.</p>
                  <p>If we would fairly compare the neceſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſity of things, and wiſely weigh the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cernments of this Life and the other in a juſt and equal balance, we ſhould be aſha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med to miſplace our diligence and indu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtry as we do; to beſtow our beſt thoughts and time about theſe vain and periſhing things, and to take no care about that <hi>bet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter part which cannot be taken from us.</hi> Fond and vain men that we are! who are ſo ſolicitous how we ſhall paſs a few days in this world, but matter not what ſhall become of us for ever.</p>
                  <p>But as careleſs as we are now about theſe things, time will come when we ſhall ſadly lay them to heart, and when they will touch us to the quick: When we come to lie upon a Death-bed, if God ſhall be pleas'd to grant us then ſo much time and uſe of our Reaſon as to be able
<pb n="148" facs="tcp:33693:79"/>
to recollect our ſelves, we ſhall then be convinc'd how great a neceſſity there was of minding our Souls, and of the prodi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gious folly of neglecting them, and of our not being ſenſible of the value of them, till we are ready to deſpair of ſaving them.</p>
                  <p>But, bleſſed be God, this is not yet our caſe, though we know not how ſoon it may be. Let us then be wiſe, and conſider theſe things in time, leſt Death and De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpair ſhould overtake and oppreſs us at once.</p>
                  <p>You that are young, be pleas'd to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſider that this is the beſt opportunity of your Lives, for the minding and doing of this work. You are now moſt capable of the beſt impreſſions, before the habits of Vice have taken deep root, and your hearts <hi>be harden'd through the deceitfulneſs of ſin:</hi> This <hi>is the acceptable time, this is the day of ſalvation.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>And there is likewiſe a very weighty conſideration to be urg'd upon thoſe that are old, if there be any that are willing to own themſelves ſo; that this is the laſt opportunity of their lives, and therefore they ſhould lay hold of it, and improve it with all their might: For it will ſoon be paſt, and when it is, nothing can call it back.</p>
                  <p>
                     <pb n="149" facs="tcp:33693:79"/>It is but a very little while before we ſhall all certainly be of this mind, that the beſt thing we could have done in this World, was to prepare for the other. Could I repreſent to you that inviſible World which I am ſpeaking of, you would all readily aſſent to this counſel, and would be glad to follow it and put it ſpeedily in practice. Do but then open your eyes, and look a little before you to the things which are not far off from any of us, and to many of us may perhaps be much nearer than we are aware: Let us but judge of things now, as we ſhall all ſhortly judge of them: And let us live now, as after a few days we ſhall every one of us wiſh with all our Souls that we had liv'd; and be as ſerious, as if we were ready to ſtep into the other World, and to enter upon that change which Death will quickly make in every one of us. Strange ſtupidity of Men! That a change ſo near, ſo great, ſo certain, ſhould affect us ſo coldly, and be ſo little conſider'd and provided for by us: That the things of Time ſhould move us ſo much, and the things of Eternity ſo little. What will we do when this change comes, if we have made no preparation for it?</p>
                  <p>If we be Chriſtians, and do verily be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve
<pb n="150" facs="tcp:33693:80"/>
the things which I am ſpeaking of, and that after a few days more are paſs'd Death will come, and draw aſide that thick Veil of ſenſe and ſecurity which now hides theſe things from us; and ſhew us that fearful and amazing ſight which we are now ſo loth to think upon: I ſay, if we believe this, it is time for us to be wiſe and ſerious.</p>
                  <p>And happy that man, who in the days of his health hath retir'd himſelf from the noiſe and tumult of this world, and made that careful preparation for Death and a better Life, as may give him that conſtan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy and firmneſs of Spirit, as to be able to bear the thoughts and approaches of his great Change without amazement; and to have a mind almoſt equally poiz'd be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween that ſtrong inclination of Nature which makes us deſirous to live, and that wiſer dictate of Reaſon and Religion which ſhould make us willing and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tented to die whenever God thinks fit.</p>
                  <p>Many of us do not now ſo clearly diſcern theſe things, becauſe our eyes are dazzel'd with the falſe light and ſplendor of earthly felicity: But <hi>this</hi> aſſuredly is more worth than all <hi>the Kingdoms of the World and the Glory of them,</hi> to be able to poſſeſs our Souls at ſuch a time, and
<pb n="151" facs="tcp:33693:80"/>
to be at perfect Peace with our own minds, having <hi>our hearts fixed truſting in God:</hi> To have our Accounts made up, and Eſtate of our immortal Souls as well ſettled and ſecur'd, as by the aſſiſtance of God's Grace humane care and endeavour, though mix'd with much humane frailty, is able to do.</p>
                  <p>And if we be convinc'd of theſe things, we are utterly inexcuſable if we do not make this our firſt and great care, and prefer it to all other intereſts whatſoever. And to this end; we ſhould reſolutely diſentangle our ſelves from worldly cares and incumbrances; at leaſt ſo far, that we may have competent liberty and lei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure to attend this great concernment, and to put our Souls into a fit poſture and preparation for another World: That when Sickneſs and Death ſhall come, we may not act our laſt part indecently and confuſedly, and have a great deal of work to do when we ſhall want both time and all other advantages to do it in: Whereby our Souls, when they will ſtand moſt in need of comfort and ſupport, will un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>avoidably be left in a trembling and diſconſolate condition, and in an anxious doubtfulneſs of mind what will become of them for ever.</p>
                  <p>
                     <pb n="152" facs="tcp:33693:81"/>To conclude, This care of Religion and our Souls is a thing ſo neceſſary, that in compariſon of it we are to neglect the very neceſſaries of Life. So our <hi>Lord</hi> teacheth us.<note place="margin">Matth. 6.31, 33.</note> 
                     <hi>Take no thought ſaying, what ſhall we eat? or what ſhall we drink? or wherewithal ſhall we be cloathed? But ſeek ye firſt the Kingdom of God and his righ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teouſneſs.</hi> The Calls of God and Religion are ſo very preſſing and importunate, that they admit of no delay or excuſe whatſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever: This our <hi>Saviour</hi> ſignifies to us by denying the <hi>Diſciple,</hi> whom he had call'd to follow <hi>him,</hi> leave to go and bury his Father, <hi>Let the dead,</hi> ſays he, <hi>bury their dead, but do thou follow me.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>There is <hi>one thing needful,</hi> and that is the buſineſs of Religion and the care of our immortal Souls, which whatever elſe we neglect ſhould be carefully minded and regarded by every one of us. <hi>O that there were ſuch a heart in us.

                  <p>AMong all the arguments to Repen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance and a good Life, thoſe have the greateſt force and power upon the minds of men, which are fetch'd from another World; and from the final ſtate of good and bad men after this Life. And this our <hi>Saviour</hi> repreſents to us in a moſt lively manner, in that proſpect which, in the latter part of this <hi>Chapter,</hi> he gives us of the <hi>Judgment</hi> of the <hi>great Day,</hi> name<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, that at the end of the World the <hi>Son of Man ſhall come in his glory, with his Holy Angels, and ſhall ſit upon the Throne of his Glory; and all Nations ſhall be gathered be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
<pb n="154" facs="tcp:33693:83"/>
him,</hi> and ſhall be ſeparated into two great Companies, the <hi>Righteous</hi> and the <hi>Wicked</hi>; who ſhall ſtand the one on the Right hand, and the other on the Left of this great Judge; who ſhall pronounce ſentence ſeverally upon them according to the actions which they have done in this Life: The Righteous ſhall be re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>warded with eternal happineſs, and the Wicked ſhall be ſentenc'd to everlaſting puniſhment. <hi>And theſe,</hi> that is, <hi>the Wick<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, ſhall go away into everlaſting puniſhment, but the Righteous into Life eternal.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>The <hi>Words</hi> are plain and need no ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plication. For I take it for granted, that every one, at firſt hearing of them, does clearly apprehend the difference between the <hi>Righteous</hi> and the <hi>Wicked,</hi> and be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween endleſs Happineſs and Miſery: But although theſe <hi>Words</hi> be ſo very eaſy to be underſtood, they can never be too much conſider'd by us. The Scope and deſign of them is, to repreſent to us the different Fates of good and bad men in another World, and that their Ends <hi>there,</hi> will be as different, as their Ways and doings have been <hi>here</hi> in this World: The ſerious conſideration whereof is the greateſt diſcouragement to Sin, and the moſt powerful argument in the World to
<pb n="155" facs="tcp:33693:83"/>
a holy and vertuous life: Becauſe it is an argument taken from our greateſt and moſt laſting intereſt, our happineſs or our miſery to all Eternity: A concernment of that vaſt conſequence, that it muſt be the greateſt ſtupidity and folly in the World for any man to neglect it.</p>
                  <p>This eternal ſtate of Rewards and Pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſhments in another World, our <hi>Bleſſed Saviour</hi> hath clearly revealed to us. And as to one part of it, <hi>viz.</hi> That good men ſhall be eternally happy in another World, every one gladly admits it: But many are loth that the other part ſhould be true, concerning the eternal puniſhment of wicked men. And therefore they pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tend that it is contrary to the Juſtice of God to puniſh temporary Crimes with eternal Torments: Becauſe Juſtice al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ways obſerves a proportion between Of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fences and Puniſhments: but between temporary Sins and eternal Puniſhments there is no proportion. And as this ſeems hard to be reconcil'd with Juſtice, ſo much more with that exceſs of Goodneſs which we ſuppoſe to be in God.</p>
                  <p>And therefore they ſay, that though God ſeem to have declar'd that impeni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tent Sinners ſhall be everlaſtingly pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſh'd, yet theſe declarations of Scripture
<pb n="156" facs="tcp:33693:84"/>
are ſo to be mollified and underſtood, as that we may be able to reconcile them with the eſſential perfections of the Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vine nature.</p>
                  <p>This is the full force and ſtrength of the Objection. And my work at this time ſhall be to clear, if I can, this difficult Point. And that for theſe two Reaſons. <hi>Firſt,</hi> For the vindication of the Divine Juſtice and Goodneſs: <hi>That God may be juſtified in his ſayings, and</hi> appear <hi>Righ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teous when he judgeth.</hi> And <hi>Secondly,</hi> be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe the belief of the threatnings of God in their utmoſt extent is of ſo great moment to a good Life, and ſo great a diſcouragement to Sin: For the ſting of Sin is the terrour of eternal puniſhment; and if men were once ſet free from the fear and belief of this, the moſt powerful reſtraint from Sin would be taken away.</p>
                  <p>So that in anſwer to this Objection, I ſhall endeavour to prove theſe two things.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Firſt,</hi> That the eternal puniſhment of wicked men in another World is plainly threatned in Scripture.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Secondly,</hi> That this is not inconſiſtent either with the Juſtice or the Goodneſs of God.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Firſt,</hi> That the eternal puniſhment of wicked men in another World is plainly
<pb n="157" facs="tcp:33693:84"/>
threatned in Scripture, namely, in theſe following <hi>Texts, Matth.</hi> 18.8. <hi>It is bet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter for thee to enter into Life halt and maim<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, than having two hands or two feet to be caſt into everlaſting fire.</hi> And <hi>Matth.</hi> 25.41. <hi>Depart ye curſed into everlaſting fire, pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pared for the Devil and his Angels.</hi> And here in the <hi>Text, theſe,</hi> that is, <hi>the wicked, ſhall go away into everlaſting puniſhment.</hi> And <hi>Mark</hi> 9. It is there three ſeveral times with great vehemency repeated by our <hi>Saviour, where their worm dyeth not, and the fire is not quenched.</hi> And 2 <hi>Theſ.</hi> 1.9. ſpeaking of <hi>them that know not God and obey not the Goſpel of his Son,</hi> it is ſaid of them, <hi>who ſhall be puniſh'd with everlaſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing deſtruction.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>I know very well that great endeavour hath been us'd to avoid the force of theſe <hi>Texts,</hi> by ſhewing that the words, <hi>for ever</hi> and <hi>everlaſting,</hi> are frequently us'd in Scripture in a more limited ſenſe, only for a long duration and continuance. Thus, <hi>for ever,</hi> doth very often in the <hi>Old Teſtament</hi> only ſignify for a long time and till the end of the <hi>Jewiſh</hi> Diſpenſation. And in the <hi>Epiſtle</hi> of St. <hi>Jude, verſe</hi> 7th. The Cities of <hi>Sodom</hi> and <hi>Gomorrah</hi> are ſaid to be <hi>ſet forth for an example, ſuffer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the vengeance of eternal fire,</hi> that is,
<pb n="158" facs="tcp:33693:85"/>
of a fire that was not extinguiſh'd till thoſe Cities were utterly conſumed.</p>
                  <p>And therefore to clear the meaning of the forementioned <hi>Texts. Firſt,</hi> I ſhall readily grant, that the words, <hi>for ever</hi> and <hi>everlaſting,</hi> do not always in Scri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pture ſignify an endleſs duration; and that this is ſufficiently proved by the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtances alledg'd to this purpoſe. But then, <hi>Secondly,</hi> it cannot be denied on the other hand, that theſe words are often in Scri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pture uſed in a larger ſenſe and ſo as ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſarily to ſignify an interminable and endleſs duration. As where Eternity is attributed to God, and he is ſaid to <hi>live for ever and ever</hi>: And where eternal happineſs in another World is promiſed to good men, and that <hi>they ſhall be for ever with the Lord.</hi> Now the very ſame words and expreſſions are uſed concerning the puniſhment of wicked men in another life, and there is great reaſon why we ſhould underſtand them in the ſame ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tent: Both, becauſe if God had intended to have told us that the puniſhment of wicked men ſhall have no end, the Lan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guages wherein the Scriptures are writ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten do hardly afford fuller and more cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain words, than thoſe that are uſed in this caſe, whereby to expreſs to us a du<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration
<pb n="159" facs="tcp:33693:85"/>
without end: And likewiſe, which is almoſt a peremptory deciſion of the thing, becauſe the duration of the puniſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of wicked men is in the very ſame ſentence expreſs'd by the very ſame word which is us'd for the duration of the hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pineſs of the righteous: As is evident from the <hi>Text, Theſe,</hi> ſpeaking of the wicked, <hi>ſhall go away, <gap reason="foreign">
                           <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                        </gap>, into eternal puniſhment, but the righteous, <gap reason="foreign">
                           <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                        </gap>, into life eternal.</hi> I pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceed to the</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Second</hi> thing I propos'd; namely, to <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="II"/> ſhew that this is not inconſiſtent either with the Juſtice or the Goodneſs of God. For in this the force of the Objection lies. And it hath been attempted to be anſwer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed ſeveral ways, none of which ſeems to me to give clear and full ſatisfaction to it.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Firſt,</hi> It is ſaid by ſome, that becauſe ſin is infinite in reſpect of the Object againſt whom it is committed, which is God, therefore it deſerves an infinite puniſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment.</p>
                  <p>But this I doubt will upon examination be found to have more of ſubtlety than of ſolidity in it. 'Tis true indeed, that the dignity of the Perſon againſt whom any offence is committed is a great aggravati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of the fault. For which reaſon all of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fences
<pb n="160" facs="tcp:33693:86"/>
againſt God are certainly the greateſt of all other. But that crimes ſhould hereby be heighten'd to an infinite degree can by no means be admitted; and that for this plain reaſon; becauſe then the evil and demerit of all ſins muſt neceſſarily be equal; for the demerit of no ſin can be more than infinite: And if the demerit of all ſins be equal, there can then be no reaſon for the degrees of pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſhment in another World: But to deny that there are degrees of puniſhment there, is not only contrary to reaſon, but to our <hi>Saviour</hi>'s expreſs aſſertion, that ſome ſhall be <hi>beaten with many ſtripes</hi> and ſome with <hi>fewer,</hi> and that it ſhall be <hi>more tolerable for ſome in the day of judgment</hi> than for others. Beſides, that by the ſame reaſon that the leaſt ſin that is committed againſt God may be ſaid to be infinite be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe of its object, the leaſt puniſhment that is inflicted by God may be ſaid to be infinite becauſe of its Author; and then all puniſhments from God as well as all ſins againſt him would be equal; which is palpably abſurd. So that this anſwer is by no means ſufficient to break the force of this Objection.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Secondly,</hi> It is ſaid by others, that if wicked men lived for ever in this World
<pb n="161" facs="tcp:33693:86"/>
they would ſin for ever, and therefore they deſerve to be puniſh'd for ever. But this hath neither truth nor reaſon enough in it to give ſatisfaction. For who can cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainly tell that if a man lived never ſo long he would never repent and grow better?</p>
                  <p>Beſides, that the Juſtice of God doth only puniſh the ſins which men have committed in this life, and not thoſe which they might poſſibly have commit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted if they had lived longer.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Thirdly,</hi> It is ſaid in the laſt place, that God hath ſet before men everlaſting Hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pineſs and Miſery, and the ſinner hath his choice. Here are two things ſaid which ſeem to bid fairly towards an anſwer.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Firſt,</hi> That the reward which God pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſeth to our obedience is equal to the pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſhment which he threatens to our diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>obedience. But yet this I doubt will not reach the buſineſs: Becauſe though it be not contrary to Juſtice to exceed in Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards, that being matter of meer favour; yet it may be ſo, to exceed in Puniſhments.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Secondly,</hi> It is further ſaid, that the ſin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner in this caſe hath nothing to complain of, ſince he hath his own choice. This I confeſs is enough to ſilence the ſinner, and to make him to acknowledge that his deſtruction is of himſelf; but yet for
<pb n="162" facs="tcp:33693:87"/>
all that, it does not ſeem ſo clearly to ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tisfy the objection from the diſproportion between the fault and the puniſhment.</p>
                  <p>And therefore I ſhall endeavour to clear, if it may be, this matter yet a little further by theſe following Conſiderations.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Firſt,</hi> Let it be conſider'd, that the mea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure of Penalties with reſpect to Crimes is not only, nor always, to be taken from the quality and degree of the offence, much leſs from the duration and conti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nuance of it, but from the ends and rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons of Government; which require ſuch penalties as may, if it be poſſible, ſecure the obſervation of the Law, and deterr men from the breach of it. And the rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon of this is evident, becauſe if it were once declar'd that no man ſhould ſuffer longer for any Crime than according to the proportion of the time in which it was committed, the conſequence of this would be that ſinners would be better husbands of their time and ſin ſo much the faſter, that they might have the greater bargain of it, and might ſatisfy for their ſins by a ſhorter puniſhment.</p>
                  <p>And it would be unreaſonable likewiſe upon another account; becauſe ſome of the greateſt ſins may perhaps be commit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted in the ſhorteſt time; for inſtance,
<pb n="163" facs="tcp:33693:87"/>
                     <hi>Murther</hi>; the act whereof may be over in a moment, but the effects of it are per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>petual. For he that kills a man once kills him for ever. The act of Murther may be committed in a trice, but the injury is endleſs and irreparable. So that this ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jection of temporary Crimes being pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſh'd with ſo much longer ſufferings is plainly of no force.</p>
                  <p>Beſides, that whoever conſiders how ineffectual the threatning even of eternal torments is to the greateſt part of ſinners, will ſoon be ſatisfy'd that a leſs penalty than that of eternal ſufferings would to the far greateſt part of mankind have been in all probability of little or no force. And therefore if any thing more terrible than eternal vengeance could have been threatned to the workers of iniquity, it had not been unreaſonable, becauſe it would all have been little enough to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terr men effectually from ſin.</p>
                  <p>So that what proportion Crimes and Penalties ought to bear to each other, is not ſo properly a conſideration of Ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtice, as of Wiſdom and Prudence in the Lawgiver.</p>
                  <p>And the reaſon of this ſeems very plain, becauſe the meaſure of Penalties is not taken from any ſtrict proportion
<pb n="164" facs="tcp:33693:88"/>
betwixt Crimes and Puniſhments; but from one great end and deſign of Govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, which is to ſecure the obſervation of wholeſome and neceſſary Laws; and conſequently whatever Penalties are pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per and neceſſary to this end are not un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>juſt.</p>
                  <p>And this Conſideration I deſire may be more eſpecially obſerved, becauſe it ſtrikes at the very foundation of the objection. For if the appointing and apportioning of Penalties to Crimes be not ſo properly a conſideration of Juſtice, but rather of Prudence in the Lawgiver; then what<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever the diſproportion may be between temporary Sins and eternal ſufferings Ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtice cannot be ſaid to be concern'd in it.</p>
                  <p>Juſtice indeed is concern'd, that the Righteous and the Wicked ſhould not be treated alike; and farther yet, that great<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er ſins ſhould have a heavier puniſhment, and that <hi>mighty ſinners ſhould be mightily tormented</hi>; but all this may be conſider'd and adjuſted in the degree and the intenſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs of the ſuffering, without making any difference in the duration of it.</p>
                  <p>The caſe then in ſhort ſtands thus. Whenever we break the Laws of God we fall into his hands and lye at his mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy, and he may without injuſtice inflict
<pb n="165" facs="tcp:33693:88"/>
what puniſhment upon us he pleaſeth: And conſequently, to ſecure his Law from violation, he may beforehand threaten what penalties he thinks fit and neceſſary to deterr men from the Tranſgreſſion of it. And this is not eſteemed unjuſt among men, to puniſh Crimes that are commit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted in an inſtant with the perpetual loſs of Eſtate, or Liberty, or Life.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Secondly,</hi> This will yet appear more reaſonable when we conſider, that after all he that threatens hath ſtill the power of execution in his own hands. For there is this remarkable difference between Promiſes and Threatnings, that he who promiſeth paſſeth over a right to another, and thereby ſtands obliged to him in Ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtice and Faithfulneſs to make good his promiſe; and if he do not, the party to whom the promiſe is made is not only diſappointed but injuriouſly dealt withal: But in threatnings it is quite otherwiſe. He that threatens keeps the right of pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſhing in his own hand and is not obli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ged to execute what he hath threatned any further than the reaſons and ends of Government do require: And he may without any injury to the party threat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned remit and abate as much as he pleaſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth of the puniſhment that he hath threat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned:
<pb n="166" facs="tcp:33693:89"/>
And becauſe in ſo doing he is not worſe but better than his word, no body can find fault, or complain of any wrong or injuſtice thereby done to him.</p>
                  <p>Nor is this any impeachment of God's truth and faithfulneſs, any more than it is eſteem'd among men a piece of falſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hood not to do what they have threatned. God did abſolutely threaten the deſtru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction of the City of <hi>Niniveh,</hi> and his peeviſh <hi>Prophet</hi> did underſtand the threat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning to be abſolute, and was very angry with God for employing him in a meſſage that was not made good. But God under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtood his own right, and did what he pleas'd notwithſtanding the threatning he had denounc'd, and for all <hi>Jonah</hi> was ſo touch'd in honour that he had rather have dyed himſelf than that <hi>Niniveh</hi> ſhould not have been deſtroy'd, only to have verifi'd his meſſage.</p>
                  <p>I know it is ſaid in this caſe, that God hath confirm'd theſe threatnings by an Oath, which is a certain ſign of the im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mutability of his counſel; and therefore his Truth is concern'd in the ſtrict and ri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gorous execution of them. The Land of <hi>Canaan</hi> was a Type of Heaven, and the <hi>Iſraelites</hi> who rebell'd in the Wilderneſs were alſo a Type of impenitent Sinners
<pb n="167" facs="tcp:33693:89"/>
under the Goſpel; and conſequently the Oath of God concerning the rebellious <hi>Iſraelites,</hi> when <hi>he ſware in his wrath that they ſhould not enter into his reſt,</hi> that is, into the Land of <hi>Canaan,</hi> doth equally oblige Him to execute his threatning up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on all impenitent Sinners under the Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpel, that <hi>they ſhall never enter into the Kingdom of God.</hi> And this is very truly reaſon'd, ſo far as the threatning extends; which if we attend to the plain words of it, beyond which threatnings are never to be ſtretch'd, doth not ſeem to reach any further than to the excluſion of impeni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tent Sinners out of Heaven and their fal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling finally ſhort of the Reſt and Happi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs of the Righteous: Which however, directly overthrows the Opinion aſcrib'd to <hi>Origen</hi> that the Devils and wicked men ſhall all be ſaved at laſt; God having <hi>ſworn in his wrath that they ſhall never en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter into his reſt.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>But then, as to the eternal miſery and puniſhment threatned to wicked men in the other World, though it be not neceſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſarily comprehended in this Oath that they <hi>ſhall not enter into his Reſt</hi>: yet we are to conſider, that both the tenour of the <hi>Sentence</hi> which our Bleſſed <hi>Saviour</hi> hath aſſur'd us will be paſs'd upon them
<pb n="168" facs="tcp:33693:90"/>
at the Judgment of the Great Day, <hi>De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>part ye curſed into everlaſting fire</hi>; and likewiſe this Declaration in the Text, that <hi>the Wicked ſhall go away into everlaſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing puniſhment,</hi> though they do not re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrain God from doing what he pleaſes, yet they cut off from the Sinner all rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſonable hopes of the relaxation or mitiga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of them. For ſince the great Judge of the World hath made ſo plain and ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſs a Declaration, and will certainly paſs ſuch a Sentence, it would be the great<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eſt folly and madneſs in the world for the Sinner to entertain any hope of eſcaping it, and to venture his ſoul upon that hope.</p>
                  <p>I know but one thing more, commonly ſaid upon this Argument, that ſeems ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terial. And that is this, That the words <hi>death</hi> and <hi>deſtruction</hi> and <hi>periſhing,</hi> where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by the puniſhment of wicked men in the other World is moſt frequently expreſs'd in <hi>Scripture,</hi> do moſt properly import <hi>an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nihilation</hi> and an utter end of Being; and therefore may reaſonably be ſo under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtood in the matter of which we are now ſpeaking.</p>
                  <p>To this I anſwer, that theſe words, and thoſe which anſwer them in other Languages, are often, both in <hi>Scripture</hi> and other <hi>Authors,</hi> uſed to ſignify a ſtate
<pb n="169" facs="tcp:33693:90"/>
of great miſery and ſuffering, without the utter extinction of the miſerable. Thus God is often in <hi>Scripture</hi> ſaid to bring <hi>deſtruction</hi> upon a Nation when he ſends great Judgments upon them, though they do not exterminate and make an utter end of them.</p>
                  <p>And nothing is more common in moſt Languages, than by <hi>periſhing</hi> to expreſs a perſon's being undone and made very miſerable. As in that known paſſage in <hi>Tiberius</hi> his Letter to the <hi>Roman</hi> Senate, <note n="*" place="margin">
                        <hi>Ita me Dij Deae<expan>
                              <am>
                                 <g ref="char:abque"/>
                              </am>
                              <ex>que</ex>
                           </expan> omnes pejus perdant quàm bodiè perire me ſentio,</hi> &amp;c.</note> 
                     <hi>Let all the Gods and Goddeſſes,</hi> ſaith he, deſtroy <hi>me worſe than at this very time I feel my ſelf to</hi> periſh, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> in which Say<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, the words, <hi>deſtroy</hi> and <hi>periſh,</hi> are both of them us'd to expreſs the miſerable an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guiſh and torment which at that time he felt in his mind, as <hi>Tacitus</hi> tells us at large.</p>
                  <p>And as for the word <hi>Death</hi>; a ſtate of miſery which is as bad or worſe than death may properly enough be call'd by that name: And for this reaſon the pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſhment of wicked men after the Day of Judgment is in the Book of the <hi>Revelati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on</hi> ſo frequently and fitly call'd <hi>the ſecond death.</hi> And <hi>the Lake of fire,</hi> into which the wicked <hi>ſhall be caſt</hi> to be tormented in it, is expreſly call'd <hi>the ſecond death.</hi>
                     <note place="margin">Rev. 20.14.</note>
                  </p>
                  <p>But beſides this, they that argue from
<pb n="170" facs="tcp:33693:91"/>
the force of theſe words, that the puniſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of wicked men in the other world ſhall be nothing elſe but an utter end of their Being, do neceſſarily fall into two great inconveniencies.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Firſt,</hi> That hereby they exclude all po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſitive puniſhment and torment of Sinners. For if <hi>the ſecond death,</hi> and to be <hi>deſtroy'd,</hi> and to <hi>periſh,</hi> ſignify nothing elſe but the <hi>Annihilation</hi> of Sinners and an utter extin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction of their Being; and if this be all the effect of that dreadful <hi>Sentence</hi> which ſhall be paſs'd upon them at the <hi>Day of Judgment,</hi> then the <hi>Fire of Hell</hi> is quench'd all at once, and is only a frightful <hi>Meta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phor</hi> without any meaning. But this is di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rectly contrary to the tenour of <hi>Scripture,</hi> which doth ſo often deſcribe the puniſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of wicked men in Hell by poſitive torments: And particularly our Bleſſed <hi>Saviour,</hi> deſcribing the lamentable ſtate of the damned in Hell, expreſly ſays that <hi>there ſhall be weeping and wailing and gnaſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of teeth</hi>; which cannot be, if Anni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hilation be all the meaning and effect of the Sentence of the Great Day.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Secondly,</hi> Another inconvenience of this Opinion is, that if <hi>Annihilation</hi> be all the puniſhment of Sinners in the other World, then the puniſhment of all Sinners muſt
<pb n="171" facs="tcp:33693:91"/>
of neceſſity be equal, becauſe there are no degrees of <hi>Annihilation</hi> or <hi>not-being.</hi> But this alſo is moſt directly contrary to <hi>Scripture,</hi> as I have already ſhewn.</p>
                  <p>I know very well that ſome who are of this Opinion do allow a very long and te<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dious time of the moſt terrible and into<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lerable torment of Sinners, and after that they believe that there ſhall be an utter end of their Being.</p>
                  <p>But then they muſt not argue this from the force of the Words before mentioned, becauſe the plain inference from thence is, that Annihilation is all the puniſhment that wicked men ſhall undergo in the next Life; And if that be not true, as I have plainly ſhewn that it is not, I do not ſee from what other words or expreſſions in <hi>Scripture</hi> they can find the leaſt ground for this Opinion, that the torment of wicked men ſhall at laſt end in their <hi>An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nihilation.</hi> And yet admitting all this, for which I think there is no ground at all in <hi>Scripture,</hi> I cannot ſee what great com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fort Sinners can take in the thought of a tedious time of terrible torment, ending at laſt in <hi>Annihilation</hi> and the utter ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinction of their Beings.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Thirdly,</hi> We may conſider further, that the primary end of all Threatnings is not
<pb n="172" facs="tcp:33693:92"/>
puniſhment, but the prevention of it. For God does not threaten that men may ſin and be puniſh'd, but that they may not ſin, and ſo may eſcape the puniſhment threaten'd. And therefore the higher the threatning runs, ſo much the more mercy and goodneſs there is in it; becauſe it is ſo much the more likely to hinder men from incurring the penalty that is threatned.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Fourthly,</hi> Let it be conſider'd likewiſe, that when it is is ſo very plain that God hath threatned eternal miſery to impeni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tent Sinners, all the prudence in the World obliges men to believe that he is in good earneſt and will execute theſe threat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nings upon them, if they will obſtinately ſtand it out with him, and will not be brought to Repentance. And therefore in all reaſon we ought ſo to demean our ſelves, and ſo to perſwade others, as knowing the terrour of the Lord, and that they who wilfully break his Laws are in danger of eternal Death. To which I will add in the</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Fifth</hi> and laſt place, That if we ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe that God did intend that his threat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nings ſhould have their effect to deterr men from the breach of his Laws, it can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not be imagin'd that in the ſame Revela<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion which declares theſe threatnings any
<pb n="173" facs="tcp:33693:92"/>
intimation ſhould be given of the abate<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment or non-execution of them. For by this God would have weaken'd his own Laws, and have taken off the edge and terror of his threatnings: Becauſe a threat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning hath quite loſt its force, if we once come to believe that it will not be execu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted: And conſequently, it would be a ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry impious deſign to go about to teach or perſwade any thing to the contrary, and a betraying men into that miſery which had it been firmly believ'd might have been avoided.</p>
                  <p>We are all bound to preach, and You and I are all bound to believe the terrors of the Lord. Not ſo, as ſawcily to deter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mine and pronounce what God muſt do in this caſe; for after all, He may do what he will, as I have clearly ſhewn: But what is fit for us to do, and what we have reaſon to expect, if notwithſtanding a plain and expreſs threatning of <hi>the ven<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>geance of eternal fire,</hi> we ſtill go on to <hi>treaſure up to our ſelves wrath againſt the day of wrath, and the revelation of the righteous Judgment of God</hi>; and will deſperately put it to the hazard, whether, and how far God will execute his threat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nings upon Sinners in another World.</p>
                  <p>And therefore there is no need why
<pb n="174" facs="tcp:33693:93"/>
we ſhould be very ſollicitouſly concern'd for the honour of God's Juſtice or Good<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs in this matter. Let us but take care to believe and avoid the Threatnings of God; and then, how terrible ſoever they are, no harm can come to us. And as for God, let us not doubt but that he will take care of his own Honour; and that He, <hi>who is holy in all his ways, and righteous in all his works,</hi> will do nothing that is re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pugnant to his eternal Goodneſs and Righteouſneſs; and that He will certain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly ſo manage things at the Judgment of the Great Day, as <hi>to be juſtified in his ſay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings, and to be righteous when we are judged.</hi> For, notwithſtanding his Threatnings, he hath reſerved Power enough in his own hands to do right to all his Perfections: So that we may reſt aſſur'd, that he will <hi>judge the world in righteouſneſs</hi>; and if it be any-wiſe inconſiſtent either with Righteouſneſs or Goodneſs, which He knows much better than we do, to make Sinners miſerable for ever, that He will not do it; nor is it credible, that he would threaten Sinners with a Puniſhment which he could not juſtly execute upon them.</p>
                  <p>Therefore Sinners ought always to be afraid of it, and reckon upon it: And al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ways
<pb n="175" facs="tcp:33693:93"/>
to remember, that there is great Goodneſs and Mercy in the ſeverity of God's Threatnings; and that nothing will more juſtify the infliction of eternal Torments, than the fooliſh preſumption of Sinners in venturing upon them, not<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>withſtanding ſuch plain and terrible Threatnings.</p>
                  <p>This, I am ſure, is a good Argument to all of us, to <hi>work out our Salvation with fear and trembling</hi>; and with all poſſible care to endeavour the prevention of that miſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry which is ſo terribly ſevere, that at pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent we can hardly tell how to reconcile it with the Juſtice and Goodneſs of God.</p>
                  <p>This God heartily deſires we would do; and hath ſolemnly ſworn, that <hi>he hath no pleaſure in the death of the wicked, but ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther that he ſhould turn from his wickedneſs and live.</hi> So that here is all imaginable care taken to prevent our miſcarriage, and all the aſſurance that the God of Truth can give us of his unwillingneſs to bring this miſery upon us. And both theſe, I am ſure, are arguments of great Goodneſs. For what can Goodneſs do more, than to warn us of this miſery, and earneſtly to perſuade us to prevent it; and to threaten us ſo very terribly, on purpoſe to deterr us from ſo great a dan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger?</p>
                  <p>
                     <pb n="176" facs="tcp:33693:94"/>And if this will not prevail with us, but we will ſtill go on to <hi>deſpiſe the riches of God's goodneſs, and long ſuffering, and forbearance</hi>; what in reaſon remains for us, <hi>but a fearful looking for of Judgment and fiery Indignation to conſume us?</hi> And what almoſt can Juſtice, or even Good<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs it ſelf do leſs, than to inflict that pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſhment upon us, which with eyes open we would wilfully run upon; and which no warning, no perſuaſion, no importuni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty could prevail with us to avoid? And when, as the <hi>Apoſtle</hi> ſays, <hi>knowing the Judgment of God, that they which commit ſuch things are worthy of death</hi>; yet for all that, we would venture to commit them.</p>
                  <p>And therefore, whatever we ſuffer, we do but inherit our own choice, and have no reaſon to complain of God, who hath ſet before us Life and Death, eternal Hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pineſs and Miſery, and hath left us to be the Carvers of our own Fortune: And if, after all this, we will obſtinately re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fuſe this happineſs, and wilfully run up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on this Miſery, <hi>Wo unto us! for we have rewarded evil to our ſelves.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>You ſee then, by all that hath been ſaid upon this Argument, what we have all reaſon to expect, if we will ſtill go on in
<pb n="177" facs="tcp:33693:94"/>
our Sins, and will not be brought to Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pentance. You have heard, what a terri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble Puniſhment the juſt God hath threat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned to the Workers of Iniquity: and that in as plain words as can be uſed to expreſs anything. <hi>Theſe,</hi> that is, <hi>the wicked, ſhall go away into everlaſting Puniſhment, but the righteous into Life eternal.</hi>

                  <p>Here are <hi>Life</hi> and <hi>Death,</hi> Happineſs and Miſery ſet before us. Not this frail and mortal Life, which is hardly worth the having, were it not in order to a bet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter and happier Life; nor a temporal Death, to get above the dread whereof ſhould not methinks be difficult to us, were it not for the bitter and terrible con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſequences of it: But an eternal Life, and an eternal enjoyment of all things which can render Life pleaſant and happy; and a perpetual Death, which will for ever torment us, but never make an end of us.</p>
                  <p>Theſe God propounds to our choice: And if the conſideration of them will not prevail with us to leave our ſins, and to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>form our lives, what will? Weightier Motives cannot be propos'd to the under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtanding of Man, than <hi>everlaſting Puniſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment,</hi> and <hi>Life eternal</hi>; than the greateſt and moſt durable happineſs, and the moſt
<pb n="178" facs="tcp:33693:95"/>
intolerable and laſting miſery that human Nature is capable of.</p>
                  <p>Now, conſidering in what terms the Threatnings of the Goſpel are expreſs'd, we have all the reaſon in the world to be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve that the Puniſhment of Sinners in another world will be everlaſting. How<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever, we cannot be certain of the contra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry, time enough to prevent it; not till we come there, and find by experience how it is: And if it prove ſo, it will then be too late either to prevent that terrible Doom, or to get it revers'd.</p>
                  <p>Some comfort themſelves with the un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>comfortable and uncertain hope of being diſcharg'd out of Being, and reduc'd to their firſt Nothing; at leaſt after the te<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dious and terrible ſuffering of the moſt grievous and exquiſite Torments for in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>numerable Ages. And if this ſhould hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pen to be true, good God! how feeble, how cold a comfort is this? Where is the Reaſon and Underſtanding of Men, to make this their laſt Refuge and Hope; and to lean upon it as a matter of mighty conſolation, that they ſhall be miſerable beyond all imagination, and beyond all patience, for God knows how many Ages? <hi>Have all the workers of iniquity no knowledge?</hi> No right ſenſe and judgment
<pb n="179" facs="tcp:33693:95"/>
of things? No conſideration and care of themſelves, no concernment for their own laſting Intereſt and Happineſs?</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Origen,</hi> I know not for what good rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon, is ſaid to have been of opinion, That the puniſhment of Devils and wicked men, after the Day of Judgment, will continue but for a thouſand years; and that after <hi>that</hi> time, they ſhall all be final<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly ſaved. I can very hardly perſuade my ſelf, that ſo wiſe and learned a man as <hi>Origen</hi> was, ſhould be poſitive in an Opi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion for which there can be no certain ground in Reaſon, eſpecially for the pun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctual and preciſe term of a thouſand years; and for which there is no ground at all, that I know of, from Divine Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>velation.</p>
                  <p>But upon the whole matter, however it be; be it for a thouſand years, or be it for a longer and unknown term, or be it for ever, which is plainly threatned in the Goſpel: I ſay, however it be, this is certain, that it is infinitely wiſer to take care to avoid it, than to diſpute it, and to run the final hazard of it. Put it which way we will, eſpecially if we put it at the worſt, as in all prudence we ought to do, it is by all poſſible means to be provided againſt: So terrible, ſo intolerable is the
<pb n="180" facs="tcp:33693:96"/>
thought, yea the very leaſt ſuſpicion of being miſerable for ever.</p>
                  <p>And now give me leave to ask You, as St. <hi>Paul</hi> did King <hi>Agrippa, Do you believe the Scr<gap reason="illegible: missing" extent="1 letter">
                           <desc>•</desc>
                        </gap>ptures?</hi> And I hope I may anſwer for you my ſelf as he did for <hi>Agrippa, I know you do believe them.</hi> And in them theſe things are clearly revealed, and are part of that <hi>Creed</hi> of which we make a ſolemn profeſſion every day.</p>
                  <p>And yet when we conſider how moſt men live, is it credible that they do firmly believe this plain Declaration of our <hi>Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viour</hi> and our <hi>Judge,</hi> That <hi>the wicked ſhall go away into everlaſting Puniſhment, but the righteous into Life eternal?</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Or if they do in ſome ſort believe it, is it credible that they do at all conſider it ſeriouſly, and lay it to heart? So that if we have a mind to reconcile our belief with our Actions, we muſt either alter our <hi>Bible</hi> and our <hi>Creed,</hi> or we muſt change our Lives.</p>
                  <p>Let us then <hi>conſider, and ſhew our ſelves men.</hi> And if we do ſo, can any man to pleaſe himſelf for a little while be con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tented to be puniſh'd for ever; and for the ſhadow of a ſhort and imperfect hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pineſs in this life, be willing to run the ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zard of being really and eternally miſera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble in the next World?</p>
                  <p>
                     <pb n="181" facs="tcp:33693:96"/>Surely this conſideration alone, of the extreme and endleſs miſery of impenitent Sinners in another World, if it were but well wrought into our minds, would be ſufficient to kill all the temptations of this World, and to lay them dead at our feet; and to make us deaf to all the Enchant<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments of Sin and Vice: Becauſe they bid us ſo infinitely to our loſs, when they of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fer us the enjoyment of a ſhort Pleaſure, upon ſo very hard and unequal a conditi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on as that of being miſerable for ever.</p>
                  <p>The eternal Rewards and Puniſhments of another Life, which are the great San<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction and Security of God's Laws, one would think ſhould be a ſufficient weight to caſt the Scales againſt any Pleaſure, or any Pain, that this World can tempt, or can threaten us withal.</p>
                  <p>And yet, after all this, will we ſtill go on to do wickedly; when <hi>we know the ter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rors of the Lord,</hi> and that we muſt one day anſwer all our bold violations of his Law, and contempts of his Authority, with the loſs of our immortal Souls, and by <hi>ſuffering the vengeance of eternal Fire?</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>What is it then that can give men the <hi>Heart</hi> and <hi>Courage</hi>; but I recall that Word, becauſe it is not true <hi>Courage,</hi> but <hi>fool hardineſs,</hi> thus to out brave the Judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
<pb n="182" facs="tcp:33693:97"/>
of God, and to ſet at nought the horrible and amazing conſideration of a miſerable Eternity? How is it poſſible that men that are awake, and in their wits, ſhould have any eaſe in their minds, or enjoy ſo much as one quiet hour, whilſt ſo great a danger hangs over their heads, and they have taken no tolerable care to prevent it? If we have any true and juſt ſenſe of this danger, we cannot fail to ſhew that we have it, by making haſte to eſcape it, and by taking that care of our Souls, which is due to immortal Spirits that are made to be Happy or Miſerable to all Eternity.</p>
                  <p>Let us not therefore eſtimate and mea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure things as they appear now to our ſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſual and deluded and deprav'd Judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments; but let us open our eyes, and look to the laſt iſſue and conſequence of them: Let us often think of theſe things, and conſider well with our ſelves, what ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prehenſions will then probably fill and poſſeſs our minds, when we ſhall ſtand trembling before our <hi>Judge,</hi> in a fearful expectation of that terrible <hi>Sentence</hi> which is juſt ready to be pronounced, and as ſoon as ever it is pronounc'd to be exe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cuted upon us: When we ſhall have a full and clear ſight of the unſpeakable
<pb n="183" facs="tcp:33693:97"/>
Happineſs, and of the horrible and aſto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſhing Miſeries of another World: When there ſhall be no longer any Veil of Fleſh and Senſe to interpoſe between them and us, and to hide theſe things from our eyes: And, in a word, when Heaven with all the Glories of it, ſhall be open to our view; and, as the expreſſion is in <hi>Job, Hell ſhall be naked before us, and Deſtruction ſhall have no covering.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>How ſhall we then be confounded, to find the truth and reality of thoſe things which we will not now be perſuaded to believe? And how ſhall we then wiſh, that we had believed <hi>the terrors of the Lord</hi>; and inſtead of quarrelling with the Principles of Religion, and calling them into queſtion, we had lived under the conſtant ſenſe and awe of them?</p>
                  <p>Bleſſed be God, that there is yet <hi>hope concerning us,</hi> and that we may yet <hi>flee from the wrath to come</hi>; and that the Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeries of Eternity may yet be prevented in Time: And that for this very end and purpoſe, our moſt Gracious and Merci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful God hath ſo clearly revealed theſe things to us, not with a deſire to bring them upon us, but that we being warn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed by his Threatnings, might not bring them upon our ſelves.</p>

                        <p>I returned, and ſaw under the ſun, that the race is not to the ſwift, nor the battel to the ſtrong, nor yet bread to the wiſe, nor yet riches to men of un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtanding, nor yet favour to men of skill; but time and chance happeneth to them all.</p>
                     </q>
                  </epigraph>
                  <p>NEXT to the acknowledgment of God's Being, nothing is more eſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſential to Religion, than the Belief of his Providence, and a conſtant depen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dance upon him, as the great Governor of the World, and the wiſe diſpoſer of all the affairs and concernments of the children of men: And nothing can be a greater argument of Providence, than that there is ſuch an order of Cauſes laid in Nature, that in ordinary courſe every thing does uſually attain its end; and
<pb n="186" facs="tcp:33693:100"/>
yet that there is ſuch a mixture of Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tingency, as that now and then, we can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not tell how nor why, the moſt likely cauſes do deceive us, and fail of produ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cing their uſual effects.</p>
                  <p>For if there be a God and a Provi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence, it is reaſonable that things ſhould be thus: Becauſe a Providence does ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe all things to have been at firſt wiſely fram'd, and with a fitneſs to attain their end; but yet it does alſo ſuppoſe that God hath reſerved to himſelf a power and li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>berty to interpoſe, and to croſs as he plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes, the uſual courſe of things; to awa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken men to the conſideration of him, and a continual dependance upon him; and to teach us to aſcribe thoſe things to his wiſe diſpoſal, which, if we never ſaw any change, we ſhould be apt to impute to blind neceſſity. And therefore the <hi>Wiſe-man,</hi> to bring us to an acknowledg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of the Divine Providence, tells us that thus he had obſerved things to be in this World; that though they generally happen according to the probability of Second Cauſes, yet ſometimes they fall out quite otherwiſe, <hi>I returned, and ſaw under the ſun, that the race is not to the ſwift, nor the battel to the ſtrong,</hi> &amp;c.</p>
                  <p>The connexion of which Words, with
<pb n="187" facs="tcp:33693:100"/>
the foregoing Diſcourſe, is briefly this. Among many other Obſervations which the <hi>Wiſe Preacher</hi> makes in this <hi>Sermon</hi> of the vanity and uncertainty of all things in this World, and of the miſtakes of men about them, he takes notice here in the <hi>Text,</hi> and in the <hi>Verſe</hi> before it, of two Extremes of human Life: Some, becauſe of the uncertainty of all worldly things, caſt off all care and diligence, and neglect the uſe of proper and probable means, having found by experience, that when men have done all they can, they many times fail of their end, and are diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>appointed they know not how: Others, on the contrary, rely ſo much upon their own skill and induſtry, as to promiſe ſucceſs to themſelves in all their under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>takings; and preſume ſo much upon ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cond Cauſes, as if no conſideration at all were to be had of the Firſt.</p>
                  <p>The <hi>Wiſe Preacher</hi> reproves both theſe extremes, and ſhews the folly and vanity of them. On the one hand, of thoſe who ſit ſtill, and will uſe no care and endea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vour, becauſe it may all happen to be diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>appointed, and to fail of Succeſs: Not conſidering, that though prudent care and diligence will not always do the bu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſineſs, yet there is nothing to be done
<pb n="188" facs="tcp:33693:101"/>
without them, in the ordinary courſe of things; and that, in the order of Second Cauſes, theſe are the moſt likely and ef<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fectual means to any end: And therefore, rejecting this lazy Principle, he counſels men, whatever they propoſe to them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves, to be very diligent and vigorous in the uſe of proper means for the at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainment of it; in the <hi>Verſe</hi> immediate<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly before the <hi>Text, Whatever thy hand findeth to do, do it with thy might.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>But then he obſerves alſo, as great a folly and vanity on the other hand; that they who manage their affairs with great wiſdom and induſtry, are apt to preſume and reckon upon the certain ſucceſs of them, without taking into conſideration that which in all human affairs is moſt conſiderable, the favour and bleſſing of that almighty and wiſe Providence which rules the World; <hi>I returned,</hi> ſays he, <hi>and ſaw under the ſun, that the race is not to the ſwift, nor the battel to the ſtrong,</hi> &amp;c.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>I returned and ſaw,</hi> that is, having con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſider'd on the one hand the folly of ſloth and careleſsneſs, I turned mine eyes the other way, and ſaw as great an error on the other hand; in mens preſuming too much upon their own diligence and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duct, without taking notice of the Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vidence
<pb n="189" facs="tcp:33693:101"/>
of God. For I have found, ſays <hi>Solomon,</hi> by manifold obſervation, That the ſucceſs of things does not always an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwer the probability of ſecond cauſes and means. So that the ſum of the <hi>Preacher</hi>'s advice is this: When thou propoundeſt any end to thy ſelf, be diligent and vigo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rous in the uſe of means; and when thou haſt done all, look above and beyond theſe to a Superior Cauſe which over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rules, and ſteers, and ſtops as he pleaſes, all the motions and activity of ſecond Cauſes: And be not confident that all things are ever ſo wiſely and firmly laid, that they cannot fail of ſucceſs. For the Providence of God doth many times ſtep in to divert the moſt probable event of things, and to turn it quite another way: And whenever he pleaſeth to do ſo, the moſt ſtrong and likely means do fall lame, or ſtumble, or by ſome accident or other come ſhort of their end.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>I returned, and ſaw under the ſun,</hi> that is, here below, in this inferior World.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>That the race is not to the ſwift:</hi> This the <hi>Chaldee Paraphraſt</hi> does underſtand with relation to warlike affairs, <hi>I beheld,</hi> ſays he, <hi>and ſaw, that they who are ſwift as eagles do not always eſcape in the day of bat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tel.</hi> But I chuſe rather to underſtand the
<pb n="190" facs="tcp:33693:102"/>
Words in their more obvious ſenſe, that in a Race many things may happen to hinder him that is ſwifteſt from win<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning it.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Nor the battel to the ſtrong</hi>; That is, victory and ſucceſs in war do not always attend the greateſt force and preparati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, nor doth that ſide which in humane eſtimation is ſtrongeſt always prevail and get the better.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Nor yet bread to the wiſe; Neque docto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rum panem eſſe,</hi> ſo ſome render the Words, that learned men are not always ſecured againſt poverty and want.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Nor yet riches to men of underſtanding,</hi> for ſo ſome <hi>Interpreters</hi> tranſlate the Words, <hi>Neque induſtriis divitias eſſe,</hi> that thoſe who take moſt pains do not always get the greateſt eſtates.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Nor yet favour to men of skill</hi>; that is, to thoſe who underſtand men and buſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs, and how to apply themſelves dex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trouſly to the inclinations and intereſts of Princes and Great men. Others interpret theſe Words more generally, <hi>Neque peri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>torum artificum eſſe gratiam,</hi> that thoſe who excel moſt in their ſeveral Arts and Profeſſions do not always meet with fui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>table encouragement: But becauſe the Word, which is here render'd <hi>favour,</hi> is
<pb n="191" facs="tcp:33693:102"/>
ſo frequently us'd by <hi>Solomon</hi> for the fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vour of Princes, the former ſenſe ſeems to be more eaſy and natural.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>But time and chance happeneth to them all</hi>; that is, ſaith <hi>Aben Ezra,</hi> there is a ſecret Providence of God which ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times preſents men with unexpected op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portunities, and interpoſeth accidents which no human wiſdom could foreſee: Which gives ſucceſs to very unlikely means; and defeats the ſwift, and the ſtrong, and the learned, and the indu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrious, and them that are beſt vers'd in men and buſineſs, of their ſeveral ends and deſigns.</p>
                  <p>It ſometimes happens, that he that is <hi>ſwifteſt,</hi> by a fall, or by fainting, or by ſome other unlucky accident may loſe the Race.</p>
                  <p>It ſometimes falls out, that a much ſmaller and weaker number, by the ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vantage of ground, or of a paſs; by a ſtratagem, or by a ſudden ſurpriſe, or by ſome other accident and opportunity, may be victorious over a much greater force.</p>
                  <p>And that an unlearned man, in compa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riſon, by favour, or friends, or by ſome happy chance of ſetting out to the beſt advantage the little learning he has, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore one that hath leſs, may arrive at great things; when perhaps at the ſame time,
<pb n="192" facs="tcp:33693:103"/>
the man that is a hundred times more learned than he, may be ready to ſtarve.</p>
                  <p>And that men of no great parts and induſtry may ſtumble into an eſtate, and by ſome caſual hit in Trade, may attain ſuch a Fortune, as the man that hath toil<gap reason="illegible: missing" extent="1 letter">

                  <p>And <hi>Laſtly,</hi> that a man of no great am<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bition or deſign may fall into an oppor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tunity, and by happening upon the <hi>mollia tempora fandi,</hi> ſome ſoft and lucky ſeaſon of addreſs, may ſlide into his Prince's fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vour, and all on the ſudden be hoiſted up to that degree of dignity and eſteem, as the deſigning Man who hath been laying trains to blow up his Rivals, and waiting opportunities all his days to worm others out and to skrew himſelf in, ſhall never be able to attain.</p>
                  <p>The Words thus explain'd contain this general Propoſition, which ſhall be the ſubject of my following Diſcourſe.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>That in human affairs the moſt likely means do not always attain their end, nor does the event conſtantly anſwer the probabi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lity of ſecond cauſes; but there is a ſecret Providence which governs and over-rules all things, and does, when it pleaſes, inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe to defeat the moſt hopeful and probable deſigns.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>
                     <pb n="193" facs="tcp:33693:103"/>In the handling of this Propoſition I ſhall do theſe three things.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Firſt,</hi> I ſhall confirm and illuſtrate the truth of it, by an Induction of the par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticulars which are inſtanc'd in, here in the <hi>Text.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Secondly,</hi> I ſhall give ſome reaſon and account of this, why the Providence of God doth ſometimes interpoſe to hinder and defeat the moſt probable deſigns.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Thirdly,</hi> I ſhall draw ſome inferences from the whole, ſuitable to the occaſion of this Day. In all which I ſhall endea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vour to be as brief as conveniently I can.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Firſt,</hi> For the confirmation and illuſtra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of this Propoſition, <hi>That the moſt like<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly means do not always attain their end; but there is a ſecret Providence which over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rules and governs all events, and does, when it pleaſes, interpoſe to defeat the moſt pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bable and hopeful deſigns.</hi> This is the gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral Concluſion which <hi>Solomon</hi> proves by this Induction of particulars in the <hi>Text.</hi> And he inſtanceth in the moſt probable means for the compaſſing of the ſeveral ends which moſt men in this World pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe to themſelves. And the great darlings of mankind are <hi>Victory, Riches,</hi> and <hi>Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour:</hi> I do not mention <hi>Pleaſure,</hi> becauſe that ſeems rather to reſult from the uſe
<pb n="194" facs="tcp:33693:104"/>
and enjoyment of the other. Now if a man deſign <hi>Victory,</hi> what more probable means to overcome in a Race than ſwift<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs? What more likely to prevail in War than ſtrength? If a man aim at Riches, what more proper to raiſe an Eſtate than underſtanding and induſtry? If a man aſpire to Honour, what more likely to prefer him to the King's favour and ſervice than dexterity and skill in bu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſineſs? And yet experience ſhews that theſe means, as probable as they ſeem to be, are not always ſucceſsful for the ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>compliſhment of their ſeveral ends.</p>
                  <p>Or elſe we may ſuppoſe that <hi>Solomon</hi> by theſe Inſtances did intend to repreſent the chief engines and inſtruments of hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mane deſigns and actions. Now there are <hi>five</hi> things more eſpecially, which do emi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nently qualify a man for any underta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king; expedition and quickneſs of di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpatch; ſtrength and force; providence and forecaſt; diligence and induſtry; knowledge, and inſight into men and bu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſines: And ſome think that <hi>Solomon</hi> did intend to repreſent theſe ſeveral qualities by the ſeveral inſtances in the <hi>Text. The Race is not to the ſwift,</hi> that is, men of the greateſt expedition and diſpatch do not always ſucceed: For we ſee that men
<pb n="195" facs="tcp:33693:104"/>
do ſometimes out-run buſineſs, and make haſte to be undone. <hi>Nor the battel to the ſtrong,</hi> that is, neither does force and ſtrength always carry it. <hi>Nor yet bread to the wiſe</hi>; which ſome underſtand of the provident care and pains of the Husband<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man, whoſe harveſt is not always anſwer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able to his labour and hopes. <hi>Nor yet riches to men of underſtanding,</hi> or induſtry; that is, neither is diligence in buſineſs always crown'd with ſucceſs. <hi>Nor yet favour to men of skill,</hi> that is, neither have they that have the greateſt dexterity in the ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nagement of affairs always the fortune to riſe. And if we take the words in this ſenſe, the thing will come much to one: But I rather approve the firſt interpreta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, as being leſs forc'd and nearer to the <hi>Letter.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>So that the force of <hi>Solomon</hi>'s reaſoning is this. If the ſwifteſt do not always win the race; nor the ſtrongeſt always over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come in War: If knowledge and learning do not always ſecure men from want; nor induſtry always make men rich; nor po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>litical skill always raiſe men to high place; nor any other means, that can be inſtanced in as moſt probable, do con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtantly and infallibly ſucceed: then it muſt be acknowledg'd that there is ſome
<pb n="196" facs="tcp:33693:105"/>
other Cauſe which mingles it ſelf with humane affairs and governs all events; and which can, and does when it pleaſes, defeat the moſt likely, and bring to paſs the moſt improbable deſigns: And what elſe can that be imagin'd to be, but the ſecret and over-ruling Providence of Al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mighty God? when we can find no other, we are very unreaſonable if we will not admit this to be the Cauſe of ſuch ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>traordinary events, but will obſtinately impute that to blind Neceſſity or Chance which hath ſuch plain characters upon it of a Divine Power and Wiſdom.</p>
                  <p>I might be large upon every one of theſe Inſtances in the <hi>Text,</hi> and illuſtrate them by pat and lively Examples both out of Scripture and other Hiſtories. But I ſhall briefly paſs over all of them, but the <hi>ſecond, the battel is not to the ſtrong.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>The race is not to the ſwift.</hi> If we un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtand this literally, it is obvious to eve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry man to imagine a great many accidents in a Race, which may ſnatch Victory from the ſwifteſt runner. If we under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtand it, as the <hi>Chaldee Paraphraſe</hi> does, with relation to War, that the ſwifteſt does not always overcome or eſcape in the day of Battel; of this <hi>Aſahel</hi> is an eminent Inſtance, who though he was, as
<pb n="197" facs="tcp:33693:105"/>
the Scripture tells us, <hi>light of foot as a wild Roe,</hi> yet did he not eſcape the ſpear of <hi>Abner.</hi> It ſeems that among the <hi>Anci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ents,</hi> ſwiftneſs was look'd upon as a great qualification in a Warriour, both becauſe it ſerves for a ſudden aſſault and onſet, and likewiſe for that which in civility we call a nimble retreat. And therefore <hi>David</hi>; in his Poetical <hi>Lamentation</hi> over thoſe two great Captains, <hi>Saul</hi> and <hi>Jonathan,</hi> takes particular notice of this warlike quality of theirs; <hi>They were,</hi> ſays he, <hi>ſwifter than Eagles, ſtronger than Lyons:</hi> And the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtant Character which <hi>Homer</hi> gives of <hi>A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chilles,</hi> one of his principal <hi>Heroes,</hi> is, that <hi>he was ſwift of foot:</hi> The <hi>Poet</hi> feigns of him, that by ſome charm or gift of the Gods he was invulnerable in all parts of his body except his heel: And <hi>that</hi> was the part to which he truſted; and in <hi>that</hi> he received his mortal wound: The wiſe Poet hereby inſtructing us, that many times our greateſt danger lies there, where we place our chief confidence and ſafety.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Nor yet bread to the wiſe,</hi> or to the learn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed. The poverty of <hi>Poets</hi> is Proverbial; and there are frequent inſtances in Hiſto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry of eminently learned perſons that have been reduced to great ſtraits and neceſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties.</p>
                  <p>
                     <pb n="198" facs="tcp:33693:106"/>
                     <hi>Nor yet riches to men of underſtanding:</hi> By which, whether we underſtand men of great parts, or of great diligence and induſtry; it is obvious to every man's ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſervation, that an ordinary capacity and underſtanding does uſually lie more level to the buſineſs of a common Trade and Profeſſion, than more refin'd and elevated parts; which lie rather for ſpeculation than practice, and are better fitted for the pleaſure and ornament of converſation, than for the toil and drudgery of buſineſs: As a fine Razor is admirable for cutting hairs, but the dull Hatchet much more proper for hewing a hard and knotty piece of timber. And even when Parts and Induſtry meet together, they are ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny times leſs ſucceſsful in the raiſing of a great Eſtate, than men of much lower and ſlower underſtandings: becauſe theſe are apt to admire riches, which is a great ſpur to induſtry; and becauſe they are perpetually intent upon one thing, and mind but one buſineſs, from which their thoughts never ſtraggle into vain and uſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſs enquiries after knowledge, or news, or publick affairs; all which being foreign to their buſineſs they leave to thoſe who are, as they are wont to ſay of them in ſcorn, more curious, and too wiſe to be rich.</p>
                  <p>
                     <pb n="199" facs="tcp:33693:106"/>
                     <hi>Nor yet favour to men of skill.</hi> All Hiſto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry is full of Inſtances of the caſual ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vancement of men to great favour and ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour, when others, who have made it their ſerious ſtudy and buſineſs, have fal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>len ſhort of it. I could give a famous Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ample in this kind, of the manifold and manifeſt diſappointment of a whole <hi>Or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der</hi> of men: the ſlyeſt and moſt ſubtile, <hi>in their generation, of all the children of this World</hi>; the moſt politically inſtituted, and the beſt ſtudied and skill'd in the tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pers and intereſts of men; the moſt prag<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>matical, and cunning to inſinuate them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves into the Intrigues of Courts and great Families: and who, by long expe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rience, and an univerſal intelligence, and communicated obſervations, have redu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ced humane affairs, at leaſt as they think, to a certain Art and Method, and to the moſt ſteddy Rules that ſuch contingent things are capable of: I believe you all gueſs before-hand whom I mean, even the <hi>honeſt Jeſuits:</hi> And yet theſe men of ſo much art and skill have met with as many checks and diſappointments, as a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny ſort of men ever did: They have been diſcountenanc'd by almoſt all Princes and States, and, one time or other, baniſh'd out of moſt of the Courts and Countries
<pb n="200" facs="tcp:33693:107"/>
of <hi>Europe.</hi> And it is no ſmall argument of the Divine Providence, that ſo much cunning hath met with ſo little counte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nance and ſucceſs; and hath been ſo often, ſo groſly infatuated, and their <hi>counſels turn'd into fooliſhneſs.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>But I promis'd only to mention theſe, and to inſiſt upon the ſecond Inſtance in the <hi>Text, I return'd, and ſaw under the Sun, that the battel is not to the ſtrong,</hi> to the <hi>Gibborim,</hi> the <hi>Gyants,</hi> for ſo the <hi>He<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brew</hi> word ſignifies; in which <hi>Solomon</hi> might poſſibly have reſpect to the hiſtory of the <hi>Iſraelites</hi> ſubduing the <hi>Canaanites,</hi> a People of great ſtrength and ſtature, among whom were the <hi>Gyants, the ſons of Anak:</hi> or more probably, to the famous encounter of his Father <hi>David</hi> with the great <hi>Goliah:</hi> But however that be, the <hi>Scripture</hi> is full of Examples to this pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe; that when the Providence of God is pleaſed to interpoſe in favour of any ſide,<note place="margin">2 Chron. 14.11.</note> it becomes victorious; according to the ſaying of King <hi>Aſa</hi> in his prayer to God, <hi>it is nothing with thee to help, whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther with many, or with thoſe that have no power.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Sometimes God hath defeated great Armies by plain and apparent Miracles: Such was the drowning of <hi>Pharaoh</hi> and
<pb n="201" facs="tcp:33693:107"/>
his Hoſt in the <hi>Red Sea</hi>; and the <hi>Stars</hi> fighting in their courſes againſt <hi>Siſera</hi>; by which Poetical expreſſion I ſuppoſe is meant <hi>Siſera</hi>'s being remarkably defeated by a viſible hand from Heaven: And ſuch was the deſtruction of the proud King of <hi>Aſſyria</hi>'s Army by an <hi>Angel,</hi> who ſlew an hundred and fourſcore and five thouſand of them in one night.</p>
                  <p>Sometimes God does this by more hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mane ways; by ſtriking mighty Armies with a <hi>Panick</hi> and unaccountable fear; and ſometimes by putting extraordinary ſpirits and courage into the weaker ſide, ſo that <hi>an hundred ſhall chaſe a thouſand, and a thouſand ſhall put ten thouſand to flight.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>This made <hi>David</hi> ſo frequently to ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>knowledge the Providence of God, eſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cially in the affairs of War.<note place="margin">Pſ. 33.16.</note> 
                     <hi>There is no King ſaved by the multitude of an Hoſt, neither is a mighty man delivered by much ſtrength.</hi> And again,<note place="margin">Pſal. 44 6.</note> 
                     <hi>I will not truſt in my bow, neither ſhall my ſword ſave me.</hi> And <hi>Solomon</hi> confirms the ſame obſervation, <hi>There is no wiſdom,</hi> ſays he, <hi>nor underſtand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, nor counſel againſt the Lord.</hi>
                     <note place="margin">Prov. 21.30, 31.</note> 
                     <hi>The horſe is prepared againſt the day of battel, but ſafety,</hi> or, as ſome <hi>Tranſlations</hi> render it <hi>Victory, is of the Lord. Gideon,</hi> by a very
<pb n="202" facs="tcp:33693:108"/>
odd ſtratagem of <hi>Lamps</hi> and <hi>Pitchers,</hi> de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feated a very numerous Army, only with three hundred men. <hi>Jonathan</hi> and his <hi>Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mour-bearer,</hi> by climbing up a Rock, and coming ſuddenly on the back of the <hi>Phi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liſtines</hi> Camp, ſtruck them with ſuch a terror as put their whole Army to flight. King <hi>Aſa,</hi> with a much inferior number, defeated that huge <hi>Ethiopian</hi> Army which conſiſted of a <hi>Million.</hi> And how was <hi>Xerxes</hi> his mighty Army over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thrown, almoſt by a handful of <hi>Grecians?</hi> And, to come nearer our ſelves, how was that formidable Fleet of the <hi>Spaniards,</hi> which they preſumptuouſly called <hi>invin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cible,</hi> ſhatter'd and broken in pieces, chiefly by the Winds and the Sea? So many accidents are there, eſpecially in War, whereby the Divine Providence doth ſometimes interpoſe and give Victo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry to the weaker ſide.</p>
                  <p>And this hath been ſo apparent in all Ages, that even the <hi>Heathen</hi> did always acknowledge, in the affairs of War, a ſpecial interpoſition of <hi>Fortune</hi>; by which the wiſer among them did underſtand the <hi>Divine Providence. Plutarch,</hi> ſpeaking of the <hi>Romans,</hi> ſays, that <hi>Time</hi> and <hi>Fortune,</hi> the very ſame with <hi>Solomon</hi>'s <hi>Time</hi> and <hi>Chance</hi> here in the <hi>Text, did lay the foun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dation
<pb n="203" facs="tcp:33693:108"/>
of their Greatneſs,</hi> by which he aſcribes their ſucceſs to a remarkable Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vidence of God concurring with ſeveral happy Opportunities.</p>
                  <p>And <hi>Livy,</hi> their great Hiſtorian, hath this remarkable Obſervation, That <hi>in all human affairs, eſpecially in matters of War, Fortune hath a mighty ſtroke.</hi> And again, <hi>No where,</hi> ſays he, <hi>is the event leſs anſwer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able to expectation than in War; and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore nothing is ſo ſlight and inconſiderable, which may not turn the Scales in a great matter.</hi> And <hi>Caeſar</hi> himſelf, who was per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>haps the moſt skilful and proſperous Warriour that ever was, makes the ſame acknowledgment; <hi>As in all other things,</hi> ſays he, <hi>ſo particularly in War, Fortune hath a huge ſway.</hi> And <hi>Plutarch</hi> obſerves, That there was no <hi>Temple</hi> at <hi>Rome</hi> dedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cated to <hi>Wiſdom</hi> or <hi>Valour,</hi> but a moſt magnificent and ſtately one to <hi>Fortune</hi>; ſignifying hereby, that they did aſcribe their ſucceſs infinitely more to the Provi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence of God, than to their own Courage and Conduct. I proceed now, in the</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Second</hi> place, to give ſome reaſon and <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="II"/> account of this, Why the Providence of God doth ſometimes thus interpoſe to hinder and defeat the moſt probable de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſigns
<pb n="204" facs="tcp:33693:109"/>
of men. To bring men to an ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>knowledgment of his Providence, and of their dependance upon Him, and ſubordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nation to Him; and that He is the great Governor of the World, and <hi>rules in the Kingdoms of men</hi>; and that <hi>all the inha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bitants of the Earth are as nothing to Him,</hi> and the power of Second Cauſes inconſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derable: That <hi>He doth according to his will, in the Armies of heaven, and among the inhabitants of the earth, and none may ſtay his hand, or ſay unto him what doſt thou.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>God hath ſo order'd things, in the ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miniſtration of the affairs of the World, as to encourage the uſe of means; and yet ſo, as to keep men in a continual de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pendance upon him for the efficacy and ſucceſs of them: To encourage Induſtry and Prudence, God generally permits things to their natural courſe, and to fall out according to the power and probabi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lity of ſecond Cauſes.</p>
                  <p>But then, leſt men ſhould caſt off Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion, and <hi>deny the God that is above</hi>; leſt they ſhould <hi>truſt in their ſword and their bow, and ſay, the Lord hath not done this</hi>; leſt men ſhould look upon themſelves as the Creators and framers of their own fortune, and when they do but a little outſtrip others in wiſdom or power, in
<pb n="205" facs="tcp:33693:109"/>
the skill and conduct of humane affairs, they ſhould grow proud and preſumptu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous, God is pleaſed ſometimes more re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>markably to interpoſe, <hi>to hide pride from man,</hi> as the expreſſion is in <hi>Job</hi>; to check the haughtineſs and inſolence of mens ſpirits, and to keep them within the bounds of modeſty and humility; to make us to know <hi>that we are but men,</hi> and that the reins of the World are not in our hands, but that there is <hi>One</hi> above who ſways and governs all things here below.</p>
                  <p>And indeed if we ſhould ſuppoſe, in the firſt frame of things which we call <hi>Nature,</hi> an immutable Order to be fix'd, and all things to go on in a conſtant courſe, according to the power and force of ſecond Cauſes, without any interpo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſition of Providence to ſtop, or alter that courſe, upon any occaſion: In this caſe, the foundation of a great part of Religi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, but eſpecially of Prayer to God would be quite taken away: Upon this Suppo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſition, it would be the vaineſt thing in the World to pray to God for the good ſucceſs of our undertakings, or to ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>knowledge Him as the Author of it: For if God do only look on, and permit all things to proceed in a ſettled and eſta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bliſh'd
<pb n="206" facs="tcp:33693:110"/>
courſe; then inſtead of praying to God we ought to ply the means, and to make the beſt proviſion and preparation we can for the effecting of what we de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſire; and to rely upon that, without ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king God at all into our counſel and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſideration. For all application to God by Prayer doth evidently ſuppoſe, that the Providence of God does frequently in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terpoſe, to over-rule events beſides and beyond the natural and ordinary courſe of things, and to ſteer them to a quite different Point, from that to which in human probability they ſeem'd to tend.</p>
                  <p>So that it is every whit as neceſſary to Religion to believe the Providence of God, and that He governs the World, and does when He pleaſes interpoſe in the affairs of it, as that he made it at firſt. I come now in the</p>
                  <p>
                     <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="III"/>
                     <hi>Third</hi> and laſt place, to make ſome In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferences ſuitable to the Occaſion of this Day, from what hath been ſaid upon this Argument: And they ſhall be theſe.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Firſt,</hi> From hence we may learn, not to account Religion, and time ſpent in the Service of God, and in Prayer to Him for his bleſſing upon our endeavours, do be any hindrance to our affairs. For after we have done all we can, the event is ſtill
<pb n="207" facs="tcp:33693:110"/>
in God's hand, and reſts upon the diſpoſal of his Providence.</p>
                  <p>And did men firmly believe this, they would not neglect the duty of Prayer, and behave themſelves ſo careleſly, and unconcernedly, and irreverently in it, as we ſee too many do; they would not look upon every hour that is ſpent in Devoti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on as loſt from their buſineſs.</p>
                  <p>If men would but take a view of what hath happen'd to them in the courſe of a long Life, I believe moſt of us would ſee reaſon to acknowledge, that our pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſperity and ſucceſs in any kind hath de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pended more upon happy opportunities; upon undeſign'd and unexpected occur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rences, than upon our own prudent fore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>caſt and conduct.</p>
                  <p>And if this were well conſider'd by us, we ſhould not methinks be ſo apt to leave God out of our counſels and under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>takings, as if he were a mere Name and Cypher in the World. It is, I am ſure, the advice of one that was much wiſer and more experienc'd, than any of us will pretend to be, I mean, <hi>Solomon, Truſt in the Lord with all thine heart,</hi>
                     <note place="margin">Prov. 3.5, 6.</note> 
                     <hi>and lean not to thine own underſtanding: In all thy ways acknowledge him; and he ſhall di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rect thy paths: Be not wiſe in thine own
<pb n="208" facs="tcp:33693:111"/>
eyes, fear the Lord and depart from evil.</hi> There is no Principle that ought more firmly to be believed by us than this, That to live under a conſtant ſenſe and awe of Almighty God, to depend upon his Providence, and to ſeek his favour and bleſſing upon all our deſigns, being fearful to offend Him and careful to pleaſe Him, is a much nearer and ſurer way to ſucceſs, than our own beſt Pru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence and Preparations.</p>
                  <p>And therefore at ſuch a time, more eſpecially, when we are going to War, or engaged in it, we ſhould break off our ſins by repentance and the ſincere reſolu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lution of a better courſe: We ſhould ear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſtly implore the bleſſing of God upon our undertakings; and not only take great care that our Cauſe be juſt, but likewiſe that there be <hi>no wicked thing</hi> a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mongſt us, to drive God out of our Camp; <hi>no accurſed</hi> thing, that may pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>voke Him to deliver us into the hands of our Enemies. It was a particular Law given by God to the <hi>Jews,</hi>
                     <note place="margin">Deut. 23.9.</note> 
                     <hi>When the Hoſt goeth forth againſt thine Enemy, then keep thy ſelf from every wicked thing; then,</hi> that is, more eſpecially at ſuch a time.</p>
                  <p>And this is a neceſſary Caution, not only to thoſe who are perſonally engaged
<pb n="209" facs="tcp:33693:111"/>
in the War, that by the favour of God they may have their heads covered in the day of Battel, or if God ſhall ſuffer them to fall by the hand of the Enemy, that having made their peace beforehand with Him, they may not only have the comfort of a good Cauſe, but of a good Conſcience, void of offence towards God and men.</p>
                  <p>But this Caution likewiſe concerns thoſe, who are intereſted in the ſucceſs and event of the War; as we all are, not only in regard of our Lives and E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtates, but of that which ought to be much dearer to us, our Religion and the freedom of our Conſciences; which are now every whit as much at ſtake, as our Civil intereſts and Liberties. And there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore as we tender any, or all of theſe, we ſhould be very careful <hi>to keep our ſelves from every wicked thing</hi>; that they who fight for us may not for our ſins, and for our ſakes, turn their backs in the day of battel, and fall by the Sword of the E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nemy.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Secondly,</hi> From hence we may like<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe learn, ſo to uſe the means as ſtill to depend upon God; who can, as he plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes, bleſs the Counſels and endeavours of Men, or blaſt them and make them of
<pb n="210" facs="tcp:33693:112"/>
none effect. For as God hath promiſed nothing but to a wiſe and diligent uſe of means, ſo all our prudence, and indu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtry, and moſt careful preparations may miſcarry, if He do not favour our de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſign: For without Him nothing is wiſe, nothing is ſtrong, nothing is able to reach and attain its end.</p>
                  <p>We ſhould indeed uſe the means as vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gorouſly, as if God did nothing; and when we have done ſo, we ſhould de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pend upon God for the ſucceſs of thoſe means, as if we our ſelves had done no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing, but did expect all from his favour and bleſſing: For when all is done, we are only ſafe under his Protection, and ſure of ſucceſs from his Bleſſing.</p>
                  <p>For whatever vain and <hi>fooliſh</hi> men may <hi>ſay in their hearts, There is, There is a</hi> God, that made the World, and ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miniſters the affairs of it with great Wiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom and Goodneſs; elſe how came any of us into Being, or what do we here? Did we not moſt aſſuredly believe that there is a God, that governs the World and ſuper-intends human affairs; the firſt wiſh of a Wiſe man would be, to ſteal out of Being, if he could; and that the ſame Chance or Neceſſity that brought him into the World, would take the firſt
<pb n="211" facs="tcp:33693:112"/>
opportunity to carry him out. For to be every moment liable to preſent, and great, and certain Evils; and to have no ſecurity againſt the continuance of them, or the return of the ſame or worſe Evils; nor to have any aſſurance of a better and more durable ſtate of reſt and hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pineſs hereafter, is in truth ſo very me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lancholy a meditation, that I do not know any conſideration in the World that is of force and power enough to ſupport the mind of man under it: And were there not in the World a <hi>Being,</hi> that is wiſer, and better, and more powerful than our ſelves, and that keeps things from running into endleſs confuſion and diſorder; a <hi>Being</hi> that loves us, and takes care of us, and that will certainly conſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der and reward all the good that we do, and all the evil that we ſuffer upon his ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count, I do not ſee what reaſon any man could have to take any comfort and joy in Being, or to wiſh the continuance of it for one moment.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Thirdly</hi> and laſtly, The Conſideration of what hath been ſaid upon this Argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, ſhould keep us from being too ſan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guine and confident of the moſt likely deſigns and undertakings; becauſe theſe do not always anſwer the probability of
<pb n="212" facs="tcp:33693:113"/>
ſecond Cauſes and Means; and never leſs, than when we do with the greateſt confidence rely upon them; when we promiſe moſt to our ſelves from them, then are they moſt likely to deceive us: They are, as the <hi>Prophet</hi> compares them, like <hi>a broken reed,</hi> which a man may walk with in his hand, whilſt he lays no great ſtreſs upon it; but if he truſt to it, and lean his whole weight on it, it will not only fail him, but even <hi>pierce him through.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>And we cannot do a greater prejudice to our affairs, when they are in the moſt hopeful and likely condition to ſucceed and do well, than to ſhut God and his Providence out of our counſels and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſideration. When we paſs God by, and take no notice of Him, but will rely up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on our own wiſdom and ſtrength, we pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>voke him to leave us <hi>in the hands of our own counſel,</hi> and to let us ſee what weak and fooliſh Creatures we are: And a man is never in greater danger of drown<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, than when he claſps his arms clo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeſt about himſelf: Beſides, that God loves to reſiſt the ſelf-confident and pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſumptuous, and <hi>to ſcatter the proud in the imagination of their hearts.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>And as in all our concernments we ought to have a great regard to God, the
<pb n="213" facs="tcp:33693:113"/>
Supreme diſpoſer of all things, and ear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſtly to ſeek his favour and bleſſing up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on all our undertakings, ſo more eſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cially in the affairs of War; in which the Providence of God is pleas'd many times in a very peculiar manner to inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe and intereſt it ſelf: And there is great reaſon to think he does ſo; becauſe all War is, as it were, an Appeal to God, and a reference of thoſe Cauſes to the de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciſion of his Providence, which through the pride, and injuſtice, and perverſe paſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſions of men, can receive no other de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>termination.</p>
                  <p>And here God loves to ſhew himſelf, and in an eminent manner to take part with Right and Juſtice againſt thoſe <hi>mighty Oppreſſors</hi> of <hi>the Earth,</hi> who like an overflowing flood would bear down all before them: In this caſe, the Provi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence of God is ſometimes pleas'd to give a remarkable check to great Power and Violence, and to <hi>One</hi> that vainly gives out himſelf <hi>not unequal to the whole World</hi>; by very weak and contemptible means; and, as <hi>the Apoſtle</hi> elegantly ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſeth it, <hi>by the things which are not, to bring to nought the things that are:</hi> And to ſay to <hi>Him,</hi> as God once did to the proud King of <hi>Aſſyria: Whom haſt thou
<pb n="214" facs="tcp:33693:114"/>
reproached and blaſphemed,</hi>
                     <note place="margin">Iſa. 37.23, 26, 27, 28, 29, 32.</note> 
                     <hi>and againſt whom haſt thou exalted thy voice, and lifted up thine eyes on high? even againſt the Holy one of</hi> Iſrael. <hi>Haſt thou not heard long ago, that I have done it; and of ancient times that I have formed it? Now have I brought it to paſs, that thou ſhouldeſt be to lay waſte defenced Cities into ruinous heaps: There<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore their Inhabitants were of ſmall power, they were diſmayed and confounded,</hi> &amp;c. <hi>But I know thy abode, and thy going out, and thy coming in, and thy rage againſt me: Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe thy rage againſt me, and thy tumult is come up into mine ears, therefore will I put my hook into thy noſe, and my bridle into thy lips, and I will turn thee back by the way by which thou cameſt. —The zeal of the Lord of Hoſts ſhall do this.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>But more eſpecially, in vindication of his oppreſſed Truth and Religion, and in the great and ſignal Deliverances of his Church and People, God is wont to take the conduct of affairs into his own hands, and not to proceed by humane rules and meaſures: He then bids ſecond Cauſes to ſtand by, that <hi>his own Arm may be ſeen,</hi> and <hi>his Salvation may appear:</hi> He raiſeth the ſpirits of men above their natural pitch, <hi>and giveth power to the faint, and to them that have no might he increaſeth ſtrength,</hi> as the <hi>Prophet</hi> expreſſeth it.</p>
                  <p>
                     <pb n="215" facs="tcp:33693:114"/>Thus hath the Providence of God very viſibly appear'd in our late Deliverance; in ſuch a manner, as I know not whether He ever did for any other Nation, except the People of <hi>Iſrael,</hi> when He delivered them <hi>from the Houſe of Bondage by ſo mighty a hand and ſo outſtretched an arm:</hi> And yet too many among us, I ſpeak it this day to our ſhame, do not ſeem to have the leaſt ſenſe of this great Delive<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rance, or of the hand of God which was ſo viſible in it; but like the Children of <hi>Iſrael</hi> when they were brought out of <hi>Egypt,</hi> we are full of <hi>murmurings</hi> and diſcontent againſt God the Author, and his Servant the happy Inſtrument under God of this our Deliverance. What the <hi>Prophet</hi> ſays of <hi>that</hi> People, may I fear be too juſtly apply'd to us,<note place="margin">Iſa. 26.10, 11.</note> 
                     <hi>Let favour be ſhewn to the wicked, yet will he not learn righteouſneſs; in the Land of uprightneſs he will deal unjuſtly, and will not behold the Majeſty of the Lord: Lord, When thy hand is lifted up, they will not ſee; but they ſhall ſee, and be aſhamed:</hi> And I hope I may add that which follows in the next <hi>verſe, Lord, thou wilt ordain peace for us; for thou alſo haſt wrought all our works for us.</hi> What God hath already done for our deliverance is, I hope, an earneſt that He
<pb n="216" facs="tcp:33693:115"/>
will carry it on to a perfect peace and ſet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tlement; and this, notwithſtanding our high provocations and horrible ingrati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tude to <hi>the God of our Life,</hi> and <hi>of our Salvation.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>And when ever the Providence of God thinks fit thus to interpoſe in humane af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fairs, <hi>the race is not to the ſwift, nor the battel to the ſtrong:</hi> For which reaſon <hi>their Majeſties,</hi> in their great Piety and Wiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom, and from a juſt ſenſe of the Provi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence of Almighty God, which <hi>rules in the Kingdoms of men,</hi> have thought fit to ſet apart this <hi>Day</hi> for ſolemn repentance and humiliation: That the many and heinous Sins, which we in this Nation have been, and ſtill are guilty of, and which are of all other our greateſt and moſt dangerous Enemies, may not <hi>ſepa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rate between God and us,</hi> and <hi>hinder good things from us,</hi> and cover us with confu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion in the day of our danger and diſtreſs: And likewiſe, earneſtly to implore the favour and bleſſing of Almighty God up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on <hi>their Majeſties</hi> Forces and Preparations by Sea and Land: And more particular<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, for the preſervation of <hi>his Majeſties</hi> ſacred Perſon, upon whom ſo much de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pends, and who is contented again to hazard Himſelf to ſave us.</p>
                  <p>
                     <pb n="217" facs="tcp:33693:115"/>To conclude; There is no ſuch way to engage the Providence of God for us, as by real Repentance and Reformation; and by doing all we can, in our ſeveral Places from the higheſt to the loweſt, by the proviſion of wiſe and effectual Laws for the diſcountenancing and ſuppreſſing of Profaneneſs and Vice, and by the careful and due execution of them, and by the more kindly and powerful influ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence of a good Example, to retrieve the ancient Piety and Virtue of the Nation: For without this, whatever we may think of the firmneſs of our preſent ſet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tlement, we cannot long be upon good terms with Almighty God, upon whoſe favour depends the proſperity and ſtabili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty of the preſent and future Times.</p>
                  <p>I have but one thing more to mind you of; and that is, to ſtir up your charity towards the poor; which is likewiſe a great part of the Duty of this Day, and which ought always to accompany our Prayers and Faſtings: <hi>Thy Prayers and thine Alms,</hi> ſaith the <hi>Angel</hi> to <hi>Cornelius,</hi> are <hi>come up before God:</hi> And therefore if we deſire that our Prayers ſhould reach Heaven, and receive a gracious anſwer from God, we muſt ſend up our Alms along with them.</p>
                  <p>
                     <pb n="218" facs="tcp:33693:116"/>And inſtead of all other arguments to this purpoſe, I ſhall only recite to you the plain and perſwaſive words of God Himſelf, in which He declares what kind of Faſt is acceptable to Him:<note place="margin">Iſa. 58.5, 6, &amp;c.</note> 
                     <hi>Is it ſuch a Faſt as I have choſen? a Day for a man to afflict his ſoul? Is it to bow down his head as a bulruſh, to ſpread ſackcloth and aſhes under him? Wilt thou call this a Faſt, and an acceptable Day to the Lord? Is not this the Faſt that I have choſen? To looſe the bands of wickedneſs, and to undo the heavy burthens, and to let the oppreſſed go free, and that ye break every yoke: Is it not to deal thy bread to the hungry, and that thou bring the poor that are caſt out to thine houſe; when thou ſeeſt the naked that thou cover him, and that thou hide not thy ſelf from thine own fleſh? Then ſhall thy light break forth as the morning, and thy ſalva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion ſhall ſpring forth ſpeedily; thy righte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ouſneſs,</hi> or thine <hi>Alms, ſhall go before thee, and the glory of the Lord ſhall be thy rere<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward: Then ſhalt thou call, and I will an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwer thee; thou ſhalt cry, and He ſhall ſay, here I am.</hi>

Of which dreadful Deſolati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, the firſt taking of <hi>Jeruſalem</hi> by <hi>Nebu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chadnezzar,</hi> and their Captivity into <hi>Ba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bylon</hi> was a kind of Type and Forerunner. For, as <hi>Joſephus</hi> obſerves, the taking of <hi>Jeruſalem</hi> by <hi>Titus Veſpaſian</hi> did happen in the very ſame Month, and on the very ſame Day of the Month in which <hi>Jeru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſalem</hi> was taken by <hi>Nebuchadnezzar, viz.</hi> upon our <hi>tenth</hi> of <hi>Auguſt.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>And it is not unworthy of our obſerva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, that the time of God's warning is wont to hold ſome ſort of proportion with the extent of his Judgments. Before the univerſal Deluge which deſtroyed the whole World<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> 
                     <hi>Noah</hi> and his Family only excepted, God gave a much longer warn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing by the preaching of <hi>Noah,</hi> for the ſpace of an <hi>hundred and twenty years.</hi> Before the deſtruction of a particular Nation, if we may judge by God's dealing with the <hi>Jews,</hi> his time of warning is <hi>forty years.</hi>
                     <pb n="223" facs="tcp:33693:120"/>
And before the deſtruction of a parti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cular City, if we may conclude any thing from the ſingle example of <hi>Niniveh,</hi> the time of God's warning is yet much ſhort<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er, the ſpace of <hi>forty days.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>And now to what end doth God exer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciſe ſo much patience and threaten ſo long beforehand, but that by the terror of his threatnings men may be brought to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pentance, and by repentance may prevent the execution of them? For all the while that God by his Prophet threatens ruin and deſtruction to the People of <hi>Iſrael,</hi> he earneſtly invites and urges them to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pentance, that by this means they might eſcape the ruin that was denounced a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt them: This being a condition per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>petually implyed in the denunciation of publick judgments, that if a People re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pent of the evil of their doings God alſo will repent of the evil which he ſaid he would do unto them, as he expreſly de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clares <hi>chap.</hi> 18. <hi>verſ.</hi> 7, 8. <hi>At what inſtant I ſpeak concerning a Nation and concerning a Kingdom, to pluck up and to pull down and to deſtroy it, if that Nation againſt whom I have pronounc'd turn from their evil, I will repent of the evil which I thought to do unto them.</hi> And here in the <hi>Text,</hi> after God had threaten'd deſtruction to <hi>Jeruſalem,</hi> be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe
<pb n="224" facs="tcp:33693:121"/>
of the overflowing of all manner of wickedneſs and oppreſſion in the midſt of her, he gives her a merciful warning to prevent this ruin and deſolation by re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pentance, <hi>verſ.</hi> 6, 7. <hi>Thus hath the Lord of Hoſts ſaid, Hew ye down trees, and caſt a mount againſt</hi> Jeruſalem; <hi>this is a City to be viſited, ſhe is wholly oppreſſion in the midſt of her. As a fountain caſteth out waters, ſo ſhe caſteth out her wickedneſs. Before me continually is grief and wounds.</hi> And yet when he had pronounced this fearful Sen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tence upon her, he tells her that all this miſery and deſolation might yet be pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vented, if they would but hearken to the counſel of God, and be inſtructed by him concerning the things of their peace: For ſo it follows in the next words, <hi>Be thou in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtructed O</hi> Jeruſalem, <hi>leſt my ſoul depart from thee, leſt I make thee deſolate, a land not inhabited. Be thou inſtructed O</hi> Jeruſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lem, that is, do but now at laſt take that counſel and warning which hath ſo often, and ſo long, been tender'd to thee by my ſervant the Prophet, who hath now for the ſpace of forty years continually, and that with great earneſtneſs and importu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity, been warning thee of this danger and calling thee to repentance and a bet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter mind.</p>
                  <p>
                     <pb n="225" facs="tcp:33693:121"/>
                     <hi>Leſt my ſoul depart from thee.</hi> In the <hi>Hebrew</hi> it is, <hi>Leſt my ſoul be looſened and disjointed from thee,</hi> as it is in the margin of your Bibles; hereby ſignifying, in the moſt emphatical manner, the wonderful affection and kindneſs which God had for his People, and how ſtrongly his ſoul was link'd to them, and how loth he was to withdraw his love from them; it was like the tearing off of a limb, or the pluck<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of a joint in ſunder; ſo unwilling is God to come to extremity; ſo hardly is he brought to reſolve upon the ruin even of a ſinful Nation: How much rather would he, that they would be inſtructed and receive correction, and hearken to the things of their peace? But if they will not be perſuaded, if no warning will work upon them, <hi>his ſpirit will not always ſtrive with them</hi>; but <hi>his ſoul</hi> will at laſt, though with great unwillingneſs and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>luctancy, <hi>depart from them.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>And then, no interceſſion will prevail for them; as he threatens by the ſame Prophet, <hi>chap.</hi> 15. <hi>verſe</hi> 1. <hi>Then ſaid the Lord unto me, though</hi> Moſes <hi>and</hi> Samuel <hi>ſtood before me, yet my mind could not be to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards this People; caſt them out of my ſight and let them go forth</hi>; away with them in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to Captivity, for they have loſt my heart,
<pb n="226" facs="tcp:33693:122"/>
and no interceſſion of others for them, nothing but their own repentance can re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cover it.</p>
                  <p>And when his Soul is once departed from a People, and his heart turn'd a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt them, then all ſorts of evils and ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lamities will be let looſe upon them; as we may read in the next <hi>verſe</hi> of that <hi>Chapter:</hi>
                     <note place="margin">Jer. 15.2.</note> 
                     <hi>And it ſhall come to paſs if they ſay unto thee, whither ſhall we go forth? Then ſhalt thou tell them, Thus ſaith the Lord, ſuch as are for death to death, and ſuch as are for the ſword to the ſword, and ſuch as are for the famine to the famine, and ſuch as are for the captivity to the captivity.</hi> For then God will be weary of repenting, as he tells them <hi>verſe</hi> 6. <hi>Thou haſt forſaken me, ſaith the Lord, thou art gone backward; therefore will I ſtretch out my hand againſt thee and deliver thee, I am weary of repent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing.</hi> By our obſtinate impenitency we harden the heart of God againſt us, and make <hi>him weary of repenting.</hi>
                     <note place="margin">Hoſ. 9.12.</note> And when his ſoul is thus departed from a People, nothing remains but a fearful expectation of ruin. <hi>Wo unto them,</hi> ſaith God by the Prophet, <hi>when I depart from them.</hi> There<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore <hi>be thou inſtructed O</hi> Jeruſalem, <hi>leſt my ſoul depart from thee, leſt I make thee deſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>late, a Land not inhabited.</hi>
                  </p>

                     <pb n="227" facs="tcp:33693:122"/>Having given this account of the Words, I ſhall obſerve from them three things well worth our conſideration.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Firſt,</hi> The infinite goodneſs and pati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence of God towards a ſinful People, and his great unwillingneſs to bring ruin and deſtruction upon them <hi>leſt my ſoul depart from thee, leſt I make thee deſolate, a Land not inhabited.</hi> How loth is He that things ſhould come to this extremity? He is not without great difficulty, and ſome kind of violence, as it were, offered to himſelf, brought to this ſevere reſolution; his ſoul is, as it were, <hi>rent</hi> and <hi>disjointed</hi> from them.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Secondly,</hi> You ſee here what is the only proper and effectual means to prevent the miſery and ruin of a ſinful People. If they will be <hi>inſtructed</hi> and take warning by the threatnings of God, and will become wi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſer and better, then <hi>his ſoul</hi> will not <hi>depart from them,</hi> he will not bring upon them the <hi>deſolation</hi> which he hath threatned.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Thirdly,</hi> You have here intimated the miſerable caſe and condition of a People, when God takes off his affection from them, and gives over all further care and concernment for them. Wo unto them, when <hi>his ſoul departs from them.</hi> For when God once leaves them, then all
<pb n="228" facs="tcp:33693:123"/>
ſorts of evils and calamities will break in upon them.</p>
                  <p>I ſhall ſpeak as briefly as I can to theſe <hi>three</hi> Obſervations from the <hi>Text.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>

                     <hi>Firſt,</hi> I obſerve the infinite patience and goodneſs of God towards a ſinful People, and his great unwillingneſs to bring ruin and deſtruction upon them; <hi>leſt my ſoul depart from thee, leſt I make thee deſolate, a Land not inhabited.</hi> How loth is God that things ſhould come to this? He is very patient to particular perſons, notwithſtanding their great and innume<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rable provocations. <hi>God is ſtrong and pati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ent,</hi> though men <hi>provoke him every day.</hi> And much greater is his patience to whole Nations and great Communities of men.</p>
                  <p>How great was it to the old World, <hi>when the long ſuffering of God waited in the days of</hi> Noah, for the ſpace of an hun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dred and twenty years? And did not ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pire, till <hi>he ſaw that the wickedneſs of man was grown great upon the earth,</hi> and <hi>that all fleſh had corrupted its way</hi>; not till it was neceſſary to drown the World to cleanſe it, and to deſtroy Mankind to reform it, by beginning a <hi>new</hi> World upon the only righteous Family that was left of all the laſt generation of the <hi>Old.</hi> For ſo God te<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtifies
<pb n="229" facs="tcp:33693:123"/>
concerning <hi>Noah,</hi> when he com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manded him to enter into the Ark, ſay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing,<note place="margin">Gen. 7.1.</note> 
                     <hi>Come thou and all thy houſe into the</hi> Ark; <hi>for thee,</hi> that is, thee only, <hi>have I ſeen righteous before me in this Generation.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>The patience of God was great like<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe to <hi>Sodom</hi> and <hi>Gomorrah</hi> and the Ci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties about them. For when <hi>the cry of their ſins had reached heaven,</hi> and called loud for vengeance to be poured down upon them, to expreſs the wonderful patience of God towards ſuch grievous Sinners, though nothing is hid from his ſight and know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge, yet he is repreſented as coming down from Heaven to Earth on purpoſe to enquire into the truth of things, and <hi>whether they were altogether according to the cry that was come up to him.</hi> And when he found things as bad as was poſſible, yet then was he willing to have come almoſt to the loweſt terms imaginable, that if there had been but <hi>ten righteous perſons</hi> in thoſe wicked Cities, <hi>he would not have de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtroy'd them for the ten's ſake.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Nay he ſeems to come to lower terms yet, with the City of <hi>Jeruſalem, Jer.</hi> 5.1. <hi>Run ye to and fro through the ſtreets of</hi> Je<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ruſalem, <hi>and ſee now and know, and ſeek in the broad places thereof, if ye can find a man, if there be any that executeth judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
<pb n="230" facs="tcp:33693:124"/>
and ſeeketh the truth, and I will par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>don it.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>What can be imagin'd more ſlow, and mild, and merciful, than the proceedings of the Divine juſtice againſt a ſinful Peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple? God is repreſented in Scripture as taking a long time to <hi>make ready his bow,</hi> and to <hi>whet his glittering ſword,</hi> before <hi>his hand takes hold of</hi> vengeance; as if the inſtruments of his wrath lay by him blunt and ruſty and unready for uſe. Many a time he threatens, and many a time lifts up his hand, before he gives the fatal blow. And how glad is he when any good man will ſtep in and interpoſe to ſtay his hand? As we read <hi>Pſal.</hi> 106.23. <hi>Therefore he ſaid,</hi> ſpeaking of the People of <hi>Iſrael, that he would deſtroy them, had not</hi> Moſes <hi>his ſervant stood in the breach to turn away his wrath, leſt he ſhould deſtroy them.</hi> And how kindly doth God take it of <hi>Phinehas,</hi> as a moſt acceptable piece of ſervice done to him, and which he hardly knew how ſufficiently to reward, that he was a means of putting a ſtop to his an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger againſt the People of <hi>Iſrael:</hi> Inſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>much that the Pſalmiſt tells us that <hi>it was accounted to him for righteouſneſs to all ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nerations for evermore.</hi> I will recite the whole paſſage at large, becauſe it is re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>markable.
<pb n="231" facs="tcp:33693:124"/>
When the People of <hi>Iſrael</hi> were ſeduced into Idolatry and Whore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom by the Daughters of <hi>Moab, Phinehas</hi> in great zeal ſtood up and executed judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment upon <hi>Zimri</hi> and <hi>Cozbi</hi> in the very act: By which means the Plague which was broken out upon the Congregation of <hi>Iſrael</hi> was preſently ſtayed. Hear what God ſays to <hi>Moſes</hi> concerning this act of <hi>Phinehas. The Lord ſpake unto</hi> Moſes <hi>ſay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing,</hi> Phinehas <hi>the ſon of</hi> Eleazer, <hi>the ſon of</hi> Aaron <hi>the Priest, hath turned away my wrath from the Children of</hi> Iſrael, <hi>whilſt he was zealous for my ſake that I conſumed them not. Wherefore ſay, Behold I give un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to him my Covenant of peace, and he ſhall have it, and his ſeed after him, even the Covenant of an everlaſting Prieſthood, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe he was zealous for his God, and made an atonement for the Children of</hi> Iſrael: That which God takes ſo kindly at his hands, next to his zeal for Him, is, that he pacified God's wrath towards the Children of <hi>Iſrael.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>And thus did God from time to time deal with the People of <hi>Iſrael,</hi> that great Example of the Old Teſtament of the merciful methods of the Divine Provi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence towards a ſinful Nation. And an Example, as St. <hi>Paul</hi> tells us, purpoſely

                  </p>
                  <p>Let us therefore conſider a little the aſtoniſhing patience of God towards that perverſe People. After all the ſigns and wonders which he had wrought in their deliverance out of <hi>Egypt,</hi> and for their ſupport in the Wilderneſs; and not<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>withſtanding their groſs and ſtupid infi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>delity and horrible ingratitude to God their Saviour, and all their rebellious mur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>murings and diſcontents, yet he ſuffer'd their manners for the ſpace of forty years.</p>
                  <p>And when they were at laſt peaceably ſettled in the promiſed Land; notwith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtanding their frequent relapſes into Ido<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>latry, with what patience did God expect their repentance, and the reſult of all the merciful meſſages and warnings given them from time to time by his Prophets, as one that earneſtly deſir'd it and even long'd for it?<note place="margin">Jer. 4.14.</note> 
                     <hi>O</hi> Jeruſalem, <hi>waſh thine heart from wickedneſs, that thou mayeſt be ſaved; how long ſhall vain thoughts lodge within thee?</hi> that is, how long wilt thou delude thy ſelf with vain hopes of eſca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ping the judgments of God by any other way than by repentance? And again, <hi>O</hi> Jeruſalem,<note place="margin">Jer. 13.27.</note>

ſays God there, <hi>I hearkened and I heard, but they ſpake not aright; no man repented him of his wickedneſs, ſaying, What have I done?</hi> Where God is repreſented, after the manner of men, waiting with great patience, as one that would have been glad to have heard any penitent word drop from them, to have ſeen any ſign of their repentance and return to a better mind.</p>
                  <p>And when they made ſome ſhews of repentance, and had ſome fits of good re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolution that did preſently vaniſh and come to nothing, how paſſionately does God complain of their fickleneſs and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>conſtancy? <hi>O</hi> Ephraim, <hi>what ſhall I do un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to thee?</hi> O <hi>Judah,</hi> what ſhall I do unto thee? <hi>for your goodneſs is as a morning cloud, and as the early dew it goeth away.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>And at laſt, when nothing would do, with what difficulty and reluctancy does God deliver them up into the hands of their Enemies? <hi>How ſhall I give thee up</hi> Ephraim? <hi>How ſhall I deliver thee</hi> Judah?<note place="margin">Hoſ. 11.8, 9.</note> 
                     <hi>How ſhall I make thee as</hi> Admah? <hi>how ſhall I ſet thee as</hi> Zeboim? <hi>mine heart is turned within me, and my repentings are kindled together; I will not execute the fierceneſs of mine anger, I will not deſtroy Ephraim.</hi> What a conflict is here? what

                  <p>And when the Nation of the <hi>Jews,</hi> af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter their return from the Captivity of <hi>Ba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bylon,</hi> had in the courſe of ſeveral Ages greatly corrupted themſelves, and fill'd up the meaſure of their ſins by <hi>crucifying the Lord of Life and Glory,</hi> yet how ſlow was the patience of God in bringing that fatal and final Deſtruction upon them?

                     <hi>Second</hi> Obſervation from the <hi>Text, namely,</hi> What is the only proper and ef<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fectual means to prevent the ruin of a ſinful People? And that is, if they will be <hi>inſtructed</hi> and take warning by the threatnings of God to become wiſer and better, then <hi>his ſoul will not depart from them,</hi> and he will not bring upon them the <hi>deſolation</hi> threatned. <hi>Be thou inſtruct<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, O</hi> Jeruſalem, <hi>leſt my ſoul depart from
<pb n="235" facs="tcp:33693:126"/>
thee, and I make thee deſolate, a Land not inhabited</hi>; intimating, or rather plainly declaring to us, that if we will receive in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtruction and take warning the evil threaten'd ſhall not come. For what other reaſon can there be, why God ſhould threaten ſo long before he ſtrikes, and ſo earneſtly preſs men to repentance, but that he might have the opportunity to ſpare them and to ſhew mercy to them?</p>
                  <p>And indeed, as I obſerv'd before, all the denunciations and threatnings of God to a ſinful Nation do carry this tacit condition in them, that if that Nation turn from their evil ways, God will re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pent of the evil which he thought to do unto them. For God never paſſeth ſo irre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vocable a Sentence upon a Nation, as to exclude the caſe of repentance: Nay on the contrary He gives all imaginable en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>couragement to it, and is always ready to meet it, with a pardon in his hand. <hi>How often would I have gathered thee,</hi> ſays our merciful Lord when he wept over <hi>Jeru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſalem, as a hen gathereth her chickens un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der her wings, and ye would not; therefore your Houſe is left unto you deſolate.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>God is very merciful to particular per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons upon their repentance. When the <hi>Prodigal Son</hi> in the <hi>Parable,</hi> after all his
<pb n="236" facs="tcp:33693:127"/>
riot and lewdneſs came to himſelf and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolv'd to return home, his <hi>Father ſeeing him yet afar off</hi> coming towards him, <hi>came out to meet him, and had compaſſion on him and kiſſed him.</hi> And can any of us be ſo obſtinate and hard-hearted, as not pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſently to reſolve to repent and return, and to meet the compaſſions of ſuch a Father? Who, after we have offended him to the uttermoſt, is upon the firſt diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>covery of our repentance ready to be as kind to us, as he could poſſibly have been if we had never offended him.</p>
                  <p>And much more is God ready to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive a Nation upon their ſincere Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pentance; when his Judgments muſt needs make great havock, and ſo many are like to ſuffer under them. This conſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deration God urgeth and pleads with his froward Prophet, in behalf of the great City of <hi>Niniveh.</hi>
                     <note place="margin">Jonah 4.11.</note> 
                     <hi>And ſhall not I ſpare that great City of Niniveh, wherein are more than ſixſcore thouſand perſons, who cannot diſcern their right hand from their left?</hi> that is, ſo many innocent children, by which we may judge of the vaſt number of the reſt of the Inhabitants. For this is a great conſideration with God in his ſending of publick Calamities, the mul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>titude of the Sufferers; and that not on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly

                  <p>Sometimes God reſpites his Judgments upon the mere external humiliation of a People, and ſome formal teſtimonies and expreſſions of their repentance.<note place="margin">Pſal. 78.</note> When the People of <hi>Iſrael ſought God and enqui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red early after him,</hi> though <hi>they did but flatter him with their mouth,</hi> and <hi>their heart was not right with him,</hi> yet the <hi>Pſalmiſt</hi> tells us, <hi>that being full of compaſſion he forgave their iniquity and deſtroyed them not</hi>; that is, he forgave them ſo far as to reſpite their ruin.</p>
                  <p>And much more will a ſincere and ef<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fectual Repentance ſtay God's hand, and infallibly turn him from the fierceneſs of his anger: Inſomuch that after he had fix'd and determin'd the very Day for the deſtruction of <hi>Niniveh,</hi> and had en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gaged the credit of his Prophet in it, yet as ſoon as <hi>he ſaw their works, and that they turned from their evil ways,</hi> and how glad was he to ſee it? he preſently <hi>repented of the evil which he had ſaid he would do unto them, and he did it not.</hi> In this caſe God does not ſtand upon the reputation of his Prophet, by whom he had ſent ſo peremp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tory a meſſage to them; but his mercy

breaks through all conſiderations, and <hi>re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>joiceth againſt judgment:</hi> For he cannot find in his heart to ruin thoſe who by the terror of his judgments will be brought to repentance.</p>
                  <p>And this ſurely is a mighty motive and encouragement to repentance, to be aſſur'd that we ſhall find mercy; and that when our ruin is even decreed, and all the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtruments of God<gap reason="illegible: missing" extent="1 letter">

And if we will not come in upon theſe terms, we extort the judgments of God from him and force him to depart from us, and with violent hands we pull down vengeance upon our own heads.</p>

                     <hi>Thirdly</hi> and laſtly, the <hi>Text</hi> intimates to us the miſerable caſe and condition of a People when God takes off his heart and affection from them, when he gives over all further care and concernment for them, and abandons them to their own wickedneſs and folly, and to the miſera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble effects and conſequences thereof: <hi>Wo unto them, when his ſoul departs from them:</hi> For then all ſorts of evils and calamities
<pb n="239" facs="tcp:33693:128"/>
will ruſh in, and <hi>wrath will come upon them to the uttermoſt</hi>; as was threaten'd to the <hi>Jews</hi> a little before their final deſtruction, and executed upon them in the moſt ter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rible and amazing manner that ever was from the foundation of the World. <hi>Theſe,</hi> as our Bleſſed Saviour expreſſes it, were <hi>days of vengeance</hi> indeed, that <hi>all things which were written,</hi> that is foretold by <hi>Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes</hi> and the <hi>Prophets</hi> concerning the fear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful end of this perverſe and ſtiff-neck'd People, <hi>might be fulfilled.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>And becauſe my <hi>Text</hi> ſpeaks to <hi>Jeruſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lem, Be thou inſtructed, O</hi> Jeruſalem, <hi>leſt my ſoul depart from thee, leſt I make thee deſolate, a Land not inhabited</hi>; though this was ſpoken to <hi>Jeruſalem</hi> before her Capti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vity into <hi>Babylon,</hi> yet becauſe this firſt Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ptivity was but a faint Type of her laſt and final Deſolation by the <hi>Romans,</hi> when <hi>God's Soul</hi> was indeed <hi>departed from Her,</hi> and <hi>Judea</hi> was <hi>left deſolate, a Land not in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>habited:</hi> I ſhall therefore briefly repreſent to you the full effect of this Threatning in her laſt final Deſtruction, when <hi>God's Soul</hi> was, as it were, perfectly <hi>looſen'd</hi> and <hi>disjointed</hi> from Her: That you may ſee what the fierceneſs and power of God's Anger is, when <hi>he departs from them,</hi> and <hi>wrath comes upon them to the uttermoſt,</hi>
                     <pb n="240" facs="tcp:33693:129"/>
becauſe they would not be <hi>inſtructed and know the time of their viſitation.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Thus it was with the <hi>Jews,</hi> about forty years after the Paſſion of our <hi>Lord,</hi> whom <hi>with wicked hands they had crucified and ſlain:</hi> Then was <hi>God's ſoul departed from them:</hi> Then darkneſs and deſolation came upon them; and they were in a far worſe condition than a Countrey would be that is forſaken of the Sun and left condemn'd to a perpetual night, in which darkneſs and diſorder, faction and fury do reign and rage; together with all the fatal con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſequences of <hi>zeal and ſtrife,</hi> which, St. <hi>James</hi> tells us, are <hi>confuſion and every evil work.</hi> For when God is once gone, all the good and happineſs of Mankind departs together with Him: Then men fall foul upon one another, divide into Parties and Factions, and execute the vengeance of God upon themſelves with their own hands.</p>
                  <p>Thus it happen'd to the <hi>Jewiſh</hi> Nation, when the meaſure of their iniquity was full, and their final ruin was approaching. And that we might know their Fate, and be inſtructed by it, God provided and pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerv'd a faithful Hiſtorian on purpoſe, who was an Eye witneſs of all that befel them: I mean <hi>Joſephus,</hi> who was perſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nally
<pb n="241" facs="tcp:33693:129"/>
engaged, and was a conſiderable Commander in the Wars of the <hi>Jews</hi> with the <hi>Romans,</hi> before the Siege of <hi>Jeruſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lem:</hi> And during the Siege was preſent in the <hi>Roman</hi> Camp, and being a <hi>Jew</hi> himſelf hath tranſmitted theſe things to poſterity in a moſt exact and admirable <hi>Hiſtory:</hi> ſuch a Hiſtory, as no man that hath the heart and bowels of a man can read without the greateſt pity and aſto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſhment.</p>
                  <p>In the <hi>Preface</hi> of that lamentable <hi>Hi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtory</hi> he tells us, <hi>that all the misfortunes and calamities which the World from the begin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning of it had ſeen, compar'd with this laſt Calamity of the</hi> Jewiſh <hi>Nation, were but ſlight and inconſiderable.</hi> He tells us like<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe, that their <hi>Civil diſſentions</hi> were the next and immediate cauſe of their confu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion and ruin.</p>
                  <p>And this more than once: For when <hi>Pompey,</hi> about ſixty years before our <hi>Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viour</hi>'s birth, ſate down before <hi>Jeruſalem,</hi> he tells us, <note n="*" place="margin">
                        <hi>Lib.</hi> 1. <hi>c.</hi> 3.</note> that the Factions and diviſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons which they had among themſelves were the cauſe of the taking the City and Temple at that time. And when they re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>belled afterwards, that the Heads of their Factions provok'd the <hi>Romans,</hi> and brought them unwillingly upon them,
<pb n="242" facs="tcp:33693:130"/>
and at laſt forced the beſt natur'd Prince in the World <hi>Titus Veſpaſian</hi> to that ſeve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity which he moſt earneſtly deſired by all means to have prevented. And he fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther tells us,<note place="margin">
                        <hi>Lib.</hi> 4. <hi>c.</hi> 5.</note> that even before the Siege of <hi>Jeruſalem,</hi> the Cities of <hi>Judea</hi> had all of them civil diſcords among themſelves, and that in every City one part of the <hi>Jews</hi> fought againſt another.</p>
                  <p>And when <hi>Jeruſalem</hi> began to be be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſieged, What a miſerable condition was it in, by the cruelty of the <hi>Zealots</hi> under the command of <hi>John</hi> the Son of <hi>Giorah?</hi> And preſently after another Faction aroſe under <hi>Simon,</hi> who enter'd into the City with a freſh Force and aſſaulted the <hi>Zea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lots</hi> in the Temple; ſo that moſt miſera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble havock was made between them. And then a <hi>third</hi> Faction ſtarted up under <hi>Ele<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>azer,</hi>
                     <note place="margin">
                        <hi>Lib.</hi> 7. <hi>c.</hi> 1.</note> as bad as either of the other: So that infinite almoſt were the numbers of the People within the City that were barba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rouſly ſlain by theſe Seditions.</p>
                  <p>And what an infatuation was this? when the Enemy was at the Gates and ready to break in upon them, to employ their whole ſtrength and force againſt one another: When the ſame courage and fury, which they ſpent ſo freely up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on themſelves, had it been turn'd with
<pb n="243" facs="tcp:33693:130"/>
the like deſperateneſs and obſtinacy upon the <hi>Romans,</hi> might have endanger'd the whole force of the <hi>Roman</hi> Empire. Once or twice indeed they ſeem'd to lay aſide their enmity for a little while, and to unite in the common defence; but as ſoon as the danger of a preſent aſſault was over, they relaps'd into their former ſtate of inteſtine enmity and diſſention, as if that had been their main buſineſs, and the preſervation of their City againſt the <hi>Romans</hi> only a work by the by, and not much to be regarded.</p>
                  <p>And to add to all their other miſeries, they were ſo blinded by their own rage and madneſs, that they wilfully brought upon themſelves an extreme Famine. For, as the <hi>Hiſtorian</hi> tells us, they them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves ſet on fire vaſt ſtores of corn and other neceſſaries, ſufficient to have ſerv'd them for many years; and by this means the City was much ſooner reduc'd, even by a Famine of their own making, and which could not have been brought upon them but by themſelves.</p>
                  <p>This Famine, beſides all the other mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeries and cruelties which it occaſion'd within the City, did force great numbers of them to ſteal out by night into the <hi>Roman</hi> Camp; where they met with as
<pb n="244" facs="tcp:33693:131"/>
cruel but a ſpeedier death. For <hi>Titus,</hi> in hope to reduce them the ſooner by terror, order'd all thoſe that came out of the Ci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty to be crucified before the Walls. Which order was ſo ſeverely executed, that for ſeveral days five hundred a day were cru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cified, till there was neither room left to place Croſſes in, nor wood whereof to make them: So that they who once cried out ſo vehemently againſt our <hi>Saviour, Crucify him, Crucify him,</hi> had enough of it at laſt, and by the juſt and moſt remark<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able judgment of God were paid home in their own kind.</p>
                  <p>Behold the ſad Fate of a ſinful People, when God is departed from them! Then all evils overtake them at once. For as their miſery increaſed, ſo did their Impie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty to that degree, that the <hi>Hiſtorian</hi> tells us,<note place="margin">
                        <hi>Lib.</hi> 5. <hi>c.</hi> 2.</note> 
                     <hi>they ſcorned and mocked at all divine and holy things, and derided the Oracles of the Prophets, eſteeming them no better than Fables</hi>; and, in a word, were carried to that extremity of wickedneſs, as not on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly to prophane their <hi>Temple</hi> in the higheſt manner, and to break the Laws of their own Religion, but even to violate the Laws of Nature and Humanity in the groſſeſt Inſtances: which made their <hi>Hiſtorian</hi> to give that diſmal character
<pb n="245" facs="tcp:33693:131"/>
of them, <hi>that as he thought no City ever ſuffer'd ſuch things, ſo no Nation,</hi>
                     <note place="margin">
                        <hi>Lib.</hi> 6. <hi>c.</hi> 11.</note> 
                     <hi>from the beginning of the World, did ever ſo abound in all manner of wickedneſs and impiety:</hi> A certain ſign that <hi>God's Soul</hi> was <hi>depart<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed</hi> from them.</p>
                  <p>And the ſame <hi>Hiſtorian</hi> afterwards, upon conſideration of the lamentable ſtate into which their Seditions had brought them, breaks out into this doleful lamentation over them, <hi>O miſerable City!<note place="margin">
                           <hi>Lib.</hi> 7. <hi>c.</hi> 1.</note> what didſt thou ſuffer from the</hi> Romans, <hi>though at laſt they ſet thee on fire to purge thee from thy ſins, that is to be compar'd with thoſe miſeries which thou haſt brought upon thy ſelf?</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>To ſuch a diſmal ſtate did things come at laſt, that, as the ſame <hi>Hiſtorian</hi> relates, <hi>many of the</hi> Jews <hi>prayed for the good ſucceſs of their Enemies, to deliver them from their civil Diſſenſions, the Calamity where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of was ſo great that their final Deſtruction by the</hi> Romans <hi>did rather put an end to their miſery than increaſe it,</hi>
                     <q>
                        <l>— En! quo diſcordia Cives</l>
                        <l>Perduxit miſeros—</l>
                     </q>
                  </p>
                  <p>To conclude this ſad Story. It was the <hi>Jews</hi> themſelves that by their own folly
<pb n="246" facs="tcp:33693:132"/>
and diſſenſions forc'd the <hi>Romans</hi> to this ſorrowful Victory over them; for in truth all the remorſe and pity was on the Enemies ſide. The <hi>Romans</hi> were little more than Spectators in this cruel Trage<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy, the <hi>Jews</hi> acted it upon themſelves: And they only who were arriv'd at that prodigious height of Impiety and wick<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>edneſs were fit to be the executioners of this vengeance of God upon one another: As if the <hi>Prophet</hi> had foretold this, when he ſays,<note place="margin">Jer. 2.19.</note> 
                     <hi>Thine own wickedneſs ſhall correct thee.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>When Impiety and wickedneſs are at their higheſt pitch in a Nation, then they themſelves are the only proper inſtru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments to puniſh one another. The <hi>Ro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mans</hi> were by far too good and gentle to inflict a ſuffering upon the <hi>Jews</hi> that was equal to the evil of their doings: None but their own barbarous Selves, who were ſunk down into the very loweſt de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>generacy of humane nature, were capa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble of ſo much cruelty and inhumanity as was requiſite to execute the Judgment of God upon them to that degree which their ſins had deſerved.</p>
                  <p>You ſee, my Brethren, by what hath been ſaid upon this Argument, what were the <hi>Faults,</hi> and what the <hi>Fate</hi> of the
<pb n="247" facs="tcp:33693:132"/>
                     <hi>Jewiſh</hi> Nation. Now <hi>theſe things,</hi> as the <hi>Apoſtle</hi> expreſly tells us, <hi>were written for our admonition,</hi> and to the intent that <hi>we upon whom the ends of the World are come</hi> might be inſtructed by them: <hi>We,</hi> I ſay, who next to the <hi>Jewiſh</hi> Nation ſeem to be a People highly favoured by God above all the Nations of the Earth. We reſem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble them very much in their many and wonderful Deliverances, and a great deal too much in their Faults and Follies.</p>
                  <p>But as I intend it not, ſo God forbid that there ſhould be any juſt ground for a full and exact Parallel between us; Yet this I muſt ſay, that nothing ever came nearer to them than We do in ſeveral reſpects. In our fickleneſs and inconſtan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy, in our murmurings and diſcontents; for we are never pleas<gap reason="illegible: missing" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>d with what God does, neither when he brings us into dan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger, nor when he delivers us out of it: We reſemble them likewiſe, in our horrible prophaneneſs and infidelity, and in our impiety and wickedneſs of ſeveral kinds: in our monſtrous ingratitude and moſt unworthy returns to the God of our Sal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vation: and laſtly, in our Factions and Diviſions, which were the fatal ſign of God's being departed from the <hi>Jews,</hi> and the immediate cauſe and means of thoſe
<pb n="248" facs="tcp:33693:133"/>
diſmal Calamities which wrought their final Ruin. And how can we chuſe but dread leſt their Fate ſhould overtake us, the Example of whoſe Faults and Follies we do in ſo many things ſo nearly reſem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble?</p>
                  <p>That this may not, nor any thing like it, be our Fate, let us apply our ſelves to the great Duties of this Day; a ſerious and deep Repentance, and humiliation of our ſelves before Almighty God for the many and heinous Sins which we in this Nation have been, and ſtill are guil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty of, againſt His Divine Majeſty; by our prophaneneſs and impiety, by our lewdneſs and luxury, by our oppreſſion and injuſtice, by our implacable malice and hatred one towards another, and by our ſenſeleſs diviſions and animoſities one againſt another, without cauſe and with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out end: By our neglect of God's Wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhip, and prophanation of his Holy Day, and by our dreadful abuſe of God's great and glorious Name in thoſe horrid Oaths and Curſes and Imprecations which are heard almoſt day and night in the ſtreets of this great City.</p>
                  <p>For theſe and all other our innumera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble provocations of the patience and good<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs and long-ſuffering of God towards
<pb n="249" facs="tcp:33693:133"/>
us, let us ſadly repent our ſelves this Day, and <hi>turn unto the Lord with all our hearts, with faſting, and with weeping, and with mourning: And rent our hearts and not our garments, and turn unto the Lord our God; For he is gracious and merciful, ſlow to anger and of great kindneſs, and repenteth him of the evil: And who knoweth if he will return and repent and leave a bleſſing behind him? Turn thou us unto thee, O Lord, and we ſhall beturned: Take away all iniquity, and receive us graciouſly.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>And let us earneſtly beg of Him, that he would be pleaſed to prevent thoſe ter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rible Judgments and Calamities which hang over us, and which our Sins have ſo juſtly deſerved ſhould fall upon us: And that He would perfect that wonder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful Deliverance which he hath begun for us, and <hi>eſtabliſh the thing which he hath wrought:</hi> That He would bleſs <hi>Them</hi> whom he hath ſet in Authority over us; and particularly, that He would preſerve the Perſon of the <hi>King</hi> in his preſent Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pedition, and crown him with victory and good ſucceſs.</p>
                  <p>And to our Repentance and Prayers let us add our liberal Alms, and according to the counſel given by the <hi>Prophet</hi> to <hi>Nebuchadnezzar,</hi> let us <hi>break off our ſins by
<pb n="250" facs="tcp:33693:134"/>
righteouſneſs, and our iniquities by ſhewing mercy to the poor, if ſo be it may be a length<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ening of our tranquility.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>We are yet, bleſſed be God, in the full enjoyment of peace and quiet at home, and of our Religion and Civil Liberties. God hath given us two excellent Princes ſitting on the Throne together, and both of the ſame Religion with the main Bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy of the Nation; and as bright Exam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ples of piety and goodneſs as <hi>England</hi> ever ſaw: And who do by all ways and means ſtudy and ſeek the good of the People committed to their charge.</p>
                  <p>So that if we did but know our own happineſs, and how to value it, we might be the happieſt People this day under Heaven: And yet for all this, we are ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry far from being happy; becauſe we are neither contented, nor united; and tho we have all the materials of Happineſs about us and within our reach, yet have we not the skill and wiſdom to put them together.</p>
                  <p>Miſerable People! that may be happy and will not; whom neither ſo freſh a Deliverance from ſo great a Danger as was juſt ready to have ſwallowed us up, nor the fear and apprehenſion of falling again into the like confuſion, can be a
<pb n="251" facs="tcp:33693:134"/>
warning to us from returning again un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to the ſame folly: For thoſe odious and unhappy Names of difference which ſome years ago ſprang up among us, the Devil knows how, did ſeem whilſt a common danger threatned us, to be quite dead and buried: But no ſooner was the danger over, but by a kind of <hi>miraculous</hi> infatuation, behold a ſudden <hi>Reſurrection</hi> of them, with greater heats and animo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſities, if poſſible, than before: Juſt as it was with the <hi>Jews</hi> in the Siege of <hi>Jeru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſalem,</hi> when the <hi>Romans</hi> had made a wide breach and the City was furiouſly aſſault<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, the Factions then gave <hi>Truce</hi> to one another, and ran in to the common de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fence; but as ſoon as ever the danger was a little over, they fell on afreſh and pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſecuted their main deſign of deſtroying one another.</p>
                  <p>And now that the danger is a little over with us alſo, how like a Fate upon us does it look, that we are ſo ſoon alter'd from our wiſer and better temper? Did we well and wiſely before out late hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>py Revolution, when we united for our common defence againſt a common dan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger, and did let thoſe <hi>unlucky Names</hi> of diſtinction fall, ſo that they ſeem'd to be quite extinguiſh'd? And can it be now
<pb n="252" facs="tcp:33693:135"/>
wiſe to revive them, and to take them up again; when the ſame danger in ſome degree, and from the ſame implacable Enemies, ſtill hovers over us? No ſurely, it would not be wiſe, if the danger were quite paſt and over; but when it ſtill re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mains and threatens us, what greater fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly and infatuation can there be than ſtill to divide and quarrel among our ſelves? Will nothing but ſad and bitter expe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rience be an admonition to us? Will no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing but the laſt neceſſity and extremity of things bring us to our ſelves and teach us wiſdom?</p>
                  <p>Methinks we ſhould all now be glad to be at reſt, after the tedious troubles and diſtractions, the fruitleſs quarrels and diviſions of fifty years. So long I remem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber; and in all that ſpace how very few years paſs'd over us without ſome great Calamity and diſmal Event. So that by this time one would think we ſhould all be ſick of our own follies, and ſo tir'd with our unprofitable feuds and diſſenti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, as to make both ſides look about them, to ſee if any body will take pity on us, and ſtep in to part our quarrels.</p>
                  <p>And now I begin to be ſenſible, that I have engag'd in a tender Point indeed; and do feel my ſelf ſtanding upon a very

And yet for <hi>Zion</hi>'s ſake <hi>I will not hold my peace,</hi> for <hi>Jeruſalem</hi>'s ſake <hi>I will not keep ſilence:</hi> Of ſo great conſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quence is it to the peace and happineſs of this Church and Nation, that theſe Names and Diſtinctions of Parties ſhould be laid down and aboliſh'd for ever.</p>
                  <p>In order whereunto I take it for grant<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed and lay it for a Principle, that he who hopes to perſuade both ſides muſt provoke neither: And therefore I will not ſo much as enquire where the fault lies.

It muſt indeed begin on one, but if it be not preſently heal'd and made up, the other Party is always ſo civil as to run in and take a ſhare of the fault, that all the blame may not lie wholly on one ſide.</p>
                  <p>And now, my Brethren, let me for once perſuade and prevail with you for your good: Let me be ſo happy as to ſay ſomething that may ſink into your hearts, and incline your minds to peace and good

                  <p>Conſcience is the great Principle of moral Actions, and our Guide in matter of Sin and Duty. It is not the Law and Rule of our Actions, <hi>that</hi> the Law of God only is; but it is our immediate Guide and Directour, telling us what is the Law of God and our Duty.</p>
                  <p>But becauſe <hi>Conſcience</hi> is a word of a very large and various ſignification, I ſhall endeavour very briefly to give you the true notion of it. Now in common ſpeech concerning <hi>Conſcience,</hi> every man
<pb n="265" facs="tcp:33693:141"/>
is repreſented as having a kind of <hi>Court</hi> and <hi>Tribunal</hi> in his own breaſt, where he tries himſelf and all his Actions: And <hi>Conſcience,</hi> under one Notion or other, ſuſtains all parts in this Tryal: The <hi>Court</hi> is call'd the <hi>Court</hi> of a man's <hi>Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcience,</hi> and the <hi>Barr</hi> at which the Sin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner ſtands impleaded, is call'd the <hi>Barr</hi> of <hi>Conſcience: Conſcience</hi> alſo is the <hi>Accuſer</hi>; and it is the <hi>Record</hi> and <hi>Regiſter</hi> of our Crimes, in which the memory of them is preſerv'd: And it is the <hi>Witneſs</hi> which gives teſtimony for, or againſt us; hence are thoſe expreſſions of <hi>the teſtimony of our Conſciences,</hi> and that <hi>a man's own Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcience is to him inſtead of a thouſand Wit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſes:</hi> And it is likewiſe the <hi>Judge</hi> which declares the Law, and what we ought, or ought not to have done, in ſuch or ſuch a Caſe, and accordingly paſſeth <hi>Sen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tence</hi> upon us by <hi>acquitting</hi> or <hi>condemning</hi> us. Thus, according to common uſe of Speech, <hi>Conſcience</hi> ſuſtains all imaginable parts in this <hi>Spiritual Court:</hi> It is the <hi>Court,</hi> and the <hi>Bench,</hi> and the <hi>Barr</hi>; the <hi>Accuſer,</hi> and <hi>Witneſs,</hi> and <hi>Regiſter,</hi> and all.</p>
                  <p>But I ſhall only at preſent conſider <hi>Conſcience</hi> in the moſt common and fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mous Notion of it, as it is the Principle
<pb n="266" facs="tcp:33693:142"/>
or Faculty whereby we judge of moral Good and Evil, and do accordingly di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rect and govern our Actions: So that in ſhort, <hi>Conſcience</hi> is nothing elſe but <hi>the Judgment of a man's own mind concer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning the morality of his actions</hi>; that is, the <hi>Good,</hi> or <hi>Evil,</hi> or <hi>Indifferency</hi> of them; telling us what things are commanded by God, and conſequently are our <hi>Duty</hi>; what things are forbidden by Him, and conſequently are <hi>ſinful</hi>; what things are neither commanded nor forbidden, and conſequently are <hi>indifferent.</hi> I proceed in the</p>

                     <hi>Firſt,</hi> Never in any caſe to act contra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry to the perſuaſion and conviction of our Conſcience.

<pb n="267" facs="tcp:33693:142"/>
ſame ſo long as this perſuaſion continues; becauſe every man's Conſcience is a kind of God to him, and accuſeth or abſolves him according to the preſent perſuaſion of it. And therefore we ought to take great care not to offend againſt the light and conviction of our own mind.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Secondly,</hi> We ſhould be very careful to inform our Conſciences aright, that we may not miſtake concerning our Duty; or if we do, that our errour and miſtake may not be groſly wilful and faulty.</p>
                  <p>And this Rule is the more neceſſary to be conſider'd and regarded by us, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe generally men are apt to think it a ſufficient excuſe for any thing, that they did it according to their Conſcience. But this will appear to be a dangerous mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtake and of very pernicious conſequence to the Souls of men, if we conſider theſe two things.</p>

                  <p n="2">2ly, <hi>Theſe Sins may prove damnable, without a particular repentance for them.</hi> Where the ignorance and miſtake is not groſly wilful, there God will accept of a general repentance; but where it is groſly wilful, great Sins committed up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on it are not pardon'd without a particu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lar Repentance for them: And an errour which proceeds from want of ordinary human care and due Government of a man's ſelf, is in a great degree wilful: As when it proceeds from an unreaſon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able and obſtinate prejudice, from great pride and ſelf-conceit, and contempt of counſel and inſtruction; or from a viſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble byaſs of ſelf-intereſt, or when it is accompanied with a furious paſſion and zeal, prompting men to cruel and horri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble things, contrary to the light of na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture and the common ſenſe of humani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty: An errour proceeding from ſuch cau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes, and producing ſuch effects, is wilful in ſo high a degree, that whatever evil is done in vertue of it is almoſt equally faulty with a direct and wilful violation of the Law of God.</p>
                  <p>The ignorance and miſtake doth in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed make the perſon ſo miſtaken more
<pb n="270" facs="tcp:33693:144"/>
capable of forgiveneſs, which is the ground of our <hi>Saviour</hi>'s Prayer for his Murtherers, <hi>Father, forgive them, for they know not what they do:</hi> St. <hi>Paul</hi> likewiſe tells us, that he found mercy upon this account,<note place="margin">1 Tim. 1.13.</note> 
                     <hi>Nevertheleſs,</hi> ſays he, <hi>I obtained mercy, becauſe I did it ignorantly, and in unbelief,</hi> that is, through a falſe perſua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion of mind, not believing it to be a Sin: And yet he did not obtain this mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy, without a particular conviction of his fault and repentance for it. And St. <hi>Peter</hi> after he had convinced the <hi>Jews</hi> of their great Sin in crucifying <hi>Chriſt,</hi> though they did it ignorantly, yet he exhorts them to a particular and deep repentance for it, as neceſſary to the par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>don and forgiveneſs of it: And therefore after he had ſaid,<note place="margin">Acts 3.19.</note> 
                     <hi>I wote that through igno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rance ye did it, as did alſo your Rulers,</hi> he immediately adds, <hi>Repent ye therefore, and be converted, that your Sins may be blotted out.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>So that it highly concerns men to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſider what opinions they embrace in order to practice, and not to ſuffer themſelves to be hurried away by an unreaſonable prejudice and a heady paſſion, without a due and calm examination of things, nor to be over-born by pride, or humour,
<pb n="271" facs="tcp:33693:144"/>
or partiality, or intereſt, or by a furious and extravagant zeal: Becauſe proporti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>onably to the voluntarineſs of our Er<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rour will be the guilt of our practice purſuant to that Errour. Indeed where our Errour is involuntary, and morally invincible, God will conſider it, and make allowance for it; but where it is voluntary, and occaſioned by our own groſs fault and neglect, we are bound to conſider, and to rectifie our miſtake: For what-ever we do contrary to the Law of God and our Duty, in vertue of that falſe perſuaſion, we do it at our utmoſt peril, and muſt be anſwerable to God for it, notwithſtanding we did it according to the dictate of our Conſcience.</p>
                  <p>A <hi>Third</hi> Rule is this, that in all doubts of Conſcience we endeavour to be equal and impartial, and do not lay all the weight of our doubts on one ſide, when there is perhaps as much or greater rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon of doubting on the other: And con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſequently, that we be as tractable and eaſie to receive ſatisfaction of our doubts in one kind as in another, and be equally contented to have them over-ruled in caſes that are equal: I mean, where our paſſions and intereſts are not concern'd, as well as where they are. And if we do
<pb n="272" facs="tcp:33693:145"/>
not do this, it is a ſign that we are par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tial in our pretences of Conſcience, and that we do not aim meerly at the peace and ſatisfaction of our own minds, but have ſome other intereſt and deſign.</p>
                  <p>For it is a very ſuſpicious thing, when men's doubts and ſcruples bear all on one ſide, eſpecially if it be on that ſide which is againſt charity, and peace, and obedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence to Government, whether Eccleſia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtical or Civil: In this caſe I think that a meer doubt, and much more a ſcruple, may, nay, ought in reaſon to be over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ruled by the Command of Authority, by the opinion and judgment of wiſe and good men, and in conſideration of the publick peace, and of the unity and edification of the Church.</p>
                  <p>Not that a man is in any caſe to go a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt the clear perſuaſion and conviction of his own mind, but when there is on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly a meer doubt concerning the lawful<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs or unlawfulneſs of a thing, it ſeems to me in that caſe very reaſonable that a man ſhould ſuffer a mere doubt or ſcru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple to be over-rul'd by any of thoſe weighty conſiderations which I mention<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed before.</p>
                  <p>The <hi>Fourth</hi> Rule is, that all pretences of Conſcience are vehemently to be ſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpected,
<pb n="273" facs="tcp:33693:145"/>
which are accompanied with turbulent paſſion and a furious zeal. It is an hundred to one but ſuch a man's Conſcience is in the wrong. It is an ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cellent ſaying of St. <hi>James,</hi>
                     <note place="margin">Jam. 1.20.</note> 
                     <hi>The wrath of man worketh not the righteouſneſs of God,</hi> that is, the fierce paſſions of men are no proper inſtruments to promote Religion, and to accompliſh any thing that is good. And therefore if any man be tranſported with a wild zeal, and pretend conſci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence for his fury, it is great odds but he is in an errour: None are ſo likely to judge amiſs, as they whoſe minds are clouded and blinded by their paſſions,
<q>
                        <l>Nubila mens eſt,<note place="margin">
                              <hi>Boeth.</hi>

                        </l>
                        <l>Haec ubi regnant.</l>
                     </q>
                  </p>
                  <p>And if men would carefully obſerve themſelves, they might almoſt certainly know when they act upon Reaſon and a true Principle of Conſcience. A good Conſcience is eaſie to it ſelf, and pleaſed with its own doings; but when a man's paſſion and diſcontent are a weight upon his judgment, and do, as it were, bear down his Conſcience to a compliance, no wonder if this puts a man's mind in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to a very unnatural and uneaſie ſtate.</p>
                  <p>
                     <pb n="274" facs="tcp:33693:146"/>There can hardly be a broader ſign that a man is in the wrong, than to <hi>rage and be confident:</hi> Becauſe this plainly ſhews that the man's Conſcience is not ſetled upon clear reaſon, but that he hath brought over his Conſcience to his inte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reſt, or to his humour and diſcontent.</p>
                  <p>And though ſuch a man may be ſo far blinded by his paſſion as not to <hi>ſee</hi> what is right, yet methinks he ſhould <hi>feel</hi> him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf to be in the wrong by his being ſo very hot and impatient.</p>
                  <p>Art thou ſure thou art in the right? thou art a happy man, and haſt reaſon to be pleaſed: What cauſe then, what need is there of being angry? Hath a man Rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon on his ſide? What would he have more? Why then does he fly out into paſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion? which as it gives no ſtrength to a bad argument, ſo I could never yet ſee that it was any grace and advantage to a good one.</p>
                  <p>Of the great evil, and the perpetual miſtake of this furious kind of Zeal, the <hi>Jews</hi> are a lively and a lamentable Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ample, in their carriage towards our Bleſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed <hi>Saviour</hi> and his Apoſtles: And more particularly St. <hi>Paul,</hi> when he perſecu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted the <hi>Chriſtians</hi> from a falſe and errone<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous perſuaſion of his Conſcience. Hear
<pb n="275" facs="tcp:33693:146"/>
how St. <hi>Paul</hi> deſcribes himſelf and his own doings whilſt he was acted by an erroneous Conſcience: <hi>I perſecuted,</hi>
                     <note place="margin">Acts 22.4.</note> ſays he, <hi>this way unto the death, binding and delivering into priſon both men and wo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men:</hi> And in another <hi>Chapter,</hi>
                     <note place="margin">Acts 26.9.</note> 
                     <hi>I verily thought with my ſelf, that I ought to do many things againſt the Name of</hi> Jeſus <hi>of</hi> Naza<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reth: Here was his erroneous Conſcience Let us next ſee what were the unhap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>py concomitants and effects of it; <hi>ver.</hi> 10, 11: <hi>Which things,</hi> ſays he, <hi>I alſo did in</hi> Jeruſalem, <hi>and many of the Saints I ſhut up in priſon, and when they were put to death I gave my voice againſt them, and puniſh'd them oft in every Synagogue, and compell'd them to blaſpheme; and be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing exceedingly mad againſt them, I per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſecuted them even to ſtrange Cities.</hi> When Conſcience tranſports men with ſuch a furious zeal and paſſion, it is hardly ever in the right; or if it ſhould happen to be ſo, they who are thus tranſported, by their ungracious way of maintaining the truth, and their ill management of a good cauſe, have found out a cunning way to be in the wrong, even when they are in the right.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Fifthly,</hi> All pretences of Conſcience are likewiſe to be ſuſpected, which are
<pb n="276" facs="tcp:33693:147"/>
not accompanied with modeſty and hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mility, and a teachable temper and diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſition, willing to learn and to be bet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter inform'd. A proud and conceited temper of mind is very likely to run in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to miſtakes; becauſe pride and fulneſs of a man's ſelf does keep out knowledge, and obſtructs all the paſſages by which wiſdom and inſtruction ſhould enter into men: Beſides that it provokes God to a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bandon men to their own follies and miſtakes; for <hi>God reſiſteth the proud,</hi> but <hi>the meek will he guide in judgment,</hi> and <hi>will give more grace</hi> and wiſdom <hi>to the humble.</hi> When men are once come to this, to think themſelves wiſer than their Teachers, and to deſpiſe and caſt off their Guides, no wonder if <hi>then</hi> they go a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtray.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Laſtly,</hi> Let us be ſure to mind that which is our plain and unqueſtionable duty: the great things of Religion, wherein the life and ſubſtance of it doth conſiſt; and <hi>the things</hi> likewiſe <hi>which make for peace, and whereby we may edify one another:</hi> And let us not ſuffer our diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>putes about leſſer matters to prejudice and hinder our main duty: But let it be our great care not to fail in thoſe grea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter things which are comprehended un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der
<pb n="277" facs="tcp:33693:147"/>
the <hi>two great Commandments of the Law,</hi> the <hi>Love</hi> of <hi>God</hi> and of our <hi>Neigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bour:</hi> Let us be ſtrict and conſtant in our piety and devotion towards <hi>God</hi>; chaſt and temperate in reference to <hi>our ſelves</hi>; juſt and honeſt, kind and chari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>table, humble and meek, patient and peaceable towards <hi>all men</hi>; ſubmiſſive and obedient to our <hi>Superiours, Natural, Civil,</hi> and <hi>Spiritual.</hi> A due regard to theſe great Vertues of the <hi>Chriſtian</hi> life is the way to <hi>keep a conſcience void of offence, towards God, and towards men:</hi> And ſure<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly the beſt means to have our doubts cleared about matters of leſſer moment in Religion, is heartily to ſet about the practice of the great and unqueſtionable Duties of it: So our <hi>Bleſſed Saviour</hi> hath aſſur'd us,<note place="margin">John 7.17.</note> that <hi>if any man will do the will of God, he ſhall know of</hi> his <hi>Doctrine whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther it be of God.</hi> I come now in the</p>
                  <p n="6">VI<hi rend="sup">th</hi> and <hi>Laſt</hi> place, to <hi>conſider the <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="VI"/> great Motive and Encouragement to this conſcientious care of our Lives and Actions</hi>; which St. <hi>Paul</hi> here tells us was his be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lief of a <hi>Reſurrection,</hi> and of the Rewards and Puniſhments conſequent upon it; <hi>I have hope,</hi> ſays he, <hi>towards God, that there ſhall be a Reſurrection both of the juſt
<pb n="278" facs="tcp:33693:148"/>
and unjuſt: For this cauſe</hi> therefore <hi>I ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>erciſe my ſelf to have always a conſcience void of offence, toward God, and toward men.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>If we believe <hi>the Reſurrection of the dead,</hi> and <hi>a future Judgment,</hi> we ought to be very careful to diſcharge a good Conſcience <hi>now,</hi> in order to the rendring of a good <hi>Account</hi> hereafter; that <hi>we may be ſincere and without offence, with reſpect to the day of Chriſt,</hi> as the <hi>Apoſtle</hi> ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſeth it. For when that great Day of Recompences ſhall come, we ſhall moſt aſſuredly find that nothing will <hi>then</hi> raiſe our hearts, and make us to lift up our heads with joy, like the witneſs of a good Conſcience: And therefore we ſhould make that our conſtant care and compa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion <hi>now,</hi> which will <hi>then</hi> be our great comfort and rejoycing, a good Conſci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence and <hi>the teſtimony</hi> of it, <hi>that in all ſimplicity and godly ſincerity we have had our converſation in the world.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>And on the contrary, when we come to appear before the Great Judge of the World, nothing will fill our minds with ſo much terrour, and our faces with ſo much confuſion, as the clamorous accu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſations of a guilty Conſcience; which will be <hi>more than a thouſand witneſſes</hi> a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt
<pb n="279" facs="tcp:33693:148"/>
us, and will anticipate our con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demnation, and paſs almoſt as ſevere a Sentence upon us as the Judge himſelf can.</p>
                  <p>This is that which will make the ſin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner to droop, and to hang down his head for ever: And one of the principal ingredients of his miſery and torment will be the perpetual regret and remorſe of his own mind for his wilful wicked<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs and folly; which will kindle a fire within him as hot as that without him, and as hard to be quench'd.</p>
                  <p>This conſideration ought to have a mighty Operation upon us to make us very careful to have Conſciences void of offence <hi>now,</hi> that they may be free from torment and anguiſh <hi>hereafter:</hi> That when we ſhall come into the other World, we may not be eternally diſpleas'd with our ſelves, and enrag'd at our own do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings; but may carry with us thither Conſciences clear of all guilt, either by Innocency, or by Repentance.</p>
                  <p>The firm belief of a future ſtate of eternal Happineſs or miſery in another World is the great weight or ſpring that ſets a going thoſe two powerful Princi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ples of humane Activity, the Hopes and the Fears of men; and is in its Nature ſo
<pb n="280" facs="tcp:33693:149"/>
fitted to raiſe theſe Paſſions to that de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gree, that did not experience ſhew us the contrary, one would think it morally impoſſible for humane Nature to reſiſt the mighty force of it.</p>
                  <p>All men are ſenſible, more or leſs, at one time or other of the true force of theſe Arguments; but the miſchief is, that in ſome perſons they work quite the wrong way, and inſtead of leading men to Repentance, they drive them to Infi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>delity: They cannot deny the force of theſe Arguments, if they were true; but that they may avoid the force of them, they will not believe them to be true: And ſo far they are in the right, that granting theſe things to be true, they cannot but acknowledge that they ought to live otherwiſe than they do: But here is their fatal miſcarriage, that being reſolv'd upon an evil courſe, ſince they cannot reconcile their practice with ſuch Principles as theſe, they will fit their Prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciples to their practice; and ſo they will believe nothing at all of the Rewards and Puniſhments of another World, leſt this ſhould diſturb them in their courſe: Vain men! as if Heaven and Hell muſt needs vaniſh and diſappear, becauſe ſome witty but wicked men have no mind to believe them.</p>
                  <p>
                     <pb n="281" facs="tcp:33693:149"/>Theſe men are Infidels in their own defence, and merely for the quiet of their own minds; that their Conſciences may not perpetually rate them, and fly in their faces. For a right belief and an evil Conſcience are but unſuitable com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>panions; they are quarrelſome Neigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bours, and muſt needs live very uneaſily by one another. He that believes the Principles of Religion, and yet is conſci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous to himſelf that he hath liv'd contra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry to them, and ſtill continues to do ſo, how can he poſſibly have any peace and quiet in his mind? unleſs like <hi>Jonah</hi> he can ſleep in a ſtorm, and his <hi>conſcience</hi> be, as it were, <hi>ſeared with a hot iron:</hi> For if his Conſcience be awake, and in any de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gree ſenſible, the evident danger of eter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal ruine, continually hanging over him, muſt in reaſon either drive him to repen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance or to deſpair: If ſo forcible and violent an Argument can make no im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſion upon us, we are ſtupid and be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>witch'd, we are loſt and undone, we are wretched and miſerable for ever.</p>
                  <p>But beſides the future Reward of a ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly and conſcientious courſe, which is <hi>unſpeakable and full of</hi> glory; it hath al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſo this preſent fruit, this <hi>earneſt,</hi> as I may ſay, and ready money in hand, the peace
<pb n="282" facs="tcp:33693:150"/>
and ſatisfaction of our own minds, which is much more valuable <hi>than thouſands of gold and ſilver</hi>; the unſpeakable comfort whereof every man will then find, when he hath moſt need of it: For it will be matter of great joy to him, not only un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der the ſoreſt afflictions and calamities of Life, but even at the hour of Death; when the miſeries of life oppreſs him, and the ſorrows of death compaſs him a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout, and the pangs of it are ready to take hold of him.</p>
                  <p>There is certainly no ſuch comfort un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der the evils and afflictions of this life, as a faithful witneſs in our own breaſts of our own innocency and integrity: When we are afflicted by God, or perſecuted and revil'd by men, it cannot but be a mighty conſolation to us to be conſcious to our ſelves of our own ſincerity. For though no man can acquit and juſtifie himſelf before God as to the perfect in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nocency of his life, in which ſence St. <hi>Paul</hi> ſays,<note place="margin">1 Cor. 4.4.</note> that <hi>though he knew nothing by himſelf, yet was he not thereby juſtified</hi>; I ſay, though no man can plead perfect innocency, yet as to the general courſe and tenour of an unblameable life, a good man may appeal to God, and even when he afflicts him, may look upon
<pb n="283" facs="tcp:33693:150"/>
him as a tender and compaſſionate Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, and not as an angry and revengeful Judge.</p>
                  <p>With this, holy and patient <hi>Job,</hi> un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der all thoſe terrible diſaſters and cala<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mities which befel him, was able in ſome meaſure to comfort himſelf: After he had loſt all, and he had a great deal to loſe; when he was forſaken of all other com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fort, even the charitable opinion of his beſt Friends concerning his ſincerity. In theſe ſad and diſconſolate circumſtances, what was it that bore up his ſpirit? no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing but the conſcience of his own inte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>grity. See with what reſolution and conſtancy of mind he aſſerts and main<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tains it: <hi>I will not,</hi> ſays he,<note place="margin">Job 25.5, 6.</note> 
                     <hi>remove mine integrity from me: my righteouſneſs will I hold faſt, and will not let it go: mine heart ſhall not reproach me, ſo long as I live:</hi> You ſee, that when every thing elſe was gone, his intergrity ſtuck by him, and ſupported him to the laſt.</p>
                  <p>And as to perſecutions and ſufferings from men, our own innocency, and the goodneſs of our Cauſe, will be our beſt comfort under them: When we are not guilty to our ſelves that we have de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerv'd them from men, and are inwardly aſſur'd that whatever we patiently ſuffer
<pb n="284" facs="tcp:33693:151"/>
for God and a good conſcience, will all turn to our account another Day, and <hi>work for us a far more exceeding and eter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal weight of Glory.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>This was <hi>that</hi> which ſupported the firſt <hi>Chriſtians,</hi> that <hi>noble Army of Martyrs,</hi> under all thoſe bitter and cruel perſecu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions, which had otherwiſe been beyond all humane patience to have endur'd: This comforted them in all their tribula<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions; <hi>Our rejoycing,</hi> ſays St. <hi>Paul, is this, the teſtimony of our conſciences, that in ſim<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plicity and godly ſincerity, we have had our converſation in the world.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>So likewiſe under that inferiour but equally malicious ſort of perſecution, of which this Age is ſo very profuſe and prodigal, I mean the cauſeleſs calumnies and reproaches of men: If under theſe we can but approve our Conſciences to God, the uncharitable Cenſures of men are not ſo much to be regarded by us: ſome impreſſion they will make upon a tender mind, but we muſt not, if we can help it, let them ſink too deep into our ſpirits:<note place="margin">1 Joh. 3.21.</note> 
                     <hi>If our hearts condemn us not, we may have confidence towards God</hi>; and then ſurely much more towards <hi>men:</hi> If God and our own Conſciences do but acquit us, methinks it ſhould be no ſuch
<pb n="285" facs="tcp:33693:151"/>
difficult matter to bear the ſlanders and hard cenſures of men.</p>
                  <p>But above all other times, the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fort of a good Conſcience is moſt ſenſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble, and moſt conſiderable, at the hour of Death: For as nothing dejects a man's ſpirit more, and ſends him down with ſo much ſorrow to the grave, as the guilt of an evil Conſcience; what terrour and anguiſh, what rage and deſpair do ſeize upon a Sinner at that time, when he re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flects upon what he hath done, and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiders what he is like to ſuffer? So on the o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther hand, there is nothing that revives and raiſes the fainting ſpirits of a dying man, like the Conſcience of a holy and uſeful life, which hath brought glory to God, and good to men. <hi>The wicked,</hi>
                     <note place="margin">Prov. 14.32.</note> ſays <hi>So<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lomon, is driven away in his wickedneſs,</hi> that is, he is carried out of the World, as it were, in a ſtorm and tempeſt: <hi>But the righteous hath hope in his death</hi>; he uſually dies calmly and comfortably: <hi>Mark the perfect man,</hi> ſays <hi>David,</hi>

                  <p>If a man be conſcious to himſelf that he hath ſincerely endeavour'd to keep the commandments of God, and to do the things which pleaſe Him; if he hath <hi>li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved</hi>

inoffenſively, and, as St. <hi>Paul</hi> ſays of himſelf,<note place="margin">Acts 23.1.</note> 
                     <hi>in all good conſcience before God, and men</hi>; what an unſpeakable conſola<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion muſt it be to him, in that dark and gloomy time, and when he is <hi>walking through the valley of the ſhadow of death,</hi> then <hi>to fear no evil?</hi> and to be able with our <hi>Bleſſed Saviour</hi> to ſay, though in a much inferiour meaſure and degree, <hi>Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther,</hi>
                     <note place="margin">John 17.4.</note> 
                     <hi>I have glorified thee on the earth, I have finiſhed the work which thou haſt given me to do:</hi> And to be able to look Death in the face with the like courage and conſtancy of mind as St. <hi>Paul</hi> did when he ſaw it approaching towards him: <hi>I am now,</hi>
                     <note place="margin">2 Tim. 4.6, 7, 8.</note> ſays he, <hi>ready to be offer'd, and the time of my departure is at hand; I have fought a good fight, I have finiſh'd my race, I have kept the faith; henceforth there is laid up for me a Crown of righte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ouſneſs, which the Lord the righteous Judge ſhall give me at that day.</hi> A comfortable Death, that is free from the ſtings and upbraidings, the terrours and tortures, the confuſion and amazement of a guilty Conſcience, is a happineſs ſo deſireable, as to be well worth the beſt care and en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deavour of a man's whole life.</p>
                  <p>Let us then have a conſcientious re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gard to the whole compaſs of our Duty,
<pb n="287" facs="tcp:33693:152"/>
and, with St. <hi>Paul, Let us exerciſe our ſelves to have always a Conſcience void of offence, towards God, and towards men:</hi> And let us never do any thing whereby we ſhall offer violence to the light of our minds. God hath given us this Principle to be our conſtant guide, and companion; and who-ever, after due care to inform him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf aright, does ſincerely follow the di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctate and direction of this Guide, ſhall never fatally miſcarry: But who-ever goes againſt the clear dictate and conviction of his Conſcience, in ſo doing he under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mines the foundation of his own com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fort and peace, and ſins againſt God and his own Soul.</p>
                  <p>And to the end we may keep our Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſciences clear of guilt, we ſhould frequent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly examine our ſelves, and look back up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on the actions of our lives, and call our ſelves to a ſtrict account for them; that where-in-ſoever we have fail'd of inno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cency, we may make it up by repen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance; and may get our Conſciences clear'd of guilt by pardon and forgive<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs: And if we do not do this, we can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not with confidence rely upon the teſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mony of our Conſciences; becauſe many great Sins may ſlip out of our memories without a particular repentance for them,
<pb n="288" facs="tcp:33693:153"/>
which yet do require and ſtand in need of a particular repentance.</p>
                  <p>Eſpecially, we ſhould ſearch our Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſciences more narrowly at theſe more ſolemn Times of repentance, and when we are preparing our ſelves to receive the Holy Sacrament: And if at theſe Times our hearts do accuſe and condemn us for any thing, we ſhould not only heartily lament and bewail it before God, but ſincerely reſolve by God's Grace to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>form in that particular, and from that time to break off that Sin which we have then repented of, and have ask'd forgive<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs of God for: For if after we have repented of it, we return to it again, we wound our Conſciences afreſh, and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>volve them in a new guilt.</p>
                  <p>In the laſt place, We ſhould reverence our Conſciences, and ſtand in awe of them, and have a great regard to their teſtimony and verdict: For Conſcience is a domeſtick Judge, and a kind of familiar God: And therefore, next to the Supreme Majeſty of Heaven and Earth, every man ſhould be afraid to offend his own Reaſon and Conſcience, which when-ever we knowingly do amiſs, will beat us with many ſtripes, and handle us more ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verely than the greateſt Enemy we have
<pb n="289" facs="tcp:33693:153"/>
in the World: So that next to the dread<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful ſentence of the great Day, every man hath reaſon to dread the ſentence of his own Conſcience. <hi>God indeed is greater than our hearts, and knows all things</hi>; but under Him we have the greateſt reaſon to fear the judgment of our own Conſci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ences: For nothing but that can give us Comfort, and nothing can create ſo much trouble and diſquiet to us.</p>
                  <p>And though the judgment of our Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſciences be not always the judgment of God, yet we have great reaſon to have great regard to it; and that upon ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veral Accounts, which I ſhall but briefly mention, and ſo conclude.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Firſt,</hi> Becauſe the judgment of our Conſcience is free from any compulſion. No body can force it from us, whether we will or no; and make us to paſs ſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tence againſt our ſelves, whether we ſee reaſon for it or not.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Secondly,</hi> The ſentence of our own Conſciences is very likely to be impar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tial, at leſt not too hard on the ſevere ſide; becauſe men naturally love them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves, and are too apt to be favourable in their own caſe: All the World cannot bribe a man againſt himſelf: There is no man whoſe mind is not either diſtemper'd
<pb n="290" facs="tcp:33693:154"/>
by melancholy, or deluded by falſe Prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciples, that is apt to be credulous a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt himſelf, and his own intereſt and peace.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Thirdly,</hi> The judgment which our Conſcience paſſeth upon our own Acti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, is upon the moſt intimate and cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain knowledge of them, and of their true motives and ends. We may eaſily be deceiv'd in our judgment of the Acti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons of other men, and may think them to be much better or worſe than in truth they are: Becauſe we cannot certainly tell with what mind they were done, and what circumſtances there may be to ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cuſe or aggravate them; how ſtrong the temptation was, or how weak the judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of him that was ſeduc'd by it into errour and folly.</p>
                  <p>But we are conſcious to all the ſecret ſprings, and motives, and circumſtances of our own Actions: We can deſcend in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to our own hearts, and dive to the bot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tom of them, and ſearch into the moſt retired corners of our intentions and ends; which none, beſides our ſelves, but only God can do; for excepting <hi>Him</hi> only, <hi>none knows the things of a man but the Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit of a man which is in him.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>
                     <pb n="291" facs="tcp:33693:154"/>
                     <hi>Fourthly,</hi> The Sentence of our Conſci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence is peremptory and inexorable, and there is no way to avoid it. Thou mayeſt poſſibly fly from the wrath of other men to the uttermoſt parts of the Earth, but thou canſt not ſtir one ſtep from thy ſelf: In vain ſhalt thou call up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on the mountains and rocks to fall on thee and hide thee from the ſight of thine own Conſcience.</p>
                  <p>Wretched and miſerable man! when thou haſt offended and wounded thy Conſcience: For whither canſt thou go, to eſcape the eye of this Witneſs, the terrour of this Judge, the torment of this Executioner? A man may as ſoon get rid of himſelf, and quit his own being, as fly from the ſharp Accuſations and ſting<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing Guilt of his own Conſcience; which will perpetually haunt him, till it be done away by repentance and forgive<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs.</p>
                  <p>We account it a fearful thing to be haunted by evil Spirits, and yet the Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit of a man which is in him, throughly affrighted with its own Guilt, may be a more ghaſtly and amazing Spectacle than all the Devils in Hell: There is no ſuch frightful Apparition in the World, as a man's own guilty and terrified Conſci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence
<pb n="292" facs="tcp:33693:155"/>
ſtaring him in the face: <hi>A ſpirit</hi> that is thus <hi>wounded, who can bear?</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>To conclude; Let theſe conſiderations prevail with us always to live, not with regard to the opinion of others, which may be grounded upon miſtake, or may not indeed be their opinion, but their flattery; but with regard to the judgment of our own Conſcience, which though it may ſometimes be miſtaken, can never be brib'd and corrupted: We may be hypocrites to others and baſe flatterers, but our Conſciences when-ever they are throughly awaken'd are always ſincere, and deal truly with us, and ſpeak to us as they think.</p>
                  <p>Therefore what-ever we ſay or do, let it be ſincere? For though hypocriſie may for a while preſerve our eſteem and repu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation with others, yet it can ſignifie no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing to the peace of our own minds: And then what will it avail us to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceal any thing from other men, when we can hide nothing that we ſay or do from our own Conſciences?</p>
                  <p>The Summ of all is this: If we would keep a Conſcience void of offence, let us always be calm and conſiderate, and have the patience to examine things throughly
<pb n="293" facs="tcp:33693:155"/>
and impartially: Let us be humble and willing to learn, and never too proud and ſtiff to be better inform'd: Let us do what we can to free our ſelves from prejudice and paſſion, from ſelf-conceit and ſelf-intereſt, which are often too ſtrong a byaſs upon the judgments of the beſt men, as we may ſee every day in very ſad and melancholy inſtances: And ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving taken all due care to inform our Conſciences a-right, let us follow the judgment of our minds in what we do; and then we have done what we can to pleaſe God.</p>
                  <p>And if we would always take this care to keep a good Conſcience, we ſhould always be eaſie, and good company to our ſelves: But if we offend our Conſci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ences, by doing contrary to the clear dictate and conviction of them, we make the unhappieſt breach in the World; we ſtir up a quarrel in our own breaſts, and arm our own minds againſt our ſelves; we create an enemy to our ſelves in our own boſoms, and fall out with the beſt and moſt inſeparable Companion of our lives.</p>
                  <p>And on the contrary, <hi>a good Conſcience</hi> will be <hi>a continual Feaſt,</hi> and will give us that comfort and courage in an evil day
<pb n="294" facs="tcp:33693:156"/>
which nothing elſe can: And then what<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever happen to us, we may <hi>commit our ſouls to God in well-doing, as into the hands of a faithful Creatour,</hi> To whom with our <hi>Bleſſed Saviour</hi> and <hi>Redeemer,</hi> and the <hi>Holy Ghoſt</hi> the <hi>Comforter,</hi> be all honour and glory, now and ever. <hi>Amen.</hi>

                  <p>IN the beginning of this <hi>Chapter</hi> the People of the <hi>Jews,</hi> who were then rebuilding the Temple at <hi>Jeruſalem,</hi> and had already far advanced the work, though it was not perfectly finiſh'd till about two years after, ſend to the <hi>Prieſts</hi> and the <hi>Prophets,</hi> to enquire of them, whether they ſhould ſtill continue the
<pb n="298" facs="tcp:33693:158"/>
                     <hi>Faſt</hi> of the <hi>fifth</hi> Month, which they had begun in <hi>Babylon</hi> and continued to ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerve during the ſeventy Years of their Captivity, in a ſad remembrance of the deſtruction of the City and Temple of <hi>Jeruſalem</hi>; or ſhould not now rather turn it into a Day of feaſting and glad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs?</p>
                  <p>To this enquiry God by his Prophet returns an Anſwer in this, and the fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowing <hi>Chapter.</hi> And firſt he expoſtu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lates with them concerning thoſe their monthly Faſts, whether they did indeed deſerve that name, and were not rather a mere ſhew and pretence of a Religious Faſt, <hi>verſes</hi> 4, 5. <hi>Then came the word of the Lord of Hoſts unto me, ſaying; Speak unto all the People of the Land, and to the Prieſts, ſaying, When ye faſted and mourn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed in the fifth and ſeventh month, even thoſe ſeventy years, did ye at all faſt un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to me, even unto me?</hi> The enquiry was particularly concerning the <hi>Faſt</hi> of the <hi>fifth</hi> Month, becauſe the occaſion of that was more conſiderable than of all the other; but the Anſwer of God mentions the <hi>Faſts</hi> of the <hi>fifth</hi> and <hi>ſeventh</hi> Months, theſe two being probably obſerv'd with greater ſolemnity than the other.</p>
                  <p>
                     <pb n="299" facs="tcp:33693:158"/>But for our clearer underſtanding of this, it will be requiſite to conſider the original and occaſion of all their <hi>monthly Faſts:</hi> which as appears from other pla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces of Scripture, in ſhort, was this: When the <hi>Jews</hi> were carried away Cap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tive into <hi>Babylon,</hi> in a deep ſenſe of this great Judgment of God upon them for their Sins, and of the heavy affliction which they lay under, they appointed <hi>four annual Faſts,</hi> which they obſerved during their ſeventy years Captivity, <hi>viz.</hi> the <hi>Faſt</hi> of the <hi>fourth</hi> Month, in remembrance of the Enemies breaking through the Wall of <hi>Jeruſalem,</hi> which we find mention'd, <hi>Jer.</hi> 52.6, 7.

The <hi>Faſt</hi> of the <hi>ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venth</hi> Month, in remembrance of the ſlay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of <hi>Gedaliah,</hi> upon which followed the diſperſion of the <hi>Jews,</hi> of which we have an account, <hi>Jer.</hi> 42.1, 2. And the <hi>Faſt</hi> of the <hi>tenth</hi> Month, in memory of the beginning of the Siege of <hi>Jeru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſalem,</hi> of which we find mention, 2 <hi>Kings</hi> 25.1.</p>
                  <p>In this order we find theſe <hi>four</hi> Annual Faſts mention'd, <hi>Zechar.</hi> 8.19. not ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to the order of the Events, but
<pb n="300" facs="tcp:33693:159"/>
of the Months of the ſeveral Years in which theſe Events happened: And there likewiſe God gives a full Anſwer to this Enquiry concerning the continuance of theſe <hi>annual Faſts</hi> namely, That they ſhould for the future be turned into ſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lemn Days of joy and gladneſs.<note place="margin">Zech. 8.18, 19.</note> 
                     <hi>And the word of the Lord of Hoſts came unto me, ſaying, Thus ſaith the Lord of Hoſts, the Faſt of the fourth Month, and the Faſt of the fifth, and the Faſt of the ſeventh, and the Faſt of the tenth, ſhall be to the Houſe of</hi> Judah <hi>joy and gladneſs, and cheerful Feaſts.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>I return now to the Text, <hi>Did ye at all faſt unto me, even unto me?</hi> that is, did theſe <hi>Faſts</hi> truly ſerve to any Religious end and purpoſe? Did not the People content themſelves with a mere external ſhew and performance, without any in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward affliction and humiliation of their Souls, in order to a real repentance? Did they not ſtill go on in their ſins; nay, and add to them upon theſe Occaſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, faſting for ſtrife and debate and op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſion? In a word, were they not worſe rather than better for them? And there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore God had no regard to them, as it follows in this <hi>Chapter;</hi>
                     <note place="margin">Verſe 9, 10, 11, 12, 13.</note> 
                     <hi>Thus ſpeaketh the Lord of Hoſts, ſaying; Execute judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment,
<pb n="301" facs="tcp:33693:159"/>
and ſhew mercy and compaſſion every man to his brother; and oppreſs not the widows nor the fatherleſs, the ſtranger nor the poor; and let none of you imagine miſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chief againſt his brother in your heart: But they refuſed to hearken, and pull'd away the ſhoulder, and ſtopped their ears that they ſhould not hear; yea, they made their heart as an Adamant-ſtone, leſt they ſhould bear the Law and the words which the Lord of Hoſts hath ſent by his ſpirit in the former Prophets: Therefore came great wrath from the Lord of Hoſts: There<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore it is come to paſs, that as he cried and they would not hear; ſo they cried, and I would not hear, ſaith the Lord of Hoſts.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>So that notwithſtanding theſe outward Solemnities of Faſting and Prayer, here was nothing of a Religious Faſt; <hi>did ye at all faſt unto me, even unto me?</hi> They were ſenſible of the Judgments of God which were broken in upon them, but they did not turn from their ſins, but perſiſted ſtill in their obſtinacy and diſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bedience.</p>
                  <p>And what God here by the Prophet <hi>Zechary</hi> calls <hi>faſting unto Him, even unto Him,</hi> the Prophet <hi>Iſaiah</hi> calls <hi>the Faſt which God hath choſen, and an acceptable
<pb n="302" facs="tcp:33693:160"/>
day to the Lord. Wherefore have we faſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, ſay they, and thou ſeeſt not? Where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore have we afflicted our ſouls, and thou takeſt no knowledge? Behold, ye faſt for ſtrife and debate, and to ſmite with the fiſt of wickedneſs: ye ſhall not faſt as ye do this day, to make your voice to be heard on high. Is it ſuch a Faſt as I have choſen, a Day for a man to afflict his Soul? Is it to bow down his head as a bulruſh, and to ſpread ſackcloth and aſhes under him? Wilt thou call this a Faſt and an acceptable day to the Lord? Is it not to deal thy bread to the hungry, and that thou bring the poor that are caſt out to thy houſe; when thou ſeeſt the naked that thou cover him, and that thou hide not thy ſelf from thine own fleſh? Then ſhall thy light break forth as the morning, and thy ſalvation ſhall ſpring forth ſpeedily: Then ſhalt thou call and the Lord ſhall anſwer,</hi> &amp;c.</p>
                  <p>From all which paſſages we may eaſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly underſtand wherein theſe <hi>Monthly Faſts</hi> of the <hi>Jews</hi> were defective, and what was the fault that God finds with them when he expoſtulates ſo ſeverely in the <hi>Text: When ye faſted and mourned in the fifth and ſeventh Month, even theſe ſeventy years, did ye at all faſt unto me, even unto me?</hi> In the general, the fault which God
<pb n="303" facs="tcp:33693:160"/>
finds with them was this, that theſe So<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lemnities did not ſerve any real end and purpoſe of Religion, but fail'd in their main deſign, which was a ſincere repen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance and reformation of their lives: For which reaſon he tells them that they were not at all acceptable to Him, nor eſteem'd by Him as perform'd <hi>unto Him,</hi> becauſe they did not anſwer the true in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tention and deſign of them.</p>
                  <p>My work at this time ſhall be, <hi>Firſt,</hi> to conſider in general what it is to <hi>faſt</hi> unto God, that is, to keep a truly Reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gious Faſt. <hi>Secondly,</hi> to bring the mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter nearer to our ſelves, I ſhall conſider more particularly, what the Duty of this Day, appointed by their <hi>Majeſties</hi> for a ſolemn Humiliation and Repentance throughout the Nation, does require at our hands.</p>
                  <p n="1">I. I ſhall conſider in general what it is <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="I"/> to <hi>faſt unto God,</hi> that is, to keep a truly Religious Faſt. And of this I ſhall give an account in the following particulars. <hi>Firſt,</hi> a truly Religious Faſt conſiſts in the afflicting of our Bodies by a ſtrict ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtinence, that ſo they may be fit and proper inſtruments to promote and help forward the grief and trouble of our
<pb n="304" facs="tcp:33693:161"/>
minds. <hi>Secondly,</hi> in the humble Confeſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of our Sins to God with ſhame and confuſion of face, and with a hearty con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trition and ſorrow for them. <hi>Thirdly,</hi> in an earneſt deprecation of God's diſplea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure, and humble ſupplications to Him that he would avert his Judgments and turn away his Anger from us. <hi>Fourthly,</hi> in Interceſſion with God for ſuch ſpiri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tual and temporal Bleſſings upon our ſelves and others as are needful and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venient. <hi>Fifthly,</hi> in Alms and Charity to the poor, that our Humiliation and Prayers may find acceptance with God. I do but mention theſe particulars, that I may more largely inſiſt upon that which I mainly intended, and propoſed to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſider in the next place, namely,</p>
                  <p n="2">
                     <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="II"/> II. What the Duty of this Day, ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pointed by their <hi>Majeſties</hi> for a ſolemn Humiliation and Repentance throughout the Nation, doth require at our hands. And this I ſhall endeavour to comprize in the following particulars. <hi>Firſt,</hi> that we ſhould humble our ſelves before God every one for his own perſonal Sins, whereby he hath provoked God, and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>creaſed the publick Guilt, and done his part to bring down the judgments and
<pb n="305" facs="tcp:33693:161"/>
vengeance of God upon the Nation. <hi>Secondly,</hi> that we ſhould likewiſe heartily lament and bewail the Sins of others; eſpecially the great and crying Sins of the Nation, committed by all Ranks and Orders of men amongſt us, and where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by the wrath and indignation of Almigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty God hath been ſo juſtly incenſed a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt us. <hi>Thirdly,</hi> we ſhould moſt im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portunately deprecate thoſe terrible Judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments of God to which theſe our great and crying Sins have ſo juſtly expoſed us. <hi>Fourthly,</hi> we ſhould pour out our earneſt prayers and ſupplications to Almighty God for the preſervation of their <hi>Maje<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſties</hi> Sacred Perſons, and for the eſtabliſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment and proſperity of their Government, and for the good ſucceſs of their Arms and Forces by Sea and Land. <hi>Fifthly,</hi> our Faſting and Prayers ſhould be accom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>panied with our Charity and Alms to the poor and needy. <hi>Laſtly,</hi> we ſhould pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſecute our Repentance and good Reſolu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions to the actual Reformation and A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mendment of our lives. Of theſe I ſhall, by God's Aſſiſtance, ſpeak as briefly and as plainly as I can, and ſo as every one of us may underſtand what God requires of him upon ſo ſolemn an Occaſion as this.</p>
                  <p>
                     <pb n="336" facs="tcp:33693:162"/>
                     <hi>Firſt,</hi> We ſhould humble our ſelves be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore God every one for his own perſonal Sins and Miſcarriages, whereby he hath provoked God, and increaſed the pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lick Guilt, and done his part to bring down the Judgments and Vengeance of God upon the Nation. Our Humiliati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on and Repentance ſhould begin with our ſelves and our own Sins, becauſe Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pentance is always deſign'd to end in Reformation; but there cannot be a ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neral Reformation without the Reforma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of particular Perſons which do con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtitute and make up the generality.</p>
                  <p>And this <hi>Solomon</hi> preſcribes as the true Method of a National Reformation, and the proper effect of a publick Humiliati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on and Repentance; in that admirable Prayer of his at the Dedication of the Temple:<note place="margin">1 Kings 8.37, 38, 39, 40.</note> 
                     <hi>If there be,</hi> ſays he, <hi>in the Land famine; if there be peſtilence, blaſting, mildew, locuſt, or if there be caterpillar; or if their Enemy beſiege them in the Land of their Cities: what-ever plague, what-ever ſickneſs there be; what prayer or ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plication ſoever be made by any man, or by all thy People</hi> Iſrael, WHO SHALL KNOW EVERY MAN THE PLAGUE OF HIS OWN HEART, <hi>and ſpread forth his hands towards this Houſe: Then hear
<pb n="307" facs="tcp:33693:162"/>
thou in Heaven thy dwelling-place, and forgive, and do, and give to every man ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to his way, whoſe heart thou know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eſt, for thou, even thou only, knoweſt the hearts of all the children of men; that they may fear thee, all the days which they live in the Land which thou gaveſt to their Fathers.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>You ſee here that in caſe of any pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lick Judgment or Calamity the Humilia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion and Repentance of a Nation muſt begin with particular Perſons: <hi>What prayer or ſupplication ſo-ever be made by any man, or by all thy People</hi> Iſrael, WHO SHALL KNOW EVERY MAN THE PLAGUE OF HIS OWN HEART: <hi>Then hear thou in Heaven thy dwelling-place, and forgive.</hi> Particular perſons muſt be convinced of their perſonal Sins and Tranſgreſſions, before God will hear the Prayers and forgive the Sins of a Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion.</p>
                  <p>And becauſe we cannot perform this part of confeſſing and bewailing our own perſonal Sins, and of teſtifying our par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticular Repentance for them, in the pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lick Congregation, any otherwiſe than by joining with them in a general Humi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liation and Repentance; therefore we ſhould do well, on the Day before the
<pb n="308" facs="tcp:33693:163"/>
publick Faſt, or at leaſt the Morning be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore we go to the publick Aſſembly, to humble our ſelves before God in our Families, and eſpecially in our Cloſets; confeſſing to Him, with great ſhame and ſorrow, all the particular Sins and Offen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces, together with the ſeveral Aggrava<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions of them, which we have been guil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty of againſt the Divine Majeſty, ſo far as we are able to call them particularly to our remembrance; and earneſtly to beg of God the pardon and forgiveneſs of them, for his Mercies ſake in <hi>Jeſus Chriſt.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>And ſo likewiſe, after we return from the Church, we ſhould retire again into our Cloſets, and there renew our Repen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance, with moſt ſerious and ſincere Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolutions of reforming in all thoſe parti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culars which we have confeſſed and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pented of. And if we would have our Reſolutions to come to any good, we muſt make them as diſtinct and particu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lar as we can; and charge it upon our ſelves, as to ſuch and ſuch Sins, for which we have declared our ſorrow and repentance, that we will amend and do better for the future.</p>
                  <p>And we ſhould endeavour alſo, to for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tifie theſe good Reſolutions, in the beſt
<pb n="309" facs="tcp:33693:163"/>
manner we can, by ſerious conſideration and by ſolemn promiſes of better obedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence, and of a more conſcientious Care of our Lives and all our Actions for the future: And then, with the greateſt ear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſtneſs and importunity, we ſhould im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plore the Aſſiſtance of God's Grace and Holy Spirit to this purpoſe.</p>
                  <p>By this means the great End of a ſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lemn Faſt and Humiliation will be in ſome good Meaſure attain'd, and not wholly defeated, as for the moſt part it is, by being hudled up and loſt in a confuſed and general Repentance, which common<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly ends together with the publick Aſſem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bly, without any real and permanent Ef<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect upon particular Perſons: Perhaps a great part of the Congregation may have been in ſome degree ſorry for their Sins; but after all no man forſakes them, nor is the better for his ſorrow, but leaves that behind him in the Church, and car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries home with him the ſame Affection for his Sins which he had before, and a ſecret Reſolution not to leave them.</p>
                  <p>Thus it was with the People of the <hi>Jews.</hi> They had their ſolemn monthly Faſts, in which they made a great ſhew of Humiliation, <hi>hanging down their heads like a bulruſh for a day, and ſpreading ſack<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cloth
<pb n="310" facs="tcp:33693:164"/>
and aſhes under them:</hi> But there was no inward change of their minds, no re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>al Reformation of their Lives; and aſſoon as ever the publick Solemnity was over, they turned every one to his former evil Courſe.<note place="margin">Jer. 8.6.</note> So God complains of them; <hi>I hearkned,</hi> ſays He, <hi>and I heard, but they ſpake not aright; no man repented him of his wickedneſs, ſaying, what have I done? but they turned every one to his courſe, as the horſe ruſheth into the battel. They ſpake not aright,</hi> that is, they did not take the right Method for an effectual Repentance: They humbled themſelves indeed before God, and repented at ran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom for the Sins of the Nation in gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral, which they were all of them ready enough to acknowledge, and to lay a hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vy load of guilt upon the Community: But all this while, they never reflected upon themſelves in particular; they had no ſenſe, no conviction of their own per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſonal faults and miſcarriages, without which there can be no true general Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pentance: <hi>No man repented of his wicked<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs, ſaying, what have I done?</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>And as they had no ſenſe of their own particular Sins which they had been guil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty of, ſo they had no thought of leaving them; but aſſoon as ever the publick
<pb n="311" facs="tcp:33693:164"/>
Faſting and Humiliation was over, they re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turn'd to them again with the ſame eager and furious Appetite; <hi>they turned every one to his courſe, as the horſe ruſheth into the battel,</hi> that is, without any conſidera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, or ſenſe of danger.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Secondly,</hi> We ſhould likewiſe upon this <hi>Day,</hi> heartily lament and bewail the Sins of others; eſpecially the great and crying Sins of the Nation committed by all Ranks and Orders of men amongſt us, and whereby the wrath and indignation of Almighty God hath been ſo juſtly in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cenſed againſt us.</p>
                  <p>This hath been the temper and pra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctice of good men in all Ages, to be greatly troubled and afflicted for the Sins of others, as well as for their own; to mourn for them in ſecret, as the Prophet <hi>Jeremy</hi> does for the obſtinacy and impe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nitency of the <hi>Jews,</hi> and for the terrible Judgments and Calamities which their Sins were ready to bring down upon them: <hi>But if ye will not return,</hi>
                     <note place="margin">Jer. 13.17.</note> ſays he to that obdurate People, <hi>my ſoul ſhall weep in ſecret places for your pride,</hi> or ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtinacy; <hi>and mine eyes ſhall weep ſore and run down with tears, becauſe the Lord's Flock is carried away captive.</hi> And in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed almoſt the whole Prophecy of <hi>Jere<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>my,</hi>
                     <pb n="312" facs="tcp:33693:165"/>
and his Book of <hi>Lamentations,</hi> are little elſe but a perpetual Humiliation and Mourning for the Sins of that People, and for the Judgments of God which he ſaw already inflicted, or foreſaw to be coming upon them.</p>
                  <p>We reade likewiſe of <hi>Lot,</hi> when he dwelt in <hi>Sodom,</hi> how <hi>he was vexed with the filthy converſation of the wicked: For that righteous man,</hi> ſaith St. <hi>Peter, dwel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling among them, in ſeeing and hearing vex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed his righteous ſoul, from day to day, with their unlawful deeds.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Holy <hi>David</hi> alſo, upon all occaſions, teſtifies his great trouble and grief for the Sins which he ſaw committed by o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers, and was ſo affected with them that he trembled at the very thought of them: <hi>Rivers of tears,</hi>
                     <note place="margin">Pſal. 119.36.</note> ſays he, <hi>run down mine eyes, becauſe men keep not thy Law:</hi> And in the ſame <hi>Pſalm,</hi>
                     <note place="margin">v. 53.</note> 
                     <hi>Horrour hath taken hold of me, becauſe of the wicked which forſake thy Law:</hi>
                     <note place="margin">v. 158.</note> And again, <hi>I beheld the tranſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>greſſours and was grieved, becauſe they kept not thy Word.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>And how does <hi>Daniel</hi> humble himſelf before God and mourn, and in the Name of all the People, and of all Degrees and Orders of men among them, take ſhame to himſelf and them, for the great Sins
<pb n="313" facs="tcp:33693:165"/>
which they had been guilty of?<note place="margin">Dan. 9.5, 7, 8.</note> 
                     <hi>We have ſinned, and have committed iniquity, and have done wickedly: O Lord, righteouſneſs belongeth unto thee, but unto us confuſion of face, as at this day: To our Kings, to our Princes, and to our Fathers, becauſe we have ſinned againſt thee.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>With what trouble and confuſion does <hi>Ezra,</hi> upon a ſolemn Day of Faſting and Humiliation, acknowledge and bewail the Sins of the People? <hi>O my God,</hi> ſays he,<note place="margin">Ezr. 9.6, 7.</note> 
                     <hi>I am aſhamed and bluſh to lift up my face to thee my God: For our iniquities are increa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed over our heads, and our treſpaſſes grown up unto the heavens: Since the days of our Fathers, we have been in a great treſpaſs unto this day; and for our iniquities have we, our Kings and our Prieſts been deli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vered into the hands of the Kings of the Lands,</hi> &amp;c.</p>
                  <p>And thus alſo ought we, the People of this ſinful Land, upon this ſolemn Day of Faſting and Humiliation, to ſet our Sins in order before us, with all their heinous Aggravations; and in the bitterneſs of our ſouls to lament and bewail that gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral prevalence of Impiety and Vice which hath over-ſpread the Nation, and diffuſed it ſelf through all Ranks and Degrees of men, <hi>Magiſtrates, Miniſters</hi> and <hi>People.</hi>
                     <pb n="314" facs="tcp:33693:166"/>
I ſhall ſpeak ſomething more particularly concerning each of theſe.</p>
                  <p n="1">1. The Sins of the <hi>Magiſtrates</hi> and thoſe that are in Authority. They that make Laws for others, and are to ſee to the execution of them, ought to be ſtrict obſervers of them themſelves. For it muſt needs put a man not a little out of countenance to be ſevere upon thoſe faults in others of which he knows himſelf to be notoriouſly guilty. And yet how ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny are there, whoſe place and duty it is to correct the vices and immoralities of others, who are far from being examples of vertue themſelves? And therefore it is no wonder that there is ſo lame and unequal a diſtribution of juſtice in the Nation, and that Magiſtrates are ſo cold and ſlack in the diſcountenancing of Vice and Impiety, and in putting the good and wholeſome Laws made againſt them in execution: As againſt the profanation of the Lord's Day, by ſecular buſineſs, by vain ſports and paſtimes, which by the very nature of them are apt to diſſolve the minds of men into mirth and plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure, and to carry them off from all ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rious thoughts of God and Religion, and from the Meditations of another World; and to give the Devil an advantage, and
<pb n="315" facs="tcp:33693:166"/>
an opportunity, which be never fails to take, to ſteal <hi>the good ſeed,</hi> the Word of God, which they have heard that Day, out of their hearts, and to make it of none effect: And which is yet worſe, by lewd and ſinful practices, which are unlawful at any time, but upon that Day, are a double breach and violation of God's Law.</p>
                  <p>And likewiſe by neglecting to put in execution the Laws againſt profane <hi>Swearing</hi> and <hi>Curſing,</hi> for which the Land mourns; and againſt <hi>Drunkenneſs,</hi> and <hi>Adultery,</hi> and <hi>Fornication,</hi> which are ſo common, and ſo impudently committed amongſt us: whether they be Civil, or Eccleſiaſtical Laws; and it is hard to ſay which of them are moſt remiſly execu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted.</p>
                  <p>And to mention no more, by neglecting to proſecute that horrible Sin of <hi>Murther,</hi> ſo frequently now committed in our Streets beyond the example of former Ages, with that ſeverity and impartiality which is neceſſary to free the Nation from the guilt of that crying Sin, which calls ſo loud to Heaven for Vengeance.</p>
                  <p>And all this, notwithſtanding the Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>giſtrates are under the Oath of God to put the Laws in due execution againſt all
<pb n="316" facs="tcp:33693:167"/>
theſe Crimes, ſo far as they come to their knowledge, and fall under their cogni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſance.</p>
                  <p n="2">2. The Sins of the <hi>Miniſters,</hi> who ſerve at God's Altar, and watch over the Souls of men, whoſe bloud will be required at their hands, if any of them periſh through their fault and neglect. There is no rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon to doubt, but that there are a good number of faithful Shepherds in the Land, who watch over their Flocks with great care and conſcience, remembring the dreadful Account which they muſt one Day make to <hi>Him who ſhall judge the quick and dead,</hi> of the Souls committed to their charge.</p>
                  <p>But yet how groſly do many of us fail of the faithful diſcharge of the ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtantial parts of this high Office? want<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing a juſt ſenſe of the ineſtimable worth and value of the Souls of men for whom Chriſt died; taking little or no care to inſtruct them in the good knowledge of the Lord, and to lead them in the way to eternal happineſs by an exemplary con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſation.</p>
                  <p>Nay too many among us demean themſelves ſo ſcandalouſly, as perfectly to undermine the credit and effect of their Doctrine by leading lives ſo direct<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
<pb n="317" facs="tcp:33693:167"/>
contrary to it; and to alienate their People from the Church, and to make them to abhorr the Sacrifice and Service of the Lord by their wicked and unhal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowed Converſations: hereby expoſing them to the craft of Seducers, and ren<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dring them an eaſie prey to the <hi>Emiſſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries</hi> of the Church of <hi>Rome,</hi> or to any other Sect and Faction that pretends a greater zeal for Religion, or makes a bet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter ſhew of a ſtrict and unblameable life.</p>
                  <p>For who will regard or believe thoſe Teachers, who give all the evidence that can be by their lives and actions, that they do not believe themſelves and their own Doctrines? When all is ſaid, the life and manners of the Preacher are the beſt eloquence, and have that dint and power of perſuaſion in them, which no words, no art can equal. Who ſo lives as he ſpeaks, does, as it is ſaid of our Bleſſed <hi>Saviour, Speaks as one that hath autho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity, and not as the Scribes: Not as the Scribes</hi>; whoſe words, notwithſtanding all the formality and gravity with which they were deliver'd, did therefore want weight and force, becauſe, as our <hi>Savi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>our</hi> tells us of them, <hi>they ſaid, but did not</hi>; their Lives were not anſwerable to
<pb n="318" facs="tcp:33693:168"/>
their Doctrines: Whereas our Bleſſed Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viour therefore <hi>ſpoke as never man ſpake,</hi> becauſe he liv'd as never man liv'd; ſo innocent, ſo uſeful, ſo exemplary a life: He <hi>was holy, harmleſs, and undefil'd:</hi> He <hi>did no ſin, neither was guile found in his lips:</hi> He <hi>fulfilled all righteouſneſs, and went about doing good.</hi> This was that which made Him ſo powerful <hi>a Preacher of Righ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teouſneſs</hi>; and we muſt neceſſarily fall ſo much ſhort of <hi>Him</hi> in the authority and efficacy of our <hi>Sermons,</hi> as we do in the holineſs and goodneſs of our <hi>Lives.</hi> Such a Preacher, and ſuch a practice as that of our Bleſſed <hi>Saviour</hi> was, is every way fit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted to reprove, and perſuade, and reform Mankind.</p>
                  <p>We now live in an Age and Church, wherein they who are called to be the Teachers and Guides of Souls ought to take great heed both to their Doctrine and their Lives; that the Name of God may not be blaſphem'd, and his holy Religion be brought into contempt by thoſe, who, above all others, are moſt nearly concern'd to preſerve and ſupport the credit and honour of it.</p>
                  <p>And we cannot but ſee, how our Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion and Church are beſet and endan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger'd on every ſide; by the rude aſſaults
<pb n="319" facs="tcp:33693:168"/>
of Infidelity, and by the cunning Arts of ſeducing Spirits, and by our own in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teſtine Heats and Diviſions: And it can never be ſufficiently lamented, no though it were with tears of bloud, that we whoſe particular charge and employ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment it is to build up the Souls of Men in a holy Faith, and in the reſolution of a good Life, ſhould, for want of due in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtruction, and by the diſſolute and pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fligate lives of too many among us, and by inflaming our needleſs Differences a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout leſſer things, have ſo great a hand in pulling down Religion, and in betray<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the Souls of Men either to down<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>right Infidelity, or to a careleſs neglect and profane contempt of all Religion.</p>
                  <p>May not God juſtly expoſtulate this matter with us, as he did of old with the People of the <hi>Jews?</hi>
                     <note place="margin">Jer. 5.30, 31.</note> 
                     <hi>A wonderful and hor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rible thing is committed in the Land; the Prophets propheſy falſly, and the Prieſts bear rule by their means, and my People love to have it ſo; and what will ye doe in the end thereof?</hi> When they who are the Paſtors and Guides of Souls, have by their ill conduct and management brought matters to that paſs, that the generality of the People ſit down con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tented with the worſt ſtate of things,
<pb n="320" facs="tcp:33693:169"/>

                  <p>
                     <hi>Thirdly,</hi> We ſhould likewiſe, upon this Day, earneſtly deprecate God's diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pleaſure,

and make our humble Suppli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cations to Him, that He would be graci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ouſly pleas'd to avert thoſe terrible Judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments which hang over us, and which we have juſt cauſe to fear may fall upon us; and that He would be entreated by us at laſt to be appeas'd towards us, and to turn from the fierceneſs of his An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger.</p>
                  <p>This we find the People of God were wont to do upon their Solemn days of Faſting and Prayer; and this God ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſsly enjoyns:<note place="margin">Joel 2.15, 16, 17.</note> 
                     <hi>Blow the Trumpet in Zion, ſanctifie a Faſt, call a ſolemn Aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſembly; gather the People, ſanctifie the Congregation, aſſemble the Elders,</hi> &amp;c. <hi>Let the Prieſts, the Miniſters of the Lord, weep between the Porch and the Altar, and let them ſay, Spare thy People, O Lord, and give not thy heritage to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proach, that the Heathen ſhould rule over them: Wherefore ſhould they ſay among the People, Where is their God?</hi>

                     <hi>O Lord, according to all thy righ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teouſneſs, I beſeech thee, let thine anger and thy fury be turned away from thy City</hi> Jeruſalem, <hi>thy Holy Mountain: Becauſe for our ſins, and for the iniquity of our Fathers,</hi> Jeruſalem <hi>and thy People are be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come a reproach to all that are about us.

we ſo righteouſly have deſerv'd, and to which the great and crying Sins of the whole Nation have ſo juſtly expoſed us: Humbly beſeeching Him, not for our Righteouſneſs, but for his great Mercy; for his own Name's ſake, and becauſe we are his People and are called by his Name, and becauſe his Holy Truth and Religion are profeſs'd amongſt us; that He would be pleas'd to hear the Prayers of his Servants and their Supplications which they have made before him this Day, <hi>for the Lord's ſake.</hi>

                  <p>
                     <hi>Fourthly,</hi> We ſhould likewiſe, upon this Day, pour out our moſt earneſt Supplications to Almighty God, for the preſervation of Their <hi>Majeſties</hi> Sacred Perſons, and for the proſperity and eſta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bliſhment of Their Government, and for the good Succeſs of Their Arms and Forces by Sea and Land.</p>
                  <p>And more eſpecially, ſince His <hi>Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jeſty,</hi> with ſo many Confederate Princes and States of <hi>Europe,</hi> is engaged in ſo neceſſary an Undertaking for the Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon good of <hi>Chriſtendom,</hi> and for the mutual preſervation and recovery of Their reſpective Rights: We ſhould ear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſtly implore the favour and aſſiſtance of Almighty God in ſo juſt and glorious

a Cauſe, againſt the common Invader and Oppreſſor of the Rights and Liber<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties of Mankind.</p>
                  <p>And that of his infinite Goodneſs He would be graciouſly pleaſed to take the Perſon of our <hi>Sovereign Lord</hi> the <hi>King</hi> into the particular care and protection of his Providence: That He would ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cure his precious Life from all ſecret At<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tempts, and from open Violence: That He would give his Angels charge over him, and cover his Head in the day of Battel, and crown it with Victory over his Enemies, and reſtore Him to us a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gain in ſafety.</p>
                  <p>And that He would likewiſe preſerve and direct the <hi>Queen's Majeſty,</hi> in whoſe hands the Adminiſtration of the Govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment is at preſent ſo happily plac'd: That He would give Her Wiſdom and Reſolution for ſuch a Time as this, and ſupport and carry Her through all the Difficulties of it.</p>
                  <p>And, Laſtly, That He would bleſs them Both with a long Life, and a peace<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full and happy Reign over us; that <hi>un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der them we may live quiet and peaceable lives in all godlineſs and honeſty.</hi>

                  <p>
                     <hi>Fifthly,</hi> Our Faſting and Humiliation ſhould be accompanied with our Alms
<pb n="327" facs="tcp:33693:172"/>
and Charity to the poor and needy: And we ſhould every one of us, accord<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to the counſel given by the Prophet to King <hi>Nebuchadnezzar,</hi>
                     <note place="margin">Dan. 4.27.</note> 
                     <hi>break off our ſins by righteouſneſs, and our iniquities by ſhew<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing mercy to the poor, if it may be a length<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning of our tranquillity:</hi> Hereby intima<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting, that if there be any way to prevent or remove the Judgments of God, and to prolong the tranquillity and happineſs of Prince and People, a ſincere Repen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance, and a great Charity to them that are in neceſſity and diſtreſs, are moſt likely to prevail with God, not only to reſpite the ruine of a ſinful People, but to incline Him to thoughts of peace to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards them: For ſo he promiſeth to the <hi>Jews</hi> upon their ſincere Repentance, and earneſt Supplication to Him, which are always accompanied with Charity to the Poor:<note place="margin">Jer. 29.11, 12, 13.</note> 
                     <hi>For I know the thoughts which I think towards you, ſaith the Lord, thoughts of peace, and not of evil, to give you an unexpected end: Then ſhall ye call upon me, and ye ſhall go and pray unto me, and I will hearken unto you: And ye ſhall ſeek me, and find me, when ye ſhall ſearch for me with all your heart.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>And I have often thought that the ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>traordinary Charity of this whole Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion,
<pb n="328" facs="tcp:33693:173"/>
and of our pious Princes, who are ſo ready to every good work, and ſuch bright and ſhining Examples in this kind, more than once ſo ſeaſonably extended to the relief of our diſtreſſed Brethren, who fled hither for refuge from the Rage and Cruelty of their Perſecutors: I ſay, I have often thought, that this very thing, next to the infinite Mercy and Goodneſs of Almighty God, hath had a very particular influence upon our pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſervation and deliverance from thoſe ter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rible Calamities which were juſt ready to ruſh in upon us. And what cauſe have we to thank God, who hath al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lotted to us this more bleſſed and mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciful part, to <hi>give</hi> and not to <hi>receive</hi>; to be free from Perſecution our ſelves, that ſo we might be in a capacity to give refuge and relief to them that were perſecuted?</p>
                  <p>There are but few that have the faith to believe it, but certainly Charity to the Poor is a great ſecurity to us in times of evil: So <hi>David</hi> aſſures us, ſpeak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of the <hi>Righteous</hi> or <hi>Charitable</hi> Man; <hi>He ſhall not,</hi> ſays he, <hi>be afraid in the e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vil time, and in the days of Dearth he ſhall be ſatisfied.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>
                     <pb n="329" facs="tcp:33693:173"/>And ſo likewiſe in Times of publick Diſtreſs, when we are beſet with cruel and powerful Enemies, who if God were not on our ſide would ſwallow us up, the publick Charity of a Nation hath many times prov'd its beſt ſafeguard and ſhield: <hi>It ſhall fight for thee,</hi> ſaith the Son of <hi>Sirach,</hi> ſpeaking of the Charity of Alms, <hi>againſt thine Enemy, more than a mighty ſhield and ſtrong ſpear.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>And of this, as I ſaid before, I doubt not but We of this Nation, by the great Mercy and Goodneſs of God to us, have had happy experience in our late wonderful Deliverance under the Conduct and Valour of one of the beſt and braveſt of Princes; to whom by too many among us, the moſt unworthy and unthankful returns have been made for all the unwearied pains he hath un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dergone, and for the many deſperate ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zards to which he hath expoſed himſelf for our ſakes, that ever were made to ſo great and generous a Benefactor: To ſo great a Benefactor, I ſay, not only to theſe Nations, but even to all <hi>Europe,</hi> in aſſerting and maintaining their Liberties againſt the inſolent pride and unjuſt en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>croachments of one of the greateſt Op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſors the World hath known for ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny
<pb n="330" facs="tcp:33693:174"/>
Ages: Of whom it may be ſaid as <hi>Job</hi> doth of the <hi>Leviathan,</hi>
                     <note place="margin">Job 41.33, 34.</note> 
                     <hi>
                        <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>pon the earth there is not his like:</hi> I am glad I cannot apply what immediately follows, That <hi>he is made without fear</hi>; but ſurely the next words are appoſite enough, <hi>He beholdeth all high things, and is King of all the children of pride:</hi> And yet <hi>He that is higher than the higheſt,</hi> even <hi>He that ſitteth in the Heavens doth laugh at him, for He ſeeth that his Day is coming.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>To conclude this <hi>Particular</hi>; If we would have our Prayers aſcend up to Heaven, and find acceptance there, our Alms muſt go along with them: So the <hi>Angel</hi> intimates when he ſays to <hi>Corne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lius,</hi>
                     <note place="margin">Acts 10.4.</note> 
                     <hi>Thy Prayers and thine Alms are gone up for a memorial before God:</hi> Thy <hi>Pray<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers</hi> and thine <hi>Alms</hi>; they muſt go to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether if we deſire that our Prayers ſhould be effectual. And the Prophet <hi>Iſaiah,</hi> ſpeaking of the <hi>Faſt which God hath choſen,</hi> and which is <hi>acceptable</hi> to Him, makes Charity and Alms a moſt eſſential part of it: <hi>Is it not,</hi> ſays he, <hi>to deal thy bread to the hungry,</hi>
                     <note place="margin">Iſa. 58.7, 9.</note> 
                     <hi>and that thou bring the poor that are caſt out to thy houſe; when thou ſeeſt the naked that thou cover him, and that thou hide not
<pb n="331" facs="tcp:33693:174"/>
thy ſelf from thine own fleſh? Then ſhalt thou call, and the Lord ſhall anſwer; thou ſhalt cry, and He ſhall ſay, Here I am.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Sixthly</hi> and <hi>Laſtly,</hi> We ſhould proſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cute our Repentance and good Reſoluti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons to the actual Reformation and A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mendment of our Lives. For in <hi>this</hi> Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pentance doth mainly conſiſt: This is the proper fruit and effect of all our Hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miliation and good Reſolutions, to for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſake our ſins, and to become better for the future; more pious and devout to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards God, more ſober and chaſt with regard to our ſelves, more juſt and cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritable, more humble and meek towards all men: In a word, more innocent, more uſeful, and more <hi>holy in all man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner of converſation.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>And without this, all our Faſting and Humiliation, our moſt earneſt Prayers and Supplications, will ſignifie nothing: All our Sorrow and Tears will be but as water ſpilt upon the ground, and will not turn to any account either to ſave our own Souls, or to preſerve <hi>this unto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward Generation, this crooked and per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſe Nation,</hi> from ruin and deſtruction. So God tells <hi>Solomon,</hi> that this is the only way to appeaſe and reconcile Him to a ſinful People:<note place="margin">2 Chron. 7.14.</note> 
                     <hi>If my People which is
<pb n="332" facs="tcp:33693:175"/>
called by my Name ſhall humble them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves, and pray, and ſeek my face, and turn from their wicked ways: Then will I hear in Heaven, and forgive their ſin, and heal their Land.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>And if this were the happy effect of our Prayers and Humiliation this Day, to <hi>turn us from our wicked ways</hi>;<note place="margin">Zech. 8.19.</note> God would then turn away his anger from us; and, as he promiſed to the <hi>Jews</hi> by the Prophet <hi>Zachary,</hi> He would turn theſe our Monthly Faſts <hi>into joy, and gladneſs, and cheerful Feaſts</hi>; as he hath in a great meaſure already done, <hi>Bleſſed be his great and glorious Name.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>But if we will not hearken and obey, can we expect that God ſhould deliver us from the hands of our Enemies, that we may ſin againſt Him without fear all the days of our Lives? To what pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe ſhould the Providence of God take ſo much care to preſerve our Religion to us, when we make no better uſe of it for the direction and government of our Lives? When it ſerves moſt of us, only to talk of it; and too many a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mongſt us, to talk againſt it; to deride it, and deſpitefully to uſe it. If this be the truth of our Caſe, what can we ſay, why the Kingdom of God ſhould not be
<pb n="333" facs="tcp:33693:175"/>
taken from us and given to a Nation that will bring forth the fruits of it? What can we ſay, why our Candleſtick ſhould not be remov'd, and the light of the glorious Goſpel of <hi>Chriſt</hi> which we have ſo long enjoyed, and ſo long re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>belled againſt, ſhould not be utterly ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinguiſh'd amongſt us?</p>
                  <p>And if I cannot prevail with you to come to theſe good Reſolutions, and to make them good: If you will not be perſuaded to practiſe, yet be pleas'd to attend to what we ſay: Hear our words at leaſt, if ye will not do them. This the People of the <hi>Jews</hi> would do, when they were at the worſt: So God tells the <hi>Prophet</hi> concerning them:<note place="margin">Ezek. 33.31.</note> 
                     <hi>They come unto thee, as the People cometh; and they ſit before thee, as my People; and they hear thy words, but they will not do them.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>I had much rather at any time have occaſion to praiſe than to reprove, eſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cially in this great Aſſembly: And yet it is not to be diſſembled, that the be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>haviour of too many in this place is fre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quently ſo careleſs and irreverent, as is very miſ-becoming thoſe who are in the more peculiar Preſence of the Great and Glorious <hi>Majeſty of Heaven and
<pb n="334" facs="tcp:33693:176"/>
Earth,</hi> and profeſs at that very time to worſhip Him.</p>
                  <p>I am ſure, we have a better Pattern perpetually before us; of a decent and unaffected devotion, of a moſt ſerious and ſteddy attention, without wandring, without diverſion, and without drowſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs: ſuch an Example as I cannot but hope will in a ſhort time gain upon us all, and by a more gentle and ſilent re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proof win us to the imitation of it.</p>
                  <p>And if we could but be prevail'd up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on to demean our ſelves with that Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verence, and to hear with that Atten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, which becomes the Worſhip and the Word of God, it might then be hop'd that we would conſider what is ſaid; and conſideration would probably work conviction, and conviction bring us to a better mind, and to a firm pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe of doing what we are inwardly convinc'd it is both our duty and our intereſt to do.</p>
                  <p>Let us then go away from this So<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lemnity, with a reſolution to do every one what we ought; truly and earneſtly to repent us of our ſins paſt, and to lead a new life for the future; to fear that <hi>great and terrible God,</hi> in whoſe preſence we have humbled our ſelves this Day;
<pb n="335" facs="tcp:33693:176"/>

                  <p>THE deſign of this <hi>Pſalm</hi> is to vindicate the Goodneſs and Ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtice of the Divine Providence, notwithſtanding the proſperous eſtate of the wicked and the afflicted condition of good men many times in this World. And in the firſt place, the <hi>Pſalmiſt,</hi> who<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever he was, whether <hi>David</hi> or <hi>Aſaph,</hi> lays down this for a moſt certain Truth, that God is good to good men:<note place="margin">Ver. 1.</note> 
                     <hi>Of a truth God is good to</hi> Iſrael, <hi>to ſuch as are of a clean heart.</hi>

                     <pb n="340" facs="tcp:33693:179"/>And yet for all this he tells us, that at ſome times he was under no ſmall temptation to queſtion the truth of this <hi>Principle,</hi> when he beheld the promiſcu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous diſpenſation of things here below; that the wicked are often proſperous, and good men expoſed to great calamities in this life; as if God either neglected hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mane affairs, or had a greater kindneſs for the workers of iniquity than for pi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous and good men: <hi>As for me, my foot had well-nigh ſlipp'd,</hi>
                     <note place="margin">Ver. 2.</note> 
                     <hi>for I was envious at the fooliſh, when I ſaw the proſperity of the wicked.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>This, he ſays, was a very great ſlum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bling-block to good men, and tempted them to doubt of the Providence of God: <hi>Therefore his People return hither,</hi>

                     <hi>and waters of a full cup are wrung out to them; and they ſay, Doth God know, and is there knowledge in the moſt High?</hi> This Sen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tence is ſomewhat obſcurely rendred in our <hi>Tranſlation,</hi> ſo as to make the ſence of it difficult; which is plainly this: <hi>There<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore his people return hither</hi>; that is, there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore good men come to this, in the great<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs of their affliction, and in the bit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terneſs of their ſoul, to queſtion God's knowledge and care of humane affairs.</p>

                     <hi>theſe are the ungod<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, and yet they are the proſperous in the world, they increaſe in riches:</hi> To what purpoſe then is it for any man to be Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligious and Vertuous? <hi>Verily,</hi>
                     <note place="margin">Ver. 13.</note> 
                     <hi>I have cleanſed my heart in vain, and waſhed my hands in innocency:</hi> In vain have I endea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>voured after purity of heart and inno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cency of life, ſince ſo little good comes of it; nay, ſo far from that, that I have been in continual trouble and affliction:<note place="margin">Ver. 14.</note> 
                     <hi>All the day long have I been plagued, and chaſtned every morning.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Such thoughts as theſe often came in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to his mind, and gave him great trou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble and diſquiet: But he preſently cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rects himſelf: <hi>If I ſay I will ſpeak thus,</hi>
                     <note place="margin">Ver. 15.</note>
                     <hi>I ſhould offend againſt the generation of thy Children</hi>; that is, I ſhould go againſt the ſenſe of all pious and good men, who have always believed the Providence of God notwithſtanding this Objection: Which at laſt he tells us he had raiſed on purpoſe to try if he could find the ſolution of it: <hi>I thought to know this,</hi>
                     <note place="margin">Ver. 16.</note> 
                     <hi>which was grievous in mine eyes:</hi> And then he reſolves all into the unſearchable Wiſdom of the Divine Providence, which if we fully underſtood from firſt to laſt, we ſhould ſee good reaſon to be ſatisfied
<pb n="342" facs="tcp:33693:180"/>
with the equity of it: <hi>When I go into the Sanctuary of God,</hi>
                     <note place="margin">Ver. 17, 18.</note> 
                     <hi>then ſhall I underſtand the end of theſe men? How thou didſt ſet them in ſlippery places,</hi> &amp;c. This ſatis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fied him, that when-ever the ſecret de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſign of God's Providence ſhould be un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>folded, whether in this World or the o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, how ſtrange and croſs ſoever things might ſeem to be at preſent, yet in the iſſue and concluſion it would appear, that neither are bad men ſo happy, nor good men ſo miſerable, as at preſent they may ſeem to be.</p>
                  <p>So that upon a full debate of this mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter, the <hi>Pſalmiſt</hi> concludes, that theſe Objections againſt Providence do ſpring from our ignorance, and ſhort and imper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect view of things; whereas if we ſaw the whole deſign from beginning to end, it would appear to be very reaſonable and regular. <hi>Thus my heart was grieved; ſo fooliſh was I and ignorant,</hi>
                     <note place="margin">Ver. 21.</note> 
                     <hi>and as a beaſt before thee.</hi> And in regard to himſelf, he tells us, that he ſaw great reaſon to ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>knowledge God's tender care over him in particular, and that he could find no ſecurity or comfort for himſelf, but in God alone:<note place="margin">Ver. 23.</note> 
                     <hi>Nevertheleſs I am continually with thee; thou haſt holden me by thy right hand: Thou ſhalt guide me with thy coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſel,
<pb n="343" facs="tcp:33693:180"/>
and afterwards receive me to glory</hi>; as if he had ſaid, I am ſenſible of thy conſtant preſence with me, and care of me; and do entirely depend upon thy guidance and direction, not doubting but that my preſent troubles and afflictions will have a happy and glorious iſſue.</p>
                  <p>And at laſt he breaks out into a kind of exultation and triumph for the migh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty conſolation which he found in the firm belief of the <hi>Being</hi> and <hi>Providence</hi> of God, as the great ſtay and ſupport of his Soul in the worſt condition that could befall him; in the words of the <hi>Text, Whom have I in Heaven but thee? and there is none upon Earth that I deſire be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſides thee.</hi> If a man were to chuſe a hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pineſs for himſelf, and were to ranſack Heaven and Earth for it, after all his ſearch and enquiry he would at laſt fix upon God as the chief happineſs of man, and the true and only reſt and center of our Souls. This then is the plain meaning of the <hi>Text, That nothing in the world but God can make man happy: Whom have I in Heaven but thee? and there is none upon Earth that I deſire beſides thee.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>That Man of himſelf is not ſufficient for his own happineſs, is evident upon many accounts: Becauſe he is liable to
<pb n="344" facs="tcp:33693:181"/>
ſo many evils and calamities, which he can neither prevent, nor remedy: He is full of wants which he cannot ſupply; compaſſed about with infirmities which he can only complain of, but is not able to redreſs: He is obnoxious to dangers which he muſt always fear, becauſe he can never ſufficiently provide againſt them.</p>
                  <p>Conſider Man by himſelf, and from under the conduct and protection of a ſuperior and more powerful Being, and he is in a moſt diſconſolate and forlorn condition: Secure of nothing that he en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>joys, and liable to be diſappointed of eve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry thing that he hopes for: He is apt to grieve for what he cannot help, and per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>haps the juſteſt cauſe of his grief is that he cannot help it; for if he could, in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtead of grieving for it, he would help it: He cannot refrain from deſiring a great many things which he would fain have, but is never likely to obtain, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe they are out of his power; and it troubles him both that they are ſo, and that he cannot help his being troubled at it.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Thus man walketh in a vain ſhew, and diſquieteth himſelf in vain</hi>; courting happineſs in a thouſand ſhapes, and the
<pb n="345" facs="tcp:33693:181"/>
faſter he follows it, the ſwifter it flies from him. Almoſt every thing promi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeth happineſs to us at a diſtance, ſuch a ſtep of Honour, ſuch a pitch of Eſtate, ſuch a Fortune or Match for a Child: But when we come nearer to it, either we fall ſhort of it, or it falls ſhort of our expectation; and it is hard to ſay which of theſe is the greateſt diſappointment. Our hopes are uſually bigger than enjoy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment can ſatisfie, and an evil long fear'd, beſides that it may never come, is ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny times more painful and troubleſome than the evil it ſelf when it comes.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>In a word, man is born to trouble as the ſparks fly upwards.</hi> He comes into the world naked and unarm'd, and from him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf more deſtitute of the natural means of his ſecurity and ſupport than any other Creature whatſoever, as it were on pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe to ſhew that he is more peculiarly the care of a Superior Providence: And as man, of all the Creatures of this lower World, is only made to own and ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>knowledge a Deity; ſo God in great Wiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom hath ſo order'd things, that none of the other Creatures ſhould have ſo much need of Him, and ſo much reaſon to acknowledge their neceſſary depen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dance upon him. So that the words of
<pb n="346" facs="tcp:33693:182"/>
                     <hi>David</hi> are the very ſenſe and voice of Nature, declaring to us that Mankind is born into the World upon terms of grea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter dependence upon the Providence of God than other Creatures: <hi>Thou art he,</hi> ſays <hi>David</hi> there to God,<note place="margin">Pſal. 22.9, 10, 11.</note> 
                     <hi>that tookeſt me out of the womb, thou madeſt me to hope,</hi> or thou didſt keep me in ſafety, <hi>when I was upon my mother's breaſts: I was caſt upon thee from the womb, thou art my God from my mother's belly: Be not far from me, for trouble is near:</hi> Trouble is al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ways near to us, and therefore it is hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>py for us that God is never far from any of us: <hi>For in Him we live, and move, and have our being.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>And when we are grown up, we are liable to a great many miſchiefs and dan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gers, every moment of our lives; and, without the Providence of God, conti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nually inſecure not only of the good things of this life, but even of life it ſelf: So that when we come to be men, we cannot but wonder how ever we ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riv'd at that ſtate, and how we have con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinued in it ſo long, conſidering the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>finite difficulties and dangers which have continually attended us: That in run<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning the <hi>gantlope</hi> of a long life, when ſo many hands have been lifted up againſt
<pb n="347" facs="tcp:33693:182"/>
us, and ſo many ſtrokes levell'd at us, we have eſcaped ſo free, and with ſo few marks and ſcars upon us: That when we are beſieged with ſo many dan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gers, and ſo many arrows of death are perpetually flying about us, to which we do ſo many ways lie open, we ſhould yet hold out <hi>twenty, forty, ſixty</hi> years, and ſome of us perhaps longer, and do ſtill ſtand at the mark untouch'd, at leaſt not dangerouſly wounded by any of them: And conſidering likewiſe this fear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful and wonderful frame of a humane Bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy, this infinitely complicated Engine; in which, to the due performance of the ſeveral functions and offices of life, ſo many ſtrings and ſprings, ſo many re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceptacles and channels are neceſſary, and all in their right frame and order; and in which, beſides the infinite imper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceptible and ſecret ways of mortality, there are ſo many ſluces and flood-gates to let Death in and Life out, that it is next to a miracle, though we take but little notice of it, that every one of us did not die every day ſince we were born<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> I ſay, conſidering the nice and cu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rious frame of our Bodies, and the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>numerable contingencies and hazards of humane Life, which is ſet in ſo ſlippery
<pb n="348" facs="tcp:33693:183"/>
a place, that we ſtill continue in the land of the living, we cannot aſcribe to any thing but the watchful Providence of Almighty God, <hi>who holds our ſoul in life, and ſuffers not our foot to be moved.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>To the ſame merciful Providence of God we owe, that whilſt we continue in life we have any comfortable poſſeſſion and enjoyment of our ſelves and of that which makes us men, I mean our Rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon and Underſtanding: That our Ima<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gination is not let looſe upon us, to haunt and torment us with melancholick freaks and fears: That we are not deliver'd up to the horrors of a gloomy and guilty mind: That every day we do not fall into frenzy and diſtraction, which next to wickedneſs and vice is the ſoreſt cala<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mity, and ſaddeſt diſguiſe of humane Nature: I ſay, next to wickedneſs and vice, which is a wilful frenzy, a madneſs not from misfortune but from choice; whereas the <hi>other</hi> proceeds from natural and neceſſary cauſes, ſuch as are in a great meaſure out of our power; ſo that we are perpetually liable to it, from any ſecret and ſudden diſorder of the Brain, from the violence of a Diſeaſe, or the vehement tranſport of any Paſſion.</p>
                  <p>
                     <pb n="349" facs="tcp:33693:183"/>Now if things were under no govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, what could hinder ſo many pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bable evils from breaking in upon us, and from treading upon the heels of one another? like the calamities of <hi>Job,</hi> when <hi>the hedge which God had ſet about him and all that he had, was broken down and removed.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>So that if there were no God to take care of us, we could be ſecure of no ſort, no degree of happineſs in this World; no not for one moment: And there would be no other World for us to be happy in, and to make amends to us for all the fears and dangers, all the troubles and calamities of this preſent life: For God and another World ſtand and fall toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther: Without <hi>Him</hi> there can be no Life after this; and if our hopes of happineſs were only in this Life, Man of all other Beings in this lower World would cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainly be the moſt miſerable.</p>
                  <p>I cannot ſay that all the Evils which I have mentioned would happen to all, if the Providence of God did not rule the World; but that every man would be in danger of them all, and have nothing to ſupport and comfort him againſt the fear of that danger. For the Nature of Man, conſider'd by it ſelf, is plainly in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſufficient
<pb n="350" facs="tcp:33693:184"/>
for its own happineſs; ſo that we muſt neceſſarily look abroad, and ſeek for it ſomewhere elſe: And who can ſhew us that good that is equal to all the wants and neceſſities, all the capacities and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſires, all the fears and hopes of humane Nature? Whatſoever can anſwer all theſe, muſt have theſe following Properties:
<list>
                        <item>
                           <hi>Firſt,</hi> It muſt be an All-ſufficient good.</item>
                        <item>
                           <hi>Secondly,</hi> It muſt be perfect good<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs.</item>
                        <item>
                           <hi>Thirdly,</hi> It muſt be firm and un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>changeable in it ſelf.</item>
                        <item>
                           <hi>Fourthly,</hi> It muſt be ſuch a good as none can deprive us of, and take away from us.</item>
                        <item>
                           <hi>Fifthly,</hi> It muſt be eternal.</item>
                        <item>
                           <hi>Sixthly,</hi> It muſt be able to ſupport and comfort us in every condition, and under all the accidents and ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſities of humane Life.</item>
                        <item>
                           <hi>Laſtly,</hi> It muſt be ſuch a good as can give perfect reſt and tranquillity to our minds.</item>
                     </list>
                  </p>
                  <p>Nothing that is ſhort of all this can make us happy: And no Creature, no not the whole Creation, can pretend to
<pb n="351" facs="tcp:33693:184"/>
be all this to us. All theſe Properties meet only in God, who is the perfect and ſupreme Good; as I ſhall endeavour, in the following Diſcourſe, more parti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cularly to ſhew; and conſequently, <hi>That God is the only happineſs of Man.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Firſt,</hi> God is an All-ſufficient Good.<milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="I"/> And this does import <hi>two</hi> things; Wiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom to contrive our happineſs, and Power to effect it; for neither of theſe without the other is ſufficient, and both theſe in the higheſt and moſt eminent degree are in God.</p>
                  <p>He is infinitely <hi>Wiſe</hi> to deſign and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trive our happineſs; becauſe he knows what Happineſs is, and how to frame us ſo as to be capable of the happineſs he deſigns for us; and how to order and diſpoſe all other things ſo, as that they ſhall be no hindrance and impediment to it.</p>
                  <p>He perfectly underſtands all the poſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bilities of things, and how to fit means to any end. He knows all our wants, and how to ſupply them; all our hopes and deſires, and how to ſatisfie them: He fore-ſees all the dangers and evils which threaten us, and knows how to prevent or divert them, if he think fit;
<pb n="352" facs="tcp:33693:185"/>
or if he permit them to come, how to ſupport us under them, or to deliver us out of them, or to turn them to our greater benefit and advantage in the laſt iſſue and reſult of things.</p>
                  <p>His Wiſdom cannot be ſurprized by any accident which he did not fore-ſee, and which he is not ſufficiently provi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded againſt. The wiſdom of men is but ſhort and imperfect, and liable to infinite errors and miſtakes: In many caſes men know not what is ſafeſt and beſt for them, nor whether <hi>this</hi> or <hi>that</hi> will con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duce moſt to their happineſs: Nay it of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten happens that thoſe very means which the wiſeſt men chuſe for their ſecurity do prove the occaſions of their ruine, and they are thrown down by thoſe very ways whereby they thought to raiſe and to eſtabliſh themſelves.</p>
                  <p>Eſpecially if God breathe upon the Counſels of men, how are their deſigns blaſted? How are they infatuated and foil'd in their deepeſt contrivances, and <hi>ſnared in the work of their own hands?</hi> When <hi>it is of the Lord,</hi> the wiſdom of the greateſt <hi>Politicians</hi> is turned into foo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liſhneſs: For <hi>there is no wiſdom, nor un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtanding, nor counſel againſt the Lord.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>
                     <pb n="353" facs="tcp:33693:185"/>But the Divine Wiſdom, being founded upon infinite knowledge, is thereby ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cur'd againſt all poſſibility of error and miſtake. God perfectly knows the na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures and the powers of all his Creatures, and therefore can never be miſtaken in the uſe and application of them to any of his purpoſes: So that none of his de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſigns of love and mercy to the Sons of men can miſcarry for want of good con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trivance, or wiſe conduct.</p>
                  <p>And as he is perfectly <hi>wiſe</hi> to contrive our happineſs, ſo is he infinitely <hi>power<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful</hi> to effect it, and to remove out of the way all the obſtacles and impediments of it. We may underſtand many times what would conduce to our happineſs, but may not be able to compaſs it; but nothing is out of the reach of Omnipo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tency: Many things are difficult to us, but nothing is too hard for God: Many things are impoſſible with us, but <hi>with God all things are poſſible.</hi> For He is the Fountain and Original of all Power, from whom it is deriv'd and upon whom it depends, and to whom it is perfectly ſubject and ſubordinate: He can do all things at once, and in an inſtant, and with the greateſt eaſe; and no created Power can put any difficulty in his way,
<pb n="354" facs="tcp:33693:186"/>
much leſs make any effectual reſiſtance; becauſe Omnipotency can check, and countermand, and bear down before it all other Powers.</p>
                  <p>So that if God be on our ſide, who can be againſt us? We may ſafely <hi>com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mit our Souls into his hands, for he is a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble to keep that which is committed to him.</hi> He can give us all good things, and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liver us from all evil, for <hi>his is the King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom and the glorious Power.</hi> Though all Creatures ſhould fail us, we may rely upon God, and live upon his All-ſuffici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ency for our ſupply; and may ſay with the <hi>Prophet, Though the Fig-tree ſhould not bloſſom, neither Fruit be in the Vine; though the labour of the Olive ſhould fail, and the Fields ſhould yield no meat; though the Flock ſhould be cut off from the Fold, and there ſhould be no Herd in the Stalls; yet would I rejoice in the Lord, and joy in the God of my Salvation.</hi>

                     <hi>Secondly,</hi> As God is an All-ſufficient Good, ſo He is perfect Goodneſs. He is willing to communicate happineſs to us, and to employ his Power and Wiſdom for our good. He made us that he might make us happy, and nothing can hinder us from being ſo but our ſelves. Such
<pb n="355" facs="tcp:33693:186"/>
is his goodneſs, that <hi>he would have all men to be ſaved, and to come to the know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge of the truth:</hi> And when we have provoked him by our ſins, <hi>he is long-ſuffering to us-ward, not willing that any ſhould periſh, but that all ſhould come to repentance:</hi> For <hi>he delighteth not in the death of a ſinner, but rather that he ſhould turn from his wickedneſs and live.</hi> So that if any of us be miſerable, it is our own choice; if we periſh, our deſtructi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on is of our ſelves: For as the <hi>Wiſeman,</hi> in one of the <hi>Apocryphal</hi> Books, ſays ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cellently, <hi>God made not death, neither hath he pleaſure in the deſtruction of the li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving: But men ſeek death in the error of their life, and pull deſtruction upon them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves, with the works of their own hands.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>So great is the goodneſs of God to mankind, that he hath omitted nothing that is neceſſary to our happineſs. He deſign'd it for us at firſt, and to that end he hath endowed us with Powers and Faculties whereby we are capable of knowing, and loving, and obeying, and enjoying <hi>Him</hi> the chief Good. And when we had forfeited all this by the wilful tranſgreſſion and diſobedience of the firſt Parents of mankind, and were miſerably bruiſed and maimed by their
<pb n="356" facs="tcp:33693:187"/>
fall, God of his infinite mercy was pleas'd to reſtore us to a new capacity of happi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs, by ſending his only Son to ſuffer in our nature, and in our ſtead; and thereby to become <hi>a Propitiation for the ſins of the whole World,</hi> and <hi>the Author of eternal Salvation to them that believe and obey him.</hi> And he hath likewiſe pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſed to give us his Holy Spirit, to en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able us to that Faith and Obedience which the Goſpel requires of us, as the neceſſary conditions of our eternal Sal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vation.</p>
                  <p>
                     <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="III"/>
                     <hi>Thirdly,</hi> God is alſo a firm and un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>changeable Good. Notwithſtanding his infinite Wiſdom, and Power, and Good<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs, we might be miſerable if God were mutable. For that cannot be a happineſs which depends upon uncertainties, and perhaps one of the greateſt aggravations of miſery is to fall from happineſs, to have been once happy and afterwards to ceaſe to be ſo: And that would unavoid<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ably happen to us, if the cauſe of our happineſs could change, and the founda<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of it be removed. If God could be otherwiſe than powerful, and wiſe, and good, all our hopes of happineſs would be ſhaken, and would fall to the ground.
<pb n="357" facs="tcp:33693:187"/>
But the Divine nature is not ſubject to any change: As he is <hi>the Father of lights,</hi> and <hi>the Author of every good and perfect gift,</hi> ſo <hi>with him is no variableneſs, nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther ſhadow of turning.</hi> All the things of this World are mutable, and for that reaſon, had they no other imperfection belonging to them, cannot make us happy.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Fourthly,</hi> God is ſuch a good as none <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="IV"/>
can deprive us of and take away from us. If the things of this World were unchangeable in their nature, and not li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able to any decay, yet they cannot make us happy; becauſe we may be cheated of them by fraud, or robb'd of them by violence: But God cannot be taken from us. Nothing but our Sins can part God and us: <hi>Who ſhall ſeparate us,</hi>
                     <note place="margin">Rom. 8.35.</note> ſaith the <hi>Apoſtle, from the love of God? ſhall tri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bulation, or diſtreſs, or perſecution, or fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mine, or nakedneſs, or peril, or ſword?</hi> We may be ſtripp'd of all our worldly Comforts and Enjoyments, by the vio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lence of men; but none of all theſe can ſeparate us from God: <hi>I am perſuaded,</hi>
                     <note place="margin">v. 38, 39.</note> as the <hi>Apoſtle</hi> goes on <hi>with great triumph, that neither death nor life; nor Angels, nor Principalities, nor Powers; nor heighth,
<pb n="358" facs="tcp:33693:188"/>
nor depth, nor things preſent, nor things to come, nor any other Creature, ſhall be able to ſeparate us from the love of God which is in Chriſt</hi> Jeſus, <hi>our Lord. Nor any other Creature:</hi> Here is a ſufficient induction of particulars, and nothing left out of this Catalogue but one, and <hi>that</hi> is <hi>Sin,</hi> which is none of God's <hi>Creatures,</hi> but our own: <hi>This</hi> indeed deliberately conſented to, and wilfully continued in, will finally part God and us, and for ever hinder us from being happy.</p>
                  <p>But if we be careful to avoid this, which only can ſeparate between God and us, nothing can deprive us of Him: The aids and influences of his Grace none can intercept and hinder: the joys and comforts of his Holy Spirit none can take from us: All other things may leave us and forſake us: We may be debarr'd of our beſt friends, and baniſh'd from all our acquaintance; but men can ſend us no whither from the preſence of God: Our Communication with Heaven can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not be prevented or interrupted. Our Prayers and our Souls will always find the way thither from the uttermoſt parts of the Earth.</p>

                     <hi>Fifthly,</hi> God is an eternal God: And <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="V"/>
nothing but what is ſo can make us hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>py. Man having an immortal Spirit, and being deſign'd for an endleſs durati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, muſt have a happineſs proportion<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able: For which reaſon nothing in this World can make us happy, becauſe we ſhall abide and remain after it: When a very few years are paſt and gone, and much ſooner for any thing we know, all the things of this World will leave us, or elſe we ſhall be taken away from them, <hi>But God is from everlaſting to everlaſting: He is the ſame, and his years fail not:</hi> Therefore well might <hi>David</hi> fix his hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pineſs upon God alone, and ſay, <hi>Whom have I in Heaven but thee? and there is none upon Earth that I deſire beſides thee: When my heart faileth, and my ſtrength faileth, God is the ſtrength of my heart, and my portion for ever.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Sixthly,</hi> God is able to ſupport and <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="VI"/> comfort us, in every condition, and un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der all the accidents and adverſities of humane Life. Outward afflictions may hurt our Body, but they cannot reach our Soul; and ſo long as <hi>that</hi> remains unwounded, <hi>the ſpirit of a man can bear his infirmities.</hi> God is intimate to our
<pb n="360" facs="tcp:33693:189"/>
Souls, and hath ſecret ways whereby to convey the joys and comforts of his Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly Spirit into our Hearts, under the bit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tereſt afflictions and ſharpeſt ſufferings: He can enable us by his Grace <hi>to poſſeſs our ſouls in patience,</hi> when all other things are taken from us: When there is no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing but trouble about us, He can <hi>give us peace and joy in believing:</hi> When we are <hi>perſecuted, afflicted,</hi> and <hi>tormented,</hi> He can give us that raviſhing ſight of the Glories of another World, that ſtedfaſt aſſurance of a future Bleſſedneſs, as ſhall quite extinguiſh all ſenſe of preſent ſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferings: How did many of the primitive <hi>Chriſtian Martyrs,</hi> in the midſt of their torments, and under the very pangs of death <hi>rejoice in the hope of the glory of God?</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>There are none of us but may happen to fall into thoſe circumſtances of dan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger, and of bodily pains and ſufferings, as to have no hopes of relief and com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fort but from God; none in all the World to truſt to but <hi>Him</hi> only: And in the greateſt Evils that can befall us in this life, He is a ſure refuge and ſanctuary; and to repeat the words of the <hi>Pſal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſt</hi> after the <hi>Text, When our heart fails, and our ſtrength fails, God is the
<pb n="361" facs="tcp:33693:189"/>
ſtrength of our hearts, and our portion for ever.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Now what would any of us do in ſuch a Caſe, if it were not for God? Humane nature is liable to deſperate ſtraits and exigencies: And he is not happy who is not provided againſt the worſt that may happen. It is ſad to be reduced to ſuch a condition, as to be deſtitute of all com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fort and hope: And yet men may be brought to that extremity, that if it were not for God they would not know which way to turn themſelves, or how to en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tertain their thoughts with any comfor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>table conſiderations under their preſent anguiſh.</p>
                  <p>All men naturally reſort to God in ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tremity, and cry out to him for help: Even the moſt profane and Atheiſtical, when they are deſtitute of all other com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fort, will run to God, and take hold of him, and cling about him. But <hi>God hath no pleaſure in fools</hi>; in thoſe who neg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lect and deſpiſe him in their proſperity, though they owe that alſo entirely to him; but when the evil day comes, then they lay hold of him as their only re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fuge: When all things go well with them, <hi>God is not in all their thoughts</hi>; but <hi>in their affliction they will ſeek him
<pb n="362" facs="tcp:33693:190"/>
early: Then they will cry, Lord, Lord</hi>; but <hi>he will ſay to them in that day, De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>part from me ye workers of iniquity, for I know you not.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Here will be the great unhappineſs of ſuch perſons, that God will then appear terrible to them, ſo as they ſhall not be able, when they look up to him, to a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bide his frowns: And at the ſame time that they are forc'd to acknowledge him, and to ſupplicate to him for mercy and forgiveneſs, they ſhall be ready to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpair of it: <hi>Then,</hi> thoſe terrible threat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nings of God's Word will come to their minds; <hi>Becauſe I called, and ye refuſed; I ſtretched out my hand,</hi>

own devices: The eaſe of the ſimple ſhall ſlay them, and the proſperity of fools ſhall deſtroy them.</hi> To which I will add that terrible Paſſage in the <hi>Prophet,</hi> concern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the perverſe and obſtinate <hi>Jews, They are a People of no underſtanding,</hi>

upon all the reſt, God is ſuch a Good as can give perfect reſt and tran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quillity to our minds. And that which cannot do this, though it had all the Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perties before mentioned, cannot make us happy. For he is not happy who does not think himſelf ſo, what-ever cauſe he may have to think ſo. Now what in reaſon can give us diſquiet, if we do firm<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly believe that there is a God, and that his Providence rules and governs all things for the beſt; and that God is all that to good Men which hath now been ſaid of Him? Why ſhould not our minds

be in perfect repoſe, when we are ſecure of the chief Good, and have found out that which can make us happy, and is willing to make us ſo, if we be not want<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to our ſelves, and by our wilful ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtinacy and rebellion againſt him do not oppoſe and fruſtrate this deſign?</p>
                  <p>If a conſiderate Man were permitted to his own choice, to wiſh the greateſt good to himſelf that he could poſſibly deviſe; after he had ſearched Heaven and Earth, the reſult of all his wiſhes would be that there were juſt ſuch a Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing as we muſt neceſſarily conceive God to be: Nor would he chuſe any other Friend or Benefactor; any other Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tector for himſelf or Governor for the whole World, than infinite Power con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ducted and managed by infinite Wiſdom and Goodneſs; which is the true Notion of a God: After all his enquiry he would come to the <hi>Pſalmiſt</hi>'s concluſion here in the Text, <hi>Whom have I in Heaven but thee? and there is none upon Earth that I deſire beſides thee.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Vain Man is apt to ſeek for happineſs elſewhere, but this proceeds from want of due conſideration: For when all things are well weigh'd, and all accounts right<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly caſt up and adjuſted, we ſhall at laſt

Lord lift thou up the light of thy countenance upon us: Thou haſt put gladneſs in my heart, more than in the time that their Corn and Wine increaſed.</hi> The great joy of the men of this World is in a plentiful Harveſt, and the abundance of the good things of this life: But <hi>David</hi> had found that which gave more joy and gladneſs to his heart, the favour of God and the <hi>light of his countenance:</hi> This gave perfect reſt and tranquillity to his mind, ſo that he need<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed not to enquire any further: For ſo it follows in the next words, <hi>I will both lay me down in peace, and reſt; for thou, Lord, only makeſt me to dwell in ſafety:</hi> The <hi>Hebrew</hi> word ſignifies <hi>confidence</hi> or <hi>ſecu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity:</hi> Here, and no-where elſe, his mind found reſt, and was in perfect eaſe and ſecurity.</p>
                  <p>
                     <pb n="366" facs="tcp:33693:192"/>I ſhall now only make two or three <hi>Inferences</hi> from this Diſcourſe, and ſo conclude.</p>
                  <p>Firſt, This plainly ſhews us the great unreaſonableneſs and folly of <hi>Atheiſm,</hi> which would baniſh the belief of God and his Providence out of the World: Which as it is moſt impious in reſpect of God, ſo is it moſt malicious to Men; be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe it ſtrikes at the very foundation of our happineſs, and perfectly undermines it. For if there were no God, Man would evidently be the moſt unhappy of all o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther Beings here below; becauſe his un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>happineſs would be laid in the very frame of his nature, in that which diſtinguiſhes him from all other Beings below him, I mean in his Reaſon and Underſtanding: And he would be ſo much more miſera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble than the Beaſts, by how much he hath a farther reach, and a larger pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpect of future evils; a quicker appre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>henſion, and a deeper and more laſting reſentment of them.</p>
                  <p>So that if any man could ſee reaſon to ſtagger his belief of a God, or of his Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vidence, as I am ſure there is infinite rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon to the contrary; yet the belief of theſe things is ſo much for the intereſt, and comfort, and happineſs of Mankind,
<pb n="367" facs="tcp:33693:192"/>
that a Wiſe man would be heartily trou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bled to part with a Principle ſo favoura<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble to his quiet, and that does ſo exactly anſwer all the natural deſires and hopes and fears of Men, and is ſo equally cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culated both for our comfort in this World, and for our happineſs in the o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther. For when a man's thoughts have ranged and wandered as far as they can, his mind can find no reſt, no probable foundation of happineſs but God only; no other reaſonable, no nor tolerable <hi>Hy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>potheſis</hi> and <hi>Scheme</hi> of things for a Wiſe man to rely upon, and to live and die by. For no other Principle but this, firm<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly believed, and truly lived up to by an anſwerable practice, was ever able to ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>port the generality of Mankind, and to miniſter true conſolation to them under the calamities of life, and the pangs of death.</p>
                  <p>And if there were not ſomething real in the Principles of Religion, it is im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſſible that they ſhould have ſo remark<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able and ſo regular an effect to ſupport our minds in every condition, upon ſo great a number of perſons of different de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>grees of underſtanding, of all ranks and conditions, young and old, learned and unlearned, in ſo many diſtant Places, and
<pb n="368" facs="tcp:33693:193"/>
in all Ages of the World, the Records whereof are come down to us: I ſay ſo real, and ſo frequent, and ſo regular an effect as this is, cannot with any co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lour of reaſon be aſcribed either to blind Chance, or meer Imagination, but muſt have a real, and regular, and uniform cauſe proportionable to ſo great and ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neral an effect.</p>
                  <p>I remember that <hi>Grotius,</hi> in his excel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lent <hi>Book of the Truth of the Chriſtian Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion,</hi> hath this obſervation, That God did not intend that the Principles of Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion ſhould have the utmoſt evidence that any thing is capable of, and ſuch as is ſufficient to anſwer and bear down all ſorts of captious Cavils and Objections againſt it; but ſo much as is abundant<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly ſufficient to ſatisfie a ſober and impar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tial Enquirer after Truth, one that hath no other intereſt but to find out Truth; and when he hath found it, to yield to it: If it were otherwiſe, and the Princi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ples of Religion were as glaring and evi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent as the Sun ſhining at Noon-day, as there could hardly be any vertue in ſuch a Faith, ſo Infidelity would be next to an impoſſibility.</p>

reaſon to believe the <hi>Being</hi> and the <hi>Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vidence</hi> of God, is this; That he would offer ſome other <hi>Principles</hi>; that he would advance any other <hi>Hypotheſis</hi> and <hi>Scheme</hi> of things that is more agreeable to the common and natural Notions of Men, and to all Appearances of things in the World; and that does bid more fairly for the comfort and happineſs of Mankind, than theſe Principles of the <hi>Being</hi> of a God, and of his watchful <hi>Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vidence</hi> over the children of men, do plainly do: And till this be clearly done, the Principles of Religion which have generally been received by Mankind, and have obtain'd in the World in all Ages, cannot fairly be diſcarded, and ought not to be diſturbed and put out of Poſſeſſion. And this, I think, puts this whole mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter upon a very fair and reaſonable Iſſue, and that nothing more needs to be ſaid concerning it.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Secondly,</hi> From what hath been ſaid, in <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="2"/> the foregoing Diſcourſe, it naturally fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lows, That God is the only Object of our truſt and confidence, and therefore to him alone, and to no other, we ought to addreſs all our Prayers and Supplications <hi>for mercy and grace to help in time of need.</hi> But now, according to the Doctrine and
<pb n="370" facs="tcp:33693:194"/>
Practice of the Church of <hi>Rome,</hi> the <hi>Pſal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſt</hi> here puts a very odd and ſtrange Queſtion, <hi>Whom have I in Heaven but thee?</hi> To which they muſt give a quite different anſwer from what the <hi>Pſalmiſt</hi> plainly intended; namely, that God was the ſole Object of his hope and truſt, and that upon Him alone he relied as his on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly comfort and happineſs: But to this Aſſertion of the <hi>Pſalmiſt</hi> the Church of <hi>Rome</hi> can by no means agree: They un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtand this matter much better than the <hi>Pſalmiſt</hi> did; namely, that beſides God there are in Heaven innumerable <hi>Angels</hi> and <hi>Saints,</hi> in whom we are to repoſe great truſt and confidence, and to whom alſo we are to addreſs ſolemn Prayers and Supplications, not only for temporal good things, but for the par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>don of our Sins, for the increaſe of our Graces, and for eternal Life. That there are in Heaven particular <hi>Advocates</hi> and <hi>Patrons</hi> for all exigencies and occaſions, againſt all ſorts of dangers and diſeaſes, for all Graces and Vertues, and, in a word, for all temporal, ſpiritual, and e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ternal Bleſſings; to whom we may ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ply our ſelves, without troubling God and our Bleſſed Saviour, who alſo is <hi>God bleſſed for evermore,</hi> by preſuming upon
<pb n="371" facs="tcp:33693:194"/>
every occaſion to make our immediate Addreſſes to Him<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> For as they would make us believe, though <hi>Abraham</hi> was ignorant of it, and <hi>David</hi> knew it not, the bleſſed Spirits above, both Angels and Saints, do not only intercede with God for us for all ſorts of Bleſſings, but we may make direct and immediate Addreſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes to them to beſtow theſe Bleſſings up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on us: For ſo they do in the Church of <hi>Rome,</hi> as is evident, beyond all denial, from ſeveral of their <hi>Prayers</hi> in their moſt publick and authentick <hi>Liturgies.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>They would indeed fain palliate this matter, by telling us, that by theſe di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rect and immediate Addreſſes to Angels and Saints to beſtow Grace and eternal Life upon them, they mean no more but only to pray to them that they would be pleaſed to intercede with God for theſe Bleſſings to be beſtowed upon them by their Mediation: But if they mean no mean, why do they ſay more than they mean? Why do they uſe ſuch expreſſions as to the common ſenſe and underſtand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of Mankind do ſignifie a great deal more than they ſay they mean; ſuch ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſions, as they themſelves do acknow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge, if they be underſtood according to the moſt obvious ſence of the words,
<pb n="372" facs="tcp:33693:195"/>
would render them guilty of flat Idola<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>try? Eſpecially when they know, that they are charged with Idolatry upon this account; and ſince to clear themſelves of it they will not alter their Prayers, they juſtly lie under the ſuſpicion of it.</p>
                  <p>And yet admitting what they ſay in this matter to be true, and that by theſe expreſſions in their <hi>Prayers</hi> they intend no more but the ſolemn Invocation of Angels and Saints, that they would inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cede with God to beſtow theſe Bleſſings upon them for the ſake of their Merits, and upon their Mediation: Yet this ſure<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly is a great deal too much, and cannot be done without a high entrenchment upon the <hi>Office</hi> of the only <hi>Mediator be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween God and Man, the Man Chriſt Je<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſus:</hi> But let them not deceive them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves, <hi>God is not mocked: The Lord our God is a jealous God,</hi> and <hi>He will not give his Glory to another.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>I have not yet inſtanced in the groſſeſt part of their <hi>Superſtition,</hi> not to ſay down<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>right Idolatry, in this kind; I mean, in their extravagant Worſhip of <hi>the bleſſed Virgin</hi> and <hi>Mother of our Lord</hi>; whom they blaſphemouſly call the <hi>Queen of Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven</hi>; and whom, by a new ſtyle, unknown to the <hi>Scriptures</hi> and <hi>Primitive Antiquity,</hi>
                     <pb n="373" facs="tcp:33693:195"/>
they think to dignifie with the <hi>modiſh</hi> Title of <hi>our Lady</hi>; as if that could be any addition of honour to <hi>Her,</hi> whom the <hi>Angel</hi> declared to be <hi>bleſſed among Women:</hi> Who, if ſhe know any thing of the follies of Her Worſhippers here be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low, with what diſdain and indignation, do we think She hears thoſe infinite <hi>Pray<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers</hi> that are made to Her, and that <hi>Sacri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>legious</hi> Worſhip which is given Her in that Church, and which makes both pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ges of their Religion; and which for the frequency of it, both in their publick and private Devotions, is very much be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>yond what they give to God and Chriſt? As if there were <hi>none in Heaven but She,</hi> nor <hi>any thing upon Earth</hi> to be worſhip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ped in compariſon of <hi>Her Image.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Nay, ſo far have they carried this ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>travagant Folly, and how much farther they would have carried it, had not the <hi>Reformation</hi> given a check to it, God only knows: So far, I ſay, have they proceeded in this Folly, as, in that fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mous <hi>Book</hi> of their <hi>Devotions,</hi> called <hi>Our Lady's Pſalter,</hi> not only to apply to Her ſome part of this <hi>Pſalm,</hi> out of which I have taken my <hi>Text,</hi> beginning it thus: <hi>How good is God to</hi> Iſrael, <hi>to them that worſhip his Bleſſed Mother?</hi> But they

have likewiſe profanely <hi>burleſqued,</hi> I can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not afford it a better term, this whole <hi>Book</hi> of <hi>Pſalms,</hi> applying to <hi>Her</hi> almoſt the higheſt things that are there ſaid concerning <hi>God</hi> and our <hi>Bleſſed Saviour. Hear, O Heavens, and give ear, O Earth, and be ye horribly aſtoniſhed,</hi> to ſee the beſt and wiſeſt Religion in the World transform'd into Superſtition and Folly; and to ſee the moſt learned Perſons in that Communion ſet themſelves in good earneſt to juſtifie all theſe follies and ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſurdities by a grave and groundleſs pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tence to <hi>Infallibility.</hi>

                     <hi>Thirdly</hi> and <hi>Laſtly,</hi> This ſhews us how neceſſary the favour of God is to every man's happineſs: And there is but one way to gain his friendſhip and favour, by becoming holy and good as He is: Then may we rejoice and glory in God, as the <hi>Pſalmiſt</hi> here does, and ſay, <hi>Whom have I in Heaven but thee? and there is none upon Earth that I deſire beſides thee.</hi> A wicked Man dreads God above all things in the World, and he has great reaſon to do ſo: <hi>For he is not a God that hath pleaſure in wickedneſs, neither ſhall evil dwell with him: The fooliſh ſhall not ſtand in his ſight, he hateth all the workers of iniquity.</hi> When by ſin we depart from
<pb n="375" facs="tcp:33693:196"/>
God, we forſake our own happineſs: <hi>Salvation is far from the wicked,</hi>
                     <note place="margin">Pſal. 119.</note> ſays <hi>Da<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vid.</hi> And again, a little after the <hi>Text,
They that are far from thee ſhall periſh, but it is good for me to draw near to God.</hi> Now by Holineſs and Goodneſs we draw near to <hi>Him,</hi> who alone can make us happy.</p>
                  <p>It is certainly the common intereſt of mankind there ſhould be a God, becauſe we cannot poſſibly be happy without Him: But then it is no man's intereſt to be wicked, becauſe thereby we make <hi>Him</hi> our Enemy <hi>in whoſe favour is life,</hi> and upon whom all our hopes of hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pineſs do depend.</p>
                  <p>To conclude, If we would have God for our Happineſs, we muſt be ſure to make Him our Friend; and then we may promiſe to our ſelves all thoſe advanta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ges which the Friendſhip of ſo great and powerful a Patron can give us: And there is but one way to eſtabliſh a firm Friendſhip between God and us, and that is, by doing his Will, and living in obedience to his Laws: <hi>Ye are my friends,</hi> ſaith our Bleſſed Lord, <hi>if ye do whatſoe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver I command you: This is the love of God,</hi> ſaith St. <hi>John, that we keep his com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mandments:</hi>
                     <pb n="376" facs="tcp:33693:197"/>
And to love God is the way to be made partakers of thoſe glorious <hi>things which God hath prepared for them that love Him: Such as eye hath not ſeen, nor ear heard, neither have entred into the heart of man:</hi> Which God of his infinite Goodneſs grant we may all at laſt be made partakers of, for his Mercies ſake in <hi>Jeſus Chriſt</hi>; To whom with Thee, O Father, and the <hi>Holy Ghoſt,</hi> be all ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour and glory, dominion and power, both now and for ever. <hi>Amen.</hi>

                     <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="1"/> This may comprehend both hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mane Knowledge, and likewiſe prudence in the management of affairs.

                  <p>

<pb n="382" facs="tcp:33693:200"/>
Ignorance doth vaſtly exceed our Know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge at the beſt. Wiſdom in any tolerable degree is difficult to be attain'd, but per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fection in it utterly to be deſpair'd of. Where is there to be found ſo ſtrong and found a Head, as hath no ſoft place; ſo perfect, ſo clear an underſtanding as hath no flaw, no dark Water in it? How hard a matter is it to be truly wiſe? And yet there are ſo many pretenders to wiſdom as would almoſt tempt a man to think that nothing is eaſier. Men do frequently murmur and repine at the unequal diſtri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bution of other things, as of health and ſtrength, of power and riches: But if we will truſt the judgment of moſt men concerning themſelves, nothing is more equally ſhar'd among mankind than a good degree of wiſdom and underſtand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing. Many will grant others to be ſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>periour to them in other gifts of Nature, as in bodily ſtrength and ſtature; and in the gifts of Fortune, as in riches and ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour; becauſe the difference between one man and another in theſe qualities is many times ſo groſs and palpable, that no body hath the face to deny it: But very few in compariſon, unleſs it be in mere complement and civility, will yield others to be wiſer than themſelves;
<pb n="383" facs="tcp:33693:200"/>
and yet the difference in this alſo is for the moſt part very viſible to every body but themſelves.</p>
                  <p>So that true Wiſdom is a thing very extraordinary. Happy are they that have it: And, next to them, not thoſe many that think they have it, but thoſe few that are ſenſible of their own defects and imperfections and know that they have it not.</p>
                  <p>And among all the kinds of Wiſdom none is more nice and difficult, and meers with more frequent diſappointments, than that which men are moſt apt to pride themſelves in, I mean <hi>Political</hi> wiſdom and prudence; becauſe it depends upon ſo many contingent Cauſes, any one of which failing the beſt laid deſign breaks and falls in pieces: It depends upon the uncertain wills and fickle humours, the miſtaken and mutable intereſts of men, which are perpetually ſhifting from one point to another, ſo that no body knows where to find them: Beſides an unac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>countable mixture of that which the <hi>Heathen</hi> call'd <hi>Fortune,</hi> but we <hi>Chriſtians</hi> by its true name, the <hi>Providence</hi> of God; which does frequently interpoſe in hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mane Affairs, and loves to <hi>confound the wiſdom of the wiſe,</hi> and <hi>to turn their coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſels into fooliſhneſs.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>
                     <pb n="384" facs="tcp:33693:201"/>Of this we have a moſt remarkable Example in <hi>Achitophel,</hi> of whoſe wiſdom the <hi>Scripture</hi> gives this extraordinary Te<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtimony, That <hi>the counſel which he coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelled in thoſe days was as if one had en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quired at the Oracle of God: Such was all the counſel of</hi> Achitophel <hi>both with</hi> David <hi>and with</hi> Abſalom. It ſeems he gave very good counſel alſo to <hi>Abſalom,</hi> and becauſe he would not follow it was diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>contented to that degree as to lay vio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lent hands upon himſelf: And now who would pride himſelf in being ſo very wiſe as to be able to give the beſt counſel in the world, and yet ſo very weak as to make away himſelf, becauſe he to whom it was given was not wiſe enough to take it?</p>
                  <p>The like miſcarriages often happen in point of Military skill and prudence. A great <hi>Prince</hi> or <hi>General</hi> is ſometimes ſo very cautious and wary, that nothing can provoke him to a Battel; and then at another time, and perhaps in another Element, ſo raſh and wilful that nothing can hinder him from fighting and being beaten: As if the two Elements made the difference; and caution were great wiſdom at Land, and confidence and pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſumption great prudence at Sea. But the true reaſon of theſe things lies much
<pb n="385" facs="tcp:33693:201"/>
deeper, in the ſecret Providence of Al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mighty God, who when he pleaſes can ſo govern and over-rule both the under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtandings and the wills of men, as ſhall beſt ſerve his own wiſe purpoſe and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſign.</p>
                  <p>And as the higheſt pitch of humane Wiſdom is very imperfect in it ſelf, ſo is it much more ſo in compariſon with the Divine knowledge and wiſdom: Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>par'd with this it is mere folly, and leſs than the underſtanding and wiſdom of a child to that of the wiſeſt man.<note place="margin">1 Cor. 1.25.</note> 
                     <hi>The foo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liſhneſs of God,</hi> ſays St. <hi>Paul, is wiſer than men,</hi> that is, the leaſt grain of Divine wiſdom is infinitely beyond all the wiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom of men: But in oppoſition to the wiſdom of God, the wiſdom of men is leſs than nothing and vanity. Let men deſign things never ſo prudently, and make them never ſo ſure, even to the <hi>Popiſh</hi> and <hi>French</hi> degree of infallibility; let them reckon upon it as <hi>a Blow that cannot fail:</hi> Yet after all, the counſel of the Lord <hi>that</hi> ſhall ſtand, and he will do all his pleaſure; <hi>for there is no wiſdom, nor underſtanding, nor counſel againſt the Lord.</hi>

                     <hi>Secondly, When knowledge and wiſdom are with great difficulty in any competent meaſure attain'd, how eaſily are they loſt?</hi> By a diſeaſe, by a blow upon the head; by a ſudden and violent paſſion, which may diſorder the ſtrongeſt Brain and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>found the cleareſt Underſtanding in a moment: Nay even the exceſs of know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge and wiſdom, eſpecially if attended with pride as too often it is, is very dan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gerous and does many times border up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on diſtraction and run into madneſs: Like an <hi>Athletick</hi> conſtitution and perfect ſtate of health, which is obſerv'd by <hi>Phy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſicians</hi> to verge upon ſome dangerous diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eaſe, and to be a forerunner of it.</p>
                  <p>And when a man's Underſtanding is once craz'd and ſhatter'd, how are the fineſt notions and thoughts of the wiſeſt man blunder'd and broken, perplex'd and
<pb n="387" facs="tcp:33693:202"/>
entangled? like a puzled lump of ſilk, ſo that the man cannot draw out a thought to any length, but is forc'd to break it off and to begin at another end. Upon all which and many more ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>counts, <hi>Let not the wiſe man glory in his wiſdom</hi>
                     <g ref="char:punc">▪</g> which is ſo very imperfect; ſo hard to be attain'd, and yet ſo eaſie to be loſt.</p>
                  <p n="2">2. <hi>Neither let the mighty man glory in <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="2"/> his might.</hi> Which whether it be meant of natural ſtrength of body, or of mili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tary force and power, how weak and im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perfect is it, and how frequently foil'd by an unequal ſtrength?</p>
                  <p>If we underſtand it of the natural ſtrength of men's bodies, how little rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon is there to glory in that, in which ſo many of the Creatures below us do by ſo many degrees excell us? In that, which may ſo many ways be loſt; by ſickneſs, by a maime, and by many other exter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal Accidents; and which however will decay of it ſelf, and by Age ſink into infirmity and weakneſs.</p>
                  <p>And how little reaſon is there to glory in that, which is ſo frequently foil'd by an unequal ſtrength? of which <hi>Goliah</hi> is a famous Inſtance. When he defied the Hoſt of <hi>Iſrael,</hi> and would needs have the
<pb n="388" facs="tcp:33693:203"/>
matter decided by ſingle Combate, God inſpired <hi>David</hi> to accept the Challenge; who though he was no wiſe comparable to him in ſtrength, and would have been nothing in his hands in cloſe fight, yet God directed him to aſſail him at a di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtance by a weapon that was too hard for him, a ſtone out of a ſling, which ſtruck the Giant in the forehead, and brought his unwieldy bulk down to the Earth.</p>
                  <p>Or if by <hi>might</hi> we underſtand military force and power, how little likewiſe is that to be gloried in? conſidering the uncertain events of War, and how very often and remarkably the Providence of God doth interpoſe to caſt the Victory on the unlikely Side. It is <hi>Solomon</hi>'s ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſervation, that ſuch are the interpoſitions of Divine Providences in humane Affairs, that the Event of things is many times not at all anſwerable to the power and probability of ſecond Cauſes: <hi>I returned,</hi> ſays he,<note place="margin">Eccl. 9.11.</note> 
                     <hi>and ſaw under the Sun, that the race is not to the ſwift, nor the battel to the ſtrong.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>And one way, among many others, whereby the Providence of God doth of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten interpoſe to decide the Events of War, is by a remarkable change of the Seaſons
<pb n="389" facs="tcp:33693:203"/>
and Weather in favour of one Side: As by ſending great Snows, or violent Rains, to hinder the early motion and march of a powerful Army, to the diſappointment or prejudice of ſome great Deſign: By remarkable Winds and Storms at Sea, to prevent the Conjunction of a powerful Fleet: And by governing all theſe for a long time together ſo viſibly to the Ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vantage of one Side us utterly to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feat the well laid deſign of the other. Of all which, by the great mercy and goodneſs of God to us, we have had the happy experience in all our late ſig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal Deliverances and Victories.</p>
                  <p>And here I cannot but take notice of a paſſage to this purpoſe in the Book of <hi>Job:</hi> Which may deſerve our more at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tentive regard and conſideration, becauſe I take this Book to be incomparably the moſt ancient of all other, and much el<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der than <hi>Moſes:</hi> And yet it is written with as lively a ſenſe of the Providence of God, and as noble Figures and Flights of Eloquence as perhaps any Book extant in the World. The <hi>Paſſage</hi> I mean is, where God to convince <hi>Job</hi> of his igno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rance in the ſecrets of Nature and Provi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence poſeth him with many hard Que<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtions, and with this amongſt the reſt,

                     <hi>Haſt thou entred into the treaſures of the Snow?</hi>

                     <hi>haſt thou ſeen the treaſures of the Hail? which I have reſerv'd againſt the time of trouble, againſt the Day of Bat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tel and War.</hi> The meaning of which is, that the Providence of God doth ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times interpoſe to determine the Events of War, by governing the Seaſons and the Weather, and by making the Snows and Rains, <hi>the Winds and Storms to fulfil his word</hi> and to execute his pleaſure.</p>
                  <p>Of this we have a remarkable Inſtance in the defeat of <hi>Siſera</hi>'s mighty Army; againſt whom, in the Song of <hi>Deborah,</hi> the <hi>Stars</hi> are ſaid to <hi>have fought in their courſes:</hi> The expreſſion is <hi>Poetical,</hi> but the plain meaning of it is, that by migh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty and ſudden Rains, which the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon Opinion did aſcribe to a ſpecial influence of the <hi>Planets,</hi> the River of <hi>Ki<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhon,</hi> near which <hi>Siſera</hi>'s Army lay, was ſo raiſed and ſwoln as to drown the grea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teſt part of that huge Hoſt. For ſo <hi>De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>borah</hi> explains the <hi>fighting of the Stars in their courſes againſt Siſera: They fought,</hi> ſays <hi>ſhe, from Heaven, the Stars in their cour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes fought againſt</hi> Siſera, <hi>the River of</hi> Ki<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhon <hi>ſwept them away:</hi> As if the Stars, which were ſuppoſed by their influence to have cauſed thoſe ſudden and extraor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinary
<pb n="391" facs="tcp:33693:204"/>
Rains, had ſet themſelves in Bat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tel-array againſt <hi>Siſera</hi> and his Army.</p>
                  <p>Therefore, <hi>let not the mighty man glory in his might,</hi> which is ſo ſmall in it ſelf, but in oppoſition to God is weakneſs and nothing. <hi>The weakneſs of God,</hi> ſays St. <hi>Paul, is ſtronger than men.</hi> All power to do miſchief is but impotence,<note place="margin">Pſal. 52.1.</note> and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore no matter of boaſting: <hi>Why boaſteſt thou thy ſelf, thou Tyrant, that thou art a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble to do miſchief? the goodneſs of God en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dureth continually:</hi> The goodneſs of God is too hard for the pride and malice of man, and will laſt and hold out when that has tir'd and ſpent it ſelf.</p>
                  <p>Thirdly, <hi>Let not the rich man glory in <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="3"/> his riches.</hi> In theſe, men are apt to pride themſelves: even the meaneſt and pooreſt ſpirits, who have nothing to be proud of but their money, when they have got good ſtore of that together, how will they ſwell and ſtrut? as if becauſe they are <hi>rich</hi> and <hi>increaſed in goods</hi> they <hi>wanted nothing.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>But we may do well to conſider, that Riches are things without us; not the real Excellencies of our Nature, but the accidental Ornaments of our Fortune. If they deſcend upon us, they are the Pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vilege of our Birth, not the effect of our
<pb n="392" facs="tcp:33693:205"/>
wiſdom and induſtry; and thoſe things in the procurement whereof we had no hand, we can hardly call our own: And if they be the fruit of our own prudent induſtry, that is no ſuch matter of glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rying; becauſe men of much ſlower un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtandings do commonly out-do others in diligence and drudging, their minds lying more level to the low deſign of being rich.</p>
                  <p>At the beſt, Riches are uncertain. <hi>Charge them,</hi> ſays St. <hi>Paul, that are rich in this world, that they be not high-minded, nor truſt in uncertain riches:</hi> Men have little reaſon to pride themſelves, or to place their confidence in that which is uncer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain, and even next to that which is not: So the wiſe man ſpeaks of Riches,<note place="margin">Prov. 23.5.</note> 
                     <hi>Wilt thou ſet thine heart upon that which is not? for riches certainly make themſelves wings, and fly as an Eagle towards heaven:</hi> He ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſes it in ſuch a manner, as if a rich man ſate brooding over an Eſtate till it was <hi>fledg'd</hi> and had gotten it ſelf wings to fly away.</p>
                  <p>But that which is the moſt ſtinging conſideration of all is, that many men have an evil eye upon a good Eſtate; ſo that inſtead of being the means of our happineſs it may prove the occaſion of
<pb n="393" facs="tcp:33693:205"/>
our ruin: So the ſame Wiſe man ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerves,<note place="margin">Eccl. 5.13.</note> 
                     <hi>There is a ſore evil which I have ſeen under the Sun, namely, riches kept for the owners thereof to their hurt.</hi> And it is not without example, that a very rich man hath been excepted out of a general Pardon, both as to Life and Eſtate, for no other viſible reaſon but his vaſt and over-grown Fortune: So <hi>Solomon</hi> obſerves to us again,<note place="margin">Prov. 1.18.</note> 
                     <hi>Such are the ways of every one that is greedy of gain, which taketh a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>way the life of the owners thereof.</hi> And why ſhould any man be proud of his danger, of that which one time or other may be the certain and only cauſe of his ruin? A man may be too rich to be for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>given a fault which would never have been proſecuted againſt a man of a mid<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dle Fortune.

                  <p>
                     <hi>That he underſtandeth and knoweth me, that I am the Lord,</hi> that is the Creator, and the Sovereign Governor of the World.</p>

                  <p>The beſt Knowledge of Religion, and that which is the foundation of all the reſt, is the Knowledge of the Divine Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture and Perfections: eſpecially of thoſe which are moſt proper for our imitation; and ſuch are thoſe mentioned in the <hi>Text, loving-kindneſs,</hi> and <hi>judgment,</hi> and <hi>righteouſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs</hi>; which we may diſtinguiſh thus: <hi>Lo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving-kindneſs</hi> comprehends God's milder Attributes, his <hi>Goodneſs,</hi> and <hi>Mercy,</hi> and <hi>Patience: Judgment</hi> ſignifies his ſeverer dealings with men, whether in the cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtiſement of his People, or in the remark<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able Puniſhment of great Offenders for example and warning to others: <hi>Righte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ouſneſs</hi>
                     <pb n="395" facs="tcp:33693:206"/>
ſeems to be a word of a larger ſig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nification, and to denote that univerſal Rectitude of the Divine Nature which appears in all the Adminiſtrations of his Providence here below; for the Text ſpeaks of the Exerciſe of theſe Perfecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons in this World: <hi>which exerciſe loving-kindneſs, and judgment, and righteouſneſs in the Earth.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Several of the Perfections of the Divine Nature are incommunicable to a Crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, and therefore cannot be thought to be propoſed to us for a Pattern; as <hi>ſelf-exiſtence, independence,</hi> and <hi>all-ſufficiency</hi>; the <hi>eternity,</hi> and the <hi>immenſity</hi> of the Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vine Being; to be the <hi>original Cauſe</hi> of all other things, and the <hi>Sovereign Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernour</hi> of the whole World: For God only is ſufficient for <hi>that</hi>; and to be a Match for all the World, a <hi>nec pluribus impar,</hi> is not a <hi>Motto</hi> fit for a mortal man. A Creature may ſwell with pride till it burſt, before it can ſtretch it ſelf to this pitch of Power and Greatneſs: It is an inſufferable Preſumption, and a ſot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiſh Ignorance of the neceſſary Bounds and Limits of our Being, to think to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſemble God in theſe Perfections: This was the Ambition of <hi>Lucifer,</hi> to <hi>aſcend into Heaven,</hi> and to <hi>be like the moſt High.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>
                     <pb n="396" facs="tcp:33693:207"/>In our imitation of God we muſt ſtill keep within the ſtation of Creatures; not affecting an <hi>independency</hi> and <hi>ſovereignty</hi> like God, and to be <hi>omnipotent</hi> as he is: <hi>Haſt thou an arm like God,</hi>

                  <p>
                     <hi>For in theſe things I delight, ſaith the Lord.</hi> God takes pleaſure to exerciſe theſe Perfections himſelf, and to ſee them imi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tated by us; and the imitation of theſe Divine Perfections is our perfection and glory; in compariſon of which all hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mane <hi>wiſdom,</hi> and <hi>power,</hi> and <hi>riches,</hi> are ſo far from being matter of glory, that they are very deſpicable and pitiful things: Knowledge and Skill to deviſe miſchief, and power to effect it, are the true Nature and Character of the Devil and his Angels; thoſe Apoſtate and ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>curſed Spirits, who in temper and diſpo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſition are moſt contrary to God, who is the Rule and Pattern of all perfection.</p>
                  <p>I ſhall only make two <hi>Obſervations</hi> or <hi>Inferences</hi> from what hath been ſaid, and then apply the whole Diſcourſe to the great Occaſion of this Day: And they are theſe.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Firſt,</hi> That the wiſeſt and ſureſt Rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſonings in Religion are grounded upon
<pb n="397" facs="tcp:33693:207"/>
the unqueſtionable Perfections of the Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vine Nature.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Secondly,</hi> That the Nature of God is the true <hi>Idea</hi> and Pattern of Perfection and Happineſs.</p>
                  <p>Firſt, <hi>That the wiſeſt and ſureſt Reaſon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings in Religion are grounded upon the un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>queſtionable Perfections of the Divine Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture:</hi> Upon thoſe more eſpecially which to us are moſt eaſie and intelligible: ſuch as are thoſe mentioned in the <hi>Text.</hi> And this makes the Knowledge of God, and of theſe Perfections, to be ſo uſeful and ſo valuable: Becauſe all Religion is founded in right Notions of God, and of his Perfections: Inſomuch that Divine Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>velation it ſelf does ſuppoſe theſe for its foundation, and can ſignify nothing to us unleſs theſe be firſt known and belie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved: For unleſs we be firſt firmly per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſuaded of the Providence of God, and of his particular care of Mankind, why ſhould we ſuppoſe that he makes any Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>velation of his Will to us? Unleſs it be firſt naturally known that God is a God of Truth, what ground is there for the belief of his Word? So that the Principles of <hi>Natural</hi> Religion are the foundation of that which is reveal'd: And therefore nothing can in Reaſon be admitted to be
<pb n="398" facs="tcp:33693:208"/>
a Revelation from God, which does plainly contradict his eſſential Perfecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons.</p>
                  <p>Upon this <hi>Principle,</hi> a great many <hi>Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrines</hi> are without more a-do to be reje<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cted, becauſe they do plainly and at firſt ſight contradict the Divine Nature and Perfections. I will give a few <hi>Inſtances,</hi> inſtead of many that might be given.</p>
                  <p>In vertue of this <hi>Principle</hi> I cannot be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve, upon the pretended Authority or Infallibility of any Perſon or Church, that Force is a fit Argument to produce Faith: No man ſhall ever perſuade me, no not the Biſhop of <hi>Meaux</hi> with all his Eloquence, that Priſons and Tortures, Dragoons and the Galleys, are proper means to convince the Underſtanding, and either <hi>Chriſtian</hi> or <hi>Humane</hi> Methods of converting men to the true Reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gion.</p>
                  <p>For the ſame Reaſon I cannot believe, that God would not have men to under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtand their publick Prayers, nor the Leſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons of Scripture which are read to them: Becauſe a Leſſon is ſomething that is to be learnt, and therefore a Leſſon that is not to be underſtood is nonſenſe; for if it be not underſtood how can it be learnt?</p>
                  <p>
                     <pb n="399" facs="tcp:33693:208"/>As little can I believe, that God who cauſed the <hi>Holy Scriptures</hi> to be written for the inſtruction of mankind, did ever intend that <hi>they</hi> ſhould be lock'd up and concealed from the People in an unknown Tongue.</p>
                  <p>Leaſt of all can I believe that <hi>Doctrine</hi> of the Council of <hi>Trent,</hi> That the ſaving Efficacy of the <hi>Sacraments</hi> doth depend upon the intention of the Prieſt that ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miniſters them: Which is to ſay, that though the People believe and live never ſo well, yet they may be damn'd by ſhoals, and whole Pariſhes together, at the pleaſure of the Prieſt: And this for no other reaſon, but becauſe the Prieſt is ſo croſs and ſo cruel that he will not in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tend to ſave them.</p>
                  <p>Now can any man believe this, that hath any tolerable Notion either of the Goodneſs or Juſtice of God? May we not appeal to God in this, as <hi>Abraham</hi> did in another Caſe? <hi>Wilt thou deſtroy the righ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teous with the wicked? That be far from thee, to do after this manner: Shall not the Judge of all the Earth do right?</hi> Much more, to deſtroy the righteous for the wicked, and that righteous and innocent People ſhould lie at the mercy and will of a wicked and perverſe Prieſt, to be
<pb n="400" facs="tcp:33693:209"/>
ſav'd or damn'd by him as he thinks fit, <hi>That be far from thee: Shall not the Judge of all the Earth do right?</hi> For, to drive the argument to the head, if this be to do right there is no poſſibility of doing wrong.</p>
                  <p>Thus in things which are more obſcure we ſhould govern all our Reaſonings con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerning God and Religion by that which is clear and unqueſtionable, and ſhould with <hi>Moſes</hi> lay down this for a certain Principle, <hi>All his ways are judgment, a God of truth, and without iniquity, juſt and right is He:</hi> And ſay with St. <hi>Paul, Is there then unrighteouſneſs with God? God forbid?</hi> And again, <hi>We know that the Judgment of God is according to truth.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p n="2">2<hi>ly,</hi> The other <hi>Inference</hi> is this, <hi>That the Nature of God is the true</hi> Idea <hi>and Pat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tern of Perfection and Happineſs:</hi> And therefore nothing but our conformity to it can make us happy: And for this rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon, to underſtand and know God is our great excellency and glory, becauſe it is neceſſary to our imitation of <hi>Him</hi> who is the beſt and happieſt Being. And ſo far as we are from reſembling God, ſo far are we diſtant from Happineſs and the true temper of the Bleſſed. For Good<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs is an eſſential ingredient of Happi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs;
<pb n="401" facs="tcp:33693:209"/>
and as without Goodneſs there can be no true Majeſty and Greatneſs, ſo nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther any true Felicity and Bleſſedneſs.</p>
                  <p>Now Goodneſs is a generous diſpoſiti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of mind to diffuſe and communicate it ſelf by making others to partake of our Happineſs, in ſuch degrees as they are capable: For no Being is ſo happy as it might be, that hath not the power and the pleaſure to make others happy: This ſurely is the higheſt pleaſure, I had al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moſt ſaid pride, of a great Mind.</p>
                  <p>In vain therefore do we dream of Hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pineſs in any thing without us. Happi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs muſt be within us; the foundation of it muſt be laid in the inward frame and diſpoſition of our ſpirits: And the very ſame cauſes and ingredients which make up the Happineſs of God muſt be found in us, though in a much inferiour degree, or we cannot be happy. They underſtand not the Nature of Happineſs, who hope for it upon any other terms: He who is the Authour and Fountain of Happineſs cannot convey it to us by any other way, than by planting in us ſuch diſpoſitions of mind as are in truth a kind of participation of the Divine Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, and by enduing us with ſuch qua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lities as are the neceſſary Materials of
<pb n="402" facs="tcp:33693:210"/>
Happineſs: And a man may aſſoon be well without Health as happy without Goodneſs.</p>
                  <p>If a wicked man were taken up into Heaven, yet if he ſtill continue the ſame bad man that he was before, <hi>coelum, non animum mutavit,</hi> he may have chang'd the <hi>Climate,</hi> and be gone into a far Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>try; but becauſe he carries <hi>himſelf</hi> ſtill along with him, he will ſtill be miſerable from himſelf: Becauſe the man's mind is not chang'd all the while, which would ſignifie a thouſand times more to his hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pineſs, than change of place, or of any outward circumſtances whatſoever: For a bad man hath a <hi>Fiend</hi> in his own Breaſt, and the fewel of Hell in his guilty Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcience.</p>
                  <p>There is a certain kind of temper and diſpoſition which is neceſſary and eſſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tial to Happineſs, and <hi>that</hi> is Holineſs and Goodneſs, which is the very Nature of God; and ſo far as any man departs from this temper, ſo far he removes himſelf and runs away from happineſs. And here the foundation of Hell is laid, in the evil diſpoſition of a man's own mind, which is naturally a torment to it ſelf: And till this be cur'd, it is as impoſſible for him to be happy, as for a Limb that is out
<pb n="403" facs="tcp:33693:210"/>
of joint to be at eaſe; becauſe the man's Spirit is out of order, and off the hinges, and as it were toſs'd from its Center; and till that be ſet right, and reſtored to its proper and natural ſtate, the man will be perpetually unquiet, and can have no reſt and peace within himſelf. <hi>The wick<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed,</hi> ſaith the <hi>Prophet, is like the troubled Sea, when it cannot reſt: There is no peace, ſaith my God, to the wicked:</hi> No peace with God, no peace with his own mind; for a bad man is at perpetual Diſcord and Wars within himſelf: And <hi>hence,</hi> as St. <hi>James</hi> tells us, <hi>come Wars and Fightings without us, even from our Luſts which warr in our members.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>And now that I have mention'd <hi>Wars and Fightings without us,</hi> this cannot but bring to mind the great and glorious Oc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>caſion of this Day: Which gives us ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nifold Cauſe of Praiſe and Thankſgiving to Almighty God: For ſeveral wonder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful Mercies and Deliverances; and more particularly, for a moſt glorious Victory at Sea, vouchſafed to Their <hi>Majeſties</hi> Fleet in this laſt Summer's Expedition.</p>
                  <p>For ſeveral great Mercies and Delive<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rances: For a wonderful Deliverance in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed, from a ſudden <hi>Invaſion</hi> deſign'd up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on us by the inveterate and implacable
<pb n="404" facs="tcp:33693:211"/>
Enemies of our Peace and Religion; which by the merciful Providence of God was happily and ſtrangely prevented, when it was juſt upon the point of exe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cution.</p>
                  <p>Next, for the preſervation of our <hi>Gra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cious Sovereign,</hi> from that horrid and moſt barbarous Attempt deſign'd upon his Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cred Perſon: And from thoſe great and manifold Dangers to which he was expo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed in his late tedious Expedition: And for His ſafe and moſt welcome Return to us.</p>
                  <p>And laſtly, For a moſt glorious <hi>Victo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry at Sea:</hi> The greateſt and the cheapeſt that ever the Sun ſaw, from his firſt ſet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting out to run his Courſe. The Oppor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tunity indeed of this Victory was through the raſhneſs and confidence of our Ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mies, by the wiſe Providence of God, put into our hands: But the improvement of this Opportunity into ſo great and happy a Victory we owe, under God, to the matchleſs Conduct and Courage of the Brave <hi>Admiral,</hi> and to the invincible Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolution and Valour of the <hi>Captains</hi> and <hi>Seamen.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>This great Deliverance from the de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſign'd <hi>Invaſion,</hi> and this glorious <hi>Victory,</hi> God vouchſaf'd to us <hi>at Home,</hi> whilſt His
<pb n="405" facs="tcp:33693:211"/>
Sacred Majeſty was ſo freely hazarding his Royal Perſon <hi>abroad,</hi> in the Publick Cauſe of the Rights and Liberties of al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moſt all <hi>Europe.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>And now what may God juſtly expect from us, as a meet return for his Good<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs to us? What? but that we ſhould <hi>glorifie</hi> Him, firſt by <hi>offering praiſe</hi> and thankſgiving; and then, by <hi>ordering our converſation aright,</hi> that he may ſtill de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>light to <hi>ſhew</hi> us <hi>his Salvation.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>God might have ſtood aloof from us in the Day of our diſtreſs, and have ſaid to us, as he once did to the People of <hi>Iſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rael,</hi> ſo often have I delivered you from the hands of your Enemies, but ye have ſtill provok'd me more and more,<note place="margin">Judg. 10.13.</note> 
                     <hi>Where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore I will deliver you no more:</hi> He might have ſaid of us, as he did of the ſame People, <hi>I will hide my face from them,</hi>
                     <note place="margin">Deut. 32.20.</note> 
                     <hi>I will ſee what their end ſhall be: For they are a very froward generation, children in whom is no faith:</hi> Our reſolutions and promiſes of better obedience are not to be truſted; all our Repentance and <hi>Righ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teouſneſs</hi> are but <hi>as the morning cloud, and like the early dew which paſſeth away:</hi> Nay methinks God ſeems now to ſay to us, as he did of old to <hi>Jeruſalem, Be inſtru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cted,</hi> O Jeruſalem,<note place="margin">Jer. 6.8.</note> 
                     <hi>leſt my ſoul depart from
<pb n="406" facs="tcp:33693:212"/>
thee, and I make thee deſolate, a Land not inhabited.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>We are here met together this Day, to pay our Solemn acknowledgments to <hi>the God of our Salvation; who hath ſhewed ſtrength with his Arm, and hath ſcattered the proud in the imagination of their heart:</hi> Even to <hi>him that exerciſeth loving-kindneſs, and judgment, and righteouſneſs in the Earth:</hi> In <hi>Him</hi> will we glory as our ſure Refuge and Defence, as our Mighty Deliverer, and the Rock of our Salva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion.</p>
                  <p>And now I have only to entreat your patience a little longer, whilſt I apply what hath been diſcourſed upon this <hi>Text</hi> a little more cloſely to the Occaſion of this Day. I may be tedious, but I will not be long.</p>
                  <p>And bleſſed be God for this happy <hi>Oc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>caſion:</hi> The greateſt <hi>England</hi> ever had, and, in the true conſequences of it, per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>haps the greateſt that <hi>Europe</hi> ever had of Praiſe and Thankſgiving.</p>
                  <p>You have heard two ſorts of Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons deſcribed in the <hi>Text,</hi> by very dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferent Characters: The <hi>One,</hi> that glory in their <hi>Wiſdom</hi> and <hi>Might,</hi> and Riches: The <hi>other,</hi> that <hi>glory in this, that</hi> they <hi>under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtand and know God to be the Lord, which
<pb n="407" facs="tcp:33693:212"/>
exerciſeth loving-kindneſs, and judgment, and righteouſneſs in the Earth.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>And we have ſeen theſe two <hi>Characters</hi> exemplified, or rather drawn to the Life, in this preſent Age. We who live in this Weſtern part of <hi>Chriſtendom</hi> have ſeen a <hi>mighty Prince,</hi> by the juſt permiſſion of God, raiſed up to be a Terrour and Scourge to all his Neighbours: A <hi>Prince,</hi> who had in perfection all the Advantages mentioned in the former part of the <hi>Text:</hi> And who, in the opinion of many who had been long dazzled with his Splen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dour and Greatneſs, hath paſs'd for many years, for the moſt <hi>Politick,</hi> and <hi>Power<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful,</hi> and <hi>Richeſt Monarch</hi> that hath ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pear'd in theſe parts of the World, for many Ages:</p>
                  <p>Who hath govern'd his Affairs by the deepeſt and ſteddieſt Counſels, and the moſt refin'd Wiſdom of this World: A Prince mighty and powerful in his Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parations for War; formidable for his vaſt and well diſciplin'd Armies, and for his great Naval Force: And who had brought the Art of War almoſt to that perfection, as to be able to Conquer and do his buſineſs without fighting: A Myſtery hardly known to former Ages and Generations: And all this Skill and
<pb n="408" facs="tcp:33693:213"/>
Strength united under one abſolute Will, not hamper'd or bound up by any re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtraints of Law or Conſcience.</p>
                  <p>A Prince that commands the Eſtates of all his Subjects, and of all his Conqueſts; which hath furniſh'd him with an almoſt inexhauſtible Treaſure and Revenue: And One, who if the World doth not greatly miſtake him, hath ſufficiently <hi>gloried</hi> in all theſe Advantages, and even beyond the rate of a mortal man.</p>
                  <p>But not <hi>knowing God to be the Lord, which exerciſes loving-kindneſs, and judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, and righteouſneſs in the Earth</hi>; How hath the pride of all his Glory been ſtain'd by Tyranny and Oppreſſion, by Injuſtice and Cruelty; by enlarging his Dominions without Right, and by ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king War upon his Neighbours without Reaſon, or even colour of Provocation? And this in a more Barbarous manner than the moſt Barbarous Nations ever did; carrying Fire and Deſolation where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſoever he went, and laying waſt many and great Cities without neceſſity, and without pity.</p>
                  <p>And now behold what a terrible Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>buke the Providence of God hath given to this mighty Monarch, in the full Car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rier of his Fortune and Fury. The con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſideration
<pb n="409" facs="tcp:33693:213"/>
whereof brings to my thoughts thoſe Paſſages in the <hi>Prophet</hi> concerning old <hi>Babylon,</hi> that ſtanding and perpetual Type of the great Oppreſſors and Perſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cutors of God's true Church and Religion:<note place="margin">Iſa. 14.</note> 
                     <hi>How is the Oppreſſor ceaſed? the exactor of gold ceaſed? He who ſmote the People in wrath with a continual ſtroke, he who ruled the Nations in anger is himſelf perſecuted, and none hindreth. The whole Earth is at reſt and is quiet, and breaks forth into ſing<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing: The grave beneath is moved for thee, to meet thee at thy coming; it ſtirreth up the dead for thee, even all the Captains of the Earth; it hath raiſed up from their Thrones all the Kings of the Nations; all they ſhall ſpeak and ſay unto thee, art thou alſo become weak as we are? art thou alſo become like unto us? how art thou fallen from Heaven, O Lucifer, Son of the mor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning? How art thou cut down to the ground that didſt weaken the Nations? For thou haſt ſaid in thy heart, I will aſcend into Heaven, I will exalt my Throne above the Stars of God: I will ſit alſo upon the Mount of the Congregation in the ſides of the North,</hi> That is, upon Mount <hi>Zion,</hi> for juſt ſo the <hi>Pſalmiſt</hi> deſcribes it,<note place="margin">Pſal. 48.2.</note> 
                     <hi>Beau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiful for ſituation, the joy of the whole Earth is Mount</hi> Zion, <hi>on the ſides of the
<pb n="410" facs="tcp:33693:214"/>
North.</hi> Here the King of <hi>Babylon</hi> threa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tens to take <hi>Jeruſalem,</hi> and to demoliſh the <hi>Temple</hi> where the Congregation of <hi>Iſrael</hi> met for the Worſhip of the true God; <hi>I will alſo ſit upon the Mount of the Congregation in the ſides of the North.</hi> Much in the ſame Style with the threat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nings of Modern <hi>Babylon, I will deſtroy the Reformation, I will extirpate the Nor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thern Hereſie.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>And then he goes on, <hi>I will aſcend a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bove the height of the clouds, I will be like the moſt High: Yet thou ſhalt be brought down to the grave, to the ſides of the pit: They that ſee thee ſhall narrowly look upon thee, and conſider thee, ſaying, Is this the man that made the earth to tremble, that did ſhake Kingdoms; that made the World as a Wilderneſs, and deſtroyed the Cities thereof, and opened not the Houſe of his Priſoners?</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>God ſeems already to have begun this Work, in the late glorious Victory at Sea; and I hope he will <hi>cut it ſhort in righteouſneſs.</hi> I have ſometimes heretofore wondred, Why at the deſtruction of Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dern and Myſtical <hi>Babylon</hi> the Scripture ſhould make ſo expreſs mention of great wailing and lamentation for the loſs of Her <hi>Ships</hi> and <hi>Seamen:</hi>
                     <note place="margin">Rev. 18.17.</note> Little imagining
<pb n="411" facs="tcp:33693:214"/>
thirty years ago, that any of the <hi>King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>doms</hi> who had <hi>given their power to the Beaſt</hi> would ever have arrived to that mighty <hi>Naval</hi> Force: But the <hi>Scripture ſaith nothing in vain.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Whether, and how far, Succeſs is an Argument of a good Cauſe, I ſhall not now debate: But thus much, I think, may ſafely be affirmed, That the Provi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence of God doth ſometimes, without plain and down-right Miracles, ſo viſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bly ſhew it ſelf, that we cannot without great ſtupidity and obſtinacy refuſe to ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>knowledge it.</p>
                  <p>I grant, the Cauſe muſt firſt be mani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſtly juſt, before Succeſs can be made an Argument of God's favour to it and ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>probation of it: And if the Cauſe of true Religion, and the neceſſary defence of it againſt a falſe and Idolatrous Worſhip, be a good Cauſe, <hi>Ours</hi> is ſo: And I do not here beg the Queſtion; we have abun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dantly proved it to the confuſion of our Adverſaries: If the vindication of the common Liberties of Mankind, againſt Tyranny and Oppreſſion, be a good Cauſe, then <hi>Ours</hi> is ſo: And this needs not to be proved, it is ſo glaringly evi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent to all the World. And as our Cauſe is not like <hi>theirs,</hi> ſo neither hath <hi>their
<pb n="412" facs="tcp:33693:215"/>
Rock</hi> been <hi>like our Rock, our Enemies them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves being Judges.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>And yet as bad an Argument as ſucceſs is of a good Cauſe, I am ſorry to ſay it, but I am afraid it is true, it is like in the concluſion to prove the beſt Argument of all other to convince thoſe who have ſo long pretended Conſcience againſt ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſſion to the preſent Government.</p>
                  <p>Meer Succeſs is certainly one of the worſt Arguments in the World of a good Cauſe, and the moſt improper to ſatisfie Conſcience: And yet we find by expe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rience, that in the iſſue it is the moſt ſuc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſsful of all other Arguments; and does in a very odd but effectual way ſatisfie the Conſciences of a great many men by ſhewing them their Intereſt.</p>
                  <p>God has of late viſibly made bare his Arm in our behalf, though ſome are ſtill ſo blind and obſtinate that they will not ſee it: Like thoſe of whom the <hi>Prophet</hi> complains,<note place="margin">Iſa. 26.11.</note> 
                     <hi>Lord, when thy hand is lifted up they will not ſee, but they ſhall ſee, and be aſhamed for their envy at thy Peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Thus have I repreſented unto you a mighty <hi>Monarch,</hi> who like a fiery <hi>Comet</hi> hath hung over <hi>Europe</hi> for many years; and by his malignant influence hath made
<pb n="413" facs="tcp:33693:215"/>
ſuch terrible havock and devaſtations in this part of the World.</p>
                  <p>Let us now turn our View to the other part of the <hi>Text:</hi> And behold a greater than he is here: A Prince of a quite diffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rent Character, who does <hi>underſtand and know God to be the Lord, which doth ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>erciſe loving-kindneſs, and judgment, and righteouſneſs in the Earth:</hi> And who hath made it the great Study and Endeavour of his life to imitate theſe Divine Perfecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, as far as the imperfection of hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mane Nature in this mortal ſtate will ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mit: I ſay, a greater than he is here; who never ſaid or did an inſolent thing, but inſtead of deſpiſing his Enemies has upon all occaſions encounter'd them with an undaunted Spirit and Reſoluti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on.</p>
                  <p>This is the Man whom God hath ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>noured to give a Check to this mighty Man of the Earth, and to put a hook in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to the Noſtrils of this great <hi>Leviathan</hi> who has ſo long had his paſtime in the Seas.</p>
                  <p>But we will not inſult, as he once did in a moſt unprincely manner over a Man much better than himſelf, when he be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieved Him to have been ſlain at the <hi>Boyne:</hi> And indeed Death came then as
<pb n="414" facs="tcp:33693:216"/>
near to him as was poſſible without kil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling him: But the merciful Providence of God was pleaſed to ſtep in for his Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſervation, almoſt by a Miracle: For I do not believe that from the firſt uſe of great Guns to <hi>that</hi> Day, any mortal man ever had his ſhoulder ſo kindly kiſs'd by a Can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>non-bullet.</p>
                  <p>But I will not treſpaſs any further up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on that which is the great Ornament of all his other Vertues; though I have ſaid nothing of Him but what all the World does ſee and muſt acknowledge: He is as much above being flatter'd, as it is be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neath an honeſt and a generous mind to flatter.</p>
                  <p>Let us then glory in the Lord, and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>joice in the God of our Salvation: Let us now in the preſence of all his People pay our moſt thankful acknowledgments to him <hi>who is worthy to be praiſed</hi>; even to <hi>the Lord God of Iſrael, who alone doth wondrous things:</hi> Who <hi>giveth Victory unto Kings,</hi> and hath <hi>preſerved</hi> our <hi>David his Servant from the hurtful Sword.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>And let us humbly beſeech Almighty God, that he would long preſerve to us the invaluable Bleſſing of our two Excel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lent Princes; whom the Providence of God hath ſent amongſt us, like two good
<pb n="415" facs="tcp:33693:216"/>
Angels; not to reſcue two or three Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons, but almoſt a whole Nation out of <hi>Sodom:</hi> By ſaving us I hope at laſt from our Vices, as well as at firſt from that Vengeance which was juſt ready to have been poured down upon us.</p>
                  <p>Two Sovereign Princes reigning toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, and in the ſame Throne; and yet ſo intirely one, as perhaps no Nation, no Age can furniſh us with a Parallel: Two Princes perfectly united in the ſame De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſign of promoting the true Religion, and the Publick Welfare, by reforming our Manners, and as far as is poſſible, by re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pairing the breaches, and healing the Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viſions of a miſerably diſtracted Church and Nation: In a Word, Two Princes who are contented to ſacrifice Themſelves and their whole Time to the care of the Publick: And for the ſake of that to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny themſelves almoſt all ſort of eaſe and pleaſure: <hi>To deny themſelves,</hi> did I ſay? No, they have wiſely and judiciouſly choſen the trueſt and higheſt Pleaſure that this World knows, the Pleaſure of doing good, and being Benefactors to Mankind. May they have a long and happy Reign over us, to make us hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>py, and to lay up in ſtore for Them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves a Happineſs without meaſure, and
<pb n="416" facs="tcp:33693:217"/>
without end, in God's glorious and ever<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>laſting Kingdom: For his Mercies ſake in <hi>Jeſus Chriſt,</hi> to whom with thee, <hi>O Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther,</hi> and the <hi>Holy Ghoſt,</hi> be all Honour and Glory, Thankſgiving and Praiſe, both now and for ever. <hi>Amen.</hi>

them from the other, by proper Argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments taken from the Word of God, and from the nature of particular Vertues and Vices.</p>
                  <p>The <hi>general</hi> way is, as if a Phyſician, inſtead of applying particular Remedies to the Diſtemper of his Patient, ſhould entertain him with a long diſcourſe of Diſeaſes in general, and of the pleaſure and advantages of Health; and earneſtly perſuade him to be well; without taking his particular Diſeaſe into conſideration, and preſcribing Remedies for it.</p>
                  <p>But if we would effectually reform men, we muſt take to task the great and common diſorders of their Lives, and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſent their faults to them in ſuch a manner as may convince them of the e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vil and danger of them, and put them upon the endeavour of a cure.</p>
                  <p>And to this end I have pitched upon one of the common and reigning Vices of the Age, <hi>Calumny</hi> and <hi>Evil-ſpeaking</hi>; by which men contract ſo much guilt to themſelves, and create ſo much trou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble to others<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> And from which, it is to be feared, few or none are wholly free.

                     <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="I"/> I. I ſhall conſider <hi>what this Sin or Vice of evil ſpeaking, here forbidden by the Apoſtle, is:</hi> 
                     <gap reason="foreign">
                        <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                     </gap>, not to defame and ſlander any man, not to <hi>hurt his reputation,</hi> as the <hi>Etymology</hi> of the word doth import. So that this Vice conſiſts in ſaying things of others which tend to their diſparagement and reproach, to the taking away or leſſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of their Reputation and good Name. And this, whether the things ſaid be true or not. If they be falſe, and we know it, then it is down-right <hi>Calumny</hi>; and if we do not know it, but take it upon the report of others, it is however a <hi>Slander</hi>; and ſo much the more injurious, becauſe really groundleſs and undeſerved.</p>
                  <p>If the thing be true, and we know it to be ſo, yet it is a defamation, and tends to the prejudice of our neighbour's repu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation: And it is a fault to ſay the evil of others which is true, unleſs there be ſome good reaſon for it beſides: Becauſe it is contrary to that charity and goodneſs which <hi>Chriſtianity</hi> requires, to divulge the faults of others, though they be really guilty of them, without neceſſity or ſome other very good reaſon for it.</p>
                  <p>
                     <pb n="423" facs="tcp:33693:220"/>Again, It is <hi>Evil-ſpeaking</hi> and the Vice condemn'd in the <hi>Text,</hi> whether we be the firſt Authors of an ill Report, or re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>late it from others; becauſe the man that is evil ſpoken of is equally defam'd either way.</p>
                  <p>Again, Whether we ſpeak evil of a man to his face, or behind his back: The former way indeed ſeems to be the more generous, but yet is a great Fault, and that which we call <hi>reviling:</hi> The latter is more mean and baſe, and that which we properly call <hi>Slander</hi> or <hi>Back<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>biting.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>And Laſtly, Whether it be done di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rectly and in expreſs terms, or more ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcurely and by way of oblique inſinua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion; whether by way of down-right re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proach, or with ſome crafty preface of commendation: For ſo it have the effect to defame, the manner of addreſs does not much alter the caſe: The one may be more dextrous, but is not one jot leſs faulty: For many times the deepeſt Wounds are given by theſe ſmoother and more artificial ways of Slander; as by asking queſtions, <hi>Have you not heard ſo and ſo of ſuch a man? I ſay no more, I only ask the queſtion:</hi> Or by general in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>timations, that <hi>they are loth to ſay what

                  <p>Theſe and ſuch like Arts, though they may ſeem to be tenderer and gentler ways of uſing men's reputation, yet in truth they are the moſt malicious and effectual methods of Slander; becauſe they inſinuate ſomething that is much worſe than is ſaid, and yet are very apt to create in unwary men a ſtrong belief of ſomething that is very bad, though they know not what it is. So that it matters not in what faſhion a Slander is dreſs'd up, if it tend to defame a man and to diminiſh his Reputation, it is the Sin forbidden in the <hi>Text.</hi>

We will conſider <hi>the extent of this Prohibition to ſpeak evil of no man</hi>; and the due <hi>bounds and limitations of it.</hi> For it is not to be underſtood abſolutely, to forbid us to ſay any thing concerning o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers that is bad. This in ſome caſes may be neceſſary and our duty, and in ſeveral caſes very fit and reaſonable. The Queſtion is, In what Caſes by the gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral
<pb n="425" facs="tcp:33693:221"/>
Rules of Scripture and right Reaſon we are warranted to ſay the evil of others that is true?</p>
                  <p>In general, we are not to do this with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out great reaſon and neceſſity; as, for the prevention of ſome great evil, or the procuring of ſome conſiderable good to our ſelves, or others. And this I take to be the meaning of that advice of the Son of <hi>Sirach, Whether it be to a friend or a foe, talk not of other men's lives;</hi>
                     <note place="margin">Eccl. 19.8.</note> 
                     <hi>and if thou canſt without offence reveal them not</hi>; that is, if without hurt to any body thou canſt conceal them, divulge them not.</p>
                  <p>But becauſe this may not be direction ſufficient, I ſhall inſtance in ſome of the principal Caſes wherein men are war<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ranted to ſpeak evil of others, and yet in ſo doing do not offend againſt this Prohibition in the <hi>Text.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Firſt,</hi> It is not only lawful, but very commendable, and many times our duty to do this in order to the probable a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mendment of the perſon of whom evil is ſpoken. In ſuch a caſe we may tell a man of his faults privately; or where it may not be ſo fit for us to uſe that bold<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs and freedom, we may reveal his
<pb n="426" facs="tcp:33693:222"/>
faults to one who is more fit and proper to reprove him, and will probably make no other uſe of this diſcovery but in or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der to his amendment. And this is ſo far from being a breach of Charity, that it is one of the beſt teſtimonies of it. For perhaps the party may not be guilty of what hath been reported of him, and then it is a kindneſs to give him the op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portunity of vindicating himſelf: Or if he be guilty, perhaps being privately and prudently told of it he may reform. In this Caſe the Son of <hi>Sirach</hi> adviſeth to reveal men's faults;<note place="margin">Ecclus. 19.13, 14, 15.</note> 
                     <hi>Admoniſh a friend,</hi> ſays he, <hi>it may be he hath not done it; and if he have done it, that he do it no more: Admoniſh a friend, it may be he hath not ſaid it; and if he have, that he ſpeak it not again: Admoniſh a friend, for many times it is a ſlander; and believe not every tale.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>But then we muſt take care that this be done out of kindneſs, and that no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing of our own paſſion be mingled with it; and that under pretence of reproving and reforming men, we do not reproach and revile them, and tell them of their faults in ſuch a manner as if we did it to ſhew our <hi>authority</hi> rather than our <hi>cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity.</hi> It requires a great deal of addreſs
<pb n="427" facs="tcp:33693:222"/>
and gentle application ſo to manage the buſineſs of Reproof, as not to irritate and exaſperate the perſon whom we reprove, inſtead of curing him.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Secondly,</hi> This likewiſe is not only law<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful, but our duty, when we are legally called to bear witneſs concerning the fault and crime of another. A good man would not be an accuſer, unleſs the pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lick good, or the prevention of ſome great evil ſhould require it. And then the plain reaſon of the thing will ſufficiently juſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fie a voluntary accuſation: otherwiſe it hath always among well-manner'd Peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple been eſteemed very odious for a man to be officious in this kind, and a for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward Informer concerning the miſdemea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nours of others. <hi>Magiſtrates</hi> may ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times think it fit to give encouragement to ſuch perſons, and to ſet one bad man to catch another, becauſe ſuch men are fitteſt for ſuch dirty work: But they can never inwardly approve them, nor will they ever make them their friends and confidents.</p>
                  <p>But when a man is call'd to give teſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mony in this kind in obedience to the Laws, and out of reverence to the Oath taken in ſuch Caſes, he is ſo far from de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerving blame for ſo doing, that it would
<pb n="428" facs="tcp:33693:223"/>
be an unpardonable fault in him to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceal the truth, or any part of it.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Thirdly,</hi> It is lawful to publiſh the faults of others, in our own neceſſary defence and vindication. When a man cannot conceal another's faults without betraying his own innocency, no chari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty requires a man to ſuffer himſelf to be defamed to ſave the reputation of ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther man. <hi>Charity begins at home</hi>; and though a man had never ſo much good<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs, he would firſt ſecure his own good name, and then be concern'd for other men's. We are <hi>to love our neighbour as our ſelves</hi>; ſo that the love of our ſelves is the Rule and Meaſure of our love to our neighbour: And therefore <hi>firſt,</hi> other<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe it could not be the <hi>Rule.</hi> And it would be very well for the World, if our Charity would riſe thus high; and no man would hurt another man's reputa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, but where his own is in real dan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Fourthly,</hi> This alſo is lawful for cau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion and warning to a third perſon, that is in danger to be infected by the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pany, or ill example of another; or may be greatly prejudiced by repoſing too much confidence in him, having no knowledge or ſuſpicion of his bad quali<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties:
<pb n="429" facs="tcp:33693:223"/>
But even in this caſe we ought to take great care that the ill character we give of any man be ſpread no further than is neceſſary to the good end we de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſigned in it.</p>
                  <p>Beſides theſe more obvious and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>markable Caſes, this Prohibition doth not I think hinder but that in ordinary converſation men may mention that ill of others which is already made as pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lick as it well can be: Or that one friend may not in freedom ſpeak to another of the miſcarriage of a third perſon, where he is ſecure no ill uſe will be made of it, and that it will go no further to his pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>judice: Provided always, that we take no delight in hearing or ſpeaking ill of others: And the leſs we do it, though without any malice or deſign of harm, ſtill the better; becauſe this ſhews that we do not feed upon ill reports and take pleaſure in them.</p>
                  <p>Theſe are the uſual Caſes in which it may be neceſſary for us to ſpeak evil of other men. And theſe are ſo evidently reaſonable that the Prohibition in the <hi>Text</hi> cannot with reaſon be extended to them. And if no man would allow him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf to ſay any thing to the prejudice of another man's good name, but in theſe
<pb n="430" facs="tcp:33693:224"/>
and the like Caſes, the tongues of men would be very innocent, and the World would be very quiet. I proceed in the</p>

                     <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="III"/> III<hi rend="sup">d</hi> place, to conſider <hi>the evil of this Practice,</hi> both in the <hi>Cauſes</hi> and the <hi>Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſequences</hi> of it.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Firſt,</hi> We will conſider the <hi>Cauſes</hi> of it. And it commonly ſprings from one or more of theſe evil Roots.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Firſt,</hi> One of the deepeſt and moſt common <hi>Cauſes</hi> of <hi>evil-ſpeaking</hi> is <hi>ill-nature</hi> and cruelty of diſpoſition: And by a general miſtake <hi>Ill-nature</hi> paſſeth for <hi>Wit,</hi> as <hi>Cunning</hi> doth for <hi>Wiſdom</hi>; though in truth they are nothing a-kin to one another, but as far diſtant as <hi>Vice</hi> and <hi>Vertue.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>And there is no greater evidence of the bad temper of Mankind, than the gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral proneneſs of men to this Vice. For (as our <hi>Saviour</hi> ſays) <hi>out of the abundance of the heart the mouth ſpeaketh.</hi> And there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore men do commonly incline to the cenſorious and uncharitable ſide: which ſhews humane Nature to be ſtrangely di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtorted from its original rectitude and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nocency. The Wit of Man doth more naturally vent it ſelf in <hi>Satyr</hi> and Cen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure,
<pb n="431" facs="tcp:33693:224"/>
than in Praiſe and <hi>Panegyrick.</hi> When men ſet themſelves to commend, it comes hardly from them, and not without great force and ſtraining; and if any thing be fitly ſaid in that kind, it doth hardly reliſh with moſt men: But in the way of <hi>Invective,</hi> the Invention of men is a plentiful and never-failing Spring: And this kind of Wit is not more eaſie than it is acceptable: It is greedily entertain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed and greatly applauded, and every man is glad to hear others abuſed, not conſidering how ſoon it may come to his own turn to lie down and make ſport for others.</p>
                  <p>To ſpeak evil of others, is almoſt be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come the general entertainment of all Companies: And the great and ſerious buſineſs of moſt Meetings and Viſits, af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter the neceſſary Ceremonies and Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plements are over, is to fit down and back-bite all the World. 'Tis the <hi>Sawce</hi> of Converſation, and all Diſcourſe is counted but flat and dull which hath not ſomething of <hi>piquancy</hi> and ſharpneſs in it againſt ſome body. For men generally love rather to hear evil of others than good, and are ſecretly pleas'd with ill reports, and drink them in with greedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs and delight: Though at the ſame
<pb n="432" facs="tcp:33693:225"/>
time they have ſo much Juſtice, as to hate thoſe that propagate them; and ſo much Wit, as to conclude that theſe very perſons will do the ſame for them in another Place and Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pany.</p>
                  <p>But eſpecially, if it concerns one of a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nother <hi>Party,</hi> and that differs from us in matters of Religion; in this Caſe, all Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties ſeem to be agreed that they do God great ſervice in blaſting the reputation of their Adverſaries: And though they all pretend to be <hi>Chriſtians,</hi> and the <hi>Diſci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ples</hi> of <hi>Him</hi> who taught nothing but <hi>kindneſs</hi> and <hi>meekneſs</hi> and <hi>charity</hi>; yet it is ſtrange to ſee with what a ſalvage and murderous diſpoſition they will flie at one another's Reputation and tear it in pieces: And what-ever other <hi>Scruples</hi> they may have, they make none to be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpatter one another in the moſt bitter and ſlanderous manner.</p>
                  <p>But if they hear any good of their Ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſaries, with what nicety and caution do they receive it? how many objecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons do they raiſe againſt it? and with what coldneſs do they at laſt admit it? <hi>It is very well,</hi> ſay they, <hi>if it be true: I ſhall be glad to hear it confirm'd. I ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver heard ſo much good of him before. You
<pb n="433" facs="tcp:33693:225"/>
are a good man your ſelf, but have a care you be not deceived.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Nay it is well, if to balance the mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter, and ſet things even, they do not clap ſome infirmity and fault into the o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther Scale, that ſo the Enemy may not go off with flying Colours.</p>
                  <p>But on the other ſide, every man is a good and ſubſtantial Author of an ill Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>port. I do not apply this to any one ſort of men, though all are to blame in this way; <hi>Iliacos intra muros peccatur, &amp; extra.</hi> To ſpeak impartially, the <hi>Zea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lots</hi> of all <hi>Parties</hi> have got a <hi>ſcurvy trick</hi> of lying for the Truth.</p>
                  <p>But of all ſorts of People, I have ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerved the <hi>Prieſts</hi> and <hi>Bigots</hi> of the Church of <hi>Rome</hi> to be the ableſt in this way, and to have the ſtrongeſt Faith for a luſty Falſhood and Calumny. Others will bandy a falſe Report, and toſs it from one hand to another; but I never knew any that would ſo hug a Lye and be ſo very fond of it. They ſeem to be deſcribed by St. <hi>John</hi> in that expreſſion in the Revelation, <hi>Whoſoever loveth and maketh a lye.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Another ſhrewd ſign that <hi>ill-nature</hi> lies at the root of this <hi>Vice</hi> is, that we eaſily forget the good that is ſaid of o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers,
<pb n="434" facs="tcp:33693:226"/>
and ſeldom make mention of it; but the contrary ſticks with us, and lies uppermoſt in our memories, and is rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy to come out upon all occaſions: And which is yet more ill-natur'd and unjuſt, many times when we do not believe it our ſelves we tell it to others, with this charitable Caution, <hi>That we hope it is not true:</hi> But in the mean time we give it our <hi>Paſs,</hi> and venture it to take its for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tune to be believed or not, according to the charity of thoſe into whoſe hands it comes.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Secondly,</hi> Another Cauſe of the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monneſs of this Vice is, that many are ſo bad themſelves, in one kind or other. For to think and ſpeak ill of others is not only a bad thing, but a ſign of a bad-man. Our <hi>Bleſſed Saviour,</hi> ſpeak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of the evil of the <hi>laſt days,</hi> gives this as the reaſon of the great decay of Cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity among men;<note place="margin">Matth. 24.12.</note> 
                     <hi>Becauſe iniquity ſhall abound, the Love of many ſhall wax cold.</hi> When men are bad themſelves, they are glad of any opportunity to cenſure o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers, and are always apt to ſuſpect that evil of other men which they know by themſelves. They cannot have a good opinion of themſelves, and therefore are very unwilling to have ſo of any body
<pb n="435" facs="tcp:33693:226"/>
elſe; and for this reaſon they endeavour to bring men to a level, hoping it will be ſome juſtification of them if they can but render others as bad as them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Thirdly,</hi> Another ſource of this Vice is <hi>Malice</hi> and <hi>Revenge.</hi> When men are in Heat and Paſſion they do not conſider what is true, but what is ſpiteful and miſchievous; and ſpeak evil of others in revenge of ſome injury which they have received from them: And when they are blinded by their Paſſions, they lay about them madly and at a venture, not much caring whether the evil they ſpeak be true or not. Nay many are ſo <hi>De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viliſh,</hi> as to invent and raiſe falſe Reports on purpoſe to blaſt men's Reputation. This is a <hi>Diabolical</hi> temper, and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore St. <hi>James</hi> tells us that the ſlanderous <hi>Tongue is ſet on fire of Hell:</hi> And the <hi>Devil</hi> hath his very <hi>Name</hi> from <hi>Calumny</hi> and falſe Accuſation; and it is his <hi>Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture</hi> too, for he is always ready to ſtir up and foment this evil ſpirit among men: Nay, the <hi>Scripture</hi> tells us that he hath the malice and impudence to ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cuſe good men before God; as he did <hi>Job,</hi> charging him with <hi>Hypocriſie</hi> to God himſelf; <hi>Who,</hi> he knows, <hi>does
<pb n="436" facs="tcp:33693:227"/>
know the hearts of all the children of men.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Fourthly,</hi> Another <hi>Cauſe</hi> of evil-ſpeak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing is <hi>Envy.</hi> Men look with an evil eye upon the good that is in others, and think that their Reputation obſcures <hi>them,</hi> and that their commendable qua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lities do ſtand in <hi>their</hi> light; and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore they do what they can to caſt a cloud over them, that the bright ſhining of their Vertues may not ſcorch <hi>them.</hi> This makes them greedily to entertain, and induſtriouſly to publiſh any thing that may ſerve to that purpoſe, thereby to raiſe themſelves upon the Ruins of o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther men's Reputation: And therefore as ſoon as they have got an ill Report of any good man by the end, to work they preſently go to ſend it abroad by the firſt <hi>Poſt:</hi> For the ſtring is always ready upon their Bow to let fly this Arrow with an incredible ſwiftneſs, through <hi>Ci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty</hi> and <hi>Country</hi>; for fear the innocent man's juſtification ſhould over-take it.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Fifthly,</hi> Another <hi>Cauſe</hi> of evil-ſpeak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing is <hi>Impertinence</hi> and <hi>Curioſity</hi>; an itch of talking and medling in the affairs of other Men, which do no wiſe concern them. Some perſons love to mingle themſelves in all buſineſs, and are loth
<pb n="437" facs="tcp:33693:227"/>
to ſeem ignorant of ſo important a piece of <hi>News</hi> as the <hi>faults</hi> and <hi>follies</hi> of men, or any bad thing that is talk'd of in good Company. And therefore they do with great care pick up ill Stories, as good matter of diſcourſe in the next Company that is worthy of them: And this per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>haps not out of any great malice, but for want of ſomething better to talk of, and becauſe their Parts lie chiefly that way.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Laſtly,</hi> Men do this many times out of <hi>wantonneſs</hi> and for <hi>diverſion.</hi> So little do light and vain men conſider, that a man's Reputation is too great and tender a Concernment to be jeſted withal; and that a ſlanderous Tongue <hi>bites like a Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pent,</hi> and <hi>wounds like a Sword.</hi> For what can be more barbarous, next to ſporting with a man's Life, than to play with his Honour and Reputation, which to ſome men is dearer to them than their Lives?</p>
                  <p>It is a cruel pleaſure which ſome men take in worrying the Reputation of o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers much better than themſelves; and this only to divert themſelves and the Company. <hi>Solomon</hi> compares this ſort of men to diſtracted perſons; <hi>As a mad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man,</hi> ſaith he, <hi>who caſteth fire-brands, ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rows,
<pb n="438" facs="tcp:33693:228"/>
and death, ſo is the man that decei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veth his neighbour</hi>; the LXX. render it, <hi>So is the man that defameth his neighbour, and ſaith, Am I not in ſport?</hi> Such, and ſo bad are the Cauſes of this Vice. I proceed to conſider, in the</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Second</hi> place, the ordinary, but very pernicious <hi>Conſequences</hi> and <hi>Effects</hi> of it; both to <hi>Others,</hi> and to <hi>our Selves.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Firſt,</hi> To <hi>Others</hi>; the Parties I mean that are ſlandered. To them it is cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainly a great <hi>injury,</hi> and commonly a high <hi>Provocation,</hi> but always matter of no ſmall <hi>grief</hi> and <hi>trouble</hi> to them.</p>
                  <p>It is certainly a great <hi>injury</hi>; and if the evil which we ſay of them be not true, it is an injury beyond imagination, and beyond all poſſible reparation. And though we ſhould do our utmoſt endea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vour afterwards towards their Vindica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, yet that makes but very little a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mends; becauſe the Vindication ſeldom reacheth ſo far as the Reproach, and be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe commonly men are neither ſo for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward to ſpread the Vindication, nor is it ſo eaſily received after ill impreſſions are once made. The ſolicitous Vindication of a man's ſelf is, at the beſt, but an <hi>after<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>game</hi>; and for the moſt part a man had
<pb n="439" facs="tcp:33693:228"/>
better fit ſtill, than to run the hazard of making the matter worſe by <hi>playing</hi> it.</p>
                  <p>I will add one thing more, That it is an Injury that deſcends to a man's Chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren and Poſterity; becauſe the good or ill Name of the Father is derived down to them; and many times the beſt thing he hath to leave them is the Reputation of his unblemiſh'd Virtue and Worth: And do we make no Conſcience to rob his innocent Children of the beſt part of this ſmall Patrimony, and of all the kind<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs that would have been done them for their Father's ſake, if his Reputation had not been ſo undeſervedly ſtain'd? Is it no Crime by the breath of our mouth at once to blaſt a man's Reputation, and to ruin his Children, perhaps to all Poſte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity? Can we make a jeſt of ſo ſerious a matter? Of an Injury ſo very hard to be repented of as it ought, becauſe in ſuch a Caſe no Repentance will be acceptable without Reſtitution, if it be in our power. And perhaps it will undo us in this World to make it; and if we do it not, will be our Ruin in the other.</p>
                  <p>I will put the Caſe at the beſt, that the matter of the Slander is true; yet no man's Reputation is conſiderably ſtain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed,
<pb n="440" facs="tcp:33693:229"/>
though never ſo deſervedly, without great harm and damage to him. And it is great odds but the matter by paſſing through ſeveral hands is aggravated be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>yond truth, every one out of his bounty being apt to add ſomething to it.</p>
                  <p>But, beſides the <hi>Injury,</hi> it is common<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly a very high <hi>Provocation.</hi> And the conſequence of that may be as bad as we can imagine, and may end in dangerous and deſperate Quarrels. This reaſon the wiſe Son of <hi>Sirach</hi> gives why we ſhould defame no man:<note place="margin">Ecclus. 19.8, 9.</note> 
                     <hi>Whether it be,</hi> ſays he, <hi>to a friend or a foe, talk not of other men's lives. For he hath heard and obſerved thee</hi>; that is, one way or other it will probably come to his knowledge, <hi>and when the time cometh he will ſhew his ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tred</hi>; that is, he will take the firſt op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portunity to revenge it.</p>
                  <p>At the beſt, it is always matter of <hi>Grief</hi> to the perſon that is defam'd: And <hi>Chriſtianity,</hi> which is the <hi>beſt-natur'd In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtitution</hi> in the World, forbids us the do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of thoſe things whereby we may <hi>grieve one another.</hi> A man's good name is a tender thing, and a wound there ſinks deep into the ſpirit even of a wiſe and good man: And the more innocent any man is in this kind, the more ſenſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble
<pb n="441" facs="tcp:33693:229"/>
is he of this hard uſage; becauſe he never treats others ſo, nor is he conſci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous to himſelf that he hath deſerved it.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Secondly,</hi> The <hi>Conſequences</hi> of this Vice are as bad or worſe to <hi>our ſelves.</hi> Who<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever is wont to ſpeak evil of others, gives a bad character of himſelf, even to thoſe whom he deſires to pleaſe; who, if they be wiſe enough, will conclude that he ſpeaks of them to others, as he does of others to them: And were it not for that fond partiality which men have for themſelves, no man could be ſo blind as not to ſee this.</p>
                  <p>And it is very well worthy of our conſideration, which our <hi>Saviour</hi> ſays in this very Caſe,<note place="margin">Matth. 7.</note> That <hi>with what meaſure we mete to others, it ſhall be meaſured to us again</hi>; and that many times <hi>heaped up,</hi> and <hi>running over.</hi> For there is hard<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly any thing wherein Mankind do uſe more ſtrict juſtice and equality, than <hi>in rendering evil for evil, and railing for railing.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Nay, Revenge often goes further than Words. A reproachful and ſlanderous Speech hath coſt many a man a <hi>Duel,</hi> and in that the loſs of his own Life, or the Murther of another, perhaps with the
<pb n="442" facs="tcp:33693:230"/>
loſs of his own Soul: And I have often wonder'd that among <hi>Chriſtians</hi> this mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter is no more laid to heart.</p>
                  <p>And though neither of theſe great miſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chiefs ſhould happen to us, yet this may be inconvenient enough many other ways. For no man knows in the chance of things, and the mutability of humane affairs, whoſe kindneſs and good-will he may come to ſtand in need of before he dies. So that did a man only conſult his own ſafety and quiet, he ought to refrain from <hi>evil-ſpeaking.</hi>
                     <note place="margin">Pſal. 34.12, 13.</note> 
                     <hi>What man is he,</hi> ſaith the <hi>Pſalmiſt, that deſireth life, and loveth many days, that he may ſee good: Keep thy tongue from evil, and thy lips from ſpeaking falſhood.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>But there is an infinitely greater Dan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger hanging over us from God. If we al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low our ſelves in this evil practice, all our Religion is good for nothing. So St. <hi>James</hi> expreſsly tells us,<note place="margin">Jam. 1.26.</note> 
                     <hi>If any man among you ſeemeth to be religious, and bridleth not his tongue, but deceiveth his own heart, that man's Religion is vain.</hi> And St. <hi>Paul</hi> puts <hi>Slanderers</hi> and <hi>Revilers</hi> amongſt thoſe that <hi>ſhall not inherit the kingdom of God.</hi>
                     <note place="margin">1 Cor. 6.10.</note> And our <hi>Bleſſed Saviour</hi> hath told us, That <hi>by our words we ſhall be ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtified, and by our words we ſhall be con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demned.</hi>
                     <pb n="443" facs="tcp:33693:230"/>
To which I will add the coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſel given us by the <hi>Wiſe-man,</hi>
                     <note place="margin">Wiſdom of Solo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon, <hi>c.</hi> 1. <hi>v.</hi> 11.</note> 
                     <hi>Refrain your tongue from back-biting, for there is no word ſo ſecret that ſhall go for nought, and the mouth that ſlandereth ſlayeth the Soul.</hi> I proceed in the</p>
                  <p n="4">IV<hi rend="sup">th.</hi> place, to add <hi>ſome further Argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="IV"/> and Conſiderations to take men off from this Vice:</hi> As,</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Firſt,</hi> That the uſe of <hi>Speech</hi> is a pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culiar Prerogative of Man above other Creatures, and beſtowed upon him for ſome excellent end and purpoſe: That by this <hi>Faculty</hi> we might communicate our thoughts more eaſily to one another, and conſult together for our mutual com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fort and benefit: Not to enable us to be hurtful and injurious, but helpful and be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neficial to one another. The <hi>Pſalmiſt,</hi> as by <hi>Interpreters</hi> is generally thought, calls our <hi>Tongue</hi> our <hi>Glory</hi>; therewith we <hi>praiſe God</hi> and <hi>bleſs Men.</hi> Now to <hi>bleſs</hi> is to ſpeak well of any, and to wiſh them well. So that we pervert the uſe of <hi>Speech</hi> and turn our <hi>glory</hi> into ſhame, when we abuſe this <hi>Faculty</hi> to the injury and reproach of any.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Secondly,</hi> Conſider how cheap a kind<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs it is to ſpeak well, at leaſt not to ſpeak ill of any. A good word is an ea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſie
<pb n="444" facs="tcp:33693:231"/>
obligation, but not to ſpeak ill re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quires only our Silence, which coſts us nothing. Some inſtances of Charity are chargeable, as to relieve the wants and neceſſities of others: The expence deterrs many from this kind of Charity. But were a man never ſo covetous, he might afford another man his good word; at leaſt he might refrain from ſpeaking ill of him: eſpecially if it be conſider'd how dear many have paid for a ſlanderous and reproachful word.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Thirdly,</hi> Conſider that no quality doth ordinarily recommend one more to the favour and good-will of men, than to be free from this Vice. Every one deſires ſuch a man's friendſhip, and is apt to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe a great truſt and confidence in him: And when he is dead, men will praiſe him; and next to Piety towards God, and Righteouſneſs to Men, nothing is thought a more ſignificant commenda<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, than that he was never, or very rarely heard to ſpeak ill of any. It was a ſingular Character of a <hi>Roman Gentle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man, Neſcivit quid eſſet maledicere, he knew not what it was to give any man an ill word.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Fourthly,</hi> Let every man lay his hand upon his heart, and conſider how him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf
<pb n="445" facs="tcp:33693:231"/>
is apt to be affected with this uſage. Speak thy Conſcience <hi>Man,</hi> and ſay whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, as bad as thou art, thou wouldſt not be glad to have every man's, eſpeci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally every good man's good word? And to have thy faults conceal'd, and not to be hardly ſpoken of, though it may be not altogether without truth, by thoſe whom thou didſt never offend by word or deed? But with what face or reaſon doſt thou expect this from others, to whom thy carriage hath been ſo contra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry? Nothing ſurely is more equal and reaſonable than that known <hi>Rule, What thou wouldſt have no man do to thee, that do thou to no man.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Fifthly,</hi> When you are going to ſpeak reproachfully of others, conſider whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther you do not lie open to juſt reproach in the ſame, or ſome other kind. There<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore give no Occaſion, no Example of this barbarous uſage of one another.</p>
                  <p>There are very few ſo innocent and free either from infirmities or greater faults, as not to be obnoxious to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proach upon one account or other; even the wiſeſt, and moſt virtuous, and moſt perfect among men have ſome little va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity, or affectation, which lays them open to the railery of a mimical and ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>licious
<pb n="446" facs="tcp:33693:232"/>
Wit: Therefore we ſhould often turn our thoughts upon our ſelves, and look into that part of the <hi>Wallet</hi> which men commonly fling over their ſhoul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders and keep behind them, that they may not ſee their own Faults: And when we have ſearched that well, let us remember our <hi>Saviour's Rule, He that is without ſin, let him caſt the firſt ſtone.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Laſtly</hi> conſider, That it is in many Caſes as great a Charity to conceal the evil you hear and know of others, as if you relieved them in a great neceſſity. And we think him a hard-hearted man that will not beſtow a ſmall Alms upon one in great want. It is an excellent Ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vice which the Son of <hi>Sirach</hi> gives to this purpoſe;<note place="margin">Ecclus. 19.10.</note> 
                     <hi>Talk not of other men's lives: If thou haſt heard a word, let it die with thee; and be bold it will not burſt thee.</hi> I ſhall in the</p>
                  <p n="5">
                     <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="V"/> V<hi rend="sup">th</hi>. and <hi>laſt</hi> place, <hi>give ſome Rules and Directions for the prevention and cure of this great evil among men.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Firſt, Never ſay any evil of any man, but what you certainly know.</hi> When ever you poſitively accuſe and <hi>endite</hi> any man of any <hi>Crime,</hi> though it be in private and among Friends, ſpeak as if you were
<pb n="447" facs="tcp:33693:232"/>
upon your <hi>Oath,</hi> becauſe God ſees and hears you. This not only Charity, but Juſtice and regard to Truth do de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mand of us. He that eaſily credits an ill Report is almoſt as faulty as the firſt in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venter of it. For though you do notmake, yet you commonly propagate a <hi>Lye.</hi> Therefore never ſpeak evil of any upon <hi>common Fame,</hi> which for the moſt part is falſe, but almoſt always uncertain whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther it be true or not.</p>
                  <p>Not but that it is a fault, in moſt Caſes, to report the evil of men which is true, and which we certainly know to be ſo: But if I cannot prevail to make men wholly to abſtain from this fault, I would be glad to compound with ſome Perſons, and to gain this point of them however; becauſe it would retrench <hi>nine</hi> parts in <hi>ten</hi> of the <hi>evil-ſpeaking</hi> that is in the World.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Secondly,</hi> Before you ſpeak evil of any man, conſider whether he hath not ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liged you by ſome real kindneſs, and then it is a bad return to ſpeak ill of him who hath done us good. Conſider alſo, whether you may not come hereafter to be acquainted with him, related to him, or obliged by him whom you have thus injured? And how will you then be a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhamed
<pb n="448" facs="tcp:33693:233"/>
when you reflect upon it, and perhaps have reaſon alſo to believe that he to whom you have done this injury is not ignorant of it?</p>
                  <p>Conſider likewiſe, whether in the change of Humane affairs, you may not ſome time or other come to ſtand in need of his favour; and how incapable this carriage of yours towards him will render you of it? And whether it may not be in his power to revenge a ſpiteful and needleſs word by a ſhrewd turn? So that if a man made no conſci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence of hurting others, yet he ſhould in prudence have ſome conſideration of him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Thirdly,</hi> Let us accuſtom our ſelves to pity the Faults of men and to be truly ſorry for them, and then we ſhall take no pleaſure in publiſhing them. And this common Humanity requires of us, conſidering the great infirmities of hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mane Nature, and that we our ſelves alſo are liable to be tempted: Conſidering likewiſe, how ſevere a Puniſhment every Fault and miſcarriage is to it ſelf; and how terribly it expoſeth a man to the wrath of God, both in this World and the other. He is not a good <hi>Chriſtian,</hi> that is not heartily ſorry for the faults
<pb n="449" facs="tcp:33693:233"/>
even of his greateſt Enemies; and if he be ſo, he will diſcover them no further than is neceſſary to ſome good end.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Fourthly,</hi> When-ever we hear any man evil-ſpoken of, if we know any good of him let us ſay <hi>that.</hi> It is always the more humane and the more honourable part to ſtand up in the defence and vin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dication of others, than to accuſe and beſpatter them. Poſſibly the good you have heard of them may not be true, but it is much more probable that the evil which you have heard of them is not true neither: However, it is better to preſerve the credit of a bad man, than to ſtain the Reputation of the innocent. And if there were any need that a man ſhould be evil-ſpoken of, it is but fair and equal that his good and bad Quali<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties ſhould be mention'd together; other<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe he may be ſtrangely miſrepreſented, and an indifferent Man may be made a Monſter.</p>
                  <p>They that will obſerve nothing in a Wiſe man, but his over-ſights and fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lies; nothing in a Good man, but his failings and infirmities; may make a ſhift to render a very wiſe and good man very deſpicable. If one ſhould heap to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether all the paſſionate Speeches, all the
<pb n="450" facs="tcp:33693:234"/>
froward and imprudent Actions of the beſt Man; all that he had ſaid, or done amiſs in his whole Life, and preſent it all at one view, concealing his Wiſdom and Vertues; the Man in this Diſguiſe would look like a <hi>Mad-man</hi> or a <hi>Fury:</hi> And yet if his Life were fairly repre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſented, and juſt in the ſame manner it was led; and his many and great Vir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tues ſet over againſt his failings and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firmities, he would appear to all the World to be an admirable and excellent Perſon. But how many and great ſoe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver any man's ill Qualities are, it is but juſt that with all this heavy load of Faults he ſhould have the due praiſe of the few real Virtues that are in him.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Fifthly,</hi> That you may not ſpeak ill of any, do not delight to hear ill of them. Give no countenance to <hi>buſy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bodies,</hi> and thoſe that love to talk of o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther men's Faults: Or if you cannot de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cently reprove them becauſe of their Quality, then divert the diſcourſe ſome other way; or if you cannot do that, by ſeeming not to mind it, you may ſufficiently ſignifie that you do not like it.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Sixthly,</hi> Let every man mind himſelf, and his own Duty and Concernment. Do
<pb n="451" facs="tcp:33693:234"/>
but endeavour in good earneſt to mend thy ſelf, and it will be work enough for one Man, and leave thee but little time to talk of others. When <hi>Plato</hi> withdrew from the Court of <hi>Dionyſius,</hi> who would fain have had a famous <hi>Philoſopher</hi> for his Flatterer, they parted in ſome un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kindneſs, and <hi>Dionyſius</hi> bade him not to ſpeak ill of him when he was return'd into <hi>Greece; Plato</hi> told him, <hi>he had no leiſure for it</hi>; meaning that he had bet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter things to mind, than to take up his thoughts and talk with the faults of ſo bad a man, ſo notoriouſly known to all the World.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Laſtly,</hi> Let us ſet a watch before the door of our lips, and not ſpeak but upon conſideration: I do not mean to ſpeak <hi>finely,</hi> but <hi>fitly.</hi> Eſpecially when thou ſpeakeſt of others, conſider of <hi>whom,</hi> and <hi>what</hi> thou art going to ſpeak: Uſe great Caution and Circumſpection in this mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter: Look well about thee; on every ſide of the thing, and on every perſon in the Company, before thy words ſlip from thee; which when they are once out of thy lips, are for ever out of thy power.</p>
                  <p>Not that men ſhould be ſullen in com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pany, and ſay nothing; or ſo ſtiff in
<pb n="452" facs="tcp:33693:235"/>
converſation, as to drop nothing but <hi>Aphoriſms</hi> and <hi>Oracles:</hi> Eſpecially, a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mong Equals and Friends, we ſhould not be ſo reſerved as if we would have it ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken for a mighty favour that we vouch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſafe to ſay any thing. If a Man had the underſtanding of an <hi>Angel,</hi> he muſt be contented to abate ſomething of this ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſs of <hi>Wiſdom,</hi> for fear of being thought <hi>Cunning.</hi> The true Art of Converſation, if any body can hit upon it, ſeems to be this; an appearing freedom and open<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs, with a reſolute reſervedneſs as lit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle appearing as is poſſible.</p>
                  <p>All that I mean by this <hi>Caution</hi> is, that we ſhould conſider well what we ſay, eſpecially of others. And to this end we ſhould endeavour to get our minds furniſhed with matter of Diſcourſe con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerning things uſeful in themſelves, and not hurtful to others: And, if we have but a Mind wiſe enough, and good e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nough, we may eaſily find a Field large enough for innocent Converſation; ſuch as will harm no body, and yet be accep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>table enough to the better and wiſer part of Mankind: And why ſhould any one be at the coſt of playing the fool to gra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tifie any body whatſoever?</p>
                  <p>
                     <pb n="453" facs="tcp:33693:235"/>I have done with the <hi>Five</hi> things I propounded to ſpeak to upon this Argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment. But becauſe hardly any thing can be ſo clear, but ſomething may be ſaid againſt it; nor any thing ſo bad, but ſomething may be pleaded in excuſe for it: I ſhall therefore take notice of two or three <hi>Pleas</hi> that may be made for it.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Firſt,</hi> Some pretend mighty injury and provocation. If in the ſame kind, it ſeems thou art ſenſible of it; and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore thou of all men oughteſt to abſtain from it: But in what kind ſoever it be, the Chriſtian Religion forbids Revenge. Therefore do not plead one Sin in excuſe of another, and make <hi>Revenge</hi> an Apolo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gy for <hi>Reviling.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Secondly,</hi> It is alledged by others, with a little better grace, that if this Doctrine were practiſed, Converſation would be ſpoil'd, and there would not be matter enough for pleaſant diſcourſe and enter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainment.</p>
                  <p>I anſwer, The deſign of this Diſcourſe is to redreſs a great evil in Converſation, and that I hope which mends it will not ſpoil it. And however, if men's Tongues lay a little more ſtill, and moſt of us
<pb n="454" facs="tcp:33693:236"/>
ſpake a good deal leſs than we do, both of our ſelves and others, I ſee no great harm in it: I hope we might for all that live comfortably and in good health, and ſee many good days. <hi>David,</hi> I am ſure, preſcribes it as an excellent <hi>Receipt,</hi> in his Opinion, for a quiet, and cheerful, and long Life, to refrain from evil-ſpeak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing;<note place="margin">Pſal. 34.12, 13.</note> 
                     <hi>What man is he that deſireth life, and loveth many days that he may ſee good? Keep thy tongue from evil, and thy lips from ſpeaking falſehood.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>But granting that there is ſome plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure in <hi>Invective,</hi> I hope there is a great deal more in <hi>Innocence:</hi> And the more any man conſiders this, the truer he will find it; and when-ever we are ſerious, we our ſelves cannot but acknowledge it. When a man examines himſelf imparti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally before the <hi>Sacrament,</hi> or is put in mind upon a <hi>Death-bed</hi> to make repa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration for Injuries done in this kind, he will then certainly be of this mind and wiſh he had not done them. For this certainly is one neceſſary qualification for the <hi>Bleſſed Sacrament,</hi> that we <hi>be in love and charity with our neighbours</hi>; with which temper of mind this quality is ut<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terly inconſiſtent.</p>
                  <p>
                     <pb n="455" facs="tcp:33693:236"/>
                     <hi>Thirdly,</hi> There is yet a more ſpecious <hi>Plea</hi> than either of the former, that men will be encouraged to do ill if they can eſcape the tongues of men; as they would do, if this Doctrine did effectually take place: Becauſe by this means one great reſtraint from doing evil would be taken away, which theſe good men who are ſo bent upon reforming the World, think would be great pity. For many who will venture upon the diſpleaſure of God, will yet abſtain from doing bad things for fear of reproach from Men: Beſides, that this ſeems the moſt proper puniſhment of many Faults which the Laws of Men can take no notice of.</p>
                  <p>Admitting all this to be true, yet it does not ſeem ſo good and laudable a way to puniſh one Fault by another: But let no man encourage himſelf in an evil way with this hope, that he ſhall eſcape the cenſure of men: When I have ſaid all I can, there will, I fear, be evil-ſpeaking enough in the World to chaſtiſe them that do ill: And though we ſhould hold our peace, there will be bad tongues enow to reproach men with their evil-doings. I wiſh we could but be perſua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded to make the Experiment for a little while, whether men would not be ſuffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciently
<pb n="456" facs="tcp:33693:237"/>
laſh'd for their Faults, though we ſate by and ſaid nothing.</p>
                  <p>So that there is no need at all that good Men ſhould be concern'd in this odious Work. There will always be Of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fenders and <hi>Malefactors</hi> enow to be the <hi>Executioners</hi> to inflict this puniſhment upon one another. Therefore let no man preſume upon Impunity on the one hand; and on the other, let no man deſpair but that this buſineſs will be ſufficiently done one way or other. I am very much mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtaken, if we may not ſafely truſt an ill-natur'd World that there will be no fai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lure of Juſtice in this kind.</p>
                  <p>And here, if I durſt, I would fain have ſaid a word or two concerning that more publick ſort of <hi>Obloquy</hi> by <hi>Lampoons</hi> and <hi>Libels,</hi> ſo much in faſhion in this witty Age. But I have no mind to provoke a very terrible ſort of men. Yet thus much I hope may be ſaid without offence, that how much ſoever men are pleas'd to ſee others abuſed in this kind, yet it is al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ways grievous when it comes to their own turn: However I cannot but hope that every man that impartially conſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders muſt own it to be a fault of a very high nature to revile thoſe whom God hath placed in Authority over us, and
<pb n="457" facs="tcp:33693:237"/>
                     <hi>to ſlander the footſteps of the Lord's A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nointed:</hi> Eſpecially ſince it is ſo expreſsly written, <hi>Thou ſhalt not ſpeak evil of the Rulers of thy People.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Having repreſented the great evil of this Vice, it might not now be impro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per to ſay ſomething to thoſe who ſuffer by it. Are we guilty of the evil ſaid of us? Let us reform, and cut off all occa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſions for the future; and ſo turn the ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lice of our Enemies to our own advan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tage, and defeat their ill intentions by making ſo good an uſe of it: And then it will be well for us to have been evil ſpoken of.</p>
                  <p>Are we innocent? We may ſo much the better bear it patiently; imitating herein the Pattern of our <hi>Bleſſed Savi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>our, Who when he was reviled, reviled not again, but committed himſelf to him that judgeth righteouſly.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>We may conſider likewiſe, that though it be a misfortune to be evil-ſpoken of, it is their fault that do it, and not ours; and therefore ſhould not put us into Paſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion, becauſe another man's being inju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rious to me is no good reaſon why I ſhould be uneaſie to my ſelf. We ſhould
<pb n="458" facs="tcp:33693:238"/>
not revenge the injuries done to us, no not upon them that do them, much leſs upon our ſelves. Let no man's Provo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cation make thee to loſe thy Patience. Be not ſuch a fool, as to part with any one Virtue becauſe ſome men are ſo ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>licious as to endeavour to rob thee of the Reputation of all the reſt. When men ſpeak ill of thee, do as <hi>Plato</hi> ſaid he would do in that caſe; <hi>Live ſo, as that no body may believe them.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>All that now remains is to reflect up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on what hath been ſaid, and to urge you and my ſelf to do accordingly. For all is nothing, if we do not practiſe what we ſo plainly ſee to be our Duty. Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny are ſo taken up with the deep <hi>Points</hi> and <hi>Myſteries</hi> of Religion, that they ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver think of the common <hi>Duties</hi> and <hi>Offices</hi> of humane Life. But <hi>Faith</hi> and a <hi>good Life</hi> are ſo far from claſhing with one another, that the <hi>Chriſtian Religion</hi> hath made them inſeparable. True <hi>Faith</hi> is neceſſary in order to a <hi>good Life,</hi> and a <hi>good Life</hi> is the genuine product of a <hi>right Belief</hi>; and therefore the <hi>one</hi> ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver ought to be preſs'd to the prejudice of the <hi>other.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>
                     <pb n="459" facs="tcp:33693:238"/>I foreſee what will be ſaid, becauſe I have heard it ſo often ſaid in the like caſe; that there is <hi>not one word of Jeſus Chriſt in all this.</hi> No more is there in the <hi>Text.</hi> And yet I hope that <hi>Jeſus Chriſt</hi> is truly preach'd, when-ever his <hi>Will</hi> and <hi>Laws,</hi> and the <hi>Duties</hi> injoyn'd by the <hi>Chriſtian Religion</hi> are inculcated upon us.</p>
                  <p>But ſome men are pleaſed to ſay, that <hi>this is mere Morality:</hi> I anſwer, that this is <hi>Scripture-Morality</hi> and <hi>Chriſtian-Morality,</hi> and who hath any thing to ſay againſt <hi>that?</hi> Nay, I will go yet further, that no man ought to pretend to believe the <hi>Chriſtian Religion,</hi> who lives in the neglect of ſo plain a <hi>Duty</hi>; and in the practice of a <hi>Sin</hi> ſo clearly condemn'd by it, as this of <hi>evil-ſpeaking</hi> is.</p>
                  <p>But becauſe <hi>the Word of God is quick and powerful, and ſharper than a two-edged Sword,</hi> yea ſharper than <hi>Calumny</hi> it ſelf; and pierceth the very Hearts and Conſciences of men, laying us open to our ſelves, and convincing us of our more ſecret as well as our more viſible Faults; I ſhall therefore at one view re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſent to you what is diſperſedly ſaid
<pb n="460" facs="tcp:33693:239"/>
concerning this <hi>Sin</hi> in the <hi>Holy Word of God.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>And I have purpoſely reſerved this to the laſt, becauſe it is more perſuaſive and penetrating than any Humane Diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>courſe. And to this end be pleas'd to conſider in what company the <hi>Holy Ghoſt</hi> doth uſually mention this <hi>Sin.</hi> There is ſcarce any <hi>black Catalogue</hi> of <hi>Sins</hi> in the <hi>Bible</hi> but we find this among them;<note place="margin">Matth. 15.19.</note> in the company of the very worſt <hi>Actions</hi> and moſt irregular <hi>Paſſions</hi> of men. <hi>Out of the heart,</hi> ſays our <hi>Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viour, proceed evil thoughts, murders, a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dulteries, fornications, falſe-witneſs, evil-ſpeakings.</hi>
                     <note place="margin">Rom. 1.29.</note> And the <hi>Apoſtle</hi> ranks <hi>back<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>biters</hi> with <hi>fornicators,</hi> and <hi>murderers,</hi> and <hi>haters of God</hi>; and with thoſe of whom it is expreſsly ſaid that <hi>they ſhall not inherit the Kingdom of God.</hi>
                     <note place="margin">1 Cor. 6.10.</note>
                  </p>
                  <p>And when he enumerates the Sins of <hi>the laſt times,</hi>
                     <note place="margin">2 Tim. 3.2, 3.</note> 
                     <hi>Men,</hi> ſays he, <hi>ſhall be lo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vers of themſelves, covetous, boaſters, evil-ſpeakers, without natural affection, perfi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dious, falſe accuſers,</hi> &amp;c. And which is the ſtrangeſt of all, they who are ſaid to be guilty of theſe great Vices and Enormities are noted by the <hi>Apoſtle</hi> to be great pretenders to Religion; for ſo
<pb n="461" facs="tcp:33693:239"/>
it follows in the next words, <hi>Having a form of godlineſs, but denying the power thereof.</hi> So that it is no new thing for men to make a more than ordinary profeſſion of <hi>Chriſtianity,</hi> and yet at the ſame time to live in a moſt palpable contradiction to the Precepts of that <hi>Holy Religion:</hi> As if any pretence to <hi>Myſtery</hi> and I know not what extraor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinary <hi>attainments</hi> in the knowledge of <hi>Chriſt,</hi> could exempt men from obedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence to his Laws, and ſet them above the Vertues of a good Life.</p>
                  <p>And now after all this, do we hardly think <hi>that</hi> to be a Sin, which is in <hi>Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture</hi> ſo frequently rank'd with <hi>Murther</hi> and <hi>Adultery</hi> and the <hi>blackeſt Crimes</hi>; ſuch as are inconſiſtent with the life and power of Religion, and will certainly ſhut men out of the Kingdom of God? Do we believe the <hi>Bible</hi> to be the <hi>Word of God?</hi> and can we allow our ſelves in the common practice of a <hi>Sin,</hi> than which there is hardly any Fault of men's Lives more frequently mention'd, more ſeverely reprov'd, and more odiouſly branded in that <hi>Holy Book?</hi>
                  </p>
