            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            <p>TO the end that all Impartial People may have a right under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtanding
in the preſent Proſecution, I intend to give a ſhort
Relation of the firſt riſe and cauſe and ground of this pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent
Difference, and Perſecution.</p>
            <p>In the Year 1689. by the good Providence of God <hi>George Keith</hi> was
earneſtly invited to remove from his Plantation in <hi>Eaſt-Jarſey,</hi> to
keep a School in <hi>Philadelphia,</hi> which he did; but kept an Uſher and
ſpent a great part of his time in Reading, Meditation, Viſiting Mee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tings,
and anſwering the Conſcientious Doubts and Queſtions of many
People; and there was a more than ordinary ſeeming Satisfaction in
general among the People called <hi>Quakers,</hi> that they were ſo favoured
with the aſſiſtance of <hi>George Keith.</hi> But alas! this great love was
but ſhort liv'd; and as in other Caſes one Extream begets the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary,
ſo in this; for their love and reſpects to him were never ſo
great, but now the Envy and Hatred of many exceeds; and that upon
the account of his Chriſtian Teſtimony. For it was but a little time
that he had been amongſt us, and preached the true Faith of Chriſt,
both without and within, but ſome began to be diſſatisfied, and whiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pered
it about in private, which, when he came to underſtand, he
laboured in much love and tenderneſs to undeceive and ſatisfie thoſe
that he came to know were diſſatisfied; and ſome did receive good
Satisfaction; but others caſt his Labours of Love behind their backs;
and much whiſpering and back-biting there were in private againſt

               </gap>octrine held forth by <hi>G. K.</hi> and ſome began to contradict his
Teſtimony in publick Meetings; but yet this were born with, and
no open Difference until one <hi>William Stockdale</hi> accuſed <hi>Geo. Keith</hi> of
<hi>Preaching <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>wo Chriſts,</hi> becauſe he held forth (as neceſſary to our Sal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vation)
<hi>The Faith of Chriſt as he dyed for our Sins, roſe again for our
Juſtification, and aſcended into Heaven and is in Heaven in the true and
intire glorified Nature of Man, our Mediator with the Father;</hi> and alſo,
<hi>That Chriſt was ſpiritually preſent by his Light &amp; Life, in all his Children.</hi>
Whereupon he dealt with him, and endeavoured much to convince
<pb n="2" facs="tcp:59229:3"/>
him, but not prevailing, <hi>G. K.</hi> laid it before a Meeting of them of
the Miniſtry, but they did nothing in the matter, but chiefly blame
and contradict <hi>G. K.</hi> in his Doctrine. Whereupon <hi>G. K.</hi> did again
renew his Complaint to them of the Miniſtry at the Yearly Meeting at
<hi>Philadelphia</hi> the 7th Month, 1691. desiring to know their ſence and
judgment, <hi>viz. Whether to preach Faith in Christ within us, and Faith
in Chriſt without us, was to preach Two Chriſts, or One?</hi> and ſix Meetings
were held in debate about this matter, and yet nothing done in it: So
this paſt on, and ſome Months after <hi>Tho Fitzwater</hi> openly in a Monthly
Meeting accuſed <hi>G. Keith, That he denyed the ſufficiency of the Light;</hi>
which G. K. denyed, but T. F. ſaid, <hi>he would prove it at the next Monthly
Meeting;</hi> which being come, G. K. called on <hi>T. Fitzwater</hi> to prove
his Charge, which he endeavoured to do, and brought <hi>W. Stockdale</hi>
for his Evidence, but to no purpoſe, only <hi>W. Stockdale</hi> again renew<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
his Charge againſt G. K. in the open Meeting, to the admiration of
many, to ſee his great Ignorance and Impudence; but ſeeing that
T. F. was not like to prove his Charge againſt G. K. <hi>Thomas Lloyd,</hi> and
ſome few others with drew, yet the generality of the Meeting ſtayed,
and after ſome time it growing dark, <hi>John Jennet,</hi> (a great ſtickler
againſt G K.) deſired that the Meeting might be adjourned till the next
day, which was unanimouſly agreed unto, and alſo by <hi>Tho. Fitzwater;</hi>
the next day all Parties appeared, and great and long Contention
there was moſt part of that day betwixt <hi>George Keith</hi> and <hi>Tho. Lloyd,
Arthur Cook, &amp;c.</hi> G. K. affirming and arguing for the <hi>Neceſſity of the
Faith of Chriſt crucified, &amp;c.</hi> the others denying, and arguing, <hi>That the
Light wit<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

that the ſtream went againſt them, <hi>T. Lloyd, A. Cook</hi> and ſome others
with-drew, and the Meeting (conſiſting of at leaſt Sixty Monthly
Meeting Members proceeded &amp; gave Judgment againſt <hi>T. Fitzwater</hi>
and <hi>W. Stockdale,</hi> the ſubſtance of which was, <hi>That they ſhould forbear
preaching and praying in Meetings till they had condemned their Ignorance
and Vnbelief, &amp;c.</hi> but at the next Quarterly Meeting, a Party with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtood
the ſaid Judgments, and ſaid, <hi>That the Perſons being Miniſters,
none but them of the Miniſtry were fit to judge;</hi> which many thought
reliſht too much of <hi>Popery;</hi> yet notwithſtanding many ſhowed their
diſlike thereto, <hi>Tho. Lloyd, Arthur Cook, Sam. Jenings, &amp;c.</hi> denyed

               </gap>d Meeting and Judgment; &amp; then it was that <hi>T. Lloyd</hi>'s Party
changed their time and place of meeting againſt and contrary to the
<pb n="3" facs="tcp:59229:3"/>
declared mind of their then Brethren, who gave their Reaſons why
they conſented not to the changing the Time and Place of meeting;
but prevailed nothing with them, for the next firſt Day <hi>George Keith</hi>
and Party met at the <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="2 letters">
                  <desc>••</desc>
               </gap>ual time and place, and <hi>Tho. Lloyd</hi> and party
went to the Meeting houſe at the Centre, which made the firſt Sepera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion.
Now the Difference being thus far advanced, cauſed much
diſcourſe and enquiry into the matter by all ſorts of People, and great
flocking to Meetings there was, both in Town and Country, where
G. K. came, and his Teſtimony had much Reception in the hearts of
many; which being perceived by <hi>Tho. Lloyd</hi> and Party, the only Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pe<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

they could deviſe, was to condemn <hi>G. K.</hi> whereupon the 20th
of the 4th Mon. 1692. Twenty Eight of them called Miniſters met
together at <hi>Philadelphia,</hi> &amp; without ever ſo much as acquainting G. K.
publiſhed a Paper of Judgment againſt him, condemning him as a
<hi>Perſon without the fear of God before <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>is Eyes,</hi> &amp;c. which done, <hi>Thomas
Lloyd, Samuell Jenings, Arthur Cook, John Delavall,</hi> and others made
it their buſineſs to follow G. K. from Meeting to Meeting, violently
oppoſing his Teſtimony, and ſometimes making uſe of their Magiſtra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tical
Power to effect their deſigns, which cauſed great Conteſts and
Confuſions; and G. K. from time to time complaining of their In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>juſtice,
for condemning of him without all Hearing or Tryal, upon a
time in <hi>Cheſter</hi>-County, <hi>Tho. Llyod</hi> ſaid, <hi>George, if thou thinkeſt thy ſelf
agrieved by that Judgment, there is Relief for thee; thou may appeal to the
Yearly Meeting, which is now approaching;</hi> which advice G. K. followed,
and made an Appeal to the ſaid Yearly Meeting, and propoſed twelve
particular Heads to be conſidered, diſcourſed of and reſolved by the
People called <hi>Quakers</hi> at the ſaid Yearly meeting, and that they might
have Timely notice of the ſaid Appeal, and be the better prepared to
anſwer it, G. K. procured the ſaid <hi>Appeal</hi> to be printed. Which was
no ſooner done, but they Iſſued forth a Warrant, and apprehended
<hi>William Bradford</hi> the Printer, and <hi>John M“Comb,</hi> who (as they were
informed) had diſpoſed of two of the ſaid Papers, and committed
the ſaid <hi>W. B.</hi> and <hi>J. M.</hi> to Goal; and alſo ſeized all the ſaid Papers
they could meet with, and took away a good quantity of <hi>W. Bradfords</hi>
Letters, tending to the diſabling of him to work for his Wife
and Children; and upon pretence of another Warrant granted with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out
any Conviction, signed by <hi>Samuell Jenings</hi> &amp; <hi>Robert Ewer</hi> Juſtices,
<hi>John White,</hi> the Sheriff, took Goods out of the Shop of <hi>Will. Bradford</hi>
               <pb n="4" facs="tcp:59229:4"/>
half as much more as the ſaid Warrant was for. Whether theſe
Actions are moſt like to the poor deſpiſed and perſecuted <hi>Quakers,</hi> or
their Perſecutors, is left to all Impartial People to judge.</p>

            <p>Now tho' they had got theſe two poor men into Goal, and though
all ſober People did reſent their Proceedings very ill, and as proceed<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding
from a cruel Spirit of Perſecution; yet the next day they met
again, in order to proceed againſt G. K. and ſeveral other Perſons in
the like manner, and ſent for two other Juſtices that were not called
<hi>Quakers,</hi> to aſſiſt them in this work of Proſecuting ſeveral ſeditious
and dangerous Perſons, that were like to ſubvert the Government!
as they pretended; but contrary to their expectation, the ſaid two
Juſtices that were not called <hi>Quakers,</hi> viz. <hi>Lacy Cock</hi> a <hi>Lutherain,</hi> and
<hi>John Holme</hi> a <hi>Baptist,</hi> declared their diſſent from them in theſe Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceedings,
ſignifying, <hi>That the matter was a Religious Difference among

John Holme</hi> particularly adviſing them <hi>To ſend for</hi> Geo. Keith, <hi>and let

him interpret his own words, and upon a hearing of him, if it any way appears

with them; whereupon the ſaid two Juſtices left them, and our New
modelled Perſecuting <hi>Quakers</hi> being warmly bent to root out Sedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
forſooth! proceeded in their Work, and as they had judged <hi>G. K.</hi>
in their Spiritual Court without all Hearing or Tryal, ſo in like man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner
they proſecuted him in their Temporal Court without all Hearing:
Why! to have done otherwiſe would have given the Lye and Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tradiction
to their <hi>Spirit of Diſcerning,</hi> which juſtice <hi>Cook</hi> declared to
be ſuch, <hi>That they could judge of matter of Fact without Evidence;</hi> and
therefore it would have been ridiculous for them to have ſent for G. K.
and asked him, <hi>Whether he was the Author of ſuch a Paper that his Name
was to?</hi> or to have enquired of him, <hi>Whether it was againſt the Govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
that he intended by ſuch and ſuch words therein?</hi> No, for their Spirit
of <hi>Diſcerning</hi> told them all that, and therefore without more to do,
proclaimed G. K. by the common Cryer in the Market-place, <hi>To
be a Seditious Perſon, and an Enemy to the King and Queens Government:</hi>
But theſe Magiſtrates would do well to conſider the Actions and End
of <hi>Empſon</hi> and <hi>Dudly,</hi> and whether they have not violated the Funda<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mental
Laws of <hi>Engliſh Subjects</hi> as well as they, and that in convicting

               </gap> paſſage might have been ſpared: Oh, but 'tis plain their

brought before the Governour to anſwer to ſome heinous Crime and Miſde<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>meanour,
and that a Multitude of People were preſent to hear how he could

<hi>like a Rude man, tho' he pretends to be a Miniſter, was ſo far from behaving

                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>ristian, that he fell a Reviling him, and
amongſt other ſcandalous Expreſſions, ſaid to him, Thou Impudent Man,
thou art not fit to be Governour, thy Name will stink:</hi> Certainly their
drift was to poſſeſs the Readers with this Belief, as is clear and evident
from their following ſuppoſition, or rather ſuggeſtion, where they ſay,
<hi>He that uſeth ſuch Exorbitancy of Speech to the Governour, will eaſily dare
to call the Members of Council and Magistrates Impudent Raſcals, as he hath
lately called one in on open Aſſembly, who was conſtituted by the Governour
to be a Magiſtrate.</hi> Which alſo is a baſe and wicked Inſinuation; for
<hi>George Keith</hi> never ſpoke thoſe words to any of them as Magiſtrates or
Officers in the Government, neither did he ever ſpeak to the preſent
Governour all thoſe words together, as is inſinuated by the ſaid Paper,
but on the contrary, what he ſpoke to <hi>Tho. Lloyd</hi> was in Monthly
Meetings and Religious Controverſies, and <hi>T. Lloyd</hi> hath ſaid ſeveral
<pb n="8" facs="tcp:59229:6"/>
times, <hi>That he would take no advantage by words ſpoke at ſuch times;</hi> but
we find them practiſe the contrary; for on a certain time <hi>T. L.</hi> ſtood
up, and affirmed, <hi>That</hi> G. K. <hi>was guilty of Contradiction,</hi> and being put
to prove it, ſaid, <hi>That fifteen years ago in his printed Books he owned the
Seed to be Chriſt:</hi> Whereupon <hi>G. K.</hi> ſaid, <hi>Thou Impudent man, I do
not deny it now, but own it as much as ever.</hi> But by all the diligent en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quiry
that I have made, I cannot find that <hi>G. K.</hi> ſaid, he was not fit
to be Governour, but if he had ſo ſaid, I query, Whether it was ſuch
an intollerable Expreſſion? 1<hi>ſt.</hi> Becauſe its expreſly provided by the
ſecond Chapter of the Laws of this Province, <hi>That all Officers and
Perſons commiſſionated and imployed in the Government, ſhall be ſuch as pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſs
and declare, They believe in Jeſus Chriſt to be the Son of God the Saviour
of the World, &amp;c.</hi> But, 2<hi>dly, The Lloyd</hi> its well known, has often
denyed and argued againſt the <hi>Faith of Christ, as he dyed for our ſins,
&amp;c.</hi> And as to G. K. ſaying, <hi>That his Name would stink, T. L.</hi> knows
in his Conſcience, that it was ſpoke to him only as he was one of the
28 unjuſt Judges, for giving of falſe Judgment againſt him, and that
without all hearing or Tryal. And as touching the Perſon whom they
ſay, he call'd, <hi>Impudent Raſcal,</hi> it was one whom he know not to be
conſtituted, as they ſay he was; but his Brother being ſo conſtituted,
and refuſing to ſerve, the People of the Town choſe him in his Brothers

I wist not Brethren that it was the High Prieſt,</hi> might be an Apology for

But this Perſon whom they mention, went about to deceive his Neigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bours
by falſe and weak Arguments, <hi>viz. That he did not expect to be
ſaved by that which dyed at</hi> Jeruſalem; <hi>And that God was not preſent in

<pb n="9" facs="tcp:59229:6"/>

ſaid, in a rude and boiſterous manner, <hi>What</hi> George!
<hi>Doth the Spirit of God ſpeak in Trees?</hi> Whereupon G. K. ſaid
(being greatly provoked by his Interrupting of him, and Unchri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtian
Behaviour and Diſcourſe) <hi>Thou Impudent Raſcal, who ſaith the
Spirit of God ſpeaks in Trees, as it doth in men?</hi> But to make the thing

<hi>That before long he'll go into the Council Room, and into the Courts, and
there Revile the Councilors and Magiſtrates, &amp; call them Impudent Raſcals.</hi>
Oh, the Horrid Impudency of theſe Men! Let Shame cover their
faces, if they have any left in them!</p>
            <p>And whereas they further ſay, <hi>That</hi> G. K. <hi>with ſeveral of his Adhe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rents

            <p>
               <hi>W. Bradford,</hi> We are hear only to deſire that which is the Right of

            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>W. B.</hi> I do not know wherein I have broke any Law, ſo as to incur
any ſuch Puniſhment.</p>
            <p>Juſtice <hi>Jenings, Thou art very ignorant in the Law ſurely, does not
thou know that there's a Law that every Printer ſhall put his Name to the
Books he prints, or his Preſ<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>is forfeited.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>W. B.</hi> I know there was ſuch a Law, and I know when it expired.</p>
            <p>J. Cook. <hi>But it is revived again, and is in force, and without any regard
to the matter of the Book, provides, that the Printer ſhall put his Name to
all that he prints, which thou haſt not done.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>But waving from that, the Priſoners ſtill preſt for a Tryal. To
which Juſtice <hi>Cook</hi> ſaid, <hi>A Tryal you ſhall have, and that to your Coſt too,
it may be.</hi> And juſtice <hi>Jenings</hi> ſaid, <hi>A Tryal you ſhall have, but for ſome
Reaſon known to us, the Court defers it to the next Seſſions; and that is the
Anſwer we give, and no other you ſhall have.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>All this time, <hi>John White,</hi> Sheriff, pleaded vehemently againſt the
Priſoners, greatly aggravating their (pretended) Crimes; and when
complained of, that the Sheriff, (through whoſe hands goes all Fines
and Forfeitures) ſhould be ſo bitter an Attorney againſt the Priſoners,
he cloaked it under the Viſor of a <hi>Prothonitor.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>So this Court paſſed over, &amp; the ſaid Perſons not brought to Tryal,
but yet not wholly barren of Action, nor void of Iujuſtice; for tho'
they had not only got <hi>W. Bradford</hi> into Priſon, and taken his Letters
from him, (with which he ſhould work) and his Paper and Books out
of his Shop, but alſo they had got the Body of <hi>John M“Comb,</hi> with
which one would think they might have been ſatisfied, had any thing
of tenderneſs remained in them, the time they committed him being
when his Wife was newly brought to Bed, and who lay very weak in
a ſtrong Feaver, and ſeveral thought ſhe would not live, and tho he
acquainted them of her Condition, and how deſtitute his Family was,
requſting them to let him go home, and he would promiſe to be ready
at any time they ſhould call for him; This they would not grant, but
to Priſon he was ſent; (<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

an Evening after it was dark) yet our hot ſpur'd Juſtices (being new<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly

with having his Body, would do what in them lay, to ruin him and
his Family; for whereas he kept an Ordinary, and for his Liſence ſo

<hi>Three Pound Twelve Shillings</hi> for the laſt twelve Months before [<hi>No

of ſome Law-Books, and ſome Laws of this Province againſt defaming
Magiſtrates.</p>
            <p>To which the Attorneys of <hi>Peter Boſs</hi> pleaded, That he acknowledg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
the writing that Letter, but what was ſaid therein concerning
<hi>S. Jenings,</hi> was not againſt him as he was a Magiſtrate, nor could it
be reckoned a Defamation, becauſe 'twas only a private Letter ſent to
himſelf, ſhowing his diſlike in ſome things, and deſiring him to clear
himſelf of other groſs &amp; ſcandalous things that were reported of him,
as is uſual for one Church Member to do to another; &amp; they brought
a Cafe out of <hi>Shepherd</hi>s <hi>Faithful Counſellor,</hi> that what is ſaid muſt be
<hi>Falſo &amp; Malicioſe,</hi> i. e. falſly and maliciouſly, otherwiſe not actionable.
And that if a man ſpeak ſlightingly of a Magiſtrate, if it be when he is
not in the exerciſe of his Office, it is no defaming of him as a Magi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrate,
and ſo no treſpaſs againſt the Law alledged.</p>

<hi>Commanded Silence upon pain of Impriſonment:</hi> Whereupon ſome com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plained,

how <hi>A. Cook</hi> ſet the Chriſtian and Magiſtrate in oppoſition the one

            <p>G. K. Not guilty in manner and form. And now that I have an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwered

I think to make uſe of, unleſs ye will ſay that ſo to do is a Contempt

Jury for any thing alledged againſt me, they being no Offences againſt
the King, Governour nor Country, what <hi>I</hi> have ſaid was only againſt
particular Perſons, who if they think themſelves wronged by me, may
ſue me in their own Names, and I am ready to anſwer them.</p>
            <p>Court and Clark, <hi>It is no Contempt of Court, but the ſeaſon of your ſo
pleading is over, you ſhould have ſaid ſo before you pleaded Not Guilty;
now you muſt ſubmit to be tryed by the Country.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>G. K. I knew not this formality in Law, ye told me, ye would take
no advantage againſt me in that reſpect. But the Clark ſtill preſſing
him to come to a Tryal, G. K. further ſaid, <hi>I</hi> think not to make any
other plea; for the things for which <hi>I</hi> am preſented are not againſt
the King, Governour, nor any Nuſance to the Country, nor againſt
particular Perſons, as Magiſtrates, and therefore not preſentable.</p>
            <p>Clark, <hi>If ye refuſe to be tryed by the Jury, the Bench has Power to fine
you.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>G. K. I</hi> ſhall take my hazard of that; <hi>I</hi> have able Council that the

thy Body and Power in the Duſt, and caſt both Soul and Body into

            <p>And tho' <hi>Sam. Jenings</hi> is now ſo zealous for the proſecuting them
that ſay any thing againſt Magiſtrates, yet its not long ago that he
ſpoke much againſt <hi>Tho. Lloyd,</hi> Deputy Governour, and carried about

made againſt <hi>T. L.</hi> call'd, <hi>Taffy</hi>'s <hi>Fair,</hi> which he repeated over his Pots
of Beer to make ſport for the Company.</p>
            <p>But to return, altho' the Jury brought in a ſpecial Verdict, which
was only, <hi>That</hi> Thomas Budd <hi>was guilty of ſaying,</hi> Sam. Jenings <hi>had
ſhown himſelf too high &amp; imperious in Worldly Courts,</hi> which is no Tranſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>greſſion
of any particular Law, yet the Bench gave Judgment againſt
them as tho' they had broke ſome Law, which was, <hi>That</hi> G. K. <hi>&amp;</hi> T. B.
<hi>ſhould pay 5 l. a piece.</hi> Whereupon they finding themſelves aggrieved
by this Judgment, craved an Appeal to the Provincial Court in Law,
which was denyed them. Then by Advice of able Council, they re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>queſted
an Appeal to the King and Queen, &amp; their Council in <hi>England,</hi>
the King having reſerved all Final Appeals to himſelf, in the Charter
to W. P. But this alſo was denyed them, (tho' <hi>Robert Turner</hi> declared

that the ſaid Perſons are left without all help or remedy, but muſt un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dergo
the Arbitrary Sentence of this Court.</p>
            <p>And as a further Mark of the miſerable declenſion of theſe men, and
of their cold zeal for the honour of God, take a view of two Laws
which they now execute; the firſt is the 5th Chapter of their Laws,
where it is enacted, <hi>That whoſoever ſhall ſpeak looſely and prophanely of
Almighty God, Jeſus Chriſt, the holy Scriptures or Spirit of Truth, ſhall for
every ſuch Offence pay 5 s.</hi> The other place is Chap. 29. where it is

Quality of the Magiſtrate, provided it be not leſs than</hi> 20 s. according to

anſwer was made, <hi>That</hi> W. B. <hi>was clear of the Mutimus on the Iſſue of
the Preſentment.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Next, W. B. deſired to know what Law that Preſentment was
grounded on?</p>
            <p>D. Lloyd, <hi>It is grounded both on Statute and Common Law?</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>W. B.</hi> Pra. let me ſee that Statute and Common Law, elſe how ſhall
I make my Plea? Juſtice <hi>Cook</hi> told us laſt Court, <hi>That one reaſon why
ye deferred our Tryal then, was, that we might have time to prepare our ſelves
to anſwer it;</hi> but ye never let me have a Copy of my Preſentment, nor
will ye now let me know what Law ye proſecute me upon.</p>
            <p>D. Lloyd &amp; J. White, <hi>Its not uſual to inſert in Indictments againſt
what Statute the Offence is, when its againſt ſeveral Statutes &amp; Laws made?
and if thou wilt not plead Guilty or not Guilty, thou wilt looſe thy Opportu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity
of being tryed by thy Country.</hi> And they order'd the Clark to write
down, that <hi>W. Brad<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

                  </gap>ord</hi> refuſed to plead; which he did; but as he
writing it down, W. B. deſired they would not take that advantage
againſt him, for he refuſed not to plead, but only requeſted that which
<pb n="31" facs="tcp:59229:18"/>
was greatly neceſſary, in order to his making his own Defence; and
ſeveral in the Court requeſting on the Priſoners behalf, that the Court
would not take advantage againſt him, they admitted him to plead,
and he pleaded, <hi>Not Guilty.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Then the Jury were called over, and atteſted, <hi>viz. Humphery
Waterman, Joſeph Kirle, James Fox, Samuell Hoult, Thomas Wharton,
Tho. Marle, Nicholas Rideout, John Whitpare, Richard Sutton, Richard
Walter, Thomas Morris, Abraham Hardiman.</hi> But before they were
atteſted, they asked W. B. if he had any Exceptions to make againſt
any of them that were returned for the Jury?</p>
            <p>
               <hi>W. Bradford,</hi> Yes, I have, and particularly againſt two of them,
(and which Exceptions I think are rational,) and that is againſt <hi>Joſ. Kirle</hi>
and James <hi>Fox;</hi> for at the time when <hi>I</hi> was commited to Priſon
<hi>Arthur Cook</hi> told me, That <hi>Joſeph Kirle</hi> had ſaid, <hi>That if the proceedings
of the Magiſtrates was thus found fault with, that they muſt not defend

coming here with their <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="2 letters">

                  </gap>ſſels, &amp;c.</hi> And <hi>I</hi> except alſo againſt <hi>James Fox;</hi>
becauſe on the firſt day after <hi>Babit</hi> and his Company were taken, I
being at <hi>Sam. Carpenters,</hi> there was Governour <hi>Lloyd, James Fox,</hi> and
ſeveral others, &amp; in diſcourſe concerning taking of the ſaid Privateers,
<hi>James Fox</hi> greatly blamed <hi>W. Walker,</hi> becauſe he found fault with ſome
Juſtices that were <hi>Quakers,</hi> for commanding men, and as it were preſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing
them to go againſt the ſaid Privateers; and alſo <hi>James Fox</hi> joyned
with <hi>Tho. Lloyd</hi> in ſaying, <hi>He would mark them as Enemies to the Govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
and well being of the Province, who were neutrall in the caſe of going
against</hi> Babit, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> By which Inſtances <hi>I</hi> think it appears that theſe
two Perſons have prejudg'd the Cauſe that is now to com before them;
<hi>Joſeph Kirle</hi> acknowledged he had ſpoke ſuch words, and deſired to be
diſcharged; but they would not allow of theſe Exceptions, altho' it
is frequent in theſe Courts to change Jurors on bearly ſaying they do

            </p>
            <p>Sam. Jenings, <hi>You are only to try whether</hi> W. B. <hi>printed it, or not.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>W. Bradford,</hi> This is wrong; for the Jury are Judges in Law, as
well as in matter of Fact. Which <hi>D. Lloyd</hi> again denyed. Where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>upon
ſome of the Jury deſired to know what they were to be atteſted
to try, for they did believe in their Conſciences, they were obliged to
try and find whether that Paper was ſeditious, as well as whether <hi>Will.
Bradford</hi> printed; and ſome of them deſired to be diſcharged.—A
great Noiſe and Confuſion among the People.</p>
            <p>Some on the Bench ſhowing their willingneſs to allow of <hi>W. B's</hi> Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceptions
againſt the two Jurors, Juſtice <hi>Cook</hi> ſaid, <hi>I will not allow of it;

            </p>
            <p>Then <hi>D. Lloyd</hi> began to read the 9, 10, 11, &amp; 12 Articles of the ſaid
<hi>Appeal,</hi> and commented thereupon, denyiug, 1<hi>ſt, That any men were
hired to fight, but only to fetch back the Sloop</hi>; 2<hi>dly, That there was no
Commiſſion given, but only a Hue-and-Cry or Warrant, as might be in any
other ordinary caſe, and what was done was in caſe of great neceſſity, when
a Company of Rogues had Pyratically ſtollen away a Sloop to the great terror
of the People of this place; and if the Magiſtrates muſt be blamed for their
proceedings herein, what do you think will be the conſequence thereof, but to
encourage all manner of wickedneſs? And</hi> Will. Bradford <hi>is preſented for
printing and publiſhing this ſeditious Paper, whereof you of the Jury are to
find him guilty, if it appear to you that he has printed it.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>W. Bradford,</hi> I deſire you of the Jury, and all here preſent, to take
notice, that what is here contained in this Paper is not Seditious, but
wholly relating to a Religious Difference, and aſſerting the <hi>Quakers</hi>
antient Principles, and is not laid down poſitive, that they ought not
to have proceeded againſt the Privateers, but laid down by way of
Query, for the People called <hi>Quakers</hi> to conſider and reſolve at their
Yearly Meeting, <hi>Whether it was not a Tranſgreſſion of the</hi> Quakers <hi>Prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciples
to hire and commiſſionate men to fight?</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Juſtice <hi>Cook, If it was intended for the Yearly Meeting at</hi> Burlington,
<hi>why was it publiſhed and ſpread abroad before the Meeting?</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>VV. B.</hi> Becauſe it might be peruſed and conſidered of by Friends be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
the Meeting, even as the Bills that are prepared to be paſſed into
<pb n="35" facs="tcp:59229:19"/>
Laws, they are promulgated a certain Number of days, before the Aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſembly
meets, that all may have opportunity to conſider them.</p>
            <p>Then <hi>D. Lloyd</hi> read the Act againſt Printing, 14 <hi>Car. 2. cap. 33.</hi>
againſt Books being printed without the Printers Name to them, and
he ſaid, <hi>That was one Act which they proſecuted</hi> W. Bradford <hi>upon.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>To which <hi>G. K.</hi> anſwer'd, and it may be obſerved, the ſingular and
extraordinary Severity of theſe Juſtices, called <hi>Quakers,</hi> who will pick
out a Statute made in <hi>Old England,</hi> and proſecute a man upon here,
which might Ruin him and his Family, tho' its not certain whether
that Act be in force; whenas moſt of <hi>W. Penn</hi>'s &amp; the <hi>Quakers</hi> Books
were printed without the Printers Name to them, when that Act was
in force; and yet we never heard that any Printer in <hi>England</hi> was
proſecuted for that; and therefore theſe here have exceeded them in
<hi>England;</hi> which manifeſts their Malice and revengeful Spirit, that
becauſe they cannot fix the matter to be any Breach of the Peace (tho<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>
they pretend it is) they'll proſecute the Printer for not putting his
Name to what they ſuppoſe he Printed.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Note,</hi> That all the time theſe Perſons were upon Tryal, the grand
Jury ſate by them, over-awing and threatning them when they ſpoke
boldly in their own defence, and one of the Jury had Pen, Ink &amp; Paper
to write down ſuch words as they diſliked, ſignifying that they would
preſent them, and Juſtice <hi>Cook</hi> other times bid them take notice of
ſuch and ſuch words, thereby over-awing the Priſoners that they had
not liberty to plead treely. And when <hi>Tho. Harris,</hi> at the Requeſt of
the Priſoner began to ſay ſomething to the matter, they ſtopt him,
and bid an Officer take him away, and <hi>Arthur Cook</hi> ſaid, <hi>That he ſhould
plead no more there.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>After a long time of pleading, <hi>D. Lloyd</hi> began to ſummons up the
matter to Jury, <hi>How that the printed Appeal was a Seditious Paper, and
tended to weaken the Hands of the Magiſtrates, and encourage all
manner of Wickedneſs; and that it was evident</hi> W. Bradford <hi>printed it,
he being the Printer in this place, and the frame on which it was printed, was
found in his Houſe.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>W. B.</hi> I deſire the Jury, and all here preſent to take notice, that
there ought to be two Evidences, to prove the matter of Fact, but not
one Evidence has been brought in this caſe.</p>
            <p>Sam. Jening, <hi>The Frame on which it was printed is Evidence enough.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>W. B.</hi> But where is the Frame, there has no Frame been produced
<pb n="36" facs="tcp:59229:20"/>
here; and if there had, it is no Evidence, unleſs ye ſaw me print on it.</p>
            <p>Sam. Jenings, <hi>The Jury ſhall have the Frame with them, it cannot well
be brought here; and beſide the Seaſon is cold, and we are not to ſit here to
endanger our Health; you are minded to put Tricks upon us.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>VV. B.</hi> You of the Jury, and all here preſent, I deſire you take notice,
that here has not one Evidence been brought to prove that I printed
the Sheet, call'd, <hi>A<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

                  </gap> Appeal:</hi> And whereas they ſay, the Frame is
Evidence, which the Jury ſhall have; I ſay, the Jury ought not to
hear or have any Evidence whatſoever, but in the preſence of the
Judge and Priſoner.</p>
            <p>Yet this was nothing minded, but <hi>Sam. Jenings</hi> ſummoned up to the
Jury what they were to do, <hi>viz. To find,</hi> 1ſt. <hi>whether or nor that Paper,
call'd, the</hi> Appeal, <hi>had not a tendency to the weakening the hands of the
Magiſtrates, and encouragement of VVickedneſs</hi>: 2dly, <hi>VVhether it did
not tend to the Diſturbance of the Peace? And,</hi> 3dly, <hi>VVhether</hi> William
Bradford <hi>did not print it, without putting his Name to it, as the Law
requires?</hi>
            </p>
            <p>The Jury had a Room provided them, &amp; by that time they had been
a quarter of an hour together, the Sheriff cauſed the Frame to be car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ried
in to them, for an Evidence that W. B. printed the Appeal.</p>
            <p>The Jury continued about forty eight hours together, and could not
agree, then they came into Court to ask a Queſtion, <hi>viz. VVhether the
Law did rejui<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

<hi>D. Lloyd</hi> read a paſſage out of a Law Book, <hi>That they were to find it by
Evidences, or on their own knowledge, or otherwiſe: Now</hi> (ſays <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>. Lloyd)
<hi>this otherwiſe is the Frame which you have, which is Evidence ſufficient.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>VV. Bradford,</hi> The Frame which they have is no Evidence, for I
have not ſeen it, and how do I or the Jury know that that which was
carried in to them, is mine,—Interrupted—The Jury ſent forth
again, and an Officer commanded to keep them without Meat, Drink,
Fire or Tobacco.</p>
            <p>In the Afternoon the Jury came into Court again, and told, they
were not like to agree. Whereupon the Court diſcharged them.</p>
            <p>Then <hi>VV. Bradford</hi> told the Court, That ſeeing he had been ſo long
detained Priſoner, and his Utenſils with which he ſhould work having
been ſo long detained, he hoped now to have his Utenſils returned, &amp;
to be diſcharged from his Impriſonment.</p>
            <p>Sam. Jenings, <hi>No, thou ſhalt not have thy things again, nor be diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>charged,
<pb n="37" facs="tcp:59229:20"/>
but I now let thee know, thou ſtands in the ſame Capacity to anſwer
next Court, as before.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Next Court being come, <hi>VVill. Bradford</hi> attended, and deſired to
know whether he ſhould have his Utenſils, and be diſcharged? <hi>Arthur
Cook</hi> anſwered, <hi>Thou ſhalt not have thy Goods until releaſed by Law.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>VV. Bradford,</hi> The Law will not releaſe them, unleſs executed.</p>
            <p>Arthur Cook, <hi>If thou wilt requeſt a Tryal, thou may have it.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Whereupon I Query, 1<hi>ſt.</hi> Whether it be practicable, or according
to Law to ſeiſ<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap> mens Goods and impriſon their Perſons, and ſo detain
them under the Terror of a Goal, one ſix Months after another, and
not bring them to Tryal, unleſs requeſted by the Impriſoned?</p>

make between the Proprietor and Priſoner,</hi> Whether it be not very
illegal to abſolve them from their Oath, diſmiſs them, and put it to
another Jury to try?</p>
            <p>Now it may be obſerved, that nine of theſe Jurors were Perſons pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>judiced
againſt <hi>G. K.</hi> and the reſt, and the other three happened to be
moderate Perſons that were not called <hi>Quakers,</hi> and the reaſon they
could not agree, was (as ſome of the ſaid Jurors, called <hi>Quakers,</hi> have
told) that theſe three Perſons ſtood upon the Nicity (as they call'd it)
of Evidence that. <hi>VV. B.</hi> printed that Paper; whereas the other Jurors
called <hi>Quakers</hi> ſaid, they believed that <hi>VV. B.</hi> printed it, and that it
was a ſeditious Paper, &amp;c. and they would not acquit him.</p>
            <p>Does not this ſhow the great declenſion of theſe People from
their antient Principle againſt the uſe of Carnal Weapons, that for
only propoſing it to be enquired into, Whether it be not a Tranſgreſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion

            <p>Here follows abreviate of a Paper that was preſented to the Court,
to ſhow, that it was agreeable to the <hi>Quakers</hi> antient Teſtimony not
