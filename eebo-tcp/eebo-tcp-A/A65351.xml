            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

But that they had Kings, Rulers, and set Forms of Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernment, undertook noble Enterprises, made Invasions, subdued Countries, managed with great advice the affairs of war, and atchieved many things worthy of admiration, there is no cause to doubt. For, their exceeding long lives, having, to their strength of body, added the experience of eight hundred or nine hun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dred years, must necessarily increase their Wise<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome

and conduct, and render their underta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kings (had they been communicated to poste<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity) far more excellent, than whatever can be related of after-times.</p>
            <p>And though <hi>Moses</hi> passeth over this first Age in so short a narrative as seven brief chapters; and, writing an history of and for the Church, mentioneth no farther, the affairs and nations of the world, than was meet for the Church, that of the <hi>Israelites</hi> especially, to know, accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding as it was likely they should have then, or after, more or less to doe with them; much ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vertheless may be collected from him in relati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on to the condition of that time. For, we find that the men of those days were mighty and famous; his words <hi>Gen. 6. v.</hi> 4. being, <hi>They were mighty men, which were of old men of renown.</hi> We may stile them <hi>Hero's,</hi> such as either through their valour brought almost impossible and ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mirable attempts to an unexpected and desired issue; or such as by their vertue were the Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thors of profitable Arts and Sciences, and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duced Mankind to civil and sociable conver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sation.</p>
            <p>But it is not to be denied, that then there were mighty men in regard of bodily stature al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>so, whom the Scripture calleth from their greatness and terribleness <hi>Rephaim</hi> and <hi>Emim;</hi> from their pride <hi>Anakim;</hi> from their strength <hi>Gibborim;</hi> from their Tyranny <hi>Nephilim;</hi> from <note place="margin">Gibbons in Gen.</note> their naughtiness <hi>Zamzummim;</hi> such were <hi>Og</hi> and <hi>Goliah</hi> after the Flood. But howsoever the bodies of these men were composed, cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain it is, that before the Deluge, they divided
<pb n="3" facs="tcp:41214:8"/>
(as we by the <hi>Civil</hi> Law are now wont to doe) their goods amongst their children; assigning their Real estates to the eldest of their sons, and their Personal to the younger. For, <hi>Adam</hi> gave unto <hi>Cain</hi> Lands to Till, unto <hi>Abel</hi> Sheep to Feed.</p>
            <p>Posterity being multiplied, they fell imme<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diately to the building of Cities, fortifying of Castles, driving of Cattle, committing of Slaugh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters, and whatever else the interest of their wilfulness perswaded them unto; These things being done by them as well for necessary habi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation, as for strength and safety to secure them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves, and oppress others. That they did build Cities, no doubt is to be made; for if <hi>Iabal</hi> was the first that dwelt in Tents, Where should the rest dwell, saith <hi>Heylin,</hi> but in Citties, Towns, or Villages? And that the first of Cities was built by <hi>Cain,</hi> as also that he called it after the name of his Son <hi>Enoch,</hi> the Scripture teach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth <hi>Gen</hi> 4. <hi>v.</hi> 17. which was either erected by him, to cross that curse of his wandring to and fro; or to arme him against others, whom his guilty conscience caused him to feare; or to be a receptacle and storehouse of those spoiles, which by force and violence, <hi>Iosephus</hi> tells us, <note place="margin">Ios. <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 word">

use, several Arts were invented; <hi>One</hi> finds out the making of Tents, in which leading a wan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dring life, his robberies might be the more con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cealed, and his flocks and heards the better fed. <hi>Another</hi> the forging of iron usefull for the ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king of arms, and weapons of war<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> and what else they could of that kind. <hi>Another,</hi> Musique: whereby the affections being enflamed, they were stirred up unto those things, in which they placed their greatest happiness. So that as this race of men, acted all things not by reason, but lust; frequent contentions, private quarrels, and open war, could not but of ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cessity arise amongst them: and, though they might be well enough able from themselves to defend themselves; the other party, the chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren of <hi>Seth</hi> nevertheless lived no more safely amongst them, than silly sheep amongst raging wolves.</p>
            <p>They were as great Idolaters, if not greater <note place="margin">Idem c. 4.</note> then those of the after-age to which they gave example; for, degenerating, saith <hi>Iosephus,</hi> from the ancient institutions of their fore-fathers, they neither observed the service of God, nor humane Laws. But were fierce and cruel, full of Injustice, Oppression, Murther, Rapine, Pride and Ambition, all concomitants of war, and presages of ruine to insue. Which Ambition and Pride had, as it seemeth, a very early influ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence upon the Leaders of the succeeding Age, otherwise they could not possibly have imagined that they should make themselves a name, by the building of such a work at <hi>Babel,</hi> as they en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terprised to erect; nor so soon have known
<pb n="5" facs="tcp:41214:9"/>
what war meant, as that, ere they were well warme in their new seats, to invade one ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther. For, the issues of <hi>Assur,</hi> and the issues of <hi>Cham,</hi> saith Sir <hi>W. Raleigh,</hi> fell instantly at con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tention <note place="margin">Sir <hi>Walt. Ra.</hi> Hast. par. 1. pa. 144.</note> for the Empire of the East.</p>
            <p>As for fruits of Peace, they had Theology, Prophesie, Astronomy, Astrology; had Weights and Measures; and <hi>Cain,</hi> as <hi>Iosephus</hi> relates, first assigned proprieties in possession of Land, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore as common as the Ayre and Light: there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore <hi>Meum</hi> and <hi>Tuum</hi> was even in those times.</p>
            <p>Concerning their manner of diet: many are of opinion, that they eat no flesh, but fed on ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>getable aliments, those at the least of the race of <hi>Seth,</hi> who obeyed the command of God. And this may be collected from the very Text, <hi>Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hold, I have given you every hearb bearing seed, which is upon the face of all the earth; and every tree in thee which is the fruit of a tree yielding seed to you, it shall be for meat; Gen.</hi> 1. <hi>v.</hi> 29. which plainly sheweth, they were utterly prohibited the eating of flesh. Neither doe we read, that this prohibition was taken off, till immediately after the descent of <hi>Noah</hi> from the Ark, when either, because the Deluge had impaired or in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firmed the nature of vegetables, God giving him an augmentation of his words, said, <hi>Every moving thing that liveth soall be meat for you; even as the green hearb have I given you all things, Gen. 9. v. 3.</hi> And though it may be supposed, the first men would not keep sheep, except they made food of them; very learned expositors will tell us<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> that it was partly for their skins, with which <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 word">

<pb n="6" facs="tcp:41214:10"/>
with which they sustained them, and partly for offerings which they sacrificed unto God. As Dr. <hi>Brown</hi> in his <hi>Pseudodoxia Epidemica</hi> hath de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>livered. <note place="margin">

            <p>They enjoyed the use of Letters: for <hi>Iosephus</hi> attesteth, that <hi>Adam</hi> having prophesied two u<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niversal Destructions, one by fire, another by water, his posterity erected two pillars, one of brick, another of stone, in both which they writ their inventions of Astronomy. But, notwith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>standing he thus witnesseth, yet whether those of <hi>Adams</hi> posterity that erected the same pillars invented the Letters they engraved on them, he saith not: whereby we may conjecture, that, admitting the engravements were made be <hi>Seth</hi> or <hi>Enoch;</hi> the Characters nevertheless were more ancient, and by some other found out; of which haply we shall have somewhat more to say. However, of these Epigraphs the Scripture seemeth not to be altogether silent; for we read, <hi>Iudg, 3. v. 26. And Ehud escaped while they tar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ried, and passed beyond the Quarries, and escaped unto Seinath.</hi> Now <hi>Isa: Vossius</hi> tells us, that this Translation receding from the true significa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion <note place="margin">Is.

In regard therefore that Sci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ences were then in such manner multiplied, though <hi>Moses</hi> recordeth them not; divers are of opinion, notwithstanding we read not in <hi>Genesis</hi> of any kind of shipping before the build<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of the Ark, that the knowledge of Naviga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion was not wanting to them, it being so sin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gular an Art; so necessary for the life of man, and by the natural and daily use of swimming, so easily to be found out. Which Conjecture hath some ground of likelihood, considering that <hi>Adam</hi> according to the very probable, though commonly received Opinion, was, by
<pb n="8" facs="tcp:41214:11"/>
his Creation learned in all manner of Arts. As also, that although in their removes for peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pling of the world, they might either by swim<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ming, or by bridges, or on rafts, pass convenient<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly over rivers; yet nevertheless over Seas out of one part of the world into another, or from Continents into Islands they could not possibly transport themselves without shipping, and some skill in Navigation. And if any should object, that, had they had shipping, others might have been saved in them, besides <hi>Noah</hi> and his family: it may be answered, that the Ark of <hi>Noah</hi> was covered; for the Text saith, <hi>And Noah removed the covering of the Ark, &amp;c. Gen. 8. v.</hi> 13. that is (as we are to conceive) part there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of, and so much as served to look forth, from whence he might see round about, which by the window he could not doe, it opening one way only. Whereas the other shipping being open vessels, could not live during such conti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nually violent rains, and downfalls of water, which like <hi>Hyracanes,</hi> or <hi>Spouts, Cataractae Caell</hi> came tumbling from the clouds; but must in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>evitably perish. Besides, <hi>They were eating and drinking, marrying and giving in marriage, untill the day that Noah entred into the Ark. Mat. 24. v.</hi> 38. And therefore took no care, and could have no time to make any stores ready, or be victualled for so long a season as the flood la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sted, or till provisions were sprung up and to be had again. Add especially hereunto, that God had passed his decree, that all Mankind, and all living Creatures, upon the face of the earth, <hi>Noah</hi> and his family, and
<pb n="9" facs="tcp:41214:11"/>
those with him in the Ark excepted, should be destroyed.</p>
            <p>That the world was throughly peopled be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore the flood, that great and universal De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>luge, which God, for the sins of men, was pleased to bring upon the whole world, doth cleerly manifest. For why, saith <hi>Heylin,</hi> 
               <note place="margin">Heyl. Cosm p. 6.</note> should all the earth be buried in that sea of waters, if all the Earth had not been peopled, and all the people of it guilty of oppression in the sight of God? And certainly, saith Sir. <hi>W.</hi> 
               <note place="margin">
                  <hi>Sir</hi> W. Ra. hist. par. 1. p. 136.</note> 
               <hi>Raleigh,</hi> seeing all the world was over-flowne, there were people in all the whole world which offended. But, that the whole world was peopled by <hi>Adam</hi> and his off-spring before the flood, that Scripture which commandeth <hi>Adam to be fruitful and multiply, and to replenish the Earth, Gen. 1. v.</hi> 28. doth, I conceive, asplainly and evidently manifest, as that by vertue of the like blessing conferred in the self same words on <hi>Noah, Gen 9. v.</hi> 1. it was to be peopled by <hi>Noah</hi> and his issue after the flood. For if so many Millions of men, as we shall shortly hear, <hi>Ninus, Zoroaster, Semiramis,</hi> and <hi>Staurobates,</hi> led after them to the field (and they left not all their Kingdomes empty) were born within three hundred years after the Deluge: What numbers might they consist of, that one thou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sand six hundred fifty six years brought forth, preceding the same? If, in like manner, all <hi>Asia</hi> the greater, and the less, with <hi>Greece,</hi> and the Islands thereof, all <hi>Aegypt,</hi> with <hi>Mauritania</hi> and <hi>Lybia,</hi> were within the aforesaid time after the flood fully peopled: And if we believe <hi>Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rosus,</hi>
               <pb n="10" facs="tcp:41214:12"/>
then not only those parts of the world, but (within one hundred and forty years after the flood) <hi>Spain, Italy</hi> and <hi>France</hi> were also planted; much more then may we think, that in one thousand six hundred fifty six yeares be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore the flood, the world was throughly re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plenished with people.</p>
            <p>From the first promise made to <hi>Abraham,</hi> unto the departure of <hi>Israel</hi> out of <hi>Aegypt,</hi> be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing four hundred and thirty years, after the Apostles account, <hi>Galat. 3. v.</hi> 17. were born of <hi>Abrahams</hi> own body, comprehending men, wo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men, and children, saith <hi>Willet,</hi> fifteen hun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dred thousand. And reason will grant, that, ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving the same blessing promised, as great in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crease <note place="margin">A. Will. in Exod. 12.</note> should be given to the sons of <hi>Adam,</hi> as the sons of <hi>Noah.</hi> Considering withall that the sacred story doth not particularly recite all the progeny of all the men in those days, but that only which seemed cheifly necessary for under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>standing the succession of things and times. And it is absurd to think, that men during such long lives, and in such perfect health should not beget very many children, and have frequently two and three at a birth. When in this our Age we have known a woman, the wife of one <hi>Edward Iones</hi> by name, a Wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terman yet living in <hi>Westminster,</hi> to have brought him forth eight children within the compasse of two years, at the first birth two, at the se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cond as many, and at the last four. And when within this last Century from <hi>Robert Honywood</hi> of <hi>Charing</hi> in the County of <hi>Kent</hi> Esquire, and <hi>Mary</hi> his wife, she, that is so famous for bal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lancing
<pb n="11" facs="tcp:41214:12"/>
her salvation with the breaking of a glass, lawfully proceeded three hundred sixty seven persons within less than the space of eighty years. Taking notice also, that, long be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore the flood, <hi>Polygamy</hi> being universally con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tracted to strength of body and length of days, no degrees of kindred or consanguinity were observed. And when death forbearing the fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, made no place for the son, till he had be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>held living nations of his own body. Therefore we have cause to doubt, that the people wan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted world, rather than the world people; or, as Sir <hi>W. Raleigh,</hi> the world could not contain them, rather than that they were not spread throughout the world. Insomuch that if God had not abridged the life of man after the Flood, and decreed his age to be ordinarily no more than seventy years, whereby women are become incapable to beare children above thir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty years at most, and made them all subject likewise to infinity of diseases, there must either have ensued some other universal destruction to have exstirpated them all again, or else they could not have had so much as room to have breathed in; their numbers would have been so infinite, many ages since.</p>
            <p>For, supposing the women before the flood to have been generally fruitful, as no doubt they were, and that they continued child-bear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing long, of which in regard of the length of their lives, as little question is to be made, setting aside how many children soever they might have at a birth, though in <hi>Aegypt</hi> even since the flood, it hath been usual with them
<pb n="12" facs="tcp:41214:13"/>
to bring forth two, three, five, and, as <hi>Trogus Pompeius</hi> saith, sometimes Seven at a birth. It seems not impossible, considering the encrease of the <hi>Honywoods,</hi> but that, by ordinary means, in the revolution of one thousand six hundred fifty six years, such numbers might be multipli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, as would not only plant the whole world, but also many more worlds besides, if any such were. For, finding that from two persons in almost eighty years were produced three hun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dred sixty seven; if we admit from <hi>Adam</hi> and <hi>Eve</hi> in the interval of the two first Centuries after the Creation to have proceeded but four hundred, and allow one fourth part only of this number to be apt for generation; that is, one hundred, or fifty married couples: then if each of these couples have but every two years one, they wil bring forth in 50 years more than twelve hundred and fifty sou<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">
                  <desc>•…</desc>
               </gap>s. And by thus proportioning one fourth part of the num<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber begotten, to every fifty years of time, which<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> in regard of their long lives, and presumed strong constitutions, could not be any impedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment to procreation; it is most cleare, most certain, that in the space of sixteen hundred years the last generation will amount unto two thousand, nine hundred, thirty three millions of millions; three hundred eighty four thousand, seven hundred sixty six millions; ninety six thousaud and four hundred persons; the odd fifty six years, how advantagious soever in the last place, being wholly laid aside. For, if the product of those be added, it will encrease their numbers unto above ten millions of mil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lions.
<pb n="13" facs="tcp:41214:13"/>
So that either that first age was as much or more subject to Plagues, Pestilences, Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mines, Wars, Losses, and Calamities, as after<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times; or else, either the world could not con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain such prodigious multitudes; or they must devoure one another for want of food and habi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tations. For, granting the Terrestrial Globe to be all habitable Earth, no Seas intervening and dividing it into twelve equall parts; it will be found, allotting to each division two hundred and fifty millions of people, that three thousand millions will fully plant the same, and make it more wonderfully populous than this extream part of <hi>Asia,</hi> whereof we are to treat. But being, scarcely the one half of it only is habitable, and Sea possesseth the rest; fifteen hundred millions will more than enough suffice. Whereby it is demonstrable, that, if for setling of Plantations multitudes of people be requirable, the whole Earth was throughly planted before the Flood. But how innumerable soever their numbers appear to be, by the just judgement of God upon them for their manifold offences, they were, by the first of the universall destructions, <hi>Water,</hi> all de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stroyed.</p>
            <p>The Scripture is very manifest and plain herein, <hi>And behold, I, even I</hi> (saith the Lord) <hi>doe bring a flood of waters upon the earth, to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stroy all flesh, wherein is the breath of life, from under Heaven, and every thing that is in the Earth shall die,</hi> Gen. 6. v. 17.

            <p>The first thing mentioned in Scripture, that <hi>Noah</hi> did after his coming forth of the Ark, having sacrificed and returned thanks to God for his deliverance, was, to Till the Ground and Plant. <hi>And Noah began to be an Husbandman, and be planted a Vineyard, Gen. 9. v.</hi> 20. And ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nifest it is, that he travailed not far to seek out the Vine, for the Plantation thereof is remem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bred, before he entred into any counsel, how to dispose of the World amongst his children. In regard whereof many are of opinion, that <hi>Noah</hi> seated himself in the East, in or near to the place, where he first went forth of the Ark, and that he never came to <hi>Shinaar</hi> at all.

taking up his rest, not far from the place where the Ark grounded, first inhabited <hi>India,</hi> and had well peopled all those parts, which lay neerest to him, before he sent <hi>Nimrod,</hi> and his followers forth upon new discoveries. Hence the same Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thor telleth us also, that from the East came <note place="margin">Id. p. 109.</note> the first knowledge of all things, and that the East parts of the world were the first civilized, having <hi>Noah</hi> himself for an Instructer, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by the farther East to this day, the more Civil, the farther West the more Savage.</p>
            <p>In confirmation hereof <hi>Heylin</hi> likewise de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clares, <note place="margin">Heyl. Cosm. p. 16. 17.</note> that Sir <hi>W.

Nor is it to be thought,
<pb n="22" facs="tcp:41214:18"/>
that all the people which were born since the flood till then, could meet together at one place as by inspiration; or being met could joyne together in a work of so little profit; or that if <hi>Noah</hi> or <hi>Sem</hi> had been there amongst them, they would not have diswaded them from that foolish enterprise. And therefore I should rather be of their opinion which think, that <hi>Noah</hi> fixed himself in those parts, which lay neerest to the place where the Ark took land, and having planted as far Eastward as he thought convenient, sent out the surplusage of his people; under the conduct of one or more of these Un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dertakers, directing them perhaps to the land of <hi>Shinaar,</hi> where himself had dwelt before the flood. For, in regard there is none of those, though most diligent men, who have written of the Plantations of the world upon this dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>persion, that either speak of any Nations plan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted by <hi>Noah</hi> himself, or <hi>Sem</hi> and <hi>Iaphet,</hi> or of their setling in the Colonies of any one of their Descendents; it is to me saith <hi>Heylin</hi> again, a very strong argument, that they came not with the rest to the Plains of <hi>Shinaar,</hi> but tarried still in those habitations, wherein God had planted them.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Purchus</hi> thinks, that before the flood <hi>Noah</hi> li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved in <hi>Syria</hi> (which probably his Author might <note place="margin">Purch.

When then <hi>Sibylla,</hi> as Sir <hi>W. Raleigh</hi> observes, making a limitation, saith, <hi>some of them</hi> [only some] built the Tower; and <hi>Moses</hi> witnesseth, that those that built it, came from the East into the West, it is plainly manifest, that all came not together with <hi>Nim<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rod</hi> unto <hi>Shinaar,</hi> but others remained behind in the Eastern parts. <hi>All</hi> therefore were not pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sent at the building of the Tower, seeing that they went not <hi>All</hi> together; neither is it said in Scripture that they did, which as it doth posi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tively say, They were <hi>All</hi> of one speech; so it doth not definitively say, They <hi>All</hi> went.</p>
            <p>Moreover, the exceeding multitude of Peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple, wherein the East parts of the world first abounded; and wherein none of those by whom the Earth was planted after the <hi>Confusion of Tongues,</hi> are yet reported to have setled any Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lonies, doth likewise very much convince, that the East Countries were peopled before the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>move to <hi>Babel.</hi> For, that they were not left desolate upon this remove, but sufficiently pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vided both of Men and Citties, appeareth by those vast Armies of <hi>Zoroaster</hi> and <hi>Staurobates;</hi> 
               <note place="margin">Heyl.

<pb n="25" facs="tcp:41214:19"/>
as any Country since the general Deluge. For, it could not have possibly been, that <hi>Zoroaster</hi> should have raised so mighty an Army in the time of <hi>Ninus,</hi> who was in suceession but the third Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>narch from <hi>Nimrod,</hi> had <hi>Bactria</hi> been planted, but by a Colony sent out from <hi>Shinaar.</hi> The o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther <hi>Staurobates</hi> being King of <hi>India</hi> beyond <hi>Indus,</hi> was invaded by <hi>Semiramis</hi> with an army consisting of three Millions of footmen, one million of horsemen, beside other mighty Forces both for Land and Sea service; whereof, saith Sir <hi>W.

            <p>Now though considering the great Troops that <hi>Nimrod</hi> might bring with him to <hi>Babel,</hi> as by the building of the City and Tower may appear, the numbers which <hi>Semiramis</hi> levied might easily grow up, she being the Wife of <hi>Ni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nus,</hi> the Son of <hi>Belus,</hi> who was the Son of <hi>Nim<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rod;</hi> it was impossible nevertheless, that the army of <hi>Staurobates</hi> should exceed hers, had his numbers of <hi>Indians</hi> been encreased, but by Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lonies sent into those parts, so late as the disper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sion at <hi>Babel</hi> and <hi>Confusion</hi> of <hi>Tongues,</hi> unlesse God had raised his Army out of Stones, or by some such miracle. For, not any multiplication natural (to use Sir <hi>W. Raleigh's</hi> own words)

could in such time produce so many bodies of Men, as were in the <hi>Indian</hi> Army victorious o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver <hi>Semiramis.</hi> When then <hi>India</hi> beyond <hi>Indus</hi> was in the time of <hi>Staurobates</hi> so fully peopled by those that remaining with <hi>Noah</hi> never came down to <hi>Shinaar;</hi> we need not doubt, but that they had then passed farther also; and as their numbers encreased, or desire of new seats invi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted them, made removes, and sent out Colonies to the more remote parts of <hi>Asia,</hi> till at length they setled in the remotest CHINA.

In the mean time, I might add for a farther evidence, that those that have written the actions of <hi>Alexander</hi> of <hi>Macedon,</hi> assure us, that he found more Cities and Sumptuosities in that little King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom of <hi>Porus,</hi> which lay side by side with the River <hi>Indus,</hi> than in all his other Travailes and Undertakings.</p>

            <p>But here I meet with an objection, that <hi>Atha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nasius Kircherus</hi> in his <hi>China illustrata</hi> asserts, <hi>China</hi> was peopled by the posterity of <hi>Cham,</hi> af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter he came out of <hi>Aegypt,</hi> and therefore could not be planted by any of the Sons of <hi>Sem,</hi> or before the <hi>Confusion at Babel.</hi> In answer where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>unto, I must take leave to give you <hi>Kircherus</hi> his own words; by which you will find so slen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der authority for his Assertion, that you will ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mire rather, how it was possible so learned a man could ever fancy such a conceit. For, his princi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pal, yea verily in manner his only argument is, that because the <hi>Aegyptians,</hi> who were descen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded from <hi>Cham,</hi> used Hieroglyphicks; therefore the <hi>Chinoes</hi> did descend from <hi>Cham,</hi> because they used Hieroglyphicks also. Whereby you may observe, that if the <hi>Mexicans</hi> want their Ance<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stors, they may repair to <hi>Kircherus,</hi> and he will presently inform them, that they came from some of the posterity of <hi>Cham</hi> because they in like manner as had the Aegyptians, have Hiero<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>glyphicks in use. But why to confirm his opi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion, did he not tell us, that the <hi>Hebrews</hi> were of the seed of <hi>Cham,</hi> because they likewise as well as the Aegyptians were circumcised? However heare him, <hi>Certe ut ad credendum inducar, magni momenti argumentum, sunt veteres is<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">

Certainly, saith he, that I am induced to believe this, those ancient Characters of the <hi>Chinoes</hi> in all things imitating Hieroglyphicks, are an argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of great validity.</p>
            <p>But Sir <hi>W. Raleigh</hi> will positively assure you, <note place="margin">Sir W. Ral. hist. par. 1. pag. 98. A. Sem.

            </p>
            <p>Now, though this is far more than sufficient to answer the objection, let us see nevertheless, how he conducts his Colony. He tells us then, <hi>loco citato,</hi> 
               <q>That <hi>Cham</hi> first out of <hi>Aegypt</hi> through <hi>Persia,</hi> and thence into <hi>Bactria</hi> conducted his Colonies, whom we conclude, saith he, to be the same with <hi>Zoroaster</hi> King of the <hi>Bactrians;</hi> but <hi>Bactria</hi> the farthest Region of <hi>Persia,</hi> is bounded by the Kingdom of the <hi>Mogor,</hi> or <hi>In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dostan,</hi> and thereby so opportunely scited, that
<pb n="30" facs="tcp:41214:22"/>
they might easily from thence transferre their Colonies into <hi>China,</hi> the utmost Nation of the habitable world, together also with the first elements of Letters, which from their Father <hi>Cham,</hi> and <hi>Mercurius Tresmegistus</hi> Counsellor of his Son <hi>Misraim,</hi> and first inventor of Hiero<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>glyphicks they had though rudely learned.</q> Now <hi>Cham</hi> cannot be said to goe out of <hi>Aegypt</hi> into <hi>Bactria,</hi> for after his arrival in <hi>Aegypt,</hi> he never departed thence, but lived and died there in the three hundred fifty second yeare after the Deluge, as Sir <hi>W. Raleigh</hi> relates. <hi>Heylin</hi> hath told us lately, that <hi>Bactria</hi> was as soon peopled <note place="margin">
                  <hi>Sir</hi> W. Ral. hist. par. 1. p. 197, 198.</note> as any Country since the Universal Flood, o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>therwise it could not possibly have opposed <hi>Ninus</hi> with such numbers as it did, if the same had been planted but by a Colony, sent out from <hi>Shinaar;</hi> much less may we say, if it were but first peopled from <hi>Aegypt,</hi> so long time after. For, Sir <hi>W. Raleigh</hi> finds <hi>Cham</hi> to have but be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gun his Kingdom there one hundred ninety one years succeeding the inundation of the world. And as for <hi>Mercurius Tres-Megistus,</hi> whom the <hi>Greeks</hi> called <hi>Hermes,</hi> there were many of this name, and how to distinguish them is difficult. Two of them were famous in <hi>Aegypt,</hi> and there worshipped as Gods. The One (probably here meant) was the son of <hi>Hylus,</hi> whose name saith <hi>Boccase,</hi> the <hi>Aegyptians</hi> feared to utter, as the <note place="margin">Bocc. lib. 7. pag, 126, 127.</note> 
               <hi>Iews</hi> did their <hi>Tetragrammaton;</hi> the other was the son of this <hi>Tres-Megistus,</hi> and for his wisdom by his father called <hi>Cath;</hi> but which of these two it was that taught the <hi>Aegyptians</hi> the use of Letters, Writers much differ; and no less also
<pb n="31" facs="tcp:41214:22"/>
about the Age in which they lived. For <hi>Isaack<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son</hi> and others, place them about the time that <hi>Abraham</hi> was called out of <hi>Haran</hi> or <hi>Charran</hi> in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to the land of <hi>Canaan;</hi> others suppose the first and most ancient to have been <hi>Ioseph</hi> the son of <hi>Iacob;</hi> others again, that he was <hi>Moses</hi> himself; and Sir <hi>W.

            <p>Neither could <hi>Cham</hi> be <hi>Zoroaster,</hi> it is a fancy, <note place="margin">
                  <hi>Sir</hi> W. Ral. hist. par. 1. p. 169.</note> saith Sir <hi>W. Raleigh,</hi> of little probability. For <hi>Cham</hi> was the paternal Ancestor of <hi>Ninus,</hi> the father of <hi>Chus,</hi> the grandfather of <hi>Nimrod,</hi> whose son was <hi>Belus,</hi> the father of <hi>Ninus,</hi> which <hi>Ninus</hi> slew <hi>Zoroaster</hi> in <hi>Bactria,</hi> as Historiographers una<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nimously accord. Wherefore, and for that <hi>Cham</hi> never removed out of <hi>Aegypt</hi> after his settlement there, into <hi>Bactria; Cham</hi> could not be <hi>Zoroaster</hi> King of the <hi>Bactrians,</hi> nor from thence ever trans<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferr Colonies into <hi>China,</hi> as <hi>Kircherus</hi> would per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>swade. But in all probability, <hi>China</hi> was after the Flood first planted either by <hi>Noah</hi> himself, or
<pb n="32" facs="tcp:41214:23"/>
some of the sons of <hi>Sem,</hi> before the remove to <hi>Shinaar.</hi> For, such Principles of Theology, as amongst the <hi>Chinois,</hi> we shall shortly hear of, could not proceed from the wicked and idola<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trous race of accursed <hi>Cham,</hi> but from those only that were, <hi>de civitate Dei,</hi> of the City of God.</p>
            <p>The most remote parts then of the Eastern World, being planted before the dispersion at <hi>Babel;</hi> and until the <hi>Confusion</hi> of <hi>Tongues,</hi> the whole Earth being of <hi>one language and one lipp,</hi> it must indisputably succeed, that <hi>Noah</hi> and who<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>soever remained with him, which came not with the rest to the valley of <hi>Shinaar,</hi> and consequently by their absence thence, had no hand in that vain attempt, could not be concerned in the <hi>Confusion</hi> there, nor come within the curse of <hi>confounded Languages;</hi> but retained the PRIMITIVE Tongue, as having received it from <hi>Noah,</hi> and likewise carry the same with them to their seve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral Plantations, in what part of the East soever they setled themselves, aswel as <hi>Nimrod</hi> and his Troops brought it with them to <hi>Shinaar.</hi> And hence it is, that <hi>Goropius</hi> saith, Because the <hi>Cimme<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rians</hi> were not at the <hi>Confusion</hi> of <hi>Babel,</hi> there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore <note place="margin">G. Beca. Indos. pag. 534.</note> there is no question to be made, but that their Language was the PRIMITIVE.</p>
            <p>Hence the same Author, Because those that were left behind to plant <hi>Margiana,</hi> were not at <note place="margin">Id. pag. 533</note> the building of the Tower, it must be necessarily acknowledged, in regard the Language was not confined to any, but general to all, aswel unto those at <hi>Shinaar,</hi> as all people elsewhere, that the ANCIENT Language, which before the Confusion was common to the universal World,
<pb n="33" facs="tcp:41214:23"/>
remained with those of <hi>Margiana.</hi> Hence Sir <hi>W.</hi> 
               <note place="margin">Sir W. Ral. Histor. par. 1. pag. 158.</note> 
               <hi>Raleigh,</hi> it is conjectured, that those of the race of <hi>Sem</hi> which came into <hi>Chaldaea,</hi> were of <hi>Nim<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rod</hi>'s Troop, and removed with him thither: yet, in regard they were no partners in the unbelie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving work of the Tower, therefore they did re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain the first and most antient Language, which the first Age had left to <hi>Noah,</hi> and <hi>Noah</hi> to <hi>Sem</hi> and his Issues Hence <hi>Heylin</hi> also, That some Plan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tations <note place="margin">Heyl. Cosm. p. 7.</note> had no reference to the <hi>Confusion</hi> of <hi>Tongues,</hi> being made before it, on the sending out of such Colonies, as were nearest to the place, where the Ark did rest. But how general soever the consent is, what needeth prophane testimo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny; when sacred History plainly teacheth us, That the Language of <hi>These</hi> only that were at <hi>Babel</hi> was confounded, and not of <hi>Those</hi> that were ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sent thence, and not guilty of that mis-believing work. The words of the holy Penman, <hi>Gen. 11. v.</hi> 5, 6, 7, 8. are. <hi>And the Lord came down to see the City, and the Tower, which the Children of men build<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed.

Go to, let us go down, and THERE confound THEIR Language, that THEY may not understand one anothers Speech. So the Lord scattered THEM abroad from THENCE upon the face of all the Earth, and they left off to build the City.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Which can admit no other construction, than that the Language of <hi>Th<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">

                  </gap>se,</hi> that were THERE, that is, at that place in <hi>Babylonia,</hi> not in <hi>India</hi> or elsewhere was confounded. So in like manner
<pb n="34" facs="tcp:41214:24"/>
THEIR Language, <hi>i. e. Their</hi> Language that were with <hi>Nimrod,</hi> and of this Western Colony; not the Language of <hi>Noah,</hi> and his Plantations in the East. Again also, That THEY, to wit, those <hi>children of men,</hi> that built the Tower; not those generations that had no hand in building of the same, might <hi>not understand one anothers speech.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Furthermore, the Lord scattered THEM abroad from THENCE, <q>Which, saith Sir <note place="margin">
                     <hi>Sir</hi> W. Ral. par. 1. pag. 104.</note> 
                  <hi>W.

The East being inhabited before.</q>  
            </p>
            <p>But let us consider the Context. The Scene was the valley of <hi>Shinaar; They found a plain in the land of Shinaar, and they dwelt there.</hi> v. 2. The Offenders were <hi>Nimrod</hi> and his Troops; <hi>And they said, Go to, let us build us a City and a Tower, whose top may reach unto Heaven, and let us make us a name, lest we be scattered abroad upon the face of the whole Earth.</hi> ver. 4. The fear of a Judgment brought a Judgment upon them. And as the Of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fenders were those only at <hi>Shinaar,</hi> so the Lan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guage of those only at <hi>Shinaar</hi> was confounded. <hi>Go to, let us go down</hi> (saith the Lord) <hi>and there confound their Language, that they may not under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stand one anothers speech.</hi> v. 7 The punishment be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing justly inflicted, where only the offence lay, and upon those solely that had offended. No man shall answer for anothers fault: it is both the Law and Gospel. <hi>The soul that sinneth, it shall die,</hi>

Ezech. 18. v. 20. <hi>For we must all appear before the judgment seat of Christ, that every one may receive the things done in his body, according to that he hath done, whether it he good or bad;</hi> 2 Corinth. cap. 5. v. 10. And I must not omit that the marginal notes of our <hi>Bible,</hi> for the more clear exposition of the Text we are upon, refer us to the <hi>Wise<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome</hi> of <hi>Solomon,</hi> cap. 10. v. 5. where it is writ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten; <hi>Moreover, the Nations in their wicked conspi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>racy being confounded, Shee</hi> [Wisedome] <hi>found out the righteous, and preserved him blameless unto God, and kept him strong against the tender compassion of his son.</hi> Whereby, though it may be conceived, that in the particular, this alludes unto <hi>Abraham</hi> his sacrificing of <hi>Isaac;</hi> yet in the general, it is most evident, most certain thereby, that <hi>Those</hi> only that had offended in the conspiracy of the building of the Tower, had their Language con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>founded, and were convicted by that Judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment.</p>
            <p>Thus from Scripture and approved History hath been made appear, That the Ark rested in the East; That <hi>Noah</hi> planted not far from the place, where it took ground; and from thence by himself, and his off-spring, that abode with him, peopled the Eastern parts of the World, together with <hi>China;</hi> and that these Plantations were un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dertaken and setled before the remove to <hi>Shinaar,</hi> and <hi>Confusion</hi> of Tongues, by those that never came at <hi>Babel;</hi> and could not therefore be inga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gaged in that presumptuous work. But who they were of his off-spring that <hi>Noah</hi> kept with him, whether of the sons of <hi>Ioctan,</hi> or of all the rest a certain number <hi>(Cham</hi> and his issue only excep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted)
<pb n="36" facs="tcp:41214:25"/>
cannot, saith Sir <hi>W. Raleigh,</hi> be known. Never<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>theless <note place="margin">
                  <hi>Sir</hi> W. Ral. Hist. par. 1. pag. 101.</note> we are not to doubt, but that their num<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bers were so great, as not only sufficed to hus<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>band those Plantations that <hi>Noah</hi> had setled, but also to send forth Colonies elsewhere, as occasion required.</p>
            <p>The Scripture also plainly declareth, That the curse of <hi>Confounded Languages</hi> fell upon those only that were present upon the place at <hi>Babel,</hi> and personally acted in that ungodly design there. And therefore we may warrantably conclude, That either the PRIMITIVE Language is to be found amongst those Plantations that were made before the <hi>Babylonian</hi> Enterprise, by those that were absent thence, and had not offended therein; or else it cannot be appropriated to any Nation now extant in the World, or at this day known. For, as the people at <hi>Babel,</hi> that had solely offended, were therefore from <hi>Shinaar</hi> scattered throughout all the other parts of the un-inhabited Earth; so only the Language which they brought with them thither, was there for their offence confounded; and, as is conceived, divided into several other Languages, passing at this day amongst us by the name of MOTHER-Tongues, which that they were seventy two in number, he that hath a mind to please himself with believing it, shall not displease me.</p>
            <p>Now here, <hi>Heylin</hi> is so courteous, as to befriend <note place="margin">Heyl. Cosm. pag. 17.</note> me with an Objection. That admitting it for granted, that those who staid behind with <hi>Noah,</hi> spake the same Language which was common to the Fathers before the Flood (be it the <hi>Hebrew</hi> or what else soever it was) there seems no reason to
<pb n="37" facs="tcp:41214:25"/>
the contrary, but that it might in time be bran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ched into several Languages or Dialects of the same one Language, by the Commerce and En<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tercourse which they had with Nations of a diffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rent speech. To which, is thus answered, That not only Commerce and Intercourse, but also Time and Conquest may possibly cause the alte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration of a Language, yet in regard that Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quests are of divers kinds, and Intercourse and Commerce of different natures, such alteration cannot be effected by every manner of Commerce and Conquests.</p>
            <p>For, on the one side, where an Invader enters a Country with a resolution wholly to dispossess and expel the Natives, it inevitably follows, that the speech of that Country, must, being subdued, receive such an absolute change, as that no other, than that which the Conqueror brings with him can remain. And thus we find, it succeeded at the conquest of the Land of <hi>Canaan</hi> by the <hi>Israelites;</hi> who generally, expelling the <hi>Canaanites,</hi> introdu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ced their own Language (whatever it were) and extirpated the former. Where also an Invader hath made such a full Conquest, as that he can clear, or (as I may say) drive the Countrey, and carry away the whole body of the Natives into captivity, there, no doubt is to be made, but that the Language of the vanquished must undergo a manifest alteration. And thus we find that in so short a time as the captivity of <hi>Babylon,</hi> those of <hi>Iudah</hi> had in such manner lost their speech, as at their return home, they could not understand the Book of their own Laws, but by an Interpre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter. <hi>Nehem. cap. 8. v.</hi> 7. 8.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="38" facs="tcp:41214:26"/>
But on the other side, where the Invader en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters, to possess new dwellings, and plant himself and people; when he neither carries the Natives elsewhere into captivity, nor utterly expels them, the old Language of that Countrey cannot be extirpated; but may be altered, and by the mix<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture with new commers after long tract of time, become generally a new kind of speech. Thus the invasions of the <hi>Huns, Goths,</hi> and <hi>Longobards,</hi> and their Conquests, brought a new Language into <hi>Italy.</hi> And thus the <hi>Goths</hi> and <hi>Vandals, Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>racens</hi> and <hi>Moors</hi> into <hi>Spain.</hi> So likewise where a forein Enemy, out of an ambitious desire of Fame and Glory, and for eternizing his name in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vades a Countrey, and having obtained a victory, upon a certain tribute condescended unto by the Natives, for acknowledgment of subjection, ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quitteth it again, there it is impossible, the speech of that Countrey should be changed. For, it can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not be imagined, that the Kingdom of <hi>Porus,</hi> in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to which <hi>Alexander</hi> the <hi>Great</hi> no sooner leaped, than leaped out of it again, could by such a con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quest, have the Language thereof, either altered or corrupted. In like manner, the conquests of the <hi>French</hi> in <hi>Italy,</hi> no more altered the <hi>Italian</hi> Tongue, than our Invasions of <hi>Scotland,</hi> did the <hi>Pictish,</hi> or <hi>Scottish</hi> speech.</p>
            <p>There is moreover another kind of Conquest, where the Victor takes up the Manners and Cu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stomes of the vanquished, and transporteth into his own Country the Language, Arts, and Sciences of those that he hath overcome. For the <hi>Romans</hi> together with their victory over <hi>Greece,</hi> brought home with them, Sculpture, Painting, and the
<pb n="39" facs="tcp:41214:26"/>
Language of that People also; which <hi>Plutarch</hi> in the life of <hi>M. Cato</hi> telleth us, most of the <hi>Romans</hi> studied. Yet we find not, that the <hi>Latine</hi> Tongue was corrupted, but rather refined thereby; and if it were refined, then it was altered, for every refining is changing. But, this some will perhaps say, is directly contrary to what is objected: for, here in this case, not the Language of the van<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quished by the Conqueror, but the Language of the Conqueror by the vanquished comes to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive an alteration. After the same manner, by their conquests in <hi>Asia,</hi> the <hi>Romans</hi> learned luxu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry and riot, to wear silk, and live effeminately; the <hi>Asiatiques</hi> in the mean time composing them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves to the antient temperance, frugality and discipline of their Lords and Masters the <hi>Romans.</hi> Thus also we find, that the <hi>Macedonians</hi> long be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore, when they had conquered <hi>Persia,</hi> became not only in Language and Attire, but also in Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>scipline and Customes <hi>Persians</hi> rather, than the <hi>Persians, Macedonians.</hi> And this oftentimes hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peneth, as all History informs, where the Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>queror is either barbarous, or not in such a de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gree civilized, as those that are subdued by him. Or else efflated by success, wholly gives himself over to licentiousness, disdaining the manners of his native Countrey.</p>
            <p>As for <hi>Time,</hi> it may, having especially Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>merce its attendant, prevail somewhat herein. For, we our selves can scarcely now understand the Language that was used in the days of <hi>Chau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cer.</hi> And yet nevertheless we know, that the <hi>La<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tine</hi> Tongue, hath from <hi>Caesars</hi> time, maugre all conquests and intercourse whatsoever, received
<pb n="40" facs="tcp:41214:27"/>
not the least alteration, but remaineth both in the Characters and reading the same, as then. and is as generally, if not better understood, in these days, than it was fifteen hundred years since.</p>
            <p>Lastly, concerning <hi>Intercourse</hi> and <hi>Commerce,</hi> it is true, that in such a Nation, where a general Commerce is permitted, and free access granted to all Strangers to trade and inhabit, aswel in the Inland parts of the Countrey; as upon the Frontires or Sea-coasts, there a change of Lan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guage may by degrees happen. And we need not go far for Example. For, with us our selves, by this means chiefly, the <hi>Saxon</hi> Tongue, since the time of the <hi>Normans</hi> is utterly lost. Insomuch that what by <hi>Latinizing, Italianizing, Frenchi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zing,</hi> and [as we must have it called forsooth,] <hi>Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>finizing,</hi> or rather <hi>Non-sencizing,</hi> our old Lan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guage is so corrupted and changed, that we are so far from <hi>Saxonizing,</hi> as we have scarcely one significant word of our MOTHER speech left.</p>
            <p>But on the contrary, where <hi>Commerce</hi> is made, and <hi>intercourse</hi> allowed, upon the Seacoasts and Frontires only, there we find the Language of the Natives in the In-land parts, to remain with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out suffering any alteration. Hence <hi>Caesar</hi> telleth us, that he found some footsteps of the <hi>Gaulish</hi> Language upon the coast of <hi>Britain,</hi> when with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in the land (though he advanced not far) the <hi>British</hi> Tongue was spoken purely. And hence in <hi>Ise-and,</hi> though about four hundred years since conquered by the <hi>Norvegians,</hi> in regard there is little access of strangers, but only as some part of the Maritime shores affordeth; as also because
<pb n="41" facs="tcp:41214:27"/>
they suffer not their unexperienced youth to tra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vail abroad into other Countries, the old <hi>Runique</hi> or <hi>Gothique</hi> Tongue in manner yet continueth, and is by divers of the Inhabitants understood, when in all the Septentrional World besides, it is utterly forgotten and extinct. But what shall we say of the <hi>Basquish</hi> or antient Language of <hi>Spain?</hi> which notwithstanding all the Invasions of the <hi>Carthaginians, Romans, Goths, Vandals, Moors</hi> re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maineth yet pure in <hi>Biscay,</hi> whatever <hi>Commerce</hi> and Intercourse soever that Countrey hath in all times enjoyed. Insomuch that the Inhabitants upon one side of the River running from the mountains of <hi>Ordunia</hi> to <hi>Bilboa,</hi> and which car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries the Iron-mills, speaking the MOTHER Language, understand not one word, unless by an Interpreter, what those on the other side of the same River say. What of the <hi>Irish</hi> Tongue? which Countrey, although we have kept under subjection by lawful conquest, near five hundred years, setled many Plantations therein, and per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitted continually free <hi>Commerce,</hi> yet neverthe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>less the natural Language of the Countrey conti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nueth throughout most parts of that Kingdom pure and untainted at this day. And which is re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>markable, if a child born of <hi>English</hi> Parents there, and as curiously overseen as possibly a child can be from hearing of the Native <hi>Irish</hi> speak, chance to hear but one word of that Language, he will sooner remember the same, and be apter to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peat it again, than he shall any one word of <hi>En<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>glish,</hi> though twenty times spoken before him. What of the old <hi>British</hi> Tongue? since that through all the conquests of the <hi>Romans, Saxons,
<pb n="42" facs="tcp:41214:28"/>
Danes,</hi> and <hi>Normans,</hi> and after unlimited conver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sation with most Nations of the World, it hath passed currant, and is yet remaining in <hi>Wales.</hi> In like manner, the <hi>Arabique</hi> continueth incorrupt in the hilly pares of <hi>Granata:</hi> and the antient <hi>Epirotique</hi> in the high, wooddy, and more moun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tanous parts of <hi>Epirus.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>By all which it appeareth, That not any kind of <hi>Conquest</hi> can wholly alter or extirpate the natu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral Language of a people, except by generally ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pelling the Natives, or transplanting them else<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>where. And that <hi>Commerce</hi> and <hi>Intercourse</hi> where a mixture of several Nations is wholly permitted, may in long tract of <hi>Time</hi> produce an absolute alteration; but where tolerated on the Sea-coasts or confines of a Country only, can neither alter a Language, nor branch it into several Dialects of the same, but may possibly in those places corrupt it, whilst the Inland parts nevertheless enjoy purely their MOTHER Tongue.</p>
            <p>When then it is reputed ridiculous to hear that <hi>Adam</hi> spake <hi>Dutch</hi> in Paradice: And when we consider, that the <hi>Hebrews</hi> have no surer founda<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion to erect their Language upon, than only a bare Tradition of their own, which we all know is so infamous an <hi>Historian;</hi> as Wisemen neither report after it, nor give credit to any thing they receive from it: As also that the <hi>Samaritans</hi> by their often removes were but a mungrel people, and in regard of their continual commerce with Nations of a different speech; and the many storms and tempests of Wars and Conquests, which they were always subject to, have but a mungrel Language; for though it hath, as is not
<pb n="43" facs="tcp:41214:28"/>
to be denied, some proper and peculiar words of its own, nevertheless it oftentimes useth the <hi>Ara<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bique,</hi> and in forming of Nouns and Verbs, some<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times follows the <hi>Hebrew,</hi> sometimes the <hi>Chaldaean,</hi> wherewith it is of great affinity. And though they may have had, as they pretend, the <hi>Pentateuch</hi> of <hi>Moses</hi> written in a strange Character, the <hi>Samaritan,</hi> as they call it, yet their having had it in their custody contributes not an <hi>Iota</hi> to the Anti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quity of their speech, or that it should have ancient<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly been the PRIMITIVE Tongue, in regard those Characters not much differ from the modern <hi>He<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>braique,</hi> unless where either by the negligence of the Scribe, or variety of the Copies, some diver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sity appears; as our famous Doctor <hi>Brian Walton,</hi> late Bishop of <hi>Chester</hi> in his Introduction to the <note place="margin">B. Walt. Intr. ad Ling. Or. p. 18, 19.</note> reading of the Oriental Tongues hath very lear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nedly observed: And when in like manner we consider, that it cannot with any probability of Truth be resolved, that the <hi>Phoenicians,</hi> who are generally supposed to be the wicked off-spring of accursed <hi>Cham,</hi> the principal Actors, and Offen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dors in that daring conspiracy at <hi>Babel,</hi> should enjoy so great a priviledge, as to carry away with them, and be infranchised to that Sacred Lan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guage, which even in the time of innocency was spoken between God and Man: Why may we not reflect upon the CHINOIS? For we shall make appear, that <hi>They</hi> were primitively plant<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed in CHINA, if not by <hi>Noah</hi> himself, by some of the Issue of <hi>Sem,</hi> before the remove of <hi>Nimrod</hi> to <hi>Shinaar,</hi> and the <hi>Confusion</hi> of <hi>Tongues</hi> at <hi>Babel; Their</hi> Language to be the self same at this day, as when they were first planted and began to be a

people; Their Country never subject to any such conquest, as could prejudice, but rather dilate their language; <hi>Their</hi> Laws in all times to have prohibited forein <hi>Commerce</hi> and <hi>Inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>course;</hi> and <hi>Their</hi> dominions ever shut up against strangers, never permitting any to set footing within <hi>Their</hi> Empire, unless by way of Embassy solely; nor suffering <hi>Their</hi> own Natives to tra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vail abroad without especial licence from their Emperour: So jealous have they evermore been, lest <hi>Their</hi> Language and Customes should be cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rupted. Considering which, together with their infinite multitudes of People, and perpetual flou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rishing in Peace, and all Arts and Sciences, whilst every Nation almost throughout the whole Uni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verse besides, have more than once in time been over-run and conquered; it may with much pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bability be asserted, <hi>That the Language of the Em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pire of CHINA, is, the PRIMITIVE Tongue, which was common to the whole World before the Flood;</hi> and that it could never be branched into several Languages, or <hi>Dialects</hi> of the same one Language, by the <hi>Commerce</hi> and <hi>Intercourse</hi> which they had with Nations of a different speech; when they never had <hi>Commerce</hi> or <hi>Intercourse</hi> with any. Nor were ever known to these parts of the World (scarcely to their adjoyning Neighbours) till about an hundred and fifty years since, by the <hi>Portugals</hi> and <hi>Spaniards</hi> they were disco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vered.</p>
            <p>But I find St. <hi>Hierome,</hi> and others that follow him, object, That the <hi>Hebrew</hi> was the PRIMI<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>TIVE Language, in regard that all the proper names of men before the Deluge, and immedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ately
<pb n="45" facs="tcp:41214:29"/>
after the same appear to be naturally <hi>He<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brew.</hi> And that it was necessary the Sacred Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture should be delivered in that Language, which <hi>Adam</hi> and the rest used before the Flood. To which the answer is obvious, that the Names might be first imposed in the PRIMITIVE Language, and that it was an easie matter for the succeeding Ages, understanding by Tradition what they meant, to transferr them into the <hi>He<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brew</hi> Tongue; whereby also the Names of men might equally answer to the Names of places, which otherwise they could not do; for through<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out the whole course of the Books of <hi>Moses</hi> and <hi>Ioshuah</hi> it is manifest, that the names of the Places and Cities of <hi>Canaan,</hi> the antient names, I mean, by which they were called before ever the <hi>Israe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lites</hi> came to dwell in them, were <hi>Hebrew</hi> names. Neither was there any more necessity, that the sacred Oracles of God should be written in the first and most perfect speech, than for CHRIST to be born of the most honorable and richest Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rents, and live in the most splendid and delicious manner. For, that the World might know, man is not to attribute any thing to his own merits or greatness, but that God giveth all his <hi>Grace gra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tis,</hi> he hath ever chosen humble and lowly Mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sters of his <hi>Grace.</hi> Thus of <hi>Abraham</hi> the son of an Idolater, and maker of Idols, he made choice, to be the first founder of Circumcision. And so ordained, that CHRIST himself, when he was to be born should scarcely have a roof to shelter him, when he newly came out of his Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers womb, from the inclemency of the Air. And when CHRIST came to redeem us from
<pb n="46" facs="tcp:41214:30"/>
sin and death, he elected not, those, to preach his Gospel throughout the World, that were of the Schools of the Philosophers, or of <hi>Demosthenes</hi> or <hi>Cicero,</hi> but made choice of rude men, of a rude manner of life, Fishermen, and Boatmen to be the Heralds for proclaiming of his Victory. Neither was it any King or Monarch, but an <hi>Abject,</hi> who was cast forth and exposed to the mercy of cruel waves, and cruelty of merciless Crocodiles, that delivered the <hi>Israelites</hi> from their slavery in <hi>Ae<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gypt.</hi> And if we run throughout all, throughout all we shall find, those to have pleased God most, that are wont to displease men most. There is no reason therefore any should think that so contra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry to the doctrine of God, either the <hi>Typical Law</hi> or the <hi>fulfilling of the Law</hi> should be given in that Language which all others excelled. But, as the <hi>fulfilling of the Law,</hi> which relateth chiefly to the <hi>Gentiles,</hi> was written in the <hi>Greek</hi> Tongue; be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause that Language being, as it were, then ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nerally known, the Nations might by reading it, the sooner be converted, and brought within the sheepfold of CHRIST. So no doubt, the <hi>Typi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cal Law,</hi> wherein the Church of the <hi>Israelites</hi> was solely concerned, was written, not in the PRI<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>MITIVE, but for their better instruction, in the old <hi>Hebrew</hi> Tongue, which <hi>Abraham</hi> brought, not out of <hi>Chaldaea,</hi> but learned in the land of <hi>Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>naan,</hi> whereby it became the Language of his Posterity, and by them was vulgarly spoken, un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>til, as some will have it, their Captivity. And this the Scripture doth in direct terms testifie; when upon the calling of the <hi>Aegyptians</hi> it is said. <hi>In that day shall five Cities in the land of Aegypt
<pb n="47" facs="tcp:41214:30"/>
speak the language of Canaan, and swear to the LORD of Hosts.</hi> Isai. 19. v. 18. By which we are taught, that the <hi>Aegyptians</hi> should not only be brought to offer the same sacrifices and oblations to the LORD, as the <hi>Israelites</hi> did, but speak the same speech with them also, which was the Language of the land of <hi>Canaan.</hi> From whence we will at present depart, to enter upon our travail into CHINA.</p>

               <hi>MARTINUS Martinius</hi> in his famous <hi>Chi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nique</hi>

But of <hi>Asia</hi> it self, saith he, there is no part (at least since the universal Deluge) more Noble, more Antient, or more fertile than this extreme part thereof, whether Politique Government, the use of Letters, or Industry be respected. For, the History of it by the <hi>Chinois</hi> themselves even from all Antiquity written, comprehendeth almost three thousand years before the birth of CHRIST, as more evidently by the Epitomy and Chrono<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>logy collected out of their Annals appears. Ever since which time they are said to have had Let<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters, Moral Philosophy, and Mathematical Scien<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces especially; which both their more than An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tique observations of the Stars, and those Laws of Government written in most antiently anti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ent Volumes; and at these very times extant, more than sufficiently shew and declare. In the Epistle Dedicatory of his <hi>Atlas</hi> he premiseth thus, In these Mapps, I present unto your view

            <p>
               <pb n="49" facs="tcp:41214:31"/>
Now, in regard <hi>Vossius</hi> names them <hi>Serians,</hi> I <note place="margin">M. Mart. Atl Sin. pag. 1.</note> am compelled before proceeding farther to cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tifie, that this outmost Region of the known World, which <hi>Martinius</hi> calls the extrreme part of <hi>Asia,</hi> is by some called <hi>Serica, Sina,</hi> or <hi>Chinois</hi> by others, by the <hi>Tartars Cathay</hi> and <hi>Mangin,</hi> and which every man wondersat, not any of all these names, is at all known unto the <hi>Chinois</hi> themselves,, that of <hi>Mangin</hi> excepted, the <hi>Tartars</hi> having ironically in derision put that upon them, as scoffing at their being over arrogant and proud of their civilities; for <hi>Margin</hi> in the <hi>Tartarian</hi> Tongue signifies barbarous people. But the <hi>Chinois</hi> call their Empire <hi>Chunghoa,</hi> and <hi>Chunghue,</hi> either name, saith <hi>Martinius,</hi> being imposed for the excellency thereof. <hi>This</hi> expres<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sing the middle Kingdome (they supposing themselves to be scited in the middle of the World) <hi>That</hi> signifies the middle Garden or Flower rather. But how much these mysterious reasons of Names may import their Language to be the PRIMITIVE Tongue, I shall leave unto <hi>Martinius, Goropius,</hi> and others, ere our discourse brings us to a period, to acquaint you.</p>
            <p>But seeing <hi>Martinius</hi> referred us to his Epito<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>my <note place="margin">M. Mart. Sin. Hist. lib. 1. p. 12<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>

to the vulgar computation about three thousand years.</p>
            <p>Now, for that we are to make great use of <hi>Martinius</hi> his Authority, I conceive it not imper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinent to let you know, that he professeth, after his having lived many years amongst the <hi>Chinois,</hi> to have with great care and long study epitomiz<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed their History from their Original Annals, and innumerable their other Books, yet extant even at this day amongst them from their first beginning to be a Nation.

So much the less because they have no Nobility either for Antiqui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty of birth or time to flatter. Every the poorest man amongst them, if deserving it by his learn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, being capable of the highest preferment.

<pb n="51" facs="tcp:41214:32"/>
of which nevertheless amongst us so little care is taken, that every Chronologer almost differeth from another.</p>
            <p>Now, though <hi>Martinius</hi> hath this opinion of <note place="margin">Id: p. 12<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
               </note> the sincerity of their Annals since the time of the Flood; yet as to the Age preceding the same, the <hi>Chinois</hi> themselves give little or no credit to what is related in them, during their Govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment by the heads of Families, but from the time they began to be ruled by a Monarch, of which, opportunity serving, we shall take farther notice, and at present advise you only. That whereas by their History it appears <hi>Fortrius</hi> who was their first Monarch began his reign over them, about three thousand years before the birth of CHRIST, after the common Chronology, <hi>Martinius</hi> tells us, that the credit thereof must rest at their own doors, for a matter of such mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment he will not take upon him to decide; in regard it consents not with the judgment of our Chronologers, that assign a much less space of time from the Flood of <hi>Noah.</hi> Yet nevertheless, saith he, the opinion of the <hi>Chinois</hi> seems not on <note place="margin">M.

till <hi>Iaus,</hi> the better to dispense with their Chro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nology before the Flood, of which he seems to have no great opinion: the most favorable judgment he will allow thereof, being that their Emperor <hi>Iaus</hi> might precede that destruction twelve years. And though he saith, there may be a mis-computation thereby in the History of this Emperour, and his Successors <hi>Xunus,</hi> and <hi>Ynus;</hi> he doth nevertheless assure us, that the matters related of them, are very coherent with their Successions. His words being; <hi>Ad ogni modo, benche via sia errore nel tempo, dall' historia di questo Imperatore e seguenti, è certo che le cose vanno coherenti con le loro successioni.</hi> He tells us also, that these three Emperors are by the <hi>Chinois</hi> reputed Saints, of whom they relate many things, and that certainly there is no doubt to be made, but that they were great Philosophers, and much enclined to moral vertue.</p>
            <p>But in regard <hi>Martinius</hi> in his <hi>Tartarian</hi> War premiseth, that he hath in his <hi>Atlas</hi> of <hi>China</hi> de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duced and taken their History from their own antient Records ever since the time of <hi>Noah.</hi> We therefore beginning also at the Deluge, will now return to their Antiquity.</p>
            <p>Of the Deluge their Writers make much men<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, but of the original and cause thereof, as can yet be found, they give not any account. Which therefore whether it were that of <hi>Noah,</hi> or some other peculiar to the <hi>Chinois,</hi> as the <hi>Ogy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gian</hi> antiently in <hi>A<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">

<pb n="54" facs="tcp:41214:34"/>
the World; and that it contained either few or no other Nations besides themselves, and those generally so contemptible, as that they held them scarcely worthy the conquering, much less en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quiring after what successes or calamities befel them. And therefore with our Authors, I am very much resolved to believe, that, that flood which happened in <hi>China</hi> in the time of <hi>Iaus</hi> their seventh Empeeror, was the universal flood. For our Chronologers of <hi>Europe</hi> referr the flood of <hi>Noah</hi> to the very reign of this Emperor, and the <hi>Chinois</hi> themselves in their Annals relate, that during his government great numbers of People flocked into their Countrey; and that at the same time it was drowned, and overflown with waters, which were brought in by the De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>luge, <hi>Eas Author Sinicus ait diluvio invectas,</hi> saith <hi>Martinius</hi> in the life of <hi>Iaus.</hi> Considering which together with the coherence of Time, this De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>luge that thus drowned <hi>China</hi> could certainly be no other, than that, that drowned the whole World besides. And the flocking in of those peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple thither in such numbers, seemeth much to confirm the same. For thereby is evidently dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>covered as wel the great fears, that generally at last, possessed all Nations, as the hopes they had by their flying out of the low and champain Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gions adjoyning, to avoid and escape the threat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning danger, upon the great and high mountains, that run throughout, and as it were surround the <hi>Chinique</hi> World.</p>
            <p>But let us see how our Author proceedeth. <note place="margin">M. Mart. Sin. Hist. Lib. 1. p. 39.</note> And because that under this Emperor mention is made of the gathering together of waters,
<pb n="55" facs="tcp:41214:34"/>
which the History of <hi>China</hi> calleth the Deluge; and that the <hi>Europaean</hi> Chronologers from more certain grounds (from the computation of <hi>Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ses</hi> he might as wel have said) reduced the flood of <hi>Noah</hi> to the time of this Emperor. I could, saith <hi>Martinius,</hi> easily grant that all the History of the <hi>Chinois</hi> to this very time, is either fabulous, or comprehends those things, which happened be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore the flood, whereof the memory might hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pily be preserved in the Ark. For that many o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther things, which appertain also to our faith, were vindicated from oblivion, and utter destru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction even in the same place, is the opinion of learned men. He farther telleth us, That this extreme part of <hi>Asia,</hi> whereof we treat, was for certain inhabited before the flood. But by what means the memory of things could be preserved there, when all mankind was wholly destroyed, if we have not recourse to the family of <hi>Noah,</hi> is to me, saith the same Author unknown.

            <p>But from these his reservations, it may be much suspected, that <hi>Martinius</hi> in his own thoughts, had an higher opinion of this people,
<pb n="58" facs="tcp:41214:36"/>
than he deemed fitting to be vulgarly made known. And hence happily it is, that <hi>Vossius</hi> saith, <hi>Chorographiae Sericae interpres, vir minime</hi> 
               <note place="margin">I. Voss. de Aetat. Mun. pag. 45.</note>

And therefore had <hi>Martinius,</hi> having in manner from his cradle to his grave studied their Antiquities, written what he thought, and declaring his mind plainly, vouchsafed us those other Arguments he hath concealed, much more no doubt might have been discovered towards the clearing of what ensueth.</p>
            <p>For, whether <hi>Puoncuus</hi> was the Ringleader of this first Colony or not, it may be very much pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sumed, that <hi>Noah</hi> himself both before and after the Deluge lived in <hi>China. Iosephus</hi> attesteth, that <hi>Noah</hi> having warning of the flood given him <note place="margin">Iosep. Ant. Iud. lib. 1. cap. 4.</note> from God, seeing his perswasions to repentance and amendment of life, could work no effect up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on the Corruption of the Age, and fearing by the violence of the times to perish for his zeal, depar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted from his native soil, and with his wife and children travelled into another Countrey. <hi>Sece<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dens cum suis in aliam regionem migravit,</hi> saith <hi>Io<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sephus.</hi> Now, why might not this other Region into which <hi>Noah</hi> retired be <hi>China?</hi> And that confluence of people (which you lately heard of) resort thither, out of desire upon the report of his piety to hear him preach, the better to be prepared against the approaching ruine? For it seems they repaired thither not only in regard of
<pb n="59" facs="tcp:41214:36"/>
the flood, but also excited by the Fame of the vertues of <hi>Iaus</hi> and his uprightness, throwing themselves upon his protection as into their fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers bosome, in such numbers that the then <hi>Chi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nique</hi> Empire scarcely sufficed to contain them. From whence we may moreover observe, that the greater the thronging in of their numbers was, the greater probability there is, they throng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed in thither, in hope to save themselves from the Deluge. Considering especially, that the <hi>Chinique</hi> History recordeth, their Countrey was at that time destroyed by waters, and therefore <hi>Martinius</hi> is clearly of opinion, that these were either the waters of <hi>Noahs</hi> flood, which for a long time after kept the plains and lower places of this extreme part of <hi>Asia</hi> overflown, or <hi>China</hi> was drowned by a peculiar inundation.

of the Incumbrances which the flood had made, caused the Channels and mouths of the Rivers choaked up, as <hi>Martinius</hi> conceiveth, by the mud and sand which the violence of the Rains of the <hi>Noetique</hi> inundation had brought down, to be opened, and with banks and trenches brought within bounds, about which either through the want of skill in those that he employed, or hands in that newness of the World to assist him, long time was consumed, and not until after many years. during the reigns of his two next ensuing Successors brought to perfection in the end.

            <p>First, <hi>Noah</hi> had his name from the <hi>Comfort</hi> his father hoped to receive by him: and <hi>Iaus</hi> had
<pb n="61" facs="tcp:41214:37"/>
his name of the <hi>Happiness</hi> his father hoped should proceed from him.</p>
            <p>Secondly, <hi>Noah</hi> was so just and righteous a man, as that he surmounted all others of his Age: And <hi>Iaus</hi> so excelled in piety and vertue, as that he surpassed all others of his time.</p>
            <p>Thirdly, <hi>Noah</hi> was a <hi>Preacher,</hi> and taught the ways of God. And <hi>Iaus</hi> was a <hi>Divine,</hi> and or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dained sacred Rites, and prayers unto God.</p>
            <p>Fourthly, <hi>Noab</hi> was an Husbandman; and <hi>Iaus</hi> prescribed rules of Husbandry to his people.</p>
            <p>Fifthly, In the days of <hi>Noah</hi> the whole World was drowned, and in the days of <hi>Iaus</hi> the whole World was drowned.</p>
            <p>Sixthly, Before the flood of <hi>Noah,</hi> was a Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>junction of all the Planets in one Sign; and be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore the flood of <hi>Iaus</hi> was the like Conjunction of all the Planets.</p>
            <p>Seventhly, The son of <hi>Noah, Cham,</hi> was a re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>probate, and therefore by <hi>Noah</hi> made a servant to his brethren; and the son of <hi>Iaus, Chus,</hi> was a reprobrate, and therefore by <hi>Iaus</hi> excluded from succession in the Empire.</p>
            <p>Eighthly and lastly, the Deluge of <hi>Noah</hi> happe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned in the year before CHRIST two thousand two hundred ninety four; and the Deluge that destroyed <hi>China</hi> in the time of <hi>Iaus</hi> agrees per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fectly therewith; for he began his reign there, in the year before CHRIST two thousand three hundred fifty seven.</p>
            <p>Before the time of <hi>Moses</hi> the name of <hi>Iehouah,</hi> or rather <hi>Haiah,</hi> as <hi>Bayly</hi> in his Practice of Piety observes, was never known unto the <hi>Israelites.</hi> And those are not wanting that suppose, that

               <hi>Samaritans,</hi> as I find in <hi>Purchas,</hi> begin their Chronicle after this manner. In the name of <hi>Iah,</hi> the God of <hi>Israel;</hi> there is none like to <hi>Iah</hi> our God, one <hi>Iehova,</hi> God of Gods, Lord of Lords, a great God strong and terrible. <hi>Iah</hi> is is my strength and song, saith <hi>Moses</hi> in praysing God for the preservation of <hi>Israel</hi> from the dan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger of <hi>Pharaoh, Exod. 15. v.</hi> 2. Wherefore it is <note place="margin">Aynswor. in Exod.</note> not un-observable that the very first utterance that an Infant at his birth yeeldeth is, <hi>ya, ya, ya;</hi> as if the Lord had ordained, either that we should be born with his name <hi>Iah</hi> in our mouths, which name is generally ascribed to him, when some notable deliverance or benefit, according to his former promise comes to pass, because he is the beginning and <hi>Being</hi> of beings, and <hi>giveth to all, life, and breath, and all things,</hi> Act. 17. v. 25. or else, that in our swathling cloathes we should have something of the PRI<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>MITIVE Language, till afterwards con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>founded, as we are taught to speak. But by <hi>yà</hi> the <hi>Chinois</hi> intend <hi>Excellens.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>And how long soever the <hi>Chinois</hi> lived undis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>covered to other Nations, it seems, that of old, they were not to the <hi>Israelites</hi> unknown, as may be collected from those words of the Prophet <hi>Isaiah, Ecce isti a longinquo venient <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">

            <p>We may therefore conclude, That if either sym<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pathy of Qualities; Affinity of names, Coherence of Times; Concurrence in events; or most me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>morable predictions be of validity in the case: we have at last, after such curious enquiry by all Writers upon this subject, and the Plantations of the World after the Deluge, found out; what became of <hi>Noah</hi> after he departed out of his na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tive Countrey, and that he lived in <hi>China.</hi> Where after his descent out of the Ark, he might betake himself immediately to his husbandry and plant<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, in a rich, if not the richest soil of the whole Universe.

However we have not ended yet, and scarcely can end, his merits are famed to be such. For, he was of surpassing diligence, easie of access to all, never offended with the importunity of any; much less with any incivility, which through ignorance was committed in his presence. He readily heard the differences between his people, and decided them himself; his patience was not to be overcome; his affections not to be moved in treating of Affairs, and in a cool temper with a compassionately moderate voice gave judgment on Malefactors.</p>
            <p>And though it is true that Monarchy was then in use amongst the <hi>Chinois,</hi> (For <hi>Fabius Pictor</hi> could not know more, than was then known, and perhaps might think the Terrestrial Globe contained no other Countries, than what were arrived at the <hi>Romans</hi> knowledg) the <hi>desire</hi> ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vertheless of <hi>rule,</hi> the World being an Infant and harmless, <hi>had not then folded it self about the hearts of men.</hi> For our <hi>Ianus</hi> either weary there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of, or contemning it retired, and confining him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>self to a solitary grove, lived there in the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>templation of Heaven and Heavenly things; and from the motions of the Coelestial bodies made such observations, as that his Subjects after<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards became fully instructed by him, not only in the <hi>Institution</hi> of <hi>Gardens,</hi> and <hi>Groves</hi> for their devotions, but also in planting and husbandry of whatever kind was requisite for the benefit of mankind.</p>

questionable enough. For, <hi>Post haec,</hi> saith <hi>Mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinius, i. e.</hi> after his having given us the relation of the abatement of the waters) our <hi>Ianus</hi> brought the <hi>Chinique</hi> Empire into a better, yea, a new and another kind of form, than formerly it had, ordaining Sacred Rites, Temples, and Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crifices; constituting Laws both civil and cri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minal, and appointing several Tribunals of Ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stice, for the greater ease as well of the Subjects, as their Governours in succeeding times, which continue in full force even at this day. In sum, he presented all things as vertue required, with such a natural aptness, as if goodness had been born with him, <hi>omnia virtute at<expan>

            <p>He disinherited his son <hi>Chus,</hi> for being (mark I pray) <hi>Loquax &amp; contentiosus,</hi> a <hi>Pratler</hi> and stub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>born, saying one thing, acting another, seem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ingly vertuous, really vitious.</p>
            <p>After this, he deliberated of his own accord voluntarily, to make, whilst living, a resignation of his Government, and would have surrendred the same to the care of one <hi>Sungous,</hi> who though of high esteem for his abilities, pretending ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vertheless that the charge was too weighty for him, rejected the same. And thereupon our <hi>Ia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nus</hi> resigned his Dominion to <hi>Xunus,</hi> a right pi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous, but poor Countryman; who like <hi>Numa</hi> be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing invited to the Scepter from the plough, lives as yet no less famous for his vertues amongst

the <hi>Chinois,</hi> than <hi>Numa</hi> amongst the <hi>Romans,</hi> but for his valour much more. I cannot forbear to remember two principles of his; first, no father could be so wicked to whom his son owed not obedience; nor any man so impious, but by in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>struction and benefits might be induced to lead an honest and vertuous life.</p>
            <p>Now <hi>Martinius</hi> and <hi>Nieuhoff</hi> by their late search find <hi>Iaus</hi> to have entred upon his Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernment over <hi>China</hi> about sixty three years be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore the flood, though <hi>Semedo</hi> in his time will scarcely allow him twelve. But whether twelve or five times twelve, they compute, that he lived both before and after the Deluge, from which that <hi>Noah</hi> only with his wife, and his sons, and his sons wives escaped, nothing is more cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain. And therefore who this <hi>Yaus, Iaus,</hi> or <hi>Ianus</hi> could be, <hi>Noah</hi> excepted, is not to be un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derstood by me, unless happily any shall say, that the general Deluge happened long before the year of the World one thousand six hundred fif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty six, which I conceive no sober man, if he be not <hi>Samaritanized</hi> will presume to think. For the <hi>Samaritans</hi> indeed by diminishing the gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rations of <hi>Iared, Methusalah,</hi> and <hi>Lamech</hi> come short of the <hi>Hebrew</hi> computation before the flood, and exceed it much more in the Genealo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gies of the Patriarchs after the flood.</p>
            <p>We are here to observe likewise, that on such a subject as we now treat of, where the actions of an Antient people, before these days unto the <hi>Europaeans,</hi> or more truly, saith <hi>Martinius,</hi> unto the universal World unknown, are to be enqui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red <note place="margin">M.

of, that the Ark was built, not in the North, or Northwest, but in that part of the World which lay East from <hi>Shinaar:</hi> And to my under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>standing, saith Sir <hi>W. Raleigh,</hi> not far from the <note place="margin">

Also because it is not probable, that during those continual and downright rains there were any winds at all; therefore was the Ark little moved from the place, where it was fashioned, and set together. For it is written, <hi>God made a wind to pass upon the Earth, and the waters ceased.</hi> Gen. 8. v. 1. From whence it may be gathered, that during the fall of the waters, there was not any storm or forceable wind at all, which could drive the Ark any great distance from the place, where it was first by the waters lifted up. Thus far that Noble Gentleman.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Goropius Becanus</hi> in his <hi>Indo-Scythia</hi> doth in maintenance of his opinion, that the Ark took ground upon the mountains of <hi>Caucasus,</hi> sup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pose, that <hi>Noah</hi> built the Ark near those moun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tains, because on those hills are goodly Cedars: and that to this place <hi>Noah</hi> repaired both to se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parate himself from the reprobate Giants, who rebelled against God and Nature, as also because he would not be interrupted in building of the Ark; to which also he addeth conveniency of Rivers to transport the Timber, which he used without troubling any other carriages. Where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by <hi>Goropius</hi> appears you see very careful to sup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ply <hi>Noah</hi> with necessaries for so great a work;
<pb n="71" facs="tcp:41214:42"/>
and considering his giving so near a conjecture, as he doth, at the place where the Ark might rest, he had great reason to fortifie the same, with as many circumstances, as the quality of that Clime would admit.</p>
            <p>But having discovered such manifest foot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>steps of the Residence of <hi>Noah</hi> in <hi>China;</hi> after he withdrew from the corruption of the World, as that they far outweigh whatever supposal to the contrary; we must now wave <hi>Caucasus,</hi> and confidently affirm, that no Countrey in the ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bitable Earth could better furnish <hi>Noah,</hi> with all manner of conveniences, and every sort of ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terials proper for the building of such a Machine than <hi>China.</hi> For, if the Ark were made of Pine<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trees, as the <hi>Geneva</hi> translation renders the word <hi>Gopher,</hi> then <hi>Kircherus</hi> will assure you, such Pine<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trees are in <hi>China,</hi> that eight men can scarcely <note place="margin">A.

            <p>And as for conveniency of Rivers to transport the Timber, though without the use of other car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riages, it could never be brought to be put in work, either by <hi>Noah</hi> or his Assistants; <hi>Caucasus</hi> must with <hi>Goropius</hi> his good favour give place

Now, of the great store of pitch that <hi>China</hi> affordeth, no more assured testimony can be given, than <hi>Their</hi> multitudes of Shipping, and infinite number of Pine-trees; but that kind of pitch which these trees produceth, and which is to us so welcome; the <hi>Chinois</hi> have in little esteem; But use and ever did, a bituminous or pitchy substance found in great abundance every where throughout <hi>Their</hi> Countrey, which they make up, as we do morter with the oyl of a cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain fish, and therewith calk and dress their Ships.

They make it not of ordinary Rice; but a certain kind of it peculiar to their Countrey, which serveth on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly to make this liquor.</p>
            <p>And as for that, that <hi>Goropius</hi> saith, the Ark
<pb n="75" facs="tcp:41214:44"/>
rested upon the mountains of <hi>Caucasus,</hi> because of all others it is the highest mountain in the World, it is no argument at all; unless it could be made appear, that, as it is feigned of the <hi>Argos,</hi> the Ark had sence to direct it self, or <hi>Noah</hi> a rud<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der to steer it thither. It may as well be said, that it took ground on the Pike of <hi>Tenariff,</hi> which is conceived neither to yeeld to <hi>Caucasus,</hi> or any other whatever hill in the Universe for height. This we are certain of, that the Ark rest<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed on the Mountains, and reason granteth it was such a Mountain, as, were it more or less high, after the abatement of the waters, the Ark first touched upon; and setling afterwards as they declined, firmed on the same. And therefore nor Scripture nor reason will allow, it should be the highest of all others.</p>
            <p>However, if need require, <hi>China</hi> will afford us mountains of inaccessible altitude; for <hi>Kirche<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rus</hi>

The greatest and highest especially, the <hi>Chinois</hi> have in so great veneration, as that they are transported with no study more, than a vain observation of them, supposing all their felicity and fortune to consist in them. And why? because the Dragon, whom they make the Lord of felicity inhabites them. But in regard many things are now done where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of the original cause is hardly to be conjectured, I should, were it lawful for me to interpose herein, conceive rather, that this their impu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting

all their happiness and prosperity to their mountains, might at first proceed from the feli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>city and good fortune they attained, by their Ancestors being at the time of the flood preser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved in the Ark upon such mountains; great deli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verances having in all times, amongst all Nati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, by several ways, with reference neverthe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>less to the occasion been commemorated. Thus the <hi>Israelites</hi> observed the Passeover, in remem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brance that their forefathers were passed over, and saved, when all the first-born of <hi>Aegypt</hi> were slain. And I forget not to have read, That some are of opinion, the <hi>Nemaean</hi> Games were by the <hi>Graecians</hi> solemnized, because <hi>Hercules</hi> slew the <hi>Nemaean</hi> Lion, though others with more autho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity assert, they were solemnized in regard of the preservation of <hi>Adrastus</hi> and his Army, that in their march towards <hi>Thebes</hi> had all perished in the forest of <hi>Nemaea,</hi> if they had no been pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>served by <hi>Hypsiphile</hi> who directed them to a fountain of water there. And those also are not wanting, that suppose the <hi>Lupercalia</hi> were insti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tuted by the <hi>Romans</hi> in honour of <hi>Pan,</hi> when more probably they were instituted in memory that their Founders <hi>Romulus</hi> and <hi>Remus</hi> were sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved by being suckled and brought up by <hi>Lupa</hi> the wife of <hi>Faustulus.</hi> And that, from the preserva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of their Ancestors, as we said, this superstiti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of the <hi>Chinois</hi> may proceed, is not altogether unwarrantable, but attended with a most re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>markable circumstance. For by their History it appears, that at the time when <hi>China</hi> was drown<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, some people were saved upon the mountain <hi>Feu</hi> neer the City of <hi>Kaocheu</hi> in the Province

But my conjecture is scarcely delivered, when an objection is cast in my way.</p>
            <p>For it is now said, That if <hi>Noah</hi> lived in <hi>Chi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>na</hi> before the flood, how could the Ark rest up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on the mountains of <hi>Ararat,</hi> as the Scripture saith positively, it did; when <hi>Caucasus</hi> being a mountain of <hi>Ararat</hi> is distant from <hi>China</hi> at least four hundred leagues, and when the Ark having neither Sails to carry it, Oars to row it, nor cur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rent
<pb n="78" facs="tcp:41214:46"/>
to drive it, could, as hath been said, hull up and down only, as on a standing pool? And there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore it may be much more probable, that <hi>Noah</hi> both lived and built the Ark not far from the Mountains of <hi>Cauasus,</hi> where it took ground, as Sir <hi>W. Raleigh,</hi> and <hi>Goropius</hi> have supposed. To this is answered, That in the Province of <hi>Ly<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cia,</hi> a Region of <hi>Asia minor</hi> near the <hi>Mediterra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nean</hi> Sea, that ledge of Hills begins, which <hi>Moses</hi> calleth <hi>Ararat,</hi> now known by the name of <hi>Tau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rus,</hi> and which running through the lesser and greater <hi>Asia,</hi> not far from <hi>Caucasus</hi> meets with the Mount <hi>Imaus.</hi> Now, though the Antient <note place="margin">Heyl.

               </q> Whereby it appears, that as <hi>Ararat</hi> had its <hi>Caucasus,</hi> so <hi>China</hi> had her <hi>Ararat,</hi> upon which the Ark might rest, as upon the mountains of <hi>Ararat,</hi> the Scripture saith posi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tively it did. And it is not un-observable, the
<pb n="79" facs="tcp:41214:46"/>
Scripture teacheth us, that the Ark rested, not on the mountain in the singular, but on the mountains of <hi>Ararat</hi> in the plural. A manifest argument that <hi>Ararat</hi> was a general name, and had reference to the whole ledge of Hills, not to any particular mountain so called. As we even at this day both in discourse and writing use in the same sence to say, not the mountain, but mountains of <hi>Taurus;</hi> not the <hi>Pyraenian</hi> hill, but hills; not the <hi>Alp,</hi> but <hi>Alps.</hi> Neither must we forget, that if according to the <hi>Hebrew</hi> mode you cast your eye from the right to the left, and admit <hi>Taura</hi> in the <hi>Foeminine,</hi> you shall find it will produce <hi>Aruat.</hi> And had <hi>Goropius</hi> lived to have perused our late discoveries, he <note place="margin">G. Bec. Iu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dos. p. 476.</note> would never so contrary to reason, have raised, I know not how changeable and violent winds to drive the Ark from the south of <hi>Paropamisus</hi> in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to the north to the beginning of <hi>Caucasus,</hi> and then back to the southward again, until at last upon the highest tops of <hi>Caucasus,</hi> by great good fortune, he makes it rest. Nor he, or our <hi>Raleigh</hi> troubled themselves and Readers, with so many tedious Arguments about this Mountain as they have done, but without doubt, have concluded, that the Ark rested on the mountains of <hi>Ararat</hi> confining <hi>China.</hi> In which Region <hi>Noah</hi> having lived before the flood, the Ark needed neither Winds, nor Sails, nor Oars, nor Current to transport it; but being born up by the waters, might in five moneths time, going upon them, be wafted by the weight of them only, let the pool be as standing as you please, out of the plain Countrey of <hi>China</hi> below, to the adjoyning
<pb n="80" facs="tcp:41214:47"/>
mountains of <hi>Ararat</hi> above, And thereby both sacred Scripture fulfilled, and prophane History certainly reconciled.</p>
            <p>For, thus with the Scripture, <hi>Nimrod</hi> and his Troops might go from the East to the valley of <hi>Shinaar,</hi> as the very letter of the Text saith they did; whereas <hi>Caucasus</hi> bendeth into the North. <hi>And as they journeyed from the East, they found a plain in the land of Shinaar, and they dwelt there.</hi> As if the Providence of God had de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>creed, that the World should begin to be plant<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, even from the utmost extremity thereof, thereby to prescribe a rule to all after Ages; in what manner they ought to conduct and carry on their Plantations by degrees. Hence as it was with our forefathers, so by us in the setling of Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lonies, it is still observed, to follow always the Sun, wheresoever it is free, and may without danger be done, lest otherwise the conduct of Nature should seem without cause to be resisted by us.</p>
            <p>Thus with <hi>Raleigh, Noah,</hi> at first when he came down out of the Ark after returning thanks to God for his deliverance, might become an hus<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bandman, no wanderer; <hi>Nimrod</hi> be six years in travailing from the place, where the Ark rested to <hi>Shinaar;</hi> and <hi>India</hi> the sooner inhabited by the way thither, whereby the vast numbers of the army of <hi>Staurobates,</hi> with which he encoun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tred <hi>Semiramis,</hi> might have suf<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">

               </gap>cient time to be propagated, and consequently exceed hers. Thus, with the same Author, <hi>Goropius</hi> and <hi>Heylin,</hi> the Ark might rest not far from the place where <hi>Noah</hi> lived,, without calling sometimes the
<pb n="81" facs="tcp:41214:47"/>
North, sometimes the South winds to help, as <hi>Goropius</hi> doth; and <hi>Noah</hi> be setled in the East, and have well peopled all those parts, which lay nearest to him, before he sent <hi>Nimrod</hi> and his Troop abroad to search for other habitations. Thus with <hi>Raleigh</hi> also, might the sons of <hi>Ioc<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">

Thus with <hi>Heylin</hi> might <hi>China</hi> be planted before the rest of the Adven<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turers went to seek new fortunes at the Tower of <hi>Babel.</hi> Thus, with <hi>Martinius</hi> might <hi>Iaus</hi> without scruple be <hi>Noah;</hi> this extreme part of <hi>Asia</hi> wherof we write, be for certain inhabited before the flood; the History of <hi>China</hi> preserved in the Ark; and the people thereof arrive to the per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fection of Arts and Sciences, so early as they did. Thus, with <hi>Willet</hi> might <hi>Noah</hi> without dispute be exercised in planting of Religion, and doing most excellent works for the benefit of Mankind; Thus, with <hi>Nieuhoff</hi> might <hi>Xensi</hi> be of just right the most antient Province of <hi>Asia,</hi> and in memory thereof the Emperours of <hi>China</hi> keep their Imperial residence therein, ever since the universal Flood, till the reign of the family of <hi>Hana.</hi> Thus, with <hi>Heylin</hi> and <hi>Martinius</hi> both, might <hi>China</hi> unquestionably be peopled from
<pb n="82" facs="tcp:41214:48"/>
the cessation of the Deluge, before the Enter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prise of <hi>Babel,</hi> and <hi>Confusion</hi> of <hi>Tongues.</hi> And thus may the Language of the Empire of <hi>China</hi> be preferred to all others.</p>
            <p>And hereby we find, that Sir <hi>W. Raleigh</hi> had great reason to assert, That these Eastern parts of the World were the first peopled Countries after the flood, and planted before <hi>Noah</hi> sent <hi>Nimrod</hi> and his followers abroad upon new dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>coveries. And that <hi>Heylin</hi> might upon good <note place="margin">Heyl.

So that at the end of every mile at least, new and new habitations appear. All the Cities nevertheless are built after one form, <hi>viz.</hi> of a square figure, and he that hath seen one of them, may easily comprehend the manner of all the rest. The hou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ses are for the most part of Timber, and gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rally of one story high, whereby as they avoid the wearying of themselves in ascending by stairs, so they take up much ground, what they want in height being fully recompenced by the length. They are, without rude, but within

adorned with all manner of splendour and mag<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nificence. Thus <hi>Kircherus.</hi>

            <p>But our <hi>Heylin</hi> more particularly proceedeth, finding <hi>China</hi> to be provided with five hundred <note place="margin">Heyl.

Besides, their dwellings on Shipboard, wherein whole families reside, and where they buy, sell, are born, live and die. In such numbers, as that the question may well be, saith <hi>Kircherus,</hi> whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther more people live aboard their Ships, or in <note place="margin">A. Kirch. Ch.

And of Shipping such multitudes they have, that the Rivers seem to be no otherwise covered with them, than the land with houses; whence the <hi>Chinois</hi> use, by way of Proverb to say, that their Emperour is able to make a Bridge of Ships from <hi>China</hi> to <hi>Malaca,</hi> which are five hundred Leagues asunder. And least any that tow the Vessels in course of Trade, should be obstructed or retarded in their passage, neither any Tree is suffered to grow, or other impediment permitted within five foot of the water-side. And the same order is observed for the better commoding of the highways to the use of Travellers.</p>

The Kingdom of <hi>China</hi> alone, we may see so adorned with innumerable, and those most flourishing Cities, that if we should say, it were one entire Province, we should hardly say amiss. It is so furnished with frequent Towns, Castles, Villages, and places dedicated to their superstition; that if that wall of three hundred leagues in length, memorable in all Ages, were extended from Sea to Sea, all <hi>China</hi> throughout how great, how large soever, might not unde<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>servedly be said to be one City, in which is found such infinite plenty of whatever is necessary for the life of mankind; as that, that which the wise industry of Nature hath here and there a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monst other Kingdoms of the World disper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed, may all be summarily seen to be contain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed within this one only.</p>

            <p>But let us see what <hi>Martinius</hi> will afford us. Of the Great and first Author of things, saith he, there is amongst all the <hi>Chinois</hi> a wonderful si<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lence, for, in so copious a Language God hath not so much as a name; oftentimes nevertheless they use the word <hi>Xangti,</hi> by which they signifie the Supream Governour of Heaven and Earth. This <hi>Numen,</hi> we may say, was the <hi>Tetragramma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ton</hi> of the <hi>Chinois; Deus Optimus Maximus</hi> be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, <note place="margin">Id lib. 4. pag. 149.</note> as is generally conceived, professed and ado<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red by them of old under the name of <hi>Xangti. Huic enim ut supremo numini sacra facicbant, fun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>debantque preces, nullis ad religionem exciendam si<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mulacris aut statuis usi; quippe qui numen ubique praesens venerantes, illud extra sensus omnes positum, nulla crederent imagine posse mortalium oeulis re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>praesentari.</hi> For unto him as to the supreme God they offered sacrifices and poured forth their prayers, using neither Statues nor Images for stir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring up their devotion; for in regard adoring an Omnipotent and Incomprehensible Deity, they believed he was not by the resemblance of any thing to be represented to the eyes of Mortals. Now by whom could this people be instructed in such divine principles as these, but by <hi>Noah</hi> or <hi>Sem?</hi> For certain we are that the <hi>Hebrews</hi> who descended from <hi>Noah</hi> and <hi>Sem</hi> held it unlawful
<pb n="88" facs="tcp:41214:51"/>
to use the name <hi>Iehovah,</hi> except within the San<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctuary, when the Priest blessed the People, ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to the Law, in <hi>Num. 6. v.</hi> 23. And that they were <hi>not to make unto Him any graven Image, or any likeness of any thing, that is in Heaven above, or that is in the Earth beneath, or that is in the water under the Earth;</hi> we find in <hi>Exod. 20. v.</hi> 4.</p>
            <p>But <hi>Martinius</hi> will conduct us farther yet. In these our days they worship a certain <hi>Numen,</hi> which what it is, they verily know not. As, the <hi>Athenians,</hi> I may add, had an Altar dedicated unto the unknown God, which as the Apostle instructeth us, was God that made Heaven and Earth. <hi>Act. 17. v.</hi> 24. But that of old, saith <hi>Mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinius,</hi> the <hi>Chinois</hi> professed the true God, from the Doctrine delivered them by <hi>Noah,</hi> there is no doubt to be made. <hi>Olim vero quin ve<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">

And it is memorable, that their Emperour that reigned at the birth of CHRIST <note place="margin">Id. lib. 10. pag. 413.</note> would not be called <hi>Ngayus,</hi> as his name was, but <hi>Pingus,</hi> which signifies <hi>Pacificns;</hi> by a won<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derful Providence of God, that at the time that CHRIST the true <hi>Pacifique</hi> King came upon the Earth, the Emperour of <hi>China</hi> should be called <hi>Pacifique</hi> also.</p>

            <p>To return therefore to <hi>Confutius,</hi> his usual saying, and wherein he concluded, the highest perfection to consist, was, <hi>Ne facias ulli, quod pati nolis,</hi> which is the Law and the Prophets. <hi>And as you would that men should do to you, do ye also to them likewise.</hi> Luk. 6. v. 31.

Now, how fully they accord with the words of our Saviour herein. <hi>Matth. 24. v.</hi> 6, 7. declares.</p>
            <p>Add unto these, that in their Books they fre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quently <note place="margin">M. Mart.

But this seems only to relate unto the condition of our present life; for that they have any knowledge of the Judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
<pb n="91" facs="tcp:41214:52"/>
hereafter, from <hi>Martinius</hi> appears not. The Antiquity of their <hi>Theology</hi> not conducting them so far. Yet nevertheless I find in <hi>Trigantius,</hi> that <note place="margin">N. Trig. in Christ. Exp. apud Sin. lib. 1. p. 105.</note> from all times they have made no question of the immortality of the Soul, speaking often of the dead, as living in Heaven, but of the punishments of wicked men in Hell, not a word.</p>
            <p>The name of <hi>Iustice</hi> they confine not to that vertue which is a constant and perpetual will of <note place="margin">M. Mart. Sin. Hist. lib. 3. p. 96.</note> giving every man his due. But allow it such a lati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tude that every action consentaneous to reason is thereby signified. A true Maxime; for whatever is agreeable to reason, we may justly say to be just. And by the name of <hi>Piety</hi> they understand not the love only of God, their Parents, or them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves, but of all men universally. For, as they define <hi>Iustice</hi> to be the law and conveniency of doing well; so <hi>Piety,</hi> the means and rule of lo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving well. A Divine Principle, for we are to love our neighbours as our selves; according to that in <hi>Matth. 22. v.</hi> 39.</p>
            <p>Now, this high Divinity of <hi>Theirs</hi> admits a particular reflexion. <hi>H. Grotius</hi> in his discourses of God and his Providence, as I find him En<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>glished by <hi>Barksdale, pag. 18, and</hi> 19. tells us, That <hi>Moses</hi> his Books, wherein those Miracles are recorded, which at the <hi>Israelites</hi> coming out of <hi>Ae<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gypt,</hi> and in the wilderness, and in their entrance into the land of <hi>Canaan</hi> had happened, are of certain credit; not only because the present <hi>Iews</hi> from their Parents, as they from theirs, and so forward until we arrive at those who lived in <hi>Moses</hi> and <hi>Ioshua</hi> his time, by certain and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stant Tradition have received those miracles, but
<pb n="92" facs="tcp:41214:53"/>
also, because there hath been a perpetual fame among the <hi>Hebrews,</hi> that <hi>Moses</hi> was commended by the Oracle of God, and made a Leader of his People; and because it is sure enough, that he was neither studious of his own glory, nor par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tial to his own Posterity. All which declares, saith <hi>Grotius,</hi> he had no reason to deceive us. Now, finding this <hi>Theology</hi> of the <hi>Chinois,</hi> not by tradition, and a perpetual fame, but in Books suc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cessively written from Age to Age, ever since the <note place="margin">Isaack. Chron. pag. 47.</note> universal Deluge, above seven hundred years be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore <hi>Moses</hi> was born, to be equally agreeable and consonant towhat CHRIST himself and <hi>Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ses</hi> hath taught us, and what we profess. And that in writing of these Books, the <hi>Chinois</hi> were neither studious of their own glory, nor partial to their own posterity, which declares they had no reason to deceive us. I see no cause to doubt, but that they received this <hi>Their Theology, ex do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrina à Nöe tradita,</hi> from the doctrine taught them by <hi>Noah,</hi> as <hi>Martinius</hi> from their Books hath positively affirmed. Considering withal, that <hi>Noah was a just man, and perfect in his genera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions, and Noah walked with God.</hi> Gen. 6. <hi>v.</hi> 9.</p>
            <p>As for Their policy in government, I shall chiefly observe what <hi>Kircherus</hi> delivers. That if <note place="margin">A. Kirch. Chi. Ill. par. 2: p. 115</note> ever any Monarchy in the world was constituted according to political principles, and dictates of right reason, it may be boldly said that of the <hi>Chinois</hi> is. For therein every thing is found dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>posed in so great order; as that whereas all matters are under the rule and power of their <hi>Literati,</hi> or wiseman; so also hardly any thing is transacted throughout the whole Empire which
<pb n="93" facs="tcp:41214:53"/>
depends not upon them; neither can any man attain to any degree of Honour, that is not very richly learned in their Letters and Sciences. In a word, their Kings may be said to be Philoso<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phers, and their Philosophers, Kings; and they order every thing, saith <hi>Semedo,</hi> in such manner, as may most conduce to good government, con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cord, <note place="margin">Al. Sem. Rel. del. Cin. par. 1. cap. 18.</note> peace, and quietness in families, and to the exercise of vertue: Insomuch he tels us, that so great an Empire seemeth to be but, as it were, one well governed Convent.</p>
            <p>Their first form of Government, until the time of their Emperours was paternal, as is written of <hi>Abraham</hi> and <hi>Lot.</hi> But no credit is given to whatever their History relates, during this form of rule. For the <hi>Chinois</hi> themselves, as hath been <note place="margin">M. Mart. Sin. hist. lib. 1. pag. 12</note> said, suspect the credit of their Annals before the reign of their Emperour <hi>Folmis,</hi> as containing those things, that are for the most part ridiculous and false.</p>
            <p>Their first Emperours were elective, but about the year before CHRIST two thousand, two hundred, and seaven, which according to the Hebrew or vulgar computation, and which with our <hi>Chinique</hi> Authors we follow, was forty four yeares before the Confusion of Tongues, they began to rule by hereditary right; and for nume<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rous successions after the flood were not Idola<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters, but Adorers of the true God of Heaven and Earth; and were Priests also, and offered sacri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fices to him; as no question from the Example of <hi>Noah</hi> they had learned; and as the Patriarchs <hi>Abraham, Isaac,</hi> and <hi>Iacob</hi> were afterwards ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>customed to do. For, it was not lawful, saith
<pb n="94" facs="tcp:41214:54"/>
               <hi>Martinius,</hi> for any to officiate in <hi>sacris</hi> but the Emperour; nor for any to be inves<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">

               </gap>ed with the sacerdotal dignity, but he that swayed the scep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter, so highly have they ever reverenced their sacred matters. Neither was Idolatry known un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to them, till after the birth of CHRIST, when <note place="margin">Purch. Pil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>grimage, lib. 1. pag. 67.</note> for many Ages preceding, the whole World had followed Idols; for, the Offspring of <hi>Cham</hi> de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rive their Idolatry even from the time of <hi>Noah;</hi> and the <hi>Israelites</hi> themselves had deserted God above one thousand years before. But <hi>Corruptio optimi p<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">

            <p>Casting off their antient Theology, they enter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tained that error of the Eternity of the World; <note place="margin">M. Mart. Sin. Hist. lib. 1. p. 11.</note> with which, as <hi>Martinius</hi> informeth us, together with the worship of Idols, they were, in the sixty fifth year after CHRIST, infected by an <hi>Indian</hi> Philosopher that crept into <hi>China,</hi> as <hi>Xaverius</hi> the Jesuit to propagate the Gospel a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mong them, did of late times.

               <note place="margin">Bayl.

But this their antient knowledg of, and constant perseverance in the worship of the true God requires as yet, a more serious considerati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on; For we find in <hi>Iosephus</hi> that <hi>Noah</hi> at his <note place="margin">Ios.

read nothing more of any such worship, till the dayes of <hi>Abraham;</hi> who we are taught, was by God himself peculiarly chosen, and called there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>unto; <hi>Gen.</hi> 12. And who, saith the same <hi>Iosephus,</hi> first of all did most manifestly preach and prove, that there was but one God, Governour and Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ker <note place="margin">Id. cap. 8.</note> of all things. When as in <hi>China</hi> one God, by whom all things are governed and preserved, was not only adored, during all that time from <hi>Noah</hi> unto <hi>Abraham;</hi> but also hath continually from <hi>Abraham</hi> to this very day, been adored a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mongst them; their <hi>Literati</hi> especially. So that had this extreme part of <hi>Asia</hi> been discovered in the time of St. <hi>Augustine,</hi> he might have assigned far larger bounds to his City of God, and <hi>the Tents of Sem,</hi> than otherwise he hath done.</p>
            <p>That which <hi>Aristotle</hi> hath delivered of the People of <hi>Asia,</hi> is verified in the nature of the <note place="margin">M. Mart. Atl. Sin. p. 5.</note> 
               <hi>Chinois:</hi> We <hi>Europaeans</hi> exceed them in point of valour, They us in subtlety of invention.

Prudence, Fidelity</hi> in such high esteem, as that all their most antient and fundamental Laws were framed out of them, neither are they in less ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count amongst them at this day, than in times of old.

            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>Gin,</hi> they say, signifies <hi>Piety, Humanity, Chari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty, Reverence, Love, Compassion,</hi> which after this manner they explain, <hi>To</hi> esteem ones self less than others; <hi>To</hi> be affable; <hi>To</hi> succour those that are afflicted; <hi>To</hi> help those that are in ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cessity; <hi>To</hi> have a tender and compassionate heart; <hi>To</hi> bear good will towards all men; <hi>To</hi> use all this more particularly towards their Parents.</p>

            <p>
               <hi>Li,</hi> as they expound it, is <hi>Policy, Courtesie,</hi> to honour and reverence others as is fitting, which they say, consisteth, <hi>In</hi> the mutual respect one man is to bear another; <hi>In</hi> the mature conside<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration and circumspection which is to be used in managing of affairs; <hi>In</hi> the modesty of outward deportment; <hi>In</hi> obedience to Magistrates; <hi>In</hi> be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing gentle to young men, and respectful to old.</p>

            <p>And for better propagation of Learning their Emperours erected <hi>Publique Schools,</hi> and <hi>Acade<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mies,</hi> that their Subjects might be instructed, in whatever Arts and Moral Vertues; whereby from their childhood growing up to the elegan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy of most excellent abilities; they were indued with observance to their Elders, and duty to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards their Parents; who with all the most sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>missive reverence, were ever; and still are honou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red by them; not only during their lives, but af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter death likewise; so that no People under the Sun with more regret, and greater ceremony condole the loss of their Parents, than the <hi>Chi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nois;</hi> Never for three years together after their<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deaths, stirring out of their doors; never sitting in <note place="margin">A.

This being done by them, saith <hi>Martinius,</hi> that from the respect which <note place="margin">M. Mart. hist.

As if their first Founder had taught them, <hi>Honour thy father and thy mother, that thy days may be long upon the land, which thy Lord thy God giveth thee.</hi> Exod 20. v. 12. And certain it is, that throughout their whole Empire, they are
<pb n="103" facs="tcp:41214:58"/>
generally known to live a long and happy life. <note place="margin">A Sem. Rel. de la Cin. par. 1. cap. 1.</note> We read, that there have been those amongst them, whose bones were twelve or thirteen Cu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bits long, and that they lived one thousand years and more; which if so, it must be before the flood. But in regard this seems to spring from Tradition only, if according to <hi>Nieuhoff</hi> it be looked upon as a vapour of the <hi>Chinois,</hi> and that <note place="margin">I. Nieuh. l' Amb. Or. par. 1. pag. 122.</note> with him we admit it into the rank of Fables, yet the reason that he gives for its untruth, doth not hold good against it. For, he saith, the Holy Scripture tells us, that not one of the men of the first Age of the World lived unto a thousand years. Now that there were Giants both before and after the flood is manifest, <hi>Gen. 6. v. 4. Deut. 3. v.</hi> 11. And though we find <hi>Methusalah</hi> to have lived nine hundred sixty nine years; neverthe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>less, that he was the longest liver of all the men of the first Age of the World, we need not grant, neither is he by <hi>Moses</hi> precisely so recorded to be. Indeed as to those ten generations, that from the Creation to the Deluge proceeded from <hi>Adam,</hi> by the line of <hi>Seth,</hi> with their several Ages, we must acknowledge it to be true, but whether those seven of the line of <hi>Cain,</hi> or any of their Progeny outlived any of those of the other ten, is not expressed in Sacred story. And it will seem more probable, saith Dr. <hi>Brown,</hi> 
               <q>That of the line of <hi>Cain,</hi> some were longer liv'd than any <note place="margin">
                     <hi>Dr.</hi> Bro. Pseudod.

<pb n="104" facs="tcp:41214:59"/>
are of the same Age which are born within the same year, <hi>Eve</hi> was as old as her husband and Parent <hi>Adam,</hi> and <hi>Cain</hi> their son coeta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neous to both.</q> However, certain it is, that the <hi>Chinois,</hi> in vigour and perfect health, live com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monly unto seventy, eighty or an hundred years of Age.</p>
            <p>The loss of Parents amongst them is not so much condoled by their children, but that chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren are as dear unto their Parents, from whence it proceeds, that their Nobility are so aversly dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>posed that the Emperour should marry any of their daughters, because when once setting foot within his Palace, they are eternally deprived of their <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">

And hence, the Emperours wife comes generally to be of the meanest of the people; not her extract, but beauty being respected. And it is a Maxime with their <hi>Literati,</hi> that to deprive a father of his child, is to take away a beam from the Sun, the source from the Fountain, the member from the body, and the branch from the tree. Thus, for father<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly affection and filial piety, <hi>China</hi> may give ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ample to all Nations of the World. The union is reciprocal; the Parents indulge their chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren, and the children esteem no time more un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fortunate, than that same hour, which gives be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginning to the fatal period of their Parents lives.</p>
            <p>In their Marriages they seem to have much Analogy with the <hi>Hebrews.</hi> For as in the Law
<pb n="105" facs="tcp:41214:59"/>
of <hi>Moses,</hi> Levit. 18. <hi>These</hi> were prohibited to marry within certain degrees of consanguinity; so, by the Laws of their Forefathers, our <hi>Chinois</hi> were not to wed any of the same name, which to this day they observe: Again, as the <hi>Chinois</hi> have been accustomed to have two sorts of wives, <note place="margin">A. Sem. Rel. de la Cin. par. 1. cap. 15. T. Godwin Ant. Iud. lib. 6. cap. 4</note> a matrimonially wedded wife, and a Concubine, both of them accounted lawful; so, the <hi>Hebrews</hi> had two sorts of wives, a wife married with <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">
                  <desc>•…</desc>
               </gap>up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tial ceremonies, and a Concubine, both of them reputed lawful. As the wife of <hi>These</hi> was as Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stress, and the Concubine as an hand-maid or servant; so, the Concubine of <hi>Those</hi> was in sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jection to the true wife, and as a servant upon se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veral occasions served her. Also the children by both wives were held legitimate in either Nati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on. As likewise when the Concubine had brought forth a son, the wife might, if she pleas<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed send her away, as <hi>Sarah</hi> did <hi>Hagar,</hi> Gen. 21. v. 10. But in <hi>China,</hi> where all these rituals are still observed, the Child stays behind, acknow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledging only for his mother, his fathers lawful wife.</p>
            <p>The Widows of the <hi>Chinique</hi> Gentry are ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nererally inaccessable to a second marriage. And their Virgins that by an untimely death have lost their Lovers, forsaking all worldly pleasures re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tire commonly into the desart mountains, lead<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing in them a most deplorable and lamentable life, never by any allurements of their Parents or Friends to be reclaimed, until either Lions or Tigers intomb them in their bowels. But al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>though as well their Virgins, as Widows are thus chastly resolved. Barrenness in wedlock
<pb n="106" facs="tcp:41214:60"/>
nevertheless, is, by them as with the <hi>Hebrews</hi> placed in the number of their chiefest calami<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties, not only by their Kings and Rulers, but al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>so by the meanest of the people. And to be en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>forced to depart, with the inheritance belonging to their Ancestors, is, they conceive the greatest misery that can befal them.</p>
            <p>We read of <hi>Solomon,</hi> that he prayed to God, to give him an understanding heart. 1 <hi>Reg. 3. v.</hi> 9.

therein. As the body of <hi>Iacob</hi> was transla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted out of <hi>Aegypt</hi> upon the same account, <hi>Gen. 50. v.</hi> 7. and buried in the same sepulcher, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in these five <hi>Abraham, Isaac, Sarah, Rebekah,</hi> and <hi>Leah</hi> were laid, himself making the sixth; the first Letters of all their names being contained in that one name of ISRAEL. fo likewise were the bones of <hi>Ioseph</hi> carried up out of <hi>Aegypt,</hi> and inhumed in <hi>Sychem</hi> in the land of <hi>Canaan,</hi> Exo. 13. v. 19. where in like manner the other Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>triarchs were buried; <hi>Act. 7. v.</hi> 16. And even by the modern <hi>Iews</hi> this custome is observed at this day from a conceited opinion;; <q>That if an <hi>Israelite</hi> be buried in any strange Countrey out <note place="margin">T. Godwin Ant. Iud. lib. 6. c. 5.</note> of the promised land, he shall not be partaker so much as of the Resurrection, except the Lord vouchsafe to make him <hi>hollow passages</hi> un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der the earth, through which his body by a con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinual volutation and rolling may be brought into the land of <hi>Canaan.</hi>
               </q> Wherefore from <hi>Italy,</hi> and other places where they are tolerated, I have heard, that oftentimes they fraight whole Ships with coffins of dead bodies, which are trans<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ported to the Ports of <hi>Syria,</hi> and thence convey<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed into <hi>Iudaea,</hi> and there in<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">

            <p>Furthermore, the <hi>Chinois</hi> observe the New and Full Moon-days with great ceremony, and rec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kon the year by the Moon like the <hi>Hebrews;</hi> near<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly relating to whom, they have many more ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>servances and institutions customary with them. Amongst others the like Commandments, which <note place="margin">A. Sem.

indeed thinks these not antient, but that from all Antiquity, till their falling into Idolatry, they were not to make the resemblance of any thing in point of adoration, <hi>Martinius</hi> hath fully assu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red us. And how antient soever the rest be, upon every day of the New and Full Moon, a little before Sun-rising, at one and the same hour, they make solemn publication of them, in all the Cities, and all the streets throughout their whole Empire.</p>
            <p>In the Province of <hi>Suchuen</hi> the same <hi>Martinius</hi> relates a memorable thing to have hapned. For <note place="margin">M. Mart. Atl. Sin. p. 71.</note> they write, saith he, that a certain woman, walk<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing by the side of the river <hi>Chocung,</hi> which runs by the City of <hi>Kiating,</hi> perceived a reed in the water, from whence a voice proceeded, and tak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing it up found an infant lying therein (for the reeds or Canes in <hi>China</hi> are about the bigness of little vessels) which she carried home and brought up, and which not long after was called <hi>Yelang,</hi> and in those parts that tend into the West, gave beginning to the Kingdom of <hi>Yelang.</hi> And was not <hi>Moses</hi> found after the same manner in an Ark of bulrushes, taken up and educated by the daughter of <hi>Pharoah?</hi> And what an high Prince<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome be afterwards attained, we all know.</p>
            <p>What should I say of the conversation of the <hi>Chinois?</hi> It inchants their familiars rather, than delights them. What of their Entertainments? They are stately and magnificent, and performed so silently, and in such goodly order, as is not by any pen to be expressed. What of the education of their Children? It makes all those admire that see them, being not brought up to wanton<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness
<pb n="109" facs="tcp:41214:61"/>
of speech, ostentation in habits, alluring en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticements, to liberty and pleasures; but unto duties beseeming their sex and condition; not knowing what either arrogancy or impudency means. So that their daughters not bring porti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons to their husbands; but their Husbands pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vide all things whatsoever that are needful for them. What of their servants? When every one, even the meanest, with due respect and awful silence, knows how to do, and doth it. What of the disposition of their Natures generally? Since, enjoying all kind of the most wealthy commodi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties, by which they might infinitely enrich them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves, they sell them at inconsiderable prizes, desiring food and raiment only, as <hi>Iacob</hi> did, Gen. 28. v. 20.</p>
            <p>We might acquiesce here, and now insist no longer on particulars, these being sufficient to declare, that <hi>China</hi> is the most antient, and in all probability, was, the first planted Countrey of the World after the flood. But in regard it is much to be presumed that as wel <hi>Asia</hi> as <hi>Europe</hi> is extremely indebted to this industrious Nation; from which as from the fountain they have drained all their chiefest Arts and Manufactures, somwhat more of their ingenuity is yet remaining to be said. For the <hi>Chinois</hi> invented and have had <note place="margin">M. Mart. Sin. Hist. lib. 4. p. 106</note> in use amongst them, the Loadstone and compass for Navigation, above eleven hundred years before the birth of CHRIST. An undoubted argument that the use thereof being so long time since found out by the <hi>Chinois,</hi> hath from them in mine opinion, saith <hi>Martinius,</hi> been brought into other Countreys.</p>

among them about the fiftieth yeare after <note place="margin">M. Mart. Sin. Hist. lib. 8. p. 353.</note> CHRIST, we owe unto their studies also. Their manner is thus, they cut their Letters with an instrument of iron, as we do woodprints, upon a piece of Pear-tree, or some such other smooth wood, lightly gluing the written copy thereon, whereby their books are free from all Errata's. They are very dextrous at it, and will cut an whole sheet, as soon as a Composer with us can set one, and one man will print off fifteen hundred in a day. This commodity they have also, that they may be laid by for as many impres<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sions as they please, and in the mean time print off, no more copies, than they find sale for, both which advantages are wanting in our manner of Printing.</p>
            <p>One of their Emperours by the means of Chy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mistry, found out that thrifty and frugal way of <note place="margin">I. Nieuh. l' Amb.

Their store of Powder is very great; in the use of their Guns they have little skill and less delight; but in making Fire-works are most curiously artificial, representing Trees, Fruits, Battles; with what not other rarities.

            </p>
            <p>It hath been commonly reported, that they make their <hi>Porcelain</hi> of Egg-shells, or the shells of Sea-fish beaten to powder, which they cast up in an heap within the bowels of the Earth, and therein let it lie an hundred years at least, before the matter will be ripe for making of those utensils.

It seems very strange, that in all the precincts of <hi>Kiangsi</hi> there cannot any earth be found proper to make the same, but they are en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>forced to fetch it from the Province of <hi>Nanking,</hi> not far from the City of <hi>Hoeicheu,</hi> where nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther can they make it, which seems no less strange, though there the material abounds. Some attribute the cause thereof to the quality of the water, others to the quality of the wood, or temperature of the fire. But whatsoever it be, certain it is, that the Earth, whereof they make their <hi>Porcelain,</hi> is taken out of the mountains of <hi>Hoang,</hi> that environ the said City of <hi>Hoeicheu,</hi> where they form it into square lumps, of the weight of three <hi>Catteos</hi> [which make about four pounds of our weight, allowing sixteen ounces to the pound] and in value half a <hi>Condrin</hi> [or fifteen pence sterling] which are transported to <hi>Sinklesimo,</hi> and those other places they make it at, by ordinary Mariners, who for avoiding all such deceits, as are commonly incident to the carriage and selling of Comodities and Merchan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dize, are obliged to take an Oath not to imbezil any, at least those, that are marked with the Em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perours Arms. As to the nature of the Earth it is very meager or lean, but fine and shining like Sables, which they temper in water to reduce it into the fashion of those little square lumps. When likewise at any time the <hi>Porcelain</hi> breaks, they stamp and pound the broken pieces, and again make other utensils thereof, which never<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>theless have nothing of the lust<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">

            <p>That the Descendents of <hi>Cham</hi> were great Masters in the knowledg of Arts and Sciences, is not to be denied.

            <p>BUT first it will not be impertinent, to let you know, the manner observed by their Ancest<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ors of old, for the peopling and enlarging of their Dominions, whereby what ensueth will the more clearly be understood; and whereby they will be found not as the Off-springs of <hi>Cham</hi> and <hi>Iaphet,</hi> through the greedy thirst of prey, cruel desire of revenge, and sacred ambition of rule, to have usually invaded their confining neighbours. But by just and peaceable planta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions, to have setled themselves throughout the now <hi>China.</hi> For, as <hi>Martinius</hi> saith, It is not to <note place="margin">M.

For, as the first Planters thereof coming from the West, began to inhabit the Province of <hi>Xensi,</hi> in that part which lieth most towards the West, so the heads of their several families by degrees sought out new seats from thence. For, after the Province of <hi>Xensi,</hi>
               <pb n="118" facs="tcp:41214:66"/>
the next <hi>Hanan, Peking, Xantung</hi> began to be inhabited. Which Provinces Imperial Dominion being thence forward established among the <hi>Chinois,</hi> were all governed by a single person. The form of the Government was just all the Provinces which lay alongst the great river of <hi>Kiang</hi> towards the North, acknowledging one Emperour, and to his Authority and rule of their own voluntary accord subjecting themselves.</p>
            <p>But under <hi>Yuus,</hi> who was the third in succes<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sion from <hi>Iaus,</hi> and who brought the Empire to an hereditary Dominion; all those Countries also, that lie on the South of that River were surveyed, and Geographical descriptions made of them.

After this man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner then setting up new Kingdoms, the people being delighted with the vertue of their Princes, their inventing, instituting, and encouraging hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mane Arts, Husbandry especially, and others of the like kind, readily obeyed. Thus by degrees all <hi>China,</hi> farr and wide, in every part, as now, became to be inhabited; and as it was out of one body and one Off-spring peopled, so at length it grew into one body and form of Em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pire.</p>

their numbers multiplying, they began to look abroad, and after their usual custome by sending forth of Colonies planted the Peninsula of <hi>Corea,</hi> with the Island of <hi>Iapan,</hi> which glories of her descent from them; so <hi>Iava, Ceilan,</hi> or, as <hi>Mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinius</hi> observes, <hi>Sinlan</hi> rather, because first peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pled <note place="margin">M.

And not only these, but likewise most of the Oriental Islands are of their Plantation. For, having Shipping, and the use of the Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pass, whither might they not transport them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves?</p>
            <p>In the Continent likewise that <hi>Siam, Camboya,</hi> and the adjacent Regions drew their original from the <hi>Chinois</hi> is evident. From whence it pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceeds that they use the <hi>Chinique</hi> Letters, yea, and express the denominations of numbers, not by Figures but Characters, as the <hi>Chinois</hi> do.</p>
            <p>And I could almost be apt no longer to ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mire at the stately Structures of <hi>Mexico;</hi> or how <hi>Cusco</hi> came to be such a regular City; nor won<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der at the ingenuity, magnificence and govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of those people, seeing <hi>Martinius</hi> is dispo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed to conceive, that from <hi>China</hi> they had their <note place="margin">Id. lib. 8. pag. 358.</note> beginning also. I could be of opinion, saith he, that beyond <hi>Corea</hi> having with their Ships pene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trated the Straits of <hi>Anian</hi> likewise, the <hi>Chinois</hi> frequented <hi>America,</hi> that part especially which
<pb n="120" facs="tcp:41214:67"/>
lieth towards the West. And that, that people happily had their original from them. For their complexion, the manner of wearing their hair, and the Air of their faces, maketh it very proba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble to me, of certainty nevertheless I can say nothing thereof.</p>
            <p>But <hi>G. Hondius</hi> in his original of the <hi>Ameri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cans</hi> is confident of it, and by many rational ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guments very probably proves the same. For, as he saith, it must of necessity be, that such well <note place="margin">

Which polite people are asserted by him to be the <hi>Chinois.</hi> Now, in regard my discourse tends to another end, I shall unto what <hi>Hondius</hi> hath learnedly pleaded for them, in relation to those of <hi>Mexico,</hi> add only, that their publique minds, manner of Oratory, with their grave, succinct, and wise sayings, do in great likelihood confirm them to be originally extracted from <hi>China.</hi> The Architecture of the <hi>Mexicans,</hi> as also of the <hi>Peruvians,</hi> is by him much insisted upon; because for the stupendi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ousness and vast dimensions of the stones it e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>qually corresponds with the works of <hi>China,</hi> whereunto I shall likewise say, that whereas the ornaments of the Temple at <hi>Mexico,</hi> than which a more stately was scarcely ever seen, consisted chiefly of Dragons and Serpents, variously and with much ingenuity composed; it is manifest, that the Pagods and Regal Palaces in <hi>China,</hi> are
<pb n="121" facs="tcp:41214:67"/>
all with the same sort of enrichments, and in the same order generally adorned; the Dragon be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the Standard Royal of the <hi>Chinique</hi> Empire. That such like ornaments in buildings were used by other people, either in the East or elsewhere, I have not read in any Author, which hath of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tentimes made me very solicitous from whence the <hi>Mexicans</hi> should have them, they being grace<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful, great and noble, but I could never find it out, until the late histories of the <hi>Chinois</hi> came to my perusal, which have clearly satisfied me, that the manner of them is peculiarly proper to <hi>China,</hi> was brought from thence, and in memory and for the honour of that Monarchy continued by the <hi>Mexicans.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>As for <hi>Peru,</hi> whereas <hi>Hondius</hi> will have it to be peopled by the <hi>Chinois,</hi> transported thither under the conduct of <hi>Mango</hi> the first of the <hi>In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gas</hi> about four hundred years since, I conceive, they had discovered it, and therein setled them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves divers Ages before. For, although <hi>Mango</hi> with his followers might at that time to avoid the fury of a prevailing Enemy forsake his native Countrey, and landing in <hi>Peru,</hi> erect that Em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pire; nevertheless considering, that the <hi>Spaniards</hi> at their entrance, found the massive monuments there, to bear such a decayed <hi>Aspect,</hi> as that they demonstrated a far higher Antiquity, than the date assigned; and that it was ever customary with the <hi>Chinois,</hi> to send forth the surplusage of their numbers to shift for themselves, and seek out new habitations; such castlings might in their wandring throughout the South Sea (most of the Oriental Islands being formerly inhabited
<pb n="122" facs="tcp:41214:68"/>
by their Off-spring) fall with the coast of <hi>Peru,</hi> and finding it rich and delightful, possess them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves thereof, and settle there. until <hi>Mango</hi> with his company arrived, &amp; united them all under his own Sovereignty, as <hi>Hondius</hi> hath delivered.

            <p>The first War ever read of in the World was made in <hi>China,</hi> happening in the Province of <hi>Pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king,</hi> where, on the mountain <hi>Fan,</hi> near the City now called <hi>Yenking,</hi> their Emperour <hi>Xinnungus</hi> the Successor of <hi>Fobius,</hi> was, they say, slain about the year before the birth of CHRIST two thousand, six hundred, ninety seven; which ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to the Vulgar computation makes it be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore the flood about four hundred years. It was civil, and of this Kind I find many, and most bloody contests to have been amongst them; but managed with such Heroick valour, and strata<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gemical policy, as far surmounts all <hi>Macedonian, Punique,</hi> or any other known conduct in the World. These Wars proceeded principally from
<pb n="123" facs="tcp:41214:68"/>
the aspiring minds of the Royalets in the South<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ern Plantations, who were oftentimes many in one and the same Province, and ruled absolutely under the Sovereign, as so many petty Kings; though they paid Homage and Fealty to him, much according to the same manner, as Dukes and Earls do, for the estates they hold of the Empe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rours and Kings in <hi>Europe.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>But after they were by little &amp; little encreased in power, <hi>sumptis in affines armis</hi> taking up arms <note place="margin">M. Mart. Sin. hist. lib. 6. pag, 243.</note> against their own kinred and affinity, they troubled the whole Empire; out of Ambition chiefly to reduce the Province in which they governed, and were at first setled, under the immediate command of themselves, and their own issue without dependance upon a superiour. And sometimes moreover attempting to usurp upon the Monarchy it self; when either they found their Sovereign was but weak in Councel, or had dis-obliged his people; till in the end they were all brought under absolute subjection to the Monarch, and their Countries annexed to the Imperial Crown, as they are at this day</p>
            <p>But such civil disputes, you will happily say, could cause no change of Language, no more than the like contests did between <hi>Iudah</hi> and <hi>Israel,</hi> being they were intestine, and made a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mongst the Natives themselves of one Linage, and the same speech. For, it is not to be found that ever foreign forces, were by any the most ambitious of all Royalets called in, or when worsted invited to assist them with their Aides. And thus the <hi>Irish</hi> Tongue notwithstanding the Domestique wars, that almost perpetually suc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceeded
<pb n="124" facs="tcp:41214:69"/>
between the several Kings of that Island, in the times of old, and notwithstanding <hi>Danes, Norvegians,</hi> and <hi>Scots</hi> were frequently waged by them to oppose the prevailng party, remained uncorrupted, and so continueth at this present time. Now, though these examples, and several others of the like kind, may dictate to our reason, that by such wars, as these, their speech could not be altered; nevertheless I must say, that you will find, what through their long continuance, sometimes without intermission for three hun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dred years together, what through the living of the people without restraint in the mean while, and becoming by Degrees thereby as rude and barbarous, as the Regions they inhabited were rough and mountainous, these civil discords in <hi>China,</hi> did produce some difference in the Language of these Provinces, where the greatest fury of the war fell. But what this difference is, and in what Provinces it doth differ, and in which without change or alteration it remains pure and perfect, we shall in its proper place, not forget, particularly to remember.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Heylin</hi> affirmeth, that it is not lawful for the King of <hi>China</hi> to make any war but meerly De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fensive; and so, saith he, they enjoy a perpetual <note place="margin">Heyl. Cosm. Pag. 886.</note> peace. For, in regard war is equally destructive to the victors and vanquished, Princes, People, Treasure being alwayes consumed thereby; the <hi>Chinois</hi> are of opinion, That nothing is more unworthy their Emperour, than to enter into armes unconstrained; nothing more inglorious, than to seek for glory in the slaughter of his subjects; nor more inhumane, than men by men
<pb n="125" facs="tcp:41214:69"/>
to be cut in pieces. And hence without doubt it is, <hi>Trigantius</hi> tells us, that although he searched <note place="margin">N. Trig. de Christ. Exp. apud Sin. lib. 1. p. 59.</note> diligently into their Annals, from four thousand years unto his time to inform himself what fo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rein conquests had been made by them, yet he could never find mention made of any: and that though oftentimes also, he seriously discoursed with divers of their <hi>Literati</hi> about them, they all resolved him, that they never made, nor ever had been inclined to make any such. And there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore we are not to wonder, that we hear so little of their invasions; For, the wars excepted, which <hi>Martinius</hi> by a more full and free liberty of study, hath of late found out to have been undertaken by their Emperours <hi>Chingus</hi> and <hi>Hiarouus</hi> their History, as to such expeditions, appears to be very silent.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Chingus</hi> sirnamed <hi>Xius</hi> was the first that by general consent was declared supreme Monarch of all <hi>China;</hi> and the first Emperour of the Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mily of <hi>Cina;</hi> from whence <hi>Martinius</hi> conceives the name <hi>China</hi> originally proceeded. This Prince having compelled several <hi>Royalets</hi> of the southern Provinces to submit wholly to his obedience, and thereby wonderfully enlarged the <hi>Chinique</hi> Empire; extended his arms into remote parts, and both by sea and land over-ran all <hi>India,</hi> as far as <hi>Bengala, Scori,</hi> and <hi>Camboya.</hi> At which time being about two hundred and forty years before CHRIST the name and same of the <hi>Chinois</hi> first became known unto forein Nations, to their adjoining neighbours the <hi>Indians</hi> especially; among whom it after<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards stuck, and from them the <hi>Portugals</hi> at
<pb n="126" facs="tcp:41214:70"/>
their atchievements in <hi>India</hi> gained intelligence of <hi>China.</hi> He made war upon the <hi>Tartars</hi> like<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wise, and by his victories in a short time enforced them to abandon their habitations, and fly into the more remote Regions of the North for safety.</p>
            <p>And this <hi>Chingus</hi> it was, that to secure his <note place="margin">Id. pag. 238 A. Kirch. Ch. Ill. par. 5. pag. 217.</note> Empire from the eruptions of that people; e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rected that stupendious and wonderful work of the wall touched on before. This wall beginning at the sea-coast in <hi>Leotung,</hi> extendeth through <hi>China</hi> unto <hi>Lyncao</hi> a City of <hi>Xensi,</hi> scited on the banks of the river <hi>Croceus;</hi> and except where opposed by the horrid and inaccessible moun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tains encloseth not one, but four entire Provin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces, or Kingdoms rather, within its circuit. The whole length of it, the windings according to the different scituation of the places considered; for on this side of <hi>China</hi> in regard of the moun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tains level ground appears very rarely, is three hundred <hi>German</hi> Leagues, or twelve hundred <hi>English</hi> miles (accounting as <hi>Martinius</hi> doth fifteen <hi>German</hi> Leagues to a degree) being for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tified with Castles and Towers in convenient places, with Ports near them to issue forth as necessity requires. The heigth of it is thirty Cubits, the bredth twelve and sometimes fifteen, (the <hi>Chinique</hi> cubit being less than our foot by one only eigth part of an inch) having a Parapet on each side, for the greater security of those that pass thereon. In the building thereof three of ten of the people throughout the whole Em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pire were continually employed in course for five years together, and whosoever made any
<pb n="127" facs="tcp:41214:70"/>
part of it, that a wedg of iron might be thrust into the joynts of the stones, was for his negli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gence immediately put to death. The foundation of that end of it, which runs into the Sea at <hi>Leotung</hi> was made by sinking of Ships two fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>longs deep into the waves, loaden not with stone, but massive iron, as it was digged out of the Mine. It is built of great squared Asteler on the outside, the Core being filled up with flints; was erected in the two hundred and fifteenth year before the birth of CHRIST; and at this very day contemning all injuries of <hi>Time,</hi> re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mains in a manner without any fissure or setling. For the defence of it the Emperours of <hi>China</hi> do almost alwayes keep ten hundred thousand men in continual pay. Thus <hi>Martinius</hi> in his <hi>Atlas</hi> of <hi>China,</hi> as I find him truly cited by <hi>Kircherus.</hi>

            <p>The other <hi>Hiavouur,</hi> the sixth Emperour of the Family of <hi>Hana,</hi> is no less famous for his Love to learning, and learned men, than for his Mag<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nanimity <note place="margin">M.

               </gap>st some of the Royalets might, during the absence of himself and forces, attempt to raise new stirs, as since his family began to reign they had; he devised several Laws to restrain them. Ordaining, that for the furure the Lands grant<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed them in right of favour by the former Impe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rial Decrees, should at their deaths be equally di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vided, as in <hi>Gavel-kind,</hi> amongst their children lawfully begotten; whereby in time they became reduced to such penury, as utterly disabled them,
<pb n="128" facs="tcp:41214:71"/>
either to maintain the dignity of their Ancestors, or practise against their Sovereigns, as antiently they had done. He ordained also, that upon the Decease of any of them without lawful Issue, their lands should escheat unto the Crown from whence they had originally been alienated.</p>
            <p>Having then by these and the like constituti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons provided for the safety of his Empire at home, he resolved upon Wars abroad, and by his Lieutenants subdued many Kingdoms of <hi>In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dia,</hi> to the <hi>Chinique</hi> Empire, in that part especi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally which lyeth towards the South from <hi>Ganges</hi> inclusive to the Kingdom of <hi>Bengala.</hi> But taking afterwards the field in his own person, he brought under his Dominion <hi>Pegu,</hi> the Kingdom of the <hi>Laios,</hi> with <hi>Camboya, Cothin-China,</hi> and many other Countries and Islands. And to vindicate himself and Subjects upon <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">
                  <desc>•…</desc>
               </gap>ste <hi>Tartars,</hi> that were their antient and natural Enemies, and ever ready upon all advantages to infest their borders, as the <hi>Scots</hi> sometimes did ours in hope of spoile; invaded their Countries with three mighty Armies conducted by his Generals; and having put them almost all to the sword, and made about the year before CHRIST one hundred and twenty an absolute Conquest of them even to the North-sea, divided <hi>Cathay</hi> a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mongst his Captains and souldiers in recompence of their valour.</p>
            <p>But these by little and little in long tract of time forgetting the manners and customs of <hi>Chi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>na,</hi> by perpetual commerce and conversation with the <hi>Tartars</hi> degenerated, and took up their customes; so that in the end, though nevertheless
<pb n="129" facs="tcp:41214:71"/>
after many Centuries of years, they began to in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vade their native Countrey. For about the year of our Redemption twelve hundred and six, till when (such ordinary commotions excepted as usually attend great Monarchies) the <hi>Chinois</hi> had lived in continual peace and tranquillity these <hi>Cathaians</hi> conquered <hi>China.</hi> But how?

For, instead of compelling the <hi>Chinois</hi> whilst they had them under obedience to submit to their Laws and Customs, they themselves submitted to the Rites and Manners of those, whom they had for that time subject<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed; applying diligently themselves to understand and learn, the Language, Conditions, Arts, and Manufactures of the <hi>Chinois,</hi> which at their expulsion they carried into <hi>Cathay</hi> with them. As the <hi>Romans</hi> did the <hi>Greek</hi> tongue into <hi>Italy,</hi> after the Conquest of <hi>Greece;</hi> and as by their victories in <hi>Asia</hi> (the difference alwaies between civility and riot considered) they brought to <hi>Rome</hi> Effiminacy, Luxury, Prodigality, which were in use chiefly in that Countrey.</p>
            <p>This was the most severe misfortune, that ever till that time befel the <hi>Chinois,</hi> after the prescription of so many hundreds of Ages to an indisturbed felicity, considering nevertheless that the <hi>Cathayans</hi> had a desire by their industrious recovery of them, to maintain the Arts and Sciences of their Progenitors, it could not pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duce
<pb n="130" facs="tcp:41214:72"/>
any great alteration in the manners of the <hi>Chinois,</hi> much less in their MOTHER Tongue.</p>
            <p>Here again we may observe; that as the <hi>Isra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>elites</hi> from their first coming into the land of <hi>Canaan,</hi> lived in the height of all prosperity, saving some civil contentions hapning between those of <hi>Iudah</hi> and her fellow Tribes, never knew what the fury of a Conquerour meant, till after they had overwhelmed themselves in Ido<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>latry: So the <hi>Chinois</hi> from their first beginning to be a people, having lived in all worldly happi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness, the like intestine broiles between their families excepted, never understood what the rage of a forein victor imported, till they also had drowned themselves in the worship of Idols. Both famous Examples, that innovations in Religion are alwaies attended with dreadful judgments.</p>
            <p>But let us not omit the accompt, which <hi>Mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinius</hi> 
               <note place="margin">M. Mart. Bell. Tart. pag. 1. fol.</note> gives concerning this Invasion. In this tract of time the Western <hi>Tartars</hi> forgetting their antient vigour of mind, and warlike spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rits, which the pleasures and delights of <hi>China</hi> had mollified, being also weakned by so long a peace, became of a sweeter temper, and received a deep tincture of the Nature and disposition of the Natives of that Countrey. But though I find him thus rendred into <hi>English,</hi> hearken to him nevertheless in his own words. <hi>Interea Sinicis deliciis fracti, Sinicos induerunt mores, &amp; paulatim fortitudinem Tartaricam dediscentes, nimiâ debi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>litati pace, Sinae evaserunt;</hi> So that you see the <hi>Tartars</hi> became <hi>Chinois,</hi> not the <hi>Chinois, Tartars;</hi>

his surviving General called in the <hi>Nieuchean Tartars</hi> to his assistance; who shortly after set<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting up for themselves, crowned Emperour of <hi>China, Xunchius</hi> a child of about six years of Age, the son of <hi>Zungteus</hi> King of <hi>Niuche;</hi> which <hi>Zungteus</hi> from his infancy had secretly and un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>known been brought up in <hi>China;</hi> where to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether with their weaknesses, he had learned the manners, sciences, doctrine, Letters and Language of the inhabitants; wherefore he much loved, and was no less beloved again by all the <hi>Chinois.</hi> Whose miseries endured in this War, from their own Countrimen the Rebels especially, as in all places it evermore happens where Rebellion once gets the upperhand, are almost inexpressable.</p>
            <p>But how calamitous soever their condition was, manifest it is<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> that they received no pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>judice in their MOTHER Tongue or Learn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of old. For the <hi>Tartars</hi> upon subjecting and setling the <hi>China</hi> Empire under their own dominion, neither altered the Policy, nor an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tient form of government; but permitted their <hi>Literati</hi> to govern the Towns and Provinces as before, and left unto them the promotions, and examinations of their Characters, as formerly they were accustomed to enjoy.

this in part at least the <hi>Hebrews</hi> were command<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed to observe, for the same reason also. For whensoever any Nation or People, by intro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ducing new, alter their antient customs, the destruction of that People or Nation not far off approacheth. Thus the Commonwealth of <hi>Rome</hi> by taking up prodigality and voluptuousness, instead of her antient temperance and sobriety, lost her liberty. And thus the <hi>Chinois</hi> themselves, as you shall shortly hear, became subject to the <hi>Tartars.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Howbeit it seemeth, that the extreme jealousy of their customes is not the sole cause of these restraints, but least by permitting liberty of In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tercourse the wealth and weakness of their Empire should be discovered; for though their conquests and civil broiles renders them <hi>essere stata gente bellicosa, è di valore,</hi> (to use <hi>Semedo's</hi> words) to have been antiently a valiant and <note place="margin">Id. part. i. cap. 20,</note> warlike Nation; now nevertheless, by their surfeiting on continual peace, and long enjoy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of all variety of pleasures, no people under heaven the like, they are become generally effi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minate; and in regard no preferment is to be hoped for, but by becoming excellent in their learning, they all unanimously, as it were, apply themselves to the study thereof. So that the soldiery are no otherwise accompted of with them, than the basest sort of people are with us.</p>
            <p>But in regard whatever is prohibited, is com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monly most desired; strangers, their Laws not<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>withstanding, found out a way to creep in amongst them. For considering that upon an Embassy made by the <hi>Tartars</hi> about the year
<pb n="138" facs="tcp:41214:76"/>
forty eight before CHRIST, in tender of their perpetual submission to the <hi>Chinique</hi> Empire, Embassadors might be received; several people under the pretence of the like addresses have oftentimes since gained admittance into the Countrey, and made some trading therein, pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vately nevertheless, and not otherwise, as <hi>Marti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nius</hi> 
               <note place="margin">M. Mart. Sin. Hist. lib. 2. p. 65.</note> informs us. For whereas <hi>China,</hi> saith he, is so shut up against strangers, that no access is easily allowed to any, saving Embassadors; <hi>Turks, Laios, Samarchandians,</hi> and those of <hi>Tibeth</hi> by land, and the <hi>Siamites</hi> with <hi>Camboyans</hi> by sea, come into <hi>China;</hi> where, under colour of Em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bassy, they negotiate private commerce. Observe herewith what <hi>Nieuhoff</hi> relateth; No man can <note place="margin">I. Nieuh. l' Amb. Or. par. 2. p. 8.</note> enter <hi>China</hi> except Embassadors, unless with resolution to end his dayes therein, so strong is the opinion of this people, who for many Ages have been perswaded, that they shall be betrayed and sold to some forein Prince. They cannot traffique with their neighbours without licence from their Emperours; and if they be necessi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tated to send Embassadors into other Kingdoms, they hardly find any that will undertake the charge; and whosoever accepts the same, is no more or less lamented or bewailed by his Rela<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions, than if he were going to his grave. So hateful is the knowledg of strange countries, and conversation with strangers to them. Either they know not forein Nations, or contemn them, Saith <hi>Martinius.</hi>

            <p>But the <hi>Chinois</hi> considering, that these Em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bassies are but feigned, and that to espy and corrupt them rather, than for any submission

or amities sake such addresses are made, give them reception accordingly (as from <hi>Martinius, Semedo, Trigautius,</hi> and several misfives of their Society we have collected) after this manner. So soon as the Embassador either by land enters upon their confines, or from sea puts in to any of their ports, a guard is set immediatly upon him, by which (some few being allowed for his splendour and ostentation sake to accompany him) he is brought unto the next <hi>Mandarine;</hi> who, the place from whence he came known, assignes him to the Pallace for him, and his Retinue to reside in, placing good guards upon them, least any should enter or come forth with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out his licence, all manner of necessaries, aswel for provisions as carriages, how long soever they stay within the Countrey, being provided for them at the publique charge. The <hi>Mandarine</hi> takes a memorial also of their goods, which with incredible expedition by a Currier (for at every ten furlongs <hi>Chinois,</hi> which make some<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>what less than three of our <hi>English</hi> miles, they continually place one) is sent to the Emperour at his Court, with the name of the Embassadour, from what Countrey and Prince he comes, what number of followers attends him, and what Presents and other things he brings; signifying likewise the great desire that the Embassadour hath to make his address unto the Imperial Court. If by the precise day, according to the limitation in their laws, no answer appeareth from the Emperour, then the Embassadour is presently sent away again <hi>re infecta.</hi> But if the Emperour granteth his access, then the <hi>Manda<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rine</hi>
               <pb n="140" facs="tcp:41214:77"/>
takes great care, that not any of them be suffered to pass into the inner parts of the Em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pire, but directly to the place where the Empe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rour resideth; and therefore sends him and his Attendants unto the next <hi>Mandarine,</hi> under guards nevertheless like Captives, though time out of mind they have been their Friends and Allies, not permitting them to see any thing, much less converse with any man throughout their whole journey; and at nights, like brute beasts in stables, they are, under I know not how many locks and keys, shut up in the Palaces appointed for them to lodg in. And thus they are conducted from <hi>Mandarine</hi> to <hi>Mandarine</hi> after the same manner (as we pass beggars in <hi>England</hi> from one Constable to another) until they arrive where the Emperour resides. Where commonly after some short attendance, the Embassadour is led, not before the Emperour, for he neither seeth, nor speaketh with him; but the Councel of <hi>Rites:</hi> who by the Royal order treat with him, and receiving his Presents give him his dispatch; and of the rest of his Mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chandize which he brought, if the Emperour desireth any thing, he sendeth to see and buy it. At his departure the Embassadour is rewarded with much more in value by far than he pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sented. This done, and returning to his Palace, power is given him to vend the remainders of his goods, which either himself or those with him, brought with them to the Court; or left behind at the place where the rest of their com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pany, or Caravan rather, as may be said, were kept at their first coming to the Countrey. For,
<pb n="141" facs="tcp:41214:77"/>
in regard they come but rarely, their numbers are usually very great; but these are not per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitted to enter within the Empire, but for their abode have some Villages assigned them with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out the Wall; where having sold their own wares, they may buy others likewise, so that they do it in presence of their guards. And when at length they have made sale of their commo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dities, and ended their whole Trade, the Em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bassadour and his company being conveyed to them, in the like manner as they went from them at first, they all return very richly laden to their own Countries again, though by their <hi>Commerce</hi> not any thing the wiser for intelli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gence, nor the <hi>Chinois</hi> one <hi>Iota</hi> the worser either in their form of Government or Language.</p>
            <p>But it may be now demanded, what needeth all this Policy, this circumspection, or why such peremptory Laws against the admission of strangers? When Nature her self seemeth to have so provided for them, as if she had decreed they should never have been so much as known, or discovered to the rest of the World, or seen by them rather, much less molested with inva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sions, or corrupted with the access of foreiners.

<pb n="142" facs="tcp:41214:78"/>
unfaithful harbours, as that without manifest shipwrack, what through the violence and cruelty of the winds, what through the most impetuous ebbings and flowings of the sea, the shores are scarcely approachable. And least from the <hi>West</hi> any should obtain entrance, behold Nature hath obstructed the passes and avenues that way into it, with an unapproachable, inaccessible, and to this day impenetrable enclosure of mountains, harbouring so many, &amp; such cruelly wild Beasts, and deadly stinging Serpents, as that, with a certain body as it were of garrison souldiers, she hath so armed it, as from this part no mor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tal man can ever hope for passage.</p>

And about this I shall no longer detain you, than that I may therewith bring my discourse conveniently to a period. Not that language I mean of the Southern and other Colonies, which by nursing up the people in barbarity, through the ambi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tious negligence of the <hi>Royalets,</hi> is differently pronounced, and from whence it comes to be said, that many Provinces in <hi>China</hi> have a dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferent speech. But their true MOTHER and NATURAL Tongue, which from all Ages hath been used by them in their first plantations, and antient Demeasns of the Crown, and which by their Characters originally composed to the same, is spoken genuinely perfect unto this day. <hi>Trigautius</hi> and <hi>Semedo</hi> call it <hi>Quonhoa,</hi> or the language of the <hi>Mandarines</hi> in regard of the Elegancy, and commodiousness thereof; <hi>Mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinius</hi> the language of the <hi>Literati,</hi> not so much because the pronunciation of it is learned by the Natives from their Cradles, as is by some con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived; but for that it is spoken purely and elegantly over all <hi>China</hi> by their learned men, according to their written Characters.</p>

            <p>And since we are to carry on our Essay in an Historical manner only, we think it improper to launch forth into any other kind of proofes whatsoever, though (by the way) you are to understand, that whatever arguments of worth are produced by any Authors for any language to prove the primativeness thereof, may probably much more agree to this; of which we shall have occasion to say somewhat more hereafter. And if we should say, that the learned Author
<pb n="146" facs="tcp:41214:80"/>
of the Philosophical Language lately published hath founded his <hi>Notions</hi> chiefly on the <hi>Principles</hi> of <hi>This,</hi> we should not happily say amiss; though for the form of his Character, he hath followed rather the <hi>Gothique</hi> or <hi>Runique</hi> of old.</p>
            <p>THAT the World and Letters are eternal, <hi>Pliny</hi> is of opinion. Now, if thereby he meant, that Letters are as antient as the World, his meaning, perhaps, might not be far from Truth. But, that Language or speech, was, before the World had form; the Scripture warrants. For, we read; <hi>Dixit, &amp; factum est,</hi> not <hi>factum est &amp; dixit:</hi> God said before he created, not, created before he said. Which sheweth, saith <hi>Ainsworth,</hi> how God created things by his <hi>word;</hi> saying, <note place="margin">Alnsw. in Gen. 1.</note> and it was; commanding, and it was created; <hi>Psal. 33. v.</hi> 6, 9. and 148. <hi>v.</hi> 5. So that if we are to understand the Text, <hi>Gen. 1. v.</hi> 3. according to the Letter as he doth; Speech was before either things, or creatures were made; and consequent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly is, of more divine Antiquity, than either the world or men.</p>
            <p>That the PRIMITIVE Language was not a studied or artificial speech, nor taught our <hi>First Parents</hi> by Art and by degrees as their Generations have been, but concreated with them, is certain. For, we read that God no soon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er questioned <hi>Adam,</hi> then <hi>Adam</hi> answered him. <hi>And the Lord God called unto Adam, and said unto him, Where art thou? And he said I heard thy voice in the garden, and I was afraid, because I was naked, and I hid my self.</hi> Gen. 3. v. 9, 10. Where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by we are assured, that as the Creation of man himself was admirably perfect; so his language
<pb n="147" facs="tcp:41214:80"/>
was originally plain and meek; nothing of that being found in either, which necessity afterwards compelled the posterity of the Conspirators at <hi>Babel,</hi> for their greater reputation to stile Art; because God having given them over to them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves, they had no other way left to compose and regulate their Actions, then what either their ingenuity or experience by enforced and premeditated means afforded them. And seing it is presumed that <hi>Adam</hi> by his creation knew whatever might be advantagious for mankind; I see no reason but we may conceive, that the first Characters, that were ever framed to language were of his invention; for, that they were found out in the very infancy of the world, is, saith <note place="margin">Sir W. Ral<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> hist. par. 1. pag. 67.</note> Sir <hi>W. Raleigh</hi> questionless, and the World was never more an Infant, than in the daies of <hi>Adam.</hi> He that gave names to all things, knew best how to invent Characters for all things, whereby in their proper natures, those names should be communicated and continued to his Off-spring. In like manner, having letters there is no doubt to be made, but that they had books also; for some part of the books of <hi>Enoch,</hi> containing the course of the stars, their names and motions, is said to be found after the flood in <hi>Arabia Faelix,</hi> within the dominion of the Queen of <hi>Saba</hi> (saith <hi>Origen,</hi> as <hi>loco citato</hi> quoted by our Histo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rian) of which <hi>Tertullian</hi> affirmeth, that he had seen and read some whole pages. And as little question there is to be made, but that the letters with which in stone and brick either <hi>Seth</hi> or <hi>E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>noch,</hi> or both engraved the <hi>Secretiora</hi> of their inventions, were significative and hieroglyphi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cal;
<pb n="148" facs="tcp:41214:81"/>
such we may say, as were invented by <hi>Adam</hi> for the benefit of them and their posterity. For, though in several Authors we find they used Letters; yet that they or either of them first found them out appears not in any Author. Seing then, they are only said to be the first that made use of them, whereby it is manifest they followed but a former president, the glory of the invention remaines absolutely unto <hi>Adam,</hi> unless any man will go about to yeeld the honour thereof to <hi>Cain,</hi> or the first of his issue, before either <hi>Seth</hi> or <hi>Enoch</hi> was born. And though this may per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>haps <note place="margin">Dr. Brow. Pseud. Epi. l. 5. p, 223.</note> seem singular, Doctor <hi>Brown</hi> nevertheless much inclines thereto; for, having told us, that many conceive Hieroglyphicks were the <hi>Primi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tive</hi> way of writing, and of greater Antiquity than Letters, and that thereby the Language consisting of things they spake unto each other by common notions of Nature, he concludes saying, <q>This indeed might <hi>Adam</hi> well have spoken, who understanding the nature of things, had the advantage of natural expres<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sions.</q>

            <p>If then aswel before the flood, as long after it, significative Characters only were in use; for without all peradventure that famous Inscripti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on at <hi>Persepolis</hi> in <hi>Persia</hi> consists of such Cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>racters; and although it differs, its true from the received Hieroglyphical way, being composed of the form of Triangles several wayes trans<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verted only. Yet we cannot but allow, in regard the people in those early dayes framed the Characters to their Language correspondent to the fancy of their imaginations; but that they must be made according to the more or less ingenuity of the People that so framed them. And should it be objected that this Inscription seems so to exceed all Antiquity, that some
<pb n="150" facs="tcp:41214:82"/>
suppose it may be written before the flood; it may be answered, that though the world then had but one <hi>Common language;</hi> nevertheless according to the divers humours, and capacities of the People, as hath been said, for they could not be all alike ingenious, the then <hi>Characters</hi> might not be general but doubtless different. For, the <hi>Language</hi> was of God, who is not given to mutability; the <hi>Characters</hi> were of men, that are wholy inclined to variety.</p>
            <p>And if until the dayes of <hi>Moses,</hi> Alphabetary Letters were not known, which by violence of Conquerours, mixture with forein Nations, liberty of Commerce, long tract of time, desire of Novelty, and s<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">
                  <desc>•…</desc>
               </gap>veral other waies are aptly disposed to alteration and corruption. In vain do we search for the PRIMITIVE Language to remain with those Nations whose Languages consist in Alphabets. For it cannot in reason be imagined, that Letters could be brought at first into such a studied order, and methodical way; but accidentally as it were at random invented after a plain and simple manner, conformable to the speech; as all other Arts from small be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginnings and ruder notions have grown to perfection in time and by degrees; many Ages and long experience being required to perfect any invention of whatever kind. And if those Inscriptions reported by <hi>Pomponius Mela,</hi> and <hi>Pliny</hi> to have been found at <hi>Ioppa,</hi> witnessing that <note place="margin">Pom. Mela lib. l. cap. 11. Plin. lib. 5. cap. 13.</note> it was built before the flood; and that <hi>Cepheus</hi> or <hi>Ceheus</hi> reigned there, and on which were in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>graven the titles of him, and his brother <hi>Phi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>n<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">

<pb n="151" facs="tcp:41214:82"/>
and principles of their Religion, had been com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>municated to posterity in the proper Character, nothing could have more assured us hereof. For, our learned <hi>Selden</hi> used to profess, that for adjustation of time and action, he more valued one Antique Inscription, than an hundred arguments of the Schooles. Wherefore it is much to be lamented, that those worthy Gentle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men both of our own Nation and others, that at such hazard and charge have travailed into the remote parts of <hi>Asia,</hi> from whence all An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiquity is derived; have neglected to exemplifie some at least of those many Inscriptions, which remain frequently dispersed in that part of the World, and which are such, if what hath been related to me be true, as that they will very probably confute several Pretenders to this Title. But not intending to dispute of this;</p>
            <p>Certain it is, that there hath hardly been ever any People so barbarous, or Nation so unciviliz<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, which to manifest their Couceptions amongst themselves; have not had their Characters either in a significative or Alphabetary manner as the experience of times and places teach us. By the Alphabetary kind, as with us, and other nati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, aswel in the East, as other parts of the World, the Vulgar come vulgarly to know whatever action is performed: But by the signi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficative, those especially I mean, that involved mystically the whole conception of some certain matter, the Vulgar came to know nothing, but what vulgarly befitted them for to know.</p>
            <p>Thus, not to mention others. the <hi>Aegyptians, Brachmanes,</hi> and <hi>Runians</hi> of old, made use of
<pb n="152" facs="tcp:41214:83"/>
Hieroglyphicks to keep their <hi>Arcana Theologiae &amp; Imperii</hi> sealed up, as it were, in the breasts of their Priests and Ministers of State only, And thus the <hi>Chin is</hi> invented their first Characters, and formed them from all things that are obvi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous to sight; as Beasts, Birds, Wor<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">

Threads, Points, Circles, and the like; with this diffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rence nevertheless, that whereas the <hi>Aegyptians,</hi> and the rest invented their Hieroglyphicks to conceale their <hi>Arcana</hi> from the people; the <hi>Chinois</hi> on the contrary framed their Characters to communicate their <hi>Concepta</hi> to the people. For, as the Characters of <hi>These</hi> were invented for declaring precisely the conceptiors of single words, and names only, no other mystery being included in them: So, the Hieroglyphicks of <hi>Those</hi> did not express single words or names, but <note place="margin">Id. p. 234.</note> involved aenigmatically entire <hi>Ideal</hi> conceptions. Whereby the difference between t<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">

               </gap>e Hiero<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>glyphicks of the <hi>Aegyptians</hi> and Characters of the <hi>Chinois,</hi> is evident; and that they are not <hi>in omnibus aemuli,</hi> as <hi>Kircherus</hi> would perswade. But with what other differences are between them, or whether in any manner they may seem to correspond, we intend not now either to trouble you, or our selves.</p>
            <p>THE Inventour of the first Characters of <note place="margin">I. Nieuh. l Amb. Or. par. 2. pag. 105.</note> 
               <hi>Chind,</hi> was <hi>Fohius</hi> their first Emperour, who according to the time that is given to the begin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning of his reign might be contemporary with <hi>Enos.</hi> For, as hath been said, <hi>Martinius</hi> and <hi>Vossius</hi> affirm, that the Historical computation <note place="margin">M. Mart. Sin. Hist. lib. 1. p. 22.</note> of the <hi>Chinois</hi> begins from that year wherein
<pb n="153" facs="tcp:41214:83"/>
               <hi>Fohius</hi> entred upon his government, which was in the two thousand eight hundred forty seventh year before the birth of CHRIST. Now that year before the birth of CHRIST answers to the five hundred fifty third year before the De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>luge, and <hi>Enos</hi> died in the year of the World eleven hundred and forty, which preceded the flood five hundred and sixteen years, whereby <hi>Fohius</hi> might be contemporary with <hi>Enos</hi> thirty seven years, according to the <hi>Chinois</hi> historical accompt, and as by our vulgar Chronology is evident. The most accurate Chronography of <note place="margin">Is. Voss. de Aetat. mun. p. 18,</note> the <hi>Chinois,</hi> by the calculation of <hi>Moses,</hi> precedes the deluge seaven or eight Ages; saith <hi>Vossius.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>But I find <hi>Xircherus</hi> very much to dissent here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>from. For, he saith, that the <hi>Chinois</hi> as from <note place="margin">A. Kirc. Ch. Ill. par. 6. pag. 225.</note> their Annals and Chronography may be collect<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, place the first invention of their Letters almost three hundred years after the Deluge, of which their first King, <hi>Fohius</hi> by name, was the first Institutor; as by the book of the suc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cession of their Kings appears.</p>
            <p>Now, this variance ariseth, because <hi>Kircherus</hi> for his calculation useth not the same <hi>Europaean,</hi> but a different Chronology from the rest. For whereas <hi>Trigautius, Martinius, Semedo,</hi> with <hi>Nieuhoff,</hi> deduce their computation from the vulgar <hi>Aera</hi> of CHRIST, by which according to the original <hi>Hebrew</hi> Text, the flood hapned in the year of the World one thousand six hund<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red fifty six; <hi>Kircherus</hi> on the contrary takes his from the <hi>Aera</hi> asserted by <hi>Isaac Vossius,</hi> whereby according to the <hi>Seventy,</hi> the flood is made to happen in the year of the World two
<pb n="154" facs="tcp:41214:84"/>
thousand two hundred fifty six; the difference being six hundred years. And by this compu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation indeed, we shall find, that the first Letters of the <hi>Chineis</hi> came to be invented by <hi>Fohius</hi> two hundred forty four years before the <hi>Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fusion of Tongues;</hi> and consequently not much less than three hundred years after the Deluge, as <hi>Kircherus</hi> hath alleged, the precise time being two hundred eighty seven years. For <hi>Vossius</hi> to make good his Chronology affirms, that the dispersion at <hi>Babel</hi> succeeded at the birth of <hi>Phaleg,</hi> which, saith he, was five hundred thirty one years after the Flood: <hi>Quam factam esse</hi> 
               <note place="margin">Is. Vossius de Aetat. Mun. pag. 47.</note> 
               <hi>diximus ante &amp; post nativitatem</hi> Phalegi <hi>annis post diluvium</hi> 531. being his words.</p>
            <p>But although by this it more than manifestly appeareth, that <hi>China</hi> had letters, and was planted two hundred forty four years before the <hi>Babylonian Confusion,</hi> and that thereby the <hi>Chinois</hi> could not be obnoxious to the curse of <hi>Confounded Languages;</hi> nevertheless (except their Letters, as <hi>Semedo</hi> conceiveth, were born with them, and together with their Theology, taught them by <hi>Noah)</hi> that also they were a people, and consequently had a Language, long before they could have letters in use, reason must grant, and <hi>Vossius</hi> will not deny. For he informeth us, That his <hi>Serians,</hi> (our <hi>Chinois)</hi> in their Annals record, that in the more antient <note place="margin">Id. pag. 48.</note> times which both preceded, and immediately succeeded the universal Deluge, their Countrey was inhabited, though they will not for certain affirm the same, but willingly rather acknowledg their errour therein. But if in them it be an
<pb n="155" facs="tcp:41214:84"/>
errour, then is <hi>Vossius</hi> himself most eminently guilty of the same errour. For, he hath long since delivered his judgment, that by his calcu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lation, the <hi>Chinique</hi> deluge corresponds exactly with the flood of <hi>Noah.</hi> But unless <hi>China</hi> were peopled, it could not, according to his own po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sition be drowned. For, with great vehemency he disputes, that those Countries that were not inhabited, perished not in the Deluge. Hear him, <hi>Ut vero diluvii inundationem ultra orbis</hi> 
               <note place="margin">I. Voss. de Aetat. Mun. pag. 54.</note> 
               <hi>habitati terminos producamus, nulla jubet ratio, imo prorsus absurdum dicere, ubi nullae hominum caedes, illic etiam viguisse effectus poenae solis homi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nibus inflictae;</hi> But that we should draw, saith he, the Inundation of the Deluge without the limits of the habitable Earth, no reason enjoyns, yea verily, it is absurd to say, that where men had no habitations, there also the effect of the punishment, inflicted on men only, should take place. So that his argument stands thus; That Countrey which was not peopled, was not drowned by the flood; But <hi>China</hi> he himself affirms was drowned by the flood; Therefore <hi>China</hi> according to his own affirmation was peopled before the flood. Either then the <hi>Chi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nois</hi> are not in an errour for so recording, or <hi>Vossius</hi> is in an errour for so affirming. But <hi>China</hi> without all peradventure was inhabited besore the flood, and consequently drowned, and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore both the <hi>Chinois</hi> and <hi>Vossius</hi> are in the right. And he himself hath furthermore and very lately acknowledged, That the Chronology of <hi>China,</hi> by the <hi>Mosaical</hi> accompt, precedes the flood seven or eight Ages.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="156" facs="tcp:41214:85"/>
Mark nevertheless I pray, how learnedly in thus disputing of the Deluge, <hi>Vossius</hi> occultly pleads the very case of those plantations, that were setled before the Conspiracy at <hi>Babel,</hi> and how those that were absent thence could not be guilty of the Crime committed there<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> nor liable therefore to the punishment ensuing there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>upon.</p>
            <p>Now although, which of these two compu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tations, are, according to the letter of the Scripture most warrantable, I will nor presume to argue; yet nevertheless what our <hi>Mede</hi> and others have delivered concerning them, I am not to decline. <q>We know, saith he, the first <note place="margin">I. Mede lib. <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">

                     </gap>5. pag. 1094. 1095.</note> Ages of the Church followed the computation of the seventy altogether, though it were most wide of truth; and the chiefest Doctors the Church then had, through ignorance of the <hi>Hebrew,</hi> for a long time knew not, or believed not, there was any other computation.</q> He also adds, that the great difference which is found between these Chronologies proceedeth chiefly, because the <hi>Seventy</hi> translating in <hi>Aegypt,</hi> voluntarily and of set purpose, increased the years of the first generations, to make them reach the Antiquity of some stories of the <hi>Aegyptians,</hi> and thereby exceeded the <hi>Hebrew</hi> computation, above thirteen hundred years. And Doctor <hi>Brown</hi> affirms, <q>that the <hi>Hebrew</hi> is incontro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vertibly the primitive and surest text to rely upon, and to preserve the same entire and un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>corrupt <note place="margin">Dr. Brown Pseu.

<pb n="157" facs="tcp:41214:85"/>
great Authority soever he be, to believe any thing that openly contradicts, what <hi>Moses</hi> hath delivered; which is the most certain rule of all histories, and unto which unless we consent, we cannot consent to truth. However, leaving every man to liberty of conscience herein; I shall, with my principal Authors also, proceed with the vulgar <hi>Aera,</hi> as I begunn, in all reverence sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitting to the written Word of God according to the <hi>Hebrew</hi> Text; not daring to vindicate the Antiquities of <hi>China,</hi> so highly, as with <hi>Vossius</hi> to say, <hi>Quamvis autem odiose dicium possit</hi> 
               <note place="margin">Is. Vos. de Aetat. Mun pag. 3.</note> 
               <hi>videri, dicam nihilominus, non defuisse, qui fortius istas Antiquitates adseruerint, quam alii Mosem defenderint.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>It sufficeth us, allowing which computation you please, that <hi>China</hi> was inhabited before the <hi>Confusion</hi> of Tongues, that for several Ages be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore that <hi>Canfusion</hi> the <hi>Chinois</hi> had the use of Letters; to wit, ever since the time of <hi>Fohius,</hi> whether likewise you admit him to have reigned either before or after the flood; and that at this present day the self same letters abstracted only, are in use amongst them. For we must observe, that the Characters they now use were abbre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viated, from those that <hi>Fohius</hi> with other of his Successors first composed to their speech, as by <hi>Kircherus,</hi> having elegantly inlarged upon that, that others have but hinted at, is manifestly evident,</p>
            <p>But before proceeding thereunto, seeing we are thus accidently fallen again upon their Chro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nology and Annals, I conceive it very pertinent, to let you know the surpassing care, and nor to

be paralleld order, the <hi>Chinois</hi> have from all An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiquity observed in writing of them, lest our fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowing discourse chiefly relating to their Lan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guage, should otherwise seem to receive an interruption thereby.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Martinius</hi> then telleth us, it was of old, and as <note place="margin">M. Mart. Sin, Hist. lib. 1. p. 20.</note> yet is used by this Nation, that the writing of the life and actions of the deceased Emperour, that it may be free from all deceit and flattery, is by his Successour committed to the charge of some of their most learned Philosophers, which trust is reputed of all others the greatest honour, and is by their chiefest men ambitiou<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">

               </gap>ly desired. Whereby the <hi>Chinique</hi> History hath been ever so continued like it self, as that, though from time to time as the Ages succeeded, it be inlarged by several Pens, it seems nevertheless to be the work of one only Author. For, it is unlawful for any but the Historiographer Royal to intermmeddle therewith, and criminal also, for the Writer of the succeeding times, to alter the preceding Hi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>story.</p>
            <p>In confirmation whereof, observe likewise the <note place="margin">I. Nieuh. l' Amb. Or. par. 2. pag. 104.</note> report that <hi>Nieuhoff</hi> makes. The Emperours of <hi>China,</hi> saith he, have evermore laboured to have the Annals of their Empire written by the most learned of all their Philosophers, whom they chuse and oblige to that end, which makes this people glory, that there is nothing that surpas<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>seth the truth of their Histories, and particularly those which are written from the two thousand, two hundred, and seventh year before the birth of CHRIST, unto this present time. Whereby their exact care in their Chronology admirably
<pb n="159" facs="tcp:41214:86"/>
appears; for, it falls out justly with the fortieth fourth year before the Confusion of Tongues, of which we had cause though upon a different oc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>casion (when stating at what time their Empire became hereditary) formerly to take notice, and as directly answereth to the end of the reign of <hi>Xunus,</hi> who first ordained this order to be perpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tually observed, and who upon the casting off of <hi>Chus,</hi> succeeded <hi>Iaus,</hi> as is already said. And it confirmeth also, what <hi>Martinius</hi> asserteth, That <note place="margin">M. Mart: Sin. hist. lib. 1. pag. 20.</note> there is hardly any Nation in the whole World to be found comparable to the <hi>Chinois</hi> for their certainty in Chronology. <hi>Quâ curâ non ullam facile nationem Sinis in Orbe reliquo parem invenias;</hi> being his words. And likewise, lest it were not sufficient for him once only to assert it, he af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firms the same again, saying, <hi>Quâ in re mirabile Sinarum semper studium emicuit,</hi> wherein the <note place="margin">Id. pag. 12.</note> wonderful care of the <hi>Chinois</hi> hath evermore ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>celled. Which <hi>Vossius</hi> iu like manner attesteth, frequently calling the same <hi>accuratissima Chrono<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>graphia, certissima Chronologia,</hi> the most certain Chronology, the most exact Chronography.</p>
            <p>We well known, those are not wanting, that make <hi>Nimrod</hi> to have arrived at <hi>Shinaar</hi> in the year one hundred and one after the Flood, and the <hi>Confusion</hi> to have been at <hi>Phaleg's</hi> birth; but although it is not to be beleeved; as <hi>Vossius</hi> saith, <note place="margin">Id. pag. 17.</note> that the building of the Tower, the <hi>Confusion of Tongues,</hi> and dispersion of the people should be made, before scarcely one Age after the Deluge <note place="margin">
                  <hi>Sir</hi> W. Rai. hist. par. 1. pag. 99.</note> was expired; and though, as Sir <hi>W. Raleigh</hi> tells us, <q>These men do all by miracle, and beget whole Nations without the help of
<pb n="160" facs="tcp:41214:87"/>
Time;</q> nevertheless let it be as improbable, and the time as much abridged as it will, even by this computation also, the Classique History of the <hi>Chinois</hi> begins fourteen years before the <hi>Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fusion of Tongues</hi> happened.</p>
            <p>It was in the year after the universal Inunda<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion one hundred and one, at which time <hi>Phaleg</hi> was born. <hi>Gen. 11. v.</hi> 16. that the division of the Earth, if understood to be at the birth of <hi>Phaleg,</hi> was made by <hi>Noah</hi> among his grand-children; &amp; that done, that they then went from the East<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ern parts unto the valley of <hi>Sennar;</hi> Arch-bishop <hi>Usher</hi> is of opinion. Whereby it manifestly seems, that from their removal out of the East, <note place="margin">Dr. Usher Ann. pag. 3</note> until the curse of confounded Languages, what in regard of their transmigration, what of the prodigiousness of their work, a considerable space of time interlapsed, but what that interval might be, he silently pretermits.</p>
            <p>And therefore, if you consult the <hi>Aera,</hi> that some marginal notes upon our Bible, <hi>Goropius,</hi> Sir <hi>W. Raleigh,</hi> and the most learned Antiquaries follow, which gives one hundred thirty one years before <hi>Nimrod</hi> came to <hi>Shinaar;</hi> and then if according to <hi>Glycas,</hi> as cited by <hi>Raleigh,</hi> you <note place="margin">Sir W. Ral. Histor. par. 1. pag. 100.</note> add thereunto forty years more to be consumed about bringing the Tower to an height before the <hi>Confusion</hi> ensued thereupon, you will readily find, that the History which the <hi>Chinois</hi> esteem so authentique commenceth thirty years before the dispersion at <hi>Babel,</hi> following Arch-bishop <hi>Ushers</hi> accompt; and by this other <hi>Aera</hi> observed by <hi>Raleigh</hi> and the rest it will appear, that the same history takes beginning eighty four years

before the <hi>Confusion of Tongues,</hi> the which in man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner accordeth rightly also, with what <hi>Trigautius</hi> &amp; <hi>Nieuhoff</hi> have delivered, that by their Annals it appears they have had the knowledg of one only God, above four thousand years; for we know that from the Flood to this present time three thousand nine hundred sixty two years have elap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed. Now <hi>Nieuhoff</hi> and <hi>Trigautius</hi> follow (I need not repeat it) the vulgar Chronology, and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duce their account from <hi>Iaus,</hi> who began to reign four thousand twenty five years since, and whose memory liveth by these Annals (which from <hi>Xunus</hi> seem to be called <hi>Xuking) Initium</hi>

The certainty then of their Annals &amp; Chronology being thus apparent, it re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mains only to enquire after their Language and Letters, and with what certainty they have been continued.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Alvarez Semedo</hi> tells us, That the Language <note place="margin">A. Sem. Rel. de la Cin. pa. 1. cap 6.</note> which they use in <hi>China,</hi> is of so great Antiquity, that many beleeve it to have been one of the 72 at the Tower of <hi>Babel.</hi> Of which opinion my self also will perhaps be, when either any of his Society, or other in his behalf shall make evident, so ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny Languages to have been spoken upon the <hi>Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fusion</hi> there. It is true, that as well many learn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed men, as <hi>Semedo,</hi> according to the number of
<pb n="162" facs="tcp:41214:88"/>
names laid down in the tenth Chapter of <hi>Genesis,</hi> being seventy, have supposed that the PRIMI<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>TIVE Tongue was confounded into the like number of Languages. But this, saith <hi>Heylin,</hi> I take to be but a conceit. It being plain, that <hi>Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>naan</hi> and his Sons, eleven in all, had but one Lan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guage <note place="margin">Heyl. Cosm. pag. 8.</note> amongst them, which was the <hi>Hebrew,</hi> or Language of the land of <hi>Canaan.</hi> And as for <hi>Iocian</hi> and his Sons, being thirteen in number, considering he was the younger brother of <hi>Pha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leg,</hi> in whose time this Confusion happened, it is most probable, and avowed for a certain truth, that either none of them were born, or if they were, yet were all of them too young to have had an hand in the design for the building of <hi>Ba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bel;</hi> and consequently could not be within the curse of <hi>Confounded Languages.</hi> So here is a third part of the seventy to be taken off, as possibly might all the sons of <hi>Mizraim</hi> be, if it were worth the while to insist upon it. With this <hi>Wil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>let, Purchas, Mede,</hi> and divers others agree. There<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore <note place="margin">A. Will. in Gen. 11. Pur. Pil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>grimage, lib. 1. pag. 40. I. Mede, lib. 1. pag. 368. M. Casaub. de 4 ling. pag. 5.</note> with them and <hi>Heylin,</hi> I take this but for a fancy, and till made otherwise appear, shall con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive, that the Language of the Empire of <hi>China,</hi> is of far higher Antiquity, and as antient, as the World it self and Mankind.</p>
            <p>Some again are of opinion, that the PRI<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>MITIVE Language was not divided at all in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to any more or less others, but that the Judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment which fell upon the Conspirators at <hi>Babel</hi> was nothing else, than that their minds, and their notions of things being consused, though they might speak the same words, as they did before, yet they could not understand one another. O<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers
<pb n="163" facs="tcp:41214:88"/>
again, that it was a forgetfulness of the for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer speech, and being forgotten, they afterwards mattered or babbled forth confusedly, whatever came next unto their Tongues-end. From whence it is supposed the word to Babble, used by us for a senceless discourse, proceedeth. But whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther a division, stupefaction, oblivion, or abso<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lute extirpation, (for what is <hi>confounded</hi> is redu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ced to nothing) it befel those only that were <hi>There</hi> in the Region of <hi>Babylon,</hi> and were either advisedly or actually contributors to the build<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of the Tower. And therefore concerns not us, who were throughly warm in our goodly seats long before that <hi>Confusion</hi> happened, and being not guilty of that crime, could not be within that curse, nor subject to that Judgment whatever it was. But to proceed. <note place="margin">N. Trig. de Christ Exp. apud Sin. lib 1. cap. 5</note>

            <p>Their Idiom is very succinct, insomuch that as in multitude of Letters they surpass all other <note place="margin">A. Kirch. Ch. Ill. par. 1. p. 11.</note> Nations of the World; so likewise in paucity of words they yeeld to all. For the number of their words scarcely exceeds sixteen hundred. All of them also end in vowels, some few ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cepted which terminate in M, or N, and they are all Monosyllables and Indeclinables, as well Nouns, as Verbs; and so accomodated to their use, that many times the Verb serveth for a <note place="margin">A.

               <hi>Syntax:</hi> And for the same reason we are assured by <hi>Semedo</hi> also, that their Language is more easy to be learned, than the <hi>Latine,</hi> the Gram<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mar only whereof taketh up all our younger years. Hear him, <hi>Con che si facilita per essere stu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diata più che la Latina la cui sola Grammatica si piglia gli anni dell'eta puerile.</hi> Now these being his words, it seemed very strange to me to find, that in the Essay towards the <hi>Philosophical Lan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guage,</hi> pag. 452, it is said, that upon the accompt of the great Aequivocableness <hi>Alvarez Semedo</hi> affirms the <hi>Chinique</hi> Tongue to be more difficult, than any other Language of the World, quoting <hi>Histor. China Par. 2. Cap.</hi> 2. But, the truth is, the Author is too learned to commit such an error himself, and therefore deserved a more careful Transcriber; for those words are neither in the place quoted, nor in any part of <hi>Semedo</hi>'s whole relation. Who, on the contrary, will likewise ere we conclude, not from casual hear-say, but his own long experience, receiving what he writ, not from the ears of others but his own <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">

               </gap>ys, attest, that upon the very self same accompt pretended it surpasseth for sweetness all other Languages at this day known.</p>
            <p>It depends not, moreover, upon Letters dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>posed into an Alphabetical form like ours, nor have they in their Language any words com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pounded <note place="margin">A<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> Kirc. <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">

                  </gap>h. Ill. par. 6. pag. 226</note> of Letters and Syllables; but every single Character importeth a single word or name, whereby they had need of as many Cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>racters, as there are things, by which they would deliver the conceptions of their minds. For example, if any should go about to render <hi>Cale<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pine</hi>
               <pb n="165" facs="tcp:41214:89"/>
into their Idiom, so many and different Characters he ought to have, as there are dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferent words therein. Neither do they use Declensions or Conjunctions, seing all these are involved in the Characters themselves. So that it behoveth that man to be endued with a good memory, that intendeth to attain, but even unto an indifferent perfection in the <hi>Chinique</hi> Learn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing. Insomuch that he that by long study, throughout in manner his whole life time, ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riveth to the highest perfection therein, as also amongst us whilst living we still learn, obtaineth deservedly the prime honours and dignities of the Empire. And as they are more or less learn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, so are they less or more esteemed. From <note place="margin">G. Mend. Hist. de la Chin. lib. <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 word">

            <p>It may nevertheless not undeservedly seem admirable unto any man, saith <hi>Kircherus,</hi> why so many, and such Characters, which in their Onomasticon, called <hi>Haipien,</hi> to wit, the Ocean are numbred at sixty thousand, should be in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>volved as we said in so few words, which that it may be manifest we are to know, that the words of the <hi>Chinique</hi> Language, as we lately shewed, hardly exceed sixteen hundred. We may with <hi>Semedo</hi> distinguish them. Their Lan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guage hath not in all, saith he, more than three hundred and twenty <hi>vocaboli</hi> [words, I suppose unaccented and unasperated] and of <hi>parole</hi> [words which though really the same, differ in the aspiration and accent only] one thousand
<pb n="166" facs="tcp:41214:90"/>
two hundred twenty eight. But as every of these words hath many and divers significations, so, unless by the different accents they are not to be understood. For, one word signifies sometimes ten, &amp; sometimes twenty several things, intelli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gible only by the different pronunciation of the <note place="margin">A. Kirch. Ch. Ill. par. 6. pag. 235, 236.</note> Accent. Whereby in regard of the double sence, their Language to strangers is very difficult, and not without great labour, intentive stady, and with a thousand reflexions to be learned by them. So that, it is one thing to know the <hi>Chi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niqùe</hi> Characters, another, to speak the <hi>Chinique</hi> Tongue. For any stranger that hath a good me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mory, and diligent care withal, may attain to the height of Learning by reading of the Books of <hi>China,</hi> although he can neither speak the Lan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guage, nor understand what the Natives speak to him. From whence may be collected, that as the <hi>Frenchman</hi> writeth, not as he speaketh, so the <hi>Chinois</hi> speaketh not, as he writeth. And we know, that even at this day, in all generally, as well antient, as modern Languages, there is be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween the reading and speaking a difference ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther more or less. However, as for that in <hi>China,</hi> 
               <note place="margin">N. Trig. de Ch. Exp. apud Sin. lib. 1. p. 25.</note> 
               <hi>Trigautius</hi> tells us, That all the difference be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween the speaking and writing consists in the connexion of the words only.</p>
            <p>But hereof <hi>Nieuboff</hi> will particularly inform <note place="margin">I. Nieub. l' Amb. Or: par. 2. pag. 12.</note> you, There is no Language, saith he, that hath so many words of a double sence as the <hi>Chinique;</hi> which is apprehensible by the different cadency of the voice. The incommodity received there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by is very great; for one cannot write any thing, that is read to him in this Language, nor of him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>self
<pb n="167" facs="tcp:41214:90"/>
understand a word, unless he have recourse to their Books, to know the double sence there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of by the Characters, whereby he may readily find it out; when in speaking, he cannot con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive what the Native meaneth. So that, one is not only obliged to have the words repeated, but likewise either with Ink to have them set down in writing, or if that be wanting, with water on the Table, or some other thing expressed. This double sence may in some measure he apprehend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed by five different cadencies or principal Tones, which are hard to be distinguished nevertheless, in regard of their sweetness: One word often<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times receiveth (amongst strangers especially) five several meanings through this variety of Tones. And there is not one word also, which hath not one of them, and likewise twenty or thirty significations, according to the diversity of the Aspirations, which the Natives learn from their cradles, but is very difficult for a stranger to attain.

other Language; we may well conceive, that it was at first infused or inspired, as the PRIMITIVE Language was into our first Parents, and so from them received, rather than otherwise invented and taught the <hi>Chinois.</hi> And whereas some fancy, that it is in many respects very imperfect, and exceeding equ<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">

For, without all peradventure it is a perfectly natural speech, and was a Language before the World knew, as to this particular at least, what that, which we now call Art, meant. And as for the double sence of the words, those that have long lived in <hi>China,</hi> those that have diligently studied the same, and who are most concerned, and can best tell, shall give you full satisfaction in due place, that this aequivocableness makes it not only a sweet, but also a compendious, pleasant, and graceful Lan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guage, not naturally defective.</p>
            <p>But <hi>Golius</hi> himself shall presently attest it, verily, saith he, their Language in this is truly singular, and it is almost incredible, that all their words are not only Monosyllables, and guilt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>less of Grammatical differences, but also of such very great affinity between themselves; that, not otherwise, than by a most fine variety of pronunciation scarcely perceptible by other people, they are distinguished. And that throughout all Ages their speech hath been
<pb n="169" facs="tcp:41214:91"/>
one and the self same; he formerly assured us.</p>
            <p>Now had he withal said, that their Charact<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers were artificial, much Rhetorique needed not to have perswaded us into a beleef thereof; in regard their first, confisting of Beasts, Birds, Plants, Fishes, and the like, could not be made without some knowledge in <hi>Design.</hi> Whereby also this Art appears certainly to be, if not more, at least as antient, as Hieroglyphicks. And as for those which they use at present, though it is true, that according as they are written, either in a set or running hand, they yeeld a deviation in figure: nevertheless they are grounded on the <hi>Mathematiques;</hi> for, they be composed of perpendicular, rectangular, parallel, and circular lines, as we shall shortly prove, being now obli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ged thereunto.</p>

invented) each of their first six or seven Emperours found out one, <hi>Fohius</hi> the first sort, <note place="margin">M. Mart. Sin, Hist. lib. 1. p. 22.</note> 
               <hi>Idem Imperator Sinicos Characteres reperit, quos loco nodorum adhibuit, sed ipsis nodis intricatiores;</hi> The same Emperour accidentily devised the <hi>Chinique</hi> Characters, which he used in the place of Knots, but more intricate, than the Knots themselves. <hi>Kircherus,</hi> as was said, not unaptly, in regard of their involvings, tells us, he took them from Serpents and Dragons; as <hi>Iaus,</hi> the seventh sort from Tortoises, and their several postures: <hi>Sep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tima</hi>

Which are his countermarks to demonstrate how exactly they correspond, with those they now use. In every one of these Characters six things were to be considered, the Figure, Sound, Use, Significa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, Composition and Explication.</p>
            <p>Now, it cannot but be here observed, <hi>Marti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nius</hi> saith, that their Emperour <hi>Fohius</hi> introdu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ced his invention of their Characters in the place of Knots; whereby it may be collected, that as the <hi>Americans</hi> afterwards, in their Histories, by <hi>Quippoes,</hi> and the <hi>Laplanders</hi> and <hi>Samoeds</hi> at this day, in their Exorcisms, by Knots; so the <hi>Chi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nois</hi> more antiently expressed the concep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions of their minds by the like way. And to this purpose I find, in our Author, that not much before <hi>Fohius</hi> his dayes one <hi>Suius</hi> governe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed <note place="margin">M.

               <hi>China,</hi> and that he, instead of Characters and Letters, first found out knots of Ropes, for easing
<pb n="172" facs="tcp:41214:93"/>
of the memory, and taught them the right way of using them in Schools.</p>
            <p>Furthermore, it appears by <hi>Martinius,</hi> that they have a certain sort of Characters in use at this <note place="margin">Id. pag. 17.</note> day, which were invented long before the reign of <hi>Fohius.</hi> For, <hi>Thienhoangus,</hi> who was their next governour after <hi>Puoncuus,</hi> and, who first civilized, and brought them into order, invented that double sort of Letters, from which by joyn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing them together, the <hi>Chinois</hi> afterwards, about the year before CHRIST according to the vulgar computation two thousand six hundrrd and seventy, framed their Cycle of sixty years. The first sort consists of ten Letters, which they call <hi>Can;</hi> the second contains the twelve hours of the day, which not by numbers, but particular Characters they express and signifie. From the connexion of these same characters, they suppose to know, not only the name and quality of the year, but also of the whole year, and every day thereof, the secret motions of the Heavens, and their influences upon terrestrial bodies and na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tural things.</p>

<pb n="173" facs="tcp:41214:93"/>
substracting certain points and lines from them, reduced them into a more compendious method, which even unto this very day they use. Now, that the Characters which even unto this very day they use, how many Ages soever their first Characters were invented before, have been above three thousand seven hundred years used by them, will very suddenly from warrantable Authority be made good.</p>
            <p>Of these Characters the number is so great, as that it is scarcely known. <hi>Martinius</hi> and <hi>Semedo</hi> compute them at sixty thousand; <hi>Tri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gautius</hi> at seventy or eighty thousand; <hi>Kircherus</hi> saith eighty thousand, and <hi>Nieuhoff</hi> from <hi>Man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deslaus</hi> in his History of <hi>Persia,</hi> finds them to be more than an hundred and twenty thousand. <note place="margin">A. Sem. Rel. de la Cin. par. 1. cap. 6 N. Trig. de Exp. Christ apud Sin. lib. 1. cap. 5.</note> Of which nevertheless eight or ten thousand are sufficient to learn their Idiom<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> that a man may tollerably converse, and know how to write the Characters, and perhaps throughout their whole Empire, there is not any man, saith <hi>Trigautius,</hi> that knows them all. And when they meet with any that they call a cold Letter, they have recourse to their Vocabulary, as we to ours for any <hi>Latine</hi> word we understand not; which evidently declares, that he amongst them, that knows the most Letters is most learned, as with us, he is the best <hi>Latinist,</hi> that is best ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quainted with his Dictionary, or he the greatest Scholast that hath read or studied most. The first of their Characters signifies God (their <hi>Xangti</hi> happily may be intended) as the Cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>racter <note place="margin">G. Merc.

            <p>
               <pb n="174" facs="tcp:41214:94"/>
Now to form all this multitude<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> of Letters, they use nine strokes or touches with the pen only; yet so disposed nevertheless, that by ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding, diminishing, or turning of a stroke, they make other new and different ones, and of dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferent significations. For example, the streight line marked A, signifies One; being crossed with another line, as at B, it expresseth Ten; made with another at the bottom, as at C, it de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>notes the Earth; and with another at the top, as at D, it standeth for a King; by adding a touch on the left side between the two first strokes, as at E, it is taken for a Pearl; but that which is marked with F, signifies Creation or Life; and lastly by the character under G, is intended Sir.</p>

Now, as from him is not to be collected; how many more, than three thousand seven hundred years, his words <hi>da più</hi> may imply, so in regard they relate not to their first or <hi>primier</hi> Characters, but those particularly which they now use, and to the time chiefly when they came to be reformed, we have no need to insist upon them. Though the formerly mentioned <hi>plusquam</hi> of <hi>Vossius,</hi> purposely insert<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed that it may be observed to this end, compre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hends no less, than five hundred years. Where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore following his assignation precisely, I say, it is plainly manifest thereby, that not only the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ducing of their <hi>primier</hi> Characters to a more compendious method, than formerly they were, hapned two hundred thirty four years after the flood; but also that ever since that their reduce<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, their Letters have continued without any alteration, and are the self same at this instant time, as when primarily they were reduced. In like manner <hi>Kircherus</hi> throughout the sixth part of his <hi>China Illustrata</hi> most certainly demonstrates, that every particular Letter of them, bears at this very time the self same signification in their Language as the peculiar <hi>primier</hi> Character, from which it was abstracted, antiently did. And both <hi>Martinius</hi>
               <pb n="176" facs="tcp:41214:95"/>
and <hi>Nieuhoff</hi> very late Writers, &amp; by so much the more unquestionable, have long since declared, that their <hi>primier</hi> Characters were invented al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>most three thousand years before the birth of CHRIST. And indeed, that the Inven<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of them long preceded their Refor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mation, not any man can possibly doubt, considering especially, setting what hath for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>merly been said aside, that being they were devised by several persons, succeeding one another in several Ages, they must of necessity take up many years of time; before likewise their posterity could gain so much experience, as to perceive the great disorder atterding such a mass of Animals and Plants, divers years also must necessarily elapse, and at last the bringing of them, being so numerous, into their present form, in regard of the frequent consultations, mature deliberations, and manifold transcrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions, could not in like manner be performed at an instant. Therefore, without all peradven<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, their first Letters must be much more antient by far than those which they now use; as <hi>Nieuhoff</hi> and <hi>Martinius</hi> have asserted. But if you incline rather unto <hi>Kircherus,</hi> and the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>putation which he follows, then it appears there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by, that their <hi>Primier</hi> Characters were first found out, no less than two hundred forty four years before the <hi>Confusion of Tongues,</hi> but at what time, or in what Age their Emendation succeeded, is not to be gathered, either from him or <hi>Vossius.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>The <hi>Chinois</hi> give willingly great sums of mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ney for a Copy of their antient Characters well formed, and they value a good writing of their
<pb n="177" facs="tcp:41214:95"/>
now Letters far more than a good painting, whereby from being thus esteemed, they come to be reverenced. Insomuch that they cannot endure to see a written paper lying on the ground, but finding it immediately take it up, &amp; carry the same to the Childrens Schools, where in an appointed place for keeping the like papers, they remain, till afterwards at certain times they burn them, not out of Religion as the Turks, but only out of the love they bear to Letters.</p>
            <p>From <hi>Semedo</hi> we have somewhat more to say, <note place="margin">A. Sem. Rel. de. la in. par. 10 cap. 6.</note> 
               <hi>[Il Linguaggio] è vario, perchè sono varii li Reg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ni, delli quali hoggi si compone questa Corona, &amp; an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticamente non eransuoi, mà p<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">

By which it is evidently manifest, that in those Countries which did antiently belong unto this Crown, the speech doth not differ but remains pure and un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>corrupted.</p>
            <p>And hence it is that <hi>Martinius</hi> throughout his <hi>Atlas</hi> of <hi>China,</hi> when giving us the Chorogra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phical descriptions of their antient Imperial Countries, delivers not so much as one only word of any whatever difference they have in speech.

               </gap>cans they came to vary therein.

            <p>But, observe the opinion of <hi>M. Casaubon</hi> con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerning <note place="margin">M. Casaub. de 4 ling. pag. 8.</note> the difference of their Language. I con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fess, saith he, that in some sort there may be a di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>versity in the speech of the Provinces of <hi>China:</hi> not any man nevertheless can possibly think, that this diversity could happen, until there were several Provinces, but much more rather, that the diversity proceeded from the difference of the Regions, and the Governments of them. Which is not to be denied; for, we cannot sup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pose, but that their speech might come to be dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferent, either according to the temperature of the Air, or as the scituation of the Province was more or less mountanous, which naturally cau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>seth greater or lesser rudeness in the pronuncia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of a Language; or else according to the care in Government, as they were less or more
<pb n="180" facs="tcp:41214:97"/>
trained up in civility, and kept within due order; which accordingly preserveth Language in its purity and perfection. In like manner the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duct of the Plantations, might be of great con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cernment therein, as when either the new Plant<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers arose from the first swarm, or were of a se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cond or third castling from other places; whilst the head Colony, as may be said, or main body of the Monarchy retained and enjoyed purely their genuine or natural speech. Wherefore ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitting; that in those Northern and Southern Regions the Language doth differ, as much per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>haps as our Southern, Western, and Northern-<hi>English,</hi> for it will scarcely appear to differ much more, yet it is still one and the same speech.

            <p>
               <hi>Mendoza</hi> makes mention of this difference also, and therewith somewhat acquaints us wherein it doth consist. He telleth us then, that it is admirably strange, that though in the
<pb n="181" facs="tcp:41214:97"/>
Dominions of this Empire, they have several kinds of speech, nevertheless all generally un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derstand it by the Letters, not Words. But the reason is, saith he, because one and the same figure, and one and the same Character, is common to all in the signification of one and the same thing, although it be diversly named in the speech; as for example, the Character for a City is universally known throughout their Empire, though in some places they call it <hi>Leombi,</hi> and in others <hi>Fù,</hi> the like hapning in all other nouns. Now, this proceeds not only in regard their Language is aequivocal through the divers significations of the Letter according to the Accent; but also because they have pecu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liar words for particular things according to the respective dignity and quality that the thing spoken of, carries in their speech; as <hi>Semedo, Nieuhoff,</hi> and <hi>Kircherus</hi> have told us, and as from <hi>Martinius</hi> you will very suddenly hear. And therefore <hi>Mendoza</hi> ought to have declared what kind of City the <hi>Chinois</hi> intend by <hi>Leombi;</hi> for, what manner they mean by <hi>Fù</hi> will appear ere long. And of all of them the words are perfect <hi>Chinois,</hi> and after the purity of their Idiom pronounced accordingly. As in like manner with us, though in the North of <hi>England</hi> they call that a <hi>Dove-cote,</hi> which in the South is called a <hi>Pigeon-house,</hi> the names never<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>theless are good <hi>English;</hi> So also <hi>Ensis</hi> is as true <hi>Latine</hi> for a Sword as <hi>Gladius;</hi> and <gap reason="foreign">

            <p>The Natives of <hi>China</hi> speak generally as from their Infancy they are taught, without observing any Accents at all; whereby in divers places the People, like our countrey Peasants, as they afterwards attain to a more or less habit of ci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vility and learning speak finer, or broader, and with a fuller mouth than others. For, it may be collected from <hi>Martinius,</hi> that he among <note place="margin">M. Mart. Sin. Hist. lib. <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 word">

            <p>By all which it appears, that from the diffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rent appellations given to one and the same Cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>racter, and the divers pronunciation of their Characters in divers places, though the words are the very same, the diversity of their Language proceedeth.

for he that will write according as commonly they speak, may worthily be laughed at. Hence it <note place="margin">G.

                  </gap>p. apud Sin. lib. 1. p. 37.</note> giving us another reason for it, saith, I do verily beleeve, that the cause thereof is, for that from all memory of Ages, this people have endea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vored to write elegantly rather than so to speak, insomuch that all their Eloquence even to these our dayes consists not in pronunciation but writing only. <hi>Hic porro scribendi modus, quo sin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gulis rebus singulos appingimus characteres, etsi me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moriae sit permolestus, tamen adfert secum insig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nem quandam nostrisque inauditam commoditatem,</hi> &amp;c. But al though this way of writing, whereby we are, saith he, to set down a particular cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>racter for every thing, be extremely troublesome to the memory, yet it brings with it a certain fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mous and incredible advantage to us, in regard of the universality of the Letter. Which incredi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble advantage, that as well the whole World. as we <hi>Europaeans</hi> may enjoy, our learned Dr. <hi>Iohn Wilkins</hi> by the proposal of a <hi>Real Character</hi> hath made a fair overture lately, and if others would as willingly contribute their studies, as he hath ingeniously begun<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> for no humane invention, but Divine creation can make any thing perfect on the sudden; we might no longer complain of the unhappy consequences that succeeded the <hi>Confusion at Babel,</hi> nor <hi>China</hi> glory that she a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lone shall evermore triumph in the full fruition
<pb n="188" facs="tcp:41214:101"/>
of those abundant felicities that attended man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kind, whilst one common Language was spoken throughout the World.</p>
            <p>Now, though it is not to be denied but that Language precedes Letters, for we speak before we can either read or write, nevertheless it must be granted withal, that we could neither write nor read, unless Characters had been framed to Language. And Characters were at first framed to Language, not only that by them, the actions of the respective people might be commemora<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted, but also that by such commemoration the Language it self should be preserved to Posteri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty. Therefore the certainty of Language con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sists not so much in the speaking and pronoun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, as in the reading and writing: not in the words but Letters. For thus, he that is wel read in the Oriental tongues, we declare to be a great Lin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guist, as being learned in the speech of the East<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ern Nations. By which it manifestly appears, as Bishop <hi>Walton</hi> formerly asserted, that by Inscrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions the truth of Language is discovered. Now <hi>Nieuhoff, Vossius,</hi> and others have assured us, that the <hi>Chinois</hi> can and will in maintenance of the truth of <hi>Theirs</hi> produce faithful witnesses, Antient Records written from Age to Age in not Alpha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>betary, but significative Characters, such, as the World in the Infancy and Nonage thereof had in use, &amp; such as <hi>Martinius, Semedo,</hi> &amp; our <hi>Chinique</hi> authors have generally affirmed, are the same at this very day, as when primitively they were in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vented: which eminently convinceth that their Language remains as pure and uncorrupt at this present in those Characters, as when they first began to have a Language.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="189" facs="tcp:41214:101"/>
But the Reverend Bishop proceeds farther, and positively, as formerly cited, concludes, saying, <hi>Idcircò linguae omnes, quas libri scripti a communi clade non servant, vicissitudini, ut om<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nia humana, semper obnoxiae sunt, &amp; singulis soe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culis insignem mutationem subeunt;</hi> Wherefore all Languages that written books have not preserved from common ruin, are, as all hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mane things, ever obnoxious to change, and in every Age undergo a notable mutation. Whereby it is more manifestly evident (And to this end especially he thus delivered his judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment) that such Languages which have been preserved in written books are not subject to change. And therefore, finding from those Authors that living many years in <hi>China,</hi> have <note place="margin">N. Trig. de Christ. Exp. apud Sin. lib. 1. pag. 3 M. Mart. Sin, Hist. in Epist. ad Lector.</note> not only been eye witnesses, but also day and night most studious in their Antiquities <hi>(Mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinius</hi> professing that for ten years together, except for his set prayers, he never took any book in hand but <hi>Theirs)</hi> finding I say from such unquestionable Authorities; That the <hi>Chinois</hi> have been a people ever since the flood of <hi>Noah,</hi> and before the <hi>Confusion</hi> of Tongues; That their Language hath continually in all times, from their firstbeginning to be a Nation, been preserved in written books; <hi>That</hi> the Characters where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>with those books be written, are the self same, which from all Antiquity were extracted from their Original Hieroglyphicks: <hi>That</hi> in those Characters their Language hath ever since consisted, and according to them, is at this present day spoken purely: And <hi>That</hi> by the some Characters their Language is generally
<pb n="190" facs="tcp:41214:102"/>
and universally understood throughout the whole <hi>Chinique</hi> World, We may safely con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clude that the MOTHER or NATURAL Language of the Empire of <hi>China,</hi> perdures in its Antient purity without any change or alteration.</p>
            <p>And I must not omit, that several books yet live amongst them, written in their first and original Hieroglyphicks, which still remaining in their Libraries, are understood by all their <note place="margin">A. Kirch. Ch. Ill. par. 6. p. 228, A. Sem. Rel de la Cin. par. 1. c, 6. M. Mart. Sin. hist. lib. 1. p. 16.</note> 
               <hi>Literati,</hi> though they are no longer used, except in some Inscriptions, and Seals instead of Coats of Arms. Among these sort of Books is extant one called <hi>Yeking</hi> of great Antiquity, as taking beginning with <hi>Fohius,</hi> and of as great esteem for the <hi>Arcana</hi> it contains. This Book seems much to confirm the opinion of those, that would have the Inscription at <hi>Persetolis</hi> more antient than the flood. For, as <hi>This</hi> in <hi>Persia</hi> consists only in Triangles several wayes trans<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>versed: So <hi>That</hi> in <hi>China</hi> consists only of streight lines several wayes interrupted. It treats especially of Judicial Astrology, Politique Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernment, and occult Philosophy.</p>
            <p>But some may perhaps say, that with the change of their Antient Theology, the <hi>Chinois</hi> might change their Language also. But this Argument is of no validity at all; for, it may as well be said, that the <hi>Israelites</hi> because they set up the <hi>Golden Calfe</hi> in the Wilderness, lost their natural Tongue; or at least when under <hi>Ieroboam,</hi> ten whole Tribes making a defection followed the like Idolatry. But to come nearer home, every man knows, that our selves changed
<pb n="191" facs="tcp:41214:102"/>
our Religion in the time of <hi>Edward</hi> the sixth; yet not any man knows, that thereby<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> our speech received an alteration. Besides the <hi>Chinois</hi> did not so totally fall from their Antient Theology, but that (as hath been said) they have <hi>Xangti,</hi> their being infected with Idolatry notwith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>standing, <note place="margin">N. Trig. de Christ. Exp. apud Sin. lib. 1. p, 105</note> in as great veneration at this day, as <hi>ab antiquo;</hi> also their <hi>Literati</hi> not only not worship, but likewise have no Idols, still ado<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring one only Deity, by whom they beleeve all things here below are governed and preserved; and they use the same Language now, as when they first were taught to adore one God only, which according both to <hi>Trigautius</hi> and <hi>Nieuhoff</hi> is above four thousand years since.</p>
            <p>NOW, in regard that those who have writ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten of the PRIMITIVE Tongue, may be observed to recommend unto us six principal guides to be directed by, for the discovery thereof; viz. <hi>Antiquity, Simplicity, Generality<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> Modesty of expression, Utility,</hi> and <hi>Brevity,</hi> to which by some is added <hi>Consent of Authors</hi> also; We having already spoken sufficiently, as to the Antiquity, will consider in what degree the Language of the <hi>Chinois</hi> may correspond with the rest of these Remarques, and then submit our selves to censure.</p>
            <p>First then as to <hi>Simplicity,</hi> our <hi>Chinique</hi> is a Language that consists (and it is singular there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in) all of Monosyllables, not one Dissyllable, or Polysyllable being to be found in it; nor hath it any Vowels or Consonants, but a peculiar Hieroglyphical Character for what ever can be conceived, either in the mind, or may be obvious
<pb n="192" facs="tcp:41214:103"/>
to the sence. And if in this our Essay you have met with some words of many syllables, note nevertheless that every syllable is a particular <note place="margin">N. Trig. in Exp. Christ apud Sin. lib. 1. p. 26.</note> word, but because that divers syllables are taken to signifie one only thing, those which we have had occasion to mention herein, are by us con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nexed after the manner of our speech in <hi>Europe.</hi> And although the <hi>Chinois</hi> have as many Charact<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers as there are things, they know nevertheless so well how to joyn them together, that they ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceed not above seventy or eighty thousand, as you have heard.</p>
            <p>Neither doth their Language consist, saith <note place="margin">M. Mart. Sin. hist. in Epist. ad Lector.</note> 
               <hi>Martinius,</hi> as ours, of any certain Method, or order of Alphabet, but every thing hath a figure, by which it may be differently expressed from others, composed by no Art or Rule, and as it were by chance attributed to the subject-mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter; and fitted, as I may add, to the Infancy and Simplicity of Time. Furthermore the <hi>Chi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nois</hi> are never put to that irkesome vexation of searching out a <hi>Radix</hi> for the derivation of any of their words, as generally all other Nations are; but the <hi>Radix</hi> is the word, and the word the <hi>Radix,</hi> and the syllable the same also, as <hi>Tri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gautius</hi> hath long since affirmed; which per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>swades a facility in their speech not to be paral<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leld by any other Language, and that the true, genuine, and original sence of things seems to remain with them. Besides they are not trou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bled with variety of Declensions, Conjugations, Numbers, Genders, Moods, Tenses, and the like Grammatical niceties, but are absol<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">

               </gap>tely free from all such perplexing accidents, having no
<pb n="193" facs="tcp:41214:103"/>
other Rules in use, than what the light of Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture hath dictated unto them; whereby their Language is plain, easie, and simple, as a NA<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>TURAL speech ought to be. And it is worthy observation, that, whereas, in point of Theolo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gy, they of all other people have been least guid<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed by the light of Nature; in point of Language, they of all other people have been most, yea, on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly guided by the light of Nature. But it was Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture that from God taught them their Language, and it was the God of Nature, that by <hi>Noah</hi> taught them their Theology.</p>
            <p>Moreover, the Letters, then which nothing can be more certain, testifie, that it is <hi>sine ulla vocum peregrinarum mixtura,</hi> without any mixture of for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ein words.

And if ever our <hi>Europ<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">

                  </gap>ans</hi> shall become throughly studied in the <hi>Chinique</hi> tongue, it will be found, that not only the <hi>Chinois</hi> want words to other Languages common, but also that they have very many whereby they express themselves in such Elegancies, as neither by <hi>He<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brew,</hi> or <hi>Greek,</hi> or any other Language how ele<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gant soever can be expressed. Besides, whereas the <hi>Hebrew</hi> is harsh and rugged, the <hi>Chinique</hi> ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pears the most sweet and smooth Language, of all others throughout the whole World at this day known.</p>
            <p>And as if all things conspired to prove this the PRIMITIVE Tongue. We may ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>serve, how forceably Nature struggles to demon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>strate so much. The very first expression we make of life, at the very instant minute of our Births, is, as was touched on before, by uttering the <hi>Chinique</hi> word <hi>Ya.</hi> Which is not only the first, but indeed the sole and only expression, that Mankind from Nature can justly lay claim unto.</p>
            <p>The Language of <hi>China</hi> as hath been shewed also consisteth all of Monosyllables, &amp; in our In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fancy, the first Notions of speech we have are all Monosyllables; as <hi>Ta,</hi> for Father; <hi>Ma,</hi> for Mother; <hi>Pa,</hi> for Brother; the like happening in all other terms, until by hearing and observing what o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers in our <hi>confused Language</hi> say, we alter ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cordingly, adding now and than a Letter or Syl<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lable
<pb n="197" facs="tcp:41214:105"/>
by degrees; whereby in the end we are brought to plain words. For, it is not by natural instinct, but by imitation, and as we are instruct<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed that we arrive at speech, that is, in simple terms and words to express the open notions of things, which the second act of Reason com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poundeth into propositions, and the last into forms of Ratiocination.</p>
            <p>The <hi>Chinois</hi> have not the Letter R, nor can <note place="margin">I. <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 word">

And when our Children attain to riper Age; as if Nature abhorred the <hi>Confusion,</hi> what care and pains do we take, what opportunities not lay hold of, by practising and repeating to make them pronounce this Letter, till education after long contest prevailing they arrive thereat? Thus from our <hi>Births</hi> to our <hi>In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fancy,</hi> and from our <hi>Infancy</hi> to <hi>Riper Age,</hi> till Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture is compelled to yeeld by the enforced pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er of instruction, unto corrupt speech, we gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rally throughout the Universe appear in our Language direct <hi>Chinois.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>But peradventure here likewise some will be ready to suggest, that the Language of <hi>China</hi> is not plain and easy, but difficult, not to strangers only, but the Natives also, in regard of the divers Accents and great Aequivocation of the words proceeding from them. To which is answe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red, that let the difficulty be supposed as great as thought may think, or Art can make, it relates unto strangers solely; and therefore cannot in the least degree reflect upon the Primitiveness of the speech; because when the whole World
<pb n="198" facs="tcp:41214:106"/>
had one common Language; throughout the whole World none were strangers to that Lan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guage; but all people universally understood and spake the same, being born Natives thereo<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">
                  <desc>•…</desc>
               </gap>, and learning it from their Mothers breasts, as the natural <hi>Chinois</hi> now do, or as any other Nation ever did theirs. It was the <hi>Confusion of Tongues,</hi> that first made strange Languages, and Strangers to them, whereby they became dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficult to be attained. But afterwards, when either curiosity invited, or necessity compelled men to learn them, Art entred to act her part therein, and by methodical wayes, and orderly Rules sweetned difficulty, and induced her to submit to diligence, which after much study nevertheless prevailed; and finally got the upper hand.</p>
            <p>And this <hi>China</hi> it self shall witness, for <hi>Pr. Iacobus Pantoya</hi> finding it absolutely necessary for propagating of the Gospel, to know the true Idiom of the Language, framed our <hi>Europaean</hi> musical notes UT, RE, MI, FA, SOL, LA, to answer in pronuntiation unto the elevations and cadencies observable in the <hi>Chinique</hi> Accents which are these,
^
¯
`
´

˚</p>
            <p>The first Accent  ^ answers to the Musical <note place="margin">A. Kirch. Ch.

            <p>The second, ¯ answers to <hi>RE,</hi> and a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mongst the <hi>Chinois,</hi> it is as much to say, as a clear

            </p>
            <p>The third ` answers to MI; expressing with them of <hi>China,</hi> a lofty voice: more strongly delivered, but more flat in the pronunciation than the former.</p>
            <p>The fourth ´ answers to FA, and <hi>Chiniquely</hi> signifies, the lofty voice of one who is going forth; that speaks, in contrary to `, more free<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly and in an higher Tone; or as if it proceeded from one that puts a question.</p>
            <p>The fifth ˘ answers to SOL, and thereby in the Language of <hi>China,</hi> the quick or hasty voice of one that is comming in, is intended.</p>
            <p>The last, ˚, as also, <gap reason="symbol" extent="1 letter">

               </gap> denote a plain voice.</p>
            <p>By this invention the Society came to be much aided in overcoming the difficulty of the speech: And by the help of these notes strangers learn the Language, but with what labour, and by how many reflexions, is easier in thought to be imagined, than by the pen, saith <hi>Kircherus,</hi> to be expressed. So that it is cleerly manifest this <note place="margin">A. Kir. Ch Ill. par. 6. p. 236.</note> difficulty relateth unto Foreiners particu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>larly; for the native <hi>Chinois,</hi> as the same Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thor affirmeth, never observe any Accents at all, but from their cradles, as almost all other Nations, are accustomed to the pronuntiation of their MOTHER Tongue, although their <hi>Literati</hi> not only <hi>in actu exercito,</hi> but <hi>in actu sig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nato,</hi> both in the Practique and Theory, know and teach every Letter to be pronounced truly, according to the respective Accent due to it. Which more fully adjusts the simplicity and
<pb n="200" facs="tcp:41214:107"/>
purity of their Language; and the strict care they take to preserve the same.</p>
            <p>Now, as this difficulty is great unto strangers, who alwayes in attaining whatever speech en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>counter much; So they are abundantly re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>compenced, and more advantaged in other respects; not only in regard as you lately heard, of the incredible commodity they receive, by saving the labour of learning divers Languages, whilst in <hi>China</hi> it self the Idiom varying, and in the adjacent Kingdoms the languages being different, they all agree in writing; but also in regard of the many Elegancies arising from the double sence of the words, on which the difficulty is grounded. For this Aequivocableness is accounted the Elegancy of their Language, which consists, as was said, in the written Cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>racter rather, than the vocal word, and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore to furnish <hi>That,</hi> the <hi>Chinois</hi> neglecting <note place="margin">N. Trig. de Christ. Exp. apud Sin. lib 1. p. 27. Pur. Pilgr. l. 4. p. 447</note> 
               <hi>This,</hi> all their negotiations of what kind soeuer are transacted, even all their most familiar messages sent, by way of memorial in writing, not by word of mouth. And from this Elegancy it is, that those of <hi>Iapan</hi> though they have of late times invented forty eight Letters for the dispatch of their ordinary affairs, by the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nexion of which they express and declare what<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever they please. Yet nevertheless the Cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>racters of the <hi>Chinois</hi> in regard of the excellent terms, and phrases their Language affords, either (to use <hi>Semedo's</hi> words) for delivering of their minds with respect, submission, or in ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plause of anothers merits, are still in such re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quest, and so great estimation amongst them,
<pb n="201" facs="tcp:41214:107"/>
as that those forty eight letters, howsoever they be more commodious to express their con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceipts are little regarded in comparison, but by way of contempt accounted, and called the wo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mens Lettes. As <hi>Christo. Barri</hi> a late <hi>Italian</hi> Wri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter <note place="margin">C. Barri in Cochin-Ch. cap. 6. M. Mart. Atl. Sin pa. 5.</note> in his <hi>Cochin-China</hi> asserts.</p>
            <p>Secondly <hi>Generality,</hi> Whereunto may be said, it is a matter exceeding all admiration, that a people whose numbers of all sorts consists of not fewer than two hundred Millions of soules; whose Empire contains of Continent at least two millions, five hundred ninety two thousand square miles, should understand one and the same Character, and that the self same Character should be in use amongst them. either in M. S. or printed Books, for more than three thousand seven hundred years. Certainly it seems impossi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble it should be thus, and certainly thus it is, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out some peculiar care of Divine Power.</p>
            <p>Neither are their Characters understood throughout their whole Empire only, how far and wide soever it now extends, and by those people generally that were in time either Colo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nies <note place="margin">A. Kirch Ch. Ill. pa 6. pag. 2 G. Men Hist. del lib. 3. p 140, 14</note> of theirs, or conquered by them, as the <hi>Ia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ponians, Coreans, Laios,</hi> those of <hi>Tonchin,</hi> and <hi>Sumatra,</hi> with the Kingdom of <hi>Cochin-China;</hi> but several other bordering Countries and Islands also, although in speaking them, they understand one another no more than <hi>Greeks</hi> do <hi>Dutchmen.</hi> Because reading the Characters depravedly, they pronounce them in a different manner, <hi>alio atque</hi> 
               <note place="margin">M. Mart. Atl. Sin. p. 147.</note> 
               <hi>alio ab iis legantur modo,</hi> as <hi>Martinius</hi> hath it, which more confirms, that those people that read and pronounce the Letters truly, speak the
<pb n="202" facs="tcp:41214:108"/>
Language purely; and that could those foreign Nations read them rightly, they might not only speak the <hi>Chinique</hi> Language perfectly, but also understand one another plainly, in regard the speech continueth incorruptedly in the Charact<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er.</p>
            <p>And hence it is that <hi>Mendoza</hi> telleth us, that in <hi>China</hi> letters missive ready written and acco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>modated to all affairs, are publiquely to be sold by every Book-seller in his shop, whether they be to be sent to persons of Honour, or inferiour de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gree, or for to supplicate, reprehend, or recom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mend, or any other intents whatever occasion requires, although it be to challenge one another to the field, so that the buyer hath no more to do, than to subscribe, seal and send them to the place intended at his pleasure.</p>
            <p>But their way of writing, is different from all other Nations of the world. For, whereas the <hi>Hebrews, Chaldaeans, Syrians, Arabians,</hi> and <hi>Ae<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gyptians</hi> write from the right to the left, and the <hi>Greeks, Latins,</hi> and other people of <hi>Europe,</hi> from the left to the right. The <hi>Chinois</hi> draw their Characters from the top downwards, as by An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiquity Hieroglyphicks were accustomed to be written, Their first perpendicular line neverthe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>less beginning on the right hand of the page. And in their writing they observe such equal distances, that there cannot be any thing more exact.</p>
            <p>Thirdly, Modesty of Expression; for it much reflects upon the <hi>Hebrew,</hi> as to the Antiquity thereof especially, that there are in it many som<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>what obscene words; whereas by all learned men, it is presumed that the PRIMITIVE
<pb n="203" facs="tcp:41214:108"/>
Language, was an harmless and in nothing im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>modest speech; but as innocent as the time in which it was at first infused into Mankind. <hi>Verba parùm honesta (qualia in omnibus linguis aliqua)</hi> 
               <note place="margin">M. Casaub. de 4 ling. pag. 28.</note> 
               <hi>objicit Nyssenus,</hi> the <hi>Hebrew</hi> hath words scarcesly honest, saith <hi>Nyssenus,</hi> in his objection against it, as in <hi>M. Casaubon;</hi> who had he been acquainted with the <hi>Chinique</hi> Tongue, might have spared his <hi>Parenthesis.</hi> For <hi>Semedo</hi> will assure you, that the <hi>Chinois</hi> with great advantage exceed in this, for they are most modest in whatever they write, <note place="margin">A. Sem. Rel. de la Cin. par. 1. cap. 11.</note> and very rarely in their Verses (which in all other Languages are more or less lascivious) is a loose word to be found; and what is more, they have not any Character whereby to write the privy parts, neither are they found written in any, or in any part of any, of all their Books. And from what cause happily this may proceed, hath been remembred before.</p>
            <p>Under this head we may also add, that the <hi>Hebrews</hi> are very famous for their honorable terms towards others, and humble towards themselves. As <hi>Iacob</hi> said unto his Brother <hi>E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sau, Let my Lord, I pray thee, pass over before his servant.</hi> Gen. 33. v. 14. <hi>Thy servant our father is in good health,</hi> said the Brothers of <hi>Ioseph</hi> to him. <hi>Gen.</hi> 43. <hi>v.</hi> 28. And, <hi>thy servants shall bring down the gray hayrs of thy servant our father with sorrow to the grave.</hi> Gen. 44. v. 31. For which the <hi>Chinois</hi> 
               <note place="margin">A. Sem. Rel. de la Cin. par. 1. cap. 12.</note> are no less famous also. The son speaking to his fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, saith, his <hi>Young son,</hi> though he be the eldest &amp; married; the servant to his Master styleth himself <hi>Slave.</hi> In speaking one with another, they al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ways do it with expressions of Honour, as
<pb n="204" facs="tcp:41214:109"/>
amongst us, <hi>Sir,</hi> your <hi>Worship,</hi> and the like. Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sides, even to inferior and ordinary people, they give an honorable name; as, a servant, if he be grave, they call, <hi>The great Master of the House;</hi> and we are taught, that <hi>Ioseph</hi> termed his Steward, <hi>The Ruler of his House,</hi> Gen. 43. v. 16. We read likewise, that <hi>Abraham</hi> called his wife <hi>Sister,</hi> say<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, <hi>She is my sister,</hi> Gen. 20. ver. 2. And, <hi>Take no care my sister,</hi> said old <hi>Tobit</hi> to his wife, <hi>Tob. 5. v.</hi> 20. And if a <hi>Chinois</hi> speaks unto a woman, though she be not of any kin to him, he calls her, <hi>Sister-in-law.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>In like manner the <hi>Hebrew</hi> is much celebra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted, for the mysterious significations of the pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per names of men, in which Prophetical pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dictions were contained; and which <hi>Goropius</hi> in his <hi>Indo-Scythia,</hi> saith, the first <hi>Hebrews,</hi> might either by interpretation from the PRIMI<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>TIVE Language, or new imposition assign un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to them. But though <hi>Moses</hi> might receive by Tradition from his Ancestors, that in the FIRST speech, names were thus mystically imposed; nevertheless, that by Divine Revelation he might so record them also, there is no doubt to be made. As; that <hi>Adam</hi> signified <hi>Red Earth,</hi> out of which he was created. <hi>Eve,</hi> that she should be the <hi>Mother of all living: Lamech,</hi> that he was to be the first, that should infringe the <hi>Rites of Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trimony</hi> instituted by God, in having two wives: <hi>Phaleg,</hi> that in his days the <hi>Earth</hi> should be di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vided. Now, what these Scripture names may signifie in the <hi>Chinique</hi> Tongue; or whether yea or no, they have any such; or how the names of the Fathers of their first Families be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
<pb n="205" facs="tcp:41214:109"/>
they came to be governed by a Monarch may correspond to them, I leave unto the <hi>Chinique Lit terati.</hi> For, to have acquainted you with the af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>finity between the names of <hi>Noah,</hi> and <hi>Iaus</hi> suf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficeth us.</p>
            <p>But I am not to forget, that, as in the PRI<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>MITIVE, so likewise in the Language of <hi>China</hi> the proper names of men have mysterious significations in them, <hi>Martinius</hi> in his History and <hi>Atlas</hi> will ascertain you. For, their sixth Emperour was called <hi>Cous</hi> as foretelling the eminent vertue he should be endued withall: <hi>Faus</hi> at his attaining the Crown changed his name and would be called <hi>Uus,</hi> as giving his subjects to understand thereby, what a warlike and valiant Prince, they should find him to be: <hi>Ngayus</hi> would at his coming to the Throne take upon him the name of <hi>Pingus,</hi> i. e. <hi>Pacificus,</hi> as if inspired that CHRIST the true Paci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fique King should during his reign be born: And <hi>Chingus</hi> was called <hi>Xius,</hi> which name the <hi>Chi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nois</hi> afterwards found too truly imposed; for he observed no moderation in any thing, being sometimes vertuous, sometimes vicious, equally valiant and cruel.</p>
            <p>Besides not only of their Kings and Great <note place="margin">Purch.

               <pb n="206" facs="tcp:41214:110"/>
us, that it was of old called <hi>Than,</hi> as being un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bounded and without limits; then <hi>Yu,</hi> as the place of rest and quietness; afterwards <hi>Hia,</hi> as much to say, as <hi>Great;</hi> then again <hi>Sciam,</hi> as enriched with all things; then <hi>Cheu,</hi> a place of perfection; but pretermitting others, <hi>Han</hi> signifies the milky way in Heaven. For, from all Antiquity it hath been customary with them, when any new family came unto the Crown, according to the mystical signification of the proper name thereof, to give a new name unto the Empire.</p>
            <p>Fourthly, the <hi>Utility;</hi> for, the Language of <hi>China</hi> affordeth us, the Acknowledgment of one only true God; Theology taught by <hi>Noah;</hi> Predictions of CHRIST in exotique Regi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons many Centuries of years before his Incarna<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion: devout Ejaculations, such, as cannot (Oh the shame!) among Christians without difficulty be found; eloquent Orations, fuch, as nor <hi>Greek</hi> nor <hi>Roman</hi> oratory exceeds; Warlike Strata<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gems, such, as <hi>Hannibal</hi> and <hi>Fabius</hi> were, and the greatest Captains are to learn: Valour giving place to none; Physick not to be paral<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leld by any; Agriculture surmounting all: The Mathematiques; Mechaniques; Morality; I cannot have words for all unless from <hi>China.</hi> But if <hi>ex ungue Leonem,</hi> from the claw the greatness of the Lion may be judged; then, for Policy in government, Rules for Magistrates, Lawes for People, not executed negligently like ours (in <hi>Europe)</hi> as if no matter whether yea or no they were ever made, neither Empire, nor Kingdom, nor Commonwealth ever or at this
<pb n="207" facs="tcp:41214:110"/>
day<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> known, can be brought to stand in com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>petition with the Monarchy of <hi>China.</hi> Whereby, since her dominion became successive (the inconsiderable duration of the Western <hi>Tartars</hi> set aside) she hath enjoyed the same in a continued succession of Monarchs of her own blood, three thousand eight hundred fifty one years, accompting to the year of CHRIST one thousand six hundred forty four, at which time the now <hi>Tartars</hi> took posession of her Throne.</p>
            <p>Fifthly, and lastly the <hi>Brevity. Lasua Brevità la fa aequivocà, mà per l'istessa causa compendiosa;</hi> The Brevity of the <hi>Chinique</hi> Language makes it <note place="margin">A. Sem. Rel de la Ciu. par. 1. c, 6.</note> aequivocal, but for the same reason compendious, saith <hi>Semedo.</hi> Whereby we may observe, that the Aequivocableness which is said to be so dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficult and troublesome to strangers, is even by strangers themselves celebrated; and in regard of the compendiousness most acceptable and pleasingly welcome to the <hi>Chinois,</hi> who are very particular affectors of brevity in speech. Insomuch that our Author is of opinion, that they were either imitators of (which because they are far more antient they could not be) or imitated by the <hi>Lacedaemonians.</hi> And elsewhere he conceives, that <hi>Lycurgus</hi> had his Law for prohibiting the access of strangers into his Commonwealth from <hi>China.</hi> Wherefore, and in regard that <hi>Plutarch</hi> finds him to have been in <hi>India,</hi> and to have con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferred with the Gymnosophists there, we may presume to think, that <hi>Lycurgus</hi> during his forien travails was in <hi>China</hi> likewise, and adorned his Laws not only with those customes of theirs, but
<pb n="208" facs="tcp:41214:111"/>
also several others the like, as they are by <hi>Plu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tarch</hi> in his life recorded, though nothing in relation thereunto can otherwise be collected out of the Histories of the <hi>Greeks.</hi> And why? For that the Lawgivers of the Antients, <hi>Lycurgus, Solon</hi> and the rest, amongst the <hi>Graecians;</hi> as also <hi>Numa</hi> among the <hi>Romans</hi> were too politique, and ambitious of glory, to proclaim from whence really they derived their knowledg; whilst one must have his <hi>Aegeria,</hi> another his <hi>Pyrhioness;</hi> so <hi>Mahomet</hi> had his Dove, &amp; <hi>Fohius</hi> his Dragon, who because his <hi>Chinois</hi> reputed the sight of that Creature to be a great <hi>Omen</hi> of Felicity, per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>swaded <note place="margin">M. Mart. Sin. hist. lib. 1. p. 22.</note> them into a beleef, that he took the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vention of his Characters, and their use, from the back of a Dragon, as it came out of the wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter, that by a Prodigy the greater estima<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion might be set upon his new Art. And in like manner, as most Law-givers have fathered their Laws upon one Deity or other, the more to <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">
                  <desc>•…</desc>
               </gap>onfirm the people in an awful reverence of them, and their institutions.</p>
            <p>But if the <hi>Brevity</hi> of a Language be a remarque of the PRIMITIVE Tongue, as it is assert<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed to be; the <hi>Chinique</hi> seemeth to surpass all o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther Nations of the World therein. For as there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by, the Aequivocableness is enriched with com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pendiousness, so is the compendiousness beauti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fied with gracefulness and sweetness, beyond in a manner all Example. To which purpose <hi>Semedo</hi> proceeds, saying, <hi>con esser lingua eosi limitata, è tanto dolce, che quasi supera tutte l'altre che conoscia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mo,</hi> that by being so succinct a Language, it is so sweet, that it exceedeth, as it were all others that
<pb n="209" facs="tcp:41214:111"/>
we know. And that we might not acquiesce in a single testimony, <hi>Nieuhoff</hi> assureth us also, <hi>La Brievete de cette Langue est si agreable, quej'oserois</hi> 
               <note place="margin">I. Nieuh. l'Amb. Or. par. 2. p. 13.</note>

            <p>Now to give a Language the first or <hi>primier</hi> rank, as to succinct <hi>Sweetness,</hi> and graceful <hi>Brevity</hi> is a great step towards the granting of it to be, the PRIMITIVE Language; Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sidering which, together with the exemplary <hi>Utility;</hi> remarkeable <hi>Modesty;</hi> admirable <hi>Gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rality;</hi> great <hi>Simplicity,</hi> and high <hi>Antiquity;</hi> we may from these Arguments almost dare to af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firm, that the Language of the Empire of <hi>China</hi> is the PRIMITIVE Language. But, having moreover found <hi>Noah</hi> to have lived both before and after the flood in <hi>China,</hi> and that <hi>Their</hi> speech hath from all Antiquity been in one and the same Character preserved in books to this day; which is such a <hi>plea,</hi> as can be drawn up and entred, for no other Nation under Heaven, since the Crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of the World besides; we may more than almost dare to affirm, that the <hi>Chinois</hi> have obtained a ful and final <hi>decree,</hi> for the settlement of this <hi>Their</hi> claim to the FIRST of Lan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guages without all farther dispute.</p>
            <p>Now, as for consent of Authors to strengthen our Assertion. It may be demanded, what con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sent of Authors <hi>H<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">
                     <desc>•…</desc>

               </hi> had, that first found out there were <hi>Antipodes;</hi> or <hi>He</hi> that first discovered the <hi>Circulation</hi> of the blood? Thos<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">

               </gap> that so ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>solutely

pin their beliefe upon the shoulders of such consent; are, we may say, like sheep; whi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther <hi>one</hi> leads, the rest <hi>all</hi> run, without weighing whether the right or wrong way be taken; so that many times they bring not only themselves, but also their followers into errours, who by their prevarication the more encrease them. But what consent of Authors can be expected? The <hi>Scripture</hi> teacheth, That the whole World was drowned; <hi>Noah</hi> and his family being saved only: <hi>Authors</hi> consent, that at the same time <hi>China</hi> was drowned; some few only escaping on a mountain there. The <hi>Scripture,</hi> That <hi>Nim<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rod</hi> came from the <hi>East</hi> to the valley of <hi>Shinaar: Authors,</hi> That in the <hi>East</hi> divers Nations were planted before <hi>Nimrod</hi> came to the valley of <hi>Shinaar.</hi> The <hi>Scripture,</hi> That from the flood until the <hi>Confusion of Tongues,</hi> the whole Earth was of one Language: <hi>Authors,</hi> That from the flood until that <hi>Confusion,</hi> that Language was universally common, as well to <hi>Those,</hi> that were in the <hi>East,</hi> as <hi>Those,</hi> that were at <hi>Babel.</hi> The <hi>Scripture,</hi> That the Language of <hi>Those</hi> only that were at <hi>Babel,</hi> was confounded: <hi>Authors,</hi> That the Language of <hi>Those,</hi> that were before planted in the <hi>East</hi> was not confounded. And all of them unanimoufly consent, that <hi>China</hi> was planted before the <hi>Confusion of Tongues;</hi> and that at this day the <hi>Chinois</hi> use the same Language, and have the same Letters, as when at first they were planted, and became a People.</p>
            <p>We have for many years heard many discourses of this extreme part of <hi>Asta;</hi> many relations have been published thereof; and many learned
<pb n="211" facs="tcp:41214:112"/>
men conceived those relations to be fabulous; suspecting as it were the Providence of God, that any people should live upon the Earthly Globe, in so great happiness, in so great felicity, so many thousands of years unknown. But of late, what through the unconquerable patience of <hi>Those,</hi> that contemning all difficulties and perils, have adventured to conquer Idolatry, and advance the standard of <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">

Scarcely twelve moneths since I say, wherefore perhaps, as yet they are not so much as turned over by those that have procured them. Let them be read, perused, and studied, and then it will be found, <hi>Authors</hi> have so far consented; That if the <hi>Chinique</hi> Tongue be not the PRIMITIVE, I might, for my own particular, consent with that great Dictator of learning <hi>H. Grotius.</hi> 
               <q>That the first speech which men used before the <note place="margin">

<pb n="212" facs="tcp:41214:113"/>
so great consent already both of sacred <hi>Scripture,</hi> and unquestionable <hi>Authors,</hi> that we may well conclude, until as full consent, and as great cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainty be produced for any other, the Language of the Empire of <hi>CHINA</hi> is the PRIMI<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>TIVE Language.</p>
