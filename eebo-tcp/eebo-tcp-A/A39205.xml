            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

               </l>
               <l>A Knowing Chimiſt, as this Age afforded</l>
               <l>And will in after-times ſtand ſo recorded:</l>
               <l>The gift of Healing, Heavens did him Bleſſe,</l>
               <l>What others fail'd in, he did ſoon redreſſe;</l>
               <l>Unwearied was the pains that he did take</l>
               <l>To make good Medicine for poor Mortals ſake;</l>
               <l>Then lets Lament, of him we are bereft,</l>
               <l>There is but few now like him, that are left.</l>
               <l>His ſolid Judgment is Philoſophy,</l>
               <l>His learned Books doth plainly teſtifie;</l>
               <l>He knew moſt Plants, their Vertues, what they were,</l>
               <l>And Minerals extracted with great care.</l>
               <l>He was Experienc'd in Anatomy,</l>
               <l>As his Diſſections well can verifie;</l>
               <l>For he it was that firſt a Spleen did take,</l>
               <l>Out of a Dog a tryal for to make;</l>
               <l>Which to the World did ſatisfaction give,</l>
               <l>How that a Creature, without a <hi>Spleen</hi> might live.</l>
               <l>Two monſtrous ſtones reſiding nigh the part</l>
               <l>Of <hi>Collick</hi> Gut, he brought out by his Art;</l>
               <l>And is admir'd by thoſe that do them ſee,</l>
               <l>How two ſuch ſtones ſhould in the Body be.</l>
               <l>The <hi>Plague</hi> in ſixty five, he did Diſſect,</l>
               <l>A <hi>Peſtilentian</hi> Body with reſpect</l>
               <l>To ſave mankind out of the Jaws of Death</l>
               <l>That every hour was then bereav'd of Breath.</l>
               <l>His own he hazarded, to ſave his Neighbours Life</l>
               <l>For Wife her Husband, and for the Husband Wife.</l>
               <l>The Parent, and the Child praiſe to God gave,</l>
               <l>That by his means were ſav'd from the Grave.</l>
               <l>And ſhall we let this worthy Doctor dye,</l>
               <l>And not beſtow on him an Elegy,</l>
               <l>His great Abilities was plainly ſhown,</l>
               <l>That he was only amongſt the knowing, known.</l>
               <l>He was a Loyal ſufferer for the King,</l>
               <l>Which at that time did perſecution bring.</l>
               <l>A right good Chriſtian liv'd, and ſo did die:</l>
               <l>For that's the true (<hi>Religio Medici,</hi>)</l>
               <l>His Charity unto the World was known,</l>

               <l>Now this good Man, muſt here no longer ſtay,</l>
               <l>For they are taken from the Evil day.</l>
               <l>For he is mounted up on heavenly wings</l>
               <l>To ſing forth Praiſes with the King of Kings.</l>
               <l>Eas'd of his Labours, Sickneſs, and his Pain,</l>
               <l>He's now made Happy, for Death to him his gain.</l>
               <l>What needs more words, a future World he ſought,</l>
               <l>And ſet the Pomp and Pride of this at naught.</l>
               <l>Heaven was his aim, let Heaven be ſtill their Station,</l>
