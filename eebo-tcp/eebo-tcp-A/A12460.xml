         <editorialDecl>
            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            <head>A DESCRIPTION OF
New-England, by Captaine
Iohn Smith.</head>
            <p>
               <seg rend="decorInit">I</seg>N the moneth of Aprill,<note place="margin">My firſt voy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>age to new-England.</note> 1614.
with two Ships from <hi>London,</hi> of
a few Marchants, I chanced to ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riue
in <hi>New-England,</hi> a parte of
<hi>Ameryca,</hi> at the Ile of <hi>Monahig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gan,</hi>
in 43 of Northerly lati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tude:
our plot was there to take Whales and make
tryalls of a Myne of Gold and Copper. If thoſe fai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led,
Fiſh and Furres was then our refuge, to make
our ſelues ſauers howſoeuer: we found this Whale<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fiſhing
a coſtly concluſion: we ſaw many, and ſpent
much time in chaſing them; but could not kill any:
They beeing a kinde of Iubartes, and not the
Whale that yeeldes Finnes and Oyle as wee expec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted.
For our Golde, it was rather the Maſters de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uice
to get a voyage that proiected it, then any
knowledge hee had at all of any ſuch matter. Fiſh
&amp; Furres was now our guard: &amp; by our late arriual,
and long lingring about the Whale, the prime of
both thoſe ſeaſons were paſt ere wee perceiued it;
we thinking that their ſeaſons ſerued at all times:
<pb n="2" facs="tcp:11424:10"/>
but wee found it otherwiſe; for, by the midſt
of Iune, the fiſhing failed. Yet in Iuly and Auguſt
ſome was taken, but not ſufficient to defray ſo great
a charge as our ſtay required. Of dry fiſh we made
about 40000. of Cor fiſh about 7000. Whileſt
the ſailers fiſhed, my ſelfe with eight or nine others
of them might beſt bee ſpared; Ranging the coaſt
in a ſmall boat, wee got for trifles neer 1100 Beuer
ſkinnes, 100 Martins, and neer as many Otters;
and the moſt of them within the diſtance of twenty
leagues. We ranged the Coaſt both Eaſt and Weſt
much furder; but Eaſtwards our commodities were
not eſteemed, they were ſo neare the French who af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fords
them better: and right againſt vs in the Main
was a Ship of Sir <hi>Frances Popphames,</hi> that had there
ſuch acquaintance, hauing many yeares vſed onely
that porte, that the moſt parte there was had by
him. And 40 leagues weſtwards were two French
Ships, that had made there a great voyage by trade,
during the time wee tryed thoſe concluſions, not
knowing the Coaſt, nor Saluages habitation. With
theſe Furres, the Traine, and Cor-fiſh I returned
for <hi>England</hi> in the Bark: where within ſix monthes
after our departure from the <hi>Downes,</hi> we ſafe arriued
back. The beſt of this fiſh was ſolde for fiue pound
the hundreth, the reſt by ill vſage betwixt three
pound and fifty ſhillings. The other Ship ſtaied to
fit herſelfe for <hi>Spaine</hi> with the dry fiſh which was
ſould, by the Sailers reporte that returned, at forty
ryalls the quintall, each hundred weighing two
quintalls and a halfe.</p>

               <hi>New England</hi> is that part of <hi>America</hi> in the O<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cean

Southwardes is <hi>Virginia,</hi> and all the ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ioyning

New Andoloſia</hi> and the <hi>Weſt Indies.</hi> Now becauſe
I haue beene ſo oft aſked ſuch ſtrange queſtions, of
the goodneſſe and greatneſſe of thoſe ſpatious
Tracts of land, how they can bee thus long vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>known,
or nor poſſeſſed by the <hi>Spaniard,</hi> and ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny
ſuch like demands; I intreat your pardons, if
I chance to be too plaine, or tedious in relating
my knowledge for plaine mens ſatiſfaction.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Florida</hi> is the next adioyning to the <hi>Indes,</hi>
               <note place="margin">Notes of Flo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rida.</note> which
vnproſperously was attempted to bee planted by
the <hi>French.</hi> A Country farre bigger then <hi>England,
Scotland, France</hi> and <hi>Ireland,</hi> yet little knowne to
any Chriſtian, but by the wonderful endeuours of
<hi>Ferdinando de Soto</hi> a valiant <hi>Spaniard:</hi> whoſe wri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tings
in this age is the beſt guide knowne to ſearch
thoſe parts.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Virginia</hi> is no Ile (as many doe imagine) but
part of the Continent adioyning to <hi>Florida;</hi>
               <note place="margin">Notes of Vir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginia.</note> whoſe
bounds may be ſtretched to the magnitude there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of
without offence to any Chriſtian inhabitant.
For from the degrees of 30. to 45. his Maieſtie
hath granted his Letters parents, the Coaſt exten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding
South-weſt and North-eaſt aboute 1500
<pb n="4" facs="tcp:11424:11"/>
miles; but to follow it aboard, the ſhore may well
be 2000. at the leaſt: of which, 20. miles is the
moſt giues entrance into the Bay of <hi>Chiſapeak,</hi>
where is the <hi>London</hi> plantation: within which is
a Country (as you may perceiue by the deſcription
in a Booke and Map printed in my name of that
little I there diſcouered) may well ſuffice 300000
people to inhabit. And Southward adioyneth
that part diſcouered at the charge of Sir <hi>Walter
Rawley,</hi> by Sir <hi>Ralph Lane,</hi> and that learned Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thematician
M<hi rend="sup">r</hi>. <hi>Thomas Heryot.</hi> Northward ſix or
ſeauen degrees is the Riuer <hi>Sadagahock,</hi> where was
planted the Weſterne Colony, by that Honoura<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble
Patrone of vertue Sir <hi>Iohn Poppham</hi> Lord chief
Iuſtice of <hi>England.</hi> Ther is alſo a relation prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted
by Captaine <hi>Bartholomew Goſnould,</hi> of <hi>Eliza<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>beths
Iles:</hi> and an other by Captaine <hi>Waymoth,</hi> of
<hi>Pemmaquid.</hi> From all theſe diligent obſeruers, po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſterity
may be bettered by the fruits of their la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bours.
But for diuers others that long before and
ſince haue ranged thoſe parts, within a kenning
ſometimes of the ſhore, ſome touching in one
place ſome in another, I muſt entreat them pardon
me for omitting them; or if I offend in ſaying
that their true deſcriptions are concealed, or neuer
well obſerued, or died with the Authors: ſo that
the Coaſt is yet ſtill but euen as a Coaſt vnknowne
and vndiſcouered. I haue had ſix or ſeauen ſeuerall
plots of thoſe Northren parts, ſo vnlike each to
other, and moſt ſodiffering from any true propor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion,
or reſemblance of the Countrey, as they did
<pb n="5" facs="tcp:11424:11"/>
mee no more good, then ſo much waſte paper,
though they coſt me more. It may be it was not
my chance to ſee the beſt; but leaſt others may be
deceiued as I was, or through dangerous ignorance
hazard themſelues as I did, I haue drawen a
Map from Point to Point, Ile to Ile, and Harbour
to Harbour, with the Soundings, Sands, Rocks, &amp;
Land-marks as I paſſed cloſe aboard the Shore in a
little Boat; although there bemany things to bee
obſerued which the haſte of other affaires did cauſe
me omit: for, being ſent more to get preſent com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>modities,
then knowledge by diſcoueries for any
future good, I had not power to ſearch as I would:
yet it will ſerue to direct any ſhall goe that waies,
to ſafe Harbours and the Saluages habitations:
What marchandize and commodities for their la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bour
they may finde, this following diſcourse ſhall
plainely demonſtrate.</p>
            <p>Thus you may ſee, of this 2000. miles more
then halfe is yet vnknowne to any purpoſe: no not
ſo much as the borders of the Sea are yet certainly
diſcouered. As for the goodnes and true ſubſtan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces
of the Land, wee are for moſt part yet altoge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
ignorant of them, vnleſſe it bee thoſe parts a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout
the Bay of <hi>Chiſapeack</hi> and <hi>Sagadahock:</hi> but
onely here and there wee touched or haue ſeene a
little the edges of thoſe large dominions, which
doe ſtretch themſelues into the Maine, God doth
know how many thouſand miles; whereof we can
yet no more iudge, then a ſtranger that ſaileth be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>twixt
<hi>England</hi> and <hi>France</hi> can deſcribe the Harbors
<pb n="6" facs="tcp:11424:12"/>
and dangers by landing here or there in ſome Ri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uer
or Bay, tell thereby the goodneſſe and ſubſtan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces
of <hi>Spaine, Italy, Germany, Bohemia, Hungaria</hi> &amp;
the reſt. By this you may perceiue how much they
erre, that think euery one w<hi rend="sup">ch</hi> hath bin at <hi>Virginia</hi>
vnderſtandeth or knowes what <hi>Virginia</hi> is: Or that
the <hi>Spaniards</hi> know one halfe quarter of thoſe Ter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritories
they poſſeſſe; no, not ſo much as the true
circumference of <hi>Terra Incognita,</hi> whoſe large do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minions
may equalize the greatneſſe and goodnes
of <hi>America,</hi> for any thing yet known. It is ſtrange
with what ſmall power hee hath raigned in the
<hi>East Indes;</hi> and few will vnderſtand the truth of
his ſtrength in <hi>America:</hi> where he hauing ſo much
to keepe with ſuch a pampered force, they neede
not greatly feare his furie, in the <hi>Bermudas,
Virginia, New France,</hi> or <hi>New England;</hi> beyond
whoſe bounds <hi>America</hi> doth ſtretch many
thouſand miles: into the frozen partes whereof
one Maſter <hi>Hutſon</hi> an Engliſh Mariner did make
the greateſt diſcouerie of any Chriſtian I knowe
of, where he vnfortunately died. For <hi>Affrica,</hi> had
not the induſtrious Portugales ranged her vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>knowne
parts, who would haue ſought for wealth
among thoſe fryed Regions of blacke brutiſh Ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gers,
where not withſtanding all the wealth and ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mirable
aduentures &amp; endeauours more then 140
yeares, they knowe not one third of thoſe blacke
habitations. But it is not a worke for euery one, to
manage ſuch an affaire as makes a diſcouerie, and

            <p>Herring, Cod, and Ling, is that triplicitie that
makes their wealth &amp; ſhippings multiplicities, ſuch

and in this faculty they are ſo naturalized, and of

if their Land were cultured, planted and manured

what hope is there, or what neede they doubt,
hauing thoſe aduantages of the Sea, but it might

is chiefly but in Iune and Iuly: whereas it is heere
in March, Aprill, May, September, October, and

            <p>But,<note place="margin">A deſcription of the Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tries in particu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lar, and their ſituations.</note> to returne a little more to the particulars
of this Countrey, which I intermingle thus with
my proiects and reaſons, not being ſo ſufficiently
yet acquainted in thoſe parts, to write fully the
eſtate of the Sea, the Ayre, the Land, the Fruites,
the Rocks, the People, the Gouernment, Religion,
Territories, and Limitations, Friends, and Foes:
but, as I gathered from the niggardly relations in a
broken language to my vnderſtanding, during
the time I ranged thoſe Countries &amp;c. The moſt
Northren part I was at, was the Bay of <hi>Pennob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcot,</hi>
which is Eaſt and Weſt, North and South,
more then ten leagues: but ſuch were my occaſions,
I was conſtrained to be ſatisfied of them I found
in the Bay, that the Riuer ranne farre vp into the
Land, and was well inhabited with many people,
but they were from their habitations, either fiſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
<pb n="24" facs="tcp:11424:21"/>
among the Iles, or hunting the Lakes and
Woods, for Deer and Beners. The Bay is full of
great Ilands, of one, two, ſix, eight, or ten miles in
length, which diuides it into many faire and excel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lent
good harbours. On the Eaſt of it, are the <hi>Tar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rantines,</hi>
their mortall enemies, where inhabit the
<hi>French,</hi> as they report that liue with thoſe people,
as one nation or family. And Northweſt of <hi>Pen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nobſcot</hi>
is <hi>Mecaddacut,</hi> at the foot of a high moun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taine,
a kinde of fortreſſe againſt the <hi>Tarrantines,</hi>
adioyning to the high mountaines of <hi>Pennobſcot,</hi>
againſt whoſe feet doth beat the Sea: But ouer all
the Land, Iles, or other impediments, you may
well ſee them ſixteene or eighteene leagues from
their ſituation. <hi>Segocket</hi> is the next; then <hi>Nuſconcus,
Pemmaquid,</hi> and <hi>Sagadahock.</hi> Vp this Riuer where
was the Weſterne plantation are <hi>Aumuckcawgen,
Kinnebeck,</hi> and diuers others, where there is plan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted
ſome corne fields. Along this Riuer 40 or 50
miles, I ſaw nothing but great high cliffes of bar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ren
Rocks, ouergrowne with wood: but where
the Saluages dwelt there the ground is exceeding
fat &amp; fertill. Weſtward of this Riuer, is the Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trey
of <hi>Aucociſco,</hi> in the bottome of a large deepe
Bay, full of many great Iles, which diuides it into
many good harbours. <hi>Sowocotuck</hi> is the next, in
the edge of a large ſandy Bay, which hath many
Rocks and Iles, but few good harbours, but for
Barks, I yet know. But all this Coaſt to <hi>Pennob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcot,</hi>
and as farre I could ſee Eaſtward of it is no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing
but ſuch high craggy Cliffy Rocks &amp; ſtony
<pb n="25" facs="tcp:11424:21"/>
Iles that I wondered ſuch great trees could growe
vpon ſo hard foundations. It is a Countrie rather
to affright, then delight one. And how to deſcribe a
more plaine ſpectacle of deſolation or more barren
I knowe not. Yet the Sea there is the ſtrangeſt fiſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pond
I euer ſaw; and thoſe barren Iles ſo furniſhed
with good woods, ſprings, fruits, fiſh, and foule,
that it makes mee thinke though the Coaſt be roc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kie,
and thus affrightable; the Vallies, Plaines, and
and interior parts, may well (notwithſtanding) be
verie fertile. But there is no kingdome ſo fertile hath
not ſome part barren: and <hi>New England</hi> is great e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nough,
to make many Kingdomes and Countries,
were it all inhabited. As you paſſe the Coaſt ſtill
Weſtward, <hi>Accominticus</hi> and <hi>Paſſataquack</hi> are two
conuenient harbors for ſmall barks; and a good
Countrie, within their craggie cliffs. <hi>Angoam</hi> is the
next; This place might content a right curious
iudgement: but there are many ſands at the en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trance
of the harbor: and the worſt is, it is inbay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
too farre from the deepe Sea. Heere are many
riſing hilles, and on their tops and deſcents many
corne fields, and delightfull groues. On the Eaſt,
is an Ile of two or three leagues in length; the one
halfe, plaine moriſh graſſe fit for paſture, with ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny
faire high groues of mulberrie trees gardens:
and there is alſo Okes, Pines, and other woods to
make this place an excellent habitation, beeing a
good and ſafe harbor.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Naimkeck</hi> though it be more rockie ground (for
<hi>Angoam</hi> is ſandie) not much inferior; neither for the
<pb n="26" facs="tcp:11424:22"/>
harbor, nor any thing I could perceiue, but the
multitude of people. From hence doth ſtretch in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to
the Sea the faire headland <hi>Tragabigzanda,</hi> fronted
with three Iles called the three <hi>Turks heads:</hi> to the
North of this, doth enter a great Bay, where wee
founde ſome habitations and corne fields: they re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>port
a great Riuer, and at leaſt thirtie habitations,
doo poſſeſſe this Countrie. But becauſe the <hi>French</hi>
had got their Trade, I had no leaſure to diſcouer it.
The Iles of <hi>Mattahunts</hi> are on the Weſt ſide of this
Bay, where are many Iles, and queſtionleſſe good
harbors: and then the Countrie of the <hi>Maſſachu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſets,</hi>
which is the Paradiſe of all thoſe parts: for,
heere are many Iles all planted with corne; groues,
mulberries, ſaluage gardens, and good harbors:
the Coaſt is for the moſt part, high clayie ſandie
cliffs. The Sea Coaſt as you paſſe, ſhewes you all
along large corne fields, and great troupes of well
proportioned people: but the <hi>French</hi> hauing re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mained
heere neere ſixe weekes, left nothing, for vs
to take occaſion to examine the inhabitants relati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons,
<hi>viz.</hi> if there be neer three thouſand people vp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
theſe Iles; and that the Riuer doth pearce many
daies iourneies the intralles of that Countrey. We
found the people in thoſe parts verie kinde; but in
their furie no leſſe valiant. For, vpon a quarrell wee
had with one of them, hee onely with three others
croſſed the harbor of <hi>Quonahaſsit</hi> to certaine rocks
whereby wee muſt paſſe; and there let flie their ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rowes
for our ſhot, till we were out of danger.</p>
            <p>Then come you to <hi>Accomack,</hi> an excellent good
<pb n="27" facs="tcp:11424:22"/>
harbor, good land; and no want of any thing, but
induſtrious people. After much kindneſſe, vpon a
ſmall occaſion, wee fought alſo with fortie or fif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie
of thoſe: though ſome were hurt, and ſome
ſlaine; yet within an houre after they became
friendes. <hi>Cape Cod</hi> is the next preſents it ſelfe:
which is onely a headland of high hils of ſand, ouer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>growne
with ſhrubbie pines, hurts, and ſuch traſh;
but an excellent harbor for all weathers. This <hi>Cape</hi>
is made by the maine Sea on the one ſide, and a
great Bay on the other in forme of a ſickle: on it
doth inhabit the people of <hi>Pawmet:</hi> and in the bot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tome
of the Bay, the people of <hi>Chawum.</hi> Towards
the South and Southweſt of this <hi>Cape,</hi> is found a
long and dangerous ſhoale of ſands and rocks. But
ſo farte as I incircled it, I found thirtie fadom wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
aboard the ſhore, and a ſtrong current: which
makes mee thinke there is a Channell about this
ſhoale; where is the beſt and greateſt fiſh to be had,
Winter and Summer, in all that Countrie. But, the
Saluages ſay there is no Channell, but that the
ſhoales beginne from the maine at <hi>Pawmet,</hi> to the
Ile of <hi>Nauſit;</hi> and ſo extends beyond their know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge
into the Sea. The next to this is <hi>Capawack,</hi>
and thoſe abounding Countries of copper, corne,
people, and mineralls; which I went to diſcouer
this laſt yeare: but becauſe I miſcarried by the way,
I will leaue them, till God pleaſe I haue better ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quaintance

of her youth, not in riots at home, but in dan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gers
abroade? and the iuſtice and iudgement out
of their experience, when they grewe aged. What
was their ruine and hurt, but this; The exceſſe of
idleneſſe, the fondneſſe of Parents, the want of ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perience
in Magiſtrates, the admiration of their

their vniuſt iealoſies, their politicke incredulities,
their hypocriticall ſeeming goodneſſe, and their

onely formall temporiſts, all that their predeceſſors
got in many years, they loſt in few daies. Thoſe by
their pains &amp; vertues became Lords of the world;

            <p>Then, who would liue at home idly (or thinke
in himſelfe any worth to liue) onely to eate, drink,

            <p>I would be ſory to offend, or that any ſhould

the maſter, and marchant, be well content
with this gaine? If a man worke but three dayes
in ſeauen, he may get more then hee can ſpend,
vnleſſe he will be exceſsiue. Now that Carpenter,
Maſon, Gardiner, Taylor, Smith, Sailer, Forgers,
or what other, may they not make this a pretty

hurt or charge then angling with a hooke, and
croſsing the ſweete ayre from Ile to Ile, ouer the

Thus, though all men be not fiſhers: yet all men,

            <p>I confeſſe, I could haue wiſhed them as many
thouſands, had all other prouiſions bin in like pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portion:
nor would I haue had ſo fewe, could I
haue had meanes for more: yet (would God haue
pleaſed wee had ſafely arriued) I neuer had the like
authoritie, freedom, and prouiſion, to doe ſo well.
The maine aſſiſtance next God, I had to this ſmall
number, was my acquaintance among the Salua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ges;
eſpecially, with <hi>Dohannida,</hi> one of their grea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teſt
Lords; who had liued long in <hi>England.</hi> By the
meanes of this proud Saluage, I did not doubt but
quickly to haue gotte that credit with the reſt of
his friends, and alliants, to haue had as many of
them, as I deſired in any deſigne I intended, and
that trade alſo they had, by ſuch a kind of exchange
<pb n="46" facs="tcp:11424:33"/>
of their Countrie commodities; which both with
eaſe &amp; ſecuritie in their ſeaſons may be vſed. With
him and diuerſe others, I had concluded to inhabit,
and defend them againſt the <hi>Terentynes;</hi> with a bet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
power then the <hi>French</hi> did them; whoſe tyranny
did inforce them to imbrace my offer, with no
ſmall deuotion. And though many may thinke me
more bolde then wiſe, in regard of their power,
dexteritie, treacherie, and inconſtancie, hauing ſo
deſperately aſſaulted &amp; betraied many others: I ſay
but this (becauſe with ſo many, I haue many times
done much more in <hi>Virginia,</hi> then I intended
heere, when I wanted that experience <hi>Virginia</hi>
taught me) that to mee it ſeemes no daunger more
then ordinarie. And though I know my ſelfe the
meaneſt of many thouſands, whoſe apprehenſiue
inſpection can pearce beyond the boundes of my
habilities, into the hidden things of Nature, Art,
and Reaſon: yet I intreate ſuch giue me leaue to ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cuſe
my ſelfe of ſo much imbecillitie, as to lay, that
in theſe eight yeares which I haue been conuerſant
with theſe affairs, I haue not learned there is a great
difference, betwixt the directions and iudgement
of experimentall knowledge, and the ſuperficiall
coniecture of variable relation: wherein rumor, hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mor,
or miſprision haue ſuch power, that oft times
one is enough to beguile twentie, but twentie not
ſufficient to keep one from being deceiued. There<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
I know no reaſon but to beleeue my own eies,
before any mans imagination, that is but wreſted
from the conceits of my owne proiects, and indea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uours.
<pb n="47" facs="tcp:11424:33"/>
But I honor, with all affection, the counſell
and inſtructions of iudiciall directions, or any other
honeſt aduertiſement; ſo farre to obſerue, as they
tie mee not to the crueltie of vnknowne euents.</p>
            <p>Theſe are the inducements that thus drew me
to neglect all other imployments, and ſpend my
time and beſt abilities in theſe aduentures. Where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in,
though I haue had many diſcouragements by
the ingratitude of ſome, the malicious ſlanders of
others, the falſeneſſe of friendes, the trechery of
cowards, and ſlowneſſe of aduenturers; but chief<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
by one <hi>Hunt,</hi> who was Maſter of the ſhip, with
whom oft arguing theſe proiects, for a plantation,
howeuer hee ſeemed well in words to like it, yet
he practiced to haue robbed mee of my plots, and
obſeruations: and ſo left mee alone in a deſolate
Ile, to the fury of famine, and all other extreami<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties
(leſt I ſhould haue acquainted <hi>Sir Thomas
Smith,</hi> my Honourable good friend, &amp; the Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cell
of <hi>Virginia</hi>) to the end, he and his aſſociates,
might ſecretly ingroſſe it, ere it were knowne to
to the State: Yet that God that alway hath kept
me from the worſt of his diſſimulations. Notwith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtanding
after my departure, hee abuſed the Salua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ges
where hee came, and betrayed twenty ſeauen
of theſe poore innocent ſoules, which he ſould in
<hi>Spaine</hi> for ſlaues, to mooue, their hare againſt our
Nation, aſwell as to cauſe my proceedings to be ſo
much the more difficult.</p>
            <p>Now, returning in the Bark, in the fift of Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guſt
<pb n="48" facs="tcp:11424:34"/>
I arriued at Plimouth: where imparting thoſe
my purpoſes to my honourable friende Sir <hi>Fer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinando
Gorge,</hi> and ſome others; I was ſo in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>couraged,
and aſſured to haue the managing their
authoritie in thoſe parts, during my life, that I in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gaged
my ſelfe to vndertake it for them. Arriuing
at London, I found alſo many promiſe me ſuch aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiſtance,
that I entertained <hi>Michaell Cooper</hi> the
Maſter, who returned with mee, and others of
the company. How hee dealt with others, or o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers
with him I know not: But my publike pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceeding
gaue ſuch incouragement, that it became ſo
well apprehended by ſome fewe of the Southren
Company, as theſe proiects were liked, &amp; he furni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhed
from London with foure ſhips at Sea, before
they at Plimouth had made any prouiſion at all,
but onely a ſhip cheefely let out by ſir <hi>Ferdinando
Gorge;</hi> which vpon <hi>Hunts</hi> late trecherie among the
Saluages, returned as ſhee went, and did little or
nothing, but loſt her time. I muſt confeſſe I was
beholden to the ſetters forth of the foure ſhips that
went with <hi>Cooper;</hi> in that they offered mee that
imploiment if I would accept it: and I finde, my
refusall hath incurred ſome of their diſpleasures,
whoſe fauor and loue I exceedingly deſire, if I may
honeſtly inioy it. And though they doe cenſure me
as oppoſite to their proceedings; they ſhall yet ſtill
in all my words and deedes finde, it is their error,
not my fault, that occaſions their diſlike: for ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uing
ingaged my ſelfe in this buſineſſe to the Weſt
Countrie; I had beene verie diſhonest to haue
<pb n="49" facs="tcp:11424:34"/>
broke my promiſe; nor will I ſpend more time in
diſcourie, or fiſhing, till I may goe with a com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>panie
for plantation: for, I know my grounds.
Yet euery one that reades this booke can not put
it in practice; though it may helpe any that haue
ſeene thoſe parts. And though they endeauour to
worke me euen out of my owne deſignes, I will
not much enuy their fortunes: but, I would bee
ſory, their intruding ignorance ſhould, by their
defailements, bring thoſe certainties to doubtful<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe:
So that the buſineſſe proſper, I haue my de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſire;
be it by <hi>Londoner, Scot, Welch,</hi> or <hi>Engliſh,</hi> that
are true ſubiects to our King and Countrey: the
good of my Countrey is that I ſeeke; and there is
more then enough for all, if they could bee con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tent
but to proceed.</p>
            <p>At laſt it pleaſed Sir <hi>Ferdinando Gorge,</hi>

on them, and ſome few Gentlemen my friends,

The next day being very foule weather, this exami<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nate

thoughts from too much meditation of my miſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rable
eſtate, I writ this diſcourse; thinking to haue
ſent it you of his Maieſties Councell, by ſome ſhip
or other: for I ſaw their purpoſe was to take all
they could. At laſt we were chaſed by one Captain
<hi>Barra,</hi> and <hi>Engliſh</hi> Pyrat, in a ſmall ſhip, with ſome
twelue peeces of ordinance, about thirty men, and
neer all ſtarued. They ſought by curteſie releefe
of vs; who gaue them ſuch faire promiſes, as at
laſt wee betrayed Captaine <hi>Wolliſton</hi> (his Liefte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant)
and foure or fiue of their men aboard vs, and
then prouided to take the reſt perforce. Now my
part was to be priſoner in the gun-roum, &amp; not to
ſpeake to any of them vpon my life: yet had <hi>Barra</hi>
knowledge what I was. Then <hi>Barra</hi> perceiuing wel
theſe <hi>French</hi> intents, made ready to fight, and <hi>Wol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liſton</hi>
as reſolutely regarded not their threats,
<pb n="55" facs="tcp:11424:37"/>
which cauſed vs demurre vpon the matter longer,
ſom ſixteene houres; and then returned their pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſoners,
and ſome victualls alſo, vpon a ſmall com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſition.
The next wee tooke was a ſmall <hi>Engliſh</hi>
man of <hi>Poole</hi> from <hi>New found Land.</hi> The great ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ben
at this preſent, was my priſon; from whence
I could ſee them pillage thoſe poore men of all
that they had, and halfe their fiſh when hee was
gone, they ſould his poore cloathes at the maine
maſt, by an outcry, which ſcarce gaue each man
ſeauen pence a peece. Not long after, wee tooke a
<hi>Scot</hi> fraught from <hi>Saint Michaels</hi> to <hi>Briſtow:</hi> hee
had better fortune then the other. For, hauing but
taken a boats loading of ſuger, marmelade, ſuckets,
and ſuch like, we diſcried foure ſayle, after whom
we ſtood; who forling their maine ſayles attended
vs to fight. But our <hi>French</hi> ſpirits were content
onely to perceiue they were <hi>Engliſh</hi> red croſles.
Within a very ſmall time after, wee chaſed foure

their fights againſt the <hi>Spaniards,</hi> and be a priſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner

the Captaine had oft broke his promiſe, which
was to put me a-shore on the Iles, or the next ſhip

for <hi>France</hi> in the Caruell of ſugar: himſelf reſolued

were haled by two <hi>Weſt Indy</hi> men: but when they
ſaw vs waue them for the King of <hi>France,</hi> they
gaue vs their broad ſides, ſhot through our mayne
maſt and ſo left vs. Hauing liued thus, neer three
moneths among thoſe French men of warre; with
much adoe, we arriued at the <hi>Gulion,</hi> not far from
<hi>Rochel;</hi> where inſtead of the great promiſes they
alwaies fed me with, of double ſatiſfaction, and
full content, they kept me fiue or ſix daies priſoner
in the Caruell, accuſing me to bee him that burnt
their Colony in <hi>New France;</hi> to force mee giue
them a diſcharge before the Iudge of the Admi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ralty,

was ſo ſtrong and the Sea ſo great, I went a
drift to Sea; till it pleaſed God the winde ſo turned
with the tide, that although I was all this fearefull
night of guſts and raine, in the Sea, the ſpace of 12

houres, when many ſhips were driuen a ſhore, and
diuerſe ſplit (and being with ſculling &amp; bayling the
water tired, I expected each minute would ſinke
mee) at laſt I arriued in an oazie Ile by <hi>Charowne;</hi>
where certaine fowlers found mee neere drowned,
and halfe dead, with water, colde, and hunger. By
thoſe, I ſound meanes to gette to <hi>Rochell;</hi> where I
vnderſtood the man of warre which we left at Sea,
and the rich prize was ſplit, the Captaine drow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned

ſeauen leagues of that place, from whence I eſca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ped
alone, in the little boate, by the mercy of
God; far beyond all mens reaſon, or my expectati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on.
Arriuing <hi>at Rochell,</hi> vpon my complaint to the
Iudge of the Admiralitie, I founde many good
words, and faire promiſes; and ere long many of
them that eſcaped drowning, tolde mee the newes
they heard of my owne death: theſe I arreſting,
their ſeuerall examinations did ſo confirme my
complaint, it was held proofe ſufficient. All which
being performed according to the order of iuſtice,
from vnder the iudges hand; I preſented it to the

a ſhore &amp; was ſaued with the Caruell, which I did
my beſt to arreſt: the Iudge did promiſe me I ſhold

            <p>Leauing thus my buſineſſe in <hi>France,</hi> I returned

liked; ſaying, the <hi>French</hi> had all was wanting; and
had throwne them into the Sea, taken their ſhip,
and all, had they not runne away &amp; left me as they
did. The cheeftaines of this mutinie that I could
finde, I laied by the heeles; the reſt, like themſelues,
confeſſed the truth as you haue heard. Now how
I haue or could preuent theſe accidents, I reſt at
your cenſures. But to the matter.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Newfound-land</hi> at the firſt, I haue heard, was
held as deſperate a fiſhing, as this I proiect in <hi>New
England. Placentia,</hi> &amp; the <hi>Banke,</hi> were alſo as doubt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full
to the <hi>French:</hi> But, for all the diſasters happe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned
mee, the buſineſſe is the ſame it was: and the
fiue ſhips (whereof one was reported more then
three hundred tunnes) went forward; &amp; found fiſh
ſo much, that neither Izeland-man, nor New found<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land-man,
I could heare of hath beene there, will
goe any more to either place, if they may goe thi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther.<note place="margin">The ſucceſſe of my vice Admi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rall and the foure ſhips of London, from New England.</note>
So, that vpon the returne of my Viceadmi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rall
that proceeded on her voyage when I ſpent my
<pb n="59" facs="tcp:11424:40"/>
maſts, from Plimouth this yeare are gone foure or
fiue ſaile: and from London as many; onely to
make voyages of profit: where the Engliſhmen
haue yet bneene, all their returnes together (except
Sir <hi>Fr. Popphames</hi>) would ſcarce make one a ſauer
of neere a douzen I could nominate; though there
be fiſh ſufficient, as I perſwade my ſelfe, to fraught
yearely foure or fiue hundred ſayle, or as many as
will goe. For, this fiſhing ſtretcheth along the Coaſt
from <hi>Cape Cod</hi> to <hi>Newfound-land,</hi> which is ſeauen
or eight hundred miles at the leaſt; and hath his
courſe in the deepes, and by the ſhore, all the yeare
long; keeping their hants and feedings as the beaſts
of the field, &amp; the birds of the aire. But, all men are
not ſuch as they ſhould bee, that haue vndertaken
thoſe voiages: and a man that hath but heard of an
inſtrument, can hardly vſe it ſo well, as hee that by
vſe hath contriued to make it. All the <hi>Romanes</hi> were
not <hi>Scipioes:</hi> nor all the <hi>Geneweſes, Columbuſes:</hi> nor
all <hi>Spanyards, Corteſes:</hi> had they diued no deeper in
the ſecrets of their diſcoueries, then wee, or ſtop<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ped
at ſuch doubts and poore accidentall chances;
they had neuer beene remembred as they are: yet
had they no ſuch certainties to begin as wee. But,
to conclude, <hi>Adam</hi> and <hi>Eue</hi> did firſt beginne this
innocent worke, To plant the earth to remaine to
poſteritie: but not without labour, trouble &amp; in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duſtrie.
<hi>Noe,</hi> and his family, beganne againe the ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cond
plantation; and their ſeede as it ſtill increaſed,
hath ſtill planted new Countries, and one countrie
another: and ſo the world to that eſtate it is. But
<pb n="60" facs="tcp:11424:41"/>
not without much hazard, trauell, diſcontents, and
many diſasters. Had thoſe worthie Fathers &amp; their
memorable off-spring not beene more diligent for
vs now in theſe Ages, then wee are to plant that
yet vnplanted, for the after liuers: Had the ſeede
of <hi>Abraham,</hi> our Sauiour Chriſt, and his Apoſtles,
expoſed themſelues to no more daungers to teach
the Goſpell, and the will of God then wee; Euen
wee our ſelues, had at this preſent been as Saluage,
and as miſerable as the moſt barbarous Saluage yet
vnciuilized. The <hi>Hebrewes,</hi> and <hi>Lacedaemonians,</hi> the
<hi>Goths,</hi> the <hi>Grecians,</hi> the <hi>Romanes,</hi> and the reſt, what
was it they would not vndertake to inlarge their
Territories, enrich their ſubiects, reſist their ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mies?
Thoſe that were the founders of thoſe
great Monarchies &amp; their vertues, were no ſiluered
idle golden <hi>Phariſes,</hi> but induſtrious iron-steeled
<hi>Publicans:</hi> They regarded more prouiſions, and
neceſſaries for their people, then iewels, riches,
eaſe, or delight for themſelues. Riches were their
ſeruants, not their Maiſters. They ruled (as Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers,
not as Tyrantes) their people as chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren,
not as ſlaues: there was no diſaster, could
diſcourage them; and let none thinke they incoun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tered
not with all manner of incumbrances. And
what haue euer beene the workes of the greateſt
Princes of the earth, but planting of countries,
and ciuilizing barbarous and inhumane Nations,
to ciuilitie and humanitie? whoſe eternall actions,
fill our hiſtories. Laſtly, the <hi>Portugales,</hi> and <hi>Spany<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ards:</hi>
whoſe euerliuing actions, before our eyes will
<pb n="61" facs="tcp:11424:41"/>
teſtifie with them our idleneſſe, and ingratitude to
all poſterities, and the neglect of our duties in our
pietie and religion we owe our God, our King, and
Countrie; and of want charity to thoſe poore ſalua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ges,
whoſe Countrie wee challenge, vſe and pos<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeſſe;
except wee bee but made to vſe, and marre
what our Fore-fathers made, or but onely tell what
they did, or eſteeme our ſelues too good to take the
like paines. Was it vertue in them, to prouide that
doth maintaine vs? and baſeneſſe for vs to doe the
like for others? Surely no. Then ſeeing we are not
borne for our ſelues, but each to helpe other, and
our abilities are much alike at the houre of our
birth, and the minute of our death: Seeing our
good deedes, or our badde, by faith in Chriſts me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rits,
is all we haue to carrie our ſoules to heauen, or
hell: Seeing honour is our liues ambition; and our
ambition after death, to haue an honourable
memorie of our life: and ſeeing by noe
meanes wee would bee abated of the
dignities &amp; glories of our Prede<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſors;
let vs imitate their
vertues to bee wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thily
their ſuc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſors.</p>
