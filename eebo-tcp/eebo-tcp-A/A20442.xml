            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

SIR THOMAS SMITH,

            <opener>
               <salute>Right worthy Sir,</salute>
            </opener>
            <p>
               <seg rend="decorInit">W</seg>Hen I first heard of an Inuectiue
publisht by some vnknowne
busie Person, against the <hi>East-Indian
Trade:</hi> I must confesse, I
held it, <hi>In eorum genere quae vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lescunt
spreta,</hi> worthy only of
that Companies contempt,
whose blest indeuour, with
good seruice to the State, hath surely freed them
from the poyson. Why should they then regard
the hissing of those lurking Serpents, that when the
<hi>Itching humour</hi> takes them, will be doing <hi>breuibus &amp;
carcere dignum,</hi> euen with the State it selfe?</p>
            <p>But hauing since pervsed the <hi>Pamphlet,</hi> I finde vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der
the pleasing title of <hi>Increase of Trade,</hi> and gilded
ouer with that <hi>Commendable</hi> Proposition of the <hi>Her<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring</hi>-fishing,
a sort of Pills are put to swallowing, that
perhaps may worke weake stomacks to distaste our
<pb n="2" facs="tcp:10226:3"/>
Course of <hi>Traffick</hi> by societies in <hi>London,</hi> especially
that now of greatest hope and profit to the <hi>East-In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dies.</hi>
And though the <hi>Author</hi> handle the particulars
with such confused <hi>Contradictions,</hi> as assure mee hee
conceiued not what he writ: Yet sure, some <hi>Ape</hi> hath
put the <hi>Cats</hi> foot in the fire, some cunning and mali<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tious
persons, for priuate ends, or <hi>lewder</hi> purposes in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fused
the <hi>Quicksiluer</hi> that set that running head a work.
Remembring therefore that a wiseman should not
onely keep himselfe from hurt of the <hi>Brute Beast,</hi> but
feed and clothe, that is as <hi>Plutarch</hi> notes, make profita<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble
vse of enemies: out of my loue to you that spend
so much of your <hi>Time,</hi> for the good of the worthie
<hi>Marchants</hi> liberall <hi>Aduentures,</hi> to aduance the reputati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
and reuenue of the <hi>Common-wealth,</hi> I wish some
one of our Committies best experienced in that bu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sinesse,
would take this oportunitie to shew how
wrongfully they are traduced, whose voluntarie ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zards
in such long and costly voyages, for such euen by
their enemies confession, dangerous and slow returnes
were rather thankefully to be commended.</p>
            <p>Good men, well-minded Marchants, while the idle
<hi>Drone</hi> and greedie Catterpillers prey vpon the sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stance
of the Subiect here at home, with eating vsurie
and harmefull arts, while such a Spider in a corner
spends his fruitlesse dayes perhaps in weauing weake
obiections against them, from furthest parts abroad,
they fetch and bring the hony to the Hiue, laborious
Bees, they clothe and feede the poore, and giue the
willing man imployment to gaine with them, and
with the Common wealth, the honour, and the ri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ches
that <hi>Venice</hi> first enioyed by their <hi>Trade</hi> ouer land,
<pb n="3" facs="tcp:10226:3"/>
along the <hi>Mediterran,</hi> and then the <hi>Portingals</hi> (poore
<hi>Portingals</hi> till then) procured by their more aduanta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gious
farre <hi>Sea-trafficke</hi> with those <hi>Easterne</hi> Countries.</p>
            <p>This was the first intention, this is still the endea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uour
of that famous fellowship, best knowne to you
that were their first, and are by well deseruing, still
their Gouernour; and if it please Almightie God to
continue his wonderfull blessing, and our good King
his gracious countenancing of their industrie, I make
no doubt, but by discouery of some neerer passage, or
if the worst fall, through the <hi>Aduantage</hi> of our multi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tude
of able bodies, and most commodious <hi>Sea-situa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion,</hi>
euen the way wee haue that rich <hi>Trade</hi> may re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiue
yet our turne more, and in few yeares a <hi>Staple

all sorts of Marchants in it found by one returne from
thence last sommer, <hi>Quae nobis placet experientia veri.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>But Sir, this honourable enterprise, like <hi>Hercules</hi>
yet in the Cradle, in the infancie hath beene assailed
by Serpents slie aspersions, which<note n="*" place="margin">Natiua generi humano pestis quae vepres nun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quam desinit in alienis agris licet purgatissimi sint quaeritare. <hi>Pet. Mart.</hi>

               <hi>Enuie</hi> long since

and carrying out the treasure of the land, in an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>swere

but told a truth like <hi>Martials, Bella, Diues, Puella, Fabulla,</hi>
hee might haue beene (it may bee iudged) neyther
faire nor rich, nor chast, but only forward to commend
himselfe: but now when as the poore Snake <hi>Enuie</hi>
growes to be a Monster, <hi>Malice,</hi> when the pratler late
a creeping Worme is waxt a winged Goose, a setter
forth in print of slanders. Now (me thinkes) you are,
<pb n="4" facs="tcp:10226:4"/>
if not inforst, at least inuited happily to shew the
world the well deseruing of that worthie Companie,
whose innocence will shine more gloriously euen to
the eye obscur'd of him that dwels farthest from <hi>Lon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>don,</hi>
by passing through those vapours of an idle or
corrupted braine these forst or forged imputations.</p>
            <p>A worke for truths sake worthie of a feruent spirits
carefull handling: but were it recommended to my
weaknesse; though I dislike as much as any man, to
see one, by transcribing only in effect, an honest Gentle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mans

Sea-states decay, as must be eyther true, and so the se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crets,
or false, and so the slanders of our Countrie.</p>
            <p>Though I condemne his folly, that proclaimes
such weakenesse and such want of Marriners and
Shipping in our Ports from fond reports of idle fel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowes,
Informations certainly as false in these particu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lars,

at this time, when cleane contrarie, the power

of his strength by Sea and Land, is for the good
of Christendome, composing of those stormes
which Armies both in <hi>Italy,</hi> and <hi>Germanie</hi> doe
threaten.</p>
            <p>Though I detest the hollow-hearted cunning, that
doth looke on <hi>Holland,</hi> but yet roues for other Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tries,
girding still and glancing at our Neighbours of
the vnited Prouinces, those in reason of state, and
through band of Religion, best assured friends, with
<pb n="5" facs="tcp:10226:4"/>
ouer sedulous insinuating into euery eare, their ea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting
vp of our prosperitie, their supplanting of vs in
our Trades, and such like seedes of Disaffection, preiu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diciall
to vs both. Whereas an honest subiect, well dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>posed
in Religion, well affected to the State, would ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
rest content with this assurance, that our King
hath power enough, when it shall please his wisdome
to curbe insolence. Our State may when it will, meet
with vnthankfulnesse, and they that made the<note n="*" place="margin">
                  <hi>Their word was,</hi> Si collidi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mur frangimur.</note> Em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bleme,
for their owne good, must be carefull to keepe
the Pots from knocking one vpon another.</p>
            <p>Though more particularly, out of many Touches,
I obserue such inclination, such a secret variation in the
Compasse of that <hi>Pamphletors</hi> discourse, as makes me
very iealous, for all his faire conclusion that hee fra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med
his Almanacke for the Meridian of <hi>Toledo</hi> rather
then our Ilands good fortune: witnesse his willingnes
to haue vs Trade into those Countries, where wee
must bee euer vnder the Lee, in awe and subiect to
much inconuenience, rather then make double the
profit to our selues and to the Common-wealth
by fetching fro<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> the wel-head, from the <hi>Indies,</hi> rather then
weaken them, their wealth and shipping, that in all
their Moderne Treaties with all Nations shew, how
much account they make of that sweet Trafficke.</p>
            <p>Though last of all that <hi>Pamphletors</hi> malignant ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king
vp all sorts of rayling arguments, and spleenefull
vrging euery thing against the <hi>East-India Marchant,</hi>
might very well prouoke from one of that Societie, the
lashes which his often fond excursions fit him for; yet
surely I should leaue him to the Riuall-free fruition
of those errors, and apply my penne to satisfie an ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nest
<pb n="6" facs="tcp:10226:5"/>
minde, rather then make him smart or carelesse
Readers smile. And as a ground-worke of Integri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie,
first I would set downe what hee sayes euen in his
owne Apparell, Scarfe, and Feather too, As thus.</p>
            <p>Now followeth the consideration of the East Indie
Trade,<note place="margin">East Indies.</note> into whose Seas, not onely the Riuer of <hi>Volga,</hi> as
before you heard, disemboqueth it selfe, but euen the bot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tome
of the <hi>Straights</hi> is emptied to fill vp those gulfes, and
not to onely, but besides that many of our best Marchants
haue transported their Staples thither; it hath also begot
out of all Callings, Professions, and Trades, many more
new Marchants. Then where there is increase of Mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chants,
there is increase of Trade; where Trade increa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>seth,
there is increase of Shipping; where increase of
Shipping, there increase of Mariners likewise: so then
rich and large <hi>East Indies.</hi> The report that went of the
pleasing notes of the Swannes in <hi>Meander</hi> floud, farre
surpassing the records of any other Birdes in any other
places whatsoeuer, drew thither all sorts of people in
great confluence, and with great expectation to heare, and
enioy their sweet singing. When they came thither, they
found in stead of faire white Swannes, greedie Rauens,
and deuouring Crowes; and heard instead of melodious
harmonie, vntuneable and loathsome croaking. In in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dignation
that they were so receiued and deceiued, in stead
of applauding, they hissed; and of staying, fled away. You
are now braue <hi>East Indies Meander</hi> floud, your Trade is
the singing of Swannes, which so many iourney so farre
to enioy. God forbid you should bee found so discoloured,
and wee so ill satisfied. And howsoeuer that I may bee
sure to auoide any detraction, whereby my nature might
haue any imputation, or by calling vp more Spirits into
the circle then I can put downe againe, I might incurre
some danger, and be taxed likewise of indiscretion, for that
we onely hitherto haue co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>plained of the want of shipping;
we desire now but herein to suruey the store, and sée how
<pb n="7" facs="tcp:10226:5"/>
you helpe the increase. You haue built more Shippes in
your time, and greater farre then any other Marchants
Ships; besides what you haue bought out of other trades,
and all those wholly belonging to you; there hath béene
entertained by you since you first aduentured, one and
twentie Ships, besides the now intended Uoyage of one
new Ship of seuen hundred Tunne, and happily some two
more of increase. The least of all your Shipping is of
fourescore Tunne: all the rest are goodly Ships, of such
burthen as neuer were formerly vsed in Marchandize; the
least and meanest of these last is of some hundred and twen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie
Tunne, and so goe vpward euen to eleuen hundred
Tunne. You haue set forth some thirteene Uoyages, in
which time you haue built of these, eight new Ships, and
almost as good as built the most of the residue, as the <hi>Dra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gon,</hi>
the <hi>Hector, &amp;c.</hi> So that at the first appearance you
haue added both strength and glorie to the Kingdome by
this your accession to the Nauie. But where I pray you
are all these Ships? foure of these are call away, of the
which one was of three hundred Tunne, another of foure
hundred, the third of thrée hundred, and the fourth of ele<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uen
hundred; two more are docked vp there as Pinaces to
Trade vp and downe: the rest are either employed in the
Trade in the <hi>Indies,</hi> or at home out of reparations; which
if true, if the Kingdome should haue néede of them on any
occasion, it shall surely want their seruice; and so then there
is not onely no supply to the Nauie this way, but hurt euen
to the whole Kingdome, the Woods being cut downe, and
the Ships eyther lost, on not seruiceable. Surely Stories
can shew vs, which we may reade in the courses of Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon-weales,
how tolerable, nay how laudable it is in all
States, to enlarge Commerce. Marchants, whome wée
should respect, can tell vs of the casualties which not one<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
the Shippes, but their Estates are subiect to by aduen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures.
Mariners, whom we must pittie, can teach vs of the
ordinary dangers not onely that Shippes and goods, but
their liues are subiect to by Sea. I must not then expro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brate
<pb n="8" facs="tcp:10226:6"/>
that to them which is to be imputed to the Sea; nor
are they to bee blamed out of reason for that which deser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ueth
in humanitie, commiseration; nor is <hi>England</hi> boun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded
by our Horizon, to goe no further then wée sée. Wee
haue learned long since, that <hi>Mercatura si tenuis sordida, si magna, splendida;</hi> the Stranger the Countrie, the greater
the aduenture; the more famous our Nation, the more
worthie the Marchant. Before wee were, euen <hi>Horace</hi>

that saying of <hi>Demosthenes</hi> on his courting of <hi>Lais,</hi> to
pay it to the <hi>Indian</hi> Trade, by alleaging, that <hi>Non tanti E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mam
poenitentiam,</hi> only hauing now in common that <hi>Ro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man
Prouiso, Ne quid detrimenti Respub. capiat.</hi> Let vs ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>amine
that which may mooue patience, that our Woods
are cut downe, and the Ships either lost or not seruiceable:
Our Woods I saie, cut downe in extraordinarie manner,
neither doe the Ships die the ordinarie death of Shippes.
Our Woods, extraordinarily cut downe, in regard of the
greatnesse of the Shipping, which doth as it were deuoure
our Timber. I am able out of sufficient testimonie to af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firme,
that since the <hi>Indian</hi> Trade, and méerely through
their building of their Ships of so great burthen, and their
repairing, (the building notwithstanding beganne but fiue
yeares since) that Timber is raised in the Land fiue shil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lings,
and more, in the load, nay, almost not to bee had for
monie, which the Companie (no question) being sensible
of, very wisely séeke to helpe themselues in, by building of
Ships in <hi>Ireland</hi> for their seruice: yet it seemeth their in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>couragement
that way, is but <hi>necessitous,</hi> in regard by
their owne saying, besides the hazard, the charges are lit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle
lesse; and which is worse, that kind of Timber is but
vntoward for that vse, being so extreame heauie, that a
Ship of a small burden draweth much Water. In fiue
yeares space their building, together with their repairing
of Ships almost equall to building, beget such a scarcitie,
what will a little continuance bring forth? Bring forth I
cannot say ought, but a priuation will follow euen of all
<pb n="6" facs="tcp:10226:6"/>
our Timber Wood. The Kings Nauie must be maintai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned,
other Merchants of lower ranke must haue shipping,
and the Sea trade may increase, and then eyther we must
Trade without shipping, or make Shippes, without Tim<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber.</p>
            <p>When the <hi>Norman Conqueror</hi> hauing subdued the most
part of the Kingdome, passed from <hi>Essex</hi> into <hi>Kent,</hi> which
then made head against him, the <hi>Kents,</hi> hauing by the ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uice
of their politike Bishoppe and their stout Abbot, cut
downe great boughes, and with them in their armes mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ched
towards the <hi>Conqueror;</hi> whereby, besides the nouel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie
of the sight, the Armie appeared double as bigge: <hi>Wil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liam</hi>
himselfe so conceiuing it, as also amazed to sée Woods
walke; more feared and discontented with that sight, then
otherwise assured with his former successe, condescended to
what demands soeuer were made by those people, to haue
such weapons laid downe, and to gaine such ingenious
Subiects; whereby, to their eternall benefit, and credit,
their persons were neuer in bondage, no their Lawes al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tered.
In this their Land-Stratageme, I sée our Sea-Arts,
in that and these Woods being the fatall instrument
of our fortunes, Boughes of Trees kept the <hi>Kentish-men</hi>
out of seruitude, when they held them in their hands, and
but for shew; their bodies will kéepe vs in libertie when
they containe vs, and are for seruice, and by their mouing
on the water they will amaze both <hi>French</hi> and <hi>Spanish,</hi> and
whomsoeuer, and kéep them, and all others, from comming
néere vs: Out of which prouident fore-sight, our most wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thy
Princes formerly raigning, haue made diuers Lawes
in fauour of Timber Trees:<note place="margin">35. Hen. 8. 17. 13 Elizabeth. 25.</note> and our most noble King
hath prouided thereto with new accessions for the preser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uing
and increasing of them; but that a parricide of Woods
should thus be committed by building of Shippes,<note place="margin">Forbidding by proclamation the building with Timber</note> it was
neuer thought on by any of our Royall <hi>Solons,</hi> and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
there was no prouiso for it: Nay, this inconuenience
was to little suspected, that our said famous Princes haue
prouided cleane contrarie, with great bountie and indul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gence
<pb n="10" facs="tcp:10226:7"/>
haue encouraged by reward out of their owne pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ses
the builders of great Ships; as bestowing on the buil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders
fiue shillings on the Tunne for euery Tunne that is
builded aboue one hundred Tunne in a Ship; so necessary
did the Prince thinke his maintenance of shipping, the ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cession
thereof consisting much in their greatnesse, to the
honour and safetie of the Kingdome; and such vse he made
account he should haue of them. Whereas now this waie
he contributeth, to the spoile of his Woods, to the losse of
the Shippes, and to the hurt of the Kingdome. I heard a
Shippe-wright say on the losse of the <hi>Trades Increase,</hi>
that if you ride fortie miles from about <hi>London,</hi> you
could not find sufficient Timber to build such another. It
was a Ship of eleuen hundred Tunne: for beautie, bur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>then,
strength, and sufficiencie, surpassing all Marchants
Ships whatsoeuer. But alas! shée was but shewne, out
of a cruell destinie shée was ouertaken with an vntimely
death in her youth and strength, being deuoured by those
Iron Wormes of that Countrie, that pierced her heart,
and brake many a mans withal memorable in her misfor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tune,
onely redounding to the Common-wealthes losse.
For as for the Marchants, though I pittie their aduen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures
with all my heart, yet in this their part of losse was
least; for all their goods were on shore; and shée had brought
aboundance out of the <hi>Mecha</hi> Fléete, which shée did both
tithe and toll: And thanks be to God, they are more then
serues by what is returned from her, and more then that
often, by the grace of God, will come from her to the Mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chants
gaine.</p>
            <p>The like vntimely fall had the other thrée of great bur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>then,
gallant Ships, neuer hauing had the fortune to see
their nature soile againe, or the honour to doe their Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trie
any seruice, in respect of all other ships that wander
ordinarily to other Countries, therefore I may iustly say
that they die not the ordinary death of shippes, who com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monly
haue some rest, and after long seruice die full of
yeares, and at home, much of their timber seruing againe
<pb n="11" facs="tcp:10226:7"/>
to the same vse, besides their Iron-worke, and the rest o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>therwise
seruiceable, and not in this bloudie and vnseaso<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nable
fashion, rather indéed as coffins full of liue bodies,
then otherwise as comfortable ships. For the rest that liue,<note place="margin">Our Ships are fain to take in the natiues of the Indian Countries to supply the wants of our dead Sea-men to bring home their Ship.</note>
they come home so crazed and broken, so maimed and vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manned,
that whereas they went out strong, they re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turne
most feeble: and whereas they were carried forth
with Christians, they are brought home with Heathen.
What the profits are to the Marchants, for so great an ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uenture,
I know not. I am sure amends can not easily be
made for so great losse, euen in this point which is our spe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciall
subiect, for wast of Woods, and spoile of shipping.</p>
            <p>The last co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>sistance of shipping propounded, was that of
the <hi>East Indies:</hi> which though yongest, was found in shew
and state to haue ouer-topped all the rest; as a Bird that
maketh her selfe gay with the feathers of all other Foules;
hauing borrowed, nay, hauing bought the best ships out of
other Trades to honour their Uoyage, and plumed euen
<hi>Constantinople</hi> her self, of her shipping: therefore that
men are entertained extraordinarily in this Uoyage, it is
apparant out of the greatnesse of the shipping; the enter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainment
of them increasing, if should be a consequent that
Sea-men increase this way: But that we may not by am<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bages
triumph in their losse, or our calamities, we sée this
way that our shippes perish, and therefore our men they
shrinke, Nay, though ships come home, yet then leaue the
men behind: so in this Uoyage, there is a two-fold way
towards our want of Marmers.</p>
            <p>In that Ships, nay great ships, are extraordinarily sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iect
to be cast away, and then there must be lest likewise of
men; In that though they come home emptied of their
men.</p>
            <p>By the losse of foure ships, we haue lost at the least foure
hundred and fiftie men: and in the aduenture of some thrée
thousand that haue beene imployed since that Uoyage be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ganne,
wée haue lost many aboue two thousand.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Dauid</hi> refused to drinke of the Well of <hi>Bethelem,</hi>
               <pb n="12" facs="tcp:10226:8"/>
which the strong men had fetched, when hee thirsted and
longed, because it was the price of bloud. This Trade,
their commodities are at a farre dearer rate, being bought
with so many mens liues.</p>
            <p>But happily some will say, that the greatest losse of
these men was at the beginning, when as all thinges
are difficult: but since our men framed to a better com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>position
of themselues, to the varietie of this Climate,
and heartned to the tediousnesse of this Uoyage, haue
better endured and ouercome those difficulties, and
returned more comfortably. Heerein the latest Uoyages
will informe vs best, and wée will instance in the thrée last
that haue made returnes.</p>
            <p>The first was vnder Sir <hi>Henrie Middleton,</hi>

to that implacable <hi>East Indian Neptune:</hi> the <hi>Darling</hi> of
that Uoyage is yet there, nor neuer will the master, and
approoued sea-man, returne, with diuers others.</p>
            <p>The second was that of Captaine <hi>Saris,</hi> and Captaine

<pb n="13" facs="tcp:10226:8"/>
therefore thought méet to command. Whether they were
short of the opinion conceiued of them or no, I know not; it
they were, I should attribute part of the losse of their men
to their insufficiencie, but that the destinie of that Countrie
challengeth all to it selfe. Captaine <hi>Towerson,</hi> who first re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turned

As one swallow maketh no summer, so it is not much to
be maruailed, that in al these Uoyages some one ship hath
but béene scarred, and not else much hurt in this iournie:
Shée indéed but euen séeing those Coasts, and presently on
so great a glut of our men and ships, with the which it sée<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>meth
the sea and Land was then busied and full: when as
Captaine <hi>Newport</hi> returned with little losse and in short
time.</p>
            <p>Now then as wée haue said before, that the <hi>Indian</hi> ships
die not the ordinary death of ships: and that wee haue
shewen likewise before, that men doe die extraordinarily
in this Uoyage, which is almost incredible: they are distres<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed
likewise after their death, and that is very apparant
by the meane account made to their heires of what they
had in possession in their life time, by what should other<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wise
be due to them in their purchase, by the calamities of
their wiues, children, and friends, after their death. Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bulous
and phantasticall Legends haue béene made of the
restlesse death of many concealed Extortioners, and Mur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derers,
whose Ghosts haue béen said so walke in paine
and penance. On the contrary, how many liue bodies in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>déed
the true Images of the deceased, complaine of the
death, call for the due of their friends? Fathers, Husbands,
Children, Kinsfolks, &amp; Creditors: Poore <hi>Ratlife, Limehouse
Blacke-wall, Shadwell, Wapping,</hi> and other sea-townes
abroad can sensibly tell. The Marchant hée is at home,
and therefore hée cannot embezell the goods abroad: and it
is likely that what is directly proued due is paid here to
theirs. Then is the calamitie of that iournie more feare<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full,
because out of his owne ill Planet if maketh so many
miserable. How this is recompenced it is neyther my
purpose, nor my part to examine: For certaine there is
want of Trade: the Hollander would grow greater, if hée
had all this Trade in his owne hands. The Kings Cu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stomes
are now aduanced: this way Shipwrights are set
on worke, which must be maintained; and other Mecha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nicall
Trades liue hereby, with a number of poore busied.
<pb n="15" facs="tcp:10226:9"/>
And surely hee that would not haue the poore to liue, I
would hee might begge: And hee that would not aduance
the Kings profit in all liberall manner; and Marchandize
is a faire means, I would hée might die: and hee that re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gardeth
not his Countries good, it is pittie hee was euer
borne. I desire not, like a second <hi>Phaeton,</hi> to make a com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bustion.
All that I would enforce at this time is, that in
this trade our men are consumed, and thereby more want
of Mariners. Let the <hi>Straights</hi>-men, and the <hi>Lisborne</hi>-Marchants complain of their hinderance this way, and say
their Trafficke before was more beneficiall by much, and
more certaine to the Custome-house then the <hi>Indies</hi> bee
now. Let others report that the foundation of this Trade
was laid in the ruine of a <hi>Carick</hi> that Sir <hi>Iames Lancaster</hi>
tooke in the first Uoyage, and that the maine of this after-iollitie
procéeded of the forced Trade driuen with the <hi>Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cha</hi>
Fléet by Sir <hi>Henry Middleton,</hi>
               <note place="margin">Wherein hee was his owne Trade-caruer out of tenne hundred thou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sand pounds worth of goods.</note> whereby diuers durst

other ships, out of rumor of reuenge for violence offered
by our <hi>Indian</hi> men to the <hi>Turkes</hi> in the Red sea. Let the
common people say that their commodities are vnneces<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sarie:
aske the Tradesmen, nay all men, what they haue
cheaper: looke into the price of victuals how it riseth out of
their great prouisions. Let the whole Land murmure at
the transport of treasure, and bring in <hi>Charles</hi> the fifth his

thereby to the poore, and they whom it doth concerne may
suggest the <hi>Indian</hi> home state and particular profit. Once I
am sure, that as <hi>Vespasian</hi> the Emperor sayd, Hee had
rather saue one Cittizen, then kill one thousand Enemies;
so his Royall Maiestie had rather haue his subiects, then
Custome for them: and you see plainly, that his Maiesties

want of Mariners.</p>

<pb n="36" facs="tcp:10226:20"/>
sometimes more) sent out in other Voyages, which
I doe neuer reckon, but onely giue a true account of
those that did proceed in the same shippe. And so be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sides
those which Captaine <hi>Best</hi> did leaue abroad in

had any minde to publish truth, that would not once
conferre with Captaine <hi>Best,</hi> well knowne vnto him,
as it seemeth by his friendly commendation, and one

            <p>It is the Marchants griefe (and hee that knowes

that hitherto they cannot absolutely cleare
themselues from this (to them indeede great) mis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chiefe.
For though they put their wealth into the

hands of such as come by sute and friends into their

imprest for their prouisions, beyond all other Mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chants;
though they prouide what ere it cost, all that
the wit of man, helpt by continuall experience, can
inuent, for victuals, clothing, physicke, surgerie, to
keepe them in good health, besides good Preachers,
and the best Commanders, al that may be to preserue
them: yet if (as for the most part through their owne
abusing of themselues, with the hot drinkes and most
infectious women of those Countries) they come vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to
vntimely death, the Marchants, that by that
meanes lose much of their goods, and hazard all,
when they haue paid the friends or creditors not only
all their due, but oft times giuen more out of charitie
to such as want, shall yet haue such a man as this raise
ghosts, rather then they shall not be haunted.</p>
            <p>But by the blessing of Almightie God, now that
we are acquainted better with that Voyage, and so
taught to settle Factories in healthier places; now
that our Factors are more staid, and better knowne
vnto vs, then many of those young men were that
first aduentured on that then discouering Trade;
now that our common Mariners, in effect the food of
that mortalitie, (as may appeare by the often Voya<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ges
of our Captaines, Masters, Mates, and men of go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uernment)
shall neither be so long at Sea, nor stay
longer on Land, then to vnlade and lade, and so return

            <p>In any of their Voyages, The Common-wealth
payes nothing for the victuals nor the wages of the
men, nor for the worke of Shippewrights, Smiths,
Coopers, Ropemakers, Porters, Lighter-men, &amp;c. and
such like infinite number of Labourers which they
haue continually in pay; but hath the imployment of
all these, and the keeping of many Factors abroad,
for the materials, out of which they rayse their ship<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ping
and prouisions, so that there rests to reckon vnto

her, onely the stocke of Marchandize and monie sent

And it is worth the noting that this twelue thou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sand
pounds, was scant one third part of that, which
the Companie paid that yeare for the Kings custome,
impost, and other duties, and not one third part of
that which they paid Marriners for wages: but for the
victuall, that is thus prouided.</p>

more, is prouided in <hi>India,</hi> or parts abroad.</p>

ALas Sir,<note place="margin">Answere.</note> his deare brother in Armes <hi>Death of men,</hi>
is runne away wounded to death by Captaine
<hi>Newport:</hi> what would you haue him doe? When hee
saw, that the <hi>East-India</hi> Companie, by the Bookes of
Entrie with his Maiesties Officers, by their own books
of Accompts, besides a sodaine and secret searching of
their ships, had manifested that they neuer in any
yeare (no not when they went to discouer what of
our Commodities would vent in those parts) carryed
nere so much, as his Maiesties gracious Letters Pat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tents
doth permit. When he found that some parti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cular
Marchants of that Companie, did at one time
bring into the Kingdome more siluer, then the whole
Companie together did at any time carrie out. When
hee perceiued, notwithstanding, that the <hi>East-India</hi>
Marchant, to auoid all colour of scandall, did prouide,
That forraine<note n="u" place="margin">It was euer the money of forraine Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions, which they exported, and that which Marchants brought in not our owne coyne.</note> coine, beyond the Seas, with much
hazard (as lately at <hi>Sandwich</hi>) by bringing of it ouer
in small Pinkes, and paying dearer for it, then others,
yea, strangers here at home doe buy it to steale ouer
for want of their licence. When hee beheld, to his
great grief, such daily increase of broad clothes dyed
and dreft, with other marchandize, and such decrease
of readie money, in the Cargazon of stock they sent to
Traffique. When last of all, he heard for certaine of
a Factorie setled at <hi>Iapan,</hi> and of such store of siluer
there, as is not onely like to serue the Trade in all
those parts, but to returne perhaps some good part
hither, what would you haue him doe, but hide his
head? And yet you heare, he holds his manly words,
he talkes of murmuring and<note n="*" place="margin">Out of <hi>Halls</hi> Chronicle.</note> 
               <hi>Charles</hi> the Fifth.</p>
            <p>But sure, men will not murmure, when they know
<pb n="49" facs="tcp:10226:26"/>
the truth, and would these hastie Writers fill their
braines a little better, ere they presse them, by reading
the Records of <hi>Spaine</hi> and <hi>Portugall,</hi> and better Stories
then <hi>Hals</hi> Chronicle for <hi>India</hi> matters, they might
finde reasons, to make more reckoning of the <hi>East-In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dia</hi> Traffique then th'Obiector doth; The sole frui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
whereof hath yeelded many Millions yearely to

more to that Crowne, then the <hi>West-Indies.</hi> I am sure

had of wealth, from those rich countries.</p>
            <p>But I haue done, and now it may be mine Author,
that in his first Page, cald himselfe, a Fresh-water
Souldier, if he should chance to see the Martiall or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der
his Obiections haue appeared in, might beleeue
himselfe to bee some great Commander, whereas the
Truth is hee was but a Trumpet of Defiance to the

I would send him back to take a view of all his False<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hoods,
scattered in the field, which I perswade my
