         <editorialDecl>
            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

               <seg rend="decorInit">I</seg>T was most
truely said by
the Apostle of
the Gentiles:
<hi>godlines is great
gaine;</hi> Importing thereby,
<pb facs="tcp:23076:3"/>
that if man would be in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cited
to the care to get any
thing, for the profit might
come thereby, it should be
godlinesse: No skill in the
world being c<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>oparable to
that skill of being able to
leade a godly life, for the
sure, and speedy, &amp; match<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lesse
gain it will bring vnto
a man: for besides that it
onely hath the promise of
a better life, godlinesse
were to bee desired, and
with all possible diligence
to bee sought after, for the
very gaine of it in this life:
For to omit the considera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
of the fauor it breeds
with God, &amp; the vnspeak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able
<pb facs="tcp:23076:3"/>
treasures of the grace
of Christ, which alwayes
go with it, it were to bee
desired for the immediate
effects it workes vpon men
in it selfe. For if men loue
themselues, what should
they desire more then that
which tends to make them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selues
perfect? What
should it aduantage a man
to haue all things good a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout
him, if himselfe
bee ill and vile? If men,
that were onely guided by
the light of Nature, could
(some of them) see cleere<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly,
that nothing was so
good for a man as to liue
well (when yet they knew
<pb facs="tcp:23076:4"/>
no other liuing well, then
what was prescribed in
their naked and naturall
Ethickes) then how much
more happy must it be for
a man to liue a religious
life, by which he is brought
more neerer to God, him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selfe,
and farre aboue the
condition of any naturall
man? Yea, if there were
no more to bee had by it,
but the peace and rest it
brings vnto a mans heart,
it were aboue all outward
things to bee desired: for
no man walkes safely, that
walkes not religiously, nor
can any actions of men
produce any sound tran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quillity
<pb facs="tcp:23076:4"/>
and rest of heart,
but such actions as are pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>scribed
by true Religion.
What shall I say? If for
none of these, yet for it self
were a godly life to be had
in singular request: for if
men, with much expence
of outward things, seeke
but the skill of diuers, na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turall,
and artificiall know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledges,
and thinke it worth
their cost but to bee able
to attaine these Skils? how
much more ought man to
be at the paines, yea and
cost too (if it were requi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red)
to get this admirable
skill to liue a religious life?
This most gainefull Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iect
<pb facs="tcp:23076:5"/>
is intreated of in this
little Volume; I may true<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
say, that almost euery
sentence in this little Trea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tise,
leads vs to much and
rich treasure, if the pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mises
belonging to each
duty were annexed there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>unto:
and therefore no
Christian that loues his
owne soule, should thinke
much of the paines of lear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning,
or practising these
Rules.</p>
            <p>I shall not need to ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hort
your Ladiship to the
hearty care of those things
you haue beene taught of
God (long since) to profit,

you beleeued the Gospell
of saluation, and were
sealed by the Spirit of pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mise,
you haue a Witnesse
within your selfe, which
will not faile in life or
death to pleade your
aboundant consolation.
When I entreat of piety,
righteousnesse, mercy and
temperance, I entreate of
things you haue aboue
many profited in.</p>
            <p>I haue presumed to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dicate
these Directions to

<pb facs="tcp:23076:6"/>
without reason: you haue
heard the preaching of

and haue beene a

beseech your Ladiship to
accept of this small testi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mony
of my vnfeigned
obseruance of your many
prayses in the Gospel, and

thing intended
in this Treatise

thy vse (Christian Reader)
those directions scattered
here &amp; there in the Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures,
<pb n="2" facs="tcp:23076:26"/>
which may, through
out the whole course of
thy life, tell thee, what thou
must do in the right order
of thy conuersation: How
thou shouldst behaue thy
selfe <hi>toward God,</hi> and how
thou shouldst carry thy
selfe <hi>toward men,</hi> in all the
occasions of thy life: <hi>In
company, out of company:</hi>
In all duties either of <hi>righ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teousnesse</hi>
or <hi>mercy:</hi> and
how thou shouldst dispose
of thy selfe <hi>in affliction,</hi> and

            <p>And thou maist be the

thou hast the most

expresse &amp; apparant word
of God to warrant and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quire
thy obedience here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in.</p>
            <p>Be not so prophane, as
to thinke, that here is more
to do then needs, or that
I burthen the liues of
Christians with a multi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tude
of vnnecessary Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cepts,
and so make the
way harder then it is: For
I require thy obedience in
nothing, thou hast not
reason to be perswaded to
bee enioyned thee by the
pure word of God; And
thou must know, to the
confusion of thy security;
that hee that will walke
<pb n="4" facs="tcp:23076:27"/>
safely, must <hi>walke by rule,
Gal.</hi> 6. 16. Hee is yet <hi>in
darkenesse, and walkes on in
darkenesse,</hi> and sees not
what he doth, or whither
hee goeth, that doth not
make <hi>the Word of God the
light vnto his feet, and the
Lanterne vnto his pathes:
Psal.</hi> 119. There is a holy
<hi>order of life</hi> commended
in the godly, <hi>Col.</hi> 2. 5. and
Gods promises are made
to such as <hi>will dispose of

conuersation is an ill con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uersation;
and if euer we
would <hi>see the saluation of
God,</hi> wee must bee at the

waies, and to see to it, that
we dispose of our waies a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>right,
<hi>Psal, 50. vlt.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>The benefite thou maist
reape by this Treatise,<note place="margin">The profit of the course.</note> is
much euery way, if the
fault bee not in thy selfe:
for here thou maist briefe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
behold the substance of
a godly life; thou maist in
a short time informe thy
knowledge in that great
doctrine of practicall Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uinity:
But especially thou
maist, by the help of this
Treatise see a sound way,
how to beautifie thy owne
conuersation, with the ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dition
of diuers rules,
which, perhaps, hitherto
<pb n="6" facs="tcp:23076:28"/>
thou hast not taken notice
of: God hath promised
<hi>much peace,</hi> and comfort
vnto <hi>such as will walke ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording
vnto rule, Gal.</hi> 6. 16.
Yea, hee hath promised,
<hi>that they shall see the salua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
of God, that dispose their
way aright, Psal. 50. vlt.</hi> It
is true, it is a greater la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bour
to trauaile in the way,
then to shew it; but yet
it is a great benefite to be
shewed the way. Howso<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>euer,
it may not be denied,
but it is a greater glory to
obserue these rules, then to
know them, or prescribe
them.</p>
            <p>It may be thou wilt ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iect,<note place="margin">The easi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nes of the course.</note>
               <pb n="7" facs="tcp:23076:28"/>
that the rules are so
many, thou canst neuer re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>member
them, and so not
profite by them. I answer:</p>
            <p>If I haue made the
rules no more in number
then God hath made them
in his Word, thou maist
not finde fault with me.</p>
            <p>Secondly, no man that
is to learne any Trade, or
Science, but hee meeteth
with more directions, then
hee can on the suddaine
reach to, or practise, and
yet hee reiects not his
Trade or Science, because
in time he hopes to learne
it all. Would we put on a
resolution to serue a Pren<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiship
<pb n="8" facs="tcp:23076:29"/>
to Religion, and to
worke hard one whole se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uen
yeeres: oh, what work
would we dispatch! How
many Rules and Know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledges
would wee grow
skilfull in! But alas, after
many yeeres profession of
Christianity, the most of
vs, if all were put together,
haue not done the worke,
that might haue bene done
in few daies.</p>
            <p>Thirdly,<note place="margin">Marke this direction.</note> I answer, that
it is not necessary thou
shouldst lay all these Rules
before thee at once, but
marke out certaine choise
Rules, so many as thou
canst well remember, and
<pb n="9" facs="tcp:23076:29"/>
striue, by daily practice, to
bring thy selfe to some
kinde of dexterity in ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>seruing
them. There bee
some rules of each kinde,
which, if thou bee a true
Christian, thou knowest
and obseruest already:
These thou maist continue
to obserue still, without
loading thy memory a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout
them. Now if those
be omitted, then consider
of the rest that remaine,
which of them do most
concerne thee, or would
most adorne thy practice
and profession, or are such
as thou neuer hitherto
didst make conscience of:
<pb n="10" facs="tcp:23076:30"/>
Extract or marke out so
many of those at a time, as
thou wouldst in daily
practice striue to attaine,
and when thou hast lear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned
them, then go on, and
prescribe to thy selfe new
Lessons. To a carnall
minde, all the way of god<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>linesse
is impossible, but
to a godly and willing
minde all things, through
the power and assistance of
God, are possible: God
will accept thy desire and
endeuour, and will adde
strength and might, and
encourage thee in all his
waies. By prayer thou
maist forme any grace in
<pb n="11" facs="tcp:23076:30"/>
thee, by reason of the
power the Lord Iesus hath
to preuaile for any thing
thou dost aske the Father
in his name.</p>
            <p>The last benefite may
come to thee, if thou dai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
reade these directions,
is, that they will quicken
thee to a great care of wel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>doing,
and giue thee cause
to <hi>walke humbly with thy
God,</hi> and abase thy selfe
for thine owne insufficien<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy:
<hi>The Lord giue thee vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derstanding
in all things,</hi>
and <hi>vnite thy heart vnto
his feare alwaies,</hi> that thou
maist <hi>obserue to doe,</hi> as hee
commandeth thee, <hi>and
<pb n="12" facs="tcp:23076:31"/>
not turne from the good way
all the daies of thy life.</hi>

            <p>The <hi>generall rules</hi> are

               <hi>generall preparations, helpes,
or furtherances</hi> to a holy
life, without which men
in vaine beginne the cares,

about his <hi>faith</hi> and <hi>re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pentance;</hi>
hee must bee sure
hee is reconciled to God,
and hath truely repented
himselfe of his sinnes,
2. <hi>Cor.</hi> 13. 5. For vnlesse hee
bee a <hi>new creature,</hi> hee is
<hi>no creature,</hi> but a <hi>dead man,</hi>
and so vtterly vnable for
the practice of these rules

without God we are, till
we liue by faith: Besides,
the pollution of our hearts
or liues drawne vpon vs by
the custome of sinne past
<pb n="15" facs="tcp:23076:32"/>
and present, will so infect
all we do, that it will bee
abominable to God, and
so lost labour.</p>
            <p>This is the first Rule.</p>
            <p>2 His next care must
be to <hi>learne</hi> the <hi>knowledge</hi>
of the rules of life; wee
can neuer practise what
we know not, and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
our next care and
paines must be to get the
knowledge of Gods waies
distinctly, and effectually,
into our heads and hearts;
Our direction must not be
in our bookes, but in our
heads; and a Christian
must haue his rules alwaies
before him, that so hee
<pb n="16" facs="tcp:23076:33"/>
may <hi>walke circumspectly</hi> by
line and leuel, <hi>Ephes. 5. 15.

this is such a rule, as must

<pb n="17" facs="tcp:23076:33"/>
and it is not enough
thus in generall to require

if wee would take a sound
course to attaine know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge.
He then that would

knowledge, must remem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber
these directions.</p>
            <p>First,<note place="margin">1. He must esteeme knowlege.</note> hee must <hi>esteeme

estimation of it, accoun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting
it as <hi>great treasure,</hi> ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>counting

for her, as for treasure,</hi> and
then with wonderfull suc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cesse
shall <hi>wee vnderstand

Prou.</hi> 2. 4. else our labour
will bee blasted and fruit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lesse,
if wee bring meane
thoughts to the exercise of
directions for the attaining
of knowledge.</p>
            <p>Secondly,<note place="margin">2. He must not con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sult with flesh and bloud.</note> he must take
heede that <hi>hee consult not
with flesh and bloud, Gal.</hi> 1. 16
He must not regard other
mens opinions, or his own
carnall reason, but resolue
to <hi>giue glory to God and his
Word,</hi> as willing to beleeue
or doe whatsoeuer the
Lord saith vnto him.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="19" facs="tcp:23076:34"/>3.<note place="margin">3. He must redeeme the time.</note> Thirdly, he must <hi>re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deeme
the time, Ephes.</hi> 5. 16.
Inasmuch as he hath lost so
much time past, hee must
now prouide to allow him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selfe
conuenient and cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taine
time to be spent this
way for the attaining of
knowledge, else to study
by snatches and vncertain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly,
will bee to little or no
purpose. To complaine of
ignorance, will not serue
the turne, nor will the pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tence
of worldly businesse
excuse vs: and therefore
we must <hi>buy so much time</hi> of
our occasions, as may bee
competent for the supply
of our wants in knowledge.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="20" facs="tcp:23076:35"/>4.<note place="margin">4. He must be wise for himselfe.</note> Fourthly, in seeking
knowledge, <hi>he must be wise

must striue to <hi>vnderstand

This is a rule of singular
Vse, if it could bee beaten

When the light of doctrin

they command vs in the
Lord, 1. <hi>Cor.</hi> 11. 2.</p>
            <p>Thirdly, wee must <hi>take
heed of discouraging them.</hi>
For this is <hi>not profitable for

            <p>Thirdly, hee that would

and prophane persons.
The necessity of this rule is
both proued and vrged in
these &amp; many other Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures,

2. Cor. 6. 17. Epb.</hi> 5. 7, 8.</p>

hath learned them: he must
as the phrase is, <hi>obserue to

our outward callings
into order, and euery daies

confusions in worldly bu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sinesse
breede miserable
neglect in Gods seruice.
And therefore hee that
<pb n="29" facs="tcp:23076:39"/>
would profite in an order<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
course of life, must
prouide to <hi>vse the world
so, as he may serue the Lord

that would <hi>runne a race,
abstaineth from all things,</hi>
that might encumber him.
<hi>No man, that warreth, in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tangleth
himselfe with the
affaires of life, that hee may
please him, who hath chosen
him to be a souldier:</hi> And
therefore we may not think
it much, if in our spirituall
course God lay some re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>straint
vpo<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> vs, in respect of
the cares and encumbran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces

must often remember his

his eies the comming
of <hi>Christ,</hi> striuing to stirre
vp in his heart the desire
after Chrst, praying for it,
and dispatching those
<pb n="32" facs="tcp:23076:41"/>
workes, that may prepare
him thereunto: The re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>membrance
of our ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>counts
in the day of Christ
will wonderfully quicken
men to the care of well,
doing, and the cause of
the viciousnesse, and mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>serable
neglect, and pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crastinations
of many is,
their forgetting of their
latter end: A great reason,
why the directions about
godlinesse are not enter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tained,
is, because men
<hi>put farre away from them
the day of the Lord:</hi> where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>as
the remembrance of the
reuelation of Iesus Christ,
would put Spirit and Life
<pb n="33" facs="tcp:23076:41"/>
into vs. Hee dares not
say from his heart, Come,
Lord Iesus, come quickly,
that is not resolued dili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gently
to worke the works
of Christ.</p>
            <p>9 He must not stay for
company,<note place="margin">9 He must notregard what the multitude doth.</note> but rather
choose to runne alone; or
with a few, then hazzard
the losse of the Crowne.
Our life is a Race, and as
in a race men stay not for
company, but striue who
may runne formost: so it
is in the race of godlinesse:
<hi>He must so runne, as he may
obtaine:</hi> He must set out
with the first, and runne
as it were for his life: As
<pb n="34" facs="tcp:23076:42"/>
he must make vse of the so<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciety
of the godly, so hee
must not stay, till his car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nall
friends, and acquain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance
will set out with him:
Hee must bee of <hi>Ioshua's</hi>
minde, that if the whole
world will liue in wicked<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse
and prophanenesse,
yet <hi>he and his house will serue
the Lord, 1. Cor. 9. 24. &amp; 14.
12. Iosh.</hi> 24. 15.</p>
            <p>Tenthly,<note place="margin">10. Hee must in all things giue thanks.</note> hee must <hi>in all

God giues him successe in
any thing, or prospers the
meanes to him, and helps
him with victory ouer any
sinne, or strength to per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>forme
any duety, or be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stowes
<pb n="35" facs="tcp:23076:42"/>
vpon him any spiri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tuall
blessing, hee must <hi>re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>member
to praise God in the
name of Iesus Christ.</hi> This
will quicken him: Daily
thankfulnesse will breed
daily alacrity in wel-doing:
Hee that will not be thank<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full
for beginnings of suc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cesse
in the practice of ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
duties, will not hold out:
<hi>This is the</hi> speciall <hi>will of
Christ, that wee should in all

            <p>He must <hi>study to be quiet,<note place="margin">11. Hee must study to bee quiet.</note>
and follow peace with all

is an excellent skill to bee
able to auoide the intan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>glements
of discord; es<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pecially
hee must prouide
to haue perfect peace
with the godly. Though
GOD bee able to sanc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tifie
the oppositions of
vnreasonable men, yet
wee must take heed of
drawing needlesse trou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bles

that makes vs neither to

This no doubt is the
reason why the holy Ghost
doth in Scripture make
Catalogues of certain spe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciall

fitted to the conditions of

or too much haste:
this is the ground of much
false zeale, and the cause of
strange euils in the prac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tice
of some Christians:
but the godly Christian
must learne of <hi>Salomon,</hi> to
<hi>prepare his work in the field,</hi>
               <pb n="50" facs="tcp:23076:50"/>

            <p>5 He must take heed of
the snares that arise from
<hi>distrustfull feares:</hi>
               <note place="margin">5. Distrust<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full feares.</note> There
is a snare in feare, <hi>Prou.</hi> 29.
25. There are many feares
will assault a man, that re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>solues
<pb n="52" facs="tcp:23076:51"/>
to liue well; As the
feare that hee cannot doe
good duties; The feare
that God will not accept
what hee doth; The feare
left men should scorne
him, or contemne him, or
lest hee should lose the fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uour
of his friends, or such
like. Now against all these
must the godly minde bee
armed, and take heed that
those feares prooue not
great hinderances to him;
and especially take heed of
that vnbeleefe, or coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terfet
humility, in disabling
himselfe, or mistrusting
God contrary to his nature

There are diuers things in
the generall, which are to
be obserued of the godly
Christian in all good du<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties,
<pb n="57" facs="tcp:23076:53"/>
which hee ought to
haue perfect in his memo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry,
and such as hee might
bring with him at all times
to forme his heart in re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>spect
of them, to beget in
him that holy manner of
carrying himselfe, which
is requisite vnto the accep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation
of the good things
he employeth himselfe in:
and the rather should hee
bee moued to the care of
learning and expressing of
these things, because the
matter of good duties
may be done by wicked
men, as they were by the
Pharises, and yet all abo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mination
to the Lord: That
<pb n="58" facs="tcp:23076:54"/>
therefore hee may not <hi>lose
what he worketh,</hi> hee must
striue in euery good acti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
to expresse these nine
things following in the
manner of his behauiour.</p>
            <p>The first thing required
in the manner of euery ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
duty,<note place="margin">1. Zeale, with con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinual wil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lingnesse and fer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uencie.</note> is <hi>Zeale:</hi> It is not
enough that hee doe the
dutie, but hee must do it
affectionately, bringing
with him the stirring of the
desires of his heart answe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rable,
and agreeable to the
duty he would performe:
<hi>Zeale</hi> hath in it two distinct
things, <hi>willingnesse</hi> and
<hi>feruencie;</hi> It must <hi>not seeme
euill</hi> to him to do Gods
<pb n="59" facs="tcp:23076:54"/>
worke, and in doing it, he
must <hi>lift vp his heart,</hi> so as
he performe it with <hi>all his
might, and with all his
soule;</hi> and this hee doth,
when either hee brings a
heart delighting in good
workes, or when hee iud<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>geth
himselfe for what
deadnesse, or distraction,
or vnwillingnesse he findes
in himselfe: He is accoun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted
zealous, when he striues
for it, and lifts vp his soule
against the impediments
which burthen him: This
zeale is necessary; <hi>Christ
died to redeeme a people vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to
himselfe,</hi> not onely that
would do good works, but
<pb n="60" facs="tcp:23076:55"/>
that would be <hi>zealous of
good workes, Tit.</hi> 2. 14.</p>
            <p>2 The second thing re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quired
in the manner of
good duties,<note place="margin">2. Sinceri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty, which hath in it 5. things.</note> is <hi>sincerity,</hi> all
his actions must bee done
in the sincerity of his
heart. The life of a Chris<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tian
is like a continuall
<hi>Passe-ouer;</hi> Now this <hi>Feast
hee must keepe alwaies with
the vnleauened bread of sin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerity,
1. Cor.</hi> 5. 8.</p>
            <p>Now this sinceritie hee
must shew diuers waies, as,</p>
            <p>1 By the <hi>truth of his
heart,</hi>
               <note place="margin">1. Truth.</note> as it stands oppo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed
to hypocrisie; he must
not talke of well-doing, or
seeme to do it, but he must
<pb n="61" facs="tcp:23076:55"/>
doe it indeed.</p>
            <p>2 By <hi>his respect to all
Gods commandements,</hi>
               <note place="margin">2. Respect to al Gods comman<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dements.</note> when
he can say with <hi>Dauid,</hi> I
<hi>esteeme all thy precepts, con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerning
all things to be right,
and I hate euery false way.</hi>
He that is truly sincere, ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>counteth
that <hi>euery word
of God is good,</hi> and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sires
to yeeld obedience in
all things. Hee hath not
his reseruations, or excep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions:
He doth not with
<hi>Herod</hi> giue himselfe liber<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty
to lie in the wilfull
breach of <hi>one commande<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment,</hi>
resting satisfied to
haue reformed himselfe in
other things. As he would
<pb n="62" facs="tcp:23076:56"/>
haue God to <hi>forgiue him all
his sinnes,</hi> so his heart de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sires
<hi>to forsake all sinne,</hi> and
so hee desires also to do e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uery
part of Gods worke.</p>
            <p>3. By <hi>propounding the
glory of God,</hi>
               <note place="margin">3. Right end.</note> as the chiefe
end of all his actions: <hi>His
praise must not be of men,</hi> nor
must hee doe good duties
for carnall ends, 1. <hi>Cor.</hi> 10.
31.</p>
            <p>4. By <hi>obeying without ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>postulating,</hi>
               <note place="margin">4. Obedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out expo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stulation.</note>
though God
giue no apparant reason of
his commandement. Thus
<hi>Abraham</hi> shewed his since<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity,
when God bade him
goe out of his owne coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>try,
though hee knew not
<pb n="63" facs="tcp:23076:56"/>
whither hee should goe,
<hi>Hebr.</hi> 11. 8. This is to o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bey
simply, because God
hath commanded it.</p>
            <p>5 By <hi>obeying absent as
well as present,</hi>
               <note place="margin">5. Obedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence in all places.</note> in <hi>all compa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nies
as well as one.</hi> This prai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed
the sincerity of the O<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bedience
of the <hi>Philippi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans,
Phil.</hi> 2. 12.</p>
            <p>Thus of sincerity, which
is the second thing requi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red
in the manner of well<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>doing.</p>
            <p>3. The third thing is
<hi>Constancy:</hi>
               <note place="margin">The third thing re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quired in the ma<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ner of well-doing, is Consta<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>cy.</note> 
               <hi>He is blessed that
doth righteousnesse alwaies.</hi>
Doing righteousnesse will
not serue the turne, but it
must be <hi>at all times, Psalm.</hi>
               <pb n="64" facs="tcp:23076:57"/>
106. 3. Our righteousnesse
must <hi>not be like the morning
dew.</hi> It is not sufficient to
doe good by fits; wee are
no day laborers, but Gods
hired seruants: <hi>Hee that is
righteous, must bee righteous
still, Rom. 6 19. Reuel.</hi> 22. 11.
There must be <hi>continuance
in well-doing, Rom.</hi> 2. 7, 8.</p>
            <p>Now to bee constant in
well-doing,<note place="margin">And he is constant, that doth good duties,</note> is to doe good
duties,</p>
            <p>1. <hi>Without wearinesse:</hi>
               <note place="margin">1. Without wearines.</note> It
is required as a thing ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cessary
to the manner of
well-doing, that we be not
weary of it, and that wee
faint not, <hi>Gal.</hi> 6. 9. This we
must striue for by prayer.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="65" facs="tcp:23076:57"/>2. <hi>Without discourage<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment:</hi>
               <note place="margin">2. Without discou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ragement.</note>
wee must lift <hi>vp the
hands that hang downe, and
the feeble knees, and make
straight steppes to our feete.</hi>
How much hinderance to
well-doing, discourage<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
is, may appeare by
the similitude: feeble knees
will dispatch but a little
space of the iourney, and
hands that hang down, are
not fit for worke: great is
the hinderance comes to
many by their discourage<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments
and aptnesse there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>unto,
which ariseth vsually
from pride, &amp; the dregs of
worldly sorrow, and ought
much to be resisted by true
<pb n="66" facs="tcp:23076:58"/>
Christians, <hi>Hebr.</hi> 12. 12, 13.
<hi>Iosh.</hi> 1. 6, 7.</p>
            <p>3. <hi>Without impediment:</hi>
               <note place="margin">3. Notwithstan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pedime<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ts.</note>
That is, notwithstanding
all the impediments may
be cast in the way; Iudge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
should runne downe
<hi>as waters,</hi> and righteous<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>nesse
<hi>as a flowing streame:</hi>
wee should ouercome all
difficulties: you cannot
stop the flowing streame,
though you cast in great
logs or stones, yea though
you would goe about to
damme it vp; and such
should be the resolution of
a godly Christian, <hi>Amos</hi>
3. 24.</p>
            <p>4. <hi>Without wauering or
<pb n="67" facs="tcp:23076:58"/>
vncertainty.</hi>
               <note place="margin">4. With<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uering.</note> It is <hi>vncer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taine
running</hi> the Apostle
implyedly forbids, 1. <hi>Cor.</hi> 9.
25. Our life is like a race:
Now in a race it is not e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nough
that a man runne
now and then, though he
runne fiercely for the time:
He must not trifle &amp; looke
behinde, and stand still at
his pleasure, and then run
againe, but he must be al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>waies
running: so ought it
to be with vs in the race of
godlinesse. It will not serue
the turne to bee good by
fits, and to bee forward in
good things onely at some
times, and then be careles,
and off the hookes, as wee
<pb n="68" facs="tcp:23076:59"/>
say, at other times.</p>
            <p>5. <hi>Without declining or
going backe.</hi>
               <note place="margin">5. Without declining.</note> 
               <hi>Iob</hi> comforts
himselfe against the asper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sion
of hypocrifie by this,
that <hi>his foot had held on his
steps, and Gods waies he had
kept, and not declined, nor
had hee gone backe from Gods
Commandements, Iob</hi> 23. 11,
12. Though hee had not
made such Progresse as he
desired, yet this was his
comfort, he had not backe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>slided
by Apostasie.</p>
            <p>And thus of the third
thing also required in the
manner of well-doing,
which is Constancy.</p>
            <p>4.<note place="margin">4. Feare.</note> The fourth thing
<pb n="69" facs="tcp:23076:59"/>
required is <hi>feare:</hi> thus <hi>Pro.
28. 14. The man is blessed
that feareth alwaies.</hi> And 1.
<hi>Pet.</hi> 1. 17. &amp; 3. 2. <hi>Our con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uersation
must be with feare:</hi>
This feare excludes rude<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse,
carelesnesse, concei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tednesse,
pride, &amp; the like,
&amp; includes Reuerence, aw<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full
regard of Gods holi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse,
or holy presence
(whom wee should set al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>waies
before vs) and the
feare of the deceitfulnesse
of sinne, and our own cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rupt
dispositions, and the
care to auoyd all occasi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons
of offending God or
men.</p>
            <p>The fift thing is <hi>simplici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty.</hi>
               <note place="margin">Simplicity</note>
               <pb n="70" facs="tcp:23076:60"/>
This is so necessary, as
the Apostle mistrusted
most the subtilty of the
Diuel, <hi>in beguiling Christi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans
of this simplicity, which
they had in Iesus Christ, 2.
Cor.</hi> 11. 3.</p>
            <p>Now this simplicity
containes in it distinctly
diuers things.</p>
            <p>1.<note place="margin">Which is, 1. To rest vpon the Word for the formes of holines &amp; happinesse.</note> 
               <hi>A resting in those forms

of well-doing, making vs
hold out, though wee bee
scorned, or disgraced, or
opposed in the world, and
raising vp our hearts to be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leeue

            <p>The ninth &amp; last thing
required in the manner of
wel-doing,<note place="margin">The last is moderatio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
               </note> is Moderation.
<pb n="78" facs="tcp:23076:64"/>
This rule is expressed in
these words,<note place="margin">The place in Eccl. 7. 16. ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pounded.</note> 
               <hi>Eccles. 7. 16.
Be not iust ouer-much, ney<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
bee thou wicked ouer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>much:</hi>
Now for the sense
of these words, wee must
know in the negatiue, that
this place is most pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phanely
alleadged by such
as produce it as a reproofe
of strictnesse of life, and the
refusall of the excesses of
the time.</p>
            <p>There are many things
said to giue a sence of those
words.</p>
            <p>1. Some referre these
words to Iustice, eyther
Distributiue, or Commu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tatiue,
and that eyther in
<pb n="79" facs="tcp:23076:64"/>
the case of a priuate per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son,
or of a Magistrate. A
priuate man must neyther
stand too much vpon his
right, nor yet suffer his in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nocency
to be too much
wronged. A Magistrate
must not be too seuere in a
selfe-conceited Iustice, nor
yet too remisse in sparing
or fauouring wickednes.</p>
            <p>2. Some thinke it re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>straines
curiosity and care<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lesnes,
as if the sence were,
Be not curious to pry or
search into secret things,
that are not reuealed: for
hee that will bee searching
into Gods maiesty, may be
oppressed by his glory: nor
<pb n="80" facs="tcp:23076:65"/>
yet be so carelesse, as not to
take notice of the truth re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uealed.</p>
            <p>3. Some thus exceed
not by too much precise<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse
on the right hand, or
by too much prophanenes
on the left hand. On the
right hand they goe out,
that bring in workes of su<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pererogation,
and such as
worship God after the pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cepts
of men, and such as
tye mens consciences to
obserue or auoid things
without warrant of Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture,
and such as say they
haue no sin, and need not
the grace of God.</p>
            <p>4. Lastly, the fittest in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terpretation
<pb n="81" facs="tcp:23076:65"/>
is theirs, that
expound the words in this
sense, <hi>Be not iust ouer-much,</hi>
that is, think not too high<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
of thy selfe in any thing
thou doest well, nor yet be
<hi>wicked ouer-much,</hi> that is,
account not too vilely of
thy selfe, denying Gods
gifts in thee, and refusing
the iust comforts thou

aggrauate not against thy

<pb n="84" facs="tcp:23076:67"/>
The foundation of our <hi>loue</hi>
to <hi>God,</hi> is the true <hi>knowlege

and easie way to
thinke of God. Since our
hearts cannot conceiue his
Nature, we should fill them
with the impression of his
praises, and according to
them direct our affection,
and seruice to him: As I

by commending their ver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tues,
or their worthy <hi>Acts:</hi>
               <pb n="107" facs="tcp:23076:78"/>
And this is likewise one
great way of honouring
God: &amp; therefore with sor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>row
for our neglects here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in,
we should <hi>study his prai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ses</hi>
for the time to come,
and striue for language to

            <p>Now God is praised di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uers
wayes.<note place="margin">Rules a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout the praise of God.</note> Some of them
belong not properly to
this place, and therefore I
will but touch them.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>We praise God.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>1. When <hi>we keepe</hi> and
obserue carefully <hi>the solem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nities</hi>
set apart for his
praise, as when wee cele<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brate
the Sacrament of the
Lords Supper, which is
<pb n="108" facs="tcp:23076:79"/>
therfore called the Eucha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rist,
because it is to be per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formed
as a thanksgiuing,
and praising of God.</p>
            <p>2. When daily we take
all occasions in priuate <hi>to
blesse God for his daily mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cies:</hi>
but let these and such
like passe, as not proper to

him in our discourse to o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers:<note place="margin">When we commend God, di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uers things are to be ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>scued.</note>
This is required of
vs in many Scriptures, <hi>Psa.
33. 1. Iob 36. 24. Psal.</hi> 96. 4.
But because this must not
bee done cursorily, diuers
rules are to bee obserued:
As,</p>
            <p>1. That we may praise
him effectually, wee must
<pb n="109" facs="tcp:23076:79"/>
               <hi>wisely consider of his workes,</hi>
and so of his nature to ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tract
from thence sound
<hi>arguments</hi> of praise, <hi>Psalm.</hi>
64. 9.</p>
            <p>2. We should do well
for this purpose to <hi>keep Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cords,
and Register</hi> vp the
speciall glorious workes of
God, <hi>Iob.</hi> 36. 24. &amp; 37. 14.
<hi>Psalm.</hi> 78. 7.</p>
            <p>3. When we do praise
him, it must be done <hi>with
our whole heart,</hi> speaking of
his prayses with all possible
affection, and not as if we
spake of ordinary things,
<hi>Psalm.</hi> 9. 1.</p>
            <p>4. VVe must thus praise
him, not once, or for one
<pb n="110" facs="tcp:23076:80"/>
worke of his, but wee must
<hi>praise him for all his workes,</hi>
especially <hi>his wonderous
works, Psal.</hi> 9. 1. &amp; 105. 1, 2.
&amp; 106. 2.</p>
            <p>5. VVe must praise him
from day to day, and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinue
to doe it, <hi>while wee
liue, Psal.</hi> 63. 4. &amp; 96. 3.</p>
            <p>6. This is a duety, that
<hi>all the kindreds of the people
are bound to: All the people
must praise him, Psalm.</hi> 148.
12, 13. &amp; 96. 6, 7, 8.</p>
            <p>Thus of the fift way of
shewing our loue to God,
and that is by honouring
him.</p>
            <p>The sixth way by which
wee must shew our loue to
<pb n="111" facs="tcp:23076:80"/>
God,<note place="margin">6. By trusting in him.</note> is, by <hi>trusting in him;</hi>
As men shew, whom they
loue most, by relying most
vpon them, and their fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uour
and helpe; Now there
are diuers cases, in which
we must shew our trust in
God.</p>
            <p>1 <hi>By relying vpon his
mercy for our iustification
and saluation:</hi>
               <note place="margin">How wee must shew it that we trust God.</note> and in this
wee should most vse our
trust, as being in a businesse
that most highly concernes
vs, <hi>Esay</hi> 45. 24, 25.</p>
            <p>2 <hi>By committing all our
workes to him,</hi> for assis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance
in them<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> or successe
of them: This is to <hi>commit
our way to God</hi> to be carefull
<pb n="112" facs="tcp:23076:81"/>
to seeke his assistance to
helpe vs, to doe our duty,
and then to leaue the suc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cesse
of all to his blessing,
<hi>Psal. 37. 3, 5. Prou.</hi> 16. 3.</p>
            <p>3 By <hi>beleeuing all that
hee saith is true,</hi> whether
hee promise, threaten, or
comfort by his Word, vp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
all occasions <hi>beleeuing
his Prophets, 2. Chro.</hi> 20. 20.</p>
            <p>4 By <hi>staying our hearts
vpon him in all our distres<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ses:</hi>
               <note place="margin">How wee may proue that wee trust God in distresse</note>
Now in the time of
distresse we may proue, that
wee trust in God diuers
waies:—As</p>
            <p>1 By running to him,
and <hi>powring out our hearts
before him,</hi> making our
<pb n="113" facs="tcp:23076:81"/>
moane vnto him, <hi>Psa.</hi> 18. 2.
&amp; 62. 10. Looke amongst
men, to whom we first run
to make our moane in our
distresse, and that person
is he whom we most loue,
and trust: so is it toward
God.</p>
            <p>2 By <hi>casting our cares and
burthens vpon him, Psal.</hi>
55. 22.</p>
            <p>3 By <hi>not respecting the
proud, and such as turne a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>side
to lies, Psal.</hi> 40. 4.</p>
            <p>4 By <hi>relying vpon his
help, Ioel 3. 16. Esay</hi> 50. 11.
but then we must obserue
how wee must relye vpon
Gods helpe: For there are
many things we must cast
<pb n="114" facs="tcp:23076:82"/>
out of our hearts in afflic<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion:<note place="margin">In relying vpon God in afflicti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, wee must a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uoid fiue things.</note>
When wee haue
beene with the Lord and
committed our selues to
him, wee must relie vpon
him,</p>
            <p>1 <hi>Without leaning to our
owne vnder standing,</hi> or
wilfull inclination to fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low
our owne courses,
and proiects, <hi>Prou.</hi> 3. 5.</p>
            <p>2 <hi>Without murmuring</hi>
or repining at our con<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>dition,
or vexing our
selues at the prouidence
of God toward vs, <hi>Psal.</hi>
37. 7.</p>
            <p>3 <hi>Without feare,</hi> that
is, without mistrustfull
feares, and seruile per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turbations,
<pb n="115" facs="tcp:23076:82"/>
imagining
euils, which the Lord
hath not brought vpon
vs, <hi>Psal.</hi> 3. 6. &amp; 27. 1.</p>
            <p>4 <hi>Without vsing ill
meanes</hi> to get out of dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tresse,
<hi>Amos</hi> 5. 4, 6.</p>
            <p>5 Yea, lastly, <hi>without
care,</hi> that is, without dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trustfull
carking cares,
<hi>Phil.</hi> 4. 6.</p>
            <p>Thus of the sixth way of
shewing our loue to God,
and that is by trusting in
him.</p>
            <p>The seuenth &amp; last way,<note place="margin">7. By obey<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing him.</note>
by which we must shew our
loue to God, is, <hi>To obey
him:</hi> For this is the <hi>loue of
God, that wee keepe his com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mandements:</hi>
               <pb n="116" facs="tcp:23076:83"/>
Neither is
the signe in this, that wee
do what God requires for
the matter, but that <hi>his
co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>mandements are not grie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uous
vnto vs:</hi> Wee loue
God, if wee loue to doe
his worke, and if wee <hi>lift
vp our hearts in his waies,</hi>
setting vpon his work with
a speciall readinesse, and
strength of desire, and
more then ordinary care,
1. <hi>Ioh. 5. 2. 2. Chron.</hi> 17. 6. &amp;
19. 2.</p>
            <p>Thus of the matter, that
is, the things by which we
must shew our loue to God;
The manner also is to bee
considered: For in all those
<pb n="117" facs="tcp:23076:83"/>
things which we would do
at any time to prooue our
loue to God, we must look
to the manner how wee do
them, as was a little tou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ched
before:<note place="margin">2. Things in the manner of shew<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing our loue to God.</note> Now dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinctly

must bee more inflamed

Howsoeuer with men true
loue casts our feare: yet

must loue him, but yet
with feare. Now that this
may not be mistaken, I will
set downe the particulars
of this feare.</p>
            <p>Wee must shew our
feare:<note place="margin">Eight wayes by which we shew our feare of God.</note>

            <p>3 By vsing all <hi>tearmes

the same place: prayer pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>serues
acquaintance with
God, and exceedingly <hi>quic<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kens</hi>
the heart; and be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sides,
drawes from God
new pledges of his loue to
vs, which may serue to kin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dle
our affections toward
him.</p>
            <p>5. In the same place a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nother
rule is imported;
and that is the daily <hi>expec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation
of the Comming of
<pb n="125" facs="tcp:23076:87"/>
Christ:</hi> for the terrour of
that Day will mooue vs to
shew all possible loue to
God, and so will that sin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gular
Glory wee are assu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red
to receiue in that Day.</p>
            <p>6. In the vse of all Gods
Ordinances, wee must bee
carefull <hi>to seeke out the face
of God,</hi> which is that speci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>all
presence of his grace.
For the loue of God will
decay in vs, if once wee
come to vse the meanes
onely for forme, and an
outward shew, <hi>Ps.</hi> 105. 4.
And if wee misse of God
in his Ordinances, we must
neuer be quiet, till we <hi>finde
him whom our soule loueth,
<pb n="126" facs="tcp:23076:88"/>
Cant. 3. 1. Psalm.</hi> 63. 1.</p>
            <p>7 VVee must <hi>preserue
the truth</hi> hee hath deliue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red
to vs; yea, wee must
<hi>contend for it:</hi> for sound
doctrine laid vp in our
hearts, will preserue in vs
soundnesse of affection to
God, <hi>Iude</hi> 3.</p>
            <p>8. VVee must get <hi>Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>talogues
of Gods praises</hi> in
particular, and fill our
hearts with the knowledge
&amp; contemplation of them.</p>
            <p>9 If we would be pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>serued
in the loue of God,
wee must labour to attaine
to the ability <hi>to reioyce in
God,</hi> and <hi>delight our selues
in God.</hi> A wife that would
<pb n="127" facs="tcp:23076:88"/>
increase her loue to her
husband, must striue to so<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lace
her selfe often with her
husband, and to forme in
her heart a speciall delight
in him: So must wee doe
to God. This is miserably
neglected, and yet excee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding
necessary: Nor is it
an ordinary ioy we should
take in God, but we should
ioy in him, first, <hi>with all our
hearts:</hi> 2. not for a time,
but <hi>alwaies,</hi> euery day; nor
with co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>mon, but with <hi>excee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding

<pb n="128" facs="tcp:23076:89"/>
what it is to delight and

               </gap>oy in God: secondly, what
we should doe that might

in God.</p>
            <p>1. For the first,<note place="margin">What it is to reioyce or delight our selues in God.</note> this delight
in God hath in it foure
things distinctly.</p>
            <p>1 First, a <hi>spirituall satisfac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion,</hi>
or contentment ari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sing
from the assurance of

enough that he regards vs;
thus <hi>Dauid</hi> saith, his <hi>soule

Psal.</hi> 63. 5. &amp; 149. 2.</p>

entertainement of all passa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ges
of loue betweene God
and vs; especially in the
<pb n="129" facs="tcp:23076:89"/>
vse of his Ordinances.</p>
            <p>3. Thirdly, a <hi>delightfull
contemplation</hi> of God and
his mercies.</p>
            <p>4. Fourthly, a <hi>glorying in
God,</hi> and extolling of his
praises, as by discourse, so
by <hi>singing of Psalmes, 1. Cor.
1. 31. Psal.</hi> 33. 1. &amp; 105. 3. &amp;

our selues with all the ioy
we can <hi>in the Word of God,
Psal.</hi> 119. 14, 16.</p>
            <p>4. VVee must take heed
of listning to Obiections
against the loue of God to
vs, whether they arise from
Sathan, or our owne flesh.</p>

our happy estate in Christ,
<hi>Hab.</hi> 3. 17, 18.</p>
            <p>6 VVee must seek a de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lightfull

            <p>
               <pb n="131" facs="tcp:23076:90"/>7 VVee must take heed
of domesticall euils, our

that would daily pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uaile
in vs, <hi>Iob</hi> 22. 23, 26.</p>
            <p>8 VVee must restraine
our owne vnbeleefe about
the acceptation of the
good duties we performe,
and to this end wee must
take heed, that we be <hi>nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther

too much to our
selues: nor yet <hi>wicked ouer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>much,</hi>
in condemning all we
do, as hatefull to God. For
this last doth maruellously
hinder vs from ioying in
God.</p>

these may be cast into two
rankes: 1. for they either
concerne the <hi>parts</hi> of Gods

            <p>The Rules that concerne

that concerne some part of

            <p>Now for the generall

            </p>
            <p>1. The first is <hi>preparcti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on;</hi>
wee must in some sort
conferre with our owne
hearts, and prepare them,
before wee go before God
<pb n="134" facs="tcp:23076:92"/>
to doe any seruice, <hi>Iob 11.

<hi>godly feare, Hebr. 12. 28.
Psal.</hi> 2. 11.</p>
            <p>3. Thirdly, we must per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>forme
the seruice <hi>in repen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance</hi>
for our sinnes: wee
must not come before
God in the loue of any sin:
if wee doe, we lose our la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bour,
and God will loath
our workes, <hi>Isai. 1. Iob.</hi> 11.
14. VVee must haue <hi>cleane

else no seruice of God will
be accepted, <hi>Psalm.</hi> 119. 11.

            <p>4. Fourthly, it must

grieue vs, that others will
not serue God, <hi>Psalm.</hi> 119.
139.</p>
            <p>5. Fifthly, we must per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>forme
euery seruice <hi>in the
name of Christ,</hi> or else it
cannot bee accepted, by
reason of that euill that
cleaues to our best workes,
whether wee pray or giue
thankes, or <hi>Whatsoeuer we
doe, wee must doe it in the
name of Christ, Col.</hi> 3. 17.</p>
            <p>6. Sixtly, in euery ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uice
of God wee must so
neer as it may be, <hi>giue God
the first place,</hi> preferring the
respects of God and his
worship, before our selues,

God in the first place,
<hi>Iob 8. 5. Math. 6. 34. Psalm.</hi>
5. 3.</p>

cheefely carefull to see

worship, our praise must
be of God, and not of men,
<hi>Heb. 12. 28. Rom.</hi> 2. 26.</p>
            <p>9. Ninthly, wee must

that wee may truely

            <p>2. By confirming our

            <p>3. By stirring vp others
with all importunity to go
vp with them to worship
God in Sion, <hi>Esay</hi> 2. 2.</p>
            <p>4. By making haste to
Gods worship, going to

with a holy thirst after the

thither <hi>as the clouds,</hi> or

<hi>Psalm.</hi> 119. 136.</p>
            <p>Thus of that speciall
zeale wee should shew a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout

the voyce of one man,
when the Lord speakes to

other rules, which in a spe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciall

house.</p>
            <p>1. First, wee should al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>waies
be <hi>as green Oliue trees
in the house of the Lord.</hi>
               <pb n="145" facs="tcp:23076:97"/>
Howsoeuer it go with men
in the world, yet when wee
come before the Lord, our
hearts should reioyce and
reuiue, and our spirits bee
fresh and cheerefull, and
our affections should bee
healed of all the cares or
distempers were before in
them. Gods ordinances
should haue such a power
ouer vs, as to make a sud<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>den
fresh spring of desires,
and holy thoughts in vs.
There is this power in the
ordinances of God to ef<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect
this, if the fault be not
in vs, I meane, when these
ordinances are exercised
in the power &amp; life of the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="146" facs="tcp:23076:98"/>2. Secondly, wee must
<hi>trust on the mercy of GOD,</hi>
bringing a heart ready to
beleeue euery good word
of God, resoluing, that if
the Lord will speake com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fortably
to his seruants, we
will not dishonor his co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>so<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lations
through carelesnes,
or vnbeleefe: but receiue
them with all our hearts,
and establish our selues in
the safe keeping of his
good word.</p>
            <p>3. Thirdly, we must re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>solue
to be <hi>thankefull,</hi> with
all tendernesse for all expe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riences
of Gods presence
and goodnesse towards vs
in the means, vowing with
<pb n="147" facs="tcp:23076:98"/>
               <hi>Dauid, to praise him for e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uer</hi>
for them. And if the
Lord doe with-hold his
power and presence for a
time, so as we feele not the
effectualnesse of his ordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nances:
yet we should re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>solue
without distemper, <hi>to
wait vpon the Lord,</hi> and ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>serue
him according to the
seasons of his grace.</p>

his very feete to receiue his
Law,</hi> Deut. 33. 3.</p>
            <p>2. VVe must bring with
vs a <hi>meeke and quiet spirit,</hi> a
minde quieted from passi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons,
lusts, and perturbati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons,
and at rest from the
<pb n="150" facs="tcp:23076:100"/>
turmoyling cares of this
world. The world is able
to doe great things in our
hearts, if wee <hi>receiue it with
meekenesse, Iam.</hi> 1. 19.</p>
            <p>Secondly,<note place="margin">2. In the time of hearing.</note> at the time of
hearing, we must looke to
two rules.</p>
            <p>First, wee must hearken
without distraction: wee
must heare, as it were for
our liues, wee must <hi>incline
our eares,</hi> and shake off all
impediments arising from
our owne drowsinesse, pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iudice,
or vaine thoughts,
or distracting obiects, <hi>Esay
55. 3. Psal.</hi> 119. 113.</p>
            <p>Secondly, we must <hi>proue
all things, and keepe that
<pb n="151" facs="tcp:23076:100"/>
which is good.</hi> Wee must
heare with iudgement, and
hearken for our selues, ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uing
speciall care to looke
to that doctrine which in
particular concernes vs to
lay it vp in our hearts, and
apply it effectually. This
is a rule of singular thrift
in godlinesse. If wee did
marke what sinne in vs the
Lord reprooues, or what
comfort is specially fitted
to our hearts: or what di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rection
doeth specially
concerne vs: He hath an
honest memory that will
bee sure to keepe these
things,<note place="margin">Note.</note> though hee forget
all the rest, and hee hath a
<pb n="152" facs="tcp:23076:101"/>
wretched memory, and
hart too, that forgets these
things, though hee could
r<gap reason="illegible" resp="#OXF" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>peat all the Sermon <hi>ver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>batim.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Thirdly,<note place="margin">3. After we haue heard.</note> after wee haue
heard, two things also must
be further done.</p>
            <p>First, wee must by <hi>medi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation</hi>
labor to make those
things wee haue heard,
which concerne vs, fast,
that they runne not out of
our mindes, and wee must
take heed that neyther the
Diuell steale away the
good seed, nor our owne
heart through negligence
forget it. Neyther is this a
worke for an houre after,
<pb n="153" facs="tcp:23076:101"/>
to keepe these things till
we may repeate them to o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers,
but ought to be our
daily worke, especially the
weeke after to thinke so of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten
of them, till there be a
sure impression of the
VVord in our hearts, <hi>Hebr.</hi>
2. 1, 2.</p>
            <p>Secondly, wee must yet
further see to it, that we be
<hi>doers of the Word,</hi> yea wee
must <hi>obserue to doe:</hi> as the
phrase of the holy Ghost
is. It is the wisedome of
God so to dispose of his or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinances,
that wee receiue
our directions by parcels,
and there is a time of <hi>inte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rim</hi>
between Sabbath and
<pb n="154" facs="tcp:23076:102"/>
Sabbath, Sermon and Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon,
that we might in that
space learne to frame our
selues to the obedience of
the truths receiued, that so
we might bee ready to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiue
new lessons from the
Lord. The surest way for
the husbandman to keepe
his seed, is not to lay it vp
in his barne, but to cast it
into the ground. For what
is sowed, he may receiue a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gaine
with aduantage; or
if hee might faile of a har<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uest
from his seede in na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture,
yet godly men shall
neuer faile to receiue what
they sowe by practice, with
increase. So much of the
<pb n="155" facs="tcp:23076:102"/>
Truth, as is put into pra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctice,
is sure for euer: The
rest may be lost: and it is a
singular helpe to a Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stian,
if he set vpon his obe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dience,
while the doctrine
is yet fresh in his minde;
for delay will compasse
him about with many dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficulties,
and hee will want
those inward incitations,
that might stirre vp his
heart with power and
strength to obey.</p>

and the Lords Sup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per.</p>
            <p>The duties we are bound
to in respect of Baptisme,
concerne either
<list>
                  <item>1. Our children.</item>
                  <item>2. Our selues.</item>

               </list>
            </p>
            <p>For our children,<note place="margin">1. About our chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren.</note> it is
our duty to present them
vnto Baptisme, but with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>all
we must looke to it, that
it be done in due time, and
with faith and thankeful<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse
to God: In due time,
so as thereby wee signifie
our great estimation of
Gods mercy to our seed,
and our great desire to
haue the Couenant sealed,
euen vnto them. We must
also bring them to Bap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tisme
with faith in Gods
Couenant. The Lord
hath bound himselfe to <hi>bee
our God, and the God of our
seed:</hi> Now it is our parts to
<pb n="158" facs="tcp:23076:104"/>
giue glory to God, and to
declare before the Lord
our perswasion of his
goodnesse and claime to
that part of his Couenant.
By faith wee plead our
right, wheras by vnbeleefe
wee giue God occasion to
neglect our seed. I adde
also with <hi>thankfulnesse,</hi> be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause
we ought with great
ioy and acknowledgement
of the free grace of God,
to behold our seed admit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted
in the sure couenant of
mercy and saluation with
our selues, and ought to
thinke that God hath done
more for our children, to
admit them into Coue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant
<pb n="159" facs="tcp:23076:104"/>
by Baptisme, then if
the greatest person on
earth had made vpon them
the assurance of some great
estate of maintenance or
preferment.</p>
            <p>Secondly,<note place="margin">2. About our selues.</note> for our selues,
we must make conscience
of it, to make vse of our
owne Baptisme, and that
throughout the whole
course of our life: It is gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uen
vs as a <hi>seale</hi> of Gods
promises, and as a <hi>vow</hi> of
our obedience, and so we
must make vse of it all the
daies of our life, especial<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
in three cases:<note place="margin">In three cases.</note>
            </p>
            <p>First, in <hi>the case of
doubting</hi> and feare of the
<pb n="160" facs="tcp:23076:105"/>
forgiuenesse of our sinnes,
or of the saluation of our
soules: for <hi>Baptisme saueth
vs,</hi> that is, effectually as<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sures
vs of our saluation;
and wee doe not offend in
trusting Gods promise
made in his Word, and
signed and sealed in Bap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tisme.
As certainely doth
it saue our soules, as the
<hi>Arke saued the</hi> bodies of
<hi>Noah</hi> and his houshold; so
as wee cannot miscarry, if
wee leape not out of the
Arke into the Seas of wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters.
Let vs stick to our
Baptisme, and then we are
safe: The washing in Bap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tisme
did assure the wash<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
<pb n="161" facs="tcp:23076:105"/>
of our soules by the
Bloud of Christ for our
sinnes. If I be tempted to
doubt of my saluation, I
must say to my own soule,
Hath not the Lord proui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded
me the Arke of Bap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tisme
to preserue me from
the seas of his wrath? And
if I doubt the forgiuenesse
of sinnes, I must say, Hath
not the Lord washed mee
from my sins by the bloud
of his Sonne? Did hee
not shew mee so much in
Baptisme? VVee sinne
shamefully, in that wee doe
not make this vse, but neg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lect
the confidence Bap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tisme
should worke in vs,
<pb n="162" facs="tcp:23076:106"/>
as if the Lord had but dal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lied
with vs, or that Bap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tisme
were but some idle
Ceremony, 1. <hi>Pet. 3. 21. 1.
Cor. 15. 29. Act.</hi> 22. 16.</p>
            <p>2. Secondly,<note place="margin">How Bap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tisme may helpe vs against sinne.</note> in the case
of temptation to commit
sinne: we ought to fight a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainst
sinne by his mighty
<hi>weapon</hi> of our Baptisme,
and so wee may doe by di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uers
arguments: As</p>
            <p>First, in my Baptisme I
haue made a vow to God,
that I would cleaue to him
in Iesus Christ, and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nounce
the world, the de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uill
and sinne: and shall I
break my vow to God, that
would bee ashamed to
<pb n="163" facs="tcp:23076:106"/>
break my promise to men?</p>
            <p>Secondly, my Baptisme
was the <hi>Baptisme of repen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance:</hi>
and shall I yet liue in
sinne? My body was wash<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed:
and shall my soule bee
still impure? <hi>Math. 3. 11.
Mark. 1. 4. Acts</hi> 13. 24.</p>
            <p>Thirdly, by Baptisme I
was assured of the <hi>vertue
of the death of Christ</hi> to kill
sinne in me: And shall I
not beleeue the <hi>operation
of God,</hi> that hee can deli<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>uer
me from the power, or
powerfull temptations, or
inclinations to any sinne?
Shall I not seek strength of
Christ? or shall I betray
my selfe to the deuill and
<pb n="164" facs="tcp:23076:107"/>
the flesh? In Christ I <hi>am
dead to sinne, and shall I
yet liue therein? Rom. 6. 1, 3.
Col.</hi> 2. 12.</p>
            <p>Thirdly, our Baptisme
must bee vsed against the
doubts of perseuering, or
whether we shall bee kept
vnto saluation, and whether
our bodies shall bee raised
againe at the last Day: for
God hath assured all this
vnto vs in our Baptism, that
we haue our part not onely
in the death of Christ, but
also in the resurrection of
Christ: and if Christ bee
raised in vs, <hi>Christ can die
no more,</hi> either in him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selfe,
or in our hearts,
<pb n="165" facs="tcp:23076:107"/>
and <hi>the same power, that
raised him out of the graue,
will also raise vp our bodies
at the last Day,</hi> as is plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded,
<hi>Romanes</hi> 6. 10, &amp;c.
<hi>Galath. 3. 27, 28. 1. Cor. 15.
29. 1. Pet.</hi> 3. 21. If wee <hi>be
baptized, and beleeue, wee
shall certainely bee saued,
Mark.</hi> 16. 16.</p>
            <p>Thus as it concernes
our selues.</p>
            <p>3. In respect of others,<note place="margin">3. In re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>spect of o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers.</note>
we are bound to the good
behauiour in Baptisme, as
to acknowledge the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>munion
of Saints: so are we
tied to preserue our selues
in all brotherly loue with
the godly, who weare the
<pb n="166" facs="tcp:23076:108"/>
same Liuery with vs, and
are Souldiers prest to
the same warre, and haue
taken vpon them the same
holy Vow with vs: we are
bound in Baptisme to loue
them, to stand for them a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>boue
all other people, and
to liue with them in all ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
loue, to our liues end,

not bee vnderstood so, as
that those persons sinne,
which reade not so often,
or so many chapters, or the

that must necessarily be ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>serued
by such as can reade

two.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="187" facs="tcp:23076:118"/>1. First, <hi>Before thou vow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>est,
consider:</hi> consider, I say,
thine owne <hi>strength,</hi> whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
thou be able to do it:
and consider also the <hi>end,</hi>
that it bee to Gods glory;
and consider the <hi>matter,</hi>
that thou vow not things

what may be the <hi>euents</hi> of
thy Vow, for all Vowes be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
made <hi>before the Angell,</hi>
that takes notice of all

it was an errour, thou wast

the worke of thy hands:</hi> Be
not <hi>rash therefore, to cause
<pb n="188" facs="tcp:23076:119"/>
thy flesh to sinne</hi> therein.</p>
            <p>2. Secondly, when thou
hast vowed thy vow to
God, <hi>deferre not to pay it,</hi>
be sure thou performe it:
it is a grieuous offence to
breake a lawfull vow: <hi>Bet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
it is thou shouldst not
vow, then that thou shouldst
vow, and not pay.</hi>

            <p>Concerning the Oath,<note place="margin">Rules a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout Swearing.</note>
when thou art called to

not by any thing which is not
God, Ier.</hi> 5. 7.</p>
            <p>Secondly, that thou
<hi>sweare in truth,</hi> that is, that
<pb n="189" facs="tcp:23076:119"/>
thy conscience know, what
thou swearest is true.</p>
            <p>Thirdly, that thou
<hi>sweare in iudgement,</hi> that is,
with due consideration of
the nature of God, and
with sound deliberation,
not rashly, and diligently
weighing of all things, that
belong to the matter thou
swearest about.</p>
            <p>Fourthly, that thou <hi>sweare
in righteousnesse,</hi> that is a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout
lawfull things, &amp; iust
matters: Thou must not
sweare to do vniust things,
as <hi>Dauid</hi> sware to kil <hi>Nabal:</hi>
nor must thou swear about
impossible things, or about
things that are doubtfull
<pb n="190" facs="tcp:23076:120"/>
and vncertaine: Nor in
the forme of thy oath must
thou vse such words, as be

these two Rules.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="191" facs="tcp:23076:120"/>First,<note place="margin">The Rules about a religious Fast.</note> wee must looke to
the strictnesse of the <hi>absti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nence</hi>
in the day of our Fast;
for we must abstaine from

            <p>Secondly, the time must
bee spent in religious du<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties,
as a Sabbath, especi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally
in the exercises that

that concerne <hi>the
parts of Gods worship:</hi> The
rules, that concerne <hi>the

and this time especially is
the Sabbath day.</p>
            <p>Now the rules,<note place="margin">Rules a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout the Sabbath.</note> that bind
vs to the good behauiour
concerning the Sabbath,
co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>cern either the prepara<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
to the Sabbath, or the
maner of performing holy
duties on the Sabbath.</p>
            <p>The preparation to the
Sabbath,<note place="margin">1. The pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>paration to it.</note> containes in it
<pb n="194" facs="tcp:23076:122"/>
these things.</p>
            <p>First, <hi>the ending of all our
workes</hi> on the sixe daies, as
God did his: <hi>Gen.</hi> 2. 2.</p>
            <p>This example of God is
set downe, not onely to
shew what hee did, but to
prescribe vnto vs, what we
should doe, as is manifest
by vrging this example in
the reason of the comman<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dement:
We must then
take order to finish the
workes of the weeke daies
with such discretion, that
neither our heads be trou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bled
with the cares of
them, nor our hands temp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted
to worke about them
on the Sabbath day.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="195" facs="tcp:23076:122"/>Secondly, the preuen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting

Discords and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tentions,
and heart-bur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nings
in the members of
the family, extend their in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fection,
and hurt, euen to
the prophaning of Gods
Sabbath. The Lord looks
not to bee serued aright in
his House, if people liue
not quietly, and louingly,
and dutifully in their own
houses.</p>
            <p>Thirdly, we must <hi>cleanse
our selues, that we may keep
<pb n="196" facs="tcp:23076:123"/>
the Sabbath, Nehem.</hi> 13.
22. Which place, though
it speake of Legall clean<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sing,
yet it shadowes out
that Moral and perpetuall
care of cleansing our
selues, that ought euen to
be found in vs. And thus
we doe cleanse our selues,
when <hi>we humble our selues,
that we may walk with God,</hi>
confessing our sinnes, euen
the sinnes of the weeke
past, &amp; making our peace
with God, through the
name of Iesus Christ.</p>
            <p>Thus of the duties of
preparation:<note place="margin">2. Of the celebrati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of the Sabbath.</note> Now for the
manner of keeping the
Sabbath, the rules pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>scribe
<pb n="197" facs="tcp:23076:123"/>
vnto vs these things:</p>
            <p>1. <hi>Rest from all our works,</hi>
whether they be <hi>workes of
labour,</hi> or workes <hi>of plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sure.</hi>
Workes of labour
the Scripture instanceth in
such, as are <hi>selling of victu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>als:
Nehem. 13. 15. Carry<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
of burthens: Ierem. 17.
Iournying from our places,
Exod.</hi> 16. 29. The busi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse
of our callings done
by our selues, our chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren,
seruants, or cattell,
which the words of the
Commandement forbid.
And as workes of labour,
so also <hi>workes of pleasure</hi> are
forbidden, <hi>Esay</hi> 58. 13.</p>
            <p>2. <hi>Readinesse and delight.</hi>
               <pb n="198" facs="tcp:23076:124"/>
We should <hi>loue to be Gods
seruants</hi> on this day, <hi>Esay
56. and consecrate it with
ioy, as a glorious</hi> priuiledge
to vs, <hi>Esay</hi> 58. 13. abhor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring
wearinesse, or a desire
to haue the Sabbath gone,
and ended, <hi>Amos</hi> 8.</p>
            <p>3. <hi>Care and Watchful<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse.</hi>
We must <hi>obserue to
keepe it: Exod.</hi> 31. 16. we
must <hi>take heede to our selues,</hi>
that no duty bee omitted,
and that wee no way pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phane
it, tending our
hearts, and our words, <hi>Ier.</hi>
17. 21.</p>
            <p>4. <hi>Sinceritie,</hi> and this
sinceritie we should shew
diuers waies.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="199" facs="tcp:23076:124"/>First, by doing Gods
worke with as much care,
as we would doe our own,
or rather shewing more
care for the seruice of
GOD. They had their
double sacrifices on the
Sabbath, in the time of
the Law, and wee should
studie, how wee might
please GOD in especiall
manner on that day, choo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sing
out the things that
might delight him: God
hath taken but one day of
seuen for his worke; and
shall wee not doe it wil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lingly?
Further, if wee
respect our selues, shall we
not bee as carefull to pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uide
<pb n="200" facs="tcp:23076:125"/>
for our soules on the
Sabbath, as for our bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dies
on the weeke daies?</p>
            <p>2. <hi>By obseruing the whole
day,</hi> as well as a part, and
keeping the Sabbath <hi>in
our dwellings,</hi> as well as in
Gods house: God requires
the whole day, and not a
part. As wee would not
be contented our seruants
should worke for vs onely
an houre, or two in the
six daies: so neither should
wee yeeld lesse vnto God,
then wee require for our
selues. Nor will it suffice
to serue God by publike
duties in his House, vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lesse
wee serue him also by
<pb n="201" facs="tcp:23076:125"/>
priuate duties in our own
dwellings, <hi>Commandement
4. Leuit.</hi> 23. 3.</p>
            <p>3. By auoiding the lesser
violations of the Sabbath,
as well as the greater, espe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cially
not transgressing of
contempt, or wilfulnesse
in the least things we know
to bee forbidden. The
Prophet instanceth: <hi>Isaiah
58. 13. Wee must not speake
our owne words.</hi> Thus of
sinceritie.</p>
            <p>5. The fift thing requi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red
of vs, is <hi>Faith:</hi> we must
glorifie GOD by belee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uing,
that hee will make
it a day of blessing vnto
vs, and performe that bles<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sing
<pb n="202" facs="tcp:23076:126"/>
hee hath promised,
accepting our desire to
walke before him in the
vprightnesse of our hearts,
and passing by our infir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mities,
and fraileties. We
many times disturbe the
rest and Sabbath of our
soules by vnbeliefe, <hi>Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mandement
4. Genes. 2. 2.
Exod. 31. 13. Ezech.</hi> 20. 20.
&amp; 46. 2, 5.</p>
            <p>6. The last thing is <hi>De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>precation:</hi>
wee must be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>seech
God, when we haue
done our best, to shew vs
mercie, and spare vs for
our defects and weake<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesses.
Thus wee must
end the day, and recon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cile
<pb n="203" facs="tcp:23076:126"/>
our selues to GOD,
that the Rest of Iesus
Christ may be established
in our hearts, <hi>Nehem. 13.
22.</hi> And thus of the rules,
that binde vs to the good
behauiour, in respect of
the time of Gods worship.</p>

<pb n="204" facs="tcp:23076:127"/>
that should bring our

of men: And these rules
are of two sorts, for ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
they are such, as binde
vs to the good behauiour
<hi>towards all men,</hi>
               <note place="margin">1. Towards all men.</note> or such, as

to obserue <hi>in company,</hi> con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerne

<list>
                  <item>1. Religion, <hi>or</hi>
                  </item>
                  <item>2. <hi>The sinnes,</hi> and faults

               </list>
            </p>
            <p>1. For the first,<note place="margin">With due respect of Religion.</note> when
we come in company, wee
must be carefull to be that
which may become the
glory of Gods truth, and
the Religion we professe,
that wee take not <hi>vp the
name of God in vaine:</hi> And
thus we shall rightly order
our selues, if wee obserue
these Rules:</p>
            <p>First, to be soundly ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uised,
<pb n="206" facs="tcp:23076:128"/>
before wee fall into
discourse of Religion, not
doing it, till God may bee
glorified by it; <hi>A wise man
concealeth knowledge, but
the heart of fooles will pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lish
foolishnesse:</hi> It is as
great a discretion to know
how to conceale know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge,
as it is to know how
to vse knowledge.</p>
            <p>Secondly, auoide <hi>vaine
ianglings,<note place="margin">Auoiding vaine ian<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>glings in 3. things.</note> and contradicti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
of words,</hi> such as are</p>
            <p>1. <hi>Doubtfull disputations</hi>
about Ceremonies, and
things indifferent, which
<hi>may entangle the weake,</hi> and
keep them from more ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cessarie
cares and know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge,
<pb n="207" facs="tcp:23076:128"/>
               <hi>Rom.</hi> 14. 1.</p>
            <p>2. <hi>Curious Questions,</hi> a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout
things that are not re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uealed
in the VVord, <hi>Rom.
12. 3. Bee wise to sobriety.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>3. <hi>Vnprofitable reasonings,</hi>
such as were those about
<hi>Genealogies,</hi> in the Apos<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tles
time, 1. <hi>Tim.</hi> 1.</p>
            <p>Thirdly, If thou be as<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ked
a reason of the hope
that is in thee, by such as
haue authority to require
it, or need to seeke it, then
answer: But be sure to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>member
two things; name<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly,
that thou answer <hi>with
all reuerence,</hi> as may shew
how much thou art affec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted
with the Maiestie of
<pb n="208" facs="tcp:23076:129"/>
Gods truth, and withall
<hi>with meeknesse,</hi> that is,
without passion or fro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wardnesse:
and without
affectation, or conceited<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse,
or wilfulnes in thine
owne opinions, 1. <hi>Pet.</hi> 3. 15.</p>
            <p>Fourthly, let thy <hi>commu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nication
be yea, yea, and nay,
nay:</hi> otherwise, customary
and vaine swearing, is a
most damned sinne, and
such as God will surely
plague.</p>

            <p>THus of our carriage
in company in respect
of Religion.<note place="margin">How wee must be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>haue our selues in company concer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning the faults of others.</note> Now con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerning
the faultes of o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers,
wee must obserue
these Rules:</p>
            <p>First, wee must neuer in
our discourse <hi>iustifie the
wicked, or condemn the righ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teous;</hi>
all excesse in words
is euill, but this is <hi>an abo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mination
to the Lord:</hi> We
must euer <hi>honour those that
<pb n="210" facs="tcp:23076:130"/>
feare the Lord,</hi> and as for
<hi>vile persons, they are to bee
contemned, Psal. 15. 4. Amos
5. 15. Prou<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
               </hi> 17. 15.</p>
            <p>Secondly, let thy con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uersation
and discourse be
<hi>without iudging, Math. 7. 1.
lam.</hi> 3. 17. It is time excee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding
ill-spent, that is spent
in censuring of others.
And the rather should we
take heed of iudging, if
we consider how the holy
Ghost hath matched that
sin in that place of <hi>Iames,</hi>
wee must bee <hi>without iudg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing,
without hypocrisie:</hi> as if
he wold signifie, that great
Censurers are commonly
great Hypocrites; and as
<pb n="211" facs="tcp:23076:130"/>
any are more wise, they
are more sparing of their
Censures.</p>
            <p>Thirdly, thou must not
<hi>walke about with tales;</hi> take
heed of Tale-bearing: <hi>He
goeth about as a slanderer,
that reuealeth a secret,</hi>
though it be true hee spea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>keth.
It is a maruellous e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uill
custome, that many
haue to fill vp their dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>course
with the report of
the frailties of others,
which they by some
meanes or other, come
vnder-hand to know: This
is an euill frequently con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demned
in Scripture, and
yet most vsually practised;
<pb n="212" facs="tcp:23076:131"/>
as if it were lawfull to
speake of any thing which
they know to be true: <hi>Thou
shalt not walke about with
Tales, nor stand against the
bloud of thy neighbour:</hi> A
strange connexion, by
which the Lord imports,
that this Tale-bearing is a
kind of murther; and it is
true in the case of many a
man; thou wert as good
lay violent hands vpon
him, as with that licenti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ousnesse
of words to di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uulge
tales concerning
him, <hi>Prou.</hi> 20. 19. &amp; 11. 13.
<hi>Leuit.</hi> 19. 16. And for the
better strengthening of
this rule, thou art yet char<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ged
<pb n="213" facs="tcp:23076:131"/>
to looke to thy eares
too, as well as thy tongue;
Thou must <hi>not receiue euill
reports against thy neigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bour,</hi>
but make it appeare,
thou art not pleased with
such Tales, <hi>Psal.</hi> 15. 3.
Yea, thou art forbidden
the society of such per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sons,
as carry Tales; Thou
must not <hi>meddle with Tale<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bearers,
nor with such as
flatter with their lippes;</hi>
Certainely such creatures
commonly flatter the pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sent,
and reproach the ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sent,
<hi>Prou.</hi> 20. 19.</p>
            <p>Fourthly, if thou do
know an offence in any,
with whom thou conuer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sest,
<pb n="214" facs="tcp:23076:132"/>
               <hi>thou shalt not hate him
in thy heart,</hi>
               <note place="margin">Reproue, but hate not.</note> 
               <hi>but rather re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proue
him plainely:</hi> For,
<hi>he that rebuketh a man, shall
afterward finde more fauour
then hee that flattereth with
his tongue, Leu. 19. 17. Prou.</hi>
28. 23.</p>
            <p>Fifthly,<note place="margin">Passe by meere frailties.</note> as for the meere
frailtie of others, hold thy
tongue, passe by them: <hi>A
foole despiseth his neighbour,
but a man of vnderstanding
will hold his peace, Prou.</hi> 11.
12. Commonly they that
haue most defects them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selues,
are aprest to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>temne
others for their
weakenesses: but a wise
man must so distinguish of
<pb n="215" facs="tcp:23076:132"/>
the faults of others, that
hee couer meere frailties,
and learne of God to passe
by the infirmities of his
seruants: The Antithesis
shewes, that a wise man
doth not' onely hold his
tongue, but restraine his
thoughts from thinking
the worse of others for
such infirmities.</p>
            <p>Sixthly, against the pas<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sions
&amp; wrongs of others
thou must arme thy selfe
with a <hi>soft answer,</hi> and bee
sure <hi>thou render not euill for
euill, Prou. 15. 1. 1. Thess.</hi> 5.
15. or rebuke for rebuke,
1. <hi>Pet.</hi> 3. 9.</p>

these Rules:</p>
            <p>1. First, <hi>bee soft, shew all
meekenesse to all men,</hi> re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>straining
the inordination
of thy heart, endeuouring
to shew thy selfe <hi>gentle,</hi>
and <hi>peaceable,</hi> and <hi>harme<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lesse,</hi>
               <pb n="218" facs="tcp:23076:134"/>
and <hi>easie to be entrea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted,
Tit. 3. 1, 2. Prou. 8. 13.
Iam.</hi> 3. 13.</p>
            <p>2. Secondly, thou must
<hi>bow downe thine eare, and
heare the words of the wise,</hi>
and apply thine heart to
get knowledge, and profit
thy selfe by others, <hi>Pro.</hi> 23.
17. This is the same with
that of <hi>Iames, Bee swift to
heare, and slow to speak, I am.</hi>
3. 19.</p>
            <p>3. Thirdly, put not forth
thy selfe, nor stand in the
place of great men, till
thou bee called, <hi>Prou.</hi> 25. 6.</p>
            <p>In generall, concerning
humility, the Apostle <hi>Pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters</hi>
phrase is much to bee
<pb n="219" facs="tcp:23076:134"/>
noted, hee saith, we should
<hi>cloath our selues with humi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lity:</hi>
which notes both the
great measure of it, it
should couer all our acti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons,
and also the continu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance
of it: When wee go
amongst men, wee should
stirre vp our hearts, and
fashion our selues to ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>presse
this grace, and not
dare to bee seene without
humility, no more then
we would bee seene with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out
our cloathes. Humi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lity
hides our nakednesse,
and pride and passion lay
it open to the view and
contempt of others.</p>
            <p>2. Secondly, neither is
<pb n="220" facs="tcp:23076:135"/>
humility all that is requi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red
to make our conuersa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
without offence,<note place="margin">Eight rules that concerne discretion in our be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hauiour.</note> or
prouocation; but we must
also carry our selues dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cretely,
and to this end
there are these excellent
Rules:</p>
            <p>First, thou must consi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der
<hi>to speake what is accep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>table,</hi>
and auoide what
may irritate; there is sin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gular
vse of this rule, if it
were followed, <hi>Prou.</hi> 10. 32,
13. &amp; 13. 23.</p>
            <p>Secondly, thou must
<hi>marke those that cause diui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sion
and offences, and auoide
them,</hi> and shunne the soci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>etie
of such, <hi>Rom.</hi> 16. 17, 18.
<pb n="221" facs="tcp:23076:135"/>
This will breed thee much
peace, and deliuer thee
from much suspition in o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers.</p>
            <p>Thirdly, thou <hi>must make
no friendship with the an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gry
man;</hi> for either by
much conuersing with
him, thou maist learne his
waies, or else it will bee a
snare to thee, that thou
shalt neither know how to
keep his fauour, nor yet
how to breake off from
him, without much vnrest
and inconueniences, <hi>Prou.</hi>
22. 24, 25.</p>
            <p>Fourthly, it is a great
discretion <hi>in euill time to
be silent.</hi> In things where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in
<pb n="222" facs="tcp:23076:136"/>
thou maist indanger thy
selfe, and not profite o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers,
it is thy best way, and
a wise course, to forbeare
speech of such things, <hi>A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mos</hi>
5. 13.</p>
            <p>Fifthly, so likewise it is
thy discretion in matters
of danger to <hi>forbeare the
communioating of thy se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crets
to any,</hi> though thou
mightst bee tempted to a
perswasion of trust in
those, to whom thou
wouldst reueale them: It
may often repent thee to
haue spoken, but seldome
to haue held thy peace,
<hi>Micah</hi> 7. 5.</p>
            <p>Sixthly, <hi>with-draw thy
<pb n="223" facs="tcp:23076:136"/>
feete from thy neighbours
house, left hee bee weary of
thee and hate thee:</hi> This is
an excellent rule giuen by
<hi>Salomon, Pro.</hi> 25. 17. If thou
wouldest conuerse with re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>putation,
take heed of idle
gadding from house to
house, when thou hast no
occasion or employment:
Thou maist draw hereby
much secret contempt, and
loathing of thee, when thy
emptinesse and vanity shal
be thereby discouered. An
empty conuersation, that
hath in it no exercise of pi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ety
or vertue, if it be fre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quent,
occasioneth secret,
and vnutterable scorne.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="224" facs="tcp:23076:137"/>7. <hi>Restraine thine owne
passions</hi> in conuersing.
There are none so wise,
but if they shew their pas<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sions
of immoderate an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger,
feare, griefe; yea, or
ioy, but they discouer
much weakenesses in their
disposition, which would
bee couered if thou didst
bridle the excesse of thy
passions. <hi>A wise man coue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reth
shame, when a foole is
presently knowne:</hi> It is the
best praise not to haue
such weakenesses; but the
next to this, is by discretio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
to bridle our selues, so as
wee may hide our weake<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesses
from breaking out.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="225" facs="tcp:23076:137"/>Lastly, thou maist make
good vse of that directi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
of <hi>Salomon</hi> about thy
friend, <hi>Blesse not thy friend
with a loud voyee, rising ear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
in the morning; for it
may bee accounted a curse to
thee:</hi> Take heed of flatte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry,
which in stead of effec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting
thine owne ends, may
bring thee out of all re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>spect.
Hee doth not for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bid
the iust praise, and en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>couragement
of friends,
but the intending of praise
of purpose to the vtter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>most
notice of thy friend
(this is to praise him with
a loud voice) and the af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fectation
of preuenting o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers
<pb n="226" facs="tcp:23076:138"/>
in praising; and of
doing it in such things as
are not yet sufficiently
knowne to bee praise-wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thy,
and to set ones
selfe so to praise, as if hee
studied to do nothing else,
but humour his friends, es<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pecially
if it bee but once
perceiued, that thou dost
it but for thy owne ends.
It is a great part of wise<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom,
to know how to speak
of the praise of others, so
as neither sinister ends bee
intended, nor the humo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring
of those we praise: to
doe it sparingly and seaso<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nably,
is a great discretion.</p>
            <p>And thus of the Rules,
<pb n="227" facs="tcp:23076:138"/>
that make our conuersati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
amiable, in respect of
discretion.</p>
            <p>3. Thirdly,<note place="margin">Three Rules that concerne the purity of our co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
                  <g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uersation.</note> that our con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uersation
may not be hurt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full
and offensiue, we must
looke to the <hi>purity</hi> of it,
and so these Rules follow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
are of singular vse:</p>
            <p>First, in generall, <hi>Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fraine
thy tongue from e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uill,
and thy lippes that they
speake not guile, Psal.</hi> 34.
13. For <hi>hee that keepeth his
mouth, keepeth his soule, Pro.</hi>
22. 23. Take heed of the
vsuall vices of the tongue:
for <hi>thereout may come much
mischiefe,</hi> and discontent
to thy selfe and others.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="228" facs="tcp:23076:139"/>Secondly, in particular
looke to thy selfe careful<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly,
that thou auoide those
three euils mentioned by
the Apostle: <hi>Ephes. 3. 4.
viz. Filthy speaking, Foo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lish
talking and iesting.</hi> By
iesting hee meanes those
biting iests, that vnder pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tence
of shewing witti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse,
or conceit, doe se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cretly
leaue disgrace vpon
the persons whom they
concerne.</p>

As</p>

without exalting our

they stand in neede

14. 21.</p>
            <p>Thirdly, in <hi>accepting ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hortation,</hi>
shewing our
selues willing to be called
vpon, and stirred vp to
mercie, 2. <hi>Cor.</hi> 8. 17.</p>
            <p>4. By our <hi>penitencie,</hi> whe<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
we goe to God, after wee

confesse the corruption
that cleaues vnto vs, euen
when we haue shewed our

striuing to <hi>plow vp the fal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low
ground of our</hi> hard <hi>harts,</hi>
that they may bee more fit
to expresse the <hi>bowels of
mercy,</hi> Hos. 10. 12.</p>
            <p>Fiftly, the <hi>Macedonians</hi>
shewed their humilitie in
this, that <hi>they prayed the A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>postle
to accept their gifts, gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uing
themselues also to bee
disposed of to the Lord, and
vnto them by the vvill of
God,</hi> 2. Cor. 8. 5.</p>
            <p>Thus of the humility
to bee shewed in doing
workes of mercy.</p>
            <p>A fift thing required in
shewing mercie,<note place="margin">5. Faith in two re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>spects.</note> is <hi>Faith;</hi>
and faith is needfull in two
respects.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="238" facs="tcp:23076:144"/>First, to beleeue Gods
acceptation of the mercy
shewed. For a godly Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stian,
that is not vaine-glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rious,
hath so meane an o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pinion
of his best workes,
that he findes neede to flie
to Gods promises, and
dares not trust vpon his
owne goodnes. Now God
hath promised to accept
of that we doe, if there <hi>be
a willing minde: The will is
accepted for the deed,</hi> 2. Cor.
8. 12.</p>
            <p>Secondly, to <hi>beleeue the
successe</hi> and reward from
God, and that wee shall
not lose, by what is so expe<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
               <g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded.
Though the persons
<pb n="239" facs="tcp:23076:144"/>
to whom we shew mercy,
should bee so vngratefull,
that it were <hi>as bread cast on
the waters:</hi> yet wee ought
to beleeue, that our seede
cast on the waters, shall
bring vs a plentifull har<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uest,
<hi>Eccles.</hi> 11. 1. And it is
certaine, whatsoeuer the
persons be, yet what is gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uen,
is sowed. And if the
Husbandman doe not
thinke his come spoiled,
that he casts vpon his land,
no more ought a Christi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>an
to think that to be lost,
that is giuen to the poore.
Nature may disappoint
the hope of the Husband<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man,
but in works of mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cie,
<pb n="240" facs="tcp:23076:145"/>
there is no venture, but
a sure increase from the
Lord, 2. <hi>Cor.</hi> 9. 9, 10. and
therefore our faith should
make vs <hi>get bags</hi> to put vp
the certaine treasure wee
shall gaine by mercy from
the Lord, <hi>Luke</hi> 12. 33.</p>
            <p>A sixt thing required in
shewing mercie,<note place="margin">6. Discre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion in four<gap reason="illegible" resp="#OXF" extent="1 letter">

                  </gap> things.</note> is <hi>discreti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on,</hi>
and discretion should
shew it selfe</p>
            <p>First, by distributing
our almes in the fittest
course wee can, hauing a
principall respect <hi>to godly
poore. He that sheweth mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy,
ought to haue a good eye,</hi>
Prou. 22. 9.</p>
            <p>Secondly, by obseruing
<pb n="241" facs="tcp:23076:145"/>
our owne abilitie, <hi>so to ease
others, that we burthen not
our selues,</hi> 1. Cor. 9. 14, 15.</p>
            <p>Thirdly, by taking heed
that wee spend not vpon
the rich by needlesse en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tertainments,
what ought
to bee bestowed vpon the
poore, <hi>Prou. 22. 16. Luke</hi>
14. 13.</p>
            <p>Fourthly, by auoiding
scandal, or giuing offence,
<hi>that none blame vs in our a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>boundance,
but prouiding
things honest in the sight of
God and men,</hi> 2. Cor. 8. 20,
21. yet so as wee indeuour
in an holy &amp; discreet man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner
<hi>to prouoke others by our
zeale,</hi> 2. Cor. 9. 2.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="242" facs="tcp:23076:146"/>A seuenth thing requi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red
in shewing mercy, is
<hi>Sympathy,</hi>
               <note place="margin">7. Sympathy.</note> Pitie, a Fellow-feeling
of the distresses of
others, <hi>being like affectioned</hi>
and laying their miseries
to heart, <hi>Heb. 13. 3. Col. 3.
12. Rom. 12. 16. Iob</hi> 30. 25.
There should be <hi>bowels in
our mercy.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>The last thing is <hi>Sinceri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie.</hi>
               <note place="margin">8. Sinceri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie in fiue things.</note>
Now this sinceritie
should bee shewed diuers
waies, As:</p>
            <p>1. In the <hi>matter of our
almes.</hi> It must be of goods
well gotten. For <hi>God ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teth
robbery,</hi> though it were
<hi>for burnt offerings,</hi> Esay
61. 8.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="243" facs="tcp:23076:146"/>2. <hi>In the maner</hi> we must
shew mercy, without wic<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ked
thoughts, or griefe of
heart, <hi>Deut.</hi> 7. 7, 8. to 12.
and <hi>without hiding our selues
from the poore,</hi> Esay 58. 7.
and without excuse to shift
off the doing of it, <hi>Prou.</hi>
24. 11, 12.</p>
            <p>3. <hi>In the ends.</hi> That we
doe not our workes <hi>to bee
seene of men, or to merit</hi> of
God: but with an vnfained
desire <hi>to glorifie God,</hi> and
make our profession to be
well spoken of, and shew
the true loue and pitie wee
beare to the creature in
distresse, <hi>Math. 6. 2. Cor.</hi>
9. 19.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="244" facs="tcp:23076:147"/>4. In continuing our
mercy; <hi>not forgetting to di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stribute,</hi>
but still <hi>remem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bring
the poore,</hi> Heb. 13. 16.
Galat. 2. soundly perfor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ming
the mercy with con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stancie,
which wee haue
purposed, willed, or pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mised.
It were an excel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lent
order, if Christians
would follow the Apostles
rule, <hi>euery weeke, as God
hath prospered them, to lay
aside for the poore,</hi> 1. Cor. 1.
16. 2. 2. Cor. 8. 11.</p>
            <p>5. In the <hi>kindes of mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cie,</hi>
that wee bee ready to
shew <hi>spirituall mercy,</hi> as wel
as <hi>corporall,</hi> and in corpo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rall
mercy to doe good all
<pb n="245" facs="tcp:23076:147"/>
the waies we can, as well as
one way: As by <hi>lending,
protecting, releasing, visi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting,</hi>
and <hi>giuing;</hi> and thus
to <hi>the poore,</hi> to such as are

them, so as we may
bee so farre from giuing

how we should carry our

followeth to bee conside<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red
of:</p>
            <p>The summe of all is,
that wee must <hi>walke in loue:</hi>
If wee can soundly dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>charge

godly, in respect of louing
them vnfaignedly &amp; hear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tily,
and constantly, wee
performe all that is requi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red

And this loue to the god<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly

<hi>the manifestation of our loue
<pb n="262" facs="tcp:23076:156"/>
to them:</hi> or the <hi>preseruati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
of our loue to them.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Wee must shew our
loue to the godly diuers
waies:<note place="margin">Six waies of mani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>festing our loue to the godly.</note>
            </p>
            <p>First,<note place="margin">1. By cour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tesie.</note> by <hi>courtesie</hi> and
kindnesse towards them,
and that in a speciall man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner,
being affectioned to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward
them <hi>with a brotherly

brethren in nature should
shew more kindnesse one
to another, then Christi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans
should, <hi>Eph. 4. 33. Rom.</hi>
12. 10.</p>
            <p>Secondly,<note place="margin">2. By re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiuing them.</note> by <hi>receiuing</hi>
and entertaining them: we
must <hi>receiue one another,</hi>
and be <hi>harberous one to ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther;</hi>
               <pb n="263" facs="tcp:23076:156"/>
and this with intire<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse
of affection: Nega<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiuely,
it must bee <hi>without
grudging, 1. Pet.</hi> 4. 9. Affir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>matiuely,
we must receiue
one another, as <hi>Christ re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiued
vs into glory,</hi> that is:
First, <hi>without respect of de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sert;</hi>
Wee haue done no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing
to deserue heauen;
yet Christ hath receiued
vs to glory: so, though the
godly haue not pleasured
vs any way greatly, yet
because they are the chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren
of God, we should
make much of them, and
entertaine them gladly.
Secondly, <hi>not thinking any
thing too deare for them:</hi>
               <pb n="264" facs="tcp:23076:157"/>
Christ hath not enuied vs
the very glory of heauen,
and therefore what can we
doe to the brethren, that
should answer the exam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple
of Christ? <hi>Rom.</hi> 15. 7.</p>
            <p>Thirdly, by <hi>bearing their
burthens;</hi>
               <note place="margin">3. By bea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring their burthens.</note> for so we should
<hi>fulfill the Law of Christ,
Gal.</hi> 6. 2. There are two
sorts of <hi>burthens</hi> presse the
godly: <hi>One inward,</hi> such
as are temptations, and
their owne corruptions;
the other <hi>outward,</hi> such as
are afflictions of all sorts:
Now in both these, this
rule holds; for when wee
see a godly Christian
mourne and lament his
<pb n="265" facs="tcp:23076:157"/>
distresse in respect of his
infirmities or temptations,
wee must beare his bur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>then,
not by soothing him
in his sinne, as if it were
no sinne, but by laying his
griefe to our owne hearts,
and striuing to comfort
him with the promises of
God. This is not to make
our selues guilty of their
sinnes, or to beare with
their sinnes, but to helpe
them out of their griefe
by consolation, out of
their sinne by direction.
Note,<note place="margin">Note.</note> that this is charged
vpon vs, when sinne is a
burthen to them, not be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore;
for till then wee are
<pb n="266" facs="tcp:23076:158"/>
rather to reprooue them,
or admonish them: But
then we are to take notice
of this Rule, when they
confesse their sinnes, and
are weary of them, and
sorry for them: And thus
also in their outward bur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thens
we must beare them
by comforting them, and
aduising them, and hel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ping
them, and shewing
our affection to them, as if
it were our owne case, so
farre as we haue a calling,
and power to help them.</p>
            <p>Fourthly,<note place="margin">4. By pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uoking them to good du<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties.</note> by <hi>considering
one another, to prouoke un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to
loue, and good workes,
Heb</hi> 10. 24. Note the dutie
<pb n="267" facs="tcp:23076:158"/>
and the manner how it is
to be done: The duty is,
to stirre vp others all wee
can to the increase of
loue and aboundance of
all good workes: the man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner
is shewed two waies;
First, wee must <hi>prouoke
them</hi> to it, both by exam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple,
and by exhortation,
and all good waies, that
might fire in them the de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sire
of well-doing. Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>condly,
we must <hi>consider
one another,</hi> wee must stu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy
the estates of others,
their wants, impediments,
meanes, gifts, callings, &amp;c.
and accordingly apply our
selues for the best aduan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tage
<pb n="268" facs="tcp:23076:159"/>
to helpe them for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward.
It is not enough to
doe it occasionally, but
wee must meditate of it,
and cast about, how,
where, and when we must
yeeld this helpe, and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>couragement,
and furthe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rance.</p>
            <p>Fifthly,<note place="margin">5. By faith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fulnesse in all their businesse.</note> by <hi>doing what<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>soeuer
wee do for the godly,
heartily, and with all faith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fulnesse,</hi>
as if it were for
our selues, or our owne
brethren, or kinred in na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture,
not being <hi>slothfull
in seruice;</hi> or such as dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>appoint
the trust reposed
in vs: wee should doe all
things wee vndertake for.
<pb n="269" facs="tcp:23076:159"/>
them, with all fidelity and
care, 3. <hi>Ioh. 5. Rom.</hi> 12. 6, 7,
8, 11. Yea, we should care
for their good and profit,
as wee would care for the
good of the members of
our owne body: for such
are they to vs in the Mysti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>call
Body of Iesus Christ,
as the former place to the
Romanes sheweth.</p>
            <p>Lastly,<note place="margin">6. By im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ploying our gifts for their good.</note> we should shew
our loue to the godly, by
employing the gifts of our
minde, as may be best for
their good: <hi>As euery man
hath receiued the gift, hee
must so minister the same,
as good Stewards of the ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nifold
grace of God.</hi> There
<pb n="270" facs="tcp:23076:160"/>
are diuersity of gifts in the
godly, as knowledge, vtte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rance,
prayer, and the like<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
Now these are <hi>giuen to pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fite
withall, 1. Pet. 4. 10.
1. Cor.</hi> 12. As for example,
<hi>The lippes of the wise must
disperse knowledge, Pro.</hi> 15.
7. So when Christians
<hi>meete together,</hi> as any haue
receiued a Doctrine, or a
Psalme, or an Interpretati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on:
so must hee minister it
for the profite of others, 1.
<hi>Cor.</hi> 14. 26. and so must we
help one another by
prayer, either absent, or
present, 2. <hi>Cor.</hi> 1. 11.</p>

further diuers things to

things as wee must a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uoide.</p>
            <p>The things that we must

these.<note place="margin">What wee must do to preseru<gap reason="illegible" resp="#OXF" extent="1 letter">

                  </gap> our loue to the godly. Wee must labour to be of one iudgment with them</note>
            </p>
            <p>First, wee must striue <hi>to
be like minded</hi> in matters
of opinion; many discords
or abatements of affecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
grow among Christi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans
for their differences of
opinion in diuers things.
It is true, that difference
of <hi>Iudgement</hi> should not
cause difference in <hi>affecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on:</hi>
If wee cannot bee of
<hi>one minde,</hi> yet wee should
bee of <hi>one heart;</hi> yet wee
see the contrary, and
therefore euery Christian
should make conscience
of it, to bee so wary and
so humble in his opinions,
<pb n="273" facs="tcp:23076:161"/>
especially in things doubt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full,
or not so necessarie,
as to take heed of admit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting,
who might shew
dissent from the godly; or
if hee must needs dissent,
yet to bee very wary how
hee discouer it to the vex<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ation,
or entanglement of
others. Now because this
is very hard to perswade
Christians vnto, marke
how vehemently the Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stle
speakes of it, <hi>Rom. 15.
5, 6. Now the God of pati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence
and consolation grant
you to be like minded, that
yee may with one mouth and
one minde glorifie God.</hi> We
must learne of the Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stle
<pb n="274" facs="tcp:23076:162"/>
to pray <hi>feruently</hi> for
this, that our natures, and
the natures of others, with
whom wee conuerse, may
bee fitted hereunto: and
1. <hi>Cor.</hi> 1. 10. the Apostle
adiures them by <hi>the name
of Iesus: I beseech you, bre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thren,
by the name of our
Lord Iesus Christ, that yee
all speake the same thing,
and that there be no diuisi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons
amongst you, but that
yee bee perfectly ioyned to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether
in the same minde,
and in the same iudgement.</hi>
And in the Epistle to the
<hi>Philippians cha. 2. ver.</hi> 1, 2, 3.
Hee vrgeth them with
strange vehemency to im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>port
<pb n="275" facs="tcp:23076:162"/>
the necessitie of this
duty: <hi>If, saith he, there bee
any consolation in Christ, or
any fellowship of the Spirit,
or any bowels of mercy, bee
like minded, hauing the
same loue, being of one
minde.</hi> And certainely,
this earnestnesse in requi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring
this duety, imports,
that some peruerse Chris<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tians
will smoke one day,
for their presumption and
waywardnesse, and pride
of opinions.</p>
            <p>2. <hi>Wee must follow the
things,<note place="margin">2. We must follow peace.</note> which may make for
outward peace;</hi> and to this
end wee must labour to
shew <hi>all meeknesse</hi> in our
<pb n="276" facs="tcp:23076:163"/>
carriage, and <hi>long-suffering
in for-bearing one another,
and forgiuing one another,
Ephes.</hi> 4. 2, 3, 4.</p>

16. It doth exceedingly
preserue loue, if men,
when they haue offended,
<pb n="277" facs="tcp:23076:163"/>
or wronged others, would
quickly, and easily, and
heartily acknowledge their
offences: Nor doth this
rule hold in case of tres<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>passe
onely, but when we
haue not wronged others,
yet discreetly to com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plaine
of the corruption
of nature that cleaues to
vs, and the infirmities
which daily trouble vs:
This doth work not onely
compassion, but great in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crease
of affection in o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers
towards vs: For ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>knowledgement
preuents
their secret loathing of vs
for such frailties, if they
should discouer them.
<pb n="278" facs="tcp:23076:164"/>
And besides, it makes
them the willinger to giue
vs leaue to reproue their
faults, when they see wee
are as willing to reproue
our owne; Besides the
ease it brings to our owne
hearts many times to
make our moane to o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers,

most vnnaturall amongst

            <p>Fourthly, <hi>reioicing in

be holy and pure, if wee
would haue it preserued.
It must haue nothing in
it, that is vnseemely, nor
must it bee an affection,
that will take pleasure in

The meaning is not, that

and to this end wee must
looke to the leuitie of our

to make good, by conti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nuance,
the affection wee
haue conceiued and pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fessed
to others. Some
are of such vnconstant dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>positions,

            <p>Secondly, that thy sus<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pitions
transport thee
not to condemne thy

            <p>Ninthly, if there be any

direct vs in our carriage

            </p>
            <p>For the first, those that
are fallen, are either fallen
<hi>from God,</hi> or fallen <hi>from
thee.</hi> Such as are fallen
<hi>from God,</hi> are either fallen
<hi>grosely,</hi> and of habite, or
by <hi>infirmitie,</hi> and <hi>sud<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>denly.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <pb n="290" facs="tcp:23076:170"/>Those, that are fallen
grosely, are either guiltie
of <hi>foule vices,</hi> or else of
<hi>extreme omissions,</hi> such as
that, which the Apostle
instanceth in of <hi>Idlenesse,</hi>
and the generall neglect

<hi>lest they be
swallowed vp of griefe,
2. Cor.</hi> 7. 2, 8.</p>
            <p>Now if they bee fallen
by infirmitie, either they
are likely to offend again,
or not. If they bee likely
to fall further, <hi>saue them
with feare, pulling them
out of the fire, Iude</hi> 23. but
if not, then <hi>restore such a

            <p>First, in slighter wrongs
<hi>doe all things vvithout

Secondly, in great
wrongs, thou must doe
two things:</p>
            <p>First, obserue the me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thode
of our Sauiour
Christ: when the trespasse
<pb n="293" facs="tcp:23076:171"/>
is secret, goe and <hi>tell him
of it betweene thee and him:</hi>
If he mend not, then <hi>take
two or three</hi> other discreet
godly persons with thee,
and tell him of it againe:
if hee yet mend not, then
diuulge it, and acquaint
the Church with it: Ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
seeke a publike sen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tence
vpon him from au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thoritie,
or acquaint the
godly generally with it:
and if these courses will
not amend him, then a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bandon
his societie, as
if hee vvere a Heathen,

            <p>Secondly, if by any of
<pb n="294" facs="tcp:23076:172"/>
these courses <hi>hee repent,
forgiue him,</hi> yea, and that

in the things contai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned

are onely these two:</p>
            <p>First, thou must be expert
in <hi>the Catalogue of promises,
that concerne infirmities,</hi>
mentioned in the third

thy faith in Gods fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uour,
against the daily ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perience
of frailetie, and
infirmitie in thy selfe. For
thou maist by them see,
that thou hast no reason to

of Gods loue to thee only,
because of thy many weak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesses.
For in those pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mises,
hee hath and doth
declare, how graciously he

oughtst to make confessi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
of thy sinnes, in stead
of a more generall confes<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sion,
vse still thy Cata<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>logue,
that is, labour euery
day to iudge thy selfe dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinctly
for those sins that
doe presently annoy thee:
Hold on this course con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stantly;
till thou haue got<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten
power against all, or
<pb n="305" facs="tcp:23076:177"/>
any of them, and as thou
findest vertue against any
of them, so alter thy Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>talogue,
giuing thankes
for the sinnes thou gettest
head against, and putting
them out of thy Cata<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>logue.
The paines is lit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle,
it is once done for a
long time, and thy memo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry
will easily carry thy spe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciall
present faults: Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sides,
this distinct daily re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>membrance
of thy present
sins, will make thee more
watchful against those sins;
&amp; thou maist once a year,
or once a quarter, or be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
euery Communion,
examine thy selfe anew,
<pb n="306" facs="tcp:23076:178"/>
and mend thy Catalogue,
by putting in any corrup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion,
which thou discoue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rest
then, or at any time,
to arise anew in thee, and
putting out such euils, as
by prayer thou hast gotten
victory against: Thus maist
thou see the state of thy
soule distinctly al the daies
of thy life, discerning when
thou goest forward or
backward: Besides, this
course of daily iudging
thy selfe, keeps thee out of
the danger of any wrath
from God.</p>

not in vs, <hi>Ephes. 1. 18, &amp;c.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Secondly, thou must

thy assurance of heauen,</hi>
when thou diest, <hi>Heb. 6. 12.
1. Pet.</hi> 1. 13.</p>
            <p>Thirdly, thou must striue

may be in heauen, Phil.</hi>

Calling there are seuen
<pb n="309" facs="tcp:23076:179"/>
things to be auoided.</p>
            <p>The first is <hi>slothfulnesse,</hi>
and thou art guiltie of this
sinne, both when thou dost
not the labours of thy cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling,

not the <hi>seasons,</hi> and
opportunities of thy Cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling,
<hi>Prou.</hi> 10. 4, 5. And that

of it: And so thou must
auoide 1. <hi>The loue of sleep,
Pro.</hi> 20. 13. 2. Good fellow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ship,
&amp; haunting of Ale-houses,
and Tauernes, and
keeping <hi>company with dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>solute
persons, Prou. 21. 17.
3. Wandring from thine

<hi>going from house to
house,</hi> though it bee not to
places of ill fame. Fourth<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly,
thou must take heed of
pertinacious entertaine<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
of doubts and ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iections
about thy Cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling,
thou shouldst bee a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fraid

thou art about thy calling,
<hi>what thou dost, do with all thy
power, Eccles.</hi> 9. 10. and rest
<pb n="311" facs="tcp:23076:180"/>
not in words or pratling:

hee can or will do, but hee

            <p>The second sin to bee
auoided in thy particular
calling,<note place="margin">2. Vnfaith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fulnesse.</note> is <hi>Vnfaithfulnesse,
Prou.</hi> 20. 6. and so thou
must take heed of <hi>breach of

with men, <hi>Psal.</hi> 15. 6. and
also thou must take heed
of all <hi>deceitfull courses,</hi> all
waies of fraud and couze<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nage.
It is a hatefull thing
in men, when they are such
as cannot be trusted, either
because they make not
<pb n="312" facs="tcp:23076:181"/>
conscience of keeping
their words, or because
they will vse so much cun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning

&amp; lying in their
dealings.</p>
            <p>The third sinne to bee
auoided,<note place="margin">3. Rash<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse.</note> is <hi>Praecipitation,</hi>
hastinesse, and vnaduised

and wise Diligence

            <p>The fourth sinne to bee

and that hath

thy selfe to be but
a <hi>stranger and Pilgrime</hi> in

<hi>if riches increase, thou must</hi>

not thy heart vpon them,
Psal. 62. 10. Thou must vse
the world,</hi> but not <hi>loue the

maist and oughtest to bee
carefull to do the duties of
thy Calling; but thou must
in <hi>nothing be carefull</hi> about

thy selfe in all things to
God, <hi>Math. 6. 1. Cor.</hi> 7. 32.
Thou must <hi>behaue thy selfe
