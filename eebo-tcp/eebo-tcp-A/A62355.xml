            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

To contract them into the narrow compass of an Epistle, is a diminution I dare not think of, since no Reader capable of this treatise can be ignorant of more then I could here tell him, should I extend it much beyond the ordinary limits: and Posterity can turn over no leaf in the English History (during our last twenty years transactions) wherein he will not find frequent mention of your Lord-ships name so involved in the principal affaires, that no alteration the Island can suffer (whil'st inhabited by men) can extinguish your memory. A change of language in our Nation by foreign Conquest or confusion like that of <hi>Babel,</hi> would for a short time obscure it; but retained by all other parts of the knowing world in their me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>morials of our stupendious changes, how soon will the next commerce bring it back again? and consecrate your name to the utmost ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tent of time. Amidst these considerations I make humble tender of all I can. The Itinerary of <hi>Italy,</hi> translated long after my return thence, in those vacant hours which I allowed to diversion, without farther intention then to renew that language by a re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>translation (which occasioned my so close keeping to the Italian

names and Idiome) and once more to travel that celebrate Countrey in this exact description, whither in my earlier years your Lord<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ship addressed me. Taking wing therefore from your Lordships Hand, and persuit from your direction, the Quarry (such as it is) ought to be your Lordships at the retrive; and though perhaps you will not esteem it fit to range in the first course of Books on your Lordships well furnished Table, yet it may deserve a share in the se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cond, affording a pleasant repast even to those, who require a more substantial meal. To advance that thought a little, and call it <hi>Man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>na</hi> (such in every mans mouth as he best liked) though proper e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nough to the Countrey where it abounds in great perfection, and agreeable to this work, where all appetites, all tasts, may be delight<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, would perhaps appear arrogance in me, who deliver it not pure from the tree (on which it falls) but as from an Apothecaries shop, where it may have received some taint. Yet those imper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fections your Lordship will pardon, and for your Lordships sake this Nation, (at least in some measure) because devoted to you up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on the score of publique gratitude as well as the particular obli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gation, of</p>

            <head>A PREFACE TO THE READER.</head>
            <p>
               <seg rend="decorInit">Y</seg>OU have here the Itinerary of <hi>Italy,</hi> a guide to all that tra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vel thither, a memorial after their return, a just entertain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment to the learned, &amp; a plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sing diversion to those who have not given themselves the trouble of un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>necessarie letters; whilst with easie Journies they pass through the most celebrate part of the habitable Earth, directed by this Treatise to the view or contemplation of all that is ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cellent in art, or nature. Such indeed is the sci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tuation of the Country, such the nature of the soile, such the antient manners of the people, as gave them a just Prerogative to the Empire of the world: proportioned to their dominion were their actions, the great examples of ensu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing ages in all that was imitable, their wonder
<pb facs="tcp:62973:4"/>
and amazement in what exceeds the hope of imitation. Of both you have a transitory ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count so interwoven with the general sur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vay, that it is scarce possible a volume of this size, can contain more, or more worthy re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>marques of persons, places, things, from the remotest of times to this instant. For beside the necessarie instruction in the number of miles, &amp; conveniences of passage from Town to Town, through every part that can recom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pence the trouble of a journey, you find a breif and yet a lively description of their several scituations, a repetition of their Historie, Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernment, capital Families, eminent persons, ruined Amphitheaters, Arches, Bathes, old Temples, later Churches, Palaces of both sorts with their various ornaments; what they have bin &amp; what they are, when, and by whom founded, ruined, or restored. Not any thing an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tient or modern, which a man upon the place ought to understand, seems omitted, nor is there any thing inserted to the unnecessary burthen of his memory: no Treatise in the Ita<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lian tongue was everso acceptable to strangers, none on this subject deserved so well from the natives. Whatever therefore the success be in the translation, you cannot but commend this Gentlemans choice, who after many years return from that pleasing journey, inten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded only a recollection of the language, and review of the Countrey, without any designe of making his papers publique, till assured by his friends they would in all hands meet a fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vourable
<pb facs="tcp:62973:4"/>
reception; since the early progress of our English youth, and short abode there, seldom gives them opportunity to arrive to any per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fection in that speech, till they are ready for de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parture, nor do many of them long retain it. Of those how few are there that prefer not discour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ses in their own? especially on a subject w<hi rend="sup">ch</hi>. ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mits no continued elegancie of stile, or contains any thing not easily reducible to another Idi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ome<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> Such as have traverst the History only, will find in every leaf a new delight by the brief recitals of the best Authors, enlightned with Chronologie, &amp; many doubtful passages reduc'd to certainty by the site and distance of the most memorable Cities, Fields, &amp; villages celebrate in Latin &amp; Italian stories. Those who are hitherto unacquainted with either, will here find enough to inform themselves, &amp; satisfie others, that they are not ignorant of any thing worth knowledge in that Country. Nay even to them who little regard the History or Geography, devotion wil render it acceptable, the most important cere<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monies of the Roman Church being briefly dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cours'd, and exposed to the different censures of those that read them with scorn or reverence. If there are any in the number of Readers who believe themselves unconcerned in all that is hitherto offred, there yet remains for them suf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficient entertainment, in the magnificent buil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dings, elegant Gardens, Statues, Embosments, Paintings of all sorts, and in every sort more ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cellent then all the other parts of <hi>Europe</hi> pretend unto. Hence did the barbarous <hi>Britains, Gauls,
<pb facs="tcp:62973:5"/>
Germans, &amp;c.</hi> derive their first civility, and hence in all succeeding ages received their best supply. Who in these nations less barbarous then their Ancestors, can think of that Country without re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vere<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ce? who can peevishly resolve to be ignorant of their story by refusing this Treatise? though I confess the Originals whence this Gentleman derives it, are not without manifold errors by the translation of Greek and Latin names into Italian, and extreme negligenee in the impressi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, so that the english version wants a double Apologie, whilst it oft-times follows those mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stakes, and is in the phrase far from the per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fection it had appear'd in, had our Translator in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tended it for publique view. Yet is there no real lapse in the main, &amp; every where intelligible: the faults of the press are as carefully corrected as the Printers imporunate hast will permit. And whatever imperfections the curious Readershall after these reasonable excuses discover, it is to be hoped he will gently pardon, or vouchsafe to the Book-seller somthing of his own more excellent then what he now recommends to the Nobility, Gentry, and Merchants of the Nation.</p>

It hath Walls round it, which are about the compass of a mile, and are washed by the River <hi>Ladice</hi> towards the North; Large and Fair Streets, paved with Flint-stones, and stately Houses. Its Churches are ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry beautiful, though not large. There is one most sumptuous, and Royal Palace, which was lately restored by <hi>Bernardo Clessio,</hi> Bishop of the said City. Towards the East part thereof enters a little River, upon which are raised many edi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fices, to work Silks in, as also to grind Corn; and from the said little River are brought many Rivolets, which run along the Streets, and into the Houses of the Citizens. Without the Gate called
<pb n="2" facs="tcp:62973:12"/>
Saint <hi>Lorenzo,</hi> upon the <hi>Ladice,</hi> there is a magnificent Bridge, of one hundred forty &amp; six paces in length (but of Wood) which conjoyns the <hi>Ladice</hi> with the other little River. The surrounding Mountains by, being continually covered with Snow, precipitous, and so high that the heads thereof seem to touch the heavens, are rendred in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>accessable. Between these Mountains, are two wayes, the one goes towards the North, the other towards <hi>Verona.</hi> It hath but little Champaign, or Fields, but those are pleasant and Rich, planted with Vines, and fruitful Trees, amidst which passeth the <hi>Ladice.</hi> In this place, may be seen the Castle, and Fort, called <hi>Pelen,</hi> appertaining to the most Noble Family of the <hi>Troppi.</hi> The Citizens speak good <hi>Dutch,</hi> and not ill <hi>Italian. Trent</hi> is now reduced under the power of <hi>Germans,</hi> and is a refuge for all <hi>Italians,</hi> when any disgrace happens to them in their own Countrey. They gather but little Corn, but, in lieu thereof, they have good quantity of delicious Wines, both White, and Red. In the Summer, the Air is good, but the Sun beats upon it most vehemently on those dayes it remaineth in the sign <hi>Leo;</hi> And in the Winter, 'tis so very cold, by reason of the Frosts and Snow, that there is no living; their Stoves are not sufficient to provide against it, because the cold is so fierce, that it turneth the Rain into Snow, before it can fall to the Earth; and that which occasions the greatest wonder here, is, that in that time their Wells, or deepest Pits, are void, and empty of Water. In stead of Mules, Asses, and Horses of Burthen, they serve themselves of their Oxen, and Cows, with Charrets so easie to carry goods, that they run up by the Moun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tains, as if it were in a Plain; though 'tis very true, that the wayes are so well helped by the Cliffs, or Craggs, that the Beasts may go a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny where with little labour.</p>
                  <p>This City was greatly illustrated, and enriched certain years past, by the General Council held here: for that there met then five Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sident Cardinals; Two Legats of the Council, for his Holiness, <hi>Pius</hi> the fourth, Chief Bishop, or Pope of <hi>Rome,</hi> being Cardinals also, that is to say, Cardinal <hi>Loreno,</hi> and Cardinal <hi>Madruccio;</hi> Three Patri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>archs, Thirty two Arch-bishops, Two hundred and thirty Bishops, Seven Abbots, Seven Generals of <hi>Religion,</hi> One hundred forty and six Doctors of Divinity, between Seculars, and Regulars; The Em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bassadour of <hi>Ferdinand</hi> the Emperour, as well in the name of the Em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pire, as of the Kingdoms of <hi>Hungary,</hi> and <hi>Bohemia;</hi> as also the Embas<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sadours of the King of <hi>France,</hi> of the King of <hi>Spain,</hi> of the King of <hi>Poland,</hi> and of <hi>Portugal,</hi> of the Dukes of <hi>Bavaria,</hi> of <hi>Savoy,</hi> of <hi>Venice,</hi> of <hi>Florence,</hi> and of the other Catholique Princes.</p>
                  <p>The Council was held in the Church of Saint <hi>Mary,</hi> where there is a very fair Organ. In the Church of Saint <hi>Peter</hi> are the Ashes of the blessed <hi>Simeon,</hi> Martyred by the wicked Jewes. In the Church of the Fryers <hi>Heremitans</hi> lies buried Cardinal <hi>Seripando<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
                     </hi> who was Le<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gate of the Council, a man famous for Holiness, and Doctrine. The Cannons are all illustrious persons, and have authority to choose the Bishop, Lord of the City, and Prince of the Empire, which dignity, three Cardinals of the most Noble Family of the <hi>Madrucci,</hi> have en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>joyed successively, of which one named <hi>Altiprando</hi> lives at present, a religious Person, and a lover of Learned men.</p>

Five Miles forth of <hi>Trent,</hi> is situated the rich, and populous Countrey of <hi>Perzene.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>At the Head of the Valley, near <hi>Primolano,</hi> are the confines be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween the <hi>Venetians,</hi> and <hi>Germans.</hi> Upon the high Mountain of <hi>Primolano</hi> is there built a most strong Bulwark of the <hi>Venetians</hi> called <hi>Strada,</hi> where a few Souldiers can repel the Dutch, when ever they offer by violence, or force, to advance forwards. At twelve miles distance from thence towards the East, among the <hi>Alps,</hi> is the City of <hi>Feltre,</hi> by the which way at the right-hand-shore of the River <hi>Brent,</hi> three miles distance from <hi>Scala,</hi> is seated <hi>Cavolo,</hi> a Fort of the <hi>Ger<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mans,</hi> inexpugnable, in respect that 'tis founded upon a great Rock directly hanging over the high-way, with a Fountain of living water in it, whereto neither Man, nor Goods can be mounted from the Earth, unless fastned to a Rope, and that wound up upon a wheel, from which (because 'tis a very narrow way underneath, between the Mountain and the River) with small labour, may their enemies be slain with Stones cast on them, as they march along. Thence five miles distant, is the River <hi>Cisimone</hi> (wch disembogues it self into the <hi>Brenta</hi>) where the Dutch and <hi>Feltrini,</hi> daily load great quantities of Timber and Wood, as well for the use of Building, as for firing, which they afterwards transport to <hi>Bassano,</hi> to <hi>Padoua,</hi> and to <hi>Venice.</hi> Seven miles distant from <hi>Bassano,</hi> on the Right-hand-shore of the <hi>Brent,</hi> lies the Countrey of <hi>Valstagna,</hi> placed at the foot of the Mountains, and famous for the Sawes there made: thence di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stant three miles, lies the Countrey of <hi>Campese,</hi> where in the Church of the Fryers of Saint <hi>Benedict</hi> lies buried he that wrote <hi>la Macha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ronea.</hi>

                        <hi>Bassano</hi> lies at the foot of this streight Valley, and is washed to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards the West by the <hi>Brent,</hi> called antiently <hi>Brenta,</hi> or <hi>Brentesia,</hi> the which hath its Sourse, or head, beyond the <hi>Alps</hi> of <hi>Trent</hi> twelve miles, near <hi>Levego.</hi> Over the <hi>Brent,</hi> a little forth of the Gate of <hi>Bassano,</hi> is built a great Bridge of Wood, which conjoyns both the Rivers. Between the <hi>Alps,</hi> and this Castle, there are some Hills, which pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duce most abundantly all things requisite, as well for necessary li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving, as delicacy, but most particularly, they abound with Olives, and precious Wines. The River <hi>Brenta</hi> runs thorow the Territory of <hi>Vicenza,</hi> passeth by the City of <hi>Padoua,</hi> and in the end dischargeth it self, by the Fenny, or Moorish grounds, into the Sea. In this River, they take excellent Fish, as <hi>Trouts, Pollard,</hi> or <hi>Chieven, Eyles, Pyke, Tench, Lampreys, Barbel,</hi> and <hi>Crabfish.</hi> In no place are the men more ingenuous in Merchandize than in this: particularly in weaving of Cloth, in turning most neatly in Ivory, and in Carving in Nut<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>Trees. There is never a year, that they dress less than fifteen thou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sand pound weight of Silk, and notwithstanding that, that which is made in <hi>China</hi> is esteemed better than is made in any other part of

the world, nevertheless 'tis known, that this of <hi>Bassano</hi> is more sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tile or thin, and more light. Hence the Family of the <hi>Carrareci</hi> drew their Original, and <hi>Eccellino</hi> the Tyrant, as also <hi>Lazaro,</hi> surnamed <hi>Bas<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sano,</hi> a person not meanly learned, nor less acquainted in the Greek tongue than in the Latine: he lived a long time in <hi>Bologna,</hi> with great satisfaction to the learned, afterwards he rendred himself at <hi>Padoua,</hi> to the end that he might illuminate those who were studious of good Letters. At present <hi>Giacomo dal Ponte,</hi> an excellent Lymner, greatly illustrates this Country, together with four of his Sons, cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led vulgarly, the <hi>Bassani.

Among others, there are some Figures Effigiated by Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mission of <hi>Gionachino Abbat</hi> of <hi>Santo Fiore</hi> (as is the common Fame) by which is presaged and demonstrated the great ruine which will fall upon the People of <hi>Italy,</hi> with other strange misfortunes: Where you beheld two Cocks, very boldly to carry away a Fox (wich signi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fies (as some will have it) that two <hi>French</hi> Kings should carry away, and force <hi>Lodovico Sforza</hi> out of the Seigniory of <hi>Milan.</hi> And also some Lyons Large and Fat appear as put in the Water, and some o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers set upon the shore very lean. Upon the Walls of the finest Marble, on the left hand, are two Tables of white Marble, some<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>what weaved with black, which at their joyning, represent a Man, so perfectly figured, that 'tis very wonderful to consider it. Where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of <hi>Albertus Magnus</hi> in a work called <hi>Meteora</hi> (as of a great rarity) makes mention. There are in this sumptuous Temple (reckoned amongst the chief of <hi>Europe,</hi> (though not so much for its vastness, as the design and pretious materials) thirty six Collumnes of the finest Marble, which are large two feet Diamiter. The Roof of it is di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vided into five Cupoloes covered with Lead. From the plain of this Place, to the very Top of the Temple, are the Fronts wrought up in <hi>Mosaicke</hi> work, with Figures in a Field of Gold, and certain lit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle Heads of Pillars, and Juttings out, or Eeves of Marble, upon which are set certain Images carved in Marble so perfectly, that they seem alive. There are also above this place on that part, which lies over the great Gate (whereof this Part hath five made of Brass)
<pb n="11" facs="tcp:62973:17"/>
four Horses very Antique of Brass guilt, of an exact Proportion, and extremely beautiful, which the <hi>Romans</hi> caused to be cast, to put them in the Triumfal Arch of <hi>Nero,</hi> when he Triumphed over the <hi>Parthians,</hi> and they being afterwards transported by <hi>Constantine</hi> to <hi>Constantinople;</hi> from thence (the <hi>Venetians</hi> being thereof become Lords) transported them to <hi>Venice,</hi> setting them upon the Temple of Saint <hi>Mark.</hi> In the Porch of the said Church, is seen a red square Marble Stone, upon which <hi>Alexander</hi> the third set his Foot upon the neck of <hi>Frederick</hi> the Emperour, whereon for that reason, are engra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven these words:
<q>Super Aspidem, &amp; Basiliscum ambulabis.</q>
                     </p>
                     <p>After which mounting to the Top of the Quire, by certain Steps of the finest Stones, you come to the place where the Singers stand on the Chief Feast dayes. There upon the great Alter, is the rich and fair Pixe framed of Gold and Silver, bedecked with many pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tious Stones, and Perl of an infinite price, which all persons admire that behold it. This Altar is covered over by one Arch, disposed into the form of a Cross, adorned with Marble, which the Antients called <hi>Tiberiano,</hi> supported with four Pillars of excellent Marble; wherein are carved the History of the Old and New Testaments. Behind this Altar, arise four Pillars of the purest <hi>Alablaster,</hi> five foot in length, transparent as Glass, placed there for Ornament of the Sacred and Holy Body of Jesus Christ consecrated or the Eucharist. In this Church are preserved with great devotion, many Reliques: and among others the Body of the Evangelist, this Republiques Protector Saint <hi>Mark,</hi> with his Gospel written by his own hand.</p>
                     <p>On the right hand of the Temple, in the midst thereof, is a large and high Gate, wrought all of Mosaique work, on the one side wher<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of stands the Effigies of Saint <hi>Dominick,</hi> and on the other that of Saint <hi>Francisco,</hi> which as 'tis reported, were made by order of the a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bove named <hi>Gionachino</hi> many years before the said Saints came into the world. Within this Gate is kept the most rich Treasure of Saint <hi>Mark</hi> so much spoken of; wherein are twelve pretious Crowns, with twelve Brest Plates, all compassed about with fine Gold, and garni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>shed with many Stones of great value. Among divers others, with <hi>Rubies, Emeralds, Topasses, Crisolits,</hi> and other pretious Stones, and Perls of numatchable bigness; Two Unicorns Horns of a great length, with a third somewhat less. Many very large Carbuncles, Vessels of Gold, Scollops of Agat, and Jasper Stones of a good bigness. One Huge Ruby given this State, by <hi>Domenico Grimani,</hi> a most worthy Cardinal. An Emerald hower-glass heretofore presented to this most illustrious Seigniory, by <hi>Uscassano</hi> King of <hi>Persia,</hi> with many o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther pretious things<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> Vessels, and Censores of Gold, and Silver. There also lies the Mitre or Bonnet (as we call it) with which every new Duke is Crowned. The which is traversed all over with the finest Gold, and pollish't, in whose wreathes, are many most pretious stones; and at the very Top, a Carbuncle of inestimable valew; I might also speak of the Candle-sticks, and Challices, with other things of such imminent valew, as may create wonder in the behol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders, but would take up too much time and room to describe them in this Abreviation.</p>

                        <pb n="12" facs="tcp:62973:18"/>Just opposite to this Temple, and distant from it about Eighty Paces, stands the high Steeple, which is 40. Foot square on all sides, and Two Hundred and Thirty high, with an Angel set upon the Top, which like a Weather-cock turning with the Wind to all corners where it blowes, ever hath the Face towards it. All the said Top or upper part thereof, is richly guilt, which presents it to the Eye of such as addresse to <hi>Venice,</hi> (by reason of the reflection of the hot Sun thereon) <hi>Lucidely</hi> shining at a great distance; In the founda<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of this Steeple was more expended (as <hi>Sabellico</hi> declares) than in all the other structure. They ascend to the uppermost part of this Steeple, by certain little winding steps within, where a most excel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lent Prospect discovers it self: as first, the City of <hi>Venice,</hi> divided into six Precincts, consisting of many little Islands, whose Bankes are conjoyned with Bridges, the Streets, the open Places, the Churches, the Monasteries, and other sumptuous structures; More<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>over, the small Islands seated round about the City to the number of sixty, with their Monasteries, Churches, Pallaces, and most beauti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful Gardens; Upon some of which Islands, are erected many Col<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lumnes, by the <hi>Aquleiesi,</hi> the <hi>Vicentini,</hi> the <hi>Opitergini, Concordiesi, Altinati,</hi> and several other People, who to fly the Fury of <hi>Attila,</hi> King of the <hi>Hunnes,</hi> recovered this Place; gives no small Imbellish<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment to this View. Between the said Moorish Grounds, now the Streets and the Sea, by Dame Nature is raised a Fence or Bank, to defend the City &amp; the small Islands, against the furious Waves of the Sea, (with which 'tis invironed) Which Fence is Thirty five Miles long, and bends in the shape of a Bow, opening it self in five seve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral Places, for each of which is a Gate, as well to permit Barkes to enter in at them, as to maintain the said Channels full of Water. The profound Havens of <hi>Chioza,</hi> and <hi>Malamocco,</hi> with the Forts built at the Mouth of the said Havens, to keep any Armado or Fleet at a distance; And lastly, the beholding the Mountaines of <hi>Carnia,</hi> and of <hi>Histria,</hi> and on the Right Hand, the <hi>Apenine</hi> Hills, with <hi>Lumbardy,</hi> together with the Famous Hills called <hi>Euganei,</hi> with the mouthes of the Rivers <hi>Adice,</hi> and <hi>Poe,</hi> and behind them the Alpes of <hi>Baviera,</hi> and of the <hi>Gerisons,</hi> alwaies covered with Snow, gives no small satisfaction, nor beauty to his Prospect.</p>
                     <p>And now we come to the Famous <hi>Piazza,</hi> or broad place of S. <hi>Mark,</hi> whose platform resembles a Carpenters square, at the one end where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of stands the Admirable Church of St. <hi>Mark,</hi> and at the other, That of St. <hi>Geminian,</hi> wrought with excellent Stones, and round the said Place are built fair and sumptuous Houses all of Marble Stone, un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der which are large open Galleries, wherein are Shops for several Artificors.

from <hi>Greece</hi> to <hi>Venice,</hi> in the time of <hi>Sebastian Ciani</hi> the Duke, upon, certain Vessels of burden, together with another of equal Greatness, the which overcomming the Power and Industry of the Workmen labouring to lay it on the Earth, it fell into the Water, where at this time tis to be seen in the Deep: These vast Columns, were reared by an Engineer of <hi>Lombardy</hi> named <hi>Nicolo Berreterro,</hi> by the strength of great Ropes wet with water, retiring by little and little; who as<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ked no other reward for this his worke, but that it might be Lawful for Dice-Players to play there when they pleased without any penal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty: This <hi>Piazza</hi> is not intirely one alone, but fower united together. Opposite to the Church are reared three Standards upon three high pieces of Timber which are fastened by Lead cast into the boa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red holes, they are wrought with figures to denote the liberty of this City, and have Brass Pedestalls. On the right side of the Church stands the Clock house adorned with the Celestial Signs gilt there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, with the Sun and Moons monethly ingress into them, most exact<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly wrought and painted. Neer the Steeple is a sumptuous Palace built in this Age, after the <hi>Ionick</hi> and <hi>Dorick</hi> fashion, which rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ches even to the Church of Sain <hi>Geminian,</hi> which for the excellen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy of the Marble, Statues, Casements, Cornishes, Frets and other ornaments, together with the most incomparable Architecture, gives not place to any palace of <hi>Italy.</hi> Next is the <hi>Zecca</hi> or <hi>Mint-house</hi> built all of flint Stone, and Iron Barrs, without any manner of Tim<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber. Annexed thereunto Stands the Library, which had its Origi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal from <hi>Petrarca,</hi> and was afterwards aggrandized by the Cardinals <hi>Niceno, Alexandro,</hi> and <hi>Grimano.</hi> Lastly, this <hi>Piazza</hi> is rendred so Proud and marvellous, by the Uniformity of Building, and o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther Imbellishments, that I cannot say all <hi>Europe</hi> affords its like.</p>
                     <p>The Island <hi>Muran,</hi> must next be visited by taking <hi>Gondola,</hi> or <hi>Boat,</hi>
                        <note place="margin">Muran.</note> which for its Furnaces of Glass is much admired through the World. This Island is distant from <hi>Venice</hi> about a Mile, and was begun to be inhabited by the <hi>Altinati,</hi> and <hi>Opitergini,</hi> for fear of the <hi>Hunnes.</hi> At present 'tis very comely, and resembling <hi>Venice,</hi> as well in the stru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctures, as in the Quantity of Churches, but much more pleasant and delightful, in respect most of the Houses have open and spaci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous Gardens, set with all sorts of fruitful Trees. Among others, is the Church of Saint <hi>Peter,</hi> with a Monastery belonging to the preach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing Fryers, well built, wherein is a famous Library full of good Books.</p>
                     <p>In this Place they make all sorts of Vessels of Glass (called Crystal Glass) whose variety &amp; Workmanship surpass all others of the same materials of the whole world. And the Artizans (except in excellency of the materials) every day find out new Inventions to make them appear more desirable, with works divers from one another. I will not speak of the variety of colours which they give thereunto, because 'tis so marvellous that I imagine it worthy all Peoples sight. They counterfet excellently several things of <hi>Agate, Calcidonian, Emerald,</hi> and <hi>Hyacinths,</hi> with other pretty Toyes so excellently, that I believe were <hi>Pliny</hi> to be revived, and should behold them, he would (ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miring them) much more praise these mens workmanship, and these artificial things, than he does the vessels of Earth made and burned by the People of <hi>Aretini,</hi> or of any other Nation.</p>

In which is beheld most curious Marble, both in the Pavements, and in the Statues, with rich workmanship of Sil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver, and most sumptuous Sepulchres of Princes. The Fryers of Saint <hi>Benedict</hi> have here a noble Monastery, wherein are long open Galle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries, spacious Courts, ample eating-Rooms, and sleeping-Chambers, as also most pleasant Gardens, with a worthy Library.</p>
                     <p>In <hi>Venice</hi> are seventeen Rich Hospitals, with a great number of wealthy Churches, adorned with the exactest marble Stone; consisting of sixty seven Parish-Churches fifty fower Convents of Fryers, twenty six Monasteries of Nunns, eighteen Chapels, six Schools, kept within the Principal Fryeries or Monasteries. In all which Churches are fifty bodies of Saints, one hundred forty and three Organs, &amp; many Statues made at the cost of the Republick, in remembrance of illustrious Persons, which have valiantly fought for her, or done some other signal piece of service, that is to say, 165 of Marble, and 23 of Brass, among which most worthily pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sents it self, That proud Statue on Horseback wrought with Gold, of <hi>Bartolomeo Coglione</hi> the most famous Captain-General of the Ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>netian Army, dedicated to him by this Republiek, before the Church of Saint <hi>John</hi> and <hi>Paul,</hi> in testimony of his Fidelity, and Va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lour.</p>
                     <p>Moreover, there are fifty six Tribunals, and ten Gates of Brass. The Store-House of the <hi>Germans,</hi> which is five hundred and 12 foot in circumference, whose Front outwards hath many excellent Fi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gures, and inwards two Galleries which go quite round the one a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bove the other, wherein are two hundred Lodging Chambers. There stand also up and down this City, besides what are above mention<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, infinite more Statues, Pictures, and glorious Tombes. At all seasons it abounds plentifully with fruits and herbs of all sorts, and two hundred several sorts of Fish: furthermore there are four<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hundred and fifty bridges of Stone, fourscore thousand Gonda<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>loes or Boats, with twice as many Gondaloers or Watermen, with a vast number of Chanels, among the which the Principal is called the Grand Canale, or Chanel, one hundred and thirty paces in length, and forty in bredth, over which is built that most artificial Bridge, called the <hi>Rioalto,</hi> being one Arch which conjoynes both the Banks, to be accounted for its heighth, length, and bredth, amongst the most glorious fabricks of <hi>Europe;</hi> whereon are erected twenty four shops covered all alike with lead, that is to say twelve of a side with magnificent Balustrades behind. They ascend this Brid Bridge by three degrees of steps, that in the midst consists of sixty six Steps, and thoseof each side, of one hundred forty five; to these rarities, may be added the infinite concourse of People.</p>
                     <p>And to the end we may remove that erroneous opinion that this City was built by Fishermen; let us observe what <hi>Cassiodoro,</hi> who was Counsellor, and Secretary of <hi>Theodorick</hi> King of the <hi>Gothes</hi> speaks thereof. <hi>Vos</hi> (saith he) <hi>Qui numerosa navigia in ejus confinio possidetis, &amp; Venetia plenae nobilibus, &amp;c.</hi> which happening in the four hundred ninty and fifth year of our Salvation, and from the building thereof between 80. and 90. years, gives a fair presumption, that the <hi>Vene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tians</hi>

could not acquire so great reputation, nor less possess so ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny Vessels on the Sea, had they not been somewhat rich and noble too sometime before.</p>
                     <p>Your next visit must be to the Arsenal, or Magazine of War of this City, seated on the one side of it towards the two Castles, and <hi>Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lace</hi> of the Patriark, which are compassed about with high Walls, and with the Sea. This Arsenal affords but one entrance by one only Gate, and by one only Chanel, where thorow are guided in all the shipping, and 'tis about the quantity of two miles in circuit. Here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in generally they make all their works, and engines of War, but most particularly their Charge is to prepare here these 4. Materials for that Service, Timber, Iron, Brass, and Hemp. Of which their charge of Timber-work, they are so provident, (that besides what at first shewes itself to the view) there is under the water a good quantity of Gallies, great and small, Gallefoists, Pinnaces, Brigan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tines, Masts, Main-yards, Oars, and Rudders, for their Sea ves<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sels. And for the Iron work, Bullets of all sizes, Nayls, Chains, Anchors, with divers Plates of Iron, as likewise for Brass, all sorts of Ordnance, and of all proportions. And lastly, of their Hempen works, all sorts of Shrouds, Sails and Cables. To which seve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral works, continually attend a vast number of Workmen, and ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cellent Handicraftsmen, who being as it were born in that Place, and from thence obteining their livelihood, Neither delight in a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny other Place, nor do no other thing, but what there by their seve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral Callings they are directed unto.</p>
                     <p>Therein are erected most ample Arches, wherein their several Vessels are kept dry, and built, some fully finished, some build<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, and others repairing. The next Curiosity, is their spati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous Halls, full of Arms for defence in <hi>Maritine</hi> service, as great Celades, Cariages, and Breasts; and no less provided of Offensive Weapons, as Pistols, Daggers, Bramble Sithes, Partisans, Jave<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lins, Two Handed Swords, Cross-bows, and Long-bows; Others of those Halls are filled with Artillery, as small and great Muskets, Falcons, whole Cannon, Demicannon, and Quarter Can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>non, Sacres, and Culverins. There are some pieces of A tillery which have from Three Barrels to Seaven, which are called (if I err not) the Organs, Engines made more for a certain Greatnesse and Mag<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nificence, than for use and service in War. To say no more, the whole is kept and governed with that order and neatness, that it doth not onely delight the Beholder, but would satisfie the most insatiable Appetite of gazers, and fill them with a certain spritely and Martial Ardour.</p>
                     <p>In fine, the Common wealth hath in this place all sorts of Ammu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nition of Warr, as well for Land as Sea-service. All Engines for of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fence, all charges for defence, and lastly, all things whatsoever made ready, either to set in order an Armado for Sea service, or an Army for Land-service, which may be needful. And although from this place (which may properly be called the Work-house and Store<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>house of War) they every Day fetch Arms and Ammunition, as well for their force upon the firm Land, as upon the Sea; Yet nevertheless, by the daily labours of the Artizans, 'tis so restored, that it seems to no more diminish, than the Sea does by the many Rivers that is<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sue

Furthermore here is kept the stately Galley called the <hi>Bocentoro,</hi> adorned greatly with Gold and rich carvings, which ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver goes forth but upon solemn Feast Dayes, and particularly upon the Day of the Ascension of our Saviour, on which Day, the Prince in great state, with a Train of the principal Senatours enter herein, and being thence rowed to the Port of the two Castles near the <hi>Adri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>atick</hi> Sea, there after certain Ceremonies, the Duke solemnly marries the Sea, and casts therein a Gold Ring, in real assurance of this Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>publicks Dominion thereof.</p>
                     <p>This Republick allow the Greck Church a full liberty in <hi>Venice,</hi> who use as much ceremony in their Religion as the Church of <hi>Rome,</hi> but less superstition. Nor have the <hi>Jewes</hi> mean privileges, (for pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vided they alwais wear a red hat to denote the Blood they wisht and drew upon their own heads when they crucified our Saviour, and without which tis Lawfull for any one to kill them) they have as great immunities in all things as the Naturals, and more power than the Common sort; here also they have a Synagogue for every Nati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, whereof they have nine in their <hi>Guetta</hi> or Court, which is as<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>signed them for their habitation. Their concourse hither is from their immunities grown innumerable, which I suppose may give as great occasion as any other for this Cities vast Traffique whereof she is Mistress in these parts, as also for the rise and fall of the Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>change at the pleasure of her Merchants: in their Bank are managed vast sumes of money, and infinite exchanges dayly made, and yet a very small sum of money told out or payed through the yeer, such is the Reputation of those eminent Senators who are there the Bankers, where most of the Merchants accounts are kept for a small matter; the Ducket de Banco, whereby they compute their greatest sums and govern their exchanges, is but an imaginary Coyn, rising and falling at their pleasure. The Citizens rich and poor, wear a black Cap edged with fur on their heads, and are habited common<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly with a long black Gown with large sleeves with a kind of skirt to throw over one shoulder, and their Collar alwaies open. Their La<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dies did formerly wear their own or a counterfet hair below the shoulders trimmed with gemms and flowers, and mounted in their Chappenes (high as a mans legg) they walk between two hand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maids to distinguish themselves from the Courtezans, (from whom the State for their free trade extract a great excise yeerly) who go covered with a white veil of tiffany. But of late yeers they use the French freedome both in habit and conversation much differing from the Italian restriction through their Jealousie. We had almost forgot the Island of <hi>Zuecca</hi> (distant from <hi>Venice</hi> one mile) wherein<note place="margin">Zuecca.</note> vast Edifices as well for divine worship, as for the use of the Citi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zens, with stately Gardens discover themselves; among the rest the Church (<hi>del Redentore</hi>) or of the Redeemer deserves a place even amongst the fairest of <hi>Venice</hi> for its splendor and sumptuousness, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing designed by <hi>Palladius</hi> the famous Architect, and built by order and at the cost of the State by a unanimous Vow which they made in the yeer 1576 when they were infected with an extreme plague: Which to denote, over one of the Gates of the right side of the said Church, we finde it thus written.

                        <note place="margin">Lizafusina.</note> so called from a Dutch word corrupted: At which place the direct course of the River <hi>Brent,</hi> was heretofore by the Lords of <hi>Venice</hi> ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tificially locked up, to the end, that running through those Pools and salt Moors, it might not through time and continual running work down the neighbouring Grounds: which to prevent, there was an Engine erected (called <hi>La Rota del Carro</hi>) whereby with ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cellent Industry, the Barkes, with all their Lading and Merchan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dize, were drawn up and transposed from out of these Pools, or salt Moors, into the River, and out of the River in like manner into the Pools; which at this time is taken away, and for supply thereof, the water is locked in with four several Flood-gates, the first at <hi>Strà,</hi> the second at <hi>Dolo,</hi> the third at <hi>Mirà,</hi> and the last at <hi>Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ranzan.</hi> From <hi>Lizafusina</hi> to <hi>Padoua</hi> they account four Miles, whereby they travel either in Boats, which are drawn up against the stream of the River, or else by Land. On each side of which River through<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out, appears a large and most fertile <hi>Campagna,</hi> with a rich soyl, embellished with stately and most sumptuous Palaces, and lovely Gardens, and no lesse beautified with the continual travelling of all sorts of People to and fro. First they arrive at the Country of <hi>Ori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ago,</hi> called in Latin <hi>Or a lacus,</hi> because to this place extend the Moorish Grounds or sholes, thence at <hi>Dolo,</hi> and then at <hi>Strà;</hi> Upon the left Hand, stands the great Town of <hi>Gambarare,</hi> so infinitely populous, that tis almost incredible; In the end they attain at <hi>Padoua.</hi>

                        <p>The ancient City of <hi>Padoua,</hi> is seated in the Province belonging
<pb n="18" facs="tcp:62973:21" rendition="simple:additions"/>
to <hi>Venice,</hi> called <hi>Marca Trivigiana,</hi> in the midst of a spacious Plain, having the Sea at Twenty Miles distance on the East and South parts thereof: Towards the West, a large champion Country; And towards the North, the Mountains <hi>Euganei;</hi> It is of a triangular form, invironed with double Walls, and very deep Ditches; The <hi>Venetians</hi> have fortified it very much, by the immense Walls and Bulwarks, built by them according to the modern way of Discipline and Judgement in Warr.</p>
                        <p>We need not produce Testimony from antient Writers, to prove the Antiquity of this City, nor that it was founded by <hi>Antenor,</hi> Brother of <hi>Priam</hi> King of <hi>Troy,</hi> and that it was denominated hereto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore <hi>Pado,</hi> either from <hi>Pò,</hi> or <hi>Patavio</hi> of <hi>Paphlagonia,</hi> because these things are notorious to all; As also that <hi>Padoua</hi> was Head of the Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vince of <hi>Venice,</hi> now <hi>Marca Trivigiana,</hi> or <hi>Marquisate</hi> of <hi>Treves,</hi> and that it was ever Friend, and allied to <hi>Rome</hi> without any kind of sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jection, being extremely beloved and estemed, not lesse for their Alliance or Parentage, having their joynt Original from the Famous <hi>Troy,</hi> than for the many services and kindnesse received from it. Nor find we in any Author, That <hi>Padoua</hi> was either subjugated, over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come, or molested by the <hi>Romans,</hi> but that it alwayes stood free from the <hi>Roman</hi> Yoke, and that it aided the Republick on many occasi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons; And particularly, at that time when <hi>Rome</hi> was taken by the <hi>Galli Sireni,</hi> in the Warr against the <hi>Umbri, Boi,</hi> the <hi>Cimbri,</hi> and at several other times; So that it well merited and obtained the Fran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chise and Liberty of Citizens and Comunalty of <hi>Rome,</hi> and to be in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>scribed in the <hi>Fabian</hi> Tribe of <hi>Rome,</hi> without sending thither new Inhabitants, or making it a Colony, from whence the <hi>Padouans</hi> de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rived equal voice both Active and Passive, and participated all the highest degrees of that great Sate; And therefore we read in the Histories of <hi>Rome,</hi> and in those of <hi>Padoua,</hi> That many <hi>Padouan</hi> Houses transferred themselves to <hi>Rome,</hi> &amp; as many Roman Houses to avoid the Civil dissentions translated themselves to <hi>Padoua.</hi> We may then conclude it to be no great wonder, that we find in so many ancient Writers, and upon so many Marble Stones, the Remembrance of so many Citizens of <hi>Padoua</hi> that were Roman Consuls, as <hi>Quinto At<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tio Capitone, Sesto Papinio Alenio, L. Arontio Primo, L. Stella Poeta, L. Arontio Aquila, Giulio Lupo, L. Giulio Paulo</hi> the Expounder of the Law, <hi>L. Ascanio Pediano, Trasea Peto, C. Cecinna Peto, Pub. Quartio,</hi> and some others. Another <hi>Peto</hi> was designed Consul, and <hi>Peto Honorato</hi> was Corrector of <hi>Italy,</hi> so also many were Ediles, Praetors, Tribunes, Censors, Priests, and chief Bushops. It was then so great and pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>erful, that they<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> used to muster five Hundred Cavaliers or Horse<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men, And <hi>Strabo</hi> writes, that they commonly sent to the wars, one Hundred and twenty Thousand Foot Souldiers. It maintain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed it self ever glorious and invincible, until the Barbarous Nations made themselvs to be felt in <hi>Italy,</hi> for at the time of the Roman Empires declination, <hi>Padoua</hi> also indured the smart, being by the most Potent <hi>Attila</hi> (the Rod of God) wholly ruinated, and cast down even to the very Foundations; And though after that it was restored by <hi>Narsete,</hi> yet was it another time destroyed by the <hi>Longo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bardi.</hi> But afterwards under <hi>Charles</hi> the Great and his Successors, it began to fill it self, and to take some small restoration. This Ci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty
<pb n="19" facs="tcp:62973:21"/>
was governed at first by Consuls, and after with a <hi>Podestà,</hi> or Provost, at such time as it became under the Power of <hi>Eccelli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>no</hi> the Tyrant, who treated it most cruelly, which evidently appears; For at this day, neer the Church of Saint <hi>Augustine,</hi> they shew a great Tower, wherein the <hi>Padouans</hi> were imprisoned, tormented and slain, nay the Cruelty of this wicked Tyrant so far exceeded, that in one day in the City of <hi>Verona,</hi> for no other cause than his fantasti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cal humour, he caused twelve thousand <hi>Padouans</hi> to be Butchered. Out of the ruines of so many noble Palaces destroyed by him, he intended and begun near the Bridge a new Cittadel for his habita<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion and security, but he lived not to finish above a fourth part, which is built with walls of a vast thickness with flint-stones squa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red, with a fair Palace and a proud Tower, which in truth is the most beautifull in all <hi>Padoua</hi> (and is possessed at present by <hi>Il Signor Conte Giacomo Zabarella.</hi>) Many notable things are extant in this Ci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty, but in particular there is a vault under ground which passeth under the River, and goes even to the <hi>Piazza,</hi> to the Palace of the Captain, and to the other abovenamed Cittadel. After his death <hi>Padoua</hi> recovered her Liberty, and became very powerfull, so that she got under her dominion, <hi>Vicenza, Verona, Trento, Treviso, Fel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tre, Belluno, Conegliano, Ceneda, Saravalle, Chioza,</hi> and <hi>Bassano,</hi> with all their Territories, all the good ground among the <hi>Fennes,</hi> and the greatest part of the <hi>Friuli,</hi> and other important places; then the <hi>Carraresi</hi> made themselves Lords thereof, and kept the power a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout one hundred yeers; at last the <hi>Venetians</hi> got the possession, ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving slain <hi>Francesco Novello</hi> with all his Children, and extinguished the principality of the <hi>Carraresi.</hi> Through this City runs the River <hi>Brent</hi> together with the <hi>Bacchiglione,</hi> which dividing it self into ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny branches gives a great accomodation to the Citizens. One of which branches or Arms they have brought to pass thorow the dike round about the Walls of the City. It affords in great aboundance all necessaries for livelihood, from whence the Proverb arises, <hi>Bolognia (Grassa</hi>) or wallowes in good cheer, but <hi>Padoua (surpassa</hi>) sur-passeth it. The bread they make here is the whitest of <hi>Italy;</hi> And the wine is by <hi>Plinie</hi> accounted amongst the most noble and excellent. This City hath about it seven gates, many Stone Bridges, five spacious <hi>Piazzaes,</hi> with many beautiful Edifices as well publick as private: Particularly the Palace used for the civil Law is the proudest in all <hi>Europe,</hi> if not in all the World, for so much as that it is covered with Lead, without sustaining either of Pillars or Beams, though its bredth is eighty six foot, and length two hundred fifty six. Which Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lace after it had continued a foot 202 yeers being in part ruinated by fire, the <hi>Venetian</hi> Lords in the yeer 1420 rebuilt with greater splen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dour. The figure of this Hall is like a Quarry of glass with equal sides, but not right angled, not for the nearness of the Fabrick as some will have it, but because natural reason shewes, that a man standing bolt upright is with much more ease thrown down than when he stands a little drawn backwards, its site is turned to the fower Quarters of Heaven, so that at the Equinoctial the Beams of the Sun at his rising entring through the Eastern Windowes, beat upon the Western Windowes, between which is nothing erected to ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>struct it: and so upon the contrary. And at the solstice or<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> stay of
<pb n="20" facs="tcp:62973:22" rendition="simple:additions"/>
the Sun, when it can neither go higher nor lower, the Beams enter thorow the Gates on the South part, and play upon the opposite part; in sum, there is neither Gate or any other part without excellent Art and workmanship. The painting of it represents the influence of the superiour bodies upon the inferiour, divided with the signs of the <hi>Zodiack,</hi> in imitation of that Circle of Gold which stood in the Sepulcher of <hi>Simandio</hi> King of <hi>Egypt:</hi> In this Painting is to be no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted the Antient Habits, and amongst others a Priest, who holds a Planet upon his back, which antiently they used large and of rich stuff, from whence it took its name. The Inventer of these Paintings averreth that this was <hi>Pietro d'Abano</hi> a <hi>Padouan,</hi> who was a most fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mous Philosopher and Astrologer, whom it may well be, since so many yeers before past, that these present Paintings copyed by the hands of certain <hi>Florentines,</hi> were drawn out from those which were preserved in the Antient Palace, by the hand of <hi>Giotto,</hi> and really these modern ones are very like to those which in the plain <hi>Astrolobe</hi> designed by the invention of <hi>Pietro d'Abano</hi> are treated on by <hi>Pierio</hi> in the thirty second and thirty ninth book of his hierogli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficks. And if the Antients made such a noise and so much ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count of the <hi>Obelisk</hi> which in the Field of <hi>Mars</hi> in <hi>Rome</hi> shewed by his shadow the length of the Nights and Days, what shall we say of this Fabrick, wherein are collected so many noble secrets all worthy to be contemplated and admired?</p>
                        <p>Whosoever hath an appetite in <hi>Padoua</hi> to behold Paintings let them see the Church of the Confraternity of Saint <hi>Antonio,</hi> where they'l meet Pictures upon boards drawn by <hi>Titian,</hi> and other fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mous Masters, the Chapel of Saint <hi>Luke</hi> in the Sanctuary, where may be seen the true effigies of <hi>Eccellino</hi> the Tyrant, as also in the Font of the <hi>Domo</hi> or chief Church by the hand of an excellent Lymner. In the remarkeable Hall of the Lords of <hi>Zabarella Ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>raria</hi> may be seen pourtrayed the first Subjects of this City, as <hi>Antenor</hi> its Founder, <hi>Volusio</hi> the Poet, <hi>T.

                        <p>In the next place are presented to our view and admiration sea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven marvellous things which are Temporal, and seaven that are Ecclesiastick, besides many others: For the first seaven are named <hi>il Pallazzo della Ragione</hi> or Hall of Justice, the Publick Schools, the Palace of <hi>Foscari alla Arena,</hi> the Court or Palace of the Chieftain,

                        </p>
                        <p>In the <hi>Palazza della Ragione</hi> or Hall of Justice abovenamed are standing fair Antiquities, among others is one of that immortal Treasure of History and Antiquity, <hi>Livie:</hi> in whose ever-living memory on that side of this Hall towards the West, is erected a Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pulchre or Monument with this old inscription or epitaph added thereunto.

                        <p>To conclude with this Palace or Hall of Justice, if considered as an upper Room, tis the fairest and most spacious of <hi>Christendome,</hi> of which there is no part but hath some Astronomical secret; tis con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vered with Lead, and round about goes a stately corridor of Marble.</p>
                        <p>Near the abovenamed Palace stand the Schools for all Learning; which is the second Marvel, not only of <hi>Padoua</hi> but of <hi>Europe,</hi> within is a square Court, the building two stories high one over ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, sustained with most fair Pillars; and round about in every cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner are the Arms of all such as have been Consuls or Protectors in that <hi>University;</hi> some in colours only, some in colours and stone, with their Country, name, and yeer set up, at the <hi>Venetians</hi> charge, to make famous this Nursery of Learning. The <hi>Anatomick Theater</hi> erected in those Schools stands above, and is most neatly contrived, and most commodious both for the Professor &amp; the Spectators. This <hi>University</hi> of <hi>Padoua</hi> is as it were the Market place of Learning (and much ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proaches the Academy of <hi>Athens</hi>) To this place from all parts of the World throng the most eminent in all the liberal sciences, and no small number of the Nobles as Scholars, not only from all parts of <hi>Italy</hi> and its neighbouring Provinces, but from the farthest parts of the World. In this City are ten Colleges, where are allowed ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nourable Pensions to many Scholars.</p>
                        <p>The first College stands in the Street <hi>Santo</hi> called <hi>Prattense,</hi> derive<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing its name from its Founder <hi>Pileo Conte di Prata,</hi> Cardinal, and Bi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>shop of <hi>Padoua,</hi> in which are appointed 20 Scholars, <hi>Padouans, Ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>netians, Trivisans,</hi> and <hi>Furlans,</hi> with a Prior or Governor, who heretofore kept a Coach: The Scholars pensions were 20 Crowns <hi>per</hi> Moneth and more, but the Merchants Banke of <hi>Venice</hi> (who u<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sually payed them) being of late lessened, at present, besides their Lodging and Service, they have but ten Crowns by the yeer. The Cardinal committed the Government thereof to <hi>Francesco Zabarella</hi> his Nephew, and after his death to the most antient of his house, and of that of the Family <hi>di Leone,</hi> recommending it also to the care and overseeing of the successive Bishops of <hi>Padoua,</hi> and to the Pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>or of the College of the Professors of the Laws.</p>
                        <p>The second called <hi>Spinello à Ponte Corvo</hi> instituted by <hi>Belforte Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nello</hi> of <hi>Naples,</hi> is governedby the <hi>Priors</hi> of the Masters of Art, &amp; by the most Antient of the house of Doctors, where are maintained four Scholars Masters of Arts for five yeers, two <hi>Padouans,</hi> one <hi>Trevisan,</hi> and another Stranger, each of whose allowance is twenty five Duc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kats by the yeer.</p>
                        <p>
                           <pb n="26" facs="tcp:62973:25"/>The third named <hi>da Rio</hi> built in the street so called, and instituted by that Family, consists of 4 Scholars Masters of Arts, approved by the most antient of that family, their stay is permitted for 7 yeers, their allowance is, Lodging Rooms, Bread and Wine, with twelve Duckats, and they ought to be of <hi>Padoua</hi> or its Territories.</p>
                        <p>The Fourth called <hi>del Campione</hi> situated in the <hi>borgo di Vignal</hi> is for nine Scholars in the Arts: two <hi>Padouans,</hi> two <hi>Trivisans,</hi> two <hi>Far<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>raresians,</hi> two <hi>French men,</hi> and one other Foreiner, and for seaven yeers, they are allowed Wheat, Wine, Wood, Service, Lodging, and some moneys. The Patrone or Master is the <hi>Abbot</hi> of Saint <hi>Ci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prian</hi> of <hi>Muran.</hi>
                        </p>
                        <p>The fifth named <hi>Santa Cantarina</hi> is submitted to certain Noble <hi>Ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>netians,</hi> and hath for Scholars in the Arts. 16 who have Corn, Wine, Money, Salt, Lodgings, and Service allowed in a handsome proportion for seaven years.</p>
                        <p>The sixth dedicated to <hi>Santa Lucia</hi> by the <hi>Brescians</hi> conteyns 6 Scholars in the sciences chosen by the Communalty of <hi>Brescia,</hi> their allowance is 25 Duckats a peece with their Lodging and service defrayed.</p>
                        <p>The seaventh called <hi>Feltrino</hi> founded in the Street <hi>Santo,</hi> is gover<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned by the nobles of the family of <hi>Altini in feltre,</hi> the continuance of the Scholars (who must be students in the Laws) is seaven yeers, their number is but two Scholars and one-Artist, they have for allow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance a quantity of Wheat being 16 measures for each, and 10 Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stellaes of Wine with their Lodgings.</p>
                        <p>The eighth built in the Street <hi>San Leonardo</hi> named <hi>del Ravenna,</hi> is put under the tuition of <hi>Piavano di S. Giulano di Venetia,</hi> &amp; the Scho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lars have Lodging Rooms, Services, and one Duckat allowed by the yeer for each.</p>
                        <p>The ninth in the <hi>Viginali</hi> called <hi>Cocho</hi> is for Six Noble <hi>Venetians,</hi> each ones allowance, being Lodging, Service, and 40 Duckats yeerly.</p>
                        <p>The tenth called <hi>Amulio,</hi> near the <hi>Pratto della vallae,</hi> is for 12 Scho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lars Noble <hi>Venetians,</hi> founded by <hi>Marco Antonio Amulio</hi> Cardinal, and every Scholar is allowed, Lodging Rooms, his services are pay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, and six Duckats by the year.</p>
                        <p>The third notable and marvellous Temporal Rarity of <hi>Padoua</hi> is the <hi>Piazza</hi> or place caled the <hi>Arena,</hi> which is a noble Court, round about which stands the old <hi>Arches,</hi> and <hi>Vestigia</hi> of a proud <hi>Theatre,</hi> which by the antients was called <hi>Naumachia,</hi> but of later yeers they use it to run a Tilt, and for all manner of horsemanship, with ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny other games; the Ladies standing to behold them in the open Casements of that proud Palace, which stands at the head of the Court in a Lunary form, the <hi>Arena</hi> or Court being Oval.</p>
                        <p>Backwards towards the Wall are gardens filled with Vines and pretious Fruits, as, also on that side which is towards the Church of the <hi>Hermits</hi> with a small Chapel dedicated to the holy Virgin, which is also a <hi>Priorate</hi> of the house of <hi>Foscarie</hi> and belonging to that serene Family of <hi>Venice.</hi>
                        </p>
                        <p>The fourth marvellous object is the Court of the Captain or Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernour of the City, where the Proud Palace of the said <hi>Praefect,</hi> the Chamberlains and many other Citizens habitations, besides the
<pb n="27" facs="tcp:62973:25"/>
dwelling of a world of other People are so contrived that it may not improperly be called a little Cittadel: This was the Kingly house of the <hi>Carraresi,</hi> Its Chambers may truly be said to be built for Princes, with two halls which for their Largeness and Noble<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness could not be built for other; the one is Called the Hall of <hi>Gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ants,</hi> wherein stands the publick Library: here are pourtrayed the most eminent Subjects of the <hi>Roman</hi> Republick, &amp; of the World, with a representation of their most famous Acts, by the hand of <hi>Gualterio</hi> a most eminent Lymner, with their Elegies under each figure, hereto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore composed by the most virtuous <hi>Giovanni di Cavazzi</hi> a gentlema<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> of <hi>Padoua,</hi> and inscribed in a signal Character by <hi>Pietro Francesco Pucivi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>giano</hi> called the <hi>Moor:</hi> The Books conteyned in the said Library are most excellent and in great abundance; The signor <hi>Gio Battista Salvatico,</hi> Doctor, Knight, and a Gentleman of <hi>Padoua</hi> bequeathed to it, by his Testament, his Collection of the Books of the Laws of a great valew. The signor <hi>Giacomo Caino</hi> a Gentleman of <hi>Furlan</hi> Doctor and Reader in the College hath likewise given to it the Li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brary of <hi>Pompeo Cacino</hi> a Physician his Uncle, of no less esteem; The signor <hi>Conte Giacomo Zabarella</hi> hath added to it a brave quantity of Manuscripts, some writ in parchment, others in paper bound in Leather Lymned with Vermillion and Gold rarely and exquisitely: some whereof were never Printed, amongst which are the workes of Cardinal <hi>Zabarella,</hi> of the Count <hi>Giacomo Zabarella</hi> his Grandfa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther of Philosophy; of the Count <hi>Francesco</hi> his Father, which are in rime and prose in the <hi>Tuscan</hi> Tongue very learned, and treating of many subjects concerning his own Family: Therein also are the Works of <hi>Cesare Cremonio</hi> the Philosopher, and many other bought at the Publick cost, and others added there by the Signor <hi>Ottavio Fer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rari</hi> a Gentleman of <hi>Milan</hi> Reader of Humanity in the Schools, and the publick Library Keeper, which Library is every day so increased by the Nobility and others, that tis well hoped within a lit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle time twill arrive to the Reputation of the richest and most fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mous in the World.</p>
                        <p>The fifth wonder is the Castle for the <hi>Munition</hi> above named near the Church of Saint <hi>Agostino,</hi> which was built by the Tyrant <hi>Eccelli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lino</hi> for his safeguard, wherein he slew so many Noble <hi>Padouans,</hi> that he had almost destroyed the whole City: herein are the publick <hi>Gra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>naries</hi> to maintain plenty in the City, and all sorts of Ammunition for its defence in time of need.</p>
                        <p>The sixth admirable thing is the <hi>Ponte Molino;</hi> so called from the thirty wheels of Mills there erected (a most signal Object) and the five Arches of flint Stone; near which stands a Palace in manner of a Fortress built with those very Large squared &amp; wrought Stones w<hi rend="sup">ch</hi> were brought from the other ruinated Palaces and Forts by <hi>Eccellino</hi> the Tyrant, with a Fort and most fayr Tower, in the yeer 1250 And is now possessed by the Count <hi>Giacomo Zabarella,</hi> as is above said.</p>
                        <p>The seventh wonderfull Object of <hi>Padoua</hi> is <hi>il Prato della, valle</hi> a Meadow so ample that twould alone contain a great City: It was antiently called <hi>Campo Marzo,</hi> the field of <hi>Mars,</hi> from the <hi>Martial</hi> ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ercises there used, and in this place were many Saints beheaded by the <hi>Pagans,</hi> to such a number that they are wont to say that part
<pb n="29" facs="tcp:62973:26"/>
which is compassed by Water was emplastered with the blood of those Martyrs: Here every first <hi>Saturday</hi> of the Moneth is held a free Fayr or Market of all sorts of Cattel and other Creatures, and at the Feast of Saint <hi>Antonio</hi> is a famous Fayr there, which although it happens in the hottest Weather, being there kept for fifteen days in the midest of <hi>June,</hi> and that there are then many thousands of Creatures, yet there is never seen a Fly to molest them.</p>
                        <p>If to these might be added an eighth Wonder, we would name the Vineyard or Garden of the Knight <hi>Bonifacio Papa fava,</hi> situate in the Street called <hi>Vanzo,</hi> where besides a most fair and adorned Palace, you beholds many statues of excellent workmanship, and infinite numbers of Cittron and Orange Trees, which forme lovely walks to the Passengers, for beautifying whereof, of those Trees are framed Arches and Prospects to delight the eye; to whose confines is conjoyned a full stream of water brought from the main River by a curious Aqueduct, which being confined to one Gate un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der the Wall, gives at its utterance a sweet murmur, and with its clear gurgling on every side washes the Foot of the Palace: And the flowry bankes within which the said Rivolet is contained ren<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders the Palace as it were in an Island of so specious delights and pleasant Savours, that what is added by Art to that of Nature may well cause it to be termed the eighth wonder. Hither flock for their Pastime the Ladies and Gallants of <hi>Padoua,</hi> inviteing with them also the Foreiners with their Musick and other Pastimes, where (in the hottest Weather) the shade of the Trees, the Ample<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness of the Walks, the pleasantness of the Waters, and the beauty of the site add (to their other joys and delights) a fresh Ayr. And although these beauties shew themselves in perfection, yet that magnanimous Cavalier never ceases to illustrate it (to his no small costs) with greater delights; and by this and his other Gallantries shewes himself to be born of that Family which for its Greatness and Dominion was no less formidable in <hi>Italy,</hi> than renowned in <hi>Europe.</hi> At this present resides here, this Noble Person with his Brother <hi>Sci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pio Papafava,</hi> Knight of the great Cross of the Order of <hi>Hierusalem,</hi> Prior of <hi>Messina,</hi> and the most worthy Primate of the whole King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome of <hi>Sicilia,</hi> together with the virtuous <hi>Roberto</hi> Son of the a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bove named Cavalier <hi>Bonifacio,</hi> young in yeers, but his conditions a<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">

                           </gap>d practices may challenge the ripest Age, who is the Comendatory Abbot of <hi>Sebinico,</hi> being Doctor of Philosophy, of Divinity &amp; of the Laws, a true Splendor to his Country and Family, being conver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sant in the Greek, Latine, and Hebrew Tongues, and well known in the Mathematicks, as was testified by the singular experiments of his Ingenuity some Moneths since. There flourishes likewise of this Noble Family at this time a numerous company of Cavaliers and great Subjects, who degrade not from their most famous and Anti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ent Progenitors, of whom to speak but little will diminish from their Fame, and much is not opportune in this place: for their Ordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nary dwelling, these Signors have a Palace in the Street <hi>San Fran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cesco Maggiore,</hi> where they have Coppies of exquisite Books in all the Professions, left them by Monsignor <hi>Ubertino Papafava</hi> Bishop of <hi>Adria,</hi> Brother of <hi>Bonifacio,</hi> besides many antient Manuscripts and Authors not yet printed, which relate the Histories of this Family
<pb n="29" facs="tcp:62973:26"/>
also the old coyning Press of the <hi>Carraresian</hi> Princes, with other pretious monuments of this House, preserved in the Chamber of Rowles of the said Palace, which may be termed the most large and worth seeing of this City.</p>
                        <p>And now we come to the Spiritual wonders and Churches of <hi>Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>doua,</hi> whereof the first is the <hi>Domo</hi> or Cathedral Church, situate (near) in the midst of the City. The <hi>Padouans</hi> were converted to the Christian Faith, by the predication of Saint <hi>Prosdocimo</hi> their first Bishopp authorized by Saint <hi>Peter,</hi> who (among others) bapti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zed <hi>Vitaliono</hi> the Chief Man in this City, who therefore built the Church of Saint <hi>Soffia. Henry</hi> the fourth Emperor enriched this Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thedral, giving to it twenty seaven rich Canonicats, of so good a revenew that they may be styled so many Bishops; among which are four dignities, that is to say, Arch- priest, Arch. Deacon, The Person that hath charge of the wax, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> And the Deacon; there are twelve under Canons, six Custodi or Rectors, and six <hi>Mansona<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry</hi> or Houskeepers, and more than 60 other Persons and Clerks be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>longing to the Chapel, besides the Masters of Grammar and Mu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sick<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> with many excellent Singers, so that this Clergy exceeds a hun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dred Persons, and their Revenew above a hundred thousand Duck<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ats by the yeer, which makes it the most noble and Rich of <hi>Italy:</hi> and therefore tis that the Bishop of <hi>Padoua</hi> is styled a little Pope, and his Canons with some reason the Cardinals of <hi>Lombardy,</hi> for that their Chapter is alwaies filled with the Nobility of <hi>Venice, Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>doua,</hi> and other Cities, whereof so many have ascended to the Miter, and Hatt, that tis worthily called to this day the Seminary of Cardinals and great Prelates.</p>
                        <p>In this Church (not elsewhere as is pretended) lyes enterred the Wife of <hi>Henry</hi> the fourth, whose name was <hi>Berta,</hi> as is proved by this antique Inscription.

                     <p>In the Reign of <hi>Ottone</hi> the First, it again recovered its Liberty; but discords arising among the Citizens, it was opprest by the Tyranny of <hi>Ezzelino,</hi> and the <hi>Scaligiri,</hi> its own Citizens, who Lorded it for 200. yeers, Last of all being also opprest by others, it voluntarily ren<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dred it self to the power of the <hi>Venetians</hi> who in those daies, were e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>steemed the Justest of Lords.

A small River called <hi>Garcia</hi> passeth thorow the City, which at its issuing forth is artificially drawn on this and that side to irrigate their Fields.

                        <hi>MIlan</hi> was an antient and illustrious City, and for a long time (through its beauty remained an imperial Seat.) Behind its shoulders rise those Mountains which separate <hi>Italy.</hi> Before it is a long and spatious Plain which extending it self above 200. miles, reacheth the Church lands between <hi>Rimio</hi> and <hi>Pesaro</hi> on the one side, and <hi>Istria</hi> and <hi>Osia,</hi> on the other side. Whereof <hi>Polibius</hi> writes thus. There is a plain, between the <hi>Alps</hi> and the <hi>Apennines</hi> of a triangular Forn, wherein are pleasant Fields above all the Fields not only of <hi>Italy</hi> but all <hi>Europe.</hi> Of which Triangle, the <hi>Apennines</hi> form one side, the <hi>Alps</hi> another, and the <hi>Adriatick</hi> Sea or Gulf of <hi>Venice</hi> (as it were the basis to the other two) makes up the third side.</p>
                     <p>And although <hi>Milan</hi> was heretofore a small Town, it was never<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>theless much aggrandized and amplified by <hi>Belovese</hi> King of the <hi>Galls,</hi> having environed it with a Wall 24. foot broad, and 64. feet high, which compassed in all the Streets and round of the City: in which Wall were raised 130. Bulwarks, and Towers of immense bigness and heighth, which had six principal Gates. This was effect<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed 270 yeers before <hi>Brenta</hi> King of the <hi>Senoni,</hi> fell down into <hi>Italy,</hi> who threw down and levelled it with the Foundations. But the <hi>Roman</hi> Senate having restored it to its first form and beauty, and be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing increased in Riches and People, <hi>Attila</hi> King of the <hi>Hunns</hi> descen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding into <hi>Italy,</hi> ruined it once more.</p>
                     <p>Afterwards, twas again rebuilt by the Arch-Bishop <hi>Eusebius,</hi> rearing the Wall again, and re-edifying the ruinated Building. And one hundred yeers after, that is in <hi>Anno Salutis</hi> 577. the <hi>Goths</hi> exer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cised so great cruelty towards the <hi>Milanesi,</hi> that after they had cast
<pb n="65" facs="tcp:62973:44"/>
down the Walls, and Edifices, they in one day slew thirty thou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sand Citizens.</p>
                     <p>This City was likewise ill treated by <hi>Erimberto</hi> Brother of the King of <hi>France,</hi> and by <hi>Federick Barbarossa</hi> the Emperor: who with in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tendment of its perpetual desolation ploughed &amp; sowed it w<hi rend="sup">th</hi>. salt, but being afterwards reconciled to the Citizens, he restored it to its former beauty, encompassing it round with a wall, wherein were set out six principal Gates: At which time, <hi>viz.</hi> in the 1177. year, the circnit of it was six miles without the suburbs, but now there is a Wall drawn round, which comprehends therein the Su<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>burbs also, which was done by <hi>Gonzaga</hi> Lieutenant of the Emperor <hi>Charls</hi> the 5th. and is in circumference ten miles, having very deep Fosses or Ditches, and ten Gates.</p>
                     <p>This City, before the coming of <hi>Belloveso,</hi> as is aforesaid, was but a Town called <hi>Subria</hi> built by the <hi>Tuscans,</hi> then <hi>Belloveso</hi> coming from <hi>Gallia,</hi> beat out the <hi>Tuscans,</hi> aggrandized and much beautified the Town: As to the name <hi>Mediolano,</hi> as formerly called, diverse are the opinions, some say twas so called for that it was seated be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween two Rivers, the <hi>Adda</hi> and the <hi>Tesino.</hi> Others say, that name was imposed on it by <hi>Belloveso</hi> by the command of the Gods, giving him to understand, that he should build a City where he should find a Farrowing Sow, half black and half white, with Wool between her shoulders: Whence finding such a Sow in that place, and esteeming it a good augure and praesage, he built it, naming it <hi>Mediolana,</hi> as much as to say, <hi>Meza Lana,</hi> or half Wool, in remembrance of which thing we find in a Marble over the Gate of the Palace of Merchants the shape and figure of the said <hi>Scrofa</hi> or Farrowing Sow.</p>
                     <p>The <hi>Galls</hi> kept the Dominion of this City, a long time, under <hi>Bel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>loveso</hi> and his Successors, till they were beaten out by the <hi>Romans,</hi> who subjected it for a great while to them, under whom it augmen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted in riches and People, chiefly under the Emperors as well Greek as Latine; some whereof much delighted to reside there, invited thereto by the beauty of the place, and the comodiousness of ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>naging the Wars against the <hi>French</hi> and <hi>Germans,</hi> as necessity required. It so much humoured <hi>Trajan,</hi> the Emperor, that he there built that proud Palace which to this day retains his memory.</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>Adrian, Massiminian, Hercules, Filippo</hi> a Christian Emperor, <hi>Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stantine, Constanzo, Theodosio,</hi> with many other Emperors, dwelt there, left most stately Edifices, and caused four Wi-draughts or Common shores to be dugg, which continue to this day. Afterwards it became subject to the <hi>Goths,</hi> and to the <hi>Longobards,</hi> who being driven out by <hi>Charls</hi> the great, it came under the power of the Emperors. In which time <hi>Contado Suevio</hi> being Emperor, it began to take boldness and aspire to Liberty, when Justice was administred by the Captains and other Officers elected by the People uniting with them the Pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mate or Arch-Bishop of the City, by the Peoples election: In which time great discord arising between the Nobility and Plebeians, and thereby governing themselves very ill, they to prevent those disor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders put themselves under the power of those of <hi>Torre,</hi> afterwards to the <hi>Visconti,</hi> who a great space kept the Dominion, whom the <hi>Sforzeschi</hi> succeeded, them the <hi>French,</hi> and last of all the house of <hi>Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stria</hi> obtained it, and keep it to this day in good peace and tran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quillity.</p>

                        <hi>Milan</hi> lies under the sixth Climate or Degree, which affords it a great benignity of the skies, yet the Ayr is somewhat thick. Cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nels of water environ both the City and Suburbs, upon which by Barks they conveigh great abundance of goods and provisions of all sorts. In truth tis a wonderfull thing to behold the great plenty of all things, for the life or necessity of Man, which are there, and tis held for certain, that in no other part of <hi>Europe<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
                        </hi> there is so great provision for the Belly, nor at less price, than is here: whence the Proverb is taken <hi>Solo in Milano si mangia.</hi> For whereas in other Cities one finds not above three <hi>Piazzaes</hi> at most, where are kept sueh pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lick Markets, in <hi>Milan</hi> there are a hundred, whereof 21. are prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cipal, which every fourth day of the week are vastly laden with all sorts of Provisions: For wines they chiefly have <hi>Vernaccie</hi> of <hi>Mont<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>f<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">

                     <p>Tis seated in a wide Plain, having about it green hills, delight<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full Meadows, navigable Rivers and Lakes, which furnish them with delicate Fish. In summ, this Country affords in most plentifull mea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sure whatsoever can be desired. Tis so thronged with <hi>Artizans</hi> of all sorts, that the vulgar proverb goes.

                     <p>But the chief of them are Gold-Smiths, Armourers, Gun-makers, and Weavers, who here exceed in these particulars, and in works of Christal, either <hi>Venice</hi> or any other part of <hi>Italy;</hi> the Nunns work here likewise most exact and neat curiosities in straw works. It a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bounds likewise with most magnificent and Stately Palaces, among which the stupendious Palace of <hi>Tomaso Marini</hi> (built with so vast ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pence and Artifice, that whoever beholds it stands amazed) shines like the Moon among the Starrs.</p>
                     <p>The Castle of <hi>Porta Zobbia,</hi> named among the chief of <hi>Europe,</hi> both for its site, greatness, beauty, and its plenty of Artiglery, Arms, and Ammunition, is so impregnable, that hitherto twas never taken by force, but through failer of provisions and Famine it hath been yeel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded up. This Fort may be compared to an indifferent City, for within it are streets, Piazzaes, Palaces, Shops for Gold-Smiths, and all other Trades whatsoever, together with all sorts of Victuals and other provision in time of War, as well as Peace. Immense <hi>Bastions,</hi> with three large profound Dykes, environ it, through which run great Chanels of Water, with a most vast Wall, and spatious Ram<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parts, under which they walk by a close way made to that pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pose. Upon the Battlements and through the Porteholes up and down, are drawn out great Mouths of Cannon, and other pieces of Artiglery set upon Iron Carriages, some whereof shoot Bullets of 800. pound weight, with such force that no obstacle can withstand them; It hath one place to lay up, and dispose the Arms in a Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pacious Arcenal, replenisht with infinite Arms of all sorts both for Offence and Defence. The Tower in the midst of it, is of a square form, and is in circuit (not reckoning the Towers which one may

call little Forts) 200. paces. The whole Castle or Fort is 1600. paces in circum ference, besides the Trenches. In fine tis accounted by all Ingineers the fairest and strongest fortification of <hi>Europe.</hi> They un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>willingly admit any Stranger to see the out-works, much less the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teriour parts.</p>
                     <p>It abounds with rare and excellent Pictures, among others there is one upon the Front of a Palace near the Fort, wherein are painted the Acts of the <hi>Romaus,</hi> by the hand of <hi>Trofo da Monza,</hi> so divinely, that tis impossible to add to it. The Images are done so exact to the life and so natural, that all the beholders rest astonisht, and expect speech from those inanimate (but seeming breathing, and moving) Pictures.</p>
                     <p>To say no more, Art here hath overcome Nature. Towards the Gate <hi>Beatrice,</hi> is the Front of another Palace (of the <hi>Lituadi</hi>) painted so rarely well by the hand of <hi>

                        <hi>Milan</hi> from the death of <hi>Belloveso</hi> continued ever head of the adja<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cent Countrey, which made the antient Emperors to send thither a Lieutenant with title of Count of <hi>Italy,</hi> who also was Captain Gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral of the Empire, and remained there with Consular authority, and Captain of their Armies, that he might bridle the Fury, and shut up the passage from the Inroads into <hi>Italy</hi> of the <hi>Ultramontaneous</hi> People.</p>
                     <p>Such is the wholsomness of the Ayr, the Beauty of the Country, and Copiousness of sustenance, that it hath tempted many Princes (desirous to rest quiet) to make this their Retreat, and <hi>Asylum,</hi> as al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>so many other great Men that they might the more commodiously apply themselves to the Study of Learning: Of which were <hi>Virgil, Alipius,</hi> Saint <hi>Augustine, Hermolao Barbaro, Merula, Francesco Filelfo, Celio Rodigino, Alexander</hi> the sixth, and <hi>Pious</hi> the fourth Popes. And although too often this City was thrown down to the very founda<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions, and at last furrowed with the plough of the Enemies, yet it ever revived again, and that with more beauty and Splendor than at first, increasing still so much in Riches and People, that it ever kept a place among the chief Cities of <hi>Italy.</hi>

                     <p>Near the Church <hi>San Salavdore,</hi> there stood a proud Palace of the Emperors, with a Temple dedicated to <hi>Jupiter,</hi> made in emulation of the <hi>Campidoglio</hi> at <hi>Rome,</hi> and where now the Counsel is kept, was the Palace for Justice; where also the Proclamations of the Dukes were accustomed to be publickly read, and the due punishments ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ecuted on Malefactors.

                     <p>FIfteen miles being passed you finde placed upon a hill the famous Church of the Virgin <hi>Maria de Loreto,</hi> visited from all parts of the World by <hi>Pilgrims,</hi> either through penance enjoyned thereto, or their own vows or devotion, Tis called <hi>Loreto,</hi> for that in antient timestood near it a Wood of Laurels. Some will have, that in the same place <hi>viz</hi> the Mou<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t, stood the Castle <hi>Cupra</hi> of the <hi>Tuscans</hi> with the antique Temple of <hi>Juno Caprana</hi> now tis a Town but yet envroned with Walls, Ditches, Fortresses, and Arms in readiness, to defend it self from the violence and snares of the <hi>Corsari,</hi> banisht Persons, Robers and other wick<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed Men, whereby the Inhabitants live securely and are well provi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in all things for the receit of strangers. 'Tis a most stately Church, built with squared Stones of excellent Marble of great cost, in the midst whereof the <hi>Pilgrims</hi> visite that most holy Chamber of the Vir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gin <hi>Mary</hi> with a great devotion, which is compassed in with a sur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rounding square of Marbles engraven and wrought with figures of admirable artifice, but so placed that it toucheth not the Walls there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of in any part, and tis credibly held, that those Walls within which the Queen of Heaven was born and brought up, ought not to be more wrought or adorned by human industry. This Chamber was brought hither from <hi>Palestina</hi> by <hi>Angells,</hi> and he is pronounced an Infidel that doubts thereof. having so many grave Authors and dayly Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>racles to prove it.</p>
                     <p>The great quantity of Tablets, Offerings, and Presents, hung up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on the Walls, Pillars, and Cornishes of the Church, at the first en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trance will raise a certain proness to honour the place in the most ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>durat heart. There it clearly appears how great and inspeakable signs the most great God shewes of his Power for the Salvation of human kind, by granting all the prayers of such as with a devout and sincere heart seek him, &amp;c.</p>
                     <p>The infinite Miracles wrought there, shew that God will be sought in one place more than another, in the Church hang many pourtraies of human misery (as in a theatre) which notwithstanding our merci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full God conduceth to a good end, as particularly by divers acci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dents by Water, evil Times, Shipwracks, Thunderbolts Earthquakes

                     <p>With which afflictions God is pleased to exercise his Children, to expresse his Clemency more than his Justice, that by it we may more truly prepare our hearts and our Souls worthy for his habitation, and for our eternal bliss.</p>
                     <p>In this Church are many rare and pretious gifts of several Princes, dedicated to the Virgin <hi>Mary,</hi> in the Vestry are kept the Vests, Ves<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sels of Gold and Silver and other Riches of immense valew, and about the Chnrch are many Tablets of Verses in praise of the Church.</p>

                  <head>The Nobleness and Magnificence of the Church of LORETO, compendiously drawn out of the five Books of <hi>Floratio Torsellino</hi> a Jesuist.</head>
                  <p>ALthough no day passeth wherein the Cel of the holy Virgin is not visited by many strangers, as well <hi>Poles, Spaniards, Germans, Portugals,</hi> &amp; other <hi>Oltramontaneous</hi> and <hi>Oltramarine</hi> Nations as <hi>Italians</hi>) yet there are two seasons in the yeer, when there is exceeding concourse to wit, Spring and Autumn. In the Spring begins the solemnity, the day of the Conception of our Lord, and in Autumn the day of the birth of our Lady, and each solemnity continues for 3. Moneths, wherein each day the house of <hi>Loreto</hi> is repaired to by great multi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tudes of people, the greater part whereof go in companies with their Ensignes, having carryed before them a Crucifix with the Images of Saints. Every Company hath its own governors &amp; Priests who sing, &amp; the <hi>Donatives</hi> offered follow, which are of more or lesse valew ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to the quality of the Persons and their Devotions, which method of going &amp; singing praiers &amp; praises to God, excites great piety in the Pilgrims, and people who follow (though not in order) in infi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nite multitudes. When at a distance the Companies begin to see the Church (which is seated on a hill above the Fields) they inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nally are moved to devotion, and cast themselves upon the ground weeping for joy, saluting the Mother of God, and then pursue their journey, some renting their garments and putting on sackcloth, others beating themselves, and being beaten by others with many stripes on the nakedshoulders. In the mean time the Priests of <hi>Loreto,</hi> go to meet these Companies, introducing them into the Church, with solemn musick, Trumpets, and Bells, when they approach the dore the Companies again fall flat on the ground saluting the Virgin from the bottome of their hearts, with such zeal, that the beholders are moved to tears.</p>
                  <p>
                     <pb n="127" facs="tcp:62973:76"/>Arrived at the Chamber of the Virgin, which shines most clear by the many lights brought in their hands, they contemplate the Effi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gies of the <hi>Madonna,</hi> with such Piety, Tears, Sighs, and humility, as is wonderfull, and many affix them selves so much to consider the place and Actions which the Mother of Christ there performed, that were they not driven out by other companies who overtake them, they would never remove thence, but such as come from far Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>treys, not being able to preserve the order of Companies, resort thither in the best manner they can, the most part if not all commu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nicate there, and leave their offerings at the Altar, but the most pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cious offerings are consigned to the deputies, whose charge is to set them and the givers names down in a Book, for perpetual remem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brance. The Altar erected by the Apostles, and the effigies of the Virgin <hi>Mary,</hi> are alwaies clothed from time to time with sumptuous garments, aud ornaments of great valew both in Gold and Jemms.</p>
                  <p>The Church is alwaies full with wax lights and Lamps burning, resounding with musick and Organs, but what more imports tis filled with the Spirit of God, which terrifies the bad, rejoices the good, heals the infirm, and works stupendious miracles. The number of the Pilgrims at <hi>Easter</hi> useth to be 12000. and at the <hi>Penticost</hi> and nativity of the Virgin not much inferiour if not more, there hath been the day of the said Nativity in our times, and the day following above two hundred thousand Persons which hath necessitated the intendents, to make a rail round about the Cel whereby to exclude and admit whom they think fit, that they may not be opprest by Multitude. Moreover because in all times the Companies of Souldiers inten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding for the Wars resort thither first to confess and communicate, the Road is so well accommodated with Inns and houses of Reception, that any Person though delicate and weak, may make the journey on foot, besides that the continual concourse of fresh companies to and fro, renders the way less heavy; this convenience invited <hi>M. Antonio Colonna</hi> (not to speak of others) a famous, rich, and great Commander, to take that Journey on foot. These Companies ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving seen the countenance of the Virgin, rejoyce spiritually, and com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monly acknowlege they have gathered great benefit from the Pilgri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mage though difficult. Were it not too long &amp; difficult twere worth ones pains to recount the vowes there made, and rendred to God, how many there escape out of the mire of Sin, how many are there loosed from the intricate tyes of carnal and forbidden pleasures, how many there lay down their hatred and old envy, how many men al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>most desperate to do more good, and bound already to the Gates of hell by compact between them and the Divel, yet there deliver them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves from the Enemy, and recover a state of Salvation; finally, as the Soul is more pretious than the Body, so the Miracles of the bles<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed Virgin of <hi>Loreto</hi> wrought for the Soul, are more than those that are for the Body, so that to discourse more at large the things tou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ched here, were a desire to measure and confine the divine power by humane frailty. Which to avoid, tis better to let it alone, than un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dertaking it to rest unsatisfied, and although for the most part Fame surpasseth the thing spoken of; yet whoever hath seen <hi>Loreto,</hi> must confess Fame could not speak so much of it and its glory as he there saw and contemplated.</p>

                     <p>The same <hi>Livy</hi> affirms, that the City was first called <hi>Nequino,</hi> and the Inhabitants thence <hi>Nequinati,</hi> when subdued by the <hi>Romans,</hi> from the paultry and wicked customes of the People, but afterwards the <hi>Roman</hi> Colony despising that name, called it <hi>Narni</hi> from the Rivers name.</p>
                     <p>The Triumphs in the <hi>Campidoglio</hi> set forth that the <hi>Nequinati</hi> were confederate with the <hi>Sanniti,</hi> and with them overcome by <hi>M. Petinus</hi> the Consul, who therefor triumphed in the 454th. yeer of <hi>Rome,</hi> and then made a Colony as aforesaid.</p>
                     <p>Now the Cities form is long, and fair in Fabricks, and plentifully supplyed from its near <hi>Campagna,</hi> though in the memory of our Ancestors, and since it hath been much turmoyled with troubles and Warrs. Without <hi>Narni</hi> over the River are wonderfull great Arches of a Bridge, which did conjoyn two high and precipitous Mountains be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween which the River passed, some believe this Bridge was built by <hi>Augustus</hi> with the spoils of the <hi>Siacambri,</hi> and <hi>Procopius</hi> affirms it, ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding that more eminent Arches were never seen, the Reliques now appearing demonstrate it the work of a flourishing Empire, and of excessive expence, <hi>Martial</hi> tis supposed speaks herof in these words.
<q>

                     <p>The stones of this Bridge are cecmented with Iron and Lead, one Arch now to be seen is 200. foot broad and 150. foot high, under which tis said is buried great Treasure.</p>

of the Archiepiscopal Ornaments, that is a Cross and Pall: and the Canons are faculted to bear the Priests cope, and purple Sattin robes, and the Mitre of white Sattin, <hi>More Cardinalium,</hi> and the Bishop is so great, that the Canons acknowledge no other Superiour but the Apostolick Sea.</p>
                     <p>Among the many graces wherewith this Church is favoured by the most high God, some may especially be considered; first that <hi>Luc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ca</hi> was the first City of <hi>Tuscany,</hi> that (as <hi>Fr. Leandro</hi> and others re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count) received the light of the holy faith, which happened in the 44th. yeer of our Salvation, by the means of Saint <hi>Paulino Antiocheno,</hi> the Disciple of Saint <hi>Peter,</hi> crowned a Martyr upon the hill <hi>S. Iulia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>no,</hi> by <hi>Anozino</hi> President in <hi>Pisa.</hi> Secondly, that in the time of <hi>Charles</hi> the Great, with most singular favour it obtained the holy Counte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nance or Visage, (<hi>Volto Santo</hi>) formed and placed miraculously by a divine hand, on the venerable Statue of the Saviour of the World: framed by <hi>Nichodemus</hi> his Disciple, when he stood as 'twere bereaved of senses, with consulting to form the head with such perfection as might give honour to the Statue.</p>
                     <p>In it lie the bodies of <hi>S. Paolino, Rigolo</hi> and <hi>Frediano.</hi> Its principal Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tectors, with those of 33. other Saints, whereof 14. were <hi>Lucchesi.</hi> In the yeer 1588. was found here a Miraculous Image of our Lady, through whose mediation God hath here done wonderfull graces to the faithfull of divers Nations. It hath afforded Popes, Cardinals, Lords, and famous Captains in great numbers with exquisite Sho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lars: whereof one must be mentioned, to wit Fryer <hi>Panigni,</hi> having so great a renown through all parts of the world for his elaborate and exact Translation of the holy Scripture out of the Hebrew into the Latin Tongue, whom we will set alone though many others in seve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral Sciences, Qualities, and Honours might be well remembred with him. Many noble Families quitted this their Countrey, either to avoid the plagues, or tyrannies of Usurpers, and retreated to <hi>Venice</hi> and <hi>Genoua,</hi> where some of them are in that honour as to be admitted Partners in the government of those States as if originally of those Republiques.</p>
                     <p>The Territories of <hi>Lucca</hi> are small, but through the Industry of the Inhabitants, most fertile and abounding in all things, and so well peopled, that they have eighteen thousand Men enrolled in the Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>litia, besides those of the City: In them lies those so health, affor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding Bathes, celebrated by many Historians and other writers, whi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther annually resort from all parts infinite infirm and Lame Persons, who for the most part return comforted and recovered: In the way whereunto they pass two Bridges over the River <hi>Serchio,</hi> whose Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ches are so large that they are wonderfull to the beholders: And tis certain all <hi>Europe</hi> cannot shew two Bridges so noble and fair.</p>
                     <p>Many other remarkable things might be inserted of this most no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble City and its State, but to avoid prolixity, and pursue the stile be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gun, the more curious are referred to the particular writers who treat thereof most copiously.</p>

Its ayr is good, though somewhat enclineing to hot and dry tis built in part upon hills and in part upon a Plain or Level. On the Maritine part Westward, It hath a Port may well merit the name of the most importent of <hi>Italy.</hi> It enjoyes the Treasure of Liberty, and is governed in form of a Republique, all its state being content with that form, knowing that to the obedient Life Honour and Goods, under that government are in no hazard. It stands be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween two Rivers the one on the East 70. miles long, the other on the West a 100. In the River on the <hi>Levant</hi> about 6. miles from the City is the comely Town of <hi>Mervi,</hi> which plentifully stores it with Fruits and Flowers all the Winter. Tis Mistress and sole Governess of the Island of <hi>Corsica,</hi> whence in time of need they can advance a good quantity of Souldiers not inferiour in Arms or Valour to any other Nation. The People of <hi>Corsia</hi> most willingly yeelding them Obe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dience, for their protection, and that costs them but a quarter of a Crown annually for each fire, and some other incensible tax. Every two yeers the Republique sends thither a Governour and the other Lawgivers and Judges, who haviug finished their Offices, are arraign<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed by two Gentlemen impowred thither to that effect, who without any trouble to the subject, do them justice against any Governour or Judge at their own doors, who hath done them wrong: Which rule they also observe through all other parts of their state. On all part of the City are infinite pleasant Gardens and Pallaces beautified with all that Art can add to them or Riches procure their Structures being <hi>alla Moderna</hi> though somewhat high in most parts by reason that the City is but small, so that they are necessitated to make the best use of their Room which renders the streets in most places narrow and in some a little obscure. Though one street may be well termed the Mistress of the World called <hi>Strada Nova,</hi> being spatious, long, even, and on each side embellished with most stately Marble Pallaces, the fairest whereof belongs to the Duke of <hi>Oria.</hi> It hath a most spatious Port in form of a Theatre compassed in with noble Structures, which though defended by a most magnificent Mole (judged the greatest in Christendome) yet is when the South and Southwest Winds blow very tempestuous. Opposite to it is a <hi>Pharos</hi> bearing a Lanthern (for light to ships in the night time) of an extraordinary bigness. <hi>Darsina</hi> is a haven to it also, which is a sure retreat for Galleys and shipping at all seasons: The Galleys being there layed up in their several clas<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sis. For publick Edifices it hath the Merchants Hall. The publick Granaries the Dukes Pallace with the Armory of 30000. Men. And their Churches which though (in respect of others of <hi>Italy</hi>) they have not so much Beauty, that once seen they yeeld a <hi>Gusto</hi> to a second view, yet for their polisht Marble and inward Ornaments, were they placed any where but in <hi>Italy</hi> might well merit a larger Account.

                  <p>
                     <hi>ROME</hi> formerly the Empress of the World cannot be enough praised: Her power was so great, her Riches so immense, her subjects so innumerable, her Territories and Dominions so vast: That well might Saint <hi>Hierome</hi> (in his three wishes for intermixing that concerning her with so divine things) be pardonable, which three wishes were, To have seen our Saviour in the flesh, to have heard Saint <hi>Paul</hi> preach, and to have seen <hi>Rome</hi> in her Glory: which had so spread her self over the whole Earth that a perfect <hi>Idea</hi> of her cannot be comprehended, and must needs have been the happiest sight that mortal eye could attain to. But when considered what she was, and how since devoured by fire by the insatiable <hi>Nero,</hi> and how pillaged sacked and thousands of mischiefs done her by the Barba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rous, at the decay of the <hi>Roman</hi> Empire; One may well wonder how the new <hi>Rome,</hi> should be even emulous to exceed the Old: Being at this day the Queen of Cities, the Flower of <hi>Italy,</hi> and as one may say an Epitome of the whole Earth. She is the Lodging for all Nati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons. The theatre of the best Ingenuities of the World, the Habitation of vertue, of Empire, of dignity, of Fortune, The Native Countrey of the Laws, and of all People derivatively, the Fountain of In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>struction, the Head of Religion, the Rule of Justice, and finally the Original of infinite blessings, although the Hereticks, Enemies of the truth, will not confess it, as this Author is pleased to term those of the Reformed Religion.</p>
                  <p>A Better nor more concise description of the glory and destructi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of <hi>Rome</hi> the Old cannot be given than is in these two Verses out of an elegant Poet an English Man.<note place="margin">Stapylton</note>

                  <p>That dedicated to the Sun by <hi>Augustus</hi> in <hi>Circo Maximo,</hi> being drawn out of the Ruines among which twas buried, was translated with infinite expence to the <hi>porta Flaminia</hi> and raised before the Church <hi>S Maria del Popolo</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Besides the abovenamed, divers other Obelisks and Pyramides are yet extant in <hi>Rome,</hi> but all of small value, except that which was newly erected in the <hi>Piazza Novana</hi> by Innocent the X which is admirable<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
                  </p>
                  <p>We gather from the writers of Antiquity that formerly there were many more Obelisks in <hi>Rome</hi> then at present appear. <hi>Pliny</hi> the time of <hi>Vespasian</hi> names many of them. <hi>Ammianus Marcellinus</hi> the contemporary with <hi>Iulian</hi> the Emperour sets down more, but <hi>P. Vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctor</hi> commemorates to the number of 42. treating of the less. <hi>Andrea Fulvius, Pietrus, Angelus, Burgeus Pigafetta,</hi> and <hi>Michael Mercato,</hi> in the la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tine and vulgar tongue give thereof most ample accounts.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Augustus Caesar</hi> transmitted two Obelisks from <hi>AEgypt</hi> to <hi>Rome,</hi> at the time he overcame <hi>Marc Anthony</hi> and <hi>Cleopatra,</hi> and <hi>Publius Victor,</hi> re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ckons seaven more conveighed thither afterwards. One whereof was placed in the Gardens of <hi>Salustius,</hi> which took up all the space and the vale from the Church <hi>Santa Susanna</hi> to the <hi>Porta Collina:</hi> This (they say) was consecrated to the Moon, and carved with <hi>Egyptian</hi> Characters, What vast Vessels were built for conveighing these <hi>Pliny</hi> and <hi>Ammianus</hi> discourse at large, and one they say had 300 mariners in her. Now let us speak of those Obelisks that are marked with <hi>AEgyptian</hi> Characters: That of Saint <hi>Peter</hi> and <hi>Santa Maria maggiore</hi> being without such.</p>
                  <p>The Obelisk before Saint <hi>Giovanni Laterano,</hi> all over engraved with Hieroglyphicks was brought as asoresaid by <hi>Constantine</hi> the great out of <hi>AEgypt</hi> into <hi>Alexandria</hi> and erected in <hi>Constantinople,</hi> and thence by <hi>Constantius</hi> his son in an immense Galley wherein were 300 Rowers at the Oar, to <hi>Rome</hi> and by him placed in the <hi>Circo Maximo:</hi> which <hi>Sixtus</hi> the 5th. <hi>anno</hi> 1588 with incredible expence removed to Saint <hi>Giovanni Laterano</hi> where the Popes used formerly to inhabit. A second he removed from the <hi>Circo Massimo</hi> to <hi>Santa Maria Maggi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ore</hi> formerly Consecrated to the Sun:</p>
                  <p>The third in the Vineyard of the great Duke of <hi>Tuscany,</hi> filled with Hyerogliphicks: tis but small but tis thought stood in the <hi>Campo Martio,</hi> in the time of <hi>Tarquine</hi> the proud.</p>
                  <p>The fourth less than the former was transferred from the <hi>Campi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>doglio,</hi> by <hi>Ciriaco Mattei,</hi> and stands in the Vineyard of the <hi>Mattaei</hi> who had it of the gift of the Senat and people of <hi>Rome:</hi> this hath some small Images on the top only; the others all over.</p>
                  <p>There is another lying in the <hi>Via Appia,</hi> near the Sepulchre of <hi>Ce<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cilia Metella</hi> broke in 3 several pieces: which (tis much admired)

                     </gap>est: nor is it to be believed but that he would have done it, had not death inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rupted this and his other designes. One other smaller Obelisk stands near the Jesuits Colledge.</p>
                  <p>Tis admirable that upon all those Hierogls<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> &amp; Obelisks the sign of the Cross is figured: which might happen, either for that the <hi>AEgyptians</hi> through some mistery honoured the Cross, or for that they might have had some relation touching it from their Ancestors, and yet without knowing the signification. At the time when by the Emperour <hi>The<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>odosius</hi> his command all the Idols of <hi>AEgypt</hi> were destroyed, On the Breast of <hi>Serapis</hi> was found the sign of the Cross, whereof the signification being enquired into, the Priests skilled in the sacred misteries of the <hi>AEgyptians</hi> declared, that they understood by it the Life to come after death here: which could not portend other, than the eternal beatitude whereto our Saviour by his death on the Cross opened the way. Thus <hi>Socrates</hi> the writer of the Ecclesiastick Histo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries in his 5th. Book 27th. Chap. recounts, as also do <hi>Russino, Georgio Cedreno,</hi> and <hi>Suida,</hi> in their writings. We must observe that the pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nishment by the Cross in those dayes common to Malefactors was ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken away by <hi>Constantine</hi> the Emperour a true Christian, through his Reverence of our Saviours death: who in lieu thereof constituted the Gallows, as divers Authors relate: Which Emperour also pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hibited by a severe Law, the conculcating any Cross upon the Earth Let thus much serve touching the Obelisks of <hi>Rome,</hi> if the Reader be curious to search into those in <hi>Constantinople</hi> and other places (the discourse whereof is not to our purpose) let him peruse the treati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ses of <hi>Michael Mercato, Pietro Bellonio,</hi> and <hi>Pietro Gillio,</hi> upon this subject.</p>
                  <p>In <hi>Rome</hi> also are 3 famous Collumnes: one Called <hi>Rostrata</hi> in the <hi>Cam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pidoglio</hi> erected by C. <hi>Duilio,</hi> after the <hi>Carthaginians</hi> were overcome in the <hi>Punick</hi> War.

                  <p>WE will begin from the <hi>Vatican,</hi> chiefly in favour of those who come from <hi>Tuscany</hi> to <hi>Rome,</hi> entring by the <hi>Porta Vaticata,</hi> near the Castle Saint <hi>Angelo.</hi> Here ly the Meadowes and fields of <hi>Quinti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>us</hi> or as others say of <hi>Pincius</hi> at this day called <hi>Prata</hi> a lovely and pleasant place, whither the youth usually resort for Recrea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion.</p>
                  <p>The <hi>Porta Elia,</hi> called vulgarly <hi>di Castello</hi> leads to <hi>Adrians</hi> Mole, A vast Pile which he raised for the burying place for himself and the <hi>Antonini,</hi> being large and strong, but at present better accomodated than in his time, for that the Popes have made it a Fortress for their own retreat and security, in time of imminent danger of Enemies, to which a long Gallery under Ground leads from the Palace of St. <hi>Peter,</hi> for their more convenient and safe passage. Heretofore One <hi>Cresentinus</hi> made himself Lord of it by force of Arms and of the Ci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty also: but at present the Popes possess it, and cal it <hi>Castel</hi> St. <hi>An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gelo,</hi> from the Marble statue of an Angel with a sword in his hand sett on the top of it, which <hi>Alexander</hi> the 7th. augmented and fortified in ample manner as by the Inscription on the Bridge may be understood. In it are kept the three millions of Gold, which may not be imployed on any use but defence of the Apostolick state in point of Arms. The Marbles, Collumnes, and Statues formerly there, were conveighed to the <hi>Vatican,</hi> and placed in the Church of Saint <hi>Peter,</hi> and the Papal Palace, and nothing of Antiquity left behind but the structure, and two heads, the one of <hi>Adrian</hi> the Em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perour armed, the other of <hi>Pallas,</hi> with some inscriptions on the walls, which notwithstanding, tis yet most worthy observation. Here stands the <hi>Ponte</hi> or Bridge <hi>Elio,</hi> so called for that <hi>Elius Adrianus</hi> the Emperour built it for his Sepulchre: but at present tis called <hi>Ponte di Castello,</hi> on either side of it stand the statues of the Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stles Saint <hi>Peter</hi> and Saint <hi>Paul,</hi> wrought with excelling Workman<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ship under Pope <hi>Clement</hi> the 7th. at the time that the <hi>Tyber</hi> grown beyond its usual limits, overflowed to the great devastation of the City and this Bridge in <hi>anno</hi> 1530. Being upon this Bridge, you may see opposite to you the Hospital of <hi>Santo Spirito,</hi> and the Ruines of the triumphal Bridge, which was so denominated, for that over it were lead the Pompes of Triumphs as the way to the <hi>Campido<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>glio.</hi>

                  <p>All that part of the <hi>Vatican</hi> hill between the Bridge and the Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lace is now called <hi>Borgo,</hi> but was formerly named <hi>la selva</hi> because be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore the time of Pope <hi>Alexander</hi> the second the <hi>Vatican</hi> Grove grew there, wherein was erected a Pyramide for the Sepulchre of <hi>Scipio Af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fricanus,</hi> whereof some reliques may yet be seen in that part of the

At the end of the <hi>Parione</hi> are the ample houses <hi>Arianae,</hi> in whose Angle is seated That Statue of <hi>Pasquin,</hi> the most famous of all that City yea of all the World. This some suppose to be made for <hi>Hercules,</hi> others for <hi>Alexander</hi> the great: but there is no certainty of either, though it appear the workemankip of some rare Artist.</p>
                  <p>In former times they were wont to load this Image with Libels a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>against the Princes, Cardinals and famous Men, and noble Matrons and sometimes against the Pope: but now left off because of the se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vere prohibitions, since when though they dare not fix them to the <hi>Pasquino,</hi> yet still they vent their reproofs and scandals under some other specious pretence, publishing them some other way by the name of <hi>Pasquinata. Antonio Tibaldeo a Ferrarian,</hi> being no less learned than Venerable, reports this story of this statue: That there was in <hi>Rome</hi> a certain Taylour well known in his trade and good at his oc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cupation, called <hi>Pasquino,</hi> whose shop stood in this street: this man was well customed by <hi>Prelates, Courtezans</hi> and other people, who resorted to him for their Rayments, This Taylor employed great number of Journeymen, who like vile persons spent all the day their tongues freely speaking ill of this &amp; that person not sparing a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny, taking occasion from what they observed in those persons which resorted to their shop; the constant custome of slandering in that shop made it become ridiculous even to the persons offended, e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>steeming those rascals unworthy of any credit, and so no other re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gard was had to it. Whence it came to pass afterwards, that if any person would defame another he did it under covert of Master <hi>Pas<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quino,</hi> saying he had heard say so in his shop, which relation caused all the Interessed persons in that reproach, not to make any more ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count of it. This reverent gentleman <hi>Pasquino</hi> being dead, it hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pened that in paving the street, this statue was found half buried and broken near his shop, which because twas incomodious for the passage to leave it there, they erected just at the shop of Master <hi>Pas<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quino<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
                     </hi> whence the back-biters (taking a good occasion) reported that Master <hi>Pasquino,</hi> was returned again and not having courage e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nough to own the abuses they put upon others, they used to fasten their Scrolls to that statue: presuming, that as twas lawfull for <hi>Mar co pasquino</hi> to speak any thing, so by means of this statue they might scandalize others with such things, as in the light and bare faced they durst not own. This Custome continued long till at last twas prohibited with severe penalties.</p>

As the Pictures of <hi>Francesco Salviati,</hi> and <hi>Tadeo Zucchero,</hi> both which are much applauded, drawn as if they were taking the fresh ayr: And in a Gallery which is as noble as well painted by the Brothers <hi>Carazzi Bolonia,</hi> painters of great Fame, you will find many antient heads of signal persons as of <hi>Lysia, Euripides, Solon, Socrates, Diogenes, Genone, Possidonio,</hi> and <hi>Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neca,</hi> with the noble statues of <hi>Ganimede, Antinoo,</hi> of <hi>Bacchus,</hi> some fair Vessels, and the statues of <hi>Meleager,</hi> which deserves a name by it self for its great price, being esteemed worth five thousand Crowns then which no statue in <hi>Rome</hi> is more entire. No People under the Sun give so great prices for statues as the <hi>Romans:</hi> all which are so studious of those kind of Ornaments, that in acquiring them, they emulously strive which shall exceed in cost or curiosity. In one Cham<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber they shew the Duke <hi>Alexander</hi> of glorious memory, having un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der his feet the River <hi>Scalda</hi> or <hi>Scelda,</hi> with <hi>Flanders</hi> kneeling before him, and behind Victory crowning him, all which statues are cut out of one Marble stone, bigger than the Life. There also are three doggs cast rarely in Brass. The <hi>Bibliotheque</hi> of this Pallace, the Meddals and carved Toyes, are most famous things, but the Pictures of <hi>Raphael,</hi> and <hi>Titian</hi> are incomparable, nor are the Limnings lesse admira<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>

                  <p>Adjacent to the <hi>Campo di Fiore,</hi> stands the Palace of the Cardinal <hi>Capo di Ferro,</hi> much less than the <hi>Farnesian</hi> Pallace, but in splendor and Architecture no whit inferiour. In the Frontispiece is painted the spring time: The President of the spring is <hi>Venus,</hi> (which was drawn to the similitude of the Body of <hi>Livia Columna,</hi> a most beautiful Princess) &amp; whatever is there represented is amorous: The Complex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ion of the men is sanguine, and all are marked with the Element of Ayr. So in the other fronts, are expressed the complexions Chol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ler, Melancholy, and Phlegme, the Elements Fire, Water, and Earth, the seasons Summer, Autumne, and Winter, and the Prae<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>siding Gods, <hi>Mars, Saturn,</hi> and <hi>Janus,</hi> which are most absolutely performed, and were the work of <hi>Michael Angelo,</hi> with whom this Cardinal contracted a most intimate Friendship; and being no less liberal than Jngenious obtained of him, what ever so rare an Artist could possibly invent, among the rest a secret conclave wherein ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny things are exprest with the highest Art and perfection.</p>
                  <p>The house of the <hi>Orsini,</hi> in the <hi>Campo di Fiore,</hi> which was raised out of the ruines of the <hi>Pompeyan</hi> Theatre, is embellisht with many good statues in the Courts.</p>
                  <p>The Temple of Saint <hi>Angelo</hi> in <hi>Pescaria,</hi> was formerly of <hi>Juno Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gina,</hi> which being burnt, was restored by <hi>Septimius Severus</hi> and <hi>Mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cus Aurelius</hi> the Emperors, as the old Title there to be read verifies: near which are some of the Pillars taken from the <hi>Portico</hi> of <hi>Septimius Severus</hi> dedicated to <hi>Mercury.</hi>

                  <p>At the Tower <hi>Citrangole,</hi> stands the house of the heirs of <hi>Gentile Delfino,</hi> which Gentleman had more meddals than any other Person in <hi>Rome,</hi> and his Garden filled with inscriptions: In them stands a Statue of <hi>Canopo</hi> placed in the form of a Water Pott, before whose breast they have preposed a Tablet filled with <hi>Hierogliphick</hi> letters, by which tis believed the secret Mysteries of the Sacrifices are delivered: In <hi>Parione</hi> at the house of the <hi>Maximi</hi> may be seen a <hi>Colossus,</hi> which vul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>garly is thought to be the statue of <hi>Pyrrhus</hi> King of the <hi>Epirots</hi> armed, bought a long time since by the <hi>Maximi</hi> of <hi>Angelo</hi> for two thousand Crowns as also a Marble head of <hi>Julius Caesar,</hi> with many other things worthy consideration.</p>
                  <p>In the house of the <hi>Leni alla Ciambella,</hi> are many noble statues late<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly brought thither from the <hi>Porta di S.

Near which stands the house of Cardinal <hi>Paravicino,</hi> a Sig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nor of noble Qualities, who much delights in Pictures, whereof and those good too he hath not a few. Contiguous with which stands the house of the <hi>Vallei,</hi> wherein was erected a square Marble stone, with a <hi>Solar Horoscope,</hi> and the <hi>Zodiack</hi> signes, where the dayes and howers of every Moneth were denoted, and whatever the Antients were wont to observe as well in the sacrifices of the Gods, as in the Countrey affairs, as fully as our Calenders now express them: but this with divers other Rarities, by the instability of its Patrons, were amo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved, and such as they left remaining (for what reason we guess not) obscured.

On the Ascent of the <hi>Campidoglio</hi> dwels <hi>il Signor Lelio Pasqualino,</hi> a Canon of <hi>Santa Maria Maggiore,</hi> a Gentleman of polite learning, and exquisite manners, where the studious of Antiquities are freely ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitted to glutt themselves with the most curious things in <hi>Rome,</hi> as select Meddals, rare carved works, Implements, and <hi>Habiliments</hi> of Antiquity in great number. In summ in his house are a Treasure of those things, and he hath observed in this kind more than a man can possibly behold in one day: if he be resolved to publish his ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>servations for the pnblick good of the <hi>Ingeniosi,</hi> tis certain that a pure and naked index of the Antiquities which he hath collected, would alone advance the studious of good Letters no less in sacred then Profane Learning.</p>
                  <p>On the left hand of the <hi>Campidoglio,</hi> raises it self a Temple and the Monastery of the <hi>Franciscans</hi> called <hi>Araceli,</hi> to which they ascend by 124 marble steps distinguished into five degrees: The Temple is supported by two ranks of Marble Pillars on both sides, then which the world affords not a more sumptuous, the <hi>Vatican</hi> set apart: This Temple in old time was dedicated to <hi>Jovi Feretrio</hi> by <hi>Romulus</hi> after the <hi>Sabyn</hi> warr, because in that place <hi>Jupiter</hi> gave assistance to the King then oppressed with the violence of his Enemies. On the left hand upon the third Pillar is engraven these words <hi>A Cubiculo Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gustorum,</hi> and in other places of the Church, are two statues of <hi>Constantine</hi> and <hi>Maximinian,</hi> and at the two horses of <hi>Castori</hi> set at the top of the steps, is represented a fair prospective from the en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trance to the inward part.</p>
                  <p>In the <hi>Piazza</hi> of the <hi>Campidoglio,</hi> stands a great statue of <hi>Marcus Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>relius Antoninus,</hi> or as others think of <hi>Lucius Verus,</hi> of <hi>Septimius,</hi> of <hi>Metellus</hi> on horseback, twas transferred hither from <hi>San Gio Latera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>no,</hi> by order of Pope <hi>Paul</hi> the third a <hi>Farnesian.</hi>

                  <p>Being entred into the Hall of the said Pallace, you behold the lof<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty seats (so famous through the world) of the Magistrates and the <hi>Ro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man</hi> Triumphs: These were translated hither from the Court where they were found by Commission of <hi>Paul</hi> the 3d. that they might be viwed and considered: Upon the subject of those seats now somewhat decayed and broken through Age, Cardinal <hi>Michele Silvio</hi> composed certain smooth verses there to be read, Where also you find an honourable memorial in marble of the deeds of the most illustrious <hi>Alexander Farnese,</hi> Son of <hi>Ottavio</hi> Duke of <hi>Parma,</hi> whose statue stands in the same place, as also that of <hi>M Antonio Colonna,</hi> who together with <hi>Giovanni d'Austria,</hi> obtained a glorious victory on the Sea against the <hi>Turks</hi> in the <hi>Cursolari:</hi> Together with some great statues of Popes, in a sitting posture as twere giving Benediction to the People as of <hi>Leo</hi> the 10th. <hi>Gregory</hi> the 13th. <hi>Sixtus</hi> the 5th. all well deservers of the Christian Republique; and other things giv<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing delight to the Spectator.</p>

                     <p>Towards <hi>Santa Maria Nova, Scaurus</hi> had a noble Palace with an Open gallery supported with Pillars forty foot high without the ba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ses or capitol.</p>
                     <p>The great Palace <hi>Gregostaci,</hi> was so denominated, for that there they usually entertained the Embassadors of divers Nations: Here <hi>Quintus Flaminius</hi> dedicated a statue to <hi>Concordia,</hi> when he had re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>conciled the People to the Senate, or rather the Senate to the Peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple. The Church <hi>Sant' Andrea,</hi> in <hi>Pallaria,</hi> is the old Temple, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in the <hi>Palladium</hi> and <hi>Penati,</hi> which <hi>AEneas</hi> brought with him from <hi>Troy</hi> into <hi>Italy</hi> were at first placed, but afterwards transported into the Temple of <hi>Vesta,</hi> and the charge of them committed to the Vestal Virgins.

                     <p>On that part of the <hi>Palatine</hi> towards <hi>Monte Celio,</hi> stood a Temple of <hi>Cibele</hi> called also <hi>Dindimene</hi> and <hi>Ope,</hi> The Image of which God<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dess was translated from <hi>Ida</hi> a Place in <hi>Phrygia</hi> to <hi>Rome,</hi> and reve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>renced with great devotion.

Others think them to haue been the stews wherein the Whores dwelt, exposing their bodies to sale for gaine. <hi>Neptune</hi> had a Temple conjoined with this Circ, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of some ruines are yet to be seen incrusted with Fish shels. Where the Church of <hi>S.

Tis suppo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed that <hi>Sixtus</hi> the 5th. would have reared this as he did others had not death shortned his days.</p>
                     <p>Above the Circ riseth an entire Temple four squared, with Pil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lars, and Corridores before it: Which as is supposed was dedica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted to the <hi>Dio Ridicolo,</hi> uppon this occasion: <hi>Hannibal</hi> having slain 40 thousand Romans at the battail of <hi>Cannae,</hi> marched with his vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctorious Army to the siege of <hi>Rome,</hi> and pitched his Camp in that very place: where a diffused Laughter being heard over his Camp it caused a prodigious fear, and that made him raise the Siege and retreat to the <hi>Terra di Lavoro:</hi> which had he obstinatly continued some time longer, (having created such a consternation in the Citi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zens) he had undoubtedly taken <hi>Rome</hi> with small difficulty: but as <hi>Livy</hi> saies an <hi>Affrican</hi> told <hi>Hannibal,</hi> He knew how to obtain but not how to make use of Victory. Thus was <hi>Rome</hi> delivered from <hi>Hanni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bal:</hi> and the <hi>Romans</hi> in commemoration of so great a benefit received from the God of Laughter, consecrated that Temple to the <hi>Dio Ridicoloso.</hi>

                     <p>The Arches which enter the City by <hi>Porta Nevia,</hi> and pass over the top of the <hi>Celio,</hi> to the <hi>Aventino,</hi> were the Arches for the Aqueduct of the <hi>Claudian</hi> water: and were the highest and longest of <hi>Rome, Claudius</hi> conveighed this water from forty miles off into the City; Some of this water run into the Palace, some into the <hi>Campidoglio,</hi> but the greatest part to the <hi>Aventino:</hi> The said <hi>Porta Nevia,</hi> was also called <hi>Nevia,</hi> and <hi>Santa Croce</hi> and was built in an Arch Triumphal, which demonstrates the Majesty and grandeur of the work.</p>

                     <p>In the return you meet that stupendious and admirable Mole the Amphitheatre, called vulgarly <hi>Coliseo</hi> from the <hi>Colossean</hi> statue of 120 foot high, which <hi>Nero</hi> erected.

                     <p>The house of <hi>Nero</hi> occupying all that space between the Hils <hi>Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>latino</hi> and <hi>Celio,</hi> reached to the <hi>Esquilie,</hi> so ample that it had more the face and semblance of a City, than of a single house, within were com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prehended Fields, Lakes, Woods, and a Gallery of a mile long, with three ranks of Pillars, many of its Chambers were guilt and ador<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned with gems: and the Temple dedicated to <hi>Fortuna Seia,</hi> had in it an Image of the same Goddesse of transparent Mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble.</p>
                     <p>On the left hand stands the Arch Triumphal of <hi>Constantine</hi> the Great, as yet whole and perfect with all his victories and statues car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved on it.

among others the statue of <hi>Seneca,</hi> the Philosopher and the Vestry and Chapel of the Duke, clear demonstrations of the piety and religion of the Patrones. Near it stands the house of Cardinal <hi>Gae<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tano</hi> containing some rare Antique statues.</p>

                        <hi>L'Esquilie,</hi> was so called because in the time of <hi>Romulus</hi> the Sentinels were placed there, this hill is severed from the <hi>Celio,</hi> by the <hi>Via Lavicana</hi> from the <hi>Viminale</hi> by the <hi>Vico Patritio.</hi> The <hi>Via Tiburtina,</hi> as abovesaid (crosseth it in the midst which way ascends from the Suburb to the <hi>Porta Nevia,</hi> but before it comes to the trophees of <hi>Marius</hi> tis cut in two, the right hand way leads towards <hi>San Giovanni Laterano,</hi> conjoy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning with the <hi>Lavicana,</hi> the left goes to the <hi>Porta di San Lorenzo</hi> by the name of <hi>Prenestina.</hi>

                     <p>In the <hi>Via Nomentana</hi> a little farther is the <hi>Ponte Nomentano</hi> built by <hi>Narsetes</hi> the Eunuch under <hi>Justinian</hi> the Emperor, as the inscription testifies. <hi>Nero</hi> the Emperour, between the <hi>Porta Suburbana,</hi> and <hi>Sala<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ria,</hi> had <hi>Suburbano</hi> a singular edifice, which he gave to a Freed Man who fearinga publique punishment by a poynard thrust into his brest and the help of <hi>Sporo</hi> another freed Man slew himself: some ruines of this Fabrick yet remain.</p>

                     <p>In the descent from the <hi>Quirinale,</hi> towards the <hi>Foro</hi> of <hi>Nerva</hi> a high Tower presents it self, which is vulgarly called <hi>Torre Mezza,</hi> which tis believed was one part of the house of <hi>Maecenas,</hi> adjoyning whereunto were his delicious Gardens, whereto <hi>Augustus Caesar</hi> fre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quently withdrew himself from his more weighty affairs to recreate himself with his Friend, and to revive his toyled Spirits. Others believe it to be a part of the Temple dedicated by <hi>Marcus Aurelius</hi> to the Sunne.</p>

                  <p>FRom the Bourg taking the way over <hi>Ponte Elio,</hi> you up against the streams of the Tyber meet the Church <hi>San Biasio,</hi> at <hi>Ripetta,</hi> which is supposed to have been the Temple of <hi>Neptune,</hi> amplified by <hi>Adrian</hi> the Emperor: here such as had escaped any re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>markable shipwrack, hung up Tablets containing the particulars of their deliverance and their vows for it to the God of the Sea.</p>
                  <p>In the <hi>Valle Martia,</hi> by the Church of <hi>San Rocco</hi> stands the <hi>Mau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>seolo,</hi> of <hi>Augustus</hi> being a Sepulchre erected by <hi>Octavius</hi> for him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>self and she successors of the <hi>Caesarian</hi> Family, out of the ruins and with the Materials of that Amphitheatre (which he destroy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed) that <hi>Julius Cesar</hi> built there; its Circuit is yet entire divided into a figure four square lozanged. In this <hi>Mauseolo,</hi> stands a <hi>Matrona</hi> holding a <hi>Cornucopia</hi> with Fruit, and an <hi>AEsculapius</hi> as bigg as a Gyant with a Serpent.</p>
                  <p>In this <hi>Mauseolo,</hi> were also heretofore two Obelisks of <hi>Granito,</hi> 42 foot high.</p>
                  <p>The Circ of <hi>Julius Caesar,</hi> extended from this <hi>Mauseolo</hi> to the foot of the neighbouring Mountain, <hi>Augustus</hi> had a Palace opposite to it<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> with a stately Gallery, and had here consecrated a Grove to the Gods of Hell, reaching from the Church <hi>Santa Maria del Popolo</hi> to S. <hi>Trinita.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Some say that <hi>Marcellus</hi> his Sepulchre was contiguous with this <hi>Mauseolo,</hi> and shew its very <hi>Track:</hi> which <hi>Boisardo,</hi> believes rather to belong to the <hi>Mauseolo,</hi> and not a distinct Edifice.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Augustus</hi> also had made a place called <hi>Naumachia</hi> for Naval Diver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sions in the lower part of the <hi>Valle Martia,</hi> (looking towards the
<pb n="213" facs="tcp:62973:121"/>
Hill <hi>Santa Trinita</hi> which <hi>Domitian</hi> restored being decayed through antiquity, and called it after his own name, placing near it a Tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple to the Family <hi>Flavia:</hi> where now Saint <hi>Silvestro</hi> stands.</p>
                  <p>The <hi>Valle Martia<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
                     </hi> was so denominated, because twas the lowest Gate of the <hi>Campo Martio,</hi> and extended from the <hi>Tyber</hi> to the hills <hi>Santa Trinita,</hi> and from the Piazza of <hi>Domitian</hi> in the <hi>Via Flaminia</hi> to the <hi>Porta Flaminia.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>The <hi>Via Flaminia</hi> took its name from <hi>Flaminius</hi> the Consul, who paved it after the conquest of the <hi>Genovesi</hi> now tis called the <hi>Corso:</hi> for that at some time of the yeer, boys and certain animals run here striving who shall arrive first at the end of the course. This way goes from the <hi>Porta Flaminia</hi> (called heretofore <hi>Flumentana</hi> from its vicinity to the Tyber but at this day <hi>Porta del popolo</hi>) to <hi>Pesaro,</hi> and to <hi>Rimini.</hi> Near this way lye many gardens filled with inscriptions chiefly those of Cardinal <hi>Lovisio, Justiniano, Gallo, Altemps</hi> and o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers.</p>
                  <p>By this Way Pope <hi>Julius</hi> the third accomodated a Vineyard with such ornaments, as for cost and magnificence surpassed all others in <hi>Rome,</hi> and as an Inscription attests, conducted to the publik way a Fountain for the benefit of all persons, wherein tis scarce to be jud<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ged which ought most to be applauded, the ingenuity of the Arti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tificers, or the sumptuousness and splendour of the <hi>Roman</hi> Chief Bi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>shops.</p>
                  <p>Beyond this lies <hi>Ponte Molli.</hi> where the Tyrant <hi>Maxentius</hi> was over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come by <hi>Constantine</hi> the Great: which Tyrant that he might not be carried alive in the Triumphs of <hi>Constantine</hi> cast himself headlong off the Bridge into the <hi>Tyber.</hi> Afterwards in honour of <hi>Constantine</hi> was erected the Triumphal Arch between the <hi>Coliseo</hi> and the <hi>Setti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zonio</hi> of <hi>Severus.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Returned into the City by the <hi>Porta Flaminia</hi> you find the Arch of <hi>Domitian,</hi> called <hi>di Portogallo,</hi> because in that quarter the Embas<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sador of <hi>Portugall</hi> resi ded. Tis also called <hi>Tripoli,</hi> a rude and incompact structure, having nothing of moment in it more than the statue of <hi>Domitian,</hi> which some too will not have to be his, but the statue and Arch of <hi>Claudius</hi> the Emperor.</p>
                  <p>The Church of Saint <hi>Lorenzo,</hi> in <hi>Lucina,</hi> was sacred to <hi>Juno Lu cina,</hi> and yet retains its old name, here of old, breeding women and such as lay in Childbed, after the birth used to pay their vows, because by the good will of the Goddess, not only themselves were preserved in that great peril, but the Life of their tender In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fants.</p>
                  <p>In the street <hi>de Condotti,</hi> in the house of the <hi>Bosii,</hi> some notable and old inscriptions are extant. In the Palace of the Spanish Embas<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sador a fair and Copious Fountain. In that of <hi>Dionigio Octaviano Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>da,</hi> (who translated the old Dialogues of <hi>D. Antonio Augustino,</hi> into <hi>Italian,</hi>) a good number of rare things in this kind. In that of the <hi>Ruzzelai,</hi> a Gallery filled with old statues of rare artifice, and in the Court, a very large brazen horse. And in that of the Cardinal <hi>Desa,</hi> now building, we assure our selves of rare Architecture and great Curiosities.</p>
                  <p>The <hi>Campo Martio</hi> heretofore without the City, fils that plain be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween the <hi>Quirinale,</hi> the <hi>Ponte di Sisto,</hi> and the <hi>Tevere</hi> or <hi>Tyber,</hi> here the

                  <p>Between <hi>Santa Maria del Popolo,</hi> and the <hi>Porta Flaminia,</hi> is seen an O<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>belisk, filled with Hieroglyphicks, and <hi>AEgiptian Letters:</hi> which <hi>Pliny</hi> writes, to be one hundred and ten foot long, and to contain on it the interpretation of the <hi>AEgyptian</hi> Philosophy. <hi>Augustus Caesar</hi> cau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed it to be transferred from <hi>Hieropoli</hi> to <hi>Rome,</hi> with two others, which he placed in the <hi>Circus Maximus.</hi> On the Pedestal is this In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>scription. <hi>Caesar.

                  <p>The house of <hi>Antonino Paleozo,</hi> affords an excellent statue of a horse and some heads, as of <hi>Drusus,</hi> of <hi>Julia</hi> the Daughter of <hi>Augu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stus,</hi> of <hi>Goleria,</hi> of <hi>Faustina Giovene,</hi> the wife of <hi>Marcus Aurelius,</hi> of <hi>Adrian,</hi> of <hi>Brutus, Domitian, Galba, Sabina, Hercules, Bacchus, Sylvanus,</hi> and <hi>Mercury:</hi> And likewise the Triumph of <hi>Tiberius Caesar,</hi> cut live<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly in one Marble stone.

                     <hi>Antoninus Pius,</hi> in that part of the <hi>Campo Martio,</hi> called <hi>Piazza di Sciarra,</hi> erected a hollow Columne with winding stairs, and 56. Case<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments to give Light within to them: being 175 foot high, some say it is raised with 28 stones only, but in this tis not so clearly discerna<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble as in that of <hi>Trajano,</hi> for that the stayers being broke tis not a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>scendable. On the superficies of it are wrought the Acts of <hi>Antoninus</hi> with excellent sculpture of figures, from this, that place is deno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minated <hi>Piazza Colonna.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Those eleaven high Pillars, which are seen erected at the Church of Saint <hi>Stephano,</hi> in <hi>Truglio,</hi> are the reliques of that open Gallery which <hi>Antoninus Pius</hi> built conjoyned, to his Palace in his Court: as far distant from this Church as the <hi>Rotonda.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Between the Collumne of <hi>Antoninus</hi> and the Fountain of <hi>Acque Virgine,</hi> were the <hi>Septa</hi> of the <hi>Campo Martio,</hi> so called for that they were enclosed with several thick Plancks, in which the <hi>Roman</hi> People assembled when they gave their suffrages for Election of the Magi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>strates. They were also called <hi>Ovili</hi> for their similitude to a Sheepfold here the <hi>Roman</hi> Tribes assembled in Council.</p>
                  <p>That Hill, between <hi>San Lorenzo</hi> in <hi>Colonna,</hi> and the abovenamed Column, called <hi>Monte Acitorio:</hi> took its name from the Latine words <hi>Mons Citatorum,</hi> where every Tribe <hi>Se'paratim,</hi> rendred themselvs after they had given their suffrages in the <hi>Septa.</hi> On the same Hill stood a publique Palace, for receipt of Embassadors from Enemies who were not licen ced to enter the City nor dwell in <hi>Graecostasi,</hi> which lay between the Counsel and the <hi>Rostri,</hi> in the <hi>Piazza Roma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>na,</hi> Cardinal <hi>Santa Severina</hi> so much spoken of by the Hereticks, a man of great prudence, and an example for posterity, erected his Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lace on this Hill.</p>
                  <p>Not far from hence is the Fountain of <hi>Aque Virgine,</hi> conveighed by a loud depressed Aqueduct over the <hi>Porta Collina,</hi> the Hill <hi>Santa Trinita,</hi> and through the <hi>Campo Martio</hi> now called <hi>Fontana di Trevi,</hi> we read in the inscription that <hi>Nieolo</hi> the 5th. restored it. And this alone of all the waters (which with so great costs, and such sumptuous
<pb n="215" facs="tcp:62973:122"/>
Aqueducts, the antient Princes brought into <hi>Rome</hi>) remains standing for the publique Benefit.</p>
                  <p>From the <hi>Serraglio,</hi> or <hi>Septa</hi> of the <hi>Roman</hi> people began the <hi>Stra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>da coperta,</hi> wherein stood heretofore a Temple of <hi>Neptune</hi> and the Am<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phitheatre of <hi>Claudius</hi> now wholly destroyed.</p>
                  <p>At the <hi>Acque Virgine</hi> was a Temple dedicated to <hi>Giuturna</hi> Sister of <hi>Tur no</hi> King of the <hi>Rutoli,</hi> accounted one of the <hi>Napee</hi> or Nimphes keep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in gamong flowers, and the Countrey goddess, who as the Heathens believed assisted to the fertility of the Earth.</p>
                  <p>In the house of <hi>Angelio Colorio da Giesi,</hi> now appertaining to the <hi>Ru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fali,</hi> are seen many statues, and inscriptions, and one Arch of the stone <hi>Tivoli,</hi> joyning to the <hi>Acque Virgine,</hi> having this Inscription. <hi>T. Claudius Drus. F. Caesar Augustus.</hi> In the Fountain under the statue of a Nymph now removed are found these verses.

                        <hi>Titus Celius</hi> the <hi>Patrician</hi> recounts, that in former times a body of a man who was slain and cast into the <hi>Aniene,</hi> was found stuck fast to the root of a Tree under water, which it happened, in process of time, (being without putrefaction) was converted into stone, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out loosing its shape: which stony body so found he saies he saw with his proper eyes.</p>

                  <head>Of the <hi>Vatican</hi> Library of the Pope.</head>
                  <p>THe <hi>Vatican</hi> Library of the Pope is every day frequented by lear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned Men, and meritoriously for that it is filled with the most antient books in all the Professions, as well Greek, Latine, and He<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brew as other Languages writtten with the pen in Parchment And tis certainly to be admired, that those Popes under so many disgraces, negociations, Foreign and civil Wars and sackings of Rome, should still apply their chiefest study and pain in heaping to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether Books, and preserving those collections.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Sixtus</hi> the 5th in our time beautified and aggrandized it wonder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fully adjoining to it a noble Fabrick, and causing most excellent pi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctures to be drawn about it: Which <hi>Guglielmo Bianco</hi> a <hi>French</hi> Man praiseth in a singular Poem: and Fryer <hi>Angelo Rocca</hi> by way of Histo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry treates of it diffusely. As also <hi>Onofrio Panuino</hi> of the same Or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der.</p>
                  <p>Many great Scholars have only desired favour from the Pope as to publish an Index of the Greek and Latine Books extant in that Library, that by this means recourse might be had to <hi>Rome</hi> from all parts both for the enlightning and correcting Authors, who have been altogether unseen, or are els printed full of errors. This the noble City <hi>Augusta</hi> permitted, and by that publique Index set forth in vited all to go thither for comparing the uncorrected for their a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mendment. How many bookes have <hi>Francis</hi> the first and <hi>Hen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry</hi> the second Kings of <hi>France</hi> sent forth to light. How many benefits have the Republique of Scholars had from the Grand Duke of <hi>Tusca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nies</hi> Bibliotheque: and how much more advantage would all the world receive from such an Index of the Pontifical Library, which is of splendidly royal.</p>
                  <p>Other Libraries there are also in <hi>Rome,</hi> as that of the Capitol. That which appertained to the Cardinal <hi>Sirleto</hi> now to Cardinal <hi>Colonna,</hi> valeued at 20000. Crownes: That of the Family of <hi>Sforza,</hi> and that of the <hi>Farnesi,</hi> abounding with Greek Authors.</p>
                  <p>We pass by many Libraries of private persons no less replenished with rare Books as that of <hi>Fulvio Orsino.</hi> That of <hi>Aldo Manutio</hi> (who passed to a better life at green yeers) consisting of 80<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> thousand Books. We must observe though<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> that <hi>Fulvio Orsino</hi> in the yeer 1600. added his to the Library of the Pope. And that <hi>Ascanio Colonna</hi> (never e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nough
<pb n="222" facs="tcp:62973:126"/>
to be praised) bought that of <hi>Sirleto</hi> for 14 thousand Crownes deputing to it intelligent Keepers with honest stipends, that it may ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther dayly increase, then at all diminish.</p>
                  <p>The great Duke of <hi>Florence</hi> his noble Library is known to have good numbers of Greek Books, and that of <hi>Urbino,</hi> of Mathemati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cal Writers. That of the <hi>Malatesti</hi> is in <hi>Cesena</hi> in the <hi>Minorites</hi> Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vent. In <hi>Bologna</hi> that of the preaching Fathers. In <hi>Venice</hi> that of the Republique. In <hi>Padoua</hi> is that of <hi>Gio Vicenzo Pinello</hi> famous enough: but lets return to the <hi>Libraria Vaticana.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>'Tis certainly concluded that the Gentiles usually preserved their Books in the publique Libraries as well as private, &amp; tis no less evident that the Catholick Church from Christs time to ours had alwaies in divers places sacred Libraries to advantage students: wherefore St. <hi>Augustine</hi> in the Narration which he makes, <hi>De persecutione Arrianorum in Ecclesia Alexandrina</hi> saies, that in the Christian Churches there were Libraries, and that with the greatest care they preserved their Books: and accuseth the impiety of the <hi>Arrians</hi> amongst other things for their taking away and burning the Books of the Church. Saint <hi>Jerome</hi> like<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wise makes mention of the same Libraries. when writing to <hi>Pama<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chius</hi> by his Books against <hi>Jovinianus</hi> he saies that he kept in the Chur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ches Libraries <hi>Eusebius</hi> also in his 119 Book at the 11 Chapter writeth, that the Church had holy Books in the Oratories, and that in <hi>Dio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clesians</hi> dayes, (to the end the name of Christian might be wholly ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinguished) the Oratories were overthrowen, and the books burnt nor does there want conjectures hereof from the holy Scripture for that Saint <hi>Paul</hi> writing to <hi>Timothy,</hi> commands him to transport with himself his Books to <hi>Rome,</hi> chiefly those in parchment: and in the first to the <hi>Corinthians,</hi> he testifies that in the <hi>Corinthian</hi> Churches, they used to read the Prophetick books. <hi>Eusebius</hi> in his 5 book of the Ec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clesiastical history at the 10th. Chapter saies, that the Apostle Saint <hi>Eartholomew</hi> going to prea ch the gospel to the <hi>Indians,</hi> left there the Gospel of Saint <hi>Matthew</hi> writ by his own hand: Which very copy, <hi>Origene</hi> afterwards found in the <hi>Indies,</hi> and from thence carryed it (as Saint <hi>Jerome</hi> averrs) to <hi>Alexandria,</hi> when he also brought from the East the Canonical books of the old Testament. Lastly the He<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brews diligently conserved their sacred books, and on every Sab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bath read the Books of <hi>Moses</hi> in their Synagogues wherefore tis reaso<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nable enough to believe, that the Christians have alwaies observed their rule, of diligently copying and preserving the prophetick books those of the Apostles and those of the Evangelists: But the places where these books were layed up, were not alwaies called by the same name, but sometimes <hi>Archiviunt</hi> a Treasury of <hi>Rolls, scrinium</hi> a Coffer where evidences were kept, <hi>Bibliotheca</hi> or <hi>Libraria</hi> a Biblio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>theque or Library as in se veral Authors appears.</p>
                  <p>Then indubitably they used to lay up in places deputed to that purpose the Memorials of greatest importance, the Books of the Bi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble of the old and new Testament, and the Books of the holy Fathers; many whereof written by their own Authors through this means have reached our times, and will continue to future Ages if God soplease,</p>
                  <p>And because the collecting and conserving those books, required a great expence as well in writers, as Inquisitors, and conserva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tors, therefore the richest Christians co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>monly contributed every one
<pb n="223" facs="tcp:62973:126"/>
some proportion and part, as a common stock for the Church to have the same effected.</p>
                  <p>And in particular we have great obligation to the Emperor <hi>Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stantine</hi> the Great, who (as <hi>Eusebius</hi> recounts in his third Book of his life) without regard to the vast expence, made it his business to col<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lect and secure the sacred Books, which in the times of the persecu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions the Gentiles had wholy dispersed.</p>
                  <p>After which the gathering, keeping, and choosing Books, was par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticularly the charge of the Bishops and Priests, for which end they were wont to maintain Notaries, Stationers, and Women exercised and skilled in writing, as may be gathered from the life of <hi>Ambrosi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>us</hi> and of <hi>Origene.</hi> Among all other Collectors of Books <hi>Pantenius</hi> the Master of the <hi>Alexandrian</hi> School is esteemed the most diligent: like<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wise <hi>Pamfilo</hi> the Priest and Martyr (as <hi>Eusebius</hi> relates) instituted and governed with great industry a fair Library, placing there the Books of <hi>Origene</hi> and such other good Books as he could get written by the hand: of which <hi>Caesarean</hi> Library St. <hi>Jerom</hi> against <hi>Rufinus</hi> takes notice. Furthermore <hi>Alexander</hi> the Bishop of <hi>Jerusalem</hi> got together a good quantity of Books, as of <hi>Betillus, Hippolitus, Caius</hi> and other Ecclesiasti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cal writers, and with them composed a worthy Library, as <hi>Eusebius</hi> testifies, who also confesseth himself to have been assisted by the said <hi>Alexander</hi> in his own Ecclesiastical History.</p>
                  <p>And not to omit the diligence of some of later times in the like work, lets remember, that Pope <hi>Clement</hi> the first, successor to St. <hi>Peter,</hi> who wrote many Epistles profitable to the <hi>Roman</hi> Church, de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>puted seaven Scriveners in the seaven praecincts of <hi>Rome,</hi> who were maintained out of the Churches Revenne for no other thing then di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligently to search out and write the Acts of the martyrs. And <hi>Ani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cetus</hi> the Pope made it his business to find out a secure place for the laying up the lives of the Martyrs wrote by those Scriveners. Pope <hi>Fabianus</hi> ordained seaven Deacons, for supervisors to those Nota<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries, to take the better care in executing the charge of collecting and true recital of the Martirs lives: Of which Scriveners the Actions of the <hi>Roman</hi> Councel under <hi>Silvester,</hi> give good testimony Pope <hi>Ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lius</hi> successor to <hi>Marcus</hi> who followed <hi>Sil.</hi> determined that the said No<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taries abovenamed should diligently gather together, whatever ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pertained to the amplifying, and fortifiing of the holy Catholick Faith, &amp; that all the things by them writ should be revised by the <hi>Pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>micerio,</hi> or chief, created to that purpose, who afterwards was to place and keep in the Church what he had approved.</p>
                  <p>Pope <hi>Hilary</hi> was the first (known) that built a Library, who erect<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed two near, the Founts of the <hi>Laterano,</hi> wherein (for that in those times there were but few Books, and they at great price because wholly written by the hand) he caused the writings of the <hi>Roman</hi> Church, the decretal Epistles of Popes, the Actions of the Counsels, the recantations and opinions of the Hereticks, and the Books of the holy Fathers, to be layed up and preserved for the publique use of the Christians.</p>
                  <p>But to return to our purpose of the <hi>Vatican</hi> Library: we must know that beside the abovenamed Libraries, the Popes used so great dili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gence in collecting books, as they put together one greater than the two former in the Popes Palace on the <hi>Laterano,</hi> which remained
<pb n="224" facs="tcp:62973:127"/>
there about one thousand yeers, till <hi>Clement</hi> the 5th. translating the Apostolick Sea into <hi>France,</hi> with it carryed the said Library in the <hi>Laterano</hi> to <hi>Avignon</hi> in <hi>France,</hi> which continued there about 120 yeers, till the difference was appeased between the Catholicks<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> Pope <hi>Martin</hi> the 5th. caused the said Library to be reconveyed to <hi>Rome,</hi> placing it in the <hi>Vatican,</hi> where his <hi>S.</hi> had then chosen and setled his Residence: where they were disposed confusedly without any order, and a good part lost. Whereto <hi>Sixtus</hi> the 4th. having regard, &amp; it appearing to him insupportable, that so great a quantity of books should go to ruine through ill government, he built a place on pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pose for them adorning it by all possible means, placing them me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thodically, and adding such other Books as he could come by, and or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dered the Officers deputed to that end, to govern them with dili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gence, endowing it with a hundred Crowns a yeer in perpetuity, being the donative which the Colledge of writers of the Pontifical Letters was used to make the Popes yeerly, and this was bestowed on the Library Keepers for their diligence and pains. This then is the <hi>Vatican</hi> Library, filled with the most choise Books that could be had a great part written in parchment with the pen: others printed: and their number exceeds six thousand books.</p>
                  <p>Antiently the President of this Library was called <hi>Librario,</hi> then <hi>Cancellario,</hi> whose office was to collect with diligence not only the Books, but also to copy the Bulls, the Popes decrees, the Acts and Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stitutions of the Synods, and to keep every thing exactly, because it appeared convenient, that the <hi>Cancellario</hi> or as he is now called the Secretary of the Pope, should have the managing and preserving of the Books, the Library being in those dayes as twere the Office of the Secretary or Chancery: but in our times the Offices of the Chancery and of the Library are divided.</p>
                  <p>They used to elect Men of the greatest knowledge and of good life for Presidents of the Library as <hi>Anastasius</hi> in the Life of Pope <hi>Gre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gory</hi> the second relates, which <hi>Gregory</hi> he saies was first President there who being sent to <hi>Constantinople</hi> by Pope <hi>Constantine</hi> to the Empe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ror <hi>Justinian</hi> the second, and being questioned by him he answered learnedly: and the Bibliothecary in the life of the said <hi>Gregory</hi> the second saies that he was from a boy brought up in the <hi>Lateranian</hi> pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lace, and being made Deacon by Pope <hi>Sergius</hi> took upon him the charge of the Library. at last <hi>Sixtus</hi> the 4th. on the 10 day of <hi>July</hi> 1475. being the sixth of his Papacy, created a perpetual Keeper to the <hi>Vatican</hi> Library investing him in that Office by his Bull.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Bartolomeo Platina</hi> of <hi>Cremona</hi> the Apostolick writer, and familiar of <hi>Sixtus</hi> the fourth was the first president to the <hi>Vatican</hi> Library, for which service he had 10 Crowns <hi>per</hi> Month for his maintenance, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sides provision for his own Table with 3 servants and one horse, and the ordinary Vails, which the popes usually allowed to their Famili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ants, as Wood, Salt, Oyl, Vinegar, Candles, Brooms, and other the like things.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Bartolomeo Manfredo</hi> a <hi>Bolonian</hi> Doctor of the Canons was by <hi>Six<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tus</hi> the 4th. <hi>annno.</hi> 1481: in the 11th of his Popedome elected to that Charge in lieu of the deceased <hi>Platina.</hi> This <hi>Manfredo</hi> was a Fami<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liar acquaintance of the Popes, and wonderfully learned. And to add splendor to this Office the Pope ordained that the Presidents of the
<pb n="225" facs="tcp:62973:127"/>
Library for the future should be the first Squires of the Roman Popes for ever, and should receive the accustomed honors and profits: first giving security to the Apostolick Chamber of ten thousand Duckats, and taking an Oath to keep faithfully and diligently the Library. Af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter <hi>Manfredo</hi> these following were successively created.</p>

                  <argument>
                     <p>Wherein is shewed, that for good reasons the <hi>Pope</hi> wears a Cross upon his Shoe or Slipper, and the <hi>Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stian People</hi> kiss his Feet.</p>
                  </argument>
                  <p>AMong the many things the Popes had given them to bear and carry for ensignes of Glory and dignity by the Emperor <hi>Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stantine</hi> the Great, with which for long time together they have gone adorned, ware a pair of Slippers made of the whitest linnen cloth for the Ornament of their Feet. (which Slippers we may name Pumpes for their being so apted to the Feet) whereof we read an e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>special memorial in the Acts of <hi>San Silvestre,</hi> for that the Emperor <hi>Constantine</hi> commanded that the Popes of <hi>Rome</hi> should cloth their Feet with the purest Linnen, in imitation of the high Priests and an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tient Prophets, who we read in the fifth Book of <hi>Herodian</hi> were thus vested. And tis most certain, that the Sandals or slippers of the <hi>Roman</hi> Bishop are alwaies bedecked with some singular Ornament, differing from those which ordinary Bishops wear at the celebration of their Mass, otherwise how could the blessed <hi>Antidius</hi> near <hi>Segeberto</hi> in <hi>Anno</hi> 418 distinguish the Pope by the slippers he had on, nor could that have happened, if those of the Pope had not had a peculiar Mark differing from those of the Bishops. <hi>San Bernardo</hi> in his forty second Epistle declares that the slippers are a part of those Ensignes which the Popes are obliged to wear at the solemnizing of Mass.</p>
                  <p>The same thing also is averred by <hi>Innocenzo</hi> III. in his first Book <hi>de Divinis Officiis,</hi> in the 24th Chapter. <hi>Ivo Cornatense,</hi> in the 76th. Epistle, and in his speech <hi>de significatione Indumentorum. Rabano</hi> in his first Book the 22d. Chapter <hi>Durando</hi> in his third Book the 28th. Chapter and many others.</p>
                  <p>And although rhe <hi>Roman</hi> High Priests antiently used this sort of Shooing with the whitest Linnen, we must nevertheless, confess, that now the Custome is changed, and in lieu thereof are worne a cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain red sort of shooing, with a cross wrought on them the occasion of which mutation may be attributed partly to the reverence of the People, and partly to the consideration of the Popes Person.</p>
                  <p>Wherein will be manifested the humility of the Pope, who knowing all Persons prone to the kissing of his Feet, desired to have the sign
<pb n="228" facs="tcp:62973:129"/>
of the Cross fixed thereon, to the end that so much honour might be payed to the most holy sign of the Cross rather than to his own pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per person: And that his Holiness would also reduce into the minds of the faithfull which kiss his feet, the passion and death of our Savi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>our. With great Judgment then, most honest intention and good end, have they introduced this wearing the signe of the Cross upon the popes Sandals, since that the kissing of the cross is an Act of the Reverence born to it, used in the most holy Church antiently, whose custom it was in that manner to reverence not only the holy Crosse, but also the holy Images of Christ and of the Saints, the Visage and heads of which Images the faithfull of old accustomed to approach, in token of respect and honour, as <hi>Niceforus</hi> in his seaventeenth Book the 25th. Chapter recounts, and <hi>Zonara</hi> in the third tome of the Life of <hi>Theodofilo.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>The sublime Ensigne of the <hi>Romans</hi> made in manner of the Cross of the Saviour, which was wont to be born before <hi>Constantine</hi> the Emperor, and was adored by the Senate and the Souldiery, is called <hi>Laboria,</hi> perchance for that in Latine it signifies Labour, to wit for that that blessed Ensigne put the Souldiers in good heart and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>membrance, when they were near toyled with fighting, or for that they bore up that Ensign when they marched, or els for that they mustred the Souldiers under that Banner to signifie to them the pains they must take under it, as <hi>Paolo Diacono,</hi> relates in the 11th. of his History, and <hi>Nicolo Prinio</hi> in the consults of the <hi>Burgari,</hi> at the 7th. Chap and 23. <hi>Paolino Nolano</hi> demonstrates very clearly in the 42d. E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pistle, the Custome, which was, that the princes and great Lords kis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed the Cross, submitting to it all the Banners of their glory, and worldly Majesty.</p>
                  <p>Nor have they born this Reverence to the Cross alone, but also to all the Instruments of the Passion of our Lord, as <hi>Sant Ambrosius</hi> in a discourse he makes of the death of <hi>Theodosius,</hi> averreth, touching one of the Nayls which was pierced through the Feet of our Saviour. To come then to the other Head, wherefore we judge it convenient the change of the white slippers or sandals, for slippers or sandals with the Cross wrought on them; we say that herein the Popes have endeavoured to demonstrate expresly the Image of the Aposto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lick charge because they havinng received a charge to teach to all the world, and to preach the Gospel, have likewise adorned their feet with the signe of peace and of the Gospel<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> that so they may walk perfect through the World in vertue of the signe of the crosse. <hi>Isaiah</hi> the Prophet saith thus, Beautifull are the Feet of those who preach Peace, and publish good tidings, as if that forseeing this U<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sage, he should wonder, how the heads of the Christian People should find out so convenient an ornament to put up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on their Feet, so that the Nations beholding them should not only remain full of gladnesse for the good newes which they had heard from them; but should also perceive a certain content for having seen them all beautifull, all adorned, and signalized to the very feet with the figure of the holy Cross. Because tis usual to weigh in qua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lified persons, all their Actions, all their words, all their Vestments and habits to their very feet; and so the Bridegroom praising his Spouse in the <hi>Canticles,</hi> sets down as a great concern, that having
<pb n="229" facs="tcp:62973:129"/>
fair shoes she walked graciously. <hi>Tertullian</hi> in his Book of the habits of women, puts a difference between <hi>Culto</hi> Neatness, and <hi>Ornamen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to,</hi> Ornament, saying that neatness consists in the quality of the Vests as of Gold, Silver, and the like habiliments, but that Ornament con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sists in the disposition of the parts of that body which wears it. Then the <hi>Roman</hi> Bishops, who rconcile and make Peace by way of their Letters and Ministers to all Nations to the great astonishment of all, have obtained and pursued the one and the other of the aforenamed parts, that is to say Neatness and Ornament.</p>
                  <p>Furthermore the sign of the Cross is made on the forehead and Breasts of the faithfull, to the end that as <hi>Augustine</hi> saith upon the 30th <hi>Psalm,</hi> they may not fear to confess the faith, and having over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come the Devil, they may carry the Banner of their Victory in their forehead, therefore also is the same signe worne upon the feet of the Pope, that he by that sign may be directed in that good way through which he is to lead all the People of God, thereby to shew unto the Pope, that to him was given this holy priviledge to be our guide by means of the Cross: wherein (saith Saint <hi>Austin</hi> in the 10th Sermon <hi>de Sanctis Tom</hi> 10) are contained all the Mysteries and all the Sacra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments, he fortifies (as we may say) his feet with the Cross, to the end that he shewing the way and we walking in it, none may wander from good thoughts. It may also be said that the Pope bears a Cross upon his feet, that in all persecutions and dangers all his people may recur securely to his Feet, where remedy may be had to overcome the difficulties, and doctrine to oppresse heresies if need require, as tis written in <hi>Deutronomy</hi> at the 33d. Chapter, <hi>Qui appropinquat pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dibus accepit de doctrina ejus.</hi> Weighing all which considerations, with their foundation in the passion of Christ, very rationally have the Popes placed this signe upon their feet, to evidence these mysterious significations. Which is so antient and firm, that in the old Ima<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ges we see no Pope drawn or carved who hath not also the cross up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on his Feet: from which considerations it appears manifestly, that the perverse and wicked Hereticks of our times are in a great error, for expressing their dislike of the Popes wearing a Cross upon his feet, saying that tis an undervaluation and want of due reverence payed to the Cross.</p>
                  <p>For answer whereunto by their favour: Is it not true (that as <hi>Cirillus</hi> in 3. <hi>Tomo contra Julianum</hi> saies) the old usage was to paint Crosses on the entrances into houses, and that (as <hi>Nazianzenus</hi> in his oration against the same saies) on the garments of the Souldiers were signed Crosses come from heaven, and that the Church to succor dying persons with spiritual help, used to mark their feet with the signe of the Cross, and that twas usual to mark the bodies of beasts with the Cross, as saies <hi>Sainctus Severus de Morbibus bono:</hi> and <hi>San Chrysostome,</hi> in his demonstration <hi>Quod Deus sit homo.</hi> Did they not mark the houses, the publick places, the Vests, the Armories, and fi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nally divers other usual things with the Cross, as <hi>Leoncio Cipriottio</hi> a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainst the Jews declares, to the end that in every place and in eve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry action, we may rub up our drowsie memories with the passion of Christ our Lord: And shall we afterwards say, that it expresseth lit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle reverence to the Cross in placing it upon the feet of Christs Vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>car, by which we not only are minded of the passion of our Saviour
<pb n="230" facs="tcp:62973:130"/>
when we behold it, but intend that thereby is signified, that we ought not alone to submit to the Cross, and tread down all worldly passi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, which to the purpose are expressed in Scripture with the name of feet, but also for the Love of the passion of Christ to esteem at nought what ever happens under the Moon. The which cannot be so well signified, by placing the Cross in any other places but on the Feet of the Pope, to kiss which all the faithfull strivingly run toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther.</p>

                  <p>TIs not from the purpose to say somewhat of the Lifting up of the Pope, since that all old Authors when they speak of the Creation of any King or Emperour, say that he was elevated and it may be that <hi>Claudianus</hi> speaks to this sense.

                  </p>
                  <p>Nor was this the custom of the Barbarous Nations only, but even of the Romans themselves who having chosen any One for their Em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peror, lifted him on high, and carryed him upon their Shoulders: so saies <hi>Ammianus Marcellinus</hi> in his 22 book speaking of <hi>Julianus</hi> made Emperor by the Souldiers of <hi>France;</hi> so sets forth <hi>Cornelius Tacitus</hi> in his 20 book and the same likewise speaks <hi>Cassiodorus</hi> of the Goths in his 20th Book <hi>Variacum Epist.</hi> 31. This custom <hi>Adon</hi> of <hi>Vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>enna</hi> manifests in the sons of <hi>Clotharus: Julianus Capitolinus</hi> speaking of the <hi>Giordani:</hi> and <hi>Herodian</hi> in his seventh book treating of the same. In which time, they did not only exalt the <hi>Roman</hi> Princes as aforesaid, and Princes of other Nations, but likewise the praefects of the City whom to honour the more they usually drew up and down the streets in a <hi>Caroach</hi> with an officer going be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore, who proclaimed, that the praefect came; and this is clearly de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monstrated by <hi>Siniachus</hi> in his first book &amp; <hi>Cassiodorus</hi> in his 6th. from 24. But the <hi>Roman</hi> Bishops who from God have chief authority over the eternal way, for demonstration of their dignity, were wont to be conveighed through the City in a certain Chariot, honestly, or meanly clothed, as <hi>Ammianus Marcellinus,</hi> in his 27th book avers in his conceipt of <hi>Damascus</hi> and <hi>Urcisinus</hi> to this point in that time when <hi>Pretestatus</hi> put on the <hi>Pretesta</hi> (which was a Robe the chief Magistrate of <hi>Rome</hi> wore when they sate in Majesty) being then de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>signed Consul: he preposed the Bishoprick of the Christians to the Consulship of the <hi>Roman</hi> people, and was wont to say to <hi>San Damas<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cus</hi> the Pope (as <hi>San Girolamus</hi> also relates in his Epistle to <hi>Pammac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chius</hi>)
<pb n="231" facs="tcp:62973:130"/>
make me Bishop of <hi>Rome,</hi> and I will soon make my self a Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stian, from which words we may comprehend, that even in those daies the Pontifical dignity moved the minds of the principal and greatest persons being that the Consulacy was a dignity to which all others gave place, as in more Epistles <hi>Cassiodorus</hi> shews in the 10th. book and <hi>Protestatus</hi> so he might have been high Bishop of the Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stians would not only have deserted his old false Religion, but also Consulship.</p>
                  <p>That it was the manner of the antient Priests to pass in Coaches for greater reputation, <hi>Tacitus</hi> in his 12th book clearly proves, who speaking of <hi>Agrippina,</hi> saies, That shee (to agrandize her repu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation this way) was drawn to the <hi>Campidoglio</hi> in a Caroach a thing then only permitted to the Priests and holy Druides for their digni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty. This custom was likewise used by the Virgins (as may be col<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lected from the first book of <hi>Artimedorus,</hi> his Positions) and chiefly of the Vestals, who were carryed in Litters, attended by many ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vants with great Pomp, as Saint <hi>Ambrose</hi> relates in his first Epistle to <hi>Valentinian.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>But the <hi>Romon</hi> Bishops, besides the Chariot and Coach wherein they publiquely passed through the City, had also a supportable Chair wherein being sate it was carryed upon the shoulders of Men depu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted to that service, and who lived upon that profession which is ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nifest enough, not only from that place of <hi>Duoaio,</hi> where he saies, that in the fifth Synod, was placed the Chair or Throne of the Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stolick confession, but also more clearly from the most antient <hi>Ro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man</hi> Order written before <hi>Gelasius</hi> the Popes time, wherein we finde expressions to this sence <hi>viz.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>When the Pope is entred into the Church, he does not instantly advance to the Altar, but first goes into the Vestry sustained by Dea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cons, who received &amp; assisted him, while he descended from his Chair and to that effect the said Order several times relates the Ceremony of placing the Pope in the Chair, when he was to take any Journey and to sustain him by the Arms in descent from the Chair, being ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rived at the place where he resolved to stay.</p>
                  <p>In which words is also to be observed, that the said Order calls this Pontifical Chair in Latin <hi>Sellare,</hi> which properly signifies a Maje<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stick Throne made for dignity, it being a Chair wrought with Art and proportionable thereto.</p>
                  <p>As to the Popes being born up by hands, tis easily manifested, that he was so supported not only at his descent from the Chair, but also upon several other occasions when not at all in the Chair, which is proved by the examples of many Popes: As <hi>Stephen</hi> the second (saies <hi>Palatina,</hi> and <hi>Francesco Giovanetto</hi> in the 90th. Chapter was car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ried upon shoulders in the Church of <hi>Constantine,</hi> and then in the <hi>La<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terano</hi> and <hi>Adrian</hi> the second was so born up in the <hi>Laterano</hi> by the Clergy and by the chief of the Nobility the Comunalty then contending with the Clergy and Nobility for that honourable Office, as appears in the descriptions the 63d. Chapter, which be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gins. <hi>Cum Adrianus Secundus, &amp;c.</hi> And <hi>Gregory</hi> the ninth was so sustained in the <hi>Laterano,</hi> laded with Gemmes and Gold.</p>
                  <p>At which custome none ought to wonder, since so long before prophesied by <hi>Esaiah</hi> in the 49th Chapter be these words. <hi>Et ef<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferent

                  <p>The occasion for which custome proceeds from the great reve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rence wherewith the Princes of the World ought to observe the Presidents of the Church, which Princes ought not to omit any con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venient honour due to the Church, and so consequently to the head thereof. It stands with good reason too, that the Pope should be born up on high, to the end that on the one side he may the better see and bestow his Benediction on the People comitted to him, and that the People may on the other side behold their Head, acknow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledging him for Gods Vicar, and thence fortifie themselves in the confession of the Catholick Faith.</p>

                  <p>Moreover <hi>Ammianus Marcellinus</hi> in the 17th. book treating of the sharp pointed Pyramids, saies that they were wont to place Crowns on the heads of statues: which he again confirms in the 24th Book, from which testimonies <hi>Lazius</hi> collects in his 9th Book of Commen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taries of the <hi>Roman</hi> Republique, that our Predecessors derived the custome of placing on the heads of the Images of Saints in the Chur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ches, Crowns figured in the form of the raies of the Sun, chiefly for that those images being adorned with such Crownes, seemed to have, I know not what kind of splendour and Divinity: which rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son, though it be not, altogether from the purpose, yet tis not al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>together to be, maintained: for that we rather think, that this u<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sage and custome had its original from that splendour which hath been often seen miraculously, to shine on the heads of the Saints: Being that (as <hi>Abdias</hi> in the 5th. Book, and <hi>Eusebius</hi> in the second of his Histories relate) the Apostles were often overshadowed with such a Light, as human eye could not behold them, as of old fell out to <hi>Moses,</hi> whose Face (when he had had that near conference with God) did shine so bright, that <hi>Aaron</hi> and the children of <hi>Israel,</hi> were afraid to come near him, as is recorded in the 34th Chapter of <hi>Exodus.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>To return then to our subject. The <hi>Persian</hi> Kings had a Crown to be worn on their heads which <hi>Zonara</hi> sets down in greek by its proper name, which can neither be commodiously ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pressed either in Latin or vulgar tongue: and it was a capital of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fence among the <hi>Persians</hi> for any one to put the Kings Crown upon his head as <hi>Dion Chrysostomus</hi> denotes in his first oration <hi>De libertate &amp; servitute.</hi> Likewise the priests of the Gentiles wore a crown upon their heads, for demonstration of that repute which appertained to the splendidness and maintenance of their Sacerdotal office: whence the Antients were stupified, at a suddain view of the great Priest of the <hi>Comani,</hi> to whom (as <hi>Strabo</hi> writes) was granted the first ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour next the King, and to wear a Royal Crown. Besides in <hi>Emesa</hi> a City of <hi>Phoenicia,</hi> the Priests went clad with a long robe, having a Crown of pretious stones of various colours in token of Majesty upon their heads. Which Ornament <hi>Antoninus</hi> being made Empe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ror of the <hi>Romans,</hi> by the multitude, the Souldiery and the Priests of the Sun, would not part with again, as <hi>Herodianus</hi> in <hi>libro quinto</hi> clear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly proves: and so afterwards the Emperors of <hi>Constantinople</hi> trium<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phing, elected this ornament, which was called by a proper name as we read in the life of <hi>Basilius Porfirogenitus. Triumphum duxit tiara tecta; quam illi tuphum appellant,</hi> although some modern Authors call it <hi>Calipora,</hi> as saies <hi>Niceforus Gregorius</hi> in <hi>libro sexto.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Or Bishops then having two royal Dignities, to wit the spiritual and temporal, deservedly wear a double crown, as <hi>Innocent</hi> the third
<pb n="234" facs="tcp:62973:132"/>
in his third sermon <hi>De coronatione Pontificis,</hi> confirms, saying that the Popebears the Mitre in token of the spiritual power, and the Crown in testimony of the Temporal, both which are conferred upon him by God omnipotent, King of Kings and Lord of Lords.</p>
                  <p>But let us examine a little whether the Mitre, and the Crown, are Ornaments adapted to the Ecclesiastical customs.</p>
                  <p>The mitre by <hi>Suidas</hi> is called the swathe or Fillet of the head, bound about with gold and silver as <hi>Brissonius</hi> explains: and <hi>Eusebi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>us</hi> in his second book, the first Chapter, calls it a shelter; with which Saint <hi>James</hi> the Apostle called the Brother of our Lord, was sud<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dainly adorned, when by the Apostles he was chosen and consecra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted Bishop of <hi>Jerusalem:</hi> which Ornament, although it took be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginning with <hi>Aaron</hi> Priest of the Hebrew Law, is nevertheless re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived into the Christian Church, to the end that therewith the Bi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>shops of all Nations may be adorned. <hi>Policrates Ephesinus</hi> wore the Mitre (as <hi>Eusebius</hi> in the 31st Chapter of the third Book relates) as Priest of <hi>Ephesus:</hi> and likewise the other Priests wore almost all the Ornaments of the antient Priests, as the Robe, and the Mitre, that they might appear the more adorned and majestick saies <hi>Eusebius</hi> in his Book; whereof <hi>Amalarius, Rabanus,</hi> and others the gravest Authors treat more amply.</p>
                  <p>What we have spoken touching the Mitre is without contradi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction, and is held for truth by the consent of many and sundry Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions, but what is to be spoken touching a Kingdome, and a Roy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>al Crown, is not so perspicuous to all, wherefore to our best power we will endeavour to manifest the same.</p>
                  <p>Then first is to be observed, that tis the common opinion of all, that this sort of Ornament upon the head of the Pope had its origi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal from the Emperor <hi>Constantine</hi> the Great, as appears in the Acts of <hi>San Silvestre</hi> the Pope: the same opinion is also embraced by all o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther <hi>Roman</hi> Bishops, as by <hi>Leo</hi> the ninth in the 13. chapter of his E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pistle against the presumption of <hi>Michaele,</hi> and <hi>Innocent</hi> the third in his first Sermon of the blessed <hi>Silvester,</hi> confirms That <hi>Constantine</hi> the great at his departure from <hi>Rome</hi> to <hi>Constantinople,</hi> would have bestowed his own Crown upon <hi>San Silvester,</hi> which he refused, but in lieu thereof put a covering upon his head entirely circular, and a little after <hi>Innocent</hi> follows in words to this sence: And for this cause the <hi>Roman Bishop,</hi> in testimony of Empire, wears a Regal crown called in Latin <hi>Regnum,</hi> and in testimony of his Pontificacy he wears a Mitre, which is most convenient, for him in all times and places universally, because the spiritual power hath been ever esteemed for the Prior, more worthy and more great then the Tempo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral. And reason will yeeld, that <hi>San Silvester</hi> would not wear that Crown, but such a one as only covered the Temples, in respect his head was shaven as the Popes ought to be. Which shaving gave good reason that twas not decent to wear such a Diadem, but ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther that circular covering which he chose named properly <hi>Tiara Phrigia,</hi> whereof <hi>Juvenal</hi> speaks in his sixth satyr saying.
<q>
                        <l>Et Phrygia vestitur buca tiara.</l>
                     </q>
                  </p>
                  <p>Which Ornament may be supposed to be borrowed either from
<pb n="235" facs="tcp:62973:132"/>
                     <hi>Phrygia</hi> or <hi>Phoenicia,</hi> as we please, because the <hi>Phrigians</hi> had their original from the <hi>Phoenicians.</hi> And that this was given the Pope by the Emperor <hi>Constantine</hi> the great, is most evident in the Acts of <hi>San Sil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vester,</hi> where the Emperor reckons up those things, that he had be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stowed on the Pope, and being come to this, gives it the name <hi>Phry<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gium,</hi> as twas its proper name; but in respect twas not manifest to all, what thing <hi>Phrygium</hi> denoted, he explains himself in the sence by us set down, saying
<q>et Phrygium nempe tegmen capitis sive Mitram.</q>
                  </p>
                  <p>This particular required so much explanation, for that <hi>Theodorus Balsamones,</hi> confounding the signification of <hi>Phrygium,</hi> by joining it with the subsequent <hi>Lorum,</hi> which imports a perfect different thing hath caused many to erre in beleeving that <hi>Phrygium</hi> and <hi>Lorum</hi> put together do denote <hi>Pallium,</hi> the Cope which Arch- Bishops wear by the concession of the highest Bishop. But tis not convenient for us to dwell longer upon the dispute, let the intelligent read the latin <hi>Itine<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rary</hi> in this place, where they'l meet an ample discourse upon the sig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nifications of these words.</p>
                  <p>Other authors will have, that this Crown came not from <hi>Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stantine</hi> but from <hi>Clodoveo,</hi> as they labour to draw from <hi>Segeberto</hi> un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der the yeer of our Lord 550. who speaks to this sence, <hi>Clodoveus</hi> the King received from <hi>Anastasius</hi> the Emperor, the Codicils of the Consulacy, a Crown of Gold with Jewels, and the red garment, and on that day he was called Consul and King, but the same King sent to Saint Peter at <hi>Rome</hi> the Crown of Gold with the Jewels, the Roy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>al Ensigne, which is called <hi>Regnum.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Armonius</hi> also confirms in his first book the 24th. Chapter, that from <hi>Clodoveus</hi> the Pope had the Crown: and <hi>Anastasius</hi> the Library Keeper under Pope <hi>Hormisda,</hi> testifies that Saint <hi>Peter</hi> received many gifts: In whom I have read, that in the yeer 776 that <hi>Philip</hi> the first Pope and <hi>Constantine</hi> the second Pope were both consecra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted in <hi>San Peters</hi> Church (but we must observe that the antient Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thors under the word consecration understand also the ceremony of coronation) for that when they say, that <hi>Charles</hi> the great was con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>secrated Emperor, they also by it understand he was Crowned, whence we may draw, that the Coronation of the Pope, had its rise in long since past times, since that in the yeer 683. under <hi>Aga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thone</hi> the first, and <hi>Benedict</hi> the second, was raised the custome of gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving moneys at the coronation of the Pope, and of expecting the authority of the Emperor. <hi>Eugenius</hi> the second was crowned the 22d. of <hi>May</hi> in the yeer 824. <hi>Benedict</hi> in the yeer 855, <hi>Formosus</hi> the first in 891. But after <hi>Clement</hi> which happened in <hi>anno</hi> 1044. all succeeding Popes were crowned as (<hi>Panuinus</hi> observes) in such a man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner, as by it from that time forwards, the Prophecy of <hi>Isaiah</hi> in the sixty first Chapter may be well known to be fulfilled, where he saies as our English Translation renders it: <hi>For he hath clothed me with the garments of Salvatio, he hath covered me with the Robe of Righteousnesse, as a Bridegroom decketh himself with or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>naments:</hi> The <hi>Italian</hi> saies, they (meaning the Priests) are crowned as Bridegroom: after that the Pope is elevated to this supremedig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity
<pb n="236" facs="tcp:62973:133"/>
he wears the garments of eternal peace, and a Crown upon his head: This is that Son of <hi>Eliachim</hi> spoken of from God by <hi>Isaiah</hi> the Prophet in the 22d. Chapter, to whom even at that time God pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mised the Robe the Crown and the Key, as you may read in the 20. 21, 22, 23, and 24. verses of that Chapter and so forwards: The Crown is an Ensigne of Empire, the Robe is a signe of familiar go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernment, the which things are found in their excellency in our Pope. So in the 14th Chapter of the <hi>Revelation</hi> of Saint <hi>John,</hi> at the 14th verse tis said that Christ (named the Son of man) appeared sit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting on a white cloud, adorned with a golden Crown upon his head. And in the 19th. of the <hi>Revelations</hi> about the 11th. verse tis said, that the same Word of God appeared upon a white horse, with many Regal Crowns upon his head and all his Friends, as may be read in the subsequent verses.</p>
                  <p>For this occasion principally were these significations by Crowns to wit that Christ through his Wisdom (signified by the figure of a Crown of Gold) hath obtained victory over all Creatures, and sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jected them to his Dominion. So likewise the <hi>Roman</hi> Bishop who is ouer all Nations, who hath brought all the People under his au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thority, (by the <hi>consignation</hi> and power of God) deservedly puts on the covering of his head three Crowns, thereby demonstrating that in glory, Authority, and great works, he surpasseth all the other Kings and Princes of the world.</p>
                  <p>After so many fore-passed Popes, <hi>Paulus the</hi> second created in the yeer 8465. of the noble <hi>Venetian</hi> Family <hi>Barbi,</hi> as he was of a fair a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>spect and great Spirit, so he took great care to adorn the papal Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tre, with pretious Jewels and curious workmanship. Lastly let us advertise the Reader that in those breifs written by <hi>Caesar Costni</hi> in the third chapter of the first book of his various doubts deceives himself, where he would maintain that the Popes bearing a Mitre with three Crowns proceeds from those mysterious significations by him alleaged, when indeed there is no necessity of them and let thus much suffice.</p>

                  <p>GOD granted to the <hi>Jewes</hi> divine benefits indeed, whereupon afterwards that Nation boasted, saying, That his divine Maje<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sty had not treated other People after that manner: But those graces which the Church our Mother hath received from the good<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness
<pb n="237" facs="tcp:62973:133"/>
of God do far surpass and exceed the Benefits bestowed upon the Hebrew People: For that the Lord that she might be clean and adorned in his sight, gave the blood of his only Son to wash her, and the Treasure of his Wisdome to beautifie her. Among the other be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nefits conferred on the Hebrew Synagogue, that of the yeer of Jubi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>le was most excellent, called most holy, for that it was the yeer of remission and of the commencement of all things, which the Om<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nipotent God ordained to be from 50 to 50 yeers. The like grace be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing due to our Church the Spouse of Christ (though with a different end, for that the Synagogue attended only to temporal affairs, and the holy Church to spirituals singly) by divine disposition she thought convenient to ordain also the yeer of Jubile, though at first only from 100. yeers to 100. yeers. perhaps to draw to good use, the antient diabolick custom of the celebration of the secular Games, which to this end were celebrated every hundredth yeer in <hi>Rome,</hi> with a preceding general invitation from Cryers, who proclaimed through the streets come to the games, the which none ever saw since, nor shall again: which drew into the City of <hi>Rome</hi> infinite People of all Nations for the service of the de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vil: And all those Nations since the institution of the yeer of Jubi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>le, render themselves at <hi>Rome</hi> though with much better reason <hi>viz.</hi> to serve the true God, for the salvation of their own souls: nor ought our pains seem strange to any, for what is said concerning the mutation of evil into good, because that not only in this, but in divers other occasions the holy Church hath had this aime, to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>secrate that to God, which the foolish generations had before time dedicated to Satan, as may be seen in divers Temples of <hi>Rome, now</hi> dedicated to the true Lord, and his Saints, which were former<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly the Temples of Idols used for the distribution of candles, and to make their Feasts, as in <hi>San Pietro</hi> in <hi>Vincola,</hi> the first of <hi>August,</hi> the first of those ceremonies was made in <hi>Rome,</hi> in honour of <hi>Februa</hi> by the <hi>Romans</hi> taken for a Goddess, the other in memory of the tri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>umph of <hi>Augustus Caesar.</hi> We find that <hi>Boniface</hi> the 9th. in the yeer 1300. published the yeer of Jubile by his Bull, wherein he declares as a Restorer rather then an Inventor or institutor of this yeer: And tis no wonder, that we find no firm testimony of its institution before that time, because the Church hath had so many persecuti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, and so great toiles, that tis a miracle that any antient Memori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>als are preserved rather then a wonder that some are lost. At that time then, the Pope in writing divulged this yeer, conceding entire and plenary remission of offences and punishments every hundredth yeer, which number of (Centum) one hundred, bears also a certain sense of returning to good from evil, as is fully proved by <hi>Girola<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mus</hi> and <hi>Beda,</hi> principal Ecclesiastical writers.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Clement</hi> the sixth at the Instance of the <hi>Romans</hi> reduced Jubile to every fiftieth yeer, chiefly for that the life of man is so short, that ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry few arrive to one hundred yeers, and for that in the number <hi>quin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>qua ginta</hi> fifty, are contained many mysteries pertinent to the Christi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>an Religion; but principally it signifies remission and pardon, the proper effect of the Jubile. Moreover the Jewish synagogue had its Jubile every 50. yeers, so that if for no other reason, at leastwise that the Synagogue might not appear richer then the Church twas
<pb n="238" facs="tcp:62973:134"/>
fit, that she should likewise have a Jubile every fifty yeers.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Urban</hi> the sixth reduced it to thirty three yeers for the increase of the Church treasure, afterwards to be disposed of by Saint <hi>Peter</hi> and his successors on the like occasions. But last of all <hi>Paul</hi> the se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cond reduced it to every 25th yeer, and so <hi>Sixtus</hi> the fourth his suc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cessor observed it, as in like manner have all following Popes done.

                  <p>As to what appertains to the name, tis to be observed, that it may be called in Latin <hi>Jobileus &amp; Iobileus,</hi> of which the last is least used, notwithstanding that by the vulgar, tis more frequently called <hi>Giubileo</hi> than otherwise: This word is not derived from <hi>Giubilo,</hi> which signifies Mirth and content (although in truth it ought to be a yeer of rejoycing) but from the hebrew word <hi>Jobel,</hi> wich is as much as to say a Trumpet or Sacbut, for that the Israelites the seventh month before the fiftieth yeer used to proclaim the yeer of Jubile with the sound of Trumpets: furt hermore the Hebrew word <hi>Jobel</hi> also signifies remission and beginning, the proper actions for the yeer of Jubile, for then the <hi>Jews</hi> remitted all debts, and returned all things to their first state.</p>
                  <p>The Pope cannot concede greater indulgences, then those which are granted in the yeer of Jubile, for then they open the treasury of the Church, and bestow on every one as much as is absolutely ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cessary for him, pardoning to him sins and penances, as well imposed as not imposed, freeing of him wholly and absolutely from purga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tory, yea although he should have forgotte<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> his mortal sins in his con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fession or that he should not have confessed the Venial sins (for tis not of necessity to make co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>fession of Venial sins although such must suf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fer pains in purgatory for them, if they be not in some way cancelled in this world) in such manner, that the soul that in that time shall part from the body, doth instantly fly to enjoyment of the selicity of Paradise.</p>

                     <hi>Boniface</hi> the eighth opened the doors of the Church <hi>Vaticano,</hi> and bestowed most ample indulgences of all sins; <hi>Clement</hi> the sixth, ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded the doors of the Church <hi>Lateranense,</hi> ordaining as is above de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clared. <hi>Paulus</hi> the second afterwards added <hi>Santa Maria Maggiore</hi> and <hi>San Paolo,</hi> in the <hi>Via Ostiense,</hi> for visitation. <hi>Gregory</hi> the 13th. in <hi>anno</hi> 1575. ordained, that who would participate the grace of the Jubile, should first communicate in the yeer of Jubile: allplena<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry indulgences are understood to be suspended with certain muta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions of words, of which the Authors treating on the Jubile, speak to that purpose.</p>

                  <p>We begin our Jubile, on the Vigil of the birth day of our Lord in the evening, when the Pope with great solemnity opens the door of the Church <hi>San Pietro,</hi> which at all other times stands continually wal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led up: and he causeth the Lords Cardinals at the same time in the same manner, to open the doors of the other deputed Churches, all which doors (the yeer ended) are again shut up.</p>

                  <p>That tis convenient to celebrate the Jubile in <hi>Rome,</hi> rather then any other City is maintained by pregnant reasons: <hi>Rome</hi> is the most worthy and noble of all other Cities and we therefore understand when we name <hi>Citta</hi> or City, without any other appellation, that it must be <hi>Rome.</hi> She hath had the Empire, is the head, the Mistris, and a compendium of the World. She is full of Riches: hath beauty in her Scite, her Country, fertility of soyl, great comodiousness from the Navigation of the <hi>Tyber,</hi> and the proximity of the Sea. She is the common Countrey of all, and in her are of all Nations, and eve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry people may there find a proper Church for their own Nation, as in deed most Countreys have. There Religion flourisheth more than elsewhere as appears by the infinite Priests and Fryers, which there at leastwise in their diuine duties, if not continually praise the Lord and pray for all. There the Churches are much visited, the Poor releived, the virgins married, and many other pious works perfor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med worthy of perpetual memory. She is a City of singular sancti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty, and in her are placed the most noted things appertaining to our Religion as the Manger wherein our Lord was layed at his birth, the swa<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">

of Confessors, of Virgins, and infinite Reliques of Saints. She is the seat of the Pope, who is Prince of the Church, Vicar of God, Pastor of all, who when abroad, is beheld, admired and adored by all, every one seeking to kiss his Feet, wondring at the <hi>grandezza</hi> of the Cardinals, the gravity of the Bishops and the multitude of the Priests. A treasury of Indulgencies in <hi>Rome</hi> lye continually exposed to whomsoever needs them, where in former times the Christians were persecuted and more cruelly intreated then in any other place. And finally the Faith of the <hi>Romans</hi> was and is such, that e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven in the Apostles times, it was preached through the world, that is to say in that part only then styled <hi>Roman</hi> before twas Christianiz'd <hi>Rome,</hi> then (which in greek imports strength, in hebrew Greatness) being the most worthy place of the whole world, with good reason in her and not elsewhere, ought the Jubile to be celebra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted.</p>

                  <head>The Narration of <hi>STEPHANO PIG<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>HIO</hi> touching those military Ensignes, which the Pope useth to bestow on tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poral Princes. CHAP. XIII.</head>
                  <p>THE <hi>Roman</hi> Bishop useth to bestow great honour on Princes, which for all that doth seldom happen, from the rarity of the occasions for which they are sought. This custom was most antient, begun with the foundation of the holy scripture in the history of the <hi>Maccabees</hi> (part of our <hi>Apocrypha</hi>) as we read in the 15th. Chapter of the second book of <hi>Maccabees:</hi> That <hi>Judas</hi> the Captain of the Israelite Army before he came to battail against <hi>Nica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nor,</hi> saw in a Vision <hi>Onias</hi> the high Priest, holding up his hands towards Heaven, and praying for the whole people of the Jews: and <hi>Jeremias</hi> the Prophet, giving unto him the said <hi>Judas</hi> a sword of gold exhorting him to give battail in these words: Take this holy sword a gift from God, wherewith thou shalt wound thy adversaries, wherewith <hi>Judas</hi> being comforted, drew to battail on the sabbath against the Enemies, and behaved himself so well, that he slew not less then thirty five thousand Men, with <hi>Nicanor</hi> their Captain and so remained victorious. Hence then proceeds the custome, that the <hi>Roman</hi> high Priest every yeer, the night before the Nativity, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore he begins the Duties, blesseth and consecrateth a sword, with the scabbard, the belt, and the pummel of gold, and a hat placed on the top of it, not made after the common sort, of Felt, but of the finest blew silk, with the whitest Ermine skinns round about it, and a Crown of gold enterwoven all over and set out with Jewels of good value. This is a noble donative wch. the Pope provides only of that night, to bestow it upon some Christian Prince, who either hath done or is to undertake some notable impress for the Christian Reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gion:
<pb n="241" facs="tcp:62973:135"/>
nor is this without mysteries, but hath many, the which eve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry Christian Prince ought to know, and consider.</p>
                  <p>The <hi>Roman Rivale</hi> teacheth us, that the sword so consecrated, tipifies the infinite power of God, which is in the eternal word, wherewith God hath created all things: Which word on that night put on human flesh, and to which the Father Eternal gave all Power, as himself declared about the time of his Ascention into heaven, and then consigned it to Saint Peter, and to his successors, whose duty tis to govern that holy Church then newly by him instituted, and consecrated with his own blood, against which hell should not pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vail: Commanding that they should teach all those things which were learned from him, and to invite and intreat, all Nations (through Baptism and the Gospel) to enter this new City, out of which there is no salvation, and in which they must obey the Laws of the divine Empire. Who is not surprized with consideration of the dispensations of God, in the divine Majesties election of this Ci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty <hi>Rome,</hi> for the head and bulwark of the Christian Republique, which was upon the point at that time Head and Lady of the whole world. Whence Saint <hi>Peter</hi> the Governour of the first Church was destinated to this Province, and twas commanded to him, that the Cross should Triumph in the <hi>Campidoglio,</hi> to the end that thereby and thence the light of eternal truth might with the more facility be dispersed into all parts.</p>
                  <p>By the sword then thus consecrated is denoted that Empire, and that supreme power of government upon Earth, which Christ left to Saint <hi>Peter</hi> his Vicar, and to his successors; and that the <hi>Roman</hi> Bishop ought to be acknowledged for the head of Christianity, whom, all those that tender their own Salvation, ought to obey and serve in spirituals for the love of Christ.</p>
                  <p>Furthermore that sword signifies, what prudence, and Justice, e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>very Prince ought to observe, and because the sharp point wounds where tis thrust on by the hand, therefore the handle of this sword is adorned with gold, a metal which amongst the Antients impor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted Wisdom, whereby the Prince ought to learn, that near his hands wisdome must have her seate, that so he may not transact any thing rashly, nor without due consideration, Gold hath been taken for the Symbol of Wisdome, from her similitude in Excellency, for as the one surpasseth and mastereth all metals in goodness and value, so Prudence or Wisdome, as we may say, surpasseth and overcometh all other things, And this caused <hi>Solomon</hi> in his proverbs to make his exhortation saying, My Son possess thou Wisdome, which is better than Gold, and get thou Prudence, for this is more pretious than Silver, Saint John in the <hi>Apocalyps</hi> calleth wisdome enflamed Gold, which penetiates the breast with the ardour of the holy Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit. The <hi>Magi</hi> offered Gold to Christ then an Infant, and the <hi>Egyp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tians</hi> were despoyled of their Gold by the <hi>Israelites,</hi> the one and the other thereby signifying, Wisdome in a mistical sence; and twas so in truth spoken literally as our histories relate <hi>Plato</hi> (whose doctrine did not much disagree from the Christian) often compares Wisdome and the Beauty of the mind to pure gold. Finally the Aunt and Gryphen of <hi>India</hi> signified no other thing wch. <hi>Animals</hi> (as antiquity feigned) got together as much gold as possibly they could and after<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards
<pb n="242" facs="tcp:62973:136"/>
kept it with diligence: even so Wisdome is not to be had without labour, and noblenesse of mind; the Aunt here being an embleme of a laborious Creature, and the Gryffen (feigned to pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceed from the copulation of an Eagle and a Lyon) here represents the greatness of mind. Whence the same antients wisely and pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perly dedicated the Aunt and the Gryffen to <hi>Apollo</hi> the God of wis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome.</p>
                  <p>Moreover the sword signifies the Tongue, the best and worst member in Man, as it happens to be imployed: and therefore the antient said, that evil spoken men carryed a sword in their mouth: and <hi>Diogenes</hi> the Cynick, seeing a fair young man to speak dishone<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stly, sayed to him, art thou not ashamed, to draw a sword of Lead out of an ivory scabbard? and in <hi>Isaiah</hi> we read <hi>Posuit os meum quasi gladium acutum:</hi> and Christ in the Gospel saies. <hi>Non veni pacem mit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tere sed gladium,</hi> where we see, that by the sword is intended the word preached from God; and so in other places of Scripture un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der the name word, is comprehended the tongue or the sword wherefore aptly also to our purpose it may receive the same signifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cation, the Pope giving to understand to Princes, that they in par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticular ought to have their tongue and speech adorned with Gold, that is to say clothed with wisdom and prudence, with which sword they ought to separate the good thoughts from the bad, and by their wise counsels to penetrate and see into the very hearts of o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers.</p>
                  <p>To this misterious sword the holy Pope adjoyns a belt interwo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven with gold, which even of old was a sign of Majesty and military dignity: well then may the Prince (on whom tis bestowed) appre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hend the exhortation by it given him, to demean himself well for the holy Church against all factions.</p>
                  <p>The Hat, which is the covering of the head, the most noble part of man, is an Ensigne of nobility and liberty, which hat also an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiently was wont to be made in the form of a half sphere, as twere one part of a great egg divided just in the midst, but in later times our modern ar<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">
                        <desc>•…</desc>
                     </gap>ificers not apprehending the significations, or willing to fructifie humours, make it after another fashion. Its round form putting us in minde of Heaven, by which we are covered, and ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viseth the Prince, to direct all his actions to the glory of God, and the benefit of his soul, for whose eternal dwelling were the Heavens made: the celestial colour of the said hat denotes the same thing.</p>
                  <p>The white colour of the skins and the Pearl, signifies that since<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity and purity of the mind wherewith the Prince ought to be en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dowed, to the end he may in the end accomplish a concomitance with those most sacred minds, the wch to that time he hath or ought to have endeavoured to imitate with all clearness of conscience. The Colour white, hath been alwaies esteemed gratefull to the Almigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty, being a mark of Inocency &amp; therfore from great antiquity all men in the duty of sacrifice used to cloth themselves therwith; <hi>Pythagoras</hi> his sentence is, that every white thing is good. Fully in his second book <hi>De legibus</hi> saies, that white is very agreeable to God. We might also bring testimonies to this purpose from <hi>Cicero</hi> and others, but to what end should we search prophane authors: since Christ himself
<pb n="243" facs="tcp:62973:136"/>
in his glorious Transfiguration made himself obvious to many, clo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thed with rayments white as snow: and the Angels also who were at the sepulchre of our Lord the morning of his resurrection day, when the women went to seek after the most holy body, presented themselves in whitegarments: from the above specified records the Prince is advised of the nature of that Animal the Ermine, off which those skins are taken, for the Ermine is infinitly neat, and enemie to filthiness and durt, in so much that the mouth of their Cave being environed by the hunters with dirt, they do rather expose themselvs to be taken then to run for their escape through dirt to defile them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves.</p>
                  <p>All which things then advise us. That God does expect in us, Cleaness of heart, sincerity of tongue, wisedom of mind, elevation of the understanding and prudence in our actions. whereof his Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>linesse by that beatified sword adorned in the aforecited manner, in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tends to give the Prince a continual remembrance, that in goodness and works he ought to surpasse all other sort of people in an emi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nent degree, begin by the omnipotent God in the government of the world made so much superiour to all other People.</p>
                  <p>The Prince at the reception of this gift, kneels down, and the Pope then gives it him, exhorting him by many expressions to be a good souldier of Christ: Then the Prince acknowledging the Pope as Vicar of God returns his thanks in Latin, swearing that he will not lay any thing more to heart, then a correspondence by his acti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, with the desire of his holiness, and all other Christian Princes: afterwards he delivers the Sword to his most noble and chief Mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ster who bears it before the Cross while the Pope goes out of the Ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stry. At last, having had a congratulation from the Cardinals and Embassadors, and taken leave, the Prince with the sword born up before him, being accompanyed by the Governors of the Castle, Saint <hi>Angelo,</hi> by the Comptrolor of the Pallace, by all the Nobility, by the Pontifical Family, and the <hi>Palatine</hi> Court, with great Pomp and the sounding of Trumpets and noise of Drumms, he marcheth out of the Palace by the military Porticue, thus attended to his own Dwelling.</p>

                     <p>The City therefore may be well esteemed secure, since so well provided for by art, with all those Forts bulwarks, &amp;c. and by nature, by its own scituation, having contiguous with it, that <hi>Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>montory</hi> as twere hanging over it, and almost round it the waters of the Sea, being as twere in a <hi>Peninsula,</hi> having but a narrow <hi>Isth<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mus</hi> to come to it by Land, excellently defended by a bridge, a Gate, a Fort, and the Sea waters on each side.</p>
                     <p>The <hi>Promontory</hi> shews it self with two Heads, on that side regar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding the <hi>Mediterranean,</hi> lies the City on the plainest and levelled part, on the other Cliffs, Rocks, and Praecipices which extend into the Sea; tis open from top to bottom, occasioned by a great earth<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quake, and that a long time since, such many times happening in these parts of Italy.

<pb n="253" facs="tcp:62973:141"/>
that it may be said to be sustained by a miracle between the broken walls of the opening, where it begins to narrow. There <hi>Ferdinand</hi> King of <hi>Arragonia,</hi> erected a fair Chappel, dedicating it to the <hi>S. S. Trinita,</hi> which appears as in the Sea, and they go to it from the mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nastery by a way made with hands in the rupture of the Mountain: the broken stones on one side, and the hollowed places whence they fell on the other, when tom out by the earthquake, afford an enticing object.</p>
                     <p>Among other things there worth a view, is a shrine made by <hi>Charls</hi> of <hi>Bourbon,</hi> a famous though wicked Captain of later times, who in the bloody assault and sack of <hi>Rome</hi> dyed of a wound from a gun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>shot: The bones of this bad man, are enclosed in a chest or coffin of wood covered with black silk, and are obvious at the first en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trance of the Castle in an eminent place: under it may be read this Epitaph.

                  <p>From which a Chronologer may collect, it is of neare sixteen hun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dred yeers standing, and built in the time of <hi>Augustus Caesar:</hi> which for its entirenesse on every side of the sea seems a miracle, the people now call it <hi>Torre Orlandina,</hi> the reward of the rustickness of posterity, who little regarding the antiquity of history, originate the works and famous deeds of their ancestors, at their own time, and attri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bute them to whom they please. This Fabrick is of an orbicular sorm, and seems to be made of the same architect as is that of <hi>Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tellus</hi> the Son of <hi>Quintus Creticus</hi> in the <hi>Strada Appia:</hi> being compo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed of two rounds or circles of solid wall, the outmost whereof built with great square stones contains in the diameter 28. paces or 84 foot whence may be deduced the great largenesse of the Sepulchre, by reducing the Line of the Diametre into a Circle: nor does the heighth seem lesse, for as much as the eye can judge of measure: being rai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed

by 27 stones placed one above another, of a foot and half in thicknesse; on the top of which is layed a Crown figured out of the raies or battlements of the walls, pompously adorned with the ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mies armes and spoiles.</p>
                  <p>At the entrance of the gate is a space of seven foot wide, made out of the in ward Circle, all small manufacture of bricks, and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>joined with the walls without with a high Arch: and that inclosed by other high Arches represents in the middle of the <hi>Mauseolum</hi> the form of a round Temple, which hath foure large receptacles for pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>serving of statues. The inward walls seem to be pargetted most neatly like marble, giving a lustre so shining and white that it seems like glass, and tis supposed that the reflection of the snow which is beaten in, redoubles the light: there being no other entrance for any then at the door, which of it self cannot sufficiently enlight<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>en the place: over the door may be plainly read the title of <hi>Lucius Plancus</hi> the Orator, with an elogie of his enterprises, as fairely en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>graven as if writ on a Tablet: whereof take the exact copy drawn out by <hi>Corona Pighio,</hi> the best corrected of any other.

                     <p>To return to <hi>Naples:</hi> tis a City at this time no lesse famous for the nobility and magnificence of her Citizens &amp; inhabitants, then for the vast expence, and for the beauty of the structures of all sorts: for that the Governors of the Emperor <hi>Charls<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
                        </hi> the 5th and after them of <hi>Philip</hi> King of <hi>Spain,</hi> of later yeers Presidents or Viceroyes, in the Kingdome of <hi>Naples,</hi> have wonderfully enlarged and forti fied her with a new wall, bul wark, Ditches, Towers, Castles; in so much that she is now almost invincible. She is furthermore full of regard for the many and magnificent Churches, Colledges, Courts Palaces of Princes and other great Men, as also for many old re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liques of antient houses, Epitaphs, Statues, Sepulchres, Collumns, Altars, Marbles with most artificial and fair engravings, and other things, which to recite would take up too much Room here.</p>

                     <p>The Churches of our Religion, are there in excellent order and rich, as well as many: and so well placed, as pleasant flowers for beautifying a Garden.

In the Church of <hi>San Giovanni dalla Car boniera</hi> is the Sepulchre of King <hi>Roberto,</hi> whose praises were writ by all learned men, among the rest by <hi>Petrarcha</hi> and <hi>Boccaccio.</hi> In that of <hi>S.

Where once in the yeer at least they shew one by one, all those worthy objects: as bones of Saints and other Reliques enclosed in gold and Silver with pretious stones, with the pretious gifts bestowed by Kings and Princes, and other things. Among which with great re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verence, is the head of <hi>S.

Thence you go to the <hi>Annunci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ata,</hi> a Church famous through the great devotion there exercised, and rich through the many offerings made to it: as also for many reliques of Saints of importance, among others two small bodies of a foot and half long, yet entire, covered with the skins of in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nocent Children slain by <hi>Herode</hi> the King, at the time our Saviour was born in <hi>Bethlehem,</hi> the wound of one is in the head, the other in the breast.</p>

the poorer sort, more than eight hundred, between orphane and ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>posed infants as well males as females: instructed in letters and art, according to their inclination till they become great. 'Tis a plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sure to see and observe their several diligent exercises and works: and this custome of Christian Charity is certainly very comodious, which as <hi>Corona Pighius</hi> observes, resembles <hi>Platoes</hi> Republique in part, and imitates that Economical government of the Apes, de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>scribed by <hi>Xenefonte,</hi> and by <hi>Virgil</hi> the Prince of Poets, described and de painted so well to the similitude of <hi>Platoes</hi> City.</p>
                     <p>Castle <hi>Nuovo,</hi> the name is new although built more then 300 yeers since by the Brother of <hi>San Lodovico,</hi> King of France, who was <hi>Charls</hi> the first King of <hi>Naples</hi> and Count of <hi>Anjou,</hi> to the end he might thence aid the City and the Port against the maritimate inroads of enemies. <hi>Alfonsus</hi> the first of this name, King of the <hi>Arragonians,</hi> re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stored it within our memory, after he had expelled the French, and subdued the Kingdom; and so well fortifyed it, that tis now held one of the strongest Forts of <hi>Italy:</hi> more especially since the last Kings, the Emperor <hi>Charls</hi> the 5th. and <hi>Philip</hi> his Son com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pleatly furnished it, and all the other Forts of this City, with victu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>als, good souldiers, and all other necessaries and engines of war to keep off the Enemy.</p>
                     <p>In the midst of this large Castle, stands the pompous Palace of the governors, furnished with royal and most lovely houshold-stuff wherein the King or Emperor may find a comodious receipt for all his Court: strangers are astonisht at the engines of war, the Artil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lery, the great quantity of Iron Bullets, the murrions inlayed with gold and Silver, the Shields, the swords, the Launces, and the other preparation for war there continually preserved. and that admiration becomes much lessened, at the view of the said palace so richly laden with tapistry of silk interwoven with Jewels and gold, the engraving, the statues, pictures and the other noble furniture.</p>
                     <p>Thence you may see the Castle <hi>Del'ovo,</hi> so named for that the shelf which there in largeth it self to the similitude of an Island, retains an oval form. <hi>Collanutius</hi> writes that this Fort was built by <hi>William</hi> the third a <hi>Norman,</hi> and thence called <hi>Normannica,</hi> which afterwards <hi>Alfonsus</hi> the first King of the <hi>Arragonians,</hi> repaired and beautifyed in many things: tis said that the antient called this by a greek word <hi>Miagra,</hi> either from a salutatiferous plant there growing, or from the site and quality of the place, or for that twas difficult to escape out of it: This Mole is like an artificial street casting it self into the Sea, whither all the gentry in the evening resort for the benefit of the <hi>Fresco.</hi>

                     <p>There gusheth out at one end of the Mole a fountain of sweet water, conveighed thither through the midst of the said Bank; this fountain hath much marble under it, wherein the water is received, the name is drawn from a Latin word, the foundations are known to have been layed by <hi>Charls</hi> the second the <hi>French</hi> King above two hundred and eighty yeers ago: which <hi>Alfonsus</hi> the first a <hi>Spaniard,</hi> amplified with all magnificence afterwards as well as many other publique edifices within the City: this fancy also <hi>Charls</hi> the 5th. Emperor, and <hi>Philip</hi> his Son took up, in augmenting, fortifying and furnishing the same for its commodity and ornament, without respect to the expence.</p>
                     <p>Hither the mariners in little boats row persons to see the Galleys and the life of the slaves with their arts, who from the want of bread learn to speak with the words of the Poet <hi>Perseus, Venter Magister,</hi> &amp;c. and sitting, exercise themselves; together with the munition and naval preparations for war: here in a little time may be learnt the mariners art, with their manner of living, wherewith they keep their bodies in health, and the offices and charges of the Presidents of the Vessels: thence you go to see the denoted stables of the King, where are kept and managed whole heards of beautifull and va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>luable horses, where some Princes are always to be found, behol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding with attention and delight, their swift course, their wheelings, and turnings, made in as little room, and with as much art as is possible, their curvets and leaps of all four performed excellently at the nod of the switch of the Rider.</p>
                     <p>Thence you go to the Castle <hi>Santermo,</hi> on the top of the near mountain, very strong, looking on and defending, the City, the shore Port and Islands in the Sea: King <hi>Robert</hi> Son of <hi>Charls</hi> the second built it 250 yeers agoe, adding to it such strength and defences as render it little lesse than inexpugnable, the Emperor <hi>Charls</hi> the first and <hi>Philip</hi> his Son some years since enlarged the <hi>Guasto,</hi> conjoyning it with the City, and increasing the structures in the inward space with new walls and new forts.</p>
                     <p>On the top of the Hill you meet a most fair and rich Temple with a stately Monastery possessed by the <hi>Carthusians;</hi> In which Monaste<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry if you can obtain so much favour from the Monks (who loving<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly receive forraigners and shew their Monasterie) you will meet an ample satisfaction in the view of the Monks chamber in a corner of the Monastery: where you have as great delight as <hi>Italy</hi> affords: for on the right hand is presented to your view, the prospect of the Sea, as large as the eye can reach, the Islands <hi>Enarea, Caprea,</hi> and <hi>Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chite</hi> and opposite the manured places of <hi>Pausilipo,</hi> the gulf of <hi>Surre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nio,</hi> the streight of <hi>Surrentano,</hi> some Cities and many Burroughs:

On the left hand the Field <hi>Holana,</hi> very large, and the mountain <hi>Vesuvius</hi> as high; then looking downwards, you behold <hi>Naples,</hi> which, whither to be styled the miracle of art or nature is disputable, since there you may see, have and enjoy, what ever is esteemed pleasing or sweet.</p>

Tis hideous to behold the deep cracks in the earth through which the streams of sulphur pass, but when arrived at top the <hi>Vo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rago</hi> represents hell, so terrifying is the spectacle; Tis a hole about three miles compass and round, as if formed like the middle and lower part of an Amphitheatre, tis called <hi>Lazza</hi> from the form of the Rock Fish, the bottom of it reaches to the bowels of the Earth, The place is cold now, nor seems it to emit the least heat or smoak which the said <hi>Pighius</hi> testifies, who descended as far into that pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fundity as the the precipices and obscurity of the place would per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mit; the first entrance of the <hi>Vorago,</hi> is fertile through the earth and ashes cast on it, and growes green through the firre and other great trees growing in it, as far as the Sun can reflect into it, or the rains penetrate; but the parts under, restrained to a narrow compass are as twere stopped by the great pieces of stone and rocks, and arms and bodies of trees fallen down: which obstructions, when the in ward Materials of fire abound, like little bundles of straw are easily raised and mounted to the skyes, by the invincible force of its smoake or flames.</p>
                     <p>The fire also is known to open it self a way, not only by the ordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nary mouth, but on other sides also, as occasion offers; whereof we have a memorial in the <hi>Italian</hi> Annales: To wit that two hun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dred sixty and six yeers since, in the Pontificacy of <hi>Benedict</hi> the 9th. from one side of the Mountain gushed out a stream or river of flames which ran into the Sea, in a liquid fire like water: the issue and footsteps of which Cavern tis said appear yet: The <hi>Roman</hi> Histo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry tells us that besides the mouth, it had other issues and courses for the flames of old: for instance, it saies that <hi>Spartacus</hi> the sword<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>player having begun to raise the war of the <hi>Fugitives</hi> against the <hi>Ro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mans</hi> in <hi>Campania,</hi> and having possessed the mountain <hi>Vesuvius</hi> with his army, as a strong fortress and sure retreat for war, and being there afterwards besieged, he escaped from the <hi>Roman</hi> siege by an admirable way: for that covertly fastning chains at the mouth of the Mountain, he with his companions let themselves down to the bottom: (as <hi>L.

The cause of which dust is easily known to proceed from the exclusion of the wind and rain, so that the raised dust (as <hi>Seneca</hi> saies) having no Vent falls down on it self, or on those that raise it: whence we collect that in the time of <hi>Nero</hi> this cavern had no Casements or breathings whereby it might receive air or light, more then at the entrance and end, because <hi>Seneca</hi> calls it a long and obscure prison, where nothing is to be seen but darkness. Yet <hi>Cornelius Strabo</hi> testifies, by the riving or chops of the Mountain in divers places, that many win<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dows gave it light, which being closed or earthed up, either through the earthquakes or the carelesness of the times, we may rationally imagine, rendred this longcavern so darksom. <hi>Pietro Rassano</hi> a <hi>Sici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lian</hi> Bishop of <hi>Lucerie</hi> writes, that in his time, which we may count to be above 250. yeers since, this cavern was found without any holes, and without light, and that the entrance and the out-passage were so filled up with ruines and bushes, that twas terrible to enter without light: and that therefore the King of the <hi>Arragoni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans Alfonsus</hi> the first, having reduced this Province, enlarged and levelled the way and the entrance of the Caverne, and closing the top of the Cavern opened two lights, which obliquely enlighten it, whose reflection at a distance seems to the aspicients, snow scatte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red on the earth: in the midst of this darksome way is a little sacred place cut in the walls of the mountain, where night and day a lamp perpetually burns, which puts the travellers in re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>membrance

Divers are the opini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons of the learned touching the time and beginning of this great work worthy of the mind of <hi>Serse:</hi> omitting the idle prating of the vulgar who attribute it to the magick incantations of the Poet <hi>Virgil,</hi> whose ashes by the opinion of many ly at the mouth of the Cavern: or of others who make one <hi>Basso</hi> the author, of whom there is no record among the antients: we beleive we may draw from <hi>Strabo, Eforus, Homerus</hi> and other greek writers, that the <hi>Cimmerij</hi> a most antient people dwelt in that <hi>Canton</hi> of <hi>Campania,</hi> between <hi>Baio, Lucerno,</hi> and <hi>Averno,</hi> and that they lay in denns and <hi>subterranean</hi> Caves, and that running the one to the other they dug out metals, and hollow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed mountains, and in profound Caverns exercised (by means of their Priests,) Negromancy and inchantments, conducting tra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vellers, and pilgrims to the oracles of the infernal gods: which people being destroyed, the <hi>Greeks,</hi> who succeeded them and built <hi>Cuma</hi> and <hi>Naples,</hi> accommodated as most suppose those Caves of the <hi>Cimmerii</hi> into hot baths, and baths, ways and other conveniences for humane use. So likewise the <hi>Romans,</hi> after the example of the <hi>Grecians,</hi> being chiefly enclined to great and magnificent impreses encreased these laborious under-ground structures, and at the time when they became the Lords of the world, they there erected their Palaces of Recreation, and Mannor houses little inferiour to Castles when the rare quality of the dust of <hi>Pozzuolo</hi> was discovered (ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tracted from those mountains) to be very efficacious for binding, building, and establishing foundations of Edifices in the waters. <hi>Stra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bo</hi> affirms that in his time <hi>M. Agrippa</hi> under <hi>Augustus,</hi> cutting up the wood on the mountain <hi>Avernus,</hi> which corrupted the air, among the other antique &amp; magnificent things found out a <hi>subterranean</hi> ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vern hollowed even to <hi>Cuma,</hi> the which as was conjectured, together with another between <hi>Naples</hi> and <hi>Pozzuolo,</hi> was made by one <hi>Cocceio;</hi> and that in his time the custom of the Countrey was to make such underground waies and Caverns: from whose words we collect, that for a long time before <hi>Strabo,</hi> the <hi>Cocceian</hi> family were got toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther in <hi>Campania,</hi> and that the place was called <hi>Spelonca</hi> though for truth we cannot set down any thing of certain of him that first made it: nor is it probable to me, that <hi>Strabo</hi> could be ignorant of the deeds of <hi>L. Lucullus,</hi> the which in those places were very great and of excessive expence, from which he was called <hi>Serse Togato,</hi> by <hi>Pompeius Magnus,</hi> by <hi>Tuberone,</hi> by <hi>Cicero,</hi> and the other princi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pal men of <hi>Rome:</hi> wherefore their sence pleaseth me, who impose on him the concavating the <hi>Pausilipus</hi> for the conveniency of his
<pb n="274" facs="tcp:62973:152"/>
                     <hi>Villa:</hi> because tis written by <hi>Marcus Varro, Pliny,</hi> and others, that <hi>L. Lucullus</hi> cut a mountain in the midst of <hi>Naples,</hi> with greater cost, then he expended in building his Manor house: for to what end should he? not to level and accomodate the way for passengers: but rather to open a gulfe of the Sea. whereby at his pleasure to ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mit and let in Sea water to his Fishponds that so the caves of the mountain might be a good receipt for his Fish (which he kept alive) to lye in as well in Winter as Summer.</p>
                  <p>At the outgoing of this Cavern, you perceive by little &amp; little the odour of brimstone in the air, which here and there proceeds out of divers vaults. By it lies the Lake <hi>Aniano,</hi> in similitude of an Am<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phitheatre surrounded and shut in on all sides by the Mountains, and through a mouth of a hill cut with iron great plenty of Sea wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tet, and great concaves, made ponds for Fish, at present filled with mud, sand, and ruines of structures: <hi>Leandro</hi> and others write from the relation of the peasants there, that in the midst of the Lake there is no mud: and that in the spring time, with great noyse &amp; fury fall down from the highest praecipices of the rocks there round in to these waters Knots of Serpents knit and bound together, which are never seen again to get out.</p>
                  <p>Near them are the sweating Rooms of <hi>Germanus</hi> vaulted: from under which, through the superficies rise vapours so hot, that who enters though naked, shall soon perceive a mighty sweat trickle down his body.</p>
                  <p>Wherefore those places are held of exceeding validity to such as suffer under the gout by purging the bad and malevolent humours, they heal internal wounds, and are helpfull for many infirmities of the body: which if any desire ampler satisfaction in, he may read the Tract of <hi>Gio Francesco Lombardo,</hi> who gives an account of all such as have writ in verse or prose of the baths and wonders of <hi>Pozzuolo</hi> but we are obliged to too much hast, to relate with care and ampli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tude all particulars wee meet with.</p>
                  <p>In the <hi>Campagnia</hi> of <hi>Pozzuolo, Baia, Cuma,</hi> and the near Island <hi>Ena<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rie,</hi> by the old <hi>Greeks</hi> called <hi>Pythecus,</hi> are found great quantity of the like Miracles, that it might be well beleived that there na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture serves <hi>Apollo</hi> perpetually, and <hi>AEsculapius, Higia,</hi> and the <hi>Nymphs:</hi> although the earthquakes, and the volleys of fire which frequently happen, demonstrate sufficiently that in divers places, that as well under the foundation of the Sea, as under the Mountains, and in the lowest parts of the Earth great fires are kindled, whose boyling vapours and flames working their own way through the veins of Allum, sulphure, pitch and other materials, cause to rise in divers places hot and boyling fountains, and create baths in the Caverns comodious for sweating. Yet the nature and faculty of these things are different, being conformed to the propriety of the materials and the earth whence the source proceeds: so that among the medicinal and healthfull faculty of these waters, we find some waters and vapours mortal, which issue out of some muddy earth, evil in it self. <hi>Pliny</hi> in the second of his natural Histories writes, that in <hi>Italy,</hi> and particularly in the <hi>Campagna</hi> of <hi>Si<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">

All men generally believe this Grotta to have such an innate proper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty that if any living thing should pass the prefixed term of a cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain ditch in the entrance, it would without doubt sudden<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly fall upon the earth, and would be wholly deprived of life, if not immediately drawn out, and cast into the near standing waters or pool, called <hi>Agnano,</hi> by whose coldness only in a short time by lit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle and little it recovers Life. Whereof Travellers dayly make ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>periments, if curious to know the wonders of nature, by casting in cocks or dogs or some other live creature to which they fasten a rope to draw them up by. <hi>Leandro Alberto</hi> writes that <hi>Charls</hi> the eighth King of <hi>France,</hi> when a hundred and 14. yeers since he drove out the Spanish and for some time Lorded over <hi>Naples,</hi> caused an Asse to be driven in, who suddenly whirled about and dyed.</p>
                  <p>Another who two hundred yeers since wrote of these baths, re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lates, that a foot hardy rash Souldier, run in armed and dyed mise<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rably: <hi>Corona Pighio</hi> writes, that in the presence of <hi>Charls</hi> Prince of <hi>Cleves,</hi> the Spanish Captains cast two cheerfull dogs by force into the <hi>Grotta:</hi> who strove all possible to avoid it, as if they had formerly ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perimented the danger; the which being taken out dead, by means of the refreshing waters in the aforenamed Lake were restored to life: one of which being again cast into the cave, and being thence drawn &amp; cast into the Lake, returning not thereby to Life, was left for dead on the bank, who not long after as waking from a profound sleep raising himself, and limping and staggering, so soon as possible, ran away, every one that saw it smiled, and <hi>Charls</hi> praised the dog, that he would not for that time become a victime to the beares; after this tryal they cast a brands end lighted into the <hi>Grotta,</hi> beyond the prefixed sign, which come to the bottom seemed to extinguish, and raised up a little higher, to rekindle: which demonstrated that the spirits proceeding from the superficies, as more hot and dry in the bottom, consumed the more subtil nutriment of the flame, but having lesse vigour at more distance from the foundation, they rather rekindle the hot and gross smoke and flames of the brands<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>end: as we see the flame of a lighted candle will pass to another newly put out, by means of the so oke; and the beams of the Sun when united by a burning glass, are very vigorous and will set tow or flax on fire if approached too near. <hi>Pighius</hi> through his exceed<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing love to study, travialing over <hi>Italy,</hi> and having an extream desire to inquire into the nature of all things by which he might acquire knowledge, wondring at the reports of the miracles of <hi>Pozzuolo,</hi>

                  <p>He could not beleive that those drops that hung so resplendent at the end of the Caverne, were quick-silver: wherefore being coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selled by a certain juvenile and youthfull audacity, he passed the proposed measure in the Cavern; having enclined his body a little and getting somewhat nearer, he found they were drops of clear water, and taking them on his finger from the sharp pendent of the rock, he demonstrated the truth to his companions, requi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring them either to beleive or enter and make proof.</p>
                  <p>Which also happened: for that <hi>Antonio Anistelo,</hi> and <hi>Arnoldio Niveldio,</hi> two <hi>Holandesi,</hi> noble youths and companions in the jour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ney with <hi>Pighius,</hi> got near: who when he had for some time stood in the Cave, and perceived the heat, how it ascended from his feet to his leggs and knees, yet underwent no other then a giddiness and pain in his head; and sweat only on the forehead and the tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ples through the heat of the place: he learnt by experience that that heat, and those nocive vapours are not lusty and violent, but when near their rise; and there they kill small animals or great, but chiefly the four footed, because they alwayes go with their head downwards, whereby being necessitated to draw in with their breath those hot and boyling vapours, their vital spirits become suddenly suffocated with too much heat: the which also are as suddenly releived by the imediate refreshment of the waters in the Lake, if the animal be forthwith cast therein when drawn out of the Cavern. Whilst <hi>Pighius</hi> was performing this, an <hi>Italian</hi> who guarded some herds wondred strangely at his temerity, and remained astonisht at the success, many times demanding if he did it not by the magick art, nor would he be perswaded that <hi>Pighius</hi> could avoyd the nocivenesse of that <hi>Grotta,</hi> otherwise then by en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chantment or witch craft: which made him mock at the <hi>plebeian</hi> simplicity, laughing at the vulgar, who for the most part attribute that to the Magick art, which appears wonderfull, and produceth stupendious effects, from their incapacity to comprehend the cause: but to return to our voyage.</p>

                  <p>These Mountains are full of Sulphure, Allum, and Vitriol, the chief whereof as <hi>Strabo</hi> writes, stood pendent at a few paces di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stance from the <hi>Colonna</hi> of <hi>Pozzuolo</hi> now distant from the castle <hi>Novo,</hi> about a mile: from the form of which place, tis guessed, that the top of this Mountain was at last consumed and emitted into the profundity of the near valley by the continual fires, whence that which of old was a high and eminent top or head, is now a great ditch in the plain of a valley and that which was of old the ribs and
<pb n="277" facs="tcp:62973:153"/>
flanks of a mountain, are now the upper part of shelfs and rocks, which surround the plain, with a certain fence in length about a thousand and fifty foot, in bredth about a thousand foot: <hi>Pliny</hi> writes that they were nominated from their whiteness <hi>Leucogei,</hi> and the plain or Level, <hi>Campagna Phlegerea,</hi> from the flame and fire there ever extant: which <hi>Silius</hi> the Italian confirms.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Cornelius Strabo</hi> calls this place the <hi>Piazza</hi> and shop of <hi>Vulcan,</hi> where likewise some fable, the Gyants to be overcome by <hi>Hercules:</hi> here the Mountains seem continually to burn at their roots: for that on all sides they emit smokes by many mouths which smell of sulphure which smokes are blowen by the wind all over the neighbouring Countrey, and sometimes to <hi>Naples.</hi> Antiently these Hills, as we draw from <hi>Dion Cassius</hi> and <hi>Strabo</hi> emitted greater fires, as also those about the <hi>Lucrino,</hi> and <hi>Averno,</hi> which are not a few, burnt and e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitted like furnaces gross smokes and flames. Now the plain as also the hill <hi>Phlegrei</hi> are deprived of their perpetual flames and are caver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nous in many places and become yellowish, as from the materiall and colour of sulphure: the earth when spurned by the foot, re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sounds like a drum, through its concavity underneath, where you may hear (with wonder) under your seet boyling waters, grosse and inflamed smokes to make a horrid noise, and run too and fro through the subterranean Caverns, which the force of the exhala<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion hath made, which how great you may thence guesse; stop any of those mouths or holes, with a good great stone, and you shall suddenly and with violence see it amoved by the strength of the smoke. Here they compose medicinable pots of brim<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stone.</p>
                  <p>In the same plain or level lies also a great marish filled alwaies with a black scalding hot water: which sometimes useth to change place, and the waters making themselves hard (as tryed sewit useth being cold to bind it self to the sides of the Vessel tis melted in) do thereby and with the force of the exhalation increase or diminish. When I was there it boyled with great noise and smoke, as if it had been a huge chauldron filled with blackish mud, and therefore ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceeded not then its bounds and limits: but I remember, that at my view thereof, this <hi>Vorago</hi> mounted and cast up of asudden like a <hi>Pyramides,</hi> eight or nine foot high, (beyond the common stature of man,) that thick water yellow and of the colour of sulphure: which also the people of <hi>Pozzuolo</hi> affirm, adding that sometimes twill rise from sixteen to twenty four feet.</p>
                  <p>When the Sea is in a storm, this water is of various colours; though for the most part like sulphure, and sometimes other, accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding as the subterranean winds are disturbed by the sea blasts, and being in vigoured among the flames, with all possible force expels some of the earth mixed with divers colours from the deepest veins. These very winds, when most quiet under ground, the top of the Fens or moors being only disturbed, cause a gross thick water, co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>loured with black to be cast out. These things of such occult na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, do certainly afford usefull and welcome matter for considera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion and study to such as love to search thereinto; which <hi>Cicero</hi> ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry pertinently terms, the natural food of the mind. And hence we certainly know, that the globe of the earth is not in every part so<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lid,

self in the fashion of a bow, reached the shore and the <hi>Avernus,</hi> and so defended the place from the raging force and storms of the Sea, whose haughtinesse was comodiously bridled by means of those Moles.</p>

In which we see sitting places for washing, baths, lakes, and tables for eating: be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing within full of grotts, waies and edifices arched, here and there sustained by frequent pillars, part built with brick, part cut out of the same rock; among which edifices the biggest conservatory of the waters called vulgarly <hi>Grotta Dragonacia</hi> is admi rable, as are the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veyances into it: for the rain waters descending from the Promonto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry; the which <hi>Grotta</hi> is capable of many thousand butts, being large beyond measure, and twnety five foot deep: the largness not be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to be measured, for that the vaults and ruines fallen into it have filled many parts of it: all these conservatories are incrusted or plaistered with a certain hard composition used by the antients for rendring them tenable of the waters, so that none could pass nor soak thorough: the inward space between the walls, is two hundred foot long, and eighteen broad: having four doors through which is entrance into four great chambers: near these are other conserves different in artifice and grandeur.</p>

The <hi>Piscina Mirabili</hi> or Pool for water was admirable and famous, and known by this name, the which is yet almost entire on the back of the Promontory of <hi>Miseno,</hi> toward the Port for the Navy, and <hi>Cuma.</hi> This Fabrick <hi>Le<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>andrus Albertus</hi> affirms, is inclosed by four walls, is five hundred foot long, and two hundred and twenty broad: and the Vault some<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>what higher: raising a little archwise from the walls, it riseth high<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er towards the middle, being supported upon forty eight columns, each of which is three foot square, which being disposed into four ranks represent a beautifull and proportionable object for the whole length. The whole Fabrick is composed of brick, and the walls being of a great thicknesse, render it of an extream firmnesse; both the Walls and Pillars with in are exactly incrusted as useful to keep them from leaking: and in the arch are many open ovals for drawing up the waters: at each end were forty steps for descent to the very bottome. The Pavement on the sides is higher even to the midst of the Porticue: whence was a descent by fiue steps into a lesser chamber on each side, and thence was a descent into ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther very narrow inclosed place, into which tis supposed the waters purged their filth and uncleannesse, the which was afterwards ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>haled by the publique officers for this purpose called <hi>Castellarij,</hi> from these conservatories of waters being denominated <hi>Castella</hi> in Latine.</p>

                        <hi>Pliny</hi> in the second Chapter of his thirty first book declares, that the <hi>Villa</hi> of <hi>Cicero</hi> (made so famous by his writings) was in these quarters between the <hi>Avernus</hi> and <hi>Pozzuolo,</hi> upon the Sea shore with a
<pb n="294" facs="tcp:62973:162"/>
most delicious grove and a spacious hall to walk in, wherefore <hi>Cicero</hi> called it an Academy in imitation of that at <hi>Athens,</hi> wherein they ordinarily disputed walking. Here <hi>Cicero</hi> made his sepulchres: and so much was he pleased with it, that he often spoke of it, and enti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tled some of his books from it, <hi>Questiones Academicae:</hi> Academick questions. <hi>Atticus</hi> being in <hi>Athens, Cicero</hi> in almost every letter re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>commended his Academy, that he might send to him from <hi>Greece,</hi> whatever could be had for ennobling it with fair ornaments, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in <hi>Atticus</hi> failed not, according to the occasions, in statues, pictures and other the like ornaments. Whence <hi>Cicero</hi> in his Epistle <hi>ad Atti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticum,</hi> praiseth his diligence and the things sent him.</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>Cicero</hi> being retired hither in the calamitous times of the Repu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>blique to spend away the time, toyl, and troubles with Books, many of the Principal Romans repaired thither to visit him, and take some counsel. Of them was <hi>C. Caesar</hi> after the victory he obtained in the civil warr, <hi>C. Octavius</hi> the Successour of <hi>Julius,</hi> yet before he made himself Emperour, with infinite others: but after that <hi>Cicero</hi> was banished, the <hi>Villa Academica</hi> was possessed by <hi>C. Antistius,</hi> who was the Legat of <hi>Caesar,</hi> and followed his faction in the civil wars. A little after <hi>Ciceroes</hi> death, in his <hi>Villa,</hi> sprung up fountains of hot water, good among other things for the eyes and sight, celebrated by <hi>Tullius Taureus</hi> the freeman of <hi>Cicero,</hi> with an Epigram set down among the works of <hi>Pliny,</hi> who wrote this successe, and judged that Epigram worthy of memory. We must believe that this <hi>Villa</hi> stood where now the <hi>Stadio</hi> is, taking that name from the length of <hi>Ciceroes</hi> hall, whose ruines yet remain so distinctly, as that it may be measured how long twas: and although this <hi>Stadio,</hi> seem to stand too far from the Sea, in respect of that we read touching <hi>Ciceroes</hi> Academy, yet this will not create any difficulty: since the Sea may be in so long a space of time through divers causes retired; because truely this <hi>Vil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>la</hi> in <hi>Ciceroes</hi> time stood over water, at leastwise conducted from the Sea, by certain channels, so that he eating at table, might cast into the waters for the fish to eat, &amp; angle and fish at his pleasure. The hot fountains are extant in a neere field, in a cavern underground at the root of the hill, which are also of wonderfull nature, because they increase and decrease according to the flowing and ebbing of the sea, by day and by night: in their increase they cast abundance of water into the bath, and when full, part of the water returns to the fountain, and part runs into the Sea by a certain small chanel or gutter made to that purpose.</p>
                     <p>This Bath vulgarly called <hi>Bagno Ciceroniano,</hi> the <hi>Ciceronian</hi> bath, and by phisicians, <hi>Praetense</hi> or <hi>Tritulliano</hi> is as gallant and entire an antiquity as any in the Tract of <hi>Pozzuolo:</hi> These waters were so soveraign not many years since over most diseases, that over every bath was written for what cures twas good, of which inscription some letters yet stand: but the phisicians of <hi>Palermo</hi> (as they tell the story) finding those waters prejudicial to their custom, went with instruments expresly &amp; demolish't those writings (so that for the present they are unusefull) the said phisicians being all cast away in their return. Thus much shall suffice touching <hi>Ciceroes</hi> famous <hi>Vil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>la,</hi> for that <hi>Leander</hi> and other writers treat sufficiently of its nature and others thereabouts.

                        <hi>VElletri</hi> was an antient and potent Castle of the <hi>Volsci,</hi> whereof the <hi>Roman</hi> histories frequently speak: <hi>Livius</hi> and <hi>Dionysius Hal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>licarnasseus</hi> say, that <hi>Velletri</hi> was besieged and enforced to yeild to <hi>Ancus Martius</hi> King of the <hi>Romans:</hi> and <hi>Livy</hi> adds further, that twas severely chastised by the <hi>Romans</hi> for its frequent rebellions, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore the walls were levelled, and the richer sort of <hi>Velletri</hi> sent to dwell beyond the <hi>Tyber,</hi> with penalty of imprisonement to who<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>soever should set foot on this side <hi>Tiber</hi> within a mile of <hi>Velletri.</hi> This Castle was also made a Colony of the <hi>Romans,</hi> and many times re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plenisht with new Inhabitants sent thither from <hi>Rome,</hi> because the old (in the many warrs made on those confines) became impotent and much decreased as <hi>Livy</hi> affirms. <hi>Frontinus</hi> in his <hi>Fragmenta</hi> saies, that he finds many people by precept of the <hi>Sempronian</hi> Law, to have been at sundry times sent from <hi>Rome</hi> to <hi>Velletri,</hi> and that after<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards <hi>Claudius Caesar,</hi> made it a Military <hi>Colony,</hi> dividing his own Territory among the Souldiers. Twas renowned, because the An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cestors of <hi>Caesar Augustus</hi> were of old Inhabitants in it, that is the <hi>Octavian</hi> Family, and the same <hi>Augustus</hi> had a certain noble Seat of his own there, from whence saies <hi>Suetonius,</hi> he caused many things necessary for sustenance and livelyhood to be conveighed.</p>
                     <p>Yet now remain very few marks of the old Fabricks, notwithstan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding that tis yet a great and well inhabited Castle. It hath a lovely Territory replenisht with gardens and Palaces through its vicinity with <hi>Rome, Pliny</hi> in his 14th. book reckons the wine of <hi>Velletri,</hi> among the most generous, but it is not now in that credit, being so crude at present, that they are fain to boyle it in a caldron, to make it drinkable: wherefore <hi>Pliny</hi> well observes, that even the Earth hath its age and decays as have all other things.</p>

The frequent ruines of great Fabricks lying up and down the Countrey <hi>Tusculanum,</hi> where <hi>Cicero, Varro,</hi> and divers other noble <hi>Romans</hi> had their Palaces, deserve due consideration: as do the Countrey seats of the tenn Cardinals, and above all the fair <hi>Villa</hi> of <hi>Frescati,</hi> a place deputed to the Popes recreation: The Ter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritory of <hi>Frescati,</hi> was the antient delight of the <hi>Romans,</hi> and conti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nues

                     <p>Yet the more rational opinion for the name, seems to be derived from the Crowns aforementioned, not only for the aforesaid cause but also for that in that City there stood a most noble Temple of <hi>For<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tune,</hi> famous for those diviners by Lots, who exercised themselves in that superstition: and was therefore visited with many Crowns offered to the said Goddesse by vow: of which Temple some frag<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments yet remain, and a few years since, were there found divers figures of Fortune, in brasse, brick, marble and other materials, as al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>so several Crowns, and divers medals, upon which were figured the various lots, fortunes, and chances, with their marks, signes, and letters.</p>

                        <hi>Cicero</hi> declares in his second Book <hi>de Divinatione,</hi> by extraction out of the Books of the said people <hi>Prenestini,</hi> how the observati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of Chances Lots or Fortunes came to have its beginning in that City: saying, that a certain nobleman of <hi>Pelestrina</hi> named <hi>Suffucius</hi> by frequent advices and menaces which he had in his dreams, was commanded to break out of a certain place a great flint stone, wher<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>at all the other Citizens his Compatriots fell a laughing, but when the stone was broke, the Lots or Chaunces suddenly leaped forth engraven in antient Letters, which occasioned their honouring of Fortune in that place: and thence became the place by little and lit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle enclosed and shut up through respect of the Image of <hi>Jupiter</hi> there devoutly adored by the Matrons, in form of a boy childe sit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting with <hi>Juno</hi> in the lap of <hi>Fortune,</hi> in a posture as seeking out the breast and teat: and that at the same time, after the Temple of For<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tune was built, there dropped honey from an olive tree, wherewith by commandement of the Southsayers was made a chest, and therein those Lotts were reposed, the which were mingled and drawn out by a litle boyes hand when ever they would see the issue of any thing: as <hi>Fortune</hi> had at large directed her intention to be, that after this manner they should draw out the Lots.</p>
                     <p>This observation was most antient, and such as affirm <hi>L. Sylla</hi> to be the builder of this Temple deceive themselves. Which errour
<pb n="308" facs="tcp:62973:169"/>
they took up from their reading the thirty sixth book of <hi>Pliny,</hi> who doth not say <hi>L. Sylla</hi> built that Temple but that he began to make its pavement with small stones of various colours in small figures, of w<hi rend="sup">ch</hi>. pavement thus wrought, some yeers since certain parts were found under ground, and therein figured many forrein creatures with their names in greek.</p>
                     <p>It may then be rationally believed that <hi>L. Sylla</hi> being victorious in the civil warrs, after he had enforced <hi>C. Marius</hi> the younger to dye, and his other enemies who had saved themselves in <hi>Preneste,</hi> after a long siege took the City, killing some part and selling others of the Citizens: but repenting afterwards his impietie expressed against the sacred places, for expiation of that crime, he resolved to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>store and embellish anew the Temple profaned and almost wholly destroyed by him. It seems a notable advise and observation to me, that the strength of the scite of this City hath occasioned its own destruction, which hath had a much contrary event in all other strong holds. The cause whereof is attributed to the assured confi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence of the strength of the place, for which cause in the civil warrs the weaker part ordinarily fled thither for safety: but their ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mies being stronger and more potent immediately layed siege to it, so that at the end if they surrendred not themselves the besiegers ruin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed the poor City: whence we read that in the following times of ci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vil discord the <hi>Pelestrini</hi> that they might not undergoe so great mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sery as formerly they had done, abandoned their City and retired to their dwellings.</p>
                     <p>To this day appear there many subterranean waies from the Castle to the foot of the adjacent mountains, (besides the Caves used as conservatories for water) which were made for introducing of assi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stance, or to fly the City occultly: into one of which <hi>C. Marius</hi> the younger having withdrawn himself, and perceiving himself to be beseiged on all sides, so that he could not fly, that he might not living fall into the hands of his enemies, agreed with <hi>Telesinus</hi> to run one against the other with their naked swords so to kill them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves: by which means <hi>Telesinus</hi> was slain, but <hi>Mvrius</hi> remained alive thorugh desperatly wounded, and soon after caused one of his Se<gap reason="illegible: missing" extent="1 letter">

                        </gap>vants to make an end of his then begun death, by kil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling him. From which successes, the Inhabitants of the place be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve the stones of those subterranean waies to be still red<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dish with the bloud spilt there: which yet is not so, for over all those hills are stones red by nature, and not through any accident of blood spilt thereon.</p>

Although we have scarce courage enough, yet conformable to that published Table will we cursorily describe it, for satisfaction of such as have not had the good fortune to see them, or at least their draught in picture.

In the appartments growes fresh grasse, which with the flowers by their variety wonderfully entertain the eye and fancy of whoever regard them, nor can any satiate himself in the view of those infinite and wonderfull statues, pillars, Fountains and other objects there presenting them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves.</p>
                     <p>The passage from the Piazza before the Palace on the right hand leads through divers walks, trees and small groves, wherein are placed several Fountains, as that of <hi>Tothyde,</hi> that of <hi>AEsculapius,</hi> that of <hi>Nigga,</hi> that of <hi>Aretusa,</hi> and <hi>Pandora,</hi> and that of <hi>Pomona</hi> and <hi>Flora.</hi> In the descent into the first garden, shews it self the <hi>Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lossus</hi> of <hi>Pegasus</hi> in <hi>Pamosso,</hi> a horse feigned to have wings, under whose shadow a fair Fountain casteth up her waters very high and in the wood &amp; rocks is a Cavern, and near them a statue of <hi>Venus</hi> &amp; <hi>Bacchus:</hi> near w<hi rend="sup">ch</hi>. is a Lake, into which some rivolets run among rocks with a murmuring noise between two <hi>Colossus,</hi> one of the <hi>Sibilla Tiburtina,</hi> the other of <hi>Melicerta</hi> the son of <hi>Athamas</hi> and <hi>Ino,</hi> whom the Gen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiles did honour for one of the Gods of the Sea. Below which lye the statues of the Rivers <hi>Aniene,</hi> and <hi>Herculano,</hi> conjoined to certain vessels out of which some waters run into the Lake, as also out of the Urns, round which stand ten Nymphs. In the midst are two Grotts, the one of the <hi>Sibilla Tiburtina,</hi> the other of <hi>Diana</hi> the God<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>desse of the woods, both which are adorned with fountains, sta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tues, Curral, mother of Pearl, and a pavement exactly wrought with mosaick work. On the other side of the garden you have a fair prospect of <hi>Rome</hi> in a semicircle, round which appear her most memorable Fabricks; and in the midst sits <hi>Rome</hi> in the habit of a war<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>like Goddesse, between her seaven hills: this statue is of marble, big<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger then a man, in shape of a Virgin in a short girt coat, with naked hands, military buskins, and a sword hanging in a belt from the right shoulder. Her head is covered with a murrion, in her right hand she holds a spear, in the left a shield: she sits as afore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>said in the midst of her wonders in the City and on every side ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pear her sacred Fabricks, as the <hi>Pantheon,</hi> the <hi>Capitolian</hi> Temples, the Circs, the Theatres, the Amphitheatres, the Collumnes, the Obelisks, the <hi>Mauseoli,</hi> the Arches Triumphant, the Pyramides, the Acqueducts, the Baths, the River <hi>Tyber,</hi> with the wolf and Twin Brothers pouring water into the City out of an urn; in the midst of which running waters, riseth an Island cut in the shape of a ship which bears on the main yard an Obelisk, and the ship seems to be laden with these four Temples, the Temple of <hi>AEsculapius</hi> in the poope, and those of <hi>Jupiter, Berecinta</hi> and <hi>Faustus,</hi> it beares in the prow.</p>
                     <p>
                        <pb n="311" facs="tcp:62973:170"/>Thence descending to the lower garden, you find on the left hand in a semy circle called the great, a green grove, placed be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween certain Rocks amid which run fountains this may be cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led the residence for birds: for on the arms of the trees you see ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny images of little birds singing more sweetly then the natural, who clap their wings as if alive, receiving their motion from the aire and the waters with miraculous artifice, by means of certain little reeds hid in the armes of the trees: sometimes to please the specta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tors, they will make a screech owle to appear, and then on a sud<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dain as if the birds were sensible of fear, they are all silent, but that again withdrawn, in an instant they all begin their notes and sing most melodiously.</p>
                     <p>In the middle of this garden is a round standing water Lake, and in it a capacious vessel and a fountain named from the Dragons, which vomit out of their throats great store of waters, having trum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pets in their hands which also emit plentifull waters, with a horrid noise imitating the sound of the trumpet. On the right hand lies the Grotto of Nature adorned with many statues, and in it an Organ with fair pipes, the which perform an harmonious consort of vari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous and artificial musick, by the motion of the waters.</p>
                     <p>The next garden is not only beautifyed by the fair fountains, but by the quantity of Swans, and fish preserved in their several stati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons separated with rare artifice. In the three greater fountains are certain Beacons, called <hi>Sudanti,</hi> and other boundaries round them, which cast water very high in such quantities, that in their fall they seem natural showers, refreshing the air, and cooling the earth making noise of waters in their fall, as if the winds were high, sprin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kling and washing at a good distance. In the midst of these con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>serves you see the effigies of the great Father <hi>Oceanus</hi> placed in a se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>micircle like a Theatre, and in the middle thereof a marble chari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ot like that of the <hi>Venus Marina,</hi> drawn by foure Sea horses, on which sits a great <hi>Neptune</hi> seeming to threaten with his Trident.</p>
                     <p>Lastly descending into the last garden near the rock, you find in one part a Fountain of <hi>Triton,</hi> and on the other a Fountain of <hi>Ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nus Clonina,</hi> and in the rest of the level besides the Pescheries, four Labyrinths difficult enough for any one to get out of thats once in, placed one by another in foure compartments amidst forreign plants. The entrance and outlet of these gardens, are embellisht with great Fabricks built of <hi>Tiburtine</hi> stone, with great expence. Thus much concerning the <hi>Villa</hi> of <hi>Tivoli,</hi> of Cardinal <hi>Hippolito E stense.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>The noble sepulchre of Cardinal <hi>Hippolito da Este</hi> in the Church will recompence your pains in the sight of it, being composed with marble of various colours, on it stands a great white marble statue of the said Cardinal of great cost and fair appearance. The Castle also affords many worthy objects, but what is more considerable, is the precipitous descent of the River; which falls with such noise and fury from high cliffs of mountains, that for the most part its vapours render the air foggie, and many times at a distance there seem to hang celestial rainbowes, cloudes being at most times over it. This River infamed by the writings of the antient, takes its rise at the mountain of the <hi>Trebani,</hi> and runs into three noble Lakes.
<pb n="312" facs="tcp:62973:171"/>
which give name to the adjacent castle, called <hi>Sublaco:</hi> which Lakes <hi>Tacitus</hi> seems to call <hi>Simbrivini,</hi> saying in the 14th. Book of his Annals, that near them stood the <hi>Villa Sublacense</hi> of <hi>Nero</hi> in the confines of <hi>Tivoli,</hi> from which Lakes the <hi>Aniene</hi> running afterward through woods and mountains, falls at last in the plain near <hi>Tivoli,</hi> from high stones, with fury and noise, then it goes some space under ground, and at the foot of the mountain returns all again above ground, it runs through the three sulphurious veins, called <hi>Albule,</hi> from their white colour. Tis said, and <hi>Strabo</hi> confirms the water there to be medicinal in drinking or Bathing, and <hi>Pliny</hi> writes that they heal the wounded. Nor does the <hi>Albule</hi> only but also the <hi>Albunea</hi> above <hi>Tivoli</hi> consolidate wounds. Regarding the <hi>Campania</hi> of <hi>Tivoli,</hi> about the <hi>Aniene</hi> you will find huge stones encreased by little and little in long time by vertue of the waters running by, and in the bottome of Lakes there you'l find of hard stones generated by the same means.</p>
                     <p>In this confine are many footsteps of old edifices worthy contem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plation: <hi>Tivoli</hi> having been a most noble City, and well Inhabited through the beauty of its scite, the goodnesse of its soyle, and the salubrity of the aire: which made it be surrounded with the fair Villa's, and Lordly houses of the rich persons of that Country, although now like <hi>Rome,</hi> and all <hi>Italy</hi> al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>so it lies waste and ruinated by the various warrs and successes which have destroyed it. Tis certain that Greeks were the builders of this City, but who they were is not certain, the writers of the <hi>Ita<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lian</hi> antiquities not agreeing herein: yet the greater part say that <hi>Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tillo</hi> was its founder, who some say was of <hi>Arcadia,</hi> and Captain of <hi>Evanders</hi> Navy.

                  <head>A DESCRIPTION OF THE ISLAND OF SICILIA OR SICILY.</head>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Sicilia</hi> is an Island of the <hi>Mediterranean</hi> Sea, seated betwixt <hi>Italy</hi> and <hi>Affrick,</hi> but between the South and West tis separated from <hi>Italy</hi> by a neck of the sea. Its form resembles a ▵ in greek, for that it hath three corners, every one whereof makes a Promontory, which are <hi>Peloro, Pachino, Lilibeo,</hi> now called <hi>Capo del Faro, Capo Passero, Capo Boco. Peloro</hi> looks towards <hi>Italy, Pachino</hi> towards <hi>Morea,</hi> and <hi>Li libeo</hi> toward the Promontory <hi>Mercurio</hi> of <hi>Africk,</hi> and to speak accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding to the aspect of the climes, <hi>Peloro</hi> lies Eastward, <hi>Pachino</hi> between South and East, <hi>Lilibeo</hi> between South and West. On the North this Island is washed by the <hi>Tirrhene</hi> Sea, on the East by the <hi>Adriatique</hi> and <hi>Jonian</hi> Sea, on the South by the <hi>African</hi> Sea, and on the West by that of <hi>Sardigna.</hi> It was called <hi>Trinacria,</hi> either from its three Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>montories or from the King <hi>Trinaco,</hi> son of <hi>Neptune,</hi> and <hi>Triquetra,</hi> or from the three points of the Triangle; and <hi>Sirania</hi> from the <hi>Sirani,</hi> and after that <hi>Sicilia</hi> from the <hi>Siculi,</hi> (descended from the <hi>Liguri</hi>) who beat out the <hi>Sicani.</hi> It is in circuit, as by the moderns is judged (setting aside the diversities of the antients) six hundred twenty three miles: from <hi>Peloro</hi> to <hi>Pachino</hi> one hundred and sixty miles, from thence to <hi>Lilibeo</hi> 183 miles, from <hi>Lilibeo</hi> to <hi>Peloro</hi> 211. Its length from East to west is 150 miles, but its bredth is not equal, though on the Eastern part tis 160 miles broad, diminishing afterwards in bredth by degrees, being most straite at <hi>Lilibeo.</hi> The head of all the Island is the Territory <hi>Ennese.</hi> It hath on the north side ten Islands which lie round it (the Antients numbred but 7) whose names are <hi>Liparce, Vulcania,</hi> or <hi>Giera, Vulcanello, Lisca-bianca, Basiluzo, Thermisia, Trongile, Didima, Fenicusa,</hi> and <hi>Ericusa. Sicilia</hi> is divided into three provinces, which they call <hi>Valli</hi> or Vales, that is into the <hi>Val di De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mino</hi>
                     <pb n="319" facs="tcp:62973:174"/>
or <hi>Demona;</hi> the <hi>Val de Noto,</hi> and the <hi>Val di Mazara,</hi> the <hi>Val di De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mino</hi> commenceth from the Promontory <hi>Peloro,</hi> and is the shore on one side to the River <hi>Terria,</hi> and on the other to the River <hi>Hime<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ra</hi> which dischargeth it self into the <hi>Tirrhene</hi> Sea. The <hi>Val di No<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">

                        </gap>o,</hi> begins at the River <hi>Teria,</hi> and with it extending it self inwards, and traversing <hi>Enna,</hi> it descends with the river <hi>Gela,</hi> and ends at the City of <hi>Alicata.</hi> But the <hi>Val di Mazara,</hi> comprehends all the remain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing part of <hi>Sicily</hi> to <hi>Lilibeo.</hi> This Island was some time conjoined to <hi>Italy,</hi> whereof the modern authors as well as antient render a large testimony, though there are some who take it for a ridiculous opini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on. It is esteemed for the salubrity of the Ayre, the abundance of terrene sustenance and plenty of all things necessarie for mans use very excellent, as placed under the fourth Climate much more be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nigne then all the others, whence tis that what ever this soyle of <hi>Sicily</hi> affords, either by its own nature or the Ingenuity of man is accounted next to those which are cryed up for the best. It produ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceth corn in such abundance that in many places it yields 100 for one. Wilde Oats grow there of themselves, as also the Vines, which gave occasion for the Fable of <hi>Ceres</hi> &amp; <hi>Proserpina.</hi> Their wines are most delicate, as is the oyle of Olives whereof they make great quantities. Their Canes too are admirable, called <hi>Ebosia</hi> hereto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore, now <hi>Cannamele,</hi> whereof they make Sugars. Their Bee hony is there so good that by the antients as a proverb twas used the <hi>Hy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>blean</hi> hony of <hi>Sicily,</hi> which affords great store of wax: the Bees using the very tronks of trees for their hives, there gathering ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cellent honey. Their fruits of all sorts, grow with much plenty and goodnesse; they gather all sorts of Plants and medicinal herbs, and their saffron is better then that of <hi>Italy,</hi> as are their roots of wilde palm trees, which are gustfull to eat. The mountains <hi>AEri</hi> are so plentifully furnished with sweet waters, fountains, fruitfull and pleasant trees, that they have many times preserved a great Army of the <hi>Carthaginians,</hi> when near famishing. Other mountains pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duce salt, as <hi>Enna, Nicosia, Camerata</hi> and <hi>Platanim,</hi> where they take out salt stones. There also are the Caves or Pits for salt made of the Foam of the Sea resting upon the co<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">

They also draw salt out of other parts of <hi>Sicily</hi> from the Lakes, as near <hi>Pochino,</hi> (a wonderfull thing) what by the rain, and fresh waters falling from other foun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tains, the Lake may be increased, in a little time, is dryed away by the Sun. They also make here great plenty of that silk which they draw from their silk worms. Nor is <hi>Sicilia</hi> lesse enriched by her Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tals and Mines, having Minerals of Gold, Silver, Iron, Allum: and on the banks of the River <hi>Acate</hi> grow pretious stones, as the Emerald and Agat stone, and the clear Bartina, which is whi<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">

Here al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>so they take up the jasper stone being red, and varied with several clear green and white spots, which ennobles the stone. And in the sea of <hi>Messina,</hi> and of <hi>Drepano,</hi> there growes Corrals a sort of sea Plant much commended and sought after. <hi>Sicilia</hi> is likewise Famed for the Chase of the Goat and wilde Bore: for the fowling at Partridge and God wit. And all other sorts of Birds, and four<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>footed beasts both for delight and profit are there in great plenty, beside the Falcon and other Hawks, which there are taken. The Fishing also is greatly abounding, particularly for the Fish called Tun<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">

                     </gap>y Fish, whereof they take not only at <hi>Pachino</hi> (as the Anti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ents wrote) but also at <hi>Palermo and Drepano,</hi> and in all the River which is washed with the <hi>Tyrrhene</hi> Sea, (this fish bears a great price in <hi>May</hi> or <hi>June</hi>) as also of the sword fish particularly at <hi>Messina,</hi> which (tis written) they cannot take unlesse they speak Greek, and to say no more both the Seas and the Rivers abound with all sorts of excellent fish. They have also in divers places many baths of hot, cool, sulphurous and other sorts of water, usefull and ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vantagious in several Infirmities, but those are in the River <hi>Sen<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">

We will not speak of the Fountains of sweet water that are found over all <hi>Sicilia,</hi> and many Rivolets accommoda<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted as well for the life of Man, as the enriching their Lands by the overflowing. And to speak in brief, this Island is not at all inferiour to any other Province, either for its fatnesse or abun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dance; but somewhat exceeds <hi>Italy</hi> in the excellency of their grain, saffron, honey, Beasts skins, and other sustenance for the life of Man; in so much that <hi>Cicero</hi> not improperly called it the Granary of the <hi>Romans,</hi> and <hi>Homer</hi> said that all things grew there of their own accord, and therefore calls it the Isle of the Sun. <hi>Sicilia</hi> is likewise admirable for the fame of those things which told, exceed our beleef as the Mount <hi>Etna,</hi> &amp; <hi>Mongibello,</hi> who sending forth continual fires from its bowels hath not withstanding its head (on that part where the fire issues) deeply covered in snow to the midst of Summer. Not far from <hi>Agrigento,</hi> or <hi>Gergento</hi> is the Territory <hi>Matharuca,</hi> which with assidu al vomiting of divers veins of waters, sends forth a certain Ash coloured Earth, and at certain times casting out an incredible Mass of that Earth, the one and the other Fields may be heard to roar.</p>
                  <p>In <hi>Menenino</hi> is the Lake <hi>Nastia</hi> (called by <hi>Pliny <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">

It hath likewise in sundry other places divers other Fountains of admirable Qualities and nature, for an ample account whereof the reader is referred to <hi>Thomaso Fazellio,</hi> to the end we may abridge our relation here. <hi>Sicily</hi> was inhabited by the <hi>Cyclopes,</hi> which is verified (besides what Authors affirm) by the bodies of immense bignesse and heigth, which in our daies are seen in the Grots, or Caves.

                  <p>BEtween <hi>Sicilia,</hi> and the River of the one and t'other shore of <hi>Barbary,</hi> are fixed the two Islands <hi>Melita</hi> or <hi>Malta,</hi> and <hi>Gaulo</hi> or <hi>Gozo,</hi> the one distant from the other five miles, but eloigned from <hi>Pachino</hi> or <hi>Capo Passero</hi> a Promontory of <hi>Sicilia,</hi> (which they look to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards) one hundred miles, and from <hi>Africa</hi> one hundred and ninety miles. <hi>Malta</hi> is 60. miles in circumference, being all as it were a plain though somewhat Rocky, and exposed to the windes, it hath ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny and secure Ports, but towards the North tis wholly deprived of fresh waters, but on the western parts are excellent Currance, and it produceth most fruitfull trees. Where tis broadest tis 12 miles over, and in the longest part 20 miles, and in all those seas is there not one Island so great distance from the firm Land as this is. In more then six places towards <hi>Sicilia,</hi> tis hollowed, and hath Ports as it were formed by the Sea of <hi>Sicilia</hi> for receipt of its Pyrates or Ro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vers on the Sea, but towards <hi>Tripolis</hi> tis all full of Cliffes and Rocks af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fording no mannor of Harbour. Tis called <hi>Melita</hi> in Latine from the Bees which in Greek are called <hi>Melitte</hi> for that the abundance and goodnesse of Flowers causeth in this Isle the production of the most excellent hony, but of late by corruption of the word we call it <hi>Malta.</hi> At its first habituation it yielded obedience to King <hi>Battus</hi> famous for his riches, and for the friendship and hospitality of <hi>Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>do,</hi> whence afterwards it obeyed the <hi>Carthaginians.</hi> Whereof the many Collumnes placed up and down the Countrey, engraven with antient <hi>Carthaginian</hi> Characters (farr different from the <hi>Hebrean</hi>) give sufficient testimony. But at the same time when <hi>Sicilia</hi> was reduced to the <hi>Romans,</hi> it also rendered it self and was therefore governed by the same Laws, and the same Praetor as <hi>Sicilia</hi> was.

coming afterwards into the power of the <hi>Saracens,</hi> it finally with <hi>Gozo</hi> in the yeer 1090. was possessed by <hi>Ruggieri Normanno,</hi> Count of <hi>Sicilia,</hi> till at length it obeyed the Christian Princes. The Ayr over all the Island is most healthfull, but chiefly to them that inure them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves to it: It hath Fountains and Orchards copiously replenished with Date Trees, and its soyle every where produceth plentifully all sorts of Grain and Corn, Flax, Cotton, Wool, Cummin seeds, and abundance of Roses eminently sweet favoured: here<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> also they have a kind of little neat white Dogs, which from their long hair we call shocks, of much delight to the people. The Earth is sowed all the year with little husbandry, and they reap two harvests and the trees likewise bear fruit twice in the yeer. In the winter e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>very thing is green and flourisheth, and in the summer is burnt up with heat, howbeit a certain Dew falls which exceedingly nouri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sheth the Corn. At the head of a long and strait point almost oppo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>site to the <hi>Capo Passero</hi> or <hi>Pachino</hi> in <hi>Sicilia</hi> is erected the <hi>Fortezza</hi> of <hi>Sant Ermo,</hi> but on the right hand towards <hi>Sicilia</hi> are some other points, and between them and <hi>Sant Ermo</hi> is a Channel of water upon one of which points is the Castle <hi>Sant Angelo,</hi> and the other the <hi>For<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tezza</hi> of <hi>San Michael</hi> with their Bourges: between the one and the other of which lie the ship<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">

The women are beautifull enough but fly company, goe obscured abroad, are kept close at home, yet following the same manner of life as the <hi>Sicilians,</hi> and speaking a language more like and near the <hi>Carthaginian</hi> then any other language. The people are generally religious and particularly pay a great devotion to Saint <hi>Paul,</hi> to whom this Island is dedicated, for that here he by chance fell into the Sea, and was here entertained with great humanity: and on that shore where he fell in, is built a venerable Chapel; for their respect to whom they believe no noysome nor venemous Crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture can grow or live on this Island. And from the <hi>Grotto</hi> where that Saint stood are stones by many plucked away, and carryed through <hi>Italy,</hi> (called the <hi>Gratia</hi> of Saint <hi>Paul,</hi>) to healthe bitings of Scor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pions and Serpents.
