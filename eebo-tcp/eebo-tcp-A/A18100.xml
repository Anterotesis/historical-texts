         <editorialDecl>
            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>

               <seg rend="decorInit">H</seg>Onourable Sir, the importunate curioſitie of men hath at length ouercome my purpoſe, which would not ſuffer neither this an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwere, nor the Epiſtle that gaue the occaſion of it to keepe priuate with other ſcroles in the desks of the owners. As for me, how vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>willing I haue been from the beginning and euer ſince to haue it publiſhed, both you well know, and others of worth can witneſſe, who haue earneſtly requeſted that of me, yet did not preuaile. But now ſeeing ſo great a man forced to yeeld vnto other mens deſire, let none marueile that I alſo haue done the ſame. And although this Anſwere was not written to the end that it ſhould be publiſhed; yet if they into whoſe hands it ſhall come, be equall and moderatly minded, not ſeruile to affections, there will proue no cauſe (I truſt) that I ſhould repent of publiſhing it, or they of reading it. It ſhall be knowne to honeſt men, and ſuch as be
<pb facs="tcp:8109:3"/>
deſirous of publike agreement amongst Chriſtian people, (as I haue obſerued the moſt to be on both ſides, that are good men, and intelligent in matters Diuine) that they haue his excellent Maieſtie of <hi>GREAT BRITAINE,</hi> ioy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning with them in their moſt holie wiſh, yea, with moſt ear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſt deſire. Who although he haue iuſt cauſe to be perſwaded that his words, his writings, &amp; his actions heretofore haue made manifeſt to the whole Chriſtian world the excellencie of his minde in this behalfe; yet he thought good not to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpiſe this occaſion happened alſo of declaring the ſame. Who is there ſo void of al ſenſe of piety, which doth not embrace, and admire this affection in ſo mightie a Prince? Who ſo ſauage and barbarous as otherwaies to interpret it, or to make doubt whether this anſwere of the King did proceed from a vehement deſire of concord? Religious and wiſe men ſhall further vnderſtand what manner of peace, and concord in the Church this moſt pious Prince wiſheth: and vpon what termes and conditions his Maieſtie is readie to make couenant. For this anſwere is tempered with ſuch moderation, that the zealous endeuour by all good meanes to make vp peace, appeareth not to be inferiour to the Zea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lous endeuour of defending the truth. And this ſurely is the Kings opinion, this his firme ſentence, that it is but vaine for ſuch men to thinke, or talke of the peace of the Church, which are not afraid to ſeparate and diſioyne this celeſtiall chariot, which ought in no wiſe to be diſcoupled. That in vaine therefore doe they vaunt of the truth of their opinion, who maliciouſly interpreting all the ſayings of other men, and deducting thence ſuch abſurd conſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quences as they liſt, giuing bad example of ſuch peruerſe <note place="margin">

<pb facs="tcp:8109:3"/>
the golden names of Charitie, and Vnitie, which are not willing to admit of Truth, which is the foundation of pie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie that is ſincere. It was of old excellently ſpoken by S. Hi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>larie: <hi>Beautifull is the name of peace</hi> (ſaith he) <hi>and faire is the opinion of vnitie; but who may doubt, that that only is the peace of the Church, which is the peace of Chriſt?</hi> The peace of Chriſt, which alone is taught by this moſt holy father to bee approued off in the Church, it is that, by which the doctrine of Chriſt, which he taught his Apoſtles, and his Apoſtles taught the primi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiue Church, doth remaine ſafe defenced, and vnſhaken. Let thoſe to whom it belongeth, who challenge the princi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pall places in the Church, offer vnto his Maieſtie ſuch a peace, and ſtraightway the diſcord is ended. Let them in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>geniouſly and faithfully ſeparate humane matters from di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uine, things ſuperſtitious from things religious, nouelties, and late-borne deuices from ſuch matters as be truly an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cient, laſtly, the nothing or leſſe neceſſarie, from the neceſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſary: and I ſay againe, and I crie aloud, that all may heare, on his Maieſties part, and for the Church of England, the diſcord is at an end Now, to come vnto ſo great a be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nefit, there lieth but one Kings ſtreete, as it were, which from the entrance of the Church hath been beaten by our anceſtors, namely the free celebration of a Generall Councell: wherein the complaints of all Nations may be heard, wherein controuerſies may be determined, and peace for the time enſuing, by Gods mercie bee eſta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bliſhed. For the rooting of bad opinions out of mens mindes, and for the reconciliation of nations diuided by diſſention, the Church in all ages knew no other courſe but this, nor vſed other but this; they vſed not violence nor armes. But ſeeing by reaſon of the generall ſinnes of vs all,
<pb facs="tcp:8109:4"/>
there appeares no hope of a Generall Councell, yet it would be ſome eaſe of this euill, if the great libertie, or rather vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bridled licence of daily writing and publiſhing bookes of Diuinitie, were by ſeuere lawes on both ſides reſtrained. For now what hope can remaine, when throughout all Eu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rope euery where, euer now and then, new writers come abroad, ſuch as be readie to powre oyle into the fire, rather then by casting on water to extinguiſh the flame. <hi>Grego<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rie Nazianzen,</hi> that admirable Diuine, could not endure in the men of his time, the curioſitie in diſputing of diuine matters: and in diuers places of his writings hee affirmes that the only cauſe almoſt of the euils which that age ſuffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red, not vnlike to ours now adaies, was this: becauſe men, void of Gods ſpirit, commonly and promiſcuouſly did diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pute of ſpirituall things, and conuert Theologie into tech<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nology, that is, make no other vſe of Diuinity but as a mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter <note place="margin">

Away then with this libertie of pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phecying, which is ſo pleaſing vnto ſome of theſe times, if they vnderſtand thereby a licence of broaching new deui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces, and departing from the doctrine which hath been re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiued by conſent of all men in the ages of the primitiue Church. What ſhould I tell here of thoſe vnſauourie, and vnlettered writers, which are ſcarcely perfit in the firſt ele<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments of Christian religion, which daily come foorth of thoſe places eſpecially, where, without any difference made of good or euill demeanours, without reſpect of knowledge or ignorance, to the hurt of the common good, rewards are

propounded, vnto any one that being growne impudent can ſet out a booke againſt the aduerſe part, though it be full of rage, and emptie of all learning. But what good can be hoped for from ſuch, as make the knowledge of Diuini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie a trade of liuing, a helpe or way to get money? whom neither the glorie of God doth moue to write, nor the loue of truth, nor the edification of the Church, much leſſe the deſire of godly and holie peace: but reward only, and baſe hire, or the tickling of vaine glorie?

He whom I meane, whom I am aſhamed to name, ſuch is the baſeneſſe of this new Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctor, is a common vagrant <hi>Peltmonger,</hi> an idiot, an illi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terate fellow, that neither hath Greeke, nor Latin, without ſcience and without conſcience, borne to trouble honeſt men, and to ſpend ſuſtenance, and nought elſe good for. He, becauſe amongst women he is held a petie Master, and well tongu'd in his mother language, hath taken vpon him of late to cenſure all the writers of both ſides. Which he hath vndergone more willingly, becauſe two yeeres agoe be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing deeply indebted, hauing got a penſion of ſeuen hun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dred Crownes, that he might wipe off the old debt, and haue annuall pay (I ſpeake nothing but truth, and what he himſelfe told me) changde ſides, and fled vnto the ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uerſe part. So he, which amongst thoſe whom he forſooke, liued in famous for ſuſpition of being an Atheiſt, hatefull to all honeſt men that knew him neerely, now, forſooth, muſt needs approoue the feruour of his new Zeale to thoſe to whom hee hath fled, that is, whom hee hath deceiued. Wherefore <hi>Pelt:</hi> being now a Doctor of his owne or eating, daily writes, or rather vomites out new bookes. Firſt, two

yeeres ſince hee laid the rudiments of his new profeſsion, when hee put foorth a booke againſt the Preface of his ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cellent Maieſtie, that moſt learned Prince, himſelfe being the baſeſt of petifoggers, an vnlettered book-maker, the ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry <note place="margin">

               </note> dregges of ignorance: in which booke (if you except a very few things) there is nothing but triuiall ſtuffe, vtte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red a thouſand times before, nothing but what is drawne out of the lees. And as for thoſe few things excepted, there is no learned man in Paris but knowes, and I am certaine from whom hee ſtole them. For we are not ignorant vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der whoſe table he gathers thoſe crummes which furniſh out his diſhes. This <hi>Pelt:</hi> hauing ſome few moneths ſince aſſaulted a man of great fame, and nobilitie, vouchſafed me alſo the honour to be thought worthie of the cenſure of this new Ariſtarch, this pillar of wiſedome: but by the way, and as it were paſsing by, leſt if hee ſhould haue done otherwaies, ſome honour (beleeue it) had accrewed vnto my name from the worthineſſe of ſo great an aduerſarie. I publiſhed not long before an Epiſtle written to <hi>Fronto Ducaeus,</hi> a Diuine of the ſocietie of Ieſus, wherein was contained a true hiſtoricall declaration of ſome things done in this kingdome by certaine of that Societie. This Epiſtle <hi>Pelt:</hi> in his booke aboue mentioned refuteth not, (how could he?) but ſtabs it with one ſharp cenſure: after that conuerting his ſpeech vnto his Maieſtie, requeſts him not to beleeue any of thoſe things which he beheld with his owne eyes, which the whole kingdome ſaw, which are laid vp in the publike records, which the vniuerſall world now knoweth to be moſt true. All theſe things my <hi>Pelt:</hi> dare call falſe, and fained through flatterie; yea, and ſaies it to the King: as if the moſt gracious and clement Prince were one, whoſe eares lie open for ſuch information as may de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtroy

the innocent. What halter, or what gallowes are con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>digne puniſhment for this crime? When his excellent Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ieſtie read thoſe things, and ſhewed me them, who had not ſeene them before: I ſaw him heerein deteſt the ſtrange boldnes and impudence of this <hi>Pelt.</hi> And whereas hee would haue me thought a cunning flatterer, herein he wrongs egregiouſly the King, rather then me.</p>

            <head>THE ANSWERE OF M<hi rend="sup">r</hi>. ISAAC CASAVBON TO THE Epiſtle of the moſt illuſtrious, and moſt <hi>reuerend Cardinall</hi> PERON.</head>
            <p>
               <seg rend="decorInit">M</seg>Oſt illuſtrious, and moſt reuerend Lord, I haue learned (as I thinke) by vſe, and experience, that there is no euill ſo great, out of which, or by occaſion whereof ſome good may not ariſe. And as it is an vſuall ſpeech that honey bree<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deth gall; ſo it may bee ſaid not vnfitly, that ſomtimes out of pure gall commeth pure honey. Not to ſeeke any further proofe of this, the lewd book of that deboſht cauiller, which gaue me firſt occaſion by his excellent Maieſties commaund, of writing to your illuſtrious Honour, it was pure gall, and that moſt virulent. But both your letters, which vpon that occaſion you ſent me, ſeaſoned with ſingular courteſie, hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manitie, and prudence, witneſſing the faire ingenuitie of the author, were ſweeter to me then any honey. Wherefore I was not afraid to ſhew them vnto his Maieſtie, and his Maieſtie, although he approued not of all that was in them, (for that could not be) yet hee refuſed not, but was willing to reade them both. It delighted him very much, that yet he knew one Diuine of your ſide, a man of chiefe place, of honorable eſtimation, and excellent learning, which hand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling the controuerſies of theſe times, appeared to be of a moderate, and quiet diſpoſition. For, with what ſpirit the
<pb n="2" facs="tcp:8109:7"/>
moſt are led, which now adaies ſet out bookes of this argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, there needs no more ſufficient declaration then out of thoſe writers which hitherto haue oppugned his Maie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſties Apologie. All of them (if you except one or two) filling their vnhappie leaues with lies, reproches, and foule lan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guage. But eſpecially the words in your laſt letters did de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>light his Maieſtie, whoſe minde is enflamed with the zeale of ſincere pietie, whereby you ſeemed to put him in hope that this friendly communication concerning mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters of religion was like not to prooue fruitleſſe. Which thing as it pleaſed the King marueilouſly, who is readie vp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on this condition to vndergoe any paines, ſo, if there re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maine no hope hereof; neither is there any iuſt cauſe why his Maieſtie, or your Honour ſhould trouble your ſelues. Surely I hope, if your Worthineſſe will take ſerious care of it, that with the helpeof almightie God, you may effect, by the authoritie which you haue amongſt your owne, and the report of learning, and wit amongſt all, that by theſe mu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tual writings, ſome good profit may redownd to y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> Church of Ieſus Chriſt. As for his moſt excellent Maieſtie of <hi>Great Britaine,</hi> in whoſe Court I haue now liued a whole veere and more, I dare promiſe you, and with all manner of aſſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ueration confirme, that he is ſo affected, and that the courſe of his whole life hath bin ſo ordered, that all men may eaſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly vnderſtand there is nothing dearer to him then the care<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full endeuour for religion. Neither priuate buſineſſe, nor the publike cares of his kingdome doe vſually ſo affect his Maieſtie, as a kinde of vnmeaſurable deſire by all meanes to promote religion, and (which conſideration moſt be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeemes ſo great a King) an exceeding affection by all right and honeſt meanes to procure peace amongſt the diſſenting members of the Church. And this care ſo fitting a Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtian Prince, the moſt pious King hath not confined within the bounds of his owne kingdome, though very large, but remembring that he is ſtiled the <hi>Defendour of the faith,</hi> he hath thought good, not out of any curioſitie, but a vehe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mencie of zeale to extend it beyond the limites of his owne
<pb n="3" facs="tcp:8109:7"/>
little world: that his Maieſties wiſedome and authoritie might be beneficiall alſo to the Churches of other Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tries, if occaſion were offered: and that daily it might be more apparant in the ſight of God, and men, that his chiefe care is the preſeruation of Chriſtian religion. Of late there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore, and about the time when I ſhewed you his laſt letters, his Maieſtie gaue this great experiment of this his deuout minde: which, as it is moſt worthilie approued, and com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mended <note place="margin">

When the right Honourable and moſt re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uerend Prelate, the Lord Archbiſhop of Canterburie his Grace, by letters certified his Maieſtie, that there came vnto his hands a booke brought out of ſome part of Germanie, or the Low Countries, containing doctrine concerning the nature of God, which was new, peruerſe, and in ſome points repugnant to the faith of the Catholike Church; and with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>all deſired his Maieſtie that for the repreſſing of this miſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chiefe, which was lately ſprung vp, hee would ſhew foorth the zeale of the Defendour of the faith, and intercede with the Magiſtrates of that place where the author liued, deſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring of them not to ſuffer ſo prodigious doctrine to bee <note place="margin">

And although at that time his bodie was faint with exerciſe, and faſting, yet what he had begun, he went through at once, as it were with one continuance and heate of endeuour: neither could hee bee entreated by the Nobilitie which ſtood about him to haue any reſpect of himſelfe, vntill after a good long conſideration of the whole matter, with the right reuerend Biſhop of Lichfield and others of the Clergie, and a perfect vnderſtanding thereof, hee moſt accuratly diſcharged, as
<pb n="4" facs="tcp:8109:8"/>
much as appertained to him, and as piety commanded. The booke was condemned, and it was determined that all the copies of it ſhould be burnt in <hi>London,</hi> and in both the Vni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uerſities. Which afterwards was performed. Letters were immediatly diſpatched (the King himſelf dictating) vnto his Maieſties Legier there lying, to teſtifie what was the iudge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of the King, and the Church of England concerning this new doctrine. Withall, order was giuen to acquaint the Magiſtrates with the matter. Let them looke to it, to whom the care of remouing that euill doth belong, what account of their delay they can make vnto the immortall God, if (which wee hope cannot come to paſſe) neither of their owne accord, nor after ſo notable example, they vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dergoe the patronage of the truth with leſſe zeale and en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deuour then they ought. His Maieſtie at the firſt receiuing of the newes was ſo mooued, that hee thought hee ſhould commit a grieuous offence, if hee gaue any indulgence to his bodie, before he had fully performed this office of pie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie. I doubt not (moſt illuſtrious Cardinall) but you will greatly approue of, and praiſe this deed. I haue made rela<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion to you of what was done, not to the intent I might commend his Maieſtie vnto you, but to let you vnderſtand how faſt he holdeth the ancient faith, and how ſtout and earneſt a Defendour he is of the opinions of the true Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tholike Church, whom notwithſtanding moſt of your Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tholikes will not haue to bee accounted and called a Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tholike, yea many, not a Chriſtian. His Maieſtie at the firſt thought the ſtrife about thoſe names not to be materiall, whileſt he held that which was meant by them, which his Maieſtie deſires to doe, and fullie truſts in the mercie of God that he doth. But becauſe the common ſort of men doe thus interpret, that to be depriued of ſuch names, is all one as to bee depriued of the things vnderſtood by thoſe names: therefore hee doth not thinke it wiſedome to take no notice of this wrong. As concerning the name of Chriſtian, there is no ſtrife, no controuerſie be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>twixt you and him. For neither of your Epiſtles doth deny
<pb n="5" facs="tcp:8109:8"/>
this title to be due vnto him. The queſtion is then concer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning the title of Catholike. For after that, according vnto your excellent eloquence, in your firſt Epiſtle you had ſig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nified that you acknowledged in the King of Great Bri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taine the perfect and abſolute Idea of the greateſt Prince; in the end, you put this exception, if vnto the other gifts of his minde the glorious name of Catholike might bee ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded: and when, by his Maieſties commandement, it was anſwered, that that title could not be denied to him, which acknowledged the three Creeds of the Church Catholike, and the foure firſt generall Councels: and which beleeued all things that were beleeued as neceſſarie to ſaluation in the foure firſt ages: with this anſwere in your laſt accurate and ſubtile letters you appeared not to be ſo well ſatisfied. Thoſe letters perſwade your ſelfe that they were not read haſtily, and curſorily, for he read them through, and exami<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned the waight of your reaſons with wonderfull equitie, and gentlenes of minde. But, whereas, after the reading of your anſwere, hee departeth not from his former opinion, and yet neuertheleſſe, by the helpe of Gods grace, truſteth he is a true Catholike, his Maieſtie would haue you know what reaſons he hath for this reſolution. Wherefore, moſt illuſtrious Cardinall, receiue this ſhort anſwere to your laſt letters, which receiuing from his Maieſties owne mouth, I was commanded to compriſe in words, and to ſend vnto you. I will not now requeſt of you, that in the reading of theſe you would vſe ſuch equitie, as hee did in the reading of yours. I know full well your excellent wiſedome and moderation worthie of all praiſe. The whole diſputation in your laſt letters conſiſteth of two parts. In the former part are brought fiue reaſons, which do illuſtrate and ſhew the acception of this theſis, in what ſenſe you would haue it taken. This theſis; <hi>Catholici appellatio, &amp;c. The name of Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tholike can be denied to none which admits of the three, namely, the Apoſtles, the Nicene, and the Athanaſian Creeds: and of the foure firſt generall Councels, the Nicene, the Constantino<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>politane, the Epheſine, and that of Chalcedon: lastly, which be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leeues</hi>

               <hi>all thoſe things that were thought neceſſarie to be belee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ued to ſaluation in the first foure ages.</hi> This theſis, in the Kings anſwere, hath the place of the maior propoſition.

               <p>THe name of Catholike doth not ſimply ſignifie faith, but al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſo a communion with the Catholike Church. Therefore the ancients would not haue them called Catholikes which de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parted from the communion of the Church, albeit they retained the ſame faith.

               <p>TO beleeue the Catholike Church, and to beleeue the communion of Saints, are ſet downe in the Apoſtles Creed diſtinctly, as two diuers things. And the former of theſe two articles ſeemes to be inſerted eſpecially, to the end that a difference might bee made betwixt the Iewiſh Syna<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gogue, and the Chriſtian Church. Which was not to bee confined within the bounds of one nation, as that was, but to be ſcattered farre and wide thorow all the regions of the world. Wherefore there is no manifeſt reaſon, why in the beginning of this obſeruation the name of Catholike ſhould be ſaid to ſignifie communion. Indeed theſe two are very neere ioyned, but they are two diuers things, as I haue ſhewed. Now his Maieſtie beleeues vnfainedlie, that there is but one Church of God, truly, and in name Catho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>like, or vniuerſall, diffuſed ouer the whole world, out of which he affirmeth alſo that no ſaluation is to be hoped for.

For he affirmes that all thoſe teſtimonies doe euince this only; that there remaines no token of ſaluation for them which depart from the faith of the Catholike Church, or from communion with the ſame Church. Which thing (as I ſaid before) the King willingly grants. But here his Maieſtie deſires of you (moſt illuſtrious Cardinall) that you would call to minde, and perpend, what great difference there is betwixt the times of S. Auguſtine, and theſe of ours. How much the Church now called Catholike differs from the ancient; how the face of the Church is changed, and the outward forme, to ſay nothing of the inward. For then the Church Catholike was like a citie ſeated vpon an hill, which, as Chriſt ſaith, cannot be hid, knowne to all, conſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cuous <note place="margin">

reade it, neither can wee beleeue it, which then daily pra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctiſe did ſhew to be moſt true, and may eaſily be demonſtra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted out of hiſtorie, by infinit examples. There were then al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſo in frequent vſe <hi>literae formate,</hi> that is, demiſſatie or teſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moniall letters; by commerce whereof, and as it were by tokens, communion was held amongſt the members of the Church, although farre remoued by diſtance of place. Furthermore, when it ſtood in neede, they had Councels truly Occumenicall, not, as ſince we haue ſeene; Occume<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nicall in name only, but indeed aſſembled out of ſome Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uinces of Europe. And in thoſe ancient times this was the faſteſt bond, whereby all the members of the Catholike Church were knit together in the ioynture of one bodie; which bodie was for that cauſe very eminent, conſpicuous, and in the faire view of all, which no man could chuſe but know. There was one faith, one ſtate, one body Catholike, frequent mutuall viſitation, wonderfull conſent of all the members, a wonderfull ſympathie. Was any man lapſed by hereſie, or ſchiſme from the communion of any one Church: I ſpeake not of any one of the chiefe, which were the ſeates of the foure Patriarchs: but of any one much ſmaller? that man as ſoone as it was knowne, was held to be excluded from the communion of the whole Catholike Church. For whereas wee meete with ſome examples ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerued to the contrarie, that was not right, but vſurpation.

Wherefore ſuch a ſteale-truth being once diſcouered, all the ſhepheards of the whole world, if need was, were raiſed, and were neuer quiet vntill they had rooted out this euill, and prouided for the ſecuritie of Chriſts ſheepe. By theſe ſignes and markes the Church at that time was con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpicuous: but this happineſſe continued not many ages. For, after that the Empire was ouerturned, and the forme of the Common-wealth altered, there ſprung vp many new ſtates, differing as well in manners and language, as in or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinances, and lawes. Then vpon the diſtraction of the Em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pire
<pb n="11" facs="tcp:8109:11"/>
followed the diſtraction of the Catholike Church: and by little and little all thoſe things ceaſed, which had been before of ſingular vſe for the preſeruation of vnion and communion in the outward Catholike bodie of the Church. From that time the Catholike Church hath not ceaſed to be, for it ſhall continue euer, neither ſhall the gates of hell at any time preuaile againſt it, ſeeing it is founded vpon Chriſt the true rock, and vpon the faith of <hi>Peter</hi> and the reſt of the Apoſtles; but it began to be leſſe manifeſt, being diuided into many parts, which, as touch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing externall communion, were quite ſeparated from one another. Then (which is chiefly to be lamented) it came to paſſe by this diſſipation, that there was leſſe ſtrength in the parts, then before in the whole bodie to reſiſt the enemie of mankind, who is readie at al times, as our Sauiour teacheth, to ſcatter tares amongſt the good ſeede. And conſidering, in theſe times wee ſee with our eyes that this is come to paſſe, and it is ſo groſſe that wee may almoſt grope it with our hands, it is ridiculous, and moſt abſurd to diſpute whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther this thing could heretofore happen, or hath now hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pened. Therefore the Church of Rome, the Greek Church, the Church of Antioch, and of Aegypt, the Abyſſine, the Moſchouite and many others, are members much excelling each other in ſinceritie of doctrine, and faith: yet all mem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bers of the Catholike Church, whoſe ioynture, in regard of the outward forme was long ſince broken. For which cauſe his Maieſtie doth much wonder, when hee conſiders how ſome Churches, which heretofore were but members of the bodie once entire, doe now ingroſſe all the right of the whole, and appropriate to themſelues the name of Catho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>like: excluding from their communion, and affirming boldly, that they belong not to the Catholike Church, whoſoeuer doe diſſent from them in anything, or refuſe the yoke of their bondage. Neither do you only challenge to your ſelues this right: there are others that do the ſame. For, (his Maieſtie ſpeakes it with griefe) there are at this day many priuate Churches, which beleeue that they onely

of England is ſo farre from forſaking the ancient Catho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>like Church, which ſhe doth reuerence, and admire: that ſhe departeth not from the faith of the Church of Rome, in any point wherein that Church agreeth with the ancient Catholike. If you queſtion the ſucceſſion of perſons, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hold the names of our Biſhops, and their continuance from the firſt without any interruption: if the ſucceſſion of do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrine, come, make triall: let vs haue a free Councell which may not depend vpon the will of one. The Church of Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land is readie to render an account of her faith, and by de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monſtration to euince, that the authors of the reformation here, had no purpoſe to erect any new Church, (as the ig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>norant and malicious doe cauill) but to repaire the ruines of the old, according to the beſt forme: and in their iudge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment that is beſt which was deliuered by the Apoſtles to the Primitiue Church, and hath continued in the ages next enſuing. His Maieſtie grants, that his Church hath depar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted from many points of that doctrine, and diſcipline which the Pope of Rome now ſtifly defendeth: but they doe not thinke this to be a reuolting from the Catholike Church, but rather a returning to the ancient Catholike faith, which in the Romane Church by new deuices hath been manifoldly, and ſtrangely deformed; and ſo a conuerſion to Chriſt the ſole Maſter of his Church. Wherefore if any man grounding vpon the doctrine of this <hi>obſeruation,</hi> will inferre from it, that the Church of England, becauſe it re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iects ſome ordinances of the Romane, hath therefore de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parted from the ancient Catholike Church: his Maieſtie will not grant him this, vntill he prooue by ſound reaſons, that all things taught by them of Rome, eſpecially thoſe which they will haue to be beleeued as neceſſarie to ſal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uation, were allowed of from the beginning, and eſtabliſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed by the ancient Catholike Church. Now, that no man can euer doe this, at leaſt neuer yet hath done it, his Maie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtie, and the reuerend Biſhops of the Engliſh Church, doe hold it to be as cleere as when the Sunne ſhineth at mid<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>day. Laſtly, his Maieſtie thinketh it a great offence to for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſake

And your <note place="margin">Non fugi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mus, ſed fu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gamur.</note> Honour well knoweth how many, and how excellently learned and godly men, for theſe fiue hundred yeeres at the leaſt, haue wiſhed the reformation of the Church, both in the head, and members. What grieuous complaints haue been often heard of worthie Kings and Princes, lamenting the eſtate of the Church in their times? But what auailed it? for vnto this day we ſee not any one thing amended of all thoſe which were thought moſt needfull of reforma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion. Wherefore the Church of England in this ſeparation feareth not any fellowſhip with the Donatiſts, if the matter be debated by ingenuous men. They willingly and with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out cauſe left the Catholike Church, which at that time the conſent of all nations did approue, whoſe doctrine or diſcipline they could not blame: but England being en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>forced by great neceſſitie, ſeparated her ſelfe from that Church, which innumerable Chriſtian people did not grant to be the true Catholike, and vniuerſall Church: nay more, which many of your owne writers haue heretofore ingenuouſly confeſſed to haue varied much from the an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cient Church in matters of faith, and diſcipline; to haue patched many new things to the old, and euill to the good: which indeed, is now better knowne to the vniuerſall world, then that any man can denie, or be ignorant of it. Furthermore, the Church of England for ſome ages paſt had felt the yoke of the Romane ſeruitude ſo cruell, being afflicted with their often new vexations, and incredible ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>actions, that if there were no other cauſe, yet that alone might ſuffice before equall iudges to free them from the ſuſpition of ſchiſme, and as S. <hi>Auguſtine</hi> ſpeakes of the Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>natiſts, <hi>iniquae diſciſſionis,</hi> of an vniuſt rent, or diſtraction from the Church. For the Engliſh did not depart from bro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>therly charitie vpon a humour, as the Donatiſts did, nor, as the tenne tribes of the Iewes, for feare of imminent euill: but after the patience of many ages, after vnſpeakable mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeries,
<pb n="15" facs="tcp:8109:13"/>
at length they withdrew their necks, and ſhaked off the intollerable burthen, which neither were they able longer, nor would their conſcience ſuffer them to beare. Beſides this, the ancient Church, to the end that ſhe might draw the refractarie Donatiſts to communion, was wont with admirable charitie to prouide for the temporall commodities of the Biſhops, and others that were reconci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led: but the Church of Rome (being deſirous of amitie with England) what doth ſhe? firſt, thunders out her Buls, then vſeth violence, open, and ſecret: then receiueth into her boſome, and ſtill cheriſheth deteſtable traytors, euidently condemned of plotting the deſolation of their Countrie: laſtly, numbreth amongſt Martyrs thoſe which ſuffered for the ſame crimes, and daily defendeth their innocencie a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt all lawes both diuine and humane.

               <p>THoſe things which were held by the holy Fathers, as not abſolutely neceſſarie to ſaluation; but only profi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>table,
<pb n="16" facs="tcp:8109:14"/>
or lawfull, they ought to be eſteemed little more then indifferent. For the vſe of them being as things not ſimplie neceſſarie, in the beginning was free. In ſuch things there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore to deuiſe any neceſſitie at all, it ſeemes vniuſt: for by and by there will follow a neceſſitie of vſing them: as wee fee it is come to paſſe in the Church of Rome: which ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerues at this day many things as ſimplie neceſſarie to the integritie of faith, which the ancient Church ſcarce knew, much leſſe vſed as matters of neceſſitie. I will alleage foure examples of many. It is manifeſt that in the primitiue Church confeſſion of ſinnes was vſed, but farre otherwaies then now. For, that auricular confeſſion in that manner which you haue it was in vſe in the primitiue ages, I think, no man will affirme. His Maieſtie grants that the Fathers which did firſt ordaine it, had their reaſons why they thought that ſuch manner of confeſſion would further the eaſier attaining vnto ſaluation: but they held it not for a thing neceſſarie abſolutely, much leſſe for a Sacrament: or at leaſt not all the Fathers thought ſo. For as touching S. <hi>Chryſoſtome,</hi> it is plaine that hee required not of his people auricular confeſſion. But the matter is now come to that paſſe, that there is little leſſe attributed to this confeſſion, then to the precious blood of Chriſt, whereby wee are re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deemed: the abſolute neceſſitie thereof is ſo preciſely vr<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ged. Whence by little grew vp that doctrine in the Church of Rome, of not diſcloſing the ſecret of confeſſion vpon any occaſion ſoeuer. For, becauſe they beleeued that it was impoſſible without this confeſſion to attaine vnto the ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uen of ſaluation, therefore they thought it neceſſarie to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moue all impediments that might hinder it. Wherefore in time this doctrine hath proceeded ſo farre, that now to murther Kings, or ſuffer them to be murthered, ſeemes to be no ſinne, in compariſon of breaking the ſeale of confeſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion: which many of your Diuines, eſpecially the expoun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders of the Canon Law haue in their bookes publiſhed. Moreouer, <hi>Binetus</hi> a Ieſuite, did auouch as much to me at Paris, in the ſame tearmes, which I remember y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> I told you af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terwards.
<pb n="17" facs="tcp:8109:14"/>
We know alſo, neither perhaps is your Honor ig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>norant of it, y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> there is another Ieſuit in France, which of late was bold to ſay, That if our Lord Ieſus Chriſt were liuing vpon the earth, ſubiect to death, and ſome man had told him in confeſſion, that he would kill him, notwithſtanding, rather then he would reueale that confeſſion, he would ſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fer (I tremble to ſpeake it) Chriſt Ieſus himſelfe to be mur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thered. Which horrible blaſphemie you ſee whence it tooke the originall. In like manner, abſtinence from wine, and daintie cheare, ſet times of faſting, xerophagiae, or, ea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting drie meates, the ancient Church reckoned amongſt ſuch things as were profitable to the eaſier obtaining of ſaluation: neither doth his Maieſtie denie it, giuing a con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uenient interpretation according to the intention of the primitiue Church: but, by your leaue, he liketh not that the obſeruation of theſe things ſhould be more ſtrictly requi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red, then of ſuch as are expreſſely contained in holy Writ. Againe, ſingle life in the Miniſters of the Church, was in old time commended, but now it is commanded, and exa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cted as a matter of abſolute neceſſitie: whereof you ſhall heare more hereafter. So, whereas S. <hi>Paul</hi> ſaith, that hee doth afflict his bodie, and make it ſeruiceable, his Maieſtie <note place="margin">1. <hi>Cor.</hi> 9. 27</note> honours, and calles them bleſſed that follow this example of the diuine Apoſtle: but he deteſteth thoſe which reckon ſackcloth, and Lacedemonian whippings, and ſuch vexa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions <note place="margin">

Simply neceſſarie, his Maieſtie calleth thoſe things, which the word of God expreſſely chargeth to bee beleeued, or practiſed: or which the an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cient Church by neceſſarie conſequence, hath drawne out of the word of God. But ſuch things, which out of the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtitution of men, although with a religious, &amp; wiſe intent, yet beſides the word of God, were receiued, and vſed of the Church for a time, thoſe he thinketh may be cha<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ged; or re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>laxed, or aboliſhed. And as Pope <hi>Pius</hi> the ſecond ſaid of the ſingle life of the Clergie, <hi>that there was good right in times paſt to ordaine it, but now there is better to diſanull it:</hi> his Maieſtie thinkes that the ſame ſpeech may be vſed in generall of the moſt Eccleſiaſticall obſeruations, which are brought into the Church without any precept of Gods word. If this diſtinction were vſed for the deciding of the controuerſies of theſe times, and if men would ingenuouſly make a difference betwixt diuine, and poſitiue law, it ſeemes that amongſt godly and moderate men, touching things abſolutely neceſſarie, there would bee no long, or bitter co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>tention. For both (as I ſaid euen now) they are not many, and they are almoſt equally allowed of by all which challenge the name of Chriſtian. And his excellent Maie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtie doth hold this diſtinction to be of ſuch moment for the diminiſhing of controuerſies, which, at this time doe ſo vexe the Church of God, that he iudgeth it the dutie of all ſuch as bee ſtudious of peace, diligently to explane it, to teach it, to vrge it. Now will we addreſſe our ſelues to ſpeak of ſome examples which are propoſed in this Obſeruation. Amongſt the things abſolutely neceſſarie, yet not ſimply, but in reſpect of diuine inſtitution, you reckon the bap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiſme of infants, which <hi>wee</hi> (ſay you) <hi>doe referre vnto this</hi>
                  <pb n="20" facs="tcp:8109:16"/>
                  <hi>kinde of neceſſitie.</hi> Afterwards you bring a place out of S. <hi>Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guſtine,</hi> wherein the poſſibilitie of ſaluation of children not baptiſed is preciſely denied. Here, firſt, his Maieſtie profeſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeth that himſelf and the Church of England doe allow the neceſſitie of baptiſme, in reſpect of diuine inſtitution, as wel as you. The Church of England doth not binde the grace of God to the meanes, which is contrarie euen to the do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrine of the better ſort of ſchoolemen: yet becauſe God hath appointed this for the ordinarie way to obtaine remiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion of ſins in his Church, and Chriſt himſelfe denieth the entrance into the kingdom of heauen to thoſe which are <note place="margin">
                     <hi>Iob.</hi> 3. 5.</note> not borne againe of water and the Spirit: therefore it is carefully prouided heere by the Eccleſiaſticall lawes, that parents may haue baptiſme for their children at any time, or place. Wherefore, that which <hi>Tertullian</hi> ſaith of the pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitiue Church, that Biſhops, Prieſts, and Deacons did bap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiſe: and laſtly, that the ſame was lawfull for lay men alſo in caſe of extreame neceſſitie; the ſame, as concerning Bi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhops, Prieſts, and Deacons, is at this day practiſed in the Church of England, without any rigid or inuiolable ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeruation of whatſoeuer time or place. But for the baptiſme of lay men or women, as by the lawes of the Church it is forbidden to be done; ſo being done according to the law<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full forme, in a manner it is not diſallowed, the Church pronouncing it to be baptiſme, although not lawfully ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miniſtred. But his excellent Maieſty doth ſo highly eſteeme of this Sacrament, that when ſome Miniſters in Scotland, pretending I know not what ordinances of new diſcipline, refuſed, vpon the deſire of the parents, to baptiſe infants readie to die, he compelled them to this dutie with feare of puniſhment, threatning no leſſe then death if they diſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>beyed. Wherefore the words of S. <hi>Auguſtine,</hi> which doe preciſely exclude the not baptiſed from eternall life, if they be vnderſtood of the ordinary way thither, and the only way that Chriſt hath taught vs, his Maieſtie hath no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing to obiect againſt that opinion: but if it be ſimply de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nied that almightie God can ſaue thoſe which die <hi>vnbap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiſed,</hi>

S. <hi>Auguſtine</hi> was a worthie man, of admirable pie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie, and learning, yet his priuate opinions his Maieſtie al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>loweth not as articles of faith, neither doe you allowe them; for example, Saint <hi>Auguſtine</hi> beleeued, as did <hi>Innocentius</hi> the firſt before him, that the receiuing of the bleſſed Eu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chariſt by infants was no leſſe neceſſarie to their ſaluation then baptiſme, and this he auoucheth in many places of his writings: yet you beleeue it not, neither hath the Church of <hi>England</hi> changed this point of doctrine which ſhe recei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ued from you. Amongſt thoſe things which impoſe <hi>neceſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie of action</hi> vpon ſome perſons, you number mariage. <hi>Si<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>quis ſobolem tollere voluerit:</hi> If any man ſay you deſire to haue iſſue. Againe, ſoone after, when you declare the <hi>neceſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſitie of approbation,</hi> you reckon the choice of liuing in vir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginitie or ſingle life: which things when his Maieſtie read, he diſallowed them not, yet he thought that vnto both ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>amples, ſomething might conueniently be added: for vpon the former it ſeemes to follow, that there is no other neceſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſarie cauſe of mariage, ſaue hope of iſſue. But the Apoſtle S. <hi>Paul</hi> doth teach vs in expreſſe tearmes, that they alſo are bound to prouide for mariage which want the gift of con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinence. If they containe not, ſaith he, let them marrie. This <note place="margin">1. <hi>Cor.</hi> 7. 9.</note> addition is of no ſmall moment. For who knoweth not what occaſion is daily miniſtred in the Church of Rome, of many and horrible crimes, through the contempt of this Apoſtolike rule, through the neglect of this neceſſarie re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>medie? Wherefore in continent perſons his Maieſtie ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceedingly
<pb n="22" facs="tcp:8109:17"/>
commenceth the liuing in the eſtate of virgini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie, or ſingle life: and being by the ſingular mercie of God more familiarly acquainted with the ſacred Scripture, then moſt Princes are, bee knoweth S. <hi>Pauls</hi> ſentence of the whole matter, and the examples extant in both Teſtaments, and the rewards propoſed to them that containe.

His Maieſtie oppoſeth againſt all the cauils of Sophi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſters, yea againſt all humane authoritie whatſoeuer, that oracle, of the holy Spirit, pronounced by the mouth of the Apoſtle; <hi>It is better to marrie then to burne.</hi> For as a wiſe Captaine ought to be more afraid of receiuing ouerthrow, or loſſe to himſelf, then of weakning his enemie: ſo in the election of a mans life, whether he would lead it maried, or ſingle, his Maieſtie thinks that godly men ought in the firſt place to decline the tranſgreſſion of Gods law, and then on Gods name, if any man haue the power, let him vſe that benefit of nature. It is a thredbare cauill, that England is not a lawfull Church, becauſe here wanteth the practiſe of ſuch vowes. But what can the want of vow hinder, as long as wee are not deſtitute of that which is vowed? For here are many Biſhops, and other Paſtors of the Church, who without oſtentation of vow do abſtaine from mariage, and yet leade their liues chaſtly, and ſaintly, without any taint of common ſiniſter report. Moreouer, for the Monaſteries themſelues, his Maieſtie (as he is moſt earneſtly affected vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to pietie and goodneſſe) would not haue diſſolued them, or not all of them, (as I haue heard him often proteſt) if he had found them vncorrupted, and obſeruing the Canons of their firſt inſtitution. But his excellent Maieſtie often wiſheth that the Tridentine Fathers, which could not bee drawne by the entreaties of great Kings and Princes to
<pb n="23" facs="tcp:8109:17"/>
prouide for publike honeſtie on this behalfe, would conſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der with themſelues, from what fountaine this doctrine did flow. For whereas at the firſt, ſingle life was placed amongſt profitable orders, and counſels: afterwards vowes were annexed, at length men came to this abſolute neceſſitie, which now raigneth amongſt you, the law of God being abandoned, and moſt vilely diſgraced. Now whereas in the end of this obſeruation it is added, that they which allow of ſome, and reiect other of thoſe things which the ancient Church beleeued as neceſſarie to ſaluation, although vnder diuers kindes of neceſſitie, haue no reaſon to affirme that they retaine the ſame faith and diſcipline with the ancient Catholike Church; his Maieſtie well enough perceiueth the drift of that ſpeech. He anſwereth therefore, that he wil not extol his own Church, by comparing it to a glaſſe with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out ſpot, or to a face perfectly faire without wrinkle, or ble<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſh: he leaueth ſuch Pharaſaiſme to others. Yet that this he knoweth euidently, that if queſtion be made concerning the eſſentiall markes of the Church, or if you looke at thoſe things which are plainly neceſſarie to ſaluation, or reſpect order, and decencie in the Church; you ſhall not finde a Church in the whole world (God be praiſed for it) more approching to the faith, and faſhion of the ancient Catho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>like. His Maieſtie excepts none, no not the Church of Rome: which by new inuentions deuiſed for increaſe of ſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perſtition, and for the eſtabliſhing of her dominion ouer Princes, and people, hath manifeſtly turned, and changed the faith, and diſcipline of the ancient Catholike, and ſwar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ued infinitly in many things from the puritie and ſimplici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie of the primitiue Church.</p>

               <p>THis condition will ſeeme vnreaſonable to them which would haue the vniuerſall hiſtorie of the primitiue Church, concluded within the Acts of the Apoſtles, which is but one little, though moſt ſacred and diuine book. The moſt equall and prudent King is farre from this opinion: who in his Monitorie Epiſtle hath ingenuouſly declared how highly he eſteemeth of the Fathers, which liued in the fourth, and fifth age. Neither doth his Maieſtie doubt to pronounce with S. <hi>Auguſt<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
                  </hi> that look what the Church hath duly obſerued from her firſt originall vnto thoſe times, and for any man to offer to reiect that as impious, <hi>it is a point of most inſolent madnes.</hi> For his Maieſtie heretofore hath vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fainedly proteſted, that hee approoueth of thoſe markes of truth giuen by <hi>Vincentius Lirinenſis: à principio, vbique &amp; ſemper:</hi> that is, from the beginning, euery where, and euer. Wherefore, the King, and the Church of England, in that they admit of the foure firſt generall Councels, therein they ſufficiently declare that they conclude not the time of the true, and lawfull Church within the compaſſe of one, or two ages: but that they extend it much further, compriſing the time of <hi>Marcion</hi> the Emperor, vnder whom the Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cell of Chalcedon was kept. But whereas in this obſeruatio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> you more eſteeme the times after <hi>Conſtantine,</hi> then the
<pb n="25" facs="tcp:8109:18"/>
times going before, that his Maieſtie thinketh ſomewhat ſtrange, and indeed doth not allow it. He granteth that the Church of the fourth age floriſhed aboue the former in ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ternall glorie, and ſplendure, in wealth, and plentie of lear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned men: but that the Church of the former ages was equal with it, or excelled as touching the orthodoxall rightneſſe of faith, and ſinceritie of incorrupt diſcipline, he is perſwa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded that none can make any doubt. We finde euery where in the holy Fathers of the fourth age, <hi>Baſil, Nazianzen, Ie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rome, Chryſostome, Augustine,</hi> and others, moſt grieuous complaints of the faults and ſundrie deprauations of their Churches. Neither can it be doubted, that the further men liued from the firſt originall, the further alſo they departed from the originall puritie, and ſinceritie. Wherefore when there is a ſerious purpoſe to clenſe, and to ſweepe the houſe of God, why ſhould not an eſpeciall regard bee had to the time of the Apoſtles, or the times neere the time of the A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſtles? It is true indeed, that for the greateſt part of that time the godly Chriſtians did liue in obſcuritie, in pouertie, and miſerie, by reaſon of perpetuall perſecution: yet conſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der well, if in this ſenſe alſo it be not better to goe into the houſe of mourning, then into the houſe of mirth. Pouertie and miſerie are called the ſiſters of good minde: riches, and <note place="margin">

The ſecond rule is this: When the Fathers do not ſpeake as Doctors, nor ſay that this, or that is thus to be done, or thus to bee beleeued: but when as witneſſes of thoſe things which the vniuerſall Church of their times beleeued or practiſed, they affirme this to be the faith or practiſe of that Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tholike Church through the whole world: then they are ſo much to be honoured, that ſuch an affirmation must be held ſufficient to proue the vnanimitie, and conſent of the Church.</p>

But be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe the controuerſies of theſe daies are not about ceremo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nies, and other matters of lighter moment, but about ſome articles of faith, and opinions appertaining to ſaluation: therefore his iudgement is that aboue all there be a gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rall agreement vpon this rule, that opinions concerning matters of faith, and whatſoeuer ſhould be beleeued as ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſarie to ſaluation, ought to bee taken out of the ſacred Scripture alone, neither muſt they depend vpon the autho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritie of any mortall man, but vpon the word of God only, wherein hee hath declared his will vnto vs by his holy Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit.

The Church of England doth religiouſly beleeue that which ſhe reades, and with the ſame religion ſhe is not inquiſitiue into that which ſhe reades not. They acknowledge, and teach that this is a great myſterie which cannot be comprehended, much leſſe declared by the facultie of mans wit: but concerning the power and efficacie of it, their opinion is with all ſacred re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uerence. They command thoſe which come vnto this ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lie table diligently to ſearch all the ſecret corners of their conſciences: to make confeſſion of their ſinnes vnto God, and if need be to the Prieſt alſo. They carefully warne the commers that they compoſe their mindes vnto all humili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie, and deuotion: they receiue the Communion of the bodie of Chriſt vpon their knees: and they doe not onely diuide the myſticall bread amongſt the faithfull in their publike aſſemblies, but they giue it alſo to thoſe which be towards death, <hi>pro viatico;</hi> that is, for victuals in their iour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ney, as the Fathers of the Nicene Councell, and all antiqui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie doe call it.

If this doctrine of his Maieſtie, and the Church of England doe not giue you ſatisfaction, then what remaines but that hee yeeld vnto the opinion of Tranſubſtantiation, if he will be friends with you? But that is not piouſly to beleeue the ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritie of the thing, but with importunate curioſitie to decree the manner thereof: which the King and his Church will neuer doe, will neuer allow.

yet the Church of England hath not ſatisfied you in this point, which in publike writings hath ſo often auouched her beleefe hereof. Wherefore that you may certainly know what is beleeued, and what is taught in this Church concerning that matter, I haue heere ſet downe a whole place out of the right reuerend the Lord Biſhop of Ely his booke againſt Cardinall <hi>Bellarmine,</hi> which ſome few mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neths agoe he publiſhed. Thus he ſaith in the firſt chapter: <hi>Our Sauiour Christ ſaid, this is my bodie, not, after this man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner is my bodie: whereof the Cardinall is not ignorant vnleſſe willingly, and wittingly. We agree with you concerning the ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iect, all the ſtrife is about the manner. Concerning this is, wee beleeue firmely that it is: concerning after this manner it is, to wit, that the bread is tranſubſtantiate into his bodie, after what manner it is done, whether by, or in, or vnder, or beyond, there is not a word in the Goſpell: and becauſe there is no word; therefore we haue reaſon to baniſh it from beleefe. We number it per aduenture amongst the decrees of the ſchoole, but not a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mongst the articles of faith. That which</hi> Durandus <hi>is repor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted to haue ſaid, doth not diſlike vs: we heare the word, we per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiue the ſound, we know not the manner: we beleeue the pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſence, we beleeue, I ſay, the true preſence aſwell as you: concer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning the manner of the preſence we doe not vnaduiſedly define. Nay more, we doe not ſcrupulouſlie enquire: No more then we doe in Baptiſme how the blood of Christ clenſeth vs: no more then we doe in the incarnation of Christ how the diuine nature is vnited in one perſon with the humane. We reckon it amongst the myſteries (and indeed the Eucharist is a myſterie) the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mainders whereof ſhould be conſumed with fire: That is, (as the fathers doe elegantly vnderſtand it) which ſhould be adored by faith, not debated by reaſon.</hi> This is the ſaith of the King, this is the faith of the Church of England. Who (that I may ſummarily compriſe the whole matter) doe beleeue that in the Supper of the Lord they are made really partakers of the bodie and blood of Chriſt, (as the Greeke Fathers ſpeake, and as <hi>Bellarmine</hi> himſelfe confeſſeth) ſpiritually.

And that theſe things which you practiſe contrarie to the cuſtome of the ancient Church, might be aboliſhed. For it is certaine that the celebration of the Euchariſt without any communicants, and all that merchandiſe of priuate Maſſes, condemned by many of your owne Diuines, tooke their originall from the peruerſe doctrine concerning this ſacrifice. And whereas for the de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liuering of the ſoules of the deceaſed from the flames of Purgatorie, the neceſſitie of many Maſſes is vrged, his Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ieſtie doubteth not, but that this is a dotage of idle braines, and ſuch as for their owne gaine doe wickedly abuſe the ſimplicitie of the people.

                  <p>THat it was a very ancient cuſtome in the publike pray<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers of the Church to make commemoration of the de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceaſed, and to deſire of God reſt for their ſoules, which died in the peace of the Church, few are ignorant, much leſſe is it vnknowne vnto his Maieſtie. Neither is there any doubt but that this cuſtome ſprung from a vehement affection of charitie. Likewiſe the ancient Church hereby gaue teſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monie of the reſurrection to come. This cuſtome, although the Church of England condemneth not in the firſt ages, yet ſhe thinketh not good to retaine it now for diuers and weightie cauſes, ſome whereof I will touch heere. Firſt, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe ſhe is verely perſwaded that without any precept of Chriſt, the ſupreme Lawgiuer of his Church, this cuſtome was introducted, neither could the contrarie hitherto bee demonſtrated by any of your Doctors. Wherfore, although his Maieſty doth not take vpon him, as he hath proteſted in his Monitorie epiſtle, to condemne an ordinance which is approued by y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> practiſe of the ancient Church, yet he is vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>doubtedly perſwaded that his Church is not bound by any neceſſitie to obſerue it. For whatſoeuer the ancient Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtian Fathers haue done on this part, all that his Maieſtie re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerreth vnto the head of things profitable, or lawfull: of which wee haue ſpoken in the ſecond <hi>obſeruation:</hi> neither can it be prooued that this cuſtome is to be referred vnto thoſe things which are of abſolute neceſſitie. For whence ſhould this neceſſitie ſpring? not from the law of God, for he neuer commanded it: and if it flow not from that foun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taine, it is no neceſſitie. For wee haue alreadie laid this ground, that nothing ought to be accounted neceſſarie to ſaluation, which is not either expreſſely contained in Gods
<pb n="34" facs="tcp:8109:23"/>
word, or thence by neceſſarie conſequence deducted. And wee haue declared, that ſuch things as the ancient Church beleeued, or practiſed without neceſſitie, the ſame ought now alſo to be left with libertie vnto vs. A ſecond reaſon is, that although his Maieſtie acknowledgeth the authors of this cuſtome to haue been very ancient, yet no man hi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>therto could proue, that ſuch was the vſe in the beginning, and in the Apoſtolike times, which is the fountaine of all antiquitie in the Church. Beſides that, the prayers then vſed doe much differ both in their end, and manner, from theſe which are now practiſed, and taught. A third reaſon is ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded by his Maieſtie, that when once prayer for the dead tooke place amongſt Church rites, not long after a rout of ſhamefull errours, and doting ſuperſtitions did band toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, and breake into the Church. Now let indifferent ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bitratours iudge to whom the name of Catholike ſhould be denied: whether to the King, and his ſubiects, which by reaſon of errours enſuing haue left off, or thinke it not law<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full to vſe a cuſtome grounded vpon no neceſſitie: or to your men, which by ſophiſticall cauillations, and incredible obſtinacie had rather maintaine, then reforme all the errors of former ages, though neuer ſo groſſe, and pernicious.</p>

Moreouer, ſome others haue openly taught, that our Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uiour Chriſt hath reſerued the <hi>ſeueritie of iuſtice</hi> vnto him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelfe, but <hi>indulgence</hi> and <hi>mercie</hi> he hath granted to the bleſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed Virgin. Againe, how haue they diſtributed offices, and powers of healing amongſt the Saints with wonderfull cu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rioſitie, or rather deteſtable ſuperſtition? And heretofore their ſuffrages only were deſired, that being gracious with God almightie they would make interceſſion for men: but afterwards, the world was filled with bookes concerning the proper ſeruice of this, or that Saint, and peculiar formes of prayer to be made vnto them. Wherefore in place of that diuine booke of the Pſalter, which the ancient Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtians neuer laid out of their hands; which was the ſolace of men and women, yong and old, rich and poore, learned and vnlearned, there haue ſucceeded the Houres of our La<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>die, and Legends; or rather impious, and doting fables (I ſpeake not of the true hiſtories of Martyrs) and ſuch vile ſtuffe. And yet further, as if it were not iniurie enough to robbe Chriſtians of ſo neceſſarie and diuine a booke, one of your men hath turned all the Pſalmes to the honour of the bleſſed Virgin, attributing vnto her (as if there were no difference betwixt the creature and the Creator) whatſoe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uer was prophecied concerning the onely Sonne of God. His excellent Maieſtie doth extoll the happineſſe of the moſt glorious virgin mother of our Lord, affirming that ſhe is eleuated vnto the higheſt degree of honour, which God the Creator could impart to any humane creature: he re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ioyceth alſo that the Church of England vpon ſet daies in
<pb n="36" facs="tcp:8109:24"/>
the yeere doth ſolemnize the honoured memorie of that moſt bleſſed Virgin: but the Sophiſters of theſe times can by no cunning euer perſwade him to allow, or endure that Pſalter of our Ladie. For as touching Cardinall <hi>Bellarmine,</hi> which hath lately defended it, his Maieſtie is perſwaded that he is diſtaſted of your owne, as many as haue but any ſmall ſenſe of pietie. Conſidering then that the Church of Rome is almoſt deadly ſicke of ſuch inward diſeaſes, his Maieſtie wondred (moſt illuſtrious Cardinall) when hee read in your epiſtle that the inuocation of Saints, as your men doe now practiſe it, is the ſame which was in vſe in the primitiue Church. Wherefore his Maieſtie anſwereth in few words: Firſt, it cannot be proued that in the begin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning of the primitiue Church, any other but the almightie God was inuoked: ſecondly, that there is no precept in the word of God for it, no one footſtep of any example: God onely was adored, God onely was implored through the interceſſion of his onely begotten Sonne, the one and only Mediatour betwixt God and man. Afterwards was brought in the vſe of praying at the ſepulchres of Martyrs: then began the making of apoſtrophees vnto Saints, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſides the worſhip of God: then the making of vowes, and prayers, not primarily to pray them, but that they ſhould pray God. Yet if theſe new examples had gone no further, his Maieſtie would not greatly haue reprooued the cuſtome of thoſe times, at the leaſt not ſo much condemned it as the abuſes which hereupon enſued. For his Maieſtie doth honour the bleſſed Martyrs, and other Saints which now raigne with Chriſt the head of both Churches, tri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>umphant and militant: neither doubteth he of their conti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nuall prayers for the neceſſities of the Church, beleeuing ſtedfaſtly the benefit thereof: but hee confeſſeth ingenu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ouſly that hee knoweth no reaſon whereby any man can promiſe or warrant vs that they heare our prayers, and that wee ſhould account them as our houſehold gods; and pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tectors. Wherefore hee exceedingly diſliketh that which followed in after-ages. For by degrees it came to that
<pb n="37" facs="tcp:8109:24"/>
which I haue ſhewed, which the Church of England affir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>meth to be impious in the extreame. And if there bee ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>amples extant in the Fathers of the fourth age for this inuo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cation (as no doubt there are, neither doth the King denie it) yet this is a teſtimonie of the decay of ancient ſimplici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie, and of an euill then growing; but in no reſpect compa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rable with that which in the Church of Rome at this day is openly practiſed, tolerated, and defended. Laſtly, although the holy Fathers did allow the cuſtom of that time amongſt things profitable, or lawfull, yet they neuer accounted of it as a thing neceſſarie to ſaluation, which is the preſent ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gument of our ſpeech. And thus much concerning the foure obiections againſt the Engliſh Liturgie.</p>
                  <p>Now his Maieſtie commendeth your iudgement, that amongſt all the things which you diſlike in his religion, you haue made choice eſpecially of thoſe which concerne matters of Church aſſemblies, and diuine ſeruice. For the communion of the faithfull conſiſteth much in the publike exerciſes of pietie: and this is the chiefe bond of vnion ſo much deſired by good men. Wherefore if Chriſtians could but agree about this, why might not all Europe communi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cate together? only, granting a libertie to ſchoole-Diuines with moderation to debate other opinions. Which were a thing much to be wiſhed, and that foundation once laid, by the helpe of God, much hope might be conceiued of the reſt. For this cauſe his excellent Maieſtie greatly commen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding your iudgement herein, hath himſelfe likewiſe heere deliuered, what things in your Liturgie he thinketh wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thie to bee reprooued. But if, for the want of theſe foure things in the Engliſh Liturgie, you think there is iuſt cauſe, that they which vſe it ſhould neither be accounted, nor cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led Catholikes: then conſider, I pray you, what his Maie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtie may pronounce of the Church of Rome, in whoſe Li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turgie (for hee paſſeth other points of your religion) godly men haue obſerued ſo many things manifeſtly repugnant to the word of God, and the ancient Catholike faith. Which things neuertheleſſe the Pope had rather maintaine,
<pb n="38" facs="tcp:8109:25"/>
then reforme, when the truth now ſhineth ſo cleerely. And here although his Maieſty could eaſily rehearſe many grie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uous abuſes in the Romane Liturgie; yet it pleaſeth him to name only foure, which he oppoſeth to the other foure na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med by you. The firſt is the vſe of an vnknowne tongue, contrarie to the precept of S. <hi>Paul,</hi> and the practiſe of the primitiue Church, to whom in their aſſemblies nothing was dearer then the good, and edification of the hearers. Wherefore the Fathers prouided the tranſlation of Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture into all languages: and, as <hi>Epiphanius</hi> noteth in the end of his third booke, they had <hi>their Interpreters,</hi> who, if need were, did tranſlate one language into another, <hi>in their</hi>

Surely, that the things read were ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nerally vnderſtood, this alone is ſufficient proofe, that in moſt of the Homilies of the Greeke and Latin Fathers, wee meete with theſe words, <hi>vt audiſtis legi,</hi> or, <hi>vt hodie lectum eſt:</hi> as you heard it read, or as it was read to day. Which if your preachers ſhould ſay, were it not ridiculous? when the poore people vnderſtand nothing that is read out of the Scriptures, notwithſtanding they haue more need then the people of old time. For the ancient Doctors vrged euery one to reade the Bible diligently in their houſes, which now vnder paine of excommunication they are forbidden to touch; vnleſſe they obtaine a diſpenſation. So that the ſacred word of God (I tremble to ſpeake it) hath now the firſt place in the catalogue of bookes prohibited. His Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ieſtie knoweth that amongſt you there may be found ſome Bibles tranſlated into vulgar languages: but the Engliſh Prieſts at Do way, which turned the Scripture into Engliſh, haue taught him thus much, that you were conſtrained a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt your willes to make thoſe tranſlations, <hi>importunitate haereticorum,</hi> by the importunitie of the heretikes, as they of Do way ſpeake. For it is hereſie with theſe men to be de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſirous to reade the word of God with ſobrietie, and reue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rence. Neither is his Maieſtie ignorant, when <hi>Renatus Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nedictus</hi> Prieſt tranſlated the Bible into French, how the
<pb n="39" facs="tcp:8109:25"/>
Popes of Rome troubled him for that fact, and how by their letters they commanded the Biſhop of Paris to endeuour that all the French tranſlations might be extorted from the people. Which without faile they had effected, if there had been no Proteſtants in France. His Maieſtie hath read of late alſo in a booke of a certaine Engliſh Pontifician Prieſt, that prayers vttered in an vnknowne tongue haue a kinde of greater efficacie in them, then if they were vnderſtood. Which ſenſeleſſe dotage was an old heathniſh conceit, and is not the ſingular follie of this Prieſt alone. So the Valen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinian heretikes did vſe Hebrew names in their ſuperſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tious myſteries, that they might amaze the ignorant mul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>titude: and, as <hi>Euſebius</hi> ſpeaketh in the fourth part of his Hiſtorie, <hi>the more to astoniſh thoſe that were initiated in their</hi>

                     <hi>ſuperstitions.</hi> The ſecond abuſe is, the diminiſhing of the holie Sacrament, contrarie to the inſtitution of Chriſt, the example of S. <hi>Paul,</hi> and the practiſe of the Church, for the ſpace of one thouſand yeeres at leaſt, as <hi>Caſſander</hi> a learned man confeſſeth. In the third place are priuate Maſſes, where are no communicants. I haue ſaid before that theſe things had their beginning from that peruerſe doctrine concer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning the ſacrifice in the Chriſtian Church. Reſtore vs the ancient faith, and the ancient practiſe. In the fourth place his Maieſtie obiecteth the preſent vſe and adoration of Images. The Councell of Trent confeſſeth an abuſe, and the Romane Catechiſme giueth ſome profitable admoni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion on this behalfe. But what are we the better? the abuſe remaineth, it is approued, maintained, and encreaſeth daily. His Maieſtie omitteth the adoration, and inuocation of Saints: which as it is now practiſed, neither can, nor ought to be excuſed. He omitteth alſo the religious adoration of reliques, which at this day is taught and commanded as a thing neceſſarie, or at leaſt very profitable to ſaluation. Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſide the intollerable abſurditie: as when falſe or ridiculous reliques are obtruded, as the teares of Chriſt, and the milke of our Ladie, and ſuch like. Hee omitteth the licentious boldnes of your preachers, when they ſtray from the word
<pb n="40" facs="tcp:8109:26"/>
of God; who ought to bee reſtrained from propounding any doctrine to the people as neceſſarie to ſaluation, which is not drawne out of the diuine oracles, and agreeable to the ancient faith. For that is the wholeſome doctrine which the Apoſtle ſo often commendeth. If there were ſuch a re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtraint, many things now practiſed in the Church of Rome, would fall downe of their owne accord. As the doctrine of Indulgences: as that foppiſh deuice of the intenſiue paines in Purgatorie: by vertue of which intenſion many thou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſand yeeres are contained in one minute: as thoſe <hi>battolo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>giae,</hi> or idle repetition of heedleſſe prayers, vnpleaſing to our Sauiour, as he himſelfe witneſſeth. Then it would no longer be accounted great merit to repeate the Roſarie, or other prayers, and Pſalmes twentie, or fiftie, or an hundred times. If theſe and ſuch like impediments were remoued, religious men ſhould peraduenture finde no iuſt cauſe to abſtaine from your communion. There is another thing which his Maieſtie thought good not to omit, which is written in the end of your Epiſtle: that you will be ſilent concerning the Pope of Rome, becauſe it is manifeſt, to thoſe which haue but meane skill in Eccleſiaſticall hiſtorie, that the Fathers of the firſt ages, the Councels, and Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtian Emperours in all buſineſſe appertaining to religion and the Church, gaue him the preheminence, and acknow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledged him the chiefe. That this is all for this point, which your Church requireth to be beleeued as an article of faith, by thoſe whom you receiue into communion. To this his Maieſtie maketh anſwere: and, appealing to your owne vnpartiall minde, he deſireth you to conſider the actions of Romane Biſhops for almoſt ſeuen hundred yeeres paſt. He is loth to ſtirre the remembrance of things noiſome, yet gladly would hee haue you know, that hee is moſt certaine of this: that the late Biſhops of that ſea are ſo vnlike vnto the ancient Popes in ſinceritie of faith, in manner of life, and in the whole courſe and end of their gouernment, that it is altogether vniuſt, things being in this ſtate, to draw arguments from the former ages, and applic them to this
<pb n="41" facs="tcp:8109:26"/>
preſent time. Let the forme of the ancient Church be reſto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red, and many new lawes heretofore not heard of be abo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liſhed. In briefe, let the Biſhop of Rome declare euidently by his actions that he ſeeketh Gods glorie, not his owne; that he hath a care of the peace, and ſaluation of his people: then his Maieſtie, as he hath proteſted before in his Moni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>torie Epiſtle, will acknowledge his primacie, and be willing to ſay with Gregorie Nazianzen, <hi>that he hath the care of the</hi>

                     <hi>whole Church.</hi> But at this time what the Church of God, eſpecially Kings and Princes, ought to thinke concerning that ſea, his Maieſtie dare referre it to your owne iudge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment to determine. For you know what a number of books come abroad daily from Rome, and almoſt all the corners of Europe, in defence of the Popes temporall power, or ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther omnipotencie, his dominion, and monarchie ouer all the Kings, and people of the whole earth. You know that Cardinall <hi>Bellarmine</hi> hath of late written concerning that argument, and ſoone after the death of <hi>Henry</hi> the Great, hath been bold to publiſh that, which all honeſt men of your owne ſide doe deteſt. I ſay, all honeſt men: for the complices of that conſpiracie doe heartily embrace, and to their power defend it as an oracle from the mouth of the Pope, which cannot erre. Wherefore the Ieſuits of Ingol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtade in a booke lately publiſhed againſt Maſter <hi>Iohn Gor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>don,</hi> the Deane of Salisburie, a man nobly borne, and very learned, doe cite teſtimonies out of this booke of the Car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinals, as if it were the conſtant opinion, and conſent of all Catholikes. But I deſire your Honour to conſider whether the ancient Church euer did the like to this, and what will be the iſſue of this madneſſe. Conſider into what danger of vtter ruine they bring the Church of Chriſt, which doe ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proue, or ſuffer ſuch things as are now practiſed, and taught. For, to conclude, as long as matters ſtand thus with you, and yet you denie that you haue been the cauſe of the di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uiſion, it were meere doltiſhnes, and follie to imagine any reconciliation amongſt the diuided me<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>bers of the Church. The laſt point in your letters was this: that you are able to
<pb n="42" facs="tcp:8109:27"/>
demonſtrate cleerely what good conſent there is betwixt the Church of Rome, and the ſeas of the other Patriarches in theſe points which are now in controuerſie. But his Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ieſtie thinketh that you may ſpare that labour. For hee knoweth, and ſo doe others that are deſirous to prie into ſuch matters, that not the Weſt Church alone, but the Eaſt alſo, the Churches in the South and North parts of the world haue degenerated farre from the golden ſinceritie of former ages, and peraduenture further then might ſeeme poſſible: but that the reuolting from the ancient faith muſt come to paſſe of neceſſitie, being foretold by the oracles of God. He knoweth alſo how thoſe nations haue daily hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ped ceremonies vpon ceremonies, and how for more then theſe thouſand yeeres ſuperſtitious men haue been too pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſumptuous in that kinde. But when wee treat of reforming the Church of God, the queſtion is not what the Eaſt Church, or the Moſcouites Church doe practiſe, or be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leeue: but this is the queſtion, what the Apoſtles haue taught from the beginning, and what the Catholike Church hath practiſed in her times, and in the ages next fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowing. That, that, is the paterne which the King doth in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>genuouſly, and from his heart confeſſe that he would imi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tate without all exception. Neuertheleſſe, ſuch as are skil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full in Eccleſiaſticall matters, they will not grant you this neither: that the doctrine of the Romane Church doth a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gree in all points with that which is taught in the Churches of other Patriarches. For to omit your worſhipping of Ima<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ges, your fire of Purgatorie, your preciſe obſeruation of ſingle life, and the infinite power of the Pope, euen aboue Councels: to ſay nothing of theſe, and other articles: yet it is manifeſt that in the celebration of the ſacred Euchariſt, the Grecians doe much differ from you Romanes. In ſo much that <hi>Marcus</hi> the Archbiſhop of Epheſus ſpeaking of the Romane Maſſe, doth affirme that in matters of grea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teſt moment it is contrarie to the word of God, and the an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cient Liturgies. <hi>It is manifestly repugnant</hi> (ſaith he) <hi>to the axpoſitions and interpretations which wee haue receiued by</hi>
                     <pb n="43" facs="tcp:8109:27"/>
                     <hi>tradition, and to the words of our Lord, and to the meaning of thoſe words.</hi> And of thoſe which defend the Romane rites concerning this matter, the ſame <hi>Marcus</hi> pronounceth, <hi>that they deſerue to be pitied both in regard of their double ig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>norance, and their profound ſottiſhneſſe.</hi> But thus much is e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nough for this preſent. Now you haue heard (moſt Illu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrious Cardinall) the reaſons wherefore his excellent Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ieſtie of great Britaine; after the reading of your letters, doth, neuertheleſſe truſting in the mercie of God, beleeue, and maintaine that he, and his Church are Catholike. Who if he were not inflamed with an infinit deſire of furthering the publique peace, or if he ſuppoſed that you were other<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>waies affected, he would haue ſpared the labour of this an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwere. Eſpecially, becauſe his Maieſtie calling to minde the daily writings and practiſes of your men, is now (as I ſaid before) ſtedfaſtly perſwaded that through their dealings there remaine no meanes or hope of reconciliation. For they are reſolued to defend all; and not to grow better, or by the ſerious reformation of things depraued to winne the mindes of the godly. In which reſolution as long as they perſiſt, and will not yeeld one iot to antiquitie, and truth, his Maieſtie profeſſeth once for all that he regardeth them not, neither will hee euer haue any communion with the Church of Rome. So his Maieſtie humbly prayeth to our Lord Ieſus Chriſt, that he would vouchſafe to direct thoſe excellent gifts of minde, which he hath plentifully be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtowed vpon you, to the honour of his name, and the benefit of his Church. And I humbly take my leaue of your Honour.</p>
