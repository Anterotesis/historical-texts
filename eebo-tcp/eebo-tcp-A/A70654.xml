            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            <p>Secondly, what by <hi>perishing;</hi> how the good man may be said to <hi>perish.</hi> You know to perish in the common acceptation is taken in the <hi>worst sense,</hi> to be cut off from the Land of the living by the hand of God in wrath and fury, and their soules cast for ever into the pit of Hell; but thus the good man perisheth not; though the <hi>wicked be driven away to</hi> Hell in <hi>his wickednesse, yet the righ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teous</hi>

Many excellent lessons doe these words hold forth unto us: As first</p>
            <p>The Prophet makes the Churches condition his own, with <hi>Aaron</hi> bearing them on his shoulders, on his brest-plate, yea in his very heart. If it be ill with the Church, you may discerne it in his countenance, heare it by his speech. If well, by the cheerefullnesse of his


<pb n="5" facs="tcp:54184:6"/>
spirit. If they be afflicted, he mournes; if they rejoyce, he is cheerefull with them.</p>
            <p>Secondly, the Prophet observes all his people, whose faces stand towards <hi>heaven,</hi> who looke another way; who are Saints, who are Children of <hi>Belial;</hi> is diligent to know the state of his flock.</p>
            <p>Thirdly, that it is no new thing to find in the Church of God, <hi>many evill,</hi> and <hi>few good;</hi> in Gods field, <hi>many tares, little good Corne;</hi> in his <hi>Barne floar, much chaffe,</hi> and <hi>little Wheat;</hi> in his <hi>great house, many Vessels of dishonour,</hi> and <hi>few of honour; many stones, few precious stones;</hi> in his <hi>drag. Net abundance of weeds,</hi> many <hi>bad Fishes,</hi> and <hi>few good ones;</hi> in his <hi>Vineyard,</hi> many <hi>wilde grapes,</hi> and <hi>few right Grapes.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Fourthly, And this also; that even those few Godly men, which are the Churches Treasure, are subject to Death, even immature and untimely death, as well as others. But, I passe over all these, with a bare mention of them; and confine my selfe to these <hi>two Observations,</hi> as most cleerly held forth in the Text, and suitable to this sad meeting.</p>
            <p>First, that <hi>the most excellent and usefull men, are often taken away, when the Church could ill spare them.</hi> The Church at this time did abound (as wee also now doe) with Sons of Belial, compassed about with many Ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mies, and therefore needed the first ripe fruits, many choise Instruments, and yet those very few Shee had were now taken away; <hi>the good man is perished out of the Earth.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Secondly, that <hi>when God doth this, it is a matter of sad lamentation; Woe is mee,</hi> the good Man is perished, <hi>&amp;c.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>The first of these, that <hi>God often takes away choisest men,</hi>

Lord and Saviour Iesus Christ was himself cut off from out of the Land of the living, when he had not <note place="margin">Esa. 53. 8.</note> attained the one half of the age of man.</p>
            <p>This is one of the Lords strangest works, a woke <note place="margin">By Reason. Hereby hepro vides for his owne Glory.</note> wherein his enemies often rejoice, and his people mourne, the reason therefore should diligently bee sought out; in which enquiry wee shall find, that he, whose works are all done with unsearchable wisdome and for excellent ends, doth hereby first provide <hi>for his owne glory,</hi> and that manie waies.</p>
            <p>As first, he often takes away instruments, that it may <note place="margin">His Power.</note> be known that his Church and Cause is not supported by them, but by himself alone; that the Pillars of the Church are not borne up by any created strength, but by him, <hi>Who measureth the water in the hollow of his hand, and weighs the Mountaines in the Scales, and the Hills in a Ballance;</hi> that men may know, <hi>when the youths faint and be wearie, and the young men utterly fall,</hi> the most active and able Instruments brought to nothing, yet the Church is <hi>carried in his bosome,</hi> and by him alone shall <hi>renew its strength, and mount up with wings as an Eagle, run</hi>

               <hi>and not be wearie, walke and not be faint.</hi>
            </p>

Wisdome.</note> takes some away to make way for others, as in the frame of the world the varietie of the creatures indued with their severall abilities doe all serve for the beauty and good of the Vniverse: and thereby set forth the wisdome as well as the power of the <hi>Creator:</hi> so here <hi>Moses</hi> shall have one part, <hi>Ioshuah</hi> another; And <hi>Ioshuah</hi> shal do as excellently in <hi>Canaan</hi> as <hi>Moses</hi> in the <hi>Wildernesse,</hi> he shall honour God as much in the <hi>Milita<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry

And that is the first reason.</p>

if God had been pleased to employ them any longer in his service.</p>
            <p>Secondly, for the <hi>good of them that live,</hi> (though this seem most unlikely) who shall lose nothing by cutting <note place="margin">2.

            <p>First, He hereby cures them of one of the most dan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gerous evills which his people are or can be guilty of, and that is, setting up the instruments of their good to be Idols in their hearts, which they are extream prone to doe; and for this very cause doth the Lord often break these bubbles with the touch of his finger, that his people may thinke of them no otherwise then they are, and for this very reason some thinke the <note place="margin">Deut. 34. 6.</note> Lord buried the body of <hi>Moses,</hi> and would never let the people know where his grave was, because he fore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>saw that they would be ready to worship his dead body.</p>
            <p>Secondly, hereby the Lord doth <hi>humble</hi> his people, and <hi>awe</hi> them with the feare of his wrath, making them sensible of it, in these heavie stroakes, and <hi>quic<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken</hi> them more up to <hi>prayer,</hi> and <hi>serious seeking</hi> after himself, as this Church doth in this place; Woe is me, the good man is perished, the Princes, the Judges, the Nobles &amp;c. are all naught, none to be trusted, nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther Wife, nor Father, nor brother, ver. 7. then fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowes, <hi>therefore will I looke to the Lord, I will wait for the God of my salvation, my God will heare me.</hi> And this les<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son

VVherefore dost thou forget us for ever, and forsake us so long time. Turne thou us, O Lord, unto thee, and we shall be turned.</hi> Now this is one of the greatest blessings in the world, to be put into such an humble, penitent, praying, seeking temper as this is, his <hi>death</hi> which can procure this is like to be more ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vantageous then any mans life.</p>
            <p>Thirdly, Hereby the Lord makes his Church more <hi>sensible</hi> of his <hi>power, goodnesse, and faithfullnesse,</hi> when they shall find all these constantly continued, even when the instruments are taken away. Thus <hi>Moses</hi> the man of God taught the people upon the meditation of all the Sons of men returning to dust, to stay themselves wholly upon God, <hi>who was their dwelling place in all ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nerations, from everlasting to everlasting, a God all-suf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficient.</hi>

               <hi>Noahs</hi> time, as soon as God had housed him in the Arke, he presently sent in the flood upon the World of the ungodly: and in <hi>Lots</hi> time, as soon as the righteous man, vexed with the unclean conversation of <hi>Sodome,</hi> was removed from them, presently God rained fire and Brimstone from Heaven, and destroied those five Ci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties: <note place="margin">2 King. 23.</note> thus was it in <hi>Iosiahs</hi> time, as soon as he slept with his fathers, all that fierce wrath of God wherewith his anger was kindled against <hi>Iudah</hi> and <hi>Ierusalem,</hi> which was kept in all the while <hi>Josiah</hi> lived, brake out to the removing of <hi>Judah</hi> and <hi>Jerusalem</hi> out of his sight.</p>
            <p>Give me leave now to make a brief application of <note place="margin">Vses.</note> this: First, Is this so, <hi>doth God often times take away the most usefull men, when his Church hath most need of them;</hi> then let all the Church learn <hi>never to rest on men, how excellent so ever.</hi> I begin with this first, because it is our great and generall sinne, that we either <hi>vilifie</hi> or <hi>deifie</hi> all Gods instruments, either respecting them lesse or more then God will have us: if God give us any pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cious jewels, we deal as the <hi>Israelites</hi> did in the wilder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse, turne our golden Eare-Rings into an Idol, and thereby change our glory into our shame and misery, offering infinite injury unto God, who gives us these meanes to use, but not to depend upon; to bring us neerer to him, not as we sinfully make them occasions to draw us further from him; this is a very great sinne, whereby we <hi>lose the taste of Gods goodnesse,</hi> while wee choose to respect the stream rather then the Fountain, and even take our <hi>heart off from God,</hi> and stay too much upon the creature, making our comfort to ebbe and flow according as these weak props doe break or hold, and <hi>even compell God to deprive us of them,</hi> as <hi>Ezekiah</hi> u<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>used

To my owne knowledge, some good men have said of some choise Instruments, whose hearts were right with God, and zealous in his cause, <hi>These are the men who must do the deed;</hi> God will certainly deliver us by their hands: Who when they have heard of the sud<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>den and unseasonable cutting off of those men, have bin forced to lay their hand upon their mouth, and to say, <hi>What fooles are we to expect any great things from Man,</hi> whose breath is in his Nostrils.

Certainly, whoever lookes for much from men, how excellent soever, will prove like men who go to lotteries, with their head full of hopes, and returne with their hearts full of blankes.</p>

            <p>ANd now the more particular Application of all this, brings me directly to the sad occasion of this present meeting; even to lament the fall of <hi>this</hi> choice and excellent man, in whose death the Al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mighty testifies against us, and even fills us with gall and wormwood. I know you come hither to mourn, so fully prepared for it, that although <hi>I</hi> am but a dull Oratour to move passion, I may serve well enough to draw out those tears, wherewith your hearts and eyes are so big and full: there is no need to call for the <hi>mourning women, that they may come; and for cunning women, that they may take up a wailing,</hi> to helpe <hi>your eyes to run downe with teares, and your eye-lids to gush out with waters:</hi> the very looking downe upon <hi>this Beere,</hi> and <note place="margin">Ier. 9. 1<gap reason="illegible" extent="1 letter">

               </note> the naming of <hi>the man</hi> whose corps are here placed, and a very little speech of his worth, and our misera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble losse, is enough to make this Assembly (like <hi>Ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chel)</hi>

            <p>I know, large encomiasticall praises of the dead, unlesse their lives were eminent in goodnesse, and free from any notable blot, are much condemned by the most judicious and godly <hi>Divines,</hi> as a thing of very evill consequence: first, to the <hi>Minister</hi> himself, who hereby is evill spoken of, as a man who for a re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward, or some other base respect (like unworthy He<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ralds) will give greatest badges of honour to any ig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>noble person. Secondly, to the <hi>deceased,</hi> whilest it occasions some others, who haply knew them better, to <hi>rake</hi> into their lives, and lay open their former faults, which otherwise had been buried in oblivion. Thirdly, but the worst of all is, that wicked men make this a fearfull <hi>stumbling-blocke;</hi> who when they heare such men highly commended, in whom peradventure they knew such and such enormities, doe hereupon conclude, that our preaching for abandoning of all evill is of no great necessity, even in the Preachers <hi>own</hi> judgement; who sends men to heaven in his Funerall Orations, who yet <hi>lived,</hi> and (for ought they know) <hi>dyed</hi> in the practice of such things as the Minister u<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>seth to declaime against. But I am called to speake of a man <hi>so eminent</hi> and <hi>excellent,</hi> so <hi>wise</hi> and <hi>gracious,</hi> so <hi>good</hi> and <hi>usefull,</hi> whose <hi>works</hi> so <hi>praise him in every gate,</hi> that if I should altogether hold my tongue, the chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren and babes (I had almost said, the <hi>stones)</hi> would speak: upon whose Herse could I scatter the sweetest flowers, the highest expressions of <hi>Rhetoricke</hi> and <hi>elo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quence,</hi> you would thinke I fell short of his worth; you would say, <hi>this very name, JOHN PYM,</hi> ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>presseth

just fruit of all these) the high and deare esteeme and respect which <hi>hee</hi> had purchased in the hearts of all men of every ranke, who were acquainted with <hi>him;</hi> such onely excepted, of whom to bee loved and well reported, is scarce compatible with true vertue: All men who knew <hi>him,</hi> either lov'd or hated <hi>him</hi> in ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tremity: such as were good, extremely delighted in <hi>him,</hi> as taken in a sweet captivity with his matchlesse worth; the bad as much hated Him, out of their an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tipathy against it.</p>
            <p>But, all these things (though most desirable and ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cellent in their place) I passe over, and shall insist only upon <hi>two things,</hi> which alone are desirable in any man, which indeed make a man <hi>more precious then Gold, then the fine gold of Ophir: First, he</hi> was a <hi>true Christian man,</hi> a faithfull servant of <hi>Iesus Christ,</hi> one who long since <hi>was borne againe of Water and the Holy Ghost,</hi> engratted into <hi>Christ,</hi> adopted to be the Childe of God justified freely by his grace, renewed in the spirit of his mind, sanctified throughout, in spirit, soule and body: one who had made God his portion, and Gods word his guide: who in his whole course had left off to fashion himselfe according to the World, but in all things studied to know (as his rule) what was the good and perfect will of God: in a word, He <hi>was a true Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thaniel, in whom there was no guile.</hi>

               </hi> was, was onely to promote the publike good: in and for this <hi>Heliv'd,</hi> in and by this <hi>He</hi> died. And this excellent usefull spirit of <hi>His,</hi> was accompanied with <hi>three</hi> ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mirable properties, wherein he excelled all that ever I knew, and most that ever I read of: <hi>First,</hi> such <hi>single<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse of heart,</hi> that no by respect could any whit sway <hi>him;</hi> no respect of any Friend: <hi>He</hi> regarded them in their due place, but knew neither Brother, Kinsman, not Friend, Superior nor Inferior, when they stood in the way to hinder his pursuit of the publike good: <hi>Magis amica Respublica:</hi> And he used to say, <hi>Such a one is my entire friend, to whom I am much obliged, but I must not pay my private debts out of the publike stock.</hi> Yea, no <hi>self<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>respect,</hi> no private ends of <hi>His</hi> owne or family, were in any degree regarded, but <hi>Himself</hi> and His were whol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly swallowed up in the care of the publike safety; in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>somuch that when friends have often put <hi>Him</hi> in mind of his family and Posterity, and prest him, that al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>though <hi>he</hi> regarded not <hi>himself,</hi> yet <hi>he</hi> ought to provide that it might be well with <hi>his</hi> Family; (a thing which they thought <hi>he</hi> might easily procure;) <hi>his</hi> ordinary answer was, <hi>If it went well with the publike, his family was well enough.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Secondly, such <hi>constancy and resolution,</hi> that no feare of danger, or hope of reward, could at any time so much as unsettle <hi>him.</hi> How often was <hi>his life</hi> in dan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger? vvhat a World of threats and menaces have bin sent <hi>Him</hi> from time to time? Yet I challenge the Man that ever saw <hi>Him</hi> shaken by any of them, or thereby <hi>diverted from,</hi> or <hi>retarded in His</hi> right way of advancing the publike good: nor could the offers of


<pb n="36" facs="tcp:54184:24"/>
the greatest promotions (vvhich <hi>England</hi> could afford) in any measure be a block in <hi>His</hi> way: in <hi>that He</hi> was as another <hi>Moses</hi> (th'only man whom <hi>God</hi> went about <note place="margin">
                  <hi>Exod.</hi> 32. 10. <hi>Num.</hi> 14. 12.</note> to bribe) who desired that <hi>Hee</hi> and <hi>his</hi> might never swim, if the cause of <hi>God</hi> and his people did ever sinke: <hi>His</hi> spirit was not so lovv, as to let the whole World prevaile with <hi>Him</hi> so far as to hinder <hi>his</hi> vvork, much lesse to be <hi>his</hi> Wages.</p>
            <p>Thirdly, such <hi>Vnweariablenesse,</hi> that from three of the Clock in the morning to the evening, and from e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vening to midnight, this vvas <hi>his constant</hi> employment, (except only the time of <hi>his</hi> drawing nigh to <hi>God)</hi> to be some wayor other helpfull towards the publike good; burning out <hi>his</hi> Candle to give light to others. Who knows not all this to bee true, who knevv <hi>this Mans</hi> conversation? not onely since the time of this Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liament, but for many yeers together hath <hi>He</hi> beene a great pillar to uphold our sinking frame; a Master workman, labouring to repaire our ruinous house; and under the weight of this worke hath the Lord per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitted this rare Workman to be overthrown: and that's all I meane to say of <hi>His</hi> Life.</p>
            <p>And as <hi>His</hi> life, such was His Death, enjoying all the time of <hi>his</hi> sicknes <hi>the same evennesse of spirit</hi> which he had in the time of <hi>his</hi> health, with an addition of a more <hi>cleare evidence of Gods love in Jesus Christ,</hi> and most ready <hi>subjection</hi> to Gods will, to live or dye at Gods choice; professing to my self, that it was to <hi>Him a most indifferent thing to live or dye:</hi> if Hee liv'd, Hee would doe vvhat service He could; if Hee dyed, Hee should goe to that <hi>God</hi> whom <hi>He</hi> had serv'd, and who would carry on his worke by some others: And to o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers


<pb n="37" facs="tcp:54184:24"/>
               <hi>He</hi> said, that if <hi>his Life</hi> and <hi>Death</hi> were put into a paire of ballances, <hi>He</hi> would not willingly cast in one dram to turne the ballance either way. This was <hi>his</hi> temper all the time of <hi>his</hi> sicknesse; but as <hi>He</hi> drevv nigher to <hi>his</hi> end, the swifter His motion was to God<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards; enjoying more abundant comfort in His spirit, more frequently pouring out <hi>His</hi> heart in prayer: and whereas formerly <hi>his Soliloquies</hi> and private de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>votions were only betwixt God and <hi>his</hi> own Soule, now, out of the abundance of <hi>his</hi> heart, <hi>his</hi> mouth was compel'd to speake, and that so audibly, that such of <hi>his</hi> Family or Friends, who endeavoured to bee neere <hi>Him</hi> (lest he should faint away in <hi>his</hi> weaknesse) have over-heard Him importunatly pray for the <hi>Kings Majesty, and his Posterity,</hi> for the <hi>Parliament,</hi> and the <hi>Publike Cause;</hi> for <hi>Himselfe</hi> begging nothing, but that if His worke were done, He might bee received into <hi>his Masters joy:</hi> And a little before His end, being recovered out of a swound, seeing <hi>his</hi> friends weeping about Him, <hi>he</hi> cheerfully told them, <hi>hee</hi> had look't death in the face, and knew, and therfore fear'd not the worst it could doe; assuring them, <hi>his heart was filled with more comfort and joy, which hee found and felt from God, then</hi> His <hi>tongue was able to utter;</hi> and soon after (whilsta Reverend and godly Minister was at prayer with Him) He quietly slept in the Lord.</p>
            <p>It may bee some of you expect I should confute the Calumnies and Reproaches which that generation of Men who envied his <hi>Life,</hi> doe already begin to spread and set up in <hi>Libels</hi> concerning his <hi>Death';</hi> as that hee dyed Raving, crying out against that Cause wherein he had beene so great an instrument: Charging him


<pb n="38" facs="tcp:54184:25"/>
to die of that loathsome Disease, which that accursed <hi>Balsack,</hi> in his Booke of slanders against <hi>Mr Cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vin,</hi> charged him to dye of. But I forbeare to spend time needlesly, to wipe off those reproaches, which I know none of you believe. And this will satisfie the <hi>World</hi> against such slanders; that no lesse then <hi>eight Doctors</hi> of Physick, of unsuspected integrity, and some of them <hi>Strangers</hi> to <hi>him,</hi> (if not of different Religion from him) purposely requested to be present at the opening of his Body; and well neere a thousand people, first and last, who came many of them out of curiosity, and were freely permitted to see his Corps, can, and doe abundantly testifie the falshood and foulnesse of this Report; the Disease whereof he dyed, being no other then an Imposthume in his Bowels.</p>
            <p>But now (to leave this) tell me all you that passe by the way, have we not great cause of <hi>Mourning,</hi> in the fall of <hi>such a Man!</hi> May I not say, as <hi>David</hi> to the People, <hi>Rent your Clothes, and gird you with Sackcloth, and mourne before Abner?</hi> Verily, when I consider how <note place="margin">1 Sam: 3. 31.</note>
