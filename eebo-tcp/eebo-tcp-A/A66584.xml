            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            <head>QUAKER'S FALSE INTERPRETATIONS OF SCRIPTURE.</head>
            <p>ONly of this at present, Hereafter perhaps I may Treat of their <hi>Doctrines</hi> and their <hi>Manners.</hi> All that I desire of the <hi>Reader,</hi> is, that in the several Texts I shall instance, he consult the Bible; because words separated from the Discourse, may seem, even to a wise man, to signifie what the Inspired Authors never intended, and the like expressions, and sometimes tho same, do mean different things, as in all other Books, so in holy Writ.</p>
            <p>G. K. <hi>Immed. Revelat. p.</hi> 21. <q>We may not, nor dare not make use of the Scripture, but
<pb n="2" facs="tcp:37939:3"/>
in the Life and Spirit, as that opens and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fluences. — We dare not, nor ought not to speak the Spirit's words in our own Spirit. — We tie the words of Scripture unto the Spirit, so as not to use them, but in and by the Spirit. G. K. <hi>Help in need p.</hi> 77. Away with that manner of interpreting Scripture, and search<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing truth, by drawing and knitting conse<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quences, by the fallible erring mind, and na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tural understanding. Keep close in all things, to the determination of the Spirit of God, and where that leads you to draw a conse<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quence, or frame an argument, do it, else forbear. W. Duesbury's <hi>discovery p.</hi> 48. The word of the Lord came upon me in the common Gaol in <hi>Warwick</hi> 13. of 1. Moneth 1664. which constrained to be given forth from the Spirit of the Lord, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> N. <hi>Love to Lost, p.</hi> 1. The things following are not of Man, nor did I receive them but by the Revelation of Jesus Christ. Atkinsons <hi>Stan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dard of the Lord p.</hi> 30. Written from the Spirit of the Lord. Burrough's <hi>Trumpet p.</hi> 1. The Order and Authority given unto me by the Spirit of the Living God 31. of 10. Moneth, in the Year 1655. about the <hi>4th</hi> hour in the Morning, when my Meditations were of my God upon my Bed in <hi>Kilkenny</hi> City, at that time the word of the Lord came unto me, saying, Write, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> Given under my hand,
<pb n="3" facs="tcp:37939:3"/>
and Sealed with the Spirit of the eternal God. Foster's <hi>Guide, p.</hi> 59. Do you not [<hi>Professors</hi>] confess your selves to be fal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lible?</q>
            </p>
            <p>If then I can prove, that you have In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terpreted Scripture in a false Sense, you must grant that you have not Interpreted only in and by the Spirit of God, but in your own, and by the natural understanding, and falli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble erring mind. And I hope if it appear to you that you have thus done, you will not lay the error, how little soever it may be, upon that Holy One, but take it to your selves, though it contradict your Glorious Pretence, and abate your Credit, and Shame you never so much. And in the name of Christ, I admonish you that you do so, that God be not Dishonoured, and his excellent Spirit Vilified. The tryal follows.</p>
            <p>G. K. <hi>Im. Revel.</hi> p. 72. <hi>Out of</hi> Sion <hi>shall go forth the Law,</hi> 
               <q>
                  <hi>and the word of the Lord from</hi> Jerusalem. <hi>And he</hi> (The word: for that is his name, <hi>Rev.</hi> 19.) <hi>shall judge among the Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions,</hi> [<hi>Isa.</hi> 2, 3, 4.]</q> (1) Your reason why the <hi>Word</hi> of the Lord must here signifie <hi>Christ</hi> (for that is it you mean) <hi>viz.</hi> Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause his name is, the Word, is infirm; un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>less you can prove it always so signifies, which it doth not; as you may see in many places of Scripture; particularly in this Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phet's

writings, Chap. 39. 5. <hi>Hear the word of the Lord of Hosts.</hi> That is, not Christ, but this Sentence which follows. <hi>Behold, the day is come that all that is in thine House shall be carried to Babylon.</hi> Chap. 28. 14. <hi>Hear the word of the Lord,</hi> Namely this, <hi>Thus saith the Lord, behold I lay,</hi> &amp;c. <hi>vers.</hi> 16. ( 2) As in these former words, <hi>Come and let us go up to the house of the God of</hi> Jacob, <hi>and he will teach us of his ways. He</hi> refers to <hi>God,</hi> and not to <hi>house.</hi> So it is manifest that in these latter, <hi>For out of</hi> Sion <hi>shall go forth the Law, and the word of the Lord from</hi> Jerusa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lem; <hi>and he shall judge among the Nations. He</hi> refers to <hi>Lord,</hi> and not to the <hi>Word.</hi> For ( 3) it had been all one if it had been only said, <hi>Out of</hi> Sion <hi>shall go forth the Law of the Lord; and he shall judge.</hi> The <hi>Law</hi> of the Lord, and the <hi>Word</hi> of the Lord, being here the same. And then as the Law here is not Christ, so neither is the Word. ( 4) And thus was it fulfilled concerning the Gos<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pel, as that being distinct from Christ. For it was first Preached at <hi>Jerusalem,</hi> and from thence proceeded to the Gentiles. Luk. 24. 47. Thus it is Written, <hi>that Repentance and Remission of Sins should be Preached in Christ's Name among all Nations, beginning at Jerusa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lem.</hi> Thus <hi>Tertullian</hi> understands the Text. <hi>Adv.

            <p>
               <q>
                  <hi>Ibid. p.</hi> 66. I desire the Reader to weigh what word it is <hi>David</hi> speaks so frequent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly of in <hi>Psal.</hi> 119. — It is not any word writ, any outward word or words. — But the eternal word, which created the Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vens and Earth. — The word in the be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gining which taught him the Laws, Judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> — Jesus Christ: [<hi>P.</hi> 67. 68. 65.]</q> You may as well say, Testimonies, Statutes, Judgments, Commandements, Law, are not a written and outward word or words. For they are all used promiscuous<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly; and what is spoken of the word, is spoken of these. As it is said, <hi>I beheld the Transgressors and was grieved, because they kept not thy word:</hi> So, <hi>Rivers of Waters ran down mine Eyes, because they kept not thy Law.</hi> As, <hi>I rejoyce at thy word:</hi> So, <hi>Thy Testimo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nies are the rejoicing of my Heart.</hi> As, <hi>I have hoped in thy word:</hi> So, <hi>I have hoped in thy judgments.</hi> As, <hi>Thy word is very pure; therefore thy Servant loveth it:</hi> So, <hi>Upright
<pb n="6" facs="tcp:37939:5"/>
are thy judgments: I love thy Commandments.</hi> As, <hi>For ever thy word is settled in Heaven:</hi> So, <hi>Thy testimonies thou hast founded for ever.</hi> The word then here spoken of being the same with Testimonies, Statutes, Judgments, Commandments, Law, it is as much out<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward, written and spoken as they are: and you may as well say the Testimonies, Sta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tutes, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> are Christ, as that this word is; and that they taught the word, as that the word taught them. As is evident by the reading of almost any two connext verses in the <hi>Psalm,</hi> and especially those single ones which contein both words; for that where they thus occur, there is no difference to be discerned. As vers. 16. <hi>I will delight my self in thy Statutes: I will not forget they word.</hi> vers. 160. <hi>Thy word is true from the begin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing: and every one of thy Righteous judgments endureth for ever.</hi> Vers. 172. <hi>My Tongue shall speak of thy word: for all thy Command<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments are Righteous.</hi> That what is spoken of the word of the Lord in this <hi>Psalm,</hi> can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not agree to a written and spoken word, to such Promises, Statutes, Judgments, Law; and that Christ of necessity must be under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stood; I believe you will no sooner prove, than that, Thou shalt not Kill: There is one God: Trust in the Lord: God forgiveth Sins: He will bless thee: And the like Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mandments,
<pb n="7" facs="tcp:37939:5"/>
Promises, and Doctrines were not written and spoken, and that they are Christ, and they Created Heaven and Earth. And that such is the word here, is again ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nifest enough in that <hi>David</hi> says, I will <hi>keep</hi> it, and <hi>meditate</hi> in it. My Tongue shall <hi>speak</hi> of it: <hi>For</hi> all thy <hi>Commandments</hi> are Righ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teous. One thing more I will inform you of: <hi>viz.</hi> That <hi>Word</hi> in several places of this <hi>Psalm</hi> signifies Gods <hi>Promise,</hi> and particularly to <hi>David.</hi> As vers. 65. <hi>Thou hast dealt well with thy Servant according to thy word.</hi> Vers. 170. <hi>Deliver me according to thy Word.</hi> Vers. 49. <hi>Remember thy word unto thy Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vant, upon which thou hast caused me to hope.</hi> Vers. 38. <hi>Stablish thy word unto thy Servant.</hi> Compare herewith 2 <hi>Sam.</hi> 23. 5. <hi>Although my house be not so with God, yet he hath made with me an everlasting covenant, ordered in all things and sure.</hi> And Chap. 7. 25. <hi>The word which thou hast spoken concerning thy Servant and concerning his house, establish it for ever.</hi> And that was this: Vers. 12. <hi>I will set up thy Seed after thee, and establish his Kingdom. My mercy shall not depart away from him.</hi> Now is this word, Christ? Did this Word create Heaven and Earth? This, <hi>I will set up thy Seed, &amp;c?</hi> And was it not an outward word spoken by <hi>Nathan? Ibid. p.</hi> 69. Pro. 6. 24. <q>
                  <hi>Reproofs of instruction are the way of Life:</hi>
                  <pb n="8" facs="tcp:37939:6"/>
                  <hi>to keep thee from the evil Woman.</hi> That is, the false deceitful Whorish Spirit, the Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit of this World, which bewitches the whole Earth.]</q> That it is a real Woman, I am as sure, as that any Whore in <hi>Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land</hi> is a Woman. For the discourse being continued, thus it is said: Vers. 29. <hi>He that goeth in to his Neighbour's Wife shall not be in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nocent.</hi> Vers. 32, 33, 34. <hi>Whoso committeth Adultery with a Woman, lacketh understand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing. A wound and dishonour shall he got, for Jealousy is the Rage of a Man: therefore he will not spare in the day of Vengeance.</hi> And thus <hi>Chap.</hi> 7. (where the same Woman is spoken of, as appears <hi>vers.</hi> 5.) <hi>She caught the Young man and Kissed him, and said, I have decked my Bed with Tapestry, and per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fumed it with Myrrhe, come let us take our sill of Love until the Morning, for the Good<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man is not at home,</hi> &amp;c. Now prove you if you can, that the Holy Ghost meaneth by the Whorish Woman, in this place, a Whor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ish Spirit, the Spirit of error. If I should say, Heb. 13. 4. <hi>Whoremongers and Adulterers God will Judge:</hi> that is, Idolaters: I believe my reason would be as good as yours. For yours I question not is, because St. <hi>John</hi> in the <hi>Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>velations</hi> speaks of a <hi>Whore of Babylon:</hi> and mine would be, because <hi>Ezekiel</hi> in his <hi>Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phecy</hi> speaks of committing <hi>Adultery</hi> with <hi>I<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dols,</hi>
               <pb n="9" facs="tcp:37939:6"/>
and going a <hi>Whoring</hi> after the <hi>Heathen.</hi> But then he that readeth what goeth before my Text, viz. <hi>Marriage is honourable in all, and the Bed Vndesiled:</hi> would wonder at my interpretation.

The Seed and Birth of God is not an Accident, but a substance. — It is not a particle of the God-head: but it is of the Heavenly, Spiritual, and Invisible substance and being; that is, the most Glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rious being and principle, in which God, as Father, Son, and Holy Ghost, doth dwell and tabernacle, and thine forth in the most Glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rious Brightness, Beauty, Sweetness, and Majesty, that the noblest of Creatures in the highest supernatural elevation can reach unto, behold him and have fellowship with him; which is the <hi>Holy</hi> of <hi>Holies,</hi> and the <hi>Heaven</hi> of <hi>Heavens,</hi> or that <hi>third Heaven,</hi> in which <hi>Paul</hi> on Earth saw and felt things unutterable.</q> And out of these Heavens, <hi>&amp;c.</hi>] Of your opinion, that the new birth is a substance, and of that spiritual substance in which God dwells, the Heaven of Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vens, perhaps I may speak another time. As to your interpretation of 2. <hi>Cor.</hi> 12. 2. (1) Why say you St. <hi>Paul</hi> was on Earth when he heard the unspeakable words, when he tells you that himself knew not? for his words are these: <hi>I knew a Man (whether in the Body, I cannot tell; or whether out of the Body, I cannot tell: God knoweth.) Such an one caught up to the third Heaven.</hi> Which must signifie whether this was really done, or whether it was only a vision, he knew not.
<pb n="11" facs="tcp:37939:7"/>
(2) But suppose he was really caught up in the Body (which for ought any man knows he was;) how could that be, if he remain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed still on Earth, and was not removed an inch from his place? (3) And yet how caught up <gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap>, <hi>even unto</hi> the <hi>third</hi> Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven (which signifies the greatest distance) and yet not removed? for according to your Opinion, Heaven is as near to us, as our own Souls, for where the new Birth is, there it is, that birth being (as you say) of the same spiritual substance in which God dwells, which is Heaven. (4) And then St. <hi>Paul</hi> having that Birth before, was in Heaven <hi>be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore</hi> he was caught up thither: and so is e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>very regenerate man at present. So that it is no strange or peculiar thing, which our Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viour said of himself, <hi>viz.</hi> that he was then in Heaven whilst he discoursed with <hi>Nicode<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mus, Joh.</hi> 3. 13. (5) And I would then know how he passed through <hi>two</hi> Heavens, or thought he did so: (for whether this were real, or a vision, is all one, the vision signi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fying as much as the real motion.) And if you please, I would understand also from your <hi>inspiration</hi> (not <hi>conjecture</hi>) what these <hi>two Heavens</hi> are, which he passed to come to the third. For alass! I only take the one to be that of the Clouds, and the other that of the Stars; it being of old said, <hi>The Clouds of Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven:</hi>
               <pb n="12" facs="tcp:37939:8"/>
And the <hi>Stars of Heaven.</hi> But perhaps you can inform me of two other, as well as a third, hard by us, somewhat alike comfort<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able. (6) Being curious, I would yet know how St. <hi>Paul's</hi> Body was, or might be caught up <hi>Vnto</hi> this third Heaven, a spiritual sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stance just before his Face. For methinks it should then rather have been said, his Body was caught or drawn <hi>into</hi> it. Be truly se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rious and tell me, whether Christ ascended up above the Clouds: I mean, ten or twen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty Miles distant from Earth upward. And since we read that at his Death, he said to the Thief, <hi>This day shalt thou be with me in Paradise;</hi> whether their Spirits ascended up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward, (as the Spirits of Men do:) especial<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly since this <hi>Paradise</hi> is the <hi>third Heaven,</hi> vers. 4.

<pb n="14" facs="tcp:37939:9"/>
Bread which I will give is my Flesh, which I will give for the Life of the World.</hi> From whence I suppose you would argue thus: The Flesh here spoken of, came down from Heaven: The visible flesh came not down from Heaven: Therefore the visible Flesh is not here spoken of. I deny the <hi>Major:</hi> and for this reason, because the Text says not the Flesh came down from Heaven. Which therefore you must prove by consequence thus: The Bread came down from Heaven: The Flesh is the Bread: Therefore the Flesh came down from Heaven. <hi>I Answer:</hi> The Bread in the <hi>Major</hi> signifies <hi>whole</hi> Christ. As it is said, <hi>I am the Living Bread:</hi> and vers. 48. <hi>I am the Bread of Life.</hi> And though he speak of himself as then he was, both the Word and Man, that he came down from Heaven (<hi>I came down from Heaven;</hi>) yes and said that he the <hi>Son of Man</hi> came from thence; (vers. 62. <hi>What and if you shall see the Son of Man ascend up where he was before?</hi> Chap. 3. 13. <hi>No Man hath Ascend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed up to Heaven, but he that came down from Heaven, the Son of Man which is in Heaven:</hi>) Yet <hi>as the Son of Man</hi> he came not from thence, but <hi>as the Word.</hi> But Flesh in the <hi>Minor</hi> is not the Bread as that signifies <hi>whole</hi> Christ, but only <hi>part</hi> of Christ. Now that may be affirmed of whole Christ, or of
<pb n="15" facs="tcp:37939:9"/>
his Person, which cannot be affirmed of every part of him. As your selves will grant that <hi>he</hi> came from Heaven, and yet deny that his <hi>visible</hi> Flesh, which is part of him, did. Wherefore though the Bread came down from Heaven, and the Flesh is Bread, it will not fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low from hence, that the Flesh came from Heaven; unless either all the Bread, which is Christ, came from thence, or the Flesh is all the Bread; that is to say, all Christ. Form the Syllogism (as it ought) thus, and you may the easier discern your error: All the Bread of Life came down from Heaven: The Flesh is some of the Bread of Life: Therefore the Flesh came down from Heaven. Or thus, all the Bread of Life came down from Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven: Some Flesh is the Bread of Life: There<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore some Flesh came down from Heaven. For the <hi>Major</hi> is false, which affirms all the Bread of Life to come down from Heaven. For all the Bread of Life is all Christ: and all Christ came not down from Heaven. For his visible Flesh did not; and yet his visi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble Flesh is some of the Bread of Life. I will use the like Arguments for Proof of the de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>scent of Christ's <hi>visible</hi> Flesh, and leave you to answer them, because in so doing you will answer your selves The Bread here spoken of came down from Heaven: The visible Flesh is the Bread here spoken of: There<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
<pb n="16" facs="tcp:37939:10"/>
the visible Flesh came down from Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven. The <hi>Minor</hi> I prove: That which Christ gave for the Life of the World, is the Bread here spoken of (as the Text affirms: <hi>The Bread which I will give is my Flesh, which I will give for the Life of the World:</hi>) The visi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble Flesh Christ gave for the Life of the World: Therefore the visible Flesh is the Bread here spoken of. Again, the Son of Man came down from Heaven: The Son of Man is visible Flesh: Therefore visible Flesh came down from Heaven. Again, all the Bread of Life came down from Heaven: The visible Flesh is some of the Bread of Life: Therefore the visible Flesh came down from Heaven. Perhaps an Instance may be more clear to you, and therefore say I thus: Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demption came from <hi>Jerusalem:</hi> The Mony is the Redemption: Therefore the Mony came from <hi>Jerusalem,</hi> Which yet will not necessa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rily follow, because it might be taken up (suppose) in <hi>England</hi> by him that came from <hi>Jerusalem</hi> and redeemed Slaves by that Price paid. Now to shew the contrary to your assertion. (1) Let us put into the Text the <hi>visible</hi> Flesh, and see whether it cannot be said, as it is without any incongruity. <hi>I am the Living Bread which came down from Heaven: If any Man eat this Bread he shall Live for ever: And the Bread which I will
<pb n="17" facs="tcp:37939:10"/>
give is this my Flesh which your Eyes behold which I will give for the Life of the World:</hi> or say we, <hi>And the Bread which I will give is my Life,</hi> which <hi>I will give for the Life of the World</hi> (for that <hi>that</hi> is the meaning of <hi>giving</hi> his <hi>Flesh</hi> for the Life of the World, shall be shew<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed anon.

The letter and outward teachings so much cried up, with all the Fruits and effects of the one [<hi>the Crucified Body of Christ</hi>] though a very Blessed and Comfortable enjoyment in its place and kind, yet being but that which made nothing <hi>perfect,</hi> is now no less necessary to be <hi>parted</hi> with than at that time it was; else the <hi>Comfórter</hi> as the blessed effect of the other [<hi>the Living Body of Christ</hi>] can not come.

<pb n="18" facs="tcp:37939:11"/>
is no incongruity, but it is the very same in sense with the Text, and therefore the <hi>visible</hi> Flesh of Christ is here meant. So that the whole is this: Christ who now was Man, having said that he is the Bread of Life which came down from Heaven, shews in one <hi>eminent particular</hi> wherein he is so, <hi>viz,</hi> in <hi>Dying</hi> for us: (he being likewise the Bread of Life in other respects, namely, as to his <hi>Doctrine</hi> and <hi>Spirit,</hi> and <hi>raising</hi> unto eter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal Life at the last day.) Which Death is our eternal Life, as Bread is our Temporal. (2) From these last words, <hi>I will give my Flesh for the Life of the World,</hi> I prove that the Flesh and Blood here spoken of are not a spiritual invisible substance, which you Ima<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gine Christ always dwelt in and brought from Heaven with him, but that visible which he took of the Virgin. For to <hi>give his Flesh for the Life of the World,</hi> signifies to <hi>offer up him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>self</hi> a Sacrifice for Sin by <hi>Death</hi> upon the Cross, thereby <hi>obtaining Life</hi> for the World, Pardon and Redemption. As is manifest
<pb n="19" facs="tcp:37939:11"/>
from the like expressions which frequently occur. Mat. 20. 28. <hi>The Son of Man came to give his Life a Ransom for many.</hi> Eph. 5. 2. <hi>Christ hath given himself for us an Offering and a Sacrifice to God.</hi> Heb. 9. 28. <hi>He was once offered to bear the Sins of many.</hi> Chap. 3. 14. <hi>As the Children are partakers of Flesh and Blood, he himself likewise took part of the same, that through Death he might destroy him that had the power of Death, the Devil.</hi> And it being altogether thus spoken of his <hi>visible</hi> Flesh, it is sure enough that this place speak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth of the same<note n="*" place="bottom">
                  <hi>Tertullian</hi> understands the Text of the visible Flesh <hi>: De Carne</hi> Chr.

               </note>. For, shew another Text if you can that speaketh thus of a spiritual Flesh of his. But then the importance of the Phrase being such as you have heard, you must affirm that the <hi>spiritual</hi> Flesh was <hi>offered</hi> and <hi>Died</hi> and so <hi>obtained Redemption for</hi> us. Which is altogether a stranger to the Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture. Whether you will affirm this I cannot tell. But this we all see, that you Interpret
<pb n="20" facs="tcp:37939:12"/>
the <hi>Life</hi> which is by Christ's Flesh (<hi>viz.</hi> The spiritual, which you phansie) of his <hi>quicken<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing</hi> of our Souls by his <hi>Life</hi> and <hi>Spirit</hi> which <hi>dwelleth</hi> in us. Which is quite another thing than to <hi>give it for the Life of the World,</hi> that importing <hi>Dying</hi> as a <hi>sacrifice,</hi> and <hi>atoning</hi> for Sin. (3) The Flesh and Blood here are <hi>two distinct</hi> things, <hi>vers.</hi> 53. Whereas the spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritual substance which you imagine can have but <hi>one</hi> part. And moreover the Flesh, for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>asmuch as the <hi>giving</hi> of it (as hath been prov<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed) signifies Christ's <hi>Death,</hi> must needs be that which was <hi>Broken;</hi> and the Blood, that which was <hi>shed.</hi> And accordingly the Bread and Wine, which our Lord Ordeined in re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>membrance of his same Death, are symbols of this same Flesh and Blood, and of no other. 1 Cor. 11. Mat. 26. <hi>This is my Body which is Broken for you: This is my Blood which is shed for you.</hi> But spiritual Flesh cannot be brok<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>en, nor spiritual Blood shed; (and indeed there are not these two distinct parts in a spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritual substance:) nor are the Bread and Wine in the Lord's Supper symbols of such: and therefore we must conclude that such are not here meant.</p>

For as he <hi>departed</hi> out of this <hi>World</hi> to be in the place where he is, and to <hi>receive</hi> the <hi>Glory there</hi> which he hath: (vers. 1. <hi>The hour is come: Glorifie thy Son.</hi> Vers. 5. <hi>Glorifie thou me with thine own self.</hi> Ver. 11. <hi>I am no more in the World, I come to thee.</hi> Chap. 7. 39. <hi>Jesus was not</hi> [yet] <hi>Glorified.</hi> Chap. 20. 17. <hi>I am not Yet ascended to my Father.</hi> Eph. 1. 20. <hi>God raised him from the Dead, and set him at his own right hand in the Heavenly places.</hi> 1 Tim. 3. 16. <hi>Received up into Glory.</hi> vide <hi>Joh.</hi> 6. 62.) So must we likewise depart hence, that we may be in the same place with him, and behold, as there present, his Glory. For thus it is said, 2 Cor. 5. 6. <hi>Whilst we are at home in the Body, we are absent from the Lord,</hi> Phil. 1. 23. <hi>I have a desire to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>part
<pb n="22" facs="tcp:37939:13"/>
and be with Christ,</hi> 1 Joh. 4. 2. <hi>When he shall appear, we shall be like him; for we shall see him as he is.</hi> And plain enough is it that our Saviour speaks not of our Beholding his Glory, whilst we are <hi>absent</hi> from him, but when we are in the <hi>same place</hi> with him: <hi>I will that they be with me where I am, that they may behold my Glory.</hi> And that really and personally there, by a proper local re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moval hence, as himself went thither. For thus says he, vers. 11. <hi>I am no more in the World, I come to thee.</hi> Whereas then he prays, that they that are his may be with him, it is manifest, he means that they might come to the Father as he did, be removed from Earth into Heaven, for the same says he of those that lay down their Lives for him. Which must therefore needs mean their being with him in the other World, so as to be glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rified and receive eternal Life. Chap. 12. 25. 26. <hi>He that hateth his Life in this World, shall keep it unto Life eternal. If any man serve me, let him follow me, and where I am there shall also my Servant be,</hi> So says he to the Jews, Chap. 7. 33. 34. <hi>Yet a little while I am with you, and then I go unto him that sent me. Ye shall seek me, and shall not find me: and where I am, thither ye cannot come. i. e.</hi> Ye cannot come unto God in Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven, and dwell there with him and me: or
<pb n="23" facs="tcp:37939:13"/>
ye cannot be saved. For thus says he again to them, Chap. 8. 21. <hi>Ye shall Die in your Sins: Whither I go ye cannot come.</hi> So that you may as well say, that the Saints on Earth see the Kingdom of Heaven, <hi>i. e.</hi> are entred in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to it, and are possessed of eternal Life, which yet we are told they receive in the World to come, <hi>Chap.</hi> 33. 5. 15. 16. <hi>Luk.</hi> 18. 30. as that they are where Christ is, beholding his Glory, whilst they remain likewise upon Earth. For hear further what he says, which will again shew you his mind. Chap. 14. 2. 3. <hi>In my Father's house are many Mansions. I go to prepare a place for you. I will come a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gain and receive you unto my self, that where I am, there you may be also.</hi> Which is to be taken up into Heaven really at Christ's com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to judge the World, when the Dead shall rise. According as his Apostle speaks, I Thes. 4. <hi>The Lord shall descend from Heaven: and the Dead in Christ shall rise first: then we which are alive and remain, shall be caught up toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther with them in the Clouds, to meet the Lord in the Air: and so shall we ever be with the Lord.</hi> You might also have observed a dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ference betwixt Christ's being with us in our hearts, and our being with him in Heaven. Which is as much as betwixt the Sun's being with us here below, which is by its Beams and influences, and our being with it above,
<pb n="24" facs="tcp:37939:14"/>
which cannot be without our local ascent.</p>
            <p>I again desire the <hi>Reader</hi> to remember that these Men pretend to be Prophets, and to Write by Inspiration, and not to interpret, nor so much as make use of Scripture but as the Holy Ghost leadeth; and to judge all a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>long as he readeth, whether they have so done, as knowing that that Spirit is not the Author of any falsity or folly: and to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>member withal that my present business is only concerning the <hi>Interpretations</hi> of Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture: which may be monstrously false and ridiculous, though no error in Doctrine should be asserted. As if I should say, Mat. I. I. <hi>The Book of the Generation of Jesus Christ, the Son of</hi> David: The Book is the Soul of Man, in which is written good or evil, according to which every one shall be judged. Here Jesus Christ is to be formed, in the heart: <hi>I Travel in Birth again till Christ be formed in you.</hi> And he is truely the Son of <hi>David,</hi> sits upon the Throne; whose Kingdom is here, within, comes not with observation, and hath no end. And where he is thus begotten and formed, and thus ruleth, there he is Jesus, which is by interpretation a Saviour. Who (I say) can condemn this Doctrine? But who reading what follows the words which I have thus descanted upon; viz. <hi>The Son of</hi> Abra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ham; Abraham <hi>begat</hi> Isaac: <hi>The Birth of
<pb n="25" facs="tcp:37939:14"/>
Jesus was on this wise: when as his Mother</hi> Mary <hi>was espoused to</hi> Joseph, &amp;c. Would not count me an idle Fellow, and conclude that I have grossely erred, and was in no wise assi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sted by the Holy Ghost to Interpret thus?

ye be Condemned. Behold, the Judge standeth before the Door.</hi> Which is the same as <hi>the coming of the Lord draweth nigh.</hi> And that the whole context hath shewed us to be, to Punish for Sin. So that, <hi>Lest you be Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demned,</hi> must mean, Lest you also be punish<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed with these evil doers. Which is quite a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nother thing, than to be Condemned by the Light in the Conscience. (2) And indeed, who can believe but that the Apostle deterrs them from Sin by a greater Argument than the Condemnation of the Light within them, the Condemnation of their own Hearts, the reproof of their Conscience? As if he only said, Grudge not one against another, lest you be reproved by the Light of Christ in you. Behold, the Judge standeth before the Door, and he will so reprove you. Especi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally when he speaks of the coming of the Lord against Sinners after another manner than by conviction of their Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sciences, of a most dreadful time of Venge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance, and that a peculiar time, such an one as is not always; whereas Christ's reproving by his Light within, is common to all times. Lest you should think, because it is said, <hi>Lest ye be Condemned,</hi> conviction of mind must therefore be meant, and not any external Punishment, I observe to you that external punishment is frequently meant by the same

Our Text then lieth plainly thus: Christ came into the World to Die for Sin: and whereas he is gone out of the World (<hi>vers.</hi> 24.) he shall come again into it, but not to Die, but to give that Salvation which by his Death he Purchased for us: He who was made Sin for us, shall appear the second time without being made Sin: He was once offered here, he shall appear again here, but shall not then be offered again. (2) The Apostle had said just before, that Christ <hi>entred</hi> into <hi>Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven,</hi> the true Holy of Holies, <hi>vers.</hi> 24. He speaking then of a second appearance must needs mean his <hi>Coming out of this place,</hi> and that after the same manner that he went in, <hi>viz.</hi> by local motion: he Ascended, and he
<pb n="32" facs="tcp:37939:18"/>
shall so Descend: Just as the High-Priest en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tred into the Holy of Holies of the earthly Tabernacle, and came out again: only with this difference, that whereas the High-priest entred into that Earthly Holiest, and came out of it, once every year, so often sacrificing and making atonement for Sin; Christ en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tred into Heaven and cometh out thence but once, and that in the end of the World, and not then to offer another Sacrifice and make a new atonement: (for that he did suffici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>one for all, <hi>viz.</hi> at his entrance there:) but to judge the World, and to give Salvation to them that diligently wait for him. Thus the Apostle here writes. Vers 12. <hi>By his own Blood he entred in once into the Holy Place, having obtained eternal Redemption for us.</hi> Vers. 24. &amp;c, <hi>He is entred into Heaven it self, now to appear in the presence of God for us: nor yet that he should offer himself often, as the High-priest entreth into the Holy Place every year with Blood of others. But he was once offered to bear the Sins of many, and to them that look for him he shall appear the second time without Sin unto Salvation.</hi> Chap. 10. 11. 12. 13. <hi>Every Priest standeth daily Mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>string and Offering oftentimes the same Sacri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fices, which can never take away Sins.

God: from henceforth expecting till his Ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mies be made his Foot-stool.</hi> And when his Enemies are made his Foot-stool, then shall he appear here again, and shall destroy the last Enemy, which is Death, and then shall he deliver up the Kingdom to God even the Father, 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 15. Hereby you may see how far you have erred from the Apostles mind, whilst you understand the second appear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance of Christ, which he thus speaketh of here, of his appearance in our hearts. (3) The <hi>Similitude</hi> sheweth the second appear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance of Christ here spoken of to be at the last day. <hi>As it is appointed unto Men once to Die, but after this the judgment: so Christ was once offered to bear the Sins of many, and shall appear the second time without Sin to them that look for him unto Salvation.</hi> Which is to say, as Men Die, and appear here again to be judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, but no more here until then: so Christ Died, and shall appear here again at that day, and not till then: (for Heaven must re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive him until the times of restitution of all things, <hi>Act.</hi> 3. 21. <hi>Joh.</hi> 14. 3.) but then more Gloriously, without Death, suffering, or any meanes, in the Glory of his Father, to be Glorified in his Saints, and admired of all Believers, and to give them Rest and Glory, 2 <hi>Thes.</hi> 1. 7. <hi>Col.</hi> 3. 4. (4) The appearance is <hi>unto Salvation</hi> unto them that <hi>Look</hi> for him.
<pb n="34" facs="tcp:37939:19"/>
And therefore it is his coming from Heaven at the last day. For until then do we all look for him, even the very best, in whom he is already come as to the destruction of Sin in their Hearts; and the manifestation of himself there; and then is the Salvation giv<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>en which he obtained for us by the Sacrifice of himself, and we had a right unto upon the account of our Faith, Regeneration, and O<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bedience. 2 Tim. 4. 8. <hi>I have finished my Course, I have Fought a good Fight, I have kept the Faith.

<pb n="35" facs="tcp:37939:19"/>
the Son of Man shall come in his Glory, and all the Holy Angels with him, then shall he Sit upon the Throne of his Glory. And before him shall be gathered all Nations. Then shall the King say unto them on his Right hand, Come ye Blessed of my Father, inherit the Kingdom,</hi> &amp;c. <hi>Then shall he say also unto them on his Left hand, Depart ye Cursed into Everlasting Fire,</hi> &amp;c. <hi>These shall go into Everlasting Pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nishment: but the Righteous into Life Eternal.</hi> Luk. 14. 14. <hi>Thou shalt be recompensed at the Resurrection of the Just.</hi> Act. 3. 19. <hi>Repent and be Converted, that your Sins may be blotted out, when the times of refreshing shall come from the presence of the Lord; and he shall shew Jesus Christ, which before was Preached</hi> unto you: <hi>whom Heaven must receive until the times of Restitution of all things,</hi> &amp;c.</p>
            <p>As for the other Text, Act. 1. 11. <hi>This same Jesus which is taken up from you into Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven, shall so come in like manner as you have seen him go into Heaven.</hi> He went up (say you) in a Cloud, and shall come in a Cloud, no Fleshly eye shall behold him, for that he is now a Spirit. And you call it a mystery to the Wise of this World: understanding likewise the coming of Christ here spoken of to be his invisible coming in the Heart. Whereas it is in a visible manner, in a Body, locally descending from Heaven, in the real
<pb n="36" facs="tcp:37939:20"/>
Clouds, accompanied with Angels.

For the Prophecy came not in old time by the will of Man: but Holy Men of God spake as they were moved by the Holy Ghost.</hi> [<hi>all Scripture is given by Inspiration,</hi> 2 Tim. 3. 16.] <hi>But there were false Prophets also a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mong the People, even as there shall be false
<pb n="38" facs="tcp:37939:21"/>
Teachers among you.</hi> So that the <hi>Prophetick word</hi> is that which came peculiarly to <hi>Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phets:</hi> (whether St. <hi>Peter</hi> mean that which God had revealed to themselves the Apostles and other Prophets of Christ, or that which he had revealed to the old Prophets and they had published, or whether both:) which they spake and wrot for the use of others, and as thus published; that which others, that had it not in themselves, were to take heed unto, and they that did so, did well; that which was to be Interpreted, and which every one was to have a care how he In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terpreted; an inspired Word, inspired Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, Prophecy, Prophecy of Scripture. All this the Words shew. And therefore the prophetick word is not (as you say) Christ in the Heart in his first appearance, a seed of Light there sown, but not come forth to the perfect day. For have all a prophetick word, that have Christ and the Light within? Are all such Prophets? Are they moved by the holy Ghost to give forth Prophecy, like those Holy Men that gave forth the Scriptures? Is their Light within to be interpreted by them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves and others; or is their word to be in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terpreted, like as the Scripture and prophe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tick word is?

Which is so far from being true of <hi>Heathens,</hi> that it is not true of <hi>Christians;</hi> there being many, and good Christians too, which are not the Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritual, endued with some eminent Gift, ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther this knowledg of Mysteries, or Faith to remove Mountains (or to do somewhat the like) or Tongues, or Healing: it being e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nough to make a good Christian that he hath <hi>Charity,</hi> which is the fulfilling of the Law. As speaks the Apostle in the close of this dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>course: Vers. 31. <hi>Covet earnestly the best Gifts: yet shew I you a more excellent way.</hi> And that is <hi>Charity,</hi> as we see <hi>Chap</hi> 13. And this shews
<pb n="43" facs="tcp:37939:23"/>
that he spake before (when he discoursed of the <hi>manifestation</hi> of the Spirit) of Gifts, and eminent ones too, and not of Graces or Ver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tues; and those that are also the most com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon, as you make him speak. For accord<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to you, the <hi>manifestation</hi> of the <hi>Spirit,</hi> doth signifie as to <hi>some</hi> men, Heathens name<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly and the darkest and wickedest, the <hi>least</hi> measure of light and the <hi>smallest</hi> spiritual operation and motion in the Heart, you un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derstanding that it is given to <hi>every</hi> man. And this so ill agreeing with the Apostles discourse, it was necessary that you should take away the <hi>emphasis,</hi> as you have done, saying <hi>a</hi> manifestation of the Spirit is given to every Man.

The Text is this; <hi>He that eateth and drinketh unworthily, eateth and drinketh Damnation to himself, not discerning the Lord's Body.</hi> Not dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerning it; in what I demand? In eating and drinking you must say, if you will speak ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to the Apostle. I demand further, in eating and drinking what? This Bread and Wine you must answer, which the Lord or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deined in remembrance of his Death, if you will again speak as the Apostle doth. Friend, Dost thou eat and drink this? I neither do, nor will, must thou reply according to thy opinion and practice. I tell thee then, that thou discernest not the Lord's Body according to the mind of the Apostle in this place. And it is no wonder that thou hast invented a strange interpretation hereof, so long as thou wilt have nothing to do with the Institution, <hi>Do this in remembrance of me.</hi> But since the Apostle speaks of the Lord's <hi>Supper,</hi> shew that he means here that <hi>another</hi> body is to be dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerned than that which is to be remembred as <hi>Crucified,</hi> whereof the Bread and Wine are Symbols.

<pb n="45" facs="tcp:37939:24"/>
is according to the Apostles mind to discern the Lords Body: viz. to come to the <hi>Supper</hi> of the Lord, not as to a common Feast, but with heavenly affection, and all due prepa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration of Soul, minding his Death, the death of so great an one as the Son of God, the Lord of Glory, and not of an ordinary man; and that ignominious and painful, the death of the Cross; his Love herein, and the Love of his Father, and our inestimable benefit; eternal Redemption; so as to be sutably wrought upon by all. Thus much you might have learned from the Apostle, if you had observed his words, who tells us, that as for eating and drinking (that is, after the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon manner) we have <hi>houses</hi> to do that in; but this bread is Christ's Body broken for us, and this Cup is the New Testament in his Blood; and we are to examin our selves, and to receive these in remembrance of him, shew<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing forth his Death herein. And I pray you what is here unworthy of a Christian, and un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fit for you to do? what that is meau and elementary, and not divine enough for the best?

Nay, though there be on our Tables neither of these creatures, but only Butter, and Cheese, and Eggs, Beer, and Water, and Milk?

But this is false, for St. <hi>Paul</hi> tells the <hi>Corinthians,</hi> that he had re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived this of the Lord, and accordingly de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>livered the same unto them, 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 11. 23.

of the Holy Ghost at <hi>Pentecost,</hi> yet still says the Apostle, <hi>As oft as ye eat this Bread, and drink this Cup, ye shew</hi> [or, shew ye, <gap reason="foreign">

(2) Not only in that first de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>scent of the Holy Ghost, but also in all Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vine operations in the heart by the same spirit was Christ come already when the Apostle wrot; for unless he was so come, working graciously upon the heart, the <hi>Corinthians</hi> were not to receive the Supper of the Lord, <hi>v. 27. 28. 29.</hi> Wherefore that <hi>inward</hi> coming cannot be meant by the Apostle, for as much as that which he speaks of was not <hi>as yet,</hi> as is manifest by those words, <hi>Till he come.</hi> (3) If the Apostles continued it (as you further say) for the sakes of the weak, why do not you likewise continue it for the sakes of the same? What, are there no weak ones among you? Is the Church of the <hi>Quakers</hi> better than the primitive? Or are you wiser than the Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stles, judging that unfit, which they judged fit? But, dear Souls, in good earnest, is the Lord's Supper below you; too mean and beg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>garly for your strength and spirituality? What Christian how great and perfect soever he be, if as perfect as St. <hi>Paul</hi>) doth it not become to commemorate Christ, and shew forth his
<pb n="51" facs="tcp:37939:27"/>
Death as this Solemnity requires? Which is, to declare by this outward Rite to all the world his Faith in this Crucified Person, whom the <hi>Jews</hi> by reason of his vile death despised and rejected, 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 1. 18. 23. and to profess himself his Servant, and to admire his love, and the Love of his Father, and to acknow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge that our eternal Redemption is by his Blood-shed, and for all to offer most ardent thanks, and the profoundest Praises and Ado<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rations of his heart. This reason is perpetual, and equally concerns all. And further, was there ever any Church which discontinued the Supper of our Lord? Or was there never heretofore the glorious appearance (till which time your selves say it was to be observed) until now among you <hi>Quakers?</hi> I adde, you discern not the <hi>wisdom</hi> of our Lord in this matter; in that he hath injoyned us to come, and yet forbids unless we prepare our selves. So that he provokes and even compels us to Devotion and Piety, and doth what may be, not only to excite and animate our coldness, but to continue us in our goodness, and to bring the more profane to a godly mind and life; <hi>viz.</hi> by the frequent repetitions of this grand and serious solemnity.

I trust it is out of ignorance and inconsideration you speak, not malice. For will not Antichrist deny Christ come in his Body, when he took that Flesh, that through Death he might destroy him that had
<pb n="53" facs="tcp:37939:28"/>
the power of Death, the Devil; and when through the offering of his Body we are all sanctified? when by that Blood he entred in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to the holy place, having obteined Eternal Redemption for us; and when it is that which cleanseth us from all our sins? when in this body he rose again, without which Resurrection we had yet been in our sins; and in the same ascended, without which ascension the Holy Ghost had not come? When without this Body the world had ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver had his Preaching, nor Miracles, nor Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ample, nor his Apostles, nor any of his Reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gion, for ought we know; all depending, as the History of the Gospel shews us, upon his being made the Son of Man? In Conscience can you say, that to deny all this, doth no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing advantage Antichrist's Kingdom? Or to confess it all, it being our right Faith, doth nothing hinder his Kingdom, and advantage Christs? Wherefore then hath Christ given us this Faith? Will not Antichrist deny Christ's coming in his Flesh, that he may frustrate all the benefits that proceed from thence, and spoil our whole belief on him? You may be sure he will, if he can do it by any means handsomly; either covertly, or more openly, as he sees he can prevail: and that he hath done it you shall see anon. No, but say you, He will not deny his bodily appearance at
<pb n="54" facs="tcp:37939:29"/>
               <hi>Jerusalem,</hi> being he knows it will never harm his Kingdom so to confess him come, provi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded Christ's Kingdom be not set up in the heart. If this be right, I may likewise say, Nor will the Devil deny God, being he knows to confess him will never harm his Kingdom, provided God be not worshipped. Upon this account I begin to conjecture that by and by we shall indeed have no Antichrist. For it may likewise be said, Neither will he deny Christ's coming from Heaven, his Divinity, his being the Son of God and the Christ; be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing he knows it will never harm his Kingdom so to confess him, provided Christ's Kingdom be not set up in the heart. Yet he is said to be the Liar, that denieth Jesus to be the Christ and the Son of God, 1 <hi>joh.</hi> 2. Who then at last is Antichrist? He, say you, <hi>That denies him the Son come in the revelation of himself in the heart.</hi> But say I again, Nor will Antichrist deny this, seeing to confess him so come, will never harm his Kingdom, provided yet Christ's Kingdom be not set up there. So that it is come to pass (as I fear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed it would) that at this rate we have no Antichrist, neither one nor other. And it were happy for us, if he were thus whisled out of the world. But hereby the vanity of your proviso appears. Say we then bluntly, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out any proviso at all, as St. <hi>John</hi> doth, He
<pb n="55" facs="tcp:37939:29"/>
truly is this wicked Antichrist, that either denies Christ come in his Flesh, or denies him to be the Christ, or denies him to be the Son of God. You say further, <hi>Every Spirit that confesseth jesus Christ is come in the Flesh, is of God.</hi> But the Pope and his train and the vilest Sinners have confessed Christ come in the Flesh at <hi>Jerusalem,</hi> yet are not of God. So say I, <hi>Whosoever confesseth Jesus to be the Son of God and the Christ, is of God, is Born of him, and God dwelleth in him and he in God:</hi> (you know the same St. <hi>John</hi> likewise asserts it.) But the Pope and his Train and the vilest Sinners have confessed Jesus to be the Son of God and the Christ, and yet are not of God, nor are Born of him, nor dwell in him nor he in them. Yet for all this he that confesses not Jesus to be the Christ, is Antichrist, as the same divine Author also as<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>serts: and therefore likewise so may he be, and so say I still notwithstanding your reason<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing he is, that confesses him not come in his Flesh at <hi>Jerusalem.</hi> Yes and hear you again, the Pope and his Train and the vilest Sinners have and do confess that Christ come in the Hearts of his Saints, yet are they not of God. If you mean, or shall so reply, they <hi>resist</hi> him when he comes in their own Hearts: I tell you every Wicked man doth so, and yet eve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry Wicked man is not Antichrist in St. <hi>John's</hi>
               <pb n="56" facs="tcp:37939:30"/>
Sense. And surely you know the difference betwixt <hi>resisting</hi> him, and <hi>denying</hi> him; and discern I hope what kind of persons our A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>postle speaks of, when he says in this place, <hi>Try the Spirits: because many False-Prophets are gone out into the World.</hi> Namely that he doth not mean, that every <hi>Wicked</hi> Man be Tryed, but some sorts of <hi>Prophets,</hi> that we may not be Poisoned with false Doctrine. As you may learn again from these his pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cedent words, <hi>Believe not every Spirit.</hi> They, say you again, that deny Christ come in their Flesh to destroy Sin, are Antichrists. So say I, are they that deny him come in his own Flesh to destroy the Devil. But Antichrist (say you further) doth not deny this. Well, if there be not such an one now, the times are alter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed: for I am sure there have been many such heretofore. Or if you think I am mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>staken in calling them by so ill a name, that have only denyed Christ's Flesh and Bodily appearance at <hi>Jerusalem,</hi> speak it out, and let us moreover hear what we may more truly call them.

Haer.</hi> Chap. 46. <hi>Basilides</hi> the Heretick says <hi>Christ</hi> was without the substance of Flesh, that he suffered not of the Jews, but <hi>Simon</hi> in his place, so that we are not to believe in him that was Crucified, lest we believe in <hi>Simon.</hi> Chap. 49. <hi>Valentinus</hi> the Heretick says that Christ was not in the substance of our Flesh but brought I know not what kind of <hi>Spiritual</hi> Body from Heaven, and passed through the Virgin as Water through a Pipe taking nothing thence. Chap. 51. <hi>Cerdon</hi> affirms him to have been only a Phantasm, not to have truly suffered, but as it were to have suffered, not to be Born of a Virgin, nor to be Born at all. After these comes <hi>Apelles,</hi> and he says Christ was neither in the appearance nor in the substance of a true
<pb n="59" facs="tcp:37939:31"/>
Body; but for asmuch as he descended from the superior Places, in his descent he wove for himself a Flesh of the substance of the Stars and Air; and in his ascent restor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed to each Element what he had borrowed; and the parts of his Body being thus dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>persed, only his Spirit went to Heaven.</q> [See the same Author <hi>De Carne Christi: per totum.</hi>] Thus you have seen Antichrist hath denied Christ to have come in his Flesh: And I hope therefore you will correct your assertion, that he doth not denie this nor will: left you should be thought to judge this mon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>strous error not foul enough to be called An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tichristianism. And thus your foundation, <hi>viz.</hi> Antichrist confesses Christ to be come in his Flesh and Bodily appearance at <hi>Jerusa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lem,</hi> being thrown down; that which you have built upon it, falls with it, <hi>viz.</hi> That therefore Antichrist, denying Christ to be come in Flesh, must be understood of his coming in the Flesh of his Servants, his revealing himself in the Heart. I add, as for Christ's coming in Flesh, as this signifies his own Flesh, his incarnation, or his mean condition, we every where read of it in Scripture. As, <hi>The Word was made Flesh. God sent his Son in the likeness of Sinful Flesh. God sent forth his Son made of a Woman, made under the Law. He was made like unto us in all things. He
<pb n="60" facs="tcp:37939:32"/>
took upon him the form of a Servant, and was made in the likeness of Men.</hi> But in what places of Scripture his coming in Flesh signi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fies his appearance in our Hearts, I require you to shew; and withal, what Hereticks have denied this coming, as I have shewed many that have denied the former.</p>
            <p>But there is another rendring of St. <hi>John's</hi> words, which perhaps may give you a bet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter understanding both of the <hi>confessing</hi> of Christ, and also of his <hi>coming</hi> in Flesh: viz. <hi>every Spirit</hi> (1 Joh. 4. 2, 3.) <hi>which confesseth Jesus Christ, who came in Flesh</hi> [<gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap>] <hi>is of God. Every Spirit which con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fesseth not Jesus Christ, who came in Flesh, is not of God.</hi> And then the Sense is plainly this: He is the true Prophet, which confes<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ses Christ, though he was in the mean condi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of a Man, made Man, and made a Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vant. And he is the false Prophet which denies him, and doth so upon this account. Which confession is the acknowledgment of his Person, <hi>viz.</hi> That he is the Christ and the Son of God; and the acknowledgment of his whole Doctrine. And which denial is likewise the denial of both. According to this Sense we read throughout the Epistle. Verf. 14. 15. <hi>We have seen and do Testifie, that the Father sent the Son to be the Saviour of the World. Whosoever shall confess that
<pb n="61" facs="tcp:37939:32"/>
Jesus is the Son of God, God dwelleth in him and he in God.</hi> Chap. 2. 18. 22. 23. 26. <hi>Even now are there many Antichrist's. Who is a Liar, but he that denieth that Jesus is the Christ? He is Antichrist that denieth the Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther and the Son. Whosoever denieth the Son, the same hath not the Father. These things have I written to you concerning them that Seduce you.</hi> Chap, 5. 1. <hi>Whosoever believ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth that Jesus is the Christ, is Born of God.</hi> Verf. 5. <hi>Who is he that overcometh the world, but he that believeth that Jesus is the Son of God?</hi> Verf. 20. <hi>We know that the Son of God is come.</hi> Thus also in his 2 <hi>Epist.</hi> Verf. 7. <hi>Many deceivers are entred into the World, who confess not Jesus Christ coming</hi> [or who did come, <gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap>] <hi>in Flesh.</hi> Verf. 9. <hi>Whosoe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver abideth not in the Doctrine of Christ, hath not God. If any bring not this Doctrine, re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive him not into your House.</hi> In his <hi>Gospel</hi> we have the same. Chap. 20. 31. <hi>These signs are written, that ye may believe that Je<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sus is the Christ.</hi> This was the principal thing to be Preached and Believed, <hi>Act.</hi> 9. 20. 22. and 2. 36. <hi>Rom.</hi> 10. 9. And hereby True and False Prophets were known. 1 Cor. 12. 3. <hi>No man speaking by the Spirit of God, calleth Jesus accursed</hi> [anathema, vile, Mar. 9. 39. <hi>and no man can say that Jesus is the Lord, but by the Holy Ghost.</hi> This is the
<pb n="62" facs="tcp:37939:33"/>
same with our Text. The importance then of the whole is this: The true Prophets con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fess that Christ the Son of God is come, and that Jesus who came in Flesh, is he. The false Prophets deny both, So that accord<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to this rendring of the words (which is so much strengthened by what is so oft repeat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed in this <hi>Epistle,</hi> and is a chief design of it) your <hi>mystical</hi> interpretation can not likewise stand, Christ's coming in Flesh here also plainly signifying his bodily appearance in the World in the condition of a Man, and not his spiritual appearance in the Hearts of his Servants as he is a Spirit and the Word.</p>
            <p>G. K. <hi>Woman Preacher. p.</hi> 6. <q>Outwardly Christ told her only concerning her Hus<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bands that were Dead, and how the man she had was not her Husband, (<hi>Joh.</hi> 4. 28. 29. 30.) And certainly in so short a time they had together (perhaps but an Hour) words could not tell her half, nor the hun dredth part of all that ever she did. Christ therefore in her Heart told her all these things, as he well could even in a moment bring all things before her and tell her all things in her Life.]</q> And many an honest man says as she did, who never means as you do, who understand this Woman's words in the strictest Sense, that Christ told her
<pb n="63" facs="tcp:37939:33"/>
not only half, but even all that she ever did in her whole Life, not an ace abated; and that not only belonging to her Sins, but all, of what nature so ever. Such universals not only in our common speech, but in the sacred writings have their limitation. Joh. 3. 32. <hi>No man receiveth his Testimony.</hi> Yet Vers. 33. <hi>He that hath received his Testimony,</hi> &amp;c. And Chap. 1. 11. <hi>As many as received him, to them gave he power,</hi> &amp;c. Mat. 23. 3. <hi>All whatsoever the Scribes and Pharisees bid you observe, observe and do.</hi> Yet vers. 16. They were <hi>Blind Guides;</hi> and said, to Swear by the Temple was <hi>nothing:</hi> and taught men to <hi>break</hi> the <hi>Commandment</hi> of God, and <hi>taught for Doctrine the Commandments of men</hi> Chap. 15. Again, Chap. 10. 22. <hi>Ye shall be hated of all men.</hi> Yet vers. 40. <hi>He that receiveth you.</hi> Again, Chap. 3. 5. 6. <hi>All</hi> Jerusalem <hi>and</hi> Judea <hi>went out and were Baptised of</hi> John. Yet Luk. 7. 30. <hi>The Pha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>risees were not Baptised of him.</hi> See Luk. 2. 1. 3. <hi>Act.</hi> 24. 5. and 2. 47. <hi>Eph.</hi> 5. 24. <hi>Ph.</hi> 2. 21. But indeed told he her inwardly of e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>very word she had spoken, and of every thought she had conceived, every step she had taken, every scrat she had given her Head, every bit of Bread she had eaten, eve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry sigh, prayer, bargain, cough, breath, spit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting, that she was concerned in from her
<pb n="64" facs="tcp:37939:34"/>
youth to that present time? Did he bring all these before her? To what purpose should it be? I can sooner believe that a Saint, or Angel especially, in Heaven, can hear all the <hi>Papists</hi> that call upon him at once through<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out the world. And from hence let them fetch a proof for their Doctrine and Practice in that particular for ever after, which I be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve they never dreamed on before; and do you <hi>Quakers</hi> answer them. I believe (choose you whether you will or not) that if after this discourse one had asked this Wo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man of an hundred things which she had done, yes of an hundred sins which she had committed in thought, word, and deed, she would have been found as ignorant of them as you are, and that not only (as you may say) because they presently after their appear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance vanished away again, but because they never appeared at all.</p>

Some going about to represent it as a ridi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culous <hi>Exposition</hi> to expound the Woman the <hi>Flesh,</hi> I give them this advice, Let them hear <hi>Bernard.</hi> — If I should so far conde<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>scend to them, as to take the words of <hi>Paul</hi> for Women in the <hi>common sense</hi> of speech, what would they gain by it? <hi>For<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ster's Guid. Pref.</hi> Thou hast lost thy state of happiness by hearkening to the Woman, thy fallen reason, who is not to speak in the Church.]</q> For my part I was in some doubt whether you did thus <hi>expound</hi> the Text when I read the charge in your Adversaries Books, conceiting you might only make an <hi>Allegory</hi> or allusion. But now I see it is granted to be your downright <hi>exposition,</hi> and to take Wo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man literally is a <hi>condescension</hi> to us. But we need not your favour, for from the Apostles words, we shall extort it from you. Which are these v. 8. &amp;c. <hi>I will that men pray every where, lifting up holy hands without wrath and doubting. In like manner also that Women a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dorn themselves in modest Apparel, with shame<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>facedness and sobriety: not with broidered hair, or Gold, or Pearls, or costly aray; but as be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cometh Women professing godliness, with good works. Let the Woman learn in silence with all subjection. But I suffer not a Woman to teach, nor to usurp authority over the Man, but to be in silence.  For</hi> Adam <hi>was first formed, then</hi>
               <pb n="66" facs="tcp:37939:35"/>
Eve. For (1) as men here are <hi>real</hi> men, and what is spoken of them ought to be taken in the <hi>literal</hi> sense: so are Women here <hi>real</hi> Women, and what is spoken of them ought <hi>so</hi> likewise to be taken, there being not the least expressed that signifies the contrary. Women adorning themselves with Apparel, Women professing Godliness, signifies as much literally, as Men Praying, Men lifting up hands without wrath doth. And therefore so doth the Womans learning in silence, the Wo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mans not Teaching, not Usurping Authority over the Man; the plural Number being on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly changed into the singular, which singular also hath a plural signification, as is usual, and as you find again v. 15. and as is evident from the parallel place where the plural is expressed: 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 14. 34. <hi>Let your Women keep silence in the Churches; for it is not permitted unto them to speak; but they are commanded to be under obedience, as also saith the Law; and if they will learn any thing, let them ask their Husbands at home; for it is a shame for Wo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men to speak in the Church.</hi> Where observe (lest you should still resist) the Women are such as have <hi>Husbands,</hi> and those at <hi>home,</hi> and that as <hi>distinct</hi> from the <hi>Church, viz.</hi> in their several houses; and unto real Women in the literal sense did the <hi>Law</hi> speak, com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manding them to be under obedience, even
<pb n="67" facs="tcp:37939:35"/>
as of real Women in the literal sense, it spake in the same place of their bringing forth chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren in Sorrow, <hi>Gen.</hi> 3. 16. Such therefore, and in the literal sense are here to be under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stood: and therefore such in the same sense in our present Text, it being altogether the same with this. (2) <hi>Men</hi> and <hi>Women</hi> are here <hi>distinguished;</hi> the different <hi>Sexes, Male</hi> and <hi>Female,</hi> are spoken of; such as <hi>Adam</hi> and <hi>Eve</hi> were. For the Apostle shews distinctly what the one should do, and what the other. Whereas according to your sense no such di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stinction ought to be understood, for that <hi>flesh</hi> or <hi>fallen reason</hi> belongs to the <hi>Male</hi> as well as <hi>Female.</hi> So that if that be (as you say it is) the meaning of <hi>Woman,</hi> then the <hi>Male</hi> as well as <hi>Female</hi> is prohibited to teach and usurp authority. And so one of you speaks. <hi>Parker's Testimony, p.</hi> 30. Christ is one in the Female as well as Male, and where he Rules, he may and ought to speak: and this is according to Scripture, <hi>But let the Woman be silent.</hi> According to this Author, the Man as well as the Woman is <hi>flesh</hi> and <hi>fallen reason;</hi> for that it may be likewise said, <hi>Let the Man be silent, let Christ only speak.</hi> Thus the Woman is become the Man, which is contrary to the Apostles discourse, which makes an absolute difference. (3) You make the Apostle say thus: I suffer not the <hi>flesh</hi>
               <pb n="68" facs="tcp:37939:36"/>
and <hi>fallen reason to teach and usurp Authority over the man; for</hi> Adam <hi>was first formed, then</hi> Eve. Which is incongruous, and therefore not the Apostles mind. Thus having shew<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed the true sense to be the <hi>literal,</hi> I tell you now (as you ask) what we shall gain by it: <hi>viz.</hi> That you have false interpreted; and a greater thing than that, your suffering Wo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men to Teach is contrary to the Apostles Doctrine, who says, I suffer them not. But you will reply, not so however. For thus says <hi>G. K. Ibid. p.</hi> 21. <q>What sort of Women is it that <hi>Paul</hi> doth not permit to speak in the Church, 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 14. 1 <hi>Tim.</hi> 2? Let us look into the Context of both places, and that will clear it. For they are (1) Unlearned. (2) Tatling. (3) Unruly, proud Women. All which is implied in these words, <hi>Let the Woman learn in Silence with all Subjection.</hi> (4) Vain, given to gaudy Apparel. (5) Such as Usurped Authority over the Man, (6) Such as were in the Transgression, as the first Woman was. (7) Such as Transgress the Law, and are not come to be under Grace. So a seven-fold sort of Women are not permitted by <hi>Paul</hi> to speak in the Church.]</q> Well, then the <hi>literal</hi> sense is <hi>granted,</hi> and we need not your <hi>condescention</hi> in admitting it. For unlearned, tatling, unruly Women are real Women, and their speaking
<pb n="69" facs="tcp:37939:36"/>
is real speaking. And then I require you to shew, and not barely to say it, that St. <hi>Paul</hi> means by Women, the <hi>flesh</hi> and <hi>fallen reason;</hi> not that you may so use his words, but that this is his mind; for to <hi>expound</hi> (as you do here) is to give the <hi>sense intended</hi> If yet not<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>withstanding your words, you do not grant the literal sense, then you have done vainly in giving us divers sorts of real Women, and your whole discourse following in your <hi>Book</hi> which proceeds of these, is idle. But I must take it for granted that real Women are meant: and now my task must be to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sider, whether the Apostle so speaks as that we may, see he doth not forbid all sorts of Women to speak in the Church. The Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>text of both places (which you say will clear that he doth not) shall be represented, 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 14. 34, 35. <hi>But let your Women keep silence in the Churches; for it is not permitted to them to speak; but they are commanded to be under obedience, as also saith the Law. And if they will learn any thing, let them ask their Hus<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bands at home: for it is a shame for Women to speak in the Church.</hi> This is all he speaks in this place. And where is the <hi>distinction</hi> he makes, telling us these may, these may not speak in the Church? or what is that which intimates so much? But observe, <hi>your women:</hi> means not this all sorts? And, <hi>They are com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manded
<pb n="70" facs="tcp:37939:37"/>
to be under obedience, as also saith the Law.</hi> Are not good as well as bad to be under obedience? And said not the Law so to all, <hi>Gen.</hi> 3. 16? Again, <hi>It is a shame for them to speak in the Church.</hi> Why so, but because this is to Usurp Authority? Which to do is a shame to the best as well as worst. And know you, that the Apostle discourses throughout the Chapter of such persons as had gifts of the Holy Ghost, and upon that account are called <hi>spiritual, v.</hi> 1. 12, 15, 16, 37. See <hi>c.</hi> 3. 1. &amp; 12. 1. <hi>Gal.</hi> 6. 1. So that these Women as well as others must keep silence in the Church. The other place, 1 <hi>Tim.</hi> 2. runs thus, <hi>v.</hi> 9. &amp; <hi>c. I will that women adorn themselves in modest apparel, with shamefaced<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness and sobriety, not with braidered hair, but (as becometh women professing godliness) with good works. Let the woman learn in silence with all subjection.</hi> Is this to say, Women that a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dorn not themselves in modest apparel with shamefacedness, nor good works, must learn in silence? Or is it not to say, Women must adorn themselves so, and they must learn in silence? If this be not the sense, I despair of ever understanding plain words. And then, as all Women must so adorn themselves, so must all learn in silence, even they that are so adorned, as the Text plainly shews. For, say if you dare, such are not to learn in si<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lence
<pb n="71" facs="tcp:37939:37"/>
with subjection. It follows: <hi>But I suf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fer not a woman to teach, nor to Usurp Autho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity over the Man, but to be in silence.</hi> Not a Woman: this is as universal as can be spo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken, and cannot signify a vain, foolish, proud Woman only. For then it would follow, such as are not so, may Usurp Authority o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver the Men. And then the better Women are, the worse will Mens condition be, if to be usurped over signify ill to them, as I think all men will grant, though perhaps some Women will not. And note, this Woman<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teaching is either the same, or else such ano ther thing, as usurping authority over the Man, which to all right minds signifies bad enough. It follows: <hi>For</hi> Adam <hi>was first for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med, then</hi> Eve. Speaks this to idle Women only? It speaks to all the Sex, telling them that Man was designed of God to be the Su<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perior, in that he was first created, and the Woman after him, and out of him, and for his use. Such another universal reason fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lows: <hi>And</hi> Adam <hi>was not deceived, but the woman being deceived was in the Transgression.</hi> How good and wise soever Women are, the consideration that all sin and misery first came upon us by their Sex, should keep them in subjection. Now when the Apostle says, <hi>I suffer not a woman to Teach, nor to Usurp Authority over the Man;</hi> whether his mind
<pb n="72" facs="tcp:37939:38"/>
be (as you say it is) that such Women may not Teach as usurp Authority: or whether it be not, as his very words are, Women, none of them, may Teach, nor usurp Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thority, I leave to the <hi>Reader</hi> to judge. And so when he subjoins, <hi>For</hi> Adam <hi>was not de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived, but the woman being deceived was in the Transgression:</hi> whether it be not a rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son, why no Woman whatever should Teach or usurp Authority over the Man: or whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther (as you say) his meaning is, that such as are in the Transgression as <hi>Eve</hi> was must not Teach, or usurp Authority over the Man; let the Reader also judge. Thus I have shewed both that real Women in the lite<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral sense are meant, and all sorts of them.</p>
            <p>
               <q>But yet you say <hi>p. 22.</hi> What if <hi>Paul</hi> had said concerning all Women at <hi>Corinth</hi> and <hi>Ephesus,</hi> that he did not permit <hi>them</hi> to spake? will it therefore follow that <hi>Women</hi> are not to spake in any case in the Church. They might at that time, being but young, not have the requisite qualifications.]</q> (1) He forbids not any sort of speaking, but Teaching, and any such speaking which signi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fies usurping Authority over the Man, and is contrary to the Womans subjection, as his words sufficiently express. (2) Since the Church of <hi>Corinth</hi> was enriched in all spiritu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>al gifts (1 <hi>Cor,</hi> 1. 5. 7. <hi>Chap.</hi> 12. <hi>Chap.</hi> 14.
<pb n="73" facs="tcp:37939:38"/>
it is not probable that none of the Women were partakers of the same, and sufficiently qualified, as the Men were. (3) There is not the least intimation of any such thing as their imperfect qualifications, and that this was the reason of the Apostles prohibition; but his Arguments (as hath been shewed) are all of an universal nature, and his prohi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bition absolute. To conclude: As you say, Hear <hi>Bernard;</hi> so say I hear <hi>Tertullian.</hi> Do <hi>Veland. Virg.</hi> Chap. 9. <hi>Non permittitur Mu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>licri,</hi> &amp;c. It is not permitted a Woman to Speak in the Church, nor to Teach, nor to Baptise, nor to Offer, nor to do any of the Mans Office, much less to exercise the Priest<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly function. And how can that be lawful to a Virgin, which is not lawful to any Woman? <hi>Advers. Har.</hi> Chap, 41. The Heretical Wo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men are so malepert, that they dare to Teach, to Contend, to Exorcise, to undertake cures, and perhaps to Baptise.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Women-Preach.</hi> p. 15. <q>They have scrap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed out of many old Authors. They have stolen the words of God concerning the ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>periences of the Saints, as the False Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phets of old, of whom the Lord said, Jer. 23. 30, 31, 32. <hi>Behold I am against the False Prophets which steal my Words. — They shall not Profit my People at all.</hi> And is not this fulfilled abundantly? where is the Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fiting
<pb n="74" facs="tcp:37939:39"/>
of the People? do they not remain still in their Sins?] These Prophets spake <hi>Peace</hi> to the People when all manner of <hi>im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pieties</hi> were committed, and told them that evil should not come upon them, as other Prophets had denounced.</q> And this they spake not as their own <hi>private</hi> judgment, but pretended to have received it from the Lord immediatly by <hi>Dreams</hi> and <hi>Visions:</hi> and so incouraged them the more in their Wicked<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness. Vers. 17. <hi>They say still unto them that despise me, the Lord hath said, ye shall have peace, no evil shall come upon you.</hi> Vers. 25. <hi>They Prophesie Lies in my Name, saying, I have Dreamed.</hi> So in our Text, <hi>I am against them that Prophesie false Dreams, and cause my Peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple to err by their Lies, yet I sent them not.</hi> So also <hi>Chap.</hi> 6. 14. and 8. 11. and 28. 8, 9. Now is this to speak the experience of the Saints, true and sound Doctrine, the very word of God? And is God against us for so doing, as he was against these false Prophets, who both feigned a vision, and also corrupted the truth, speaking peace to the wicked? Is he angry when we like honest men, having no vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sion, pretend none, but as faithfully warn men of their Sins as if we had, saying to the Rebel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lious they shall Die, &amp; endeavour to turn eve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry one from his evil ways, &amp; preach the Truth as we have learned from his written Oracles?
<pb n="75" facs="tcp:37939:39"/>
If we should receive the word immediatly from his Mouth, it would be but the very same. Conscience, where art thou? blush for this accusation, and for the abuse of sacred Scripture. If we were Knaves, we might pretend Inspiration as well as others. It is an Argument of our Honesty and sear of God, that we do not, when we might gain admira<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion and a croud of Disciples as well as o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers, if we did. But see we whether you have not likewise erred as to the other words, <hi>They shall not profit this People at all.</hi> Which you understand thus, they shall not edifie their Souls in Righteousness. I thus, De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>struction shall fall upon this people, though these Prophets say it shall not, but Prophe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sie peace to them: Their word which is con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerning good, shall not come to pass. Vers. 19. <hi>Behold a Whirlwind is gone forth: it shall fall upon the head of the Wicked.</hi> Chap. 14. 13. 15. 16. <hi>They Prophecy a false Vision, and a thing of naught.

                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap> is used. As Chap. 7. 8. <hi>Ye trust in words which cannot profit.</hi> The meaning you have vers.

But because you say no Preachers can profit the People unless they receive their word im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mediatly from God, let me add, as you have no proof in this place, so I challenge you to produce any other Text for this assertion: and admonish you that you make not the effi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cacy of the word to depend altogether upon the Persons that Minister. For <hi>Paul</hi> Plants, and <hi>Apollo</hi> Waters, but God giveth the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crease. It is a rational word, and carries conviction in its divine nature: and what makes it more prevalent, it bears the autho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity of God, and is accompanied with the o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peration of his Spirit. <hi>Moses</hi> and the Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phets were Dead when our Saviour spake those words, <hi>If they hear not them, neither will they be perswaded though one rose from the Dead.</hi> So that he thought the hearing of their writings read in the Synagogues, or the peoples reading of them themselves, or their knowledge of them, was sufficient for their repentance; and if this prevailed not, neither would <hi>Moses</hi> and the Prophets them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves, if they should come again. For alass what prevailed they, when they did Preach, upon obdurat and profligat Sinners? And the persons which commonly Ministred among

the Jews, you know were not Prophets nor Inspired, received not their word immediatly from the Lord, but read the Book of <hi>Moses</hi> and the Prophets to the People. Which also our Saviour did. And St. <hi>Paul</hi> charged that his Epistle should be read unto the brethren in the Church. <hi>Luk.</hi> 4. 26. <hi>Act.</hi> 15. 21. <hi>Col.</hi> 4. 16. 1 <hi>Thes.</hi> 5. 27. 1 <hi>Tim.</hi> 4. 13. <hi>Farns<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>worth's Priest's ignorance.</hi> p. 2. <q>The Teach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers of the World have the chief places in the Assemblies, are called of men Masters, stand praying in the Synagogues.

(1) It is not <hi>Praying</hi> in those places, because they were made by <hi>Men</hi> (as you Interpret) that is condemned.

(2) Nor is <hi>stand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing</hi> in Prayer here forbidden. For that was done both by the best Jews, and by Christi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans also, without fault: 1 <hi>Kings</hi> 8. 14. 54, 55. <hi>Neh.</hi> 9. 4, 5. <hi>Mar.</hi> 11. 25. <hi>Luk.</hi> 18. 13. And <hi>standing</hi> refers to <hi>Corners</hi> of Streets as well as to Synagogues: <gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap>. But if they had <hi>Kneeled</hi> in the Cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ners of Streets, yet would they have been e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>qually condemned: and so likewise would they, if they had Kneeled in the Synagogues. It would be all one, if it had been thus said, standing being not expressed, they love to Pray in the Synagogues, and in the Corners of the Streets, that they may be seen of Men. (3) Nor is Praying in <hi>High-places</hi> in the Synagogues, as our Ministers do in Pulpits, forbidden, as you Interpret again. For the word <gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap> doth not so signifie of it self, nor is their any thing in the Text which imports so much, but rather the contrary. For whereas they stood also in Corners of Streets, it is altogether improbable that they had High-places built there for this purpose, or that they climbed up upon the Walls of the Houses. And if this were the thing reproved,
<pb n="79" facs="tcp:37939:41"/>
then if they had Prayed in a <hi>Low</hi> place, they would have escaped the accusation; which in nowise is to be believed. Nor do I think you will acquit our Ministers when they pray in their Seat below. True, the Phari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sees had High-places in the Synagogues. But those do not necessarily signifie high from the Ground, but high in <hi>esteem;</hi> the Wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thiest, not the Tallest. For such they had also at Feasts, which surely were not as high above the common Table, as a Pulpit is from the Ground: and others that sat lower than they, yet sat as high in the Air; and indeed all of them sat, if not lay down, upon the very Ground, or Floor, or not two yards a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bove it. For the words of the Text are these, <hi>They love</hi> 
               <gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap>, <hi>the first places at Feasts, and the first seats in the Syna<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gogues.</hi> So again <hi>Mar.</hi> 12. 1. 39. <hi>Luk.</hi> 11. 43. and <hi>Chap.</hi> 20. 46. from whence I question not but your mistake arose, because our Translation says, they love the <hi>highest</hi> seats in the Synagogues: which is the same word, <gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap>, and signifies no otherwise high, than high signifies Chief or upermost, as our Translation renders it in the other places, and the like word <gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap> here. But you should have observed that our Text, <hi>Mat.</hi> 6. doth not mention the <hi>Pharisees,</hi> but
<pb n="80" facs="tcp:37939:42"/>
speaks of <hi>Hypocrites</hi> in <hi>general.</hi> And cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainly such there were besides that sect, and moreover all of that sect that were such, were not <hi>Doctors</hi> and <hi>Rulers:</hi> and therefore all that Prayed Hypocritically in the Syna<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gogues had not high places in your Sense. And further, I cannot think you condemn of hypocrisie all that Pray in our <hi>Galleries.</hi> And yet you may do it with as much reason as condemn our Ministers of hypocrisie for Pray<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing in <hi>Pulpits,</hi> both being equally high pla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces. And now that you may understand the Text better, note that it is <hi>hypocritical</hi> Praying that is there condemned. As is plain enough from the words themselves: <hi>When thou prayest, thou shalt not be as the Hypocrites: for they love to pray standing in the Synagogues, and in the Corners of the Streets, that they may be seen of Men.</hi> And sure enough their pray<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing in the Synagogues was such as their pray<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing in Corners of Streets, with which it is joined, a sure indication of hypocrisy. Which all praying, or standing praying is not. And particularly it was this: Going to the Syna<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gogues commonly to make their <hi>privat</hi> Pray<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers. As the opposition sheweth, <hi>But when thou Prayest, enter into thy Closet, and when thou hast shut thy door, Pray,</hi> &amp;c. And thus to do must argue hypocrisie. For to what end should they go to a <hi>publick.</hi> place to
<pb n="81" facs="tcp:37939:42"/>
make their <hi>privat</hi> Prayers, unless it were to be seen of Men? But be sure our Saviour knew that they did it for this end, and it was not Religion and Devotion that acted them, and therefore condemned them. And the very same would it have been, if they had gone to these Synagogues to <hi>read</hi> in their Bibles, which might as well be done at home as to any edification, if that were the thing they fought. And yet the Law was read in the Synagogues every Sabbath day without fault. The same would it be, if you should go commonly to your <hi>Meeting-houses</hi> to Pray, when you have no publick Service there: or if you should Pray even in your Closet, your door being left open or but half shut, that others may look in and see you. And yet in both these places you pray, and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demn not yourselves. So that you see our publick Service in our Churches is quite ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther thing than the praying of the hypocriti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tical Jews in the Synagogues. And I put it to your consciences, whether you believe our Ministers ascend the Pulpits for <hi>oftenta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion</hi> (I do not say, to be <hi>seen</hi> of Men: left you should quibble:) or whether they a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>scend them for this end any more than yours that stand upon a Stool, or raised Planks Whether again our people sit in <hi>Galleries</hi> out of hypocrisie. Whether again they come to
<pb n="82" facs="tcp:37939:43"/>
our Churches to be seen of men, any more than yours come to your Meeting-houses up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on the same account. And if your Conscience will suffer you to affirm it, I then require you to shew some sign of hypocrisie in our doing.</p>
            <p>Your other accusation (from <hi>Mat.</hi> 23. 6. &amp;c.) `is, that the Teachers of the world have `the Chief-places of the Assemblies, and are ` called of men Master.] (1) You have left out the principal Verb, for the Text says, <hi>They love Chief-places, and to be called Master.</hi> Which omission signifies no good mind, since in all the places of the Gospels where this matter is mentioned, it is so expressed. As besides the present Text, in <hi>Mar.</hi> 12. 38. <hi>Luk.</hi> 11. 43. &amp; 20. 46. And know you that Christ no otherwise condemns here <hi>Chief<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>places,</hi> than he doth <hi>borders</hi> of Garments and <hi>salutations:</hi> it being likewise said of him here, <hi>They enlarge the borders of their garments, and love greetings in the Markets.</hi> Which greet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings himself and his servants approved and used, <hi>Mat.</hi> 5. 47. &amp; 10. 12. <hi>Luk.</hi> 10. 4. 5. <hi>Joh.</hi> 20. 26. 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 16. 20. And which bor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders were used at this time by virtue of the Law, <hi>Numb.</hi> 15. 38. The thing condemned is plainly expressed, <hi>viz.</hi> The <hi>Love</hi> of Chief<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>places: the <hi>chosing</hi> of them out of <hi>pride.</hi> As we again learn from our Saviour, <hi>Luk.</hi> 14. 7. <hi>He put forth a parable to them that were bid<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>den,
<pb n="83" facs="tcp:37939:43"/>
when he marked how they chose out the chief rooms, saying, &amp;c.</hi> Now can you say our Ministers choose the Pulpit, when they are appointed there to officiate? Or do they thrust forward before others for the place, when no one offers to take it from them? Or do they covet the Chief-places at Feasts, or strive with any about them? (2) Nor is the Title <hi>Rabbi</hi> simply forbidden. Which being interpreted, is <gap reason="foreign">

               </gap> or <gap reason="foreign">

               </gap>, a guide, governour, ruler, or teacher, or doctor; a Master in that sense: As you find <hi>v.</hi> 8. 10. <hi>Joh.</hi> 1. 38. &amp; 31. &amp; 20. 16. For God himself hath taught us to call his Ministers so, <hi>Eph.</hi> 4. 11. 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 12. 28. <hi>Heb.</hi> 13. 7. 17. 1 <hi>Thes.</hi> 5. 12.

                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap>, Master, Sir, which in civil respect is given to all sorts of people, but it is that which is peculiar to <hi>literate</hi> persons, Scribes and Teachers of Religion. As every one a little skilled in the Language and Customs of the <hi>Jews</hi> knows; and you may learn from the title <hi>Father</hi> in this place, it being of the same importance, <hi>vers.</hi> 9. <hi>Call no Man your Father upon Earth.</hi> For it is as absurd to call a Laic or Secular person, suppose a Gentleman, or Farmer, or Tradesman, <hi>Rabbi,</hi> as it is to call him <hi>Father.</hi> And to call such an one <hi>Master</hi> in the sense here intended, and according to the signifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cation of the word, is to call him Father,
<pb n="84" facs="tcp:37939:44"/>
Rabbi, Doctor, Teacher, or Guide; which is absurd enough: and just so absurd is your in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terpretation. But that which is forbidden here is, (1) That the Teachers be not <hi>ambi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tious,</hi> affecting great <hi>Titles;</hi> nor usurp autho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity over the people, <hi>ruling</hi> as Lords their <hi>persons</hi> and their <hi>faith,</hi> setting themselves in the place of Christ, as if the Doctrine were their own, and they were the Masters to be obeyed, and the people were their subjects and their disciples, <hi>vers.</hi> 7. 8, 10, 11, 12. <hi>The Scribes and Pharisees love to be called of men Rabbi, Rabbi. But be not ye called Rabbi, for. one is your Master</hi> [<gap reason="foreign">

But he that is greatest among you, shall be your ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vant: and whosoever shall exalt himself, shall be abased.</hi> These latter words confirm my interpretation. One part of which, <hi>viz.</hi> that which concerns <hi>secular</hi> dominion, I have also taken from our Saviour's words, <hi>cap.</hi> 10. 21. 26. <hi>Grant that these my two Sons may sit, the one on thy Right hand, and the other on thy left, in thy Kingdom.</hi> (And note ye that there was a strife among the Apostles, which of them should be counted greatest, <hi>Luk.</hi> 22. 24. and moreover they expected Christ would rule as a secular King, <hi>Luk.</hi> 19. 11. &amp; 24. 21. <hi>Act.</hi> 1. 6.)
<pb n="85" facs="tcp:37939:44"/>
               <hi>But Jesus said, ye know that the Princes of the Gentiles exercise Dominion over them, and they that are great, exercise authority upon them: but it shall not be so among you. But whoso<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever will be great among you, let him be your Minister.</hi> The other part of my interpreta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion which concerns Mastership over the <hi>faith</hi> of people, I have from St. <hi>Paul's</hi> words, 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 3. 4, 5. <hi>While one saith, I am of</hi> Paul, <hi>and ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, I am of</hi> Apollos, <hi>are ye not Carnal? who then is</hi> Paul, <hi>and who is</hi> Apollos, <hi>but Ministers by whom ye believed, even as the Lord gave to eve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry Man?</hi> The faith is not ours, but the Lords: we only Minister it in his Name, and as we have received it; we did not make it. <hi>ver.</hi> 9. <hi>VVe are Labourers together with God,</hi> [only such] <hi>ye are God's building</hi> [not ours.] 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 4. 5. <hi>VVe preach not our selves, but Christ.

<pb n="86" facs="tcp:37939:45"/>
interpretation I have likewise from St. <hi>Paul,</hi> 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 1. 12. 13. <hi>Every one of you saith, I am of</hi> Paul, <hi>and I of</hi> Apollos, <hi>and I of</hi> Cephas, <hi>and I of</hi> Christ. <hi>VVas</hi> Paul <hi>Crucified for you, or were you Baptised into the Name of</hi> Paul? Which is to say, you are not to profess your selves any mans disciples, but his only who was Crucified for you, and into whose name ye were Baptised, that is, <hi>Christ's.</hi> c. 2. 21. <hi>Let no man glory in Men, whether</hi> Paul <hi>or</hi> Apollos, <hi>or</hi> Cephas, <hi>all are yours. Ye are Christ's.</hi> They are only appointed of God to Minister to you. Christ is only your Master, Father, Head, <hi>chap.</hi> 11. 3. &amp; 7. 23. <hi>Heb.</hi> 3. 6. Again <hi>chap,</hi> 4. 1. <hi>Let a man account of us as the Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nisters of Christ, and Stewards of the Mysteries of God.</hi> No more than such, <hi>v.</hi> 6. <hi>And these things I have in a figure transferred to my self and</hi> Apollos <hi>for your sakes, that ye might learn in us not to think of men above that which hath been written: viz.</hi> That we are Ministers of Christ, and dispensers of God's Mysteries, and no more; not your Masters, nor Teachers of our own Doctrine. Thus you may see how far wide of the true sense you have erred, whilst you expound our Saviour's words, as forbidding to call, or to be called Master, or Sir, in civil respect. And you may discern that they which would have their doctrine pass for Oracles, without examination, and
<pb n="87" facs="tcp:37939:45"/>
their commands for Edicts, without contradi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction, and they that yield up themselves to such, are the offenders, though they neither give nor receive this title. I cannot but ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monish you here to look into your Bibles, and consider how the Texts stand which you cite, and not to conclude every portion of Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture which cometh into your mind, to be in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fused by the Holy Ghost, for you to make use of to the purpose which you intend, and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore not daring to examin it for the right sense, lest you should disobey that Holy One, and the work should smell a little of human study and care. For certainly you have erred, even where the words have no obscurity at all. And if you will not make use of your eies to see, and your understanding to consider, and will take no more pains than to speak and write, it is just that God suffer you to fall in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to mistakes that may justly shame you, that you may be more vigilant.</p>

And that the present words spake of this <hi>last</hi> Resurrection, the context abundantly shews. Vers. 16. &amp;c. <hi>If the Dead Rise not, then is not Christ Risen. and if Christ be not Raised, your Faith is vain, ye are yet in your Sins. Then they also which are fallen asleep in Christ are Perished. If in this Life only we have hope in Christ, we are of all-men most miserable. But now is Christ Risen from the Dead, and is become the first Fruits of them that Slept. For since by Man came Death, by Man came also the Resur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rection of the Dead.</hi> Now follows our Text: <hi>For as in</hi> Adam <hi>all Die, so in Christ shall all be made alive. But every man in his own or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der, Christ the first-fruits, afterward they that are Christ's at his coming. Then cometh the end, when he shall have delivered up the King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom
<pb n="91" facs="tcp:37939:47"/>
to God the Father. The last enemy that shall be destroyed is Death.</hi> Now note these things: The quickening by Christ or rising by him is of them that are <hi>fallen asleep in him,</hi> and is such as <hi>himself</hi> did partake of, and such as by which he became the <hi>first-fruits,</hi> and such as they that are his shall receive <hi>at his coming,</hi> even in the <hi>end</hi> of all things, when the last enemy <hi>Death</hi> shall be <hi>destroy'd.</hi> But now they that are Christ's are <hi>already</hi> quickned and raised from <hi>Sin,</hi> and such of them as are <hi>fallen asleep</hi> and are dead shall not receive <hi>this</hi> quickening at his <hi>coming</hi> in the <hi>end</hi> of all things, and <hi>Christ</hi> himself was never <hi>so</hi> quickened, as being never so Dead, nor therefore became the <hi>First-fruits</hi> by this Resurrection, and finally notwithstanding <hi>this</hi> Resurrection <hi>Death</hi> still <hi>remains.</hi> So ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nifestly have you erred in Interpreting these words mystically, <hi>As in</hi> Adam <hi>all Die, so in Christ shall all be made Alive.</hi> Dear Souls, ask your selves whence it is that you make such mistakes. Is it dulness of understand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing? is it carelesness? or pride, or pervers<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness of mind? Do not conceit vainly, that every thing that is mystically spoken, is ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cellently spoken. Let the Scriptures stand as they do, having been so ordered by a wiser than your selves. For you can not put upon them greater purity and spirituallity than
<pb n="92" facs="tcp:37939:48"/>
they have, though you should Interpret all mystically which they spake literally. And take heed of making void by such Interpre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tations those Texts which in their <hi>literal Sense</hi> contein the <hi>Chief Articles</hi> of our Religion lest others learn of you to do the same, and so the whole Gospel be turned into mystery and we have no foundation for our belief of a future Resurrection, a Judgment-day, Christ's coming from Heaven to judge the World our ascension thither, and entrance into that blessed place the Kingdom of God, the wick<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed's departure into Hell and endless Tor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments, good Angels and evil, the Crucifixion of Christ, &amp;c.</p>

Rulers are not a terror to good Works, but to evil. Wilt thou not then be afraid of the powers? They are God's Ministers.

you speak so as you make Scripture speak, there is no understanding of you: that is, if you mean another thing than your plain words signifie. For nothing can be spoken plainer than what the Apostle hath written here of the higher Powers; which yet you understand not of Rulers, but of the immor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tal power, which is over all Transgressors and above the Devil, contrary to which the Rul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers Act through their corruptions, and to which those higher powers are to be subject.</p>

               <q>and they call the Scripture so.

But the Gentiles had the <hi>Law with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in,</hi> which is Light, and we are still, under this, we are not delivered from it. Again, the Law, is <hi>Light.</hi> Then we may be sure that is so which <hi>Moses</hi> wrot, sorasmuch as that is the Law. The just conclusion there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore is that there are more Laws and Lights and Testimonies than one. Yes and more Testimonies of Jesus there are than the Spirit of Prophecy; for the Scriptures testifie of him, and you your selves say they are not the Spirit. Well, be it known unto you that as there is a Law within, so there is a Law
<pb n="96" facs="tcp:37939:50"/>
without: and this is a greater and more perfect Light, being added to that within since the corruption of it by the Fall, for the better information of mankind: insomuch that all that partake hereof are in a better condition than they that want it, as partak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of a peculiar priviledge and special bene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fit. This was the difference of the Jews, and Gentiles: they had the Law, these not. And what I pray you was this Law which the Jews enjoyed, but that which was pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lished by <hi>Moses</hi> and the Prophets? for as for the internal, that the Gentiles had as well as they. Rom. 2. 14. <hi>When the Gentiles which have not the Law, do by nature the things conteined in the Law, these having not the Law, are a Law unto themselves.</hi> Chap. 3. 1, 2. <hi>What advantage then hath the Jew? much every way: chiefly that unto them were committed the Oracles of God.</hi> Chap. 9. 4. <hi>To them was the giving of the Law, and the Services of God, and the Promises.</hi> Now when God saith to the <hi>Jews, to the Law and to the Testimony: if they speak not according to this word, it is because there is no Light in them,</hi> Isa. 8. 20. Let any man judge whether he sends them for the knowledge of his Will to the Law of the <hi>Gentiles,</hi> or to that given by <hi>Moses,</hi> which is peculiarly called <hi>their</hi> Law (<hi>It is written in your Law,</hi> Joh, 8. 17. and
<pb n="97" facs="tcp:37939:50"/>
10. 34. Moses <hi>gave you the Law,</hi> Chap. 7. 19.) whether to the Light of their own hearts, or to his Oracles, Statutes, and Judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments, as they were externally published. Or when he says the same to us <hi>Christians,</hi> whether he sends us to the Light in us, that we may know whether this Doctrine or the other which Men Teach be the Truth, or to the Scriptures; the Light, especially in eve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry one to whom this is said, being not per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect, especially not so perfect as the Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures in which God hath declared all his Will, every one being not like <hi>Moses</hi> and the Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phets, Christ and his Apostles. Let any man judge, since God hath sent Prophets, and by them hath published his Will, and that in writing, he yet sends us to the Light in us for the knowledg of his Will and for the determination of all controversies: And whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther if he had not externally published a Law and Testimony by his Servants the Prophets, he would say to us, <hi>To the Law and Testimony.</hi> Let me know whether the Light in the Jews told them God would have them circumcise, burn incense, offer sacrifice, and slay such and such Beasts and not others, keep holy the se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venth day, abstein from several sorts of Meats, from Blood and things strangled: and if a controversie should arise about these, whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther they were to go to the written Law of
<pb n="98" facs="tcp:37939:51"/>
               <hi>Moses,</hi> or to the unwritten Law of Light in every one of their own Hearts. Let me know whether the Light within sufficiently tells us, that the Meslias is come, or indeed that one was promised; that Jesus Born of <hi>Mary</hi> is he, or indeed that he was Born at all of a Woman and had real Flesh; that he Died, and by that Death redeemed us, and through his Blood shed we are Saved upon our Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pentance and an holy Life; that our Spirits do not Die, we shall be made Alive again and rise from the Grave, the Wicked shall have endless Torment, the Righteous endless Joy: insomuch that if Christ and his Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stles had never spoken a word, and we had never received the Scriptures, nor had heard a syllable of all this Preached by Men, we should have known it all, and as firmly have believed it as now we do. For it is said, we are built upon the Foundation of the Prophets and Apostles. And, Jesus Christ hath brought Life and Immortality to light through the Gospel. The Life was mani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fested, and we have seen it, and shew unto you the Eternal Life, which was with the Father, and was manifested unto us. The mystery hid from Ages, is now made mani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fest. The things which God hath prepared for us have not entred into the heart of Man, but God hath revealed them unto us by his
<pb n="99" facs="tcp:37939:51"/>
Spirit. And these things were Preached un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to others that they might know them, and believe, and have Eternal Life. Lastly, the Spirit of Prophecy in the Text you cite (<hi>Rev.</hi> 19. 10.) is not the Spirit as it is in eve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry man, as you understood it; unless you will say contrary to St. <hi>Paul, all</hi> are <hi>Prophets,</hi> 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 12. 29. <hi>Eph.</hi> 4. 11. for it is the Spirit as Prophesying, and that in the strict signi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fication of the word, which is to praedict, as the <hi>Angel</hi> and St. <hi>John</hi> did, of whom it is here spoken. For thus are the Words: <hi>I fell at his Feet to worship: and he said unto me, see thou do it not: I am they Fellow-Servant and of thy Brethren which have the Testimony of Jesus: worship God: for the Testimony of Jesus is the Spirit of Prophecy.</hi> Which is to say, I am but as thy self; thou hast the Spirit of Prophecy as well as I; I am but a Prophet, testifying of Jesus, like thy self. As Chap. 22. 9. <hi>I am thy Fellow-Servant and of thy Bre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thren the Prophets.</hi> So that when <hi>Isaiah</hi> faith to all, <hi>to the Testimony,</hi> exhorting them to keep close to that word, and to enquire there whether that which any man shall spake be Truth, he cannot mean the Spirit of Prophe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy, because all have it not in themselves, nor is it the Will of God they should: for he dispences the gifts of the Spirit severally, to one Wisdom, to another Miracles, to ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther

Let me hear you say, all men, Heathens as well as Christians, have the Spirit of Prophecy in their Hearts, which testifies of Jesus, and Prophesies of him, speaks of things to come, of his Name, his Servants, his worship, his Enemies, his Kingdom and Church; as it spake, testified, and prophesied in the Angel and the Apostle, as appears by the whole Book.</p>

dwelling place, and root thee out of the land of the living.</hi> Such is the silence before spoken of, as when the Psalmist saith, <hi>Unless the Lord had been my help, my Soul had almost dwelt in silence,</hi> Psal. 94. 17.</p>

Or which is all one, that those Scriptures are, which express that Doctrine, and that after the most lively manner, even according to the mind of God himself, who so delivered them by his own Spirit? Thus we read there, and thus it is spoken to us from thence by our
<pb n="107" facs="tcp:37939:55"/>
Preachers. Sinners, you must forsake your evil ways, and become new creatures; not only outwardly reform, but be inwardly holy, and changed in your natures; must cleanse your selves from all filthiness, not only of the flesh, but of the Spirit also; you must walk in the fear of God, and observe diligently all his Commandments, love them, and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>light in them; or else you cannot be saved, but must burn, as God hath pronounced, in the Lake of Fire and Brimstone, and suffer his wrath and indignation for ever. His love is exceeding great to us, who is not willing that any should perish, but that all should have everlasting life: and to that end hath given his only begotten Son to die an igno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minious and painful death, and to bear our sins on his own body on the Tree, and to make atonement for us, and hath set him up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on the Throne with himself to rule over all things for our good, and hath sent forth his mighty and gracious Spirit to enlighten, con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vert, strengthen, and comfort us. Courage poor Soul and look up: Glory is provided for thee who hast offended, greater than the most magnificent Prince on earth enjoys. Harken to the holv Guide in thy Soul, cease thy Rebellion, and thou shalt inherit Heaven, dwell with God in that supernal Palace, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>holding his Face in Peace, and have fulness
<pb n="108" facs="tcp:37939:56"/>
of joy, all perfection, and life for evermore. Blessed art thou, O man, who hast subdued thy Lusts, overcome the World, and hast put on Jesus Christ; for unto thee belongeth this blessedness, Kingdom, and Glory. Though we Die, we shall be made alive again, and stand before the Judge, which knoweth what we have done, and what hath been in our hearts, and who will accept no mans person, but will render to all according to their de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>serts: so that our portion in the end will be either that bliss, or that misery: and this is not our word, but the Mouth of the Lord hath spoken it. Now call you this a carnal Letter, a dead, insipid, spiritless thing? Hath it no more power in it to move the Soul, than characters of Ink drawn upon a Paper? It pierces the Sinner like a Sword, and com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>forts the humble Soul more than Wine. The very contrivance of the Scriptures spits shame in the face of your bold assertion; they be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing adorned with all perspicuity, that we may understand the truth; and with the strongest arguments to perswade us to our duty, as the love of God, the Death of his Son, the assistance of his Spirit, the filthiness and incommodities of Vice, the purity, and beauty, and benefits of Vertue, the Resur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rection and the Judgment, the Glory of Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven, and the Torments of Hell. And so
<pb n="109" facs="tcp:37939:56"/>
long as men have understanding, fear, hope, and love of themselves, this word can not be as a mere block and stone to them. And you may hence discern that there is a force in the very things themselves, in that the same person works more upon the auditors when he Preaches clearly, pertinently, and the weightiest matters, than when he speaks of more extrinsick Points, and Doctrines of the least moment, and makes Childish des<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cants, and involves all he says in obscurity. I demand, if the Scriptures be such a dead letter, and killing thing, death it self, why the Apostle wrot, or why do you? Did he contradict his Tongue with his own hand at the same moment? Did he believe that he sent the <hi>Corinthians</hi> a word as dead as his Ink, and a letter that Killeth? or will you say it was not so with him, because he had the Spirit, and that went along with it from him to them? If so, you must tell us why the Spirit may not as well accompany the same to us, which we likewise have receiv<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed. But know you, however it was that life came into the dead thing, they acknowledg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed that his Letters were mighty and power<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful, 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 10. 10. And it seems some of you perceived that this Doctrine, and these good works which the Scriptures contein, are not altogether so weak and dead as others would
<pb n="110" facs="tcp:37939:57"/>
make them, for that they have added, that out of a <hi>wicked</hi> mans mouth they can do no good, and yet further, that the Apostle speaks this of <hi>false Apostles, The Letter kills.</hi> Well then, our Ministers may still Preach them with comfort, if they be <hi>righteous;</hi> out of such mouths they may do good, reach the seed of God, raise it up, and refresh it; and there is virtue in them, if they be not Mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stred by <hi>false Teachers;</hi> who yet you should observe Minister not them, but <hi>another</hi> thing; the figments of their own brains in their place, <hi>false Doctrine,</hi> as they are <hi>false Teach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers;</hi> whereas I thought you had understood by the Letter, the Scriptures without their corruption, and so you do, however you thus speak. But I like not these words, <hi>The truest words out of a bad mans mouth kill and burden the seed of God in others.</hi> It might be more innocently said, his sinfulness doth this, or is the occasion of it, than to lay the blame up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on the pure and incorrupted Doctrine of God, or to charge it with so dreadful and dismal an effect. I hope such a conceit as this lies not at the bottom, <hi>viz.</hi> that the sin in the man infects the Doctrine, and so it becomes noxious to others that hear it, like as breath receives contagion from a contagious Body, and conveighs the same to them, into whose Lungs it enters. Nor do I like this saying,
<pb n="111" facs="tcp:37939:57"/>
               <hi>The truest words out of a bad mans mouth can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not reach the seed of God, raise it up, or refresh it.</hi> For that hereby you spoil the word of Christ of all power, and render the Doctrine of the Gospel as impotent in it self as is si<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lence and a dead Mouth, or as it is our hand to work any good upon the Soul; which yet is of such a nature (as I have shewed) as that it must needs have a force in it, and is cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led the power of God, and even herein ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cels the Law, in that it is more vivid and quickening. And hereby you make all the efficacy and the effect to depend upon the goodness of the Preacher: as if his Soul rightly moving affects the Holy Ghost with whom she is conjoined, and that great Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit which sills all places, transfers the moti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons unto the Souls of others, like as some say impresses being made upon the Spirit of nature, are carried by the same from Body to Body, just as a stroke given at one end of a line runs unto the other; so that no good can be done, let the Doctrine be never so right and excellent, unless such a motion can be made, and no such motion can be made but by a Pious Soul. If this be the mystery, I leave it to them that love it. Only let me say, <hi>The Wind bloweth where it listeth, and thou hearest the sound of it, but canst not tell whence it cometh, and whither it goeth: so is

euery one that is born of the Spirit,</hi> Joh. 3. 8. <hi>As thou knowest not what is the way of the Spirit, nor how the bones do grow in the Womb of her that is with Child: even so thou know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>est not the works of God who maketh all,</hi> Eccl. 11. 5. <hi>So is the Kingdom of God; as if a man should cast Seed into the Ground, and should sleep, and should rise night and day, and the Seed should spring and grow up, he knoweth not how. For the Earth bringeth forth Fruit of it self, first the Blade, then the Ear, after that the full Corn in the Ear.</hi> The Seed is good, cast it into the Ground, and as for the success, leave that to God: who we may be sure hath a blessing for his own word of truth: and as his blessing accompanies the goodness of the Man, so it doth the goodness of the Doctrine; and his Spirit which waters and quickens and brings forth Fruit, proceeds not from man, nor depends upon his sanctity as to others reception of it, but proceeds from himself, and he sends it forth whither he pleases, and it is willing to work in us all. Paul <hi>Plants, and</hi> Apollo <hi>Waters: but God gives the increase. So then, neither is he that Plant<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth any thing, nor he that Watereth: but God that giveth the Increase,</hi> 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 3. That we may know whether the Spirit in one can act upon another, let the Spiritual man keep si<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lence, and let a particular Doctrine or some
<pb n="113" facs="tcp:37939:59"/>
particular Sins be proposed to him privatly, and let us see whether he can instruct the minds of others in that Doctrine, or con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vince them of those Sins. St. <hi>Paul</hi> makes me despair of any effect, in that he says the Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritual man that speaks in an unknown Tongue (and that is as much as he kept silence) ef<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fects nothing, 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 14. (2) Because you condemn our Preaching from the <hi>Scriptures</hi> without immediate <hi>Revelation,</hi> calling us for that cause alone Ministers of the <hi>Letter:</hi> let me tell you, that whilst our hearts are honest, and we entirely desire and labour after the Conversion and Salvation of Souls, and God hath blessed us with the knowledge of his Will, and with zeal for his Glory, and with the sanctification of our natures, and with good success of our labours, we will not be ashamed of this Ministry, though it please him to give us no more than ordinary assi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stance of his Spirit (which he that hath not, is none of his;) and we receive not his word as the Apostles and Prophets did by ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>traordinary inspiration, and by inspiration a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lone; but meditate and study, and so Preach as we have learned the truth from the Scriptures through the help of God which we have had in our diligence, according to the good sense of divine things upon our hearts. For whereas St. <hi>Paul</hi> received not the Gospel
<pb n="114" facs="tcp:37939:60"/>
of man, nor was taught it, but by the Reve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lation of Jesus Christ, <hi>Gal.</hi> 1. 12. you read o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>therwise of <hi>Timothy</hi> and <hi>Titus</hi> and other Preachers. 2 Tim. 1. 3. <hi>Hold fast the form of sound words which thou hast learned of me</hi> Chap. 3. 14. <hi>Continue thou in the things which thou hast learned and hast been assured of knowing of whom thou hast learned them, and that from a Child thou hast known the Holy Scriptures, which are able to make thee wise unto Salvation through Faith which is in Christ Jesus. All Scripture is given by Inspiration and is profitable for Doctrine; for Reproof, for Correction, for Instruction in Righteousness: that the man of God</hi> [<hi>Timothy,</hi> or any other such Preacher, 1 Tim. 6. 11.] <hi>may be perfect, throughly furnished unto all good works.</hi> 1 Tim. 4. 11. <hi>These things command and teach.</hi> Vers. 13. 15. <hi>Give attendance to reading, to exhorta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, to doctrine. Meditate upon these things. give thy self wholly to them, that thy profiting may appear to all.</hi> Chap. 3. 14, 15. <hi>These things write I unto thee, that thou mayest know how to behave thy self in the house of God.</hi> 2 Tim. 2. 2. <hi>The things which thou hast heard of me among many Witnesses, the same commit thou to Faithful men, who shall be able to Teach others also. Vide etiam. Tit.</hi> 1. 9. and 2. 15. Here then are Ministers of the Doctrine which they had learned and had been taught of
<pb n="115" facs="tcp:37939:60"/>
men, and of things committed to them by others, and studying Ministers. If they had received the word by Revelation like St. <hi>Paul,</hi> what need he teach and direct them? Did he teach and direct the other Apostles thus? Was the word committed to them by men? Had they learned it of others? Were they who were sent forth immediatly by Christ and the Inspiration of the Holy Ghost, chosen of men as being judged Faithful? (3) But now let us view the <hi>Text</hi> from whence you have taken occasion to speak as you do: a little consideration of which would have delivered you from your errors: <hi>viz.</hi> 2 Cor. 3. 5. &amp;c. <hi>Not that we are sufficient of our selves to think any thing as of our selves, but our sufficience is of God.</hi> Thus having told them from <hi>whence</hi> they had their <hi>ability.</hi> he next tells them <hi>what</hi> a <hi>word</hi> it is which they Preached: Vers: 6. <hi>Who also hath made us able Ministers of the New Testament, not of the Letter, but of the Spirit: For the letter Killeth, but the Spirit giveth Life.</hi> And so goes on in commendation of the same <hi>Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrine,</hi> comparing it with the <hi>Law,</hi> that the glory of it might appear to exceed the Glory of the Law; saying, <hi>The Law is the Mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stration of Death and Condemnation, but this the Ministration of Life and Righteousness. And Moses put a Veil upon his Face, and until
<pb n="116" facs="tcp:37939:61"/>
this day remaineth the same Veil untaken away in the reading of the Old Testament: but this Veil is done away in Christ, and we use plain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness of Speech; and with open Face, beholding as in a glass, the Glory of the Lord, are changed into the same Image</hi> [Vid. vers. 7. to 12.] <hi>as by the Spirit of the Lord.</hi> Wherefore he con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cludes, Chap. 4. 1. <hi>Therefore seeing we have this Ministry, as we have received mercy we faint not.</hi> So that the <hi>Letter</hi> is such a word as is external, obscure, dead and lifeless, which is without the Spirit, and which Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>condemns: And therefore by no means can be the <hi>Doctrine</hi> of the <hi>Gospel,</hi> which on the contrary is of an internal nature, perspicuous, quick and powerful, which is accompanied with the Spirit, and which holds forth justi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fication. And that it is the <hi>Law,</hi> is manifest, in that as the <hi>Letter Killeth,</hi> so he tells us of the <hi>Ministration of Death,</hi> which you your selves will acknowledge to be the <hi>Law:</hi> and <hi>this Ministration,</hi> which is the <hi>Law,</hi> so exact<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly answers the <hi>Letter,</hi> that it is said to be <gap reason="foreign">

<pb n="117" facs="tcp:37939:61"/>
not in oldness of the Letter.</hi> And as for the killing of the Letter, we read it thus, v. 11. <hi>Sin taking occasion by the Commandment, de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived me, and slew me.</hi> Again, c. 8. 2. <hi>The law of the Spirit of life in Christ Jesus hath made me free from the law of sin and death.</hi> But I have an argument which I dare say you will not deny, <hi>viz. G.

               </q> Why the Apostle calleth the <hi>law</hi> the <hi>letter,</hi> in opposi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion to the <hi>Spirit,</hi> belongs not to our present business to explain.

If the King had commanded him to see this honour performed towards <hi>Haman,</hi> I believe he would have refused as well as he did to bow; and that he would likewise have refused to run before him, or to wait upon him at his Table, if he could have done it with equal safety. For that his refusal was not out of Conscience, we have this evidence, <hi>Many</hi> of as good Conscience as he both <hi>gave</hi> and <hi>re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived</hi> this reverence: (you take for granted that no <hi>other</hi> bowing and reverencing is meant than what is ordinary among us at this day:) and they gave and received also titles of Honour, 1 <hi>Kings</hi> 1. 23. Nathan <hi>the Prophet bowed himself before the King with his face to the ground, and said, My Lord, O King,</hi> c. 18. 7. Obadiah <hi>fell on his face, and said, Art thou that my Lord</hi> Elijah? v. 12. 13. <hi>I thy servant fear the Lord from my youth. Was it not told my Lord,</hi> &amp;c. Gen 23. 7. Abraham <hi>stood up and bowed himself to the people of the Land.</hi> c. 33. 3, 14. Jacob <hi>bowed himself to</hi> Esau, <hi>and said, Let my Lord pass over before his servant.</hi> 1 Chron. 29. 20. <hi>All the Congregation bowed down their heads, and worshipped the Lord and the King.</hi> Now let the reason be shewed, why the single example of <hi>Mordecay</hi> should prevail against all these. But besides exam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ples, we have a <hi>precept:</hi> Lev. 19. 32, <hi>Thou
<pb n="120" facs="tcp:37939:63"/>
shalt rise up before the hoary head, and honour the face of the old man, and fear thy God.</hi> (2) And from this Text it is apparent that you speak just contrary to the mind of God, in saying, that to <hi>rise up</hi> is not to <hi>honour</hi> men, when he says, <hi>Rise up</hi> and <hi>honour.</hi> And where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>as you interpret that command of our Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viour by his Apostle, <hi>Honour all men,</hi> to sig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nify that we <hi>love</hi> them, and <hi>do good</hi> to them, as if this were all; common sense teacheth you that these are two <hi>distinct</hi> precepts: and you might have learned so much from that very place which you cite, where they are distinctly named: 1 <hi>Pet.</hi> 2. 17. <hi>Honour all men: Love the Brotherhood.</hi> So Rom. 12. 10 <hi>Be kindly affectioned one to another with bro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>therly love; in honour presering one another.</hi> (3) You miserably confound two sorts of <hi>re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>spect,</hi> that in <hi>judgment</hi> with that of <hi>civility.</hi> And it is a wonderful thing that you cannot discern the difference, when you cite the ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry Text which plainly shews it; <hi>Lev.</hi> 19. 15. <hi>Ye shall do no unrighteousness in judgment: thou shalt not respect the person of the Poor, nor honour the person of the Mighty: but in righteousness shalt thou judge thy Neighbour.</hi> Where you might have observed, that re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>specting of the <hi>Poor,</hi> is as well forbidden as of the <hi>Rich:</hi> and that it is a peculiar injun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction to <hi>Judges.</hi> The true sense is this, Let
<pb n="121" facs="tcp:37939:63"/>
neither the Poor be favoured sor his poverty, nor the Mighty for his greatness; but <hi>judge</hi> the Cause just as it is in it self, without any regard to the persons. Which is quite another thing than to put off the Hat, Rise up, or Bow, or say Sir, in our common discourse. Which kind of respect you would prove our <hi>Saviour</hi> gave not, from the testimony of his Enemies: but with the like perverting of the Text; which like the former, speaks of giv<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing faithful <hi>judgment,</hi> and of declaring the Truth, without <hi>favour</hi> to any person; as the bare recital of the Text will shew. Luk. 20. 21. 22. <hi>Master, we know that thou sayest and teachest rightly, neither acceptest thou the per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son of any, but teachest the way of God truly: Is it lawful to give Tribute to</hi> Caesar, <hi>or no?</hi> (4) As for St. <hi>James'</hi>s words, let us consider them diligently. c. 2. 1. <hi>Have not the Faith of our Lord Jesus Christ with respect of persons.</hi> That St. <hi>James</hi> speaks this, not against all re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>spect, but that the <hi>Poor</hi> as well as the Rich should be <hi>regarded,</hi> and that they should not be <hi>contemned,</hi> will appear by what follows. For says he next: <hi>For if there come into your Assembly a man with a gold Ring, in goodly Ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parel, and there come in also a poor man in vile rayment, and ye have respect to</hi> [<gap reason="foreign">

               <hi>partial in your selves, and are become judges of e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vil thoughts?</hi> Take away then this <hi>partiality,</hi> and let the <hi>poor</hi> be respected, and then the Apostle is <hi>satisfied.</hi> Let them not be put under the Foot-stool, but be put in a good place, as the Rich are, and he will not condemn us. He speaks not against the <hi>respect</hi> of the <hi>Rich,</hi> but the neglect and <hi>con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tempt</hi> of the <hi>Poor.</hi> In favour of them he writes; telling us withal that we <hi>judge</hi> amiss, and not as Christianity hath instructed us, if we think that there is any great matter in a few fine cloaths, and in riches, and that a poor man may be <hi>slighted</hi> meerly upon the account of his <hi>poverty;</hi> for the Rich may be a evry Enemy of God and all goodness, and the Poor may be as much adorned with ver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tue, which is the true Riches, as the other is with gold. As it follows: <hi>Hearken my beloved Brethren, hath not God chosen the poor of this world, rich in Faith, and heirs of the Kingdom, which he hath promised to them that love him? But ye have despised the poor.</hi> These last words shew again whereunto the Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stles discourse tendeth, <hi>viz.</hi> That the <hi>Poor</hi> be not <hi>contemned.</hi> God, says he, hath con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sidered them, he hath not overlooked them
<pb n="123" facs="tcp:37939:64"/>
in his distribution of divine things, having made them rich in faith, and so heirs of his own Kingdom; and for this some of them you see are worthy to be <hi>regarded:</hi> but how<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever, to despise any of them, is to do con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary to God, who hath chosen such. <hi>Do not rich men oppress you, and draw you before the Judgment-seats? Do they not blaspheme that worthy name by which you are called?</hi> Riches make not men better; for some that have them, are the greatest sinners, and your Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>secutors; and therefore there is no reason to regulate your esteem of men altogether for their sake. <hi>If ye fulfil the royal law, according to the Scripture, Thou shalt love thy neighbour as thy self, ye do well.</hi> It is well done be sure to observe the great Commandment of the Law, which is also the Commandment of our Lord Christ in his Gospel, <hi>love thy Neighbour as thy self.</hi> And this requires love to all, to the poor, for he is equally thy Neighbour: and if we must <hi>love</hi> him, we know then that this cannot consist with the <hi>contempt</hi> of him. And as we would not be despised, if we were poor, so should we love <hi>others,</hi> as we do our selves, and not despise them that are in that condition. <hi>But if you have respect to persons, ye commit sin, and are convinced of the law as Transgressors.</hi> But know you, to respect per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sons is directly forbidden in the <hi>law.</hi> As <hi>Deut.</hi>
               <pb n="124" facs="tcp:37939:65"/>
1. 17. <hi>Ye shall not respect persons in judgment: but you shall hear the small as well as the great.</hi> And to honour the Rich, and not the Poor, to look upon the one highly, and to despise the other, is just such another partiality as to hear the great, and not the small, to do justice to the one, and not to the other; and therefore if you do thus, ye are alike convinced of the Law as Transgressors. But now, said the Law, you shall not <hi>honour</hi> man, not any man whatever? We know the contrary: for it is said, <hi>Honour Father and Mother: Honour the Face of the Old Man.</hi> And therefore when it says, Have no respect of persons, it can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not mean in this sense. <hi>Acceptation</hi> of <hi>per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sons,</hi> and <hi>giving</hi> of <hi>honour</hi> to men, are two very <hi>different</hi> things. Wherefore St. <hi>James</hi> speaking of <hi>that respect</hi> of persons which the Law did <hi>condemn,</hi> he cannot be understood of <hi>that</hi> which it did <hi>not condemn,</hi> namely, the <hi>honouring</hi> of men; as if he absolutely prohi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bited it. Which we may know further can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not be his meaning, in that it is contrary to St. <hi>Peter,</hi> who saith, <hi>Honour all men.</hi> And all that I can observe from his whole discourse (which we have seen) is, that he pleads for the due observation of this Precept, which is inconsistent with giving <hi>honour</hi> to the <hi>Rich,</hi> and <hi>none</hi> to the <hi>Poor,</hi> respecting those, and despising these, which is the thing he con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demns.
<pb n="125" facs="tcp:37939:65"/>
If it had been said, If you have re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>spect to the Rich, and your friends and kin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dred, and bestow gifts upon them, and do them courtesies, and receive not the poor, and enemies and unallied, nor shew them any kindness, are you not partial? Would this signifie that no such thing ought to be done to our Kindred and Friends, and the rich? By no means so: Yes, notwithstanding our Saviour saith, <hi>When thou makest a dinner, call not thy friends, nor thy brethren, nor thy rich neighbours,</hi> Luk. 14. 12. So when it is said, <hi>If you have respect to the rich man, and say to him, sit thou here in a good place, and say to the poor, sit thou here under my footstool, are ye not partial?</hi> Neither doth this likewise mean, that a Rich man may not be respect<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, honoured, and set in a good place. I would willingly know, since he says, to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>spect persons is to be <hi>partial,</hi> how I am par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tial if I <hi>respect all,</hi> by putting off my Hat, rising up, and bowing to all. Which respect he that gives to the Rich, and denies it to the Poor, is the person St. <hi>James</hi> condemns. And truly if a man hath either the fear of God, or the love of men, or but common civility, he will pay his fellow-creature this respect, and much more of the same sort, how mean soever he be, as he doth to his Superiors. The refusal of which, what doth it argue but
<pb n="126" facs="tcp:37939:66"/>
pride and contempt? Well, but you then fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther say, St. <hi>James</hi> would have no <hi>difference</hi> made, but that one be respected and honoured <hi>as much</hi> as another; the Poor as much as the Rich, the meanest as much as the mightiest. Not so, my Friends, for in the same place where it is said, <hi>Honour all men,</hi> it is said, <hi>Honour the King,</hi> 1 <hi>Pet.</hi> 2. 17. which denotes something peculiar, which is due to him, and not to others. And it is said again, <hi>Render to all their dues, Tribute to whom Tribute is due, Custome to whom Custome, Fear to whom Fear, Honour to whom Honour, Rom.</hi> 13. 7. In that it is said, <hi>Honour to whom Honour is due.</hi> It denotes here somewhat more than that which is due to all men, even as he says the same of Tribute, and Custome, and Fear; which we know are not due to all. It is said more<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>over, as for greater Emphasis of a lamenta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble condition, <hi>The faces of the Elders were not honoured,</hi> Lam. 5. 12. And note our Saviours words, Luk. 14. 10. <hi>When thou art bidden to a Wedding, sit down in the lowest room, that when he that bad thee cometh; he may say unto thee, Friend, go up higher; then shalt thou have worship in the presence of them that sit at meat with thee.</hi> This is honouring of one more than another, and our Saviour allows it. You may observe also that <hi>God</hi> himself hath given Titles of Honour with difference; for he styled
<pb n="127" facs="tcp:37939:66"/>
some Gods, Kings, Honourable, Lords; Ladies, and doth not call all so, nor all these by the same name. And that you may know when he thus speaketh, it is not as if he said, <hi>whom the world calls so;</hi> remember but that one sentence, <hi>I have said ye are Gods;</hi> together with our Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viour's words, <hi>If he called them Gods, &amp;c. John</hi> 10. 34, 35. My Friends, why let you the poor man stand at your doors, and begg for bread, and give him a piece only; and that of the coursest sort, and yet invite the rich man in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to your house, set him at your Table, and feast him with the best? Is not this respect of persons? and are you not partial? Yes, and when the King (suppose) feasts with you, why do you give him the silver Plate, and damask Napkin, and provide attendants of the better sort, when the poor man must have the wooden Trencher, and the hurden Towel, and scarce any observance, or none at all? Do ye offer the King a wooden dish to drink in? which yet you give the poor man, and for no other reason, but because he is so. Set you the Beggar down by the Noble? Or if he place himself at the head of the Table, in such a presence, do ye not bid him change his place and come lower, and so shame him? which also you would not do, if it had been among his Fellow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>beggars. Are not these unrighteous things? Is not this partiality? And have you not,
<pb n="128" facs="tcp:37939:67"/>
Because of this, the Faith of our Lord Jesus, with respect of persons? Think of it. And think again, whether thus to do, be not as much as to put off the Hat.</p>

                  <hi>Swear not at all.</hi> But you will say, this is meant of ordinary Swearing. But whoever thou art, by thy earthly carnal wisdom knowest not what Christ meant. Is there not Swearing before Magistrates every day in one place or other, at Terms, Sizes, Quarter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>Sessions, Court-Leets? would you have it commoner?]</q> Thus lies our Saviours words, <hi>Mat.</hi> 5. 33. &amp;c. <hi>You have heard that it hath been said to them of old time, Thou shalt not forswear thy self, but shalt perform unto the Lord thine Oaths.</hi> Though the latter words, which belong to promissory Oaths, seem to infer, that the former, whose opposite they are, do so too: yet I shall understand false assertions, as well as non-performance of pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mises made by Oath to be here forbidden: as if it had been said thus, Thou shalt not forswear thy self, but shalt swear truly, or, and moreover, thou shalt perform unto the Lord thine Oaths: which then would plainly have taken in both. For I doubt not but those words, as they stand in the Law, forbid both, and no question but as the Jews swore commonly of their own accord in the one
<pb n="129" facs="tcp:37939:67"/>
sort, so they did in the other; and our Savi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>our intends equally to rectifie the fault. It follows, <hi>But I say unto you, Swear not at all.</hi> This must be more than the <hi>Law</hi> said, and therefore prohibits Swearing, though the Truth be asserted, or the promise performed. For as much as the Law it self prohibited false assertions by Oath, and non-performance of promises so made. But now this <hi>Swear not at all,</hi> denotes a <hi>voluntary</hi> act, and relates to the evil custom of the <hi>Jews.</hi> As if it had been said, Swear not at all, as you commonly do of your own accord: No, though you swear truly. And therefore it belongs not to the taking of an Oath before a <hi>Magistrate,</hi> which is a <hi>constrained</hi> act; as every one knows the difference betwixt <hi>Swearing</hi> and being <hi>adju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red.</hi> Next he says: <hi>Neither by Heaven, nor by Earth, nor by Jerusalem, nor by thy head.</hi> This is another indication that the swearing which our Saviour forbids, is that which men use freely of themselves in their converse: for that the <hi>Magistrate</hi> never administred an Oath in his judiciary process in <hi>these forms,</hi> but only as the Law required, in and by the <hi>Name</hi> of <hi>God.</hi> But the people used com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monly such Oaths in their ordinary con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verse and private business. And that they did, partly out of <hi>reverence</hi> to the Name of God (as we learn from <hi>Philo</hi>

                  </gap>, &amp;c. If necessity require an Oath, it is more fit to swear by the health and old age of Father and Mother, if they be living; and if they be dead, by their blessed me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mory: because God is not to be rashly named, — Some are wont to say, So help me, omiting the rest: which might be compleated, not by adding, the most High, but Earth, Sun, Heaven or the World. But others are so hasty, that passing by the creatures, they are bold to swear by the Creator himself.</note>:) and partly because they thought themselves the <hi>less obliged</hi> by these; as we learn from our Saviour, <hi>Mat.</hi> 23. 16, 18. <hi>Wo to you blind guides; which say; whosoever shall swear by the Temple, it is nothing; but whoso shall Swear by the Gold of the Temple, he is a Debtor: Whoso shall Swear by the Altar, it is nothing; but whoso shall Swear by the Gift that is upon it, he is a Debtor.</hi> So that our Savi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>our says thus much: <hi>Swear not at all;</hi> I do not mean only by the Name of God, but in any of those other forms which are in use a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mong you, as by Heaven, Earth, the Temple, the Altar, &amp;c. which clearly signifies that the swearing which he forbids, is in that manner in which those <hi>forms</hi> were <hi>used:</hi> which was in ordinary <hi>converse,</hi> not in solemn <hi>judicature.</hi> He adds further thus: <hi>For Heaven is God's Throne, Earth his Footstool, Jerusalem his City, and thou can'st not make one hair white or black.</hi> Which is to say, Though you think it
<pb n="131" facs="tcp:37939:68"/>
               <hi>less,</hi> because you do not use God's name in these forms, I tell you it is all one; for e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven herein you do Swear by <hi>him,</hi> c. 23. 21, 22. <hi>Whoso shall Swear by the Temple, sweareth by it, and by him that dwelleth therein; and he that shall Swear by Heaven, sweareth by the Throne of God, and by him that sitteth thereon.</hi> Lastly, it is said, <hi>But let your communication</hi> [<gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap>, speech, word,] <hi>be yea yea, nay nay; for whatsoever is more than these, cometh of evil</hi> As if he had said, only say to one another, It is so, or it is not so: I will do it, or I will not do it. Which further shews, that our Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viour's prohibition is limited to our common converse with one another. As for the rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son of the prohibition, it signifies thus much, This common voluntary swearing ariseth from some evil principle or other, as the malignity of nature, pride, vanity, profaneness, passion, irreverence of God, or the instigation of the Devil. But now, if only <hi>voluntary</hi> swearing be here forbidden, it may be said, The <hi>Law</hi> forbad as <hi>much,</hi> and therefore our Saviour hath <hi>added</hi> nothing to it; whereas he tells us in the same place (<hi>vers.</hi> 17.) that he came to <hi>fulfil</hi> and compleat it; and this is one particular in which he hath done so, as is evident by his making it an instance of his superaddition. To which I answer, It cannot be questioned but that our Saviour hath <hi>expressed</hi> the Law
<pb n="132" facs="tcp:37939:69"/>
in its <hi>full latitude;</hi> especially considering he now intended to compleat it. And as he did express it, it is manifest he hath compleated it. For whereas it is said only, <hi>Thou shalt not forswear thy self:</hi> is not this more which he says, <hi>Thou shalt not Swear at all in com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>munication?</hi> If the Law said this, how could our Saviour speak as he doth by way of <hi>ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dition, But I say it?</hi> Which signifies plainly that the Law did not say, <hi>Swear not at all in communication?</hi> But what then? Might the <hi>Jews</hi> swear <hi>as much</hi> as they <hi>pleased</hi> in com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon speech and converse, so that they swore <hi>truly?</hi> I ask likewise, forasmuch as the Law said only, <hi>Thou shalt not commit Adultery:</hi> might the <hi>Jews</hi> therefore <hi>lust</hi> after Women as much as they pleased, and was there no <hi>sin</hi> to them in so doing? By no means so: neither the one, nor the other; for though the Law <hi>expressed</hi> no more, yet they might discern by the common light of nature, and much more by that light which the Law of God (which <hi>Moses</hi> delivered to them) afforded, that God's name was not to be used in vain, and that they were not to Swear rudely, lightly, irre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verently; and that likewise unclean desires ought not to lodge in the heart: As, though the Law expressed not the <hi>promise</hi> of <hi>eternal</hi> life (as say some) yet they could not be alto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether ignorant of it, nor were they, but ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pected

Do not these former as much express the nature of an Oath as the latter? or as much as so help me God, By this light, By this Drink, which are used as forms in Swearing? For my part I would as unwillingly use the one, as the other. And I put it to your Conscience, whether in Witness-bearing, or in the mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter of Allegience and Supremacy, or any o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther publick concern, you will say before the Magistrate, I call God to record upon my Soul, or, As God is true, or, By our joy in Christ Jesus, this is so, or, thus will I do. Well then, St. <hi>Paul</hi> speaking thus more than once, and deliberately in writing, certainly he did not understand our Saviour's words so strictly, but that a Christian may upon
<pb n="134" facs="tcp:37939:70"/>
weighty consideration swear sometime in the fear of God, when he is not required by the power of the Magistrate. And my reason for this is, not only that Holy Mans example, but because this kind of Swearing proceedeth not from evil, neither irreverence towards God, nor vanity of mind, no inconsiderat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness, nor any corrupt principle; which is the reason of our Saviour's prohibition. To pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vent your censure, let me publish, that to my knowledge I never Swore any sort of Oath but before an Officer that required it: I thank God for his grace.</p>

Or which is all one, it is Persecu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, Hatred, Reproach, Variance, and (as the Sword strictly taken doth signifie) it is Death it self, the Killing of the Body. For
<pb n="136" facs="tcp:37939:71"/>
It follows, <hi>For I am come to set a man at Va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riance against his Father, and the Daughter against her Mother; and a mans foes shall be they of his own house.</hi> And such foes they are that Kill the Body: as we find a little after this in these Words, <hi>He that loseth his Life for my sake shall find it.</hi> And as appears by those a little before our Text, vers. 28. <hi>Fear not them that Kill the Body:</hi> And vers. 21. <hi>Brother shall deliver up Brother to Death.</hi> The whole discourse is of Perfecutions, which should arise by reason of the word of Christ which is Disciples were to Preach and pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fess openly; of evil which they should suf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fer upon the account of their Religion. Wherefore when our Saviour says he <hi>sends</hi> this Sword, he only means that it will <hi>come</hi> upon his account. And whereas he expect<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed tranquillity and great earthly prosperity from him (he being the King that was to Rule; whose Kingdom also they thought should be like other Princes, with external pomp and dominion, Chap, 18. 1. <hi>Act.</hi> 1. 6.) he faithfully tells them afore hand the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary, that they shall meet with many trou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bles, to the end they might be armed against them.

And how is it possible to understand any other coming than this by those other words which you cite, <hi>God hath sent me, I am come a Light into the World?</hi> As well may you understand these words also of God's sending him, and his coming into the world before his incarnation, <hi>God sent his Son in the likeness of Sinful Flesh. In the fulness of time God sent forth his Son made of a Woman. I am come forth from the Father, and am come into the World. To this end was I Born, and for this end came I into the World.</hi> For thus lie the words, speaking plainly of a sending and coming <hi>lately</hi> into the World, and such a send<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing and coming as that he had a <hi>Mouth</hi> to speak with to Mens Ears: Joh. 12. 44. <hi>He that believeth on me, believeth not on me, but on him that sent me. I am come a Light into the World, that whosoever believeth on me, should not abide in darkness. And if any man hear my words and believe not, I judge him not: for I came not to judge the World, but to save
<pb n="139" facs="tcp:37939:72"/>
the World.</hi> (And when was this?) <hi>The word that I have spoken, the same shall judge him in the last day. For I have not spoken of my self; but the Father which sent me, he gave me a commandment, what I should say.</hi> (2) This coming of Christ at <hi>Jerusalem</hi> being only spok<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>en of, in respect of <hi>this alone</hi> must he there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore be understood when he saith in the same place, <hi>If I had not come, they had had no Sin?</hi> And to your enquiry, was there no Sin before, I answer there was. But if you put the question as you ought to do, had not <hi>these Jews</hi> had Sin if Christ had not come in his Body and so spoken unto <hi>them</hi> and done his works among them? the Text would have answered you, <hi>they had not.</hi> Which is not to be taken <hi>absolutly</hi> (as you take it, saying, if Christ had not come a Light into the World before in the hearts of men, then indeed there had been no Sin at all. Which is another false interpretation of yours.) but <hi>compara<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tively,</hi> They (those Jews that heard Christ's Doctrine and saw his Miracles, and yet be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieved not, nor repented) had not had Sin in comparison of what now they have; their Sin had been less, they had been more excu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sable. Which sense is manifest from those Words in the Text, <hi>But now have they no Cloak for their Sin.</hi> For if they will not see when they have the clearest Light, nor believe
<pb n="140" facs="tcp:37939:73"/>
when they have multitude of miracles, nor repent when they have the best instruction, what can they plead for themselves? And in like manner we had not had Sin, if the Gos<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pel had not come unto us: our Sin would not have had those aggravations which now it hath, it being now the abuse of far greater Grace.</p>

But there is not a necessity upon Water-Baptism, and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore it was not Water-Baptism, but the Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritual Baptism, which was an effect of the Gospel which is the power of God, which the Disciples Preached. — The Disciples obeyed this command, when they Mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stred the Spirit and turned men from dark<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness to light.

(1) <hi>Water-Baptism</hi> is meant in that command of our Saviour, <hi>Mat.</hi> 28. and <hi>Mark.</hi> 16. For with <hi>Water</hi> the <hi>Apostles</hi> to whom the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mand was given, Baptized, and in all places, and all <hi>sorts</hi> of persons, both Jews and Gen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiles, and the very <hi>best</hi> converts: three thou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sand Jews that repented at St. <hi>Peter's</hi> Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon and gladly received the word, <hi>Act.</hi> 2. Men and Women of <hi>Samaria, Simon Magus,</hi> and the <hi>Eunuch</hi> of <hi>Ethiopia,</hi> Chap. 8. <hi>Paul,</hi> Chap. 9. <hi>Cornelius</hi> &amp; his company, Chap. 10. <hi>Lydia.</hi> and her houshold, and the Jailor and his.

Now what necessity was there, or what reason, that the Apostles did thus <hi>constantly</hi> Baptize <hi>all sorts</hi> of proselytes, the most <hi>Holy</hi> and the most <hi>Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect</hi> not excepted, and yet add, those that did not <hi>desire</hi> it of them, if they did it not in <hi>obedience</hi> to Christ's <hi>cammand?</hi> And if they might altogether <hi>forbear,</hi> why said <hi>Peter</hi> thus, <hi>Can any forbid Water, that these should not be Baptized which have received the Holy Ghost as well as we?</hi> And why <hi>commanded</hi> he them to be Baptized? <hi>Act.</hi> 10. And why did he not forbear, when he knew that to Baptize these Gentiles would give <hi>offence</hi> (as it did) to his Bethren of the <hi>circumcision? vers.</hi> 28. 34, 35. <hi>Chap,</hi> 11. 2. 3. And especially why did
<pb n="142" facs="tcp:37939:74"/>
he not forbear for a <hi>season,</hi> till he had <hi>satisfied</hi> his Brethren by certifying them of his <hi>Vision?</hi> For might not such as you have said, what <hi>need</hi> of <hi>Water</hi> whilst they <hi>Believe</hi> and have received the <hi>Holy Ghost?</hi> what <hi>command<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment</hi> is there for it? what <hi>offence</hi> would be given to any, if this <hi>arbitrary</hi> Ceremony were omitted? which if they had said, you see who would have <hi>reproved</hi> them, as is manifest by his words. Add we further, and <hi>just</hi> as it is in our Saviour's <hi>command, so</hi> the Apostles <hi>practised</hi> in their Water-Baptism. Which is an indication that what they did was in <hi>execution</hi> of that command, and therefore that Water-Baptism is there meant. For as he said, <hi>Preach</hi> the Gospel, and them that <hi>Believe</hi> Baptize: so we find they <hi>Preach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed</hi> and required <hi>Faith</hi> before they Baptized. Act. 8. 12. <hi>When they Believed</hi> Philip <hi>Preach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the things concerning the Kingdom of God, and the name of Jesus Christ, they were Baptiz<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed.</hi> Vers. 35. Philip <hi>Preached Jesus unto the</hi> Eunuch: <hi>and the</hi> Eunuch <hi>said, see here is Water, what doth hinder me to be Baptized? And</hi> Philip <hi>said, if thou Believest with all thy heart thou mayest. And he answered, I be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve that Jesus Christ is the Son of God. And they went down into the Water, and</hi> Philip <hi>Bap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tized him.</hi> Further, they Baptized such (both Jews and Gentiles) with Water as had
<pb n="143" facs="tcp:37939:74"/>
been Baptized with the <hi>Holy Ghost,</hi> and that as that signifies either <hi>Sanctification</hi> or other <hi>gifts</hi> of the Holy Ghost: as appears in the former instances, <hi>Act.</hi> 2. 37, 41. &amp; 8. 12. 37, 38. &amp; 9. 15, 18. &amp; 10. 47, 48. And if they did not thus upon the account of Christ's <hi>com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mand,</hi> you must produce some Scripture which tells you <hi>another reason</hi> why they did it. But if you can produce no such Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, then it is sure that Water-Baptism was meant in that command. For when they ordeined that the Gentiles should abstain from <hi>Meats</hi> offered to Idols, and from <hi>Blood</hi> and things <hi>Strangled,</hi> the reason is assigned, <hi>Act.</hi> 15. 21. And so likewise is it, when <hi>Paul. Circumcised Timothy,</hi> and when again he <hi>pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rified</hi> himself with others, <hi>Act.</hi> 16. 3. &amp; 21. 20. <hi>&amp;c.</hi> Finally, whereas St. <hi>Paul</hi> says, 1 Cor. 1. <hi>Christ sent me not to Baptize but to Preach,</hi> it implies that he did send <hi>others</hi> to Baptize whom he also sent to Preach. And moreo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver he speaking there of Baptizing <hi>Gentiles,</hi> to what <hi>mission</hi> can his words relate but to <hi>this,</hi> where we find the Gentiles expressed, <hi>Go teach all Nations, Baptizing them?</hi> especially con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sidering it was to the <hi>other</hi> Apostles that Christ spake those words, St. <hi>Paul</hi> at that time being not chosen into the number, and that when he was chosen it was not so said to <hi>him</hi> as it was to <hi>them, Preach</hi> and <hi>Bap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tize,</hi>
               <pb n="144" facs="tcp:37939:75"/>
but only, <hi>Preach, Act.</hi> 9. &amp; 22. &amp; 26. 16. <hi>&amp;c.</hi> And that he speaks there of <hi>Water<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>Baptism,</hi> is evident, and you grant it, alledg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the same words frequently against the necessity of it. Wherefore according to St. <hi>Paul</hi> Water-Baptism was intended by our Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viour in that command to his Apostles. And thus having proved this, I need not prove the <hi>necessity</hi> of it unto <hi>Salvation,</hi> and that hereby men were Baptized <hi>into the name</hi> of the Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, Son and Holy Ghost; forasmuch as the Text asserts both, as your selves grant of that Baptism whereof it speaks, which I have proved to be the Water-Baptism. But yet because these are the reasons why you can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not believe this external Baptism to be there meant, I will proceed to shew the invalidity of them. And therefore (2) I assert contra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry to you, that by <hi>water</hi> men were Baptized <hi>into the name</hi> of Christ (or, <hi>unto,</hi> 
               <gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap>, as it is said, 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 10. 2. <hi>All our Fathers were Bap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tized</hi> 
               <gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap>, <hi>unto Moses.</hi>) This I prove from the following Texts. 1 Cor. 1. 13. <hi>Were ye Baptized into the name of</hi> Paul? The answer must be, we were not, but into <hi>Christ's</hi> name. Vers. 14, 15. <hi>I thank God I Baptiz<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed none of you but</hi> Crispus <hi>and</hi> Gaius, <hi>lest any should say I Baptized into my own name.</hi> To think so was amiss. And why, but because they were Baptized only into the name of
<pb n="145" facs="tcp:37939:75"/>
               <hi>Christ?</hi> As then it was into Christ's name they were Baptized, so is it as manifest that it was by <hi>water:</hi> for he <hi>thanks</hi> God (by rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son of their quarrels) that he Baptized so few of them: which he would not have done, if he had meant the <hi>Spiritual</hi> Baptism. And of the same Baptism he speaks again those words, vers. 17. <hi>Christ sent me not to Baptize, but to Preach:</hi> which you your selves un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derstand of Water-Baptism. Again, from <hi>Act.</hi> 19. 5. <hi>VVhen they heard this, they were Baptized into the name of the Lord Jesus.</hi> Which is the same Baptism that they had received before by <hi>John,</hi> and therefore with <hi>water:</hi> there being only this difference, <hi>John's</hi> was that they should believe on him that should come after him, the person being not named, vers, 4. (for those words, <hi>that is on Jesus Christ,</hi> are St. <hi>Paul's:</hi>) but this was un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to Jesus Christ expresly named. And besides, the <hi>Spiritual</hi> Baptism (which, according to your own words, is the falling of the Holy Ghost upon others by the Ministry of the A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>postles) <hi>followed</hi> this. As we read in the next verse: <hi>And when Paul had laid his hands up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on them, the Holy Ghost came on them, and they spake with Tongues and Prophesied.</hi> Again, <hi>Act.</hi> 1. 16, 17. <hi>As yet the Holy Ghost was fallen on none of them: only they were Baptized into the name of the Lord Jesus.</hi> That it was with
<pb n="146" facs="tcp:37939:76"/>
water is manifest in that <hi>Simon Magus</hi> was one of them that were Baptized, vers. 13. and he being yet in the <hi>bond</hi> of <hi>Iniquity,</hi> had not received the <hi>Spiritual</hi> Baptism, vers. 2. 3. And <hi>Philip</hi> it was that Baptized them, vers. 12. who, as we read vers. 38. Baptized with <hi>water,</hi> where again it is manifest, that as it was with Water he Baptized the Eunuch, so it was <hi>into the name</hi> of Christ. For he making <hi>profession</hi> that Jesus Christ was the Son of God, <hi>Philip</hi> Baptized him. Which must needs signifie that he Baptized him <hi>unto</hi> the same <hi>Jesus,</hi> or unto his <hi>name,</hi> which is all one, as you may see by vers. 12. <hi>Rom.</hi> 6. 3. <hi>Gal,</hi> 3. 27. (3) I assert contrary to you, and prove, that Water-Baptism was <hi>necessary unto Salvation, viz.</hi> in that sort as the Text ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>presses it: Mar. 16. 15, 16. <hi>Go into all the World and Preach unto every Creature. He that Believeth and is Baptized, shall be Saved.</hi> Which requires that those which embrace the Gospel, do solemnly by the rite of Baptism <hi>declare</hi> so much, and that they are Christ's <hi>Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sciples,</hi> and that they will <hi>openly profess</hi> him and it, and that by this rite they be <hi>admit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted</hi> for his Disciples unto this <hi>publick</hi> profes<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sion. That this is the meaning of Baptizing and being Baptized into his name, appears from Scripture. Act. 19. 4, 5. John <hi>Baptiz<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, saying unto the People that they should be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve
<pb n="147" facs="tcp:37939:76"/>
on him which should come after him, that is, on Christ Jesus. When they heard this, they were Baptized into the name of the Lord Jesus.</hi> Which must needs signifie unto the profession of him. Joh. 4. 1. <hi>Jesus made and Baptized more Disciples than</hi> John: <gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap>; made them Disciples by his Preaching, and converted them unto his Doctrine, and then admitted them by Bap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tism as Disciples unto the publick profession of himself and it. Which is the same with our Text, <gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap>, <hi>Disciple, and Baptize.</hi> 1 Cor. 1. 14, 15. <hi>I thank God I Baptized none of you but</hi> Crispus <hi>and</hi> Gaius, <hi>lest any should say I Baptized into my own name. i. e,</hi> Since some of you say they are <hi>of Paul</hi> (vers. 12.) I am glad I have Baptized so few of you as I have, lest any should think (as they might the rather if I had Baptized many) that I intended to gather <hi>Disciples</hi> unto <hi>my self,</hi> as if the Doctrine were mine. Baptism then into Christ's name signifying admission of Disciples unto publick profession of his Person and his Religion, I hope you will not denie that thus to do is necessary, as if it were sufficient to <hi>Believe</hi> in the <hi>heart:</hi> espe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cially when you remember it is said, <hi>With the heart man Believeth unto Rightcousness, and with the Mouth Confession is made unto Salvation.</hi> And, <hi>whosoever shall confess me
<pb n="148" facs="tcp:37939:77"/>
before men, him will I confess before my Father which is in Heaven. But whosoever shall deny me before men, him will I deny before my Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther which is in Heaven.</hi> And that those chief Rulers were in danger enough, that <hi>be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieved</hi> on Christ, but because of the Phari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sees durst not <hi>confess</hi> him, lest they should be put out of the Synagogue, loving the praise of men more than the praise of God, <hi>Joh.</hi> 12. Faith then is the necessary <hi>intrinsick</hi> thing, and Baptism the necessary <hi>extrinsick</hi> unto Sal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vation. Therefore is it said, <hi>Repent and be Baptized every one of you in the name of Jesus for the Remission of Sins: And they were Bap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tized,</hi> Act. 2. And again, <hi>Why tarriest thou? Arise and be Baptized and wash away thy Sins, calling on the name of the Lord: And he arose and was Baptized,</hi> Act. 22. &amp; 9. And it is manifest that <hi>VVater-Baptism</hi> is here meant, for that it is said, be Baptized, and they were Baptized. Why tarriest thou? Arise and be Baptized. He arose and was Baptized. For what necessity of <hi>arising</hi> to be Baptized with the <hi>Spirit?</hi> and how could it depend on mans <hi>will,</hi> as this did, <hi>Ananias</hi> being <hi>ready</hi> and having in his <hi>power</hi> to Baptize him <hi>when<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever</hi> he would <hi>go</hi> with him, or <hi>say</hi> he should Baptize him? Wherefore Water-Baptism is spoken of in Scripture as necessary unto Sal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vation, it signifying publick profession of
<pb n="149" facs="tcp:37939:77"/>
Christ, and it being for the remission of sins. <q>

And I would have you con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sider, whether <hi>common vitious</hi> Persons that neither propagate nor hold <hi>Errors</hi> and Here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sies, nor <hi>persecute</hi> and offer injuries to the Church, are called in the Scripture <hi>Anti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>christ.</hi> But albeit you say the Beast is the Will, and Antichrist is not any particular per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son or persons, yet I find one of you, and he a great man, contradicting, telling us plainly that the <hi>Pope</hi> is the Beast and the Antichrist. <hi>G.

Here is the Beast with his many names, the many Antichrists.</hi> Seeing then some of you say the Beast is the Will, some the Pope: some that Antichrist is not any particular per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sons, some that he is the Pope with his Jesu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>its, Priests and Friars, I had best stop here till you are agreed. And truly, may some say,
<pb n="159" facs="tcp:37939:82"/>
you might have stopped long ago, and even have spared all your pains, for any hope you can have of convincing them who esteem themselves infallible, they knowing the shame of Recantation, and what injury it will be to their Credit, and what dammage to their Party. But I am not altogether without hope. For who knows what the Lord may do? However, my Labour may not be in vain to some of their Followers, who scarce believe what the Doctors so confidently boast of themselves. And especially may it con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duce to prevent the lapse of others, who by reason of their glorious pretence are smit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten with some admiration of their persons and their way.</p>
            <p>Besides the instances which I have given of your false Interpretations, I can produce near Forty more which I have observed in reading a few of your books. By which any one may perceive what sad work you make with the Scriptures. But these may suffice, to shew that you are far from doing accord<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to what you affirm of your selves, as in the beginning I cited your own words: viz. <hi>That you dare not make use of Scripture but as the Spirit opens; dare not speak the words of Scripture in your own Spirit, but tie them to the Spirit so as not to use them but by the Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit; do not Interpret Scripture by the fallible
<pb n="160" facs="tcp:37939:83"/>
mind; the things which you write, you receiv<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed by the Revelation of Jesus Christ, and you are not fallible.</hi> For certainly they that pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tend no more than the ordinary divine assi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stance, could not have erred more grosly than you have done. I wish with all my heart that you had more of the Spirit, and that you were Prophets indeed, that we might have more Truth, and need not spend our time in correcting follies. And admo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nish you in the Lord, that you make your humble and ardent supplications for wisdom to him that giveth and upbraideth not: And that withal you labour and search for her as for hid Treasure, and despise not the light which Godhath set up in any; who hath va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riously distributed his gifts, as he hath the members of our Body, for mutual assistance. Seeing your failings, watch against them, and take more heed, and amend. To ascribe a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny thing that is false to the Holy Ghost, you know is wicked impudence, and of the worst consequence, the Prophane and Atheistical being the more tempted hereby to believe there is no such Divine power. How hor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rid is it to say that Spirit lies? How nigh to which you come by asserting him to be the Author of your errors, in your seriousness consider. If I have erred, I have erred as a man: and yet I think and know I have the
<pb n="161" facs="tcp:37939:83"/>
Spirit of God, and for all the World would not be without it. It would do well since you say you are Prophets like them of old, sent from the Lord immediately and guided infallibly, that you tell us in all your writings distinctly what the Lord saith, and what you say of your selves. As St. <hi>Paul</hi> gave notice when he spake his own judgment, saying, <hi>This say I, not the Lord: This not I, but the Lord,</hi> 1 Cor. 7. 6. 12. 25, 26, 40. And so much I expect of him, that shall reply to what I have written, and that in every particular, that I may know with whom I have to do: <hi>viz.</hi> that he say, I have received by inspiration this Interpretation: but this I have not, but deliver it according to my best judgment. Or else declare apertly, that you write nothing at all but what you have by inspiration. I admonish further, that if you believe the Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly Ghost did not intend that sense in which you use the words of Scripture, you plainly and honestly declare so much. But then re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flect, whether it be not better to let the Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures stand in that sense which the Holy Ghost hath given them: lest every one using this liberty, they come at last to signifie just no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing, but like the Air be blown hither and thither with every breath as every one pleas<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth, and be turned into all shapes like a piece of soft wax. Think not that to inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pret
<pb n="162" facs="tcp:37939:84"/>
mystically is profound wisdom, and ought to be admired of the People. For a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lass they that are weakest are aptest to this, and hither they fly when the Letter is too hard for them. And take heed especially of thinking your selves spiritual because you talk spiritually: as knowing that none are so, but who are born of the Spirit, and walk according to it; who are Holy in their Life, and holy in their Nature. Which they that turn the Letter into Spirit may be as far from, as the Swinish Adulterers, and the Rude Swearers.</p>
            <p>And now because I know not whether I shall speak to you any more, take that serious word which I have sometime had in my mind to dispence to you. Which is this: Insist on the particular duties of a Christian man, and deliver them with all perspicuity of speech; as knowing they are not to be practised in Phraseology and pure mystical notion. Cry not out against Ministers for taking of Tithes, calling them for this cause Hirelings and Wolves, Covetous Balaams, Deceivers, and Antichrist's: since you see such walk sober<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, righteously, and godly, and seek the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>version of Sinners, and would part with their Estates and Sacrifice their Lives for the sake of Christ: Since you know that it is false Doctrine, pernicious errors and heresies,
<pb n="163" facs="tcp:37939:84"/>
which makes the false Prophet; and this may be, and is found in them that take no Tithes, and in them that decry them; and they that do receive them, may be ortho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dox, and are so; and have not the tempta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion to corrupt the truth for the pleasing of men that they might receive the more from them, like as others have that live upon the bounty: Since again you know that there are hundreds of these Tith-takers which would exchange their ten or twenty pounds a year for the maintenance of your Preach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers, who ride about and work not with their hands. You that plead the Apostles exam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ples, consider whether they who forsook all and followed Christ, turned Merchants, kept Shops, constantly traded in the World, sought after Riches, as many of your Preachers do. You that condemn a Lace and the Fashions of the World, should remember your bands that are broader than an Inch, your Cloaks that cover not the Breast, with Capes that are of no use, your Gowns, Hoods and Scarves, your Borders and Periwigs, your Coloured Garments, Died by mans Invention. You that plead the Spirit, consider whether the manner of your writings signifie inspiration, when we see exultation, exasperation, carp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing playing upon words, contention about matters of no moment, poor flashes of wit,
<pb n="164" facs="tcp:37939:85"/>
quibbling and evasion, obscurity and imper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinence, and abundance of ill names poured forth without cause and provocation. You that speak so much of the Law and Christ the light within, should understand that all our knowledge is so, in our Souls, which are not in our Bibles, but in our Bodies: and no man ever thought that Ink fashioned into Letters, can instruct him that cannot read for want of learning, or for want of eyes, For what is the Bible in Hebrew and Greek Cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>racters to them that know only English? know ye therefore what you talk of? I would have you consider again, what knowledge the World would have had, what Nations had been Converted, how the Gospel and King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom of Christ had been propagated, if he and his Apostles and others had not spoken and written, and men had not heard ard read: or what we should come to within two ages, if we should all shut our eyes, and stop our ears, and tie up our tongues. Yet say I with you, Christ is within, and Christ is light. Next I admonish and beseech you to bear others burdens, and to help their infirmities, and to know your own. For we are not perfect, neither we, nor you. Lay aside all bitterness of Spirit and censorious judging, scoffes and jeers, pride and haughtiness, strife and vain jangling, wrath and clamor, love of the world
<pb n="165" facs="tcp:37939:85"/>
and greedy pursuit after it, unjust gains and base contrivances, dissimulation, lying, back<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>biting, contumelies, and false accusations, all excess and intemperance, voluptuousness and drunkenness, lasciviousness, uncleanness, fornication and adultery. Speak without ambiguity; seek not the praise of men; re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive instruction and hearken to reproof. Pray in your Families, and Pray in the name of the Lord Jesus, and Pray for the pardon of your Sins. Give thanks at your Meals: Instruct your Children: Love your Enemies: Render to every man his due: follow peace: Make not the Kingdom of God Meat and Drink, the Hat and a Lace; and cast off all superstitions. Search the Scriptures, and read them with diligence. The fruits and effects of the Death of Christ part not with: That Blood remember which he offered; that Death of the Cross Preach which he suf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fered, whereby he made atonement and ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teined eternal redemption for us. And firm<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly believe the Resurrection of the Dead at the last day. For if they rise not, <hi>What doth it advantage me,</hi> says St. <hi>Paul, that I have Fought with Beasts at</hi> Ephesus? <hi>and why stand we in jeopardy every hour?</hi> 1 Cor. 15. And what I say to you, I say to all: Abstein from those abominable Sins, which dishonour our Christian Religion, provoke our gracious God,
<pb n="166" facs="tcp:37939:86"/>
and Damn mens Souls everlastingly. And with all your might pursue the other Righ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teous things and whatsoever else is divine and praise worthy. The Lord Jesus be with your Spirits, <hi>Amen.</hi>
