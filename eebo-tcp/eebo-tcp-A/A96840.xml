            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

               </l>
               <l>And was by many thouſands made appeare:</l>

                  <hi>James Fiſher,</hi> living neare to <hi>Brummingham,</hi>

               <l>So prone unto ambition he was ſet,</l>

               <l>For which Eronious grand Opinions be</l>
               <l>Was lull'd aſleepe by Sathans policy.</l>
               <l>Which in a Mortall ſhape he did appeare,</l>
               <l>And call'd him out as after you ſhall heare:</l>
               <l>Though the Phrenatick he imagin'd then</l>
               <l>It had been of his owne Bretheren,</l>
               <l>And ſo Diſcourſed as along they paſt,</l>
               <l>But it prov'd to be the Divell at the laſt,</l>
               <l>Which did direct him by a Wood to ſtand,</l>
               <l>And there Diſputed with him hand to hand.</l>
               <l>The Divell then his Goſpell ſo diſplay'd,</l>
               <l>The Phrenatick yeelded ſtill to what he ſaid.</l>
               <l>But marke before that ever they departed,</l>
               <l>By that ſame Devill he was quite Converted:</l>

            <p>THe Twelfth or Thirteenth of this Inſtant <hi>February,</hi> this ſaid <hi>Iames Fiſher</hi> being reputed for an arch and ſeditious Fellow a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mong the Sectaries and factious people, which for many yeares had refrained the Churches and denied the Pariſh publique Congrega<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions, which late hath caus'd him to be the Object of the Countrey; His mind and inclination was wholy bent to keepe their Corre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpondency and Confederacy in ſecret houſe, but chiefely and eſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cially in nightly private Meetings, but the Devill met with him at laſt, as you will heare by the ſtory: This <hi>Fiſher</hi> as it is credita<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble reported by ſeverall of that Countrey people which came late<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly to Towne, that on the 12th of <hi>February</hi> at night hee was prepa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring to go forth, and deſigned for a Meeting in a lone houſe under a Wood ſide Two miles and an halfe from his owne houſe, where the Sect were uſually wont to meet, as the Countrey tearm'd it like the Witches of <hi>Lancaſhire,</hi> hee heard a Voyce call three times in this manner, <hi>Come away, come away, come away;</hi> At which he an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwered

The Devill replyed, trouble not thy ſelf I will make thee hot by and by we will ſweat by turnes, and though I am cold if thou cleaveſt to me thou ſhalt like fire burne; Yet the Capacity of this Phrenatick being ſo weake could not un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtand his Deviliſh Myſtery, but ſtill complaineth of his hard march, which indeed he had no ſmall reaſon for it, for often times he was lifted ſo up above the ground in an Acres breadth together, which made him conjecture hee walked at no ordinary rate; Hee was carried over the tops of Thorny hedges, and through the bows of thicke Mauple trees, but not a whit diſtruſtfull but that hee had been on the plaine Land; Yet ſtill he rebuked the Devill and told him, hee had a ſhroud ſuſpicion that hee led him in the wrong way, for quoth he, thou leadſt me through nothing but brambles and bri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers. Why yes quoth the Devill, the wayes of the righteous is to ſuffer Afflictions, is to paſs through ſtraight and craggy places.

Truly ſaid the Phanatick, I am no Philoſopher but according to an old Proverb we have, <hi>When the wind is ſo high 'tis a ſigne it will raine;</hi> But this is ſuch wind as if the Devill was abroad, and upon this they arrived at the place: The Phanatick like to a weather beaten Spaniell, moſt durty and wet and in a totter'd condition, which the Devill perceived began this Argument. Brother ſaid he, thou doſt looke now like an afflicted Catiffe. How can I chuſe anſwered the Phanatick, for I ſeeme like one as had beene in the hands of the Devill, yet little did he think it had been him all this while, and therefore he oppos'd the Devill in this manner. Friend ſaid he, before wee diſpute demonſtrate unto me what is thy name. Why anſwered the Devill, doſt thou queſtion me ſo high, who am ſo generally knowne amongſt all your Congregations for the prime inſtigator and promotor of your Actions? But nevertheleſſe wee will not differ in judgement, and therefore my name is <hi>Robin Good fellow;</hi> At which his Countenance alwayes was changeable, but be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing but a dusky and glimering light, the Phanaticke ſuppoſed hee had but jeſted, told him the Devill was a Lyer from the beginning, and therefore imagined hee would bee alſo, yet there's many a true word ſpoake in jeſt you'l ſay. But nevertheleſſe they waved this and ſo proceeded, quoth the Phanatick, wee two ſhall never agree except thou canſt refraine the Church, deny the Congregations, raiſe up Sectaries and prohibit the Clergy if you can. Aye if I can ſaid the Devill, there thou ſaiſt true, but if I ſhould refraine the Church where ſhould I be to make confuſion in't, and if I ſhould deny the Congregations how ſhould I raiſe new Religions? under which pretended Zeale I doe raiſe up new Sectaries, thereupon my
<pb n="4" facs="tcp:169364:4"/>friend I muſt needs confute thee, and as for the Clergie they are guarded with the thing called <hi>the Goſpell,</hi> we muſt diſpute with them at the ſtaffes point, although I cannot ſay but my conſtant labour is to advance your Intereſts upon the ruines of their Liberties. At which anſwered the Phrenatick, thoſe are the things we are aiming at, ſo that if thou canſt throw thy ſub<gap reason="illegible" resp="#UOM" extent="1 letter">

And ſecondly, You muſt prey into the hearts of the Vulgar, therby you ſhall make your Flock the more numerous. Thirdly, You muſt expreſſe your ſelves (though with a counterfeit Explication) and tell them you have the Spirit of Revelation, teach them in ſecret corners, ſeduce them to fields and publique places, tell them you are Prophets, if they will not believe you, throw off your Garments and run naked, ſhew them how you walke in the paths of humility, and then they will believe you are Saints indeed, ſeeing you are neither prone to Ambition nor Honour: Then being numerous you may eaſily di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſturb mighty Congregations, breed mutinies in great Cities, and if you lay downe your lives for the cauſe I'le receive yee. Hold ſaid the Phrenatick, let me know what's become of thoſe that layd down their lives already.

Let it paſſe ſaid the De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vill, 'tis but one for the 'tother, but if you will effect the enterpriſe of your Ambition, you muſt follow my Counſell and perſiſt in my Doctrine. Nay hold ſaid the Phrenatick, if we preach all thy Doctrine ſome will aver wee take counſell from the Devill: The Devils countenance all this while was enterchangeable, which made
