         <editorialDecl>
            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            <p>For in the firſt place I found that to be tru, which I had fore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>told, that <hi>Lily</hi> would, if my <hi>Vindiciae</hi> ever came to his hands, put off all in the ſame manner, as he had all other before, whom he was pleaſed to take notice of, that had written ought againſt himſelfe, or his Trade, with a few ſcurrilous Jeers; and juſt ſo he doth here; to wit, in theſe termes, <hi>An impudent Pamphlet

ſtomackful words onelie, whereas in the other there is a charge with particular matter of fact. Had this Railer therefore kept himſelf within this compaſs, and contented him with ſuch general, baſe, and foul terms, I ſhould never have troubled either my ſelf with writing, or anie other with reading theſe lines.

            <p>For example, <hi>All I write on</hi> Jer. 10. 2. he ſaith, <hi>I prov by</hi> Strabo, Lucian, Plinie, <hi>and</hi> Cicero; whereas of <hi>Lucian</hi> I have not anie one word there; the other three I cite joyntlie, onelie to ſhew, <hi>That Aſtrologers were ancientlie termed Chaldeans;</hi> and <hi>Plinie</hi> apart, to ſhew, <hi>What antiqitie of obſervation the Heathen Diviners</hi> pretended for their <hi>ſuperstitious divinati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons by the flight of fouls, and from the bowels of beasts; That in my</hi> Vindication <hi>I qote</hi> Lucian, <hi>a Scoffer:</hi> But to what purpoſe? To prov ought in controverſie by him? No. But to ſhew, That an <hi>Impoſtor</hi> in his times uſed the like ſhifts that <hi>Li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lie</hi> now doth, tho in ſome kind more wiſelie, and warilie then he. But <hi>I qote</hi> alſo there, <hi>two Logger-headed Grammarians and Heathens.</hi> If his meaning be <hi>in ſenſu compoſito,</hi> that thoſe two <hi>Grammarians</hi> were <hi>Heathens,</hi> it is falſ; they were both Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtians, tho they lived in an obſcure and corrupt age. But what do I cite them for? To ſhew, that they were ſounder, coneurring therein with the learned of other, and better ages, in the notation of ſome words, and diſtinction of ſome terms, then ſome of <hi>Lilies Patrons, and Advocates;</hi> and the more ſhame then for them, profeſſing much learning, and charging others with igno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rance, to come ſhort in ſuch pettie matters of ſuch <hi>Logger-head<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed Grammarians,</hi> as their <hi>Client</hi> ſaith they were. Or, if he mean <hi>in ſenſu diviſo,</hi> that I qote other <hi>Autors,</hi> that ar <hi>pure Heathens</hi> (as elſwhere he ſaith of <hi>Strabo</hi> and <hi>Cicero) against Aſtrologie.</hi> I might demand of him, Whether <hi>Strabo</hi> and <hi>Cice<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ro</hi> ar more <hi>pure Heathen,</hi> or anie that I qote <hi>againſt Aſtrolo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gie,</hi> then <hi>Thales</hi> and <hi>Solon,</hi> whom his <hi>Advocate</hi> qotes for it; or whether <hi>Hermes, Proclus, Plotinus, Ptolomie, Albumazar,

I <hi>qote Heathen Autors</hi> indeed; but to what purpoſe? To ſhew, that the wiſer ſort even among the Heathen diſcovered the vanitie and follie of this pretended skil: As <hi>Clemens, Auguſtine,</hi> and others of the Ancients, produce the like, to ſhew, that the wiſer ſort of them diſavowed the multipli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>citie of their counterfeit Deities. Yea, but <hi>I play the fool in pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ducing the judgment of men diſaffected to the point in qeſtion.</hi> Not, I hope, when I produce them to prov, that they ar not all ſuch ſillie <hi>Ignoramuſſes,</hi> as <hi>Lilie</hi> and his <hi>Advocate</hi> would bear the world in hand, that tax his trade, and that it is not out of meer ignorance that they diſallow and condemn it; unleſs he can prov, that they ar all alſo ſuch <hi>Logger-heads,</hi> as he ſaith thoſe two were.</p>
            <p>But in all theſe particulars thus ſpecified, and here carped at, there is nothing of much moment, nor ought that contains in it anie matter of ſcandal.

            <p>To this purpoſe, before I came to <hi>Lincolns Inn,</hi> while I lodged in the Houſe of that Religious Knight, my worthy Friend and Kinſman, Sir <hi>William Cook,</hi> neer to <hi>Charing-Croſs,</hi> being re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>qeſted to Preach now and then at <hi>Martins</hi> in the <hi>Fields,</hi> and ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving taken notice how the Gentrie, manie of them thereabout ſpent much of the <hi>Lords day</hi> in <hi>Complemental Viſitations,</hi> I took occaſion one day, out of <hi>Iſa.</hi> 58. 13. to handle the Doctrine of the <hi>Sabbath</hi> or <hi>Lords day;</hi> and among other things endeavored to ſhew, That it was not to be ſpent in ſuch <hi>Civil Complements,</hi> but in <hi>Religious Imployments.</hi> And this I remember the rather by a

good token, which it wil not be amiſs to relate. It fel out the Lords day, next enſuing,, that an ancient Gentlewoman, one of that Congregation, being returned home from the Afternoon Exerciſe, while ſhe ſat in an upper Room, ripping off ſome Lace from an old Garment, which ſhe intended to make uſe of otherwiſe, heard a Coach to make ſtay on the other ſide of the ſtreet, and looking out at the Window to ſee whoſe it was, when ſhe eſpied a Ladie her Neece, whom it ſtaid for, entring it, to go abroad in it for ſuch purpoſe. <hi>Oh,</hi> qoth ſhe, to her waiting Maid, then at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tending upon her, <hi>did not my Neece</hi> N. <hi>hear Mr.</hi> G. <hi>the laſt Lords day, and is ſhe now going out to viſit again.</hi> Whereupon one of that Familie afterward occaſionallie meeting me, thus merrilie ſaluted me, <hi>Sir, when you Preach next of the Sabbath, be pleaſed to tel our Gentlewomen, that they muſt not <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

            <p>At my coming to <hi>Lincolns Inn,</hi> there was on the <hi>Lords day</hi> one <hi>Lecture</hi> onelie at <hi>ſeven</hi> in the <hi>morning,</hi> nor had there been anie other before. There being ſetled ſome ſpace of time, when I obſerved that divers of the great practiſers ſpent a great, if not the greateſt part of the day, the Afternoon eſpeciallie, in <hi>entertain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing</hi> of their <hi>Clients,</hi> I took occaſion in my teaching, to ſtep a little aſide out of the road I was then in, to ſpeak ſomewhat of that ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject, endeavoring to ſhew them, <hi>That it was as lawful for the Husbandman to hedg and ditch, or to folow his Tillage on that day, as for the Lawyer to employ it in conſulting with, and attending his Clients.</hi> And I preſſed the point ſo far, that through the good hand of God, going along with it, and carrying home his own Ordinance to the hearts of the hearers; it made ſo deep an impreſſion upon them, that upon a motion made by ſome of the cheif ones at the next meeting after it, a conſultation was had, what courſ might be taken for the future prevention of ſo common and irregular a practiſe: And after advice therein taken with me, it was by common conſent, agreed on, That the <hi>Morning Lecture</hi> on the <hi>Lords day,</hi> ſhould be drawn down to the uſual hour in other places, and the <hi>Wedneſday Lecture</hi> transferred to the <hi>After<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>noon of the Lords day.</hi> Which, howſoever it were a matter of
<pb n="17" facs="tcp:114689:13"/>
much more labor to my ſelf to ſpeak twice in one day (which, as I am informed, in the <hi>French</hi> and <hi>Dutch</hi> Congregations is ſel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom or never done; and ſome of my Succeſſors have complain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed of, and blamed me, for giving way thereunto) and by means thereof I was abbridged of that libertie of hearing others abroad, which I had formerlie enjoyed; yet for the atcheiving of my main ay<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

               </gap> herein, of gaining a more du and diligent obſervance of the day, I right willinglie diſpenſed with mine own eaſe and advan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tages, and condeſcended thereunto. And this was the ground of the alteration of the <hi>Lectures</hi> in that Houſe; which, I ſuppoſe, in that manner, in which, upon this occaſion they were then ſetled, continu ſtil to this day.</p>
            <p>During mine abode at <hi>Lincolns Inn,</hi> the time approaching for my taking the degree of <hi>Batchelor in Divinitie,</hi> I procured a courſ at St. <hi>Maries</hi> in <hi>Cambridge,</hi> for mine <hi>Engliſh Sermon;</hi> the firſt and laſt that I ever preached there, having never had the boldneſs before to appear in that place. This fel out to be the verie next day after Qeen <hi>Elizabeths</hi> deceaſe; which being not known yet at <hi>Cambridge,</hi> the Qeen, as ſtil ſurviving, was at the Forenoon Sermon ſolemnlie prayed for by him that preached that day at <hi>Kings Colledge:</hi> But about Noon the report came down of the Qeen departed this life, and King <hi>James</hi> proclaimed, which cauſed an exceeding great concourſ of people at the After<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>noon Sermon, though it were no <hi>Lords day:</hi> When by advice of the <hi>Vice-Chancelor,</hi> in regard that no publick notice of it was as yet ſent down, I conceived my Petition for the King, in a kind of circumlocution, <hi>For the preſent Supream Governor,</hi> without ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſion of his name: At that branch of my Prayer, the tears trickling down my Cheeks, and ſcarce any one drie eie in the whole <hi>Aſſemblie,</hi> as I was afterward informed.

So ſhould we, after we have heard the Word publickly, confer privatelie of it with others, at leaſt meditate on it by our ſelvs; and be ſure to take an account of our ſelvs, how we have profited that day, by the Word that hath been ſpoken unto us, and by other Religi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous Exerciſes that have been uſed of us. And us the Market<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man counteth that but an evil Market-day, that he hath not gained ſomewhat on, more or leſs; ſo may we wel account it an evil Sabbath to us, whereon we have not profited ſomewhat; whereon we have not either increaſed our knowledge, or been bettered in affection; whereon we have not been further either informed in judgement, or reformed in practiſe; whereon we have added no whit at all to our Talent.</hi> Thus then and there.</p>

               <hi>Here let me more particularlie, as from God, and in Gods Name, entreat you, to have a ſpecial regard of obſerving Gods Sabbaths. You that are to ſee them obſerved by others, ought you not much more to obſerv them your ſelvs?

            <p>
               <hi>And if it be alledged, That the one is (as before was proved indeed) more ſpeciallie Gods work.

            <p>Which parcel of his Charge being of the ſame ſtamp with the

            <p>For, as for the former, King <hi>James</hi> indeed in the year 1618. the Sixteenth of His Reign, publ ſhed a <hi>Declaration,</hi> wherein he gave <hi>Libertie,</hi> for ſome <hi>Disports</hi> that might be uſed on the <hi>Sabbath</hi> or the <hi>Lords day.</hi> But what ones were they, that there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in he gave way to? <hi>Cards and dice? &amp;c.</hi> No: There is not one word or title at all concerning them in the whole Book; but they are expreſly therein named theſe, <hi>Dancings men or women, May-games, Whit ſun-Ales, Morrice-dances, Ruſh-bearings, ſetting up of May-poles, and other ſports therewith uſed.</hi> Theſe ar the <hi>Disports</hi> by name there deſigned, wherewith leav is given and autoritie to ſolemnize and celebrate the Lords day.

Which if it were tru, (for I dare not confidentlie avow it, having it onelie by hear-ſay) the greater and more grievous was the ſin and ſhame of thoſe <hi>great Prelates;</hi> who whither to pleaſe the King and Court, or to croſs, vex, curb, and enſnare the Conſcientious Miniſters; not then onelie approved the practiſe, but long after renewed afreſh the memorie of it, and preſſed his Son King <hi>Charls</hi> to revive it again, and to enjoyn the publiſhing of it by the Miniſters of the Word in their ſeveral places, upon pain of ſuſpenſion; which not a few of them ſuſtained for the refuſal thereof.</p>
            <p>Now in <hi>defence</hi> of this <hi>Declaration,</hi> and in <hi>juſtification</hi> of ſuch <hi>Sports</hi> uſed on the <hi>Sabbath,</hi> whereas this <hi>Lier</hi> affirms, that <hi>I preached,</hi> it is a moſt notorious untruth; for neither did I
<pb n="21" facs="tcp:114689:15"/>
ever ſpeak, write, or preach word in defence or allowance there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of, or of anie ſuch <hi>Sports</hi> uſed on that day; neither was that De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>claration ever publiſhed firſt or laſt, either by my ſelf, or anie aſſiſtant of mine: Yea, that I did in writing directlie oppoſe, and expreſly condemn it, may appear plainlie by what was before related, tho preached indeed before that <hi>Declaration</hi> came out, yet printed at firſt two yeer after it, <hi>Anno</hi> 1620. and reprinted without alteration of ought, in the yeer 1637.</p>
            <p>But paſs we on to the other <hi>Book</hi> here related to, my <hi>Treatiſe of the Nature and Uſe of Lots,</hi> which is girded at in the terms of <hi>Cards and Dice,</hi> ſhuffled in under the diſguiſe of <hi>Sabbath Sports,</hi> there by to wind and ſcrew in my <hi>Treatiſe</hi> within the verg and compaſs of the ſubject matter with allowance, admitted in that other deſervedlie abhorred <hi>Book.</hi> Tru it is, I acknowledge it, and am not at all aſhamed to own it, that I publiſhed ſometime a large <hi>Treatiſe of the Nature and Uſe of Lots,</hi> having in the Pulpit before, more briefly delivered ſomewhat of that ſubject; and I publiſhed it the rather, being by divers of my Reverend Brethren, unto whom I had imparted the ſum of what I had de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>livered, encited ſo to do: To refel the miſreports that ſome other, from whom, in ſome particulars I diſſented, had raiſed concerning the Doctrine therein taught by me. In this <hi>Diſcourſ</hi> I make it evidentlie to appear, that <hi>a Lot</hi> in the <hi>genuine nature</hi> and <hi>ordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>narie uſe</hi> of it, (and with extraordinarie, without ſpecial com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſſion and injunction, we have nothing to do) <hi>is no ſacred mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter, nor divine Oracle;</hi> and may therefore be uſed indifferentlie, as wel in <hi>light and ludicrous,</hi> as in more <hi>ſerious and weightie affairs:</hi> And that in regard hereof, <hi>Diviſorie</hi> and <hi>Luſorie Lots,</hi> ar <hi>lawful</hi> and <hi>warrantable; Conſultorie</hi> and <hi>Divinatorie, un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lawful and damnable:</hi> And that it is therefore as wel <hi>a ſuper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtitious conceit</hi> on the one hand, to condemn anie game in regard of a <hi>Lot</hi> uſed in it; as it is on the other hand, <hi>a ſuperſtitious and irreligious practiſe, to make uſe of a Lot,</hi> for the diſcoverie of Gods wil and purpoſe, either what he would have done by us, or determineth himſelf to do. And in this judgment I ſtil reſt, having, as occaſion hath been, ſufficientlie and fullie (as I conceiv) refelled and anſwered the <hi>Arguments and Objections</hi> of all, who have either publiſhed ought herein againſt me, that ever came to my hands, or by writing delt in private with me: So as that I have
<pb n="22" facs="tcp:114689:16"/>
not received anie further <hi>Replie</hi> from anie one of them; yea, I have ſo far forth convinced ſome of the greateſt and moſt eminent among them, that they have been enforced to relinqiſh, and have refuſed to own, that ground, which together with the moſt of the other partie, they had formerlie with much confidence built on; to wit, <hi>That in everie caſualtie there is a ſpecial and immediate providence:</hi> (Seeing the palpable abſurditie thereof plainlie diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>covered) but in room thereof have endeavored to introduce an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>other new conceit, no leſs abſurd then the former; as may be ſeen in the <hi>Second Edition</hi> of that concerning <hi>Lots</hi> in Engliſh, <hi>Chap. 4. pag.</hi> 52-59. and in mine <hi>Antitheſis</hi> to Dr. <hi>Ames</hi> his <hi>Theſes</hi> in Latine. Nor do I anie further juſtifie anie <hi>Game, Sport,</hi> or <hi>Paſtime,</hi> depending either in part, or in whole upon <hi>caſualtie,</hi> (of which kind <hi>Cards</hi> and <hi>Dice</hi> indeed ar) if they be anie way abuſed, or found otherwiſe faultie; ſave onelie, that they ar not therefore evil, or to be condemned, becauſe there is a <hi>Lot</hi> in them.</p>
            <p>Yea but, tho I did not preach for <hi>Morrice dances</hi> and <hi>May-games,</hi> yet I did <hi>impudentlie Preach for Carding and Dicing, on the Lords day.</hi> For ſo much do this calumniaters words im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>port, <hi>That I preached impudentlie for Sabbath ſports, as Cards and Dice, &amp;c.</hi> So by his <hi>Et Caetera,</hi> indeed ſhewing himſelf not unwilling to have thoſe other alſo underſtood.</p>
            <p>I need ſay no more here, but <hi>ſit liber judex, Let my Book de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cide it;</hi> that my <hi>Treatiſe of Lots,</hi> I mean, wherein that may be found, which I ſhal here thence tranſcribe, directlie oppoſite to either, <hi>Chap.</hi> 9. where I give <hi>Cautions for Game</hi> in general. <hi>Sect. 4. p.</hi> 293. &amp; 295.</p>

Recreation is good, when it is ſeaſonable, when it comes in his du time; elſ, as it is with fiſh and fowl, when they come out of ſeaſon, that is evil, that is good otherwiſe. Now then do men uſe Game and Recreation unſeaſonablie, when they ſhould and ought to be otherwiſe employed, either in the works of their ſpecial Callings, or about the holy things of God,</hi> (to wit, as it foloweth more particularlie and fullie, <hi>Pag. 295.) when they ſhould be tending the holie things of God, either in publick or in private. And thus, it is a ſin to follow game on the Sabbath, as the Jews uſed to do, and do
<pb n="23" facs="tcp:114689:16"/>
yet to this day; and as the Popiſh ſort ar noted ordinarilie to ſolemnize their Feſtivals. For this is not to ſanctifie or con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſecrate the Sabbath as holie to the Lord. The Sabbath indeed is a day of reſt, but of holie reſt; of rest not to worldlie re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>creations, but to heavenlie meditations; of rest to religious and ſpiritual employments. It is ſacriledge therefore to folow game on the Sabbath; at ſuch time as we <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 span">

And let this therefore remain, as an impu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent calumnie of a ſhameleſs Sycophant, upon record, That <hi>Mr.</hi> G. <hi>Preached impudentlie for Libertie of Sabbath Sports.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>But this,</hi> ſaith he, <hi>Mr.</hi> G. <hi>did formerlie, when he was a Prelate.</hi> Of ſome Province, it may be in Sir <hi>Thomas Mores <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>topia;</hi> where Mr. <hi>L.</hi> in a trance be-like, being there one of his Auditors, heard him preach thus. <hi>But afterwards</hi> (to wit, ſince he either left or loſt his Prelates place) <hi>in hope of Biſhops, Deans, or Chapters Lands, he became a pretended Presby<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terian.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>He would, at leaſt, have men believ<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> that I was ſometime <hi>Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>latical;</hi> but have of late turned my coat or my copie, and gap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing after ſome fat gobbets of the <hi>Biſhops or Deans Lands, pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tended
<pb n="24" facs="tcp:114689:17"/>
to be a Presbyterian.</hi> A calumnie as falſ as its Father is, or as his former Brat hath been convinced to be: And ſuch as he ſhall never be able to make good, tho his Maſter, that ſets him on work, joyn with him in it.</p>
            <p>For my judgment concerning <hi>Church-Government,</hi> it is the ſame ſtil that ever it was, ſince I firſt began to enqire into matters of that nature. A dulie bounded and wel regulated <hi>Prelacie</hi> joined with a <hi>Presbyterie,</hi> wherein one as <hi>Preſident, Superin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tendent</hi> or <hi>Moderator</hi> (term him what you pleaſe,) whether an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nual or occaſional, or more conſtant and continual, either in regard of yeers, or parts, or both joyntlie, hath ſome <hi>preeminence</hi> above the reſt, yet ſo, as that he doth nothing without joint con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent of the reſt, (a <hi>module</hi> or <hi>patern,</hi> whereof I am enformed to have been ſometime repreſented unto the late King, by two wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thy perſons, men of eminent parts, and moderate mindes, the one a <hi>Prelate,</hi> the other in ſome kind <hi>Prelatical,</hi> which had it been accepted and eſtabliſhed, how advantagious it might have proved, it is not for me to define; but as is reported, was then diſallowed and rejected by ſome great <hi>Prelates,</hi> and others, by whom the King was moſt ſwayed.) Such a manner of <hi>Prelacie,</hi> I ſay, I never durſt, nor yet dare condemn. But ſuch a <hi>Prelatical power,</hi> as was here conſtituted and exerciſed among us, wherein <hi>Biſhops</hi> and <hi>Arch-deacons</hi> were enabled and ordinarilie uſed by their <hi>Chancellors, Officials,</hi> and <hi>Surrogates,</hi> moſtlie meer <hi>Civi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lians,</hi> aſſuming to them anie ſorie felow in Orders to fit by, as a cipher or a ſhadow, to paſs the higheſt and heavieſt of all <hi>Church-Cenſures,</hi> beſides <hi>Civil Penalties</hi> in their Purſes, on the Perſons both of Paſtors and People, and for trifles and trivial things, meer matters of Ceremonie, oft-times ſilence, ſuſpend, and deprive, while ſcandalous, idle, or inſufficient ones, were lit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle regarded or looked after; Viſitations being by either uſuallie held once onelie in a yeer, and then rather of Courſ and Cuſtom, or to receiv Procurations, then to anie effectual Reformation of ought. Such a Prelatical power ſo conſtituted, and ſo executed, I never could effect or approv; and trulie much leſs, when I came to ſee the manner of it, which I had heard too much of before, when living ſo long in a <hi>Pastoral Charge,</hi> I never in all my time ſaw the face of a <hi>Biſhop</hi> perſonallie preſent in Court, or Arch-deacon but once, (tho both conſtantlie exacting Fees of us.) And
<pb n="25" facs="tcp:114689:17"/>
obſerved, how things were ſhuffled up, when Preſentments were made, and in that manner managed; without anie courſ taken to bring anie Delinqent, to a ſerious ſight of, or ſincere ſorow for his ſin; that their Viſitations might wel be deemed to be held, as one ancientlie complained, <hi>Non tam morum, qam nummorum gratiâ; Rather to emptie mens Purſes, then to mend their manners.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>And my judgment thus formed, I accordinglie paſſed my vote, and gave my conſent with others, for the removal of that Bodie of Government, that was then eſtabliſhed with us. Yet (which I then alſo did not forbear to profeſs, as wel in deliverie of mine own ſenſe, as in endeavor to give ſatisfaction to others, ſeeking to me for advice,) withal conceiving, That howſoever ſuch a <hi>Syſtem</hi> or <hi>Fabrick,</hi> as was then repreſented, were juſtlie and deſervedlie deemed not unmeet to be diſſolved and demoliſhed; yet if anie peice of timber or ſtone-work were found ſound and uſeful in that frame, it might ſtil be retained, notwithſtanding ought, con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deſcended unto and agreed upon in that <hi>Article.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>On the other ſide, I could not but affect and approv of that Form of <hi>Diſcipline</hi> ſetled in the <hi>Reformed French and Dutch Churches,</hi> wherein the main courſ of <hi>Government</hi> is ordinarilie exerciſed, caried on by a conſtant attendance of the <hi>Miniſters</hi> in their ſeveral <hi>Congregations,</hi> having for inſpection of mens cariages, ſome of the diſcreeteſt and moſt underſtanding among their people, in way of aſſiſtance, adjoyned unto them; which might wel be a ſpecial means, both to eaſe the Miniſter of much labor and diſtraction, and to further the Reformation of things among the people amiſs. Matters more weightie, that reqire fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther advice, being referred unto, and tranſacted by the joint con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>currence of the ſame perſons of both ſorts before mentioned, ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther at ſet-times or occaſionallie convening to that purpoſe. Herein I was the rather confirmed by the ſucceſsful fruits and effects that this Form of <hi>Government</hi> is reported to have pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duced, for the advancement of pietie and repreſſing of diſorders in ſome places, where it hath been eſtabliſhed, even by the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſſion and acknowledgement of ſome Papiſts themſelvs, who (as I have formerly elſewhere ſhewed) have given Teſtimonie there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>unto. <note place="margin">See Vindicat. p. 17, 18.</note> Tho it cannot be expected that anie Churches ſhould en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>joy ſuch a flouriſhing eſtate, in regard of outward accommoda<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions

               </gap>ſtaſt and diſ-favor, then affect the Profeſſion. And this way therefore I gave my <hi>Vote</hi> in the <hi>Aſſemblie,</hi> as divers other, if not the greater part, did; not as deeming it abſolutelie neceſſarie, but as <hi>agreeable to Gods Word,</hi> and ſuch as I conceived might be moſt advantagious for the carrying on of Gods work, with hopeful expectation of a ſucceſsful iſſu, had that Form of Govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, as it was from the <hi>Aſſemblie</hi> to <hi>both Houſes</hi> propounded, been ſoundly eſtabliſhed, and backed by their <hi>Autoritie,</hi> who had begun to erect it.</p>

In regard whereof alſo in thoſe fore-paſſed troubleſom times under the <hi>Prelates,</hi> I maintained a good cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reſpondence, and ſome inward familiaritie with the moderater ſort on either ſide; as wel with ſome few of the <hi>Prelatical</hi> partie, who tho ſtiff for the <hi>Ceremonies</hi> legallie eſtabliſhed, yet miſliked thoſe innovations that in the latter times began to creep in; nor did approv the cariage of buſineſſes with that rigor and extremitie againſt ſuch as refuſed <hi>conformitie,</hi> being pious and peaceable; as alſo with divers of thoſe, of the <hi>Presbyterian</hi> partie, that ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther openlie oppoſed, or were known to condemn as wel the <hi>Cere<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monies</hi> as the <hi>Prelacie,</hi> as things altogether unlawful, and deemed the <hi>Presbyterie</hi> ſuch as before was deſcribed the onelie tru Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernment of Chriſt.

Mean while I have endeavored to ſhape my courſ, as near and as evenlie as I could, by the card of Gods truth diſcovered in his Word, and the compaſs of mine own Conſcience, from thence enformed and directed thereunto, without declining to anie by<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>path, either on the right hand, or on the left. In which tenor the Lord in mercy and goodneſs be pleaſed ſtil to keep me, and to lead me on to the laſt, which muſt needs be ere long.</p>
            <p>But what was it, think we, ſaith this my Traducer, that from <hi>a profeſſed Prelate,</hi> induced me to turn <hi>a pretended Presbyteri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>an?</hi> It was <hi>the hope</hi> forſooth, ſaith he, <hi>of ſome Biſhops or Deans Lands?</hi> And how doth that appear? Why? <hi>ſince its decay the poor man is mute.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>I marvel much, when or where I was ever diſcovered, either formerlie, or of late, to gape after ſuch gobbets. The time was, when by occaſion of ſome employment about the Edition of a learned mans works of another Profeſſion, left by him to be firſt ſurveyed and perfected in part by me, and then publiſhed with the joynt advice of an ancient Doctor verie intimate with the Archbiſhop that then was, and living moſtlie in houſe with him, I had tender of preferment made me by the Doctor at firſt from
<pb n="28" facs="tcp:114689:19"/>
him, and upon preſentment of the work by word of mouth, af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter ſeconded in the preſence of ſome great ones, if I would have been biting at ſuch baits; which I fairlie waived, conſidering what hooks might lie hid under ſuch profers, and how manie have been taken therewith to their prejudice in matters of greateſt con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cernment.</p>
            <p>Nor, had I been greedie of anie ſuch fat collops, out of the Bi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhops or Deans Lands, would I have refuſed one of the prime places in the Univerſitie, of which, further hereafter, wherein no ſuch ſnare was, when it was freelie offered me, being in yearlie revenue, I ſuppoſe, not below divers <hi>Deanries,</hi> if not above ſome meaner <hi>Biſhopricks.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>But the proof ſubjoined, is wel worth the obſerving; tho he jabbers ſo, that one can hardlie tel from his words, what he would have. <hi>Since its decay,</hi> ſaith he.

            <p>Now for mine own part, I cannot be charged to have been faultie in this kind. In <hi>two places</hi> onelie have I exerciſed <hi>a ſetled Miniſterie</hi> for theſe <hi>Two and fiftie years,</hi> ſeated <hi>Ten years</hi> in the one place, and <hi>Fourty two</hi> in the other.</p>
            <p>The former place, wherein I was ſeated, was <hi>the worthie So<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cietie of the Profeſſors, Practiſers, and Students of the Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon Law of this Land in</hi> Lincolns Inn. For mine <hi>entrance</hi> whereunto, that I may not be taxed of ambition for undertaking ſuch a place at ſo few years, after ſo famous men, as had with much credit formerlie held and diſcharged it, I ſhal to free my ſelf from that aſperſion, give a tru account how I came to it. Having upon ſome occaſion obtained Licence of diſcontinuance from the <hi>Colledge,</hi> whereof I was <hi>Fellow,</hi> from the Earl of <hi>Kent,</hi> and the Lord <hi>Harrington,</hi> the Counteſs of <hi>Suſſex</hi> her Truſtees for the founding thereof, and abiding now with Sir <hi>William Cook,</hi> my Kinſman, at <hi>London,</hi> the <hi>Preachers place at</hi> Lincolns Inn be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>came vacant; Whereupon a Gentleman of that Houſe, to me a meer ſtranger, but of my reverend and inward Friend Mr. <hi>Stocks</hi> acqaintance, at whoſe Church he had ſometime heard me Preach, together with him repairing to me, acqainted me with the buſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs, encited me to put in for it, aſſuring me, that by the Lord
<pb n="34" facs="tcp:114689:22"/>
Chief Juſtice <hi>Pophams</hi> mediation, whom he knew to favor me, it might eaſilie be obtained. I was verie averſ to the motion; albeit, that Mr. <hi>Stock</hi> alſo inſtigated and encouraged me there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>unto. But my counter-plea to them both was, That I durſt not adventure, ſo young and raw, to look ſo high. While we were to and fro debating the buſineſs, in that verie conjuncture of time, Dr. <hi>Mountague,</hi> Maſter of the Colledge, being come up to the Citie about ſome Colledge affairs, was pleaſed to vouchſafe me a viſit, deſirous to draw me back to the Colledge; and telling me, That he had prevailed with the Lord <hi>Harrington</hi> to allow a Salarie for an <hi>Hebrew Lecture,</hi> which he would have me to read. But being enformed by Mr. <hi>Stock,</hi> upon what account they were with me, he earneſtlie preſſed it, that I ſhould in no wiſe refuſe it; it would be a grace to the Colledge, to have the firſt that went out of it, to ſettle in a place of that note; nor ſhould I need to ſeek or ſu for it, or to be ſeen at all in it: He, being the next day to attend the Lord <hi>Popham</hi> about a Colledge buſineſs, would break the matter to him; which being accordinglie per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formed by him, his Lordſhip immediatelie ſent his Secretarie to the cheif of the Houſe; by whom being invited to Preach the next <hi>Lords day</hi> with them, I was within few days after choſen their <hi>Lecturer.</hi> And indeed had it been of mine own ſeeking, I could hardlie have ſatisfied or juſtified my ſelf in a ſpontaneous undertaking of ſuch a charge. For the truth is. I was but young, and ſeemed younger then indeed I was. In regard whereof, it might not altogether undeſervedlie have been deemed of me, that I had flown out of the neſt, before I was wel fledged; and that it had been better for me, as <hi>David</hi> willed his Embaſſadors re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turning from the <hi>Ammonites,</hi> to have ſtayed at <hi>Jericho</hi> among <note place="margin">2 Sam. 10. 5.</note> the ſons of the Prophets, until my Beard had been better grown. Nor may it be amiſs here, to recreat my Reader, with a plain <hi>Corydons</hi> cenſure, about that time, paſt on me. Mr. <hi>Leigh,</hi> afterward Sir <hi>James Leigh,</hi> and Lord Treaſurer, was that yeer Reader at <hi>Lincolns Inn,</hi> and having his familie in Town, both he and his wife heard me Preach one Lords day at <hi>Martins</hi> in the Fields. Whence after return from the Sermon, Miſtreſs <hi>Leigh</hi> was pleaſed to ask an old Servant, with whom, by reaſon of long continuance in the familie, they were wont to talk more familiarlie, How he liked the Preacher; who returned her this blunt anſwer,
<pb n="35" facs="tcp:114689:22"/>
               <hi>That he was a prettie pert Boy, but he made a reaſonable good Sermon.</hi> Not manie weeks after Mr. <hi>Leigh</hi> returning from <hi>Lincolns Inn,</hi> told his wife, he would tel her ſome news, <hi>That Yong man,</hi> ſaid he, <hi>whom you heard at St.</hi> Martins, <hi>is choſen our Lecturer at</hi> Lincolns Inn; which the old felow ſtanding by, when he heard, askt <hi>Whether the old Benchers would be taught by ſuch a Boy as he.</hi> Howbeit, it pleaſed God ſo to diſpoſe of it, that I was courteouſlie entertained by them; nor was my youth in contempt with them, but I received as much reſpect from them as I could deſire, yea, much more then I could expect. Which kind and courteous uſage tied me ſo faſt to them, (as to ſuch bands may that of him in the Comick be wel-applied, <hi>Qam</hi>

Howbeit after, when I married, and had a Familie in the Citie, they raiſed it to Threeſcore of their own accord, without anie motion of mine; but withal they reqeſted me to Preach once a day in the Vacation time, when anie ſtore of companie was in the Houſe; as in the two ſhorter ones conſtantlie, and in the two longer, until the ſolemn Readings were over, uſuallie there was. That which I alſo was
<pb n="36" facs="tcp:114689:23"/>
right-willing to do, making mine abode in the Citie, whereas formerlie I was wont to ſpend the Vacations with a Knight, my Kinſman, in the Countrey.</p>
            <p>Nor wanted I opportunitie more then once or twice, while I ſtaid there, to have mended my means, had I been eagerlie bent, or had but a minde thereunto. For I had places more then two or three offered me, both from Gentlemen in the Houſe, and from others abroad.</p>
            <p>Firſt, The Lectureſhip at the <hi>Rolls</hi> being vacant, offer was made to me of it from Sir <hi>Edward Philips,</hi> then Maſter of the <hi>Rolls,</hi> by Sir <hi>Robert</hi> his Son, and Mr. <hi>Whitakers</hi> his Secretarie, who both uſed to hear me; ſuppoſing that I might wel enough diſcharge both, being no farther aſunder, and but for once a day with either, and that at the <hi>Inn</hi> at ſeven in the morning; which I waived, willing to reſerv my ſelf whollie to the place where I was. But this was no motion for removal; ſome addition to my means onelie: That which foloweth was,</p>
            <p>After that my <hi>Morning Lecture</hi> was reduced, or deduced ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, to the ordinarie hour in moſt places, Mr. <hi>Maſters</hi> Maſter of the <hi>Temple</hi> (for that Title his place there bare) his own Lecture continuing at the wonted hour, uſed, after that diſpatched, to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pair to mine, as I did to Dr. <hi>Leyfields</hi> at <hi>Clements,</hi> until that courſ was in the <hi>Inn</hi> altred, as before hath been related. Mean while the <hi>Lecturers</hi> place falling void at the <hi>Temple,</hi> he by a wile drew me to Preach one Afternoon on the <hi>Week Lecture day</hi> there; And ſhortlie after (I little dreaming ought of his inten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion therein) repaired to me with a motion from ſome of ſpecial note and power there, to remove thither; withal aſſuring me, that the place would be of double value to me, to what I had where I was. But my Anſwer to him was, that I would not on anie terms ſhift from one <hi>Inn</hi> of Court to another.</p>
            <p>Much about the ſame time, that hopeful Prince <hi>Henrie,</hi> whoſe life in likelihood the ſins of this Land, and of thoſe times ſhort<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned, keeping his Court at St. <hi>James,</hi> where abode with him that Mirror of Nobilitie, the young Lord <hi>Harrington,</hi> and attended on him that Religious Knight Sir <hi>Robert Darcie,</hi> theſe two with ſome other Gracious Ones of His Graces Court, freqented my Miniſterie in the Afternoons eſpeciallie; which for ſome ſpace of time I then ſpent in handling of ſome <hi>Points</hi> in <hi>Controverſie</hi>

between us, and the Papiſts, being enformed that divers Popiſh Prieſts, or Sprites, if you pleaſe, hanted the Houſe, and were verie buſie in laboring to pervert the yong Gentlemen. The Notes of one of thoſe Sermons Sir <hi>Robert Darcie,</hi> by mine inward and entire friend, Mr. <hi>Bradſhaw,</hi> got from me, under the Title of <hi>The Popes Pride, and Papiſts Idol.</hi> This he and the yong Lord imparted to the Prince; and upon ſuch further terms of recom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mendation, as they were pleaſed to adjoin, and his good opinion of me, as they conceived, thereby produced, they took the bold<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs by my worthie Friend Mr. <hi>Hilderſham,</hi> and Mr. <hi>Jacob</hi> join<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing with him, to ſolicite me to come and Preach one day before the Prince at his Court; not doubting to prevail with him to bring me in to be his Chaplain, and by the aſſiſtance of Biſhop <hi>Moun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tague,</hi> then in favor with the King his Father, to procure for me that place of conſtant attendance in that kind about him, that was ſometime deſigned to Mr. <hi>John Burges,</hi> had not the deſign miſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>carried by a Sermon which he preached before the King, and coſt him much trouble. Unto which motion, I deſired by them to be returned, after thankful acknowledgment of deep engagement to thoſe worthy perſons, for their good opinion of me, and affecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on to me, That as I deemed my ſelf unworthie of ſo great a fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vor, ſo I wel knew my ſelf verie unfit for ſuch an employment, being naturallie of a verie baſhful diſpoſition, and finding in my ſelf a great indiſpoſition and averſneſs to Courtlie attendance, and reqeſted therefore of them, that no motion or mention might be further made of ought in that kind.</p>
            <p>Among others of note that were there my frequent Auditors, by reaſon of the Vicinitie of his Houſe in <hi>Holborn,</hi> was the Right Honorable Lord <hi>Rich,</hi> Father to the preſent Right Honorable Earl of <hi>Warwick,</hi> whoſe freeneſs and conſcientiouſneſs in the donation and diſpoſal of ſuch Eccleſiaſtical places as he had intereſt in, is to all that knew him not unknown.

formal Conference at <hi>Hampton Court,</hi> proving more troubleſom, then formerlie they had been, made me the rather willing to reſt contented with a ſmal portion in a priviledged place, then by re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moving to a place of larger revenue, to attract more diſtraction, and expoſe my ſelf to the hazard of greater diſturbance. In re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ference to this refuſal, that Noble Lord, being preſent at a Sermon at <hi>Lincolns Inn,</hi> wherein I took my leav of them, being then up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on departure (tho conſtrained afterward for ſome unexpected occaſion to ſtay a Term, or two longer) demanded of ſome of the Ancients of the Houſe, among whom he there ſat, Whether I were leaving them; as marvelling, how my mind came to be changed from that which I had formerlie profeſſed.</p>
            <p>During the time of mine abode there, there lived much in the Houſe, not as <hi>Practitioners in the Law,</hi> but as <hi>Aſſociates with the Bench,</hi> two worthy Knights of eminent parts for variety of lerning and reading, Sir <hi>Roger Owen,</hi> and Sir <hi>William Sidley;</hi> and I was for their entire affection much beholden to them both. Sir <hi>R. Owen</hi> would gladlie had me ſeated in <hi>Shropſhire,</hi> where my Father was born in an ancient Houſe, the name whereof our Fami<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lie beareth, being allied unto moſt of the ancient Gentrie in that Countie; wherein alſo a Living of good revenue was offered me by a Merchant, that Contrey-man by birth, in the City, if I would have gone to it. But Sir <hi>W. Sidley</hi> was very deſirous rather to draw me down into <hi>Kent,</hi> and to that purpoſe, a great Living, not far from the place of his cheif reſidence, falling void by the Incum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bents deceſs, tho being not in his own gift, but in the gift of one, whom he had ſpecial intereſt in, preſuming therupon, he offered to procure it for me. This motion to waiv, when I alledged my loath<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nes to leav <hi>Lincolns-</hi>Inn; he replied, that his intent was not, that I ſhould leav my place there; that in <hi>Kent</hi> would afford means to maintain an Aſſiſtant, who might for the Term time diſcharge all there, while I was employed here. But I told him, the burthen between both would be too heavie for my infirm ſhoulders to bear. And ſo that buſineſſe broke alſo off.</p>

For being a man of a pleaſant wit, at the Table ſometime diſpoſed to be merry (as his manner oft, but without offence, was) upon occaſion of ſuch diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cours as came in the way, he told thoſe his fellow-Benchers that were in the ſame Meſſe with him, that he had in his Study a Book called the <hi>Ship of Fools,</hi> and that they ſhould all three of them go into it, one for refuſing a large fee offered him in a great mans cauſe, which he liked not, another, for returning his Clients Fee, having waited at the Bar; when the Cauſe could not be heard; a third for ſome other ſuch like matter, which I now remember not; and being demanded by one of them concerning me, being in the ſame Meſs, whether I were therein to bear them company too: <hi>Yes,</hi> (quoth he) <hi>he muſt in upon a double account; Firſt, He ſits here among us, and takes a great deal of pains with us for a ſmal confideration, and being by Sir</hi> W.

unpleaſing to a Reader of no over-rigid and unpleaſant Diſpoſition, nor offenſive, I hope, to anie.</p>
            <p>But, <hi>è diverticulo in viam,</hi> to return again into the road. By what hath been related, concerning the means of my maintainance at <hi>Lincolns Inn,</hi> but withal, the courteous entertainment there conſtantlie afforded me; it may appear, that it was neither the largeneſs of the ſtipend that ſtaid me ſo long with them, nor yet anie diſreſpect, or diſcontent, that moved me, as ſome before me, to leav them.</p>
            <p>For the truth is, for mine Auditorie there, the generalitie of them, were not a people that affected change, either noveltie or varietie; but reſted wel-ſatisfied with my conſtant courſ and te<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nor of teaching; and verie ſeldom therefore brought in anie to Preach in my room; in ſo much (I may trulie ſay it) that ſcarce above <hi>Twelv Sermons</hi> in all my <hi>Ten yeers</hi> with them, were preached there by anie beſide my ſelf. Nor were they addicted to ſtray much abroad, one or two taken much with Dr. <hi>King,</hi> then Dean of <hi>Chriſt-Church</hi> in <hi>Oxford,</hi> and Parſon of St. <hi>Andrews</hi> in <hi>Holborn,</hi> uſed to repair thither to hear him, when they knew that he preached; and ſome few would now and then ſtep to <hi>Pauls</hi> Croſs. Among whom that pleaſant Gentleman before ſpoken of, tho it were not freqent with him, being miſſed one day at Chappel by ſome of thoſe that uſed there to fit neer him, and coming late into the Hall at dinner, and being thereupon demand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed by one of them, where he had been ſtraying abroad; <hi>I have been,</hi> qoth he, <hi>at</hi> Pauls <hi>Croſs. Thou wentest thither ſure to hear ſome news,</hi> ſaid the other: <hi>No trulie,</hi> replied he, <hi>I went upon another occaſion; but I learned that indeed there, which I never heard of before, how the Aſs came by his long ears; for the Preacher there told us a ſtorie out of a Jewiſh Rabbin, that</hi> Adam <hi>after he had named the Creatures, called them one day again before him, to try whether they remembred the names that he had given them; and having by name cited the Lion, the Lion drew neer to him, and the Horſ likewiſe, but then calling to the Aſs in like manner, the Aſs having forgotten his name, like an Aſs ſtood ſtone ſtil; whereupon</hi> Adam <hi>having beckoned to him with his hand, ſo ſoon as he came within his reach, caught him with both hands by the ears, and plucked him by them ſo ſhrewdlie, that for his ſhort wit he gave him a
<pb n="44" facs="tcp:114689:27"/>
long pair of ears.</hi> Upon this ſtorie told them, one of them told him, he was wel enough ſerved for his gadding abroad; he might have heard better and more uſeful matter, had he kept himſelf at home. But this by the way, not to lengthen, but to lighten the tediouſneſs of this long diſcourſ, undertaken not ſo much to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſs <hi>Lilies</hi> lying tongue, as to render an account of my courſes, for better ſatisfaction both to others, and to my ſelf.</p>
            <p>But if neither enlargement of means drew me, nor diſcontent from mine Auditorie drave me away from them, what was it then that either cauſed or occaſioned my removal? This alſo I ſhal trulie and ſincerelie relate. The Rectorie of <hi>Rotherhith,</hi> or as it is commonlie called <hi>Rederith,</hi> becoming vacant by the deceaſe of the Incumbent, there was ſome ſtickling in the Pariſh about a Succeſſor. For the legal right to preſent being preſumed to reſt in two Orphans, tho it was afterward diſcovered to reſide in a third partie, divers of the better affected in the Pariſh began to negotiate with the Gardian and Friends of thoſe two children un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der yeers, and from them having obtained a promiſe, that none ſhould be preſented to it, but ſuch an one as they ſhould nominate, repaired unto me, and were earneſt with me, that I would accept of it. But I acqainted them with my reſolution of not leaving the place where I was; whereupon they departed, and made trial of bringing in ſome other. But in proſecution thereof, they found the paſſage ſo obſtructed, that they were not able to proceed.</p>
            <p>For a perſon of no parts, but of verie ſcandalous life, while the Doctor Incumbent lay ſick, had been tampering with the ſame parties, with whom they were then dealing, before them, about the ſale of the Patronage, and the Mother of the Orphans had re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived ſomewhat as a gratuitie from him, to deal with them and their Gardian, to bring the buſineſs about. And albeit, that the In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cumbent dying, ere ought was tranſacted, the negotiation in regard of anie power to preſent that could thereby accrew unto him, if they had proceeded then therein with him, would have been of no effect; and the money were returned him, that the Mother had taken of him; Yet he perſiſted in purſuit of a troubleſom ſuit, to draw them to ſome agreement with him, whereupon he might be preſented by them, being underhand backed and fed with money by two Tenants of Sir <hi>H. Hobart,</hi> then Attorney General to King <hi>James,</hi> who occupied a great qantitie of Land held from
<pb n="45" facs="tcp:114689:27"/>
him in the Pariſh, and had covenanted with that partie to have it tithe free, if he were once poſſeſſed of it. The difficultie was much improved by a Caveat they found entred in the Biſhops Of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fice, by a Gentleman, one of the Petti-Bag, who pretended a Title; as alſo for that Mr. Attorney ſolicited by his Tenants, and not wel underſtanding what manner of fellow he was whom they delt for, did in their behalf ſomewhat countenance their proceed<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings, and was indeed deſirous himſelf to deal for the Patronage, having much Land in the Pariſh, with intent in ſome future vacan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cie, thereby to have opportunitie of preferring a yong Scholar, who was then School-maſter in his Familie. Thoſe wel-minded perſons therefore, fearing that either that ſcandalous partie would be obtruded upon them, or ſome other might chop in, while they were bickering with him; as it had faln out in a former vacancie, wherein one by a wrong title got in, and held the place ful two yeers ere he could be ejected; and ſuppoſing withal, that if I would accept of it, Mr. Attorney would not onelie ſurceaſe to counte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nance the other partie in that buſineſs, but would alſo help to cleer the way for my entrance; repaired to Mr. <hi>Stock,</hi> whom they knew to be inward with me, reqeſting him to deal with me, and perſwade me to embrace the motion by them formerlie made to me. Who thereupon tendring the condition of the place, accom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>panied them to me, and was verie earneſt with me in it, preſſing hard, what a miſerable eſtate that people were likelie to be in up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on my refuſal, whereas they where I then was, were able enough to furniſh themſelvs again, to their own contentment upon my remov<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>al. At his importunitie, upon ſuch grounds ſeconding and backing their ſuit, I condeſcended ſo far forth, as to make an aſſay to try how Mr. Attorney would reſent the buſineſs, and how far forth he would interpoſe in it. To this purpoſe I made uſe of Mr. <hi>Crew,</hi> afterward Lord Cheif Juſtice, a man of tried and known integri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie, to break the matter to him. Unto whom his anſwer was, That he would do anie thing in his power, that ſhould be to my content, and willed that I ſhould come to him. So I did, and told him, that I had upon a motion made to me from ſome Inha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bitants of <hi>Rederith,</hi> engaged my ſelf to come to them, and ſettle with them, if the paſſage were free, the cleering whereof they ſuppoſed might depend much upon him. Who, after ſome Speech had, how glad he ſhould have been of my continuance with them,
<pb n="46" facs="tcp:114689:28"/>
and in part blaming himſelf, that nothing had yet been done for the enlargement of my means, <hi>If they mean,</hi> ſaid he, <hi>reallie, as they pretend, and you deem it may be behoveful for you, let them procure you a preſentation, and upon ſight of it, you ſhal ſee what I wil do.</hi> This being ſignified to them, they having by ſome counſel been enformed, that albeit the Father had by wil beqeathed <hi>the perpetual Advocation</hi> to his yonger Sons, yet the right thereof by courſ of Law reſted in the Eldeſt, which for ſome cauſes was as yet deemed fit to conceal, drew him to join with his Brethren, and brought me a <hi>Preſentation</hi> under the Hands and Seals of them all three; which being repreſented to Mr. Attorney, he forthwith wrote a Letter to the Biſhop, whereby all obſtructi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons were removed, and I admitted without further ado to the place. After it was noiſed in the Houſe, that I was upon removal, divers of them repaired to me, of whom ſome out of their pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vate, offered to engage themſelvs for ſuch a further ſupplement, to what I there then received, as ſhould eqal the Revenue of the place motioned to me; others endeavored to perſwade me to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain the place ſtil, being for the Term time onelie; to which pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe alſo ſome of my Reverend Brethren in the Miniſterie were in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtant with me. But to the former I anſwered, That I had paſſed my word to come to them, and that upon other grounds then means of maintainance onelie; to the other, That the burden would be too weightie for me: And trulie ſoon I ſo found and felt, being compelled to continu but a Term or two with them, until they were fitted to their mind. Howſoever divers of thoſe that ſucceeded me, held other places together with it, ſome in the Univerſitie, and ſome in the Citie; and indeed my Reverend Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther-in-Law Mr. <hi>Charls Pinner,</hi> whoſe Daughter I was to mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rie, by all means diſſwaded me from hearkning unto thoſe that would have perſwaded me thereunto, affirming, <hi>That either place reqired a whole man.</hi> Who was alſo right glad, that by my removal I had eſcaped the promiſed preferment to <hi>a Preben<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>darie;</hi> nor was he ſorrie, when he underſtood, that Mr. Attorney had profered me the Title of being his Chaplain; which I willing<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lie accepted, being but a titular matter, reqiring no conſtant at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tendance, onelie a <hi>viſit</hi> now and than, and a <hi>Sermon</hi> ſometime upon ſome ſpecial occaſions, the rather that by his power and countenance, I might ſit the more qietlie, and exerciſe my Mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſterie
<pb n="47" facs="tcp:114689:28"/>
more freelie, in ſuch a place eſpeciallie, where he had Lands of much value, and Tenants deemed to be of the greateſt abilitie; but my Reverend Father in Law, becauſe it might, he ſaid, <hi>Keep me from being Chaplain to anie Biſhop;</hi> for he uſed to ſay, That as the times then were, <hi>a Prebends place, and a Biſhops Chaplain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhip, were two ſhrewd ſnares:</hi> Both which, I bleſs God for it, I hereby eſcaped.</p>
            <p>Nor indeed were my means ſo much, as manie imagined, im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proved by removal to the place where as yet I abide, and have now for ful fortie and two yeers reſided. For beſides that I came to a dwelling houſe wilfultie much mangled and defaced by the late <hi>Incumbents Widow,</hi> out of meer ſpight and ſpleen, not ſo much againſt him that was to ſucceed, being then uncertain, as a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt ſome of the Pariſh, with whom her Husband had had much contention, and the Wharf before it (a chargable piece) readie to drop down; toward the charge whereof albeit ſome two or three contributed ſomewhat, yet the main matter came out of mine own purſ; and the firſt fruits that were to be paid; as al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſo that the main Fabrick of the Church ſupported with Chalkie Pillars, of ſuch a bulk as filled up no ſmal part of the room, and were found verie faultie, threatning a fail, if not a fall, unleſs ſpee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dilie prevented, to the ruine of the whole; which to remov and place ſtrong Timber Columns in the room of them, would prov a verie great charge; albeit, the repair of the Bodie of the Church were no way chargable upon the Rector, yet to encourage others to a freer and larger contribution thereunto, I lanched out of mine own accord ſo far, having as yet received little benefit of my place, that none out-went me, few to ſpeak of came neer me. Add here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>unto, that not long after this a ſhip firing on the River, juſt againſt my houſe, much endangered it, being covered, as from its firſt building it had been, with Reed; which to prevent the like hazard that might, (as it did alſo ſome time) after enſu, I there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore took away, and in ſtead thereof (which was no ſmal charge to me) covered it all over with Tile. Theſe things, I ſay, ſet aſide, which yet ſhrewdlie drained my ſmal ſtock, becauſe they were not a conſtant charge; come we to the Annual Revenue in either place, and ſee what addition was made by this latter to the for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer. In the place that I left, I received Threeſcore pounds by the yeer cleer: In the place I came to, finding it a troubleſom
<pb n="48" facs="tcp:114689:29"/>
buſineſs to take up Tithes, being paid, except ſome four of the Pariſh, by Butchers and Graſiers moſtlie, living either in the Bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rough, or in the Citie, I let out my whole <hi>Tithe</hi> and <hi>Gleab</hi> for One hundred pounds by the yeer. Whence deducting the Annual payments of <hi>Tenths</hi> and <hi>Subſidies</hi> to the <hi>King,</hi> the <hi>Procura<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions</hi> to the <hi>Biſhop</hi> and <hi>Arch-deacon,</hi> the Aſſeſsments for the poor, wherein I was rated as deep as anie in the Pariſh, for his perſonal eſtate, the yeerlie Salarie to the <hi>Curate</hi> whom I found in the place, the ſame that the Doctor had before allowed him, which, tho in regard of his mean parts I could have in my teach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, no help or eaſe from him; yet in reſpect of his povertie, ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving a Wife and Children, I was fain for divers yeers to continu unto him, until he could furniſh himſelf with ſome place elſwhere, and when he left me, larger means to one of better abilities, from whom I might have ſome aſſiſtance in the work of my Miniſterie. Theſe disburſments, I ſay, deducted, and laid altogether, the improvment, I ſuppoſe, wil appear to have been no ſuch great matter.</p>
            <p>And this was the main matter that I enjoyed here for Ten yeers together; not receiving ought of conſtant payment from the main <hi>Bodie</hi> of the <hi>Pariſh,</hi> ſave from ſome three or four for the Land that they held. There had indeed been ancientlie a <hi>Rent-tithe</hi> paid upon the houſes; as in the neighboring Pariſhes alſo then was, and ſtil is: And that even then alſo, as by the <hi>Church-Book</hi> appeared, under ſome not-preaching Miniſters, when the Inhabitants beſides that payment were fain to maintain one to Preach with them at their own charge. But this had been inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitted, and my Predeceſſor, after ſome yeers enjoyment of it, by his own miſcarriage of the buſineſs, put beſide it. For there falling o<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

               </gap>t much contention between him, and ſome of the cheif of the Pariſh, they ſet ſome of the poorer ſort on work to denie him pay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment thereof. Whom he thereupon ſued in the <hi>Eccleſiaſtical Court,</hi> and made proof there by ſufficient witneſſes of the conſtant payment of it, for above Threeſcore yeers paſt. But when ſentence was readie to paſs, a <hi>Prohibition</hi> came out of the <hi>Common Pleas.</hi> Whither the buſineſs being transferred, the Doctor not wel adviſed, joined iſſu amiſs with them, and ſo being caſt in the Suit, was de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>barred from recoverie of ought for himſelf, tho it were no bar un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to anie his Succeſſor.</p>

               <pb n="49" facs="tcp:114689:29"/>
For <hi>Ten yeers</hi> it thus lay aſleep or dead rather after his deceaſe, and mine acceſs to the place. Nor did I receiv a pennie all that while in lieu of it, from the main bodie of thoſe among whom I conſtantlie exerciſed my Miniſterie. But having ſat ſo long qiet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lie, and my charge encreaſing; and being enformed of a <hi>Record</hi> in the <hi>Firſt-fruits Office,</hi> whereby it appeared, that in the valua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of my <hi>Rectorie,</hi> taken upon Oath in King <hi>Henry</hi> the Eighths time, the <hi>Tithe on Houſes</hi> was included as a third part of its valu at a certain rate, according to which valuation I paid my yeerlie <hi>Tenths</hi> to the King for it; I made a motion to my people, that ſince it was agreeable to conſcience and eqitie, that the Mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſter of the Word, who took pains conſtantlie in the exerciſe of his Miniſterie with a people, ought to receiv a conſtant maintainance and conſideration for it from them; And that, as I conceived, even by the Law of the Land, ſuch a particular conſideration was du unto me, and had from time to time been made good to my Predeceſſors; My reqeſt therefore was, That I might without ſuit, or trouble, either to them, or my ſelf, with mutual love and agreement, receiv it, or ſomewhat in an eqitable manner propor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tionable to it. To this the anſwer of the moſt was, That for my ſelf they were wel content, and willing to do ſomewhat that way; but they knew not who might come after me, and were loath therefore to oblige themſelvs to ought as a du.</p>
            <p>While thus the buſineſs hung in ſuſpence, and nothing done, good words onelie given, that ſeemed to be as a dilatorie plea; ſome of the better affected, moved, that without breach of Cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritie, or offence taken on either ſide, <hi>a Trial at Law</hi> might be had, in a peaceable and amicable proceeding, whereby the right of the demand might appear what it was, and either ſide reſt in the iſſu thereof.

Upon the cauſe thus heard, a <hi>Decree</hi> was paſſed, to put me <hi>in Poſſeſſion of the Tithe upon the Rents of Houſes,</hi> as in other the Neighbor Pariſhes it had been, was then, and is ſtil paid. Howbeit, when it came to be demanded, ſome being willing to pay, and ſome refuſing, to prevent further ſuits, that might after ariſe, it was by mutual conſent on both ſides a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>greed, that the buſineſs ſhould be referred to certain <hi>Arbitra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tors</hi> on either ſide choſen, and what was by them concluded, ſhould by a new <hi>Decree</hi> in the ſame <hi>Court</hi> be confirmed; which was accordinglie done, and an <hi>Agreement</hi> ſo made and ratified, that <hi>in lieu of Tith on Houſes, Fortie pounds</hi> ſhould be paid me yeerlie by <hi>Ten pounds a qarter,</hi> to be aſſeſſed upon the wealthier ſort of Inhabitants, the poorer people being ſpared, and to be gathered by the <hi>Church-Wardens</hi> for the time being, and by them qarterlie paid in to me.

Notwithſtanding, after that I had for ſome few months forborn preaching, ſuppoſing that all in my Lungs was now perfectlie cloſed up and healed, I betook my ſelf afreſh again to my wonted imployment, and perſiſted therein, until either the former or ſome other vein in the ſame part, reſerated the ſecond time, and with more violence diſgorging it ſelf then before, I was enforced to have recours to the former remedie again; but found it a work of more difficultie now by that courſ (albeit a double qantitie almoſt of blood to what before, was then drawn from me) and other means adjoy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned thereunto, to effect a reſtraint, and repreſs the efflux, then for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>merlie it had been. And I was then told by the Phyſician, that I muſt whollie forbear Preaching, unles I would wilfullie make a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>way myſelf; and this is the <hi>wilful or unwilling ſilencing of my ſelf from Preaching.</hi> Which howſoever I therefore forbear, that I may not thereby make my ſelf guiltie of ſelf-murther; yet do I not whollie neglect my Paſtoral employments, ſo far as with ſafetie I may perform anie (for this voidance of blood doth at times ſtil ſurprize me, tho not with ſuch vehemency, as at thoſe other times it did) in <hi>Administration of the Sacraments</hi> with ſuch ſhort <hi>Collations</hi> as ar ſuitable to the preſent occaſion, in <hi>Viſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation of the ſick,</hi> and other like Offices, as abilitie ſerveth, and my weaknes wil permit.</p>
            <p>Yea but, <hi>When I preach not at all, yet I exact, or at leaſt receiv from my people Two hundred pounds a yeer.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Suppoſe that being now unable to preach, and take thoſe pains with my people that formerlie I had done, I ſhould yet admit from them, ſome good portion of that which I did formerly re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiv; eſpeciallie at mine own charge providing and procuring ſome able perſons to perform what is reqiſite to be done, but am not able to do my ſelf; (that which I have been careful of ever ſince this infirmitie hath held me, ſo far as in me lay ſo to do) ſuppoſe, I ſay, I ſhould ſo do, I am of the mind, that no ingenu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous people would deem it a thing unjuſt or uneqal, or could up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on any eqitable ground denie it to one, that had ſpent himſelf and
<pb n="51" facs="tcp:114689:34"/>
his ſtrength among them, and upon them; ſo long as God was pleaſed to continu abilitie to him. Sure I am that by Gods own Ordinance and appointment, the ſons of <hi>Levi,</hi> who had under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gone the ſervice of the Tabernacle, until they were <hi>fiftie yeers</hi> 
               <note place="margin">Numb. 4 3. and 8. 25, 26.</note> old, ſhould then, growing in yeers, be diſcharged of a great part of their wonted ſervice; and yet were not then to loſe their liveli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hood, or their part in the Tithes and other annual allowances to that Tribe and Function aſſigned, albeit they did no toilſom work for it.</p>
            <p>But whether I <hi>reqire</hi> it or no, certain it is that I <hi>receiv</hi> it, and that it is no leſs then <hi>two hundred a yeer.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Belike, tho I be not ſo gripple to exact or reqire it; (and where is <hi>the old Churls covetouſnes then?)</hi> yet my people ar now grown on a ſudden ſo wonderful open-hearted and open-han<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded, as to bring or ſend at leaſt in to me more by much then ever at anie time they afforded me. And <hi>Qis niſi mentis inops obla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tum reſpuat?</hi> what a follie were it for me to refuſe and return it? what a diſcourteſie had it been not to receiv and accept ſo large, or laviſh rather, a courteſie, ſo freely and profufelie tendered? As upon my refual of that Place in the Univerſitie before-mentioned, which was then conferted on a worthie Brother far fitter for it then my ſelf, whom to the great loſs not of that Colledge alone, but of the whole Univerſitie, and the no leſs grief of al his wel-affected Brethren of the Miniſterie, unto whom his worth and parts were known, the Lord hath latelie taken from us; when upon the pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lication thereof in the <hi>Aſſemblie,</hi> he out of his ingenuous mode<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtie ſtood up, and made an Apologie for himſelf, that he had not ſought for the place, as I verilie beleiv he had not, and by the par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie <note place="margin">
                  <hi>Mr.</hi> S. M.</note> that publiſhed it to clear him therein, it was averred, that <hi>if that Reverend Father</hi> (ſo was he pleaſed to ſtile me) <hi>that ſat over againſt him, had not refuſed it; he had not been thought upon for it.</hi> As I ſay, an ancient Doctor now deceſſed, <note place="margin">
                  <hi>Mr.</hi> P.

<pb n="60" facs="tcp:114689:35"/>
much at leaſt as would have amounted to that which he received from me, who officiated for me, to try whether, or how far forth I ſhould have accepted of it, or received their free offer. But this on a liers, <hi>Lilies</hi> word, I ſhould ſay, they that liſt may beleiv. What I receiv is ſoon-known; for it comes not to me by manie hands, nor need I fear, or be loath to have it known what it is; I receiv <hi>qarterlie,</hi> for all the <hi>Tithes</hi> of the grounds, <hi>Seventeen pound ten ſhillings,</hi> and for all my <hi>Gleab, five pounds ten ſhillings;</hi> which all put together, wil not make up <hi>One hun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dred</hi> a yeer. For as for <hi>Tithe-rent</hi> for houſes formerlie paid, I have for divers yeers paſt not receiv'd one pennie, nor ought in lieu of it; the pretence of the moſt is, that I admit not all pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſcuouſlie to the Lords Table, but according to Ordinance of Parliament in that behalf enacted, nor as yet, that I know, repea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led, reqire of thoſe, whom I admit, ſome account of their Faith, but of neither ſort, the one or the other do I in this kind receiv ought, tho recoverable in the Court of Excheqer.</p>
            <p>Now out of the ſum above ſpecified, which I receiv <hi>quarter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lie,</hi> do I conſtantlie iſſu <hi>thirteen,</hi> and ſometime <hi>fourteen pound a qarter</hi> unto him that performs thoſe Offices for me, which with ſafetie my ſelf cannot. Whereunto when there ſhal be added, what in right of my <hi>Rectorie</hi> I part with in <hi>Tenths</hi> and <hi>Taxes</hi> to the State, <hi>Aſſeſments</hi> for the poor, with other like neceſſarie payments, wherein I ſtand as deeplie charged, as if I enjoyed the whole, and as when I received moſt; it will eaſilie appear how ſmala portion or poor a pittance rather, of what I receiv, comes into mine own purſ. So that I may wel ſaie of my <hi>Rectorie,</hi> as <hi>Luther</hi> ſometime of <hi>Free-wil,</hi> it is <hi>Titulus ſine re.</hi> I hold a bare <hi>Title of a Rectorie;</hi> a ſorrie pittance of ought that may fit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lie bear that name.</p>
            <p>But why do you retain the <hi>Title</hi> then, may ſome ſay, if you reap no more benefit by it?</p>
            <p>I Anſwer, It is much againſt my mind, as not a few wel know. I have a long time been deſirous to deveſt my ſelf of it: I made divers yeers ſince my mind known to my people, concerning my not willingneſs onelie, but erneſt deſire, in regard of mine imbecillitie, to reſign it, and reqeſted them to take ſome ſpeedie courſ for the bringing in of a faithful and able
<pb n="61" facs="tcp:114689:35"/>
Paſtor, under whoſe Miniſterie my ſelf might live comfor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tablie together with them. One was nominated by the par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie, who bears the <hi>Title</hi> of <hi>Patron.</hi> Some exceptions were taken againſt him, and I erneſtlie preſſed to retain the <hi>Title,</hi> til ſuch an one might be had as was generallie approved. I growing daylie as more weaklie, ſo more wearie of the Charge, have ſince that time again, and that ſome good ſpace of time ſince, cauſed it to be motioned to the partie, in whom the right of Preſenting is deemed to reſt, that if he would nominate anie one that ſhould for Life and Abilities be approved of by the <hi>Claſſis</hi> whereof I am an uſeles Member, or by any three of them, I would, upon their approbation ſignified, readilie re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſign; But of any ſuch I could never yet hear from him. I am now put in hope that another way the burden may be wholie taken off from my ſhoulders, and one of better Abilities placed in my room; the day whereof I long to ſee, as that which wil be a day of libertie, and much eaſe of mind to me.</p>
            <p>Thus having, I hope, to anie, not totallie cloſed, or wilful<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lie winking eie, evidentlie diſcovered, the notorious untruth and vanitie, of thoſe ſlanderous calumnies, that this lying Varlet hath endevored to faſten upon me,</p>

At my firſt acceſs to the familie, and entertainment there, beſide my confereuces with the Gentle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man at ſuch times as he reqired; I uſed to pray morning and even<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing with the familie, and in the morning to read withall ſome por<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of Scripture; and after ſome time, at the Gentlewomans motion, to ſpend ſo much time as could well be ſpared in expli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cation of the Text, where anie difficultie occurred, raiſing of ſome few inſtructions, and making brief application thereof. In this manner within the ſhort time of mine abode there, not much above a twelvmonth, I went over all the Epiſtles of the Apoſtles, the Propheſies of <hi>Eſay,</hi> and a good part of the Book of <hi>Job,</hi> which practiſe ſo continned, both verie much improved mine own skill in the Tex<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">
