            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

               <hi>SIR,</hi>
            </p>
            <p>YOUR very great Civility in Perusing, and in some Particulars Animadverting upon these Collections, have given me the Confidence to recommend them by prefixing your Name. Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sides your Eminency in this Study, and your Plentiful, and not with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out great Skill and Difficulty, well chosen Treasure both for this and other parts of <hi>Natural History;</hi> and your unparallell'd Readiness to further and assist all Ingenious Lovers of this most Copious and
<pb facs="tcp:56789:3"/>
Gentile Study, do justly challenge a more Universal and Publick Te<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stimony of your Singular Worth and Eminent Goodness. For what more Honorable Intention can be proposed, than to endeavor the In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>troducing the Knowledge of the former Ages of the most Wise and Powerful Empire, out of their most Authentick Records? And what doth not he deserve, who labours a Resormation of the most Inge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nuous part of the Nation? But this is not my Business at this time: the narrowness of this room will only permit me to present to your self, and the Candid Readers, th<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">
                  <desc>•…</desc>
               </gap>se few Considerations.</p>
            <p n="1">1. The Catalogues of the <hi>Greek</hi> and <hi>Roman Coins</hi> discover to any one minded to furnish a Cabinet,
<pb facs="tcp:56789:3"/>
which are in either sort most Rare and Curious, <hi>i. e.</hi> which are not yet described in Print. It is true, there are many Families not found amongst these, but the Collections of that most Learned <hi>Ant. Angu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stinus,</hi> will give a great Essay to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward compleating that Number.</p>
            <p n="2">2. It was not proper for my Design, to take notice of all the Criticisms amongst Authors learned in this Art; but to prescribe gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral Directions for Interpreting the greatest Number and most com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon, as is done in the first part, wherein they are reduced to the most ordinary Topicks; and in the second, to give so far an ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count of the greatest Actions of the <hi>Romans,</hi> when come to their Maturity under the Emperors;
<pb facs="tcp:56789:4"/>
for though not all performed by them in their Persons, yet the Princes attributed them to them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves, rationally enough, because they paid for them. And amongst these I have only chosen those; wherein seems contained the most useful Erudition. And herein I have chiefly made use of those very eminent Persons, <hi>Onuphr. Pan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vinius,</hi> and the excellent <hi>Conte Tristan,</hi> whose first Volume only seems compleatly finished accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding to his Intention; the second is not so well laboured, but the third is little better than <hi>Adversaria.</hi> I thought it not necessary to pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceed much lower than <hi>Constantine,</hi> because after <hi>Aurelian</hi> very few, but after <hi>Constantine</hi>'s Family I know not whether any either of <hi>good Masters,</hi> or <hi>considerable Eru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dition.</hi>
               <pb facs="tcp:56789:4"/>
The <hi>Greek Emperors,</hi> which have, till of late, lain Fallow, chiefly because thought unintelli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gible, have now at length, by the great Industry of a most Learned French Gentleman, found their In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terpretation; and we despair not also of understanding those few of the <hi>Caliphs</hi> found amongst us, by the help of another.</p>
            <p n="3">3. It may be some Invitation to this Study, if we consider the great Obligations this Country had to the <hi>Romans,</hi> not only for their improving it in Buildings, High-ways, Artifice of War; but also by rendering a great part of it Habitable, which before was Lakes and Bogs. <hi>Romney</hi> seems to have been the first Essay and Pattern of their Draining; for
<pb facs="tcp:56789:5"/>
which reason to this day it re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tains the Name of the <hi>Roman Island,</hi> or their <hi>Dry-land,</hi> which before was Bog and Water. The working of our Minerals, espe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cially Iron, which the ordinary People attribute to the <hi>Danes,</hi> seems to have been the <hi>Romans</hi> Diligence. Not long ago I have seen divers Coins, fresh and rough, as if newly then coined, taken up under a great Mountain of Cin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders, which were wrought over again to good Profit, finding that the first Miners were not furnish<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed with sufficient Instruments for drawing out the finest parts of the Mettle. To this I add, that though very many <hi>Roman Coins</hi> be found here, yet not many of great Rarity; they being generally of those, who setting up for them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves,
<pb facs="tcp:56789:5"/>
against the lawfully-esteem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed Emperors, were called Tyrants, especially such as reigned here and in <hi>France.</hi> Such were <hi>Carausius, Alectus, Marius, Maximus, Postu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mus, Tetricus, Victorinus,</hi> &amp;c. till the time of <hi>Constantius Chlorus,</hi> who dying at <hi>York</hi> after divers Years reigning; and his Son <hi>Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stantine</hi> here taking up the Em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pire, there are many of them and their next Successors, till the entry of the <hi>Saxons,</hi> which was about Four hundred and fifty Years after Christ.</p>
            <p n="4">4. Many Particulars may be in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terposed, but I shall here take notice only of that wherein this Discourse differs from most Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thors; who say, that because the Tribuneship was Annual, there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
<pb facs="tcp:56789:6"/>
the <hi>TRIB. POT.</hi> was so likewise, and consequently the Years of the Emperors Reign to be accounted by it; which to me seems a great Error. Be pleased to take notice of these Instances. It is confessed that <hi>Tiberius</hi> reigned not full Twenty three Years. But in <hi>Gruter</hi>'s Inscriptions, P. 235. <hi>conc. Tiberius TRIB. POT.</hi> XXVIII. and P. 236. <hi>TRIB.

                  <hi>CHAP. I.</hi> Of the first Coin amongst the <hi>Romans.</hi>
               </head>
               <p n="1">1. IT is agreed by all Authors, that before the use of Money all buying and sel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling was Commutation of one Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>modity for another. But this manner being found inconvenient; because, <hi>First,</hi> It was almost impossible exactly to adjust the values of things; neither, <hi>Secondly,</hi> Could Commodities be so easily transported from place to place; many times also, <hi>Thirdly,</hi> The Ow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner of what another stood in need of, did not value what that other had to spare; they de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vised and agreed upon one Commodity, which might be a common measure for the just esti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mating of all others. And this at first amongst the <hi>Romans</hi> (for the Eastern Nations had the use of Silver and Gold-Money long before, as
<pb facs="tcp:56789:10"/>
appears by the Story of <hi>Abraham, Gen.</hi> 23. 16.) was Copper.</p>
               <p n="2">2. Now they made choice of a Metal ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther than any other Material, because it was frameable easily into any weight or figure; it would also endure longer, and not be so easily broken as Wood and many other things; and was in sufficient quantity, which Jewels were not, and yet not so plentiful as other Stones.</p>
               <p n="3">3. And amongst Metals they made choice of Copper, I suppose, because there was great<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er plenty and greater use of it than of other Metals; most of their Utensils, and Arms, de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fensive especially, being made of it.</p>
               <p>So that it being of universal use, every one was ready to exchange for it what he had su<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perfluous. And at first it was exchanged by weight in equality to the value of the thing re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiv'd for it: Whence it comes, that in pay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, spending, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> the words of Weight, <hi>impen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dere, expendere, appendere,</hi> &amp;c. are still used. Hence also <hi>(i. e.</hi> from Copper, being the only money at first) comes <hi>aes, aes alienum, obaerati, aerarium,</hi> &amp;c. to signifie not for Brass, but Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ney in general.</p>
               <p n="4">4. But because they found it very inconve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nient still to be weighing, Posterity devised to set a publick Stamp on certain pieces, which should declare their weight; and this in <hi>Rome</hi> was begun (as some say) by <hi>Numa Pompilius,</hi> from whose Name they will have it call'd <hi>Nummus:</hi> But as <hi>Pliny, l.</hi> 18. <hi>c.</hi> 3. by <hi>Servius Tullus,</hi> who marked the Images of an Ox, a Sheep, a Swine; either in imitation of the <hi>A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thenian</hi>
                  <pb n="3" facs="tcp:56789:10"/>
Coyn, or in reference to their value; that so many of such a Mark ordinarily bought an Ox, a Sheep, or an Hog. Hence it was call'd <hi>Pecunia.</hi> The pieces thus stamped (where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of none have been of a long time extant) were of divers weight; some of one pound call'd <hi>As,</hi> some of two pounds call'd <hi>Dupondium,</hi> o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers of the parts of an <hi>As,</hi> which had each their several names. For their <hi>As</hi> or pound was divided into twelve parts, one Ounce was call'd <hi>Uncia.</hi>

               <p n="5">5. Nor had the <hi>Romans</hi> any other Brass Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ney than this, which was very inconvenient by reason of the weight; so that they were wont to bring their Contribution Money to the Treasury in Carts, and it was deservedly call'd <hi>aes grave,</hi> [which was the reason that they were not so much concern'd who coined Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ney; and that they took thence Money for publick occasions; which, if in Bullion, was coined to make it currant amongst the people]
<pb n="4" facs="tcp:56789:11"/>
for any thing I can discover, till the first <hi>Car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thaginian</hi> War; when the Treasury being ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hausted, and the Commonwealth much in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>debted; they raised the value of their Coyn, ordering that an <hi>As</hi> should but weigh 2 Oun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces, and so be <hi>Sextantarius;</hi> so that of every <hi>As</hi> was made 6, of which the Commonwealth got five. And then, as it seemeth, began their Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ney (probably after the Example of <hi>Sicily,</hi> some parts of <hi>Greece,</hi> and most of <hi>Italy)</hi> to be stam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ped with the Image of two-faced <hi>Janus</hi> on the one side, and the Beak of a Ship in the greater, and the Stern in lesser, pieces of Coyn.</p>
               <p n="6">6. But afterwards when they were brought to that great distress by <hi>Hannibal, Q. Fabius Max.</hi> being Dictator, they were again lessened; and the <hi>As</hi> was made of the weight of one ounce, and after a while by the <hi>Papyrian</hi> Law of half an ounce: and of these they coyn'd not only ounces, but halves ¼<hi rend="sup">s</hi> ¾<hi rend="sup">s</hi> for the great<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er ease of the people, as appears by the Marks which we see upon the Consular Brass Money, (tho this Money be now found rarely) amongst the which was the <hi>Quadrans ratitus,</hi> pay'd or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinarily for their passage by water from the City to Mount <hi>Aventine,</hi> then separated by a <hi>Ponds</hi> or Marshy Lake; upon this was the Stern of a <hi>Rates</hi> or Ferry-boat, as upon the <hi>As</hi> was that of a Ship.</p>
               <p n="7">7. In the Year <hi>V. C.</hi> (of the City's building) 484. five years before the first <hi>Carthaginian</hi> War, was coyn'd the first Silver after the Pat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tern of the <hi>Sicilians;</hi> and the <hi>Denarius</hi> was made
<pb n="5" facs="tcp:56789:11"/>
equal to 10 <hi>Asses,</hi> and therefore had this Mark X or ♓, which <hi>Priscian</hi> calls <hi>Perscriptum,</hi> the <hi>Quinarius</hi> or <hi>Victoriatus</hi> to 5, and <hi>Sestertius</hi> to 2, and ½ or ¼ of a <hi>Denarius,</hi> which seems very strange that 1/84 of 1 <hi>l.</hi> at most in Silver, should be of equal value to 10 <hi>l.</hi> of Brass, that is, one pound of Silver to 840 <hi>l.</hi> of Brass; and this disproportion probably caused the lessening of their Brass Coyn before-mentioned, which was done not long after.</p>
               <p n="8">8. But afterwards in the great necessity of the City, in the second <hi>Carthaginian</hi> War, as they rais'd the value of their Brass Money, so did they also of their Silver; making the <hi>De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>narius</hi> equal to 16 <hi>Asses,</hi> the <hi>Quinarius</hi> to 8, and the <hi>Sestertius</hi> to 4, as by the Marks on some of those Coyns appeareth. And I know not whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther those <hi>Rates</hi> were much altered till <hi>Justi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nian</hi>'s time.</p>
               <p n="9">9. Concerning the Weight of the <hi>Denarius, Peireskius</hi> was of Opinion, and perhaps not without Reason; that the first <hi>Denarii</hi> were six to an ounce, or 72 to a pound or <hi>Mna Attica;</hi> but the latter were manifestly 7 to an ounce, or 84 to a pound. <hi>Al<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">

               </p>
               <p>Mr. <hi>Greaves</hi> saith, that an old <hi>Roman</hi> pound, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> weigheth 5246 <hi>English</hi> Grains, of which our pound <hi>Troy</hi> weigheth 5760; so that the dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ference of these Pounds is 514 grains.</p>

(tho <hi>Pliny</hi> in another place saith it was, and it is more probable it should be only XIII) <hi>anno V.

                  <hi>Aurei</hi> out of 1 <hi>l.</hi> varied as the <hi>Denarii</hi> of Silver, for when there were 96 in 1 <hi>l.</hi> of Silver, there were of Gold 48: and tho divers Authors say 50, yet it should seem those 2 were only for the coyning or clipping Money; so that tho the Gold in an <hi>Aureus</hi> was worth but 24 <hi>De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>narii,</hi> yet an <hi>Aureus</hi> coyned was current for 25 <hi>Denarii</hi> or 100 <hi>Sesterces.</hi> And this was the or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinary proportion and manner in the time of the Emperors, but at first (as <hi>Pliny</hi> saith) this proportion was not the same, but the Gold was heavier, and they made fewer out of one 1 <hi>l.</hi> I think it not worth labour to examine this obscure matter any further; and also if in this whole Discourse I have not every where hit this Truth, I beg your pardon; I have to my best ability set down what I found most probable; but the value of their Money was so often changed, their counting also by <hi>Sesterces</hi> so ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>scure and intricate; Authors also making use of numeral Letters in transcribing and printing are so corrupted, besides the difficulty of the Matter it self, that Learned men in these later Ages cannot agree about either the number or weight of their Coyns, as you will see if you please to take the pains to read amongst many, these the most Eminent, <hi>Budaeus, Geor.

<pb n="10" facs="tcp:56789:14"/>
Money, but every man might coin his own; yet in the general, as I said, it seems to me that the Officers of the Mint had liberty to put what stamp themselves pleas'd upon the Coin; which was frequently somewhat to their own Honour. For besides that, we find very few or no Coins of the famousest men, as of <hi>Scipio, Sylla, Marius, Flaminius,</hi> &amp;c. before <hi>Ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lius Caesar</hi> (who indeed, saith <hi>Dio, l.</hi> 44. had that Priviledge given him by the Senate, to have his Image upon the Coin in his life time) so have we still the Names of one or more Mint-masters, with Reverses sometimes allu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding to their Names, as the Lartch-tree to <hi>La<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riscolus,</hi> an Ox or Calf to <hi>Vitellius,</hi> somewhat of Medicine to <hi>Acilius,</hi> and the like; or to the Honour of their Family or Country: as <hi>Pomponius</hi> put upon his Coin <hi>Numa Pompilius; Titurius</hi> stamped <hi>Tatius</hi> the first King of the <hi>Sabines;</hi> or somewhat of their own Exploits, as <hi>Metellus</hi> stamped an Elephant, divers others <hi>Victories,</hi> and the like. And this continued a good part of <hi>Augustus</hi>'s time, even as long as the <hi>Triumviri</hi> put their Names upon the Coin with <hi>Augustus</hi>'s Head.</p>
               <p n="14">14. There were in the City certain Officers on purpose to overlook the Mint, who were <hi>Magistratus minores. Cic. de leg. lib.</hi> 3. called <hi>Curatores Denariorum flandorum:</hi> how many at first I know not, but afterwards there were three of them called <hi>Triumviri:</hi> A. A. A. F. F. F. <hi>i. e. AEre, Argento, Auro, flando, feriendo, faciun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>do</hi> till <hi>Julius Caesar</hi>'s time, who increased their number, making them IIII-<hi>Viri,</hi> and so that
<pb n="11" facs="tcp:56789:14"/>
number continued till after the Victory of <hi>Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gustus</hi> at <hi>Actium;</hi> when the <hi>Quatuorviri</hi> were again reduced to <hi>Triumviri,</hi> and so they con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinued. These Officers were chosen <hi>ex ordine Equestri,</hi> and coined sometimes the publick Money, which is expressed thus <hi>EX</hi> A. P. sometimes also (tho as I said, seldom) the Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nate ordered the Inscription, and then there is SC upon it; but it should seem most com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monly the Bullion of private persons, and the Inscription at their own discretion.</p>
               <p n="15">15. These were Officers in the City, but there was also Money coined in divers Provin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces, Colonies, and <hi>Municipia;</hi> and it was a Privilege granted to them, as also to some private men, if that place in <hi>Suetonius Tiber. c.</hi> 49. be so to be understood. <hi>Plurimis civita<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tibus &amp; privatis veteres immunitates &amp; jus Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tallorum</hi> (which if not coining, I know not what it is) <hi>&amp; Vectigalium adempta.</hi> Particularly the Officers General of their Armies coined Money very frequently (as it should seem) for speedy payment of their Souldiers; as at <hi>Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lonia, Cic. Ep. fam. C.</hi> 13. <hi>L. Planco:</hi> and then the <hi>Duumviri</hi> or annual Governors of those places (representing the Consuls at <hi>Rome)</hi> mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ked II <hi>viri</hi> or H <hi>viri;</hi> or the chief Magistrate of the place was Mint-master; as we see it frequently in the <hi>Greek</hi> Coins of the <hi>Roman</hi> Emperors.</p>
               <p n="16">16. It is also probable, that till <hi>Aurelians</hi>'s time it was lawful, if not for all, yet for very many Persons and Cities to coin; perhaps all those who had Charges of high Priesthood and
<pb n="12" facs="tcp:56789:15"/>
Sacrifices: which is the reason of such diver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sity of Coins and Medals before his time. It should seem also, that <hi>Aurelian</hi> reduced the Privilege of Coining to a few Cities, per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>haps to those named <hi>in notitiâ Imperii;</hi> which might be the cause of the great and difficult War he had with the <hi>Monetarii,</hi> of whom 40000 perished. Hence in and after his time, and not, or rarely, before, <hi>Sacra Moneta, i. e.</hi> which belong to the Exchequer to coin: few <hi>Greek</hi> Coins also after that time, few or no Medail<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lons, and little variety of Reverses; the Exche<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quer coining all of a bigness, and with the same Stamps.</p>
               <p>Now to what Cities the Minting was restrai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned, is very uncertain: In the times of the later Emperors the Cities, which had the Pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vilege of coining, put their Names to the Coin, or some other Mark with Letters; for what else those Letters in the Coins of the later Emperors should denote, I cannot imagine. Of such as set their Names, I have observed these: All with S. C. or with R, seem to have been coined at <hi>Rome,</hi> and commonly by good Masters.</p>

Some think that the Jews, till the destru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction of the City, had liberty of coining their own Money, and with their own Stamp, which, say they, is the reason that we see so many Shekels.

               </head>
               <p>THE later <hi>Italians</hi> call all those ancient Pieces <hi>Medaglie, quasi Metaglie,</hi> because made of Metal; which Name is still used to signifie such, whether Money, or other stam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ped or coined Pieces, as are reserved from Antiquity.</p>
               <p n="1">1. And of those, as I doubt not but (as <hi>AEneas Vicus, Savot,</hi> and others say) some were current Money; such were those which had <hi>sacra Moneta,</hi> or three Women representing the three Materials of Coin; or some one or more of the III-<hi>virs</hi> Names with A. A. A. Those which have the Mark of any part of an <hi>As,</hi> and generally all the lesser sizes; all very much worn; all of bad Masters, as are most of those by the <hi>Grecian</hi> Cities of the <hi>Roman</hi> Emperors, and such also (saith <hi>Cellini)</hi> as have but a shal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low impression; for Medals (as being for or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nament more than use) were made with great<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er care and expence.</p>
               <p>So they will also confess, that not all, which now we have, were ordinary Coin: as, 1. Not
<pb n="15" facs="tcp:56789:16"/>
the greater sort, which the <hi>Italians</hi> call <hi>Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>daglioni,</hi> many of which weigh 2 ounces and ½. 2. Not such as have about them a Circle of some other Metal than the Medal it self, which the <hi>Italians</hi> call <hi>Cotorniate,</hi> or <hi>Contornate:</hi> those (as they say) were either <hi>Missilia,</hi> Donatives, or <hi>Testimonia probatae Monetae,</hi> which the <hi>French</hi> call <hi>Pieds forts,</hi> or Essays of their Workman<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ship presented to the Prince and Persons of greatest Quality, which is the reason there are so few of them; especially those so accurately wrought, that some have thought that they made no more than one with one stamp. The reason why I conceive those not to be Coin is, because they cost more making than they could be worth in common usage; and for the same reason they must also grant that all of extraor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinary Workmanship; as also those of <hi>Corin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thian</hi> Brass (if any such, of which by and by) and in fine, whatever would not quit cost were also for other uses than current Money. And this is also confirmed by what is confessed of the Writers of those matters; that the Medals of the former Emperors were not current in the times of the later, who yet restamped ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny of them: and it is observed, that some of the Emperors after <hi>Severus,</hi> probably <hi>Gallie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nus,</hi> stamped a new Medals of all the consecra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted Emperors, yet not so lively as the former, but having their Faces somewhat mingled with the Tracts of the then present.</p>
               <p n="2">2. It is worth inquiring what uses they made of them, and to what end they coined those beautiful and costly Medals, I shall propose:
<pb n="16" facs="tcp:56789:17"/>
1. That they were much taken with the Excel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lency of the Workmanship, and that after<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards they wore them about their Necks: <hi>D. L.</hi> 7. <hi>tit.</hi> 1. <hi>l.</hi> 28. <hi>Nomismatum aureorum vel argen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>torum veterum, quibus pro gemmis uti solent, usus<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fructus legari potest. Glossa; animi voluptatem, de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lectationem, &amp; recreationem pro fructu haberi.</hi> And tho here be mention only made of gold and silver ones, yet 'tis not improbable those also of <hi>Corinthian</hi> Brass, if any such, or other Brass gilt (of which sort there are many) were also for the same use: <hi>Suet. Aug. cap.</hi> 75. <hi>Saturnalibus &amp; si quando alias libuisset, modo mu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nera dividebat, vestem, &amp; aurum, &amp; argentum, modo nummos omnis not<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">
                        <desc>•…</desc>
                     </gap> etiam veteres, regios, &amp; peregrinos;</hi> therefore Medals in that time were in great request; which also is collected out of his <hi>Tib. c.</hi> 58. <hi>Capitale esset nummo vel annulo Effigiem Augusti impressam Latrinae aut Lupanari intulisse;</hi> wherefore either he speaks of some extraordinary Stamp, and not of the Money ordinarily stamped with the Image of <hi>Augu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stus;</hi> but that those so stamped were of more Respect and Dignity, and for <hi>Donaria;</hi> or that there was great quantity of other Money not so stamped. Besides see in <hi>Nero, c.</hi> 11. the great profuseness of <hi>Nero</hi> in his <hi>Missilia, Vest is, Aurum, Argentum,</hi> &amp;c. But this could not be the principal intention of their making. Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sides therefore the formerly mention'd purpo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ses; I conceive the Princes themselves caused them to be made for the conservation of their Names and great Actions. For which they chose Brass rather than Iron, because more
<pb n="17" facs="tcp:56789:17"/>
easie to work, not so subject to rust, and more beautiful; rather than Gold and Silver, because the Workmanship being of more value than the Metal, was likely to escape the Goldsmiths fire, the prodigal hand of a careless Heir, the subtlety of the Thief, and the transportation of the Merchant. Now I conceive this to be their intention, because we see them so excellently wrought; all signal Actions with the exact ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>servation of Time, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> and many times the Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thority of the Senate fixed upon them; which being <hi>frequenter</hi> (S. C.) upon the large Brass Medals than upon Silver and Gold, intimates that there was some greater value set upon these than the other. Besides, few Inscriptions there are either in Gold or Silver, which are not also in Brass, but many in Brass, which are neither in Gold nor Silver. The <hi>Cotorniate</hi> also are all in Brass; the Figures in Brass are better cut; the Erudition also greater; to which add, that few, if any, <hi>Greek</hi> Medals, and Medals of Colonies of the Emperors in any but Brass; and then you have also the reason why greater account is generally made in these times of Brass-medals then either of Gold or Silver.</p>
               <p n="3">3. Medals of Copper are of divers sorts, chiefly three, Red, Yellow, and White. Red is ordinary Copper, of which there were di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vers sorts, as you may see in <hi>Pliny, l.</hi> 33. <hi>c.</hi> 1, 2. I think it not worth time to stand upon them. White was either Copper silver'd o're, or min<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gled with Tin, and that either whitened after they were coined, perhaps as we do now Studs
<pb n="18" facs="tcp:56789:18"/>
and Nails, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> as it is manifest in some of <hi>Aure<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lian, Probus,</hi> and that time, or else before; of which sort there are some in the first part of the Empire, chiefly in the Coins of the exter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal Cities of <hi>Augustus, Tiberius, Nero,</hi> and so to the <hi>Antonini,</hi> the which also are not of any good Master, and therefore not counterfeited. Yellow also is of several sorts, 1. Red or Cop<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per gilt, 2. a real Gold-colour throughout, 3. Brass or Kettle-metal, 4. bright yellow Copper gilt, 5. Brass or Kettle-metal gilt. 6. Pot or Candlestick-metal which is mingled with Tin or Lead. Till <hi>Severus Alex.</hi> most of the Coins are of some of the five first, but after him almost all of the last sort and worst. The second and third sort are they which go under the name of <hi>Corinthian</hi> Brass, concerning which Authors disagree. For <hi>Savot</hi> saith plainly, there are none extant either of true <hi>Corinthian</hi> Brass <hi>(i. e.)</hi> such as was made accidentally at the bur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning of <hi>Corinth</hi> by <hi>L. Mummius,</hi> where all the Statues of Gold, Silver and Brass running to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether, made a very beautiful and much-prized Composition, or of such as was made in imi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation of it; but those that seem so, saith he, are either Brass gilded, and not mingled in the melting; or else such as have that beautiful yellow colour from the <hi>Calaminaris,</hi> which some Copper imbibes better than other; as <hi>Pliny, lib</hi> 34. <hi>c.</hi> 2. observes of <hi>Livianum</hi> and <hi>Cordubense,</hi> which, saith he, were near as good as natural <hi>Orichalcum</hi> (which before his time was failed) and of these he noteth, that smal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ler
<pb n="19" facs="tcp:56789:18"/>
Money was made, but the <hi>Asses</hi> of <hi>Cyprus</hi>-Brass. But other Authors affirm, that there are Medals extant of <hi>Corinthian</hi> Brass, and those of three sorts: The first is of divers colours, white and yellow, as it were inlaid; caused probably, because the Metals mingled in pie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces, the fire not being sufficient to melt them down; of this matter very few, yet some of <hi>Tiberius, C. Caesar</hi> and <hi>Claudius</hi> they say they are. The second sort is white, in which the Silver predominated, these also very rare. The third sort is of the colour of Gold, of which (saith <hi>AEneas Vicus)</hi> there are many of <hi>Tiberius</hi> and till the <hi>Antonines,</hi> but none afterwards. These Medals also are, as he saith, of Excel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lent Masters, and are also much prized. How to determine the Controversie, I know not, I confess I never saw any of the three sorts to my best remembrance, yet methinks 'tis hard to maintain a Negative against them, who pretend to know and to have seen them.</p>
               <p n="4">4. Amongst the Silver-coins many are found of Iron and Brass within, and covered with a thin Plate of Silver; which was the reason, that to discover this fraud, they filed them in small notches, and call'd them <hi>Serratos;</hi> and (as <hi>Tacitus</hi> notes) were in reputation amongst the <hi>Germans.

<pb n="20" facs="tcp:56789:19"/>
mingled ⅛ of Brass with the Silver; but in later times Princes have taken care to make their Coin thinner, for the avoiding this Abuse.</p>

Stra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>da</hi> is but indifferently faithful, and this Edi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion especially hath added many false Images and Medals: by the way also note, that the Book of Inscriptions printed at <hi>Rome</hi> in <hi>Leo</hi> X's

time, is censured to be corruptly printed.</p>
               <p n="3">3. Now the ways of falsifying them are these: 1. By filing of the halves of two Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dals, whereof one side is wasted, and sodering them together. This is discerned easily, because many times the two parts do not belong to the same Emperor, nor are of the same Master; but chiefly because the conjunction appears by a white or silver Thread (for their Soder is made of that Metal) round about the Edge. 2. If an ancient Medal be almost consumed by working it over again with a Burin or graving Tool, and reingraving the worn Figures; if well done, these are not <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">
                     <desc>•…</desc>
                  </gap>uch inferior to true ones: but are known, because the middle is more hollow than the edges. 3. By restamp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing a Medal worn on both or one side; or by stamping a new Medal, by which means most of the modern ones are made; if on one side, they lay a Felt under the other side, notwith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>standing which, that side will be flat and bat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tered whilst the other is fresh and rough: if both sides be new stamped, the Traits will be crude and apparent, besides that the new Scul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pture is of another Mine than the ancient: the Letters made with another proportion, the M<hi rend="sup">s</hi> straight down, whereas all the Ancients are M. And by the writing are they well dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerned, for the Letters of the ancient are not uniform, nor very decent: Seeing, as <hi>Cellini</hi> very acutely observes, they graved all their Molds with Chisels or Burins, whereas the late Counterfeiters struck theirs with a Punch. But
<pb n="23" facs="tcp:56789:20"/>
the best way is that which <hi>Pliny</hi> saith, <hi>l.</hi> 33. <hi>c.</hi> 9. by comparing them with other modern and counterfeit ones. <hi>In hâc artium solâ Vitia discuntur, &amp; falsi denarii spectatur exemplar, plu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ribus<expan>

                     </expan> veris denariis adulterinus emitur.</hi> 4. By casting a new Medal upon an ancient one; to distinguish these, you must take notice, that Learned men do conceive the manner of coin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, especially great Medals, was anciently to melt the Metal, and cast it into Molds like a Ball, or Bullet, and then being hot, to stamp them flat with a great and heavy Hammer (such a one as we see upon some Medals) whence it comes, that most of the Medals have clefts in the Edges, caused by the force of the Instru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, which the cast ones do not well repre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sent. Besides, the melted Metal doth not so well and distinctly receive the minute Traicts of the stamp. Again, be the Spaud never so fine, there will appear small roughnesses as of Sand upon the cast Piece; nor can the best Caster in the most accurate flaskes hinder, that there shall not be little Edges of Metal to be filed away; the cast ones also are lighter than the true. 5. Lastly, by filling up a corroded Medal with a certain strong Paste, and casting over all a thick Varnish made of Sulphur, Ver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>digrease and Vinegar; which when you see you must suspect, and trying with any sharp In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>strument easily discover the fraud.</p>
               <p n="4">4. To give Rules sufficient for discerning of all false Medals is impossible, yet some few I will set down. 1. All which have moral sen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tences
<pb n="24" facs="tcp:56789:21"/>
upon them; as <hi>Festina lente; Veni, vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>di, vici,</hi> and the like, are false: there being ordinarily nothing but the Names, Titles, Time, Offices, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> of the Prince, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> 2. All or the greatest part of the Ancients, who were not Sovereign Princes, or who lived in Common<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wealths are counterfeit, as of <hi>Hannibal, Plato, Alcibiades, Nero,</hi> which <hi>Petrus Galilaeus</hi> sold to <hi>Paul</hi> IV. at a vast rate, <hi>Artemisia, Fabius, Sci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pio Africanus,</hi> and the like: also Medalions of <hi>Priamus, Dido,</hi> &amp;c. also the large ones of <hi>Carluas</hi> M. with a long Beard, and <hi>Gothick</hi> Inscription. 3. Divers of the <hi>Augustae</hi> in <hi>AEneas Vicus (i. e.)</hi> such as he confesseth to have taken out of <hi>Promptuarium Iconum.</hi> 4. All the ancient gold Coins were fine, and if not fine, not ancient. 5. To say somewhat of the Value of them, ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>serve these Rules: 1. Modern Medals well cast upon ancient ones, if cleansed and hansomed, are the best of all counterfeits, and may serve very well to fill up a Series. 2. Modern Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dals stamped of a good Master after ancient ones, and of a good representation are the next best, and are more worth than a common an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cient one. Modern ones also stamped upon an ancient one defaced, are better than of mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dern Metal. 3. Of all modern Counterfeiters the <hi>Padoani</hi> are the best, and their Works, especially such as were stamped when the Stamps were fresh, are much esteemed.</p>
               <p n="5">5. It is very hard to cleanse a Brass Medal from Earth and Rust, some boil them half an hour in Water with Tartar, and a little Alom,
<pb n="25" facs="tcp:56789:21"/>
after they are cold rub them well with Tanners Oaze or with Bran; others pass them over lightly with <hi>Aqua fortis,</hi> but this is dangerous, and by no means to be used in such as are of mixed Metals; others put them in the fire, but that commonly spoils them; others rub them with Tripoly or a Wire-brush; but the best way is with the Burin or Graving tool for them that know to use it and have the patience.</p>
               <p n="6">6. Medals are esteemed, 1. for their Anti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quity, 2. for the goodness of their Master; the best Masters were from <hi>Nero</hi> to <hi>Pertinax,</hi> a time of long Peace, 3. for their well-conserva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, cleanness, and beauty, 4. for their great<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness, 5. for their Erudition, 6. for their rarity, 7. to make up a Series. Now these Rules are observed by men of the Trade concerning their rareness and value.</p>
               <p n="7">7. The Medals are rare, when of a Person who reigned but a short time; or but few made of him, or one that is singular of an Emperor of whom there are many common. Medals Contorniate, tho of a bad Master, are rare and very much esteemed, so are they which have the Face hollow, such also as have two Heads upon them, whether on the same or divers sides; such as have the bust or good part of the Body with the Head; such are ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny of those who were only <hi>Caesar</hi>'s, and not <hi>Augustus</hi>'s, which have no Reverses, save only an Inscription. The Medals of the lower Em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perors in great, and of the higher in little, are rarer. Great <hi>Greek</hi> Medals of the Emperors
<pb n="26" facs="tcp:56789:22"/>
are not much more esteemed than the lesser, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause of their ill Masters. Great Consular Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dals rare, if any at all. Medaglions of Gold and Silver very rare, if any at all, of Brass also rare: Which to understand, take notice there are four bignesses of Medals, 1. Medaglions, 2. great Medals which have frequently S. C. upon them, 3. mean, 4. small ones. The exact bigness of each, tho both <hi>Goltzius</hi> and <hi>Ant. Augustinus</hi> set down, yet I think them not exact enough to give them here. Note al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>so, that they are dearer in some places than others; either according as they find Chap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men, or are known, or that the Emperors lived there; as here <hi>Carausius</hi> and <hi>Allectus</hi> are not scarce, which in other places are counted very rare.</p>

                  <hi>CHAP. V.</hi> Of Family or Consular Coins.</head>
               <p n="1">1. THere are very many <hi>Roman</hi> Coins, the age whereof is uncertain; but are ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nerally supposed to be before <hi>Julius Caesar,</hi> to which difficulty we shall speak by and by: and they were at first collected by <hi>Fulvius Ursinus</hi> in his excellent Work; who found no other ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vantage, beside the Reverses to be made by them, and that to discover the <hi>Roman</hi> Families; and according to those Families, he ranketh them Alphabetically, which is the reason they are called <hi>Coins of the Families:</hi> And so great was his diligence, that I have not read nor met with any could scarce add one Medal of any one Family, he hath not set down; except one <hi>Betiliena</hi> and two or three lately added by Mon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sieur <hi>Seguin: Gorlaeus</hi> indeed hath pretended an addition to him; but he hath only more Coins of the same Families, and such are not rare; but of another Family he hath not added any <note n="†" place="margin">Monsieur <hi>Patin</hi> since the writing of this, hath somewhat augmented <hi>Fulvius Ursinus</hi>'s Colle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction; and <hi>Morellius</hi> in his late Book, promiseth to add a Third Part more.</note> And the <hi>Architetto Generale</hi> of the Kingdom of <hi>Naples,</hi> a very Cu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rious and Ingenious Gentleman, hath given us hopes that he will discover some others. But <hi>Golt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zius</hi> coming after, and thinking
<pb n="46" facs="tcp:56789:32"/>
this an inferiour and by intention, was or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dered by his Patron <hi>Marc. Laurinus</hi> to reduce them to the Consuls; and so they come to be called Consular Coins. An undertaking, which was indeed impossible to come to good effect; for this he doth, when he finds upon the Coin any Name which in the <hi>Fasti</hi> he finds to be the Name of a Consul, he immediately attributes that Coin to him. But, First, The Power of Coin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing was not in the Consuls, but in the <hi>Trium<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viri;</hi> and therefore the Names upon the Coins, are in all probability, the Names of some of the <hi>Triumviri</hi> that coined that Piece; be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause that upon many of them it is so set down; and we have no reason to imagine, that the rest were any others. Secondly, The <hi>Ro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mans</hi> had very frequently divers men of the same Name: and therefore, though sometimes, it is possible <hi>Goltzius</hi> might hit upon the truth, yet it is then but by accident, only when the Mint-Master was afterwards made Consul; for he could not have any good Conjecture (much less Certainty) that such a Coin belonged to such a Person. Thirdly, Besides there was no intention in the Coining, to refer them to Consuls, since there is ordinarily upon them but one Name; and many times <hi>Q.</hi> or <hi>P. (i. e.)</hi> Quaestor or Praetor, which were Offices incom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>patible with the Consulship. Now it is likely, that either the <hi>Triumviri</hi> had some of those Offices also; or that some of their Families or near Relations had born those Offices; and done also those eminent Actions, which are di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vers times described upon the Coins: So that
<pb n="47" facs="tcp:56789:32"/>
the Inscription was in the Power of the Mint-Master, except where something was particu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>larly ordered by the Senate; and then <hi>S. C.</hi> is set upon it.</p>
               <p n="2">2. Yet there are some Learned Men, who think none of these Coins ancienter than <hi>Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gustus Caesar;</hi> and that they were Coined in the <hi>Municipia,</hi> upon occasion of their Solemnities, as Games, Sacrifices, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> because we find sometimes <hi>II-Vir</hi> upon them; and they seem to be of a la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter and better Letter. But it seems to me, that ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny of them were ancienter, and coined at <hi>Rome:</hi> for the <hi>III-viri</hi> were Officers in the City only, as the <hi>II-viri</hi> were in the <hi>Municipia;</hi> and where we find <hi>II-viri,</hi> that Money was indeed stamped there; and commonly the Name of the City, is expressed or intimated upon it. 2. The <hi>Bigati</hi> and <hi>Quadrigati</hi> were certainly ancient Money of <hi>Rome:</hi> So <hi>Tacitus</hi> calls it <hi>pecuniam veterem ac diú notam.</hi> 3. Neither is the Name nor Head of the Emperour upon them, as was usually upon such Money as was Coined in their times, but the Head of <hi>Roma.</hi> 4. If the <hi>Municipia</hi> Coined such, and so many that remain, why not <hi>Rome</hi> many more? Then what is become of those infinite numbers of <hi>Denarii</hi> stamped be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore the Emperours? 5. The Names of Offices, as Praetor, Quaestor upon some, and <hi>S. C.</hi> upon others, are sufficient Arguments, that they were Coined at <hi>Rome:</hi> to which add, that there is no Sign nor good Argument, to shew they were stamped any where else. Nor is the goodness of the Letters, sufficient to prove them
<pb n="48" facs="tcp:56789:33"/>
Modern, since sometimes there were better, sometimes worse Masters: besides, many other occasions might intervene for the making the Stamps better or worse; tho indeed many of them are very bad: besides that, it is diffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cult, if not impossible, to assign a short time, for the change of the Letters of a Language, one hundred years many times scarce making any difference.</p>
               <p n="3">3. I shall set these Coins down in the same order, as I find them in <hi>Fulvius Ursinus,</hi> that it may be easily known what is in him, and what Coins he omits; and consequently, are most rare. But for the better understanding of them, I will premise certain Considerations: as, First, That the <hi>Romans</hi> had ordinarily three Names. <hi>Proenomen,</hi> imposed at the taking the <hi>Toga Virilis</hi> (as the <hi>nomen</hi> was at the <hi>Dies Lustri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cus)</hi> ordinarily said to have been at first thir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teen. <hi>Appius, Decius, Aulus, Caius, Cnaeus, Lu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cius, Manius, Marcus, Publius, Quintus, Sextus, Spurius, Titus.</hi> Others add <hi>Cossus, Tiberius, Caeso</hi> (the <hi>praenomen</hi> of the <hi>Fabia Gens). Numerius, Mamercus</hi> (the <hi>praenomen</hi> of the <hi>Gens AEmilia.)</hi> Their <hi>nomen</hi> or Name of their Family, all of which, or very few excepted, end in <hi>ius,</hi> as <hi>Tul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lius, Vipsanius, Julius, &amp;c.</hi> which was the same as of <hi>Tullus,</hi> of <hi>Vipsanus,</hi> of <hi>Julus, &amp;c.</hi> Their <hi>cognomen</hi> or After-Name from some Action, Country, or Accident: and this was used to divide the Family into its branches, as <hi>Caesar, Cicero, Agrippa, &amp;c.</hi> Some also had an <hi>Agnomen</hi> or Nick-name, but that was but seldom. 2. Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
<pb n="49" facs="tcp:56789:33"/>
the times of the Emperors, the adopted was ordinarily called by the Name of the Family of the Adopter; but afterwards they put the Names of their own Familes first, and after that of the Adopter.</p>
               <p n="3">3. At the foundation of <hi>Rome, Romulus</hi> di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vided all the Families of the Citizens into <hi>Patritios</hi> and <hi>Plebeios. Patritii</hi> were afterwards of two sorts, <hi>Majorum Gentium,</hi> which some say were only of those hundred Families made <hi>Patritii</hi> by <hi>Romulus;</hi> or, as others say, all that were admitted into the Order by any of the Kings. 2. <hi>Minorum Gentium,</hi> which some say were all not called <hi>Patritii</hi> by <hi>Romulus;</hi> others, those only, who were created after the time of the Kings. <hi>Nobiles</hi> were such, whether <hi>Patritii</hi> or <hi>Plebeii,</hi> as could shew the Images of their Ancestors; now none were suffered to have their Statues made, except such as had born the Offices to which belonged a <hi>Sella Curulis.</hi> All the rest, who obtained Offices, how great so<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever, and could not sh<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">

               <p>THE greatest Erudition is contain'd in the Reverses of Medals; for the under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>standing whereof, I shall first set down such general Observations as we find frequently, and upon divers of them: Afterwards when we come to the Emperors, such as are particular to one or few of them.

                  <p>Whilst the Sacrifice was consuming, they first prostrated themselves and prayed; after<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards they sate down as it were in Meditation; as is seen upon Medals.</p>

An Ox ready for Sacrifice commonly signi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fies <hi>Ludos Seculares,</hi> of which hereafter, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in was a most solemn and great Sacrifice of Oxen; tho in <hi>Julians</hi> Coin and some others, it rather seems to refer to the finding of <hi>Apis,</hi> the <hi>Egyptian</hi> holy Ox mentioned by <hi>Marcellinus,</hi> which being Sacred to the Moon, had a spot like her on his side, and his Tail waxed and wained as the Moon.</p>
                  <p>The Oxen to be sacrificed were bound about their Backs and Bellies with certain Rubans, and had on their Heads an <hi>Infula,</hi> which was a kind of woollen Net-work (call'd also <hi>Filamen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ta)</hi> which covered their Heads. The Priests also had the like, and therefore the Sacrificers have always their Heads veiled or covered. Some imagine, that from thence proceeded the fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>shion of Christian Bishops to wear Miters. But this is not probable, for Heathen Priests had not any Covering like a Miter; that Use rather seems to have been taken up in imitation of the Jewish High Priest. Condemned persons also had the like, as the condemned by the In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quisition in <hi>Spain</hi> at this day have, the Martyrs therefore being condemned persons, had the same:</p>

                     </p>
                     <p>It is to be noted, That tho the Tribes seem at first of all to have receiv'd their Names from the Places, yet divers of them had other Names from Persons, as the <hi>Horatia, Papia, Camilla,</hi> &amp;c. were anciently, and <hi>Julia, Flavia, Ulpia,</hi> &amp;c. were modernly Names of some of these Tribes.</p>
                     <p>Also in the Country he built upon the strong<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>est Hills and Places certain Castles, which he call'd <hi>Pagos,</hi> whither the Country-people might resort, and be in safety, in the time of any In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vasion; which <hi>Pagi</hi> also were dedicated to some God, to whom once in the Year all that belong'd to that <hi>Pagus,</hi> Men, Women, and Children, brought a certain piece of Money,
<pb n="126" facs="tcp:56789:64"/>
which was receiv'd by him that had Charge of the <hi>Pagus,</hi> whereby he knew the number of all that belong'd to that <hi>Pagus,</hi> and defray'd the Charges of the Sacrifices and <hi>Pagus.</hi> These Feasts or Holy-days were call'd <hi>Paganalia.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>Afterwards this Manner and Government was quite alter'd; and <hi>Tribus</hi> signified not any place or quantity of Ground with its Inhabi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tants, but a Company of Citizens, Free-men, that lived where they listed; so that persons of one Tribe lived in another: and <hi>Tribus</hi> was not <hi>pars Urbis</hi> as formerly, but <hi>Civitatis.</hi> And this Change happen'd (as it should seem) first, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause most men desired and counted it greater reputation to be (as of honourabler Families, so of) honorabler Tribes. The more honoura<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble were the <hi>Rusticae:</hi> For <hi>Romulus,</hi> to encou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rage Husbandry, committed all sedentary, me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chanick, and sordid Arts to Slaves, Libertines, and Strangers; but Agriculture to Free-men and Citizens, whom he design'd to be the Nursery of his Militia, theirs being a life more active and laborious, and which consequently disposed them better to great Undertakings. Secondly, Because the Adopted passed as well into the Tribe as the Family of the Adopter; whence it came, that great Families remov'd sometimes from one Tribe into another. Thirdly, Because the Censors in process of time came to have power to add new Tribes, and to remove out of one into another. So that Citizens began not to be of the Tribes in which they lived, but of those which it pleased the Censors either to gratifie them withal, or
<pb n="127" facs="tcp:56789:64"/>
to punish them. Hence it is probable, that all of the same great Family got into one Tribe, which perhaps gave the Name to certain Tribes, as <hi>AEmilia, Claudia, Julia,</hi> &amp;c. And <hi>Appius</hi> thus gave leave to all Citizens to enter themselves into what Tribe they pleased; but <hi>Q. Fabius, A. U. C.</hi> 449. finding the abuse which had crept in by <hi>Appius</hi>'s permission; whereby the mean<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>est people (being the greatest part) put them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves into the <hi>Rusticae Tribus,</hi> and so carried all things in the <hi>Comitia</hi> factiously, and to the prejudice of the Commonwealth; he (I say) finding this, transferred all the meanest of the people into the <hi>Tribus Urbanae;</hi> which was ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther Reason, why after him all Persons of Qua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lity sought to avoid being in those Tribes. Fourth<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, Because that persons for Demerits were pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nished by being placed in a lower Tribe, and for Reward advanced to an higher; where, by the way, it seems that one <hi>Rustica</hi> was more ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nourable than another. <hi>Cic. pro Balbo</hi> saith, that <hi>Balbus</hi> was rewarded for accusing and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>victing <hi>N.

Ensigns were 12 Lictors, men carrying each a bundle of Rods or Birchen Switches, and an Hatchet in the midst, which all waited on each of the Consuls his Month by Course, a <hi>Sella Curulis,</hi> a Gown of many colours or <hi>Trabea,</hi> an Ivory Staff or Scepter, on the top whereof was ordinarily an Eagle; sometimes also some<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>what like a Flower-de-lys. At first they were both <hi>Patritii,</hi> afterwards the people by their Obstinacy and Seditions obtained, that one of them should always be a Plebeian.</p>
               <p>§. 3. Next to the Consuls were the Praetors; <note place="margin">Praetors.</note> and indeed at first the Consuls were call'd Prae<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tors; but the multitude of Employment (espe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cially matters of Judicature) increasing, and the Consuls, by reason of foreign Wars, many times absent. <hi>A U.

Wealth of all the Citizens; there-according to rank them into Centuries and Classes. They let out the Customs in the City and in the Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vinces; and made Laws also concerning them. They took care of publick Buildings, and High<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ways, and taxed the Prices of the publick Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crifices. They took care also of the Manners of the Citizens, especially such as were igno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minious, yet not punishable by Law; as Celi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bacy, Perjury, running in Debt, infamous Lusts, and the like; and according to their Demerits punished them, as by casting them out of the Senate, <hi>i. e.</hi> when the Names of the Senators were read at the beginning of the Censorship, such Names were omitted. And so for the <hi>E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quites,</hi> if any so deserved, they took away his publick Horse (for the <hi>Equites</hi> were allow'd a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout an 100 Crowns to buy a Horse, which they were oblig'd always to make good, and about 20 Crowns a year to keep him, and when they had served 10 Campaigns they resto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red him) <hi>i. e.</hi> when the <hi>Equites</hi> shew'd them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves, those who were approv'd the Censors commanded to pass by, and take their Horse with them; but if any so deserv'd, they com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manded his Horse to be sold, and this was cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led <hi>Equi ademptio.</hi> For the Plebeians, when they so deserv'd, they remov'd from a more honourable and Country Tribe into one less honourable and a City Tribe: or else <hi>AErarios relinquebant, sive in Caeritum tabulas referebant, i. e.</hi> they took away their Right of giving Suffrages, yet left them to pay Taxes.

The Kingly Power being expelled, the <note place="margin">Dictator.</note> Consular Power in a short time began to be despised, and the people to be very seditious: Wars also grew upon them dangerously, so that they easily perceiv'd the Government of many was not convenient; and therefore in all great Extremities they were forced to have recourse to the power of one, whom they call'd <hi>Dicta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tor.</hi> He was always a Consular person, and named by the Consul alone in the night sea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son. His Power was absolute and supreme without Appeal from him. All Magistrates, except the Tribunes, then resign'd their Offi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces. He had 24 Lictors, made Peace and War, determined Causes, punished, rewarded, as he thought good: his Power was only for half a year. <hi>L. Sulla</hi> and <hi>C.

Ensigns on Medals signifie sometimes the restitution of such a Legion, or some Honour done by that Legion to the Emperor, or by the Emperor to that Legion.</p>
               <p>A Legion was divided into ten Cohorts, eve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry Cohort had three <hi>Manipuli,</hi> one of the <hi>Ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stati,</hi> another of the <hi>Principes,</hi> a third of the <hi>Triarii</hi> (of these there were never above 600 in a Legion.) <hi>Praetoria Cohors</hi> or the Generals Life-guard, was first chosen by <hi>Scipio</hi> of the valiantest Soldiers, increasing their Pay 2½, and keeping them continually about his Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son. <hi>Augustus</hi> had ordinarily nine of these Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>horts, but at first ten, saith <hi>Dion,</hi> of a 1000 men apiece.

               <p>§. 2. There were sixty Centurions in a Le<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gion, and every one of them had his <hi>Optio</hi> or Lieutenant.

<pb n="155" facs="tcp:56789:78"/>
of a Major General, carrying the Orders of the General or Tribune: he govern'd the Ea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gle, putting it up, and delivering it to the Bea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rer; he was one of the Councel of War; his Pay setled by <hi>Augustus</hi> was about 300 Crowns <hi>per annum,</hi> and after the Service was accounted amongst the <hi>Equites.</hi> A Centurion was known by his <hi>Vitis</hi> or <hi>Flagellum,</hi> wherewith he chasti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed the Soldiers.

               <p>§. 3.

§. 4. The Arms of the <hi>Velites,</hi> or such, as first charged, and kept not Rank and File, nor were reckoned among the Legions, were, a Sword, seven Darts three foot long, headed with Iron, but weakly, that they might bend, and not be thrown back again; a round Buck<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ler <hi>(Parma)</hi> about three foot Diameter of Wood covered with Leather, an Head-piece of Wooll or Skin of some wild Beast.</p>
               <p>The Arms of the <hi>Hastati, Principes,</hi> and <hi>Tria<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rii</hi> were much what the same; only the <hi>Triarii</hi> had instead of the <hi>Pilum,</hi> a Spear, as being to fight <hi>cominus</hi> only. These Arms were,</p>
               <p n="1">1. A Shield or Buckler, sometimes round, Oval, <hi>imbricatum</hi> or equally broad with corners two foot and half broad, and four foot long, to cover the whole Body when stooping, made of Boards, the lighter Wood the better, glued together, and covered with Ox-hide, and edg'd with Iron. Upon their Coins we see often the <hi>Ancilia,</hi> a sort of Shield like to three Ovals clapt the end of one upon another, the least in the midst. The first of these was said to have fallen down from Heaven, and it was prophe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sied, that where that Ancile was kept, there should be the Seat of the Empire of the World; whereupon they made eleven more so like to that first, that none could know the true one: and these were born in their solemn Dances by the <hi>Salii.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="2">2. A Sword (and in later times a Dagger) upon their right side, that it might not hinder their Shield, about two foot and half long in the Blade, and made more for thrusting than cut<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting.</p>
               <p n="3">
                  <pb n="157" facs="tcp:56789:79"/>
3. <hi>Pilum,</hi> one greater about 4 fingers Diame<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter, and long about 7 foot, with its Ironbarbed head, and one lesser like a Hunting Spear.</p>
               <p n="4">4. A brazen Helmet, wherein they wore Feathers or other Crests, not unlike ours, but more upright; the Soldier also sometimes had his Name and the Name of his Legion engra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven upon it.</p>
               <p n="5">5. A Breast-plate, or at least a square piece of Iron or Brass which covered the Breast, cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led <hi>Pectorale;</hi> but those of better Quality had Breast-plates, which were either like Coats of Mail, or plated like ours: the <hi>Sarmatae</hi> made them of Horn or Horse hoofs. Some made them of Linnen Cloth steep'd in sowre Wine and Salt, and quilted, some of Iron, <hi>&amp;c.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="6">6. Boots or Greaves for their Legs.</p>
               <p>§. 5. <hi>Adlocutio</hi> was when the General had any thing to say to the Army, encourage them to fight, compose Mutinies, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> he commonly stood upon a Bank of Turff.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Decursio</hi> was an Exercising of the Soldiers, when they were armed to run so far, to make them expedite and active,</p>
               <p>Victory is commonly described a Womans Head with Wings on the Shoulders; some<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times a Woman winged, crowned with Lau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rel, in one Hand a Crown, in the other a Palm; or sometimes writing upon a Shield, or standing upon a Globe (as if the <hi>Romans</hi> had conquer'd all the World) a Jewel also hanging about her Neck, which they call'd <hi>Bulla,</hi> and was worn by such as triumphed as an honorary Ornament for their Services; and was also
<pb n="158" facs="tcp:56789:80"/>
given to Strangers, sometimes for Service done.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Trophaeum,</hi> was a Memorial set up in sign of Victory, which was the Arms of the Vanquish<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, hung upon a Tree or Perch.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Triumphus,</hi> one drawn in a Chariot with two or four Horses, behind him a small winged Vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctory, holding over his Head a Crown.</p>
               <p>If a Victory by Sea, it is expressed by a Vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctory standing on the Prow of a Ship, or some<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>what belonging to Maritime Affairs, as a <hi>Ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ptune, Trident,</hi> &amp;c. After the Victory obtain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed in the River by the <hi>Romans</hi> against the <hi>An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiates,</hi> they set up the Prows of their Enemies Ships upon a certain place where they made their Orations to the People; which was there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore call'd <hi>Rostra:</hi> Sometimes also in Honour of a Naval Victory, they set up a Pillar with little Beaks of Ships carved upon it, call'd <hi>Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lumna rostrata.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>§. 6. Upon many Coins are expressed the Rewards of such Soldiers as behaved themselves extraordinarily. Such were many times Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ney, Donatives, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> which yet was not entire<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly left to their disposing; but half of it they were obliged to lay up, which was registred and deposited in Chests in the custody of the Ensign-bearers: by which means both their Debauches were prevented, and their Necessi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties supplied: besides, themselves also were ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liged to the Service, and the Generals knew where, in case of necessity, so much Money was ready for their use.</p>
               <p>Such were also Crowns of divers sorts. Of Laurel, used commonly by the General after a
<pb n="159" facs="tcp:56789:80"/>
Victory. Given also by the Senate to <hi>Julius Caesar,</hi> which, he being bald, willingly accepted and used, as did all his Successors, which were <hi>Augusti;</hi> or had absolute Power; but those who were only <hi>Caesares,</hi> did not use them; till <hi>Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stantine</hi> the Great; who chang'd it into a Ru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>band edged with Pearl, and set with Jewels, as it seems by his Coins, and this is not for Effe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minacy, as <hi>Julian</hi> (a continual Carper against him and his Actions) reports: but more pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bably, because the other had its Original from Idolatry; the Laurel being even as a Crown sacred to <hi>Apollo.</hi> However the succeeding Em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perors were so pleased with the Change, that I find not any of them, not <hi>Julian</hi> himself, returning to the ancient Custom.</p>
               <p>A Crown of Gold seems first to have been used about <hi>Theodosius</hi>'s time, and that at first as an Helmet, or some Ornament upon it; hence our <hi>Saxons</hi> call a Crown <hi>Cyne, i. e. Cinings-hel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>met,</hi> the Kings Helmet, but Crowns were of divers fashions; our <hi>Saxon</hi> Kings (as appears by King <hi>Edward</hi>'s Money) used close ones, not much unlike a Miter; but <hi>Francis</hi> I. was the first that used a close or bar'd one in <hi>France.</hi>

               <p>
                  <hi>Obsidionalis,</hi> given by those who were delive<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red from a Siege to those that reliev'd them, and was made of Grass cut up in the place where they were besieged.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Civica,</hi> given by the General to such a Sol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dier as had saved a Citizens life, and slain an Enemy, made of Oaken leaves, set upon his Head by him that was rescued.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Muralis,</hi> given by the General to him that first scaled the Enemies Walls.</p>

                  <hi>Castrensis,</hi> to him that first entred the Enemies Trench or Rampart, and these were both gild<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed; the first also had Battlements, the second only Nicks like Trenches.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Rostrata,</hi> of Gold, given ordinarily to the General, who had gain'd a Naval Victory with great labour and industry.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Navalis,</hi> of Gold given to such a Soldier as first boarded an Enemies Ship.</p>
               <p>If any one killed an Enemy in any Velita<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion or pickering when they fought man to man, he was rewarded with a Spear without a head, call'd <hi>Hasta pura.</hi> The Gods also are frequently described with such in their hands; in imitation whereof perhaps might be that cu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stom in our Country of the Principal Court-Officers, carrying white Rods or Staves, as En<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>signs of their places.</p>
               <p>If any one had done a more valiant and singular Action; if a Foot-Soldier, he had a Bracelet given him; if an Horse-man, a Chain made with Links or Rings to wear about his Neck (whence seems to proceed the Honour of wearing Gold Chains) or <hi>Phalerae,</hi> which seem not to have been Trappings, as we call them, but rather Plates hanging down upon the Breast of the Horse.</p>

                  </gap> were their great Fairs or Mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kets; all sorts of Contentions, as Running, Leaping, Chariot-driving, Wrestling, Disputes in Philosophy. <hi>Quinquennale certamen, more Grae<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>co, triplex, Musicum, Gymnicum, Equestre.

This manner of Vowing was in use amongst the Ancients, when any of their Generals went to War, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> See the form of it in <hi>Liv. l.</hi> 36. when they undertook the War against <hi>Antiochus.

and of these there were divers sorts: Not to mention the <hi>Munera</hi> which were given for the Solemnization of Funerals and other occasions; and were Fightings of Gladiators, or men with Beasts, and the like. <hi>Ludi</hi> or Games, some were at the Charges of private Persons, some at the publick.

                  <hi>Augustus</hi> used great diligence to find out the exact and precise times of celebrating these Plays, but the succeeding Princes rather followed their own Fancy than any Reason or strict Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>putation; for <hi>Claudius Caesar, A.

Chariot-Races were <hi>Bigarum, Trigarum, Quadrigarum:</hi> at first they used other Beasts, afterwards Horses only, which in their <hi>Bigae</hi> were, 1. white, the other black: in the <hi>Trigae</hi> there was another Horse joyned, whom they call'd <hi>Funalis, quia funibus vel loramentis adnexus.</hi> The Chariotiers were call'd <hi>Aurigae</hi> and <hi>Agita<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tores;</hi> and their Companies were call'd <hi>Factio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nes:</hi> at first but two colour'd Livories, white and red, afterwards were added <hi>Prasina</hi> or green much affected by <hi>Caius, Nero, L.

<pb n="158" facs="tcp:56789:88"/>
under the <hi>Domini factionum,</hi> who maintained and hired them out for gain.</p>
               <p>Their Horse-Races were either of single Hor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ses or <hi>Desultorii;</hi> when one man had two Hor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ses unsadled, and leaped down from the one upon the other in his Course. Such the Sol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diers also had many times in War to make use of a second, when the first was weary or woun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded. The <hi>Singulares</hi> also ran sometimes them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves for the Prize; sometimes they rid before or beside the Chariots, to encourage and direct them.</p>

               <p>Running was perform'd after the Chariot and Horse-Races, and much what in the same manner.</p>
               <p>Fencing, <hi>Pugilatus,</hi> was fighting with Fists, commonly armed with a <hi>Caestus,</hi> which was made of Thongs of Leather, studded with Iron or Lead, and fastened about their Hands and Arms. It is described in <hi>AEneid.</hi> 5.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Luctatio,</hi> Wrestling, this they did naked, and their Bodies anointed.</p>
               <p>Leaping and Quoiting, or the <hi>Discus,</hi> were not much used in the <hi>Circus,</hi> but are rather to be reckoned amongst ordinary Sports and Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ercises.</p>
               <p n="3">3. The next was call'd <hi>Pompa,</hi> which was ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther a solemn Procession, perform'd in this manner. From the Temple of <hi>Jupiter Capito<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>linus</hi> through the <hi>Forum</hi> to the <hi>Circus</hi> descended in Ranks and Order: 1. The Magistrate who began the <hi>Pompa;</hi> next all the <hi>Roman</hi> Nobility,
<pb n="159" facs="tcp:56789:88"/>
and the Sons of <hi>Equites</hi> on Horse-back, the rest on Foot, marching as to War; next followed the Chariots, Horses, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> that were to run; next the <hi>Athletae;</hi> then three Companies of Dancers, Men, Youths, and Boys, decently ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med and habited, imitating the <hi>Saltatio Pyrri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chia</hi> or Military Dance. These were followed by those who danced <hi>a la Satyresca,</hi> some repre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>senting <hi>Sileni,</hi> others Satyrs, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> then followed certain Musitians after the ancient manner. Then the Ministers of the Priests carrying all things necessary for Sacrifices. Then the Ima<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ges of their Gods, the chiefest carried upon <hi>Thensae;</hi> they were followed with the <hi>Arma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maxi</hi> or Chariots armed after the <hi>Scythian</hi> man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner, adorned with divers sorts of Arms, and the Memorials of their Emperors and Generals. Next all the Colleges of the Priests with the <hi>Rex Sacrorum,</hi> and the rest of their holy Offi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cers; and last of all the chiefest Magistrates then in the City, with the rest of the Magi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>strates.</p>
               <p>In this Order they marched into and round about the <hi>Circus,</hi> when the chief Magistrate present commanded the Sacrifices to be made to those Gods, and upon those Altars, as was requisite; which being rightly performed, the <hi>Ludi</hi> or Games began, the Magistrates and Of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficers all taking their places.</p>
               <p n="4">4. Hunting, sometimes Fighting with wild Beasts by those they call'd <hi>Bestiarii</hi> (tho this was more properly a <hi>Munus)</hi> these Beasts were kept in <hi>Vivario.</hi>

The Skirmishes and Fightings on Horse<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>back, on Foot, and <hi>Naumachiae</hi> were chiefly ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hibited by <hi>Julius Caesar</hi> and the succeeding Em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perors, nothing in them difficult to be under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stood.</p>
               <p>The <hi>Pompae</hi> and <hi>Naumachiae</hi> seem to have ceased in <hi>Constantine</hi>'s time, the one being pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hibited as Heathenish, the other falling of it self after the Emperors resided in the East. But the others seem to have continued till <hi>Justi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stinian</hi>'s time, when the Invasion of the <hi>Goths</hi> and other Barbarous Nations gave them some<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>what else to think on.</p>
               <p>Many of these Games were also celebrated in the Amphiheatres, as Huntings; where they made sometimes artificial Mountains and Woods to represent the Hunting more lively. <hi>Martial. l.</hi> 1. <hi>Ep.</hi> 21.

               <p>§ 1. C. <hi>Octavius</hi> Son of <hi>Octavius</hi> and <hi>Atia,</hi> Grand-child of <hi>Julia</hi> the Sister of <hi>Jul. Caesar,</hi> was born upon Mount <hi>Palatine ad Capita bubula,</hi> though the chief Habitation of this Family was at <hi>Velitrae,</hi> A. U. C. 690. before the Birth of our Lord sixty two Years, <hi>Sept.</hi> 22. having the Sign Capricorn presiding in his Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tivity; whereby (as the Astrologers said) he
<pb n="169" facs="tcp:56789:93"/>
was promised the Empire of the World, and to be a God after his death; for they held that ♋ and vs were the two ports of Heaven: by vs the Souls of Heroes descended and ascended; by ♋ those of extraordinary Persons, which made <hi>Augustus</hi> put a Capricorn upon his Coins.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Julius Caesar</hi> his great Uncle adopted him in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to the <hi>Julian</hi> Family, whereby he obtained the Command, Wealth, good Fortune and Popu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>larity, as well as the Name, of <hi>Caesar:</hi> hereup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on we find upon many of his Coins <hi>C. Caesar Divi Filius.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Julius Caesar</hi> was Murthered when <hi>Octavius</hi> was about nineteen years old, and in the Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>try; whereupon he hasted to <hi>Rome,</hi> and against the Advice of most of his Friends and Kindred, resolved to take upon him the Name and Inhe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritance of <hi>Caesar.</hi> Where <hi>M. Antony</hi> then Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sul, though pretending to revenge <hi>Caesar</hi>'s death, received him very proudly; but <hi>Antony</hi> present<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly after designing for himself against the Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monwealth was forced by him to fly into <hi>Gallia</hi> to <hi>Lepidus,</hi> and quit the Siege of <hi>Brutus</hi> at <hi>Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dena. Antony</hi> having got Power, sent to <hi>Caesar,</hi> that if he would join with him and <hi>Lepidus</hi> to revenge the Death of <hi>Caesar,</hi> they would make themselves III <hi>Viri</hi> in Imitation of <hi>Caesar, Pom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pey</hi> and <hi>Crassus,</hi> who had done the same before; if not, they would join with <hi>Brutus</hi> and that Party against him; whereupon he assented, and they took upon them the <hi>Triumvirate,</hi> and ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny Coins were stamped, some in honor of each of them, some in honor of them all together; as that with three Hands conjoined, and the
<pb n="170" facs="tcp:56789:94"/>
Ensigns of Supreme Power, <hi>Fasces, Caduceus Orbe,</hi> &amp;c.</p>
               <p>Presently thereupon <hi>Caesar</hi> went against <hi>Sex. Pompeius</hi> the Son of <hi>Pompey</hi> the Great, who by his Fautors (who were many in the Senate) was made Governor of the Sea Coast, and had a great Navy; which <hi>Caesar</hi> overcame in <hi>Sicily.</hi> Of this <hi>Sextus Pompeius</hi> are many Coins stamp'd with some relation to Sea-matters, as with a Neptune, prow of a Ship, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> and of <hi>Caesar</hi> his Victory over him, and Conquest of <hi>Sicily.</hi> Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny also of the other III <hi>Viri</hi> either with the names of the Mint-masters, <hi>Quaestor,</hi> or some other of their Officers.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Caesar</hi>'s Coin is often reversed with a Thun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derbolt, either to represent his own terribleness in War, or the assistance from Heaven, (parti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cularly from <hi>Julius</hi> his Father) which, as they say, he often experienced in the Wars; and especially in that fatal and decisive Battel at <hi>Actium,</hi> whereby he became Master of the whole <hi>Roman</hi> Empire, and in Memory of which he repaired the decaied Temple of <hi>Apollo</hi> there, and dedicated his own Image in the habit of <hi>Apollo Actius</hi> in a long Robe, his Harp, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> (pretending to be his Son) in the Library of the Palace.</p>
               <p>After the Battel of <hi>Actium</hi> he returned to <hi>Rome,</hi> and there put it to the question amongst his Friends, whether he should restore to the Commonwealth its ancient Liberty, or take upon himself the absolute Sovereignty, and constitute a Monarchy. After much debate the latter was resolved; and withal to avoid that
<pb n="171" facs="tcp:56789:94"/>
Rock which had split many others, and of late his Father <hi>Julius;</hi> he determined to abst<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">

               <p>§ 2. So then whereas anciently the eldest of the Censors or <hi>Viri Censorii</hi> (such as had been Censors) was called <hi>Princeps Senatus;</hi> and after<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards such were chosen by the Censors in their Quinquennial Muster, commonly the most ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cellent and eminent Persons, as <hi>Scipio</hi> the <hi>Afri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>can</hi> continued so all his life time; <hi>Octavius</hi> chu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed to be called by that name, as of chiefest ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nor amongst all the Senators. [The same Cu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stom was also observed amongst the <hi>Equites</hi> and <hi>Pedites,</hi> and amongst the Youth also; where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore the young <hi>Caesars,</hi> (and some few for Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nors sake before the Emperors called <hi>Principes Juventutis,)</hi> we find frequently called <hi>Principes Juventutis;</hi> but afterwards it became a Title of the young Sons or Heirs of the Emperors] be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sides this he was always one of the Consuls, (or else put in whom he might trust) and named the other also: So you see upon the Coins of the Emperors, <hi>Cos.</hi> II.

                  </gap>ir Enemies: yet afterwards it came to denote him who commanded all the Forces of the Commonwealth in Chief.</p>
               <p>The Senate being prone to Flattery, most of them expecting Preferment from him, heap'd upon him all the honorary Titles that had be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore been bestowed upon others; amongst the rest, that of <hi>Pater Patriae</hi> or P P. which at first was bestowed upon <hi>Cicero</hi> for discovering and defeating the Conspiracy of <hi>Catiline.</hi> They called him also <hi>Augustus,</hi> a Term applied be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore time only to the Gods or Heroes; as if he had somewhat above Humane in him.</p>
               <p>And in after-times <hi>Augustus</hi> signified him that was invested in the whole absolute Power of Emperor; and <hi>Caesar,</hi> who was designed to be, but not actually invested in the Majesty of the Emperor. None but he that was <hi>Augustus</hi> de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>signed in Medals with a Crown of Laurel; the Title of <hi>Semper Augustus,</hi> or <hi>perpet. Augustus</hi> not found before <hi>Diocletian</hi> and <hi>Maximianus.</hi> When an Emperor with Raies about his Head, it should seem to signifie that he was conse<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crated by some City or other, and that that Coin was made after such Consecration.</p>
               <p>§. 3. Being Consul his Sentences might be hindered and interrupted by the Tribune of the People; to prevent which, he assumed also <hi>Tribunitiam potestatem</hi> (for Tribune he could not be and <hi>Pontifex Maximus,</hi> say some, because the one must needs be a Plebeian, the other a Patri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cian, which is false, for <hi>P. Scaevola</hi> was <hi>Trib. Plebis</hi> and <hi>Pont. Max.</hi> which yet <hi>Tully</hi> com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plaineth of, as dangerous to have two such
<pb n="173" facs="tcp:56789:95"/>
Powers conjoyn'd in one Person, <hi>l.</hi> 12. <hi>Ep. ad Attic.</hi> 5.) the which was renewed every Year; by which means also his Person was Sacred and Inviolable; and by which means also, tho not Consul, yet every Sitting of the Senate he might propose one Cause or Matter to them, tho this Power was after enlarged to the succeeding Emperors, of referring (or putting to the Vote) four or also five Causes every Sitting, <hi>V. Dio. l.</hi> 54. <hi>Capitol &amp; Vopisc.</hi> themselves also sometimes voted first of all, and that often with an Oration spoken commonly by their Quaestors; and such Decrees were said <hi>Principe Authore fieri;</hi> some<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times last of all, and so had power of mitigating or qualifying the Sentences of the Fathers. Some say, that <hi>Tr. P.</hi> with the Year, was the time of the Emperor's Reign, but that is false; for, tho very rarely, it was communicated to another besides the Emperor: As there is men<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion <hi>Tib.</hi> TR. P. XXXVIII. but the certain year of their Government was known by the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>paring of the times of their Titles together.</p>
               <p>Because that Religion hath great Force upon Mens Minds, he would not suffer that to be in another's Power; and therefore after <hi>Lepidus</hi>'s Death he made himself <hi>Pont. Max.</hi> which all his Successors constantly observed till <hi>Constantine,</hi> who refused it: Yet <hi>Julian</hi> resumed it again, and was initiated with divers nasty Ceremonies; but <hi>Gratian</hi> absolutely refused it, as unlawful for a Christian (saith <hi>Zosimus)</hi> he means a <hi>Lay-Christian,</hi> and never after any received it.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Augustus</hi> also made himself Pro-Consul, which, tho it appears not on his Medals, that I know,
<pb n="174" facs="tcp:56789:96"/>
yet it is in old Inscriptions; and <hi>Elagabalus</hi> in <hi>Ep. apud Dionem,</hi> calls himself <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap>. <hi>Pro-Cos.</hi> which I know not whether it was, that he might command also the other Provinces, or that the <hi>Pro Cos.</hi> might know that they governed under the Power of <hi>Caesar,</hi> who was the chiefest <hi>Pro-Cos.</hi> and therefore whereas all other <hi>Pro-Cos.</hi> laid down their Power and Ensigns before they entered the City, the Prince retained his Pro-Consular Power in the City. So <hi>M. Aure<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lius</hi> having married <hi>Faustina,</hi> had given him <hi>Trib. pot. &amp; Imperium Pro-Cos. extra urbem,</hi> saith <hi>Capitolinus.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>And thus he conjoyned in his own Person all the Supreme Offices and Employments in the Commonwealth, without any sensible change of the Laws and Customs formerly observed. And his Successors trod in the same Steps; some notwithstanding referring more, some less to the Senate.</p>
               <p>§. 4. <hi>Augustus</hi> himself gave the Senate leave to dispose of such Provinces, <hi>(Strabo</hi> l. 17. 12. Two Pro-consular, <hi>Asia</hi> and <hi>Africk,</hi> Ten <hi>Prae<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>torian,</hi> two whereof <hi>Tiberius</hi> afterward resumed) and Offices as were Peaceable, or not likely to create any trouble; but reserved to himself all those where there were any Wars or Commo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions, upon pretence of giving them the Plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sure and Profit, and himself the Trouble. But, indeed, that he might keep all the Soldiers in his own Power, under such Legates (Lieute<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nants) as he could trust; after the Resolution fixed of taking upon him the sole Government, he referred it to the Senate; by some of whom
<pb n="175" facs="tcp:56789:96"/>
for Interest, some for Fear, some out of Judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, it was voted for him for ten Years; and after those, the Power was again renewed for other ten Years; and so for every ten Years as long as he lived; which was observed also by his Successors.</p>

He had furthermore Honors decreed by most Provinces and Colonies, as appeareth by the Medals; as of <hi>Alexandria</hi> in <hi>Egypt; Raeme<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>talces</hi> King of <hi>Thrace; Gnossians</hi> with their Laby<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rinth; <hi>Cydonians</hi> (Citizens of <gap reason="foreign">

               <p n="1">1. <hi>HAdrianus</hi> was born A. C. 77. reigned 20 Years, eleven Months X died aged Sixty three Years X was in all Arts and Sciences the most knowing Man of his time; but with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>al so Ambitious, Envious and Jealous of the Reputation of his Knowledge, that he could not brook any one should pretend to equal him; and for this cause some he put to Death. Historians report him, yet he seemeth not to have been, of a Cruel Disposition; for tho he put many to Death, yet there were also many Conspiracies against him, especially the first and last Years of his Reign. And to <hi>Nigrinus</hi> (one of those he executed) he designed the Succession in the Empire, and <hi>de facto</hi> adopted his Son in Law <hi>AElius.</hi> He was, or at least seemed to be, extremely Devout towards the Gods; forbidding all Human Sacrifices; build<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing many Temples, and in many of them placing no Statues (which Temples were called <hi>Hadriania,)</hi> some to our Lord Jesus Christ, as admiring his great Miracles. He forgave the People a great Summ of Money due to the Exchequer, of which a Medal—<hi>Reliqua vetera Sestertium novies millies abolita:</hi> And giving great <hi>Congiaria,</hi> was called by the Senate, <hi>Opti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mus Maximus<expan>

he afterwards betook himself to the Physicians; being in very great Pain he grew Mad, and commanded many Senators to be slain, who were saved by <hi>Antoninus</hi> called there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore <hi>Pius.</hi> For the recovery of his Phrensie, he went to <hi>Oreste,</hi> which he therefore called <hi>Hadri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>anopolis.</hi> He visited almost all the Provinces of the Empire, on foot, with great Labour and Pains, going always bare-headed: To many of them he was a Benefactor, as appears by his Medals, especially to <hi>Africk,</hi> where, it seems, his Father was Pro-praetor; whose Figure, with his Mothers <hi>Domitia Paulina</hi>'s, seems to be that with two Heads, <hi>Divis Parentibus.</hi>

West. The Christians quite contrary prayed toward the AEquinoctial East, as <hi>Sidonius</hi> saith.

C. 127. reigned about four Months, died aged 67 Years four Months, more or less, slain by the <hi>Praetorian</hi> Soldiers, his Guards. He was very Prudent, Learned, Eloquent, Valiant, Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stant, of a present Spirit, Moderate, Just, so Frugal that he seemed Avaritious. A very skill<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful and experienced Soldier; was very averse from receiving the Empire, put upon him by the Murderers of <hi>Commodus;</hi> In the Senate pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferring others before himself, hindering his Wife as much as he could from being called <hi>Augusta,</hi> and his Son from being <hi>Caesar;</hi> saying, <hi>That it was sufficient that himself reigned against his will.</hi> Whether discouraged by his obscure Birth, his old Age, or the Licentious Times, is unknown. He endeavored with great Labor, Vigilance, Courage and Dexterity, to settle the Common<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wealth in good order; repressing the Insolen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cies of the Soldiers, banishing and punishing all the Ministers of Tyranny, bestowing the wast and untilled Grounds upon such as would hus<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>band them; saying, <hi>That those Possessions were the Commonwealths, not the Emperors;</hi> taking away illegal Taxes; selling all <hi>Commodus</hi>'s Su<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perfluous and Luxurious Statues, Eunuchs and
<pb n="231" facs="tcp:56789:124"/>
Houshold-stuff to pay a Largess to the Soldiers and Citizens; recovering vast Sums of Money which <hi>Commodus</hi> had sent to the <hi>Barbarians</hi> to buy Peace of them; retrenching the Expences of his House. And it is almost incredible what Reformations he made in those few Months of his Reign.</p>

But hereby he incurred the hate of the People, (whom at first he despised, but afterwards slew many of them by his Soldiers) and the Senate; where entring, he made an insolent and foolish Oration in Commendation of himself.

               <p n="1">1. L. <hi>Septimius Severus,</hi> Son of <hi>L. Sept. Geta,</hi> and <hi>Fulvia Pia,</hi> was born at <hi>Laeptis,</hi> A. D. 147. reigned seventeen Years, eight Months, three Days; and died at Sixty five Years, nine Months, twenty three Days old; was very Active, Vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gilant, Couragious, Indefatigable, Provident, (especially for Provision) of good Understand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, and a Lover of Learning, tho himself not Learned; but withal most horribly Am<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bitious, Traiterous, Cruel, Covetous and Vin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dicative, more than any of his Predecessors, having put to Death Forty of the eminentest Persons of the Empire at once, without hear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing their Cause, upon Suspition of their Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>spiring with <hi>Albinus;</hi> for which, being ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceedingly hated, he endeavoured to engage the Soldiers to himself, by giving them many Gifts, and Licences to wear Gold Rings, to have Wives with them, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> the cause of much Misery and Ruine of the Empire, and even of himself; for as soon as <hi>Caracalla</hi> came into his Youth, they began to cast their Eyes upon him, and neglect <hi>Severus;</hi> made <hi>Caracalla Augustus</hi> in despight of him; which so heightned him, that he continually sought to kill his Father, some<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times by Poyson, sometimes by the Sword;
<pb n="237" facs="tcp:56789:127"/>
which so enraged the Gouty Old Man, that his Disease increased exceedingly, and became so insupportable, that he would have killed himself, but was hindered; and at last eat so enormously on purpose that he died upon it, after he had in vain endeavoured to punish his Son, whom he mortally hated. Dying he said, <hi>Omnia fui, &amp; nihil expedit.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Diis Auspicibus,</hi> &amp;c. <hi>Col.</hi> II. <hi>Hercules</hi> and <hi>Bac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chus</hi> with a Dog. <hi>Severus</hi> going to fight in the East against <hi>Niger,</hi> purposing also to invade the <hi>Parthians</hi> and <hi>Indians,</hi> Sacrificed to these two Gods, under whose <hi>Auspicia</hi> [Standards] of the one, as a Victor over Tyrants, of the other, as over the <hi>Indians. Auspicia</hi> also they called the Sacrifices they made the day of their entering their Office or Employment. The Heroes anciently were said to have Dogs with them; both because of their Fidelity, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> and of their Divination; they attributing much to their Barking, Howling or Fawning. <hi>Hercules</hi>'s Dog, crushing a Purple Fish, discovered to <hi>Her<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cules</hi> that excellent Die.</p>

(to whom he was much given) that her Horoscope was, that she should be married to an Emperor, was never quiet till he obtained her. She was very Beautiful, Learned and of great Capacity; wherefore he consulted with her in all Affairs of Consequence, and put her Name in all his Letters and Missives to the Senate: She also saluted all as <hi>Severus</hi> and <hi>Caracalla</hi> did. He did not love her, being she was exceeding Proud, Arrogant, Malicious, Cunning, Quarrelsome, and given to her Lusts and Pleasures. Yet did he not control her, tho she conspired to take away his Life. After the Death of <hi>Severus,</hi> she endeavoured all she could to reconcile the two Brothers; till at last <hi>Geta</hi> was killed by his Brother in her Lap, which also she durst not resent, nor Lament, for fear he should kill her also; as he would have done, had he not feared an universal Revolt. When <hi>Caracalla</hi> was slain by <hi>Martialis</hi> the Friend of <hi>Macrinus,</hi> she fell into bitter passi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>onate words against <hi>Macrinus;</hi> and would have killed her self, but the Blow was not Mortal: But after that <hi>Macrinus</hi> had treated her well, she took heart, till her words and endeavours to get the Army from him were told him; then he sent her word to retire her self whither she pleased; but she chused rather to starve her self to Death. She had two Sons, <hi>Caracalla</hi> in the first year of her Marriage; to whom she was never married, as some Historians report, and <hi>Geta.</hi>

When <hi>Camillus</hi> would have made him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>self Emperor, he accorded to him that Honor at his Table, and every other Place, carrying him along to the Wars with him, and inviting him to take pains, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> according to his Exam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple; which so wearied <hi>Camillus</hi> that he desired leave to retire, and so did. He changed all <hi>Elagab</hi>'s Officers, which he had set in all the Empire. He forbad all vicious Persons to sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lute and come to him; but good Men he visi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted even in their own Houses, especially when Sick. To Courtiers and Smoak-sellers he was an implacable Enemy; stifling one of them with Smoak because he Sold Smoak. He would not have any Panegyrick made in his Praise.</p>

Army consisted of Seventy thousand Men at <hi>Emesa,</hi> where, after a sore and bloody Battle, he forced them to fly: Afterwards he took her and <hi>Palmyra,</hi> where treating them severely, as soon as he was gone from them into <hi>Europe</hi> fighting against the <hi>Carpi,</hi> they rebelled, so that he returned and ruined the City entirely: Thence he went into <hi>Egypt</hi> against <hi>Firmius,</hi> whom he took and slew: Thence against <hi>Te<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tricus:</hi> Thence he went to <hi>Rome</hi> and triumphed, leading with him twenty Nations Captives; where after having settled the Commonwealth, and made many good Laws; he marched against the <hi>Persians</hi> relieving <hi>Ausburg</hi> by the way; but being near <hi>Byzantium,</hi> he was slain by <hi>Mucapor</hi> suborned by his ungrateful Secre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tary <hi>Mnestheus,</hi> whom he had threatned to pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nish for some Fault; fearing therefore his Dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pleasure, he shewed the Mutinousest Heads of the Army a Counterfeit List of such Names as <hi>Aurelian</hi> intended to put to death, by that means inciting them against him. The Army (which loved him exceedingly because of his Valor and Bounty) executed his Murtherers, and built him a Magnificent Tomb in the place wherein he was slain, and sent to the Senate to chuse a new Emperor, which they did after six Months.

               <p>His Wife was <hi>Severina,</hi> as appeareth by the Medals, for Historians neither name nor speak much of her; only they say, that one time she desired leave of her Husband to wear a Skarlet Silk Gown, which he would not per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mit: Saying, that it was a Shame to buy Threads as dear as Gold, for at that time one Pound of that Silk was equal in value to one Pound of Gold.

The Soldiers and Senate complimented one another for six Months about the Choice of an Em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peror; at last the Senate chose this, a very Prudent, Wise, Valiant, Moderate, Clement Person, and though Aged, yet Vigorous; for which Action they were exceedingly joyed, as if their Ancient Power had been returned them. He took well that the Senate at his request denied to make his Brother Consul. He gave all the Money he had, which was a very great Summ, immediately to the Soldiers: He un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dertook an Expedition against the <hi>Goths,</hi> who (having been sent for by <hi>Aurelian</hi> to help him against the <hi>Persians,</hi> and finding him dead) had
<pb n="303" facs="tcp:56789:160"/>
seized upon the Provinces near to <hi>Pontus;</hi> where he conquered them in two Battles. He severely punished all who had hands in the Murther of <hi>Aurelian;</hi> returning back towards <hi>Europe,</hi> finding so many laid wait for his Life, he died out of Melancholly, as is supposed.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Conservator Militum</hi> Suorum; for had not he accepted the Empire, the Soldiers had either been disbanded or grown Licentious.</p>
               <p n="3">3. <hi>M.

               <p>§. 1. C. <hi>Valer. Diocletianus</hi> (called before <hi>Dio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cles)</hi> was born of his Father a Freed<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man of <hi>Anulinus</hi> a Senator, and his Mother called <hi>Dioclea,</hi> in <hi>Dioclea</hi> a City of <hi>Dalmatia</hi> a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout A. D. 245. reigned twenty Years, quitted the Empire and lived retired in his own Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>try nine Years. Afterwards killed himself for fear of <hi>Constantine</hi> and <hi>Licinius</hi> at the Age of
<pb n="312" facs="tcp:56789:165"/>
sixty eight Years; was extraordinary Cunning and Subtile, distrustful of his Friends, horribly Cruel and Insolent, making himself be called God and Jupiter; also <hi>Dominus</hi> a Name hateful to the <hi>Romans,</hi> and clothed with the greatest Splendor possible. To encourage the Worship of himself he endeavored to extirpate Christi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>anity. From a private Soldier he came to be Master of the Palace to <hi>Carus</hi> and <hi>Numerian,</hi> and finding <hi>Numerian</hi> Murdered by <hi>Aper,</hi> he pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sently slew him, upon which the Soldiers pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>claimed him Emperor. His horrid Cruelties (which notwithstanding he sought to father upon <hi>Maximian)</hi> obscured his good Actions; the Persecution against the Christians he began upon occasion of an Oracle of <hi>Apollo,</hi> who said he could not speak truth because of the Just; he asking who were those Just, it was answer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed the Christians: thereupon he began to per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>secute them, and spared not his own Wife <hi>Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rena,</hi> or any of his Friends who refused to wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ship Idols. But seeing the great number of Christians, he ordained to put out one of their Eyes. Seeing it impossible for one Man to defend the Empire, he chused <hi>Val. Maximianus</hi> his old Acquaintance, and asterward <hi>Galerius Maximianus</hi> and <hi>Constantius: Maximian</hi> he sent into <hi>Gallia</hi> against <hi>Amandas</hi> and <hi>AElianus,</hi> Rebels, whom he Conquered; but was forced to com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pound with <hi>Carausius</hi> who reigned in <hi>Britanny.</hi> Mean while <hi>Diocletian</hi> Conquered <hi>Achilleus</hi> in <hi>Egypt,</hi> and afterwards sent <hi>Maximianus</hi> against some Rebels in <hi>Africk</hi> whom he reduced; and <hi>Galerius Maximianus</hi> against the <hi>Persians</hi> who beat

him; but returning with more Strength upon them he Conquered them. <hi>Diocletian</hi> went against the <hi>Saracens.</hi> The great Cause of their good Fortune was their Concord (which out<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wardly was inviolable, though there was in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward Grudgings amongst them all) by the Authority and Cunning of <hi>Diocletian;</hi> who at last seeing the great Success of <hi>Galerius,</hi> and the Valor and good Fortune of Young <hi>Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stantine,</hi> began to suspect his own Condition; and fearing in his old Age to come to misery by one or other of those young Men, he quit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted the Empire at <hi>Nicomedia; Herculius Maxi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mianus</hi> doing the same the same day at <hi>Milan,</hi> both using the same words, <hi>Recipe Jupiter quod commodasti.</hi> He died, some say, in continual Apprehensions of being destroyed by Light<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning, which his Palace once was; others say that <hi>Constantine</hi> Marrying his Sister to <hi>Licinius,</hi> invited him to the Marriage; which he refu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sing, they sent some threatening words; in as much as he favored <hi>Maximian</hi> and <hi>Maxen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tius;</hi> fearing therefore they should put him to some shameful Death, he poisoned himself.</p>

But at first he pretended only to reform and establish the Commonwealth, to restrain his Son, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> Mean while <hi>Galerius Maximianus</hi> had made one <hi>Severus Caesar,</hi> and sent him into <hi>Italy</hi> with a puissant Army against <hi>Max<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>entius,</hi> who bribing his Soldiers, defeated him, and afterwards slew him at <hi>Ravenna;</hi> which to Revenge <hi>Galerius</hi> came in Person, but re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turned without doing any thing. <hi>Maximian</hi> hereupon thinking the Crimes of his Son ren<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dred him Odious, came into the Army, ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rangued them, and endeavored to pluck the Purple from his Son; but the Army took a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainst him, baffled, and would have killed him, had he not excused himself by saying, That what he did was to try their Constancy and Affection to his Son. Thence he went to <hi>Illyricum,</hi> where he was also rejected, and at last to <hi>Constantine</hi> to whom he married his Daughter <hi>Maximiana Fausta,</hi> yet perfidiously sought to Murder him; which he could not bring about by reason of the great Affection both Soldiers and People bore to <hi>Constantine,</hi> to whom it was at last revealed by his Wife; which <hi>Maximian</hi> knowing, fled first to <hi>Arles,</hi> thence to <hi>Marseilles,</hi> where endeavoring to escape, he was caught and strangled by the command of <hi>Constantine.</hi>

               <p n="1">1. <hi>FL. Valer.

He was <hi>Magnus</hi> and <hi>Maximus,</hi> because of his very great Dignity and Power; nothing laid to his Charge, but that he was too severe, espe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cially towards those of his own Family, ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving put to death his Son <hi>Crispus,</hi> (though for a Pretext he served himself of the Accusation of his Wife <hi>Maxim.

So that <hi>Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stantine</hi> seems to have been too Ambitious and Covetous of Honor, jealous of his State and Dignity; and Bloody sometimes in his Hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mour, especially in his declining Age. He was also too Negligent in his Expences, and
<pb n="334" facs="tcp:56789:176"/>
not sufficiently capable to prefer Persons of best Worth to publick Charges; though Cruel to his own Relations and Family, putting <hi>Lici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nius</hi> to death, Poysoning <hi>Crispus,</hi> stifling <hi>Fausta</hi> his Wife in a Bath; yet was he not at all Cruel in his own Nature; abolishing that cruel man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner of death, Crucifying; not taking Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venge of the <hi>Egyptians</hi> for defaceing his Statues.</p>

                  <hi>Constantine</hi>'s first Wife was <hi>Minervina,</hi> whom he married, being a Young Man, and the Son only of <hi>Constantius Caesar;</hi> with whom he lived in great Continence; and had by her <hi>Crispus.</hi>

At length being frequently solicited to Wick<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>edness by <hi>Fausta</hi> his Mother-in-law, and he re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fusing her, she turned her Love into Hatred; she accused him falsly to <hi>Constantine,</hi> to have endeavored to force her, who either really, or for some other private Consideration, feign<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to believe her, condemned him to dye with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out hearing him speak in his Justification; and accordingly he was put to death by Poyson. But <hi>Helena,</hi> Grand-mother to <hi>Crispus,</hi> being exceedingly grieved, and blaming her Son very much for that unjust Action; he enquired secretly concerning the Accusation, and ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving discovered the Truth, he commanded his Wife <hi>Fausta</hi> to be stifled in a Bath over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>heated.</p>

After she was dead they say, that <hi>Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stantine</hi> would not vouchsafe her Burial, but caused her Carcass to be carried to the top of an high Mountain to be eaten by Fowls and Beasts; and that her Sons afterwards buried her Bones with their Father. She was a <hi>Pagan,</hi> and had that Reputation with her Husband after his Victory over <hi>Maxentius,</hi> that she perswaded him again to Idolatry; wherein notwithstanding he staid not long.</p>

It is reported by some Authors, that <hi>Constan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tius</hi> and his Brother caused <hi>Constantine</hi> to be poisoned in a Bath; but <hi>Constantine</hi> coming to the Knowledge of it, writ to his Son <hi>Constantius</hi> to dispatch him out of the way; which he did shortly after, making him be slain by the Sol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diers a little while after he had taken Possession of the Empire.</p>
               <p>His first Wives name was <hi>Galla (Flav. Anicia Galla)</hi> by whom he had two Sons, the eldest slain with his Father, the other <hi>(Gallus)</hi> put to death by <hi>Constantius</hi> for his evil Govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment.</p>

But <hi>Constantius</hi> kept the Messengers in the Court, and hasted with all Diligence and Secrecy, so that he surprised <hi>Vetranio,</hi> who was forced to joyn his Army with <hi>Constantius.

<pb n="344" facs="tcp:56789:181"/>
declared him a private Man. <hi>Constantius</hi> then sent him to <hi>Constantinople,</hi> and in <hi>Bithynia</hi> assigned him a House and sufficient Revenues; where he lived contentedly six Years after<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards, and very Holily: He reigned about ten Months.</p>

He pretended to be a Christian, yet permitted the Idolaters their Night-Sacrifices; used Magick and Inchantments. He was Colonel of the two principal Legions <hi>(Jovian</hi> and <hi>Herculian)</hi> of <hi>Constans</hi>'s Army, and gracious amongst the rest, having been Fortunate against the <hi>Bar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>barians</hi> in several Rencounters. <hi>Constans</hi> being Gouty, and unable to endure the Fatigues of War, he resolved to make use of his Reputa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion amongst the Soldiers against his Master, (who in a Sedition and Mutiny of the Soldiers, had protected him from their Violence by his own Robes) assisted especially by <hi>Marcellinus</hi> Captain of <hi>Constans</hi>'s Guard, and <hi>Chrestus</hi> In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tendant of the Kitchin. At <hi>Autun</hi> then <hi>Mag<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nentius</hi> celebrating the Birth-day of his Son, feasted all the Chief Officers of the Army and City; and when they had well drank till late in the night, <hi>Magnentius</hi> went forth, and returned clothed with Purple, and his Guards, as Emperor, shewing himself to the Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pany, who after a short but efficacious Speech, declared him Emperor, and adored him ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording
<pb n="345" facs="tcp:56789:181"/>
to the Custom; so did the Citizens by little and little, and the rest of the Army also corrupted by his Largess: Then keeping the Gates shut, that none could go forth, he chose those of his Men, in whom he most confided, commanded by <hi>Gaiso,</hi> to surprise <hi>Constans</hi> who mistrusted nothing; and as he was returned from Hunting, wearied and asleep at <hi>Elne</hi> in the County of <hi>Rousillon,</hi> they slew him, awaked with the noise, and endeavoring to save himself in <hi>Spain:</hi> To the Officers also whom he knew Faithful to <hi>Constans,</hi> he sent Letters in <hi>Constans</hi>'s name, to come to him with all speed; these he slew, by Ambuscades and other Treacheries, to a very great num<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber; and so seized upon <hi>Gallia</hi> and <hi>Britain, Spain, Africk, Sicily</hi> and <hi>Italy;</hi> till the Legions of <hi>Pannonia</hi> chused <hi>Vetranio;</hi> whom <hi>Magnen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tius</hi> endeavored to joyn to himself. But <hi>Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stantius</hi> having joyned to his own the Army of <hi>Vetranio,</hi> marched to meet the Tyrant, creating <hi>Gallus</hi> (Son of <hi>Constantius</hi> his Uncle) <hi>Caesar,</hi> naming him <hi>Constantius,</hi> and leaving him to govern the East: To ballance which, <hi>Magnentius</hi> also made his Brethren, <hi>Decentius</hi> and <hi>Desiderius, Caesars,</hi> and sent them to raise Men, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> The Armies on either side marched to fight, and <hi>Constantius</hi>'s Vantguard was ill handled by an Ambuscade of <hi>Magnentius</hi>'s; which encouraged the Tyrant so, that laying a Bridge over the <hi>Savus</hi> (heightned also by the Revolt of <hi>Silvanus</hi> from <hi>Constantius,</hi> and by <hi>Constantius</hi>'s sending <hi>Philippus</hi> to <hi>Magnentius</hi> to treat of Peace) he marched his Army, which
<pb n="346" facs="tcp:56789:182"/>
was there encountred by <hi>Constantius</hi>'s Soldiers, and almost ruined: So that he was forced to pretend that he came to make Peace, and take Conditions of <hi>Constantius;</hi> which <hi>Philippus</hi> there proposing, he assented unto; where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>upon <hi>Constantius</hi> gave him leave to march his Army into <hi>Pannonia,</hi> where he ruined <hi>Siscia</hi> and many other Cities; and grew so proud, that he sent to <hi>Constantius</hi> to surrender the Empire and beg his Life. <hi>Constantius</hi> answered, God would Revenge his Treason. Mean while the Tyrant besieged and assaulted <hi>Syr<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mium,</hi> where he was beaten off with great loss; thence he went to <hi>Mursia,</hi> where <hi>Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stancius</hi> having defeated an Ambuscade, at <hi>Cibalis</hi> fought a very sore Battle with him, getting a great Victory, loosing Thirty thou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sand, and killing Thirty six thousand and eighty. This being in Autumn, and <hi>Constantius</hi>'s Army being much weakened, he sent part of his Horse to pursue them. The Tyrant rendez<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vouzed at <hi>Pavia,</hi> which he fortified, and quar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tered his Men so Advantagiously, that he feared little of <hi>Constantius,</hi> and so gave himself to all Voluptuousness; but in the end of Winter, <hi>Constantius</hi> sending part of his Army to com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pass them about, he came with the rest, and forced him to fly into <hi>Gallia;</hi> where using all sorts of Cruelty, he retired to a Castle, and sent to <hi>Constantius</hi> to beg Pardon, who denied it. Mean while the People seeing him in this condition, refused to send him Succor; yea, his own Army, to beg their Peace, beset him at <hi>Lyons,</hi> intending to deliver him up

alive to <hi>Constantius:</hi> For which cause, entering into a Rage, he slew all his Kindred and Friends that were present; and last of all himself also, Forty two Months after his Ele<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction.</p>

and escaped when his Father, Brother, Uncle and Cousins were murthered, by reason of Sickness, as <hi>Julian</hi> did because of his Infancy; they were both intended by <hi>Constantius</hi> for Church-men, and were brought up accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dingly. He carried himself very valiantly against the <hi>Persians</hi> and <hi>Jews;</hi> and was always an Orthodox Christian. <hi>Constantius</hi> married his Sister <hi>Constantina</hi> to him, and made him <hi>Caesar,</hi> being Twenty five Years old: After a while he began to practice against the Em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peror, and put to death his best Friends and Officers; of which, and other his Violences and Tyrannies, <hi>Constantius</hi> being informed, drew him to him with fair words and shews, though he doubted a long time, and if he could have found his Men Faithful, he would have declared himself <hi>Augustus;</hi> but by his Cruelty, Insolence and Inconstancy, he had got the Hatred of all Men. So sending before his Wife to make his Peace, as well as she could, (who died of a Feaver contracted by Indignation to see her self in that condition) he departed from <hi>Antioch</hi> towards <hi>Constanti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nople;</hi> by the way <hi>Constantius</hi> discharged him of part of his Train, and afterwards set a Guard upon him; who took away his Robes, put him into a Hackney-Coach, and carried him to <hi>Pola,</hi> where being examined he was put to death, having been a long time tor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mented with the Apparitions of those he had murthered.</p>

He was Sober, Chaste, Learned, Peaceable, Bountiful, and too cre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dulous towards his Friends, affectedly Grave; his greatest Vice was hearkening to Eunuchs and Courtiers, and by their Instigation doing things sometimes Cruelly and Unreasonably, these <hi>Julian</hi> afterwards put to death; had it not been for that and his own Distrustfulness, Jealousie, and Suspitions of his Kindred, Friends and Officers, he had been comparable to the best Princes. By his extreme Zeal also to <hi>Arrianism,</hi> he vexed mightily many of the Godly Bishops and Doctors of the Church. He fought against the <hi>Persians</hi> and vanquished them, though with very great loss; after<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards with <hi>Magnentius, &amp;c.</hi> but returning to the East, the <hi>Barbarians</hi> invaded <hi>Gaul,</hi> and the <hi>Persians</hi> the East; so that he was forced to seek out for some one to make <hi>Caesar,</hi> which was <hi>Julian</hi> Son of <hi>Constantius</hi> (his Uncle) and

                  <hi>Basilina;</hi> which he did, and gave him <hi>Helena</hi> his Sister in Marriage, sending him into <hi>Gallia;</hi> where <hi>Julian</hi> having done very great matters, was by the Legions saluted <hi>Augustus;</hi> which so alarmed <hi>Constantius,</hi> that he left the <hi>Persians</hi> and the East, to chastise <hi>Julian;</hi> but as he was in <hi>Cilicia</hi> a violent Feaver surprised him, and he died with great Grief and Sorrow, that he left his Enemy his Heir, and one that was so great an Idolater; that he had been such a Favorer of <hi>Arrianism,</hi> and put to death so many of his Kindred. He was brought to <hi>Constantinople,</hi> and buried with very great Pomp.</p>

She was Barren, but very desirous to have Children; whereupon taking some Drugs
<pb n="352" facs="tcp:56789:185"/>
into her Womb, she became Sick and Hectick, and so died.</p>
               <p>His last Wife was <hi>Maxima Faustina,</hi> whom at his death he left with Child of a Daughter called <hi>Constantia,</hi> which at the Age of fourteen Years was married to <hi>Gratianus</hi> the Son of <hi>Va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lentinian.</hi>

He was by <hi>Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stantius</hi> destined to the Clergy, and accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dingly he studied Theology, and all other Sciences fit for that Profession, yet Hypocri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tically having <hi>Paganism</hi> in his Heart; this pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceeded from his Masters, some whereof were <hi>Pagans,</hi> as <hi>Mardonius, Libanius:</hi> and his Ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quaintance with <hi>Maximus</hi> a great Magician and Necromancer, put to death afterwards for these things by <hi>Valentinian.

Procurers of his Apostacy, which notwith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>standing he dissembled all the time of <hi>Constan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tius.</hi> He was in danger of death with his Bro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther <hi>Gallus,</hi> but by the Favor of <hi>Eusebia</hi> he escaped, and obtained leave to go to <hi>Athens,</hi> whither he drew also divers of his Philosophers and Magicians; and by the Priest of <hi>Eleusis</hi> (the knowingest Magician of his time) he en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quired of his future Condition. From <hi>Athens</hi> he was sent for to Court then at <hi>Milan,</hi> where he was made <hi>Caesar,</hi> married to <hi>Helena</hi> the Emperor's Sister, and sent into <hi>Gaul</hi> with a small Army, to deliver it from the Oppression of the <hi>Barbarians;</hi> at that time he professed <hi>Arrianism,</hi> but coming into <hi>Gaul,</hi> and finding the People (so many as knew of it) averse from it, he pretended to be Orthodox, ani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mating the Bishops and Clergy against it, because against <hi>Constantius:</hi> Being arrived at his Command, he regained many places from the <hi>Franks,</hi> escaped many Dangers, (especially at <hi>Sens</hi> his Winter-quarters.)

the Force of the Soldiers compelled, so it was, that he was saluted, <hi>Augustus;</hi> of which he gave notice to <hi>Constantius</hi> presently, with many Excuses and Protestations. <hi>Constantius</hi> endea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vored to reduce him to reason by Letters, but in vain, for he resolved to maintain his Ele<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction; and to that purpose, after a while (his Wife dying in the mean time) he resolved to fight <hi>Constantius:</hi> In his way <hi>Vadomarius</hi> with an Army (who had defeated one of his Tri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bunes with his Army) interposed himself, (as he saith, by the setting on of <hi>Constantius)</hi> whom under shew of Friendship, inviting him to a Feast, he took Prisoner. Marching forward then into <hi>Illyricum</hi> and <hi>Thrace, Constantius</hi> re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turned from the <hi>Persian</hi> War to fight him, but died in the way in <hi>Cilicia,</hi> so that <hi>Julian</hi> re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mained sole Emperor.

He restored the <hi>Pagan</hi> Altars and Temples, spent much Money in perverting Persons from Christia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity, promoted Heathenism with all his Power; the first Expedition he undertook, was against

the <hi>Persians;</hi> whither marching, at <hi>Antioch</hi> he was hugely affronted and scorned with Jeers and Libels; entering into <hi>Persia,</hi> he suffering himself to be Fooled by certain Run-aways, burnt his Fleet, and marched into desart and inconvenient places, where being continually alarmed and harassed by the <hi>Persians,</hi> he was at last slain by one of their Troopers.</p>
