         <editorialDecl>
            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            <head>THE <hi>Trial and Condemnation</hi> Of the ſix notorious Traitors.</head>
            <p>THe Kings Witneſſes attending on the Court there were eight Romiſh Prieſts and Jeſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ites brought to the Barr, to receive their Trials upon the account of High-Treaſon, <hi>viz. Joſeph Kemiſh, William Ruſſel,</hi> alias, <hi>Napper, Henry Starkie, William Marſhal, James Corker, Lionel Anderſon,</hi> alias, <hi>Munſon, Charles Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry,</hi> and <hi>Alexander Lunſden</hi>; but the evidence not being prepared for the Trial of the former, <hi>viz. Kemiſh,</hi> he was reſerved till another time; but againſt the other ſeven they proceeded as fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>loweth, according to their Indictments, that they being Prieſts and Engliſh-born, after having receiv<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed orders from the See of <hi>Rome,</hi> came over and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mained in <hi>England,</hi> the which by a Statute of the 27th of Queen <hi>Elizabeth</hi> is made high Treaſon, Mr. Attorny-General and the Kings Council laid open the Cauſe to the Jury and Evidence, and the jury being charg'd with them, according to Law, <hi>Lionel Anderſon</hi> was firſt brought to the Barr, where Dr. <hi>Oats,</hi> Mr. <hi>Bedlo,</hi> Mr. <hi>Dangerfield,</hi> Mr. <hi>Prance,</hi> and Mr. <hi>Dugdale</hi> were ſworn for the King, Mr. <hi>Dangerfield</hi> firſt ſtanding up, did give a fair and large account, that the Priſoner was a Prieſt in orders.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="3" facs="tcp:31837:2"/>And that he had not only confeſſed him, but had given him the Sacrament, and in his Prieſtly Veſtments celebrated Maſs; not only at <hi>Wild-houſe,</hi> but alſo at ſeveral other places, and that after he had confeſſed the Witneſs, he bid him go and be drunk with ſuch a Gentleman, for it was for the good and pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pagation of the Romiſh Cauſe, that he was a Prieſt likewiſe Dr. <hi>Oates</hi> did affirm, and that he had at ſeveral times repeated Maſs and given the Sacrament to his knowledge, with many other plain and poſſitive circumſtances, to this he Pleaded not guilty, with many horrible Execrations.</p>
            <p>Afterwards <hi>James Corker</hi> was brought to the Bar, his Plea was that he had been once tryed with Sr. <hi>George Wakeman,</hi> and that he ought not twice to be put in danger of his Life: but the Court ſatisfied him in this point, whereas he before was try<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed as a Conſpirator, that he now was tryed as a Popiſh-prieſt, and then he pleaded not guilty, at which Mr. Attorny General laying open the Indictment, the Evidence were ſworn, <hi>viz.</hi> Dr. <hi>Oates</hi> and Mr. <hi>Prance</hi> who likewiſe did againſt him as againſt the former, affirm that they had ſeen him Cellebrate Maſs, give the Sacrament, and in his prieſtly Robes at <hi>Somerſet-Houſe,</hi> and other places, and was to have been a Biſhop: but he abſolute<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly denied that ever he had acquaintance with the Witneſſes, or ſcarcely ſeen them before his laſt Arraignment, and in a Jeſuiti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cal obſtenancy, made many vows and execrations endeavouring to ſcandalize the Evidence</p>

                  </gap>ſhal</hi> who was likewiſe tryed before with <hi>Corker,</hi> and did plead the ſame, and made a long oration in his own defence, courting the Acts of Parliaments and Statutes made and to be put in force on that account, and did, to ſpeak the truth, ſeem to be a learned and moſt proficient man, his place of executing of his Prieſtly Function, was for the moſt part in the <hi>Savoy,</hi> where Doctor <hi>Oates</hi> affirmed that he had heard him more then twelve times ſay Maſs in 1677. this he denied, and brought the woman that keept the houſe to teſtify that Dr. <hi>Oates</hi> was never there, but ſhe bogling in her Teſtimony did confound her Evidence, ſaying that he might be there, but that ſhe knew not ſhe had ſeen him there, Mr. <hi>Prance</hi> and Mr. <hi>Bedlo</hi> did affirm him likewiſe to have taken orders, and that they had known him to have been a Plotter, and a moſt notorious Prieſt,
<pb n="4" facs="tcp:31837:3"/>
As likewiſe upon the ſame Indictments and Statute of the 27th of Queen <hi>Elizabeth</hi> which makes it High-Treaſon for any En<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gliſh born Subjects to go and take Orders at <hi>Rome,</hi> and after come over into <hi>England,</hi> whereupon <hi>William Ruſſel</hi> alias <hi>Napper Henry Starky, Charles Parry,</hi> and <hi>Alexander Lunſdel</hi> were brought to the Barr, who pleaded not Guilty, but the aforementioned Evidence for the King, did ſo plainly make it appear, that they were not only Prieſts, but had at ſeveral times adminiſtred accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding to their Prieſtly Function, the Sacraments, and alſo con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſſed and abſolved ſome of them, and that Mr. <hi>Prance</hi> had re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived <hi>Chalices, Oyl-pots,</hi> and ſeveral other Trinkets belonging to the <hi>Al<gap reason="illegible" extent="1 letter">

Ruſſel,</hi> alias, <hi>Napper, Starky, Marſhal, Corker, Anderſon,</hi> and <hi>Parry,</hi> but <hi>Lunſden</hi> being a Scotchman-born, was not thought to come within the Verge of the ſaid Act of Parliament, and therefore reſerved for a ſpecial Verdict in that Caſe.</p>
            <p>Thus may we ſee, tho haughty <hi>Rome</hi> does bend her Frowns at this our Engliſh Nation, nay and prompt our Native Subjects to conſpire our Downfall and immediate Ruine. Heaven ſtands moſt firmly on our ſide, and that pernicious Snare that they had laid to catch the Innocent, themſelves have fallen in; for ſure it is, Eternal Vengeance will not ſleep for ever, when ſuch dire Contrivances hatched in the dark Shades of Night aſcend and pierce the Bluſhing Clouds, therefore let both Tirant <hi>Rome,</hi> and her thrice fatal Emiſſaries now beware, leaſt they incur the high diſpleaſure of a dreadful God, and pull down moſt deſerved Ru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ine on their Heads, whilſt that they think to dare Omnipotence, by their endeavouring to deſtroy ſuch as are protected by his Providence:</p>
