            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            <p>
               <seg rend="decorInit">I</seg> Was moued (and who would not be moued?) by the Reuerend Mother <hi>Superiour</hi> of the <hi>English Tereſian-Carmelites,</hi> at Ant werpe, &amp; the reſt of that holie Aſſemblie, to Translate, out of <hi>Spanish,</hi> into <hi>English,</hi> the Life of the Admirable, and Bleſſed Woeman, <hi>S. Tereſa,</hi> their holie Mother, and mine; whoſe Excellencies, and Perfections, it is hard, for anie Penn, to expreſſe; and few Harts, euen of the moſt refined, and raiſed, can fully vnderſtand, and compre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hend. For, though it were tranſlated long agoe, by an eminent, and worthie Man of our Nation, in the great deuo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, which he carried to his excellent
<pb facs="tcp:100776:6"/>
Saint; yet he had liued, ſo very long, out of his Count<gap reason="illegible: blotted" extent="2 letters">
                  <desc>••</desc>
               </gap>; and had attended, in ſo ſerious a manner, to the acquiring of Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fection, and Knowledge, in order to the Conuerſion of Soules, that, on the one ſide, he ſeemed to haue loſt a little of the puritie of his owne <hi>English</hi> Toung, and, on the other, not to haue acquired e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nough of the <hi>Spanish;</hi> and conſequently, not to haue been able, to performe the Worke, ſo exactly, as he deſired. Since, ſuch a Booke, as was ſo ſublimely con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiued, by ſuch a Hart, and ſo veheme<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>tly poſted-out, by ſuch a Penn, could neuer be exactly tranſlated, out of anie one Language, into an other, vvithout a kind of full poſſeſſion of them both; beſides a great attention, &amp; application of minde, othervviſe. Some places being therfore very obſcure, and manie other, more then a little, mis-vnderſtood, the Booke vvas not ſo vvell receiued, nor ſo gladly, &amp; greedily read, as it deſerued. And ther<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore, both in honour of their renouned, and admired Parent, &amp; in appetite alſo of their ovvne conſolation, and perfec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion in Spirit, the zeale of theſe holy Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligious
<pb facs="tcp:100776:6"/>
vvoemen could not content it ſelfe vvith leſs, then a procuring, to get a nevv Tranſlation made, vvhich perhaps might proue, (to their thinkeing) a little leſſe imperfect, then the other.</p>
            <p>For my part, I confeſſe, I vvonder, that ſome ſuch Reuievv, and Reformation, concerning a Publique Worke, ſo much importing the glory of Almighty God, and the honour of ſo eminent a Saint, could be forborne ſo long. But euen that very conceipt, and conſideration, did helpe to clappe the Spurrs into my Sides, towards a running through this Courſe, and Carreire, vvith all the care, &amp; ſpeed, vvhich I could poſſibly vſe.</p>
            <p>And heerin, though my abilityes were ſmall, yet my attention grew to be great; and ſo I conſidered ſeuerall Coppyes, and tooke alſo many opinions, and yet found, that all my diligences vvere few enow, towards the diſcharge of the mul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>titude of doubts, and difficultyes, vvhich occurred; Partly, through the high, and abſtracted Nature of the verie Contents of the Booke; Partly, through the great length of the Periods; Partly through the
<pb facs="tcp:100776:7"/>
multitude, ſometimes, of Parentheſis, euen in the ſame ſente<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ce; Partly, through her forbearing to vſe thoſe Particles, in the beginning of the ſaid Sentences; as namelie, <hi>For, But, Yet, Therefore,</hi> and the like; vvithout vvhich, it is not alwayes ſo eaſie to diſcerne, whether the Diſcourſe be either continued, or interrupted or ended; and partlie, &amp; cheiflie, by the ill printing, and vvorſe pointing, of all the Spanish Coppyes, vvhich I could euer come to ſee. All vvhich, I am faine to al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leadge, by vvay of an humble excuſe, for vvhatſoeuer errour, I may haue inuolun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tarilie committed, in this caſe. But how<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſoeuer, I heer preſent it, to the glorie of Almightie God; to the praiſe of this Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cellent Saint; and to the conſolation of theſe Children of hers, vvho are no leſſe, then a kind of counterpoiſe, to the mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerie of the times, vvherein vvee liue.</p>
            <p>But now, as ſoone as I had tranſlated the Worke, a certaine vviſe, &amp; vvorthie man, &amp; my freind, tooke knowledge of it, and deſired mee, by a verie earneſt letter of his, to vsher this Booke into the vvorld, vvith a <hi>Preface</hi> of mine owne;
<pb facs="tcp:100776:7"/>
vvhich might open the Readers eye, the more eaſilie to behold the Saint, vvhen she followed; and ſo alſo, to giue ſome notice of her Children, who are follow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing her. And though I alleadged my reaſons, why this might be leſſe neceſſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rilie done, yet ſtill, he vrged me to it; and ſo, I made his Will mine owne, and accordinglie, shall ſpeake a few of my thoughts.</p>
            <p>I ſay, ſome few of my thoughts; For, whoſoeuer hath ſtudied the perſon of the <hi>Glorious S. Tereſa,</hi> vvell, vvill find ſo much to ſay, as, if he haue a minde to ſay all, he may doe vvel not to beginne, ſince it vvill neuer be in his power, to make an end; ſuch a full ſea, is this excellent Saint, of all perfection, vvhich hath neither Bottome, nor Brimme. I vvill therefore, ſay verie little of her heer; and that, shall cheiflie tend, to let you ſee, how highlie this Life, (vvich vvas vvritten by the Saint her ſelfe) is authoriſed, and hovv punctuallie it deſerues to be beleiued, foraſmuch as may, any vvay, concerne the truth of the Hiſtoricall part thereof, as alſo the excellencie of the Order,
<pb facs="tcp:100776:8"/>
vvhich she both Reformed, and Erected.</p>
            <p>But for the preſent, you may firſt be pleaſed to conſider, that vvee find the Liues of Saints, to be vvritten, by three ſeuerall kindes of perſons. For, ſome are deliuered by men, who are onlie emine<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t, in the Hiſtoricall vvay; and they, deſerue to be eſteemed, and beleiued, for the merit of that worth, which shall appeare, vvhatſoeuer it fall-out to be.</p>
            <p>The ſecond ſort, is, vvhen the Writers, are not onlie vvorthie Men, but are withall, ſo great Seruants of Almightie God, as to be acknowledged, by the Chriſtian vvorld, for Saints; as <hi>S. Athana<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſius,</hi> vvho vvrote the Life of <hi>S. Anthonie; S. Epiphanius,</hi> of ſeuerall Prophets; <hi>S. Hie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rome,</hi> of <hi>S. Paul,</hi> and <hi>S. Hilarion,</hi> both of them, Heremits; <hi>S. Gregorie</hi> the Great, of <hi>S. Bennet; S. Bonauenture,</hi> of the Humble, and Admired <hi>S. Francis;</hi> and the like; who deſerue a farre higher credit, then the former; in regard, that the vvriters were Saints.</p>
            <p>The Third is, when Saints themſelues vvrite their owne Liues; as the Incom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parable <hi>S. Auguſtin</hi> did a great part of his,
<pb facs="tcp:100776:8"/>
in the Diuine Booke of his <hi>Confeſſions;</hi> vpon the exceſſe, &amp; admiration, wherein he vvas, at the vnſpeakable Mercie of Almightie God, for remouing all the mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeries of his Soule. And the Relations of ſuch Liues, as theſe, are, incomparably, of the moſt credit of all. For firſt, no bodie knowes ſo vvell, vvhat paſſes concerning a man, as himſelf; And Saints are verie farre, from ſaying anie thing, vvhich is not exactlie true; and eſpeciallie, if the Saints be ſuch, as that they be alſo endued vvith verie great naturall parts, of Witt, and Memorie, and Iudgement, foraſmuch as concernes the Braine, or Vnderſtanding; as they vvill be ſure to be vvith Truth, and Sinceritie, &amp; Can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dour, foraſmuch as may concerne the Hart, or Will. For, as theſe Morall parts vvill keep them from deceauing others: ſo, the Intellectuall, vvill ſecure them, from being deceaued themſelues; and vvill make them define, and diuide, and ſuſpect, and doubt, and aske, before they fullie reſolue, to beleiue; &amp; much more, before they vvill publish things, to the vvorld.</p>
            <p>
               <pb facs="tcp:100776:9"/>
And now, as the Incomparable <hi>S. Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guſtin,</hi> vvas called, by the conſideration of his owne great Sinnes, and God's greater Mercies, to declare his Life, in the neuer enough admired Booke of his <hi>Confeſſions:</hi> ſo alſo, did the <hi>Glorious S. Te<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reſa,</hi> the ſelf ſame thing, in effect, in this Booke; but, by direction of her Ghoſtlie Father. Not yet, that he did ſo much, as incline her to publish her owne imper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fections, and ſinnes, (nay rather, he did the direct contrarie) but onlie to declare her Forme of Prayer; togeather vvith the Fauours, vvhich our Lord imparted, to her, therein. But novv she, vpon that occaſion, vvould needs make her owne Proceſse, in view of the World; &amp; shew (as incident to the reſt) hovv ill, she had complyed vvith Almightie God, from time, to time. And by this meanes, doth she, in effect, vveaue that great peice, of rich Cloth-of-gold, and Tiſlue, vvhich concernes, almoſt, the Hiſtorie of her vvhole Life; and novv, the ſame is hung<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out abroad, to the vievv of the vvorld.</p>
            <p>But yet, amongſt all the excellencies thereof, there is one thing, vvhich diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pleaſes
<pb facs="tcp:100776:9"/>
manie vvorthie, vviſe, &amp; holie men; or at leaſt, vvhich pleaſes them leſſe, then the reſt. And it is, that vvhen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſoeuer there is anie queſtion at all, of her ſelf, (in order, either to Vertue, or Vice,) she vvould neuer truſt her ovvne eyes, though they vvere ſo cleare, and good, as the vvorld knovves; but shee reſolued, to vvorke vvith Perſpectiue-Glaſſes, of different, yea, &amp; euen contrarie kindes. For, vvhen she deſcribed her Vertues; she ſerued her ſelf, of a Diminishing-glaſſe; which made them ſeem ſo little, as to be no more, then a kind of Nothing. But, on the other ſide, when she gaue ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count of her Imperfections, she vvould, by no meanes, know them, by anie other name, then of Vices, and Sinnes; becauſe she tooke a Multiplying-Glaſſe, to her ſelf; for feare, leaſt els, thoſe Mole-hills should not ſeem Mountaines.</p>
            <p>Novv, in the ſtrength of this vvel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>meaning, and holie kind of errour, which she incurred (if anie errour may vvell deſerue ſo indulgent a name) she gaue her ſelf too great ſcope (if the Reader, vvould needs take her at her vvord) to
<pb facs="tcp:100776:10"/>
violate her ovvne excellent fame, by certaine too venturous dashes of her penn, vvhich vvas driuen too too haſtily on, by the impulſe of a kind of inordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nate Humilitie. In ſuch ſort, as that, if a bodie vvere diſpoſed, to truſt his eyes alone, vvithout his reaſon, he might be eaſilie dravvne, to paſſe a verie erroneous Iudgement, vpon her Soule.</p>
            <p>For, she vvill tell you, in tvventie pla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces of this Booke, What a grieuous Sinner she vvas; What a multitude of great ſinnes, she had (in her conceipt) com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitted; Hovv manie yeares, she had continued, in that dangerous ſtate; And, in fine, hovv she conceiued, that her proper place, and particular torments, vvere prepared, for her, in Hell it ſelf, for the euerlaſting punishme<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t of her Sinnes; which (she faith) she felt in Spirit. Where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>as yet, in realitie, and ſinceritie of truth, it may be cleer enough, (to ſuch as vvill vnpartiallie conſider, vvhat they are to iudge; and not looke through the miſt, or clovvde, of that too great inſatisfac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, and ſeueritie, vvhich she vvould be ſure to carrie tovvards her ſelf) that she
<pb facs="tcp:100776:10"/>
vvas alvvaies farre, from committing anie Mortall Sinne, in all the courſe of her Life.</p>
            <p>Now, the difference, in point of Iudge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, betvveen our Saint, and others, may well ſeem to haue proceeded from this occaſion, vvhich follovves. They looked vpon her vvhole life, vvith the eyes of a Religious kind of reaſon; And she, vvith thoſe, euen of a kind of inor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinate paſſion, (as a man may ſay) of de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uotion. They, looked vpon her, as men, vvho being informed, euen by her ſelf, of the Caſe, are moſt fitt, through their in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>differe<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>cie, to be the Iudge; Whereas she, looked vpon her ſelf, as a meer Partie; vvho muſt not, in her ovvne Caſe, be truſted, by anie meanes, ſo vvell, as her Iudge; eſpecially, vvhen that Iudge, knovves all things, as vvell as her ſelf, ſince she declares them to him. Beſides, that she expreſſes cleerly, hovv diuerſe, vvho vvere her Ghoſtlie Fathers, at the times of her greateſt imperfection, de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clared to her, in very poſitiue tearmes, that she vvas farre, from commiting Mortall Sinne. And note, that they paſſed
<pb facs="tcp:100776:11"/>
ſuch a Iudgement vpon her, at times, vvhen her ſelf profeſſes, that she Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſſed all her Sinnes ſo entirely, as not to omitt ſo much, as euen all thoſe Veniall Sinnes, vpon vvhich she could reflect. So that clearly, by the verie vvorſt of her caſe, if anie ſuch thing, as she had euer done, vvere doubtfull; &amp; if her Ghoſtlie Fathers aſſured her then, that it vvas not Mortall, (as indeed, they did) what reaſon could she haue, to be ſo very highly, and irreconciliably vnſatisfyed vvith her ſelf? But the truth is, she pearced ſo deeply, by meanes of Celeſtiall grace, into that endleſſe, ſpotleſſe Mine, of the Puritie of Almightie God, and the vnli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mited Excellentie of his High Maieſtie, and the vnſpeakable deformitie of the leaſt Imperfection, or frailtie, when once it should be brought to appeare, before that incomparable Claritie, of the King of Glorie; And, on the other ſide, she vvas endued, vvith ſuch a ſtrange, internall kind of knovvledge of her ſelf, that it made (as I vvas ſaying before) thoſe Moates of her Imperfections, ſeem Mountaines, vvhen once, they vvere to
<pb facs="tcp:100776:11"/>
appeare, as in God's preſence.</p>
            <p>She vvas alſo of ſo very ſenſible a na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture (vvhich I muſt needs touch againe aftervvard) and ſo eaſily obliged, and ſo inſeparably engaged, vpon the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceauing, euen of poore, vveake, little ſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uices, from mortall Creatures; &amp; much more, vvhen Celeſtiall Fauours diſtilled dovvne, ſo very faſt, tovvards her, from that neuer-failing Fountaine of Diuine Mercies; that, for her, to find her ſelf anie vvay vngratefull, yea or ſo much as euen vnmindfull thereof; and yet, much more, if she should proue ſo inhumanly vnkind, as, in ſtead of paying ſeruices, to commit faults (hovv light ſoeuer they might be) ſuch errours vvould ſeem, in thoſe eyes of hers, (vvhich ſtill, vvere fed, from that inflamed hart) to be really, not very much leſſe, then almoſt, as ſo manie halfe Sinnes, againſt the Holie-Ghoſt. And from this compoſition of her Minde, (both in the Naturall, and Su<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pernaturall vvay) did grovv thoſe pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>found deteſtations of her ſelf; thoſe high exaggerations, of her Imperfections, and Frailties; thoſe lovvde exclamations,
<pb facs="tcp:100776:12"/>
againſt her ſuppoſed ingratitudes, and vnkindneſſes, tovvards Almightie God, vvhich broke (as it vvere) euen her ovvne verie hart, vvhilſt she vvas think<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing; and deliuered ouer, ſuch feeling ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guments of her ſad remorſe, vvhilſt she vvas vvriting, as are able, to ſtrike the vvater of teares, out of the ſtonie harts of her Readers (like the Rod of Moyſes, vvhich droue vvater out of the Rock) vvhen once, they lend their ſight, though neuer ſo little, to behold that ſvveet Obiect, of her enamoured thoughts, and expoſtulations againſt her ſelfe.</p>
            <p>From hence it is, I ſay, that she accuſed her ſelf, after a kind of obſtinate manner, vvhenſoeuer she reflected vpon God, &amp; her ſelf; in order to his Bounties, on the one ſide, &amp; her diſcorreſponden<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces, on the other. Whilſt yet, vvhen her thoughts vvere bent, but to expreſſe the plaine order of things, after a manner meerly abſtracted, from thoſe ſuperiour Conſiderations, she deliuers ſuch truths, concerning her ſelf, as makes all theſe imputations, vvhich fell ſo fiercely vpon her Soule, out of her ovvne mouth, ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peare,
<pb facs="tcp:100776:12"/>
to be farre different, from that, vvhich she would deſire, that they might be thought. And ſo, in conformitie vvith this, you (my Reader) shall doe vvell, to conſider, in ſerious manner, how she, vvho ſpoke, after a ſort, erroneouſly, (vvhen she vvould partially iudge of her actions, in order to the ſpotleſſe Puritie of Almightie God, and his ſtrict Iudge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment) did yet vnfold her ſelf, moſt lit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terally truly, vvhen she expreſſed her ſelf <hi>Viâ facti,</hi> and related her affections, and actions, as it were, in the Hiſtoricall way.</p>
            <p>Obſerue therefore, hovv, in this vvay, she ſaith of her ſelf, That she vvas euer <note place="margin">
                  <hi>Cap.</hi> 4.</note> very carefull, not to commit anie Mor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tall Sinne; That she had great care of her Conſcience, ſtill, foraſmuch as co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>cerned anie thing of that kind; and that, if euer she would be ſo vnhappie, as to commit anie ſuch ſinne, that she should neuer be in quiet, till she vvas diſburthened of it; That she ſeldome receaued the B. Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crament, <note place="margin">
                  <hi>Cap.</hi> 5.</note> but vvith abundance of teares; That, after she had once taſted of the Regalo's of that Celeſtiall Banquet, (vvhich she beganne to doe, vvhen she
<pb facs="tcp:100776:13"/>
vvas young) she neuer omitted to Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſſe anie thing, vvhich she might con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceaue to be a Sinne, though it vvere but Venial; That she had euer great remorſe, <note place="margin">
                  <hi>Cap.</hi> 2.</note> whenſoeuer she committed anie offence, againſt Almightie God; That she did na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turally deteſt all dishoneſtie; and that she conceaued not, that there was, either anie occaſion, or anie perſon, in the whole vvorld, vvho could poſſibly ouercome that reſolution, in her; That, difficulties grew after-vvard vpon her, by occaſion of ſome Conuerſations, vvhich she had; vvhereof yet, she Confeſſing her ſelf, by way of doubt (as I haue inſinuated be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore) her Ghoſtlie Father made her know, that she did not offend God, therein. For, the truth of the caſe, vvas this: She vvas then, a Secular vvoeman; and the incli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nations, vvhich she had to the perſon, vvere capable of being concluded, in a Marriage; beſides, that really, on her part, there vvas neuer ſo much, as one impure thought; That another Spirituall <note place="margin">
                  <hi>Cap.</hi> 8.</note> man, vvith vvhome she alſo conſulted shortly after, about matter of her Soule, (by occaſion of ſome feares, into vvhich
<pb facs="tcp:100776:13"/>
she grevv then, to fall) declared to her, that, though she vvere in the ſtate of neuer ſo high Contemplation, yet ſuch conferences, and conuerſations, as thoſe, vvere not to be inconuenient, for her; That she alſo vnderſtood by others, of like condition, that the conuerſations, vvhich she vſed, and the contentments, vvhich she tooke, were lawfull; That she <note place="margin">
                  <hi>Cap.</hi> 7.</note> conceaued not her ſelf, to be in Mortall Sinne; for, if she had knowne anie ſuch thing of her ſelf, she would neuer haue endured it; That she was euer a great <note place="margin">
                  <hi>Cap.</hi> 6.</note> enemie, to detraction; yea and that the vvorld vvas euer ſafe in that kind, when she vvas preſent; for, euerie bodie, vvho knew her, knew alſo, that she would not, ſo much, as endure, that this Sinne should euer be co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>mitted, in her hearing; That she was neuer, any way, ſubiect to <note place="margin">
                  <hi>Cap.</hi> 22.</note> Enuy; And that she had alſo, neuer ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerued her ſelf, to offend Almighty God, either by Hypocriſie, or euen ſo much, as Vaine-Glorie; That she alwayes ſtuck, ſo very faſt, to the truth of Holie Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, and euen to the leaſt Ceremonie of the Holie Catholick Church, that rather
<pb facs="tcp:100776:14"/>
then beleiue otherwiſe, she vvould en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dure a thouſand deaths; That she vvas not cordially addicted, to anie thing, but to ſerue, and pleaſe our Bleſſed Lord; And that, in fine, the vvhole vvorld, ſeemed to her, to be no better, then a very Hill of Ants.</p>
            <p>Now, this vvas the verie truth of the Caſe; and this was the ſtate of our Saints Soule, from the firſt, to the laſt. And yet, vpon the co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ſiderations, which I touched before, this Bleſſed, and Heauenlie Crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture (I ſay, Heauenlie, euen vvhilſt she vvas yet, vpon Earth) would needs con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceaue her ſelf, once, in Prayer, not only to ſee, but euen to feele her ſelf, to be in thoſe verie torments of Hell, vvhich she held her ſelf (as hath been ſayd) to haue deſerued, for her ſinnes; and vvhich, indeed, vvould haue been litterally, and finally true, if our Lord had not preuent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed her, and accompanied her, and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ducted her, by his Holie Spirit, and Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uenlie grace; without which, what liuing Creature can be ſafe? But that, other<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe, she had actually committed ſuch ſinnes, as for which, hoſe eternall torme<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ts
<pb facs="tcp:100776:14"/>
might be, indeed, deſerued, ſeems to be but an vngrounded, and vnſound opi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion, in realitie of truth. For, the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtant excellencie of her Life, was ſuch, as that, she beganne, at the firſt, where others might be glad, to end it; (namely, with feruent, and inflamed deſires of Martyrdome, euen when she was ſcarce eight yeares old) and both continued, &amp; finished the ſame, afterward, in ſuch ver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tue, and expreſſe ſanctitie, of the higheſt kind, as that the world, may be rather willing, then able, to admire it, to ſuch a proportion, as it deſerues. And therefore, that conceipt of her great Sinnes, and of her deſerued place alſo, in Hell, ſeemes partly to haue had the true foundation, vpon the iealous, and ſollicitous, and cu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rious, enamoured, and inflamed Affec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions, of the faithfull, watchfull, loyall, laborious thoughts, of our Glorious Saint; which tended, almoſt euer, to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards a complying, in moſt perfect manner, with the duties, to which she held that she was liable, in her ſelf; and with the Inſpirations, by which she was ſo conſtantly ſollicited, and called vpon,
<pb facs="tcp:100776:15"/>
and, as it were, euen Courted, by the powerfull, and pretious hart, of our Bleſſed Lord; and partly, yea and perad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uenture cheifly, by the ill quarter, which she conceiued, and acknowledged her ſelf, to haue kept ſometimes, with our Bleſſed Lord, by not correſponding with his heauenly grace, and not complying, with his holie Inſpirations; and commit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing ſome neglects in that kinde; whilſt yet she was ſo enarneſtly moued, by his Diuine Maieſtie, to giue-ouer certaine naturall affections, and recreations, of hers. In regard of which vnkindneſſe towards Almightie God, she might haue congruouſly deſerued, to be depriued of God's grace afterwards; and then she might alſo haue falne, by degrees, not only into greater faults, but euen into greiuous Sinnes, which might truly haue been then aſcribed, to her former, leſſer offences. And ſo it was meerly, the vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpeakeable goodnes of Almightie God, and no merit of hers, that she was not permitted to fall, by degrees, euen as low as Hell it ſelfe, Like a man, who, in a ſmall diſtemper of bodie, neglects the
<pb facs="tcp:100776:15"/>
helpe of Phiſitians, and growes thereby afterward, into mortall diſeaſes &amp; death.</p>
            <p>Now therefore, in all ſuch things, as might concerne the eſtimation, which she made of her ſelf, in order, either to the excellencie, or deformitie, of her life, there is (and let the Glorious Saint forgiue me this errour, once, of ſpeaking truth) no credit at all, to be giuen her; becauſe that ſubiect, lyes but in the way of diſcourſe; &amp; all things in effect, of that nature, vſe to be iuſt, of that verie co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lour, whereof thoſe Glaſſes be, through which they are ſeen; and I haue already shewed, that hers, were of the partiall Cutt. But as for thoſe other things, which occurred to be ſet downe, by her, in the Hiſtoricall way, or els, which are related, as hapning to the perſon of the writer, in the <hi>vvay of fact,</hi> whether it were more or leſſe; as namely, that she did, and ſuffered, and ſayd, and heard, and felt, &amp; ſaw, whatſoeuer she affirmed, in thoſe kinds, whether it were in the Naturall, or Supernaturall way, there can be no queſtion made, as I haue shewed els where, but that all, was moſt
<pb facs="tcp:100776:16"/>
certainly, &amp; euen moſt punctually true. For els, she either muſt deceiue, or be deceaued; whereof the former were a great impietie; (but farre enough from her) &amp; the latter (all circumſtances con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſidered, and eſpecially, in parriculars of that nature) no leſſe, then a moſt imper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinent abſurditie, to be either affirmed, or beleiued; as was partly touched before.</p>
            <p>It is true, that both in her Superna<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turall Prayer, and yet more, in her Vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſions, and Reuelations, there are manie things, which ſurpaſſe anie Vnderſtand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, which is but meerly Humane; but ſo alſo, are there in finit other Particulars, in the Eccleſiaſticall Hiſtorie, concerning other Saints, which, howſoeuer they ſeem, and are ſtrange, yea and much more ſtrange then theſe, yet are they ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nerally, and moſt iuſtly admitted, to the degree of Morall beleif. For, as we Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tholiques, are inſtructed, &amp; taught, that, on the one ſide, we muſt not be ſo light, or rather in fine (to the end, that things, may haue their right names) not ſo very weake, and foolish, as to beleiue ſtrange, and ſupernaturall things, without a
<pb facs="tcp:100776:16"/>
mightie deale of authoritie, and proofe, (<note n="*" place="margin">Note this great, &amp; moſt certaine Truth.</note> yea and the Church her ſelf, doth moſt bitterly Excommunicate, whatſoeuer Creature in the world, who shall know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ingly propound anie falſe thing of this kinde, to be beleiued) ſo on the other ſide, that they, are moſt iuſtly to be held, both rash, and childish, and foolish, who beleiue not that, which multitudes of the moſt, and wiſeſt, and worthieſt, and learnedſt, and holieſt men beleiue. Though yet ſtill, in all theſe Caſes (wherein the Church hath not expreſly declared her ſelf) we are not, to beleiue things, with Diuine Faith, but only with a Morall, &amp; humane beleif; no, nor euen ſo much as that, but only, when they are ſo abundantly proued to be true, as that they can not rationally, be denyed, or euen doubted, by anie prudent, pious man. For, to reſolue to beleiue nothing at all, which is eleuated aboue the ordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>narie courſe of naturall things, or which ſurpaſſe a man's owne capacitie, and his explicit, and deciding iudgement, at the preſent time, is not only (as I was ſaying) a very foolish, but euen a childish,
<pb facs="tcp:100776:17"/>
and ridiculous kind of thing.</p>
            <p>I muſt heer, put you alſo in minde, how, particularly, it is found in Holie ſcripture, that there are innumerable in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtances (and eſpecially, in the <hi>Reuelations,</hi> of the Bleſſed, and Beloued Apoſtle, S. Iohn) which are incomparably more repugnant, both to reaſon, and euen to Common ſenſe, then anie thing, which is related heer. And as, (how difficult and ſtrange ſoeuer, thoſe things of holy Scripture be) they muſt yet, be as entirely beleiued (and that, vpon the price, of a mans being otherwiſe, an Heretique, or a verie Pagan) as the Bleſſed Trinitie it ſelf; becauſe, in fine, the leaſt tittle of Holie Scripture, is as fully, and entirely, to be beleiued, as the verie Diuinitie it ſelf, of Almightie God; ſince the verie leaſt, and loweſt point of our Faith, de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pends vpon the ſelf ſame <hi>formall reaſon,</hi> and grou<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>d, with the higheſt, &amp; greateſt: So alſo, whoſoeuer shall not receaue, whatſoeuer is deliuered, by the Saints, and great Seruants of Almightie God, concerning ſuch things, as paſſe in their owne Soules, through the entercourſe,
<pb facs="tcp:100776:17"/>
and commerce of his Diuine Maieſtie <hi>(cuius deliciae,</hi> are, to be, <hi>cum filiis hominum;</hi> vvhoſe delight conſiſts, in viſiting, and regaling the Soules of his deareſt, and moſt deuoted Seruants) the ſame being conſidered, by holie, and wiſe &amp; learned Diſcerners, and Tryers, and Iudges of Spirit, (vvhereof there is neuer vvant, in God's Church) and ſo, the Catholique Chriſtian World, growing by degrees, to accept thereof, in the vvay of giuing a iuſt admittance, &amp; a pious Morall credit to vvhat is related, that man, I ſay, shall be neither pious, nor prude<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t, who reiects it; and he shall be an ignorant foole, if he deride it.</p>
            <p>Nor is alſo anie of my Readers, to be ſcandalized a whitt, if he chance to heare Saints ſpeake, of ſome materiall and cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poreall kindes of things, vvhich are re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſented to them, in their Viſions; as namely Rings, or Crownes, or Chaines, or Mantles, or Darts, or the like (whereof there is ſome little mention, euen in this Booke) anie more, then he hath cauſe to be ſcandalized, at the Horſes, &amp; Riders, and Trumpets, and Seales, and Pretious

Stones, vvherewith the Celeſtiall Ieru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſalem vvas paued, in the <hi>Reuelation</hi> of <hi>S. Iohn.</hi> For, though I ſay not, that he is ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſarily bound, in the qualitie of a good Catholique Chriſtian, to beleiue the Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticulars, vvhich are repreſented in this Booke, after anie groſſe materiall way, vvith the ſame kind of infallible, Super<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>naturall Faith, vvhich he is ſtrictly, and preciſely obliged to allowe, to all things, vvhich are contained in Holie Scripture (vpon the price, as I vvas ſaying) of being otherwiſe, an Heretique, or a Pagan) yet I preſume to ſay (and it ſeemes to be moſt true, and certaine) that vvhen ſuch parti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cular Supernaturall Fauours, as afore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſayd, are vouchſafed by Almightie God, to his Saints, and are alſo admitted, and embraced, by multitudes of the lear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nedſt, and vviſeſt, and holieſt perſons of the vvorld, that man vvill be neither holie, no nor ſo much as learned, or wiſe, vvho not only shall reiect that, vvhich he hath no vvill to approue, but deride alſo that, vvhich he hath not vvitt, or grace; to vnderſtand. In a vvord, the Vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſions expreſſed in Holie Scripture, muſt
<pb facs="tcp:100776:18"/>
be all beleiued, by Diuine Faith, in their true ſenſe, vvhatſoeuer that falls out to be; and not the Viſions of Saints, vvith that, but vvith a farre inferiour kind of Faith; till the Holie Catholique Church, both haue defined them, and pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pounded them alſo, to be beleiued, by her Children.</p>
            <p>Nor yet are yow, my Reader, who<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſoeuer you may be, to be idly ſcanda<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lized, by any meanes, at the Formes, vvhereby things are repreſented ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times, in the Viſions, and Reuelations of Saints; and this, vpon another, and that a very ſubſtantiall reaſon, vvhich followes heer. For, the important buſines, in thoſe caſes, is, that our Bleſſed Lord, is pleaſed to imprint, at ſuch, and ſuch times, vpon the Soules of ſuch, and ſuch of his deare Seruants, ſuch, or ſuch a kind of vertue, or Fauour, or Strength, as himſelf is pleaſed to deſigne, for the comfort, pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>greſſe, and perfection, of that Seruant of his. And ſo, that Seruant, conſiſting both of a Bodie, and a Soule, his Diuine Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ieſtie is alſo gratiouſly pleaſed, manie times, to affect both the Bodie, and the
<pb facs="tcp:100776:19"/>
Soule, togeather, vvith a ſenſible kind of feeling of that grace; Thoſe outward demonſtrations (vvhich ſpeake, but, as it vvere, to the Bodie) ſeruing cheifly, but to denote, and deſcribe, in that ſort, to the vvhole man, the influences, and impreſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſions, vvhich then are made, and powred out, into the Soule.</p>
            <p>But now it vvill come fittly in, ere long, to show you that part of the Epiſtle Dedicatory, or Preface, vvhich the Famous Dominican Father, &amp; Doctour, <hi>Father Levvis de Leon,</hi> thought fitt to write, both in honour of <hi>S. Tereſa</hi> herſelfe, &amp; of thoſe Primitiue Daughters alſo of hers, who were firſt Founded at <hi>Madrid.</hi> For thereby, you will eaſily diſcerne, what a Race, that Glorious Saint had runne (eauen like ſome Gyanteſſe) in the way of our B. Lord; as alſo how cloſe, thoſe Children followed their holy Mother. Of which Mother, I shall not heer, haue roome to reflect, though I should but touch, &amp; goe; vnleſs vvithall, I vvould make this Preface, as long as the very Life it ſelfe. And therefore, you muſt giue mee leaue, to adiourne you,
<pb facs="tcp:100776:19"/>
for more ample ſatisfaction of this ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pectation, to thoſe dropps, vvhich I may, perhaps, both be able, and vvilling to deriue, and draw, out of that Sea of her Perfections, if I shall finish another ſmall Diſcourſe, and Deſcription of the Saint, vvhich I intend to make, and place, as by vvay of Preface, both to certaine Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clamations, or loude Aſpirations, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by that enamoured Soule of hers, found meanes to vent it ſelfe to Almighty God; as alſo, to two short Relations, which she made for her Ghoſtly Father, in vvriting, concerning the Degrees, by vvhich, she paſſed on, in the exerciſe of vertue, and in the vſe alſo of Prayer, that ſo, the ſaid Ghoſtly Father, might be the abler to direct, &amp; inſtruct her. In the meane time, I shall only ſay, in very few vvords (by vvay, as it vvere, of Antepaſt, till the Feaſt come in) That she vvas Of very antient, noble Birth; Of choyce Breeding; Of a gratious, &amp; louely perſon; Of an humour, highly acceptable, and agreable, to the vvhole vvorld, vvhich knew her; Of a melting, and bleeding Nature; Of moſt Loyall, true, &amp; tender
<pb facs="tcp:100776:20"/>
Freindship; Of a ſweet, &amp; charming way, in conſeruation; Of great ſignificancy, and elegancy of ſpeech in her expreſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion, though naturall, and round, and vvithout affectation; &amp; in particular, her Talent vvas rare, in abounding vvith the choyceſt Compariſons, which can be found. Her felicity vvas alſo great, in negotiation; for she vvas owner of a ſolid vvitt; a ſteddy, &amp; ſound iudgement; and deep vvisdome. She had a hart, as open as day, in the exerciſe of bounty; Her compaſſion vvas moſt eminent, to vvards the releife of all Creatures in miſerye; &amp; ſo eſpecially, vvas her ſollicitude, to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolate, &amp; regale all ſuch, in all occaſions, as vvere intruſted to her care; vvhilſt yet she vvould needs be vnkind, and euen, as it vvere, cruell, to her ſelfe alone.</p>
            <p>Aboue all things, she was a moſt per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect Louer of Truth, &amp; ſo full of match<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſs candour, &amp; ſincerity, in all expreſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſions, &amp; vpon all occaſions, that she vvould no more haue euen ſo much, as but diſguiſed it, and much leſſe varyed from it, in the leaſt kind, (eſpecially, vvhen the queſtion had, any vvay, con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerned
<pb facs="tcp:100776:20"/>
her owne aduantage) then she vvould haue ſold her ſelfe, for a Slaue.</p>
            <p>Theſe, I ſay, vvere the conditions of this admirable Creature; and theſe, were the parts of her Minde, vvhich yet I conſider, but in the nature of Fruits. But they grew, from theſe Roots vvhich follow; A moſt profound Humility; A moſt inuiolable Chaſtity; A moſt ſtrict loue of Pouerty; A moſt vnshaken, and inuincible Patience; in deſpight of sharpe Sickneſſes, tormenting paines, and end<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſſe perſecutions: A moſt ardent, and inflamed Charity, both towards God, &amp; man; which bred an eager, and inſatiable appetite, to winne Soules; An vndaunted Fortitude, &amp; high Courage, and that, no leſs, in the endeauouring great things, then in the ſuffering hard things; A con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtant, continuall, Supernaturall, &amp; moſt Eleuated courſe of Prayer, and Contem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plation.</p>
            <p>Such a kind of excellent Creature was this. But yet, whe<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> I ouerlooked the little, vvhich I had heer ſet downe, I confeſs, it ſeemed, at the firſt, eue<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> in mine owne eye, to be a very extraordinary <hi>Elogium,</hi> of her
<pb facs="tcp:100776:21"/>
Vertues, and parts; and, as if it might, perhaps, haue had more in it, of the Pane<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gerick, then of a iuſt Praiſe. And there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore, before I vvould giue it paſſage to the Print, I looked attentiuely back, vpon vvhat I had read of her, concerning her reſolutions, and heroicall actions, re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>corded in authenticall manner, by di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uerſe graue, and vviſe Authours; and in ſeuerall places alſo of her owne Workes; and particularly, vpon what is deliuered, by <hi>Father Ribera,</hi> in the Hiſtoricall Rela<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of her vvhole Life. But when I came back from thence, &amp; compared that kind of <hi>Deſcant,</hi> vvith my <hi>Plaine-Song,</hi> con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerning the Saint, I found my ſelfe to haue rather falne much too short, then to haue, any way, ouer-short, in this kind; and that the particulars, recounted with great authority, els vvhere, for the proofe of how she profeſſed her ſelfe, after a high, &amp; moſt Heroicall manner, in the practiſe, &amp; purſuite of Vertue, in order to all ſanctity, &amp; perfection, to vvhich she aſpired, &amp; where, by God's great mercy, she ariued, vvould haue no leſs auowed, then encouraged my Penn, to
<pb facs="tcp:100776:21"/>
haue done her much more honour, (that is more right) if it had not been employ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, by ſo vveake a hand, as mine. But, in the meane time, I haue conſidered the Example of the holy <hi>S. Hierome;</hi> vvho vvriting of his <hi>S. Paula,</hi> to <hi>Euſtochium</hi> her Daughter, hath theſe vvords. <hi>I take Ieſus, and his Saints to vvitnes, as alſo, that parti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cular Angell, vvho vvas the Guardian, and Companion of this admirable vvoeman, That I vvill ſay nothing of her, for fauour; nothing after the cuſtome of Flatterers; but that vvhatſoeuer I am to deliaer, shall be, as if it vvere vpon mine Oath; and yet ſtill, it vvill fall short of her merits.</hi> And now this, shall authoriſe mee alſo, to take our Bleſſed Lord to witneſſe, that, to the beſt of my poore vnderſtanding, I haue not miſtaken my ſelfe, about the celebration vvhich heer I make of our Saint, in the point of haueing praiſed her too much: but rather, that I am growne to be her Debtour, then her Creditour, heerin. For, if euer there haue been, in the whole vvorld, many vvoemen of more admi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rable parts, &amp; perfections, both in their Intellectualls, &amp; their Moralls, (which I
<pb facs="tcp:100776:22"/>
account to be, as the Simples of a Soule) &amp; in the vſe alſo thereof, whereby thoſe Simples, grow to be mixed; and whether wee shall conſider them, in the Naturall, or Supernaturall way; it is more then I haue been able to know, either by read<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, or els by Diſcourſe; &amp; yet I haue been carefull enough, to enquire.</p>
            <p>But now, the certainty of this truth, will yet, euen further appeare; when I shall tell you that, which followes. And it is, That when the Saint made obſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uation, &amp; had experience of the world's great frailtie, and leſſe perfection; and that the Religious Order, and Houſe, vvhere she had entred, had obtained certaine Relaxations, and Diſpenſations, from diuerſe ſtrict Clauſes, and Condi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions, of the firſt Inſtitute; and when she had alſo mett with ſome Cuſtomes, through which, euen her ſelf had re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiued diſaduantage, by diſſipation, and diminution of Spirit; as namely, in regard of great, &amp; publique reſort to the Houſe, and a multitude of vnneceſſarie Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uerſations; and eſpecially, for that they were not bound to continuall Clauſure,
<pb facs="tcp:100776:22"/>
but had libertie, to goe abroad (though yet, only by leaue of their Superiours,) to viſit their Parents, and neer kinred, at ſome times; she grew into a full reſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lution, That, if euer it should be in her power, to free her ſelf from that courſe; and to ſet more limited bounds vpon her wayes; and to inuite others alſo, by her example, to expreſſe their great de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſire, to gaine, and perfect Soules; she would not faile, to put that purpoſe of hers, in execution.</p>
            <p>And ſo, after the expiring of ſome time, &amp; the encountring of manie impedime<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ts, and the ouercoming a vvorld of difficul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties, she grew to expreſſe her loue, to our B Lord, (but in the perſon of ſuch Crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures, as for whome he dyed) to ſuch a proportion, and in ſo high a kind, as to proiect, and perfect ſo great, and hard a vvorke, as that perhaps, no Woeman will be ſeen, to haue euer procured, and per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formed the like. For, to reforme a Reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gious Order, and to reduce it to the firſt ſtrict Inſtitute, is a matter of much more difficultie, then to Found one. And, for a Woeman (vvho vvas of no abſolute
<pb facs="tcp:100776:23"/>
power to command) to paſſe through ſo manie impediments, and to vvinne the Prize, and to adorne euen that Originall Rule it ſelf, vvith ſo manie holie, and wiſe Documents, and Conſtitutions of her owne, for the raiſing, and true refining of Spirit, according to the neceſſities, and exige<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ces of thoſe preſent, moſt depraued times, makes the buſines become yet more hard, and ſtrange, on the one ſide, and more vſefull alſo, &amp; more excellent, on the other. For, as I conceaue it to be a truth, that there is no one approued Order of Religious people, in the Holie Catholique Church, vvhich is not of the beſt of all others, in that vvay of Spirit, for which it was cheifly inſtituted by Al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mightie God; and eſpecially for thoſe times, in which it was inſtituted: So is it, not only pietie, but euen prude<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ce alſo, to beleiue, that, ſince this Bleſſed Woeman, was ſtirred-vp by God's holie Spirit, in this Age of ours, for the redreſſe of our moderne, great diſorders, that his Diuine Maieſtie had a minde to be moſt parti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cularly ſerued, and glorifyed by it; and that the Soules, which would conſecrate
<pb facs="tcp:100776:23"/>
themſelues to him therein, might proue to be holie, and happie, in a very eminent degree, as long as they would continue attentiue, and carefull, not to ſwarue from that Spirit, which was deriued to them, from Heauen, through <hi>S. Tereſa,</hi> by her Prayers, and teares, and other holie meanes. Which Spirit of hers, though it euidently appeare, both by the exerciſe, and example of all He<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>roicall Vertue, yet particularly, it ſeemes to ayme, and point at the regular, and conſtant vſe of Recollection, &amp; Mentall Prayer; vvhereof she ſpeakes oftneſt, and vvith moſt particular deſire, and care; and appoints two Howers, to be em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ployed, euerie day, therein, beſides all other Deuotions of anie kind; vvhich is practiſed by all her holy Religious, and is really that time, vvhich giues them more aboundant ioy, then all the reſt. And indeed, she takes manie occaſions, not only to recommend it earneſtly, to the Children, and Succeſſours of her owne Order, but exhorts alſo all Creatures, who will haue the happines, to be the true Seruants of our Bleſſed Lord, to
<pb facs="tcp:100776:24"/>
take faſt hold, by this Anker, in their Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uigation through the Sea of this vvorld. In vvhich Sea, not only they, who are beſt shipped, but euen ſuch others alſo, as haue been caſt ouer board, from Grace, into the ſtorme, and tempeſt of a Sinne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full life, may yet, by meanes of Prayer, proue able, yea and morally certaine, through the mercie of Almightie God, to recouer the aſſured Port of Saluation. For, in the iudgement of this excellent creature, this point, and practiſe, of <hi>Mentall Prayer,</hi> is the moſt ſacred, and ſoueraigne help, by way, either of Preſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uatiue before Sinne, or yet of remedie, or Reſtoratiue, after it, which can poſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſibly be found, or miniſtred in this world; and indeed a kind of Manna from Heauen, which imparts all kind of Good to the Soule. Good alwayes, in the ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtantiall vvay; becauſe it alwayes brings encreaſe of grace, &amp; ſo enables men to vvinne great victoryes ouer themſelues; where by, they daily grow to be the Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uants of Almighty God, more &amp; more. And ſometimes alſo Good, in a vvay of moſt ſoueraigne ſweetnes, beyond any
<pb facs="tcp:100776:24"/>
thing, which Flesh, &amp; Blood knowes how to imagine. But yet, to make the Soule capable of this laſt, she muſt re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolue to vntye her ſelfe vvholy, (and it muſt indeed, be wholy) not only from the firme purpoſe, of committing any Sinne, vvhether it be great, or ſmall, but euen from the very faſtning her affec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions, in any manner of inordinate vvay, to any Creature of any kind; though yet, it should not be vnlawfull in it ſelfe.</p>
            <p>And a moſt particular care, muſt alſo be taken, by all ſuch, as vvill follow the footſtepps, &amp; directions of this Glorious Saint, (vpon vvhich she preſſes ſo very often, &amp; ſo very hard, in twenty places of this excellent Worke,) That a Soule which pretends to ſerue our Bleſſed Lord, in this kind, as she ought, muſt re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolue, both very faithfully, &amp; very early, to diſpoſe herſelfe to doe it, with true, &amp; perfect <hi>Liberty of Spirit;</hi> that is, with an abſolute intention &amp; determination, to doe it, meerly, becauſe it is the holy Will of our B. Lord; and becauſe he hath made it the meanes, vvhereby she may obtaine the pardon of her Sinnes, and acquire all
<pb facs="tcp:100776:25"/>
Chriſtian vertue, through encreaſe of Grace; and pay, both frequent, &amp; ardent acts of Homage, &amp; Greife, &amp; Loue, to his Diuine Maieſtie; &amp; procure an imitation of thoſe Heroicall vertues, which he was pleaſed to expreſſe, in his bitter Paſſion. And, aboue all things, the Saint requires vs, to take heed of haueing any merce<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nary reſpect at all, to receiue guſts, &amp; ſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rituall delights, or other higher Fauours from him, in this Life; but to remitt all ſuch things, to the next; and (ſo that vvee may euer doe him true Seruice) to leaue it, with all indifferency, &amp; conformity to our Bleſſed Lord, whether he vvill diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pence all his Fauours to vs, at one pay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, in the next world; or els, by parts &amp; portions, in this. And whoſoeuer shall be of a different minde, vvill not only diſoblige the Glorious <hi>S. Tereſa</hi> her ſelfe, but may alſo make this Booke, both an vnprofitable, &amp; vnvſefull, yea &amp; euen an inconuenient Study for his Soule.</p>
            <p>But (to returne to the glorious actions of this Saint) That, beſides the inſtitut<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, or redreſſing this Order, (where she had, both men, and woemen though yet
<pb facs="tcp:100776:25"/>
cheifly, her owne Sex in her eye,) she should alſo, being only but a Woeman, be able, ſo to worke vpon men, as (in deſpight of leſſe rigour, &amp; no little enuie) to bring them to take, as it were, the Law, at her hands; and, notwithſtanding the pride of <hi>Old Adam,</hi> to ouer-worke them, to co-operate vvith the Grace of the <hi>Nevv;</hi> and to make them not diſdaine to accept of her Inſtruction; and to apply themſelues to the imitation of this Virgin, vvill not allow vs to doe anie thing, but vvonder; ſaue that, it was, moſt euidently, the hand, and the ſtrong hand of Almightie God, vvho enabled, and ſtrengthned this deare Seruant of his to be the Inſtrument of ſo Heroicall a vvorke.</p>
            <p>And all this, is ſo excellently ſet downe, by the ſayd Doctour <hi>Levvis de Leon,</hi> as that I vvill doe both the Saint, and her Children the right, to shew them the verie Fountaine it ſelf, from vvhence the Relation ſprings; and not deface, or diſgrace it, by anie imperfect deſcription of mine owne.</p>
            <p>You are therefore to vnderſtand, and
<pb facs="tcp:100776:26"/>
conſider (for, theſe circumſta<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ces are not impertinent, to the ſubſtance) that ſome yeares, after the death of this excellent Creature <hi>S. Tereſa,</hi> and long before she vvas declared a Saint, by the iudgement of the Holie Catholique Church (in the Proceſſe vvhereof, there vſes euer, to be euen an exceſſe of difficulty, in weigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, and admitting of all Proofes) there grew a queſtion, about the publishing of her Writings, and Workes. And, to the end, that nothing might be done therein, either by anie indiſcreet zeale, or other accident, the Councel Royall of Spaine (vvhich is a Bodie of great Authoritie, &amp; Wiſdome) committed the review, of vvhatſoeuer the <hi>Saint</hi> had left behind her, in that kind, to be co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ſidered, by ſome fitt, &amp; graue perſon; that ſo, that vvhich should be found, to be truly hers, might be diſtinguished from other things, and ſo proceed to be publique, by Authori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie. This perſon, vvas a learned, and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nowned man, a Father of S. Dominicks Order, &amp; a Doctour, vvho liued in Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>drid, at that time. His name vvas <hi>Levvis de Leon,</hi> as I ſayd before; vvho, togeather
<pb facs="tcp:100776:26"/>
with acknowledging, and approuing, yea and admiring her Writings (whereof this Life of hers, is the cheife, employed himſelf alſo, with great care, to ſet them out, himſelf. And vvhen this Booke went to the Preſſe, he dedicated it to the Prioreſſe, and Religious Woemen, of the <hi>Tereſian-Carmelites,</hi> vvho then, vvere newly founded, in <hi>Madrid.</hi> And heer, you shall be entertained, vvith as much of that <hi>Dedicatorie Epiſtle,</hi> as imports the ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cellencie, both of the Holie Mother <hi>S. Tereſa,</hi> and of thoſe happie Daughters of hers, vvho already beganne to liue vnder her Rule. And theſe, are his verie vvords,</p>
            <p>
               <q>I neuer ſaw, nor knew the Bleſſed Mother, <hi>Tereſa of Ieſus,</hi> vvhilſt yet, she vvas in this world; but now, vvhen she liues in Heauen, I know her; and doe, in effect, continually ſee her, in two liuing Images, or Pictures, of her ſelf, which she left amongſt vs; and thoſe are, her Daughters, &amp; her Bookes; vvhich ſerue alſo, in my opinion, for very faithfull witneſſes, and ſuperiour to all kind of exception, concerning the proofe of
<pb facs="tcp:100776:27"/>
her great vertue. For, if I had but ſeen the figure, and features of her face, they vvould haue informed me, but of that part of her Bodie; And if I had heard her ſpeake, and diſcourſe, that, might alſo haue declared ſome part of the vvorth of her Minde. But the firſt, vvould haue been common, to others; &amp; the ſecond, might haue been ſubiect to errour; to vvhich theſe other, are not ſubiect, in vvhich I ſee her, now. For, as <hi>Salomon</hi> ſaith: <hi>A man, may be knovvne, by his children;</hi> And the fruits, vvhich anie one leaues behind him, vvhen he goes out of the vvorld, are the true teſtimonies of the life, vvhich he led, vvhen he vvas heer. And ſo we ſee, that Chriſt our Lord himſelf, vvhen he was pleaſed in the holie Ghoſpel, to put a difference, between the Good, and the Bad, addreſſes men, to conſider their Fruits; for, <hi>By their Fruits,</hi> ſaith he, <hi>you shall knovv them.</hi>
               </q>
            </p>
            <p>
               <q>So that, the Vertue, and Sanctitie of <hi>Mother Tereſa,</hi> vvhich might perhaps haue ſeemed queſtionable, &amp; doubt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full to me, vvhen I should haue ſeen
<pb facs="tcp:100776:27"/>
her heer, the ſame I hold to be, both very euident, and very certaine, (whilſt now, I ſee her not) by the view, vvhich I haue of her, both in her Daughters, &amp; in thoſe Bookes, vvhich she hath left behind her. For, by the vertue, vvhich shines ſo brightly, in all thoſe Daughters of hers, vve come to know, vvithout anie errour at all, the great abundance of grace, vvhich it pleaſed Almightie God to vouchſafe to her, whome he would ordaine to be the Mother of this new Miracle. And really, that deſerues, to be held for no leſſe, then a Miracle, vvhich vve ſee our Bleſſed Lord to be doing daily, both in them, and others, by their meanes. Nay, if that muſt goe for a Miracle, vvhich happens beyond the naturall courſe, &amp; order of things, there are, in this particular, ſo manie of them, vvhich are both new, and extra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ordinarie, as that to call them but a Miracle, vvere to ſay little; for they are rather an aſſemblie, and heape of Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>racles.</q>
            </p>
            <p>
               <q>For, it is one Miracle, that a ſingle Woeman alone, should haue reduced
<pb facs="tcp:100776:28"/>
an Order, both of Men, &amp; Woemen, to Perfection. And a ſecond, that the Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fection, to vvhich she brought them, vvas ſo great, and high. And a third, to find, to vvhat a huge encreaſe, it is growne, in ſo very few yeares, from ſo ſmall beginnings. And now, euerie one of theſe three, is a thing, vvhich de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerues particular conſideration. For, if it belong not to Woemen, to teach, but to be taught, (as <hi>S. Paul</hi> affirmes) it growes inſtantly, to be a kind of Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>racle, that a weake, &amp; ſicklie Woeman, should be ſo full of courage, as euen to vndertake ſo great a vvorke, as that; and vvithall, should be ſo full of vviſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome and efficacie, as finally, to pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uaile therein and should be alſo able, to ſteale the verie harts, out of the bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dies of them, with who me she treated, that ſo, the might be able to giue them, to Almighty God and carrie ſuch mul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>titudes of people, after her, towards the embracing of all ſuch things, as are ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prehended, and abhorred moſt, by flesh, and bloud. Whereby, me thinkes, it appeares, that, in a time, vvhen the
<pb facs="tcp:100776:28"/>
Diuel pretends, to triumph, in the mul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>titude of thoſe Infidels, vvho follow him; and in the obſtinacie of diuerſe Hereticall Nations, vvhich take part vvith him; &amp; amongſt the manie vices of looſe Catholiques, who range them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelues alſo on his ſide, the Maieſtie of Almightie God, vvould be pleaſed (for the greater contempt, and ſcorne of the Diuel) to aduance, and ſet before him, not a Man, who should be valiant, &amp; learned, but a poore, ſingle Woema<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, vvho should raiſe-vp, and plant a Banner of Defiance, againſt him; and should publiquely draw people to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>geather, vvho might conquer him, and trample vpon him, and euen turne him, in fine, out of doores. And cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainly, he vvas alſo reſolued, that it should ſerue for a demonſtration to the vvorld, (and that, in a time, vvhen ſo manie thouſands of men, vvere ſeeking, to venture vpon the ſpoile of his Kingdome, (ſome, by their erro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neous vnderſtandings; and others, by their depraued life, and manners) to proue, how Mightie, and Omnipotent
<pb facs="tcp:100776:29"/>
he was, by his introducing, &amp; enabling a Woeman, vvho should both illumi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nate the mindes, and compoſe the af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fections, and reforme the actions, of manie; and that her Children should daily grow-vp, into greater numbers, towards the reparation of thoſe ruines.</q>

               <q>Now, in this (as it vvere) old age of his Church, he hath been alſo pleaſed to shew vs, that his Grace is not growne old, and vveake; and that the ſtrength and vertue of his Holie Spirit, is not leſſe powerfull, at this day, then it was formerly, in thoſe happie times of the Primitiue Church. Since now, by cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taine meanes, vvhich are of an infe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riour, and vveaker kind, then before, he doth, either the ſame, or, in effect, the verie ſame, vvhich he did, then.</q>
            </p>
            <p>
               <q>For (to paſſe from the firſt Miracle, to the ſecond) the Life, vvhich your Reuerences lead, and the Perfection, vvherein your Holie Mother hath placed you, vvhat is it, but a picture of the Sanctitie of the Holie Primitiue Church? For really, that, of vvhich vve read, in the Hiſtories of thoſe times,
<pb facs="tcp:100776:29"/>
the ſelf ſame thing, doe vve ſee now, vvith our verie eyes, in your conuerſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, and proceeding. And your Life demonſtrates that, by your actions, and vvorkes, vvhich hath lately (through the little practiſe thereof) ſeemed to be only found, in papers, and vvords. And that, vvhich being read, makes men wonder, yea and euen flesh and bloud, doth hardly know how to beleiue, we ſee to be all accomplished, and per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formed, by your Reuerence, and your holie Communitie. For, how abſolutly, are you all, vntyed, and freed, from vvhatſoeuer, in fine, is not God? And, how haue you offred your ſelues vp, into the armes of your Celeſtiall Spouſe; in vvhome, you howerly em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brace one another; vvith mindes of valiant men, though in the bodies, but of weake, and delicate Woemen? And, how doe you put in execution, the moſt high, and generous kind of Chriſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tian Philoſophie, vvhich euer vvas ſo much as thought of, by men; and ſo, ariue, by your actions, (in order to a perfect life) to the exerciſe of all He<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>roicall
<pb facs="tcp:100776:30"/>
Vertue; vvhere, euen the witts of men, haue ſcarce ariued, with their Imagination? For, you make litter, of all the riches of this world; you haue Libertie, in hatred; &amp; Honour, in con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tempt; and you loue Humilitie, and Mortification; and all your attention, and ſtudie, ſeemes euer to conſiſt, in gaining ground vpon Vertue, by a holie kind of emulation, and compe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tition, vvith one another. And ſo alſo, on the other ſide, your Spouſe keepes very cloſe correſpondence vvith you, by infuſing ſo very great ſtrength of delight, and ioy, into your Soules, as that you poſſeſſe the treaſure of true Alacritie, euen in your verie being de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>priued, and ſtripped of all thoſe things, vvhich are wont to giue contentment, to poore-harted people, in this life. And ſo you alſo, with great generoſitie, tread all vvorldlie things, vnder your feet; as perſons, vvho be, as it vvere, exempted, euen from the lawes there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of; or at leaſt, are growne ſuperiour to them all. For, neither doth trouble, or labour vvearie you; nor Clauſure,
<pb facs="tcp:100776:30"/>
afflict you; nor infirmitie, diſcourage you; not euen death, amaze, or fright you; but rather yeild himſelf vp, to be conquered, by you.</q>
            </p>
            <p>
               <q>But that, vvhich in the midſt of all theſe particulars, ſerues, to make the vvonder, very extreame, is the great facilitie, and guſt, vvherewith you goe through all theſe things, which, of themſelues, are hard enough to be per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formed. For, Mortification is matter of ſolace to you; Reſignation, as a kind of Sport; &amp; Pennance, a Paſſe-time. And you goe putting that, in execution, which turnes Nature, into admiration; and you conuert the exerciſe of the moſt Heroicall Vertues, into a pleaſant kind of entertainment; and all this, as it vvere, in a ſporting, and reioycing way; vvhereby, in fine, the certaintie of thoſe vvords of Chriſt our. Lord, that <hi>His yoake, is ſvveet, and his burthen light,</hi> growes to be found effectually true. Since no Secular Ladie, takes ſo much pleaſure, in her ornaments, and attires, as your Reuerences find it, to be a thing of great ioy, and guſt for you, to
<pb facs="tcp:100776:31"/>
lead the life, euen of Angells. And ſuch doe you ſeem, really, to be, not only in the perfection of your liues, but in the vnion alſo, &amp; reſemblance of mindes, vvhich you maintaine therein, vvith one another; Since no two things, are more like one another, then you are all, amongſt your ſelues; and euerie one, to euerie other; in your ſpeech, in your modeſtie, in your humilitie, in your diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cretion, in your ſweetnes of Spirit; and finally, in your whole proceeding, and conuerſation. For, as the ſelf ſame vertue, and vvay of Life, animates you all: ſo doth it alſo frame you all, after one manner; and vve ſee, in you all, (as in ſo manie pure, Chriſtall glaſſes) one kind of face, and countenance, vvhich is that, of your Holie Mother <hi>Tereſa,</hi> deriued downe, and ſtamped vpon her Daughters. By meanes vvhereof, I ſee her now, (as I vvas ſaying, at the firſt) vvith more euidence, and clearnes, euen vvithout hauing formerly ſeen her; becauſe her Daughters, are not only the liuelie pictures of her internall features, but the aſſured teſtimonies
<pb facs="tcp:100776:31"/>
alſo, of her perfections. And theſe, are communicated to you all; and they paſſe from one of you, to another, with ſo great ſpeed (vvhich makes the Third Miracle-vp) that, in the ſpace of twentie yeares (for, this falls-out to be the time, ſince she founded her firſt Monaſterie, till now) Spaine alone, is growne to be ſo full of her Monaſteries, that aboue a thouſand Religious perſons, are daily ſeruing Almightie God, in this Countrie; amongſt vvhome, your Reuerences (vvho are the Religious Woemen of that Order) shine brightly; and that, vvith as much difference, as the greater, and fairer Starres, exceed the leſſer. For, as it was a happy Woeman, who gaue beginning to this Reformation: ſo it ſeemes, that the Woemen are they, who, in all things, haue aduantage of others; and not only are the great, &amp; guiding Lights of the Order, but are withall, the verie honour of our Nation, and the glorie, euen of the Age, wherein we liue. And, in fine, yow are thoſe faire Flowers, which beautifye the great barrennes,
<pb facs="tcp:100776:32"/>
of the Times; and are certainly, the moſt rare, and choice parts, of the Church of God; &amp; liuelie teſtimonies of the efficacie of Chriſt our Lord; and the euident proofe, of his Soueraigne vertue; &amp; finally, the expreſſe patterns, vvhereby vvee take the daily expe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rience, of vvhat is promiſed vs, by our Faith.</q>
            </p>
            <p>
               <q>And this is now, as much, as concernes her Daughters; vvhich is the former, of thoſe two Images, or Pictures, of your Holie Mother, vvhereof I ſpake. Nor, is the ſecond Image, or Picture, a whitt leſſe Miraculous, then that former; &amp; it conſiſts, in her Writings, &amp; Bookes; vvherein, vvithout anie queſtion at all, the Holie Ghoſt vouchſafed, and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolued, that holie Mother <hi>Tereſa</hi> should remaine, as a rare example, to the vvorld, &amp;c.</q> All theſe are the verie words, of Doctour <hi>Levvis de Leon.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>By this you therefore ſee what iudge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment vvas made, at that time, of this ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mirable Creature, our Glorious Saint. But, by way of full co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>cluſion, to as much, as I now intend to ſpeake of her excel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lencies,
<pb facs="tcp:100776:32"/>
I muſt needs add a Clauſe, or two, vvhich I find deliuered by another eminent, vviſe, &amp; learned Authour, &amp; it was <hi>Father Ribera,</hi> a Father of the Societie of IESVS, vvho vvrote her vvhole Life, at large; &amp; together with it, &amp; indeed, as a very part thereof, he published cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taine Exclamations, or lowde Aſpirations, vvhich her enamoured Soule vvas wont to make to Almighty God, together with certaine Aduertiſments alſo, concerning the ſenſe, and feeling of Spirit, vvhich she found in her ſelf; vvith a ſignification, how she vvas affected, towards his Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uine Maieſtie; and finally, how she be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>haued her ſelf then, in the growth of Prayer, and Perfection. Now, all this Account of her ſelf, had been deliuered, by her, in her owne hand, to her Ghoſtlie Father, (though one part of it, about a yeare ſooner then the other) for the en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>abling him the better, to direct her; and she did it all, vvhilſt she vvas yet, in the <hi>Monaſterie; of the Incarnation,</hi> vvhere she vvas placed firſt, before she had ſetled her owne Order, &amp; way of Life, accord<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to the primitiue Inſtitution thereof;
<pb facs="tcp:100776:33"/>
though yet, she had euen then, begunne to ſerue our Bleſſed Lord, in great earneſt. And then alſo, did his Diuine Maieſtie rayne downe abundance of Supernaturall Fauours, vpon her happie Soule; as the ſame exact Authour decla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>res. But, that iudgement, which he made vpon her, I will heer deliuer to you, ſince it is ſo very short; and withall, ſo very highly ſignificant. For, thus he ſaith: <q>By this, you may diſcerne, to how great perfection, this happie Soule ariued, in ſo short a time, which deſerues to caſt the world, into admiration. For, ſince she, in her beginnings, got-vp, towards the verie top of that Perfection, which is wont to be acquired, in this Life, euen by Saints; to what paſſe, would she ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riue, in the ſpace of two, or three and twentie yeares, which she liued after<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards; whilſt she daily went encreaſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, in the loue of Almightie God, by receauing ſo manie high Fauours, from his Diuine Maieſtie; by performing ſo manie Pennances; by enduring ſo great afflictions, &amp; tormets, through ſicknes: togeather with manie perſecutions, and
<pb facs="tcp:100776:33"/>
troubles; by founding ſo manie Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>naſteries; by gaining ſo manie Soules; by poſſeſſing ſo high Prayer; by vſing ſo continuall Mortification; &amp; finally, through ſuch an incomparable treaſure, as she acquired afterward, by a multi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tude of moſt excellent vvorkes. For, if her beginnings were ſuch, as out-ſtripp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed euen the concluſion of very perfect Soules: how farre shall vve imagine, that she vvould be ſure to ariue, and reach, ere she came to an end?</q>
            </p>
            <p>Theſe are the liuely teſtimonies, of this laſt, exact, and diligent Authour. And as for that former excellent diſcourſe, of Doctour <hi>Levvis de Leon,</hi> it ſerues alſo, to let vs ſee, very clearly, the perfections of her happie Children, the Religious Woemen of her Order. And, ſince euen the Chriſtian vvorld, at large, is vvont to call, &amp; know her, by the name of <hi>Mother Tereſa,</hi> how much more, haue the Reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gious, her deare, &amp; moſt dear Daughters, reaſon, to call her ſo, as they doe. Since, togeather with the ſtrictnes of their Rule, (a ſtrictnes yet, much more tending to the preſeruing, &amp; purifying their Mindes,
<pb facs="tcp:100776:34"/>
then, anie vvay, to the afflicting of their Bodies; (vvhatſoeuer the Diuel vvould faine make the vvorld beleiue, ſo to diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>courage the Seruants of God, from be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>coming his better Seruants, by liuing vnder this moſt holie, and happie Rule) there vvas euer ſo great indulgence in her, towards them, and ſuch a tender kinde of care, ouer the health, and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tentment, yea and euen, as it vvere, for the good humour of her Children, as that she might well deſerue the name of a hundred thouſand <hi>Mothers,</hi> all in one. For, that her verie kindnes, ariued euen thus farre, may be ſeen, in many paſſages both of her Rule, &amp; of her Life. So that, vpon the vvhole matter, it vvas a kinde of hard caſe, to decide, whether she were of more rigour to her ſelf; or of more in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dulgence, towards her Children. And she did expreſly require, that her Suc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſours should be alwaies carefull, to maintaine the verie ſelf ſame ſweet, and euen, as it vvere, kinde-harted Spirit, in the gouernment of all ſuch Soules, as should, euer, come to range themſelues by her Order. And it ſeemes, that not
<pb facs="tcp:100776:34"/>
only her counſaile was imparted to them then, but that her prayers, &amp; protection, continues now, to the ſelf ſame purpoſe; and that ſtill, she shrowdes, and shelters, them, vnder that care. For, the ſelf-ſame Spirit remaines ſo entirely truly, amongſt them, at this day, that, as they leade the liues of Angells, on the one ſide, ſo yet, doe they alſo, on the other, ſpend their time, vvith ſo much ioy, &amp; guſt, (through that incredible kind of peace, &amp; vnion of minde, vvhich they poſſeſſe, as vvell in order to their Superiours, as to them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelues) as if euerie one of them, vvere no leſſe, then mightily euen in loue, vvith euerie other; vvhich puts them into a kind of Heauen, before their time. Nay ſtill, she ſeemes, as it vvere, viſibly, to worke, in all kindes, for their aduantage.</p>
            <p>And heer, ſince this holie Saint tooke all the accidents, and occaſions, not only of her Children, but euen of thoſe Stran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gers, ſo extreamly, and extraordinarily, to hart, vvho applyed themſelues, to ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taine her helpe, whilſt she vvas yet, but an Inhabitant of this vvorld, I am con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fidently, yea and aſſuredly perſwaded,
<pb facs="tcp:100776:35"/>
that she vvill now, haue another manner of ſolicitude, for their good, and growth, in all happines, vvho shall celebrate, and deſire to ſerue her. Which I wish, that the whole world may doe; and, for my part, I am ſo much bound to our Bleſſed Lord (for which I adore him, vvith my whole hart) as to be ſure, that I will pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cure to make one.</p>

               <seg rend="decorInit">T</seg>HE very hauing of vertuous Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rents, and ſuch as liue in the feare of Almightie God, togeather with thoſe fauours, which I receaued from his Diuine Maieſtie, had been able, to haue made me good, if I had not been ſo very wicked. My Father was delighted, in reading good Bookes; and vſed to haue them in Spanish, that ſo his Children might alſo reade them. This conſideration, togeather with the care, which my Mother had, to make vs ſay our Prayers, and to put vs into a way of deuotion to our Bleſſed Ladie, and ſome other particular ſaints, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ganne to awake, and ſtirre me vp, when I was (to the beſt of my remembrance) about ſix, or ſeauen yeares old. It aſſiſted me alſo, towards this good end, to find, that there was no meanes for me, to winne the fauour of my Parents, but by the way of Vertue. My Father was a man of much charitie, towards poore people, and of compaſſion, towards the ſick; yea, and he had ſo much pittie, euen of his ſeruants, that he could neuer reſolue to
<pb n="2" facs="tcp:100776:38"/>
keepe anie ſlaues, for the tendernes which he had towards them. And there being once a ſlaue, in his houſe, who belonged to a Brother of his, he cauſed him to be treated, and fed, as if he had been one of his owne Children; and ſayd, through his great compaſſion, that he could not endure to ſee ſuch as he was, vnleſs they might be made free. He was a man of much truth; nor did euer anie creature heare him, either detract, or ſweare. He was exeedingly honeſt, and chaſt. My Mother alſo, was enriched with manie Vertues; and she paſſed through this life of hers, with grieuous ſickneſſes. Her chaſtitie, and puritie, was great, in the verie higheſt degree; and though she had an abundance of Beautie, yet was it neuer ſo much as heard, that ſhe gaue occaſion, for the world to conceaue, that ſhe made anie account of it, at all. For, comming afterwards to dye, when ſhe was but three and thirtie yeares old, the order of her attire, had yet been ſuch, as might haue well beco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>me a perſon of Age. She was of a moſt ſweet diſpoſition; and yet vvithall, of a very ſolid vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtanding. The afflictions, vvhich she ſuſtained in this life, vvere great; and she made a moſt Chriſtian end, when she dyed.</p>
            <p>VVe vvere three Siſters, and nine Brothers; and all, through the goodnes of Almightie God, vvere like our Parents, in being vertuous, except myſelf; though yet, I vvas the moſt beloued of them all, by my Father; and truly, till I beganne to offend Almightie God, he might ſeeme, to haue
<pb n="3" facs="tcp:100776:38"/>
had ſome reaſon. For it goes to my verie hart, to remember, and conſider, thoſe good inclinations, vvhich our Lord had giuen me; and the very lit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle I knew, how to ſerue myſelf thereof. My Brothers alſo vvere ſuch, in their proceeding, and vvay of life, as that they did not, by anie meanes, dis-aſſiſt me, from ſeruing Almightie God. One of them vvas almoſt of my yeares, and I loued him beſt, of them all; though yet, I loued them all, very much, as they alſo, did me. But vve tvvo, ioyned much togeather, in reading the Liues of Saints; and when I ſaw the Martyrdo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mes, through vvhich, ſome of them had paſſed, for the loue of our Lord, me thought they had bought Heauen (vvhere they vvere to ſee, and enioy his Diuine Maieſtie) very good cheape: And myſelf alſo deſired much, to dye ſo; though not yet, for the loue, vvhich I found, and felt my ſelf to beare him; but rather, that I might come, by ſo compendious a vvay, to enioy thoſe great feli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cities, which I had read, to be imparted in Heauen.

            <p>We found our ſelues much amazed, to per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceaue, in thoſe things, vvhich vve read, that both the Paine, and Glorie, of the next life, vvas to laſt for euer; and vve chanced, to ſpeake often, of this particular; and vve tooke pleaſure, in repeating theſe vvords, many times; For euer, For euer, For euer; and by continuing to pronounce them, long, and often, our Lord vvas pleaſed, to imprint the way of Truth, vpon my hart, in that verie infancie of mine.</p>
            <p>But novv, vvhen I ſavv it vvas impoſſible for me, to goe, where they might put me to death, for the loue of our Lord, my Brother, and I, proiected, how to become Heremits, at home; and ſo, in a cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taine Garden, vvhich belonged to the houſe, vve procured, to ſet vp ſome little Oratoryes, or Chap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pels, after the manner of Heremitages, the beſt we could; and vve aſſembled little ſtones, for that purpoſe, vvhich vvould inſtantly be falling downe againe; and ſo vve met vvith no meanes, to put out good deſires, in execution. But, in the meane time, I am not vvithout ſome feeling of deuo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, to conſider, hovv ſoone it pleaſed Almightie God, to giue me this kinde of tendernes towards him; vvhich aftervvards I grevv to looſe, through mine ovvne fault. I gaue Almes, as vvel as I could, though it vvere but little. I procured to be much alone, for the better doing my deuotions, vvhich vvere manie; and eſpecially that of the
<pb n="5" facs="tcp:100776:39"/>
Roſarie, to which, my Mother vvas much affected; and she endeauoured alſo, to make vs, ſo. I tooke particular contentment, vvhilſt I vvas playing vvith other Children, like myſelf, to frame certai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ne little things, like Monaſteries, as if vve had been Religious woemen; and me thought, I deſired to be one; though yet, not vvith ſuch vehemencie of affection, as I did thoſe other things, vvhereof I ſpake.</p>
            <p>I remember, that vvhen my Mother dyed, she left me a little leſs, then tvvelue yeares old; and as ſoone as I beganne to vnderſtand, hovv great a loſſe I had ſuſtained, by looſing her, I vvas very much afflicted; and ſo I vvent beſore an Image of our Bleſſed Ladie, and I humbly beſought her, vvith manie teares, that she vvould vouchſafe, to be my Mother. And though I performed this little action, but in a plaine, and ſimple manner; yet, me thinkes, I may vvel conceaue, that it hath ſerued me, to verie good purpoſe; for I haue moſt euidently found, the fauour of this Soueraigne Virgin, concerning all things, vvherein I haue recommended myſelf, to her care; and, in fine, ſhe hath brought me about, to her ſelf.</p>
            <p>It afflictes me to the very hart, to ſee, and conſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der, hovv poore thoſe impediments vvere, vvhich kept me from remaining entire, and conſtant, in thoſe good deſires, vvhich I beganne to haue. But, O my deare Lord, ſince it ſeemes, thou vvilt vouchſafe to ſaue me (and I beſeech thy Diuine Maieſtie, that it my be ſo) and to ſhevv me ſo
<pb n="6" facs="tcp:100776:40"/>
great fauours, as thou haſt donne me; might it not pleaſe thee (not for my intereſt, and profit, but for that high reuerence, vvhich is due to thy ſelf) to take order, that this houſe of my hart, vvherein thou ſhouldſt for euer remaine, might be no more defiled? Nay, it goes, O Lord, to my verie ſoule, euen to ſay thus much; becauſe I knovv, and feele, that the fault therof, vvas vvholy mine; for, as for thee, I finde clearly enough, that there wanted nothing at all, on thy part, to ſecure me, for being totally thine ovvne, euen from that tender age of mine. And if I vvould be content, to ſeeke ſome colour, to complaine of my Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rents; vvith as little reaſon alſo, can I doe that; ſince I could neuer diſcouer any thing in them, but all goodnes, and all care alſo, of my good. But paſſing on, from that tender age, to be able, to beginne to vnderſtand the benefits, and guifts of Nature, vvhich our Lord had beſtovved vpon me (vvhich others eſteemed, and ſayd, to be great) in ſteed of giueing him thankes for the ſame, I beganne, to ſerue my ſelf of them all, tovvards the offence of his Diuine Maieſtie; as I shall novv declare.</p>

            </argument>
            <p>I Belieue, that a certaine thing, vvhereof I vvil novv giue account, beganne to doe me a great deale of hurt. Sometimes I grovv to conſider, hovv ill thoſe Parents doe, vvho procure not, that their Children should be euer ſeing examples of Vertue, in all kindes. For, though my Mother were very eminent that vvay, (as I haue ſayd already) yet I tooke not ſo much of that good to myſelf, vvhen firſt I came to the vſe of Reaſon, no nor almoſt euen anie thing at all; and, on the other ſide, vvhatſoeuer there vvas of imperfect, and ill, did hurt me much. My Mother vvas very particularly affected, to reade Bookes of <hi>Caualleria,</hi> or vaine hiſtories; but she tooke not ſo much hurt, by that entertainment, as I did; becauſe it hindred not that vvorke the vvhile, about vvhich she vvas; but diſengaged vs, from other things, that ſo vve might reade them. And perhaps she did it alſo the rather, that ſhe might ſo, haue her thoughts leſſe bent, vpon the memorie of the great afflictions, vvhich she felt, and to employ alſo her Children in ſuch ſort, as to diuert them, from the thought of vvorſe things. My Father vvas yet ſo much
<pb n="8" facs="tcp:100776:41"/>
troubled at this, that particular care vvas had, that he might not kouvv it. But I, in the meane time, remained with the cuſtome of reading theſe Bookes; and that little fault of mine, vvhich euen I, myſelf, diſcerned therein, beganne to coole my good deſires; and vvas the reaſon, vvhy I alſo grevv to faile, in the reſt; and I made myſelf be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieue, that it vvas not very ill donne; though yet I ſpent manie howers, both of the day, and night, in ſo vaine an exerciſe; and though it vvere ſtill con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cealed from my Father. But I vvas poſſeſſed heer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vvith, in ſuch extremitie, that if perhaps, I could not gett ſome nevv Booke, I ſavv not, hovv I could be in contentment.</p>
            <p>I beganne alſo to make my ſelf fine; and to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſire, to grovv acceptable, in ſeeming handſome; and I tooke much care of my hands, and of my haire, and to get choice perfumes; togeather vvith all thoſe vanities, vvhich it vvas poſſible, for me to incurte, by this meanes; vvhich, I confeſſe, vvere enow; in regard, that I vvas very curious, in this kinde. I had only, no ill intention; nor deſired I, vpon anie tearmes, that anie Creature should offend Almightie God, vpon anie occaſion of mine; but I continued, in ſo great a curioſitie, for daintines, and cleanlines, as vvas euen beyond all reaſon; and thoſe things, vvhich for manie yeares, I conceaued to be of no ſinne at all, I finde novv, hovv very ill they vvere.</p>
            <p>Novv I had certaine Coſen-germans, vvho fre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quented my Fathers houſe, in familiar manner; no
<pb n="9" facs="tcp:100776:41"/>
others, hauing any ſuch libertie as that. For, my Father was very warie, and reſerued, in this kinde; but I would to God, he had alſo been ſo, in reſpect of my Coſins; becauſe now, I diſcerne the danger, that it is, for ſuch as are to beginne to plant Vertue in the ſoule, to treate with perſons, who know not, in true account, how great the Vanitie of the world is; but rather are inclined to awake, &amp; ſtirre others vp, to caſt themſelues alſo, into the ſame danger. Theſe kinſmen of mine, were, in effect, of mine owne age; or rather a little elder then I. VVe were vſually togeather: and they carried great affection to me, and in all things, which gaue them contentment, I was willing to vphold the diſcourſe; and gaue eare, to the ſucceſſes of their loue to others: and ſuch other fooleries, as are good for nothing. Yea, and, which is worſe, I grew, by theſe meanes, to lay my ſoule open, to be looked vpon, by certaine idle thoughts, which were the cauſe of all the en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſuing ill. If I were worthie, to aduiſe Parents, I would wiſh them to take great heed, what kinde of perſons they admitted, to conuerſe with their Children; for, much harme, may grow from thence; ſince the naturall condition of Mankinde, wil neuer clime vp, ſo eaſily towards good, as decline towords ill; at leaſt, it hapned ſo, to me. I had a Siſter, much elder, then my ſelf, of whoſe puritie, and goodnes (whereof ſhe had great ſtore) I tooke no part; but I failed not, to take all hurt, from a certaine other kins-woman of mine,
<pb n="10" facs="tcp:100776:42"/>
who had alſo, familiar entrie into our houſe. Now ſhe, was of ſo light, and guiddie a conuer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſation, that my Mother had vſed ſeuerall diligen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces, to diuert her, from familiaritie with vs. For it ſeemes, ſhe did euen half foreſee the miſchief, which was to grow vpon me, by her meanes; and yet, on the other ſide, the occaſion was ſo great, &amp; faire, whereby ſhe was to enter, that euen my Mother, could not tell, how to decline it. VVith this Creature (as I was ſaying) did I come to haue much delight, to entertaine myſelf. VVith her, was my conuerſation, and my diſcourſe; becauſe I found, that ſhe employed her ſelf willingly, vpon all thoſe wayes, of paſſing my time, wherein I delighted moſt. Yea, and, ſometimes, ſhe would embarke me in them, of her ſelf; giuing me part, and knowledge, of all her owne conuerſations, and vanities. Till I beganne to be familiar with her (when, I thinke, I was ſome foureteen yeares old, or rather a little more) I meane, till ſhe had wrought her ſelfe into ſo much frie<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>dſhip with me, as to make me partake the knowledge of all her little affaires) I am much inclined to thinke, that I had neuer forfeited the fauour of Almightie God, by anie Mortall Sinne; nor euer forſaken the feare of his Diuine Maieſtie; though yet ſtill, I feared more, to looſe my honour. This laſt point, was of power enough with me, for not permit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting mee to looſe it outright; nor doe I conceiue, that any thing of this world, could make mee change that reſolution; nor was there any perſon
<pb n="11" facs="tcp:100776:42"/>
aliue, who could winne mee, to yeild my ſelfe vp, to that miſery. I would to God, I had ſo abounded in ſtrength, &amp; courage, as not to make one pace, againſt the honour of his Diuine Maieſtie; as euen a kinde of naturall conſtitution of minde, confirmed me, towards the not looſing that, wherein I held the honour of this world, to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiſt; though yet I conſidered not, the while, that I loſt, euen that alſo, manie wayes. For the vaine vpholding heerof, I had euen an extreame reſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lution; though yet, for the proper, and fitt meanes, which was neceſſarie for preſeruing it, I vſed none at all; only I was earneſt, in taking care, that I might, by no meanes, looſe myſelf, outright.</p>
            <p>My Father, and my Siſter, were much troubled about this friendſhip of mine, and reproued me for it, very often; but yet, they being vnable to remoue the occaſion of her coming to vs, at times, their diligences were euer wont, to fall ſhort; for, my ſagacity, &amp; ſharpe conceipt, in contriuing anie thing, which might be ill, was very great. I am ſometimes, vpon this occaſion, in a wonder, at how much hurt, ill companie may doe; and if it had not been mine owne caſe, I could hardly be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieue it; eſpecially, when it occurrs, in the time of innocent, and freſh youth; for then, doth it greateſt hurt; and I could wiſh, that Pare<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ts would take ſome warning by me, that ſo they might conſider it wel. For the truth is, that this conuer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſation did worke ſuch an entire change vpon me, that I, who formerly, had not only a Soule, but
<pb n="12" facs="tcp:100776:43"/>
euen a kinde of naturall conſtitution, inclined to Vertue, was growne to haue, in effect, no ſem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>blance, or ſigne at all, thereof; and it ſeemes, that both ſhe, and yet another, who was, vpon the matter, of the ſame humour, had imprinted their owne conditions vpon me. From hence alſo, I am growne to vnderſtand, how pretious a thing, good companie is; and I hold it for as good, as a moſt certaine truth, that, if in that age of mine, I had conuerſed with onlie vertuous perſons, my ſelfe ſhould haue proued accompliſhed, in the way of Vertue; and that, if, in thoſe tender yeares, I had mett with ſuch, as would haue made it their buſines, to make me feare Almighty God, my ſoule would haue gathered ſuch ſtrength, as might haue kept it from falling. But afterward, this feare of God, growing to be loſt, the care only of my honour remained; which gaue me a kinde of torment, in whatſoeuer I did.</p>
            <p>But now, with thinking, that ſuch, and ſuch things, would neuer be knowne, I preſumed to doe manie, which were both againſt my honour, and againſt God. In the beginning, thoſe things did me harme, as I am apt to thinke; though yet perhaps, that hapned not, by the fault of others, but by mine owne; but afterward, mine owne malice fell out, to be ſufficient, for mine owne miſchief; together with the help of my Maides, who were readie enough, for anie thing, that was naught. If anie one of them, had but ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uiſed me well, it would haue ſerued my turne; but
<pb n="13" facs="tcp:100776:43"/>
intereſt blinded them; as my inclination, did me. And though I neuer was addicted to much ill (for euen naturally I abhorred ſuch things, as concer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned diſhoneſtie) yet I liked to paſſe my time in faire conuerſation; but being afterward growne into the occaſions, the danger was neerer at hand; and that brought alſo my Father, and my Brothers, into ſome. But God, deliuered me out of them, in ſuch ſort, as that it well appeared, how he was pleaſed to procure, euen againſt my will, to preſerue me, from my totall perdition; though yet ſtill, things could not be carried ſo priuatly, as that my honour did not ſuffer preiudice by it, euen abroad; beſides a little ſuſpicion of my Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, at home. For I remember not, that they ari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ued to be three moneths, of my walking, vp, and downe, in theſe vanities, when they carried me to a certaine Monaſterie, in this towne, where they were wont to giue education, to ſuch, as I was; though yet, not ſo vntoward, as myſelf. But it was donne with great diſcretion, and reſerue; for only I, and a kinſman of mine, knew of it; and they ſtayed a while, for a certaine coniuncture of things, to keepe it from ſeeming new, or ſtrange; for, my Siſter was then lately married; and ſo, it would not ſeeme, ſo very handſome, that I ſhould ſtay at home alone, without a Mother.</p>
            <p>The loue, which my Father bore me, was ſo extreame (and ſo alſo was my diſſimulation) that he could not belieue ſo much ill of me, as I deſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ued; and therefore I was not falne into his diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fauour.
<pb n="14" facs="tcp:100776:44"/>
For, the time hauing been but ſhort, though perhaps, he might happen to heare of ſome little wiſpering, yet it could neuer be deli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uered to him, with anie certaintie; in regard, that I hauing ſo tender a care of myſelf, in point of honour, all my diligences were employed, vpon keeping things ſecret; and I conſidered not, the while, how impoſſible a thing it was, to hide anie thing from him, by whome, all things are ſeen. O my God! what a miſchief doth it bring vpon the world, to make light of this; and to thinke, that ſuch things can be ſecret, as are repugnant to thy will? For my part, I hold it for certaine, that many great ſinnes would be forborne, if once we would grow to vnderſtand, that the buſines doth not conſiſt, in ſaueing our ſelues harmleſſe from men; but in keeping our ſelues very farre, from diſguſting Almightie God.</p>
            <p>During the firſt eight dayes of my being in the Monaſterie, I feit it much, euen for it ſelf; but yet more, for the ſuſpicion I had, that my vanitie was diſcouered, then for that I was placed there. For now already, I became wearie of doing ill; and I failed not, to haue great feare, of Almightie God, whenſoeuer I offended him; and I procured, to Confeſſe myſelf often.</p>
            <p>But after thoſe eight dayes, yea &amp; peraduen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture ſooner, I grew to be better pleaſed there, then euen in mine owne Fathers houſe. All the Reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gious were glad to be in my companie; for in this, our Lord endewed me with a particular grace,
<pb n="15" facs="tcp:100776:44"/>
that I alwayes, gaue contentment, whereſoeuer I was; and ſo I vſed euer, to be much beloued. And though I were, at that time, in extremitie of being auerſe from becoming a Religious woeman, yet I ioyed to ſee ſo good Religious woemen, as they were, after an eminent proportion, in that houſe; and of great puritie, and obſeruance, and recol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lection.</p>
            <p>But yet, notwithſtanding all this, the Diuel gaue not ouer to tempt me; and he found out ſuch perſons from abroad, as might diſquiet me, with certaine meſſages of theirs. But, in regard there was no great oportunitie for thoſe things, they quickly ceaſed; and my ſoule beganne againe, to accuſtome it ſelfe to the good impreſſions, of my firſt youth; and I ſaw, how great fauour, Almighty God doth them, whome he caſts into their compa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nie, who are good. And it ſeemes, as if the Diuine Maieſtie had gone looking, and yet looking agai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ne, by what meanes he might bring me back, to himſelf. Bleſſed be thou, O lord, who didſt endure me ſo long; Amen. One particular there was, which, it ſeemes, might turne a little, to my excuſe, if I had not been guiltie of ſo manie faults: And it is, that the Conuerſation, which I held, was with one, who, by way of marriage, ſeemed to make it probable, to end well. And I informing myſelf, about it, of my Confeſſarius, and of others alſo, with whome I conſulted in manie things, they told me, that I offended not Almighty God.</p>
            <p>But now, one of the Religious was lodged,
<pb n="16" facs="tcp:100776:45"/>
where we, who were ſecular perſons, were alſo accommodated; and it ſeemes, that our lord was pleaſed to giue me light, by her meanes; as I will now declare.</p>

Of this, I con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiue, &amp; confeſſe, I did neuer, at anie time, giue ouer, to <gap reason="illegible: faint" extent="4 letters">

               </gap>ery glad to heare. She began, one day, to tell n<gap reason="illegible: faint" extent="4 letters">
                  <desc>••••</desc>
               </gap>ow ſhe was growne, to be a Reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gious woman, by the onlie reading of that place, of the Ghoſpell, <hi>That manie are called; but fevv, are choſen.</hi> And ſhe ſpake much to me, of the reward, which our lord is wont to giue to ſuch, as leaue all things, for the loue of him. In a word, this good ſocietie of hers, beganne quickly, to put to flight, thoſe cuſtomes, and condiuons, which ill compa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nie had brought vpon me; and reſtored the deſire
<pb n="17" facs="tcp:100776:45"/>
of eternall bleſſings, to my thoughts; yea, and to ſtripp me, in ſome part, of that great enmitie, and oppoſition, againſt becominge a Religious woema<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, which formerly had been very extreame. But now, if I chanced to ſee anie one, who ſhed manie teares for her ſinnes; or els, that ſhe abounded in other vertues; I carried a kinde of enuie towards her; though as for this hart of mine, it was ſo very hard, and euen impenetrable in this kinde, that if I ſhould haue read ouer, the whole Hiſtorie of the Paiſion of our Bleſſed Sauiour, I was not able to ſhed a teare; and this put me to a great deale of paine. In this Monaſterie, did I remaine, a yeare, and a half; and I was much im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proued there. I beganne to ſay manie Vocall prayers; and I procured, of all the Religious, that they would recommend me much, to Almightie God; to the end, that he might place mee in ſuch a way of Life, as, wherein, I might be likelie, to ſerue him beſt. But ſtill I did euen deſire, that I might not be a Religious woman, and that this, might not be the ſtate, which God would giue me; though yet ſtill, I was afrayd to be married. But now, at the end of the time, when I was there, I already beganne to be more inclined to be a Religious woeman; though yet, not in that verie Houſe where I was then in regard of thoſe actions of extraordinarie vertue, and pennance, which, I vnderſtood, they vſed; and which ſeemed to me, of too much rigour. Yet there were ſome of the yonger ſort of themſelues, who encouraged
<pb n="18" facs="tcp:100776:46"/>
me, towards thoſe formet more imperfect thoughts; for, if they all, had been of one opinion, it would haue been much, to my true aduantage. I had alſo a great friend, in another Monaſterie; and this was partly a reaſon, why, if I would be a Religious woman, I would not yet be ſo, in anie other place, then where that friend of mine was. For I carried more reſpect, to my ſenſualitie, and vanitie, then to the benefit, which I might bring to my ſoule. Theſe good thoughts of being a Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligious woman, were often coming to me, by times; but they were inſtantly ſent away againe; and I could not yet perſuade myſelf, to be one.</p>
            <p>At this time, though my ſelf were not alto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether vvithout care of my cure, yet our Lord vvas much fuller of deſire, to diſpoſe me, for that ſtate, vvhich vvould be beſt, for my ſoule. He then gaue me ſo great a ſicknes, that I vvas forced, to returne home, to my Fathers houſe. And vven once, I vvas recouered, they conducted me, to giue a Viſit, to one of my Siſters, in the Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trie; for, the loue, vvhich I bore her, vvas extreame, and by her vvill, I ſhould neuer haue parted from her. Her Huſband did alſo loue me very much; and, at leaſt, he regaled me highly. And euen for this alſo, am I obliged to our Bleſſed Lord; ſince in all places vvhere I haue been, I was euer treated after this manner; notwithſtanding that I haue been, as vnthankefull to him for it, as for his other fauours.</p>
            <p>Now by the way towards my Siſter, I had an
<pb n="19" facs="tcp:100776:46"/>
Vnckle, my Fathers Brother, vvho vvas a very aduiſed man, and of great vertue. He vvas a Widdower; and our Lord vvent diſpoſing him, for his owne ſeruice; and vvhen he grew on, to be of yeares, he left the vvorld, and became a Reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gious man; and ended his life, in ſuch ſort, that I belieue, he is now enioying the Viſion of Almigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie God. But he vvould needs haue me (as I paſſed) remaine with him, ſome dayes. His vſuall exerciſe, vvas to reade good Bookes, in the Spaniſh toung; and his diſcours vvas moſt commonly of God, and of the vanitie of the world; and thoſe Bookes, vvould he alſo make me reade. And though I had no great liking to this, yet I pretended that I had; for, in the point of giuing contentment to others, I had euer an extreame kind of care, how deare ſoeuer it might coſt me. So that the ſame thing, vvich had been vertue in others, was a great fault in me; becauſe I often carried my ſelf therin, vvith much indiſcretion. O my God! By vvhat vvaies did thy Diuine Maieſtie goe diſpoſing me, for that ſtate, in vvhich thou vvert pleaſed, that I ſhould ſerue thee; ſince thou didſt euen force me thus, as it vvere, againſt my vvill, to force my ſelf. Be thou bleſſed for all eternitie; Amen.</p>
            <p>Though I ſtayed not long, in that place; yet, by the effect, vvhich the vvords of Almighty God, wrought in my hart, whether they vvere read, or heard by me, together vvith ſo good companie, as that vvas, vvherein I found my ſelf then, I came to vnderſtand this Truth, vvhich I had learnt,

when I was yet but a Child, That, namely, all was nothing; and how great, the vanitie of the vvorld vvas; and that all, vvould be, ſhortly, at an end; and that I might iuſtly feare, leaſt dying in that condition, wherein I vvas, I might chance goe dropping downe into Hell. And though my vvill did not yet entirely reſolue me, to make my ſelf a Religious vvoman, yet I vvell diſcerned, that it vvas the better, and more ſecure ſtate; and ſo, by little and little, I determined, to force my hart, to embrace it. In this battaile, I remained three moneths, conſtraining my ſelf, at laſt, by this fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowing diſcours, and reaſon: that the troubles, and afflictions, of being a Religious vvoma<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, could not be greater, then the paine of Purgatorie; And that I, hauing ſo vvel deſerued Hell, it vvas not to be eſteemed too much, if I remained, vvhilſt I ſhould liue, heer, as in Purgatorie, ſo that afterward, I might goe ſtreight to heauen. For this, was my de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſire. But yet euen in this inclination of mine, to take this ſtate vpon me, I doubt I vvas more moued, by a kinde of ſeruile Feare, then by Loue.</p>
            <p>The Diuel, in the meane time, repreſented to me, that I would neuer be able, to ſuffer the diffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culties, and troubles of a Religious life; becauſe formerly, I had been vſed ſo delicately, and vvas ſo nice. But yet, againſt this alſo, I defended my ſelf, as vvell as I could, by the afflictions, vvhich Chriſt our Lord, endured for me; and that ſo, it vvould not be much, for me to endure ſome, for him, I ought alſo to haue conſidered, that he would
<pb n="21" facs="tcp:100776:47"/>
giue me help, to beare them. Yet I remember not, whether I had this laſt conſideration, or no; but I am ſure, I had temptations enow, about that time. I then alſo grew, to haue great fitts of fainting, by a burning Feauer, into wich I fell; for I alwaies had little health.</p>
            <p>But it gaue mee euen my life, at that time, that already I was growne to loue good Bookes; and ſo I came to reade the Epiſtles of S. Ierome, which holpe me to ſuch hart, and courage, as to make me reſolue, that I would impart my purpoſe, to my Father; which, in effect, was euen as much for me, as to take the verie Habit vpon mee. For I was euer ſo affected, to maintaine the point of Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour, that, mee thinkes, I could neuer haue turned back againe, vpon any tearmes, when I had firſt engaged my ſelfe, by ſpeaking any one word, to the contrary. But he loued me, to ſo ſtrange a pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portion, that, by no meanes, I could winne his conſent; nor was the interceſſion of ſuch perſons, as I procured to moue him, in order to my end, of anie power at all, to preuaile. The moſt that I could get at his hands, was, that, when he ſhould be dead, I might doe, what I liſted, with my ſelf. But, as for me, I was in doubt, of mine owne great weaknes; as fearing, that I might looſe ground, and fall back againe: And ſo, I thought, it was not fitt for me, to content my ſelf with the offer which he made; and I procured therefore, to ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taine my end, by another meanes; which I will now declare.</p>

               <p>VVherein she relates, hovv our Lord aſſiſted her, to force herſelf, to take the Habit of Religion; And of the manie infirmities, vvhich he began to bring vpon her.</p>
            </argument>
            <p>IN theſe dayes, whilſt I was walking on, with my hart, in ſuch determinations, or ſtrong pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſes, as I haue heer deſcribed, I perſwaded one of my Brothers, to become a Religious man; diſcourſing to him, vpon the vanitie of the world; and ſo we, both of vs, agreed, to goe very early together, one morning, to the Monaſterie, where that friend of mine remained, who was ſhe, to whome I carried ſo great affection; though yet, in this laſt firme purpoſe of mine, I was growne to be of ſuch reſolution, that I vvould liue, vvhere<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeuer I thought, I might ſerue God beſt, or my Father ſhould deſire moſt, that I might be; for now, I ſought more earneſtly, for the good of my ſoule; and made no account at all, of reſt, or eaſe. And I remember (to the verie vttermoſt, of what I am able to call to minde, and according to the verie rigour of truth) that, whilſt I was going out of my Father's houſe, I belieue not, that the ſharpnes of ſenſe, will be able to be greater, euen in the verie inſtant, or agonie of my death, then it was then. For it ſeemed to me; as if euerie bone,
<pb n="23" facs="tcp:100776:48"/>
which I had in my bodie, had been diſioynted from all the reſt. And there being no ſuch loue of God in me, at that time, as vvas able to quench that loue, vvhich my hart carried to my Father, and Friends; all that, vvhich then I did, vvas vvith ſo mighty a violence, that if God had not giuen me great help, mine owne conſideration would neuer haue bee<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> able to carry me on; but heer, he allowed me ſuch courage, euen againſt myſelf, that I had power, to put my purpoſe, in execution.</p>
            <p>At the inſtant of my taking the Habit, our Lord gaue me vvell to vnderſtand, hovv highly he fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uours them, vvho offer themſelues violence, for the doing him anie ſeruice; though yet, no bodie had found by me, but that I entred into the vvay of Religious Obſeruance, vvith much facility, and good liking. But at that verie inſtant, I tooke ſo great co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>tentment, to put my ſelf into that manner of life, as hath neuer failed me once, till this verie hower. And God changed that drynes, vvherein my ſoule had formerly been, into an extreame tendernes; and all the obſeruances of Religion, gaue me great delight; yea, and it is a moſt certaine truth, that vvhilſt I vvas, ſometimes, going, vp, and downe, to ſweepe the houſe, at ſuch howers, as, before, I had been vvont to employ vpon the gallanterie, and regalo of my perſon, and vvent conſidering, that now I vvas free from that ſubiection, it gaue me a particular ioy; and that, ſo very great, that it amazed me; nor vvas it in my power, to vnderſtand, from vvhence the ſame
<pb n="24" facs="tcp:100776:49"/>
ſhould come. VVhen I remembred, and co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ſidered this; there could be nothing, how grieuous ſoeuer, vpon vvhich, if it vvere ſett before me, I ſhould not haue ventured to attempt. For I haue already, good experience of things enow, to aſſure me, that ſince God did help me, in the beginning, to reſolue to doe ſuch things, as theſe (vvhich being only donne for the loue of God he ordaines, for our greater merit afterward, that our ſoules ſhould be in ſome trouble, and terrour, at the firſt; and the greater that trouble is, the greater, and the more ſauourie alſo, vvill the reward therof, fall out to be, if vve goe through, vvith the buſines) his Maieſtie vvil alſo be pleaſed, to recompenſe them, highly vvel, euen in this life; by ſuch vvayes, as he only, vvho enioyes them, can vnderſtand. This, I ſay, I haue found true, by experience, in manie particulars of great moment. And therefore, if I vvere a perſon, vvho might be vviſhed to giue my opinion, I vvould neuer aduiſe anie Creature. that, vvhen anie good inſpiration did often moue, and ſet vpon a ſoule, it ſhould giue it ouer, for feare of not performing the vvorke. For, if one goe on, meerly, and purely, for the onlie loue, of our Lord, there muſt be no feare at all, of good ſucceſſe; ſince the ſame Lord is powerfull enough, to preuaile in all things; And let him be euer bleſſed, Amen.</p>
            <p>Theſe fauours, vvhich thou hadſt, hitherto, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtowed vpo<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> me, out of thine owne meer goodnes, and greatnes, might vvell haue been ſufficient, (O
<pb n="25" facs="tcp:100776:49"/>
thou, my Soueraigne Good, and repoſe of my ſoule) to draw me towards thee, by ſo manie vvindings, and turnings, to ſo ſafe a vvay of life; and to a Houſe, vvhere there are ſo manie ſeruants of thine, of vvhome I might learne to grow vp in pleaſing thee. But heer I know not, how I can paſſe on, to thinke of anie thing els, vvhen I con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſider the manner of my Profeſſion; and the great reſolution, and guſt, vvherewith I made it; and the Eſpouſalls, vvhich I perfected vvith thee. For I cannot ſpeake of this, vvithout teares; which were to be, euen of bloud; and not vvithout the breaking of my verie hart (vvhich yet could not be too great a demonſtration) vvhen I vveigh, how deeply I offended thee afterward. Now, me thinkes, that I had reaſon before, in not deſiring ſo great a dignitie, as this; conſidering, how ill I vvere like to employ it. But thou, O my Lord, vvert pleaſed to permitt, that I might vſe this fauour ſo ill, twentie yeares togeather; and vvouldſt content thy ſelf, to be the perſon af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fronted, that I might be the perſon, improued. For, it ſeemes not to me now, O my God, that I made thee anie promiſe, of anie thing, but only, that I vvould keepe no promiſe, vvich I had made thee; though yet, my intention vvas not ſuch, at that time.</p>
            <p>And yet, I finde my actions, to haue growne afterward, to be ſuch, that I may very vvell thinke, I ſcarce know, vvhat kind of intention I had. And thus, it may the better be ſeen, vvho thou art; O
<pb n="26" facs="tcp:100776:50"/>
my Spouſe, and my God; and who I am. For it is really, an expreſſe truth, that the grief, for my very great ſinnes, is tempered in me, manie times, by the contentment, which this conſideration giues me, that my ſinnefulnes may proue a meanes, to make the multitude of thy mercies, be vnder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtood. For, in whome, O Lord, can they euer ſhine ſo brightly, as in me; who haue, by my wicked actions, ſo obſcured thoſe great fauours, which thou beganſt to doe me? Ah, woe is me, O my Creatour; for, if I looke for anie excuſe, I can find none; nor hath anie creature the fault of it, but only my ſelf; and if I would pretend to pay thee anie thing, for the leaſt part of that Loue, which thou beganſt to ſhew me, I ſhould not know, how to employ it, vpon anie thing, but only thy ſelf; and thereby, might all be redreſſed, ſince I neuer deſerued the ſame. Nor was I euer ſo happie as to doe euen this; and therefore now, O Lord, let thy mercie vouchſafe, to ſupply all wants.</p>
            <p>But now, the change, which I made of my life, and the difference of my food, at this time, from the former, beganne to doe me hurt, in the way of health; for though the contentment, which I had, was great, yet would it not ſerue the turne. My fitts of fainting, and ſwooning, beganne againe to encreaſe; and ſuch a hideous beating of the hart, came vpon me, as amazed all them, who ſaw it; beſides manie other infirmities. And thus I paſſed on, my firſt yeare, with a kinde of health, which was ill enough; though yet, within that time, I
<pb n="27" facs="tcp:100776:50"/>
conceaue my ſelf, not to haue offended God, much.</p>
            <p>But my ſicknes being ſo great, that it depriued me almoſt of my ſenſes (yea and ſometimes, I was vvholy depriued) the diligences, which my Father vſed for my recouerie, vvere alſo very great; and vvhen the Doctours of thoſe parts, found no re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>medie, he procured to get me remoued, to a cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taine place, vvhere there vvas great fame of the curing manie other infirmities; and ſo, they aſſured themſelues, that they vvould be able to doe alſo, vvith mine. That friend, vvhome I mentioned to be in that Houſe, vvent vvith me; for ſhe vvas of yeares; and in the Monaſterie, vvhere ſhe liued, they made no Vow of Clauſure. I ſtayd almoſt a yeare, in that other place; and, during three moneths therof, I ſuffred ſo exceſſiue torments, by the manner of the Cure, vvich was very rigorous, that I know not, how I vvas able to endure them; and though I did endure them, yet, me thinkes, it vvas not my Bodie, vvhich could doe it; as I vvil now declare.</p>
            <p>This Cure vvas to be taken in hand, in the be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginning of Sommer; and I vvent in the beginning of VVinter. All this meane time, I remained in the houſe of that Siſter, of vvhome I ſpoke before, vvho dwelt in the Countrie; becauſe I vvas then, neer the place; and yet it vvas very troubleſome, to be going, and coming, to, and fro. VVhen I de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parted from that Vncle of mine, vvhome I de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clared my ſelfe, to haue viſited in the vvay, he gaue me a certaine Booke, vvich is called, The third
<pb n="28" facs="tcp:100776:51"/>
A. B. C.; which treats of the manner of Prayer, with Recollection. Now, though in that firſt yeare, I had read ſome good Bookes, forbearing vtterly, to looke vpon anie other (for I was not ignorant, of the hurt, which ſuch as thoſe, had donne me) yet I knew not, how to proceede in Prayer, nor how to obtaine Recollection; and ſo I was very glad of this Booke, and determined to follovv that way, to the vttermoſt of my power. And, ſince our Lord had already been pleaſed, to beſtow the guift of teares vpon me; and ſince I de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lighted alſo in reading, I beganne to ſpend ſome good fitts of time, in ſolitude; and to Confeſſe my<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf very often; and, in a word, to addreſſe myſelf, by that way; eſteeming that Booke to be my Maiſter. For I could meet with no other Maiſter, (I meane, a Ghoſtlie Father) who was able to vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtand me; though I fought ſuch an one, almoſt twentie yeares, after this time. VVhich accident, did me hurt enough, towards the making me turne back often; yea, and for the making me looſe myſelf. But ſuch an one, would haue daily aſſiſted me, to lay aſide, and leaue thoſe occaſions, which I tooke, to offend Almightie God.</p>
            <p>In theſe beginnings, his Diuine Maieſtie be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ganne to doe me ſo great fauours, that at the end of the time, when I remained there, (which was about nine moneths) in this way of ſolitude; (though I were not ſo free from offending God, as the Booke appointed; which I neglected, as holding it impoſſible, to continue ſtill, ſo watchfull
<pb n="29" facs="tcp:100776:51"/>
ouer myſelf) I was carefull, not to commit anie Mortall ſinne; and I would to God, I had alwaies been ſo; but of Venialls, I made no great account; and this was that, in fine, which deſtroyed me. But our Lord began to regale me ſo much, by this way, that he vouchſafed me the favour, to giue me Quiet Prayer; and ſometimes, it came ſo farre, as to arriue to Vnion; though I vnderſtood, neither the one, nor the other; nor how much they both, deſerued to be prized. But I belieue, it would haue been a great deale of happines, for me, to haue vnderſtood the certainty thereof. True it is, that this Vnion reſted with me, for ſo ſhort a time, that, perhaps, it might ariue to be, but as of an <hi>Aue Maria;</hi> yet I remained with ſo very great effects therof, that, with not being then, ſo much as twentie yeares old, me thought, I found the whole world vnder my feet; and ſo I remember well, that I was wont to carrie great compaſſion towards ſuch, as followed the wayes of the world; though it were, but euen in lawfull things.</p>
            <p>I Procured, the beſt I could, to carry our Lord, who is our true Good, ſtill preſent with me; and euen within me; and this was the manner of my prayer. If I thought vpon anie paſſage, or Myſte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rie, I repreſented it, to the interiour, of myſelf; and other times, I ſpent in reading good Bookes; which was all the recreation, that I had. For God gaue not me the talent of diſcourſing with my Vnderſtanding, nor to help my ſelf, by the vſe of my Imagination, which I haue ſo heauie, and
<pb n="30" facs="tcp:100776:52"/>
groſſe, that euen to thinke, and repreſent within my ſelf, ſo much as the Humanitie of our Bleſſed Lord, (which I endeauoured to doe) was yet more, then I could poſſibly performe. And, how<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſoeuer, by this way, of not being able to employ, and ſet the Vnderſtanding on worke, in the way of diſcourſe, men may ſooner ariue to Contem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plation, if they perſeuer therin; yet is it very trou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bleſome, and painefull; becauſe, if the employment of the will, doe faile ſo farre of obtaining the true end, as that their Loue finde no preſent Obiect to embrace, the ſoule is left, as it were, without anie exerciſe, and reſt, at all; and that kinde of ſolitude, and drynes, giues much trouble; and opens the way, to a combat, and confuſion of thoughts.</p>
            <p>As for perſons, who haue this diſpoſition, there is need of a greater puritie of Conſcience, then for ſuch others, as are able to worke, and diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>courſe, by way of the Vnderſtanding. For he, who is able to diſcourſe, vpon what this world is; and vpon what he owes to Almightie God; and how much he ſuffered for him; and how little himſelf is able to ſerue him; and vvhat he beſtowes vpon ſuch, as loue him; vvil be able to draw a doctrine from thence, vvhich may defend him from im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pertinent thoughts, and occaſions, and dangers. But he, vvho can not ſerue himſelf thereof, runnes more hazard; and ſhall therefore doe vvell, to em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ploy himſelf much, vpon reading; ſince, on his owne part, he knowes not, hovv to help himſelf.</p>
            <p>This manner of proceeding, is ſo very ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>treamly
<pb n="31" facs="tcp:100776:52"/>
painefull, that, if the Directour, who in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtructs, ſhall vrge him much, to pray, without reading (which greatly helpes to recollect the perſon, who proceeds thus; yea and is neceſſarie for him, though it be little, which he reades; ſaue only in time, and place of Mentall Prayer, which he is not able to make) I ſay, if without this help, they make him ſtay much in Prayer, it wil be im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſſible, for him, to laſt long, therin; and beſides, it wil doe him hurt, in point of health; for it is ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>treamly painefull.</p>
            <p>Now it ſeemes, that our Lord prouided ſo for me, as that I ſhould not finde anie Creature, to inſtruct me; for it had been impoſſible for me, I thinke, to continue to endure this extreame diffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cultie, and theſe great aridities, through my not being able (as I was ſaying) to diſcourſe. In all theſe times, I neuer durſt beginne to pray, without a Booke in my hand, vnleſſe it were inſtantly, vpon my hauing Communicated; and as hartily was my ſoule afrayd to be in Prayer, without a Booke, as if I had been to fight, with a multitude of people; but by this remedie, of a good Booke, which was as a Co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>panie of Guard, or as a Buckler, vpon which, the blowes of manie thoughts, were to be receaued, I went on, with comfort. For, that drynes vvas not ordinarie vvith me, though I had it alwaies, vvhenſoeuer I had no Booke in my hand; but then, my ſoule was inſtantly in diſorder; and my thoughts vvandred, vp, and downe. But vvith reading, I beganne to recollect them, and
<pb n="32" facs="tcp:100776:53"/>
carried my hart chearfully, and delightfully on; yea, and, manie times, in the verie opening my Booke, I found myſelf need no more. Sometimes alſo, I read little; and ſometimes, much; according to the fauour, which our Lord vvas pleaſed to doe me, more, or leſſe. And it ſeems to me, that if, in thoſe beginnings, whereof I ſpeake, I might haue had Bookes, and meanes to continue in ſolitude, there would haue been no danger, which could haue been able, to depriue me, of ſo great a good, And I am alſo apt to thinke, that, by the fauour of Almightie God, it would haue proued ſo, if I had had a Directour, or ſome perſon, who might haue counſelled me, to auoide occaſions, in thoſe be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginnings, and to make me forſake them quickly, if I had been entred into them; yea, and, though the Diuel ſhould then, haue ſet openly, vpon me, I thinke, that I would neuer haue been brought, to offend God grieuouſly againe; but he vvas ſo very craftie, and I ſo wretched, that all theſe reſolutions of mine, did me little good; but the time, vvhich I ſpent in Gods ſeruice, did me very much, to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards the bearing thoſe terrible ſickneſſes, which I endured, vvith ſo great patience as his Diuine Maieſtie vouchſafed to beſtow vpon me.</p>
            <p>I haue often conſidered the great goodnes of Almightie God, euen with amazement; and my ſoule had been regaled, to ſee the magnificence of his mercie towards me. Let him be bleſſed for all things. For I haue ſeen, in moſt euident manner, that he hath not left anie one good deſire of mine,
<pb n="33" facs="tcp:100776:53"/>
without recompenſe, euen in this life; and how imperfect, and full of fault ſoeuer, my vvorkes vvere, yet this Lord of mine, vvent bettering, and perfecting them, and giuing them vvorth; and my ſinnes, and miſeries, he vvould inſtantly hide; Yea his Diuine Maieſtie hath permitted, that euen the eyes of ſuch, as ſaw them, ſhould be blinded, and their memories faile, vvhen they vvould remem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber them. He euen guilds our faults, and makes that vertue ſhine bright, vvhich he, the ſame Lord, conueyes into me; and vvherein, he offers me euen a kind of violence, that I may receaue it.</p>
            <p>But I vvill now, returne to ſpeake of thoſe things, vvhich they haue commanded me to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clare: And I ſay, that, if I be to ſet forth, after a par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticular manner, in vvhat ſort our Lord proceeded vvith me, in theſe beginnings, I ſhall need ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther manner of vnderſtanding, then mine owne, to performe all that, vvith aduantage, for vvhich, I am obliged to him, in this particular; and to publiſh mine owne ingratitude, and vvickednes, ſince he hath forgotten it all.

            </argument>
            <p>I Forgot to relate, how, in the yeare of my No<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uitiate, I ſuffered much diſquiet, about ſome things, which, in themſelues, were of little impor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance; but I found my ſelf, to be blamed manie times, vvithout my hauing made anie fault; and this, I tooke vvith trouble, and imperfection enough; though yet, I endured it all, through the contentment, which I had, to be a Religious woe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man. When they obſerued me, to loue Solitude ſo vvell, and ſaw me ſhed teares ſometimes, (which yet indeed, vvas for my ſinnes) they thought, yea, and, they ſayd, that it grew, but from ſome inward melancholie, and diſguſt. For my part, I had a good inclination, to all the obſeruances of a Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligious life, ſaue only, that I knew not, how to endure anie thing, vvhich might carrie, ſo much, as an apparance of contempt, vvith it; for I de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lighted in being eſteemed. I vvas curious, about vvhatſoeuer, I tooke in hand; and I vvould needs thinke this, to be vertue in me, thongh yet, this
<pb n="35" facs="tcp:100776:54"/>
will neuer ſerue me, for a diſcharge, becauſe I knevv vvell enough, hovv to procure all thoſe things, vvhich might giue me guſt; and ſo, igno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rance vvill not free mee from blame.

            <p>There vvas a Religious vvoeman, at that time, and in that place, ſick, of a very grieuous infir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitie, vvhich put her to extreame paine; for ſhe had certaine Vlcers in her bodie, vvhich grew from great obſtructions; and thereby, did ſhe diſcharge, vvhatſoeuer ſhe tooke. She dyed quick<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, of that diſeaſe; and vvhereas I found, that all the reſt of our Communitie, had great apprehen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion, and feare, of the like; for my part, I had much enuie at her patience; and I begged of Almightie God, that, in caſe I might be fauoured by him, vvith that vertue, he vvould ſend me vvhat ſick<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſes he ſhould thinke fitt; and I thought, I feared no diſeaſe in the vvorld; for I vvas ſo bent, and ſet vpon the gaining of eternall Happines, that I re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolued to compaſſe it, hovv deare ſoeuer, it might coſt. Nor yet, am I vvithout vvonder, euen at this; for euen the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, I did not thinke, that I had vvrought my ſelf, into the loue of Almightie God, as, after<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vvards, I conceaued my ſelf, to haue it, vpon my beginning, to frequent the vſe of Prayer. But only I vvas growne, to haue a certaine light,
<pb n="36" facs="tcp:100776:55"/>
vvhich ſhevved me, hovv all things, vvhich come to an end, deſerue little eſteeme; and hovv thoſe Bleſſings, vvhich, being eternall, may be obtained, are of mightie value. His Diuine Maieſtie, did alſo heare me, in this; for, before tvvo yeares vvere expired, I grevv to be, in ſuch condition, that, howſoeuer my diſeaſe vvere not of that other ſort, yet, I belieue, that one, vvhich I had, for three yeares togeather, vvas, not a whitt of leſſe trouble, and torment to me, then that other vvas to her; as I ſhall now relate.</p>
            <p>The time being come, vvhich I vvas expecting, in that place, where I declared my ſelf to remaine, with my Siſter, for my better Cure, they carried mee, vvith care enough, from the regalos of my Father, of my Siſter, and of that Religious woema<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, my friend, vvho, formerly, vvas come away, vvith me; and, indeed, ſhe loued me very much. And now heer, did the Diuel beginne, to diſcompoſe my ſoule; though yet, Almightie God, drew much good from thence.</p>
            <p>There vvas a certaine Churchman reſiding in that place (to vvhich, I vvent, for cure) of very good qualitie, and vnderſtanding; and he vvas alſo, not vnlearned. Now I beganne to Confeſſe my ſelf vvith him; for I vvas euer, a friend of lear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning; but yet, it did my ſoule much hurt, to meet vvith Ghoſtlie Fathers, vvho vvere but indifferent in that kind; becauſe they vvanted, what Ineeded. And therefore, as for me, I haue found by expe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rience, that, vvhen Ghoſtlie Fathers, are vertuous
<pb n="37" facs="tcp:100776:55"/>
men, and of holie co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>uerſation, it is better, that they haue no learning at all, then but a little. Becauſe, neither ſuch as haue none, are vvont to truſt them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelues, vvithout asking the opinion of more learned men, then they are; neither ſhould I alſo, truſt them; and, for my part, I vvas neuer de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceaued, by anie ſolid learned man; yea, and euen thoſe others alſo, vvould certainly, I thinke, not haue deceaued me, but only, perhaps, they erred, becauſe they knew no better. Now, I thought, it vvas ſufficient, and that I vvas bound to nothing, but to belieue them, when that, vvhich they taught me, vvas according to the more large opinion, and of more libertie; for, if they had been more re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrained, I am ſo vvicked, that I ſhould haue gone to others. But that, vvhich vvas a Veniall ſinne, they told me, vvas no ſinne at all; and that, vvhich vvas a moſt grieuous Mortall ſinne, they ſaid vvas but Veniall. This did me ſo much hurt, that it muſt not goe for a ſtrange thing, to heare me ſpeake of it heer, for the better aduertiſment of others, vvhome I vvould very faine ſaue, from ſo great a miſchief. For I ſee vvell, that in the preſence of God, this vvas no diſcharge of me, from fault; for it ought to haue been enough for me, that the things, vvere of themſelues, not good, to make me preſerue my ſelf, vvholy, from them. I belieue, Almighty God permitted, for my ſinnes, that both they ſhould be deceaued, and deceaue me; as I, alſo, deceaued manie others, by telling them, that verie thing, vvhich I had been told. I con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinued,
<pb n="38" facs="tcp:100776:56"/>
I thinke, in this blindnes, more then ſeauenteen yeares, till a Father of S. Dominicks Order, a great learned man, vnbeguiled me, in ſome things; and they, of the Societie of IESVS, did ſo vvholy terrifye me, by agrauating thoſe ill begiunings, of mine; as I vvil ſhortly declare.</p>
            <p>But now, I confeſſing my ſelf, to that other Eccleſiaſticall perſon, of vvhome I vvas ſpeaking before, he grew to affect me, in extreame manner; becauſe then, indeed, I had little to Confeſſe, in compariſon of vvhat occurred afterwards; nay, I had not very much, from the time of my entring into Religion. The affection of this man, vvas not ill; but yet, by the exceſſe theror, it grew to be, not good. He vvell vnderſtood already, that I vvould not reſolue, vpon anie tearmes, to doe anie thing, vvhich vvas grieuouſly offenſiue to Almightie God; and he alſo aſſured me of as much, concer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning himſelfe; and ſo, our conuerſation grew to be frequent. But, in thoſe times of conference, which vve had, I vvas ſo fully poſſeſſed, and euen ſwal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowed-vp, by the thoughts of Almightie God, that the greateſt guſt I had, was to be ſpeaking of him; and I, being then, ſo very young, it put him to a kinde of confuſion, to ſee it; and through the great affection, which he bore me, he beganne to diſcouer his owne miſerie to me, which was not ſmall; for they were then, almoſt ſeauen yeares, that he had been in a very dangerous ſtate, by his affection, and conuerſation, with a certaine woeman of the ſame towne; when yet, he ſayd
<pb n="39" facs="tcp:100776:56"/>
Maſſe, all the while. Now, this was ſo publick a thing, that he had, already, loſt his honour, and fame; and yet no bodie, aduentured to ſpeake againſt it: Neither did I, thinke fitt to doe it, though I were much troubled, to ſee, in what caſe he was; becauſe I loued him much. For I had this part of follie, and blindnes, that euen heer, I thought it fitt, to be gratefull, and to keep faire quarter, with one, whome I loued. But curſed be that quarter, and way of proceeding, which ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tends it ſelf, ſo farre, as to be againſt the law of God. This is a very madd kind of errour, which is vſed now, ſo much, in the world; and it puts me; almoſt, out of my witts, to ſee, that wee ſhould owe, all that goodnes, which men doe vs, to the goodnes of God; &amp; yet, that wee ſhoud eſteeme it, for a vertue, not to breake this friendſhip with men, though it ſhould offer to carrie vs away, againſt him. O ſtrange blindnes of the world! O, that thou wouldſt be pleaſed, to let me be, the moſt vngratefull creature, that liues, towards the ſayd whole world, ſo that yet, I were not vngra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tefull, to the leaſt haires breadth, againſt thee. But, alas, I haue proceeded very contrarily, to this courſe, whereof I ſpeake, in puniſhment, of my other ſinnes.</p>
            <p>I procured, in the meane time, to informe my<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf, concerning this man, by meanes of the do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>meſticks of his houſe; and ſo I came, to vnderſtand more, of his miſerie; but yet, I found withall, that the poore ſoule was not altogether ſo extreamly
<pb n="40" facs="tcp:100776:57"/>
faultie, as men thought; becauſe, that wretched woman, had bewitched him, by a certaine little Idoll of copper, which ſhe had prayed him to weare about his neck, for loue of her; and no bodie had been of power enough, to make him leaue it. For my part, I confeſſe, I cannot belieue the buſines of ſuch witchcrafts, as this, in anie ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſe, and determinate manner; but yet, I vvil relate, vvhat I ſaw, for the better aduiſing men, to take heed of all vvoemen, vvho proceed in ſuch ſort, as this; And, to the end, that men may belieue, that, vvhen vvoemen come to looſe the ſhame of God, and the vvorld (for they are, euen more obliged, to be honeſt, and chaſt, then men) there is no truſt at all, to be repoſed in them; for, ſo that they may haue their vvills, and that the loue, vvhich the Diuel plants in them, may not be croſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed, they neuer care, vvhat they doe. But as for me, though I had been very vvicked, yet I neuer fell into anie thing of this nature; nor euer pretended to doe ill; no, nor, if I ſhould haue been able, would I euer yet haue forced anie bodie, to affect me. Our Lord kept me alwaies from this; whereas, if euer he had left me to my ſelf, I ſhould certainly, haue donne as ill, in this kind, as in other; for, in me, there was no truſt to be had. But now, when I came to vnderſtand this ſtorie, I beganne to ſhew him more affection. My intention, indeed, was good heerin, but yet my action, faultie; for, I ſhould not haue committed the leaſt ill, for the obtaining of the greateſt good, that could be
<pb n="41" facs="tcp:100776:57"/>
thought. I diſcourſed to him, very ordinarily, of Almightie God, vvhich, perhaps, might doe him ſome good; though yet, I am more apt to thinke, that the great affection, vvhich he bore me, vvas the thing, which wrought more vehemently vpon him; for, to doe me a very great pleaſure, he gaue me his little Idol, vvhich I inſtantly cauſed, to be caſt into the riuer. After this, he beganne quickly (like ſome man, vvho had been awaked, out of a profound ſleep) to goe recouering, and remem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bring all that, vvhich he had donne, in thoſe paſt yeares, and to be amazed at himſelf; and ſo, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wailing his miſerie, he came, by thoſe degrees, to abhorre it. Our B. Ladie, vvithout all queſtion, aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiſted him much; for he vvas very particularly de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uoted to her Immaculate Conception; and his cuſtome euer vvas, to celebrate that Feſtiuitie, vvith great ioy. In fine, he vtterly gaue ouer, ſo much as once, to ſee that vvoman anie more; and could neuer ſatisfye himſelf, vvith thanking Al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mightie God very much, for the light, vvhich he vouchſafed to giue him. And ſo, iuſt vpon that day twelue-moneth, vvhen I had knowne him firſt, he dyed. But, already, he vvas growne, to ſerue Al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mighty God, in very ſerious manner; and, though I neuer could perceaue, that the great affection, vvhich he bore me, vvas ill, yet it might haue been more pure; and ſo alſo, there vvas no vvant of oc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>caſions, vvherein, if the preſence, and aſſiſtance of God, had not been cloſe at hand, his Diuine Maieſtie might haue been much offended. But,
<pb n="42" facs="tcp:100776:58"/>
whatſoeuer I might then, haue conceaued to be Mortall ſinne, I vvould, certainly, not haue com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitted it; and euen his ſeeing that diſpoſition in me, might, perhaps, make him loue me the better. For, all men, I belieue, are more the friends of thoſe vvoemen, vvhome they ſee inclined to Ver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tue; yea, and euen, for thoſe other things, to which they pretended, ſuch vvomen gaine more, vpon ſuch men; as I ſhall declare afterward. But I hold it for very certaine, that his ſoule is in the vvay of ſaluation; for he dyed very vvell; and being grovvne ſo free from that occaſion, it ſeemes, our Lord vvas pleaſed, that he ſhould be ſaued, by this meanes.</p>
            <p>I remained in that place, three moneths, vvith extreame affliction; for, the Cure vvas, by much, too hard, for my complexion; and ſo, at the end of two moneths of thoſe three, the roughnes of thoſe remedies, did euen, as it were, make an end of my verie life; and withall, the rigour of my harts<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſickneſſe, of which I went to be cured, was growne to be much more fierce; in ſuch ſort, that, now and then, it ſeemed to me, as if my verie hart, had been peirced, and penetrated, with ſharp teeth; ſo that they were afrayd, I would runne mad. By this great loſſe, and want of ſtrength, (for I was able, to take no food at all, except it were liquid, and that, ſuddainly) I had a continuall burning Feauer, and I was totally conſumed; for they had daily giuen me a Purge, for almoſt a whole moneth togeather; and indeed, I was euen
<pb n="43" facs="tcp:100776:58"/>
ſo burnt vp, that my ſinnewes beganne, all, to ſhrinke; and this, with ſo inſupportable torments, that I could not take anie reſt, either by day, or night; and all this while, I was alſo oppreſſed, with a moſt profound ſadnes of minde.</p>
            <p>With ſuch a kinde of gaine, in point of health, as this, my Father brought me back to his houſe, where the Phiſitians came to viſit me againe; and they all, gaue me vtterly ouer; for they ſayd, that, beſides all the reſt, I was ſetled in a Hectick Feauer. But this troubled me, very little; for that, which afflicted me, was the ſharp, and bitter paine, which neuer gaue me ouer, bur vexed me, euen all alike, from head to foot. For, the torment of the ſinnewes, is a kinde of intollerable thing, as the Doctours affirme; and eſpecially, when they all ſhrinke vp, as mine did; and certainly, if I had not loſt the merit of it, through mine owne fault, the torment was ſtrong enough, to haue intitled me to it.</p>
            <p>I continued not, aboue three moneths, in this rage of paine; but it ſeemed, euen a kinde of im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſſible thing for mee, to endure ſuch a heape of afflictions, all, together. And now, I am euen amazed at my ſelf, and I hold it for a great fauour of our Lord, to conſider the patience, which his Diuine Maieſtie was pleaſed to giue me; for it was euident, that it came from him. It aſſiſted me alſo much, towards the hauing this patience, that I had read the hiſtorie of Iob, in the Moralls of S. Gregorie; and our Lord ſeemes to haue pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uented
<pb n="44" facs="tcp:100776:59"/>
me ſo, by that meanes; as alſo with hauing begunne, ſo to vſe Prayer, as that I might be able to carrie my paine, with much conformitie, to his holie will. The conuerſation of my hart, was wholy with him; and I carried theſe words of Iob, very vſually, both in my thought, and in my mouth: <hi>Since vve haue receaued bleſsings, and benefits, at the hand of our Lord; vvhy should vve not alſo, ſuffer afflictions?</hi> And I conceaued, that this, holpe to giue me courage.</p>
            <p>At length, came the Feaſt of our B. Ladie, in Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guſt; for, till then, from the April before, had my torment continued; though yet it had been greater, in the three laſt moneths. I then made haſt, to goe to Confeſſion; for, I euer tooke much contentment, to Confeſſe often. My friends thought, that it was feare of death, which inuited me, to be ſo deuout; and ſo, to the end, that I might not be put into apprehenſion, my Father would not let mee Confeſſe. O inordinate, and irregular loue, of fleſh, and bloud; ſince, though I had ſo Catholick a Father, and ſo full of prudence, and conſideration, in all his actions, which euen abounded in him, (for, this could not be an effect of ignorance) yet he might haue donne me hurt enough, by this meanes. That night, I fell into ſuch a Trance, as continued to keepe me, neer foure dayes, without the vſe, almoſt, of anie of my ſenſes; and ſhortly, they came to giue me the Sacrament of Extreame Vnction; and euerie hower, or rather euerie moment, it was expected, when I ſhould
<pb n="45" facs="tcp:100776:59"/>
expire, they being as diligent in ſaying the Creede <note n="a" place="margin">Many vſe to repeat the Creed, in the preſence, and as in the perſon, of ſuch, as are neer expi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring; by vvay of fortefying the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, at that time, againſt the tempta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions of the Diuell.</note> in my hearing, as if I had vnderſtood them; yea ſometimes they held me for ſo cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainly to be dead, that afterwards, I found the drops, of the holie <note n="b" place="margin">VVhen perſons are neer expi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring, atten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dants vſe to be very neer them, vvith hal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lovved Candles.</note> Wax-candles, about mine eyes. The affliction of my Father, was great, for his not hauing permitted me to goe to Confeſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion. Manie outcryes, and manie prayers, were made to Almightie God, for me; and bleſſed be he, who was pleaſed to heare them; for, the Graue remaining open, in the Church of my Monaſte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rie, a day and a half, where my bodie was ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pected, to be interred; and my Funerall, hauing been already celebrated, by the Religious men of our Order, in another towne, where it was con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceaued, that I was dead, our Lord was yet pleaſed at length, that I ſhould teturne to my ſelf; and ſo inſtantly. I would needs goe to confeſſion. I re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceaued alſo the B. Sacrament, with manie teares; though yet, in my opinion, they were not shed, with that ſenſe, and grief, for only my hauing of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fended Almightie God; which might haue ſerued, to ſaue my ſoule, if the errour, into which I was brought, by them, who had told me, that they were not matters of mortall ſinne, (which after<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward I ſaw plainly, that they were) might not ſerue my turne. For, the torments, wherewith I remained, were intollerable; and my vnderſtan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding not very sharpe, but rather dull; though yet (as I conceaued) my Confeſſion were entire, of all things, whereby I might thinke, that I had of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fended
<pb n="46" facs="tcp:100776:60"/>
God. For, this mercie, did his Diuine Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ieſtie vouchſafe to allow me, amongſt others, that, after I had once begunne to receaue the B. Sacra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, I neuer omitted to Confeſſe anie thing, which I conceaued to be a ſinne, though it were but Veniall; Though yet ſtill, me thinkes, that, without doubt, my ſoule might haue runne hazard, not to be ſaued, if I had dyed then; in re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gard, that, on the one ſide, my Ghoſtlie Fathers had been ſo meanly learned; and, on the other ſide, and indeed, on manie ſides, in regard, that, in my ſelf, I was ſo wicked.</p>
            <p>But this is alwaies a moſt certaine truth, that, when I returne to a thought of this paſſage, and conſider, how it ſeemes, as if our Lord had raiſed me againe, from death to life, I am filled with ſo huge an amazement, that I remaine, euen as it were, all quaking, within my ſelf. And now, me thinkes, it were well, O my ſoule, that thou wouldſt gather this iuſt reſolution, from that great danger, out of which, it pleaſed our Lord, to deliuer thee; that, although thou wouldſt not fly from offending his Diuine Maieſtie, for Loue, yet, at leaſt, thou shouldſt forbeare to doe it, for Feare. For he might haue taken thy life from thee, a thouſand times, when thou wert in a more dan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gerous ſtate; and I thinke, that I should not ſay too much, if I did ſpeake of a thouſand times more; though he, perhaps, may chide me, who commanded me to vſe moderation, in the recitall of my ſinnes; and yet I doubt, that I haue painted
<pb n="47" facs="tcp:100776:60"/>
them out, too fauourably, and faire. But I begg of him, for the loue of our Lord, that he will not once thinke, of making me diminish my faults; becauſe the magnificence of Almightie God, is to be diſcerned thereby, and how much he is pleaſed to ſuffer, and endure, from a ſoule. Let him be Bleſſed for euer; and let it alſo pleaſe his Diuine Maieſtie, that he may rather conſume me quite, then that I should euer leaue to loue him more.</p>

            </argument>
            <p>I Remained, during thoſe foure dayes of Ago<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nie, or Trance, in ſuch ſtate, that only our B. Lord is able to know, the vnſufferable tor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments, which I felt in my ſelf. My toung was deeply bitten by me, in manie places. My throat, with hauing taken nothing, and by reaſon alſo of my very great weaknes, could not ſwallow, ſo much as a drop of water, without choaking. Me thought, I was totally diſioynted; and my head, in extreame diſorder. I was alſo, as it were, all
<pb n="48" facs="tcp:100776:61"/>
rowled vp, and contracted, as if I had been a Bot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tome of Packthridd; for, in this, did the torments of thoſe dayes fixe themſelues, without my being able, once to ſtirr, either hand, or foot; arme, or head; (vnleſſe they moued me) anie more, then as if I had been dead. Only, I thinke, I was able to wagg one ſingle fingar of my right hand. Now, for anie bodie to touch me, in anie kinde, there was no meanes at all; for, my whole perſon, was ſo affected, and afflicted, as that there was no en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>during, to haue it touched. In a sheet, they would be remouing me, now, and then, according to the occaſion, with one, at one end therof, &amp; another, at the other; and this laſted, till Eaſter. Only this I had, by way of eaſe, that, if I were not appro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ached, and touched, theſe torments would be ceaſing, manie times; and then, vpon the account of my being in leſſe paine, I was content, to af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firme my ſelf to be well. But indeed I was much afrayd, leaſt my patience should beginne to faile me; and therfore, I was not a little pleaſed, to find my ſelf, without thoſe sharpe, and continuall torments; though yet I had them, after an vnſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portable manner; togeather with a very great de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teſtation of food, whilſt I had thoſe fierce colds, (which, indeed, were extreamly fierce) of a double Quartane, which I was alſo, then, growne to haue. About this time, I made ſo very great haſt, to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turne to the Monaſterie, that I got my ſelf to be carried away, as I was. And they receaued her, whome they expected for dead, with a ſoule,
<pb n="49" facs="tcp:100776:61"/>
which was yet in the bodie; but the bodie it ſelf, worſe then dead, through the paine they ſaw, it endured. The great, extremitie of my weaknes, cannot be related; for I had nothing left, but my skin, and bones; and I muſt ſay, that I continued thus, aboue eight moneths; for I was directly a Cripple, (though yet I were then, on the mending hand) vpon the verie point of three yeares. When now, I began to goe vpon all foure, I thanked God, as for a good degree of amendment. But I paſſed through all theſe afflictions, with great co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
               <g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formitie, to the holie will of Almighty God; yea, and (vnleſſe it were in the verie beginnings) with much alacritie, and ioy. For I eſteemed it all, as nothing, being compared with thoſe paines, and torments, wherein I had been before; and I was wholy reſigned then, to God's holie will, although he ſhould haue left me in that ſtate, for euer. I am of opinion, that all the anxietie of my deſire, to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>couer, was only, that I might apply my ſelf to Prayer, all alone, as I had been inſtructed; but for this, there was no meanes, in the Infirmarie. I Confeſſed my ſinnes very often; I ſpake with them, much, of God; in ſuch ſort, as that it edify<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed them all; and indeed, they were amazed to ſee the patience, which our Lord imparted to me. For, if it had not come, from the hand of his Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uine Maieſtie, it ſeemed a kinde of impoſſible thing, to endure ſuch a deale of torment, with ſo much contentment.</p>
            <p>A point of great moment, that fauour was,
<pb n="50" facs="tcp:100776:62"/>
which our B. Lord had vouchſafed to doe me, by giuing me Prayer; for, this, made me come to know, what it was to loue him; and from that little time, which I ſpent therein, I found theſe ver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tues to be growne vp, freſh in me; though yet, they were not ſtrong, nor able to hold me vpright, in ſtrict account. I ſpake not ill of anie Creature, how little ſoeuer it might be; but my ordinarie cuſtome, was, to auoide all manner of detraction; for I, alwaies, had this thought preſent with me, that I was neuer to wiſh, nor to ſay, anie ſuch thing, of anie Creature, as I would not haue them ſay of me; and I tooke this, ſo extreamly to hart, in all ſuch occaſions, as might occurr (though yet, not ſtill, ſo very perfectly, when ſometimes, anie great occaſion was offered me, to breake my Rule) that this was my conſtant vſe; and I perſwaded ſuch, as were wont to be much in my companie, and conuerſation, ſo earneſtly to this practiſe, that it grew, alſo, vp, with them, into cuſtome. By this meanes, it came to be commonly vnderſtood, that whereſoeuer I chanced to be, all abſent perſons were ſafe; and ſo were they alſo much more con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceaued to be, when anie of my neer friends, or kindred, or others, whome I had inſtructed, were concerned. Though, in other things, I haue a great account to make to Almightie God, for the ill example, which I gaue them. I beſeech his Diuine Maieſtie, to forgiue thoſe manie ill things, whereof I haue been cauſe; howſoeuer, I was not ſo, with ſo wicked intentions, as
<pb n="51" facs="tcp:100776:62"/>
the actions ſuceeded ill, afterward.</p>
            <p>I ſtill remained with great liking, to enioy Soli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tude; and I alſo loued, in particular manner, to diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>courſe, and treat of things, concerning Almighty God; and if ſtill, I could find, with whome; that, gaue me more contentment, and euen recreation, then all the politenes, or rather, I thinke, I may ſay, groſsnes, of the conuerſation of the world could doe; and I loued to Confeſſe, and Communicate oftner, then I had donne; and to deſire it much; and to be extreamly affected, with reading good Bookes; and to haue ſo extraordinarie a ſorrow, for hauing offended Almightie God, that manie times, I remember, how I durſt not aduenture, to put my ſelf into Prayer; becauſe I feared that ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſiue paine, which I was ſure I ſhould feele, in the qualitie of a great puniſhme<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t, for my offences. And this, grew afterward, to ſuch an extremitie, that I know not, to what, in fine, I may well com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pare this torment. But now, this neuer happened to me, either more or leſs, for anie feare at all, but only when I remembred thoſe regalo's, which our Lord had been pleaſed, to vouchſafe me, in my Prayer; and the verie much, that I owed his Diuine Maieſtie, for thoſe high Fauours; and when I ſaw, how ill I payd him, for all his goodnes, I was no longer able to endure it. Yea, and I found my ſelf alſo, extreamly offended with my ſelf, euen for the manie teares, which I ſhed, for the fault, when I ſaw the ſo little amendment, which I made; whilſt, neither my reſolutions, nor the
<pb n="52" facs="tcp:100776:63"/>
paine, and care, wherein I was, not to fall back againe, when once the occaſion ſhould be of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fered, were ſufficient to ſtay me. For then, euen my verie teates, would ſeem deceiptfull to my verie ſelf; and my fault would alſo appeare, ſo much the fowler, becauſe I ſaw the great fauour, which our Lord was pleaſed to doe me, by imparting thoſe teares to mine eyes, and ſo great repentance to my hart. I procured alſo to Confeſſe my ſelf often; and ſo, in my opinion, I did what I could, on my part, to reſtore my ſelf, to the ſtate of grace.</p>
            <p>But, all my miſerie, indeed, conſiſted, in that I pluckt not the occaſions of Sinne, vp, by the root; and partly alſo, in thoſe Ghoſtlie Fathers, who aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiſted me little; for if they had once directly de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clared to me, the danger, wherein I was, from time to time; and that I was in obligation, not to haue paſſed my howers, in ſuch conuerſations, I am very confidently perſwaded, that, all, would haue been quickly redreſſed; for I ſhould neuer haue endured, to paſſe one day, in Mortall ſinne, if I had vnderſtood the caſe.</p>
            <p>All theſe ſignes, and hopes, of my endeauour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, to feare, and ſerue Almightie God, were come to me, by meanes of Prayer; and the greateſt of them all, was, that I walked, as it were, all wrapt vp, in loue; for, as for the puniſhment of ſinne, it neuer once appeared before me. All the while, that I was ſo ſick, I continued to keep a very cloſe guard, vpon my Conſcience; for as much
<pb n="53" facs="tcp:100776:63"/>
as might concerne Mortall Sinne. But, O my deare Lord, how vehemently did I deſire, to be reſtored to my health, that I might procure to ſerue thee, ſo much the better; whereas yet, in verie deed, it was the occaſion of all my miſerie. But now, when I found my ſelf ſo lame, and euen ſuch a Cripple, and that, whilſt I was yet ſo very young, and how the Phiſitians of this world, had dreſſed me, and to what ſtate, they had brought me, I reſolued, that I would apply my ſelf, to thoſe of the other, to the end, that they might cure me; for I ſtill deſired to recouer my health, though yet I endured my ſicknes, with great alacritie. And I would be thinking, and conſidering ſometimes, that if, by enioying my health, I might chance be damned, it would be better for me, to remaine ſtill, as ſick as I was; but howſoeuer, I conceiued, that I ſhould be able, to ſerue Almightie God, much better, if I could enioy my health. Now, this is the abuſe, and errour, which deceaues vs, not to reſigne our<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelues entirely, to the diſpoſition, and good pleaſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>re, of our Lord; who knowes beſt, what is fitt for vs. But, in the meane time, I got manie Maſſes ſayd, for this purpoſe; and I reſorted alſo, to the vſe of other ſolid, and approued Prayers; for I was neuer a friend of certaine odd deuotio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>s, which are vſed by diuers perſons, and eſpecially by woemen; with ſome odd Ceremonies, which I could neuer endure, ſince I vnderſtood, that they ſauoured of Superſtition; howſoeuer other folkes were moued by them. And ſo. I tooke, for my Aduocate, and
<pb n="54" facs="tcp:100776:64"/>
Lord, the Glorious S. Ioſeph; and I recommended my ſelf much, to him; and I haue ſeen clearly, that this Father, and Lord of mine, hath drawne me, as well out of this neceſſitie, as out of other greater; when there was queſtion of Honour, and Loſſe of the Soule; and that, with more benefit, and ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uantage, then euen my ſelf could tell, how to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſire. Nay, I cannot remember, that hitherto I euer deſired anie thing, by his meanes, which he hath failed to obtaine for me; and it is able, euen to amaze me, when I conſider the great Fauours, which Almightie God hath donne me, by meanes of this Bleſſed Saint; and the dangers, both of Bodie, and Soule, out of which, he hath deliuered me. In ſuch ſort, as that it ſeemes, our Lord hath giuen the grace, and power, to other Saints, to ſuccour men, in ſome one kinde of neceſſitie of theirs; but I finde, by good experience, that this glorious Saint, ſuccours vs, in them all; and that our Lord will make vs vnderſtand, that as he would be ſubiect to S. Ioſeph, vpon earth, and that (by enioying the name, of his Father, and by being, as it were, his Directour, and Tutour,) he might command him: ſo alſo he would now, in Heauen, grant, whatſoeuer this Saint ſhould deſire. This truth, hath alſo been ſeen, by the experience of others, whome I haue deſired, to recommend themſelues to this Saint; and now, manie are growne to be deuoted to him; and my ſelf alſo, haue freſh experience of this truth.</p>
            <p>For my part, I procured to celebrate his Feſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uitie,
<pb n="55" facs="tcp:100776:64"/>
with all the ſolemnitie, I was able to vſe; but yet, with more vanitie, then true ſpirit; deſiring, that it might be performed, with much curioſitie, and exactnes; though yet ſtill, with good inten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion. But I euer had this, of ill; That if our Lord en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>abled me, at anie time, to doe anie thing, which was good, it would be full of imperfections, and faults; whereas, towards the doing anie thing amiſs, and for the exerciſing of curioſitie, and va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nitie, I vſed much diligence, and dexteritie, and cunning; our Lord pardon me for it. And now, I would faine perſwade all the world, to be de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uoted to this glorious Saint, for the great expe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rience, which I haue had, of the bleſſings, that he obtaines for vs, of Almightie God; nay, I haue neuer knowne anie one, who is ſeriouſly deuoted to him, and performes him particular ſeruices, whome I finde not alſo, to goe proceeding on, in vertue; for really, he aſſiſts thoſe ſoules much, which recommend themſelues to him. And to my beſt remembrance, there are diuers yeares, wherein I haue deſired ſomewhat of him, vpon his Feſtiuall Day, and I haue euer found it granted; and if, peraduenture, my petition had ſome little of the indirect, belonging to it, he redreſſed it, and ſet it ſtreight, for my greater good.</p>
            <p>If I were anie ſuch perſon, as had authoritie to write, I would gladly enlarge my ſelf heer, to make particular relation, of the Fauours, which this glorious Saint hath obtained, both for me, and others; but, to the end, that I may doe no
<pb n="56" facs="tcp:100776:65"/>
more, then I am commanded, I muſt be ſhorter, in manie things, then I would; and more large in others, then is needfull; like one, in fine, who hath little diſcretion, for the doing of anie thing, which is good. Only I begg, for the loue of Almightie God, that, whoſoeuer can belieue me, will try the truth, of what I ſay; for he ſhall find by expe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rience, how greatly a good thing it is, to recom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mend himſelf, to this glorious Patriarch, and to be deuoted to him. Eſpecially ſuch, as giue them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelues to Prayer, ſhould alwaies be affectionate to this Saint; for I know not, how, one can thinke of the Queen of the Angells, at thoſe times, when ſhe ſuffered ſo much, during the Infancie of our Lord Ieſus; and not giue thankes to S. Ioſeph, for the great aſſiſtance, which he gaue them, at that time. Whoſoeuer wants a Maiſter, who might inſtruct him to pray, let him take this glorious Saint, for his guide; and he shall neuer looſe his way.</p>
            <p>I beſeech our Lord, that I may haue committed no errour, in preſuming to ſpeake of this Saint; for though I thus profeſſe, and publish my ſelf, to be deuoted to him; yet haue I been euer faultie, in the not doing him reall ſeruices, and in not imi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tating his vertues. But now, he did like himſelf, by procuring, that I might be able, to riſe, and walke, and be no longer a Cripple; and ſo I did alſo like my ſelf, in making ſo ill vſe of this fauour.</p>
            <p>But now, who would euer haue imagined, that
<pb n="57" facs="tcp:100776:65"/>
I could ſo ſoone, fall back againe, after my re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiuing ſo manie regalo's, at the hands of Al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mightie God; and after his Diuine Maieſtie, had vouchſafed to giue me ſome Vertues, which (euen, as it were, of themſelues) did awake, and ſtirr me vp, to his ſeruice; and after I had ſeen my ſelf, euen, as it were, dead, and in ſo imminent dan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger, to be condemned to Hell; and after he had raiſed me againe, both in Bodie, and Soule, in ſuch ſort, that all they, who ſaw me, were euen amazed to finde, that I could, ſo long, be aliue. But, what is this, O my Lord, and my God? Is this life to be ſtill, ſo dangerous which we are to liue?</p>
            <p>Euen now, whilſt I am writing this, me thinkes, that, by this fauour, and mercie, I might be able to ſay with S. Paul, (though yet, not with ſuch per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fection, as he ſayd it) that now, <hi>It is not I, vvho liue; but thou,</hi> O my Creatour, <hi>vvho liueſt in me;</hi> according to the experience; which I haue had ſome yeares, by that little, which I am able to vnderſtand of my ſelf; and ſtill thou holdeſt, and keepeſt thy hand ouer me; and I find my ſelf, full of deſires, and good purpoſes; and, in ſome ſort, I haue proued alſo (euen by experience of manie things, in theſe late yeares) that I would, by no meanes, doe anie thing, which ſhould contradict, or croſs thy will, how little ſoeuer it might be; though yet, I well belieue, that I committ manie offences, againſt thy Diuine Maieſtie, euen without my vnderſtanding it. And it alſo ſeemes to me, that there could not, ſo hard a thing be ſet before me, which I would
<pb n="58" facs="tcp:100776:66"/>
not execute, for loue of thee, with great reſolu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion; and ſometimes, thou haſt ſo aſſiſted me therein, as that ſuch things haue taken effect; and, for my part, I care not, a whitt, for the whole world; no, nor for anie creature, which is in it; nor can I find, that anie thing at all, giues me guſt, which ſwarues from thee; and euerie thing, which is not thou, ſeemes no leſs, then a very heauie croſſe to my hart.</p>
            <p>Yet I may eaſily deceaue my ſelf heerin; and ſo, I thinke, I doe; for, I doubt, that I poſſeſſe not all this, whereof I ſpeake; but yet thou ſeeſt well, O my Lord (foraſmuch as I am able to vnderſtand) that I doe not lye. And I am fearing, and that with very much reaſon, that, perhaps, thou maiſt yet, leaue me once againe; for I am not now to be told, how ſhort a way, mine owne ſtrength, is able to carrie, and conduct me; and how little vertue I haue, in caſe thou be not euer, at hand, to allow me thy benedictions, and ſuccours; to the end, that ſo, I may neuer forſake thee; yea, and I beſeech thy Diuine Maieſtie, that euen now, I be not already forſaken by thee, whilſt yet I am thinking thus, of my ſelf.</p>
            <p>For my part, I know not, how wee can deſire to liue, ſince all things are ſo vncertaine heer. It ſeemed to me, O my Lord, to be already euen an impoſſible thing, that I ſhould, ſo entirely, forſake thee; but ſince I haue forſaken thee ſo often, I cannot but feare the like againe; becauſe, when thou haſt retired thy ſelf, neuer ſo little, from me,
<pb n="59" facs="tcp:100776:66"/>
all fell inſtantly downe to the ground. Bleſſed be thou for euer, O Lord; for, howſoeuer I forſooke thee, thou wouldſt not yet, ſo entirely, forſake me; but that ſtill, thou gaueſt me thy hand, that ſo I might be able, to riſe againe; though manie times, O Lord, I would not take hold by it; nor would I vnderſtand, how thou vouchſafedſt to call me againe, very often; as I will now declare.</p>

            </argument>
            <p>I Beganne, from one paſtime, to another; from one vanitie, to another; and from one occaſion, to another, to caſt my ſelf deeply, into very great occaſions; and to carrie my ſoule ſo diſordered, vpon manie abſurdities, that already, I grew euen aſhamed, to approach towards God, with ſo par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticular a kind of friendſhip, and familiaritie, as frequent Prayer requires; and I was forwarded in that ill way, by this, That as my ſinnes grew to be encreaſing, the guſt, which I had taken, and the regalo, which I had receaued, from the exerciſe of vertue, beganne to faile me. I perceaued very
<pb n="60" facs="tcp:100776:67"/>
clearly, O my Lord, that theſe good things are wanting to me now, becauſe I had firſt bee<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> want<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to thee. But yet, this was, in the meane time, the moſt terrible coſening kind of wrong, which the Diuel could poſſibly put vpon me, when he made me beginne, to feare, to make Prayer; be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe, forſooth, I ſaw my ſelf ſo deſtroyed; and, me thought, it was better for me, to proceed, as the multitude did, ſince I was amongſt the worſt of them, who are wicked; and to pray, but as much, as I was bound; and that, but vocally; and that a perſon, who deſerued to be with the Diuel, was not to vſe Mentall Prayer, and to hold ſo ſtreight commerce, with Almightie God; and that, if I did, I should but ſeeke, to deceaue the world; becauſe exteriourly, I made shew of vertue. Yet, in the meane time, vpon this reaſon, the Houſe, wherein I liued, did deſerue no blame, at all; becauſe I procured, with ſo much cunning, and craft, all that while, that they should haue me, in good opinion. Neither did I all this, of ſet pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe, by counterfeyting a better Soule, then I had; for, touching this point of Hypocriſie, and Vaine<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>glorie, I humbly thanke Almightie God, that I remember not my ſelf, to haue offended him therein, for ought I can perceaue; for, vpon the verie firſt approach of motion, to committ that kind of ſinne, I euer receaued, and felt, ſo much trouble, that the Diuel was wo<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t to goe away with loſſe, and I remained with gaine; and therefore, he would neuer tempt me much, in this kind;
<pb n="61" facs="tcp:100776:67"/>
though yet perhaps, if God had permitted him to endeauour it, as ſtrongly in this, as he did in ſome other things, I ſhould alſo haue falne into this ſinne. But his Diuine Maieſtie hath been pleaſed hitherto, to preſerue me heerin; for which, let him be eternally praiſed. Nay, rather it troubled me much, that they ſhould hold me, in good opinion, conſidering, what I knew, in priuate, of my ſelf. The true reaſon, of their belieuing me, not to be ſo wicked, proceeded from this, That they ſaw me, being ſo young, to retire my ſelf, manie times, and vpon ſeuerall occaſions, to Solitude; and to pray, and read much; and talke of God; That I loued to make the picture of our Bleſſed Sauiour, be ſet vp, in manie places; and to haue an Ora<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>torie; and to procure, to put ſuch things there, as might cauſe deuotion; and not to ſpeake ill, of anie; and other things alſo of this nature, which carried a kind of apparance of vertue, with them; and I knew well enough (ſo vaine I was) how to winne eſteem, for my ſelf, by thoſe things, which the world is wont to prize.</p>
            <p>Vpon theſe obſeruations of theirs, they allowed me as much, yea and more, libertie, then to the more antient Religious woemen of the Houſe; and they were confident of me, in all things; for, as for my taking liberties to my ſelf, or to doe anie thing at all, without leaue, yea, or to ſpeake with anie bodie, in corners, or holes, or by night, me thinkes, I could neuer haue reſolued my ſelf, euen ſo much, as to talke of anie ſuch thing, as this, in a
<pb n="62" facs="tcp:100776:68"/>
Monaſterie; neither did I euer ſo; becauſe our Lord held me vp, in his hand. For it ſeemed to me, (who reflected much, and with much attention, vpon manie things) that, to put the honour of ſo manie Religious woemen, in hazard, whilſt they were good, becauſe I was wicked, had been a very vnworthie part in me; as yet perhaps I ſhould haue done, by makeing ſtrangers thinke, that they vſed alſo, to doe the like. But why doe I ſpeake of my auoyding to doe ill things, as if any thing which I did, had been well donne? Though yet, the truth be withall, that the euill which I did, was not performed by me, with ſo much reflection, and aduertence, as this, would haue required; though yet it were, with too much. For this reaſon, I am of opinion, that it brought me hurt enough, that I was in a Monaſterie, not encloſed. Which they, who were good, might well enioy, without any diſaduantage to their goodnes; be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe they owed no more, ſince they did not pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſe Clauſure; but as for me, who am wicked, it would certainly haue carried me downe to Hell; vnleſſe our Lord had drawne me, out of this danger, by very manie remedies, and meanes, and moſt particular fauours. And ſo, me thinkes, a Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>naſterie of woemen, with libertie, expoſes them, to very great hazard; and rather appeares in mine eye, as a way, whereby they, who haue a minde to be wicked, may walke on, towards Hell, then as a remedie for their weaknes. I meane not this, by my Monaſterie; for therein, are ſo manie, who
<pb n="63" facs="tcp:100776:68"/>
ſerue our Lord, ſo much in earneſt, and with ſo great perfection, that his Diuine Maieſtie, through his goodnes, cannot faile, of doing them fauour. Neither is this Monaſterie alſo, of the moſt open, and dis-encloſed; and beſides, all good Religious Order, is obſerued in it; but I ſpeake, what I was ſpeaking, of others, which I know, and haue ſeen. I ſay therefore, that thoſe others, giue me cauſe, to haue great compaſſion of them; for they haue need of particular motions, and calls, from our Lord; and not once, but very often; that ſo, they may be ſaued; conſidering, how much the ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nours, and recreations of the world, are now growne to be authorized; and how little, ſuch, as they are, vnderſta<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>d the verie much, to which they are obliged. So that I beſeech God, they hold not that, ſometimes, for vertue, which is ſinne; as my ſelf did often; yea, and there is ſo great difficultie, in making this, be well vnderſtood, that there is need of no leſſe, then that our Bleſſed Lord him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf, ſhould ſeriouſly, put his hand to the worke.</p>
            <p>If Fathers would take my counſel (ſince they will not procure, to put their Daughters, where they may walke in the way of ſaluation, but rather be in more danger, then they ſhould, per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>haps, haue mett with, in the world) I would aduiſe them, at leaſt, to conſider their owne honour; and rather to marrie them very meanly, then to put them into ſuch Monaſteries, as thoſe, vnleſſe they be very vertuouſly inclined; yea, and I pray God, that euen this, may ſerue the turne. Yea, or els, let
<pb n="64" facs="tcp:100776:69"/>
them rather continue them, in their owne houſes; for if they will needs be wicked, it cannot be there, kept priuate, but for a very ſhort time; but heer, it may be long concealed, though yet, in the end, our Lord is euer wont, to diſcouer it; and then, they doe not only hurt themſelues, but alſo the reſt; and ſometimes, thoſe poore Creatures haue the leſſe fault, becauſe they doe but that, which they find in vſe. But ſtill, it is matter of much compaſſion, to ſee manie, who haue really a minde, to forſake all, and conceaue, that they goe to ſerue our Lord, and to flye from the dangers of this world, doe yet, by this meanes, grow, to em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>barke themſelues, in ten worlds, all, togeather; where they know not, what to doe, or how to helpe themſelues. For, youth, and ſenſualitie, and, in fine, the Diuel, both inuites them, and inclines them, to follow ſomethings, which doe alto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>geather belong to a world; and ſo, in effect, they come to hold them good. Me thinkes, in this, they are like thoſe miſerable, and wretched men, the Hereticks; who firſt make themſelues blind, and then giue themſelues to vnderſtand, that thoſe opinions, which they follow, are good, and ſo they come to belieue them, to be true; though yet, indeed, and vpon the matter, they belieue them not; for, in their harts, there is ſomewhat, which tells them ſtill, that it is naught.</p>
            <p>O great miſerie! I ſay, O extreame great miſerie of Religious perſons; (and I ſpeake not heer of women now, more then of men) where Religious
<pb n="65" facs="tcp:100776:69"/>
Obſeruance, is not kept; and where, in one, and the ſelf ſame Monaſterie, two wayes are held: One of Vertue, and Religious Life; and another, which is vtterly in want therof; and where they all, goe, as it were, equally, hand in hand. Or rather, I ſayd ill, when I ſayd, equally; for it vſes to happen ſo, for our Sinnes, that the more imperfect, make vp the greater number; and ſo, as they vſe to be more, they vſe to be alſo more fauoured. And true Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligious Obſeruance is wont to be ſo rare, in thoſe places, that as well that Religious man, as that Religious woeman, who ſhall haue a minde, to giue themſelues wholy, and in good earneſt, to follow their Vocation, and Rule, will haue cauſe, to be in more feare of the reſt of the Religious of their owne Houſe, then of all the Diuels in Hell. Yea, and they will need to vſe more caution, and diſſimulation, in ſpeaking of that entercourſe, and friendſhip, which ſuch perſons ſhould procure to hold, with Almightie God, then of other incli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nations, and friendſhips, which the Diuel findes meanes, ſometimes, to bring into Monaſteries. I can therefore meet with no reaſon, why we ſhould be amazed, to ſee ſo manie miſeries in the Church, ſince they, who ought to be Patterns for others, (that ſo, all men might grow to be ver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tuous, by their example) haue totally blotted out, that Worke, which the Spirit of the Saints, in old time, left regiſtred in our Religious Orders. And I humbly beſeech his Diuine Maieſtie, that he will be pleaſed, to giue ſuch remedie, to theſe

miſchiefs, as he knowes beſt, to be needfull; Amen.</p>
            <p>But, in the meane time, when I beganne to vſe ſuch conuerſations as theſe, I little thought, that ſo great diſtractions, and other dammages, would grow to my Soule, by that kind of proceeding, when I ſaw, they were ſo much vſed by others; and I conceaued, that ſo generall a thing, as it is, for Secular people, to make Viſits to the Religious, in manie Monaſteries, would be of no greater preiudice to me, then it was to others, whome I ſaw, to be vertuous, and good. But I conſidered not, the while, that thoſe others, were much more vertuous, then my ſelf; and that thoſe things, which were of much danger to me, were not, per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>haps, of ſo very much, to them; though yet, I feare, it be of ſome; and, at the beſt hand, I am ſure enough, that it is no better, then time very ill em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ployed, and ſpent. And, being once with a certaine perſon, our Lord was pleaſed to giue me to vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtand, in the verie beginning of my acquain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance with her, that ſuch friendſhips would be, no way, conuenient for me; and to giue me alſo ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uiſe, and light, in ſo great a darknes, as that was. For, Chriſt our Lord repreſented himſelf before me, with much rigour, and gaue me well to vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtand, how greatly he was diſguſted at my proceeding. I ſaw him only, with the eyes of my Soule; but yet, much more diſtinctly, and more clearly, then I could poſſibly haue donne, with the eyes of my Bodie; and he remained ſo deeply
<pb n="67" facs="tcp:100776:70"/>
imprinted there, that although it hapned to me, aboue ſix and twentie yeares agoe, me thinkes, he is ſtill as preſent to me now, as he was then; But I am ſure, I remained ſo altered, yea and ſo aſto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſhed, that I intended to ſee that perſon no more.</p>
            <p>It did me a great deale of hurt, that I knew not, at that time, that it was poſſible for one to ſee anie thing, but with the eyes of the Bodie; and the Diuel was carefull enough, to continue me, in that erroneous opinion, and to make me ſtill belieue, that it was impoſſible; and therefore, that I had but fancied certaine things, to my ſelf; and that, perhaps, it might be a worke of the Diuel. And he brought manie ſuggeſtions, like this, vpon me; though yet ſtill, I were very confidently of opini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, that it was God, and no conceipt, or fancie, at all; but yet ſtill, becauſe it induced me to doe things, which were againſt my guſt, I did the beſt I could, euen to belye my verie ſelf. And foraſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>much, as I durſt not conferr with anie bodie, about this particular, and found my ſelf alſo ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>treamly importuned afterward, and was wiſhed to be aſſured, that it could not be ill donne, to ſee ſuch a perſon as that, and that there would be no loſs of honour by it, but rather gaine, I returned to enioy the ſame conuerſation; yea, and alſo, at other times, I conuerſed, in like manner, with others; for they were manie yeares, wherein I tooke this peſtilentiall recreation; and when once, I was farre embarked therein, it ſeemed not to me, to be ſo very ill, as yet, indeed, it was; though ſtill, it be
<pb n="68" facs="tcp:100776:71"/>
very true, that ſometimes I diſcerned clearly enough, that it was not good. But yet, no other conuerſation diſtracted me ſo much, as this, in particular, did; by reaſon of the great affection, which I bore to the partie.</p>
            <p>But, my ſelfe being afterwards againe, with the ſame perſon, we, both of vs, ſaw coming to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards vs (and there were others alſo preſent, who ſaw it too) a certaine thing, which had the manner of a great Toade; and it preſſed, and paſſed on, with very much more ſpeed, then ſuch creatures vſe to haue. For my part, I was not able to conceaue, how ſuch a filthie Beaſt as that, ſhould get into that roome, through that part, from whence it came; and euen, as it were, at Noone day; nor had euer anie ſuch thing, been ſeen there. The effect, which it wrought with me, ſeemes, not to haue been void, of ſome myſterie; and this alſo, was a thing, which I could neuer forget. But, O greatnes of Almightie God! with how much care, &amp; pittie, wert thou admoniſhing me, in ſo manie kindes, and by ſo manie wayes; &amp; how little did I permitt, that all theſe warnings ſhould help?</p>
            <p>There was alſo there, at that time, a certaine Religious woeman of my kindred; and she was antient, and a great ſeruant of God, and of much diſcipline in her Religious Order. She alſo, would ſometimes, be giuing me good counſel; but I did not only not belieue her, but was alſo diſguſted with her; as conceauing, that ſhe would
<pb n="69" facs="tcp:100776:71"/>
needs take ſcandall at me, without cauſe.</p>
            <p>And this I heer relate, to the end, that both my wickednes, and the great goodnes of Almightie God, may be the better vnderſtood; and that it may be knowne, how well I deſerued Hell, for my great ingratitude; and I doe it alſo, to this end, that if our Lord may ſo ordaine, &amp; be pleaſed, that anie Religious vvoemen may fall vpon reading this Diſcourſe, they may be brought to be carefull, to take vvarning by me; and I begg of them, that, for the loue of our Lord, they vvil take heed of ſuch recreations, as theſe. And I beſeech his Diuine Maieſtie, that ſome one of them, may be diſ-abuſed, vvhome I haue deceaued, vvhen I told them, that it vvas not ill; and vvhen (being in ſuch blindnes, at that time) I procured, to aſſure them, that there vvas no danger at all; and in re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gard alſo, that, by the ill example, vvhich I gaue gaue them, (as I haue related heer) I was a cauſe to them, of great miſchief, vvhilſt yet I thought not, that I did ſo much hurt; and though alſo, it be cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taine, that I had no deſigne at all, to deceaue them.</p>
            <p>But now, euen vvhilſt I vvas yet much indiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſed, in the vvay of health, both concerning Bodie, and Minde; and ſo, before I vvas able to help my ſelf, in either kinde, I grew into an ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>treame deſire, to doe others good; vvhich is a very ordinarie temptation, for new beginners; though yet, it hapned now to ſucceed vvell, vvith me. And conſidering, how dearly I loued my Father, I vviſhed him the ſelf ſame benefit, vvich I con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceaued
<pb n="70" facs="tcp:100776:72"/>
my ſelf to haue gotten, and gained, by meanes of Mentall Prayer; and eſteeming, that, in this life, there vvas no greater bleſſing, then to ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taine, and enioy that guift, I beganne, by certaine vvayes of diſcourſe, to procure, the beſt I could, that he vvould endeauour to obtaine it; and I gaue him certaine Bookes, for this purpoſe. Now, he, being a man of ſo much vertue, as I haue al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ready declared, grew to ſettle himſelf, ſo very well, in this exerciſe, that he came, vvithin fiue or ſix yeares, (for ſo long, I thinke, it vvas) to be ſo vvell improued, and aduanced therein, that I bleſſed our Lord much, for the fauour; and it gaue me an extreame conſolation. The troubles, and croſſes, vvhich he endured, vvere very great, and of manie kindes; and he paſſed through them all, vvith much conformitie, to the vvill of our Lord. He came to ſee me often; and vvas greatly comforted, to treat of Spirituall things. And vvhen now I liued ſo diſtracted, and diffuſed, vvithout vſing Mentall Prayer, and ſaw vvithall, that he con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceaued me, to be ſtill the verie ſame, that I had been before, I vvas not able to endure, to liue, vvithout vn-deceauing him; for I had, then, been a yeare, and more, vvithout Mental Prayer, as thinking it more humilitie for me, to abſtaine; and this (as I ſhall declare afterwards) vvas the greateſt, and vvorſt temptation, that euer I had; for, by this meanes, Iranne headlong, vpon my totall ruine; vvhereas, vvhen I frequented Prayer, if I offended God, one day, I returned to recollect
<pb n="71" facs="tcp:100776:72"/>
my ſelf, vpon another; and ſo, to abſent my ſelf from the occaſion.</p>
            <p>But that bleſſed man, my Father, coming to ſee me, in ſuch ſtate as this, it vvas too much for me (as I vvas ſaying) to let him vvalke on, ſo farre in errour, as to thinke, that I ſtill conuerſed vvith God, in Prayer, as formerly I had donne; and ſo I told him then, that I did no longer vſe Mentall Prayer; though yet, I did not tell him, the cauſe thereof; but I alleadged my infirmities, for the reaſon; and that, although I vvere recouered of the mayne ſicknes, I had yet diſeaſes, yea and very great ones, ſtill; and that, although, of late, they had not aſſaulted me, vvith ſo very great fiercenes, as before, yet they failed not, ſtill to continue, and to exerciſe me alſo, in manie kindes. In particular, that I had certaine vomits, for twe<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>tie yeares togeather, euerie morning, in ſuch ſort, as that I could neuer breake my faſt, till Noone, vvas paſt; yea and ſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>metimes, not ſo ſoone. And ſince, of late, I am growne able to receaue the B. Sacrament more often, it proceeds from this, that theſe vomits come to me, at night, before I goe to bed, and they put me to much more paine; and then, I muſt procure to haſten, and facilitate them, by the vſe of feathers, and ſuch other things; becauſe, if I haue not thoſe vomits, the ſicknes, vvhich I feele, is ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>treame. But indeed, I am, me thinkes, almoſt neuer, without manie kindes of paine; and ſometimes, they are very ſharp ones; and eſpecially, at my verie hart; though yet withall, it be alſo true, that
<pb n="72" facs="tcp:100776:73"/>
the cruel Palſie, and other infirmityes of Feauers, which were wont to come very thick vpon me, are now found, to oppreſs me more ſeldome; ſo that manie times, I am well, in thoſe reſpects; and I haue made ſo little account of theſe miſeries, for theſe eight yeares togeather, that ſometimes I am euen glad, I haue them; as conceauing, that our Lord may be, peraduenture, ſerued, in ſome ſort, thereby. This was my diſcourſe. And now, my Father belieued, that this, which I told him heer, was, indeed, the true cauſe of my omiſſion, for, himſelf neuer vſed to lye; and conſidering, in what ſort, and, of what matter, I was then diſcourſing to him, he had no reaſon to thinke, but that I ſayd true; and, to the end, that he might belieue me the better, I told him alſo then, that I well ſaw my ſelf, not to be without ſome fault; and that I had enough to doe, to be able to aſſiſt in the Quire; though yet, in verie deed, euen this reaſon of cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>porall ſicknes, was no ſufficient cauſe, to make me giue anie good thing ouer; for, there is no need of corporall ſtrength, for ſuch things as theſe, but only of loue, and cuſtome; ſince our Lord, affords vs alwaies opportunitie, if we will, our<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelues. I ſay, alwaies; becauſe, though infirmities, and other occaſions, my hinder one ſometimes, from ſpending manie howers in Solitude, yet there will not want ſome other time, wherein we may haue health enough, for this buſines; yea and euen in other occaſions, as alſo in the midſt of ſicknes it ſelf, the trueſt Prayer may be made
<pb n="73" facs="tcp:100776:73"/>
(ſince it is the Soule, which loues) by offering vp that paine, to Almightie God; and in remembring, for whome it is endured; and in conforming ones ſelf, to God's holie will, therein; and in a thouſand ſuch other things, as will occurr. And thus may one exerciſe Loue; for, there is no neceſſitie at all, for a perſon, either to be in Solitude, or els, that there muſt be no Mentall Prayer, at all.</p>
            <p>If we will take a little care, we may arriue to obtaine great bleſſings, at thoſe times, when our Lord, euen takes time for Prayer from vs, by meanes of our ſickneſſes, and paine; and my ſelf had found this to be true, as long as my Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcience was pure, and good. But my Father, through the opinion, which he held of me, and the loue he bore me, belieued all, that I had ſayd; or rather, he not only belieued, but had alſo pittie of me; though yet, being then growne, to find himſelf, in ſo eminent, and high a ſtate of Spirituall Life, he remained not with me, very long. And therefore, hauing viſited me, he returned home, as holding his ſtay, there, to be loſſe of time; and I, who was willing to ſpend it vpon other vanities, was not troubled very much, at his departure.</p>
            <p>It was not only with him, but with other per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons alſo, whome I procured, that they ſhould ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dict themſelues to Mentall Prayer, euen whilſt I was walking on, in thoſe vanities; for ſtill, as I found them apt, to vſe Vocall Prayer, I told them how they ſhould grow to haue the vſe of Medi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation; and I did them good, and gaue them
<pb n="74" facs="tcp:100776:74"/>
Bookes; for I had ſtill a good deſire, that others ſhould ſerue Almightie God, euen from the verie firſt time, that I vſed Mentall Prayer; as I haue re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lated heer.</p>
            <p>It ſeemed to me, that, ſince now I ſerued not our Lord my ſelf, ſo well as I ſhould, yet I liked not, that that light ſhould be loſt, which his Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uine Maieſtie had beſtowed vpon me; but that others might alſo ſerue him, by my meanes. And this I heer recount, that ſo, the great blindnes wherein I was, may be the better ſeen; which induced me, to make me looſe my ſelf, whilſt yet I went procuring, to doe good to others.</p>
            <p>About this time, my Father fell into the ſicknes, whereof he dyed, ſhortly after. But I went to at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tend, and recouer him, whilſt my ſelf was more ſick in Soule, then he was in Bodie, through manie vanities of mine; though yet, not in ſuch ſort, as that, according to my vnderſtanding, I was in Mortall Sinne, euen in all this worſt, &amp; wickedeſt time, whereof I ſpeake; for certainly, if I had con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceaued otherwiſe, I ſhould, by no meanes, haue continued therin. I endured ſome affliction, and trouble, in his ſicknes; and, I thinke, I alſo made him ſome part of poore amends, for the paines, which he had taken with me, in mine; for now, being ill enough in my ſelf, I yet ſtrained very hard, to doe him ſeruice; and beſides, I well conſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dered, that by the onlie loſſe of him, all my com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fort, and regalo, was to be loſt; for it all, was ſhut vp, in onlie him. I animated my ſelf alſo, ſo much,
<pb n="75" facs="tcp:100776:74"/>
towards the not ſhewing him, that I was in anie paine, and in continuing ſo, euen till he expired, as if I had felt no trouble at all; though yet it be very true, that, when I ſaw him come, to be vpon the verie point, to looſe his life, it ſeemed to me, as if mine owne verie Soule, had then been torne out of my Bodie; for I loued him much.</p>
            <p>It was a thing to make our Lord be highly praiſed, to ſee the death, which my Father dyed; togeather with the deſire, which he alſo had to dye; and the counſel, which he gaue vs, after he had receaued extreame Vnction; and how he charged vs, to recommend him to God; and that we ſhould begg mercie of him, for his Soule; and that we muſt ſerue him euer; and conſider, that all this world, muſt come to end. With teares he alſo told vs, how ſad he was at the hart, for not hauing ſerued his Diuine Maieſtie better; That he wiſhed, he were ſome Religious man; I meane, that he had been ſo; and that, of the moſt ſtrict, who were in the world. And I hold it, for very certaine, that ſome fifteen dayes before, our Lord gaue him to vnderſtand, that he was not to liue; becauſe, before that verie time, he did not thinke he was ſick, though yet he were ſo, in good ear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſt. But afterwards, though he ſeemed to mend much, in point of health, and though the Doctours bad him belieue, that there was no danger at all, yet he made no account of that, but only atte<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ded, to put his Soule, in good order.</p>
            <p>That ſicknes of his, beganne with a very
<pb n="76" facs="tcp:100776:75"/>
grieuous paine, round about his ſhoulders, which neuer left him; and ſometimes it preſſed him ſo hard, that his affliction was very great. I told him once, vpon this occaſion, that ſince he had been ſo deuoted to that Myſterie, when our Lord carried his Croſſe vpon his Back, he might doe well, to conceaue, that his Diuine Maieſtie had been plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed to giue him a feeling, of ſome part of that, which himſelf had vndergone, with ſo much trouble; and my Father was ſo comforted by this thought, that I remember him not, to haue euer complained more. He remained three dayes, with very little ſhew of vnderſtanding; but yet, the day, whereon he dyed, our Lord reſtored it to him; &amp; that, ſo entirely, as we were all, euen amazed to ſee it; and he continued in it, ſaying the Creed; and as ſoone, as he had paſſed through the firſt part thereof, he expired. When he was dead, he looked euen like an Angell; and as ſuch (in manner of ſpeach) he euer ſeemed, in my ſight, to be, both in Soule, and diſpoſition or humour; which he had, extreamly good. Nor doe I know, why I haue ſpoken thus much of him, vnleſſe it be to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſſe, and accuſe mine owne wickednes, ſo much the more; ſince, vpon the ſight of ſuch a death, and the knowledge of ſuch a life, I ought to haue amended, and reformed mine, if it had been but to grow the liker to ſuch a Father. His Confeſſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rius, who was a Dominican, and a great learned man, affirmed, that he made no doubt, but that my Father would goe ſtreight to Heauen; for he,
<pb n="77" facs="tcp:100776:75"/>
who had Confeſſed him diuers yeares, ſpake much of the great puritie of his Conſcience. This Dominican Father, being a very worthie man, and a true ſeruant of God, did me a great deale of good; for I Confeſſed my ſelf to him; and he vndertooke the profit of my Soule, with care; and to make me well vnderſtand the way of perdi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, wherein I was walking. He cauſed me alſo to Communicate euerie fifteen dayes; and be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginning firſt to treate with him, by little and little, I ſpoke with him afterward, at length, about my Prayer; and he told me, that I muſt not faile to vſe it; and that it could not, by anie meanes, but doe me good. I beganne, therefore, to vſe it againe; and from that time forward, I neuer left it; though yet I did not, for the preſent, giue-ouer the occaſions, of my imperfections.</p>
            <p>I therefore, in the meane time, paſſed a moſt ſad life; for, in Prayer, I came to vnderſtand my faults. On the one ſide, I was called by Almightie God; and on the other, I followed the world. All thoſe things, which belonged to God, gaue me great contentment; but thoſe things, which were of the World, tyed me vp, in chaines; and, it ſeemes, I had a minde, to make theſe two contraryes, friends, which yet are ſo much in enmitie, with one ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther; namely, a Spirituall life, on the one ſide; and ſenſuall paſtimes, contentments, and delights, on the other.</p>
            <p>In my Prayer, I endured much trouble, becauſe now, my Spirit was growne to be no longer, a
<pb n="78" facs="tcp:100776:76"/>
Lord, but a Slaue; and therefore I was not able to ſhut my ſelf vp, in my hart (which was the onlie way of proceeding, I formerly had held, in my vſe of Prayer) without ſhutting vp, a thouſand vani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties, togeather with my ſelf. I paſſed ſo manie yeares in this manner, that now I am aſtoniſhed to conſider, that anie perſon ſhould be able to endure, the not leauing, either the one, or the other, in ſo long a time. I well know, that now, it was no longer, in my hand, to giue ouer Mentall Prayer; for he held me now in his, who reſolued to doe me greater fauours. O that I could declare the occaſions of doing ill, which God remoued from me, in thoſe yeares; and how I put my ſelf againe, into them; and of the danger, wherein I was, to looſe all the opinion, and reputation, which I had in the world, from which he freed me; and of the haſt, which I made, to diſcouer, by my actions, what kinde of Creature I was; and the haſt, which our Lord made alſo, to couer theſe faults, and to diſcouer ſome little vertue of mine, if there were anie; and to make the ſame ſeem great, in the eyes of all men; in ſuch ſort, as that they euer held me, in much account. For, though ſometimes, my vanities would ſhine through my actions, yet they ſeeing other things in me, which appeared good, would not belieue the ill. But the true cauſe heerof, was, that the knower of all things ſaw, that this was fitt, to be ſo ordained; to the end, that, when afterward I ſhould come, to perſwade the world, to doe him ſeruice, they
<pb n="79" facs="tcp:100776:76"/>
might giue me ſome little credit, therin. And that Soueraigne Bountie of God, did not ſo much con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſider my great ſinnes, as it did thoſe deſires, which I had ſometimes, to ſerue him; and the great trouble I felt in my ſelf, for wanting power, and ſtrength, to put the ſame in execution.</p>
            <p>But, O thou Lord of my Soule! and how shall I euer be able to expreſſe, with fulnes, and clear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nes enough, the fauours, which thou shewedſt me, in thoſe yeares? and how, in that verie time, when I was offending thee moſt, thou madeſt ſuch haſt to diſpoſe my Soule, to a moſt profound remorſe, and ſorrow; that ſo I might come to taſt of thy regalo's, and great fauours againe? The truth is, O my King, that thou didſt vſe the moſt curious, and choice kinde of sharp punishment, which could poſſibly (to my thinking) be found for me; as one, who didſt well vnderſtand, what was likelie to coſt me, the deareſt of all other things; for thou didſt punish thoſe ſinnes of mine, with great regalo's. And I thinke, it is no imperti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nencie, which I vtter; though yet it were a kind of reaſon, that I should now, euen as it were, looſe my witts, whilſt I renew the memorie of my in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gratitude, and malice, towards thee. But really, it vvas ſo much a more painefull, and inſupportable kinde of thing, for me to receaue ſuch fauours, vpon the verie neck of my hauing falne into ſo great offences, then it would haue been, to endure grieuous punishments; that ſome one of thoſe ſayd fauours, ſo receaued, ſeemes clearly, and very
<pb n="80" facs="tcp:100776:77"/>
certainly, to haue euen ouer-wrought, and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feated, and confounded me more, then all my in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firmities, and torments, and other afflictions, put togeather, vvere euer able to doe. For, as for theſe latter afflictions, I found, that I deſerued them vvell; and I thought they might goe, in part, by vvay of ſatisfaction, for my ſinnes; though yet, euen in that kinde of account, I know, that my ſufferances vvere few, for my offences; vvhich vvere ſo manie, and ſo very great. But now, to ſee my ſelf receauing ſo freshly, ſo high fauours, vvhilſt yet the vvhile, I made ſo ill retribution, for thoſe, vvhich I had receaued before, is, in my account, a kinde of moſt terrible torment; and I thinke, it vvill be eſteemed ſo, by all ſuch, as haue anie knowledge, or loue of God; and vve may eaſily finde this to be true, euen by the naturall condition of perſons, vvho are vertuouſly in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clined. And hence flowed downe my teares, to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>geather vvith an indignation, to conſider, vvhat I found in my ſelf; for I ſaw, that ſtill I vvas, as vpon the pitch of returning to fall againe, although my firme purpoſes, and deſires, did then (I meane, ſo long as thoſe fauours laſted) ſtand faſt, and firme.</p>
            <p>A great inco<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>uenience it is, for a Soule, to find her ſelf ſolitarie, and ſingle, amongſt ſo manie dangers; and me thinkes, that if I had anie Crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, to whome I might haue imparted all this, it would haue holp me, not to fall againe; at leaſt, for ſhame of the world, if I would not be aſhamed, to offend God. I would therefore

               <note n="*" place="margin">An ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cellent Aduiſe.</note> aduiſe them, who make Mentall Prayer, and eſpecially at the beginning thereof, to procure ſome friendſhip, and familiaritie, with others, who haue the ſame deſigne; for, this is of much importance, though it ſhould be for no more, then to be aſſiſted by the prayers of one another; and how much more, when there is ſuch aduan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tage to be gotten alſo, otherwiſe. And, for my part, I cannot tell, why, ſince by meanes of conuerſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions, and humane inclinations (euen although they be not excellently good) men procure to get ſome friends, by whoſe meanes they may vnwea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rie themſelues, and may find an encreaſe of con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tentment, by recounting their vaine pleaſures to one another, it ſhould be ſo much, as permitted, that ſuch as beginne to loue, and ſerue Almightie God, in good earneſt, ſhould forbeare to impart, both their delights, and their afflictions, to ſome fitt perſons; ſince ſuch as vſe Prayer, are acquainted with both. For, if that Creature be in earneſt, who deſires to hold frie<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>dſhip, with his Diuine Maieſtie, there needs to be no feare of Vaine-Glorie; and when that Soule ſhould be ſet vpon, by anie firſt motion therof, he would eaſily get out of it, with merit.

               </gap>e, to be better taught, both in his owne vnderſtanding part, and in knowing alſo, how to inſtruct his friends. He, who should be ſubiect to Vaine-Glorie, for
<pb n="82" facs="tcp:100776:78"/>
ſpeaking vpon ſuch an occaſion as this, would alſo not faile to haue it, by being ſeen to heare Maſſe, with deuotion; and by doing other things alſo, to which he is yet expreſly bound, vpon the paine of being, otherwiſe, no good Chriſtian. And yet theſe things, muſt not be forborne, vpon the feare of a man's being ſubiect to Vaine-Glorie. Now, this is a point of ſo extreame importance, for the benefit of all ſuch Soules, as are not yet ſtrength<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned, and eſtablished in Vertue (who want not, both ſo manie Aduerſaries, yea and friends alſo, to incite them to ill) that I know not, how to ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſe it, with earneſtnes, and aduantage enough. And, to me it ſeemes, as if the Diuel loued to vſe this deuiſe, as a thing, which imports him very much; Namely, that men should hide themſelues as carefully, from ſuch, as can vnderſtand them, &amp; who would procure, to make them loue, and giue guſt to God; as he hath earneſtly incited others, to diſcouer their intemperate deſires. Which latter courſe, is yet ſo much taken, and followed, that it paſſes for a kinde of gallanterie, to talke of it; and ſo, vpon the matter, they publish the offences, which they committ againſt Almightie God, by this meanes.</p>
            <p>I know not, whether they be impertinencies, which I vtter; if they be, your Reuerence may be pleaſed, to teare them; and if they be not, I beſeech you, Sir, aſſiſt, and inſtruct my ſimplicitie, by adding much to them, vpon this ſubiect. For, the buſines of the Seruice of Almightie God, goes
<pb n="83" facs="tcp:100776:78"/>
now ſo weakly on, that they, who procure to ſerue him, had need ſupport, and ſuccour one another; that ſo, they may be able to get forward; ſo very much are the vanities, and foolish enter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainments of the world, growne, to be in fashion; and in ſuch ſort; that there are few eyes in the world, to diſcerne their fault. But if anie bodie, on the other ſide, doe but beginne, to giue himſelf to Almightie God, there are ſo manie, who will mur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mure at him, that he shall finde himſelf to haue need enough, to get companie, which may ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peare, in his defence; till ſuch time, as he be con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firmed, in not being troubled, for what he is put to ſuffer; which if he chance not to be, he may, perhaps, grow to ſee himſelf, in ſome ſtraights.</p>
            <p>And, perhaps, this may haue been the reaſon, why ſome Saints haue vſed, to retire themſelues into Deſerts. But, as it is a kinde of humilitie, not to put anie confidence, in a man's ſelf; ſo yet, is it no ſinne againſt pietie, to belieue, that God will not faile, to help him to liue amongſt them, with whome he is obliged, to conuerſe. But thus, Cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritie, by being communicated, will grow to be encreaſed; and there are a thouſand other bene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fits, which belong to this way of proceeding; where of I should not aduenture to ſpeake, if I had not great experience of the much importance heer of. True it is, that I am both the moſt weake, and the moſt wicked, of as manie Creatures, as were euer borne; but yet ſtill, I am apt to thinke, that, whoſoeuer will humble himſelf, though he
<pb n="84" facs="tcp:100776:79"/>
be ſtrong, and will yet, not belieue ſo much of himſelf, but, in this, will giue belief to another, who is endued with experience, ſhall neuer looſe anie thing, by the bargaine. Of my ſelf, I am able to ſay thus much, that if our Lord had not diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>couered this truth to me, and had not alſo giuen me meanes, to treate, in very vſuall manner, with ſuch perſons, as had the knowledge, and practiſe of Mentall Prayer, I had ſtill walked on, with falling and riſing, till I had euen dropped downe headlong into Hell. For, I wanted not manie friends, who would not faile, to help me to fall; but towards the recouering, and raiſing me vp, I found my ſelf ſo abſolutly alone, that now I am no leſſe then amazed, to conſider, how I remained not ſtill, laid flatt; and I praiſe the mercie of Al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mightie God; for it was he, and only he, who gaue me his helping hand. Let him be bleſſed, and praiſed, for euer, and for euer,</p>

            </argument>
            <p>I Haue not, without cauſe, been conſidering, and reflecting vpon this life of mine, ſo long. For, I am able to diſcerne well enough, that no bodie will haue guſt, to looke vpon a thing, ſo very wicked; And really, I would be glad, that all ſuch perſons as ſhould reade this Diſcourſe, might ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>horre me; to ſee a Soule, ſo pertinacious, and ſo vngratefull, towards him, who had vouchſafed it ſo great Fauours. And I wiſh, I could get leaue, to declare that multitude of times, that I failed of my obligation to Almightie God, in this number of yeares; by reaſon, that I was not applyed to, and ſupported by, the ſtrong pillar of Prayer. I paſſed through this tempeſtuous Sea, almoſt twentie
<pb n="86" facs="tcp:100776:80"/>
yeares, between theſe fallings, and riſings (though I roſe il-fauourdly enough, ſince I returned againe ſo quickly to fall) in this kind of life, tending to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards perfection; but yet in ſo baſe a way, as that I made no account at all, of Veniall <note place="margin">Take heed of this great danger.</note> Sinnes; and for ſuch as were Mortall, it is true, that, although I feared them, yet I did not euen that, as I ought, ſince I abſented not my ſelf from the danger therof; but I will be bold to ſay, that it is one of the moſt painefull kindes of life, that can poſſibly be imagined. For, I neither enioyed the ſweetnes of God, nor yet the ſatisfaction of the world. When I found my ſelf in the contentments of the world, the remembrance of what I owed to God, gaue me paine; and whilſt I was conuerſing with his Diuine Maieſtie, the inclinations, &amp; affections of the world, gaue me diſquiet. And this is a kinde of warre ſo very painefull, that I know not, how it was poſſible for me, to finde meanes, to endure it, for one moneth; and much more, how I could doe it, for ſo manie yeares; notwithſtanding that I yet clearly ſee, the great mercie, which Almightie God ſhewed me heerin (ſince I was to treat of manie things, in the world) that ſtill I ſhould haue the courage, to giue my ſelf to Prayer. I ſay, cou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rage; for, as for me, I ſee not, what one thing there is, of ſo manie, as are to be found in the whole world, wherein there is need of a greater, then to treat of committing Treaſons, againſt a King, and to know, that he knowes it well, and yet, neuer to goe out of his preſence. For, howſoeuer
<pb n="87" facs="tcp:100776:80"/>
it be very true, that we are alwaies in the preſence of Almightie God; yet me thinkes, that they, who conuerſe with him, in Prayer, are in his preſence, after a more particular manner; for they are ſeeing then, that he ſees them; whereas others may per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>haps, remaine ſome dayes in his preſence, and yet without remembring, that he lookes vpon them. True it is, that within that time, there were, I be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leiue, manie moneths, and ſometimes, peraduen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, a whole yeare, that I kept my ſelf from of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fending our Lord, and gaue my ſelf much, to Men<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tall Prayer; and I alſo vſed ſome, yea and manie diligences, that I might neuer grow more, to of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fend him. And becauſe all that, which I write now, is to be deliuered, with entirenes of truth, I declare my ſelf heer, as you ſee. But I remember little, of thoſe good dayes; and therefore it may be thought, they were few, and the ill ones, ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nie; yet few of thoſe few, paſſed away, without my allowing a good long time for Prayer, vnleſſe I were either very ſick, or extreamly buſie. The worſe I was in my health, the more I was vnited with God; and I procured, that ſuch perſons, as vſed to be with me, at thoſe times, might be ſo too; and I begged it of our Lord; and we ſpake very often, of him. And ſo, vnleſs it were that one yeare of which I haue ſpoke<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, in eight and twentie yeares, which haue paſſed, ſince I beganne firſt to vſe Mentall Prayer, I haue endured this battaile, and ſtrife, of treating, both with God, and the World, more then eighteen yeares. In thoſe other
<pb n="88" facs="tcp:100776:81"/>
yeares, whereof I am yet to ſpeake, the cauſe of the warre was changed, though of it ſelf, it was no inconſiderable thing; but, in regard that I was then, as I conceaue, in the ſeruice of Almightie God, and in a knowledge of the vanitie of what<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſoeuer this world can be, it did all, proue delight<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full, and pleaſant; as I will ſhew heerafter.</p>
            <p>Now, the reaſon, why I haue related all this, is; Firſt, (as I was ſaying before) to the end, that the mercie of Almightie God, togeather with my in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gratitude, may be well diſcerned; And Secondly, that it may be alſo vnderſtood, how great a bleſſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing Almightie God doth to that Soule, which he diſpoſes to vſe Mentall Prayer, with a good af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fection, and will; though yet it ſhould not be ſo very well diſpoſed for it, as were fitt; for, in fine, if he perſeuer therein, what Sinne ſoeuer he com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitt, and whatſoeuer Temptation be offered, and whatſoeuer Falls be giue<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> him, in a thouſand ſtra<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ge faſhions, by the Diuel <note n="*" place="margin">Conſider this point much, and often.</note>, I hold, in fine, for cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taine, that our Lord will draw him, at length, out of the Storme, into the Port of Saluation; as now, by all apparance, he hath drawne me; and I humbly beſeech his Diuine Maieſtie, that I may neuer returne againe, to be loſt.</p>
            <p>Manie holie, and good men, haue written of the benefit, which he obtaines, who exerciſes himſelf in Prayer; I meane, Mental Prayer; and glorie be to Almightie God, for being the cauſe thereof; and yet, if that were not true, though I haue little humilitie, yet am I not withall, ſo in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolent,
<pb n="89" facs="tcp:100776:81"/>
as that I would preſume to ſpeake vpon this ſubiect. But of that, whereof I haue ſome ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perience, I may vet preſume to ſay ſomewhat; and it is this; That, whoſoeuer hath begunne to fre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quent the vſe of Prayer, I wish him, not to giue it ouer, whatſoeuer ſinnes he committ in the meane time; ſince this is the meanes, by which he may recouer himſelf againe; which he will find to be of much more difficultie, without it. And let not the Diuel tempt him to leaue it, as he did me, vpon a pretence of humilitie; but let him firmly belieue, that his words can neuer want truth, who ſayd, That, if we will repent our ſelues in good earneſt, and reſolue to offend the Diuine Maieſtie no more, he reſtores vs to the ſame friendship, which we had before, with him; and doth vs the ſame fauours, vvhich he did vs before; and ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times, they proue to be much greater, if the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pentance deſerue it. And, vvhoſoeuer hath not yet begunne this exerciſe, I beſeech him, for the loue of our Lord, that he vvill no longer depriue himſelf, of ſo great a benefit.</p>
            <p>There is nothing, to be feared heer; but much, to be deſired. For, though a man should not pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceed ſo farr, as to ſtriue to gaine ſuch perfection, as may prepare, and, as it vvere, deſerue thoſe guſts, and regalo's, vvhich God is vvont to giue to ſuch perſons; yet the leaſt, vvhich he shall get, vvill be, that he shall be going on, in the vvay to Heauen. And I know ſo much, of the mercie of Almightie God, that I may conclude for certaine enough,
<pb n="90" facs="tcp:100776:82"/>
that no bodie euer tooke him for a friend, whome he did not well requite, for his paines. For, Men<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tall Prayer, is no other thing, in my opinion, then a Treatie, about making Friendſhip with Almightie God; and a freque<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t, and priuate Commerce, hand to hand, with him; by whome, we know, we are beloued. And, as for you, if you loue him not yet, (for, to the end, that it may be a true loue, and that your friendſhip may laſt, the conditions muſt be reciprocall; and we know, there can be no want on our Lord's behalf; and that our nature, is vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tious, ſenſuall, and vngratefull; and ſo, we cannot, perhaps, obtaine fully, at our owne hands, to loue him ſo much, becauſe he is not of the ſame con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dition, with vs) yet conſidering, how much it im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ports vs to hold friendſhip with him, and how much he loues vs, we muſt paſſe on, and paſſe ouer this paine, of being much in his companie, who is of ſo different a condition, from ours.</p>
            <p>O infinite goodnes of my God! how true it is, that, me thinkes, I ſee, both thee, and my ſelf, in this verie manner? O thou, who art the verie Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>galo of the Angels in Heauen! how faine would I euen defeat, and diſſolue my ſelf totally, in louing thee, when I ſee, and conſider, theſe things? And how certaine a thing it is, that thou art on the ſuffering hand, in regard of ſuch, as will not ſuffer thee, to remaine with them? O how good a friend, doſt thou make thy ſelf, to thy friend, O my Lord; and how doſt thou goe enduring him, and regaling him? And thou expecteſt, till he make
<pb n="91" facs="tcp:100776:82"/>
himſelf grow to be of thy condition, and inclina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion; and, in the meane time, thou endureſt, and permitteſt him to continue, to be a while, of his owne; and thou takeſt, O my deare Lord, by way of good payment, thoſe fitts of time, which he can be content, to beſtow vpon thee; and vpon a mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nute of true ſorrow, and repentance, thou for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>getteſt all thoſe ſinnes, whereby he hath offended thee. All this, haue I perceaued clearly, in order to my ſelf; and, for my part, I cannot ſee, O my Creatour, how the whole world, can forbeare, to procure to draw neer to thy Diuine Maieſtie; that ſo it may be able, to obtaine this particular kind of friendſhip with thee. Such as are wicked, and are not, hitherto, come to haue the like incli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nations, and diſpoſitions to thine, ſhould yet come towards thee; to the end, that ſo thou mightſt make them good; and that they might endure thee, to be with them, though it were but for ſome two howers, in the day; yea, euen though they would not, the while, ſtay in thy companie, without a thouſand diſtractions, and tumblings, vp, and downe, in wordlie cares, and thoughts; as I was wont to doe. And, for recompence of this violence, which they vſe to make againſt them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelues, by continuing in ſo good companie as thine, (for neither in thoſe verie beginnings, no, nor euen afterwards alſo, for a while, can they tell, how to doe better) thou forceſt, O Lord, the Diuels of Hell, to forbeare a ſetting fiercely vpon them; and permitteſt them, to haue daily, leſſe
<pb n="92" facs="tcp:100776:83"/>
power, then other, againſt them; yea, and thou putteſt them into mens hands, that they may ouercome them. So that thou, O thou Life of all liues, doſt neuer kill anie one of thoſe Creatures, who puts his confidence in thee; nor of them, who deſire thee, for a Freind; but thou ſuſtaineſt both the life of their Bodies, with encreaſe of health; and thou alſo doſt impart it, to the Soule. For my part, I cannot poſſibly vnderſtand, why men ſhould feare, as they doe, to beginne to vſe Mentall Prayer; nor of what it is, in fine, that they are afrayd. The Diuel, indeed, doth not ill, in order to his owne wicked ends, to procure to doe me hurt, if, by pretence, and meanes, of I know not what feares, he can procure, to make me forbeare a conſidering, how much, and how highly, I haue offended Almightie God; and how much, I am obliged to him, for his great mercies, and benefits; and to thinke vpon this truth, that there is ſuch a thing, as glorie in Heauen; and torments, in Hell; and vpon thoſe great afflictions, and ſorrowes, which our Lord endured for me, in this life. For, this was ſtill my Prayer, when I was continuing in all thoſe dangers; and vpon this, did I thinke, whenſoeuer I was able. And, very often, yea and for ſome yeares togeather, I was buſier, about de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiring, that the Hower might come quickly to an end, ſtill liſtning when the Clock would ſtrike; then vpon better things. Yea, and it hapned to me, manie times, that I knew not, what Pennance could be ſet before me, ſo very great, as that I
<pb n="93" facs="tcp:100776:83"/>
would not more willingly vndergoe it, then re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>collect my ſelf to Mentall Prayer. And it is cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taine, that either the Diuel, did ſet vpon me, with ſuch an vn-reſiſtable force; or els, mine owne vvicked cuſtome did it, that I might not goe make Mentall Prayer; and the ſadnes of my hart, vvas ſuch, euen vvhen I entred into my Oratorie, for that purpoſe, that I vvas faine to help, and ſerue my ſelf, of all the ſtrength, and courage I had, (vvhich, they ſay, is not very little; and it hath been ſeen, that God hath giuen me more, then is vſually poſſeſſed, by vvoemen, but that I haue em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ployed it ill) to force my ſelf, to make my Prayer; and, in fine, it pleaſed our Lord, to aſſiſt me. But afterward, vvhen I had vſed theſe violences to my hart, I found my ſelf vvith more quiet, &amp; delight; ſo that, ſometimes, I grew to haue an expreſſe deſire, to pray.</p>
            <p>Now, therefore, ſince it chanced, that our Lord did ſuffer, and endure ſo vvicked a Creature, as my ſelf; and if it appeare plainly, that all my mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeries vvere redreſſed, by this meanes; vvhat perſon, how vvicked ſoeuer he may be, can find anie thing, to be afrayd of, heer? For, how wicked ſoeuer, anie other bodie may haue been, he vvill neuer be ſo yet, after the enioying of ſo great Fauours, from our B. Lord, as I had receaued. And, vvho can euer come to diſ-confide in his Diuine Maieſtie, vvho had patience vvith me, ſo long, vpon this onlie reaſon, Becauſe I deſired, and pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cured ſome meanes, for time, and place, wherein
<pb n="94" facs="tcp:100776:84"/>
he might be with me? And euen this little thing, I did often, without anie inclination of mine owne, but only by the great violence, which either I offered to my ſelf, or els was offered to me, by our Lord.</p>
            <p>Since <note n="*" place="margin">Note this good Conclu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion vpon the Prae<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſes.</note> therefore, the vſe of Mentall Prayer is ſo fitt; yea and ſo very neceſſarie, euen for ſuch, as ſerue not God, but offend him; and ſince no bodie can truly find anie ſuch hurt, which it can poſſibly doe, as would not be much greater without Prayer; at leaſt, how can ſuch forbeare it, as ſerue Almightie God, and deſire to ſerue him? Moſt certainly, vnleſſe a man haue a minde, to paſſe through the troubles, &amp; miſeries of this life, with an addition of more miſerie, and to ſhut vp the verie gate againſt God himſelf, for feare, leaſt he ſhould giue him comfort, by this meanes, I cannot poſſibly vnderſtand this proceeding of his. I haue, really, great compaſſion, and ſorrow, for thoſe poore Soules, who will needs ſerue Al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mightie God, vpon their owne coſt; for, as for them, who vſe Mentall Prayer, our Lord himſelf beares their charges; ſince, for the little paines they take, he giues them ſo much guſt, that ſo, they may the better be able, to endure the taking of that paines in his company. Of theſe guſts, which our Lord is pleaſed to giue to ſuch, as perſeuer in the exerciſe of Mentall Prayer, there ſhall be more diſcourſe heerafter; and I will not make it heer. Only this, I will be bold to ſay, that, of all thoſe ſo great fauours, which it euer pleaſed our Lord to
<pb n="95" facs="tcp:100776:84"/>
doe me, the verie Gate, was Prayer; and if that come once to be ſhut, I know not, how God ſhall doe vs fauours. For though he ſhould haue a minde, to enter into a Soule, to regale both it, and himſelf in it, there is no meanes, by which to doe it; ſince he muſt haue it all to himſelf; and it muſt be cleane, and pure; and it muſt alſo haue a great deſire, to receaue fauours. And if our ſelues, on the other ſide, bring manie impediments, and take no courſe to remoue them, how ſhall we euer thinke, he can come to vs; and how can we con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceaue, that he will help vs?</p>
            <p>Now, to the end that his mercie may be ſeen, and the great benefit, which it was for me, not to haue giuen ouer, my Praying, and Reading, I will heer declare (ſince the vnderſtanding of it, im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ports ſo much) what batterie, the Diuel raiſes againſt a Soule, to gaine it; and what diligences, and, as it were, art and mercie, is vſed by B. Lord, for procuring to reduce it, to himſelf; that ſo, others may preſerue themſelues, from thoſe dan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gers, from which I kept not my ſelf. And, aboue all things, I humbly deſire men, for that great loue, wherewith our Lord goes endeauouring to winne vs back againe to himſelf, that they will keep themſelues carefully, out of the <note n="*" place="margin">Note this, very vvell; for nothing imports more, the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> this.</note> occaſions of Sinne; for, when once we are engaged therein, there is no truſt, or confidence to be had, where we are encountred, and aſſaulted, by ſo manie enemies, whilſt we, the while, are ſubiect to ſuch weaknes, which diſables vs, to make anie defence.
<pb n="96" facs="tcp:100776:85"/>
I would faine be able heer, to make a draught, and deſcription, of that captiuitie, wherein my Soule was, at thoſe times; for I well vnderſtood my ſelf to be in captiuitie; and yet I could not tell very well, to what I whas a Slaue; nor could I entirely belieue, that that which my Confeſſours thought fitt to aggrauate no more, was ſo very ill, as yet, I was apt to find it. A certaine perſon told me, when I went to him once, with a ſcruple, that, <note n="*" place="margin">A great and groſs errour.</note> although I were in ſtate of vſing high Contem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plation, yet ſuch occaſions, and conuerſations, were of no inconuenience to me. This hapned to me, towards the latter end, when I, by the fauour of God, vvent ſeparating my ſelf, more and more, from great dangers; but yet, I did not vvholy auoid occaſions. But now, vvhen they obſerued my good deſires, and my exerciſe of Mentall Prayer, they thought, I did great matters; but as for me, my Soule vnderſtood vvell enough, that it vvas not ſo much, as to performe, what I vvas obliged, for one, to vvhome I owed ſo much. I haue now, both pittie, and grief, to conſider, hovv much my Soule ſuffered at that time; and the little help, it gott from anie, but Almightie God; beſides the great facilities, and ouuertures, vvhich they made for me, towards certaine paſtimes, and contentments, by making me belieue, that they vvere lavvfull.</p>
            <p>But novv, the torment alſo, vvhich I had, by hearing Sermons, vvas not little; for I had a great affection, to heare them; in ſuch ſort, that, if I ſavv
<pb n="97" facs="tcp:100776:85"/>
anie man preach with ſpirit, &amp; very well, I carried a moſt particular affection to him; and that with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out anie endeauour of mine; nor doe I know, how I came to haue it. Me thought, no Sermon ſeemed ſo ill to me, which I could not gladly heare; though others would be of opinion, that he preached not well; but then, if the Sermon were good, it gaue me a very particular ſatisfac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion. To ſpeake of God, or heare him ſpoken of, did, in effect, neuer wearie me; I meane, after I had once begunne to vſe Mentall Prayer. Yet, on the one ſide, I was much comforted, with hearing Sermons; but, on the other ſide, they tormented me, becauſe I vnderſtood thereby, that I was not, by manie degrees, anie ſuch Creature, as I ought to haue been. I humbly begged of our B. Lord, that he would help me; but I belieue (by what I can now coniecture) that I was wanting, in the point of placing all my confidence, in his Diuine Maieſtie, and <note n="*" place="margin">A point of very great impor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance.</note> totally diſconfiding in my ſelf. I ſought for remedie; and I vſed manie diligences; but I vnderſtood not, that all is good for nothing, vnleſs firſt we ſtripp our ſelues entirely, of all confidence in our ſelues, and lodge it all, vpon Almightie God. I deſired, to liue a true life; for then I vnderſtood well enough, that, indeed, I did not liue, but that I fought, with the verie ſhaddow of death. But there was no bodie, who would giue me life; and as for me, I was not able to take it; and he, who was only able to giue it, had no reaſon, to bring me ſuccour; ſince he,

               <p>She declares, by vvhat meanes our Lord be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ganne to avvake her Soule, and giue her light, in ſo great darknes; and to ſtrengthen alſo her Vertues, that ſo she might offend him, no more.</p>
            </argument>
            <p>BVt now, my Soule was already growne, to be very wearie; and yet, the ill habits, which I had made, &amp; the ill cuſtomes, which I had vſed, would not permit her, to be vnwearied, and take reſt. It hapned to me one day, vpon my going into the Oratorie, that I ſaw a Picture, vvhich had been brought in, thither, to be kept; for they had bor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rowed it, to ſerue, for a certaine Feſtiuitie, vvhich vvas to be celebrated in the Houſe, about that time. The Picture vvas of Chriſt our Lord, full of vvounds, &amp; ſoares; and it vvas ſo deuoutly made, that, vvhen I looked vpon it, it moued me much; for it repreſented very vvell, vvhat he had endured for vs. And the ſenſe of the little gratitude to our Lord, vvhich I had conceaued, and expreſſed, for thoſe vvounds of his, vvas ſuch, that me thought, my verie hart, did euen ſplitt. And I caſt my ſelf earneſtly downe, neer the Picture, vvith a great ſhowre of teares, beſeeching our Lord humbly,
<pb n="99" facs="tcp:100776:86"/>
and earneſtly, that he vvould ſtrengthen me ſo farre, once for all; as that, at length, I might of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fend him no more.</p>
            <p>I was beſides, very much deuoted, to the glori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous S. Marie Magdalen; and I thought much, and often, of her Conuerſion; and eſpecially, vvhen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſoeuer I receaued the B. Sacrament. For, knowing, at that time, that our Lord vvas moſt certainly in my verie boſome, I placed my ſelf at his feet, as conceauing, that my teares vvould not be deſpiſed by him. I know not very vvell, vvhat I ſayd; but yet I know, that he, vvho vvas pleaſed, that I ſhould ſhed thoſe teares, did ſhew me fauour enough, for his part; ſince I forgot the ſenſe, and tendernes thereof, ſo ſoone. And I recommended my ſelf, to that glorious Saint, that ſhe might help me, to obtaine pardon of my Sinnes. But I conceaue, that I profited the more, in that laſt time, vvhen I prayed before the Picture; becauſe then, <note n="*" place="margin">Note.</note> I vvas growne into very great diſtruſt of my ſelf; and placed all my confidence, in Almightie God. To my thinking, I told him then, that I vvould <note n="*" place="margin">This vvas the begin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning, of many great bleſsings.</note> neuer riſe from thence, till he granted me, the humble Suite, which I had made; and I am fully of opinion, that it did me good; for, I haue gone improuing much, euer ſince that time.</p>
            <p>Now I continued to hold this manner of Prayer; becauſe, not being able to diſcourſe with my Vnderſtanding, I procured to repreſent Chriſt our Lord, to my minde, as being then, within my verie ſelf; and Ieuer alſo found it, to proue better
<pb n="100" facs="tcp:100776:87"/>
with me, in my opinion, when I conceaued my ſelf, to find him all alone. For, he being alone, and I being ſo much afflicted, me thought, he was to admitt me, yea, and to aſſiſt me too, as a perſon, who was in neceſſitie, and miſerie. Of this kind of Simplicities, I had manie; and in particular, I vſed to find my ſelf very well, in the Prayer of the Garden; yea, and I was in my kingdome, when I might acco<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>panie him there. I thought alſo much, vpon that Sweat, togeather with the great af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fliction, which he ſuſtained then; and I wiſhed, that I might haue been permitted, to wipe that moſt painefull Sweat, from his face; but I re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>member, how, in fine, I neuer durſt reſolue, to pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſume to doe it; ſo grieuouſly, did my Sinnes re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſent themſelues to me. Howſoeuer, I remained there, by him, as long as my thoughts would giue me leaue; but, the truth is, I had ſtore of ſuch, as tormented me. Moſt nights, during manie yeares, before I went to reſt, and when I was recom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mending my ſelf to God, ere I ſlept, I euer thought a little, vpon this paſſage, of his Prayer in the Garden; and that, euen before I was a Religious woeman; for, they told me, that I might gaine manie Indulgences by it; and, at leaſt, I am of opi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion, that my Soule got much, by this meanes; becauſe thus, I beganne to make Mentall Prayer, euen without expreſly knowing, what it was; and then, it was as vſuall for me, not to omitt this cuſtome, as not to faile of bleſſing my ſelf, with the Signe of the Croſſe, before ſleep.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="101" facs="tcp:100776:87"/>
But, to returne to what I was ſaying, of the torment, which my thoughts were wont to giue me. This ma<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ner of proceeding, without diſcourſe of the Vnderſta<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ding, hath this in it, That the Soule muſt both gaine much, and looſe much; I meane, all conſideration, and diſcourſe is loſt; for, as for profiting, they profit much, who vſe it, ſince all ſuch Prayer, is Loue. But, to ariue to this point, &amp; pitch, it will coſt euerie bodie, a great deale of paines, except ſuch, as our Lord vouchſafes to conduct, in a ſhort time, to Quiet Prayer; of which kind, I know ſome; and for them, who goe by this way, it will be good to haue ſome Booke, or other, at hand, that ſo they may recollect them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelues quickly. As for me, it did me alſo good, to looke vpon Fields, or Flowers, or Water; for, in theſe things, did I find the memorie of our Crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tour, as I alſo did, in mine owne ingratitude, and Sinnes; all which particulars, were wont to awake me, and recollect me, and to ſerue me, in ſtead of a Booke; for, as for Heauen, and ſuch high things as that, my Vnderſta<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ding was ſo dull, that I could neuer (I ſay, neuer) be able to haue, or frame anie imagination, or fancie, concerning them, till our Lord repreſented them to me, by other meanes. And I had ſo very little abilitie, to repreſent things to my minde, by way of the vnderſtanding-part, that my Imagination ſerued me not, to worke vpon anie thing, but only what I ſaw with mine eyes; which yet others are able enough to doe, who know, how to forme certaine repreſenta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions
<pb n="102" facs="tcp:100776:88"/>
of things to themſelues, vpon which they can recollect their thoughts.</p>
            <p>For my part, I could only thinke vpon Chriſt our Lord, as man; but yet it is very true, that how much ſoeuer I read of his Beautie, or ſaw his Pictures, yet could I neuer repreſent him, to my ſelf, but iuſt ſo, as one, who were either in the darke, or els ſtark blind, might be able, at that verie time, to repreſent anie other perſon to him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf. For, though ſuch an one, may ſpeake with ſuch another, &amp; know, that he is with that perſon, becauſe he is ſure, that the ſayd perſon is there; yet, in fine, he doth but vnderſtand, and belieue him, to be there, for he ſees him not; and in this ſort, did it happen to me, when I thought of our Lord.</p>
            <p>Vpon this reaſon, was I ſo great a friend, and fauourer of the vſe of Images, or holie Pictures. Miſerable Creatures are they, who looſe this be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nefit, through their owne fault. And it appeares alſo well enough, that they doe not loue our Lord; for if they loued him, they would be glad, to ſee his Picture; as heer it giues vs contentment, ſo ſee the pictures of thoſe perſons, whome we loue.</p>
            <p>About this time, they gaue me the Confeſſions of S. Auguſtin; and, it ſeems, our Lord did ſo ordaine it; for, neither did I procure them, nor had I euer ſeen them. I bare a very great affection, to this Saint, becauſe the Monaſterie, where I liued, before I grew to be Religious, was of his Order; and beſides, in regard, that he had been a Sinner;
<pb n="103" facs="tcp:100776:88"/>
for I alwaies found particular comfort in thoſe Saints, who, after hauing been Sinners, were con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uerted to our Lord; as conceauing, that I ſhould haue help, by their meanes; and that our Lord might alſo be induced to forgiue me, as he had done them. Saue only, that I was diſcomforted by this conſideration, (as I haue ſayd before) that our Lord called them but once, and they returned not, to fall from him, anie more; but, as for me, I had falne ſo often, that it afflicted me, to the verie hart. But yet ſtill, when I conſidered the loue he bore me, I grew to be encouraged againe; for I neuer diſtruſted his mercie, though I doubted of my ſelf, very often.</p>
            <p>O my deare Lord! how mightily doth that obſtinate ſtiffnes amaze me, to which my Soule muſt needs haue been ſubiect, whilſt it receaued ſo manie helps, at thy hand; and all in vaine? And it ſtrikes me with much feare, to conſider, how little I was able to winne vpon my ſelf, all that while; and, how I remained ſtill bound vp, from reſoluing to giue my ſelf, vvholy to thee. But, vvhen once I beganne to read the ſayd Confeſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſions, me thought, that Caſe, vvhich had been his, vvas alſo now, directly mine owne; and I recom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mended my ſelf much, to that glorious Saint. But, vvhen I came, aftervvard, to his Conuerſion, and read, hovv he heard that Voice in the Garden, it vvas, to my thinking, as if our Lord had made it to be vttered for me; ſo quick vvas that ſenſe, vvhich I had therof, in my hart; and I vvas, for a very
<pb n="104" facs="tcp:100776:89"/>
great vvhile, euen diſſolued, as it vvere, in teares, and felt a great affliction, and vexation. O my deare Lord; hovvmuch doth a Soule grovv to ſuffer, and vvhat torments doth it endure, for the looſing of her libertie, vvhilſt yet ſhe vvas created, and ordained, to be the Ladie of her ſelf, and to command? For my part, I am in a wonder, how I could be able to endure ſo great torments. But bleſſed be Almightie God, who gaue me life, till I might get out of that ſo deadly a death. And now, me thought, my Soule was obtaining great ſtrength, at the hands of that Diuine Maieſtie; and that now, he might grow to be pleaſed, to heare my. Outcryes, and haue compaſſion of my ſo manie teares.</p>
            <p>Vpon this, my affection to ſpend more time with him, beganne to encreaſe; and to take my ſelf alſo, out of the way of ill occaſions; for, when they once were gone, I began, to loue his Diuine Maieſtie againe. At leaſt, I thought, I might con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clude my ſelf then, to loue him; but the truth is, that I vnderſtood not, as I ought to haue vnder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtood, in what, the true loue of God, did conſiſt; and (to the beſt that I am able to iudge) I did euen ſcarce make an end, of diſpoſing my ſelf finally, to reſolue to ſerue him, when his Diuine Maieſtie began already, to vouchſafe me new Regalos, and Fauours. And it ſeemes, that, what others muſt be glad to endeauour to get, with much labour, our Lord was faine to find meanes, to make me content to accept; which was, in theſe
<pb n="105" facs="tcp:100776:89"/>
latter yeares, to delight, and regale me, in great meaſure. I neuer preſumed to deſire, that he would giue me euen ſo much, as anie tendernes of de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uotion; but I only begd ſo great mercie, as might winne him to allow me pardon, for my ſinnes already committed; and ſo much grace, as that I might committ no more. But, I ſeing, how great they were, durſt neuer aduiſedly deſire anie re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>galo's, or ſpirituall delights at his hands; for, me thought, he ſhewed me pittie enough, (and it was really, a very eminent mercie) to conſent, that I ſhould ariue to be in his preſence; conſidering how well I knew, that, if himſelf had not pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cured it, I ſhould neuer haue come. Only once, in my whole life, I remember, that, whilſt I was in great drynes of Deuotion, I deſired him, to giue me ſome little ſpirituall guſt; but as ſoone, as I re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flected, vpon what I had donne, I remained ſo full of confuſion by it, that the onlie vexation I had, to ſee my ſelf, with ſo little humilitie, did giue me that verie aduantage, which I had preſumed to beg.</p>
            <p>I was not ignorant, that it might be, no way, an vnlawfull thing, to deſire it; but I conceaued that this was true, for them, vvho vvere vvell diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſed to receiue it, by their hauing procured true deuotion, vvith all their power; vvhich conſiſts, in not offending Almightie God, and in being in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clined, and reſolued, to doe all that, vvhich vvas good. And mee thought thoſe teares of mine, vvere but faint, and feminine teares, and vvithout
<pb n="106" facs="tcp:100776:90"/>
anie force, or ſtrength; ſince I obtained not that, by them, which I deſired; though yet, vpon the whole matter, I alſo belieue, that they were vſefull to me, as I haue ſayd. For, in particular, after thoſe two ſeuerall times, of that ſo great compunction, and trauaile of hart, which I had, I beganne to giue my ſelf more, to Prayer, and to intereſt my ſelf leſſe, in ſuch things, as might doe me hurt; though yet I did not vtterly giue them ouer; but God (as I was ſaying) went helping me, to withdraw my ſelf, out of thoſe dangers. For, his Diuine Maieſtie did but expect ſome preparation, or diſpoſition in me, that ſo, his Spirituall Fauours might grow on, in ſuch ſort, as I ſhall relate; our Lord being not accuſtomed to grant them, but to ſuch, as main<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taine their Conſciences in more puritie, then mine had formerly poſſeſſed.</p>

               <p>She beginnes to declare the Fauours, vvhich our Lord did her in Prayer; and ſpeakes of that, vvherein vve may be able to help our ſelues; And hovv much it alſo imports vs, to vnderſtand the ſaid Fauours, vvhich our Lord is pleaſed to doe vs. She humbly deſires of him, to vvhome she ſends this account of herſelf, that, vvhatſoeuer she shall declare from hence forvvard, may re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maine in ſecret vvith him, ſince he had commanded her to ſet dovvne, in ſo par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticular a manner, the Fauours, vvhich our Lord vvas pleaſed to doe her.</p>
            </argument>
            <p>I Enioyed ſometimes (as I ſayd) ſome beginnings, of that, which I ſhall now declare; though it vſed to paſſe away, very quickly. It fell out, in this repreſentation, whereof I ſpake, when I placed my ſelf, neer Chriſt our Lord; yea, and ſometimes alſo, when I would be reading; that there would come ſuddainly vpon me, and without either ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pectation, or anie immediate preparation, on my part, ſuch an euident feeling of the <note n="*" place="margin">Her entrance into the receaue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing Su<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pernatu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rall Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uours.</note> preſence of Almightie God, as that I could, by no meanes, doubt, but that either he was within me, or els I, all ingulfed in him. This was not in the manner
<pb n="108" facs="tcp:100776:91"/>
of a Viſion, but I thinke they call it Myſticall Theologie; and it ſuſpends the Soule in ſuch ſort, that ſhe ſeems to be wholy out of her ſelf. The Will, is in act of louing; the Memorie ſeems to me, to be, in a manner, loſt; the Vnderſtanding, in my opinion, <note n="*" place="margin">It vvorkes not in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed, by vvay of vſing Diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>courſe, or makeing Inferen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces; but yet it vvorks, by vvay of Conte<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
                  <g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plation, and Ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miration of the Infinite Obiect, being God, vvho is ſet before it.</note> diſcourſes not; &amp; although, it be not loſt; yet it workes not in that kinde, as I was ſaying, but remaines, as it were, amazed, to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſider, how much it vnderſtands; though yet it pleaſes God, that it vnderſtand it ſelf alſo, not to vnderſtand fully, anie part of that, which his Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uine Maieſtie repreſents to it. Before this time, I had been vſed, to finde a very conſtant, and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinuall tendernes, or ſweetnes, which, I thinke, may, in ſome part, be procured; and it is a regalo, which is neither wholy ſenſuall, nor wholy ſpiri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tual; but it is wholy the guift, and bleſſing of Al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mightie God; and it ſeemes, that we may greatly help, towards the obtaining this, for our ſelues, by conſidering our owne baſenes, and the ingra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>titude, which we vſe, towards Almightie God; how much he did for vs; his Paſſion, and grieuous Torments; his whole Life, which was ſo full, of af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fliction; to delight our ſelues, in conſidering his Workes, and his Greatnes; &amp; how much he loues vs; and manie other ſuch things, as theſe; vpon which, whoſoeuer ſhall haue care to profit, will be able to fall manie times; though yet, he haue iuſt then, no particular deſigne that way. And if, togeather with theſe reflections, the partie fall out, to be poſſeſſed, and ſeazed with anie loue of
<pb n="109" facs="tcp:100776:91"/>
Almightie God, the Soule will be all regaled; the hart will be full of tendernes, and relenting; and teares will alſo abound; which ſometimes we ſhall ſeem to haue gotten, as it were, by force; and, at other times, our Lord will ſeeme to haue brought them ſo vpon vs, as that we were not able, to reſiſt them.</p>
            <p>Now it ſeems, that his Diuine Maieſtie is pleaſed to pay vs heer, for the little poore care, we tooke to ſerue him, with ſo high a guift, as that comfort is, which he beſtowes vpon a Soule, who ſees her ſelf able to lament, &amp; weep, for hauing offended ſo great a Lord. And I wonder not a whitt, at this; for, me thinkes, ſhe hath reaſon enough, and to ſpare, for receauing ioy, and comfort, vpon this occaſion. There, doth the Soule reioyce, &amp; there, doth ſhe regale her ſelf. I like that Co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>pariſon well, which offers it ſelf to me now, That theſe ioyes of Prayer, ſhould be ſomewhat like thoſe others, which are in Heauen. For, as they ſee no more there, then God is pleaſed that they ſhall ſee, ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to their deſerts; &amp; they acknowledging, how ſmall thoſe deſerts are, euerie one of them, is highly well content, with the place, wherein he is; though yet, there be an exceſſiue differe<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ce, betwee<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> the ioyes of ſome, and of others, in Heauen; yea much more, then there is between ſome ſpirituall ioyes, and others, heer on earth; which yet is very great. And really, a Soule, when God doth her this Fauour, at firſt, is very apt to thinke, that there re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maines no more then, to be deſired; and ſhe
<pb n="110" facs="tcp:100776:92"/>
eſteems her ſelf then, to be abundantly ſatisfyed, for all the ſeruice, which euer ſhe was able to pay Almightie God; and I finde, that ſhe hath, at leaſt, reaſon enough, to thinke ſo. For, euen one of thoſe ſingle teares (which yet we may, after a ſort, pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cure, in ſome part, euen of our ſelues; though ſtill, without the aſſiſtance, and fauour of God, we can doe abſolutly nothing at all) cannot be payd for, and purchaſed, in my opinion, with all the labours, and troubles of the world. For, a Soule gaines much by them; and indeed, what greater gaine can poſſibly, anie Creature acquire, then to haue ſome kinde of teſtimonie, that she is pleaſing to Almightie God.</p>
            <p>So that, let whoſoeuer ſhall arriue to this <note n="*" place="margin">Note.</note> point, praiſe God very much, and acknowledge himſelf, to be mightily in his Debt; for, already there is good apparance, that his Diuine Maieſtie deſignes ſuch a perſon, for his ſeruice, in his owne Houſe; and hath choſen him, for his Kingdome, without inte<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>tion, that he ſhall turne his back from him, anie more. And, let vs not care for certaine odd Humilities, which be in the world, whereof I intend to treat. For, ſome will needs eſteem it to be Humilitie, <note n="*" place="margin">A great &amp; foolish errour.</note> not to vnderſtand thoſe Guifts, which our Lord is beſtowing vpon them. But, as for vs, let vs well, and very well know, how the Caſe ſtands with vs; Namely, that Almightie God beſtowes them vpon vs, without anie merit at all, of ours; and let vs be thankfull to his Diuine Maieſtie, for them. For, if we know not, what
<pb n="111" facs="tcp:100776:92"/>
fauour we receaue, we ſhall not ſtirre our ſelues vp, to loue him for them, as we ought. For it is a moſt certaine truth, that the better we finde, that we are rich (knowing firſt, that of our ſelues we are poore) we grow to profit ſo much the more; yea and euen our very Humilitie, will proue to be more entire, and ſincere. That other courſe, ſerues but to accowardize the minde, and to make it hold it ſelf vncapable, of receauing great benefits, if our Lord, beginning once to beſtow them, it ſhall alſo beginne, to fright it ſelf, by a feare of Vaine-Glorie. But let vs rather belieue, that he, who doth vs ſo great Fauours, will giue vs alſo grace, that, if the Diuel tempt vs, vpon theſe occa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſions, we ſhall haue knowledge, how to vnder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtand him, and ſtrength from God, how to reſiſt him; I meane, if we goe on, with plainenes, and ſinceritie, as in the ſight of Almightie God, pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tending euer, to content him only, without reſpect to men. For, it is a very euident, and cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taine truth, that we loue a perſon the better, when we remember very freſhly, what benefits we haue receaued at his hands. And, if it be both lawfull, and meritorious, for vs to be euer keeping in memorie, that we haue our verie Being from Al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mightie God; and that he created vs of nothing; and that he vpholds vs ſtill; togeather with all thoſe other benefits, of his Paſſion, and Death, which he endured for euerie one of vs, who are now aliue, long before we were borne; why ſhould it not be alſo lawfull for me, who was
<pb n="114" facs="tcp:100776:93"/>
wont to treat of nothing, but vanities, to vnder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtand, and ſee, and conſider theſe things, often; eſpecially when now our Lord allowes me ſo great a bleſſing, as that I would not willingly, euen ſo much as ſpeake of anie thing, but of him. And now, behold heer a rich Iewel, which (re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>membring, that it is beſtowed vpon vs, and that already we are in poſſeſſion thereof) inuites, and euen obliges vs, to loue our Bleſſed Lord; And this, in fine, is the totall good of that Prayer, which is grounded vpon Humilitie.</p>
            <p>But what will then occurr, when they ſhall finde, that other more precious Iewels are come into their power, and poſſeſſion, which our Lord imparts to ſome of his ſeruants; as namely, a profund contempt, both of the whole world, yea and of themſelues? It is cleare, that, in this caſe, we muſt hold our ſelues, for deeper debtours, and more obliged, to ſerue him; and to vnderſtand, that, of our ſelues, we had no part of this Treaſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>re, at all; and to know the great bountie of our Bleſſed Lord, who, to a Soule ſo wicked, and ſo abſolutly without all merit, as mine, (for which, the firſt of thoſe Iewels aforeſayd, was not only ſufficient, but, by much, too great) would yet needs load mee ſtill, with greater treaſures, then I could euen tell, how to deſire. We muſt, in ſuch caſes, as theſe, procure to get new ſtrength where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>with to ſerue him; and by no meanes to be vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gratefull; for, our Lord giues them euer, vpon this condition, that, if we vſe not well, that trea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure,
<pb n="113" facs="tcp:100776:93"/>
and high place, wherein he puts vs, he will ſtripp vs of them againe; and, as for our parts, we ſhall come to be more poore, then euer we were, &amp; ſo his Diuine Maieſtie will diſpenſe his Treaſures, to ſuch others, as he ſhall thinke fitt; &amp; who may benefit, both themſelues, and others, by the good vſe thereof.</p>
            <p>But now, how ſhall that man improue his owne Stock, and ſpend thereof, with latitude of hart, vpon others, whilſt yet he is not come ſo farr, as to know, that himſelf is rich<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> It is, in my opinion, an impoſſible kinde of thing (conſider<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the grounds of Humane Nature) for one to doe great, and goodlie things, if he vnderſtand not himſelf, to be fauoured, by Almightie God; for, we are ſo miſerable Creatures, and ſo incli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned to delight in things of this world, that we can hardly abhorre, effectually, all that, which heer we enioy (and especially, to doe it, with great libertie of Spirit) if we vnderſtand not out ſelues, to haue ſome kind of taſt, or pawne, concerning Heauenlie things; for, by meanes of ſuch bleſſings, as theſe, doth our Lord impart that Fortitude to vs, which we loſt by our Sinnes. And he ſhould but vnluckily deſire, and exhort a man, to deſpiſe, and abhorre the world; and encourage him to acquire, all thoſe great vertues, which Chriſtians of high perfection, vſe to poſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeſſe; if he were not vpheld therein, by a Liuelie Faith, and by his hauing alſo felt ſome aſſurance, of the loue, which our Lord, was pleaſed to beare
<pb n="114" facs="tcp:100776:94"/>
him. For naturally, we are ſo very dead, that we looke not after anie thing, but that, which we ſee, at the preſent; and ſo, theſe verie Fauours, are the things, which awake, &amp; ſtrengthen our Faith. I ſay not, but that it may very well be, that I, being ſo very wicked, am apt, to iudge of others, by my ſelf; &amp; that thoſe others may need no more, then the verie light, and truth of Faith, for the making their workes very perfect; but I (as very miſerable) haue bee<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> in need, of all poſſible helps. Others may well ſay what they pleaſe, but I relate, what hath occurred to me; as they, who haue power ouer me, co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>mand; and if he, to whome I ſend it, doe not like it, he may teare it; as knowing better then I, what is vnfitt; Whome I humbly beſeech, euen for the loue of our Bleſſed Lord, that, whatſoeuer I haue ſayd hitherto, concerning my wicked Life, and my Sinnes, he will publiſh it; and from this inſtant, I giue leaue, both to him, and all them, who haue been my Ghoſtlie Fathers (of which number he is, to whome this goes addreſſed) that they doe it euen now, whilſt I am liuing; to the end, that euen now. I may deceaue the vvorld, no longer; vvhich els, perhaps, may thinke, that there is ſome good thing in me; and really, and very really, I ſpeake truth, to the beſt, that I can novv vnderſtand of my ſelf, that he ſhall giue me great comfort, if he vvill doe it.</p>
            <p>But as for that, vvhich ſhall follovv heerafter, in this Diſcourſe, I allovv him no ſuch libertie, at all; nor vvill I, by anie meanes, giue vvay, that if
<pb n="115" facs="tcp:100776:94"/>
they chance to ſhevv the thing to anie Creature, they declare, vvho that perſon is, vvith vvhome it paſſed; nor, vvho vvrote it; and for this reaſon, haue I forborne, to name, either my ſelf, or anie other, vvho hath interuened to the Storie. But I haue done the beſt I could, to vvrite it ſo, as that I may not be knowne; and I deſire, for the loue of our Lord, that it may euer remaine, as a Secret. For it vvill ſuffice, that there are ſo learned, and graue perſons, as may authorize anie thing, vvhich is good, if our Lord vvill giue me grace, to relate it; and if there be, it muſt be his, and not mine; for they only, vvho command me to vvrite it, knovv, that I vvrite it; and at the preſent, they are not heer; and I vvrite it alſo, as it vvere, by ſtealth, and vvith vvant of time, and vvith ſome trouble, becauſe I am kept from ſpinning; and I liue in a poore Houſe, and haue buſines enough; and, if our Lord gaue me more abilitie, and memorie, (of both vvhich, I haue very little) I might yet, by meanes thereof, ſerue my ſelf, of vvhat I had heard, or read. So that, if I ſay anie thing, vvhich is good, our Lord vvill ſerue himſelf of it, for ſome good end; but vvhatſoeuer is ill ſayd, vvill be mine owne; and that, your Reuerence may blot out. And, both for the one, and for the other, there vvill be no reaſon at all, to declare my name. During anie bodies life, it is cleare, that the good he doth, is not to be related; and after death, it vvill alſo ſerue for nothing, in this caſe; but only to make it looſe all authoritie, and credit, for
<pb n="116" facs="tcp:100776:95"/>
hauing been recounted, by a perſon, ſo baſe, and ſo vvicked, as my ſelf, And, becauſe I hope you vvill doe that, vvhich I ſay, (and I humbly beg it of you, euen for the loue of our Lord; and of thoſe others alſo, vvho are to ſee it) I write, as you ſee, vvith all libertie, and clearnes; for otherwiſe, I ſhould haue great ſcruple to doe it, but only, for the meer declaration of my Sinnes; and in that, I haue none at all. As for other things, it is enough, that I am a woema<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, to make my wings fall downe, flatt by my ſides; and hovv much more then, ſince I am not only a weoman, but a wicked woeman?</p>
            <p>And therefore, whatſoeuer your Reuerence ſhall finde heer, beyond the bare relation of the courſe of my Life, you muſt take, to be only, for your ſelf; ſince you would needs importune me ſo farre, as to make you ſome declaration of the Fauours, which our Lord had been pleaſed to doe me, in Prayer; ſuppoſing euer, that you hold them to be in conformitie, with the Truths of our Holie Catholick Faith; for, if not, you are inſtantly to burne it; and to this Direction, I will ſtand. So that I will declare, what paſſed with me, in this kinde; to the end, that if it ſhall proue conforme to Catholick truth, it may be of ſome ſeruice to you; and if not, that you may be the better able, to vndeceaue my Soule; and ſo, the Diuel may get nothing by that, whereby I tooke my ſelf, to gaine. For, our Lord knowes, that I euer haue procured, to meet with perſons, who might giue me light, as I ſhall ſhew afterward.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="117" facs="tcp:100776:95"/>
But, how clearly ſoeuer I ſhall ſtriue to declare theſe things, concerning Prayer, it will fall out to be obſcure enough, for ſuch as haue no expe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rience therein. I will touch alſo, vpon ſome impe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diments, which (according to my way of vnder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtanding) vſe to oppoſe themſelues againſt ſuch perſons, as are walking on, in this way; and I will alſo point at ſome others, in which there may be ſome danger, according to what our Lord hath taught me, by experience. And I haue ſince, treated with great learned men, and perſons, who had giuen themſelues to Spirit, manie yeares; and they ſee, that his Diuine Maieſtie hath vouchſafed me, in ſeauen and twentie yeares, wherein I haue vſed Me<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>tall Prayer, (though I haue walked on, ſo ill, &amp; with ſo manie ſtumbling blocks, in the way) that experience, which he hath not allowed to others, in ſeauen and thirtie, yea and in ſeauen and fourtie yeares; whilſt yet, they had ſpent their liues in Pennance, and euer, in a courſe of Vertue.</p>
            <p>Let him be Bleſſed for all; and I be ſeech his Diuine Maieſtie euen by what he is himſelf, that he will vouchſafe to be ſerued by me. For, my deare Lord knowes very well, that I pretend no other thing by this, but only, that he may be a little the more exalted, and praiſed; when you ſee, that he would needs plant a Garden, of ſo ſweet Flowers, vpon, and in a Dung-hill, ſo fowle, and filthie, and of ſo very ill fauour, as I am. I humbly beſeech his Diuine Maieſtie, that I returne not, through my fault, to pluck them all, vp, by
<pb n="118" facs="tcp:100776:96"/>
the rootes, and ſo become againe, what I was before. And this, doe I intreat your Reuerence, that you will beg of our B. Lord, for me; ſince you know, with more clearnes, what I am, then heer you haue giuen me leaue to expreſſe.</p>

            </argument>
            <p>NOw, to ſpeake of them, who beginne to be Seruants of our Bleſſed Lord, for Loue, (and to me it ſeemes, to be nothing els, to reſolue to follow him, by this way of Prayer, who loued vs ſo much) I find it to be a thing of ſo great dig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nitie, that I regale my ſelf, after a ſtrange manner, euen by the very thought thereof. For, ſeruile feare will inſtantly flye away, if we carrie our<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelues, as we ought, in this firſt degree of Prayer. O thou Lord of my Soule, and my eternall Good! how comes it to paſſe, that, when a Soule reſolues to loue thee, and to doe the vttermoſt ſhe can, to leaue all this world, that ſo ſhe may the better
<pb n="119" facs="tcp:100776:96"/>
employ her ſelf vpon this loue of thee, thou art not pleaſed, that ſhe ſhould inſtantly enjoy the getting vp, to poſſeſſe this perfect loue? But I haue ſayd ill; for I ought indeed, to haue ſayd, that I complaine againſt our ſelues; becauſe it is wee, who will not poſſeſſe it, ſince all the fault is ours, for not inſtantly obtaining this true loue of God with perfection, which carries all kindes of bleſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſings in company thereof. For, the matter is, that we ſet ſo high a price, vpon our ſelues, and we are withall, ſo ſlow, in giuing our harts <note n="*" place="margin">Behold heer the true &amp; great impedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment.</note> totally to God, that, as his Diuine Maieſtie, on the one ſide, will not permitt, that we should enioy ſo pretious a thing, without paying well for it: ſo, on the other, we neuer make an end, of diſpoſing our ſelues therein, as we ought. I am able to ſee well enough, that there is nothing at all, in this world, with which, ſo great a treaſure can be bought; but yet, if we did indeed, what we could, by not faſtning our ſelues, to anie thing of this world, but that all our cares, and conſidera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions, were ſent-vp to Heauen, I am confident, that this bleſſing would be imparted to vs, with very great ſpeed, if ſpeedily, and entirely (as I was ſaying) we diſpoſed our ſelues, to the receauing thereof, as ſome Saints haue done. But the miſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rie is, that we thinke, we giue God all; and the truth is, that we offer his Diuine Maieſtie, but the yearlie Rents, or Reuenues, and Fruits, our ſelues remaining ſtill, with the rootes, and poſſeſſion of the Land. We reſolue, to make our ſelues poore,
<pb n="120" facs="tcp:100776:97"/>
for God's ſake, and it is a point of great merit, to doe ſo; but yet, we returne manie times, to take care, and to vſe diligences enow, that nothing may be wanting to vs; I ſay not, of that, which is neceſſarie, but ſometimes alſo, euen of that, which is ſuperfluous; and to be procuring, alſo, to make friends, who may help vs to it, and ſo put vs ſtill, into more care, yea, &amp; perhaps, into more danger too, (that ſo we may grow to want nothing) then euen we had before, when we were the poſſeſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſours of our owne eſtates.</p>
            <p>It ſeemes alſo, that, when we came to be Reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gious, or as ſoone as we beganne to lead a Spiri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tuall: life, and to aſpire towards perfection, we gaue-ouer, to care for the honour of this world; and yet, as ſoone as euer anie Creature beginns but to touch vs, in that kind, we forget, that we had already, giuen it away, to Almightie God; and we reſolue ſometimes, to ſnatch it againe, out of his hands, and runne away with it, euen after we ſeemed to haue voluntarily made him, the entire Lord therof. And iuſt thus, doth it alſo happen ſometimes, in other things. Now, this indeed is a very delicate, fine, foolish, ridiculous way of ſeeking the loue of Almightie God, when, togea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther with this pretence, we will (as a man may ſay) haue our hands ſtill full of the ſame imperfect inclinations, and affections, vvhich vve had be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore; ſince vve doe not procure indeed, to effect our owne former good deſires; and ſtill vve en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deauour not, at length, to raiſe them vvholy vp,
<pb n="121" facs="tcp:100776:97"/>
from the earth; and yet vve vvill needs expect, the while, to enioy manie Spirituall comforts, and delights. But this, ſeemes not to be of a Suite; nor doth the one Stuffe, ſitt well, vvith the other; and therefore, becauſe vve vvill not once reſolue, to giue our ſelues totally vp, to Almightie God, vve come not totally, to enioy this Treaſure. And I pray God, it may pleaſe his Diuine Maieſtie, to vouchſafe to grant it to vs, though it should be, but by drop, and drop; and though it should grovv to coſt vs, all the labours, and troubles of the vvhole vvorld.</p>
            <p>A very great deale of mercie doth our Bleſſed Lord shevv to that perſon, to vvhome he giues the firme purpoſe, and grace, to reſolue vpon procuring this bleſſing, vvith all his power; for certainly, if ſuch an one shall perſeuer, Almightie God vvill deny himſelf to no Creature, but will, by little and little, goe enabling that Soule, in ſuch ſort, as that, at length, it shall find it ſelf to be victorious. But I ſayd, that the Partie muſt haue courage; becauſe the Diuel doth ordinarily, in the beginnings, diſpoſe himſelf, to repreſent, yea and frame, very great difficulties; to the end, that ſo we may not hold-on this way, in good earneſt; as one, who knowes very vvell, vvhat preiudice is like to grovv to him by it; not only, through his looſing the Soule of that Partie, but of manie others alſo; if he, vvho beginns to ſerue God, endeauour once, by his fauour, to ariue to the perfection therof. For, I belieue, that ſuch an one will neuer goe alone, to Heauen, but will
<pb n="122" facs="tcp:100776:98"/>
carrie very manie with him; and that, like a good Captaine, he shall finde, that God will giue him a faire Companie. So that, ſince the Diuel will be ſure, to lay ſuch dangers, and difficulties, in his way, there will be need of very great courage, and reſolution, to keep one from running away; yea and alſo, there vvill be need of much, and much, and very much fauour, and mercie of Almightie God, for this purpoſe.</p>
            <p>Now therefore, to ſpeake of the beginnings of ſuch, as be already reſolued, to goe in ſearch, after ſo great a bleſſing, and to obtaine, vvhat they aſpire to, in the end, (for, as for that, vvhereof I vvas going once to ſpeake, concerning Myſticall Theologie (for ſo I thinke it is called) I vvill treat thereof afterward) the great, and greateſt trouble, conſiſts euer, in theſe verie beginnings. For, thoſe are they, which coſt moſt, when a Soule comes, to giue our Lord the whole Stock. And, in the other degrees of Prayer, which follow, the moſt part of that, which paſſes, is delighting, and enioying; though yet ſtill, both the Firſt, and the two Middle ones, and euen the Laſt, haue, all of them, their ſeuerall Croſſes to carry, yet, in a dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferent kind. But, in fine, all they, who will follow Chriſt our Lord, muſt goe by that verie way, where he went, vnleſſe they will haue a minde to be loſt. And happie are thoſe troubles, which be endured heer, ſince euen heer, they are ſo ſuperabundantly recompenſed, and payd.</p>
            <p>I muſt now ſerue my ſelf of ſome Compari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon,
<pb n="123" facs="tcp:100776:98"/>
which yet I would be glad, to forbeare, in regard, that I am a woeman; and would faine ſet that downe, very ſimply, and plainly, which they command me to ſay. But this language of Spirit, is ſo very hard to be declared, by ſuch, as are vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>learned, like me, that I muſt ſeek ſome particular way, how to doe it. And it is likelie, that I ſhall ſeldome hitt tight, in making the Compariſon ſerue; but, in that caſe, it may paſſe for your re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>creation, to ſee, how very improper, and rude I am.</p>
            <p>To my remembrance, I haue either read, or heard this <note n="*" place="margin">This Saint is admira<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble, in all the Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pariſons vvhich the vſes.</note> Compariſon, which followes heer; for, my memorie is ſo very imperfect, that I know not how, nor vpon what occaſion, I mett with it, firſt; but it contents me, at leaſt, for the preſent, in order to what I haue in hand. He, who beginnes in the way of Prayer, muſt conceiue that he is be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginning to frame an Orchard, or Garden, for the contentment, and delight of his Lord; though yet it be in a very vnfruitfull Soile, and full of Weeds. His Diuine Maieſtie now is he, who muſt be pleaſed to plant good Hearbes, and root the ill ones vp. But now wee will make account, that this is done already, in our caſe, when a Soule, not only reſolues, to vſe Prayer, but hath already, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gunne to vſe it. And now, by the help of our Lord, we muſt procure, like carefull Gardners, that theſe good Herbes, which are planted, may grow; and we muſt take care, to water them, that ſo, they may not wither, but may come to yeild Flowers of ſo
<pb n="124" facs="tcp:100776:99"/>
excellent odour, as may ſerue to be of recreation to this Lord of ours; that ſo, he may take pleaſure, to come often, into this Garden of his, and delight himſelf, amongſt theſe vertues of our Soules.</p>
            <p>Now let vs ſee, in what ſort, theſe Flowers may be watred, that ſo we may come to vnderſtand, what we are to doe, and what trouble it is like<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lie to coſt; and whether the gaine will proue to be more, then the labour; and how long it will be likely to laſt. As for me, it occurrs to me, to thinke, that theſe Plants may be watred, by fowre wayes: Either, by drawing water, out of a Well, which wee cannot doe without much labour; or by way of a <note n="*" place="margin">This is a kind of Engine, vvith certaine little leather Buckets fastned to the ſides of a very great vvheele, vvhich dra vves vp, very much vvater, vvith great eaſe. In Spanish it is called a Noria.</note> Wheele, with certaine little Buekets, belonging to it, which is eaſily turned about, by the hand; and my ſelf haue drawne ſome, thus, now and then; and I find, that it brings vp more water, with leſſe trouble, then doth that, of the former way. Or els, by meanes of letting in, ſome little Brooke, or Riuer, into the Garden; and, by this meanes, the Garden is watred much better, then by the former; and the earth remaines with more moiſture; and there will not be need, to water it ſo often; and the labour alſo of the Gardner, is much leſſe. Or els, in fine, when there falls a good Showre of Rayne vpon the Garden, for then, the Lord himſelf waters it, without anie labour at all, of ours; and this is, without compariſon, the very farr beſt way, of all the fowre.</p>
            <p>But now, for applying theſe foure wayes of
<pb n="125" facs="tcp:100776:99"/>
vſeing Water, whereby this Garden of ours, is to be preſerued (becauſe a Garden without water, is to periſh) that, which, me thinkes, is to our pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe, is, that we may, by this Similitude, declare ſomewhat, of theſe foure degrees of Prayer; into which, our Lord, through his goodnes, hath ſometimes brought my Soule. And I humbly be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeech him, of his mercie, that I may hitt right, vpon what I am about to ſay; in ſuch ſort, as that it may be of vſe, and profit, to one of thoſe perſons, who commanded me to write thus much; and whome our Lord hath drawne further on, in foure moneths, then I was able to get, in ſeauenteen yeares. But certainly, he diſpoſed himſelf better; and ſo, the Gardner hath watred his Orchard, without anie trouble at all, to the Partie, with all theſe foure kindes of Water; though the laſt of the foure, haue not yet, come to his turne, but by drops. But, the buſines goes on, in ſuch ſort, that by the fauour, and help of our Lord, he will quickly ingulfe himſelf therein; and I ſhall be hartily glad, if he laugh at me, in caſe he finde the manner of my declaring this Point in queſtion, to haue been impertinent.</p>
            <p>Of them, who beginne to hold Prayer, we may ſay, that thoſe are the perso<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>s, who draw water out of the Well, which vſes to be very troubleſome, as I haue ſayd; for they are likelie, to take much paines, about recollecting their Senſes; which hauing been vſed, to wander, and goe ſcattered, vp, and downe, it is wont to be of trouble enough.
<pb n="126" facs="tcp:100776:100"/>
Theſe men <note n="*" place="margin">A good Leſſon.</note> haue therefore need, to goe accuſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>toming themſelues, not to deſire to ſee, or heare impertinent things; and to obſerue their howers of Prayer; and to loue to be alone; and to conſider the life, which they haue lead; and to doe it, hand to hand, by themſelues. And though all theſe, whether they be, either of the Firſt Degree, or of the Laſt, are to employ themſelues vpon theſe thoughts, very often; yet there is to be of the more, and of the leſſe, in theſe cogitations; as I will ſhew afterward. At firſt, they are wont, to be in ſome paine, becauſe they vſe not, to be fully enough ſatisfyed, that they repent themſelues ſufficiently of their Sinnes; and yet they faile not to doe it, ſince they reſolue to ſerue Almightie God, in ſo very good earneſt. They muſt procure, to meditate much, vpon the Life of Chriſt our Lord; though the Vnderſtanding, will perhaps, be wearie of this. But yet hitherto, we may be able, to be of ſome help, to our ſelues; I meane, to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>geather with the fauour of our Lord; for, without this, the world knowes well enough, that we are not able, ſo much as to haue a good thought.</p>
            <p>Now, This is to beginne, to draw Water out of a Well; and I pray God, there fall out to be any; but at leaſt, the fault is not ours, if there be none; ſince we endeauour to draw it; and ſince we doe, what we can, towards the watring of theſe Flowers. And Almightie God, is ſo very good, that when (for reaſons, beſt knowne to his Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uine Maieſtie, yea, and perhaps, euen for our owne
<pb n="127" facs="tcp:100776:100"/>
greater good) he will haue this Well, to be dry, he is pleaſed (ſo that ſtill, we doe our parts, like good Gardners) to ſuſtaine theſe Flowers, without anie Water at all; and to make our vertues grow. I meane heer, by Water, Teares; whereof there may, peraduenture, be none; as alſo no tendernes, or inward feeling of Deuotion.</p>
            <p>But, what ſhall he doe now, who ſees, that, for the ſpace of a long time, there is nothing but drynes, and diſguſt, and diſpleaſure; and ſo little deuotion alſo, to goe draw anie more Water, out of the Well? For, certainly, if he did not remem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber, that he doth ſome kind of pleaſure, and ſeruice, to the Lord of the Garden, and did not take care, not to looſe all the labour, which he hath already vndergone, and the hope alſo of getting more, by ſo great paines, as he takes, to caſt the Bucket ſo often into the Well, and to bring it back, without anie water at all; without doubt, he would giue ouer, outright. And, manie times, it ſhall alſo happen to him, vpon this oc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>caſion, that he will not ſo much as ſtirr his hand; nor will he be able, ſo much as to continue in one good thought; for, already, it is to be granted, that this way of working, by the employment of the Vnderſtanding, is a ſtriuing, to draw Water out of a Well.</p>
            <p>But now, as I was ſaying, what is the Gardner to doe in this caſe? I <note n="*" place="margin">A con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſidera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of much comfort.</note> anſwer, that he is to reioyce, and to receaue much comfort; and to eſteem it, for an incomparable Fauour, that he may be ſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fered,
<pb n="128" facs="tcp:100776:101"/>
to labour, and worke in the Garden, of ſo great an Emperour, as God is. And, ſince he knowes, that he giues contentment to his Diuine Maieſtie thereby, (for, the guſt, &amp; ſeruice of God, &amp; not the Gardners owne, is to be his maine, and finall ſcope) let him giue God glorie, and praiſe, who proceeds with him, and treats him, in ſo confident a manner; ſince he giues him grace, to haue ſo great care of doing that, which he recom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mended to him, though he doe not pay him yet, for his paines. And let this Gardner ſtill, help our Lord, to carrie his Croſſe; and remember, that the ſame Lord, liued, and lay vpon the ſame Croſſe, all his life. And let not this man deſire, to enioy his Kingdome heer, in this World; nor euer once giue-ouer his Prayer; but let him rather reſolue, that, though his drynes of ſenſible inde<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uotion, ſhould laſt with him, as long, as his life, yet he will neuer giue occaſion, that Chriſt our Lord ſhould fall downe, with his Croſſe. For, at leaſt, the time will certainly come, when he ſhall receaue all his wages, at one payment; and let him neuer feare, that his labour can poſsibly be loſt; for, he ſerues a very good Maſter, who ſtands looking earneſtly vpon him. And let him make no account at all, of ill thoughts, but con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſider, that the Diuel did alſo vex S. Hierome with them, in the verie Wildernes. But thoſe labours, haue their price, and recompence, ſet out for them; and I aſſure you, as a perſon, who haue ſpent manie yeares, in the feeling therof, that,
<pb n="129" facs="tcp:100776:101"/>
when ſometimes I came to draw, and get but ſome one ſingle drop of water, out of this bleſſed Well, I thought, that God did me a great Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uour.</p>
            <p>I know well, that theſe troubles are very great; and I conceaue, that there is more need of cou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rage, for ſupporting them, then for manie other things, of this world; but yet I haue ſeen clearly, that God leaues them not, without great reward, euen in this life. For it is moſt certaine, that, with one of theſe howers of guſt, of himſelf, which he hath giuen me heer, afterwards I eſteem all thoſe ſad afflictions, to haue been very well rewarded, which I ſuſtained, in all the former time, of my continuing the vſe of Prayer. As for me, I hold, that our Lord will giue theſe torments (togeather with manie other temptations, which occurr) manie times, in the beginning; and at other times, towards the end; to try, who are his true Louers; and to know if they can drinke of his Chalice, and will help him, to beare his Croſſe, before he will depoſitate ſo great treaſures in them. And I conceaue, that his Diuine Maieſtie is reſolued to carrie vs on, by this way, to the end, that we may firſt vnderſtand well, how little we are worth; for, the Fauours, which ſometimes he imparts afterward, are of ſo great dignitie, that he will, firſt, haue vs ſee our miſerie, by experience, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore he impart thoſe great Fauours, to vs; leaſt otherwiſe, that ſhould happen to vs, which did to Lucifer.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="103" facs="tcp:100776:102"/>
But, what is it, O my Lord, which thou art doing? Were <note n="*" place="margin">A hard queſtion, moſt clearly, and ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cellently anſvve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red.</note> it not better, for the good of that Soule, which thou knoweſt, to be already thine, and which puts it ſelf into thy hands, to follow thee, whitherſoeuer thou wilt goe, though it were euen to the verie death of the Croſſe; and to reſolue to help thee to carrie it, and neuer to leaue thee alone, vnder that burthen? No; for, whoſoeuer findes this reſolution in himſelf, hath nothing left for him, to feare. Spirituall perſons haue no reaſon at all, to be afflicted, who are already placed, in ſo eminent condition, as it is, to treat with God, hand to hand; and to forſake the idle paſtimes of this world. The greateſt part of your buſines is diſpatcht already; and praiſe you his Diuine Maieſtie for the ſame, and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fide very fully in his goodnes; for he neuer yet failed his friends. Shut-vp the eyes of your Minde, from conſidering, why he giues ſenſible deuo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion to another, in ſo few dayes; and not to me, in ſo manie yeares. Let vs belieue, and know, that all this, is done by him, for our greater good; and let his Diuine Maieſtie conduct vs, by what way he will; for now, we are no longer our owne, but his; and he doth vs Fauour enough, in permitting vs, to digg in his Garden, and to ſuffer vs to be ſo neer the Lord thereof. For it is certaine, that he remaines with vs; and whether he be pleaſed, that the Plants, and Flowers, of his Garden, may grow, or not grow, either more or leſſe, what is that to the purpoſe? Doe thou
<pb n="131" facs="tcp:100776:102"/>
diſpoſe ſo, of things, O Lord, as ſhall pleaſe thee beſt; and let me, only, not offend thee; nor let my vertues be loſt, if thou haue giuen me anie. I am reſolued, O Lord, to ſuffer, ſince thou wouldſt ſuffer; and thy Will, be accompliſhed in me, in all kindes; and let not thy Diuine Maieſtie be pleaſed, that a thing of ſo high value, as thy Loue, may euer be giuen to anie ſuch people, as will not ſerue thee, but only for delights, and guſts.</p>
            <p>It is heer to be noted much, (and I ſpeake it, becauſe I know the truth of it, by experience) that the Soule, which beginnes to walke in this way of Mentall Prayer, with firme purpoſe, &amp; can bring her ſelf once, to a finall reſolution, neither to be comforted, nor diſcomforted greatly, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe our Lord doth either giue, or not giue theſe ſpirituall guſts, or tendernes of deuotion, hath already paſſed through a very great part of his way. And let him not once thinke of turning back, how much ſoeuer he may faulter, or ſtu<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ble; for, his Building is layd, and grounded, vpon a firme Foundation.</p>
            <p>So that, the true Loue of God, conſiſts not, in hauing teares, or tendernes, or Spirituall guſts, which we are wont, for the moſt part, to deſire, and to take comfort in; but to ſerue his Diuine Maieſtie, with <note n="*" place="margin">Marke vvell theſe maſcu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>line, and maſſye vvords.</note> Iuſtice, and Fortitude, and Humilitie. For, in that other courſe, me thinkes, we are rather on the taking hand, then on the giuing, anie thing of our owne. As for poore,
<pb n="132" facs="tcp:100776:103"/>
weake, ſillie woemen, and who are of little cou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rage, like me, me thinks I could find it fitt, that our Lord, ſhould carrie them on, with Regalo; that ſo, they might be the better induced, to ſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fer thoſe afflictions, which it hath pleaſed his Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uine Maieſtie, that they ſhould beare. But, for the true Seruants of God; men of Subſtance, and ſolid wayes; men of Learning, and Vnderſtanding, to make ſo much reflection, vpon God's not giue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing them tendernes of Deuotion, as, I ſee, they doe, I confeſſe, it giues me diſguſt, euen to heare it. I ſay not, but that they ſhould receaue theſe Spirituall delights, when God giues them; yea, and that they ſhould eſteem them very much; becauſe, in that caſe, his Diuine Maieſtie, will haue ſeen, that they were conuenient for them; but only, that, when they haue them not, they ſhould not vex themſelues; and that they ſhould alſo vnderſtand, that, when God giues them not, they are not conuenient for them; but that they ought to be, and remaine the Lords of themſelues, in all things. Let them belieue, that this is a defect, and fault, in them; for I haue ſeen, and tryed it. Let them belieue, that this is an imperfection; and that it is not, to walke on, with Libertie of Spirit, but rather like weake, and cowardlie people, who dare not ſet vpon difficulties. And I ſay not this, ſo much for them, who are but beginners; (though yet I preſſe it ſo farr, becauſe it imports very much, that they beginne with this Libertie of Spirit, and reſolution) but euen
<pb n="133" facs="tcp:100776:103"/>
for others alſo. For, there are manie, who haue already begunne, and yet, who neuer, in fine, reſolue vpon doing heerin, home, what they ought; and I belieue, that this proceeds, in great part, from their not reſoluing to take vp, and carrie this Croſſe, from the verie beginning. For, ſuch ſhall goe on, ſtill afflicted, as conceauing, that all that, is nothing, which they doe; becauſe when the Vnderſtanding giues-ouer to worke, and act, they vſe not to be able to endure it; and yet, perhaps, they will grow euen fatt, and ſtrong, at the verie ſelf ſame time, though themſelues vnderſtand it not, to be ſo.</p>
            <p>We are to thinke, and know, that our Lord doth not conſider, and care for theſe things; for, howſoeuer our ſelues may thinke, that they are faults, yet they are not ſo, indeed; and his Diuine Maieſtie knowes our miſerie, and baſe condition, much better, then our ſelues; and conſiders, that theſe Soules deſire to be thinking alwaies, vpon him; and that they deſire, to loue him. And this is that firme purpoſe, which he values, and expects at our hands. But, that other, is but an affliction, which we bring vpon our ſelues; for it ſerues but to diſquiet the Soule, and to giue occa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion, that, if before, it were vnable, to take anie benefit, by ſeruing God, for one hower, it may now be ſo, for fowre. And, manie times (for I haue very great experience of this caſe, and know it to be true, becauſe I haue both conſidered it with care, and haue alſo treated about it, with Spirituall
<pb n="134" facs="tcp:100776:104"/>
perſons) this growes, euen from our corporall indiſpoſition; for we are ſo very totally infirme, that this poore, little, wretched Soule of ours, parti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cipates in the miſeries of the Bodie; and euen the alteration of the weather, and the reuolution of their owne naturall humours, are, many times, the occaſion, why, (without euen anie fault of their owne,) they cannot well doe, euen what they would, but are faine to ſuffer thus, in all kindes. And, when they ſtriue to force themſelues, in theſe coniunctures of time, it proues to be ſo much the worſe with them; and the inconue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nience will laſt, ſo much the longer. But, diſcre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion muſt be vſed heerin, to weigh, when this Effect proceeds from this Cauſe; and they muſt not oppreſs, and ſtifle this poore Soule, but vnder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtand, and conſider, that it is ſick. Let the hower of Prayer, in God's name, be changed; yea, and manie times it will be fitt, to doe ſo, for ſome dayes; and let them paſſe through this ban<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſhment of theirs, as well as they can; ſince it is misfortune, and miſerie enough, for a Soule, which doth indeed, loue Almightie God, to ſee, that ſhe liues in ſo great miſerie; and that ſhe is no way able to doe, euen what her ſelf deſires, in regard, that ſhe is lodged, with ſo vntoward, and ill an Hoſt, as this Bodie is.</p>
            <p>I ſayd, this was to be done, with diſcretion; be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe ſometimes, the Diuel will be a cauſe of theſe things; and therefore it is good, neither alwaies to leaue the vſuall &amp; ſet time of Prayer, whenſoeuer
<pb n="135" facs="tcp:100776:104"/>
there may be great diſturbance, and diſtraction, in the Vnderſtanding; nor yet alwaies, to ſtand tormenting the Soule, towards the making it doe more, then it can. There are alſo other exteriour workes of Charitie, &amp; of reading alſo, which may be vſed; though yet ſometimes, the Soule will not be ſo much as fitt, euen for that; but, in that caſe, let the Minde be euen ſubiect, as it were, to the Bodie, for the loue of Almighty God, ſince, manie other times, the Bodie ſerues the Soule; and let the Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie, in ſuch caſes, take the entertainment, and paſtime of conuerſation, with others, ſo that it be holie; or diuert himſelf, with going a little abroad, to take the Ayre; as the Ghoſtlie Father ſhall ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uiſe. For, Experience is a great Schoole-Miſtris, in all things, towards the giuing anie one to vnder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtand, what may be fitt; and, Almightie God is ſerued, in all this buſines; for, his Yoake is ſweet; and it is a thing of much importance, that the Soule be not ſeruilely dragged, (as one may ſay) but that it be carried ſweetly on, towards the receauing of more benefit, and profit.</p>
            <p>So that I aduiſe, againe, and againe, (for though I ſay it often, it will doe no hurt, becauſe the matter imports ſo much) that no bodie is to af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flict, nor oppreſs himſelf, either through dryneſſes, or diſquiets, or diſtraction of thoughts; nor yet to goe, vp, and downe, with anie ſuch kind of tribu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lation, if they pretend to gaine Libertie of Spirit. But let him once beginne, not to be in ſuch a fright, vpon the ſight of the Croſſe; and he ſhall
<pb n="136" facs="tcp:100776:105"/>
ſee, how our Bleſſed Lord will help him to beare it; and what contentment he will grow to haue; and how he will be able, to make his profit of all things. For, already, we may ſufficiently perceaue, that, if there be no Spring of Water in the Well, we know not, how to put anie there. True it is, that we muſt, by no meanes, be negligent, and careleſs, but endeauour to draw it out, if there be anie; becauſe then, our Lord is pleaſed to multiply our vertues, by that meanes.</p>

            <p>THat, which I pretended to giue to be vnder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtood, in the laſt Chapter (though yet I di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uerted my ſelf much, vpon other things, in regard, that I thought them very neceſſarie) was, to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clare, how much we might be able, to acquire; and how, in this Firſt part of our deuotions, we might, to ſome proportion, help our ſelues; becauſe the conſidering, and ruminating vpon that, which our
<pb n="137" facs="tcp:100776:105"/>
Lord ſuffered for vs, is wont to moue vs to com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>paſſion; and the ſorrow, and teares, which grow from thence, is a very ſauourie, and delightfull kind of thing. And ſo, to thinke of the Glorie, for which we hope, and of the Loue, which our Lord bore vs; as alſo of his Reſurrection; moues vs to ioy, which is neither wholy Spirituall, nor wholy Senſuall; but this is a vertuous kind of ioy, on the one ſide, as, on the other, that former paine, is very meritorious; And of this ſort, are all thoſe things, which cauſe anie ſuch deuotion, as is ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quired in part, by the Vnderſtanding; though yet there be no merit, nor gaine therein, vnleſſe Al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mightie God be pleaſed to giue it.</p>
            <p>But now, it will be very fitt, for a Soule, which our Lord hath not raiſed anie higher, not to pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cure to exalt her ſelf; and let this be very well noted; for, the contrarie courſe will help her to nothing, but loſſe. In this Degree, or State, ſhe may performe manie good acts, by way of reſoluing to doe great things for Almighty God; and to awake, and ſtirr-vp her loue, and others alſo, by way of aſſiſting her ſelf, to grow-vp in ſeuerall ver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tues; according to what is contained in a certaine Booke, called, <hi>The Art of ſeruing God;</hi> which is a very good one, and very proper for ſuch as finde themſelues in this State; becauſe the Vnderſtan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding doth act, and exerciſe it ſelf, heer. She may alſo repreſent her ſelf, as in the preſence of Chriſt our Lord; and accuſtome her ſelf, to be greatly enamoured, with his moſt Sacred Humanitie; and
<pb n="138" facs="tcp:100776:106"/>
to be euer carrying that, along in her companie; and to be often ſpeaking to it; and to beg his continuall aſſiſtance, in all her neceſſities; and euen to complaine to him, of her afflictions; and to ioy with him, for her contentments, and guſts; but yet, not to forget him, vpon occaſion thereof; And all this, without procuring to expreſſe her ſelf, in anie ſett kind of Prayers, but to make vſe of ſuch words alone, as may haue conformitie with her owne neceſſities, and deſires.</p>
            <p>This is an <note n="*" place="margin">Note.</note> excellent way of finding profit, and that in a very ſhort time; and, whoſoeuer ſhall earneſtly labour, to carrie this pretious companie with himſelf, and ſhall haue proceeded well therein, and ſhall haue found the way of louing, in very good earneſt, this Lord of ours, to whome we owe ſo much, I will giue, and paſſe my word, that this perſon, is a very good Profi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cient. For this purpoſe, let it not trouble vs a whitt, not to finde our ſelues with ſenſible deuo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, as I haue ſayd; but let vs giue thankes to our Lord, for giuing vs ſo good deſires, to pleaſe him, though our workes be weake.</p>
            <p>This way of carrying Chriſt our Lord in our companie, is very vſefull in all the Fowre States, and Degrees of Prayer. It is a moſt ſecure, and ſafe meanes, to goe profiting in the Firſt Degree; and that we ſhall gett quickly, to the Second; and then to be free alſo, in the two laſt, from thoſe dangers, which the Diuel may prouide for vs. For, this, in fine, is that, which we may be able to
<pb n="139" facs="tcp:100776:106"/>
doe; and for anie bodie to paſſe-vp from hence, and to exalt his Spirit, towards the feeling of certaine guſts, which are not allowed him, is but, in my opinion, to looſe, both the one, and the other; becauſe, in fine, that, is all Supernaturall; and ſo, the Vnderſtanding being at a Stand, and loſt, the Soule remaines all deſolate, and with great drynes. And, ſince this whole Building is grounded vpon Humilitie, the neerer we grow to Almightie God, the more ſhall we proceed, and profit, in this Vertue; and if we doe not this, all is loſt. And it ſeemes to be no better, then a kind of pride, if we deſire to get-vp to a higher ranke, ſince God doth vs but too much honour, and fauour (conſidering, how vnworthie we are) in ſuffering vs, to be ſo neer, to himſelf.</p>
            <p>But now, it muſt not be ſo vnderſtood, as if I ſpoke all this, againſt raiſing-vp our thoughts, to conſider the high things of Heauen, or of God, or of the greatneſſes, which are there aboue; as alſo of his Incomparable Wiſdome. For though I neuer did this, becauſe I had no abilitie for this purpoſe, (as I haue ſayd) and I found my ſelf ſo miſerable, and ſo meane, that God did me parti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cular fauour, to enable me, to thinke of earthlie things, by meanes whereof, I might come after<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward to vnderſtand this truth; (for euen this, was no ſmall aduenture for me; and how much more was it ſo, to conſider Celeſtiall things) yet others may take benefit heerby; and eſpecially, if they haue Learning, and Knowledge, which is, in my
<pb n="140" facs="tcp:100776:107"/>
opinion, a great treaſure, towards this exerciſe of Prayer, if it be accompanied with Humilitie. I haue ſeen the truth of this, very lately, by occaſion of ſome learned men, who begunne not long agoe, and yet haue proceeded, and profited very much; which makes me haue an earneſt, and euen a kind of impatient deſire, that manie ſuch, as are learned, would grow to be very Spirituall men, whereof I ſhall giue the reaſon heerafter.</p>
            <p>But now, that which I haue ſayd, Namely, That men muſt not exalt themſelues, to riſe higher, then God doth raiſe them, is a certaine kinde of Language of Spirit; and he will vnder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtand me, who hath experience of it; but as for me, I know not, how to expreſſe it, if he know not, how to vnderſtand me, by what I haue ſayd.</p>
            <p>In Myſticall Theologie (whereof I beganne to ſpeake) the Vnderſtanding ceaſes from working, becauſe Almightie God <note n="*" place="margin">This ſuſpen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding of the Thought or Vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtanding, of vvhich the Saint ſpeakes, is a preſenting a multitude of Supernaturall, and Diuine Obiects before it; together vvith a copious infuſion of Light, vvich is decerned by it, after a kind of intui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiue vvay at once, vvithout diſcourſe, or trouble: And this Light rests not there, but paſſes-on to the VVill, and grovves to be, as ſo much Fyre, for the inflameing it, in the Loue of our Lord. And the Soule doth more properly ſuffer heer, then act. And novv the Saint giues great vvarning, that people be not ſo foolish, as to offer at theſe things, of them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelues.</note> ſuſpends it; as I will de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clare heerafter, if I be able, and if he giue me grace, for that purpoſe. But as for vs, to preſume, yea, or ſo much as to thinke of ſuſpending it, is that, which I am ſaying, we ſhould not doe. Nor
<pb n="141" facs="tcp:100776:107"/>
muſt we leaue to act, and worke thereby, and therewith; for if we doe, we ſhall be ſtupid, and ſottiſh, and cold; and we ſhall effect, neither the one, nor the other. But when our Lord ſuſpends, and ſtopps it, he furniſhes it with matter, vpon which, the Partie may employ himſelf, and at which, he may be amazed; and he makes him vnderſtand more, in the time, and ſpace of ſaying one Credo, (though yet ſtill, not by way of Diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>courſe) then we could tell, how to vnderſtand, with all our humane diligences of this world, in the compaſſe of manie yeares. But now, to exer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciſe, and employ the Powers of the Minde, and yet, the while, to thinke of making them ſtand at a ſtay, is a ſenſles kind of fancie, and foole<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rie. And I ſay, and ſay againe (though perhaps, it be not well vnderſtood) that this, is no act of anie great Humilitie; and though it ſhould not be guiltie of being a fault, yet it will not faile to be ſubiect, to the puniſhment; for at leaſt, it will be all labour loſt; and the Soule findes it ſelf to remaine with an odd little kinde of diſguſt; as when a man goes to leape, when yet men hold him faſt, by the back. For ſuch an one ſeemes already, to haue employed all his ſtrength, to doe ſomewhat which he deſired, and yet findes him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf, without effecting, what he pretended. And ſo, whoſoeuer will conſider the matter well, ſhall come to diſcerne, by the slender gaine, which he made, this little half inuiſible duſt of the want of Humilitie, whereof I ſpake. For, in fine, this
<pb n="142" facs="tcp:100776:108"/>
vertue hath that excellencie, amongſt others, in it, That there is no worke, or action, in the world, if it be accompanied with that vertue, which will euer leaue the Soule, in diſguſt. There were di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uers <note place="margin">A great truth.</note> yeares, when I was wont to reade manie things, and yet vnderſtood none of them all; and there was, afterward alſo, a long time, when, though God gaue me abilitie to vnderſtand, yet could I not ſpeake a word, wherewith to make it be vnderſtood, by others; and this point coſt me no ſmall labour. But, when his Diuine Maieſtie hath a minde to teach it, he doth it ſo, &amp; all at an inſtant, that I am amazed. And one thing I can ſay with much truth, that though I ſpake with manie Spirituall perſons, who had a minde to make me vnderſtand, what our Lord imparted to me, that ſo, I might the better declare things, in particular, and cleare manner, to them; it is certaine, that my dulnes was ſo great, as that their diſcourſe was not of anie vſe to me, at all. And perhaps our Bleſſed Lord (as his Diuine Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ieſtie vouchſafed ſtill, to be my Maſter; &amp; let him be bleſſed for euer, ſince it is confuſion enough for me, to be able to ſay thus much, with truth) was pleaſed, that I ſhould haue no bodie, to thanke for it, but himſelf; and that, without my deſiring, or euen wiſhing it, (for in this, I was not a whitt curious, wherein it might haue been a vertue, to be ſo; but I was ſo, about the vanities of the world) he would giue me to vnderſtand, and comprehend it, with all claritie; yea and ſo,
<pb n="143" facs="tcp:100776:108"/>
as that I could vnfold it alſo, to others; in ſuch ſort, as that men were amazed at it; and my ſelf more, then anie of my Ghoſtlie Fathers; becauſe I vnderſtood mine owne dulnes, better then they. Nor is it anie long time, ſince this hapned to me; and ſo I procure not to know thoſe things, which our Lord hath not taught me, but I only con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſider, and take care of them, ſo farre, as whereby my Conſcience may be concerned.</p>
            <p>I returne yet once againe, to aduiſe, and declare, that it will import vs very much, not to <note n="*" place="margin">A dange<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rous, &amp; provvd, foolish errour.</note> ele<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uate, and raiſe our Spirit, vnleſſe our Lord be pleaſed to eleuate, and raiſe it; which if he doe, it will inſtantly be vnderſtood; and eſpecially, this is more dangerous for woemen; for, the Diuel may bring ſome illuſion vpon them; though yet withall, I hold it for very certaine, that our Lord will not permitt, that the Diuel ſhould be able to hurt anie ſuch perſon, as ſhall procure to approach his Diuine Maieſtie with Humilitie; but rather that he ſhall be able, to giue himſelf more aduan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tage, and profit, by that, whereby the Diuel meant to deſtroy him. But now, in regard, that this way of beginners, in the exerciſe of Mentall Prayer, is more beaten, and becauſe the admonitions, which I haue giuen, import much, I haue enlar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ged my ſelf, thus farr; though yet, others will certainly haue written much better of it. But thus much doe I confeſſe; and I haue expreſſed my ſelf heerin, with abundance of confuſion, and ſhame, though yet ſtill, not with ſo much,
<pb n="144" facs="tcp:100776:109"/>
as I ought to haue had. Let our Lord be euer Bleſſed for all, ſince he permits, and is pleaſed, that ſo miſerable a Creature, as I, ſhould ſpeake of things, belonging to his Diuine Maieſtie; and thoſe things, ſuch, and ſo high.</p>

               <p>She proceeds in this Firſt Degree, and State of Prayer; and giues aduiſe against ſome temptations, vvhich the Diuel is ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times vvont to bring. This Diſcourſe is very profitable.</p>
            </argument>
            <p>I Haue thought fitt, to ſpeake heer, of certaine temptations, which I haue found, to be brought againſt ſome, in their beginning, to vſe Mentall Prayer; and ſome I haue felt my ſelf; and I will alſo giue ſome aduiſe, which I hold to be neceſſarie, heerin. Let therefore a <note n="*" place="margin">Obſerue the gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rous vvay of this great Saint.</note> beginner pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cure, to goe-on with great alacritie, and Libertie of Spirit; for, there be ſome, who are apt to thinke, that all their deuotion is inſtantly to vaniſh, if they doe neuer ſo little amiſſe, therein. It is true, that it will be very fitt, to continue in a holie doubt, and feare, of themſelues, that ſo they may not be confident at all, to put themſelues into anie occaſion, wherein our Lord is wont to be offended; for it will euer be very neceſſarie, to vſe this actual diligence, till one be very entire, in
<pb n="145" facs="tcp:100776:109"/>
the poſſeſſion of vertue; and there are not manie, who may be ſo very confident of themſelues, as that, in ſuch occaſions, which haue <note n="*" place="margin">Note this very vvell.</note> con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formitie with their naturall diſpoſition, and incli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nation, they may be out of care, and feare. And, in fine, it will euer be fitt, that ſo long, as we ſhall liue, in this world, we conſider our miſerable na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture; though it were but euen for the continuall exerciſe of humilitie; but there are manie times, when it is permitted, as I haue ſayd, to be taking recreation, though it were but to enable vs the better, to returne the more encouraged, and for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tifyed, towards the making of Prayer. In all things, it will euer be needfull, to vſe diſcretion; and withall, to haue great confidence, in God; for it is, by no meanes, fitt, to goe leſſning, &amp; diminiſhing our deſires, but to belieue of Almightie God, that, if we will endeauour earneſtly; by little and little, we may, by the fauour of his Diuine Maieſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie, ariue, though it be not preſently, where manie Saints haue ariued; who, if they had neuer re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolued to aſpire to Perfection, and had not alſo endeauoured, by little and little, to acquire it, would neuer haue been able, to obtaine ſo high a State. His Diuine Maieſtie, is a very great friend, and fauourer of <note n="*" place="margin">A great praiſe of a large hart.</note> couragious Soules; ſo that withall, they proceed with Humilitie, &amp; not with anie confidence, in themſelues; and I haue yet neuer ſeen anie one of this kinde, who hath con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinued to remaine in a very inferiour degree, in this way; nor neuer alſo, anie one cowardlie Soule
<pb n="146" facs="tcp:100776:110"/>
(though yet withall, it had the ſafegarde of Hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>militie) which was able to make ſo much way, in manie yeares, as I haue found thoſe others doe, in very few. I am euen amazed, when I conſider, how much it workes in this kinde, for one to animate himſelf, towards the doing of great things; though inſtantly he may, perhaps, not haue force, where with to performe. For, the Soule puts herſelf to make a Flight, and ariues to be, in a high place, though yet, like ſome young Bird, ſhe be not ſo well feathered yet; and therefore, as being wearie, ſhe can but pauſe, and houer. In former time, I often remembred, and conſidered, what S. Paul affirmes of himſelf, Namely, <hi>That he could doe all things, in God, vvho comforted him;</hi> for, as for me, I knew well, that I could doe nothing of my ſelf. But, that Saying of his, did me very much good; &amp; ſo alſo, did this other of S. Auguſtin: <hi>Giue me, O Lord, vvhat thou commandeſt; and then command me, vvhat thou vvilt.</hi> And, for my part, I thought alſo manie times, that S. Peter had loſt nothing by the bar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gaine, when he caſt himſelfe headlo<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>g into the Sea though yet he were afrayd, afterward. In a word, theſe firſt ſtrong purpoſes, and reſolutions, are a great matter, though yet, in this Firſt Degree, and State, it is fitt, that we goe detaining our ſelues, and hold our ſelues faſt tyed, to the diſcretion, and diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſing of a Directour; but then, we muſt procure, that he may be ſuch an one, as will not teach vs, to leape heauily, and dully, like certaine Toades; nor be content, that our Soules diſpoſe themſelues, to
<pb n="147" facs="tcp:100776:110"/>
hunt, thoſe little weake beaſts, called Lizards; Only Humilitie muſt euer goe before, that ſo we may beſure to vnderſtand, that this ſtrength doth not grow from our ſelues.</p>
            <p>But heer, it will be neceſſarie for vs, to know, what kinde of Humilitie, this of ours, muſt be; and I am very apt to thinke, that the Diuel does much hurt, towards the making ſuch, as exerciſe Prayer, not to aduance themſelues very much, in their way, by cauſing them to miſ-vnderſtand Humilitie; and by procuring to make vs belieue, that it is but a kinde of pride, to haue Heroicall deſires; and to pretend, to imitate Saints; and to deſire, to be Martyrs. For, vpon this, he tells vs, and makes vs thinke, that the actions of Saints, are fitt to be admired, but not to be imitated, by vs, who are Sinners. This doe I alſo ſay, as well as he; only we muſt conſider, what, in particular, is fitt for <note n="*" place="margin">Hovv Saynts are to be imitated; &amp; hovv, admired.</note> admiration; and what, for imitation. For it would be no way conuenient, that a perſon, who were ſick, and weake, ſhould put himſelf, vpon great Faſts, and ſharp Pennances; or ſhould betake himſelf to the Wildernes, where he might neither be able to ſleep, nor yet could get, what to eate; or the like. But yet, we ought to thinke, that we may well endeauour earneſtly, by God's Fauour, to hold the world, in great contempt; and not to eſteem earthlie honour; and not to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maine tyed-vp to the care of riches. But we really, haue harts ſo very poore, and ſtraight, that it ſeemes to vs, as if we could not haue ground
<pb n="148" facs="tcp:100776:111"/>
enough, to goe vpon, if once we ſhould lay the care of our Bodie, neuer ſo little aſide, to giue it, to the Soule.</p>
            <p>It ſeemes therefore heer already, that, euen for the better enioying of Recollection, it will be good, that we be in no want of neceſſarie things; for, anie kinde of care, will be able to diſquiet men, in Prayer. And I am hartily ſorry, that we ſhould haue ſo little confidence in God, and ſo much loue of our ſelues, as that we ſhould be diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quieted, by this thought. But the truth is, that, whereſoeuer men haue made ſo ſmall progreſſe, as this, in the way of Spirit, certaine fooleries, will trouble ſome, as much, as greater, and more ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtantiall matters, will doe others; and yet ſtill (in our way of vnderſtanding) we will needs preſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>me our ſelues, to be Spirituall perſons. It ſeemes to me, that this kinde of way of proceeding, ſhewes a deſire in them, to put the Bodie, and Minde, into ſuch a concurrence, and correſpondence, as that we would faine finde meanes, to take our eaſe in this world, and yet enioy God, in the next; and that conceipt will proue to be true, if we liue ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to Iuſtice, and continue, to ſtick cloſe to Vertue; but yet ſtill, this is but the pace of a Henn, and it will neuer be able to bring vs on, to enioy true Libertie of Spirit. This ſeemes, indeed, to be a good way of proceeding, for ſuch as are in ſtate of Marriage, who are to carrie them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelues, according to their Vocation; but for anie other ſtate, then that, I doe, by no meanes, deſire,
<pb n="149" facs="tcp:100776:111"/>
anie ſuch kinde of profiting in Spirit, as this; nor ſhall they euer make me beleiue, that it is a good one; for I haue tryed it, long enough; and I had euer continued, in that way, if our Lord, through his infinit goodnes, had not ſhewed me another, and a ſhorter cutt; though yet withall, it be true, that I had euer great deſires; but I procured (as I haue ſayd) to vſe Prayer; though yet ſtill, to liue withall, at my pleaſure. But really, I conceaue, that if anie bodie would haue encouraged me, to flye a higher pitch, I ſhould haue ſtriuen hard, to make thoſe deſires, proue deeds. But alas, it is true, that through our Sinnes, there are ſo very few, and may ſo quickly be counted, who haue anie more diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cretion, then is neceſſarie, for ſuch occurrences, as theſe, that, I belieue, it is a great part of the cauſe, why ſuch, as are beginners, can get no faſter on, towards great perfection; for, our Lord doth neuer faile, on his part; but it is we, who are ſtill the faultie, and miſerable Creatures.</p>
            <p>They may alſo be able, to imitate the Saints; in procuring to vſe Solitude, and keep Silence; and to exerciſe manie other vertues, which, will yet, by no meanes, murder this miſerable Bodie, which they deſire to preſerue, with ſuch curioſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie, &amp; care, though it ſhould turne to the diſorder of the Soule. And now, the Diuel is carefull enough, to helpe to render vs the more vnable; for, when he ſees but a little inordinate feare, he de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſires no more, then to make vs apprehend, that euerie thing, will be apt to kill vs; or at leaſt, to
<pb n="150" facs="tcp:100776:112"/>
depriue vs of our health; yea and if we be accuſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tomed to haue teares, he will put vs into a feare, that we ſhall be blinde. My ſelf haue paſſed by this Walke, &amp; therefore I know it; and I know with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>all, that I cannot tell, what better kinde of life, or health, we can poſſibly deſire, then to looſe them both, vpon ſuch an occaſion. My ſelf, being ſo ſicklie as I was, till I reſolued to make no account at all, of my health, and of my bodie, was euer tyed vp, and was good for nothing; and euen now, it is very little, which I can doe. But yet, as ſoone as our Lord was pleaſed, that I ſhould vnderſtand this deceipt, and trick of the Diuel, if he obiected to me, my loſſe of health, I told him, it imported little, that I muſt dye; If he tempted me with loue of reſt, and eaſe, I told him, that it was not eaſe which I needed now, but the ſufferance of a Croſſe; And ſo alſo, in other things. For I ſaw clearly, that, in very manie, it was either a tempta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of the Diuel, or mine owne lazines; though yet, in verie deed, I be ſicklie enough. But how<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſoeuer, I now enioy much better health, ſince I am not ſo very curious, and daintie, as I was, then I did before. And it is therefore of great importa<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ce, for them, who beginne to hold Mentall Prayer, that they doe not ſubtilize too much, with their thoughts. And let them belieue me heerin; for I know it by experience; and perhaps it may be of good vſe, for me, to recount my faults, that ſo, others may take warning by me.</p>
            <p>There is alſo another temptation, and it is very
<pb n="151" facs="tcp:100776:112"/>
vſuall; To deſire, forſooth, that euerie bodie might grow to be very Spirituall, when once themſelues beginne, to taſt of this great Quiet; &amp; how much, is to be gained by this meanes. It is not an ill thing, to deſire it; but to procure it, may peraduenture not be good; vnleſſe much diſcretion, and, as it were, diſſimulation, be vſed, in doing it ſo, as that they ſeem not, to take vpon them, to teach; for, ſuch as will procure to doe good, vpon their neighbours, in ſuch caſes as this, had need haue their owne vertues very ſtrong; leaſt els, they breed temptation for others. It hapned iuſt thus to me, and therefore I vnderſtand it; that when (as I was ſaying) I procured, that others might vſe Mentall Prayer, and on the one ſide, they heard me ſpeake of high matters, and of the great benefit, which it brought, to vſe that exerciſe; and when they ſaw, on the other, how very poore I was, in point of vertue, I occaſioned them to be tempted, and diſordered; and they were ſo, with reaſon enough; and themſelues told me as much, after<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward. For they knew not, how it was poſſible, for one of thoſe things, to be compatible with the other; and it cauſed them not to thinke that, to be ill, which yet, indeed, was ſo; becauſe, forſooth, they ſaw me doe it ſometimes, when they held a good opinion of me. And this doth the Diuel effect, who, it ſeemes, can ſerue his turne, euen of the vertues, which we haue; that ſo, he may, the better, grow to authorize the miſcheif, which he deſires to doe vs; and how little ſoeuer that be, in
<pb n="152" facs="tcp:100776:113"/>
it ſelf, yet when that is done, in a Communitie, he gaines very much, by the bargaine; and how much more, when that, which I did ill, was very ill. And ſo, in manie yeares, there were only three perſons, who tooke benefit, by what I told them; and, when our Lord was already pleaſed, to be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtow more ſtrength of vertue vpon me, they were manie, who profited by me, euen in two or three yeares; as I will ſhew afterward.</p>
            <p>Beſides, there is this other great inconuenience, that the Soule looſes her progreſſe in vertue; for the cheif thing, which ſhe is to procure at firſt, is only to take care of her ſelfe alone; and to make account, that there is not, in the whole world, anie one thing, but God, and She. And this is a certaine point, which imports the ſame Soule, very much.</p>
            <p>There is alſo yet another temptation (and all, ſuch as this, ſhew themſelues euer, with a kinde of zeale of vertue; and they are fitt to be vnderſtood; and that we walke with much circumſpection) and this is a trouble, which men receiue, from the defects, and faults, which they diſcerne, in others. For, the Diuel procures to make vs belieue, that this greif is entertained by vs, but only, becauſe we would nor haue them offend Almightie God; and that forſooth, we are troubled, becauſe his honour is intereſſed thereby; and then it comes preſently in, that we would faine procure to redreſſe it; and this care diſquiets vs ſo much, that it hinders our Prayer; yea and the greateſt miſcheif of all, is, that we thinke, that this is vertue,
<pb n="153" facs="tcp:100776:113"/>
and perfection, and great zeale of God's ſeruice. I ſpeake not of thoſe afflictions, which publique Sinnes muſt giue, when they are vſually com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitted by a Community, or when they grow to be of preiudice to the Church; as theſe Hereſies doe, whereby we finde ſo manie Soules to be loſt; for this is a very good affliction, and trouble; and, in regard, that it is ſo good, it diſorders not, and diſturbs not him, who hath it. But <note n="*" place="margin">Note this vvell.</note> the ſecure way, for that Soule, which deſires to giue it ſelf to Prayer, is to ſeek to forget, both all things, and all perſons; and to attend, to keep all reckonings ſtreight with her ſelf; and ſo, to giue contentment to Almightie God. Now, this is both very conue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nient, and important; and if I ſhould ſtand to tell you, what errours I haue ſeen fall-out to be com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitted, vpon the confidence, which men haue put in their good intentions, I ſhould neuer make an end. Let vs therefore alwaies procure, to conſider the vertues, and good workes, which we ſhall diſcerne in others; and to ſhut our eyes, from ſeeing their defects, by the conſideration of our owne great Sinnes. Now, this is a kinde of work<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, wherein, though we ariue not inſtantly, to doe it with perfection, yet we come thereby, to gaine a great vertue, which is, to hold euerie bodie better, then ourſelues; and we beginne, to get it, through the Fauour of Almightie God, whereof we haue need, in all things. For, whenſoeuer that is wanting to vs, all other diligences, ſerue to little purpoſe; and we muſt therefore humbly pray
<pb n="154" facs="tcp:100776:114"/>
him, to beſtow this grace, vpon vs, wherein cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainly, he will not be wanting, if we be as carefull, as we ought. Let them alſo conſider well of this aduiſe, who vſe to diſcourſe much, with the Vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtanding; and haue power to draw manie con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiderations, and conceipts, out of ſome one. For, as for them, who are not able to worke with this Facultie (as I can not) there is no cauſe of giuing them this aduiſe; but only, that they will be con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tent, to haue patience, till our Lord ſhall be pleaſed, to helpe them to matter, vpon which to worke; and light, where with to know, how to doe it; Since they are able, to performe ſo little, for themſelues, as that their Vnderſtanding part, doth rather giue them trouble, then help.</p>
            <p>But, returning now to ſuch others, as are able to ſerue themſelues of Diſcourſe, they muſt take care, that their whole time, be not ſpent in that; for, howſoeuer it be very meritorious, yet, con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>conſidering how ſauourie a thing, they conceaue, that Mentall Prayer ſhould be, they feare, that they ſhall neuer liue, to ſee Sunday, nor anie Seaſon, wherein they are not to labour, and drudge; and therefore, they preſently thinke, that all their hopes are loſt; though, for my part, I conceaue, that all that Loſſe, is Gaine. But let them, <note n="*" place="margin">A ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſary Aduiſe.</note> as I haue ſayd, repreſent themſelues, as in the preſence of Chriſt our Lord; and, without wearying of the Vnderſtanding, be ſpeaking, and regaling themſelues, with him; and not tire their witts, to finde out, and frame certaine Diſcourſes;
<pb n="155" facs="tcp:100776:114"/>
but let them only preſent their neceſſities, and the reaſon, which he may haue, not ſo much as to endure them, there. Some one of theſe conſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derations will ſerue, at one time; and ſome other, at an other; that ſo the Soule may not be wearie, of feeding alwaies vpon one diſh.</p>
            <p>Theſe particulars, are both very guſtfull, and very profitable alſo, if once the Partie be accuſto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med to feed on them; for they vſe to bring great ſupport, and ſtrength, for the life of the Soule, &amp; manie adua<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>tages alſo, otherwiſe. I will declare my ſelfe further vpon this matter; becauſe all theſe points, concerning Prayer, carrie their dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficulties along with them; and, vnleſſe there be a good Directour, at hand, they are very hard to be vnderſtood. And this is the verie cauſe, why, though I would faine make ſhort, and that iuſtly, (becauſe it would ſuffice for me, but euen to touch them, by reaſon of the great capacitie of him, who commanded me to write theſe particulars, of Prayer,) yet my dulnes, is not able to declare, &amp; explicate, in few words, a thing, which it ſo much imports, to be well vnderſtood. And, becauſe I ſuffered ſo very much, by vſing only Bookes, when I beganne the exerciſe of Prayer, I haue compaſſion of all them, who doe ſo too; for it is no leſſe then ſtrange, to ſee, how farr otherwiſe Bookes are wont to be vnderſtood, then men ſee they ought to haue been, when once they come, to haue had experience of theſe things.</p>
            <p>But now (to returne to what I was ſaying) let
<pb n="156" facs="tcp:100776:115"/>
vs put our ſelues, to conſider ſome paſſage of the Paſſion of our Bleſſed Lord; and, for example, let it be that, when he was tyed to the Pillar. And heer, let the Vnderſtanding ſearch-out the cauſe of thoſe great dolours, and afflictions, which his Diuine Maieſtie felt, in that Solitude of his; as alſo, vpon manie other things, which, (if the Vnder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtanding be good at working; or els, if he haue Learning) he may eaſily be able, to fetch from thence. And this is a manner of Prayer, wherein all Creatures may both beginne, and proceed, and make an end; and it will be a very excellent, and ſecure way, till our Lord, may, perhaps, carrie them on, to other things, which are ſupernaturall. I ſay, for all; though yet there be manie Soules, which profit more, by other Meditations, then by that of the Sacred Paſſion. For, as there are manie Manſions in Heauen, when a Soule is there: ſo are there alſo manie wayes thither. Some, profit more, by conſidering Heauen; and ſome, afflict themſelues beſt, by thinking of Hell; others, by reflecting vpon Death; and ſome, if they be very tender-harted, are too much troub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led, and vexed, if they alwaies goe ruminating vpon the Paſſion; and they regale themſelues better, yea, and they alſo profit more, by conſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dering the Power, and Greatnes of Almightie God, in his Workes; and the Loue, he beares vs; which they finde to be repreſented to them, in all his Creatures. And this is an admirable way of proceeding, though yet ſtill, we muſt neither
<pb n="157" facs="tcp:100776:115"/>
forget, nor forbeare, to conſider the Life, and Paſſion of our Bleſſed Lord, very often; that, in fine, being the verie thing, from which, all our good, both euer did, and euer can ariue to vs.</p>
            <p>He, who is a Beginner, had need be carefull, to conſider very well, what that is, whereby he profits moſt; and to this purpoſe, he will haue great need of a Directour, if he can meet with an experienced man; for if he be not ſo, in good meaſure, he may chance err, by carrying a Soule on, without either vnderſtanding her, himſelf; or els, giuing her to be vnderſtood, by the Partie. For, as the Partie cannot but know, of how great merit it is, for him, to ſubiect himſelf to a Direc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tour: ſo he will not preſume, to depart from that, which the other ſhall direct. I haue mett with certaine Soules, which haue been afflicted, and deiected, and ſtreightned, becauſe he, who had the inſtructing them, wanted experience; and I was hartily ſorrie for them; And ſome alſo I haue ſeen, who knew not, what to doe with themſelues; for they, not vnderſtanding matter of Spirit, afflicted themſelues, both in Bodie, and Soule; and, the while, were ſure enough, not to benefit others. One of them told me once, of a Directour of hers, who would not ſuffer her, in eight yeares togeather, to paſſe on, out of the conſideration of the knowledge of her ſelf; and yet our Lord had her then, in the condition, and degree of Quiet Prayer; but ſo, ſhe was in trou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble enough. And, though it be very true, that this
<pb n="158" facs="tcp:100776:116"/>
point of the <hi>knovvledge of ones ſelf,</hi> is neuer, indeed, to be vtterly giuen ouer; nor is anie Soule in the way of Prayer, to thinke, ſhe hath ſo much of the Gyant in her, as not to vnderſtand, that manie times, ſhe muſt turne Child, and ſuck againe; and this muſt neuer be forgotten; and perhaps, I ſhall alſo ſpeake often of it againe, in regard, that it imports ſo much; becauſe there is no State of Prayer ſo high, wherein it will not be neceſſarie, to turne-againe often, to the beginning. And this point of the knowledge of our ſelues, and of our Sinnes, is the daily <note n="*" place="margin">Our daily Bread.</note> bread, which muſt be eaten, with all the meate (how delicate ſoeuer it may be) of ſuch, as are in this way of Prayer; yea and without this verie bread, they will neuer be able, to ſupport, and ſtrengthen themſelues; yet muſt euen this, be taken, by weight, and meaſure. For, when once a Soule findes her ſelf layd very flatt, and low; and ſees clearly, that ſhe hath no good thing of her owne; and findes her ſelf to be full of confuſion, and ſhame, ſo much as to appeare in the preſence of ſo great a King; and the little, which ſhe is able to pay him, for the very much, which ſhe findes her ſelf, to owe him; what neceſſitie is there, to ſpend ſo very much time, vpon this, without applying our ſelues to ſuch other things, as our Lord may, perhaps, ſet before vs, and which it will not be reaſon for vs, to leaue; ſince his Diuine Maieſtie knowes better, then we, vpon what, it is conuenient for vs to feed.</p>
            <p>

So that it imports vs very much, that the <note n="*" place="margin">A de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcription of a good Directour in matter of Spirit.</note> Directour be well aduiſed, &amp; I meane alſo, that he be of good vnderſtanding, and experien<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ce; and if, with this, he be alſo learned, it will be of mightie importance. But yet ſtill, when all theſe three parts ſhall not chance, to meet togeather, in the ſame man, the two former qualities of theſe three, will fall out, to import more, then the third, becauſe they may eaſily procure to conſult with ſuch as are learned, whenſoeuer they ſhall haue need thereof; but as for Beginners, learned men, if they poſſeſſe not the vſe of Prayer, can be of little profit to them. Yet I ſay not, that they ſhould not treat, and conferr with ſuch men, as are learned; for, as for hauing a Spirit, which ſhould not be firſt ſetled in a way of truth, for my part, I had rather haue it without Prayer. For, Learning is a great matter, ſince it inſtructs vs, who know little; and brings vs light; and when we approach neer to the truths of Holie Scripture, we beginne to doe that, which we ought; but as for ſillie, and fooliſh deuotions, our Lord deliuer vs from them. I will declare my ſelf yet better; for I feare, I put my ſelf vpon too manie things at once, though I euer wanted meanes, to know, how to giue my ſelf to be well vnderſtood, (as I haue ſayd) but vpon the expence of manie words.</p>
            <p>A Religious Woeman, for examples ſake, will beginne to vſe Prayer; and in caſe ſome ſillie kinde of man, direct, and gouerne her, he will, if
<pb n="160" facs="tcp:100776:117"/>
the toy take him in the head, giue her to vnder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtand, that it is better for her, to obey him, then her Superiour; yea, and he will doe it, without anie malice, at all; as conceauing, that he is in the right. And now ſhe being a Religious woeman, will be likelie enough, to thinke, that he ſayes true. And if ſhe be a married woeman, he will tell her, that it is beſt for her, euen when ſhe ought to be about her Houſe-hold buſineſſes, to exerciſe her ſelf in Prayer; though it were to be, to the diſguſt of her huſband. So that, ſhe knowes not, how to diſpoſe of her time, nor of her buſineſſes, in ſuch ſort, as that all may goe, according to reaſon, and truth; becauſe, in fine, that Directour wants light; and not hauing any himſelf, he cannot giue it to others, though he would neuer ſo faine. And though, in order to this end, it ſeem, that there is no great need of Learning; yet as for me, my opinion both is, and euer will be, that all Chriſtians ſhall doe well, to treat with ſuch men, about their Soules, as are well learned; and ſo much the more, ſo much the better; and they, who goe by the way of Prayer, haue yet more need, then others, to meet with ſuch men; and ſo, the more they ſhall be alſo Spirituall, the better will it be for them, ſtill. And let not folkes deceaue themſelues, with ſaying, That, learned men, without the exerciſe of Prayer, are not to the purpoſe, for them, who vſe Prayer; for I haue dealt with manie; and for ſome of theſe latter yeares, I haue endeauoured it the more,
<pb n="161" facs="tcp:100776:117"/>
becauſe then, I found my ſelf in more neceſſitie. But I was euer, much a freind of learned men; for, though ſome of them haue not experience, yet they hate not Spirituall people, nor are not ignorant, what theſe things meane; becauſe they euer find this truth, that there is ſuch a thing, as a good Spirit, by holie Scripture, wherein they are continually verſed. And, as for me, I hold, that a perſon, who exerciſes Prayer, and will treat with learned men, ſhall neuer be deceaued, by illuſions of the Diuel, if he haue not a minde, to deceaue himſelf. For I belieue, that the Diuel is mightily afrayd of Learning, whenſoeuer it is accompanied with Humilitie, and Vertue; for he knowes, that he ſhall be diſcouered, in the end, and that ſo, he ſhall come to looſe, by the bar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gaine.</p>
            <p>And now I haue ſayd thus much, becauſe I know, there are opinions, that learned men, are not fitt, for perſons of Prayer, vnleſſe they be alſo of Spirit. Already I haue ſignifyed, that it would be neceſſarie, to haue a Spirituall Directour; but if he proue not to be learned, the inconuenience will be great; &amp; yet it will be of much help, to treat with learned men, ſo that they be vertuous; for, though they be not Spirituall (as, in this caſe, we vnderſta<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>d Spirituall) they will yet, be able to benefit vs; and God will vouchſafe to enable them, to teach vs; yea, and ſo, may perhaps, by degrees, grow euen to make them alſo become Spirituall; to the end, that they may be able, to inſtruct vs, the better.
<pb n="162" facs="tcp:100776:118"/>
And I ſpeake not this, without ſome tryall; for, the occaſion hath hapned to me, with more, then two. I ſay therefore, that if a Soule reſolue to ren<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der it ſelf, to be entirely ſubiect to the order of anie one Directour, ſhe ſhall err very much, vnleſſe ſhe procure, in particular manner, that he be learned; eſpecially if he be a Religious man of anie Order. Becauſe ſuch an one, is to be ſubiect to his Prelate, or Superiour; and in that caſe, peraduenture, all thoſe three aforeſayd parts, which were ſayd to be ſo neceſſarie, for a Direc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tour, will be wanting to him, which will be no little croſſe to the Partie; beſides, that he may perhaps find himſelf, to haue voluntarily ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitted his Vnderſtanding, to that of another man, who hath no very good one, himſelf. At leaſt, foraſmuch as concernes me, I was neuer able, to bring my ſelf to it; nor indeed, doe I hold it con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uenient.</p>
            <p>But now, if the Partie, of whome we ſpeake, be a Secular perſon, let him bleſſe Almightie God, that himſelf may make choice of that man, to whome he will reſolue to ſubiect himſelf; and let him take care, not to looſe this vertuous libertie. Nay, let him euen ſtay, without anie Directour at all, till he find a fitt one; for, our Lord will not faile to prouide him ſuch an one, if he goe wholy grounded in Humilitie, and with deſire, to make a fitt choice. For my part, I praiſe a fitt Directour very much; and woemen, and ſuch men alſo, as are not learned, were alwaies to giue God infinit
<pb n="163" facs="tcp:100776:118"/>
thankes, for that there are ſome, in the world, who take ſo great paines, and trouble, to obtaine the knowledge of truth; whereof ſuch as be not learned, are ignorant. And it amazes me, manie times, to ſee Religious men, who are learned; and particularly to conſider, with how much trouble, they grew to gaine all that knowledge, which is to bring me ſo much profit, without anie more trouble of mine, then only to aske them the queſtion; and yet, that we ſhould not benefit our ſelues by it. But, let not God permit, that ſtill it ſhould continue, to be ſo. For I ſee them ſubiect, to the troubles, and mortifications of a Religious Life, which are very great; with Pennances; with ill Diet; with hard Lodging; with being ſubiect, in all things, to Obedience; and, in fine, I ſo perceaue, that all is affliction, and all, Croſſe, that really, the thought thereof, doth caſt me ſometimes, into confuſion; and, me thinkes, it muſt be a great miſerie, that anie bodie ſhould looſe ſo important a benefit, by his owne fault. It is poſſible, that ſome of vs, who are free from theſe auſterities, whereof I ſpeake (or at leaſt, if we feed vpon them, we will needs haue them finely dreſſed, after our owne fancie, and ſo will liue, as we liſt ourſelues) conceaue, that, for the making a little more Prayer, we ſhall out-ſtripp them, who yet are ſubiect to ſo great Pennance. Bleſſed be thou, O Lord, who haſt made me ſo vnprofitable, and vn-vſefull; but yet, I praiſe thee, after an extraordinarie manner, in regard, that
<pb n="164" facs="tcp:100776:119"/>
thou awakeſt ſo very manie, who may awake vs. And we ſhould doe well, to make very continuall Prayer, for them, who giue vs light; for, what would become of vs, without them, in the midſt of ſo great tempeſts, as are now in the Church? If ſome men haue been wicked; the good will ſhine the brighter, by their meanes. I beſeech our Lord, to hold them vp, with his hand, that he may help ſuch, as help vs; Amen.</p>
            <p>I haue trauailed farr out of the way, from that, which I was going to ſay; but, all will ſerue the turne, for beginners; to the end, that they may ſo, put themſelues vpon this high way, that it may alſo proue to them, a true way. Returning there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore, to what I ſayd, of <note n="*" place="margin">Note.</note> meditating vpon Chriſt our Lord at the Pillar, it is good to diſcourſe a while, and to thinke, vpon the paine, which he felt there, and why he felt it; and who it is, that felt it; and the Loue wherewith he felt it; yet let not the Partie wearie himſelf, by going about to ſeeke all this, but let him remaine ſtill there, with a calme, and quiet kinde of vnderſtanding. If he can, let him employ himſelf, vpon co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ſidering, who lookes vpon him; and let him accompanie him; and beg of him; and humble himſelf before him; and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gale himſelf with him; and, in fine, let him re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>member, that our Lord deſerued not to be there. Whenſoeuer you ſhall be able to doe this, though it ſhould fall out to be at the verie beginning of your Prayer, you will find great benefit by it; nay, manie benefits are acquired, by this manner
<pb n="165" facs="tcp:100776:119"/>
of Prayer; and, at leaſt, my Soule found it ſo. I know not, whether I hitt right, in declaring my ſelf; but your Reuerence will conſider of that; and I beſeech our Bleſſed Lord, that I may hitt right, in euerlaſtingly pleaſing him;</p>

Now, this way being applyed to Prayer, which is wont to be called Quiet Prayer, is that, whereof now, I will treat.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="166" facs="tcp:100776:120"/>
The Soule doth heer beginne, to recollect, and, as it were, ſhut it ſelf vp. And it touches a little heer, vpon the Supernaturall; becauſe the Powers thereof, can, by no meanes, gaine this, for it ſelf, by all the diligences, which it can poſſibly vſe. It is true, that ſometimes, ſhe may ſeem to haue wearled her ſelf, in going round about the Turne, and to haue laboured hard, with the Vnder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtanding; and ſo to haue filled-vp the little Buc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ketts; but heer, the Water is growne-vp to be higher; and ſo ſhe labours much leſs, then ſhe did, in drawing it out of the Well. I ſay, the Water is growne neerer to her; becauſe Grace giues it ſelf now, to be more clearly knowne, by the Soule. This is a kind of recollecting, and, as it were, a ſhutting-vp of the Powers of the Soule, into her ſelf, that ſo ſhe may be able to enioy the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tentment, which then, ſhe hath, with more guſt. But yet, the vſe of the Faculties, is not loſt, nor doe they ſleep; but only the Will is employed, and poſſeſſed, in ſuch ſort, that it is growne to be captiued, though yet it ſelf know not how; only it giues conſent, that Almightie God may put it in Priſon, as one, who vnderſtands now, very well, how to let it ſelf be made Priſoner, to whome it loues. O my deare Ieſus, and my Lord! of how much worth, is thy loue to vs, in this caſe, ſince it holds our loue faſt, in ſo ſtrong chaines, that it leaues vs not euen libertie, at that inſtant, to loue anie other thing, then thy ſelf? The other two Faculties, which are the Vnderſtanding, and Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>morie,
<pb n="167" facs="tcp:100776:120"/>
are then aſſiſting the Will; to the end, that they may goe enabling it, to enioy ſo great a good; although now and then, it happen, that, howſoeuer, they be euen thus vnited to the Will, they yet, are apt enough, ſometimes, to diſ-aſſiſt it, much. But in this caſe, let not the Will make any great account of that, but remaine ſtill, in her quietnes, and ioy. For, <note n="*" place="margin">Hovv the VVill is to carry it ſelfe to the other Faculties of the Minde.</note> if ſhe ſhall perſiſt, in re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſoluing to recollect thoſe other Faculties to her<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf, both they, and ſhe, will looſe, by the bargaine. For, they are then, as ſo manie Doues, who co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>tent not themſelues, with the food, or baite, which the Lord of the Doue-Houſe preſents, without their labouring for it; but they goe to ſeek it, in other places; though yet they ſoone grow to finde it ſo bad, that they quickly returne againe; and ſo, come, and goe, to ſee, whether the Will, may be brought to beſtow anie part of that, vpon them, which it enioyes. And, if our Lord pleaſe to caſt them anie food, they ſtay; and if not, they goe againe, to ſeeke it; and all this while, they con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceaue, that they are euen of vſe, and benefit, to the Will it ſelf; though yet ſometimes, both the Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>morie, and Imagination (euen whilſt they haue a deſire, to repreſent that, better to her, which ſhe enioyes) fall out to doe her hurt, in ſtead of good. Let her therefore be content, to carrie her ſelf ſo, towards them, as I shall heer aduiſe; ſince all that, which paſſes heer, is of extreame conſolation, and is obtained with ſo little labour, that Prayer neuer wearies one heer, though it chance to laſt, very
<pb n="168" facs="tcp:100776:121"/>
long; becauſe the Vnderſtanding goes working now, at great leaſure; and walkes, as it were, foot by foot; and brings-vp another manner of quan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>titie of water, then formerly, it drew out of the Well; and the teares, which God giues, in this caſe, come already with very great ioy; which, howſoeuer we feele, yet we procure them not.</p>
            <p>This <note n="*" place="margin">The bleſsings of Quiet Prayer.</note> Water of the Well, which imports the great Bleſſings, and Fauours, which our Bleſſed Lord ſhewes vs heer, makes our vertues encreaſe, incomparably more, then that other of the for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer Degree of Prayer, did; becauſe now, the Soule is already beginning, to get vp away, from her owne miſerie; and already, ſhe growes to be allowed, to haue ſome ſmall notice, euen of the guſts of glorie. And this, I thinke, makes her thriue, and improue ſo much the more; as alſo, becauſe, by this time, ſhe is growne to approach neerer to that vertue, and power, from whence all vertues proceed, which is Almightie God; be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe his Diuine Maieſtie doth not only then, communicate himſelf, to that Soule; but he is alſo pleaſed, that ſhe ſhould find, in what ſort it is, that he communicates himſelf to her. In ariuing once to this place, ſhe inſtantly beginnes to looſe the appetite of all things, concerning this world; and I cannot blame her; for already, ſhe ſees very clearly, that one moment of that guſt, is not to be purchaſed heer; and that no riches, nor domi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nions, nor all the honours, nor delights of this world, are able to giue ſuch contentment, and
<pb n="169" facs="tcp:100776:121"/>
ſatisfaction, as this, though it were but for the twinkling of an eye; becauſe this, is true con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tentment, and ſuch an one, as we really ſee, and find, to content vs indeed. For, as for thoſe others of this world, it may well goe for a wonder, if we can ſo much as tell, euen wherein the content<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of anie thing doth conſiſt. Nor doth there euer faile to be a kind of meaſuring caſt, between the Yea, and the No, in anie of them; but heer, all is in the Affirmatiue, and profeſſes to ſay Yea, as long as it laſts; and the No, comes not in, till afterward; becauſe then, they ſee, that the buſines is growne to be, at an end; and that he cannot recouer it againe; nor knowes, indeed, how to goe about it. For, though he ſhould euen halfe kill himſelfe with doing Pennance, and making much Prayer, and vſe, in fine, all other poſſible diligences; yet will it all ſerue to very little pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe, vnleſſe our Lord vouchſafe to impart it. But, Almightie God is pleaſed heer, for his owne greatnes, that this Soule ſhould now vnderſtand, that his Diuine Maieſtie, vouchſafes to be ſo neer her, that now, there is no need of ſending anie meſſengers to her, but only, that ſhe her ſelf, may ſpeake with him; though yet, not by word of mouth, becauſe then, he is already ſo neer her, that he vnderſtands her (as a man may ſay) euen by the verie leaſt ſtirring of her lipps.</p>
            <p>But now, it may chance ſeem to ſome, to be impertinent for me, to talke after this manner; in regard, the world knowes well enough, that our
<pb n="170" facs="tcp:100776:122"/>
Lord doth euer heare vs, &amp; is euer preſent with vs; and there can be no doubt at all, but that this is true. But yet heer, this Emperour, and Lord of ours, is pleaſed, that we ſhould alſo vnderſtand, that he vnderſtands vs; and what his preſence is able to doe; &amp; what he will particularly beginne to worke in our Soules; and the great, both interiour, and exteriour ſatisfaction, which he imparts; and the mighty difference, which (as I haue ſayd) there is, between this kind of delight, and guſt, and all the other, of this world. For, this ſeemes euen to fill, all thoſe hollow, and voyd places, which our Sinnes had made in our Soules. And this ſo great ſatisfaction, is in the very moſt intimate part thereof; and ſhe knowes not how, nor by what meanes alſo, it comes; nay, manie times, ſhe cannot tell, euen what to doe, nor what to aske, no nor what to wiſh. For, the Soule ſeemes there, to find all good things togeather; and ſhe doth not very well know, euen what ſhe hath found; nor yet, can I tell, how to giue it to be vnderſtood. For there would heer, be need of Learning, for manie purpoſes; and heer, would it come very well in, to giue to vnderſtand, the difference, betwixt Generall, and Particular Helps, or Succours of Grace, whereof manie are ignorant. And our Lord, in this Prayer, is pleaſed, that our Soule ſhould ſee this particular Succour, as it were, with her verie eyes; and manie other things alſo, which may perhaps be ill declared heer, by me; but, ſince vnderſtanding
<pb n="171" facs="tcp:100776:122"/>
perſons are to ſee what I write, and who will know, if it haue anie errour in it (wherein I may eaſily be found faultie enough, through want, both of Learning, &amp; Spirit) I am in the leſſe paine, and care; conſidering, that this goes into the hands of ſuch, as will both vnderſtand it, &amp; will blott alſo anie ſuch thing out, as may haue been ill ſayd.</p>
            <p>Yet I would faine giue this to be vnderſtood, becauſe theſe, are the beginnings; and when our Lord diſpoſes himſelfe firſt, to doe theſe Fauours, the Soule herſelf doth not vnderſtand them; nor doth ſhe know, what to doe, with her ſelf. For, if Almightie God conduct, and guide her, by the way of feare, as he did me, the trouble is very great; vnleſſe there be ſome at hand, who can vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtand her. But then, it is a great guſt for her, to ſee her ſelf well deſcribed, by them; for then, ſhe euidently findes her ſelf to be in that way; and it is alſo of great benefit, to know, what one hath to doe, in anie of theſe States, or Degrees, that ſo, they may goe profiting, on. For my part, I endured much, and loſt a great deale of time, becauſe I did not know, how to carry my ſelfe. And therefore I haue very great compaſſion of thoſe Soules, which find themſelues alone, when they are come thus farre; for though I haue read manie Spirituall Bookes, and though they touch vpon that, which is to the purpoſe, yet fall they very ſhort, in declaring themſelues; and, vnleſſe the Soule be very well exerciſed in Prayer, ſhe ſhall haue enough to doe, to vnderſtand them, though
<pb n="172" facs="tcp:100776:123"/>
they ſeeke to expreſſe themſelues, at large.</p>
            <p>I could very much deſire, that our Lord would doe me the fauour, that I might know, how to ſet downe the effects, which theſe things, that grow already to be Supernaturall, vſe to worke in the Soule; to the end, that it might be vnder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtood, by them, when it is the Spirit of God. I ſay, that it might be vnderſtood; according to what we can thinke, we vnderſtand, in this world; though it will alwaies be very well done, to goe on, with circumſpection, and feare. For though it be indeed of God, yet the Diuel can tell, how to transforme himſelfe ſometimes, into an Angel of Light; and, if a Soule be not well ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>erciſed in Prayer, she will not vnderſtand it well; and indeed, to be exerciſed well enough, to vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtand this point, as it deſerues, the Soule muſt be ariued, to the higheſt Degree of Prayer.</p>
            <p>The little time I haue, will allow mee no great help, for what I am deſigneing; and therefore his Diuine Maieſtie, had need to doe it himſelf; for I muſt be ſtirring, vp, and downe, in the Commu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nitie; &amp; haue manie other buſineſſes to doe; ſince I am, at this preſent, in a Houſe, which is but beginning now, as I ſhall ſhew afterward; and therefore, I am writing this, without anie ſuch reſt, and quiet kind of being, as were conuenient; ſo that I muſt doe it, by little and little, and by fitts. But I could wish, I were now, at more leaſure; for, when our Lord giues a ſpirit, to doe a thing, it is eaſily, and much better ſet downe.
<pb n="173" facs="tcp:100776:123"/>
And it ſeemes to be, as when one hath an Origi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nall, before him; and then he may eaſily take-out the Coppie. But, if the Spirit be wanting, there is no more power, and meanes, to make one word of this language ſuite well with an other, then if (as we may ſay) we would ſuite Spanish, and Turkish togeather, euen though we should haue exerciſed our ſelues, manie yeares, in Prayer; and therefore, me thinkes, it is of very great ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uantage, when I write, if I be then, in ſtate of Prayer; for I ſee clearly, that it is not I, who de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clare it, nor who doe either order it then, with my Vnderſtanding, nor yet know afterward, how I declared it before; and this happens to me, very often.</p>
            <p>But now, let vs goe-back to our Orchard, or Garden, and ſee, how theſe Trees beginne to button, and budd-out towards flowring, that they may afterward yeild fruit; and how theſe Gillie-flowers, and other odoriferous Plants, diſpoſe themſelues, to giue delight full Sent to the Owner. I confeſſe, that this Compariſon regales, and pleaſes me much; for, manie times, in my beginnings (and I humbly beſeech our Lord, that euen yet, I may haue been a beginner, to ſerue his Diuine Maieſtie) I ſay, in thoſe beginnings of that, which I shall ſay afterward, of my Life, it was of much delight to me, to conſider, that my Soule was a Garden, and that our Lord walked in it, vp, and downe; and I humbly pray him, to encreaſe the odour of thoſe little young Flowers
<pb n="174" facs="tcp:100776:124"/>
of Vertue, which shewed, in all apparance, that they would be glad, to find meanes to ſprout; and that alſo, they might ſerue, for his Glorie; and that he would be pleaſed to ſuſtaine them, ſince I deſire nothing for my ſelf; and that he would alſo dreſſe, and prune as manie of them, as he pleaſed; for already, I knew well enough, that they would thriue, and grow the better, after<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward. I ſay, that he would cut, and prune them; in regard, that ſome ſuch times ariue, now, and then, to the Soule, as wherein there is no appa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rance left of this Garden, at all; but then, all ſeemes to be withered, and dry, and that there neuer will come more Water, to ſuſtaine it; yea, and that there alſo ſeemes, to haue neuer been anie vertue, in that Soule. In this caſe, it vndergoes great affliction; becauſe our Lord is pleaſed, that the poore Gardner may co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ceaue, that all that care is loſt, which he had formerly employed, vpon ſuſtaining, and improuing his Garden. But then comes-in the time, of true plucking-vp, and root<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing-out, all thoſe little, paltrie hearbes, which, till then, had remained there, how little ſoeuer they might be; with making vs alſo know, that no diligence of ours will ſerue, if Almightie God take the Water of his Grace, from vs; that ſo, in fine, we may come to hold this poore miſerable Nothing of ours, in no manner of account; yea, and, if the thing were poſſible, euen for leſſe then Nothing. For heer, great Humilitie makes vs the gainers, ſince the Flowers will thus, grow to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flouriſh.</p>

O thou, my Lord, and my God! (for I know not, how to ſay this, without teares, and without a great Regalo, to this poore Soule of mine) is it poſſible, O my Lord, that thou art pleaſed to be thus amongſt vs? Yea, and thou remaineſt in the B. Sacrament, which may well be, with all truth, belieued, becauſe ſo it is; and we may, with much truth, make this Compariſon; and, if it be not through our owne fault, we may enioy our ſelues, togeather with thee; yea, and thou doſt alſo reioyce to be with vs, ſince thou declareſt, <hi>That it is thy delight, to be vvith the Children of men.</hi> O my Lord, what is this? For, whenſoeuer I heare but this word, it is to me, of great conſolation; yea and was ſo, when I found my ſelf in the worſt condition. But is it poſſible, after this, O my deare Lord, that there ſhould be, in the whole world, anie one Soule, which ariuing to receaue ſuch Fauours, and Regalo's at thy hands, and vnder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtanding, that thou reioyceſt ſo highly in her, ſhould yet returne to offend thee, after the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceauing of ſo manie Fauours, and ſo great de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monſtrations of the loue, thou beareſt her; in ſuch ſort, as that they cannot poſſibly be doubted, ſince the effects doe ſo manifeſtly declare it. Yes, yes, it is moſt certaine, that there is ſuch a Soule in the world, which hath offended thee; and that, not once, but often; yea, and I am this verie Soule. And I beſeech thy Diuine Goodnes, O my Lord, that I may haue been, the onlie Creature, who euer committed ſo high a wickednes, and
<pb n="176" facs="tcp:100776:125"/>
who haue been guiltie, of ſuch an exceſſiue in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gratitude againſt thee; though yet already, euen from this verie miſerie of mine, thy infinite good<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nes, hath been able to draw ſome aduantage; yea, and euen by how much the ill hath been greater, the great benignitie of thy Mercies hath ſhined ſo much the more. But now, with how much reaſon, may I reſolue to celebrate them, for all eternitie? I moſt humbly beſeech thee, O my God, that it may be ſo; and that I may ſing praiſes to thee, for euer, ſince now, thou haſt vouchſafed to ſhew thy goodnes ſo highly, and ſo greatly, to me, that ſuch as ſee it, are amazed; and, as for me, they carrie me very often, euen out of my ſelf. And, if I ſhould once finde, that I were depriued of thee, I could be fitt, O my Lord, for nothing, but to returne, to be ſuch a kind of Garden, as that the Flowers being plucked-vp, yet once a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gaine, this miſerable earth of mine, would returne to be a direct Dung-hill, as it was, before. To the end therefore, that I may praiſe thee the better, permitt not, I beſeech thee, O my Lord, that this Soule may euer grow to be loſt, which thou haſt bought with ſo manie afflictions of thine owne; and which thou haſt ſo often repurchaſed, againe, and againe, and taken, from out of the verie teeth, of that hideous Dragon of Hell.</p>
            <p>I beſeech your Reuerence, excuſe me, for ſpeak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing thus, from the purpoſe; and doe not wonder at it, ſince it is, at leaſt, to mine owne purpoſe, to ſpeake as I doe. For, it happens, according to thoſe
<pb n="177" facs="tcp:100776:125"/>
apprehenſions, and reflections, which the Soule chances to make, when one writes. And ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times, it falls-out to be hard enough, to forbeare to celebrate the praiſes of Almightie God, when it happens, that the penn repreſents ſuch things, as expreſſe the high obligations, which we haue to his Diuine Maieſtie. And I belieue, that this, will be, no way, diſpleaſing to your Reuerence; for I am of opinion, that we may, both of vs, doe very well, to ſing one Song, though yet, after a different manner; becauſe it is much more, which I owe to Almightie God, then you; in regard, that he hath pardoned me more Sinnes, as your Reuerence knowes very well.</p>

The particulars, vvhich are touched heer, are not only very profitable, but very neceſſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rie.</p>
            </argument>
            <p>LEt vs now returne to our purpoſe. This Quietnes, and Recollection of the Soule, is eaſily perceiued, by the ſatisfaction, and peace,
<pb n="178" facs="tcp:100776:126"/>
which is infuſed into her, with a very great con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tentment, and calmnes of the Powers of the ſayd Soule, togeather with a very great delight. And now it ſeemes to her (becauſe ſhe is not come yet anie further) that already ſhe hath no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing left to deſire; and that, with a very good will, ſhe could make the ſame ſuite with S. Peter, That her <hi>aboade might be euer there.</hi> She dares not ſtirr, or moue; nay ſhe would hardly giue her ſelf leaue, ſo much as to take her breath, for feare, leaſt ſo, that Good ſhould be flying away, out of her hands, And the while, the poore, little Soule vnderſtands not, that, as, by her owne power, ſhe could doe nothing, for the drawing of that good to her ſelf: ſo is ſhe of leſſe abilitie, to detaine it there, anie longer, then our Lord ſhall be pleaſed to grant it. I haue already declared, that in this firſt Recollection, and Quiet, the Powers, and Faculties of the Soule, are not want<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing; but yet ſhe is ſo fully ſatisfyed with God, that, as long, as this occaſion laſts, howſoeuer thoſe two other Powers may diſcompoſe them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelues, yet, the Will remaining vnited with Al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mightie God, that Quiet, and calme reſt, is not loſt, but rather, by little and little, the Will againe recouers, and recollects the Vnderſtanding, and Memorie. For, howſoeuer the ſayd Will be not yet totally ingulfed, yet is ſhe ſo employed, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out knowing how; that, how diligent ſoeuer they be, they know not how to depriue her, of her contentment, and ioy; but rather ſhe goes
<pb n="179" facs="tcp:100776:126"/>
helping her ſelf, without anie trouble at all, of her owne; to the end, that this little ſparke of the Loue of Almightie God, may not be quenched in her.</p>
            <p>I beſeech our Lord to allow me grace, that I may giue this, to be well vnderſtood; for, there are manie, and very manie Soules, which ariue to be in this Degree, or State; and few, which get beyond it; and I know not, who may be in fault thereof; only I am ſure enough, that there is none, in Almightie God. For, ſince his Diuine Maieſtie doth a Soule the Fauour, that she may be able to ariue to this point, I cannot beleiue, that he would ceaſe, to carrie her much further, if it were not for ſome fault of her owne. But now it imports the ſame Soule very much, that, when she ariues thus farre, she may well vnderſtand the great dignitie, wherein she is; and the great Fauours, which our Lord hath donne her; and how, in all good reaſon, she were no longer to be, as of the Earth; becauſe it ſeemes now already, that his goodnes makes her an Inhabitant of Heauen, if it be not her fault; and wretched shall she be, if she turne back; and I belieue, it would be then, to goe downe, low enough, whither I was going, if the mercie of our Lord had not made me turne yet back againe. For the moſt part, in my opinion, they giue ouer, for very greiuous faults of their owne; nor is it poſſible, for anie Creature, to quitt ſo great a good, without the <note n="*" place="margin">Note.</note> blindnes of being ſubiect to committ ſome very great ill. And
<pb n="180" facs="tcp:100776:127"/>
therefore I humbly beſeech thoſe Soules, euen for the loue of our Lord, to whome his Maieſtie hath done ſo great a Fauour, as to make them able to reach this Degree, and State, that they will know themſelues; yea, and that they will hold themſelues in great account, with an hum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble, and holie preſumption, that ſo, they may neuer returne againe, to the Flesh-Potts of Egipt. And yet, that if through their weaknes, and wickednes, and through their naughtie, and mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerable condition, they should chance to fall back, as I did, they will euer be yet repreſenting to themſelues, the great good, which they haue loſt; and that alſo, they will grow into ſuſpicion of themſelues, and walke along with Feare; as they haue really, great cauſe, to be afrayd. And, if they returne not to Prayer, they will be ſure to goe from bad, to worſe; for, this <note n="*" place="margin">Note.</note> indeed doe I call a true Fall, when one comes once, to abhorre that verie way, whereby they purchaſed ſo great a good; and it is with ſuch Soules, that I am ſpeak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, now. For I ſay not, that Soules will neuer offend God, nor that they will neuer committ anie Sinne; though yet ſtill, it were but reaſon, that whoſoeuer had begunne to receaue ſuch Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uours, as theſe, ſhould be very carefull, to keep themſelues, from committing anie. But, in fine, we are miſerable Creatures; and that, which I aduiſe very earneſtly, is, that they will not giue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ouer their Prayer; for there, ſhall they come to know, what they are doing; and there, ſhall they
<pb n="181" facs="tcp:100776:127"/>
gaine ſorrow, for hauing left our Lord; and ſtrength, to riſe againe. And let that Soule beleiue, (and let her doe it home) that if ſhe depart from Prayer, ſhe growes, in my opinion, to runne great hazard. I know not, whether I hitt right, in what I ſay; but, at leaſt, I iudge of others, by my ſelf.</p>
            <p>But now, in the meane time, this kinde of Prayer, is a certaine Sparke of the Fire of that true Loue, which our Lord beginnes to kindle in a Soule; and his pleaſure alſo is, that the ſame Soule ſhall goe vnderſtanding, what kinde of thing this Loue is, and what kinde of great Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>galo, and delight, it brings. This Quiet, and Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>collection, and little Sparke, if indeed it be of the Spirit of God, and not a guſt, either giuen by the Diuel, or yet procured by our ſelues; (though yet ſtill, one, who hath experience, cannot poſſibly but vnderſtand, at the verie inſtant, that it is no ſuch thing, as can be acquired; ſaue that, euen in our verie Naturall condition, we are ſo greedie of all that, which is ſauourie, that we will needs taſt of all) but if as I ſayd, it be of the Diuel, we quickly grow againe, to be very cold. And, how much ſoeuer we our ſelues, may beginne to make this Fire alſo burne, for the procuring of this guſt, we ſeem to haue indeed a minde, to doe no other buſines heerby, then to caſt-on water enough, to quench it. whereas, if, in verie deed, this little Sparke were of Diuine Loue, and were conveyed by Almightie God, into the Soule, how ſmall,
<pb n="182" facs="tcp:100776:128"/>
and poore ſoeuer it be, it would find ſome ſhift, or other, to make a mightie noiſe. And if the Soule doe not quench it, by her owne fault, this proues that verie thing, which beginnes to make a huge kinde of fire; and ſends forth, great flames from it ſelf (as I shall declare in fitt place) of that mighty loue of God, which his Diuine Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ieſtie is gratiously pleaſed, that perfect Soules should enioy. And this verie Sparke, is a certaine kinde of ſigne, and euen pawne, which his Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uine Maieſtie giues to that Soule, to shew that he chooſes her out, for great things, if she will make her ſelf fitt to receaue them. I ſay, this is a mighty guift, yea and farre greater, then I am anie way able to expreſſe. And it is matter of much greife to me, that (as I was ſaying) I know manie Soules, which ariue thus farre, and that yet, there are ſo very few, which paſſe further, (at leaſt, as they ought to paſſe) that I am euen ashamed to confeſſe it. I ſay not, that there are ſo very few, who paſſe on; for it may very well be, that there are manie; for God doth not ſuſtaine vs for nothing; but I only ſpeake of ſuch, as I haue ſeen.</p>
            <p>For my part, I would earneſtly wish them, not to hide their Talent, ſince, it ſeemes, Almightie God chooſes them out, for the profit of manie others; and eſpecially in theſe times, when it is ſo neceſſarie, that his Diuine Maieſtie should haue ſtrong freinds, to ſupport, and vphold ſuch, as are weake. And let them all, who finde, that they haue receaued this great Fauour, at our Lord's
<pb n="183" facs="tcp:100776:128"/>
hands, eſteem themſelues for ſtrong, if they know, how to correſpond well, with the lawes, which a firme, and faſt freindship, euen of this verie world, requires. And if they will not, let them apprehend very much, and feare, that they shall doe themſelues a great deale of hurt; yea, and I pray God, that it may be to none, but themſelues.</p>
            <p>That, <note n="*" place="margin">Hovv the Soule is to carry it ſelfe in Quiet Prayer.</note> which the Soule is to doe, in theſe times of enioying this Quiet, is but only, <note n="*" place="margin">Note.</note> that with ſuauitie, and without noyſe, she employ the Will to vnderſtand, with much calmnes, and diſcretion, that the Soule is not to negotiate with Almightie God, by the ſtrength of the Arme. I call it noyſe, if the Vnderſtanding goe ſeeking<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out manie words, and conſiderations, to giue thanks for this benefit; and to make vp, a mightie heape of her defects, and ſinnes, to ſhew, that ſhe deſerues not this Fauour. For all, is in motion now; and the Vnderſtanding repreſents many things to vs; and the Memorie is boyling vp; and really, theſe Powers of the Minde, are wont to giue me trouble enough, at times; and, in regard that I haue but a weake Memorie, I ca<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>not, in theſe caſes, ſubdue them. But thoſe other conſiderations, and mentall diſcourſes, be indeed no better, then as ſo manie great loggs of wood, which are layd, with ſmall diſcretion, vpon that little Sparke of fire, to quench it. And therefore let her know, and ſay, with great humilitie: O Lord, what am I able to doe heer? What hath this Seruant, or Slaue, to doe, with the Lord of Heauen, and Earth?
<pb n="184" facs="tcp:100776:129"/>
Or els, ſhe may vſe ſuch other words, as ſhall preſent themſelues then, in the way of Loue. But note heer, that ſhe muſt be very, very well grounded, vpon knowing that to be true, which ſhe ſaith.</p>
            <p>Now, as for that, which concernes the Vnder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtanding, let the Soule conſider it, no otherwiſe, then meerly, as if it were a Miller; and, if ſhe will needs giue it part of that, which she enioyes, or shall labour to recollect it alſo to her ſelf, she will find, that it is not, to proue well with her. For, manie times it is ſeen, that, during this Vnion, and repoſe, or reſt, in the Will, the Vnderſtanding is ſtill much out of order; and, if the Will cannot be be able to arreſt it, it is better, to let it alone, then that she should ſtill goe hunting after it; I ſay, the Will. But let it remaine enioying that Fauour, and be recollected, and shut-vp in it ſelf, like a wiſe <note n="*" place="margin">A true &amp; happy Compa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riſon.</note> Bee; for, if no one of the Bees, should goe into the Hiue, but all, be gadding abroad, ſo to be ſtill ferching one another home, there would little ſtore of hony be made. And ſo, a Soule will looſe very much, if she be not well aduertiſed of this; and eſpecially, if the Vnderſtanding be quick, and sharp. For, if once ſuch an one, beginne to put diſcourſes in order, and light vpon ſome prettie reaſons, to the purpoſe, she will, if they be hand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſomly ſayd, beginne to thinke, that shee per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formes, ſome great exploit. But, the diſcourſe, which is to be vſed heer, muſt be a knowing clearly, and confeſſing plainely, that there is no
<pb n="185" facs="tcp:100776:129"/>
other reaſon at all, why Almightie God should euer doe vs ſo great a Fauour, then his owne onlie goodnes; and to conſider, that we are now approached ſo neer to him; and to begg Fauours of him; and to beſeech him alſo, for his Church, and for all ſuch, as haue recommended them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelues to vs; and ſo alſo, for the Soules in Pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gatorie; and this, not by the noiſe of words, but only by a feeling deſire, to be heard, by his Diuine Maieſtie.</p>
            <p>This is a Prayer, which comprehends very much; and we ſhall obtaine more thereby, then by multiplying much rowling diſcourſe, by way of the Vnderſtanding. But let the Will ſtirr-vp her ſelf, by ſome reaſons, which will eaſily re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſent themſelues to her then, when ſhe findes her ſelf to be ſo very much improued; to quicken-vp her Loue, and to make her performe certaine amourous acts, of how great things she would be glad to doe for one, to whome ſhe owes ſo verie much; without admitting, and permitting, as I ſayd, that the vnderſtanding part, ſhould make a noiſe, in the ſearch, and pretence, of doing high and mightie matters. For heer, anie few, little, poore ſtrawes, preſented, and offered-vp with Humilitie (and they may be ſure enough, to be ſtrawes, if we bring them) will make a great deale more, to the purpoſe, and will help to kindle a good fire more quickly, then a great deale of bigg loggs of wood, will be able to doe. I meane, reaſons, which, in our opinion, ſhall be
<pb n="186" facs="tcp:100776:130"/>
very ſure, to quench, and put-out the fire, euen in the turning of a hand.</p>
            <p>This is good for learned men, who command me to write all this; for, through the goodnes of God, it may be hoped, that all of them ariue hither; and it might perhaps, ſo happen amongſt them, that this time would paſſe away, in applying ſome places of Scripture. But though that kinde of knowledge could not faile to be vſefull to them, both before ſuch occaſions as theſe, and alſo after, yet, at theſe verie times of Prayer, there would be little occaſion, to vſe it, in my opinion; vnleſſe they had a minde, to coole the feruorous employment of the Will. For, the Vnderſtanding findes it ſelf then, to poſſeſſe ſuch an exceſſiue kind of claritie, by being ſo neer to Light it ſelf, that euen I (with being ſo poore, and miſerable, as I am) ſeem to be another kinde of Creature. And it is moſt certainly true, that it hath hapned to me, being in this kind of Quiet, and without vnderſtanding, in effect, anie thing of the Prayers, which are recited, in Latin, and especially of the Pſalter, that not only I vnderſtand the Verſe in Spaniſh, but I paſſe alſo, yet further on, and delight my ſelf highly, in conſidering, what the meaning of that Spaniſh, is. I ſpeake not heer, of what it might import, if ſuch perſons were to preach, or teach others; for then it would be fitt to ſerue themſelues, of that aduantage, towards the aſſiſting of their neighbours to that good; and to help alſo poore people, who know very little,
<pb n="187" facs="tcp:100776:130"/>
like me. For, Charitie is a very great matter; and ſo is this helping soules forward; ſo that alwaies, it be done, purely, for God.</p>
            <p>But now, in theſe times of poſſeſſing this great Quiet, let the Soule be ſuffered to remaine in reſt, with her true repoſe, and let Learning be layd aſide; for, time will come afterward, when it will fall-out to be held, in ſo high account, that they would by no meanes, haue miſſed that treaſure of knowledge, if it were but only, for the power it giues them, to doe more, and better ſeruice, to his Diuine Maieſtie; for it aſſiſts very much, in order to that excellent end. But yet belieue me ſtill, that, in the preſence of that Infinit Wiſdome, a very little attention to exerciſe Humilitie, &amp; one ſingle act of that vertue, is more worth, then all the knowledge of the whole world. For heer, there is no roome, for diſputing of Queſtions, or arguing Caſes, but only to know with truth, and plainenes, what we are; &amp; to repreſent our ſelues, with great ſimplicitie, in the ſight of Almightie God; who deſires, that the Soule ſhould make her ſelf, as very ignorant, and ſillie, as, in verie deed, ſhe is, when once ſhe comes to appeare in his preſence; ſince his Diuine Maieſtie deſcends ſo much below himſelf, as to endure her, neer his owne perſon; all we, being that, which we are.</p>
            <p>The Vnderſtanding will alſo moue it ſelf heer, to giue certaine thankes to Almightie God, which may be handſomely ordered, and compoſed; but the Will, with a certaine kinde of Quiet and
<pb n="188" facs="tcp:100776:131"/>
peace, and with a not daring, like the Publican of the Goſpell, ſo much as lift-vp her eyes, payes yet more retribution of thankes, then the Vnder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtanding, perhaps, knowes how to doe, with reuoluing all the Rhetorick, in the world. But, in fine, we are not totally, in this caſe, to forbeare to make Mentall Prayer; no, nor yet ſometimes, to vſe ſome Vocall Words, if we will, and can. And I ſay, <hi>can;</hi> becauſe if the Quiet be great, and deep, they will hardly enough be able to ſpeake, without making it coſt them much paine.</p>
            <p>In <note n="*" place="margin">The good Spirit very eaſily diſcerned from the bad.</note> my opinion, we may well vnderſtand, when this is of the Spirit of Almightie God; and when it happens to be procured, by our ſelues, though it be vpon a beginning of that deuotion, which God giues vs. For, when, as I haue ſayd, wee will needs reſolue our ſelues, of our ſelues, to procure to paſſe on, to this poſſeſſing the Quiet of the Will, it vſes to worke no good effect, at all; but quickly ends, and leaues nothing but drynes, behind it. And, if it chance to proceed from the Diuel, a Soule, which is exerciſed in this kind, will, I belieue, grow eaſily to vnderſtand it; for, in that caſe, it will leaue a certaine kind of diſquiet, and little affection to Humilitie, and an vntoward diſpoſition, in order to the producing of thoſe effects, which the Spirit of Almightie God, is wont to breed; nor doth it alſo leaue, either light, in the Vnderſtanding, or a conſtant loue of truth, in the Will. And this, will doe a Soule, either very little hurt, or none at all, if she direct,
<pb n="189" facs="tcp:100776:131"/>
and addreſſe the ſuauitie, and delight, which then ſhe feeles, to the glorie of Almightie God; and, if ſhe lodge her thoughts, and deſires, vpon him, as I haue formerly aduiſed, the Diuel will gaine little, by the bargaine. Nay, rather Almightie God will ſo diſpoſe of things, that he ſhall looſe much, euen by that verie delight, which he cauſes in her Soule; for, this verie delight, shall be a meanes, to make that Soule, which conceaues, that it proceeds from God, to come againe, often to Prayer, with deſire to receaue more delight, Or els, if the Soule be very humble, and not withall, very curious, nor very much intereſſed, in taking delights (though euen they be ſpirituall) but be indeed, a true friend to the Croſſe, ſhe will make very little account of anie guſt, which the Diuel can giue her; which yet ſhe ſhall neuer be able to doe, if, indeed, it be the Spirit of God; for, in that caſe, she will euer be ſure, to hold it, in verie high account. Now, when the Diuel propounds ſuch a buſines, (ſince he is all, made of Lyes) whenſoeuer he ſees a Soule abaſe, and humble her ſelf, by meanes of that delight, and guſt, which she receaues (for, indeed, we are to haue very great care, to procure to proue very humble, vpon all the occaſions of Prayer, and guſts) the Diuel will not returne to tempt vs very often, when he co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ſiders, how much he looſes, by the endeauour.</p>
            <p>For this reaſon, and vpon manie other conſide<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rations, did I aduertiſe, in the Firſt Degree, and State of Prayer (which anſwers to the Firſt way
<pb n="190" facs="tcp:100776:132"/>
of drawing Water, in the Garden) that it is a <note n="*" place="margin">Note this point, aboue all.</note> prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cipall buſines, when the Soule is entring firſt, vpon Prayer, to beginne to vntye her ſelf, from the deſyre of all kinde of ſenſible contentment; and to enter vpon this onlie reſolution, to help our Lord IESVS, to carrie his Croſſe; like good Caual<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liers, who are reſolued to ſerue their King without wages, ſince they are ſo ſure of him, as they are. And we are alſo, ſtill to carrie our eyes, vpon that true, and euerlaſting Kingdome, which we pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cure to acquire.</p>
            <p>It is a very great point, to haue this euer in view, and eſpecially in the beginnings; for after<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards, it is ſeen ſo very clearly, that it may rather be fitt, to forget it; to the end, that we may be able euen to liue, then procure to be remembring, that the world is to laſt very little; and that all, in fine, is nothing; and that heer, the eaſe and reſt, which we can haue, is to be eſteemed for nothing. This may ſeem to be a very poore, and baſe conſidera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion; and ſo indeed it is; for they, who haue pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceeded to more perfection, would take it for an affront, and would euen bluſh, and be aſhamed amongſt the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ſelues, if they thought, they forſooke the goods of this world, becauſe they muſt come once, to haue an end. For, although thoſe goods were to laſt alwaies, they would yet reioyce to leaue them, for the loue of our Lord; and ſtill the more perfect they were, they would reioyce ſo much the more; yea, &amp; the more alſo would they reioyce, the longer they belieued, they were to laſt.
<pb n="191" facs="tcp:100776:132"/>
In theſe men, this Loue, is already growne-vp to ſtrength; and it is this, which workes moſt; but for ſuch, as are but Beginners, it is a point of higheſt importance (and they muſt, by no meanes, hold it for low) to be content, to leaue all guſts, for God. For, the benefits, which are gained by this co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ſide<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration, are great; and therefore doe I aduiſe it ſo much. Nay, euen thoſe others, who are moſt ele<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uated, and accompliſhed in Prayer, will haue need alſo of ſuch conſiderations, as theſe. And there are times, when Almightie God will try them; nay it will ſeem, as if this Diuine Maieſtie would forſake them. For (as I haue ſayd already, and I would faine not haue it be forgotten) the Soule in this life, which we liue, encreaſes not, as the Bodie doth; though yet we ſay it doe; and really, it doth encreaſe; but yet a Child, after he is growne, and become tall, and proues to be already a man, re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turnes not to decreaſe againe, and to haue a little bodie. Yet now, in the point of a Soule, our Lord will haue it be otherwiſe, by what I haue ſeen of my ſelf; for I know it not, in reſpect of others; and it ought to humble vs, for our owne greater good, and to the end alſo, that we may not be negligent, as long as we ſhall be in this banniſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment; ſince he, who is higheſt in vertue, ſhall doe well, to feare himſelf moſt, and to truſt himſelf, leaſt. The times, perhaps, may come, when euen they, who haue their Will, ſo conforme to the Holie Will of Almightie God, that they would rather be tormented, and endure a thouſand
<pb n="192" facs="tcp:100776:133"/>
deaths, then ſwarue from it, ſhall doe well, to be in doubt, that euen they, may grow to fall, into ſome great offence of his Diuine Maieſtie. And ſo, there are certaine times, when they ſhall ſee them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelues ſo aſſaulted by temptations, and perſecu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions, that, to the end, they may not commit groſſe ſinnes, they will haue need to ſerue themſelues, of the Firſt Defenſiue weapons of Prayer; and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turne to remember, and conſider, that all the world, is finally to end; and that there is a Heauen, and a Hell; and to vſe ſuch conſiderations, as theſe.</p>
            <p>But now, returning to what I was ſaying, a great foundation it is (for being freed from the ſubtle enterpriſes, and guſts, which the Diuel is wont to giue) to beginne with a firme <note n="*" place="margin">A moſt neceſſary Docu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment.</note> purpoſe, at the verie firſt, to walke in the way of the Croſſe; and to deſire no ſuch thing, as guſts; ſince our Lord himſelf shewed this way of perfection; by ſaying: <hi>Take thou vp thy Croſſe, and follovv me.</hi> For he is to be our Patterne; and whoſoeuer shall follow his counſels, and that, for no other reaſon, then to content him, may be ſure, that he shall haue nothing to feare. And by the ſpirituall profit, which they shall finde in themſelues, they will eaſily come to know, that the Diuel had no hand therein; and though they should euen returne to fall againe, there will yet remaine one ſigne, that our Lord had been there: which is, That they will quickly riſe againe; beſides theſe others, which I shall now declare.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="193" facs="tcp:100776:133"/>
When it is the Spirit of Almightie God, there will be no need at all, to goe in Queſt, and Sent, after certaine reaſons, to draw humilitie, and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fuſion, from thence. For, our Bleſſed Lord himſelf, is wont to impart it, in thoſe caſes, after a very different manner, from that, which our ſelues can procure, by anie prettie little conſiderations of our owne; all which, are nothing, in compariſon of a certaine true <note n="*" place="margin">A great bleſsing, by meanes of this Prayer.</note> Humilitie, that comes along with a light, which our Lord inſtructs vs in, heer; and which breeds ſuch a reall confuſion in vs, as euen doth e<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>tirely defeat vs. And the knowledge, which Almightie God is wont to giue vs, to the end, that we may perfectly vnderſtand, that we haue no good at all, of our ſelues, is a thing very ſufficiently perceaued; and ſtill, ſo much the more, as we re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceaue the higher Fauours, from his hands. It alſo imparts to a man, a very great deſire, to proceed in Prayer; and he will not giue it ouer, for anie trouble, which may poſſibly ſucceed to him. He offers himſelf, and is readie to endure all things. He hath alſo a kind of aſſured hope, that he ſhall be ſaued; though yet ſtill, not without humilitie, and feare. By this time, he alſo inſtantly forſakes all kind of ſeruile feare, of his Soule; and it giues a great deale of growth, to a Filiall feare, in ſtead thereof. He ſees, that now he beginns to beare a certaine loue, towards Almightie God, which is farre from anie intereſt of his owne; &amp; he couets to get times for Solitude, that ſo, he may haue the better oportunitie, to enioy that good. In fine,
<pb n="194" facs="tcp:100776:134"/>
(that I may not wearie my ſelf too much) this is a direct beginning, of all good things; a State, wherein the Flowers are now vpon the verie point, to bloſſome. And all this, the Soule ſees very clearly; and can, by no meanes, at that time, con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceaue, but that God was, and will be with her, till ſuch time, as ſhe ſhall returne, to find her ſelf guiltie of faylings, and imperfections, towards him; for, in that caſe, ſhe feares all things; and it is fitt, that ſhe doe ſo. Though yet, there are <note n="*" place="margin">Theſe, are the more ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nerous mindes.</note> Soules in the world, to which it proues more vſefull, to beleiue, for a moſt certaine truth, that they are well with Almightie God; then all the feares of the world, are able to giue them. For, if the Soule, in her ſelf, be apt to be enamoured, and gratefull, the memorie of that great Fauour, which God did her, will be of more power, to make her returne, to his Diuine Maieſtie, then all the torments of Hell, which they can poſſibly be euer able to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſent. At leaſt (as wicked, as I am) it hapned after this manner, to me. Now, as for the ſignes of a good Spirit, I will ſpeake of them heerafter, more at large; for now I cannot doe it, ſince it coſts me ſo much trouble, of manie kindes, to get them written our, faire; and I belieue, that, with the fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uour of our Lord, I may be able to hitt right, in this kinde; for, (beſides the experience, which I haue, whereby I came to vnderſtand manie things) I know ſomewhat, by meanes of ſome learned men, who, indeed, are very learned; and of ſome perſon's alſo, who are very holie; to
<pb n="195" facs="tcp:100776:134"/>
whome it is great reaſon, to giue beleif. And therefore, let not other Soules be ſo very much afflicted, and vexed, as I haue been; when once, through the goodnes of Almightie God, they ſhall be come on, ſo farre, as to find themſelues in this State.</p>

            <p>LEt vs now come to ſpeake of the Third Wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter, wherewith this Garden is watered; for, this, is a running Water of a Riuer, or Spring; and it waters it with much leſſe labour; though yet the diſtribution thereof, cauſes ſome. Our Lord will heer ſo help the Gardner, that, in ſome ſort, he will be, as it were, the Gardner himſelf, and, in effect, the Doer of all. This is a ſweet repoſe, or ſleep of all the Powers, which are yet neither totally loſt, nor yet doe they know, how they
<pb n="196" facs="tcp:100776:135"/>
worke. This guſt, and delight, and ſuauitie, is greater, beyond all compariſon, then the former; for, the Water of this grace, gets-vp to the verie throat of the Soule; in ſuch ſort, that now it cannot goe forward; nor knowes, how to doe it; nor yet would, by anie meanes, returne backward; but enioyes an exceſſiue kinde of glorie. It is, as when a man is already, with the Holie <note n="*" place="margin">As vvhen one is dyinge.</note> Candle, in his hand; ſo that now, there wants very little, of dying; but it is of that verie death, which is deſired; for ſhe is enioying the greateſt delight, that can be imagined, in that agonie of hers; and me thinkes, it is no other thing, then euen to dye, as it were, entirely, to all the things of this world, and to be enioying Almightie God. For my part, I can thinke of no other tearmes, wherewith to expreſſe it, or declare it; nor knowes the Soule, at that time, what to doe; nor, whether ſhe ſhould ſpeake, or be ſilent; or laugh, or weep. <note n="*" place="margin">This is an admi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rable State of Minde.</note> It is a glorious kinde of Frenſie; and a Celeſtiall kinde of Follie, where yet, true wiſdome is learnt; and it is a moſt delightfull manner of enioying, for the Soule, in a Superlatiue Degree. It is true that it may be about ſome fiue, or ſix yeares, ſince firſt our Lord vouchſafed to allow me this kinde of Prayer, often, and in great abundance; and that I neither did, either perfectly vnderſtand it, nor yet can exactly declare it; and for my part, I made account, when I was come hither, that I could ſay, either little, or nothing. And yet I well vnderſtood, that this was not an entire Vnion of all the
<pb n="197" facs="tcp:100776:135"/>
Powers of the Soule; and yet ſtill, that it was clearly more, then might be found in the former Degree of Prayer; and yet withall, I muſt euer confeſſe, that I could not tell, how to know, and much leſſe exactly determine, what this differe<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ce was. But I well belieue, that, for the humilitie, which your Reuerence hath ſhewed, in being deſirous to help your ſelf, by ſo great a ſimplicitie, as mine, our Lord gaue me this Prayer, this day, immediatly after my receauing the B. Sacrament; yet without my being able, to goe forward. And he put theſe Compariſons into my head, and taught me the manner, how to expreſſe them, and what the Soule is to doe, in theſe caſes; and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally, I was amazed at it; for, I vnderſtood all this buſines, at an inſtant. Manie times, I was, as it were, out of my ſelf, and as if I had been euen inebriated with this loue; and yet I could neuer vnderſtand, how it was. Only I knew very well, that it was God; but I could not tell the manner, how he wrought in me, at that time. For it is the verie truth, that the <note n="*" place="margin">The true State of the Povvers of the Minde, in this Prayer.</note> Powers are, as it were, all vnited, though yet not ſo ingulfed, but that ſtill they worke; and I haue been extreamly ioyed, that, at length, I am come to vnderſtand it; and Bleſſed be our Lord for euer, who hath regaled me, in ſo high a degree. Theſe Powers haue only now abilitie, to buſie themſelues totally, vpon Almightie God; nor doth it ſeem, that anie of them now, euen dares ſo much as houer, or ſtirre, not, as it were, breath, if we doe not diuert our
<pb n="198" facs="tcp:100776:136"/>
ſelues then, with great endeauour; yea and euen ſo, me thinkes, we can ſcarce doe it entirely, at that time. A multitude of words, are conceaued heer, by the Soule, in praiſe of our Lord; but yet ſo, as that they are without anie order, vnleſſe our Lord himſelf be pleaſed, to order them; for, at leaſt, the Vnderſtanding ſerues heer, for nothing. The Soule would faine cry out, in praiſe of Al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mightie God; &amp; ſhe is then, in ſuch condition, as that ſhe knowes not, how to co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>taine her ſelf. This is now, a very fauourie kinde of diſquiet; and now, yea euen very now, the Flowers open them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelues, to bloſſome; and already doe they beginne, to yeild their odour. And heer the Soule would be glad, that all the world might be able to ſee, and vnderſtand her glorie, that ſo, Almightie God might be praiſed; and that they might be able to aſſiſt her therein; and that ſhe might giue them part of her ioy; as not knowing, how to enioy it all, her ſelf. Me thinkes, ſhe is now, to be like her, of the Ghoſpel, who had a minde, to call-in all her Neighbours. Or els, like, the admirable Spirit of the Royall Prophet Dauid who might feele ſome ſuch thing in himſelf, as this, when he played vpon his Harpe, and ſung, in honour, and praiſe of Almightie God. I find my ſelf very much deuoted, to this Glorious King; and I wiſh, that all the world were ſo; eſpecially all we, who are Sinners.</p>
            <p>O my deare Lord; what kind of thing, is a Soule, when she findes her ſelf in ſuch a condition; as
<pb n="199" facs="tcp:100776:136"/>
this? She would faine become, all Toung, to praiſe our Lord. She vtters a thouſand holie impertinen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cies; but yet, ſhe doth euer endeauour to hitt right, in pleaſing him, who holds her there, in that manner. I know of a certaine perſon, who, though ſhe were no Poet, yet inſtantly did ſhe happen to make certaine Verſes, all, extempore, which were very ſignificant in the way of complaint, &amp; declared her paine very well, though they were not made, by her owne Vnderſtanding, alone; but, for the better enioying that glorie, which gaue her ſo delightfull a paine, ſhe complained thereof, to her God. She wiſhes, that ſhe might be all torne in pieces, both in Bodie, and Soule, to ſhew the ioy ſhe findes, to feele this paine. What torme<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ts could then, be ſet before her, which then, ſhe would not be glad to endure, for the loue of our Lord? She clearly ſees, that the Martyrs did very little, on their parts, when they ſuffered torments; for, the Soule knowes then, very well, that her ſtrength comes to her, by ſome other way, then from her ſelf.</p>
            <p>But now, what will ſhe feele, when ſhe comes back, to employ her witts, vpon knowing how to liue againe, in this world; and to returne both to the cares, and complements, thereof. And cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainly, me thinkes, I am farre, from hauing exag<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gerated anie thing, concerning this manner of ioy, which our Lord is pleaſed, to make a Soule poſſeſſe, euen in this place of bannishment; for, all that, which I haue ſayd of it, is very poore, and
<pb n="200" facs="tcp:100776:137"/>
meane, in compariſon of what it is, in it ſelf. Bleſſed be thou for euer, O Lord; and let all things praiſe thee, for euer; And be pleaſed, O my King, (I moſt humbly beſeech, and begg, at thy hands) that, ſince when euen now I am not wholy out of this holie Celeſtiall Frenſie, or follie, (which, through thy goodnes, and mercie, and ſo wholy without anie merit of mine, thou doſt me the great Fauour to impart,) either all ſuch perſons, as with whome I shall haue occa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion to conuerſe, may be euen, as it were, madd fooles, for thy loue; or els, diſpoſe thou ſo, of me, as that I may neuer conuerſe more, with any Creature; or els finally, O Lord, giue order, that I may haue nothing to doe in this world; or, at leaſt, take me out of it, quite. For now already, O my God, this Seruant of thine, is no longer able to endure ſo great afflictions, as she feeles to come vpon her, by her being thus, without thee. And if she needs muſt liue, she deſires to haue no eaſe in this life; nor, indeed, doſt thou giue her anie; for it is death to her, to ſee her ſelf eat; she is afflicted, by the ſleep she takes; she findes, that her whole life, is ſpent, and paſt through, in Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>galo's; and yet that now, there is nothing, but thy ſelf, who can indeed regale her; So that it ſeemes, I liue now euen againſt nature, ſince now I would faine not liue in my ſelf, but only in thee.</p>
            <p>O thou my true Lord, and my Glorie! how delicate, and yet how hugely heauie, is that Croſſe, which thou haſt prepared, and prouided
<pb n="201" facs="tcp:100776:137"/>
for ſuch, as ariue to this State? It is delicate, becauſe it is incredibly ſweet; and it is heauie, becauſe there grow to be certaine times, when there is not patience enough, in the whole world, to enable vs to endure it; and yet the Soule would neuer deſire, to be free from it, vnleſſe it were, to the end, that she might find her ſelf once, to be with thee. And when alſo the ſame Soule remembers, that she was neuer able to doe thee ſeruice, in anie thing; and that, by continu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to liue, it may yet, perhaps, be poſſible for her, to ſerue thee, she would be glad, if she might lye vnder a very much more heauie burthen, then the former; yea, and that ſhe might alſo neuer dye, euen till the verie end of the world. She values not anie manner of repoſe, or reſt, ſo much as to the weight of one haire, in compari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon of doing thee anie poore little ſeruice; nor doth ſhe know, what more to deſire; but ſhe is only ſure of thus much, that ſhe deſires nothing, but thy ſelf.</p>
            <p>O my Sonne (for you, to whome this is directed, and who haue commanded me to write it, are ſo humble, that you will needs be called, by that name) let theſe things be only for your ſelf, when you ſee, that I am gone out of all limits; for there is no kind of reaſon, which ſuffices to keep me from leauing the vſe of hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mane reaſon, when our Lord is pleaſed to draw me thus, out of my ſelf. Nor doe I know, or belieue, that it is I, who am ſpeaking thus, euer
<pb n="202" facs="tcp:100776:138"/>
ſince I receaued the B. Sacrament, this morning. For, me thinkes, I doe but dreame, of what I ſee; and I would be glad, not to ſee anie other, then ſuch, as are ſick of that verie ſame diſeaſe, which is now vpon me. I humbly beſeech your Reue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rence, that we may all, become like madd fooles, for his loue, who was content to be called Foole, for the loue of vs. And, ſince your Reuerence ſayes, that you wiſh me ſo cordially well, I deſire, that you will ſhew it, by diſpoſing your ſelf in ſuch ſort, as that our Lord may doe you this Fauour. For, I ſee, there are very few men, who haue not more witt, then euen they need, for the effecting ſuch things, as they hold, to concerne them; but now perhaps, I may haue more, then they all. But doe not you ſuffer this, my deare Father, (ſince you are ſo, as well as my Sonne; becauſe you are my Confeſſarius, to whoſe hands I haue committed the care of my Soule) but vnbeguile me, by telling me truth; though truths be, now a-dayes, ſeldome told. And now I would be very glad, that we Fiue, who, at the preſent, loue one another, in Chriſt our Lord; That, I ſay, as others meet in ſecret, againſt the Seruice of his Diuine Maieſtie, for the ordering of their wickednes, and their Hereſies; we alſo might procure, ſometimes, to meet, for the diſabuſing one another; and to conferr, how we might reforme our ſelues, and giue Almightie God, more guſt. For, there is no Creature, that knowes him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf ſo well, as they doe, who looke vpon vs; ſo
<pb n="203" facs="tcp:100776:138"/>
that it be with true loue, and care of our amend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment. I ſpeake of this, as a Secret, and in your care; for now, already, no ſuch language, as this, is vſed; when euen Preachers themſelues, goe ſo compoſing their Sermons, as that they may be ſure, to giue men no diſguſt by them. But their intention, forſooth, is ſo good, as that the fruits will be anſwerable to it; and ſo we ſee, how few grow to mend their liues. But how comes it now to paſſe, that they are not very manie, who giue ouer, to be publique in following vice, by meanes of thoſe Sermo<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>s, which are made? Shall I tell, what I thinke? It is, becauſe the Preachers, make them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelues too wiſe. Not yet, that they are indeed, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out witt, by reaſon of any great fyre of the Loue of Almighty God, which is in their harts, as the A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſtles were; and ſo their flame falls-out to giue but very little heat. I ſay not, that I expect, that it ſhould be ſo great, as theirs was; but yet I hartily wiſh, that it were greater, then I can now find it is. Your Reuerence knowes, in what, very much, would conſiſt; Namely, in hauing this life of ours, in deteſtation; and honour, in very little eſtimation; and that, rather then faile, both to ſpeake truth, and to maintaine it, for the glorie of Almightie God, we would be as well con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tented to looſe all, as to gaine all. For, who<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſoeuer is reſolued, in very good earneſt, to put it all, to hazard, for the loue of our Bleſſed Lord, will be as well content, with the, one, as with the other. I ſay not, that I am anie ſuch
<pb n="204" facs="tcp:100776:139"/>
Creature; but I hartily wiſh I were.</p>
            <p>O great, and gallant Libertie, to eſteem it for a direct captiuitie, to be bound to liue, and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uerſe, according to the Lawes of this World! For, when this is once obtained, at the hands of Al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mightie God, there is not ſo baſe a Slaue vpon Earth, as would not venture all; that, ſo he might redeem himſelf, and returne home to his owne Countrie. And, ſince this, wherein we are, is the true way; there is neither cauſe, nor colour, why we ſhould deſire, to loyter in it. For we ſhall neuer finiſh the gaining of ſo great a treaſure, till our Lord giue vs his grace, to doe it well. I humbly pray your Reuerence, to teare this, which I haue written, if you thinke fitt; and pardon me; for I haue preſumed too farre.</p>

               <p>She proſecutes the ſame Argument, about this Third Degree of Prayer; And finishes the declaration of the effects, vvhich it vvorkes; and declares alſo, the diſaduan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tage, vvhich the Memorie, and Imagina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, are vvont to bring, in this caſe.</p>
            </argument>
            <p>I Haue already ſpoken, to ſome good propor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, of this manner of Prayer, and of that, which the Soule is to performe therein; or rather
<pb n="205" facs="tcp:100776:139"/>
of what God doth in her; for now it is himſelf, who takes the Office of Gardner, vpon him; and he will haue her, take her caſe; and only, that the Will may accept of thoſe Fauours, which ſhe enioyes; and ſhe muſt offer her ſelf, to goe through, with all that, which he, who is true Wiſdome, ſhall be pleaſed to ordaine; for which purpoſe, there is really need, of a great deale of courage. For, ſo great, * and high, vſes that ioy to be, that ſometimes it ſeems, that there needs not ſo much, as a haires breadth, for making the Soule goe inſtantly out of that Bodie; and O, what a happie death would that be! And heer, me thinkes, that comes in, very well, which once was ſayd to your Reuerence, that you muſt leaue your ſelf wholy, in the Armes of God; If he will carrie you to Heauen, That you goe; If to Hell, there will be no torment there, ſo that you be with him, who is your totall good; If inſtantly to make an end of this life, That you deſire nothing els; And yet, that you be as well pleaſed, if yet, he will haue you liue, a thouſand yeares. Let his Diuine Maieſtie diſpoſe of you, as of a thing, which is properly his owne; for, your Soule is now no longer yours, but it wholy belongs to our Lord; and therefore you muſt be altogeather out of care. Now I ſay, that in ſo eleuated, and high a Prayer, as this, ſhe vnderſtands that ſhe can performe it, without anie wearines at all, to the Vnderſtanding; for when God giues this Prayer to a Soule, ſhe is able to doe all this; yea, and can
<pb n="206" facs="tcp:100776:140"/>
alſo worke other manner of effects, then theſe. Only me thinkes, ſhe is, as it were, amazed, to ſee our Lord performe the Office of a good Gardner, ſo well; and is not pleaſed, that ſhe ſhould take anie trouble or paines; but only that ſhe is to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>light her ſelf, in beginning to enioy the odour of thoſe Flowers. For, in one ſuch approach as this, (how little a while ſoeuer it may laſt) ſuch a kind of Gardner this is (for, he is the Creatour of the Water; and he giues it ſo very freely, beyond meaſure) that, what this ſingle poore Soule was not able to aſſemble, by the labour of tyring-out her Vnderſtanding, in twentie yeares togeather, this Celeſtiall Gardner doth it all, in one moment of time; and the Fruit doth ſo grow, and become ripe, that it is able, through the good pleaſure of our Lord, to ſuſtaine the Owner thereof, and to enable him, to liue vpon the gaine, which he makes by it. Only, he giues not this Soule leaue, to Preſent of this Fruit, to others, till ſuch time, as ſhe be growne ſtrong, by what her ſelf hath eaten of it; and ſhe muſt not ſquander it away, in trying idly, how it taſts. For ſo, (ſhe not valuing the profit, which ſhe might make by it, nor they paying her anie thing for it, to whome ſhe gaue it) ſhe comes to maintaine, and feed them vp, at her coſt, whilſt her ſelf may, by degrees, grow to be readie to dye, of hungar. This will perhaps, be well comprehended by them, who haue a right kind of vnderſtanding, and will know, how to apply it better, then I can
<pb n="207" facs="tcp:100776:140"/>
declare it; and now I am euen wearie, to thinke if it.</p>
            <p>In a word, the truth is this, that the vertues, which are obtained in this Prayer, remaine ſo much ſtronger heer, then in the Prayer of Quiet (whereof I ſpake before) that the Soule cannot be ignorant thereof. For ſhe finds her ſelfe to be wholy growne, another kind of thing, then ſhe was; and ſhe beginnes (ſhe euen ſcarce knowes, how) to act, and worke great things, by the odour, which the Flowers yeild, of themſelues. For now, our Lord is pleaſed, that they may ſprowt, and open; to the end, that ſhe may know, ſhe hath vertues; though yet with all, ſhe ſee very clearly, that she was not able, to acquire, and get them; but that the Celeſtiall Gardner, was pleaſed to impart them to her, as it were, at an inſtant. The humilitie alſo of this Soule, is much greater, and more profound, then in the former Prayer; be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe she ſees more clearly, that her ſelf did, neither much, nor little, but only conſent, that our Lord might doe her thoſe Fauours; and she em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brace them, with her Will. To me it ſeemes, that there is, in this kind of Prayer, a very euident <note place="margin">Hovv there is an Vnion in this Prayer; &amp; hovv there is none.</note> Vnion of the whole Soule, with God; ſaue that, it alſo ſeemes, that his Diuine Maieſtie giues li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bertie to the Powers thereof, to vnderſtand, and enioy the abundance, of what he works therein. Now, it happens ſometimes, yea and manie times, that the Will being thus vnited (that your Reue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rence may ſee, both that this may be, and may alſo
<pb n="208" facs="tcp:100776:141"/>
be able, to vnderſtand it, when you haue it; and, at leaſt, it puts me almoſt out of my witts, &amp; there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore I relate it to you heer) knowes, and vnder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtands, that it is tyed-vp, and bound, and yet in condition of enioying. I ſay againe, it knowes, that it ſelf, being the Will, remaines in much Quiet, whilſt yet, on the other ſide, the Vnder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtanding, and Memorie, are free, and are able to treat of buſineſſes, &amp; to attend to certaine workes of Charitie. Now, though this ſeem to be all one, with that, which was ſpoken of, in that other Diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>courſe of Quiet Prayer, yet it is different. Becauſe there, the Soule is in ſuch caſe, as it would faine not ſtirr, nor moue it ſelf, in that kinde of Prayer, as enioying the leaſure and contemplation of Marie; I meane, of S. Marie Magdalen; Whereas heer, in this Prayer, she can alſo act the part of Martha. So that she doth now, in effect, performe the offices, both of the Actiue, and of the Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>templatiue life; and all at once; and is able to exer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciſe her ſelf, vpon thoſe buſineſſes, and workes of Charitie, which are incident to her condition. And she can alſo read; though yet ſtill, the Powers, or Faculties of her Soule, are not ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolutly the Lords of themſelues; and ſtill she vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſta<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ds well enough, that the greateſt part of her ſelf (that is to ſay, her cheif attention, and opera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion) is ſomewhere els. It is iuſt, as if we were ſpeaking with ſome one; and that withall, at the ſelf ſame time, ſome other perſon were ſpeaking to vs, in ſuch ſort, as that we were not entirely
<pb n="209" facs="tcp:100776:141"/>
attentiue; either to the one, or to the other. But it is a thing, which is perceaued very clearly, and giues great ſatisfaction, and contentment, when<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſoeuer it ariues; and it vſes to be a very great preparation, and diſpoſition, to the end, that, whenſoeuer the Partie may be in anie Solitude, or exemption from buſines, the Soule may inſtantly enioy a very perfect quietnes, and repoſe. This is a certaine Being, as if a perſon receaued ſuch a kinde of ſatisfaction, and ceſſation of appe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tite in himſelf, as that he would haue no need at all, to eat, but felt his ſtomack content; in ſuch ſort, as that he would not eaſily apply himſelf to taſt, of whatſoeuer should be ſet before him; but yet withall, that, if he ſaw ſuch meate as he liked, he would not forbeare: to eat of it. For iuſt ſo, doth the Soule, not ſatisfye her ſelf, nor is content to feed vpon the meate of this world; becauſe she findes that, in her ſelf, which giues her ſatisfaction, it being the farre greater co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>tentment, which she hath in Almightie God; and her deſire alſo is, to ſatisfye euen thoſe deſires of hers; and this is that, which she procures.</p>
            <p>There is alſo, another kinde of Vnion, which euen yet, is not ſo much, as an abſolute, and entire Vnion, though it be greater then that, of which I was ſpeaking before; and not altogeather ſo great, as that of this Third Water; And your Reuerence will be very glad (ſuppoſing, that our Lord beſtow them all, vpon you, if you haue them not already) to finde it written thus; and
<pb n="210" facs="tcp:100776:142"/>
directly to vnderſtand, what it is. For it is one kinde of Fauour, for our Lord to impart the ſame very Fauour; and another, to vnderſtand, what grace, and Fauour, that is; yea, and yet another, to be able, to vnfold, and declare, how it paſſes. And howſoeuer it may ſeem, that there may no more, then the Firſt of theſe Three, be needfull, for the keeping of the Soule, from being in a kinde of confuſion, and feare, and for enabling it to goe forward, with more courage, in the way of our Lord, euen treading with the verie feet thereof, vpon all the things of this world; yet is it a Fauour of ſo great aduantage, to vnderſtand it, that it is reaſon, that both he, who hath it, and euen he alſo, who hath it not, ſhould praiſe our Lord, much, for it; becauſe his Diuine Maieſtie hath been pleaſed to giue it to ſome one, who is yet aliue, to the end, that he might alſo doe vs good.</p>
            <p>Now, it happens alſo manie times to me, that I haue this manner of Vnion, whereof I am ſpeaking; for it pleaſes Almightie God, to doe me this Fauour, very, very often; and that God recol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lects, and takes hold of my Will; yea and alſo, in my opinion, of my Vnderſtanding; for then, it diſcourſes no longer, but is employed, vpon enioying Almightie God; as one, who ſtands looking, and looking, and ſees ſo very much, that he knowes not indeed, which way to looke; for, one thing inſtantly appeares, which takes away the ſight of the other; and ſo, nothing makes anie
<pb n="211" facs="tcp:100776:142"/>
impreſſion at all. The Memorie, remaines free; and ſo alſo doth the Imagination, ſeem to doe; and this Imagination, when it findes it ſelf thus, all alone, (that is, without being controuled by the Vnderſtanding) it would make a bodie wonder extreamly, to ſee, what a coyle it keeps; and what a warre, it makes; and procures, to put all, out of order. For my part, I am ſure, it tires me; and I am alſo ſure, that I abhorre it; and I haue often beſought our Lord, that, if it muſt needs diſtract me ſtill, after this manner, he will be pleaſed, to take it from me, in theſe occaſions. And ſometimes I preſume to ſay thus to him: When, O my God, is this whole Soule of mine, to be entirely vnited, in thy praiſe; and not de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uided thus, into peices, without being ſo much as able, to ſerue her ſelf, of her ſelf. But heer, doe I, in the meane time, diſcerne the miſchief, which hath been brought vpon vs, by Sinne; ſince it makes vs be ſo ſubiect, to the not doing, of what we ſo much deſire; which is, to be euer buſied about Almightie God.</p>
            <p>I ſay, this happens to me diuerſe times, and one of thoſe times, was this verie day; and ſo, I may the better remember it. For, in fine, I ſee my Soule, euen diſſolue, and defeat her ſelf, through the deſire, which ſhe hath to be wholy there, where ſhe finds her ſelf, for the moſt part, to be already; and yet, that this is impoſſible, becauſe both the Memorie, and Imagination, doe ſtill make ſuch warre vpon her, that they ſuffer her
<pb n="212" facs="tcp:100776:143"/>
not to worke, like her ſelf. And though they be not able, to doe her anie hurt, in regard that the other Powers, and Faculties are wanting; yet indeed, they may well be thought, to doe hurt enough, by the diſquiet, they giue. But yet ſtill I ſay, that they doe her properly no hurt; becauſe, indeed, they haue no ſtrength; nor doe they fix themſelues in anie one Being, or State. And, in regard that the Vnderſtanding doth not help the Imagination, in that, which it repreſents, either more, or leſſe, it cannot faſten vpon anie thing; but skipps, vp &amp; downe, from one to another. And it is like thoſe importunate, and vnquiet little Gnatts, which buzze, and whizze by night, heer, and there; for iuſt ſo, are theſe Powers wont to goe, from one to another. This Compariſon ſeemes to me, to be extreamly proper; for though theſe inferiour Faculties, haue not ſtrength, and meanes, to doe harme, yet are they troubleſome enough, to ſuch as feele them. Not doe I know, what remedie there is, againſt this inconuenience; for hitherto, Almightie God hath not enabled me to find anie out; &amp; if he had, I would haue been very glad, to vſe it; for it torments me (as I ſayd) very often. But in this, is our miſerie made appa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rant to vs; and ſo alſo doth the power of Almightie God ſhine very clearly in it, ſince this Facultie of the Soule, which is looſe, can put vs to ſo much trouble, and ſo tire vs, whilſt yet thoſe other, which are employed, and doe attend ſo neer to his Diuine Maieſtie, make vs feele ſo much eaſe, &amp; ioy.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="213" facs="tcp:100776:143"/>
The laſt Remedie, vpon which I haue falne, after my hauing wearied my ſelf manie yeares, is that, whereof I ſpoke, in Quiet Prayer; That we ſhould make no more account therof, then we would, of ſome ſtarke-madd-Foole; but to let it ſtill alone, in telling that impertinent idle Tale, wherein God only can impoſe ſilence. And ſince, in fine, it remaines to vs heer, in the nature of a Slaue, we muſt be content to endure it, as <hi>Iacob,</hi> did <hi>Lya;</hi> for our Lord doth vs Fauour enough, to permitt, that we may enioy <hi>Rachel.</hi> I ſay, that it remaines as a Slaue; by reaſon, that it cannot draw the other Powers, or Faculties to it, how vehe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mently ſoeuer it may ſtriue, but rather, they draw it often to them, without anie difficultie at all. Yea, and ſometimes our Lord is pleaſed to haue pittie, to ſee euen the Imagination it ſelf, ſo very much diſquieted, and loſt, through deſire to be in companie with the other Faculties, and Powers of the Minde; and then, his Diuine Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ieſtie is content, that it alſo, may be burnt vp, in the fire of that Diuine Taper, where thoſe others are already euen conſumed to duſt; and where (hauing, as it were, euen loſt their Naturall Being) they are enioying ſo great Bleſſings, in a Superna<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turall kind.</p>
            <p>In all theſe wayes, of this laſt Fountaine-Water, whereof I haue ſpoken, the peacefull reſt, and glorie of the Soule, is ſo great, that euen the Bodie doth very manifeſtly participate of that ioy, and delight; I ſay, it doth ſo, very manifeſtly; yea, and
<pb n="214" facs="tcp:100776:144"/>
the vertues alſo of the Minde, encreaſe, and grow ſtronger, as I haue ſayd.</p>
            <p>And now it ſeemes to me, that our Lord hath declared theſe States of Prayer, wherein the Soule may diſcerne her ſelf, as farre, as ſhe can be giuen to be vnderſtood heer. And your Reuerence ſhall doe well, to conferr about it, with ſome ſuch Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rituall perſon, (who may be learned) as ſhall haue ariued, thus farre. And if he tell you, that all is well, you may conceaue, that God hath ſayd it to you; and eſteem it, as a great benefit, from his Diuine Maieſtie; for you will, in tract of time, reioyce (as I haue ſayd) very much, to vnderſtand in cleare manner, what it is; though now, whilſt you haue the grace to enioy it, he allowes you not the Fauour, to vnderſtand it ſo. But, as his Diuine Maieſtie hath giuen you the firſt part, which is the enioying: ſo you will afterward, perhaps, by your knowledge, and learning, come alſo to vnder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtand it, by this meanes. Let him be adored, and praiſed, for the eternitie of all eternities,</p>

            <argument>
               <p>She treats of the Fourth Degree of Prayer. She beginnes heer to declare, in excellent manner, the great dignitie, to vvhich our Lord aduances that Soule, vvhich is exal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted to this State. It ſerues to animate men much, to endeauour, that they may ariue to ſo high a condition, ſince it may be obtained in this vvorld, through the goodnes of our Lord, though it cannot be deſerued. Let this be read, vvith conſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deration, and care.</p>
            </argument>
            <p>I Beſeech our Lord, that he will teach me, how to vſe ſome words, and way of ſpeech, which may enable me, to ſay ſomewhat, of this Fourth Water; for I well diſcerne, that I haue need enough of his Fauour heerin; euen yet more, then I had in that of the laſt; becauſe in that, the Soule doth find her ſelfe, not to be wholy dead; and ſo we may very well ſay, that ſhe is not dead, becauſe ſhe remaines ſtill in the world; but ſtill (as I affir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med) ſhe hath ſufficient vnderſtanding, to know, that ſhe is ſtill, heer; and that ſhe findes the So<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>litude, wherein ſhe is; &amp; ſerues her ſelf, to ſome proportion, of the exteriour; at leaſt ſo farre, as, by outward ſignes, to giue that, which ſhe feeles,
<pb n="216" facs="tcp:100776:145"/>
to be vnderſtood. In all that kind of Prayer, and in the manner alſo of it, which hath been deſcri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bed, the Gardner labours to ſome proportion; though yet, in the Prayer of theſe latter kindes, his labour goes accompanied with ſo much ioy, and ſuch a happie kind of eaſe, as that, for his part, he findes no trouble at all, in it; for he con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiders it not as Trouble, but as Glorie; and he would be glad, that it might neuer end. But in this Fourth Degree, or kind of Prayer, there is no ſuffering left at all, but only enioying; though yet, without anie diſtinct particular vnderſtand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, of what is enioyed. He knowes well enough; that a certaine Good, is enioyed, wherein all good things are contained, and shut-vp; but yet this Good, is not totally comprehended by him. All the Senſes are taken vp, vpon the finding, and feeling of this ioy; in ſuch ſort, as no one of them, is ſo diſ-employed, as that it can poſſibly attend to anie thing els, either in the exteriour, or interiour way. Before, a certaine leaue, or liber<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie was giuen to theſe Powers, that they might be able, to make ſome kind of demonſtration, of the great ioy, they felt; but heer, the Soule enioyes much more, beyond compariſon; and can giue her ſelf alſo to be vnderſtood, much leſſe. Becauſe there is no meanes left in the Bodie; nor yet hath the Soule anie at all, wherewith to com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>municate that ioy; but, all things would then, be diſturbance, and euen torment to her; yea, and diſtraction, from the entirenes of her ſweet repoſe.
<pb n="217" facs="tcp:100776:145"/>
I ſay, the Soule is no way able, to communicate the ioy ſhe hath, if indeed there be an abſolute, and entire Vnion, of all the three Powers togea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, for as long as that Vnion laſts; and that alſo, if ſhe be able to communicate it, I ſay, there is no abſolute Vnion. In what manner this thing happens, which they call Vnion, and what the thing alſo is, I am not able to giue to be vnder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtood. It is declared in that, which they call Myſticall Theologie; but as for me, I am not able, ſo much as to name euen the tearmes. Nor doe I know, what that is, which is called <hi>Minde;</hi> nor the difference between <hi>Minde,</hi> and <hi>Soule;</hi> nor what alſo, is <hi>Spirit;</hi> for, to me, all theſe ſeuerall things, ſeem to be but one; though yet the Soule, now and then, ſpring-vp euen out of her ſelf, as if it were a kind of fire, which is burning vp, in a flame; and ſometimes this fire encreaſes, with a kind of impetuoſitie. Now this flame, riſes very much higher, then doth the fire; but yet ſtill, not<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>withſtanding all that, it is no diſtinct thing, from the verie fire; but it is the flame it ſelf, which ſtill, is in the fire. Your Reuerence will vnderſtand this matter, by your learning; but as for me, I know not, how to declare it better. For my part, the thing, which I pretend to declare, is, what the Soule finds, and feeles, when it is in this Diuine Vnion; for, as for the knowing, what an Vnion, in generall, is, it is euerie where vnderſtood, well enough, to be, when two ſeuerall things, become one.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="218" facs="tcp:100776:146"/>
O my deare Lord! and how good art thou? Bleſſed be thou for euer; and let all things praiſe thee, O my God, who haſt been pleaſed, to loue vs in ſuch ſort, as that we may be able, to ſpeake with truth, of this kind of communication, which thou vouchſafeſt to hold with Soules, euen in this banniſhment of ours; which, although they were neuer ſo holie, and good, yet this latitude of liber<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>alitie, and magnificence of thine, were great, in proceeding with them after this manner. But, in fine, it is all thine owne Maieſtie, and Greatnes, who giueſt, after the rate, of what thou art. O in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>finit latitude of Bountie! and how magnificent are thy workes? They are able, euen to amaze anie ſuch perſon, as hath not his Vnderſtanding wholy employed, vpon the things of this world; and who hath left himſelf no roome, both for the knowing, and conſidering ſuch things, as are reall truths. But now, that thou ſhouldſt be pleaſed, to faſten ſuch Soueraine Fauours vpon Soules, which haue offended thee ſo much, doth really, euen make an end of my verie Vnderſtanding; and when once, I come to conſider of this proceeding of thine, I am euen vnable to paſſe on, anie further. But indeed, how can anie Creature goe anie whither, in this caſe, which ſhall not be, a meer comeing back againe; ſince no Soule can euer know, how to giue thee anie tolerable thankes, for ſo incom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parable Fauours? As for me, I help my ſelf ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times, with ſpeaking certaine impertinencies, which haue neither head, nor foot; and it often
<pb n="219" facs="tcp:100776:146"/>
happens to me, both when I come from receauing theſe Fauours, and when alſo our Lord is be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginning to impart them (for, as for the verie time, when I am enioying them, I haue already ſhewed, that there is then, no power at all, to doe anie thing) that I expreſſe my ſelf to his Diuine Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ieſtie, much after this manner: O Lord, conſider well, what thou doſt; forget not my ſo very greiuous Sinnes ſo very ſoone; and though thou haue forgotten them, ſo farre, as to vouchſafe to forgiue them, yet remember them alſo (I humbly beſeech thee) ſo farre, as to make thee put ſome limits vpon thoſe Fauours, which thou art pleaſed to beſtow vpon me. Powre not, O my Creatour, ſo pretious a liquour as that, into ſo broken a veſſell as this; ſince already, thou haſt ſeen, how often I haue ſcattered, and ſpilt it. O lodge not, and truſt not, ſuch a treaſure as this, where the appetite, and affection, to all the conſolations of this life, is not yet ſo totally loſt, and ſpent, as it ought to be; for, if thou doe, it will be vtterly waſted. How canſt thou find in thy hart, to deliuer the ſtrength of this Cittie, and euen the verie keyes of the Fort, into the hands of ſuch a co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wardlie Commander, who is likelie not to faile, to giue the Enemie entrance, vpon the firſt Aſſault, which he ſhall make. Let not, O my Eternal King, thy loue to me, be ſo great, as that it ſhould make thee put ſuch pretious Iewels as theſe, into hazard. And to me, it ſeemes, O my Lord, that thou mayſt giue the world occaſion
<pb n="220" facs="tcp:100776:147"/>
heerby, to vndervalue theſe great Fauours of thine; ſince thou putteſt them into the cuſtodie, and power, of a Creature, who is ſo wicked, ſo baſe, ſo weake, ſo miſerable, and of ſo little worth, in anie kinde. Who, though I now beginne to labour, that I may not vtterly looſe them, through thy fauour (which alſo hath no need to be little, conſidering, what kind of thing I am) ſhall yet be neuer able, to gaine anie other Creature to thee, by meanes thereof. In fine, I am a woeman, and no good woeman, but a very wicked one; and it ſeemes, that theſe Talents of thine, are thus, not only to be hidden, by this meanes, but euen to be quite buried vp; ſince thou putteſt them into ſo vngratious, and vnluckie a Soyle. Thou art not wont, O Lord, to impart ſuch Fauours, and Greatneſſes as theſe, to anie Soule, but when there may be hope, that ſhe will be able to gaine manie others, to thy Seruice. And thou knoweſt, O my God, already, that I haue, ſometimes, begged this Fauour; and ſtill I begg it of thee, with my whole hart, and with the entire affection thereof; and I am reſolued to thinke it fitt, to be content, to looſe the higheſt bleſſing, which can poſſibly be enioyed vpon earth, to the end, that thou maiſt vouchſafe it to ſome other, who will profit more by it; that ſo, thine owne glorie may be encreaſed.</p>
            <p>Both theſe, and ſuch other things, as theſe, hath it occurred to me, to vtter manie times; but yet afterward, I perceaued mine owne great follie heerin, togeather with my little humilitie;
<pb n="221" facs="tcp:100776:147"/>
for, our Lord knowes very well, what is fitteſt for euerie Creature; and, that there was not to be ſtrength enough, in my Soule, whereby ſhe might euer grow, to be ſaued, if his Diuine Maieſtie had not enriched her, with ſo great Fauours.</p>
            <p>But I alſo now pretend to declare, the graces, and effects, <note n="*" place="margin">The great ef<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fects of this high Prayer.</note> which remaine by this Prayer, in the Soule; and what that is, which ſhe may be able to doe, of her ſelf; and, if ſhe may, anie way, conduce, towards the bringing her ſelf, to this high State. It happens, that this Eleuation of the Spirit, or Vnion, come, both of them, with a Celeſtiall kind of Loue. For (according to my way of vnderſtanding) this <note n="*" place="margin">The dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ference betvvee<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> Eleuatio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, and Vnion.</note> Vnion, is a different things from Eleuation; though yet the Soule be eleuated, in this verie Vnion. Whoſoeuer hath not tried, and felt this laſt, will be of a different conceipt; but yet, in my opinion, though euen it ſhould be all one, yet our Lord workes therin, after a different manner; And, by the encreaſe, which the Soule hath, of being able to vntye her ſelf from the loue of all Creatures, ſhe ſeemes to be very much greater, in that Flight, and Eleua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of the Spirit. And I haue clearly ſeen, that this is a diſtinct, and particular Fauour, although the things themſelues, may be all one, as I ſay; or at leaſt, may ſeem ſo. But a ſmall fire, is as truly, and really, Fire, as a great one; and yet ſtill, we ſee difference enough, between the one, and the other; for, before a little iron can be able to be made red hot, in a ſmall fire, a good ſpace of time
<pb n="222" facs="tcp:100776:148"/>
will be ſpent; but now, if the fire be great, the iron, though it be alſo great, will looſe the appa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rance of iron, very quickly. Iuſt ſo, doth it ſeem to me, to happen in theſe two ſorts of Fauours from our Bleſſed Lord; and I know, that who<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſoeuer may euer haue ariued, to be in Rapt, will vnderſtand me well; but ſuch as haue had no ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perience therin, will hold all that, to be imperti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nent, which I haue ſayd. Perhaps alſo it is ſo indeed; and ſo, as he will haue had reaſon, who beleiues it. For, how ſhall ſuch a thing, as I, pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſume to ſpeake of ſuch a thing as this; and to giue ſome part of that, to be vnderſtood, which it ſeemes impoſſible, euen to beginne to declare, with anie words? So that it is not ſtrange, a whitt, if I talke idly. But yet I beleiue this, of our Bleſſed Lord (becauſe his Diuine Maieſtie knowes, that, next to this act of Obedience, my intention is no other, then to make Soules, euen, as it were, gluttonous, after the obtaining of ſo high a good) that he will be pleaſed, to aſſiſt me heerin; and I am ſure, I will ſay nothing, whereof I haue not had much experience. And it is a reall truth, that when I beganne to write of this Water, I concea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ued it to be a more impoſſible thing, for me to treat of it, then to ſpeake Greeke; ſo very hard, did I finde it. Vpon this, I gaue it ouer, and went to receaue the Bleſſed Sacrament. But our Lord be euer praiſed, who doth ſo great Fauours to ignorant perſons. O vertue of Obedience, which art able to doe all things! For, Almightie God did

illuminate my vnderſtanding, ſometimes, by helping me to the verie expreſſe words, which I was to vſe; and, at other times, by repreſenting the manner to me, how I ſhould declare the thing; So that, as his Diuine Maieſtie was pleaſed to doe, in the former Degree of Prayer, it ſeemes, that he will alſo heer declare, what I neither can, nor know, how to expreſſe. But that which now I ſay, is a moſt literall truth; and ſo, that which ſhall be good, is his inſtruction, and doctrine; and whatſoeuer falls-out to be ill, it is cleare, that it proceeds, and flowes, from this deep Sea of mischeif, and Sinne, which is my ſelf. And there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore I heer affirme, that if anie haue ariued to theſe points, and particulars of Prayer, wherein our Lord hath done ſo great Fauour, to this miſerable, and wretched Creature, (as it is like<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lie, that there are manie) if they ſhall be pleaſed, to treat of theſe things with me, as conceauing, that I am miſtaken, and out of the way, our Lord will ſo aſſiſt this poore Seruant of his, as that ſhe may be able, to goe forward, to vphold this truth.</p>
            <p>But now, to ſpeake of this laſt Water, which comes from Heauen, to ſatisfye, and euen fulfill the whole Garden, by the abundance therof; if our Lord did neuer forbeare to giue it, whenſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>euer there were need, it is euident enough already, of what caſe it would be to the Gardner, and that there would neuer be anie Winter, but alwaies moſt temperate weather; nor would there euer, be anie want, either of Fruits, or
<pb n="224" facs="tcp:100776:149"/>
Flowers; and ſo it may be eaſily ſeen, in what delight he would remaine. But, as long as we liue in this world, this condition is a kind of impoſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble thing; and we muſt alwaies be in care, that whenſoeuer we ſhall want one of the Waters, we may procure another. This laſt, which falls from Heauen, comes downe ſometimes, euen when the Gardner thinkes of it leaſt. True it is, that theſe things are almoſt euer wont to happen, after a long exerciſe of Mentall Prayer. For, our Lord vſes to come, by degrees, to catch this poore little Bird, and to lodge it then, ſafely, in the Neſt; to the end, that it may reſt, and repoſe. And after it had put it ſelf long, vpon Flights, procuring, by the exerciſe of the Vnderſtanding, and Will, and, in fine, by all the Powers it had, to goe in ſearch of Almightie God, and to pleaſe him, he vouchſafes to allow it a reward, euen in this life; yea, and this, ſo very great a reward, that anie one little moment therof, may well ſuffice, as a full ſatisfaction, and retribution, for all that care, and trouble, which he could euer haue endured, in this world.</p>
            <p>The Soule being thus, in ſearch of Almightie God, doth find her ſelf, as it were, euen ſinke, vnder a ſweet, and moſt exceſſiue delight; as be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing all, in a certaine way of deare faynting; ſo that the breath is euen beginning to faile, and ſo alſo, doth all corporall ſtrength; in ſuch ſort, as that the Creature is now not able, ſo much, as to moue her hands, but with much paine. The eyes
<pb n="225" facs="tcp:100776:149"/>
are alſo cloſed, though without anie purpoſe to ſhut them; and when, by accident, they chance to be open, ſhe, in effect, ſees nothing diſtinctly; nor, if ſhe reade, can ſhe ſo much as iudge rightly of anie letter; nor can ſhe euen gueſſe, how to name it right. She ſees, that indeed, there are letters; but, the Vnderſtanding not giuing her anie aſſiſtance, ſhe knowes not how to reade, though ſhe would. She heares, but yet vnderſtands not, what ſhe heares; ſo that ſhe receaues no other be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nefit at all, by her Senſes, but only, that they will not permit her, to take the full fruition of her delight; and ſo, vpon the matter, they doe her more hurt, then good. As for ſpeaking, it is a vani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie, ſo much as to thinke of anie ſuch thing; for ſhe cannot poſſibly hitt right, ſo much as in framing anie one word; nor, if ſhe were able to iudge it, were ſhe yet poſſibly able, to pronounce it; in regard, that all the ſtrength of her Bodie, is abſolutly loſt, for the greater encreaſe of that, of her Soule, that ſo, ſhe may the better enioy her glorie. The exteriour delight alſo, which ſhe feeles, is both great, and very certaine.</p>
            <p>This Prayer puts the perſon to no manner of inconuenience in anie kinde, how long ſoeuer it may laſt; at leaſt, it neuer put me to anie; nor am I able to remember, (when our Lord did me this Fauour) how ſick, or weake ſoeuer I were, that I euer found my ſelf the worſe; but rather, with much improuement, euen in the way of health. But indeed, what hurt can euer be done to anie
<pb n="226" facs="tcp:100776:150"/>
Creature, by ſo great a bleſſing, as this? It is ſo knowne a truth, concerning the exteriour opera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions, that there can no doubt be made, but that there were natually great occaſions, for their al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teration, ſince our Lord tooke all their ſtrength from them, though yet it were with ſo great de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>light, that the ſame grew afterward, to be greater.</p>
            <p>It is true, that in the beginning, this ſtate, and feeling, is wont to paſſe away, in very ſhort time; at leaſt, it hapned ſo, to me. But, as for theſe exte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riour ſignes, as alſo in this failing of operation in the Senſes, it is not ſo eaſily to be giuen to be vnderſtood, when things paſſe away in ſhort time; but yet they are diſcerned with eaſe, by the exceſſe of the Fauours. For, the clearnes, and heat of the Sunne, muſt needs haue been then, very great, when all that, which came in the way, was ſo abſolutly melted, and diſſolued.</p>
            <p>Let this alſo be well noted, that, in my opinion, how long ſoeuer that ſpace of time might ſeem to be, wherein all the Powers of the Soule were in ſuſpenſe, it muſt needs haue been indeed, very ſhort; and, if it ſhould ariue, to half an hower, it were very much. For my part, I thinke I was neuer ſo long. True it is, that one can hardly iudge, how long they are, ſince the Parties are depriued of outward ſenſe: but I ſay, that it muſt needs be a very ſhort time, wherein no one of the Powers, can be able to returne againe, to it ſelf.</p>
            <p>But now, the Will is, indeed, the onlie Power, which maintaines the Worke; for, as for the other
<pb n="227" facs="tcp:100776:150"/>
two, they quickly become importunate vpon her. Yet the Will remaining quiet, and fixed, ſuſpends them yet againe; and ſo they ſtay another little while; and afterward returne to liue, as before.</p>
            <p>In this manner, ſome whole howers of Prayer, may be paſſed; yea and ſometimes, they are paſſed ſo. For, when the two Powers of the Soule, haue taſted of that Celeſtiall wine, and beginne to be inebriated with it, they eaſily are induced to looſe themſelues, once againe, ſo to get ſtill, the more, by the bargaine; and ſo they goe to accompanie the Will; and all three, come to be in the act of enioying. But this point of being totally loſt, and ſo without framing anie Imagination at all (which Power, in my way of vnderſtanding, is alſo wholy loſt) I ſay, laſts but a very little time; though yet they come not alwaies, ſo wholy to themſelues, vpon a ſuddaine, but that they may remaine, euen ſome howers, as in a kind of being, ſtill, a little out of the way, and in diſorder; Almightie God vouchſafing, to recollect them againe to himſelf, by little, and little.</p>
            <p>And now let vs come to the interiour of that, which the Soule is wont to feele, at theſe times; and let them declare it, who know how; ſince it cannot be well vnderſtood, and much leſſe ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſed. I was thinking, (when I diſpoſed my ſelf to write this, (as ſoone as I had receaued the B. Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crament, and after the end of this verie kinde of Prayer, which now I write) of what the Soule did, at that time. And our Lord ſayd this to me, in theſe
<pb n="228" facs="tcp:100776:151"/>
words: <hi>It doth, my Daughter, diſſolue, and defeat it ſelf, to be ſo, the more ingulfed in me; for novv it is no longer she, vvho liues, but I; and ſince she cannot co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>prehend that, vvhich she vnderſtands, her very vnderſtanding it, after a kind of Morrall vvay, vvhich she doth, is really a not vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtanding it, after a ſtrict, &amp; comprehenſiue vvay, vvhich she is not able to doe.</hi> He who ſhall haue had triall of this, by experience, will be able to ariue to the ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſion of ſome part therof; but, as for me, I cannot deliuer that, more clearly, which paſſes heer, ſince it is ſo very obſcure. I can only ſay, that, in this caſe, their being then, ſo cloſe to Almightie God, is repreſented to them; and there remaines ſuch a kinde of certaintie therof, that it cannot poſſibly faile, to be beleiued.</p>
            <p>And now heer, all the Powers of the Soule fall ſhort of operation, and are ſuſpended, in ſuch ſort, that, by no meanes (as I haue ſayd) it can poſſibly be vnderſtood, that they worke. If ſhe were thinking of ſome Myſterie, it is inſtantly ſo for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gotte<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, as if there had neuer bee<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> anie ſuch thought. If ſhe were reading, there is no remembrance of it; nor yet of pawſing; and if praying vocally, in like manner. So that now, this importunate little Gnatt of the Memorie, hath her wings burnt heer, and can now no longer ſpring-vp, nor ſtirre. The Will alſo, is now employed, all, in louing; though it vnderſta<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>d not, how it loues. The Vnderſtanding, if it vnderſtand, it is not yet vnderſtood, how it vnderſtands; and, at leaſt, it can comprehend nothing of that, which it vnderſtands. To me, it
<pb n="229" facs="tcp:100776:151"/>
doth not ſeem, that it vnderſtands; becauſe (as I was ſaying) it is not vnderſtood; and, for my part, I attaine not, to vnderſtand all this.</p>
            <p>At the firſt, I chanced to be in ſo great an igno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rance, as not to know, that Almightie God, was in all things; and conſidering, how very preſent, I conceiued him to be to me, it ſeemed impoſſible for me, to beleiue the co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>trarie. To leaue therefore to beleiue that he was there, I could not; becauſe it ſeemed to me, as it were, apparantly, and clearly, that I had vnderſtood his verie Preſence to be there. Some men, who were not learned, told me, that he was only there, by his Grace; which ſtill, I could not poſſibly beleiue; becauſe, as I was ſaying, I held him to be directly preſent otherwiſe; and thus I co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>tinued, with ſome trouble. But, at length, a great learned man of the Order of the Glorious S. Dominick, freed me from this doubt; and told me, not only, that he was preſent, but that he alſo communicated himſelf to vs; which comforted me very much.</p>
            <p>But now, it is heer to be noted, and vnderſtood, that this Celeſtiall Water, is alwaies a moſt emi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nent Fauour of our Lord, and giues the Soule ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſiuely great aduantages; as I ſhall now declare.</p>

               <p>She proſecutes the ſame Diſcourſe; and be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginnes to declare the effects, vvhich this Degree of Prayer, vvorkes in the Soule. She perſvvades men earnestly, not to turne back, nor to giue-ouer their Prayer, though they should happen to fall, euen after they had receaued theſe Fauours. She ſpeakes of the great harme, vvhich vvill ariue to them, if they doe othervviſe. This Diſcourſe is much to be noted; and it is of great conſolation, for vveake perſons, and Sinners.</p>
            </argument>
            <p>THe Soule doth, in this Prayer, and Vnion, re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maine with an exceſſiue kind of tendernes; in ſuch ſort, that ſhe would faine, euen defeat, and diſſolue her ſelf; not through paine, or trouble, but by abundance of teares of ioy, wherein ſhe is bathed, without ſo much, as feeling, or knowing, how, or when ſhe wept them. It giues her a great delight, to find the impetuous force of that fire, appeaſed, and allayed by Water; which yet makes it encreaſe ſo much the more. This language of mine, may ſeem to be a kind of gibberidge; but yet, thus ſtands the caſe.</p>
            <p>It hath hapned to me ſometimes, when I was
<pb n="231" facs="tcp:100776:152"/>
in this part of this Prayer, to be ſo <note n="*" place="margin">She pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceeds in declaring the great effects of this high Prayer.</note> wholy out of my ſelf, as that I knew not, whether I were awake, or aſleep; or whether, in verie deed, I had been in that glorie, which I felt; and whether it were true, that I was indeed, ſo, all bathed in water, which diſtilled with ſuch force, and ſpeed, from mine eyes, that it ſeemed, as if a very Clowde of Heauen had rayned it downe; but, in fine, I found that it was no dreame. This hapned to be in the be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginnings of this Prayer; and it paſſed quickly ouer. But the Soule remaines ſo couragious thereby, that, if it were poſſible for her to be cut into a thouſand peices for God's ſake, it would be of extreame conſolation to her. And now, heer come in, all her promiſes; her heroicall reſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lutions; the liuelie efficacie of her deſires; her be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginning to abhorre the world; her clearlie diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerning her owne vanitie; and all this, much more perfectly, and more highly, then it hapned in anie of her former Prayers. Her humilitie is alſo growne much ſtronger; for now, ſhe very clearly diſcernes, that no diligence at all, of her owne, was anie peice of a cauſe, for bringing her that exceſſiue, and incomparable Fauour; nor for making her enioy the ſame. She ſees now clearly, that ſhe is a moſt vnworthie Creature; for, in anie roome, where there enters a ſtrong, and cleare Sunne-Beame, there is not the leaſt, and thinneſt Cobweb, which can lye hid. She now lookes very clearly, vpon her owne miſerie; and now ſhe is ſo very free from Vaine-Glorie, that it ſeems a kind
<pb n="232" facs="tcp:100776:153"/>
of impoſſible thing, for her to haue anie; becauſe now already, ſhe hath it euen in her verie eye, how little ſhe is able to performe; or rather, in verie deed, that it is, iuſt nothing at all; and that, in this caſe, there was hardly ſo much, as anie co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ſent of hers; but that it ſeems, that euen, whether ſhe would, or no, they ſhut the gates of all her Senſes, vp; to the end, that she might ſo, the better enioy her Lord; and that now, ſince she remaines all alone with him, what can she haue to doe, but to loue him? She neither can ſee, nor heare, vnleſſe she be made to doe ſo, as it were, by very ſtrong hand; and therefore, there is little, for which, to thanke her. Her former life, growes then, to be repreſented to her, with perfect truth; togeather with the great mercie of Almightie God. And all this, occurrs to her, without anie neceſſitie at all, that her Vnderſtanding should now, goe hunting after it. For there, doth she already find all this kind of food, readie dreſſed, for her, to vnderſta<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>d, and eat. Of her ſelf, she ſees very well, that she deſerues Hell-Fire; and that now, in ſtead therof, they giue her no other puniſhment, then glorie. And therefore ſhe doth now, euen conſume her ſelf, in the prayſes of Almightie God; and now would I be glad, euen to conſume my ſelf ſo. Bleſſed be thou, O my Lord, who haſt, in ſuch ſort, vouchſafed, to make ſo filthie a Fiſh-Pond, as I was, become ſo pure, and cleare a water, as that it may ſerue for thine owne Table. Be thou adored, and praiſed, O thou Regalo of the Angels, who
<pb n="233" facs="tcp:100776:153"/>
haſt vouchſafed, thus to exalt ſo baſe a worme.</p>
            <p>This profit of the Soule, remaines, for ſome time, therin; and now ſhe can already vnderſtand clearly enough, that the Fruit is none of her owne; and ſhe beginns to giue part of it to others, without euer feeling anie want of it her ſelf. She now beginns alſo, to giue ſignes, and apparances, of being the owner of ſome ſuch Soule, as it to be a Iewel-Houſe, fitt for the Treaſures of Heauen; and to carrie great deſires, of making others partake them; and humbly to beſeech Almightie God, that ſhe may not be alone, in poſſeſſing them. She beginns now, to profit her Neighbours, without almoſt vnder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtanding it her ſelf, and without her ſeeming to doe anie thing therin; but they, who receaue the benefit, vnderſtand it well. For already, doe thoſe Flowers yeild ſo high, and apparant a Sent, that it inuites all the world, to come neer them. They know, that ſhe hath great Vertues; and they ſee, that the Fruit is very tempting; and they would faine help her to eat it.</p>
            <p>And now, if the earth of this Garden be manured, and digged-vp very deep, with Perſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cutions, with Detractions, and with Sicknes; (as there are few, who ariue thus farre, without theſe things) and if alſo, it be very cleane ſtripped of all proper Intereſt, the Water ſinkes ſo very deeply, into this Soyle, that it will ſcarce be euer dry againe. But yet, if it be ſuch a kind of earth, as that (with being earth) it haue alſo, ſuch a
<pb n="234" facs="tcp:100776:154"/>
quantitie, and companie of thornes, as I remained with, in the beginning; and, if it want a rooting<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out of the occaſions of ill, and is not withall, ſo gratefull, as ſo high a Fauour requires, that Soyle growes againe, to be dry. And, in that caſe, if the Gardner proue negligent, and ſlack, and if out Lord, through his owne onlie goodnes, doe not againe reſolue, to beſtow raine vpon it, you may well giue this Garden, for deſtroyed, and loſt. For iuſt thus, did it happen to me, ſeuerall times; and really, I am euen amazed, to reflect vpon it; yea, and it were not poſſible for me, to beleiue it, if the caſe had not been wholy mine owne.</p>
            <p>But now I write thus much, for the comfort of ſuch Soules, as are weake, like mine; to the end, that they may neuer deſpaire, nor ſo much, as once leaue, to haue confidence, in the greatnes of Almightie God; and that, <note n="*" place="margin">A Co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
                  <g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſidera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of ſtrange comfort.</note> although they ſhould fall, euen after our Lord had brought them, to ſo incomparable Fauours as are mentio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned heer, they muſt not yet deſpaire, vnleſſe they will be totally loſt; for, there is nothing, which will not be gotten with teares; and ſo, the employing of one Water, will be the meanes of getting another.</p>
            <p>One of the things, by which I haue been animated (with being that miſerable Creature, which I am) to write this Diſcourſe, and to giue this kind of account, of my wicked Life, and of the Fauours, which our Lord hath been pleaſed to doe me, (and that, not whilſt I was ſeruing
<pb n="235" facs="tcp:100776:154"/>
him, but offending him) hath been this. And really, I wiſh now, that I were ſome perſon of great authoritie, that ſo I might be the better beleiued, in this particular; and I humbly beſeech the Diuine Maieſtie of my deare Lord, that he will beſtow this Fauour vpon me. I ſay then, that no one, euen of thoſe Creatures, who haue begunne, to vſe Mentall Prayer, is to be diſmayed with ſaying: If I ſhould returne to be wicked againe, it would be worſe for me, to goe forward with the vſe of Prayer. For, the thing, which I beleiue, is, that it will be worſe, if he giue-ouer his Prayer, and forbeare to reforme his life. But, if he ſhall not giue-ouer his Prayer, let him be confident, that it will bring him againe, to the Port, where he ſhall be able to ſee the Lanterne, and ariue ſafe. The Diuel made ſo feirce batterie againſt me, and I paſſed ſo long, without Prayer, (as conceauing, that, being ſo wicked, as I was, it would be an act of more humilitie, to deſiſt from it) that I gaue it ouer, for about a yeare, and a halfe, or for a yeare at leaſt; for, of the half yeare, I remember it not, ſo very preciſely. But this was likelie to be, and was then, indeed, no other thing, then for me to put my ſelf euen into Hell, without needing anie Diuels, for that purpoſe.</p>
            <p>O my deare Lord, how great is that blindnes, and how vnhappily doth the Diuel hitt right, for his purpoſe, in laying ſo heauie a loade vpon vs, heerin? The Traytour knowes very well, that he hath loſt that Soule, which continues, with perſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uerance,
<pb n="236" facs="tcp:100776:155"/>
in Prayer; and that all thoſe Falls, which he procures to giue vs, will but aſſiſt vs, through the goodnes of Almightie God, to make, after<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards, the greater leape, towards his Seruice. The Diuel, I ſay, knowes very well, how much this imports him. But, O my deare Ieſus, what a thing it is, to ſee a Soule, in this State, falne-back <note n="*" place="margin">This is ſtrange indeed.</note> to Sinne, when yet thou, by thy mercie, doſt lend him, that hand of thine, to riſe againe? O, how will ſuch an one, come to know, the multi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tude of thy greatneſſes, and mercies; togeather with his owne miſerie? Heer comes this Crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture in, to vnderſtand thy Maieſticall way; and to annihilate himſelf, in good earneſt. Heer is the Soule, not once preſuming, ſo much, as to lift her eyes vp, to Heauen, though yet ſhe raiſe her thoughts, to conſider the vnſpeakable obligation, which ſhe hath to thee. She heer, growes all de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uoted, to the Queen of Heauen, that ſhe may helpe to appeaſe thee. Heer, ſhe inuokes thoſe Saints, who fell, after thou hadſt once called them, to thy Seruice; to the end, that ſhe may be aſſiſted by them. Heer, ſhe conceaues, and finds, that whatſoeuer Croſſes thou ſend her, they are all of them, too eaſie, and light; becauſe ſhe ſees already, that ſhe deſerues not the verie ground, vpon which ſhe goes. Heer, enters the frequent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the Sacraments of the Church, and that vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gorous Liuelie Faith, which now remaines in her hart, as ſeing the great power, and vertue, which God infuſed into it. The praiſing thee, for
<pb n="237" facs="tcp:100776:155"/>
hauing left ſuch Vnguents, and other Medicines, for the cure of our Sores; which cloſe not only the skinne, but take them vtterly away. In a word, ſhe is amazed, at all theſe things; and who, O thou Lord of my Soule, is not to be amazed, at ſo great mercie, and at ſuch an ouerflowing kind of Fauour, vpon our Treaſons, which are ſo abominable, and fowle, that, for my part, I cannot vnderſtand, how my hart comes not, euen to ſplitt, when I write thus much; becauſe I find my ſelf ſo very wicked? And yet, the while, it ſeemes, as if I had a minde, to make thee a kind of recompence, &amp; ſatisfaction, for ſo many fowle Treaſons, as I haue committed againſt thee, by theſe few, poore, little teares of mine, which yet are giuen mee, by thy ſelfe; and which really, for my part thereof, are but as ſo much water of a ſtinkeing Well. For, ſtill I am committing Sinnes, &amp; procuring to fruſtrate, &amp;, euen as it were, annihilate the Fauours, which thou haſt done me. But, be thou pleaſed, O my Deare Lord, to giue vallew to theſe poore teares, and doe thou pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rifye this ſo troubled Water of my Soule, though it ſhould be for no other reaſon, then only to keep men free, from the temptation of making raſh iudgements; as, for my part, I haue been ſubiect to this thought. Why, O Lord, doſt thou paſſe ouer thoſe other holie people, who haue alwaies ſerued, and ſuffered for thee; and haue been bred-vp, in the way of a Religious Life; and are, indeed, truly Religious; and not like me, who
<pb n="248" facs="tcp:100776:156"/>
had no more therof, then the name; And yet, I clearly ſee, that thou didſt them not thoſe Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uours, which thou haſt done me. But yet heer, I diſcerne very well, O thou my eternall Good, that thou keepeſt their reward in ſtore, that ſo thou maiſt giue it them, all togeather; and that my weaknes, is ſo great, that I had need to be proceeded with, thus; whereas they, like gallant perſons, are content, to ſerue thee ſtill, without theſe helps; and ſo thou treateſt them, as valiant people, who haue no intereſt of their owne.</p>
            <p>But yet I, with all this, O my Lord, cryed-out manie times, before thee, excuſing them, who murmured againſt me; becauſe I thought, they had too much reaſon, for what they ſayd. But this occurred to me, O Lord, when, already, through thy goodnes, thou with-heldſt me, from offending thee ſo highly, anie more; and when I went diuerting my ſelf from all that, which I thought might diſpleaſe thee. For, when once I beganne to doe but thus much, thou alſo didſt beginne to open thy Treaſures, towards this Seruant of thine; and, it ſeemes, thou didſt expect nothing els, but only, that there might be an in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clination in me, to receaue them; ſo quickly didſt thou beginne, not only to beſtow them, but to be pleaſed, that the world ſhould vnderſtand it. When this was once perceaued, ſome beganne to hold a good opinion of me; though all had not yet knowne well, how ill I was; and that, much of it did then half appeare. But then, did De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>traction,
<pb n="239" facs="tcp:100776:156"/>
and Perſecution beginne, at a clapp; and, in my opinion, not without much cauſe. And therefore, I vndertooke no enmitie againſt anie Creature; but only beſought thy Diuine Maieſtie, to conſider, what little reaſon they had. They ſayd, that I had a minde, to make my ſelf a Saint; and that I inuented certaine Nouelties, though I had not ariued yet, by a great deale, to fulfill all myne owne Rule; nor ouertaken, in the way of vertue, thoſe manie good, and holie Religious Woemen, who were in that Monaſterie. Nor doe I thinke indeed, that I ſhall euer ariue ſo farre, (vnleſſe Almightie God, through his goodnes, will be pleaſed to performe it all, on his part) but rather, that I was likelie to aboliſh that, which was good, and to eſtabliſh certaine cuſtomes, which were not ſo; at leaſt, I did what I could, to introduce them; and I had alwaies power enough, to doe hurt. So that they blamed me, without anie fault of theirs; nor doe I ſay, that they were only Religious Woemen, but others alſo, who told me truth, becauſe it was permitted by thee.</p>
            <p>When once I was ſaying my Office, I, who had ſometimes, been ſubiect to this temptation, came to this Verſe: <hi>Iuſtus es, Domine, &amp; rectum iudi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cium tuum; Thou art iuſt O Lord, and thy iudgement is right;</hi> and I beganne to conſider, how true this was; for, in this kind, the Diuel had neuer power to tempt me, ſo farre, as to make me doubt, but that thou, O Lord, art the Owner, and Authour
<pb n="240" facs="tcp:100776:157"/>
of all goodnes; no nor yet, in anie thing at all, which belongs to Faith. Nay rather it ſeemed to me, that the more they were aboue Nature, the more firmely did I belieue them; yea, and they cauſed euen more deuotion in me. And, in regard that thou art Omnipotent, all ſuch greatneſſes, as thou ſhouldſt be pleaſed to act, and execute, were reſolued vpon, and concluded in me; and of this, as I was ſaying, I neuer had doubt. So that, when I came afterward to conſider, how thou couldſt permit, that there ſhould be ſo manie deare Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uants of thine, as I was ſaying, who yet receaued not thoſe Fauours, and Regalos, which thou wert pleaſed, to vouchſafe me, (I being ſo miſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rable a Creature, as I was) thou anſweredſt me thus, O Lord: <hi>Doe thou ſerue me; and doe not trouble thy ſelf, vvith that.</hi> Now, this was the verie firſt Word of that kind, which euer I perceiued thee to ſpeake to me; and therefore, it amazed me much; And I will, heerafter, declare this manner of vnderſtanding things; togeather with diuers others. I ſpeake not of it heer; for it were to goe from the purpoſe; and I belieue, I haue gone from it already; and, in effect, I ſcarce know, what I haue ſayd; nor can it indeed, well, be otherwiſe; but your Reuerence muſt needs beare with theſe interuals, and interruptions. For, when I once conſider, how much God endures at my hands, and, withall, behold my ſelf in this condi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, it is not to goe for a ſtrange thing, that I looſe my ayme, both in that, which I ſay, and am
<pb n="241" facs="tcp:100776:157"/>
to ſay. And I beſeech our Lord, that all my im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pertinencies, and roauings, may alwaies be of this kind; and that his Diuine Maieſtie may not permit, that I may euer varie one haires breadth, from him, but rather, that I may be conſumed, euen in this moment. For it may well be ſuffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cient for me, to haue obſerued, and diſcerned his great mercie, not once, but often, in that he hath been pleaſed, to pardon ſo great an ingratitude, as mine. He pardoned S. Peter once; but me, often; ſo that the Diuel had ſome kind of reaſon, to tempt me, as hopeing, that I would not pretend, to hold ſtraight friendſhip with one, with whome I had been in ſo publique enmitie. But how great, O Lord, was this blindnes of mine? For, where could I euer thinke, O my Lord, to find anie remedie, but by thee? What a ſenſleſſe kind of follie, was it for me, to fly from the light, that ſo, I might, for euer, goe ſtumb<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling-on in the darke? What a fooliſh kind of proud Humilitie was that, which the Diuel in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uented for me, when he perſwaded me to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>part, from leaning againſt that Staffe, and Pillar, <note n="*" place="margin">The ſtrong Pillar of Prayer.</note> which might ſupport me; that ſo, my Fall might not be ſo great? At this inſtant doe I bleſſe my ſelf, with the Croſſe; for, me thinkes, I neuer paſſed a danger, ſo very hazardous, in my whole life, as this inuention was, which the Diuel had a minde to teach me, by way of Humilitie. For, he put it into my conceipt, to thinke, how it could be poſſible, that ſo wicked a thing, as my ſelf,
<pb n="242" facs="tcp:100776:158"/>
hauing receiued ſo great Fauours, from Almightie God, could euer procure to come to Mentall Prayer; and that, for me, it would ſuffice, if I ſayd thoſe Vocall Prayers, to which I was bound; as others did; but that, ſince now I did not euen thus much, well, what ſenſe was there, that I ſhould pretend to doe more; and that this, was to expreſſe little reuerence to Almightie God, and to vnderualue his Fauours.</p>
            <p>It was fitt, to thinke, and know all this; but to put it in execution, had been extreamly ill done. And be thou Bleſſed, O Lord, who broughtſt me the remedie. For, this temptation ſeems to haue been no leſſe, then a beginning to that other, which the Diuel brought vpon Iudas; but, that Traitour, the Diuel, durſt not tempt me, ſo openly, but would faine haue come, by little and little, to ſet vpon me; as he did, vpon him.</p>
            <p>And now, for the loue of our Lord, let all them, who vſe Mentall Prayer, conſider <note n="*" place="margin">Conſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der this very vvell.</note> that, which followes, very well. Let them know, that, during the time, when I forbore it, my life was much worſe, then before. And let it be well conſidered, what a fine kind of remedie the Diuel brought me, and what a daintie ridiculous Hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>militie, it muſt be, which could fill me, with ſo deep a diſquiet. For indeed, how could this Soule of mine, appeaſe it ſelf? The ignorant, fooliſh Creature went away, as faſt as ſhe could, from her true repoſe, and reſt. She had her Fauours, and Regalo's, preſent to her memorie; and ſhe
<pb n="243" facs="tcp:100776:158"/>
found, that the contentments of this world, were ſo loathſome, as euen almoſt to prouoke a Vomit. But I am amazed, how I could endure it; though belike, it was with ſome kind of hope, that, at the worſt hand, I might be able to remaine free from Sinne; for, I neuer, as I remember, (though yet, it be now, more then one &amp; twentie yeares agoe) gaue-ouer a being reſolued, to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turne to Prayer. But, O, how ill-grounded, and addreſſed, was this hope of mine? For, the Diuel would faine haue turned me ouer, till the Day of Iudgement; that ſo, from thence, he might conduct me to Hell.</p>
            <p>But yet now afterward, I frequenting Prayer, &amp; Reading, which was indeed the way, to ſee reall Truths; &amp; looking downe, vpon that wicked courſe, which I was holding; and often impor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tuning our Bleſſed Lord, with manie teares, I was yet, ſo very wretched, that I knew not, by anie meanes, how to help my ſelf. But then againe, on the other ſide, I growing to giue-ouer theſe good things, and employing my ſelf vpon certaine idle paſtimes; and expoſing my ſelf to manie occaſions of ill; and enioying very few helps; (and I may rather venture to ſay, none at all, but only ſuch, as might help mee to fall) for what, might I euer hope, but what I haue ſayd? I beleiue, that a cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taine Religious man of S. Dominick's Order, who was very learned, hath great merit, in the ſight of God; for he awaked me out of this ſleep. And he made me (as, I thinke, I haue already expreſſed)
<pb n="244" facs="tcp:100776:159"/>
receaue the B. Sacrament, euerie Forthnight. And ſo, my miſerie being then, not altogeather ſo great, I beganne to come back againe into my ſelf; though yet withall, I forbore not, to commit ſome offences againſt our Lord. But, becauſe I had not loſt my way, I went ſtill on, with falling, &amp; riſing; though yet, but by little, and little. And he, who neuer giues-ouer to goe forward, will ariue at length, by going ſoftly, though it be late. For my part, I conceaue, that, for a Soule to looſe her way, and to leaue her Prayer, is indeed but one, and the ſelf ſame thing; and our Lord deliuer vs from it, for his owne Mercies ſake.</p>
            <p>It is, heervpon, to be inferred, (and I deſire, euen for the loue of our Lord, that it may be much obſerued) that, although a Soule ſhall come to ſuch paſſe, as that our Lord may doe her great Fauours, in Prayer, ſhe muſt not yet, be con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fident of her ſelf, ſince ſhe may yet, come to fall againe. And let her not, by anie meanes, expoſe her ſelf to <note n="*" place="margin">Take heed.</note> occaſions of Sinne. Let her be care<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full, to conſider thus much; for, the deceipt, of which the Diuel is wont to ſerue himſelf, in this occaſion, is very great. For, though the Fauour, which was imparted to the Soule, were moſt cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainly from Almightie God, yet the Traytour will not faile to ſerue himſelf of that verie Fauour, in whatſoeuer he can; and eſpecially, for the diſaduantage of perſons, who are not ſtrong in vertue, and mortification; nor are abſolutly vntyed, and looſe, from all things, belonging to
<pb n="245" facs="tcp:100776:159"/>
this world. For, men, in fine, muſt know, that they are not, by meanes of this Prayer, ſufficiently ſtrengthned, and fortifyed (as I will declare after<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward) for the putting themſelues into occaſions, and dangers; how great deſires, and reſolutions ſoeuer, they may haue.</p>
            <p>This is an excellent Doctrine; and it is not mine, but taught by Almightie God himſelf; and ſo I ſhall be glad, that all ignorant perſons, like me, may learne it. For, though a Soule be neuer ſo high, in this State, yet muſt ſhe not truſt her ſelf ſo farre, as to goe out, to combat; but she will haue acquitted her ſelf well, if she can defend her ſelf. So that, in this State, and condition, it will be neceſſarie for her, to carrie Defenſiue Armes, againſt the Diuel; for yet, she hath not ſtrength enough, wherewith to aſſault him; and much leſſe, to tread him vnder foot; as yet, they will be able to doe, who shall find themſelues, in that State; whereof I will diſcourſe afterward. But this, is that deuiſe, and coſening-Trick, whereby the Diuel is wont to take vs; That, when once he ſees a Soule ariue to be ſo very neare to our Lord, and which can iudge ſo very well, of the differ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence, between the bleſſings, which belong to this life, and the next; and of the Loue, which our Lord beares to that Soule; from this very Loue, he makes ſuch a kind of confidence, and ſecuritie grow, as that she shall neuer, forſooth, be able to fall from that, which she is enioying, at that time. And she alſo ſeemes, there-vpon, to eye her
<pb n="246" facs="tcp:100776:160"/>
reward, ſo very clearly, that ſhe is eaſily brought to hold it, euen impoſſible for her, to quitt that, which is ſo very delightfull, and guſtfull, euen in this life, for ſo baſe, and filthie a thing, as world<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lie pleaſure is. Now, by meanes of this vaine con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fidence, doth the Diuel grow to depriue her, of the diſtruſt, which otherwiſe ſhe would haue, of her owne ſtrength; and thus, ſhe expoſes her ſelf, as I was ſaying, to danger; and beginnes, with a foolish kind of good zeale, to be giuing the Fruits of her Garden, away, to others, without anie limits; as beleiuing now, that she hath no more cauſe, ſo to be afrayd, concerning her ſelf; and that this, is not, forſooth, out of pride (for, the Soule vnderſtands well enough, that she is able to doe nothing, of her ſelf) but through the much <note n="*" place="margin">A moſt dange<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rous tempta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion.</note> confidence, which ſhe hath, in Almightie God. Yet all this, is without diſcretion; becauſe ſhe doth not well conſider, that ſhe hath not yet, mewed all her owne ſick-feathers. She may well ſtepp out of her Neſt; yea, and Almightie God himſelf, will, perhaps, take her, now, and then, out, from thence. But ſhe is not yet, fitt for a Flight, becauſe her vertues are not yet growne to be of full ſtrength; nor hath ſhe yet, experience, for the knowledge of dangers; nor doth ſhe yet, vnderſtand the miſcheif, which growes, by put<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting too much truſt, in her owne forces.</p>
            <p>And now, this is that, which deſtroyed me; and both for this, and for all things, there will be great neceſſitie, of a Directour; and of conuerſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
<pb n="247" facs="tcp:100776:160"/>
with perſons, who are ſpirituall, indeed. It is true, I am fully perſwaded, that, when Almightie God doth once bring a Soule to this ſtate, he will not leaue to fauour her, nor ſuffer her to perish; if she doe not very shamefully, and entirely, forſake, and forbeare, to ſerue his Diuine Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ieſtie. But yet, if it should ſo happen, that she fall, let her conſider, and conſider againe, (euen for the loue of our Bleſſed Lord) and take heed, that the Diuel deceaue her not, ſo farre, as to make her giue-ouer her Prayer, as he did me, vnder the pretence of falſe Humilitie; as I haue decla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red; and, as I would fayne repeat, very often. But, let her truſt in the goodnes of Almightie God, which is greater, then all the ſinnes, which we can commit; and let her hope, that he will not remember our ingratitude, when once we, re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flecting duly vpon our ſelues, deſire to returne againe to his friendship; nor euen <note n="*" place="margin">Conſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der, and admire this paſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſage.</note> ſo farre con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſider the Fauours, which he hath done vs, as to make vs be punished for them; but that rather they will help to obtaine pardon for vs, ſo much the ſooner, as for perſons, who haue belonged to his Houſe, and haue had the honour to eat (as men vſe to ſay) of his bread. Let them remember his words; and conſider, how he hath proceeded with me, who euen wearied my ſelf, with offen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding his Diuine Maieſtie, before he would for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>beare, or faile, to pardon me. For, he neuer growes vnwilling to giue; nor is it euer poſſible, to draw his Mercies dry; and ſo, let not vs be
<pb n="248" facs="tcp:100776:161"/>
wearie of euer receauing Fauour, at his hands. Let him be bleſſed for euer, Amen; and let all creatures praiſe him.</p>

This Diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>courſe is of much admiration.</p>
            </argument>
            <p>I Would be glad to know, how to declare (through the Fauour of Almightie God) the difference, which there is, between Vnion, on the one ſide; and Rapt, and Flight, (as they are wont to call it) of Spirit, on the other; for, theſe two latter, doe ſignifye, in ſubſtance, but one thing; and it is alſo called Extaſis. The aduantage is very great, which belongs to Rapt, beyond Vnion; and the effects alſo, which it produces, are much greater; and it hath alſo manie other operations. For, meer Vnion, ſeemes to be alwaies, after the ſame manner; both in the beginning; in the middle; and in the end; and it is alwaies, in the interiour part. But now, as Rapts are Viſitations of the Soule, which vſe to be of a higher Straine,
<pb n="249" facs="tcp:100776:161"/>
they are wont to produce their Effects, not only interiourly, but exteriourly alſo. I humbly beſeech our Bleſſed Lord, that, as he hath vouchſafed to declare the reſt, ſo he will alſo vouchſafe to doe this; for certainly, if his Diuine Maieſtie had not been pleaſed to giue me to vnderſtand, by what meanes, &amp; in what manner, it might be done, I ſhould not poſſibly haue knowne, which way to turne my hand.</p>
            <p>Let vs therefore now conſider, that this laſt Water, whereof we haue ſpoken, is ſo very plentifull, and abundant, that, if it were not, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe the Soyle of the Garden cannot conſent to receaue it, we might beleiue, that the verie Clowd it ſelf, of that great Maieſtie, were heer, rayning it ſelf downe, vpon this earth. And ſo, when we are gratefull to our Lord, for this great bleſſing, acknowledging the ſame, by our good workes, according to the vttermoſt of our power, our Lord catches-vp <note n="*" place="margin">The manner &amp; nature of Rapts.</note> that Soule (as a man may ſay) euen iuſt ſo, as the clowdes ſnatch vp the vapours, from the earth; and ſo, taking her wholy vp, from the ſame earth, the clowd riſes vp to Heauen, and carries the ſame along, with it ſelf; and ſhewes her certaine things, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>longing to that Kingdome, which is prepared for her. I know not, whether this Compariſon will be thought to ſuite well, with that, whereof I am ſpeaking; but I am ſure, that, in realitie of truth, it paſſes thus. In theſe Rapts, it doth not ſeem, that the Soule doth euen animate the Bodie;
<pb n="250" facs="tcp:100776:162"/>
and ſo, the Bodie it ſelf, remaines with a kind of trouble, and defect, through the want of that naturall heat, which belongs to it; and it goes, all cooling it ſelf, though yet, with an exceſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiue ſweetnes, and delight. There is heer, no meanes at all, to reſiſt; though in Vnion (we being then, as in our owne Countrie) there is ſome remedie; and ſo (though it be not without ſuffering a kind of paine, and vſing ſome force) it may alwaies, in effect, be employed. But heer, for the moſt part, there is no remedie, at all; nor anie helpe; but, manie times, the thing ariues, without our being ſo much as able to preuent the coming of it, euen by our very thought. And there growes to be, ſuch a ſpeedie, and ſtrong kind of impetuoſitie, that you feele, and find this Clowd to raiſe it ſelf inſtantly vp; or rather, that this ſtrong Eagle takes you, and carries you quite away, between her wings. And I ſay, it is vnderſtood, and you find your ſelf to be carried away, though you know not, whither. For, howſoeuer the thing happen to be with delight, yet ſo great is the weaknes of our naturall condition, that it puts vs into ſome feare, in the beginning. And therefore, it will be neceſſarie, in this caſe, for the Soule, to be much more couragious, and reſolute, then for all thoſe occaſions, which were precedent. For heer, ſhe muſt be content to hazard all, and to leaue her ſelf wholy, in the hands of Almightie God; and to goe, whitherſoeuer ſhe ſhall be
<pb n="251" facs="tcp:100776:162"/>
carried; and this, with a very good will; for, in fine, they will be ſure to carrie her, whether ſhe will, or no; and that, with ſo great extremitie of ſtrength, and ſpeed, that, howſoeuer I had a minde, very, very often, to reſiſt it, yea, and that I employed all the ſtrength I had, to that purpoſe, (and eſpecially, at ſome particular times, when things fell out, to happen, in publique; yea, and at manie other times alſo, when they were pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uate; for I was then, in doubt, and feare, leaſt I might be abuſed, and deceiued) it was yet but ſeldome, that I was able to preuaile, to ſome ſmall proportion. But it coſt mee a very great deale of harraſſing, &amp; wearines, to my ſelf, iuſt ſo, as if ſome ordinarie perſon had been fighting with ſome ſtrong Giant; &amp; afterward I ſhould finde my ſelf very weary. But at other times, it was altogeather impoſſible for me to hinder it; for, my Soule would be carried abſolutly away, and ordinarily, euen my head, as it were, after it; yea &amp; this, ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times, ſo farre, as that my whole Bodie would be tranſported ſo, as to be raiſed-vp from the ground. This laſt, hath happened rarely to me; but once it was vpon the very point to ariue, whilſt we all, were aſſembled togeather, in the Quire; and I being then, vpon my knees, (as at the point of going to receaue the Bleſſed Sacrament) it put me to an extremitie of trouble; becauſe it ſeemed to be a very extraordinarie thing, and that in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtantly, there would be much note of it; and ſo I commanded my Religious-woemen (for at that
<pb n="252" facs="tcp:100776:163"/>
time, I was growne to be Prioreſſe) that they ſhould not ſpeake of it, to anie creature. But, at other times, when I beganne to diſcerne, that our Lord was going about, to doe the ſame, againe, (and once, in particular, when diuers principall Ladies were preſent; and it was vpon the Feaſt of our Vocation, when there was a Sermon) I did euen ſpread my ſelf, all along, vpon the ground; and though the Religious woemen came then about me, to keep my Bodie downe, yet the thing was eaſily perceiued. Vpon this, I humbly prayed our Lord, in moſt particular manner, that, by no meanes, he would doe me anie ſuch Fauours, as might carrie anie of theſe exteriour demonſtrations, with them; for, already, I was very wearie of being neceſſarily ſo wary, and watchfull ouer my ſelf; for that ſuch kind of Fauours, could not poſſibly be done me, by his Diuine Maieſtie, but ſo, that euerie bodie, would come to know it. And it ſeemes, that, through his goodnes, he hath been pleaſed to heare my Prayer; for, ſince that time, I neuer had anie Rapts of that kinde, and to that proportion; but it is true, that it is notlong, ſince I had the laſt.</p>
            <p>But yet now, ſo it is, that when I had a minde to reſiſt theſe Rapts, there ſeemed to be ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>what of ſo mightie force, vnder my feet, which raiſed me vp, that I know not, to what to com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pare it; but it came with much more impetuoſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie, then anie of theſe other things of Spirit; and ſo, I was euen torne, as it were, to peices; for, the
<pb n="253" facs="tcp:100776:163"/>
combat, and ſtrife, is great; but, in fine, all helped little; for, when our Lord hath a minde to doe anie thing, no power is able to ſtand againſt it. At other times, he is pleaſed to content himſelf, with letting vs ſee, that he is diſpoſed, to doe vs that Fauour, and that there is no auerſion, in his Diuine Maieſtie; and that we, oppoſing our ſelues, for Humility's ſake, there follow yet, the ſelf-ſame Effects, as if we had wholy conſented.</p>
            <p>Now, theſe <note n="*" place="margin">The Ef<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fects of Rapts.</note> Effects are great. For firſt, the mightie power of our Bleſſed Lord, is made ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parant thereby; and that, when his Diuine Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ieſtie is pleaſed to diſpoſe of things otherwiſe, we are no more able to detaine our Bodies, then our Soules; nor are we Lords therof; but we muſt, in deſpight of our harts, acknowledge, that there is a Superiour; and that theſe Fauours come from him; and that, of our ſelues, we can doe nothing, in nothing; and ſo, a great impreſſion of Humili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie, is made vpon the Soule, by this meanes. And further, I confeſſe, that it bred alſo a great feare in me, (and, at the firſt, an extreame great one) to ſee, that a maſſie Bodie ſhould be taken-vp from the earth. For, though the Spirit be that, which drawes it after it; and though it be with great ſuauitie, and delight, (if it be not reſiſted) yet our Senſes are not loſt thereby; at leaſt I, for my part, was ſo perfectly in my Senſes, that I was able to vnderſtand, that I was raiſed. There doth alſo, heerby, appeare ſo great a Maieſtie in him, who can doe this, that it makes, euen the verie
<pb n="254" facs="tcp:100776:164"/>
haire of the head, ſtand on end; and there re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maines a mightie feare, to offend ſo great a God; but yet ſo, as that it is wrapped vp, in an exceſſiue kind of loue, which ſhe beginns to conceaue, euen newly, and freshly againe, towards him, whome she finds, to carrie ſo great a loue to ſuch rotten wormes, as we are. For now he ſeemes not content, with drawing the Soule only to himſelf, in ſo particular, and ſo certaine a manner, but that he will needs alſo, draw the verie Bodie too, euen whilſt it is ſo very mortall, and compo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed of ſo filthie earth, as we haue made it, by our Sinnes. This alſo leaues, in the Soule, a very ſtrange kind of looſning, and caſting it ſelf off, from all the things of this world; whereof I know not, how to expreſſe well, what it is; but, me thinkes, I may well ſay, that it is not only, in ſome ſort, a different, but alſo a greater kind of thing, then thoſe others, which worke vpon the onlie Spirit, import. For though, in thoſe other Vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſitations alſo, there be a kind of totall vntying, and looſning it ſelf from all things, for as much as con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cernes the Spirit; yet heer, it ſeemes, our Lord is pleaſed, that euen the Bodie alſo it ſelf, ſhall put this point, in practiſe. And it breeds, in anie Crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, ſuch a new kind of ſhyneſſe, and miſlike, in order to the things of this world, that it makes euen our verie life much the more painefull to vs. It giues alſo ſuch another <note n="*" place="margin">The ſtran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gest ſtate of Minde, vvhich perhaps is deſcri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bed in the vvhole Booke.</note> paine, as we can neither tell, how to procure, when we haue it not; nor free our ſelues from the ſame, when we haue it. And I
<pb n="255" facs="tcp:100776:164"/>
would be extreamly glad, to be able, to giue this, to be vnderſtood; but, I belieue, I ſhall not know, how to doe it; though yet, I will ſay ſomewhat, if I be able.</p>
            <p>But now, it is to be noted, that theſe things come vpon me, when I am, as it were, in the verie Euening of the day, after all thoſe Viſions, and Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uelations, whereof I will write; &amp; after the time, when I vſed to hold that Prayer, wherein our Lord was wont to allow me ſo great Regalo's, and guſts. And though yet theſe things doe not ceaſe with me, at ſome times, yet doth this Paine, more often, and more vſually ſeaze vpon me, which I will now declare. It hath ſometimes, of the more; and ſometimes, of the leſſe; and now I will apply my ſelf, to ſpeake of it, as when it hath of the more. For, though I will treat heerafter, of thoſe great impetuoſities, which they vſed to bring vpon me, before our Lord was pleaſed to giue me thoſe Rapts; yet they had, in my opinion, no more to doe, by way of Compariſon, one with another, then there is, between things Corporall, and Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rituall. And I beleiue, that I doe not exaggerate the matter, a whitt, by ſaying ſo; becauſe that Paine ſeemes to be ſuch, as that, although the Soule doe feele it, yet it feeles it, togeather, vvith the Bodie; and ſo, both of them, participate therin. And it is not alſo, with that extremitie, of being, as it were, abandoned, and vtterly forſaken; which yet abounds in this; wherein, as I was ſaying, we haue no part at all, our ſelues. But, there often comes a
<pb n="256" facs="tcp:100776:165"/>
kind of deſire, vnſeaſonably, and vnexpectedly, vpon vs; and I know not, from whence it moues. And, vpon this deſire, which penetrates the whole Soule, euen at one verie inſtant, she beginnes to afflict, and euen belabour her ſelf ſo, as that she riſes much aboue her ſelf; and indeed, aboue whatſoeuer is created; and Almightie God is pleaſed, to make her ſo very deſolate, &amp; diſguſted, in order to all temporall things, that, how much ſoeuer she may labour, and endeauour to the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trarie, there is nothing in this world, which will either accompanie her, or whereby she would be glad to be accompanied, but euen directly to dye, in that Solitude. For, if anie bodie ſpeake to her, or if she would employ all the power, which poſſibly she might haue, to ſpeake to others, it ſerues to very little purpoſe; for, her Spirit (doe what she can) doth ſtill, not depart, from making her find her ſelfe, to be perfectly alone. And though it ſeem to me, as if Almightie God were then, extreamly remote from her; yet, at times, he communicates his greatneſſes to her, by a manner, the moſt highly ſtrange, that can be imagined; yea and more ſtrange, then can poſſibly be expreſſed. Nor doe I beleiue, that anie other creature will either beleiue it, or can vnderſtand it; but only ſome ſuch perſon, as may haue felt it. For, this is no communication, to giue comfort; but only to shew the reaſon, which that perſon hath, to be afflicted, and diſtreſſed, for being abſent from that Good, which comprehends all good things, in it
<pb n="257" facs="tcp:100776:165"/>
ſelf. By meanes of this communication, both the deſire doth encreaſe, and ſo alſo, doth the extre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitie of that Solitude, wherein the Soule findes her ſelf; togeather with a certaine paine, which is ſo very delicate, and penetratiue (the Soule being placed then, in that kind of Deſert) that it may expreſly, and euen literally, ſeem to be, at that time, that verie thing, where of the Royall Prophet ſpoke, when he was, in the ſame verie Solitude. Saue that, our Bleſſed Lord would vouchſafe the ſenſe of thoſe things, to him, and make him feele it, being a Saint, after a more perfect manner. But the words, whereof I ſpeake, were theſe: <hi>Vigilaui, &amp; factus ſum ſicut paſſer ſolitarius in tecto. I haue vvatched, and am become like a ſolitarie Sparrovv, vpon the topp of a Houſe.</hi> For ſo doth that Verſe repreſent it ſelf to me, at thoſe times, that, me thinkes, I doe euen ſee mine owne condition, therin. And it comforts me to obſerue, that others haue alſo found themſelues, in ſo high an extremitie of So<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>litude; and eſpecially, when they were ſuch per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons, as the Royall Prophet was. So that, me thinkes, this kind of Soule, is not then, it ſelf; but rather vpon the verie topp, or ridge, as one may ſay, therof; yea, and of all things alſo, which are created; for then, mee thinkes, the Soule remaines, in the very higheſt, and moſt ſuperiour part of her ſelf.</p>
            <p>At other times, the Soule ſeemes to find her ſelf, in that occaſion, as in the verie extremitie of neceſſitie, and miſerie; and that then, ſhe is ſaying,
<pb n="258" facs="tcp:100776:166"/>
and asking her ſelf this queſtion: <hi>VVhere is novv thy God?</hi> But now heer, it is to be noted, that, for my part, I knew not then, what thoſe words ſignifyed in the vulgar Toung; yet, when afterwards I came to know it, I was much comforted to ſee, that our Lord was pleaſed to bring them to my memorie, without anie procurement at all, of mine. At other times, I alſo called that Saying of S. Paul to minde: That <hi>he vvas crucifyed to the vvorld.</hi> I ſay not, that I was ſo; for I ſee but too well, that I am not; but me thinkes, the Soule, in this caſe, is very much after that manner; for, ſhe gets no comfort, either from Heauen, becauſe ſhe is not there; nor carries ſhe anie affection at all, to the Earth; nor is ſhe alſo there, but remaines, as if ſhe were euen crucifyed, between Heauen, &amp; Earth; and ſuffering all the while, without receauing anie ſuccour, either from one of theſe places, or the other. For, that which comes to her from Heauen, (which is, as I haue ſayd before, but a notice of Almightie God, ſo admirable, aboue all that, which we know anie way, how to deſire) doth but ſerue for her greater torment, becauſe it mul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiplyes the ſame deſire, in ſuch ſort, that the exceſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiue paine thereof, doth put her, in my opinion, euen paſt her ſenſes; ſaue that ſhe remaines ſo, but a very little while. Now this condition of minde, ſeemes to be no leſſe, then euen the verie agonie, and paſſage of death it ſelf; yet withall, there is ſo very great a conte<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>tment taken in this ſuffering, that I know not, to what, in fine, I may poſſibly be
<pb n="259" facs="tcp:100776:166"/>
able to compare it. It is a feirce, and yet a ſauourie, and delightfull kind of Martyrdome; ſince all that, which concernes this world, and which it is poſſible, to repreſent to the Soule (yea though it were, euen the moſt delightfull Obiect, which euer ſhe had been accuſtomed to embrace) is by no meanes admitted, but is inſtantly, caſt ſharply away, from her. She vnderſtands alſo heer, very well, that ſhe cares for nothing at all, but Al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mightie God; and yet, she conſiders no particular thing, euen in him; but she will haue him, all to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>geather; and yet, after a ſort, she knowes not, what she would haue. I ſay againe, that she knowes not; becauſe her Imagination repreſents nothing at all, to her; yea and, in my opinion, during a great part of that time, wherein she is after that manner, the Powers of her Soule doe not worke that ioy, which vſes to be felt, both in the caſe of Vnion, and of Rapts; for they are wholy ſuſpended by her paine.</p>
            <p>But O, that I were able to giue your Reuer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence to vnderſtand this buſines, well; though it were, but, that you might ſo, make me know more particularly, what it is. For now, this is that, in which my Soule doth ordinarily moſt co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>tinue; &amp;, whenſoeuer I am not employed about ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>what, ſhe is put euen vpon theſe verie ſtraights, and agonie of death. She is afrayd, when ſhe ſees them beginne, for feare leaſt it ſhould coſt me my life; but yet when it is once begunne, ſhe would be glad, that, during all that life, which
<pb n="260" facs="tcp:100776:167"/>
might laſt, ſhe might continue, in that ſtate of ſufferance; though yet ſtill, it be ſo very exceſſiue, that the perſon is ſcarce able to endure it. For, ſometimes, I am, in effect, without anie pulſe at all, as my Siſters tell me, who then come towards me, to ſee what paſſes; for now they beginne a little, to vnderſtand more, of the caſe. And the bones of my verie armes, to which the ioynts are faſtned, grow then to be euen opened; and my hands are ſo ſtarke, and ſtiffe, that I cannot poſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſibly, ſometimes, bring them togeather; and ſo the paine remaines, till the next day after, in my wreſts, and in my Bodie, in ſuch a manner, that it ſeems, as if I were euen racked, and diſioynted. And I am ſometimes conceauing, that our Lord may one day, perhaps, thinke fitt (in caſe this courſe goe on) to make it end, with the verie ending of my life. For, ſo great a torment as this, may well, in my opinion, be ſufficient, for ſo great an effect, as that; ſaue only, that I deſerue not, to be ſo happie.</p>
            <p>All the anxietie of my deſire, conſiſts, at this time, that I may dye. For I neither remember Purgatorie, nor yet thoſe great Sinnes, which I haue committed, for which I deſerued Hell-Fire. But, all is now forgotten, through that anxietie of deſire, and appetite, to ſee Almightie God; yea, and that vaſt Solitude, and Deſert, wherein I am, at that time, ſeemes a much more deſireable thing, then all the ſweeteſt ſocietie of this world. If anie thing were of power, to giue her co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>fort, in
<pb n="261" facs="tcp:100776:167"/>
this caſe, it would be, that ſhe might be able to treat with ſome one, who had endured the ſame tor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>me<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t; for now, though ſhe co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>plaine therof, it ſeems, that no Creature can tell, how to beleiue her.</p>
            <p>It alſo contributes to her torment, that this paine is ſo extreame, that ſhe would faine, nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther be in Solitude, nor yet haue companie, as others haue; but only to haue the ſocietie of ſome ſuch perſons, as to whome, ſhe might be able to make her complaint. It is with her, in in this caſe, as with one, who euen hath the halter about his neck; and who, whilſt he is euen ſtrang<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling, endeauours, and would faine take his breath. For, iuſt ſo, me thinkes, doth this inclina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion to haue companie, ſeem, to be an effect of our naturall frailtie, and weaknes; that, as this exceſſiue paine ſeems to put vs to iminent danger of death, (for, it is certaine, that it doth all this; and I haue ſeen my ſelf, diuers times, in this dan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger, through my great ſickneſſes, and other oc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>caſions; as I haue declared; and I will beleiue, that this may perhaps, proue to be as great, as anie of the reſt) ſo the deſire, and inclination, which, both the Bodie, and Soule haue, not to be parted, is that, which ſeekes ſuch a kind of ſuccour, as to take breath; and by expreſſing it ſelf, and diuerting, and complaining, ſeeks yet, for ſome meanes, how to liue againe, heer below; though ſtill, much againſt the will of the Spirit, or ſuperiour part of the Soule, which would faine not be quitt of this Paine.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="262" facs="tcp:100776:168"/>
I know not, whether I hitt right, in what I ſay, or if I know indeed, how to doe it; but to the vttermoſt, and beſt of my opinion, it paſſes iuſt thus, as I haue declared. And now, your Reuer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence ſhall doe well, to conſider, what kind of reſt, or eaſe, it is poſſible for me to enioy, in this life; ſince that, which I was wont to find by meanes of Solitude, and Prayer (for therein, our Lord was pleaſed, to giue me great conſolations) is now moſt vſually conuerted into this torment; which yet, withall, is ſo delicious a kind of thing, and the Soule perceaues it to be of ſo high value, that now, ſhe delights in it more, then in all thoſe other Regalo's which ſhe was euer wont to poſſeſſe. For she holds it, to be more ſecure, as be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the way of the Croſſe; and it giues alſo, in my opinion, a guſt, which is of mighty worth. For she allowes nothing at all to the Bodie, but paine; and the Soule is that, which originally ſuffers; and doth only feele that ioy, and high content<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, which this verie ſuffering, giues her.</p>
            <p>I know not, how all this, can be; but yet it paſſes ſo, in verie truth, that (foraſmuch as I can vnderſtand of my ſelf) I would not change this Fauour, which our Lord doth me, (and which proceeds, as I haue ſayd, from his hand, and is no way acquired by me, as being wholy Super<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>naturall, in it ſelf) for all thoſe others, which I I shall heer declare, afterward; I ſay not, for all them togeather, but for any one of them, being taken ſeuerally, by it ſelfe.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="263" facs="tcp:100776:168"/>
And heer, let it not be forgotten, how I ſay, that theſe impetuoſities, or impulſes, which are deſcribed heer, ariued after the Fauours, which our Lord did me firſt; as alſo after all that, whereof I will write in this Booke; yea, &amp; euen after my en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trance into the Fauour, which I am enioying at this preſent. And I, finding my ſelf, in the begin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nings, to be in ſome feare (as, in effect, it happens to me alwaies, whenſoeuer it pleaſes our Lord to doe me anie Fauour; till at leaſt, in the proceeding therof, I may haue receaued ſome kind of ſecuritie from his Diuine Maieſtie) he willed me, not to feare, but to eſteem this Fauour, for greater, then all thoſe others were, which he had formerly been pleaſed to vouchſafe me; becauſe the Soule was purifyed by this paine; and for that it was burnished, &amp; refined heer, as gold might be in the Chryſuble; that ſo it might be the more capable, to receaue thoſe enamels, and ornaments of his guifts, and graces; and that ſo, that was to be wiped away, which would otherwiſe haue made worke for Purgatorie.</p>
            <p>I vnderſtood very well, euen before, that this was a great Fauour; but yet I remained with much more ſecuritie, after this; and my Ghoſtlie Father alſo tells me, that it is good. And though I were formerly afrayd, yet, becauſe I am ſo wicked, I could neuer bring my ſelf to beleiue, that it was ill; but rather the verie greatnes it ſelf, of the benefit, gaue me a kind of feare, when I remembred, how very farre I had been from de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeruing
<pb n="264" facs="tcp:100776:169"/>
it. But, Bleſſed be our Lord, who is ſo good, Amen.</p>
            <p>It ſeemes, that I haue gone from the purpoſe; for I was beginning to ſpeake of Rapts; and this, which now I haue ſayd, is a greater thing, then a Rapt; and ſo it leaues thoſe effects, in the Soule, which I haue related. And therefore, let vs now returne to ſpeake of Rapts; and of that, which is moſt vſuall therin. I ſay then, that it ſeemed to me, manie times, that it <note n="*" place="margin">The ef<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect of Rapts.</note> left my whole Bodie ſo light, that all the weight thereof, was vtterly gone; yea and ſometimes, to ſuch a kind of pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portion, as, in effect, I knew not, how to ſet, ſo much as my feet, vpon the ground; though yet, when the Soule is in Rapt, the Bodie remaines apart, as if it were vtterly dead, being able, manie times, to doe abſolutly nothing at all, of it ſelf; but as it chances to be, at the time, ſo it remaines, whether it be ſitting, or no; or whether it haue the hands, either open, or cloſed. For, though ſhe looſe her ſenſes, ſome few times, (and the ſame hath alſo hapned to me, now and then) yet haue they ſeldome been totally loſt; and that, but for a very ſhort time at once. The moſt vſuall effect, is wont to be, that ſhe finds her ſelf, a little in diſorder; and though ſhe can doe nothing of her ſelf, foraſmuch as may concerne the miniſterie of the exteriour part, yet leaues ſhe not to vnder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtand, yea and alſo to heare, as if a thing were ſpoken to her, from farre off. I ſay not, that ſhe either vnderſtands, or heares, when ſhe is in the
<pb n="265" facs="tcp:100776:169"/>
higheſt part of the Rapt (I ſay, in the verie higheſt) at thoſe times, when the Faculties, or Powers, are loſt; becauſe then, they are very ſtraightly vnited to Almightie God; and then, in my opi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion, she neither ſees, nor heares. But (as I was ſaying, in the former Prayer of Vnion) this to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tall transforming of the Soule into God, is wont to continue little; yet, for the time it laſts, no Power of the Soule, either feeles, or doth ſo much as know, what paſſes there. And this, ſeemes to be, after this manner; to the end, that men may vnderſtand, that it is not God's will, that we should know it; and belike, we are not ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pable therof; at leaſt, it hath paſſed thus, with me.</p>
            <p>But now your Reuerence will peraduenture aske me, how then it can come to paſſe, that a Rapt should be able to laſt ſo manie howers. To which I anſwer, that the thing, which hath often occurred to me, is this; That (as I haue declared already, in the former Prayer) we enioy Rapts, by certaine interuals, and interruptions. For, the Soule doth, manie times, ingulfe it ſelf; or rather (to ſpeake both more properly, and more truly) our Lord ingulfs the Soule into him, and enter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taines her ſo, a while; and then there remaines that onlie Facultie of hers, which is the Will. Now, me thinkes, that buſines, and buſsle, of the other two Faculties, and Powers, is like thoſe <note n="*" place="margin">This Saynt it admira<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble, in her Compa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riſons.</note> little Needles of Sunne-Dyals, which vſually doe neuer ſtand ſtill; but yet, when the Sunne of
<pb n="266" facs="tcp:100776:170"/>
Iuſtice hath a minde to it, he makes them ſtable, and firme; now this, I ſay, laſts but a very little while. But yet, ſince the impulſe, and impetuoſitie was great, and the exaltation of the Spirit, high, the Will remaines ingulfed, and behaues it ſelf like a Soueraigne Ladie, ouer all thoſe operations, which concerne the Bodie; though thoſe other Faculties, and Powers of the Minde, be in agita<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, and diſorder. And ſo alſo, ſince thoſe other two ſayd vnquiet, and diſorderlie Powers, haue a minde to diſturbe, and diſtract the Will, (for, of enemies, the fewer, euer the better) the Senſes are not ſuffered to diuert it. And ſo it growes from hence, that they are alſo ſuſpended; becauſe our Bleſſed Lord, is ſo pleaſed; and, for the moſt part, the eyes are ſhut, though yet we had no intention, to ſhut them; and though, by accident, they may be open ſometimes, yet (as I ſayd be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore) ſhe doth not fix, or ayme, or conſider, at leaſt, at all, what ſhe ſees.</p>
            <p>But now, the Bodie, heer, is much leſſe able to doe anie thing with it ſelf, in order to that time, when the ſayd Powers ſhall returne to be vnited; for then, there will not be much, for it, to doe. And therefore, let him, to whome our Lord ſhall vouchſafe this Fauour, not be diſcomforted at all, if then, he chance to find, both the Bodie, to be, as it were, bound vp, manie howers; yea and euen his verie Vnderſtanding, and Memorie, to be diuerted ſometimes.</p>
            <p>True it is, that Soules be ordinarily, in this
<pb n="267" facs="tcp:100776:170"/>
caſe, euen drenched, yea and, as it were, drowned, in the praiſes of Almightie God; and in deſiring alſo, to comprehend, and vnderſtand that, which hath paſſed with themſelues; and yet, euen for this purpoſe, they vſe not to be very well awake, but rather like ſome one, who hath ſlept, and dreamt, and is not yet, come very well againe, to himſelf. I declare my thoughts ſo largely heerin; becauſe I know, there are perſons, at this time, yea &amp; euen in this verie place, to whome our Lord doth theſe Fauours; and yet, if they, who direct them, haue wanted the experience of theſe things, perhaps they will conceaue, that they are to be, as it were, dead, in theſe Rapts; eſpecially, if theſe Directours be not learned men. And it is matter, both of pittie, and greif, to conſider, how much is ſuffer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, by meanes of ſuch Ghoſtlie Fathers, as doe not vnderſtand this buſines; which I will declare afterward. Perhaps I know not well, what I ſay; but your Reuerence will eaſily vnderſtand, if I hitt anie thing right, ſince our Lord hath already giuen you experience therin; though yet, becauſe it is not long, ſince you began, you will not, per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>aduenture, haue conſidered it, ſo much as I.</p>
            <p>But now, though I endeauoured <note n="*" place="margin">Other great ef<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fects of true Rapts.</note> much, and manie times; yet the Bodie hath not ſtrength, wherewith to ſtirre it ſelf, but the Soule carries it all, along with her. The perſon, who was ſick, doth thus recouer health, manie times; and ſhe, who was full of weaknes, and paine, recouers ſtrength. For, they be great things, which are
<pb n="268" facs="tcp:100776:171"/>
beſtowed in theſe caſes; and ſometimes our Lord is pleaſed (as I was ſaying) that the Bodie ſhould alſo feele his part of ioy, ſince already it yeilds obedience to that, which the Soule deſires. When once ſhe is returned into her ſelf, it will happen to her (if the Rapt haue been great) to goe a day, or two, yea and ſometimes three, with the Powers, ſo abſorpt, and, as it were, ſtupifyed, that they ſeem not to be, altogeather themſelues. But now, heer comes-in the paine, to be able to know againe, how to liue; heer, are our feathers imped; and heer, are the ſick ones falne off; and heer, is the Banner of Chriſt our Lord, ſo directly raiſed-vp, and diſplayed, that now, there ſeemes to remaine no more, but that the Captaine of this Fort, may either get vp himſelf, or els may in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtantly, be carried-vp to the higheſt Tower, there, to plant the ſayd Standard, for the glorie of Al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mighty God. She lookes now vpon them, who are below, as one, who is already in ſafetie; for now, ſhe is ſo farre from fearing dangers, that ſhe rather wiſhes for them; as a perſon, to whome, in ſome ſort, a ſecuritie, for obtaining victorie, is deſigned. She ſees now, very clearly, the little, that all worldlie things ought to be eſteeemed; or rather, the direct <hi>Nothing,</hi> which all things are. They, who are ſeated very high, are able to diſcouer very much. Already, ſhe re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nounces the hauing of anie Will; and is reſolued, to haue no other, then that, which is the Will of our Lord; and ſhe giues him alſo the keyes of
<pb n="269" facs="tcp:100776:171"/>
hers. So that now, ſhe, who was the Gardner, is growne to be the Gouernour of the Houſe; nor will ſhe doe anie thing at all, but according to the will of the Lord thereof; nor will ſhe be Ladie, ſo much as of her ſelf; no, nor of any thing; nor euen of anie ſingle Well of that Garden. And, if there be anie thing in her, which is good, ſhe de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſires, that his Diuine Maieſtie may diſpoſe there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of; for, ſhe will not, from that time forward, poſſeſſe anie kinde of thing, whereof the pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prietie may be her owne; but couets, that all things may be entirely done, in conformitie to the will of our Bleſſed Lord, and for his glorie.</p>
            <p>Now really, and with effect, all theſe things are wont to paſſe in this manner, if the Rapts be true; and the Soule is veſted, with thoſe aduan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tages, and benefits, which are related; and, if theſe doe not follow, I ſhould be apt to doubt, very much, that they were not Rapts, on the part of God; but ſhould rather be inclined to feare, that they were of that kind of Rauings, whereof S. Vincent ſpeakes.</p>
            <p>At leaſt, this is what I vnderſtand; and I haue ſeen, by experience it ſelf, that the Soule is wont, in theſe caſes, to become a Ladie, and Queen, ouer all Creatures; and to acquire ſo much Li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bertie of Spirit, in leſſe then an hower, that ſhe cannot euen know her ſelf; but yet, ſhe well vnderſtands, that all this, is none of her owne; nor doth ſhe know, how ſhe could come to obtaine ſo great a bleſſing; but yet ſtill, ſhe
<pb n="270" facs="tcp:100776:172"/>
vnderſtands withall, the extreame great benefit, and aduantage, which euerie one of theſe Rapts bring vpon her. There is no Creature, who can credit all this, but ſuch an one, as hath learnt it, by experience; and therefore men beleiue not the poore Soule, which they haue ſeen to be wicked, and now find, ſo very ſoone, to pretend to doe certaine things, of ſo high importance; for in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtantly ſhe reſolues, not to be content to ſerue our Lord in ſmall matters, but in the very great<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eſt ſhe can. Now the world is apt to conceaue, that ſuch endeauours are but impertinencies, and temptations; and yet, if men would but vnder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtand, and conſider, that they are not things, which grow from themſelues, but from our Bleſſed Lord, to whome they had already deli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uered-vp the keyes of their Will, they would not ſo much wonder at it. For my part, I am of opinion, that a Soule, which comes once to this ſtate, doth already neither doe, nor euen ſay anie thing, of her ſelf, but that this Soueraigne King hath care of all that, which is to occurr.</p>
            <p>O my deare God! and how clearly doth a Soule ſee heer, the ſenſe, and ſignification of that Verſe; and how it is to be vnderſtood, that both he had reaſon, and that all the world ſhould alſo haue it, to deſire the <hi>vvings of a Doue.</hi> For it is eaſily, and clearly to be vnderſtood, of that <hi>Flight,</hi> which the Spirit makes, whereby to raiſe it ſelf, aboue all Creatures; and, in the firſt place, from, and aboue her ſelf. But this is a ſweet <hi>Flight;</hi> a
<pb n="271" facs="tcp:100776:172"/>
guſtfull, and pleaſant <hi>Flight;</hi> and a <hi>Flight</hi> without noiſe. What kinde of dominion doth ſuch a Soule poſſeſſe, which our Lord doth once con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duct to this pitch, that ſhe may be able to looke downe, vpon all things, without being once intangled by anie of them? and how full of con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fuſion will ſhe be, for that time, wherein ſhe was intangled before? And how much will ſhe be amazed, to looke-back vpon that blindnes of hers? How full, will ſhe be of compaſſion, for ſuch, as doe yet remaine therin? eſpecially, if they be perſons of Prayer, and ſuch, as it pleaſes God to regale. She will heer, be glad, to cry out very lowd, that ſo ſhe may make men vnderſtand, how mightily they are abuſed, and deceiued; yea and ſo, ſhe alſo doth, ſometimes. And then, men are apt to rayne downe, euen whole ſhowers of perſecutions, vpon her head; and they treat her, as one, who wants Humilitie, and who employes her ſelf, to teach thoſe perſons, of whome ſhe might doe well, to learne; and eſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cially, if ſhe be a woeman; for then, come they in, to condemne her; yea and perhaps they may haue reaſon; becauſe they know not, by what impulſe she is moued. But yet, as she knowes not, how to helpe her ſelf, on the one ſide; ſo alſo can she not forbeare, on the other, to vnbeguile thoſe perſons, whome she loues, &amp; whome she de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſires to ſee vnfettered, from the Priſon of this life; for, that ſtate, wherein she was, neither ſeemes leſſe, nor is leſſe, then a Priſon. She is alſo much af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flicted,
<pb n="272" facs="tcp:100776:173"/>
and tired out, with the thought of that time, wherein she tooke anie care of points of Honour; and for the groſſe, falſe errour, wherein she was, to haue beleiued that, to be Honour, which the world calls Honour; for she ſees, that it was an abominable lye; and yet, that euer ie bodie liues in practiſe of that falſe Doctrine. But now, this Soule vnderſtands, and knowes, That, right Honour, is not falſe, but true; eſteeming that, to be worth ſomewhat, which indeed is ſo; and holding that, which indeed is nothing, in no account at all; ſince all is nothing, and leſſe then nothing, which once comes to haue an end; and, in the meane time, doth not pleaſe Almightie God.</p>
            <p>She deſpiſes alſo, and laughes at her ſelf, for the time, wherein she made anie account of Monie, and of the couetous deſires thereof; though yet, in this particular, I doe not beleiue (and certainly, it is very true) that I euer had anie fault, to confeſſe; but it will haue been fault enough, to haue held them, in anie manner of account. If, with them, I had been able to buy theſe bleſſings, which now I find in my ſelf, I might haue eſteemed them very much. But now, the Soule perceaues, that this bleſſing is gotten beſt, by leauing all things. But what, in fine, is that, which can be bought with this Monie, which we ſo much deſire? Is it anie thing of true worth? Is it anie thing, which is durable? Or to what end, doe we deſire it? A miſerable kind of ſupply, and repoſe, doe we procure, by that, which coſts
<pb n="273" facs="tcp:100776:173"/>
vs ſo deare; for we often goe with it to Hell; and we buy no other thing, by meanes therof, then endleſſe torment, in euerlaſting fire. O that all men would, at length, reſolue, to hold it but for earth, which is good for nothing? How orderly would the world then proceed? How free would all places be, from vniuſt contracts? &amp; how ſince<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rely would all men performe acts of freindſhip, if once there raigned no intereſt, either of Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour, or monie, in the mindes of men? For my part, I conceiue, that the world, would be re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duced, to good order.</p>
            <p>This Soule ſees alſo then, that there is a great blindnes, in the conceipt, which men frame, about the delights of this world; and how we buy nothing, by their meanes, euen for this very life, which we leade heer, but affliction, and diſquiet. How great diſquiet, and how little con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tentment? and, in fine, what a deale of labouring in vaine? And heer, is the Soule able to diſcerne, not only groſſe Cobwebs, and great faults, but euen anie poore graine of duſt, how little ſoeuer, it may be; and ſo, how much ſoeuer ſhe may haue laboured, to perfect her ſelf, if once the Sunne shine bright, and if the ſame Sunne ſtrike it through, with thoſe beames, in good earneſt, she will find it to be duſtie enough. It is like a Glaſſe, full of water, which you will hold to be very cleare, and pure, vnleſſe the Sunne shine vpon it; but if you ſee it once falne vpon, by thoſe beames, you will find it to be all, full of moates.
<pb n="274" facs="tcp:100776:174"/>
This Compariſon is very literally true; for, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore the Soule is in this Extaſis, she conceiues her ſelf, to haue been very carefull, not to offend Almightie God; &amp; that she performed it accord<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to the vttermoſt of her power; but yet being come once ſo farre, as that this Sunne of Iuſtice shines vpon her, which makes her open her eyes, she then ſees ſo many moates therin, that she would be glad, if she could tell how, to shut them againe; for she is not yet, become ſo true an Eaglet, of this ſwift, and ſtrong Eagle, which bred her, as that she can be able to looke earneſtly vpon this Sunne. But, how little ſoeuer she chance to hold them open, she ſees her ſelf all impure; and calls that Verſe to minde, which ſaith: <hi>VVho shall euer be iuſt, in thy preſence?</hi> When once she beholds this Diuine Sunne, her ſight is dazled, by the brightnes of it; but when she lookes in, vpon her ſelf, her eyes are ſtopped vp, with clay; and ſo this poore Doue, is blind; yea, and it happens manie times, that she alſo remaines blind, for good, and all; as being abſorpt, amazed, and, as it were, out of her witts, with ſo manie mightie greatneſſes, as she is then, growne to ſee. Heer, finally, is true Humilitie acquired; not careing, anie way at all, either to ſpeake well of her ſelf, or yet, that others should doe it. And our Lord deuides, and diſpo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes of the Fruit of this Garden; not she; and ſo, there ſticks nothing of it, to her fingars. All the good, which she hath, goes on, as ſtill addreſſed to Almightie God; and if she be drawne to ſay
<pb n="275" facs="tcp:100776:174"/>
anie thing of her ſelf, it is alſo directed to his glorie; for she knowes, that she hath no intereſt therin; and cannot be ignorant therof, euen though she would; as diſcerning it, by the verie ſight of her eyes, which are shut towards the things of this world, but which are ſtill kept open, for the vnderſtanding of Truths, almoſt whether she will, or no.</p>

               <p>She proſecutes, and finishes, this last Degree of Prayer. She declares, vvhat the Soule finds therein, vvhen she returnes to liue againe, in the vvorld; and the Light alſo, vvhich our Lord giues, concerning the deceipts, and errours of the ſame vvorld. This Chapter deliuers excellent Doctrine.</p>
            </argument>
            <p>I Will therefore now finiſh that, which I was ſaying; That, namely, there is heer no more now anie need, that the Soule ſhould giue anie new conſent, ſince already she hath giuen it all; and knowes, that she hath voluntarily, deliuered her ſelf wholy vp, into his hands; and that she cannot deceiue him, who is the knower of all things; for it is not, as things paſſe heer, in this world, where all this life of ours, is full of nothing, but duplicities, and deceipts; and, when you thinke you haue fully gotten the good will of anie
<pb n="276" facs="tcp:100776:175"/>
Creature, by the shew he makes, you quickly come to vnderſtand, that all, is tricks, and lyes; and that no bodie can tell, how to liue in a world of ſo much odd buſines; eſpecially, if there be anie little intereſt of the Parties. But bleſſed is that Soule, which our Lord comes once to draw to the knowledge of ſuch things, as are reall Truths. O what a condition, and fortune were this, for Kings! and how much would it import them, more, to gaine this great aduantage, then to get large Dominions, and States? What rectitude would there be fou<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>d, in the Kingdome? How ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nie miſchiefs, would haue been forborne already, &amp; would alſo be forborne heerafter? For heer, there is no feare of looſing life, or honour, for the loue of Almightie God; but rather ſuch loſſes as theſe, would goe for a great bleſſing, amo<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>gſt ſuch, as find the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>felues carrie another ma<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ner of reſpect, to the honour of our Lord, then to all them, to whome they are leſſe obliged. For, Kings are the men, whome thoſe others follow; and, in this caſe, theſe Kings, would looſe a thouſand Kingdomes; and they would haue great reaſon, to be glad to doe ſo, rather the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> to looſe the meanes, of making one ſtepp further, towards the augmentation of the Holie Catholick Faith, or the procuting ſome light, for Hereticks; for, it is another manner of buſines, to purchaſe, and get ſuch a kind of Kingdome, as will neuer end. And what Soule ſoeuer, shall come to taſt but one ſingle dropp of this water, all the reſt of this whole world, will
<pb n="277" facs="tcp:100776:175"/>
be but fitt, euen to turne the ſtomack.</p>
            <p>But now, if the Soule of ſuch a perſon, should fall out, to be once ingulfed into this water; what ſtrange effects, would it produce? Deare Lord, if thou shouldſt draw me, to ſuch a condition, as that I might be able to publish this truth, with a lowd voice, they would yet beleiue mee, no more, then they doe others, who know, how to pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bliſh the ſame, after a much better manner. But yet, at leaſt, I ſhould giue ſatisfaction to my ſelf; and, me thinkes, I ſhould eſteem, euen my verie life, but at a little rate, vpon condition, that I might be able to giue but ſome one, of theſe ſingle Truths, to be well vnderſtood. And yet I know not, what I ſhould be able to doe with my ſelf, afterward; for there is no truſt at all, to be had in me, I being that miſerable creature, which I am. Yet ſtill I haue ſo great impulſes, to vtter, and declare theſe things, to ſuch as be in authoritie, and command, that, me thinkes, they doe euen annihilate, and conſume me.</p>
            <p>And yet now, ſince I can doe no more, I re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turne, O my Lord, towards thee, to ſeeke reme<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>die, for all inconueniences; for thou, O my Lord, knoweſt well, how highly glad, I would be, to diſpoſſeſſe my ſelf, euen of all theſe verie Fauours, which, of thy goodnes, thou haſt vouchſafed to doe me (prouided alwayes, that I might ſtill re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maine, in condition, neuer to offend thee more) and to reſigne them vp, to <note n="*" place="margin">Her great zeale for the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uerſion of Kings.</note> Kings, and Princes; for then, it is very certaine, that it would
<pb n="278" facs="tcp:100776:176"/>
be wholy impoſſible for them, either to permit, that thoſe things ſhould be done, which are per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitted; or yet, that they ſhould faile, to receiue extraordinarie bleſſings, at thy hand. O make them, my God, vnderſtand, to how much they are obliged, ſince thou wert pleaſed (by what I haue heard) to honour them, in ſuch ſort, vpon earth, as that, when thou takeſt anie of them away, there is ſome kind of <note n="*" place="margin">She alludes to Comets, and bla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zing Starrs.</note> ſignification therof, euen in the Heauens. And, when I thinke of this, it breeds a kind of deuotion in me, that thou, O my King, maiſt be pleaſed to make them, euen heerby, vnderſtand, that they ought to imitate thee, in their life; ſince there grow, in ſome ſort, to be certaine apparances, and ſignes, in Heauen, at their death; as there was, when euen thy ſelf cameſt to dye. I ſee well, that I am preſuming very farre; but I beſeech your Reuerence, teare it, if you miſlike it, and beleiue, that I would be glad, to ſpeake it better, if I were preſent with them; and if I could tell, how; and eſpecially, if I thought, that they would beleiue me; for I recommend them, very much, to Almightie God; and I wiſh, that it might doe them good. When a bodie reſolues to venture his life, he may, in effect, doe what he liſts; and I deſire very often, to looſe mine; for, that were to venture little, for the gaining of much. But now, one may thinke, that there is ſcarce anie Creature in the world, who indeed liues; co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ſidering how groſsly viſible, that great deceipt, and errour, is, which we carrie
<pb n="279" facs="tcp:100776:176"/>
about vs; and with what blindnes, we conuerſe, in this world.</p>
            <p>But, when once the Soule comes to the paſſe, of this Water, they are not bare deſires, which ſhe carries, for the ſeruice of Almightie God; for then, his Diuine Maieſtie giues her ſtrength alſo, to put them in execution. Nor can there anie ſuch thing be once repreſented to her, wherein ſhe may thinke to ſerue him, vpon which ſhe will not caſt her ſelf, all at once; and yet ſhe will thinke, all the while, that ſhe is doing nothing; for now ſhe ſees very clearly, that all things are meerly nothing, which concerne not the giuing guſt to Almightie God. The onlie trouble, in this caſe, is, that there is nothing indeed, deſeruing truly the name of trouble, which will offer it ſelf, to anie ſuch perſon, as is ſo very vnprofitable, as I am. But be thou, O my eternall Good, ſo well pleaſed, as that once, ſome ſuch little moment of time may occurr, as wherein, I may be able to pay the leaſt imaginable crumme, of all that great ſeruice, which I owe thee. Ordaine thou things, O my Lord, in what ſort thou wilt; ſo that yet, this poore creature of thine, may once be able to pay thee ſome little ſeruice. There haue been other manner of woemen; in the world, who haue done heroicall things, for loue of thee; but I am good for nothing, but to prate; and ſo it is not thy pleaſure, O my Lord, to employ me, about putting anie thing in execution; but that all the ſeruice, which I am to doe thee, muſt paſſe
<pb n="280" facs="tcp:100776:177"/>
away in words, and deſires; yea and euen I haue not libertie in this little; and peraduenture I ſhould be faultie, in all. But ſtrengthen thou my Soule, and diſpoſe of it firſt, O thou, the Good of all Goods, my deare Ieſus; and then ordaine things in ſuch ſort, as that I may once, be able to doe ſomewhat for thee; and that there may be no ſuch Creature in the world, as ſhould endure to receiue ſo much; and yet withall, to pay nothing. Let it coſt, O my Lord, what it can; but let not theſe hands of mine, appeare alwaies ſo very emp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie in thy preſence, ſince Rewards are to be ſet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out, and giuen, according to the Workes. Behold, heer is my Life, heer is my Honour, and heer is my Will; and thou knoweſt, that I haue giuen it all, to thee; and am entirely thine; and therefore, diſpoſe of me, according to thine owne good pleaſure. I ſee, O my Lord, very well, how little I am able to execute; but yet being now come to thee, and hauing mounted-vp to this Tower, from which, Truths are truly diſcouered, if thou de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>part not from me, there is nothing, which I shall not be able to performe; and yet, if thou depart, how little ſoeuer that may be, I am to goe, where I was; which is, into a kind of being in Hell.</p>
            <p>O what it is, for a Soule, which findes her ſelf, in ſuch condition, as this, to be put to returne a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gaine, to conuerſe in the world; and to behold, and ſee, the Antick, and fantaſticall Puppet-Playes of this life, which are ſo ridiculously ordered; and to ſpend time, in complying with this Bodie of
<pb n="281" facs="tcp:100776:177"/>
ours, both by ſleeping, and eating; for, all this, wearies the Soule, which knowes not, how to ſcape from thence, but finds it ſelf to be ſurprized, and enchained. It then ſees, much more euidently, the true captiuitie, wherein we remaine, by the verie condition of theſe Bodies of ours, and by the miſerie of theſe liues, which we leade; and then, we come to know, very well, the much reaſon, which S. Paul had, to beſeech Almightie God, to deliuer him from it; wherein, he cryes<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out alowd, and beggs libertie, of his Diuine Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ieſtie; as I haue formerly ſayd. But now, this is often done, with ſo very great impulſe of minde, that the Soule would euen faine get out of the Bodie, in purſuite of this libertie; and, in the meane time, ſince ſhe cannot be freed, ſhe <note n="*" place="margin">A rare expreſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion.</note> walkes vp, and downe the world, like one, who were ſold for ſome Slaue, to ſerue, and play the Drudge, in a ſtrange Country. And that, which afflicts her yet more, is, that ſhe knowes not, how to meet with manie, who will be ſo well diſpoſed, as to lament with her, and to deſire that, which ſhe deſires; for they ordinarily, deſire but to liue. O that once we might be vntyed from all things! and that we might not place our con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tentment, in anie thing of this world! How would then, that paine, which we ſhould find to be liuing alwaies without God, appeaſe, and temper the feare of death, through the deſire, which, by this meanes, we ſhould haue, of attain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to the fruition of eternall life.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="282" facs="tcp:100776:178"/>
Sometimes, when I am conſidering, how ſuch a Creature, as I, to whome our Lord hath giuen this light, with ſuch an imperfect kind of charitie, as I poſſeſſe, and with ſo poore repoſe, as I enioy, (ſince my life hath deſerued no better) can yet ſo often find my ſelf in diſtreſſe, for being in this banniſhment of mine. I may eaſily grow to ima<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gine, what kind of ſenſe, and feeling, that would be, which Saints haue had in this caſe; and what kind of commotion, a S. Paul, and a S. Marie Magdalen, and ſuch others, like them, would find in themſelues, in whome the fire of the Loue of Almightie God, did raigne. It muſt certainly haue been, a continuall Martyrdome to them. To me it ſeemes, that all the eaſe, or rather indeed, abſence of paine, which I might be able to find in this world, were, but to treat with ſome ſuch perſons, as in whome I might be able to meet with ſuch deſires, as theſe; I ſay, deſires, with deeds; and I ſay yet againe, with deeds. For, there are certaine people in the world, who, if you will beleiue themſelues, are abſolutly vntyed from the world, &amp; ſo they publish, that they are; and ſo indeed, it is very fitt, they were; becauſe euen their verie profeſſion, and condition, re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quires as much; and ſo alſo doe thoſe manie yeares, ſince they beganne to enter into the way of Perfection. But yet, this Soule of mine, knowes well, how to find a difference, euen from farre off, between ſuch, as deſire theſe things, but in words; and ſuch others, as confirme their words,
<pb n="283" facs="tcp:100776:178"/>
by their workes. For she knowes, how to vnderſtand, very well, the little good, which theſe doe in the world, and the much, which is done by thoſe others; and indeed, this is ſuch a kind of thing, as whoſoeuer is of expe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rience, may very eaſily diſcerne.</p>
            <p>And now I haue ſett downe the Effects, which thoſe Rapts, that proceed from the Spirit of Al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mightie God, are wont to produce. It is true, that ſome of them, doe it more; and ſome, leſſe; I ſay leſſe; becauſe, though in the beginnings they worke, yet then, the Effects are not ſeen experi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mentally, by way of outward expreſſion; nor can it be yet, ſo well perceiued, that they haue them; and beſides, the perfection therof, goes increaſing; and the Soule goes procuring, that there may now, be no memorie of imperfections; which will appeare if there be any, like ſo many Cobwebs; and this now requires ſome time. And by how much the more, Humilitie, and the Loue of our Lord, encreaſes in the Soule: ſo much the more ſweet, and fresh odour, will theſe Flowers of vertue, be ſure to giue, both to themſelues, and others. And it is moſt certainly true, that our Lord knowes, how to worke ſo well, vpon anie Soule, in one of theſe Rapts, that there will not much remaine, for the Soule her ſelf, to worke, and labour in, towards the acquiring of perfec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion. For, no Creature is able to beleiue, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out direct experience vpon himſelf, how much it pleaſes our Lord, to beſtow vpon a Soule, in ſuch
<pb n="284" facs="tcp:100776:179"/>
an occaſion, as this; nor is there anie kind of di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligence of ours, which can, in my opinion, attaine it. I ſay not, but that, by the Fauour of our Lord, ſuch as employ themſelues manie yeares, by thoſe wayes, which they preſcribe, who write of Prayer, both concerning the beginning, and pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceeding therof, may ariue to perfection, and to a totall vntying, and looſening themſelues, from the things of this world, with much labour, and paines, but neuer in ſo short a time; whereas heer, our Lord is pleaſed to worke it, &amp; that preſently, without anie labour of ours. And he expreſly, &amp; clearly, drawes the Soule from the earth, and whatſoeuer is earthlie; and he giues her an abſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lute dominion ouer all things, which are therin; though yet there be not, in this Soule, anie more true value, or merit, then there was, euen in mine. Nor doe I know, how to exaggerate this point more; for in mine, there was, in effect, none at all. If now it chance to be asked, why his Diuine Maieſtie doth it, there is no other anſwer, but becauſe he is pleaſed to doe it; and he doth it alſo iuſt ſo, as he is pleaſed; and though ſometimes there be no diſpoſition in her at all, to receiue it, he yet diſpoſes alſo the ſame, to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiue that benefit, and bleſſing, which his Diuine Maieſtie is pleaſed to impart. So that he giues it not alwayes, becauſe the Gardner hath deſerued it, by dreſſing vp, and cultiuating his Garden well, (though yet it be very certaine, that who<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſoeuer doth this, as he ought, and doth procure,
<pb n="285" facs="tcp:100776:179"/>
withall, to vntye his whole affection from things of this world, will neuer faile to be regaled by him) but ſometimes, becauſe it is his pleaſure (as I haue ſayd) to ſhew his power, and greatnes, euen vpon the moſt barren Soile; and to prepare it, for the receauing all kind of good. So that now, ſhe ſeemes not, in ſome ſort, to haue ſo much as a Power, to returne to liue in offence of Almightie God, as ſhe was wont; but ſhe hath her thoughts ſo habituated to vnderſtand what is Truth indeed, that all the reſt, ſeemes but a foolerie, and fitt to make ſport for children. She ſmiles alſo in her ſelf ſometimes, when ſhe findes certaine graue perſons, who liue in the exerciſe of Prayer, and Religion, make account of certaine fooliſh points of Honour, which ſuch a Soule, as this, holds now to be directly, vnder her feet. Some will ſay, that this is but diſcretion, and a preſeruing, forſooth, of their dignitie, and ranke; that ſo, afterward, they may be able, to doe the more good. But, that other Soule, vnderſtands very well, that they might haue done Almightie God more ſeruice, in one day, if they would haue made their authoritie, and honour yeild, and ſhrinke, for the loue of Almightie God, then they would euer doe, in ten yeares, by vphold<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, and authorizing the ſame, after their way. But thus doth this kind of Soule lead a certaine troubleſome life, and is euer ſubiect to the Croſſe; though yet euer going on, with encreaſe. And though the perſons, who vſe to treat with
<pb n="286" facs="tcp:100776:180"/>
her, conceiue her ſometimes, to be euen already, at the verie verie topp of Perfection, yet doe they find, ſhortly after, that ſtill ſhe growes to be more improued; for, our Lord goes euer fauouring her, more and more. God himſelf, is, in effect, her Soule; and it is he, who hath already taken the charge of her, into his hands; and he ſhines euen brightly, in her; and ſeemes to be aſſiſting her, after a kind of euident manner; both that ſhe may not offend him, and by continually alſo fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uouring, and ſtirring her ſtill vp, to ſerue him.</p>
            <p>When once my Soule ariued ſo farre, as that Almightie God might be pleaſed to doe her this great Fauour, my miſeries, and Sinnes, did ceaſe, euen all at once, and our Lord gaue me ſtrength, to quitt them; and it moued me no more, to be afterward in thoſe occaſions of imperfection; and with perſons, who had formerly been wont to to bring diſtractions vpon me, then if I had not been there, at all; nay rather that, which was wont to damnifve me, grew to aſſiſt me now; and all things were now, fitt meanes, to make me know God more, and to loue him better; and to ſee, how deeply I was obliged to him; and to make me, in fine, very ſorrie, for what I had been.</p>
            <p>But yet I well vnderſtood withall, that this came no way from me; nor had I growne to gaine it, by anie diligence of mine owne; nor indeed, had I euen had time for it; but only his Diuine Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ieſtie, through the meer, and onlie motiue of his
<pb n="287" facs="tcp:100776:180"/>
owne goodnes, had giuen me ſtrength, for this purpoſe. From the time, when our Lord was pleaſed to afford me the Fauour of theſe Rapts, this ſtrength hath gone on, with encreaſe; and he hath alſo held me ſo faſt, with his hand, that I might not returne back againe, anie more. And now, me thinkes, that it is nothing at all, which I doe on my part; but I vnderſtand, in a very eui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent manner, that our Lord is he, who workes; and therefore I am apt to be of opinion, that the perſon, to whome our Lord doth ſhew theſe Fauours (ſuppoſing euer, that, with all humilitie, and feare, he will vnderſtand, and acknowledge, that it is our Lord himſelf, who doth them, and that, in effect, we doe nothing at all in the buſines) may put himſelf into anie companie; and that, how diſtracted, and vitious ſoeuer it be, it will not moue, or euen concerne him, but that rather, it will be of helpe to him, and miniſter him ſome occaſion, or other, whereby he may reape more aduantage, for his owne good.</p>
            <p>For, theſe are already made ſtrong Soules, which our Lord is pleaſed to chooſe, for the helping of others; though yet ſtill, it muſt be conſidered, that this ſtrength proceeds not from themſelues. But when once our Bleſſed Lord brings a Soule ſo neer himſelf, as I haue ſhewed, he goes, by little and little, communicating very great ſecrets to her. And heer, come the true Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uelations, in this kind of Extaſis; and other great Fauours, and Viſions. And all theſe things ſerue
<pb n="288" facs="tcp:100776:181"/>
to make this Soule, both more humble, and more ſtrong; and to giue her grace, to hold all kind of worldlie things, in no account; as alſo to know more clearly, the greatnes of that reward, which our Bleſſed Lord hath prouided for ſuch, as ſerue him. I humbly befeech his Diuine Maieſtie, that the exceſſiue bountie, which he hath vouchſafed to shew, towards this miſerable, ſinnefull Crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, may proue ſome part of a motiue, to make them, who shall read this Diſcourſe, encourage, and animate themſelues, to leaue all things, yea euen abſolutly all, for Almightie God, ſince his Diuine Maieſtie is pleaſed to giue ſo compleat re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards. For we ſee, and that clearly enough, what aduantages, and Fauours, and retributions, he is pleaſed to allow, euen in this life, to ſuch as ſerue him; and what then will he be ſure to doe for them, in the next?</p>

She ſpeakes alſo of an errour, vvherein once she vvas. This Chapter containes matter of much profit.</p>
            </argument>
            <p>I Will heer declare a certaine thing, which is, in my opinion, very important; and, if your Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uerence thinke fitt, it may ſerue you, for a word of aduiſe; yea and perhaps, you may grow euen to haue need therof. I haue read in ſome Bookes, written of Prayer, which affirme, that, how ſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>euer the Soule is not able, of it ſelf, to ariue to that State, whereof I ſpake before, (becauſe all that, is Supernaturall, which our Lord workes there) yet ſhe may be able, forſooth, to help her ſelf therin, by raiſing-vp her Spirit aboue all things created; and that ſo, ſhe hauing raiſed it vp, manie yeares togeather, with humilitie, and hauing firſt paſſed through the <hi>Purgatiue</hi> way, and after that, through the <hi>Illuminatiue,</hi> they aduiſe, in
<pb n="290" facs="tcp:100776:182"/>
particular manner, that men ſhould ſeparate, and abſtract themſelues, from all kind of imagination or reflection, vpon corporeall things; and that ſo, they ſhould be able to approach, and reach, the contemplation of the Diuinitie. For they ſay, that, although it be euen the verie Humanitie it ſelf, of Chriſt our Lord, yet is it of ſome impediment, to ſuch, as proceed thus farre; yea and that it hinders men, from the moſt perfect kind of Contemplation.</p>
            <p>For the making this Opinion <note n="*" place="margin">Anopi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion, vvhich is more probable, then true.</note> good, they alleadge that, which our Lord ſayd to his Apoſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>les, when himſelf was aſcending-vp to Heauen, of the coming of the Holie-Ghoſt downe vpon them, which would not be accompliſhed, till himſelf were retired out of their ſight. But, for my part, I am apt to conceaue, that if they had then, had that Liuelie Faith, of our Lord's being both God, and Man, (which they had, after the coming of the Holie Ghoſt) his Corporall Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſence would haue done them no hurt at all. For he held no ſuch diſcourſe to his Bleſſed Mother, though ſhe loued him much more, then they all. But theſe men vſe to alleadge this paſſage, or place of Scripture; becauſe it ſeemes to them (in regard, that all this action of Prayer, is a worke of Spirit) that euerie Corporeall Obiect, will be able to diuert, and hinder it; and that, forſooth, they muſt conſider themſelues, after a manner, which is totally independent vpon Creatures; and that God is alike neer them, on all ſides; and
<pb n="291" facs="tcp:100776:182"/>
ſo, to ſee themſelues ingulfed in him, is the thing, which they ſhould endeauour to obtaine.</p>
            <p>Now, this doth not diſpleaſe me, to be vſed, at ſometimes, and in ſome caſes; but yet, to denide our ſelues wholy, from the perſon of Chriſt our Lord, and to bring that Diuine Bodie of his, into the account, and companie of theſe miſeries of ours, or euen with all the reſt of the whole created world, I can by no meanes ondure; and I humbly begg of his Diuine Maieſtie, that I may be able to giue my ſelf to be vnderſtood.</p>
            <p>I will not yet, put my ſelf to contradict them, becauſe they are learned men, and ſpirituall perſons; who faile not to know well, what they ſay; and it is alſo very true, that it pleaſes Almightie God, to carrie, and conduct Soules, by ſeuerall walkes, and wayes, as he did mine. And now, I will declare ſome particulars thereof; for, in the reſt, I will not interpoſe my ſelf, but only ſpeake of the danger, wherein I found I was, becauſe I conformed my ſelf, to what I had read. I well beleiue, that whoſoeuer ſhall find himſelf to haue ariued to the State of Vnion, and not to haue paſſed further on, ſo farre as to haue Rapts, and Viſions, togeather with ſuch other Fauours, as our Lord is wont to im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>part to Soules, may hold that, which is ſpoken of, to be better; as I alſo did. But yet, if I had con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinued therein, I beleiue, I ſhould neuer haue ari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ued to that pitch, wherein now I am. For, in my opinion, it is an errour, <note n="*" place="margin">This ſeems to haue been a foolish, and ill<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fauoured kind of errour in thoſe others.</note> and deceipt; though yet
<pb n="292" facs="tcp:100776:183"/>
perhaps, it may be my ſelf, who am the perſon deceiued; &amp; yet I will relate, what hapned to me. Whilſt I was in want of a Directour, and the while, went reading the Bookes afforeſayd, whereby I thought I grew to vnderſtand ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>what; by little, and little, I came, indeed, to find afterward, that, if our Lord had not been my teacher, I ſhould haue learnt very little, by thoſe Bookes; For, really, it was nothing, which I vnderſtood, till his Diuine Maieſtie was pleaſed to make me know it, by experience; nor indeed, did I know, what I did. But, when afterward I came ſo farre, as to haue ſome kind of Prayer, which was Supernaturall (I meane, the Prayer of Quiet) I procured to diſmiſſe my ſelf of all kind of Corporeall Obiects; though yet, I durſt not goe raiſing, and exalting my Soule. For, conſider<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing that I was alwaies ſo very wicked, I ſaw, that this was to be a great preſumption, in me. But then I came to thinke, that I felt a kind of Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſence of Almightie God, in me, after a particular manner, as indeed I did; and I procured, to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>collect my ſelf, with him. And this is a very ſauourie, and guſtfull kind of Prayer, if our Lord aſſiſt a Soule particularly therein; and the delight of it, is great; and when both the profit, and pleaſure, which it giues, is once obſerued by the Soule, there could be then, no meanes, to make me returne againe, to the Humanitie of Chriſt our Lord; becauſe, in realitie of truth, I concei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ued, that it was an impediment to me.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="293" facs="tcp:100776:183"/>
Othou Lord of my Soule, and my Good! thou, Chriſt our Lord, who wert Crucifyed; I neuer call to minde the opinion, which I entertained in this caſe, but I am afflicted by it. For I conceaue my ſelf, to haue committed a huge Treaſon therin, againſt thee; (though yet my ignorance may peraduenture haue been ſome excuſe) I hauing been ſo particularly deuoted, to the perſon of Chriſt our Lord, throughout the whole courſe of my life; for, this other proceeding of mine, occurred in the verie latter part therof; I ſay, in the verie latter part, immediatly before our Bleſſed Lord vouchſafed me thoſe Fauours, of Rapts, and Viſions.</p>
            <p>I continued a very little while, in this opinion; and ſo I euer came quickly back, to delight my ſelf, with this deare Lord of mine; and eſpecially, when I receiued the Bleſſed Sacrament, I euer deſired to haue ſome Picture of him, in mine eye, ſince I was not able to carrie him ſo deeply en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>grauen, or ſtamped vpon my Soule, as I could haue wiſhed. But is it poſſible, O my deare Lord, that euer anie ſuch thought, as this, ſhould be able to get in, to my hart, euen for one ſingle hower, as that thou wert to haue been able to hinder my obtaining my greateſt Good? Alas, from whence came all the Benedictions, and benefits, which euer I receiued, but only from thee? But I will not ſo much as thinke, that really I was faultie heerin; but rather I am to pittie my ſelf for that, which certainly proceeded from ig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>norance
<pb n="294" facs="tcp:100776:184"/>
in me. And ſo, thou didſt vouchſafe, through thy goodnes, to redreſſe, and aſſiſt me, by helping me to one afterward, who might deliuer me out of this errour; and beſides, alſo, by making me able to ſee thee ſo often, <note n="*" place="margin">That vvas, by ſeuerall Viſions.</note> as I ſhall declare heerafter; that ſo I might the more clearly vnderſtand, how great that ignorance of mine, was; and finally, to the end, that I might publiſh the ſame, to manie, as I haue done already; and that now, I might alſo record it heer.</p>
            <p>For my part, I conceiue, that the reaſon, why manie Soules get not forward, in the way of Profit, and why they reach not to obtaine ſome very great libertie of Spirit, when they ariue to vſe Prayer of Vnion, is this verie thing. And I conceiue, that there are two reaſons, vpon which, I may well ground this opinion; and though perhaps, that be of no moment, which I am going to vtter, yet I will not forbeare to doe it; becauſe I haue found by experience, that it went very ill with my Soule, till it pleaſed our Bleſſed Lord, to giue me light. For, all thoſe Ioyes, which ſhe tooke, came to me, but by ſupps, and gulps; and when once I was paſt the preſent oc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>caſion, I found not my ſelf, to haue ſuch compa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nie, and ſtrength, for the enduring of tribulations, and temptations, as yet I mett with, afterward. But one of theſe reaſons, why men get not forward, is, that there may peraduenture goe a dramme of ſome certaine little want of Humilitie, which lyes hidden, and plaiſtered ouer, in ſuch ſort, that
<pb n="295" facs="tcp:100776:184"/>
euen the perſon, who is ſo faultie, may, perhaps, not ſo very eaſily, find it. And who now, will euer be ſo proud, and wretched, as I; yea and that, when he ſhould haue laboured, throughout the whole courſe of his life, and made as manie Prayers, and ſuffered as manie Pennances, and endured as manie Perſecutions, as might be ima<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gined, would not yet find himſelf rich enough, and abundantly rewarded, and payd for them all, when our Lord ſhould giue him leaue, to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maine at the foot of the Croſſe, with S. Iohn? Nay I know not, into what braine it would ſinke, but mine, not to be content, with ſuch a felicitie, as this; who was euer a looſer ſo manie wayes, in all thoſe things, whereby I ought to haue been a gainer.</p>
            <p>But now, though our miſerable fraile condi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, or els, perhaps, our ſicknes, ſhould not permit vs, to be alwayes reflecting vpon the Paſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion of our Bleſſed Lord; yet at leaſt, what ſhould hinder vs from remaining with him, now, that he is riſen againe, to Glorie; ſince we haue him ſo neare vs, in the Bleſſed Sacrament of the Aultar, where we ſee him glorifyed now? Nor need we behold him there, ſo diſtreſſed; and ſo afflicted; ſo torne in peices; ſo ouerflowing with bloud; ſo wearied in thoſe rugged High-Wayes; ſo perſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cuted by thoſe, whome he benefited ſo highly; and the while, not ſo much, as to be beleiued in, by his verie Apoſtles. For, it is moſt certainly true, that one hath not alwaies the hart, to be euen
<pb n="296" facs="tcp:100776:185"/>
able, to reflect vpon ſo exceſſiue afflictions, as he felt. But now heer, we haue him without paine, and full of glorie, giuing ſtrength of bodie to ſome, and courage of minde to others, before he aſcended vp to Heauen.</p>
            <p>He makes himſelf euen our Companion, in the Bleſſed Sacrament; yea and ſeemes, as if it had not been in his power, to depart anie one mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment from vs; and that now it ſhould yet haue been in mine, to part from thee, O my Lord! yea and this, that I might ſerue thee, ſo much the better. <note n="*" place="margin">A ſvveet, and iuſt co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>plaint, and vvorthie of the Saint vvho made it.</note> Let it paſſe, my deare Lord, if it pleaſe thee, that when I ſinned againſt thee, I did not know thee; but that now, when I come to know thee, I ſhould fancie a meanes to my ſelf, of growing a greater gainer by this way! O what an ill way was that? and now I find, that indeed I had vtterly loſt my way, if thou, O Lord, hadſt not reſtored me to it; for, in ſeing, that thou art neer me, I haue ſeen, that I haue all good things, with thee. Nor doe I euer meet with anie afflictio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, or trouble, but as ſoone as I conſider, in what kind of miſerable poſture thou wert carried, and placed, before thoſe Iudges, it growes inſtantly, to be very eaſily borne. With the preſence of ſo deare a Freind, and vnder the conduct of ſo good a Captaine, as was pleaſed to put himſelf in the foremoſt ranke, that ſo he might ſuffer moſt, and firſt, there is nothing, which may not well, be endured. He aſſiſts, and giues ſtrength, and cou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rage; yea and neuer failes. He is a very faſt, and
<pb n="297" facs="tcp:100776:185"/>
true Freind; and I ſee clearly, and I haue ſeen it yet againe, that, to the end we may be able to content Almightie God, and that he may powre great Fauours downe vpon vs, he is pleaſed, that all ſhould paſſe, by the hands of this moſt Sacred Humanitie; in which, his Diuine Maieſtie hath declared, that he was much delighted. I haue ſeen this truth, by experience, very, very manie times; beſides, that our Lord himſelf, hath told <note n="*" place="margin">By Viſion.</note> me ſo. I haue alſo clearly ſeen, that we are to enter in, by this gate, if we deſire, that his Soueraigne Maieſtie ſhould communicate great ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crets to our Soules.</p>
            <p>So that, Sir, I wiſh your Reuerence, not to put your ſelf vpon anie other way, then this; though you ſhould be euen vpon the verie higheſt topp of Contemplation; for heer, you ſhall find your ſelf ſafe; ſince this Lord of ours, is he, by whoſe meanes, we are to receiue all Benedictions; and he will addreſſe your life, by your Meditation, vpon his; for he is the beſt Originall, and Patterne, which we can poſſibly haue. And indeed, what can we deſire more, then to haue ſo perfect a Freind, at hand, who will neuer giue vs ouer, in our afflictions, and tribalations; as they, of this world, are wont to doe? Moſt Bleſſed is that man, who loues him, with all ſinceritie of truth; and who is alwaies carrying him, cloſe, to him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf.</p>
            <p>Let vs looke vpon the Glorious S. Paul, who ſeemes, as if he could not ſuffer, that euer the
<pb n="298" facs="tcp:100776:186"/>
name of Ieſus, ſhould be able, to fall often enough, from his mouth; as one, who did not faile, to carrie it well imprinted, vpon his hart. And ſince I vnderſtood of that other abſtracted courſe, whereof I ſpoke, I haue reflected vpon diuerſe great Contemplatiue Saints, with much care; and I find, that they went no other way, then this. S. Francis ſhe wes it plainly, by the Wounds; S. Anthonie of Padua, by the Infant; S. Bernard delighted himſelf much, in the Humanitie of our Bleſſed Lord; and ſo alſo did S. Katherine of Sienna; togeather with manie other Saints, as your Reuerence knowes, better, then I.</p>
            <p>This departing, and abſtracting ones ſelf, from all Corporeall Obiects, ſhould, as it ſeemes, be good, ſince perſons, who are ſo Spirituall, affirme it; but yet, in my opinion, this muſt be vnder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtood of Soules, who are very <hi>Proficient</hi> in Spirit; for, till then, it is euident enough, that the Crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tour is to be ſought, by meanes of the Creatures. But yet, I will vndertake nothing in this caſe, ſince all depends vpon the Fauour, which our Lord is pleaſed to ſhew, to anie Soule. That, which I would faine giue to be vnderſtood, is, that the moſt Sacred Humanitie of Chriſt our Lord, muſt not be made to come into that account; and let this point be well vnderſtood, wherein I would faine know, how to declare my ſelf. When God is pleaſed to ſuſpend all the Powers of the Soule, in thoſe kindes of Prayer, which are related, we haue ſeen plainly, that this
<pb n="299" facs="tcp:100776:186"/>
Preſence of Chriſt our Lord, is taken from vs, whether we will, or no; and let it then, be gone, in a good hower; for, that kind of loſſe, is a happie one, whereby we come to enioy more of that, which we conceiue our ſelues to haue loſt; for then, the Soule employes her ſelf wholy, vpon louing him, whome the Vnderſtanding hath already endeauoured to know; and ſhe loues that, which ſhe did not fully comprehend; and now ioyes in that, wherein ſhe could not alſo haue ioyed, but only by looſing her ſelf, for her greater gaine. But now, that we ſhould, by tricks, and of ſett-purpoſe, accuſtome our ſelues, not to procure, with our whole power, to carrie alwaies in our eyes (and I would to God, it were alwaies) this moſt Sacred Humanitie of Chriſt our Lord; this, I ſay, is that, which I like not; ſince it is a way, of making the Soule walke in the Ayre, as we vſe to ſay. For it ſeemes, that ſhe hath no firme, and ſtable reſting-place, howſoeuer ſhe may make her ſelf beleiue, that ſhe is full of God. It is a great matter, whilſt we liue, and are humane, to procure, to bring God to our ſelues, Humane; for, this is that other inconuenience, which I ſay, there is; for, the firſt, I beganne to ſay, was a little want of humilitie, in preſuming to raiſe the Soule, before our Lord raiſed her, and not to content her ſelf, with meditating vpon a thing ſo pretious, but that ſhe will needs be a Marie, before ſhe haue taken the paines of Martha. If our Lord himſelf be pleaſed, that we
<pb n="300" facs="tcp:100776:187"/>
be Marie, there will be nothing to be feared, though it ſhould be, vpon the verie firſt day, of our doing him Seruice. But yet, let vs conſider well, of the matter, as I thinke I was ſaying before; for, this ſmall moate of little humilitie, will make a ſhift to doe a great deale of hurt, againſt profit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing in the way of Contemplation.</p>
            <p>But, to returne now to the Second point, We are no Angells, but we haue Bodies; and to deſire, to make our ſelues Angells, whilſt yet we are vpon earth, (and eſpecially if they be ſo earthlie, as I was,) is a kinde of follie, or madnes. But our thoughts, in the ordinarie way, haue need of a kind of leaning, or reſting-place; though yet ſometimes, the Soule may goe ſo out of her ſelf, yea and manie times, may be ſo full of Almightie God, that perhaps ſhe hath no neęd to recollect her ſelf, by meanes of anie thing created. But this is not a thing ſo ordinarie; and in buſineſſes, and perſecutions, and troubles, when ſhe cannot enioy ſo much Quiet; and in the times alſo of Dryneſſe, and dulneſſe, Chriſt our Lord is wont, to be a very good freind. For, we conſider him, as man; and we behold him, full of weakneſſes, and afflictions; and he is companie, fitt for all good occaſions; and when once, we are a little accuſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tomed, we ſhall finde him very eaſily kept cloſe, to vs; though yet ſome ſuch times will occurr, as that we ſhall not be able to doe, neither the one, nor the other.</p>
            <p>Vpon this reaſon, it will be well, to doe that,
<pb n="301" facs="tcp:100776:187"/>
whereof I haue ſpoken already; namely, not to pretend, and procure any ſenſible conſolation of Spirit, but let anie thing ariue, that will; for it is no toy, or trifle, to embrace the Croſſe of our Lord. This Lord of ours, was forſaken, by all manner of comfort; and they left him all alone, in his afflictions; but yet let not vs doe ſo. For he will reach vs his hand, which can raiſe vs better vp, then all our owne diligences, would haue been able to doe; and yet he will abſent himſelf alſo, when he ſhall thinke fitt; and when he ſhall thinke it fitt, he will alſo draw the Soule out of it ſelf, as I haue ſayd before. Our Lord is very well pleaſed, to ſee a Soule, with Humilitie, introduce his Sonne, for her Interceſſour; and he loues her ſo very much, that euen, when his Diuine Maieſtie ſhall haue an inclination to raiſe her-vp to great Contemplation, the ſame Soule may yet hold her ſelf vnworthie, and cry out, with S. Peter: <hi>Depart from me, O my Lord; for I am a ſinnefull man.</hi> I haue tryed this verie thing, by experience; and thus hath God conducted my Soule. Let others therefore goe, by ſome other ſhort cutt, as they pleaſe; but that, which I haue been able to vnderſtand, is, that all this Ciment of Prayer, is grounded vpon Humilitie; and <note n="*" place="margin">Beleiue and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſider this moſt cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taine Truth.</note> that, the more the Soule is abaſed in that holie exerciſe, the more is it exalted by Almightie God. Nor doe I remember, that euer he ſhewed me anie of thoſe ſingular Mercies, of which I ſhall ſpeake after<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward; but when I found my Soule, euen as it

were annihilated, with obſeruing my ſelf, to be ſo very wicked. Yea and ſometimes, his Diuine Maieſtie tooke care to giue me to vnderſtand certaine things, towards the making me know my ſelf, ſo much the better, which I could neuer haue told, how to imagine.</p>
            <p>But I am of opinion, that when the Soule doth anie thing on her part, to help her ſelf on, as af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>foreſayd, towards that Prayer of Vnion; how ſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>euer, for the preſent, it may ſeem to doe good, yet the building will quickly fall, as wanting anie ſound foundation; and I am afrayd, that ſhe will neuer ariue to true Pouertie of Spirit, which con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiſts, in not deſiring ſo much as comfort, or guſt, in Prayer; (for, all thoſe of this world, are forſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken already, except conſolation in affliction; and that, for loue of him, who euer liued in them) but to remaine alſo quiet in thoſe verie afflictio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>s, and aridities; for though they faile not, to haue ſome little trouble thereat; yet is it not ſo farre, as to giue them anie ſuch diſquiet, and paine, as ſome giue themſelues, by conceiuing, that, if they be not alwaies labouring with their Vnderſtand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, and to haue ſenſible deuotion, all is loſt; as if they could deſerue ſo great a good, by the paines they take. I ſay not, that they ſhould not procure, and maintaine themſelues with much care, in the Preſence of Almightie God; but, if yet they be not able to obtaine, no not ſo much, as one good thought (as I haue ſayd els where) yet let them not torment themſelues; becauſe we
<pb n="303" facs="tcp:100776:188"/>
all, are vnprofitable Seruants; &amp; what can we con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiue, that wee ſhall be euer able to doe? Our Lord is much better pleaſed, that we may come to know this truth; and that we may hold our ſelues fitt, to be treated, like ſome poore little Aſſes, to turne that wheele about, whereby the ſayd Water is to be gotten; who though they be put in, blind<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fold, &amp; doe not ſo much as know, what they doe, will yet get-vp more water, then the Gardner, with all the diligences he can vſe. No, we muſt walke in this way, with libertie of Spirit, &amp; put our ſelues into the hands of Almighty God. If his Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uine Maieſtie ſhall be pleaſed, to aduance vs, to be of his Chamber, &amp; Councell, we muſt goe with a good will; but if not, we muſt be content to ſerue, in inferiour employments, and not to ſeate our ſelues, in the beſt place, as I haue ſayd els where.</p>
            <p>Almightie God hath more care of vs, then we haue of our ſelues; and knowes, for what, euerie bodie is fitt; and for what therefore doth it ſerue, for him, to gouerne himſelf, when already the whole Will is diſpoſed of, and giuen away, to Almightie God? In my opinion it is leſſe to be tollerated, or endured heer, then in the Firſt Degree of Prayer; and it doth vsmuch more harme, if any ſuch errour be committed by vs; for, theſe are Supernaturall bleſſings. If a man haue an ill voice, how much ſoeuer he ſhall en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>force himſelf to ſing, the voice will not be made good by it; but if God ſhall once haue made it good, he needes not be crying out, before hand.
<pb n="304" facs="tcp:100776:189"/>
Let vs therefore alwaies humbly pray him, to ſhew vs fauour; &amp; let the Soule be wholy reſigned, but yet withall, confiding in the greatnes of God.</p>
            <p>And now, when ſhe hath gotten leaue, to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maine at the feet of Chriſt our Lord, let her not ſtirre from thence, but continue, in what ſort ſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>euer it may be; and let her imitate the <hi>Magdalena;</hi> for when he shall find her ſtrong, he will take her vp, with him, to the Deſert. So that your Reuere<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ce shall doe well, to keepe your ſelf in this way; till you meet with ſome other, who may haue more experience, then I; and may know it better. Only, if they be perſons, who were but beginning to haue guſt in Almightie God, doe not beleiue them; for they conceiue, that they profit them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelues more, and haue more guſt, when they helpe themſelues in ſuch ſort, as is declared be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore. O, how Almightie God comes clearly, and openly enough, in, without theſe little prettie helpes, when he hath a minde to it? and ſo, as that, whether we will, or no, he eleuates, and hurries-away the Spirit, euen as ſome Giant would diſpoſe of a ſtraw; and ſo, as that no re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiſtance can be thought of. But what a kind of impertinency is it, for a man to beleiue, that whenſoeuer he liſts, a Toade ſhould be made able to flye, of it ſelf? And I hold it to be a more difficult, and abſurd kind of thing, that the Spirit should be able to raiſe, and exalt it ſelf without being exalted, and raiſed by Almightie God; for, it is, all, loaden with earth, and with a thouſand
<pb n="305" facs="tcp:100776:189"/>
impediments; and it will proue, to be of little vſe, to it, that it haue a minde to flye; for, though flying be more naturall to a Soule, then to a Toade, yet this Soule, is already all plunged in a great bed of dutt, &amp; myre, as haueing loſt that other qualitie, by her owne fault.</p>
            <p>I will therefore conclude with this, that when<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſoeuer we diſpoſe our ſelues, to thinke, and medi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tate vpon Chriſt our Lord, we muſt remember the loue, wherewith he did vs ſo manie Fauours; and now greatly, Almightie God was pleaſed to ſhew it to vs, by giuing vs ſo high a pledge, and pawne, of his loue; for, one loue begetts, and breeds another. And though we ſhould he meer poore beginners, in this holie exerciſe; and though we ſhould withall, be very wicked, yet let vs ſtill procure, to be looking vpon this Obiect, and ſtill be ſtirring our ſelues vp, to loue. For, if once our Bleſſed Lord vouchſafe, to im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>print this loue into our harts, all things will grow eaſie to vs; and we ſhall quickly fall to worke, and that without anie trouble to our ſelues, at all. I beſeech his Diuine Maieſtie, that he will vouch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſafe, to beſtow it vpon vs, ſince he knowes, how very much the ſame imports vs; for, we beggit, by the great loue, which he bore to vs, and for the ſake of his Glorious Sonne, who alſo loued vs all, ſo extreamly, to his owne coſt, Amen.</p>
            <p>One <note n="*" place="margin">A doubt. vvhich cannot eaſily be ſolued.</note> thing I would faine aske your Reuer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence, how our Lord, beginning to doe Fauours to a Soule, and thoſe ſo eminent, and high, as to
<pb n="306" facs="tcp:100776:190"/>
bring her to perfect Contemplation (which Soule were therefore, in all reaſon, to grow, and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maine entirely perfect, euen at that inſtant; for certainly, it ought to be ſo; ſince whoſoeuer re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiues ſo very great bleſſings from Heaue<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, ſhould be extreamly farre from careing for anie ſuch delights, as concerne this life) can poſſibly bring to paſſe, that when ſhe growes to haue Rapts, and ſo to receiue more Fauours, &amp; higher Effects thereof, (and that ſo much the more, as ſhe falls-out to be more vntyed from the world; and conſidering yet withall, how, in the very firſt inſtant, when our Lord ariues to a Soule, he can leaue her entirely ſanctifyed) how, I ſay, our Lord can abandon this Soule afterward, in pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſe of time, without maintaining it, in the per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fection of vertue. This, I ſay, would I very faine know; for I vnderſtand it not yet; though I know well, that it is a very different caſe, what proportion of ſtrength, Almightie God leaues in a Soule, when his viſitation, at the firſt, laſts no longer, then the opening, as it were, and ſhutting of an eye; (for then, in effect, it is ſcarce felt at all, but only by the very effects, which it leaues be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hind it) and when, on the other ſide, this Fauour continues, to be of much longer extent. But it occurrs to mee often, to doubt, whether the cauſe of this, may not be, that the Soule diſpoſes not her ſelf entirely, for God, till his Diuine Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ieſtie bring her vp, and breed her for himſelf, by little, and little; and ſo, beſpeake her to reſolue her
<pb n="307" facs="tcp:100776:190"/>
ſelf, all at once, and giue her the verie ſtrength of a growne man; to the end, that ſhe may caſt all, as it were, a thouſand miles off; as he inſtantly did with S. Marie Magdalen, and as he alſo doth with others, after the rate of their co-operating with him; and as they ſuffer his Diuine maieſtie to diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe of them wholy, according to his owne good pleaſure; for els, we know not, how to beleiue, that, euen in this life, Almightie God giues a hundred for one. I thought alſo of this Compa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riſon, That, ſuppoſing the thing to be all one, which is imparted both to Beginners and Profi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cients, it would be like to ſome one only food, whereof manie feed, all at once; and that they, who eat little of it, preſerue no more memory, and remaine with no more effect of it, then only ſome little ſauour, or ſmack, for a while; but they, who feed more largely, it giues them helpe to ſubſiſt; and they, who feed plentifully on it, receiue encreaſe of ſtrength, and ſpirit, by it; yea and a Soule may feed ſo often, and ſo fully, vpon this food of life, that she may come, not to endure anie thing at all, which shall not taſt, iuſt like that. For she findes the very great benefit, which she receiues by it; and she hath her taſt already, ſo wholy made to that ſweetnes, that she had rather euen leaue to liue, then to feed vpon other things; which, were all, to ſerue, in fine, for nothing, but only to take away the good taſt, which the former excellent food left in her mouth.</p>

Beſides, no conuerſation, with holie companie, is wont to be of ſo much vſe, and benefit, in one day, as in manie; but we may be in it, ſo long, as that we may grow, to be euen like them, our ſelues; if our Lord will be pleaſed, to doe vs ſo much fauour. But, to conclude, the mayne buſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nes conſiſts, in what his Diuine Maieſtie vouch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſafes to doe, and to whome he will be pleaſed, to allow it; though yet withall, it grow to im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>port very much, that whoſoeuer will pretend to receiue this Fauour, muſt fully reſolue himſelf, to be abſolutly diſ-engaged, and vntyed from the whole world, yea and to eſteem that Fauour of our Bleſſed Lord, as highly, as the thing deſerues.</p>
            <p>It alſo ſeemes to me, as if his Diuine Maieſtie, were reſoluing to try, who they are, that loue him; Namely whether it be this Soule, or that; and that he would alſo diſcouer, who himſelf is, by imparting ſo high, and ſoueraigne a delight, to quicken, and fortifye their Faith, if it ſhould chance to be dead, or weake, in the beleif of thoſe great bleſſings, which he meanes to giue her; ſaying: Behold, this, is but a ſingle dropp, of that huge, and vaſt Sea of benedictions, which I meane to giue to ſuch, as I loue. And when he ſees, that they receiue it, as he giues it, he giues not only it, but himſelf with it. In fine, he loues them, who loue him; And O, what a good Louer, and good Beloned, is he?</p>
            <p>Othou, the Lord of my Soule! O that I could find anie fitt words, whereby I might giue to be
<pb n="309" facs="tcp:100776:191"/>
vnderſtood, what thou beſtoweſt vpon ſuch, as truſt thee, home; and what they looſe, who ariue to this condition, and yet will needs remaine ſtill, with themſelues. But doe not, O thou my Lord, permitt this; ſince already thou doſt more, then this, for our ſakes, in coming to ſo baſe, and wicked a lodging, as this of my hart. Bleſſed maiſt thou be, for euer, and for euer, Amen.</p>
            <p>And now I returne, moſt humbly to beſeech your Reuerence, that, if you meane to impart theſe things, which I haue written, concerning my Prayer, they may be very Spirituall perſons to whome yow doe it. For if they vnderſtand no more, then ſome one way; or if they haue remain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed in the half way; they will neuer be ſo well able, to hitt right. Now, there are ſome, whome Almightie God carries inſtantly, by a very ſublime kind of addreſſe; and they perhaps will conceiue, that others, may alſo profit there, and may quiet, and calme the Vnderſtanding; and not ſerue themſelues, at all, of the meanes of anie Corpo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reall obiect; but yet, theſe creatures, with all this, ſhall come, in fine, to remaine as dry, as a ſtick. And ſome, who haue growne to enioy a little Quiet, grow alſo to thinke of this fancie, that, Why, forſooth, may not they be able, to obtaine, as well the one, as the other. But ſuch as theſe, in ſtead of aduancing, in the way of profiting their Soules, ſhall really diſaduantage themſelues, as I haue ſayd. So that, in all this buſines, there will be need, both of experience, and prudence; and

            <p>I will now returne to that place, where I gaue ouer the Diſcourſe of my Life; (for I haue de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tained my ſelf, perhaps, longer then I ought) to the end, that yet that, which followes, may grow to be the better vnderſtood. From hence forward, this will be another new Booke; I meane, another new Life; for hitherto, it was mine; but the Life, which I haue liued, ſince I beganne to declare theſe things of Prayer, is that, when God liued in me, (foraſmuch as I could conceiue) ſince I hold it to be impoſſible otherwiſe, for me, to haue giuen ouer, both ſuch ill actions, and conditions, in ſo ſhort a time. Let our Lord be euerlaſtingly praiſed, for deliuering me, in ſuch ſort, from my ſelf.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="311" facs="tcp:100776:192"/>
But I beginning now, to free my Soule from the occaſions of ill, and to giue my ſelf more, to Prayer, our Lord beganne alſo to doe me Fauours; as one, who, in all apparance, deſired but that I would be content to receiue them. His Diuine Maieſtie, did therefore then, very ordinarily, giue me the Prayer of Quiet; and, manie times, that alſo, of Vnion, which laſted very long fitts of time. But now, when I vnderſtood, that there had oc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>curred great Illuſions of certaine woemen, and deceipts, which the Diuel put vpon them, I be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ganne to be afrayd, as conſidering the delight, and ſweetnes, which I felt, to be ſo very great; yea and that, manie times, it was ſuch, that I could not auoyd it; though yet withall, on the other ſide, I ſaw cauſe of very great ſecuritie, that it was God; eſpecially when I was in Prayer; and I found alſo, that I was much bettered by it; and ſtill remained with more ſtrength of Minde towardes Vertue. But yet, whenſoeuer I grew to be a little diuerted. I returned againe to feare, whether the Diuel might not haue a minde, to make me conceiue, that it were good for me, to ſuſpend the vſe of my vnderſtanding, and ſo, depriue my ſelf of the exerciſe of Mentall Prayer; and that I might not be able to thinke vpon the Paſſion of Chriſt our Lord, nor to ſerue my ſelf (as I was ſaying) of my Vnderſtanding part, which ſeemed to me, a very great inconuenience. But now, when his Diuine Maieſtie was pleaſed already, to giue me light, to the end that I might offend him no more; and
<pb n="312" facs="tcp:100776:193"/>
might alſo grow able to know, how much I owed him for this goodnes, this feare came now to en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>creaſe, in ſuch ſort, that it put me, vpon a diligent <note n="*" place="margin">She grovves novv to make ſerious enquiry after a good Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rectour.</note> ſearch, after ſome perſons of Spirit, with whome I might communicate my affaires; and already I had gotten notice of ſome. For, by this time, they, <hi>of the Societie of</hi> IESVS, were come hither; to which Order (though I yet knew no one of them) I was very affectionate, vpon the onlie reaſon of my vnderſtanding, what kind of life they led, and what Prayer they vſed. But I found not my ſelf worthie enough, to ſpeake with them; nor conſtant, and ſtrong enough, to obey them. And this, gaue me yet greater feare; for, in fine, to treat with them, and yet to continue ſtill, what I was, repreſented it ſelf to me, as an odd, and ill-fauoured buſines. In theſe cogitations of mine, did I paſſe ſome time; till now, by the much bat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terie, which I made vpon my ſelf, and through the feares, to which ſtill I was ſubiect, I reſolued to treat with one, who was a Spirituall perſon; and to aske him, what kind of Prayer that was, which I vſed; and to deſire him, to giue me light, if he found me to be in errour; and I reſolued to vſe all poſſible diligence, not to offend Almightie God; for, the want, which I found, in my ſelf, of courage, did continue me ſtill, in my feares. O my deare God! &amp; how great a deceipt, and errour was this, in me, to ſeperate my ſelf from good, that ſo I might grow to be good. The Diuel, it ſeemes, is willing to labour much, vpon this
<pb n="313" facs="tcp:100776:193"/>
point, in the beginning of our aſpiring to Vertue; for I could not, in fine, conquer my ſelf heerin. He well knowes, that the meanes of doing good to a Soule, conſiſts, in that ſhe reſolue to conferr, in particular manner, with ſuch, as are the freinds of Almightie God; and therefore I would neuer ſett anie time, to reſolue vpon this. I expected to reforme my ſelf firſt, as I had alſo done before, when I left my Prayer; and perhaps I ſhould neuer haue gone through, with it; for I was already declined ſo low, towards certaine little things, of ill cuſtome, and conſequence, (which yet in fine I would not conclude, to be ill) that I was in need, to be aſſiſted, by ſome other, who might reach me out his hand, to raiſe me vp. And now, Bleſſed be our Lord; for, in fine, his owne, was the firſt.</p>
            <p>When now I ſaw, that my feare came-on ſo farre, (for I proceeded, and encreaſed in Prayer) I conceaned, that there was either ſome great good, or els ſome exceſſiue miſcheif, inuolued in it; for already I vnderſtood, very well, that it was a Supernaturall aduantage, which I had; ſince ſometimes, I was not able to reſiſt it; and to ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taine it alſo, when I would, could not poſſibly be done. Vpon this, I grew to reſolue, that there would be no remedie for me, if I <note n="*" place="margin">The only ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cellent courſe.</note> procured nor, to haue great puritie of Co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ſcience, and if I quitted not all occaſions of ill; though it were but of Veniall Sinnes. For, if my exerciſe of Prayer, were of the Spirit of Almightie God, the benefit did
<pb n="314" facs="tcp:100776:194"/>
very euidently appeare; &amp; if it were of the Diuel, yet he could doe me no hurt at all, but rather would be put to ſitt downe with loſſe, if I ſhould procure to pleaſe Almightie God, and not offend him at all. And now, hauing reſolued vpon this, and euer humbly praying our Bleſſed Lord, that he would aſſiſt me; and taking the ſame courſe ſeuerall dayes; I yet found, that my Soule, had not ſtre<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>gth enough, all alone, to goe through, with the obtaining ſo great perfection, in regard of ſome inclination, and liking, which I carried to certaine things; which, howſoeuer they were not very ill, of themſelues, yet they ſerued the turne, to ſpoile all. They told me then, of a certaine Preiſt, in this place, who was a learned man; and whoſe vertue, and good life, our Lord began to diſcouer to the world; and I procured, by meanes of a holie <note n="*" place="margin">This holy ma<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, enters often into the Story of our Saynt.</note> Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uallier, dwelling in the ſame place, to acquaint my ſelf with him. This Cauallier is a married man; but yet leades a life, ſo very full of example, and vertue, and he is of ſo great Prayer, and Charitie, that his perfection ſhines brightly, in the eyes of all men; and with much reaſon, in regard of the great good, which is growne to manie Soules, by his meanes; as alſo by his great tale<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ts. And though he be not forwarded a whitt, by anie plentie in his Fortune; yet he cannot chooſe, but employ the meanes he hath, that way. He is of great vnder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtanding, and of an excellent nature. His conuer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſation, is no way troubleſome; but ſo agreable, and delight full, (togeather with his being iuſt, and
<pb n="315" facs="tcp:100776:194"/>
holie) that it giues guſt to all ſuch, as treat with him. He ordaines, and gouernes all things, for the great good of ſuch Soules, as he conuerſes with; and ſeemes, indeed, to haue no other endeauour, or ayme, then to doe good to all them, whome he findes to be anie way capable thereof; and, finally, to giue contentment to all. Now, this holie, and bleſſed man, doe I eſteem, to haue, by his induſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trie, and charitie, layd the foundation, for the ſal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uation of my Soule. And I am confunded, to thinke of his humilitie, in that he would be con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tent, to ſee me; for there were, as I conceiue, little leſſe then fortie yeares, wherein he had exerciſed Mentall Prayer (they might perhaps be fewer, by two, or three yeares,) and he led his life, with all that perfection, which his condition, and ſtate, might ſeem to permit. He hath a Wife, who is ſo great a Seruant of Al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mightie God, and a woeman, ſo full of charitie, that he looſes nothing at all, by poſſeſſing her. In a word, he choſe her for ſuch a kind of Wife, as whome Almightie God, knew to be fitt for ſo great a Seruant of his. ſome of his kindred, were married to ſome kinſwoemen of mine. And be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſides, I was alſo acquainted with another great Seruant of God, who was married to one of my Coſen-Germans; and I had much acquaintance, there; and, by this meanes, I procured, that the Preiſt, who was his great freind, and withall, ſo great a Seruant of God, might come, and ſpeake with me; for I intended to Confeſſe my ſelf to
<pb n="316" facs="tcp:100776:195"/>
him; and to haue him, for my Directour. And now, that Cauallier conducting him to me, to the end, that we might ſpeake togeather, and I, remaining with extreame confuſion, to ſee my ſelf in the preſence of ſo holie a man, gaue him ſome knowledge of my Soule, and of the Prayer, which I vſed; for he excuſed himſelf, from taking my Confeſſion, as telling me, that he was very full of buſineſſe; and ſo indeed, he was. As for him, he determined with a holie kind of reſolu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, to conduct me, as a perſon, who was con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firmed, and ſtrong (for indeed I was to haue been ſo, in all reaſon, according to the Prayer, which he ſaw, I held) that ſo I might no more offend Almightie God, in the leaſt degree. But when I ſo quickly found his reſolution, concerning thoſe little things, from which, as I ſayd, I had not the courage to depart inſtantly, with ſo great perfec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, I was much afflicted; and when I alſo found, that he meant, to carrie the buſines of my Soule, after ſuch manner, as if he would make an end, as it were, all at once, by diſpoſing, and ſetling thereof, I ſaw, that I had need of much more conſideration, and care, to be vſed towards me, then that. In a word, I was of opinion, that the meanes, which he preſcribed, were not they, whereby my remedie was to be procured; for they were proper for a Soule, which had been more perfect, then mine. But as for me, though I had proceeded very farre (in as much, as might concerne the Fauours of Almightie God, to my
<pb n="317" facs="tcp:100776:195"/>
Soule) yet for as much, as concerned Vertue, and Mortification, I was but in the verie beginnings thereof. And certainly, I conceiue, that if I had not been to treat with anie other then him, my Soule would neuer haue improued, and thriued. For, through the affliction, which it gaue me, to ſee, how I did not, yea and how (as I thought) I could not, doe that, which he preſcribed, it was enough, to make me looſe my hope, and to giue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ouer the whole buſines. Sometimes I am apt to maruaile, that Almightie God was not pleaſed, to let this Scruant of his, the holie Prieſt, receiue a perfect knowledge of my Soule; nor to en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>charge himſelf, with the care thereof; ſince he is a perſon, who hath a particular facilitie, and grace, in beginning to gaine Soules to his Diuine Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ieſtie. But I ſee, that all this, hapned for my greater good, that ſo I might come to know, and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uerſe with ſo holie men, as they, <hi>of the Societie of</hi> IESVS, are.</p>
            <p>But, in the meane time, I remained in agreement with that Cauallier, of whome I ſpake, that now and then, he ſhould doe me the Fauour, to viſit me; and heer, I diſcerned his great humilitie; ſince he would be contented, to conuerſe with ſo wicked a Creature, as my ſelf. He beganne therefore then, to viſit me, and to encourage me, and to tell me, that I muſt not thinke, to deliuer my ſelf, from all my imperfections, in one day; but that, by little and little, Almightie God would doe it; and that himſelf, had remained
<pb n="318" facs="tcp:100776:196"/>
ſome whole yeares, in reforming ſome verie little light things, as not being able to finiſh the worke, ſooner. O Humilitie! how great bleſſings doſt thou beſtow vpon them, with whome thou re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maineſt? yea and euen vpon thoſe others alſo, who doe but euen approach, to the poſſeſſours there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of.</p>
            <p>This Saint (for, in my opinion, I may well giue him this name, with great reaſon) related certaine particulars to me, concerning himſelfe, which, through his humilitie, ſeemed weakneſſes, to him; but he did it, for my remedie, and redreſſe; and, conſidering his condition, and way of life, they imported neither fault, nor imperfection; but, as for me, it was a very great one, to be ſubiect to them. Nor doe I ſay thus much, by chance, though perhaps I extend my ſelf too farre, in ſpeaking of theſe verie little things; but they im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>port ſo much, for bringing a Soule, into the way of profiting in Spirit, and for getting her out, to flye, which hath ſcarce gotten yet, anie feathers, that no bodie, who hath not experience of it, will beleiue it. And I affirme theſe things heer, the rather, becauſe I hope in Almightie God, that this, which I am ſaying now, will doe much good. For, all my helpe, and hope, conſiſted in finding out the way, how to cure me; and in their exerciſing Humilitie, and Charitie, towards me; yea and to haue patience alſo, in perceiuing, that I did not inſtantly, and entirely, amend my ſelf. And this man, went with diſcretion, by little<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
               <pb n="319" facs="tcp:100776:196"/>
and little; and ſhewed me diuerſe wayes, how to ouercome the Diuel. In the meane time, I be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ganne to carrie ſo entire an affection to him, that I could not receaue a greater eaſe, and ioy, then to liue that day, when I might ſee him; though they were but few. When he delayed his Viſits, I was very much, and very quickly troubled at it; as doubting, that he forbore to ſee me, becauſe I was ſo wicked. When he came to know my ſo great imperfections (yea and euen they might reach, to be Sinnes; though yet, after I had be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gunne to treat with him, I was ſomewhat men<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded) and when I informed him alſo of the Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uours, which Almightie God had been pleaſed to doe me, to the end that he might giue me light, he told me, that all thoſe ſeuerall things, did not ſuite very well, with one another; and that thoſe Regalo's were not belonging, but to perſons, who were already very much improued, and mortifyed; That, for his part, he could not for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>beare, to be much afrayd, becauſe it ſeemed <note n="*" place="margin">This vvas no improba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble opi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion, though it vvere no true one.</note> to him, that there appeared an euill Spirit, in ſome things, though yet he would not abſolutly reſolue it; but he wiſhed that I ſhould conſider very well, of whatſoeuer I vnderſtood, concerning my Prayer, and ſo relate it to him. Now heer, the great trouble was, that I could tell him nothing at all, of what my Prayer was; for indeed, it is not long, ſince Almightie God hath done me the Fauour, of knowing, either how to vnderſtand it, or declare it.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="320" facs="tcp:100776:197"/>
But, as ſoone as he had expreſſed himſelf to mee, the affliction, which I had, was great; and the teares, which I ſhed, were manie, through the feare I had. For certainly, I deſired to ſerue, and pleaſe Almightie God, and I knew not how to perſwade my ſelf, that it was of the Diuel; only I feared, leaſt, for my great ſinnes, our Lord might blind me ſo farre, as that I could not vnder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtand it. But then, turning ouer ſome Bookes, to ſee if I could meet with anie thing, concerning my Prayer, I found in one, which is called: <hi>The Aſcent to the Mountaine,</hi> (in that particular, which concernes the Vnion of a Soule with Almightie God) all thoſe ſignes, which I had, in that ſtate, of my not being able, to thinke of anie thing; for, this was that, of which I ſpake moſt; that, Namely, I could not thinke of anie thing, in diſtinct man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner, when I had that Prayer; and I marked, and noted thoſe places, with certaine lines, wherein that paſſage was contained; and then I deliuered him the Booke, to the end, that both himſelf, and that holie Prieſt, and Seruant of God, of whome I ſpake before, might conſider it, and make me know, what I was to doe; and whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, perhaps, they might be of opinion, that I was to giue-ouer my Prayer, altogeather. For, in fine, to what purpoſe, was I to thruſt my ſelf, into thoſe dangers, if now (after I had vſed this Prayer, for almoſt twentie yeares togeather) I had made no other benefit thereof, but to be ſubiect, to the deceipts of the Diuel; and that
<pb n="321" facs="tcp:100776:197"/>
therefore, it were better for me, not to vſe this Prayer at all; though yet, it be alſo true, that this, ſhewed it ſelf, as a very ſad, and hard caſe, to me, ſince already I had found by experience, how ill it went with my Soule, without the exercise of Prayer. So that now, I could ſee nothing but mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerie, on all ſides; like one, who were caſt into a Riuer, and to which ſide ſoeuer he ſhould goe, he might ſtill haue the more danger to feare; and were ſo, come, to the verie point, as it were, of drowning.</p>
            <p>This is a very mightie affliction; and, of this kind, I haue endured manie; as I ſhall declare af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terward. For though, perhaps, it may ſeem, not to import, yet peraduenture, it may indeed proue to be of vſe, towards the vnderſtanding, of how, a Spirit, is to be tryed. For certainly, the affliction, which vſes to be endured in theſe caſes, is very great; and there is need of a nice hand, and of, a warye foot, eſpecially, when men treat with woemen; for, our weaknes is very great; and much miſcheif may chance to ariue, by telling vs, that ſuch, or ſuch a thing, is certainly the Diuel, without conſidering it, firſt, very well, and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mouing vs from thoſe dangers, which may occurr; and aduiſing vs, to keep things very priuate; and that they alſo be carefull thereof themſelues; for this is fitt. And heerin, it is I, who ſpeake, as one, who haue endured affliction enough, for not hauing had fitt perſons, with whome I might, con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferr, about my Prayer, but by asking, firſt one,
<pb n="322" facs="tcp:100776:198"/>
and then another, what might doe me good; which hath done me hurt enough. For now, di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uerſe things haue growne to be publique, which might well haue remained very priuate, ſince they are not, for euerie bodie's vnderſtanding; and beſides, it may haue ſeemed, as if they had been diuulged by me. I well beleiue, that thoſe others did it, without anie fault in them, but that our Lord was pleaſed, to permit it, to the end, that I might ſuffer by it. I am farre from ſaying, yea or ſo much as thinking, as if anie of them, related anie ſuch particular, as had paſſed from me to them, in Confeſſion; for there was no ſuch matter; but yet, in regard it came from me, to ſuch perſons, as to whome, in the way of conference, I gaue account of my feares, to the end, that they might aſſiſt me, with giuing me light, me thinkes, they might haue kept my counſaile. But how ſoeuer, I durſt neuer conceale anie thing, from ſuch perſons, in ſuch occaſions, as thoſe. I ſay therefore, that ſuch as I was then, muſt be counſailed, with much diſcre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion; and animated; and time muſt be expected; for our Bleſſed Lord will helpe them, as he did me; which if he had not done, the preiudice, which I ſhould haue ſuffered, would haue been extreame, by reaſon of my being ſo full of apprehenſions, and feares; and eſpecially, conſidering to how great palpitations of hart, I was ſubiect, I wonder, how this other accident, did me not more hurt.</p>
            <p>When therefore I had deliuered this Booke, and made a relation of my Life, and of my Sinnes,
<pb n="323" facs="tcp:100776:198"/>
the beſt I could, (though yet in groſſe; for I did it not, in the way of Confeſſion, in regard he was a Secular perſon; though yet ſtill, I made him vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtand, how wicked I was) thoſe two Seruants of Almightie God, conſidered with great charitie, and loue, what might be conuenient for me, to doe. Now, the Anſwer being readie, which I ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pected with feare enough; and I hauing recom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mended my ſelf, at that time, to manie perſons, that they might recommend me ouer, to Al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mightie God; and my ſelf alſo hauing been much in Prayer, with affliction enough of hart, to my ſelf, the Cauallier came to me at length, and told me, that, in the opinion, both of himſelf, and of the other, it was the Diuel; and that the thing, which would be fitt for me to doe, was, to treat about this buſines, with a certaine Father <hi>of the Societie of</hi> IESVS; who, if I would call him to me, &amp; declare, that I was in neceſſitie of his helpe, would not faile to come; and that I ſhould giue him an account of my whole life, by way of making a Generall Confeſſion, as alſo otherwiſe, of my con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dition; and that I muſt proceed, in all things, with much clearnes; and that then, in vertue of the Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crament of Confeſſion, Almightie God would giue him more light, where with to direct me; and that they were men of great experience, in matter of Spirit; but that I ſhould doe well, to be very carefull, not to ſwarue a whitt, from what he ſayd; for that I would find my ſelf, in much danger, if I wanted one, to gouerne, and direct my Soule.
<pb n="324" facs="tcp:100776:199"/>
As for mee, he put me now into ſo great feare, and paine, that I knew not, what to doe with my ſelf; and now, there was nothing with me, but weep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing. And being one day, very much afflicted in an Oratorie, I fell vpon reading a certaine Booke, which it ſeemes, our Lord brought to my hands; and S. Paul is cited there, ſaying, That <hi>God is very faithfull;</hi> and that <hi>he neuer ſuffers them, vvho loue him, to be tempted, aboue their ſtrength.</hi> This comforted me very much; and I beganne to conſider, about making my Generall Confeſſion; and to <note n="*" place="margin">So good a begin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, vvas almoſt, a kind of perfect<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the vvorke.</note> put in writing, all the Sinnes, and Bleſſings, with the courſe, and proceeding of my whole life, the moſt clearly, that I vnderſtood, and knew, how to doe; without leauing anie little thing out. And I re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>member, that, when I read ouer, what I had written, and ſaw ſo manie Sinnes to haue been committed by me; and, in effect, no good at all, to haue been done; it gaue me an extreame afflic<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, and ſorrow of hart. It alſo put me to ſome trouble, that they of the Houſe, ſhould ſee me treat, and conuerſe with ſo holie people, as they, <hi>of the Societie of</hi> IESVS, are; for I was afraid of mine owne wickednes; and me thought, I ſhould be obliged, by that meanes, to be wicked, no more; and to giue-ouer my entertainments, and paſſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times; and that, if I did not this, it would be worſe with me; So that I procured, both with the Por<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>treſſe, and with the Sacriſtin, that they ſhould not ſpeake thereof. But this ſerued my turne, to little purpoſe; for there chanced to be one at the Gate,
<pb n="325" facs="tcp:100776:199"/>
when I was called, who publiſhed it, ouer all the Conuent.</p>
            <p>But now, what difficulties, and troubles, and feares, doth the Diuel vſe to prouide, for ſuch per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons, as diſpoſe themſelues, to approach to Al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mightie God? When I was treating with that Seruant of his Diuine Maieſtie (who was greatly ſo, and a man alſo of very good diſcretion) about the paſſages of my whole life, and of my Soule, he declared to me, what euerie thing was; as a man, who vnderſtood that language, very well; and he encouraged me much, and told me, that it was euidently, the Spirit of Almightie God, which wrought in me; <note n="*" place="margin">The Saynt begann heer, to be happy.</note> But that I muſt returne againe, to the exerciſe of Prayer, becauſe I was not well grounded therein, nor had ſo much as be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gunne to know, what Mortification meant, (and this, was very true; for I had hardly euer well vnderſtood, ſo much as the name) but that I ſhould, by no meanes, giue-ouer my Prayer, but rather employ my ſelf, with more diligence, and endeauour, therein; ſince Almightie God, had been pleaſed, to doe me ſo particular Fauours; and what (ſayd he) could anie bodie tell, whether it might not pleaſe our Lord, to doe good to manie, euen by your meanes? Other things alſo he ſayd, in ſuch ſort, as that he might ſeem, euen to haue prophecyed then, concerning thoſe things, which our Lord was pleaſed to grant, and effect, after<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward. And I ſhould be ſubiect, to very great blame, if I correſponded not with thoſe Fauours,
<pb n="326" facs="tcp:100776:200"/>
which our Lord vouchſafed to ſhew me. In all things, it ſeemed to me, that the Holie Ghoſt ſpake to me, by this Father, in order to the Cure of my Soule; ſo diſtinctly grew euerie thing, to be im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>princed therein. He put me to great confuſion; and directed me, by ſuch meanes, to proceed, that he ſeemed to make me abſolutly, euen another Creature: So great a thing it is, to vnderſtand a Soule. He willed me, euerie day, to meditate vpon ſome paſſage of the Paſſion of our Bleſſed Lord; and that I ſhould helpe my ſelf thereby; and that I ſhould not thinke, but vpon his Holie Huma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nitie; and that I ſhould reſiſt thoſe recollections, and guſts, as much as I could; and not giue place to them, till he ſhould expreſse himſelfe to me, by ſome other order.</p>
            <p>He left me, both comforted, and ſtrengthned; and our Lord aſſiſted both me, and him, to the end, that he might vnderſtand my condition, and in what ſort, I was to gouerne my ſelf; and I, re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mained with a reſolution, not to ſwarue at all, from anie thing, which he had, or ſhould co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>mand me; and therein, haue I continued, till this verie day. Our Lord be bleſſed, and praiſed, for hauing giuen me grace, to obey my Ghoſtlie Fathers, though yet, after an imperfect manner; and they, haue, in effect, euer been, theſe bleſſed men, <hi>of the Societie of</hi> IESVS; howſoeuer (as I was ſaying) I haue followed them, after an imperfect manner. But now, my Soule beganne to receiue an eui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent
<pb n="327" facs="tcp:100776:200"/>
kind of amendment, and improuement; as I will heer declare.</p>

            </argument>
            <p>BVt now my Soule remained ſo ſupple, and tractable, by meanes of this laſt Confeſſion of mine, that I thought, there could be nothing, to which I would not diſpoſe my ſelf; and ſo I inſtantly beganne to change, in manie things, though yet my Ghoſtlie Father did not <note n="*" place="margin">This vvas a vviſe man, &amp; likely to vvorke vvon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders vpon a Soule.</note> preſſe me much, but rather ſeemed to make little ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count of them. And this, wrought euen ſo much the more vpon me; for he carried me rather on, by way of giuing me certaine libertie, in little things; then of preſſure; vnloſſe my ſelfe could find in my hart, to doe it for Loue. In the meane time, I continued, vpon the point of two moneths, vſing all the diligence, that poſſibly I could, to reſiſt the Fauours, and Regalo's of Almightie God. As for my exteriour conuerſation, and
<pb n="328" facs="tcp:100776:201"/>
proceeding, there was already an apparant change to be ſeen, in me; for already, our Bleſſed Lord, beganne, to giue me courage, to doe cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taine things, which the perſons, who ſaw, and knew me, held to be extreame; and euen, in the verie Houſe it ſelf, and in reſpect of what I was wont to doe before, they might, indeed, be ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>counted, to hang that way; though yet ſtill, it all, fell ſhort enough of that, to which I was obliged, both by the Habit, which I had taken, and by the Profeſſion alſo, which I had made. From that reſiſtance, which I made, to the guſts, and Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>galo's of Almightie God, I gained thus much, that his Diuine Maieſtie came to be pleaſed, to be my Inſtructour himſelf. For before, it ſeemed, that, for the diſpoſing me, towards the receiuing of anie ſuch Regalo's, as thoſe, there was need, that I ſhould retire, and ſhut my ſelf, as it were, vp, into corners; and I alſo durſt not, as it were, moue, or ſtirre. But afterward, I quickly found, how little, all that, ſerued to the purpoſe; for, when I procured to diuert my ſelf moſt, ſo much the more did our Bleſſed Lord couer me, as it were, all ouer, with that kind of Suauitie, and glorie, as ſeemed, euen to compaſſe me in, on euerie ſide; in ſuch ſort, as that it was not poſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble for me, to ſcape from it. And really, ſo it was; for, as for me, I tooke ſo much care to decline it, that it did euen put me to paine; and yet our Lord was pleaſed, euen ſtill, to haue more care, to be doing me Fauours; and to expreſſe himſelf,
<pb n="289" facs="tcp:100776:201"/>
that way, (in thoſe two moneths I ſay) much more, then he had formerly done; to the end, that I might, the better, know, that this buſines did now, no longer, depend, anie way, vpon my ſelf.</p>
            <p>And now, I beganne to grow to carry a new, and freſh kind of loue, towards the moſt Sacred Humanitie of our Bleſſed Lord; and my Prayer beganne to ſettle it ſelf, like a Building, which now had morter in it, that might make the parts ſtick togeather; and I beganne alſo, to incline my ſelf more, to the doing of Pennance, wherein I was growne a little ſlack, by reaſon of my ſo great infirmities. For, that holie man, to whome I made my Confeſſion, told me, that ſome kindes of Pennance, which he named, would doe me no hurt; and that, perhaps, Almightie God gaue me ſicknes, in the qualitie of Pennance, ſince I would impoſe none, vpon my ſelf. He willed me alſo, to doe certaine acts of Mortifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cation, which were not very pleaſing to me; though yet, I went-through with them all; be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe it ſeemed to me, as if our Lord himſelf had commanded them; and his Diuine Maieſtie, gaue him alſo grace, to direct them, in ſuch ſort, as that I ſhould be glad to obey him. My Soule went then greatly feeling euerie offence, which I might committ againſt Almightie God, how light, or ſmall ſoeuer, the ſame might be; in ſuch ſort, and to ſo high a proportion, as that, if I did but weare anie one little ſuperfluous thing about
<pb n="330" facs="tcp:100776:202"/>
me, I was not able to recollect my ſelf, till I had put it off. I made much Prayer to our Bleſſed Lord, that he would be pleaſed to protect me ſtill; and that, ſince I conuerſed, and treated the buſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nes of my Soule, with his Seruants, he would neuer permitt, that I ſhould returne back againe; for I conceiued, that that, would be a ſtrange of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fence in me; yea and that euen they, would grow to looſe credit by it, vpon my occaſion.</p>
            <p>At this time, came to this place, Father <hi>Francis Borgia,</hi> who had been Duke of <hi>Gandia,</hi> and who already, ſome yeares before, had left all, and had entred into <hi>The Societie of</hi> IESVS. And now, my Ghoſtlie Father, as alſo the Cauallier, of whome I ſpoke before, came to me, with deſire, that I would ſpeake with Father <hi>Borgia;</hi> and that I would alſo giue him account, of the Prayer I held; for they knew, that the ſaid Father <hi>Borgia,</hi> was a perſon, <note n="*" place="margin">He loſt nothing, by leaue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to be a Duke, for Gods ſake.</note> farre aduanced, in being much fauour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, and regaled, by Almightie God; and that, as one, who had left very much, in this world, for the loue of our Lord, he was reſolued to pay him for it, euen here. When Father <hi>Borgia</hi> had heard me, he told me, that it was the Spirit of Almightie God; and that he was of opinion, that now, it was fitt, no longer to reſiſt his Fauours; though yet, till then, he thought it to haue been well done. But that I ſhould alwaies beginne my Prayer, with the conſideration of ſome paſſage of the Paſſion; and if afterward, our Bleſſed Lord would eleuate the Spirit, I ſhould not reſiſt it, but
<pb n="331" facs="tcp:100776:202"/>
ſuffer his Diuine Maieſtie to carrie it away; pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uided alwaies, that my ſelf ſhould not haue anie hand, in procuring it. But he, in fine, as being a man, who had trauailed farre already, in that way, did giue me, both counſaile, and phiſick. For, ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perience is a great matter, in theſe affaires; and he ſayd, it was an errour, to reſiſt the Fauours of Almightie God, now, anie longer. My ſelf was greatly comforted by this; and ſo alſo was the Cauallier; and he reioyced much to heare Father <hi>Borgia</hi> ſay, that it was of Almightie God; and he alſo aduiſed, and aſſiſted me, in what he could; which was very much.</p>
            <p>About this time, they changed my Ghoſtlie Father, from that place, to another, which I re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſented extreamly; for I thought, I was to turne wicked, againe; as alſo, I conceiued, that it would not be poſſible, that euer I ſhould finde another, like him. My Soule was full of diſcomforts, and feares, euen as if it had been planted in a kind of Deſert; nor did I know, in fine, what to doe with my ſelf. A certaine Kinſwoeman of mine, procured then; to carrie me along with her, to her Houſe; and I procured alſo to goe, the rather, that ſo, I might get another Confeſſarius, <hi>of the So<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cietie of</hi> IESVS. Our Lord was alſo pleaſed then, that I ſhould make freindſhip with a certaine La<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>die, a Widdow, who was both of much qualitie, and of great Prayer, and ſhe conuerſed very much, with the Fathers of the ſayd <hi>Societie;</hi> and ſhe drew me alſo to Confeſſe, to her Confeſſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rius.
<pb n="332" facs="tcp:100776:203"/>
I remained a good while, in her houſe; for ſhe liued neer me; and I was glad, to treat much with thoſe Fathers; for euen by the only vnder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtanding, which I came to haue, of the ſanctitie of their conuerſation, and way of proceeding, the profit, which my Soule found, and felt, was great. This Father, beganne to addreſſe me, and engage me vpon wayes of more Perfection. He told me, that, for the giuing Almightie God entire contentment, and guſt, there was nothing to be leſt vndone; But this <note n="*" place="margin">This muſt needs haue been, a holy, and a vviſe man.</note> he ſayd, with a great deale of prudence, and ſweetnes; for my Soule was not yet, anie thing ſtrong, but green, and tender; eſpecially in the point of giuing-ouer certaine freindſhips, which I maintained at that time; for though I offended not Almightie God thereby, yet the affection, which I bore them, was very great; and I held it, to be a kind of in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gratitude, to giue them ouer. And ſo I alſo told him, that ſince Almightie God was not offended by it, what reaſon could there be, why I ſhould become vngratefull? He ſayd, I ſhould doe well, to recommended it, to Almightie God, for ſome dayes, and to recite the Hymne of <hi>Veni Creator Spiritus,</hi> &amp;c, that ſo the Holie-Ghoſt might giue me light, to doe that, which was beſt. Hauing therefore been, one day, much in Prayer, and humbly beſeeching our Bleſſed Lord, that he would aſſiſt me, to pleaſe him, in all things, I be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ganne the Hymne; and whilſt I was ſaying it, there came a Rapt vpon me, ſo inſta<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>tly, and ſo ſuddain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly,
<pb n="333" facs="tcp:100776:203"/>
that it tooke me, as it were, out of my ſelf; and of this, I could not doubt; for it was very euident; and it was alſo, the verie firſt time, that our Lord ſhewed me the Fauour of Rapts; and then I heard theſe <note n="*" place="margin">A little of this, goes farr.</note> words from him: I <hi>vvill not haue thee novv, hold conuerſation vvith men, but vvith Angells.</hi> This gaue me a great amazement; for, the commotion of the Soule was great; and thoſe words were ſpoken to me, in the verie interiour part of the Spirit; ſo that they made me afrayd; though yet, on the other ſide, they gaue me alſo great conſolation, which, vpon the verie flight of that feare, (which had, in my opinion, cauſed that ſtrange noueltie,) did ſtill remaine with me. The truth is, that this Speech of our Lord, hath been very well accompliſhed, and performed; for, neuer haue I been euen able, anie more, to eſtabliſh anie friendſhip at all, nor to feele anie conſolation, nor entertaine anie particular loue towards anie other perſon, then ſuch, as I vnder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtand, and know, to loue Almightie God, and to procure to ſerue him. Nor is it now, anie longer, in my hand, or power, nor ſerues it a whitt, to the purpoſe, whether any of them be kindred, or friends, or no; for, if I vnderſtand not, that he is the Seruant of Almightie God, or a perſon addicted to Prayer, it is no leſſe, then a heauie croſſe for me, to conuerſe much, with anie Creature. And this is certainly true, to the vttermoſt of what I can iudge of my ſelf.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="334" facs="tcp:100776:204"/>
From that day forward, I haue remained full of courage, and reſolution, to leaue the whole world, for Almightie God; in regard he had been pleaſed, in that verie moment (for it ſeemed no more to me, then a verie moment) to make this Seruant of his, become wholy, another Creature, then what ſhe had been. So that now, there was no longer need, that they ſhould command me, in that particular, anie more; for, when my Ghoſtlie Father, had found me, to be ſo fixed vpon this point, he had not yet aduentured to will me expreſly, to doe it. For he did, without all doubt, expect, that our Lord ſhould be pleaſed, to doe it himſelf, as, indeed, he did; nor yet could I euer imagine, that it would proue to take effect with me, as yet it fell out to doe; becauſe already, I had vſed ſome endeauours that way; and the affliction, which I receiued by it, was ſo great, that I reſolued to giue ouer the attempt, as being a thing, which I held not to be inconuenient, to continue. But now heer, our Bleſſed Lord, im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parted both libertie, and ſtrength to me, to put it in execution. I told this verie thing, to my Ghoſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lie Father; and I gaue ouer that freindſhip, ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to what I had been commanded. And it did them no little good, with whome I had been wont to conuerſe, to ſee this reſolution growne in me. Almightie God be euer bleſſed, and praiſed, who gaue me that libertie, and power, in one <note n="*" place="margin">So true it is, that God is God.</note> moment, which I had not been able to purchaſe, and obtaine of my ſelf, by the multitude of thoſe
<pb n="335" facs="tcp:100776:204"/>
great diligences, which I had vſed, manie yeares, in order to this end; though yet, I had employed my ſelf, ſo earneſtly, vpon this attempt, that it had coſt me, a good part of my health. But now, this hauing been wrought, and granted by him, who is the Omnipotent, and true Lord of all Creatures, it put me not, euen to the leaſt paine, or trouble, at all.</p>

               <p>She treats heer, of the vvay, and manner, of vnderſtanding thoſe vvords, or ſpeeches, vvhich Almightie God is pleaſed to vtter to the Soule, though yet vvithout hearing anie voice, or ſound; and of ſome errours, or abuſes, vvhich may happen heerin; and, hovv the right, may be knovvne, from the vvrong. It is of much vſe, and profit, for ſuch, as ſee themſelues in this Degree of Prayer; for it is declared very vvell; and the Doctrine containes great inſtruc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion.</p>
            </argument>
            <p>ME thinkes, it ſhould doe well, to declare, what kind of thing, this Speech is, which our Lord expreſſes to the Soule; and what ſhe alſo feeles; to the end, that your Reuerence may vnderſtand it; for, from this verie time, when
<pb n="336" facs="tcp:100776:205"/>
our Lord did me this Fauour, (as I haue ſayd) the ſame thing is very vſuall with me, euen till this verie preſent; as I ſhall let you ſee, by that which followes. I ſay therefore, that they are certaine Words, very diſtinctly formed; and that, howſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>euer they be not heard, with our eares, of fleſh and bloud, yet are they vnderſtood, much more expreſly, and clearly, then if they were ſo heard. And to ſeeke to forbeare to vnderſtand them, yea and to reſiſt the vnderſtanding them, (how much ſoeuer it may be) is a vanitie, and a moſt impoſſible thing. When, in this world, we haue a minde, not to heare, we may ſtopp our eares, or els attend to other things, if we will; in ſuch ſort, as that, although, peraduenture, we may heare the words, yet we ſhall not, in that caſe, vnderſtand them. But <note n="*" place="margin">The mighty force, and povver of any one Su<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perna<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turall vvord.</note> now, in this diſcourſe, which Almightie God makes to the Soule, there is no remedie at all, but they make me harken to them, whether I will, or no; &amp; they oblige the Vnderſta<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ding, to be very entire, &amp; attentiue, for the co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>prehending thereof. For he, who is able to doe all things, is reſolued, that we ſhall vnderſtand him; and that, which he reſolues, muſt be done; and ſo he comes to be knowne, to be the true Lord of vs all. I haue very well experimented this truth; for, the reſiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance, which I made him, did laſt, vpon the point of two yeares, through the great feare, wherein I was; yea and euen now, I make thoſe tryalls ſometimes, but it ſerues me to little purpoſe. I would faine declare the errours; and abuſes,
<pb n="337" facs="tcp:100776:205"/>
which may heer occurr; though, for a man, who hath much experience, me thinkes, there ſhould be few, or none. But indeed, the ſayd experience, would be great; as namely, to know the differ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence, when the Spirit is good; and when it is ill; and when perhaps, the thing may alſo be, but an apprehenſion of the verie Vnderſtanding it ſelf, which may occurr; or when the verie Spirit it ſelf, may ſpeake, to the verie ſelf-ſame Spirit; and I know not very well, whether this may happen, or no; though euen this verie day, I had a kind of opinion, that it might.</p>
            <p>When theſe Words are indeed, of Almightie God, I haue found the truth thereof, in manie things, which were told me, two or three yeares before; and they all fell out, to proue true; and till now, not anie one of them, failed. There are alſo other things, whereby it growes to proue, very plaine, that the Spirit is of God; as I will declare afterward.</p>
            <p>To <note n="*" place="margin">The infinit differe<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ce, betvvee<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> Super<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>naturall vvords of God, &amp; all other.</note> me it ſeemes, that a perſon, recommending a thing to Almightie God, with great earneſtnes, and apprehenſion, may grow to make himſelf conceiue, that he comes to vnderſtand, in ſome ſort, whether the thing ſhall be done, or no; and this, I ſay, is very poſſible; but he, who vnderſtands things, after this other manner, will clearly diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>couer, what it may be; ſo great a difference there is, between the two. And if indeed, it be a thing, which the Vnderſtanding deuiſes, and makes, (how ſubtily, and how delicately ſoeuer, the
<pb n="338" facs="tcp:100776:206"/>
matter goe) he vnderſtands, that there is ſome part of himſelf, in that, which is ordained, and ſayd. For, it is no other thing, then for a man to ſet a Diſcourſe on foot; or to harken, to what another man ſayes; for then, the Vnderſtanding findes, that it doth not harken then, becauſe it workes; and the words, which it goes framing, in that caſe, are, as it were, fantaſticall, and mute, and confuſed; and are not deliuered with that clearnes, which thoſe others haue. And now heer, it is in our owne power, to diuert our ſelues, or els to hold our peace, when we ſpeake; but in this other caſe, we haue no ſuch power at all.</p>
            <p>Another ſigne there is, which is of more im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portance, then all the reſt; for, theſe things, which are ſayd by our ſelues, haue no manner of opera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, and worke no effect, at all; But the other, when our Lord is pleaſed to ſpeake, is not only of words, but workes; and though they be not words of deuotion, but of reprehenſion, they in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtantly diſpoſe the Soule, and they enable her, and make her relent; and they giue light, and regale her, and appeaſe her. And, if ſhe were in ſtate of drynes, and commotion, and diſorder, theſe Words take all away, as if it were, with the hand; yea and yet, much better, then ſo; for it ſeemes, that our Lord's buſines is then, to ſhew his mightie power; and that his Words, are deeds. Me thinkes, there is ſuch a difference, as there is between our ſpeaking, or hearing; neither more, <gap reason="illegible: faint" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>orleſſe. For that which I ſpeake, I goe ordering
<pb n="339" facs="tcp:100776:206"/>
(as I was ſaying) with my Vnderſtanding; but if another ſpeake to me, I doe no more then heare, without anie trouble at all, to my ſelf. One of theſe kindes of <hi>VVords,</hi> is like ſome thing, whereof we cannot well determine, whether it be not, as of a man, who is half aſleepe. But this other, is found to come from a voice, ſo diſtinct, and cleare, that not one ſingle ſyllable, of all that, which is ſayd, can be loſt. And yet, theſe things happen ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times, when the Vnderſtanding, and, indeed, the whole Soule, is in ſo great diſtraction, &amp; diſorder, that it would neuer be able, to hitt right, in the framing of one little peice of good diſcourſe; but ſhe findes in this other way, certaine great, and weightie ſentences, which are imparted to her, ſo ſtrangely well ordered, and dreſſed, that, though ſhe were neuer ſo deeply recollected, ſhe were not able to reach them; and yet at the verie firſt word thereof (as I was ſaying) they beginne to make a totall mutation of her Soule. And eſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cially, if ſhe be brought into Rapt, when the Powers of the Soule, are ſuſpended, how ſhall thoſe things, euer come to be vnderſtood by her, after a naturall way, which were neuer expoſed before to her Memorie; as they come to be then, when it workes not, in effect, at all; and when her Imagination is now, vpon the matter, as it were, all turned foole.</p>
            <p>But heer it is to be vnderſtood, that whenſoeuer either Viſions are ſeen, or anie of theſe Superna<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turall Words, or Speeches, be heard, it is neuer, in
<pb n="340" facs="tcp:100776:207"/>
my opinion, at ſuch times, as when the Soule is wholy vnited, in the Rapt it ſelf; for, at thoſe times (as, I thinke, I declared already, in my Diſcourſe of the Second Water) all the Powers of the Minde, are entirely loſt; and ſo we cannot (at ſuch times, as thoſe) either ſee, or heare, or vnderſtand. For, the Soule is wholy in the power of another, at that time, which yet vſes to laſt very little; and, me thinkes, our Lord leaues her not in libertie, to doe anie thing at all. But when that ſhort time is paſt, the Soule remaining ſtill in the Rapt, this happens, whereof now I ſpeake; becauſe the Powers re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maine in ſuch ſort, at that time. And though they be not loſt, yet, in effect, they operate, and act nothing at all; but are, as if they were abſorpt, and no way able to diſcourſe, by the aſſembling, and compoſing of reaſons. But there are ſo manie wayes to vnderſtand the differe<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>nce, which occurrs heer, between the true, and the falſe, that if the Soule ſhould chance to be deceaued ſome once, ſhe would not be ſo, very often. Nay I ſay further, that if the Soule haue had anie experience, and be carefull to obſerue, what paſſes, ſhe will euidently diſcerne this truth. For, beſides all other meanes, whereby that, will appeare, which I haue ſayd, theſe ſtrained words will worke no effect, at all; neither will the Soule, euer admit them; as yet, ſhe muſt, theſe other true ones, whether ſhe will, or no. Nor giues ſhe anie credit to the thing, at all; but rather findes, and knowes, that it is but a kind of idle imagination; iuſt ſo, in effect, as we would
<pb n="341" facs="tcp:100776:207"/>
not make account of anie thing, which were ſayd to vs, by a frantick perſon.</p>
            <p>But this other, is, as if we heard ſome perſon ſpeake, who were very holie, and learned, and of great authoritie; and ſuch an one, as we are ſure, would not lye. Yea and this, is but a meane, and baſe Compariſon; becauſe indeed, theſe verie Words, doe bring with them, ſometimes, ſo great a Maieſtie, that euen (without ſo much as reflect<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing vpon, who it is, that ſpeakes them) if they be words of reprehenſion, they make men tremble; and if they concerne the Loue of God, they make Soules euen diſſolue, and, as it were, annihilate themſelues, in loue. And they are things, in fine, which (as I haue ſayd already) are very farre then, from our remembrance; and there vſe to be ſo high, and ſo great ſentences, ſo clearly, and ſo ſuddainly pronounced, as that there would haue been need, of a very great deale of time, for the putting them in order; and, for my part, I thinke, it is wholy impoſſible, that then, ſuch things as thoſe, ſhould be euen conceiued by vs, to haue been made, or framed, by our ſelues. So that there is no cauſe at all, why I ſhould detaine my ſelf heerin, anie longer; for it would looke, like a kind of wonder, in mine eye, if anie experienced perſon ſhould be able to be deceiued heerin, vnleſſe he would euen haue a minde, to deceiue himſelf.</p>
            <p>It hath hapned to me, very <gap reason="illegible: blotted" extent="3 letters">
                  <desc>•••</desc>
               </gap>en, not fully to beleiue that, which <hi>theſe VVords</hi> tell me, if I be in anie doubt at all thereof; but to conceiue, that it
<pb n="342" facs="tcp:100776:208"/>
was no more, then mine owne fancie. This I doe, when the occaſion is paſt; for, at the preſent, it is impoſſible; but I haue ſeen it fulfilled, long after; becauſe our Lord is pleaſed, that the ſame ſhould remaine ſtill, in the memorie; for it is not poſſible, to forget it. Now that, which is wont to proceed from our owne Vnderſtanding, is, in effect, but the firſt motion of our thoughts, which quickly paſſes away, and is forgotten; whereas this other, is a <hi>VVorke,</hi> rather then a <hi>vvord.</hi> And though ſome part of it, may be forgotten, in a long tract of time, yet the Memorie cannot looſe it, ſo farre, as not to know, that it was ſayd, vnleſſe the time may haue been very long; or els, if they be <hi>VVords of Fauour,</hi> or of <hi>Doctrine,</hi> and <hi>Inſtruction;</hi> but if they be of <hi>Propheſye,</hi> they neuer happen, in my opinion, to be forgotten; at leaſt, this neuer hapned to me, though yet, I haue a very ill memorie.</p>
            <p>And now I returne to ſay, that, me thinkes, if a Soule be not, as it were, ſo baſe, and wicked, as euen, in effect, not to be a Soule; and vnleſſe it would counterfeit, and feigne (which were miſchief, and miſerie enough) and would ſay, that ſhe vnderſtands things, when yet really, there were no ſuch matter, it is impoſſible but that ſhe ſhould ſee clearly, that it is ſhe her ſelf, who com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſes, and frames thoſe Words, and ſpeakes them to her ſelf; eſpecially if ſhe haue had anie vnder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtanding at all, of the Spirit of God; for, if ſhe haue not, ſhe may very well remaine in this abuſe, or errour, all the dayes of her life; and may perhaps
<pb n="343" facs="tcp:100776:208"/>
conceiue, that ſhe vnderſtands thoſe Words, as ſpoken by ſome other; though yet, for my part, I confeſſe, that I cannot ariue to know, how this ſhould be done; for, either this Soule will vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtand them, or not. If ſhe be diſmiſſing her ſelf of that, which ſhe vnderſtands, and would faine vnderſtand no part of it, (for a thouſand feares, beſides manie other reaſons, which ſhe may haue, to continue quiet, in her Prayer, without ſuch ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cidents, as theſe) how comes ſhe to allow ſo much time to the Vnderſtanding, as may ſerue for the compoſing of theſe reaſons? For, in fine, there muſt be time, for that. But now, in this other way, we remaine inſtructed, without anie loſſe of time, at all; yea, and we grow to vnderſtand certaine things, at an inſtant; when yet otherwiſe, a moneth would haue been time, little enough, to ordaine them. Yea and the Vnderſtanding remaines no leſſe then amazed, at ſome things, which we vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtand. This is the verie truth; and whoſoeuer hath anie experience, will find, that euerie word of this, which I haue ſayd, is litterally certaine; and I bleſſe Almightie God, for enabling me to declare it, as I haue done. And now I end this part of the Diſcourſe, with ſaying, that me thinkes, when ſuch Words proceed from our owne Vnder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtanding, we may eaſily come to know it, if we haue a minde to it; and euerie time, that we are in Prayer, we ſhall conceiue, that we vnderſtand them. But in this other kind of Words, or Speeches, it is not ſo; for it will be manie dayes
<pb n="344" facs="tcp:100776:209"/>
wherein, though I ſhould deſire to vnderſtand ſomewhat of that kind, it would be abſolutly im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſſible; and when, at other times, I haue no thought that way, I muſt yet vnderſtand it; as I haue ſayd. And me thinkes, that whoſoeuer had a minde to deceiue others, affirming himſelf to vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtand that, from Almightie God, which is from himſelf, might as well (and it would coſt him as little) affirme, that he heard it, with his eares. And it is a moſt certaine, and reall truth, that, for my part, I neuer thought, that there was anie other way, then that, for the hearing, and vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtanding anie thing, till I found, in mine owne caſe, that this, which I haue now deliuered, is true; and it hath coſt me, as I ſayd, much trouble.</p>
            <p>When theſe things proceed of the Diuel, they doe not only, not worke anie good effects, but leaue alſo very ill ones, behind them. But this, hath not hapned to me, aboue twice, or thrice; and I haue inſtantly been aduertiſed, by our Lord, that they were of the Diuel. And, beſides the great drynes, which they leaue behind them, they alſo giue the Soule much diſquiet, after the manner of thoſe manie other times, when our Lord hath per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitted me, to haue great temptations, and troubles of Soule, in different kindes; and that I ſhould often be tormented, as I will declare heerafter. But this is a certaine kind of diſquiet, of which we know not, how to vnderſtand, from whence it comes; but it ſeemes, that the Soule reſiſts it, and is put into great diſorder by it; and is afflicted,
<pb n="345" facs="tcp:100776:209"/>
without knowing for what; in regard that the Diuel ſaith, that ſuch, or ſuch a thing, is not ill, but good. I conceiue, that if one Spirit may be able to find, and feele another, the guſt, and delight, which this Diabolicall Spirit giues, is different, in my opinion, from the other, after a moſt euident manner. The Diuel may well deceiue ſome ſuch perſon, by giuing him guſts, as neuer receiued anie before, from Almightie God; for, theſe latter, are guſts indeed, which import a ſweet, ſtrong, well-imprinted, quiet, delightfull kind of pleaſure, and ioy; for, as for thoſe little prettie deuotions of the Soule, and certaine other ſlight feelings, which be like little young flowers, that are ſhaken off, and loſt, vpon the leaſt little wind of perſecution, I doe not call them Deuotions; though yet they are good beginnings, and holie motions, but no way ſufficient to determine, whether the effects proceed from a good Spirit, or a bad; and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore it will be very neceſſarie, to walke, in this kind of things, with huge caution; for, ſuch perſons, as ſhall not haue proceeded further, in Prayer, then thus farre, may eaſily grow to be deceiued, if they fall out to haue Viſions, or Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uelations. For my part, I neuer had of theſe laſt, till God, through his owne onlie goodnes, gaue me Prayer of Vnion; vnleſſe it were that firſt time, whereof I ſpoke; and it hapned to me, manie yeares agoe, when I ſaw Chriſt our Lord; and I would to God, it had pleaſed his Diuine Maieſtie, that I had vnderſtood, at that time, that it was a
<pb n="346" facs="tcp:100776:210"/>
true Viſion, as I vnderſtood it, to be, afterward; for, it would not haue been, of ſmall aduantage to me.</p>
            <p>But now, vpon theſe illuſions of the Diuel, there neuer growes any ſweetnes, or ſoftnes, and ſupplenes, to the Soule; but ſhe remaines, as if ſhe were frighted, and with much diſguſt. And I hold it for very certaine, that Almightie God will neuer permit the Diuel to deceiue anie Soule, which puts no confidence at all, in her ſelf, and which is fortifyed in the right Faith, and reſolues thus much, for her part, that she would dye a thouſand deaths, for the leaſt Article thereof; and who, togeather with this Loue, and Faith, being infuſed into the Soule, by Almightie God (which is a Liuelie, and ſtrong Faith indeed) procures alwayes to goe, in conformitie with that, which is taught by the Holie Catholique Church; informing her ſelfe further, by ſeuerall wayes, as a perſon, who is ſtrongly ſeated in this truth, That all the imagi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nable Reuelations of the whole world, no not, if ſhe ſhould ſee the verie Heauens open them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelues, could make her varie in the leaſt point, from the Doctrines, and Decrees of the ſayd Church. But if ſhe once come ſo farre, as but to ſhake, or wauer, euen in one ſingle thought, againſt this; or entertaine her ſelf ſo farre, as to ſay: <hi>But novv, if God himſelf ſay thus to me, as he hath ſayd ſuch other things, to Saints; this may alſo be true;</hi> I ſay not, that she beleiue it, but that the Diuel be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginne to tempt her, by this motion; and that she be content, to continue her ſelf a little therein; a
<pb n="347" facs="tcp:100776:210"/>
bodie may ſee already, that this is ſtarke naught. But for my part, I beleiue, that manie times, euen theſe other firſt motions, will hardly euer come ſo farre, as euen but to ſet vpon ſuch a Soule; if ſhe be already ſo ſtrong, as our Bleſſed Lord is wont to haue made ſuch, as to whome he vſes to impart theſe Fauours. For, me thinkes, ſhe might be able to teare thoſe Diuels, euen to fitters, whenſoeuer there might be queſtion of anie one ſingle little Truth, which the Church holds. I ſay, that, if the Soule doe not find ſuch a ſtrength, as this, in her ſelf; and that the deuotion, or Viſion, which ſhe had, doe not aſſiſt, and help her-on therein, let her not hold anie ſuch Viſion for ſafe; becauſe, though the hurt of it, be not inſtantly vnderſtood, it may perhaps grow, by little, and little, to be great. For, (to the vttermoſt of what I can diſcerne, and know by experience) the reputation, and credit, that ſuch a thing is of the Spirit of God, is ſetled, and aſſured, in ſuch ſort, as that it alſo goes, in conformitie to Holie Scripture. And when it should be found to varie from this Rule, though it were neuer ſo little, I thinke I should be then, much more ſure, without compariſon, that it were of the Diuel, then now I haue aſſurance, that it is of Almightie God; how great ſoeuer I might find that aſſurance to be. For, in that caſe, we should haue no need at all, to goe in ſearch after ſignes; nor to enquire, of what Spirit it were; ſince this is ſo cleare a ſigne, to make vs beleiue, that it is of the Diuel, that if all the world should endeauour
<pb n="348" facs="tcp:100776:211"/>
to aſſure me, that it were of God, I would not be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leiue it.</p>
            <p>The matter is, that, when theſe things are of the Diuel, it ſeemes, as if all kind of benediction, did hide it ſelf, and euen flye from the Soule; ſo vntoward, and vnquiet, and in ſo great diſorder, doth ſhe remaine, without anie one good effect, at all. For, though there may be a ſeeming, as if there were a planting of good deſires, in her; yet they are not effectuall, or ſtrong. The humilitie, which he leaues behind him, is falſe, vnquiet, and without anie ſuauitie at all; and me thinkes, this may be eaſily enough vnderſtood, by anie Creature, who hath experience, of what a good Spirit, is. But yet, the Diuel is very able to play manie tricks; and therefore there is nothing of this kind ſo certaine, and cleare, but that ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>what may ſtill be feared, at his hands. And ſo it will euer be well done, to proceed with caution, and aduice; and to haue a Directour, who may be learned; and to conceale nothing from him; and ſo the Party ſhall be ſure to take no hurt; though yet, I haue had my part thereof, through the ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſiue feares, to which ſome of them were ſubiect.</p>
            <p>In particular, it hapned to me once, that manie perſons meeting togeather, in whome I had be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leife enough, (and there was reaſon, that I ſhould haue it; and though I proceeded heerin, after the manner of entire confidence, but with one, yet when he commanded me, I ſpoke alſo with
<pb n="349" facs="tcp:100776:211"/>
others) they treated much, about finding reme<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>die, for all my inconueniences. For, they loued me very much; and I doubted, that I might, per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>haps, be deceiued; and I was alſo ſubiect to ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>treame feares, whenſoeuer I was not in Prayer; for when I was, and when our Lord vouchſafed to doe me anie Fauour therein, I grew preſently, into good aſſurance; and I thinke, they were fiue, or ſix of them; and they were all, great Seruants of Almightie God. But then, my Ghoſtlie Father told me, that they <note n="*" place="margin">A ſtrange encoun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter.</note> all, had growne to reſolue, that it was the Diuel; and directed me, not to Communicate ſo often; and that I ſhould endea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uour, to diuert my ſelf, in ſuch ſort, as that I might not be much alone. Now, I was extreamly timorous in theſe caſes, as I haue ſayd; and the palpitation of my hart, helped me on, therein; ſo that I had not the courage, manie times, to be alone, in my roome, euen by day. But when I found, what ſo manie of them affirmed, (which yet I could by no meanes beleiue) I grew to haue an extreame ſcruple, as conceauing, that this was a ſigne, of very little humilitie, in my ſelf, ſince they all, were incomparably of better life, then I; and, beſides all this, they were learned; and, in fine, why ſhould not I beleiue them? I forced my ſelf the beſt I could, to doe it; and I thought much, of mine owne wicked life; and how, (conſidering that) it might be likely enough to be true, which they ſayd. Vpon this, I went into the Church, with this affliction; and paſſed on,
<pb n="450" facs="tcp:100776:212"/>
into an Oratorie, hauing forborne, manie dayes, to Communicate; and auoided alſo to be alone; which yet had formerly been my totall comfort; and all this, without hauing one perſon, with whome I might treat; for, they were all againſt me. Nay ſome of them, me thought, made them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelues, as it were, merrie with me, whenſoeuer I would be telling them, what I thought; and others would be aduiſing my Ghoſtlie Father, to take heed of me; nay ſome would goe ſo farre, as to ſay, that it was clearly the Diuel. Only my Ghoſtlie Father, though he conformed himſelf with thoſe others (as I grew to vnderſtand after<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward) ſo farre, as to haue me tryed, did euer giue me comfort, and told me, that, though it ſhould be the Diuel, yet I, not offending Almightie God, he would be able to doe me no hurt; That the difficultie would grow to be remoued; That, in the meane time, I ſhould pray hartily to Almightie God; and that he, and all thoſe others, and manie more alſo then they, would doe the like; and all my Prayer, and theirs, whome I conceiued to be the Seruants of Almightie God, aymed at this; That his Diuine Maieſtie would be pleaſed, to carrie me on, by ſome other way. And this kind of making continuall interceſſion to our Lord, might laſt, about a matter of ſome two yeares.</p>
            <p>As for me, I was capable of no comfort, when I thought once, that it was poſſible, for the Diuel, to be ſo often ſpeaking to me, and in me; but in regard, that now, I employed no more howers
<pb n="451" facs="tcp:100776:212"/>
of my time, in Solitude, for Prayer, our Lord gaue me Recollection, euen when I was in conuer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſation; and ſo, as that I was not able to auoyd it; and he ſayd ſuch things to me, as he pleaſed; and I, in the meane time, was troubled, that I was faine to heare him. But once, being all alone, without hauing anie Creature by me, vpon whome to eaſe my ſelf, I could neither pray, nor reade; but was like a perſon, euen all amazed, at ſo great tribulation, as I endured; and with ſo much feare, to conſider, whether the Diuel were to haue power, to circumuent me, in this manner, or no. And being all diſordered, and euen tyred, without knowing what to doe with my ſelf (for I had ſeen my ſelf, in this affliction, and that very often, though yet neuer, to my thinking, in ſo great extremitie, as then) I remained foure, or fiue howers, after this manner? For there ſeemed to be no comfort at all, for me, either vpon earth, or yet from Heaue<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>; but our Lord left me ſo, in ſuffera<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ce, and vnder the feare alſo, of a thouſand dangers.</p>
            <p>O my deare Lord! and how truly art thou a true friend? and how powerfull art thou, to doe what thou wilt? and doſt neuer leaue, to loue them, who loue thee, if they loue thee indeed? Let all things praiſe thee, O thou Lord of the whole world; and O, that I could cry out, lowd enough, through that whole world, to declare, how faithfull, and true thou art, to thy freinds! All other things grow to faile vs; but thou, who art the Lord of them all, doſt neuer faile; and it is
<pb n="452" facs="tcp:100776:213"/>
little alſo, which thou permitteſt ſuch, as loue thee, to ſuffer for thee. O my deare Lord! how delicately, and how ſmoothly, yea and how ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uourily alſo, doſt thou know, how to treat ſuch Soules! O that a Creature, whome I know, had been ſo happie, as neuer to haue detained her ſelf, vpon louing anie other thing, then thee! It ſeemes indeed, O Lord, that ſometimes, thou tryeſt ſuch, as loue thee, with a kind of rigour; to the end, that, by that extremitie of trouble, they may afterward, come the better, to find, and feele thereby, the great exceſse of thy loue. O my God! that I had vnderſtanding, and learning, yea and new words; ſo to be able, to exaggerate thy workes, according to that intelligence, which my Soule hath, thereof! All this, is wanting to me, O my deare Lord; but yet, if thou forſake me not, I will neuer be wanting to thee. Let all the learned men of the world riſe-vp againſt me; Let the Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uells of Hell, torment me; yea, Let all creatures perſecute me; but only, be not thou wanting to me, O my deare Lord; for I know, by good expe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rience, with how much aduantage, and fruit, thou deliuereſt all ſuch perſons, as put their confidence in thee, alone. For, when I was in this great, and miſerable affliction of Spirit, at a time, when I had not enioyed anie one Viſion, at all, theſe only few <note n="*" place="margin">Great povver of our Lord.</note> following words, were ſufficient to free me from all trouble, and to quiet me entirely: <hi>Feare not, O my Daughter for, it is I, and I vvill not forſake thee; Doe not feare.</hi> It ſeemes to me, that, conſidering
<pb n="353" facs="tcp:100776:213"/>
what kind of Creature I was, then, there would haue been need of a long time, to perſwade me to quiet my ſelf; and that no bodie would haue been able, to doe it; and yet now, behold me heer, all quieted, and compoſed, by theſe few words; and I was endued with ſtrength, with courage, &amp; with ſecuritie, which was accompa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nied with a kind of repoſe, and light; in ſuch ſort, as that, at that verie inſtant, I ſaw my Soule be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come a direct other thing, then it was before; and, me thinkes, I could euen haue diſputed againſt the whole world, in proofe, that this, pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceeded from Almightie God. O what a good deare God, is this! O what a good deare Lord is he, and how very powerfull! for not only doth he giue the counſaile, but the remedie alſo. His verie Words, are Workes; and O, how doth he, both ſtrengthen our Faith, and encreaſe our Loue? It is really very true, that I often called to minde, how our Lord had commanded the windes, to com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe, and quiet themſelues, at Sea, when a Tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peſt had been raiſed. And ſo alſo, did I ſay: Who is this, whome all the Powers of my Soule obey? and who, at an inſtant, brings-in light, to chace ſo great an obſcuritie away; and makes that hart, grow ſoft, and ſupple, which ſeemed to haue the verie hardnes of ſtone; and knowes, how to driue, and draw-downe the water of ſweet teares, where there was ſo great a drougth, ſo long be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore. Who is he, that can inſpire theſe deſires? Who can imprint ſuch a courage? what was I
<pb n="354" facs="tcp:100776:214"/>
about, to doubt? and what can I feare? What is this? I deſire, to ſerue this Lord; and I pretend no other thing, then to pleaſe him; I renounce all contentment, and eaſe, or anie other good at all, but only the accompliſhing of his Will. For, of this, I was very ſure, in my opinion; and that I might ſafely affirme it; that, ſince this Lord is ſo powerfull, as, I ſee, he is; and as I know, he is; and that all the Diuels of Hell, are his Slaues; and of this, there can be no doubt, ſince it is matter of Faith; and I being the Seruant of this Lord, and King, what hurt can they all, be able to doe me? and, why may not I haue ſtrength enough, to fight with all the Powers of Hell?</p>
            <p>I then, tooke a Croſſe into my hand; and really, I thought, God gaue me courage to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiue, that I ſhould be ſhortly, another kinde of woeman; and that I was not to be afrayd, to wreſtle a Fall, with the <note n="*" place="margin">Hovv quickly she gott courage against the Diuells.</note> Diuels; but conceiued, that, togeather with that Croſſe, I ſhould be eaſily able, to ouercome them all; yea and once, I pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uoked them thus: Come towards me, as manie of you, as dare; for I, being the Seruant of our Lord, will ſee, what you all, can doe againſt me. And it is moſt certaine, that I thought, they were afrayd of me; and, for my part, I remained ſo, in quiet, and ſo totally, without feare of them all, that all the feares, which I had formerly concei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ued, till that verie preſent time, were remoued from me. For, though I ſaw them ſometimes, (as I ſhall declare afterward) yet I neuer feared them
<pb n="355" facs="tcp:100776:214"/>
more, but conceiued that they were rather af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>frayd of me. I poſſeſſed a dominion ouer them, which had been giuen me, by the Lord of all Creatures: and I make no more reckoning of them, then of ſo manie Flyes; and they ſeem to be, of ſo cowardlie a nature, that, when once they come to find, that they are not eſteemed, they haue no power at all. For, this kind of enemie, knowes not, how to ſet vpon anie one, who ren<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders not himſelf vp, to them; or els; when Al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mightie God permitts, for the greater good of his Seruants, that they may tempt, and torment them. I would to God, it might pleaſe his Diuine Maieſtie, that we would feare, whome indeed, we ought to feare; and that we might perfectly vnderſtand; that we ſhall receiue more preiudice, by committing anie <note n="*" place="margin">A moſt certaine truth.</note> one ſingle Veniall ſinne, then by all the power of Hell, put togeather; for, this is a moſt certaine truth. How extreamly doe theſe Diuels carrie vs frighted, vp, and downe, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe our ſelues indeed, will needs giue occaſion thereof, by our being ſo cloſe faſtned, as we are, to our Honours, to our Eſtates, and to our De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lights? For then; we being ioyned togeather, with theſe impediments, by louing, and deſiring to poſſeſſe them, who are our contraries, &amp; whome we ought to abhorre, they grow able, to doe vs much hurt. For, we enable them, to fight againſt our verie ſelues, with our owne weapons, which we put into their hands; though indeed, we were to defend our ſelues, thereby, againſt them; And
<pb n="356" facs="tcp:100776:215"/>
this is both pitty, and ſhame. But now, if, on the other ſide, we ſhall reſolue to abhorre all thoſe things, for the loue of our Lord, and embrace his Croſſe, and pitch vpon doing him ſeruice, in good earneſt, he flyes as faſt away from theſe ſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lid truths, as a man would doe, from the Plague. In fine, he is a freind of Lyes; yea and a verie Lye, himſelf. He is eaſily kept from medling much, with ſuch perſons as walke entirely according to Truth; but when once he can diſcouer, that a mans Vnderſtanding growes to be obſcured, he hath a particular grace, in procuring to breake the verie ſtrings of his eyes; and if he ſee one, al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ready proue ſo blind, as that he will needs build his reſt, and eaſe, vpon vaine things, (and ſo vaine, as that, being things of this world, they are no better, then toyes, fitt for children) he findes already; that ſuch a perſon, is a verie Child, and ſo he treates him like ſuch an one; and wreſtles with him, more or leſſe, as he ſees cauſe.</p>
            <p>I beſeech our Bleſſed Lord, that I may neuer proue to be one of theſe, but that his Diuine Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ieſtie, may be pleaſed to doe me ſo much Fauour, as that I may vnderſtand that, to be eaſe, and reſt, which is, indeed, true eaſe, and reſt; and that, to be honour; which is true Honour; &amp; delight, which is true delight; and not the direct contrarie, to all this; and then, a figg for all the Diuels in Hell; for then, they ſhall be, all of them, afrayd of me. For my part, I vnderſta<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>d not thoſe feares of the Diuel, and the Diuel; and I know not what; when we
<pb n="357" facs="tcp:100776:215"/>
may be able to ſay, God, and God, &amp;c. and ſo make thoſe Wretches, tremble. For already, we know well enough, that the Diuel is not able to ſtirre, vnleſſe our Lord permit him. What then, may be the ground of all theſe diſorders? It is cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainly, that I am more afrayd of them, who are ſo frighted by the Diuel, then of the Diuel himſelf; for he is vtterly vnable, to doe me hurt, whereas theſe others (eſpecially, if they be Ghoſtlie Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers) may put Soules to much diſquiet; and, for my part, I haue paſſed ſome yeares, through ſo great trouble, that now, I am euen amazed to conſider, how I haue been able to endure it. But Bleſſed be our Lord, who hath aſſiſted me, in ſo good earneſt;</p>

            <p>I Eſteem the courage, which our Lord hath vouchſafed to giue me, againſt all the Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uels of Hell, to be one of the great Fauours, which it hath pleaſed his Diuine Maieſtie, to doe mee; ſince for a Soule to goe cowardly on, and to be fearefull indeed, of anie thing,
<pb n="358" facs="tcp:100776:216"/>
but only to offend the Maieſtie of Almightie God, is an extreame inconuenience. For, ſince we haue a King, who is Omnipotent, and ſo great a Lord, that he can doe, what he liſtes, and who brings all things into ſubiection, vnder himſelf, there is no feare at all, to be had; and therefore, as I was ſaying, we haue no cauſe to doubt; ſo that we walke ſincerely, and with puritie of conſci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence, in the preſence of his Diuine Maieſtie. And in order to this end, I ſhall be glad, to haue all the feares in the world, to offend him, in anie one inſtant of my whole life; who is able in the verie ſelf-ſame inſtant, to deſtroy, and annihilate vs all. As long as his Diuine Maieſtie is pleaſed with vs, there is no Creature, who can ſtand againſt vs, without hauing his head broken, for his paines. You will, peraduenture, ſay, that this is very true; but yet now, on the other ſide, where ſhall we find that Soule, which ſtands ſo ſtreight, as that ſhe may be wholy pleaſing to him? and becauſe ſhe is not ſo, ſhe is in feare. I anſwer, that I am ſure, that, that pure, and innocent Soule, is none of mine, which indeed is very wretched, and vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>profitable, and ſurcharged euen with a thouſand miſeries. But yet ſtill, we haue this comfort, that Almightie God doth not proceed with ſuch ri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gours, as men doe; for he knowes, and conſiders our frailties; and the Soule hath wayes of vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtanding, and finding in it ſelf, by great con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iectures, whether, really, ſhe loue his Diuine Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ieſtie, or no; for in ſuch, as ariue once to this ſtate,
<pb n="359" facs="tcp:100776:216"/>
our loue to him, is not now, a kind of diſſembled, or diſguiſed loue, as it vſes ſometimes to be, in the beginnings; but it is accompanied with ſo great impulſes, and euen impetuoſities of deſire, to ſee Almightie God, as I ſhall afterward declare; or rather, as I haue declared already; and all things are wont to afflict; all things to wearie, &amp; tyre; and all things doe euen torment her, vnleſſe it be only God, or for God. There is not ſo much, as anie repoſe, which doth not diſpleaſe her; becauſe ſhe findes her ſelf abſent, from her true repoſe; and ſo it falls-out to be very euident, that things paſſe not heer, in a diſſembling way.</p>
            <p>It hath hapned to me, in former times, that I found my ſelf, in great tribulations; and I was ſubiect to manie detractions, (by occaſion of a certaine buſines, whereof I may haue cauſe to ſpeake afterward) from all that Houſe, where I liue, yea and from my Order; and I was afflicted, vpon manie accidents, which occurred then; at which time, it pleaſed our Lord, to vtter theſe expreſſe words to me: <hi>Of vvhat art thou afrayd? Doſt thou not knovv, that I am Omnipotent? I vvill ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>complish all that, vvhich I haue promiſed thee.</hi> And in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed, he accompliſhed it afterwards, very well. But euen inſtantly, there remained ſuch a kind of ſtrength in me, that, me thought, I could preſent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly haue put my ſelf, to aduenture vpon other things, though they ſhould coſt me much more trouble, for the doing him ſeruice; and could haue ſuffered alſo much more, for him. And this
<pb n="360" facs="tcp:100776:217"/>
verie ſelf ſame thing, hath hapned to me ſo often, that I am not able to count the times; and he hath made me, and makes me ſtill, ſuch reprehenſions (by occaſion of thoſe imperfections, which I commit ſometimes) that they are able, euen, as it were, to annihilate the Soule. At leaſt, they bring ſo much in their company, as that ſhe is mended by them; for, his Diuine Maieſtie (as I haue ſayd) doth not only giue vs the counſaile, but the remedie. At other times, he brings back to me, the memorie of the Sinnes of my former life; and this, he moſt ordinarily vſes to doe, whenſoeuer he intends, to vouchſafe me anie extraordinarie Fauour. And he doth it in ſuch ſort, that the Soule diſcernes her ſelf, as if ſhe were really planted, at the verie Day of the Laſt Vniuerſall Iudgement; and the truth is repreſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted to her, with ſuch a kind of perſpicuitie, and claritie, that ſhe knowes not, what to doe with her ſelf. At other times, he is pleaſed to informe me of certaine dangers, concerning both my ſelf, and others, about things, which doe not happen, till three, or fowre yeares, after; but they all, were euer fulfilled; and ſome of them, might alſo be named, if there were cauſe. So that, there are ſo manie particulars, whereby it may be vnderſtood, that theſe things are of Almightie God, as that, in my opinion, they cannot but be knowne, and acknowledged. The moſt ſecure proceeding conſiſts, in that, ſuch a perſon doe not faile, to impart her whole Soule, to her Ghoſtlie Father;
<pb n="361" facs="tcp:100776:217"/>
and that he be a learned man; and that ſhe doe entirely obey him. At leaſt, this is the courſe, which I take; and without this, I could haue no reſt; nor were it indeed fitt, that we woemen, ſhould haue anie; ſince we haue no learning; and there can be no hurt at all, in this, but manie ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uantages, and benefits; as our Lord himſelf hath told me, manie times; I ſay, manie times.</p>
            <p>I had once a Ghoſtlie Father, who mortifyed me very much; and ſometimes, he did euen afflict me; and brought me a great deale of trouble; and diſquieted me, in extraordinarie manner; and yet it was he, who, in my opinion, did me the moſt good, of them all. And though I loued him very much, yet I had ſome temptations, to leaue him; for it ſeemed to me, that I was much preiudiced, by thoſe inconueniences which he was wont to giue me concerning my Prayer. But yet euer, when I was determining to doe this, I inſtantly vnderſtood, that I was to forbeare it; and I re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiued ſuch a reprehenſion from our Lord, as de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feated, and, as it were annihilated, me more, then all that, which my Ghoſtlie Father, could lay vpon me. And ſometimes, he tired me outright, with asking me queſtions, on the one ſide, and making me ſome reproofe, on the other; and I had need of no leſſe, then all this; ſo double, and ſo weake a will I had. He told me once, that it was not to obey, if withall, I were not reſolued to ſuffer; and that I was to caſt mine eyes, vpon what he had been content toendure for me; and that ſo,
<pb n="362" facs="tcp:100776:218"/>
the hardeſt things, would become eaſie.</p>
            <p>Another Ghoſtlie Father of mine; to whome I was wont to Confeſſe my ſelf, in the beginnings, gaue me once this aduiſe, that, ſince it had been found by tryall, that the Spirit was good, I ſhould now carrie things, in abſolute ſilence; and not giue notice thereof, to anie Creature; for that it was better, to wrap-vp theſe kindes of things in that manner. As for me, I miſliked not this; for, whenſoeuer I was to declare them to my Ghoſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lie Father, I grew to be ſo much troubled, and conceiued my ſelf to be ſo much affronted by it, that I had much leſſe difficultie, to Confeſſe my greateſt Sinnes. And eſpecially, if I were to declare thoſe higheſt Fauours, which our Lord vouchſaf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed to impart, I thought, they were not likelie to beleiue it, but to make a ieaſt, and ſcorne of me. But indeed, I was cheifly troubled ſo much at it, becauſe it ſeemed to amount to a kind of irreuer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence, towards the wonders of Almightie God; and for this reaſon, I would haue been glad, to conceale them. But I quickly came to vnderſtand, how that Ghoſtlie Father had giuen me <note n="*" place="margin">This vvas a very ill aduiſe indeed.</note> very ill aduiſe; and that I was, by no meanes, to conceale anie thing, from him, who was to receiue my Confeſſions; becauſe there was much ſecuritie for me, to deale clearly with him; and that, if I proceeded otherwiſe, I might perhaps fall into errour, at one time, or other. Whenſoeuer our Lord commanded me anie thing, in my Prayer, if my Ghoſtlie Father chanced to bid me doe
<pb n="363" facs="tcp:100776:218"/>
otherwiſe, our Lord would returne to command me, to obey my Ghoſtlie Father; and yet againe afterward, his Diuine Maieſtie, would direct him, to command me, to doe that verie thing, which our Lord himſelf had commanded me to doe, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore.</p>
            <p>When once they tooke manie Bookes, written in Spaniſh, from me, that I might not reade them, I was much troubled at it; for, ſome of them, ſerued me for recreation; and now I was not able to reade them, becauſe there were none left there, but in Latin. But then, our Bleſſed Lord ſayd theſe words to me: <hi>Be not troubled; for I vvill giue thee a Liuing Booke.</hi> I could not, for my part, vnderſtand, why this had been ſayd to me; for then, I had neuer had Viſion; but within a little while after, I vnderſtood it very well; for I haue had ſo much to thinke of, and to recollect my ſelf about, concerning thoſe things, which I ſaw before me, and our Bleſſed Lord hath ſhewed me ſo great loue, as to inſtruct me, by ſuch a mul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>titude of wayes, that I haue had very little need of Bookes, or rather, in effect, none at all; for, his Diuine Maieſtie, hath been that true Booke to me, wherein I haue, indeed, ſeen Truths. And now, bleſſed be ſuch a Booke, as this, which leaues that, imprinted in the verie hart, which is to be read; yea and ſo, as that it can neuer be forgot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten. Who can ouer, ſee our Bleſſed Lord, all couered-ouer with wounds, and afflicted with perſecutions of all kindes, and yet, not be conten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted,
<pb n="364" facs="tcp:100776:219"/>
to embrace them; yea and to deſire them, and to loue them? Who can ſee, though but a very little, of that Glorie, which he giues to ſuch, as ſerue him, and not come inſtantly to know, that all that, which we can poſſibly euer, either doe, or ſuffer heer, is directly nothing; ſince we hope for ſo high a reward? He, who ſees the tor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments, which the damned Soules of Hell, endure, how can he chooſe, but eſteem all the torments of this life, to be a kind of delightfull thing, in compariſon of thoſe others? and how can he chooſe but know the mightie obligation, which he hath to our Bleſſed Lord, for hauing deliuered him, ſo often, out of that ſad place.</p>
            <p>But becauſe I meane heerafter, by the Fauour of Almightie God, to ſpeake more of ſome parti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cular things of theſe kinds, I now intend to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clare, the proceſſe of mine owne Life; and for the preſent, I beſeech Almightie God, that I may haue knowne, how to expreſſe my ſelf in that, which I haue ſayd already. I well beleiue, that whoſoeuer ſhall haue had experience, will haue vnderſtood me; and will haue ſeen, that I haue hapned vpon ſaying ſomewhat, which is to the purpoſe; but I ſhall not wonder a whitt, if ſuch, as haue none, ſhall conceiue, that I haue been talking idly, all this while. It ſuffices me, to ſay, as I haue ſayd, that ſo I may remaine free, from fault; nor yet, will I blame anie other, who ſhall be of a different opi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion. Our bleſſed Lord giue me grace, that I may neuer faile, in fulfilling his holie will,</p>

            <argument>
               <p>She treats of another vvay, hovv our Lord inſtructs a Soule and giues her to vnder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtand his VVill, after a very admirable manner, vvithout anie ſpeech at all. She alſo declares a certaine Viſion, and great Fauour, vvhich our Lord shevved her; and this Viſion, vvas not Imaginarie. This Chapter is very much to be noted.</p>
            </argument>
            <p>BVt now, (returning to the Diſcourſe, or Hiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>toricall part of my Life) I remained with much affliction, and trouble, but it was accom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>panied with manie prayers (as I was ſaying) which were made to our Lord, that he would be pleaſed, to conduct my Soule, by ſome other way, which might be more ſecure; ſince they told me, that the former, was, to be ſuſpected. Yet, true it is, that, howſoeuer I begged it much, of Almightie God, yet conſidering, how euidently my Soule was improued, by the courſe which I held before, I could neuer find it in my power, to deſire it harti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, and home, (though yet ſtill, I did it, in ſome ſort) vnleſſe it were ſometimes, when I was euen diſtreſſed, and all tyred out, by the things, which they ſayd to me; and by the frights, into which they put me. For now, I was wholy growne, to be
<pb n="366" facs="tcp:100776:220"/>
another Creature; and therefore, I could not cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dially deſire it. Only I put my ſelf into the hands of Almightie God, beſeeching him, that ſince he knew, what was fitteſt for me, he would be pleaſed, to accompliſh his holie Will, in all things, concerning me. But now, I ſaw plainly, that, by this way of mine, which they ſuſpected, my Soule was euen carrying-vp to Heauen, which formerly was dropping downe to Hell; And why there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore, ſhould I deſire, that this courſe might be changed? For, as for beleiuing, that it was of the Diuel, it was not in my power, euen to conſtraine my ſelf to it; though yet, I did what I could, to deſire, that I might be able to beleiue it; but it was not (as I ſayd) in my power. I offered, to this end, ſome little, poore, good workes, which I did, if I did anie. I became deuoted to ſome Saints; to the end, that, by their meanes, I might be deliuered from the Diuel. I performed the Deuotions of Nine Dayes; I reco<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>mended my ſelf to S Hilarion, and to S. Michael alſo, the Archangell, for I had lately applyed my ſelf to him, for this purpoſe; and I importuned alſo mame other Saints, that our Lord might be pleaſed, by their interceſſion, to conduct me, in the way of Truth; I ſay, that they would find ſome meanes, to perfect this buſines of mine, with his Diuine Maieſtie. In fine, after the end of two yeares, which, both I, and other perſons, had wholy employed, with all their prayers, and mine, in order to this end, that our Lord might be pleaſed, either to conduct my Soule
<pb n="367" facs="tcp:100776:220"/>
by ſome other way, or els vouchſafe to declare, that this way, wherein I went, was right, (for now, thoſe <hi>VVords,</hi> and <hi>Speeches,</hi> which I haue re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lated, that our Lord would be vttering to me ſometimes, were growne very ordinarie, &amp; euen continuall) that chanced, and occurred to me, which I will now declare.</p>
            <p>As I was in Prayer, one day (and it was vpon the Feſtiuitie of the Glorious S. Peter) I ſaw, ſtand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing very neer me, or rather, (to ſay better) mee thought I felt (for indeed I ſaw nothing at all, with the eyes, either of my Bodie, or of my Minde) that Chriſt our Lord was cloſe by me; and I found, in fine, that it was he, in my opinion, who was ſpeaking to me. But now I (who was extreamly ignorant, till then, that there might be anie ſuch thing, in the world, as ſuch a Viſion) fell, at the firſt, into a mightie feare; and I could doe no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing but weepe; though yet, through his giuing me aſſurance, by his ſpeaking but one onlie word, I found my ſelf; as I had formerly been, not only without feare, and very quiet, but euen with Regalo, and delight. Me thought, that Chriſt Ieſus, our Lord, went euer cloſe to me, on one ſide; but the Viſion not being Imaginarie, or repreſented in any Forme, I perceiued not, in what ſhape he was. But as for his being euer, on my right ſide, I found, and felt that, very clearly; and that he was the witnes, of whatſoeuer I did; and that I could not be recollected, though it were neuer ſo little, (or rather indeed, vnleſſe I were
<pb n="368" facs="tcp:100776:221"/>
much diuerted, or diſtracted) but I muſt needs, in fine, vnderſtand, that he was very neer me. I then went immediatly to my Ghoſtlie Father, being ſufficiently vexed, and greiued, that I muſt let him know it. He asked me, what Forme, or Figure he had, when I ſaw him; and I told him, that I had not ſeen him. Vpon this, he enquired then, how I knew, that it was Chriſt our Lord. To this I anſwered, that I knew no more, but that I could not poſſibly faile, or forbeare, to vnderſtand, and know, that he was cloſe to me; and that I found, and felt it plainly; and that now, the recollection of my Soule, in Prayer of Quiet, was farre greater, and more continuall; &amp; that the effects were very different from thoſe others, which I had formerly found; and that the thing was very certaine, and cleare. For my part, I could doe no more, but bring diuerſe Compariſons, whereby to giue my ſelf to be vnderſtood; but yet certainly, in my opinion, there is none, which can ſuite very well, to ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſe this kind of Viſion. For, as this is one of the higheſt kind (as I was told afterwards, by a cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taine holie man, and of great Spirit, called <hi>Fray Pedro de Alcantara,</hi> whome I ſhall mention after<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward, more at large; (and the ſame hath been alſo told me, by other great learned men) and that this, is one of thoſe Fauours, where the Diuel can leaſt intermeddle, or intrude himſelf, of all others) ſo haue we heer no words, or tearmes at all, wherewith to declare it; at leaſt we, who know ſo little; though ſuch as are learned, will, peradue<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ture,
<pb n="369" facs="tcp:100776:221"/>
be able to doe it better. For, when I ſay, that I neither ſaw this, with the eyes of the Bodie, nor of the Minde (becauſe it was no Imaginarie Vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion) how come I to vnderſtand, and how can I vndertake, and affirme, more clearly, &amp; certainly, that Chriſt our Lord was ſtanding neer me, then if I had ſeen him, with my verie eyes. For it ſeemes indeed to be, as if a perſon were in the darke, who ſees not another, that ſtands by him; or as if the ſame perſon were blind. Some reſemblance, I ſay, this carries; though yet, not very much. For in this laſt caſe, a man may come to know it, by the way of ſeuerall Senſes; becauſe he may heare the other ſpeake, or ſtirre; or he may touch him; But heer, there is nothing of all this; nor is there heer, anie darknes at all; but only the thing is repre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſented to the Soule, by a certaine notice, which is more cleare then the Sunne. I ſay not, that anie Sunne is ſeen, nor anie clearnes, or brightnes at all; but only a certaine light, which illuminates, and informes the Vnderſtanding (though yet without ſeing anie light) to the end, that the Soule may enioy ſo high a good. Now, this brings great be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nefits with it. Yet is it not like ſuch a Preſence of God, as manie times is felt in the Minde; and eſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cially by ſuch perſons, as be ariued to Vnion, and Quiet Prayer; who, in reſoluing to beginne to make that Prayer, ſeem to find the perſon readie at hand, to whome to ſpeake; and we ſeem to vnderſtand, that he heares vs; by the effects, and ſpirituall feelings, which we find, of great Loue,
<pb n="370" facs="tcp:100776:222"/>
and Faith, and other firme purpoſes, and reſolu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions, accompanied with much tendernes of De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>notions. This is a great Fauour of Almightie God; and let him eſteem it much, who hath it; for it is a very eleuated, and high Prayer; but yet, it is no Viſion; but heer it is vnderſtood, that Almightie God is there, by the effects; which, as I haue ſayd, he workes in the Soule; for, in this manner of Prayer, doth his Diuine Maieſtie vouchſafe, to giue hemſelf, then, and there, to be felt. But now, heer, it is clearly found, that <hi>Chriſt Ieſus</hi> the Sonne of the <hi>Virgin,</hi> is preſent. In that other manner of Prayer, there are certaine influences of the Diui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nitie repreſented; but heer, togeather with them, we find, that the moſt Sacred Humanitie alſo of Chriſt our Lord, doth accompanie vs, to doe vs fauour. My Ghoſtlie Father then asked me this queſtion: <hi>VVho told you, that it vvas Ieſus Christ?</hi> Him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf told me ſo, (anſwered I) and that manie times; but yet, euen before he told me ſo, it was im printed vpon my Vnderſtanding, that it was he; yea and euen before this, he told me ſo; and yet ſtill I ſaw him not. If anie man, whome I had neuer ſeen, but only had heard newes of him, ſhould come to ſpeake with me (I being either blind, or in the darke) and ſhould tell me, who he were, I ſhould beleiue him; and yet I could not ſo reſolutly affirme him, to be that per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon, as if I had ſeen him. But yet now, in this other caſe, I could; for heer, there is imprinted, ſo cleare a notice of him, in the Minde, without
<pb n="371" facs="tcp:100776:222"/>
ſeeing him, that it ſeemes a kind of impoſſibilitie, to doubt it; for, our Lord will haue it ſo engrauen vpon the Vnderſtanding, that it can no more be queſtioned, then euen that, which we ſee; no nor yet ſo much; for, in things, which we ſee, there re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maines, ſometimes, a ſuſpicion, whether we might not haue fancied ſuch a thing, and ſo miſtaken it. But heer, though vpon the ſuddaine, and, as it were, by way of ſurpriſe, one may beginne to fall vpon a kind of ſuſpicion, or doubt, yet ſtill, vpon the whole matter, we remaine in ſo great a cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taintie, as that the doubt continues not, to haue place. And ſo alſo, doth it fall out; though yet, in a different manner, that God inſtructs the Soule, &amp; ſpeakes to it, but yet without ſpeaking at all, in ſuch ſort, as I haue already declared.</p>
            <p>This is a certaine kind of language, which hath ſo much of the Celeſtiall in it, that it cannot well be giuen to be vnderſtood by vs heer, how much ſoeuer we may deſire it, vnleſſe our Lord himſelf be pleaſed to teach it, by experience. For, our Bleſſed Lord conueyes, and places that, in the moſt interiour part of the Soule, which he is pleaſed, that the ſame Soule ſhall vnderſtand, and know; and there, doth he repreſent it, without either anie image of his perſon, or anie forme of words; but only after the way of that kind of Viſion, which I haue already touched. And now, let this manner of Almightie God's making the Soule vnderſta<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>d, what he will, in the way of great Truths, and myſteries, be much obſerued. For,
<pb n="372" facs="tcp:100776:223"/>
manie times, that, which I vnderſtand, when our Lord declares anie Viſion, which his Diuine Maieſtie is pleaſed to repreſent to me, is after this manner; and me thinkes, it is in ſuch occaſions, as where the Diuel is leaſt able to intermeddle, or intrude himſelf, for theſe reaſons; and if they be not found, I am likelie enough, to be deceiued. Now, this kind of Viſion, and language, is ſo in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wardly a thing of Spirit, that heer, there is no kind of ſpringing, or euen ſtirring, in anie of the Powers of the Minde; nor yet in anie of the Senſes of the Bodie, in my opinion; by which meanes, the Diuel may be able to make himſelf the gainer. Thus, I ſay, it happens ſometimes; as namely, when it laſts but a very little while. For, at ſome other times, me thinkes, that neither the Powers of the Minde, are ſuſpended, nor yet the Senſes of the Bodie diſabled, but that they are all, at home, and in vſe. The other, happens not alwayes in this degree of Contemplation, but rather very ſeldome. I ſay, that, when they are ſo loſt, we neither operate anie thing, nor doe anie thing; but all ſeemes, to be the worke of our Lord. It is, as when a food is already conueyd into the ſtomack, without either our hauing eaten it, or ſo much as knowing, who layd it there; but only we vnderſtand well, that there it is; though, in that caſe, it be neither knowne, what the food is, nor who carried it thither. But heer, it is very differet; for here, the food is knowne, though yet, how it got thither, I cannot tell; for neither did I ſee it; nor vnderſtand it; nor was I euer
<pb n="373" facs="tcp:100776:223"/>
moued to deſire it; nor had it euer come to my knowledge before, that ſuch a thing, could poſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſibly be.</p>
            <p>In the <hi>Speech,</hi> vpon which I touched before, Al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mightie God makes the Vnderſtanding obſerue, and reflect, vpon that, which is ſayd; whether it deſire to vnderſtand, or no. For there, it ſeemes, that the Soule hath ſome other kind of eates, wherewith to heare; &amp; that he makes her harken, and not, the while, to thinke of ſomewhat els; as if one, who could heare well, were not ſuffered, to ſtopp his eares; and that they cryed out alowd, to him, who would therefore be faine to heare them, whether he would, or no; but ſomewhat, in fine, he doth, ſince he is attentiue to vnderſtand, what they ſay. But heer, the Soule doth inſt no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing; for, euen that little, which was done in the former way, and which was only to harken, is taken from her now; for now, ſhe findes all dreſſed, to her hand; yea and all eaten by her, too. So that now, there is nothing to be done by her, but to enioy. Iuſt ſo, as anie one, who, without euer hauing learnt, or ſo much as endeauoured to read, and much more, without anie ſtudying at all, ſhould find that whole Science already poſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeſſed by himſelf, and that, without knowing at all, either how, or whence it came, ſince he had neuer procured to acquire it, with ſo much, as learning his A. B. C. And this laſt Compariſon, me thinkes, declares ſome part of this Celeſtiall guift; for, the Soule findes her ſelf heer, to be growne
<pb n="374" facs="tcp:100776:224"/>
wiſe, vpon a ſuddaine; and that the Myſterie of the moſt Holie Trinitie, and other moſt ſublime Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticles, are ſo exactly declared to her, that there is not anie Theologue, or Diuine, in the world, with whome ſhe might not aduenture to diſpute, con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerning the truth of thoſe high points.</p>
            <p>The Soule remaines heer, in ſuch an amazement, that ſome one ſuch Fauour, as this, ſuffices, to worke a totall change in her; and to make her loue nothing, but only him, who, without anie labour at all, of hers, hath made her capable of ſo vnſpeakable bleſſings; and to whome he commu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nicates his ſecrets; and whome he treats with ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guments of ſo great, and deare friendſhip, and loue, that they <note n="*" place="margin">The incredible deare ſvveet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nes of our B. Lord to a Soule.</note> endure not, ſo much, as to be written. For he doth ſome ſuch kinds of Fauour, as might euen beſpeake a kind of ſuſpicion, and doubt, in the hearer; in regard, that they are of ſo great admiration; and haue been imparted to a perſon, who hath deſerued them ſo very ill. And, in fine, if we bring not a very Liuelie, and euen luſty Faith with vs, they cannot be beleiued; and therefore I reſolue, to ſpeake of few of thoſe, which our Lord hath been pleaſed to vouchſafe me, vnleſſe I be expreſly commanded; and vnleſſe it be of ſome few Viſions, which perhaps, may ferue, to doe good, in ſome kind: To the end, that anie ſuch perſons, as to whome our Lord may be pleaſed to impart the like, may not wonder, and thinke it impoſſible, as I did; or els, that ſo, I may declare the manner, and way, by which it hath
<pb n="375" facs="tcp:100776:224"/>
pleaſed our Lord, to conduct my Soule; that being the verie thing, which they haue commanded me to write.</p>
            <p>Returning therefore now, to this manner of vnderſtanding theſe kinds of things; me thinkes, our Lord is pleaſed, that, by all meanes, this Soule of ours, ſhould haue ſome notice heer, euen of that, which paſſes in Heauen; and that, as Soules doe there vnderſtand one another, really, without ſpeaking, (which, for my part, I neuer knew be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore, (and this is moſt certainly true) till our Lord, through his goodnes, made me ſee it, and ſhewed it me, in a certaine Rapt of mine) So alſo ſhould it be heer, in this world; and that ſo, Al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mightie God, and the Soule, might be able to vnderſtand one another; and that, vpon this ſole cauſe, and reaſon, in regard that his Diuine Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ieſtie is pleaſed, that they ſhall doe ſo, without anie other artifice, or meanes; that ſo, the mutu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>all loue, which theſe two deare freinds carrie to one another, may be giuen by them, to be mu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tually vnderſtood. Iuſt ſo, as in this world, when two perſons loue one another very dearly, and be endued with a good vnderſtanding, and witt, they ſeem able to vnderſtand themſelues toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther; euen without, ſo much as ſignes; and by only, looking well, vpon one another. Thus ought it to be, in our caſe, ſince, (without our knowing expreſly, how) theſe two Louers looke earneſtly, vpon one another, in the face; as the Spouſe ſaith to his Beloued, in the Canticles; for ſo, I thinke,
<pb n="376" facs="tcp:100776:225"/>
I haue heard, that it is expreſſed there.</p>
            <p>O admirable benignitie of thee, O Lord, who permitteſt thy ſelf, to be looked vpon, by thoſe eyes, which haue abuſed their ſight, ſo much, as theſe of my Soule, haue done! At leaſt, O my deare Lord, let them now, be accuſtomed (after this ſight of thee) to looke no more, vpon anie inferi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>our, and baſe Obiects; nor let anie thing be able, to pleaſe them, out of thee. O great ingratitude of mortall Creatures! how farre, wilt thou be able, to atiue? For now I know, euen by experi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence, that this is litterally true, which I am ſay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, That, whatſoeuer is poſſibly able to be ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſed by me, is no more, then the verie leaſt part of that Fauour, which thou imparteſt to anie ſuch Soule, as thou vouchſafeſt to bring to ſuch a State, as this. O Soules, which haue begunne to vſe Prayer; and you, who haue really Faith, and firme Beleif; what bleſſings, and benefits are you poſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bly able to ſeeke, and get, which may, anie way, be compared, euen to the leaſt of thoſe, which are obtained, by the Seruants of Almightie God, euen in this mortall life of ours? And conſider, (for it is moſt certainly true) that Almightie God im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parts himſelf thus, euen heer, to ſuch, <note n="*" place="margin">Ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerue this, vvell.</note> as forſake all things, for loue of him. For, he is no accepter of perſons, and he loues all men; nor hath anie one of them anie excuſe, how wicked ſoeuer he may haue been; ſince our Lord hath proceeded, after this manner, euen with me; and aduanced me to ſuch a condition, as you ſee. Conſider alſo,
<pb n="377" facs="tcp:100776:225"/>
that this, which I am ſaying now, is not ſo much as a little Cipher of that, which were to be ſayd; but, only ſo much is heer deliuered, as is neceſſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rie, for the giuing this manner of Viſion, and Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uour; which Almightie God, is pleaſed to doe to a Soule, to be, in ſome ſort, vnderſtood.</p>
            <p>But now, it is in no power of mine, to declare that, which ſhe findes, and feeles, when our Lord is pleaſed, to impart thoſe ſecrets, and greatneſſes of his; togeather with that delight, which is ſo highly ſuperiour to all thoſe others, which can poſſibly be imparted by this world; and that they doe, with a mightie deale of reaſon, make them, who poſſeſſe the ſame, euen abhorre all the plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſures of the earth; which, when they be all, clapt togeather, are no better, then meer dung, and durt; nay it is, after a ſort, euen to giue one a Vo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mit, to bring theſe, into anie compariſon at all, with thoſe others; euen though they ſhould be able to laſt for euer. And yet, of theſe Celeſtiall ioyes, what kind of poore proportion of them, is that, which he is pleaſed, to impart, in this world? No more, then, as it were, one ſlight, ſin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gle drop of water, of that huge full, flowing Riuer, which is prepared for vs, in Heauen. It is a verie ſhame, &amp; ſcorne; (and really I employ it all againſt my ſelf; (and if it were poſſible, for Soules to be affronted, euen in Heauen, I ſhould haue cauſe to find my ſelf aſhamed when I were there, more then anie Creature) to thinke that we ſhould ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pect, to enioy. <note n="*" place="margin">This Saint yovv ſee, vvas certainly no Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teſtant.</note> ſo great benedictions, and delights,
<pb n="378" facs="tcp:100776:226"/>
and glorie, as is to be infinit in that next Life, and all, at the onlie coſt, of our deare Lord IESVS. And ſhall we not weep, perhaps, at leaſt, with the Daughters of <hi>Ieruſalem,</hi> ſince we will hot helpe him to carrie the Croſſe, as <hi>Simon Cyreneus</hi> did? Or can we euer thinke of coming to enioy that, by the way, and meanes of pleaſures, and paſſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times, which he vouchſafed to get, and gaine for vs, vpon the price of his owne moſt pretious Bloud? This is abſolutly impoſſible. And can we thinke, by our aſpiring to vaine Honour, that we may be able to remedie, and redreſſe that huge contempt, and ſcorne, which he endured for vs? There is no manner of ſenſe, in anie ſuch co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ceipt. No, no; the courſe is vtterly miſtaken; and we ſhall neuer be able to ariue, at that iourneys end, by anie ſuch erroneous way, as this. Your Reuer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence muſt cry-out alowd, to make theſe truths be heard, and beleiued, by the world. And ſince it hath pleaſed Almightie God, to take this power, and libertie, from me, I would alwaies be crying them out, to my ſelf; but both he heard me, and I came alſo to vnderſtand him, ſo very late, as may be ſeen, by what I haue written heer; and it is no leſſe, then matter of extreame confu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion to me, to ſpeake of it; and therefore I will now hold my peace; and, for the preſent, will only ſay that, which I haue been conſidering ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times; which is, that I humbly beſeech Almightie God, to bring me once, to ſuch tearmes, as that I may enioy this immenſe Good. O what an acci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dentall
<pb n="379" facs="tcp:100776:226"/>
glorie, and guſt, will it be, for the Bleſſed Saints of Heauen, who enioy this felicitie, when they ſhall find, that, although it were late, yet at length, they left nothing vnperformed, which it was poſſible for them to doe, for the loue of Al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mightie God? Nor did they faile, to preſent him, with the verie vttermoſt of whatſoeuer they could offer, in all kindes, according to the power, which they had, and to the condition, wherein they were placed; he giuing them ſtill more, who had more. How rich will he then, find himſelf to be, who left all the riches he had, for Chriſt our Lord? How full of honour, who reiected all ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour; and tooke no pleaſure, in anie other thing, then to find himſelf abaſed, and deſpiſed, for the loue of him. How wiſe will he ſee himſelf then, who reioyced to ſee the world, hold him for a foole; ſince they called Wiſdome it ſelf, by that name? But how few of ſuch, as theſe, are there now, in the world, by reaſon of our great Sinnes? Alas, it ſeemes, that all they, are ſpent, and gone, long agoe, whome the world was wont to eſtee<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> for madd fooles, when they ſaw them performe thoſe heroicall acts, of true Louers of Chriſt our Lord. O world! O world! How doſt thou goe gaining Honour, by procuring, that few may haue the witt, to vnderſtand thee right?

ſo, as now we are growne to vnderſtand the word, Diſcretion. For, now, we will needs make our ſelues beleiue, that it is matter, forſooth, of ſmall edification, not to goe, vp, and downe the world, with great authoritie, and compoſition of cloathing, and dreſſing; euerie one, according to his condition. Nay euen to the Fryer, and Preiſt, and Nunne, ſome are now growne to be of opinion, that, to weare anie thing, which is old, or peiced, were a kind of noueltie, and a giuing ſcandall to the weake; and ſo it is alſo now, if they liue with much recollection, and vſe Men<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tall Prayer. To ſuch a paſſe, the world is growne. But the ſtudie, and practiſe of Chriſtian Perfec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, &amp; the great impulſes, which the Saints were wo<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t to haue, for the obtaining thereof, is the thing, which, I beleiue, doth more harme to the miſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able, &amp; wretched actions, which are co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>mitted by euill men, in theſe times, then it could poſſibly be of ſcandall, to anie Creature, that ſuch, as are Reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gious, ſhould publiſh that, to the world, by their workes, of which they talke by their words; to the end, that ſo, Mankinde might grow to hold this world, in meane accou<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t. For, out of ſuch kindes of ſcandall, as theſe, our Lord would draw great ſeruice, for himſelf, &amp; good, for them. And if ſome men would needs be ſcandalized at it, others would yet haue remorſe; &amp; at leaſt, we ſhould re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maine with ſome little deſigne, or draught of that, which Chriſt our Lord, &amp; his Apoſtles, endured for vs, ſince we haue now, more need of it, then euer.</p>

But O, what an excellent example, did Almigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie God take lately from vs, in the perſon of that Bleſſed man, <hi>Fray</hi> 
               <note n="*" place="margin">An ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mirable example of Pen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nance.</note> 
               <hi>Pedro de Alcantara?</hi> The world was now no longer able, euen to endure ſuch a Perfection, as his; for now, forſooth, they ſay, that the health of men, is growne weaker; and that now, we doe not liue in thoſe former times. But that holie man, liued in this time, and yet, he had as full, and great Spirit towards Al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mightie God, as men had in the dayes of old; and ſo, he trode the world downe, vnder his feet. And though euerie bodie doe not goe bare-foot, nor performe ſo ſharp, and ſtrict pennance, as he, yet are there manie other wayes, as I haue ſayd be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore, whereby a man may treade the world, vnder his feet; and our Lord, will teach vs theſe wayes, when he findes, that a man's minde is fitt, and well-prepared for them. And how great an one, did Almightie God beſtow vpon this Saint, of whome now I ſpeake; to goe, through ſeauen and fourtie yeares of his life, with ſo ſharp, and rigou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rous pennance, as is generally knowne? And I will ſay ſome little thing of it, becauſe I know, that it is all, moſt certainly true.</p>
            <p>He told me a certaine particular, and ſo he alſo did an other, from whome he was as little curious to conceale himſelf, as from me; but as for me, the only reaſon, why he did it, was the loue he bore me; becauſe our Lord, would haue it ſo; to the end, that he might help me, and encourage me alſo, in a certaine time, of ſo great neceſſitie, as I haue related.
<pb n="382" facs="tcp:100776:228"/>
And now I will declare, how, to the beſt of my remembrance, he ſaid, that he had ſlept, but one hower and a half, in the foure and twentie howers, of day, and night, for two and fourtie yeares togeather; and that it was the greateſt mortification, and trouble of pennance, that he had felt, in thoſe beginnings, to ouercome him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf, in point of ſleep; and that, in order alſo to this end, he was alwaies, at other times, either ſtand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing vpon his feet, or els kneeling; and that only, when he ſlept, he ſatt; and that with his head, leaning aſide, vpon a certaine little peice of wood, which was faſtned for that purpoſe, in the wall. To extend his bodie at length, in his Cell, was not poſſible for him, though he ſhould haue a minde to it; for it is knowne, to haue had but foure foot, and a half, in length. In all theſe two and fourtie yeares, he neuer put on his Capouch, or Hood, how hot ſoeuer the Sunne, or how great ſoeuer the rayne might be; nor did he euer weare anie thing vpon his feet; nor was his bodie clad, but only with a Habit of thick, courſe Sack<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cloath, without anie other thing at all, vpon him; and this was ſo very ſtraight, as that he might be only able, to put it on, with a little ſhort Mantle of the ſame, vpon it. He told me, that, when the weather was extreamly cold, he was wont to put off his ſayd Mantle, and to leaue alſo, the doore, and the little window of his Cell, open; that ſo, when afterward, he put the Mantle on againe, and ſhut his doore, he might giue his
<pb n="383" facs="tcp:100776:228"/>
bodie, ſo much contentment by it, as that it might be quieted, without more cloathing. It was a very ordinarie thing with him, not to eat, till the third day, after he had eaten laſt; and he told me (by way of anſwer, to the wonder, in which I was at it,) that this, was a thing very poſſible, for one, who would accuſtome himſelf to it. And a cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taine Companion of his, alſo told me, that it hapned for him ſometimes, not to eat anie thing at all, in eight dayes; but that, perhaps, might happen, when he was in Prayer; for, he vſed to haue great Rapts, and vehement impulſes, or im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>petuoſities of the loue of Almightie God; where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of my ſelf was once an eye-witnes. His pouertie, was extreame; and ſo alſo was his Mortification, euen from his youth. For he told me, that, in his time, it had hapned to him, to liue three yeares, in ſome one Houſe of his owne Order, and yet, not to know anie one of the Religious, of the ſame Houſe, but only by their ſpeech; for he neuer lifted-vp his eyes; and ſo, whenſoeuer he was to goe, of neceſſitie, to anie place, either in the ſtreets, or vpon high-wayes, he could, by no meanes, tell, how to doe it, but by following the other Religious. As for woemen, he neuer looked vpon anie of them, for the ſpace of manie yeares; and told me, that it was iuſt all one with him, to ſee anie bodie, or not to ſee them. When I came at length, to know him, he was very old; and his weaknes, and leanenes ſo extreame, that he ſeemed, not to be compoſed, &amp; made, but as euen
<pb n="384" facs="tcp:100776:229"/>
of the verie rootes of trees. With all this ſanctitie of his, he was very affable, though yet he were wont to expreſſe himſelfe, in very few words, vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſſe it were by occaſion of ſome queſtions, which might be asked him; and in that caſe, he was ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cellent companie, for he had a very choice Vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtanding. I could haue a minde, to ſay very much more of him, if I feared not, that your Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uerence would aske me, why I put my ſelf vpon this kind of diſcourſe; yea and I haue not written euen this little, without ſome feare. And there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore I ſay no more, but only, that he dyed, as he liued, in preaching, and admoniſhing the Reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gious of his Order. And when he ſaw, that he was euen come to an end, he ſayd the Pſalme of: <hi>Lae<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tatus ſum in his, quae dicta ſunt mihi: in domum Domini ibimus; I haue reioyced in that, vvhich they haue ſayd to me: vve vvill goe into the houſe of our Lord;</hi> and ſo, ſtooping dowe, and kneeling, he dyed.</p>
            <p>After this, our Lord hath been pleaſed to let me enioy more of him now, then I did, when he was aliue; for, he giues me counſaile, in diuerſe occaſions; and I haue ſeen him manie times, in extreame glorie. The firſt time, that he appeared to me, he ſayd: <hi>O hovv happie pennance vvas that, vvhich hath obtained ſo high a revvard!</hi> with manie other things of that nature. A yeare before he dyed, he appeared to me, when we were abſent, from one another; and it was declared to me, that he ſhould dye; and I aduertiſed him thereof, whilſt he was diſtant ſome leagues, from me. At
<pb n="385" facs="tcp:100776:229"/>
the inſtant, when he expired afterward, he alſo appeared to me, and told me, that he was then going to reſt. I did not beleiue the thing; but yet I related it to ſome; and within eight dayes after, the newes came to vs, that he was dead; or rather, to ſpeake more properly, that he had then, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gunne to liue for euer.</p>
            <p>And heer, behold, how the ſeuere Pennance of his life, was finiſhed in ſo large a proportion of glorie, that me thinkes, he is of more comfort to me now, then when he was heer. Our Lord told me once, that men ſhould not aske anie thing, in his name, wherein he would not heare them; and my ſelf haue recommended manie to him, to the end, that he might begg them of our Lord; and I haue found them granted. Let the ſame Lord be Bleſſed for euer; Amen.</p>
            <p>But what a talking haue I kept heer, that ſo I might ſtirre your Reuerence vp, not to make the leaſt account at all, of anie thing, in this world, as if you knew not this, already? or, as if you were not reſolued to leaue it all? or rather, as if you had not already put all this, in execution? But I ſee ſuch a deale of perdition in the world, that howſoeuer my ſaying it, ſerues for nothing, but only to wearie me, by writing it, yet withall it is a kind of vnwearying, and eaſe for me, to doe it; and ſo, all that, which I am ſaying, proues to be againſt my ſelf. Our Bleſſed Lord forgiue me, whereinſoeuer I may haue offended, concerning this particular; and I beſeech your Reuerence
<pb n="386" facs="tcp:100776:230"/>
alſo, to pardon me, for incommodating you, to little purpoſe; but it ſeemes, that I will needs make you doe Pennance, for that, wherein my ſelf commit the Sinne.</p>

            </argument>
            <p>BVt now, to returne to our purpoſe, I had that kind of Viſion aforeſayd, for ſome few dayes, after a kind of continuall manner; and it was ſo vſefull to me, that I neuer went then, out of Prayer; and beſides, whatſoeuer I then hapned to doe, I procured it might be in ſuch ſort, as that it ſhould not diſpleaſe him, whome I euidently ſaw to be there, as a witnes of all that, which paſſed. And though it be very true, that ſometimes, I had ſome feare, through the multitude of thoſe things,
<pb n="387" facs="tcp:100776:230"/>
which they would be ſaying to me, yet that trouble would not vſe to laſt long; becauſe I was well aſſured, and ſatisfyed, by our Lord himſelf.</p>
            <p>Being one day in Prayer, it pleaſed our Bleſſed Lord, to ſhew me his Hands, and nothing but his Hands; and they had ſuch an exceſſe, and heigth of beautie in them, as I am not able, by anie meanes, to expreſſe. But this, ſtruck me into a very great feare; as, indeed, euerie noueltie is wont to bring me, in the beginnings of anie Su<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pernaturall Fauour, which our Lord is pleaſed to doe me. Within few dayes after this, I ſaw alſo his Diuine Face; which did totally, me thinkes, leaue me abſorpt. For my part, I could not vnder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtand, why our Bleſſed Lord ſhewed himſelf to me ſo, by little and little; ſince afterwards, he re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolued to doe me the Fauour, that I might ſee him, all; till I came to vnderſtand, that our Lord went guiding, and conducting me, according to my naturall weaknes. And let him be eternally Bleſſed for it; ſince ſo great, and high Glorie, as that, all togeather, encountring with a Subiect, which was ſo baſe, and wicked, as my ſelf, would neuer haue been endured; and thus our Bleſſed, and Mercifull Lord, went ſo diſpoſing of things, as I haue heer expreſſed. Your Reuerence will, perhaps, imagine, that there was no need of much courage, and ſtrength of mind, for the beholding of a Face, and Hands, which were ſo beautifull. But yet it is to be vnderſtood, that ſuch Bodies, as are <note n="*" place="margin">Hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mane frailty, and ce<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſtiall glory, are not com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>patible.</note> glorifyed, haue ſo very great a heigth of
<pb n="388" facs="tcp:100776:231"/>
beautie, that the glorie, which they bring, to be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hold a thing ſo delightfull, and Supernaturall, doth euen, as it were, exceed our capacitie; and ſo, conſequently, I grew to be all, in much diſor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der, and trouble; though yet afterwards, I remain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed with certaintie, and ſecuritie, and ſuch other effects, as that all feare did quickly vaniſh.</p>
            <p>Vpon a certaine day of S. Paul, whilſt I was hearing Maſſe, the whole Humanitie of Chriſt our Lord, was repreſented to me, as it vſes to be painted, after the Reſurrection; but with ſo great Beautie, and Maieſtie, as I wrote once to your Reuerence, when you commanded me ſo ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſly to doe it; and I remember, that I was troub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led enough, at it. For, in fine, thoſe things cannot be done, without a bodie's euen annihilating her ſelfe, who doth them; but yet howſoeuer, I did, what you commanded me, the beſt I could; and therefore I need not take care, to repeate it, ſo par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>particularly, now. Only I will declare thus much, that, if there were no other thing, euen in Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uen, to giue delight, and guſt, to our ſight, but only the exceſſiue beautie of Glorifyed Bodies, that felicity would be euen immenſe; but eſpeci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally, to behold that moſt Sacred Humanitie of Ieſus Chriſt our Lord, muſt be matter of incompa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rable Glorie. For, ſince the Maieſtie thereof, is diſcouered to be ſo great, whenſoeuer it is repre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſented to vs heer, according to that proportion, where of our miſerie, in this mortall life of ours, is capable; what, doe we thinke it will then oc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>curr
<pb n="389" facs="tcp:100776:231"/>
to be, when we ſhall ſo very entirely be ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitted, to enjoy ſo high a Good. This Viſion, though it be Imaginarie, (or repreſenting it ſelf, by way of Mentall Image, to the Imagination) was neuer ſeen by me, by theſe eyes of my Bodie; nor indeed, was anie other Viſion, that I euer had, but only, by the eyes of my Minde. And they, who know theſe things, better then I, affirme, that the former Viſion, is of a higher, &amp; more perfect kind, then this; and this alſo much more, then thoſe others, which are ſeen, by theſe eyes, of Fleſh, and Bloud. For, theſe latter, they ſay, are of the loweſt <note n="*" place="margin">Imagi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nary Vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſions re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſented to, &amp; by the ſenſes are of the lovvest ranke, &amp; moſt ſubiect to danger.</note> kind of all, and wherein the Diuel is able to in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duce &amp; impoſe moſt Illuſions; though yet then, I could not vnderſtand any ſuch matter; but rather deſired, that, when I was to receiue anie Fauour of that kind, it might be ſo, as that I might ſee it, with my corporeall eyes; to the end, that my Ghoſtlie Father, might no longer tell me, that I did but fancie ſuch things. And ſo it hapned alſo to my ſelf, as ſoone as it was paſt (but it was euen, as it were, but at the verie inſtant) that euen my ſelf alſo conceiued, that I did but fancie it indeed; and ſo I was a little troubled ſometimes, for haue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing told my Ghoſtlie Father, as I did; as doubting, whether I had not deceiued him. And now, this was the occaſion of another lamentation of mine; and ſo I went to him againe, and told him of it. Vpon this, he asked me, whether indeed, I had thought ſo, before; and whether I had anie pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe to deceiue him. As for me, I told him, what
<pb n="390" facs="tcp:100776:232"/>
I held to be the truth; I, who (foraſmuch as I am able to vnderſtand of my ſelf) had no minde at all, to lye; nor intended anie ſuch matter, as that; nor would I, for the whole world, haue told him anie one thing, for another. Now this, did he know very well; and ſo he did his beſt, to quiet me. But I had ſo great auerſion from going to giue him trouble with theſe things, that I know not, how the Diuel could make me, for my grea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter torment, conceiue, that I had feigned, in what I had ſayd.</p>
            <p>But our Lord made ſuch haſt to doe me a Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uour, and to vnfold this truth to me, that I grew quickly, to be out of all doubt, whether it were a thing of fancie, or no; and ſince that time, I ſee my follie very clearly. For though I ſhould employ manie yeares, in conceiuing, how I might be able, to figure a thing of ſo extreame beautie, I ſhould neuer haue either the power, or the witt, to doe it; for, it did farre exceed all that, which can poſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſibly be imagined in this world, by the verie clearnes, and brightnes thereof. Nor yet is it anie ſuch brightnes, as dazles; but a brightnes, which is accompanied, with a moſt ſweet kind of beau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie; a brightnes, I ſay, there is infuſed, which giues extreame delight to the ſight, and which is farre from wearying it; nor doth the light there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of, alſo offend, whereby we ſee this obiect of ſo Diuine Beautie. This, I ſay, is a light, ſo very differ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ent from all that, of this inferiour world, that euen the brightnes of the Sunne it ſelf, which we
<pb n="391" facs="tcp:100776:232"/>
ſee, is ſo dimme, and dull a thing, in compariſon of that claritie, and light, which is repreſented to our ſight, by this meanes, that euen the eyes would ſearce open themſelues, to behold it. For it is, as if it were a moſt pure water, running all vpon Chriſtall, with the Sunne reflecting vpon it, and ſtriking through it; in compariſon of ſome other, which were of a muddie kind, and in a clowdie day; and which were running alſo vpon earth. Not yet, that there is anie Sunne repreſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted in it; nor is that Light, like the Light of the Sunne; for, in fine, this Light of the Viſion, ſeemes a very naturall Light; whereas the other is but a kind of artificiall thing, in compariſon thereof. This is a Light, which neuer ſets; but as it is euer Light, ſo is there nothing, which can diſturbe it; but in fine, it is a thing of ſuch a kind, as that, how ſublime ſoeuer the vnderſtanding of anie Crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture might be, he would neuer, in all the dayes of his life, be able to conceiue rightly, what kind of thing it were. And it pleaſes Almightie God, to ſet it before vs, ſo very ſpeedily, that we cannot open our eyes ſo ſoone, if that were needfull for the ſeeing it; but it helpes vs indeed, no more, in this caſe, to haue them open, then ſhut. For, whenſoeuer our Lord is pleaſed, we ſee it, euen whether we will, or no. Not is there anie diſtrac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion in the world, which may be able, to diuert vs from it; nor is there anie power, which can reſiſt it; nor is there alſo, on the other ſide, anie manner of care, and diligence, which may ſuffice
<pb n="392" facs="tcp:100776:233"/>
to procure it; and I haue had good experience of this, as I ſhall find a fitt time to declare.</p>
            <p>But that, which I would faine relate now, is the manner, how our Bleſſed Lord is pleaſed to ſhew himſelf, by theſe Viſions. I ſay not, that I will declare, in what ſort, this ſo ſtrong a light may be able to conuey it ſelf, into the inward ſenſe, and to imprint ſo exact, and cleare an Image, vpon the Vnderſtanding, as to make it directly ſeem, to be very there; for, this point be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>longs to ſuch, as are learned; and our Lord hath not been pleaſed, to giue me to comprehend the manner of it; and, in myſelf, I am ſo very igno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rant, and of ſo groſſe an Vnderſtanding, that, howſoeuer men haue endeauoured much, to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clare it to me, I haue not yet, been able to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceaue the way, and manner of it. And this is very certaine, that, howſoeuer it may ſeem to your Reuerence, that my Vnderſtanding is liuelie, and quick, yet there is really no ſuch thing; and I haue found, what I am about to ſay, to be true, by the experience of manie particulars; that, namely, it embraces, and comprehends no more; then iuſt that verie thing, vpon which they will haue it feed. Yea and ſometimes, he, who was my Confeſſarius, would be euen amazed, at my ig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>norances, in manie kinds; and he neuer made me vnderſtand. nor did I, indeed, deſire to know, how Almightie God did this; or how this could be; nor did I aske him about it. Though yet, as I haue ſayd, I treated manie yeares, with men of
<pb n="393" facs="tcp:100776:233"/>
great learning, to know, whether this, or that, were a Sinne, or no; for in this, I was not want<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing; but as for the reſt, I then had no need, to ſtand thinking of more, then that Almightie God was the Authour of all; and I ſaw, that I was now, not to wonder at aniething, but only to conſider, how manie reaſons I had, to praiſe him. Nay, the things, which carried difficultie with them, did breed deuotion, in me; and the more difficultie, the more deuotion. But I will therefore now, declare that, which I am come to vnder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtand, by experience; namely, how our Bleſſed Lord doth this; and your Reuerence will expreſſe it better, and will vnfold all that, which you may find obſcure, and I, not know, how to deliuer.</p>
            <p>It ſeemed to me, indeed, in ſome reſpects, that it was an Image, or diſtinct repreſentation, which I ſaw; but, in manie other; no; but rather, that it was Chriſt our Lord himſelf; conſidering the ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſiue kind of claritie, wherewith he vouchſaf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, to impart himſelf to me. And yet ſometimes, it was after ſo vndiſtinct a manner; that me thought, it was a Repreſentation, or Image; but yet ſtill, not like thoſe deſignes, and draughts, or Pictures of things, which are made heer, how perfect ſoeuer they may be; for I haue ſeen, both very manie, and very good ones, of this kind. But it is a very great impertinencie, to conceiue, that anie one of them, comes home, to the life; but, how well ſoeuer they be drawne, they will neuer yet ariue to reach the Naturall in all reſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pects;
<pb n="394" facs="tcp:100776:234"/>
for, in fine, the one is aliue, and the other, is dead But, let vs lay this aſide, though yet the relation of one, to the other, hold very well. And ſtill I ſay not, that I frame a Compariſon, between Chriſt our Lord himſelf, and that, which I ſayd I ſaw; for, Compariſons neuer agree ſo perfectly, and entirely, as theſe two things did. But the truth is, that there is the ſame difference, in what I ſaw, from anie Image, which there is between a thing, that liues, and a thing, which is painted. And if you will needs haue this, to haue been an Image, I am ſure, it was a liuing Image, and not a dead man, but Chriſt aliue; and it giues me alſo to vnderſtand, that he is both God, &amp; Man; and that, not ſo as he was layd in the Sepulcher, but as he was afterwards, in the Reſurrection. And ſometimes, he comes with ſuch an immenſe kind of Maieſtie, that no Creature can be able to doubt, but that it is our verie Lord himſelf; and eſpecially, after my receauing the Bleſſed Sacra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment; for, then we know well, that he is there, ſince we vnderſtand it by Faith; and this ſeemes, to be the ſame Lord, with that. An he ſhewes himſelf then, for ſo true, and entire a Lord, of that little houſe, that the whole Soule, ſees her ſelf, to be euen diſſolued, conſumed, and annihilated, in Chriſt our Lord.</p>
            <p>Deare IESVS! and how ſhould one be able, to giue the heigth of that Maieſtie, to be vnderſtood, wherewith thou comeſt to ſhew thy ſelf, in theſe occaſions? and how abſolutly doth the Soule re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolue,
<pb n="395" facs="tcp:100776:234"/>
that thou art the Lord of the whole world, and of the Heauens; and of a thouſand worlds; and of innumerable Heauens, and worlds, which thou cauſt create; conſidering that high Maieſtie, with which thou repreſenteſt thy ſelf, to her? For then ſhe knowes, that all this world is iuſt no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing, in reſpect of that, whereof thou deſerueſt to haue dominion. Heer, O my IESVS, doth the Soule ſee very clearly, that it is but a beggarlie kind of power, which the Diuels haue, in com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pariſon of thine; and how he, who is ſo happie, as to pleaſe thee, may tread all the power of Hell, vnder his feet. Heer the Soule findes the reaſon, which the Diuels had, to tremble, when thou didſt deſcend to <hi>Limbus Patrum;</hi> and how they would haue wiſhed, to haue been rather, in thou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſands of other, and lower Hells, then to haue en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dured the ſight of ſo high a Maieſtie, as thine. But I perceiue, that thou art heer, diſpoſed, to let our Soules ſee, how potent thou art; and how great, the power of thy moſt Sacred Humanitie is, when it is accompanied by thy Diuinitie. <note n="*" place="margin">The great effects of an admi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rable, and moſt ſublime Viſion.</note> Heer is it well repreſented, what kind of thing, the Day of Iudgement will be, where we ſhall ſee the mightie Maieſtie of this King; and behold his great rigour, towards the wicked. Heer, is true Humilitie layd vp, and left in the Soule, by ſeeing her owne miſerie, whereof now ſhe can be igno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rant no longer. Heer, that confuſion, and true repentance for Sinne; where, euen when ſhe is ſeeing, how greatly our Lord ſhewes her his loue,
<pb n="396" facs="tcp:100776:235"/>
yet knowes ſhe not, where to diſpoſe of her ſelf, but is, as it were, euen annihilated, outright. I ſay, this kind of Viſion, is of ſo exceſſiue power, and ſtrength, when our Lord is pleaſed to ſhew a Soule ſo eminent a portion of his Maieſtie, and greatnes, by it, that I hold it for an impoſſible thing, (vnleſſe our Lord ſhould be pleaſed to aſſiſt her, by making her remaine in Rapt, and Extaſis, and ſo to looſe the Viſion of that Diuine preſence, by the act of enioying) that anie mortall Creature, ſhould be able to endure it, at the preſent; though yet afterward, it is no impoſſible thing, to forget it. And yet, ſtill, this can not be wholy forgotten; in regard, that that Maieſtie, and Beautie, is ſo very deeply imprinted there; but only, when our Lord is pleaſed, that the Soule ſhall ſuffer ſome ſuch great kind of drynes, and ſolitude, as I will declare afterward; for then it ſeemes, that euen one forgets Almightie God himſelf. But howſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>euer, the Soule is growne now to be clearly, ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther kind of thing, then what ſhe was before; and is alwaies, as it were, euen ſteeped, and ba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thed, in Almightie God; and there ſeemes, in my opinion, to be a new, and more liuelie kind of Loue, communicated to her, in a very high degree. For, though that kind of Viſion aforeſayd (which I declared, to repreſent Almightie God, without anie Image) be a thing more ſublime, and high, in it ſelf, yet, for the making it continue long, in our memorie, and to entertaine, and keep our thoughts well employed, ſo great is the weaknes
<pb n="397" facs="tcp:100776:235"/>
of our condition, that it makes very much to our purpoſe, when ſo Diuine a Preſence, as that, of our Bleſſed Lord, is repreſented, and lodged, in the Imaginatiue part of our Minde. And there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore, theſe two kinds of Viſions, are wont to come alwaies, togeather. And indeed, it is thus, that they come. For, the excellencie, and beautie, and glorie, of the moſt Holie Humanitie of Chriſt our Lord, is beheld, with the eyes of the Soule. And by that other way, which is now declared, we grow to be giuen to vnderſtand, that he is God; and powerfull; yea and omni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>potent; and that he commands, and gouernes all things; and that his loue, doth euen repleniſh them all.</p>
            <p>This kind of Viſion, is to be valued, at a very high rate; and it is alſo, in my opinion, without danger; for, in fine, it is diſcerned by the effects, that the Diuel hath no power at all, heerin. And yet it is true, that three, or foure ſeuerall times, he hath had a minde, to repreſent our Lord himſelf to me, after this manner; that is to ſay, by way of ſuch a falſe kind of repreſentation. For, he takes the forme of Fleſh; but it comes not within the compaſſe of his power, to counterfeit it, with anie ſuch kind of glorie, as when it is indeed of Al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mightie God. The Diuel is wont to make certaine repreſentations, for the deſtroying of ſome true Viſion, which the Soule hath ſeen; but ſo alſo doth ſhe her beſt, to reſiſt the vexations, which he giues her; though then, ſhe be ſo diſquieted, and diſor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dered,
<pb n="398" facs="tcp:100776:236"/>
euen by this verie diligence, that ſhe looſes that deuotion, and guſt, which ſhe had before; and remaines alſo, without anie Prayer at all. This hapned to me, three, or foure times, in the beginning, as I was ſaying. But this, of the falſe Viſion, is ſo very different a kind of thing, from the other, that, whoſoeuer hath ariued to the onlie Prayer of Quiet, will, I beleiue, vnderſtand this buſines, by the verie effects, which haue been ſpoken of, in that Diſcourſe, which concer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nes thoſe <hi>VVords,</hi> or <hi>Speeches,</hi> which ſometimes are imparted to, and imprinted in, the Soule. And I hold this aſſertion to be a moſt certaine thing; and vnleſſe a Soule ſhould haue, euen a kind of minde, to be abuſed, and deceiued, I beleiue, the Diuel will not be able to doe it, if ſhe walke with humilitie, and ſimplicitie; that is; with ſinceritie of minde.</p>
            <p>Whoſoeuer, I ſay, hath receiued anie true Vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion from Almightie God, will inſtantly perceiue, and iudge <note n="*" place="margin">The differe<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ce is eaſily found, both be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tvveen a true Vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion, and a falſe; and be<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>tvveen a true Viſion, and a Fancy.</note> of another, which is contrarie, and falſe; for, though anie ſuch falſe one, may beginne, to giue a kind of Regalo, and guſt, yet the Soule will ſhake that off; and beſides, in my opinion, the guſt will be, euen different, in it ſelf; and, not carrying ſo much, as an apparance of a Loue, which is pure, and chaſt, it growes to be ſoone diſcouered, from whence it comes. So that, whereſoeuer there is anie experience, the Diuel will not be able, to doe anie Soule hurt, in this kind.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="399" facs="tcp:100776:236"/>
But now, that all this kind of Viſion, ſhould be be but a meer Imagination, or conceipt, is clearly, and entirely, an impoſſible thing; and hath no colour at all. For, the high beautie, and fairenes, of one onlie hand, doth abſolutly outſtripp all Imagination. And beſides, without our euer haue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing thought of anie ſuch obiect, or reflecting vpon anie one of this kind, to ſee ſuch things preſent, and all at an inſtant, which could neuer haue been ſo fitted, and adiuſted, by the Imagination of man (in regard, that it is ſo mightily of a ſupe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riour kind, as I haue ſayd, from that, which we are able to comprehend in this world) it muſt alſo be impoſſible, for the aforeſayd reaſon. And yet, though we could doe ſomewhat of this kind (not withſtanding all that, which is ſayd) it would yet, not be poſſibly done, vpon this other reaſon, which I will now declare. For, if we ſhould re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſent anie ſuch thing, in the ſtrength of our owne Vnderſtanding (beſides, that it would not haue anie ſuch great operation, as this true Viſion hath; nor indeed would it, in effect, haue anie at all) it would be at the moſt, but as one, who would very faine grow to ſleep; whereas yet, he ſhould, indeed, be awake; becauſe he cannot yet fall aſleep. But if he deſire to ſleep, and haue need of it, and withall, haue anie infirmitie, or weaknes, in his head, which forbidds it, he yet procures, of himſelfe, to get into a ſlumber, and vſes all his di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligences, in order to that end; and ſometimes, he euen half thinkes, that he doth ſomewhat. But
<pb n="400" facs="tcp:100776:237"/>
ſtill, if, in verie deed, it be not true, and reall ſleep, it will not ſuſtaine him, nor giue ſtrength to his Head; Nay rather, it will, ſometimes, fall out to be ſo much the more idle. And iuſt ſo, is it alſo partly, in this caſe; for then, will the Soule grow emptie, and idle, and not be ſuſtained, and ſtrong, but rather diſordered, and diſguſted; whereas, in the other former caſe of ours, it is paſt anie power of mine, to declare, what treaſures are acquired; when not only the Soule is enriched, but euen the Bodie alſo it ſelf, gets temper, and health.</p>
            <p>Now, this reaſon, with others, did I alleadge, when they told me, ſometimes, that thoſe things were of the Diuel; and, at other times, that I did but fancie them to my ſelf. And this hapned often to me, and I would alſo, be bringing certaine Compariſons, the beſt I could; and our Lord made me light vpon them; but yet all ſerued me ſtill, to little purpoſe; for, there being very holie perſons, in that place, and I being euen miſerie it ſelf, in compariſon of them, and our Lord not guiding them, by this way, they would inſtantly be growing into feare, that my ſinnes, in all appa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rance, were the meanes, to produce thoſe effects; and ſo, it went, vp, and downe, from one to ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, in ſuch ſort, as that they came to be acquain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted, with theſe ſecrets of mine; though, for my part, I diſcouered them to no Creature, but only to my Ghoſtlie Father; or to ſuch, as he directed me, to impart them.</p>
            <p>But I remember, I ſayd to them once, that if
<pb n="401" facs="tcp:100776:237"/>
they, who told me theſe things, had related to me, that ſome perſon, with whome I had been much acquainted, and with whome I had ſpoken but very then, had not yet, been that perſon in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed, but that I had only fancyed it to my ſelf, and that they knew it for certaine; I ſhould with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out all doubt, haue much more eaſily beleiued them, then euen the verie thing, which I ſaw. But <note n="*" place="margin">A plaine de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monſtra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion.</note> yet now, on the other ſide, if that perſon had left certaine Iewells with me, and that they re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mained ſtill, in my hands, as pawnes of the great loue he bore me, and that formerly I had been the owner of no ſuch Iewells, whereas now I ſaw, I was rich, who before, had been ſo poore, I ſhould then, not be able to beleiue them, euen though I deſired it, eſpecially, when I could ſhew theſe Iewells of mine, to others. For euerie bodie knew me well enough, and they ſaw clearly, that my Soule, was growne to be another kind of thing, then before; and ſo I told mine owne Ghoſtlie Father. For, the difference was come to be great, in manie kinds, and not in anie doubtfull, or diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guiſeable manner; but ſo, as that all Creatures might diſcerne it clearly. And I remember, alſo, that I was wont to ſay, that I could not tell, how to beleiue, that the Diuel would doe this, to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiue me; and how, ſince he would be glad to carrie me away with him to Hell, he could ſerue himſelf of this meanes, which was ſo very con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trarie to his owne end; Namely, to roote-out Vice, and to plant Vertue, and ſtrength of Spirit,
<pb n="402" facs="tcp:100776:238"/>
in place thereof; for I found, and that very clearly, that I grew, once, at an inſtant, to be wholy ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther Creature, then I was before.</p>
            <p>My Ghoſtlie Father, as I was ſaying, was a Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther <hi>of the Societie of</hi> IESVS, and a very holie man; and he alſo made the ſame anſwer to others, as I came to vnderſtand afterward. He was a perſon of much diſcretion, and of great humilitie; but yet, that humilitie of his, grew to coſt me a great deale of trouble. For, though he were a man of much learning, and beſides, of great Prayer, yet put he <note n="*" place="margin">In or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der to the guideing of others, a Direc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tour may eaſily haue too meane an opt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion of himſelfe.</note> no truſt at all, in himſelf; and, our Lord not guiding his Soule by this way, he was ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iect to much trouble with me, in ſeueral kinds. And afterward I came to know, that they wiſhed him to take heed of me, and to be carefull, leaſt the Diuel ſhould deceiue him, by making him beleiue anie part of that, which I ſhould tell him; and to this purpoſe, they would be alleadging the examples of ſome others, to him. All this gaue me vexation enough; and, by degrees, I came ſo farre, as to feare, that I ſhould grow ſcarce able, to find anie bodie, who would heare my Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſſions; but that euerie one would be flying from me, in this kind. So that, for my part, I did no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing but weepe; and it was the prouidence of Al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mightie God, that this Father, would yet ſtill continue to heare me. But indeed, he was ſo great a Seruant of our Lord, that there was no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing which he would; or ſuffer, or his ſake; and ſo he would ſtill be aduiſing me, to be ſure, not
<pb n="403" facs="tcp:100776:238"/>
to offend Almightie God; nor to ſwarue from the directions, which he gaue me; and that I ſhould not feare, that he would faile me; and ſtill he would alſo be animating, and quieting me; and euer he would, in particular, command me, that I ſhould conceale nothing from him; which I alwayes obſerued; and I doing thus, he would alwaies tell me, that the Diuel would be able, to doe me no hurt; but rather, that our Bleſſed Lord would not faile, to draw good, out of that ill, which the Diuel would be attempting, to doe my Soule. This Soule of mine, did I procure to perfect, to the vttermoſt of my power; and, as for my Ghoſtlie Father, I did (through the feare of Il<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>luſions, wherein I was) obey him, in all things; though yet, but after an imperfect manner. But he had trouble enough with me, when I confeſſed my ſelf to him, in theſe difficult times, which laſted aboue the ſpace of three whole yeares; for, in the great perſecutions, which I had, and in manie things, wherein our Lord permitted, that the world ſhould make ill iudgements of me, (and manie of them, without anie fault of mine) I would euer be coming with them, to him; and he was blamed, in reſpect of me; whereas yet he was in no fault at all. I thinke it would haue been wholy impoſſible, that he ſhould haue en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dured it, ſo long, if he had not been a man of much ſanctitie; but our Lord did animate him greatly, and enable him to endure ſo very much. For he was ſtill, to make anſwer to all them, who
<pb n="404" facs="tcp:100776:239"/>
held me to be a loſt Soule; but they beleiued him not; and on the other ſide, he was alſo to take care, to quiet me, and to recouer me out of that feare, wherein I was, by frighting me, with a greater; and beſides, he was alſo to endeauour to ſatisfye me, in another reſpect; in regard, that, vpon euerie Viſion, which was new to me, our Lord was pleaſed to permit, that afterward I ſhould be ſubiect, to very great feares. Now, as all this proceeded, both from my being, and haue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing been, a very great Sinner: ſo yet would he comfort me ſtill, with much pietye, and compaſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion. But yet ſtill, if he had confided as much in himſelf, as he might well haue done, I had not ſuffered ſo much. For, our Lord gaue him to vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtand the truth, in all things; and I am perſwa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded, that the verie Sacrament of Pennance, which I frequented with him, gaue him light.</p>
            <p>Thoſe other Seruants of Almightie God, who could not make themſelues ſure of my well-do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, were wont to be very conuerſant with me. And when I would caſually be ſpeaking, now, and then, of ſome things, they would be vnder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtanding them, after a different manner. Now <note n="*" place="margin">This Saint vvas hugely vexed, by the inſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tisfaction vvhich she re<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ceiued from many Spiritu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>all men.</note> there was one of theſe, whome I particularly loued; for, my Soule was infinitly obliged to him; and he was a very holie man. For my part, I was extreamly troubled, to ſee, that I could not make my ſelf be vnderſtood rightly, by him, whilſt he alſo, on the other ſide, did extraordinarily deſire my good; and that our Lord might once vouch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſafe,
<pb n="405" facs="tcp:100776:239"/>
to giue me light. And ſo, when I would be relating ſome things to them, without much re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flection vpon what I ſayd, it would ſeem to them, to be a ſigne of little humilitie, in me; and as ſoone, as afterward, they diſcerned me, to com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mit anie one ſingle fault (whereas they might very eaſily haue diſcerned manie) all grew in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtantly to be condemned by them. Sometimes, they would be asking me certaine queſtions; and I would anſwer them, with plainenes, and with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out much reſeruation, yea or euen reflection; and then, forſooth, they would be thinking, that I had a minde to teach them; and that I held my ſelf, for ſome ſhrewd woeman; and vpon this, would they all, goe inſtantly to my Ghoſtlie Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther; for certainly, they deſired my good; but yet then, would he grow, to chide me. And this, laſted a long time, I being afflicted manie wayes, on the one ſide; and yet, being, on the other, ſo viſited by the Fauours of out Bleſſed Lord, as I found my ſelfe to be, I was indeed very well able, to endure that other miſerye.</p>
            <p>And now I relate all this, to the end, that it may the better be vnderſtood, how very great a troub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>le it is, not to haue ſome ſuch perſon at hand, as hath experience, in the way of Spirit. So that re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally, if our Bleſſed Lord, had not fauoured me, in ſuch ſort, as he did, I know not what would haue become of me, at length; ſince there were occaſions enow, to haue put me, euen out of my witts; and ſometimes, I ſaw my ſelf in ſuch tear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mes,
<pb n="406" facs="tcp:100776:240"/>
that I knew not, what to doe, but only, to lift-vp mine eyes, to our Lord. For, as the contra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diction, and oppoſition of ſuch, as were good, and worthie men, towards a poore, weake, and wicked woeman, like my ſelf, and ſo timorous, as I alſo was, may, perhaps, ſeem, to be ſcarce worth the relating: ſo yet, I hauing paſſed through very manie, and great troubles, in this life of mine, I haue found this laſt, to haue been of the greateſt. I humbly beſeech our Bleſſed Lord, that I may haue been able, to doe his Diuine Maieſtie, ſome little Seruice, euen in this; for that they, who accuſed, and condemned me, did him Seruice in it, I am very ſure; and that it all, hath turned to my good.</p>

            <p>I Haue ſwarued very much, from my purpoſe; for I pretended to declare the reaſsons, whereby to proue, that the thing, whereof I ſpoke, was not matter of Imagination; for, how ſhould we be
<pb n="407" facs="tcp:100776:240"/>
able, by meanes of anie endeauour, or ſtudie of ours, to repreſent the Humanitie of Chriſt our Lord, to our ſelues; and to goe ordering, and diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſing of his great beautie, for which there would be need of a large time, if we would pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tend, to frame anie thing, which ſhould be like it. Well may one repreſent it, to his owne Ima<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gination; and ſtand looking vpon it, for ſome time; and conſider his ſhape, and complexion; and ſo goe perfecting it, by little and little; and recommending that Image ouer to his Memorie; for, who can take this power, from the minde? And thus much am I able to doe, by the ſtrength of mine owne Vnderſtanding; But in that other, whereof we were ſpeaking, there is no meanes for this; for we muſt behold that, iuſt then, when our Lord is pleaſed, to repreſent it to vs; and iuſt alſo, what he will, &amp; how he will; Nor is there, in this caſe, anie meanes, either to add, or diminiſh anie thing, how much ſoeuer we may endeauour it, either towards the ſeeing it, or forbearing to ſee it, when we will. For, <note n="*" place="margin">This is very fitt to be knovvne</note> whe<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ſoeuer we ſhall diſpoſe our ſelues, to fix our ſight faſt, vpon beholding anie particular thing, the ſight of Chriſt our Lord is inſtantly loſt.

And I finding, that he
<pb n="408" facs="tcp:100776:241"/>
would be ſpeaking to me; and I, the while, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>holding that extreame beautie of his, and obſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uing the ſuauitie, with which he vttered thoſe words, by that moſt Louelie, and Diuine mouth; and ſometimes alſo, with rigour; whilſt I, in the meane time, had a kind of extreame deſire, to ſee the colour of thoſe eyes, and the ſize, and ſhape, which they had; to the end, that I might be able to relate the ſame, to my Ghoſtlie Father, I could neuer yet, obtaine to ſee them; and my diligence would not ſerue to procure it, but the Viſion was rather abſolutly loſt. And though <note n="*" place="margin">
                  <hi>This is a true</hi> Fortiter ſed Sua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uiter.</note> it be very true, that ſometimes, I ſee, he lookes vpon me, with a kind of ſweetnes, and compaſſion; yet this ſpectacle is of ſo mightie a force, that the Soule is not able to endure it, but remaines in ſo high a Rapt, that, to the end ſhe may the better enioy the whole, ſhe wholy looſes the ſight of this moſt beautifull obiect. So that, in fine, and in or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der to this end, it ſerues to little purpoſe, either to will, or not to will, anie thing heer; and it growes to be cleare enough, that our Lord lookes for nothing, in theſe caſes, but for humilitie, and confuſion of our ſelues; and for a minde, to take that, which is giuen; and to praiſe him, who is pleaſed to impart it. And it holds, in all true Vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſions, without exception, that a Creature can doe nothing at all, either towards the more, or the leſſe; and that all our diligences, put togeather, are neither able to doe anie thing, nor vndoe; for, our Lord will haue vs ſee, very clearly, that
<pb n="409" facs="tcp:100776:241"/>
this is no worke of ours, but only of his Diuine Maieſtie; and ſo, as that we are little moued, to be the prouder, by them; but they rather make vs more timorous, and more humble; whilſt we find, that as our Lord depriues vs of a power, to ſee that, which we deſire, ſo he can alſo, take theſe Fauours, yea and his grace, from vs too, in ſuch ſort, as that we may be vtterly loſt. We muſt therefore be, alwaies, walking on, with feare, as long as we ſhall liue heer, in this banniſhment.</p>
            <p>Our Lord hath almoſt euer, repreſented him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf to me, as after his <note n="*" place="margin">This Saint vvas moſt ſtrangely famili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>arly, and ſuperna<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turally viſited by our B Lord.</note> Reſurrection. He hath alſo done it ſometimes, in the Sacred Hoaſt. Sometimes, for ſtrengthning me, when I chance to be in tribulation, he ſhewes me his Wounds. And ſometimes alſo he vouchſafes that I ſhould ſee him iuſt ſo, as he was vpon the Croſſe; and ſometimes, as in the Garden; yea and alſo, ſome ſeldome times, with his Crowne of Thornes, vpon his Head; and at other times, carrying his Croſſe. Yet this, as I was ſaying, vſes to occurr, but in the time of ſome neceſſitie, either of mine owne, or of others, but yet alwaies, as a Glori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fyed Bodie. And I haue ſuffered affronts, and vexations enow, in declaring theſe things; and haue growne ſubiect thereby, to great perſecu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions, and feares. They made themſelues ſo very ſure, that all this, was the Diuel, that there wanted not certaine perſons, who wiſhed, that I might be Exorcifed, for that purpoſe; yet this gaue me very little trouble. But the thing, which I felt, in
<pb n="410" facs="tcp:100776:242"/>
good earneſt, was either, when my Ghoſtlie Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers were afrayd to heare my Confeſſions, or els, when I came to know, that they were told tales. But yet ſtill, vpon the whole matter, I know not how to make my ſelf ſorrie, for hauing ſeen theſe Celeſtiall Viſions; nor would I giue anie one of them all, for all the greatneſſes, and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lights, of this whole world; for I euer held theſe things, to be a very great Fauour, of our Lord; and I eſteem them, to be an exceſſiue kind of treaſure; yea and our Lord himſelf hath aſſured me thereof, manie times. Withall, I found my ſelf grow heerby, to loue his Diuine Maieſtie very much; and ſo, to him, would I euer be going to complaine, of all the troubles I had; and I alwayes came out of Prayer, both with comfort, and ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dition of ſtrength. As for them, I would not pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſume, to contradict them; for I ſaw, it made things worſe, as ſeeming to them, that it was want of humilitie, in me; but I communicated them ſtill, to my Ghoſtlie Father; and whenſoeuer he found me afflicted, he was carefull, that I ſhould receaue much comfort, from him.</p>
            <p>As my Viſions grew-on to encreaſe, one of them, who aſſiſted me before, who was a man, that vſed to Confeſſe me ſometimes, (when the Sub-Rectour was not in the way, to heare me) beganne to tell me, how it was moſt certaine, that it was the Diuel; and then, they grew to <note n="*" place="margin">A ſtrange Taske, vvhich vvas put, even by holy men, upon this Saint.</note> command me (ſince there was no other meanes, to reſiſt him) that I ſhould alwaies be Croſſing,
<pb n="411" facs="tcp:100776:242"/>
and bleſſing my ſelf, when I ſhould chance to ſee anie Viſion; and that I ſhould vſe ſome exteriour action, or ſigne of ſcorne, that ſo he might be ſure, I held him certainly, to be the Diuel; and that, perhaps, by this meanes, he would come no more; but that yet, I ſhould be afrayd of nothing, becauſe God would keep me ſtill, and would alſo take that temptation from me. Now, this was painefull enough to me; for, conſidering that I could not poſſibly beleiue, but that it was Almightie God, this proceeding was very terrible for me to vndergoe. Nor was it alſo poſſible for me, as of my ſelfe, to deſire, that it might be taken from me; but yet, in fine, I performed all thoſe acts, which they commanded; and I beſought our Bleſſed Lord, with much inſtance, to free me from it; and I did it, with abundance of teares. I begged it alſo, by the prayers of S. Peter, and S. Paul; in regard, that I hauing had the firſt of all my Viſions, vpon the Day of their Feſtiuitie, our Lord himſelf vouchſafed to tell me, that they would ſo take care of me, as that I might not be deceiued. And accordingly, I haue often ſeen (and that very clearly, though yet not by way of anie Imaginarie Viſion, or repreſented perſon) theſe two Glorious Saints, who are ſo much my good Patrons, ſtanding by me, vpon my left hand; and that, after a very euident manner. But now, this order of thoſe others, to make ſignes of contempt, and ſcorne, whenſoeuer I had that Viſion of our Bleſſed Lord, did put me to a mightie kind of
<pb n="412" facs="tcp:100776:243"/>
paine; for, when I ſaw him preſent, before mine eyes, it was impoſſible for me to beleiue, that it was the Diuel, though they ſhould haue torne me into a thouſand peices, to make me doe it; and therefore, it was a ſtrange kind of Pennance, which they put vpon me. But now, to the end that I might not be ſo perpetually Croſſing my ſelf, I tooke a Croſſe into my hands; and this, I did, in effect, alwaies; but, indeed, I vſed not thoſe ſignes of ſcorne, ſo very often; for, that af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flicted me, too much. For I well remembred the affronts, &amp; iniuries, which the Iewes had put vpon our Lord; &amp; ſo I humbly beſought him, to pardon me, if I did the like, ſince I did it, by way of Obe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dience, to them, whome he had appointed, in his owne place; and I prayed him, not to lay it to my charge, ſince they were the perſons, whome him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf had placed in his Church. He told me then, that I ſhould not be troubled at it; and, that I did well, in obeying them; and, that he would bring them, at length, to vnderſtand the truth. But when they for bad me to vſe Prayer, me thought our Lord was growne angrie at it; yea and he bad me tell them, that this was a verie tyran<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ie in them; and he gaue me alſo wayes, how to make me know, that this was not a worke of the Diuel; and I will touch vpon ſome one of them, afterward.</p>
            <p>When once I had the Croſſe in my hand, which was at the end of my Roſarie, he tooke the ſame, into his; and when he gaue it me againe, it conſiſted of foure great Stones, incomparably
<pb n="413" facs="tcp:100776:243"/>
more pretious, then Diamonds; for, there is no ſuch thing, in this world, as that, which goes in the Supernaturall way; and a Diamond, is but an imperfect, and counterfeit kind of Stone, in compariſon of thoſe others, whereof I ſpeake. Now, theſe Stones had the Fiue Wounds of our Bleſſed Lord, in them, after a moſt curious make<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing; and he told me, that I ſhould ſee him, iuſt ſo, from that time forward; and ſo I did; and now, I no longer ſaw the wood, whereof the Croſſe was made, but only theſe pretious Stones; and yet ſo, as that no other ſaw them, but my ſelf.</p>
            <p>When <note n="*" place="margin">The more she vvas diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>counte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nanced, euen by good men, ſo much the more highly vvas she fauoured by our Lord.</note> they beganne to command me, to make theſe tryals, or proofes, and to vſe reſiſtance to thoſe Fauours, they grew on, to a higher en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>creaſe; for, though I might haue a minde to diuert my ſelf, yet I neuer was out of Prayer; nay, me thinkes, I was in Prayer, euen whilſt I ſlept; for heer, all was growing-on, and growing-vp, in the loue of our Bleſſed Lord; and the making alſo of a pittifull kind of complaints, which I vt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tered to him; and my not being able to endure it; nor was it in my power (though I had deſired it; and leaſt of all, when I procured it) to giue ouer, my thinking vpon him. But yet ſtill, I obeyed them, as well, as I could; though yet I were able to doe little, or nothing therein. Now, our Lord did neuer free me, from obeying them; but, how<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſoeuer it be true, that he commanded me, to doe as they bad me, he yet gaue me aſſurance other<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe, yea and inſtructed me alſo, about what I
<pb n="414" facs="tcp:100776:244"/>
ſhould ſay to them; and the ſame he doth alſo, to this day; and he taught me ſo concluding reaſons, of all things, that they gaue me all ſufficient aſſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rance. And now his Diuine Maieſtie hath be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gunne, very lately, to performe, what he had been pleaſed to promiſe me before; as namely, to aſſure me yet better, that it was he; for there grew in me, ſo great a loue of Almightie God, that I knew not, how it could get into my hart; and it was of a very Supernaturall kind; nor was it I, who pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cured it. I then found my ſelf, euen as it were, to dye, through a deſire, wherein I was, to ſee Al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mightie God; nor could I come to know how I might be able, to ſeeke-out this kind of life, but by the way of death. There came vpon me ſo great impetuoſities, or impulſes of this loue, that, howſoeuer they were not ſo inſupportable, not yet altogeather of ſo high value, as thoſe others were, which I related before, yet knew I not, what to doe with my ſelf; for, nothing could now giue me ſatisfaction; nor was I able, euen to containe my verie ſelf; but really, it was with me, as if my Soule had been directly torne out of my Bodie.</p>
            <p>O moſt admirable kind of artifice of our Lord! what manner of choice, and delicate in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duſtrie, is that, which thou art pleaſed to vſe to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards this miſerable Slaue of thine? For, thou didſt hide thy ſelf from me; and yet withall, didſt euen then, preſle vpon me, ſo very cloſe, with thy loue, by giuing me ſuch a delightfull, and ſauou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rie
<pb n="415" facs="tcp:100776:244"/>
kind of death, as that the Soule, by her good will, would neuer be deliuered, from the ſame. Whoſoeuer hath neuer tryed, and felt, theſe ſo great impetuoſities of Diuine Loue, it is impoſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble, that he ſhould be able, to vnderſtand them; for, this is not a kind of reſtleſnes of the breaſt, or hart, nor anie of that kind of deuotions, which are wont ſometimes, as it were, to ſtop the breath; in ſuch ſort, as that the Soule is not able to containe her ſelf; But, this is an inferiour kind of Prayer, to that; and heerin we are to procure, to remoue ſuch kind of promptitudes, and vehe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mences, as thoſe; and to endeauour, to retire them ſweetly, into themſelues; ſo to appeaſe, and calme the Soule. For, this <note n="*" place="margin">A rare Compa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riſon.</note> is, in ſome ſort, as when little Children cry, and ſobb ſometimes, ſo thick, as that they are euen readie to choake; and when the Nurſe giues them drinke, that exceſſe of their paſſion, and expreſſion, beginnes to ceaſe. And ſo in this caſe alſo, is Reaſon to take the bridle into the hand; for perhaps, the verie naturall con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dition, and conſtitution of the perſon himſelf, may be the thing, which contributes ſomewhat, to this ſtate of minde, at that time. And therefore, let conſideration be vſed, for feare leaſt all ſhould not be perfect; and leaſt a very great part thereof, fall out to haue ſome what of the Senſuall, in it; and let this Child be ſtilled, by ſome Regalo, or other, of Loue, which may induce it, to exerciſe, and expreſſe the loue it ſelf, which he alſo beares, by a moregentle, and ſweet kind of way; and
<pb n="416" facs="tcp:100776:245"/>
not thus, as it were, by going to cuffes. But let them goe retiring that verie loue of theirs, into the more inward part of the Minde; and not ſuffer it to paſſe on, and out, ſo farre, like ſome Pott, <note n="*" place="margin">Still, more &amp; more ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cellent compari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons.</note> which doth firſt, ſo boile vp, and then, ſo boile-ouer, as that the broth, or water, is quite ſpent, and loſt, becauſe no diſcretion was vſed, in the quantitie of wood, or coales, which was put vnder it. And thus, let them procure, to appeaſe, and ſlake the flame, which is fed by that vehe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment fire, with ſweet, and gentle teares, but not with ſuch, as are forced, or painefull, as they are wont to be, which proceed from ſuch a vehe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment kind of ſenſe, as I haue formerly expreſſed; for, ſuch are wont to be of very great inconueni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence, to the Partie. My ſelf vſed to haue ſuch as theſe, in my beginnings; and they would euer leaué my head, in ſuch diſorder, and my Spirit, in ſuch a wearines, and weaknes, that I was not able, ſometimes for a day, yea and ſometimes for more dayes then one, to returne to the exerciſe of Prayer. So that <note n="*" place="margin">An excellent, &amp; most neceſſary Aduiſe.</note> we are to vſe great diſcretion, in thoſe beginnings of ours, to the end, that all may goe on, with much ſweetnes; and that the Spirit may be taught the way of operating, and exerciſing it ſelf inwardly; and we muſt diligently procure, that the exteriour may be auoided, as much as we can. But now, theſe other impetuo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſities, and impulſes, are of a moſt different kind, and condition; for heer, it is not we, who bring<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in the wood; but; the fire ſeemes to be made
<pb n="417" facs="tcp:100776:245"/>
already, to our hands; and inſtantly we are readie, to caſt our ſelues into it, that ſo we may be wholy conſumed. The Soule doth not heer procure, to make her ſelf feele the wound, which growes to be made in her, by the abſence of our Lord; but they driue ſometimes, a ſharp Arrow into the verie liuelieſt part of the hart; in ſuch ſort, as that the Soule her ſelf, is not able to tell diſtinctly, either what ſhe ayles, or euen what ſhe deſires; only ſhe knowes very well, that ſhe deſires, and loues our Lord; and that the ſayd Arrow ſeemes to be toucht, and rubbed-ouer with ſome bitter hearbe, or other, to make her euen hate her ſelf, through the loue of this Lord, and to wiſh, with all her hart, that ſhe might looſe her verie life, for his ſake.</p>
            <p>It is <note n="*" place="margin">A ſtrange mixture of affec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions, but ſuch as God knovves hovv to giue.</note> not in our power to expreſſe, and, much leſſe, to relate with aduantage, the manner, how God approaches, and ariues to ſuch a Soule, as this; or the exceſſiue paine, that he giues; which makes her not to know, euen what to doe, with her ſelf. But yet, this verie paine, is ſuch a ſauou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rie kind of thing withall, that there is no delight in this whole world, which is able to giue her more guſt. For, the Soule, as I was ſaying, would alwaies be very glad, if ſhe might be euer dying, of this Diſeaſe. This paine, and glorie togeather, did carrie my Vnderſtanding into ſuch ſuch diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>traction, and diſorder, that I knew not, how they both, could poſſibly conſiſt togeather. O what a thing it is, to ſee a Soule ſo wounded! for, it is
<pb n="418" facs="tcp:100776:246"/>
iuſt in ſuch ſort, as that one may very well af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firme it, to be wounded; and that, for a moſt ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cellent cauſe; for now ſhe ſees very clearly that ſhe her ſelf did contribute no part of the reaſon, why this Loue ſhould grow; but only it ſeemes, that ſome little Sparke fell downe vpon her, from that immenſe Loue of our Lord, which ſet her, ſo totally, on fire. O how often doe I re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>member that Verſe of <hi>Dauid,</hi> whenſoeuer I find my ſelf in this caſe? <hi>Quem admodum deſider at ceruus ad fontes aquarum, ita deſiderat anima mea ad te, Deus meus; As the Hart deſires to plunge himſelf, into the Springs of vvater: ſo doth my Soule deſire thee, O my God.</hi> For really; me thinkes, that this is euen lit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terally fulfilled then, vpon my ſelf. Whenſoeuer this comes not vpon me, with great violence, me thinkes, I can a little appeaſe my Soule; and at leaſt, ſhe is prouing to find ſome remedie. For, as for the performing of certaine Pennances, ſhe findes not almoſt, in that caſe, for what they ſerue; for, they all are felt by her no more, nor puts it her to anie more paine, to ſhed her bloud, then it would, if ſhe were directly dead. But, in that caſe, ſhe is in earneſt ſearch, after the find<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing-out ſome new wayes, or meanes, how ſhe may be able, to ſuffer much, for the loue of our Lord; but, ſo great is that other former <note n="*" place="margin">This greife is after the rate of the loue.</note> greif of minde, that I know not what Corporall torment can poſſibly be able to drowne it; for, the reme<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>die thereof conſiſts not, in ſuch things, as theſe, ſince theſe medecines, are of too inferiour a kind,
<pb n="419" facs="tcp:100776:246"/>
for the perfect cure of ſo deeply-rooted a Diſeaſe. We receaue, indeed, ſome little eaſe; and the af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fliction paſſes away, to ſome ſmall proportion, by this meanes, and by begging alſo the remedie of her miſerie, at the hands of our Bleſſed Lord; though yet, for her part, ſhe knowes not, how to find anie at all, but only, in death; for, by that meanes, ſhe hopes, entirely to enioy her Souer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>aigne Good. At other times, this paine falls vpon a Soule, ſo feircely, that neither this, nor anie thing els, can be done; for it peirces the whole bodie, through, and through; and neither can the hands, or feet be ſtirred; nay, if we chance to be on foot, and may happen ſometimes to ſit downe, we doe it, like a kind of tranſported Creatures; Nor can the Soule ſo much as breath, but only vtter certaine profound, lamenting ſighes, which yet are not great in ſhew, becauſe ſhe is not able to expreſſe them, though yet they be very great, in themſelues.</p>
            <p>It pleaſed our Bleſſed Lord, that I ſhould haue ſometimes, this following Viſion. I ſaw an An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gell very neer me, towards my left ſide, and he appeared to me, in a Corporeall forme; though yet I am not wont to ſee anie thing of that kind, but very rarely. For, though Angells be repreſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted often to me, it is yet, without my ſeeing them, but only according to that other kind of Viſion, whereof I ſpake before. But, in this Viſion, our Lord was pleaſed, that I ſhould ſee this Angell, after this other manner. He was not great; but
<pb n="420" facs="tcp:100776:247"/>
rather little; yet withall, he was of very much beautie. His face was ſo inflamed, that he appear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed to be of thoſe moſt Superiour Angells, who ſeem to be, all in a fire; and he well might be of them, whome we call <hi>Seraphins;</hi> but as for me, they neuer tell me their names, or rankes: yet howſoeuer, I ſee thereby, that there is ſo great a difference in Heauen, between one Angell, and another, as I am no way able to expreſſe. I ſaw, that he had a long Dart of gold in his hand; and at the end of the iron below, me thought, there was a little fire; and I conceaued, that he thruſt it, ſome ſeuerall times, through my verie Hart, after ſuch a manner, as that it paſſed the verie inwards, of my Bowells; and when he drew it back, me thought, it carried away, as much, as it had touched within me; and left all that, which re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mained, wholy inflamed with a great loue of Al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mightie God. The paine of it, was ſo exceſſiue, that it forced me to vtter thoſe groanes; and the ſuauitie, which that extremitie of paine gaue, was alſo ſo very exceſſiue, that there was no de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiring at all, to be ridd of it; nor can the Soule then, receaue anie contentment at all, in leſſe, then God Almightie himſelf.</p>
            <p>This is no Corporall, but a Spirituall paine; though yet the Bodie doe not faile, to participate ſome part thereof; yea and that, not a little. And it is ſuch a deare, delightfull kind of entercourſe, which paſſes heer, between the Soule, and Al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mightie God, as I beſeech him of his infinit good<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nes,
<pb n="421" facs="tcp:100776:247"/>
that he will giue ſome touch, or taſt of it, to whoſoeuer ſhall beleiue, that I lye. During the time, when I was in this ſtate, I went, vp, and downe that world, like an odd kind of tranſpor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted Foole; neither cared I, either to ſee anie thing, or to ſpeake; but contented my ſelf to conſume, with burning-vp in my paine, which was to be the greateſt glorie for me, that this whole world could affoard.</p>
            <p>In this ſtate was I, now, and then, when our Bleſſed Lord was pleaſed, that theſe ſo verie great Rapts, ſhould come vpon me, which I was not able ſometimes to reſiſt, euen when I was in pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſence of Secular people; and ſo they grew to be publique; and this gaue me a very great deale of trouble. But, ſince the time that I am growne to haue theſe Rapts, I feele not this paine ſo much as that other, whereof I ſpoke before; though yet I cannot call the Chapter to minde. But that paine, is different in manie kindes; and of more value alſo, then this; Or rather, when this beginnes, whereof I am ſpeaking in this place, it ſeemes, that our Lord doth rauiſh, and runne away, as it were, with the Soule, and put her into Extaſis, out of hand; and ſo, no too me is left, for the let<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting her feele anie paine, becauſe inſtantly, the time of enioying, comes in. Let him be Bleſſed for euer, who vouchſafes to impart ſo high Fauours, to a perſon, who correſponds with him ſo ill, for ſo great benefits.</p>

            </argument>
            <p>BVt now, when I came to obſerue, the little, or nothing, which I was able to effect, towards the enduring, of thoſe ſo great impulſes, or im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>petuoſities, whereof I was ſpeaking, I grew to be in great feare of hauing them; for it was paſt anie power of mine, to vnderſtand, how Paine, and Ioy, might be poſſibly able, to conſiſt togeather. That, Corporall paine, and Spirituall ioy, could be compatible, I know well, might be poſſible enough; but, that ſo exceſſiue a Spirituall paine, ſhould be compatible with ſo exceſſiue a Spiritu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>all guſt, did put me half, as it were, out of my witts. And ſtill I did not giue-ouer to procure, to reſiſt the ariuall thereof; though yet I had ſo little power that way, that ſometimes I grew wearie, euen of the endeauour. I defended my ſelf, by the Croſſe, and ſo procured to help my ſelf, by that meanes, from him, who gaue vs all defence, and
<pb n="423" facs="tcp:100776:248"/>
ſuccour, by the ſame Croſſe. I ſaw, that no Crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture vnderſtood me; and this I vnderſtood very clearly, though yet I durſt not ſay ſo, to anie bodie, but my Ghoſtlie Father; for, that, indeed, might haue authoriſed them to ſay truly, that I wanted humilitie.</p>
            <p>But our Bleſſed Lord was pleaſed to recouer me, from a great part of my trouble; yea and euen at that time, from it all, by bringing that bleſſed man, <hi>Fray Pedro de Alcantara,</hi> thither, of whome I made mention before, when I ſpake ſomewhat of his great Pennance. And now I alſo remember, that, amongſt other things, I haue been informed, that, for twentie yeares togeather, he had worne, vpon his bare Bodie, a certaine Garment of Lattin, in forme of a Haire Cloath. This man was the Authour of certaine little Treatiſes, concerning Prayer, written in Spaniſh; and they are now in the hands of manie. For he, as being a perſon, who had accuſtomed himſelf much, to that holie exerciſe, wrote very profitably thereof, for them, who liue in the Obſeruance of the Firſt Rule of the Bleſſed S. Francis, according to the full rigour of the ſame. When therefore a certaine Widdow, of whome I ſpoke els where, (who was a great Seruant of Al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mightie God, and a particular freind of mine) came to know, that ſo great a man was there, with me; and knew alſo the great neceſſities, wherein I was, (as hauing been the witnes of my afflictions) and had comforted me, in ſeuerall oc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>caſions, (for, her Faith was euer ſo great, that ſhe
<pb n="424" facs="tcp:100776:249"/>
could neuer, in fine, beleiue, but that it was the Spirit of Almightie God, which all the reſt, would needs haue to be the Diuel) and conſidering alſo, that ſhe was a perſon of very good vnderſtanding, and of great ſecrecie withall, and one, to whome our Lord vouchſafed to doe great Fauours in Prayer) his Diuine Maieſtie was pleaſed, to giue her knowledge of thoſe things, whereof they, who were Learned, were wholy ignorant. My Ghoſtlie Fathers then gaue me leaue, that I might eaſe my ſelf, in ſome things, with her; for ſhe was capable, manie wayes, to vnderſtand them; for ſometimes, it had come to her turne, to enioy euen ſome of thoſe verie Fauours, which our Lord had alſo vouchſafed to affoard me, togeather with certaine aduertiſments, which he had alſo giuen her, for the good of her Soule. But now, as ſoone as <hi>Fray Pedro</hi> came to know of my deſigne, he did (without ſaying anie thing to me) deſire, and get leaue of my Prouinciall, that I might re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maine with her, in her Houſe, for a matter of ſome eight dayes; and ſo, both there, and in ſeuerall Churches, I ſpoke with him, diuerſe times, in that firſt occaſion of my being there; for I commu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nicated my affaires with him alſo afterward, in ſundry occaſions, at which time I gaue him like<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe account of my life, (though yet, but in a Sum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>marie way) and of the manner of my proceeding in Prayer; and this, with the greateſt claritie, which I could poſſibly vſe; for, this propertie I euer had, to treat with all claritie, and truth, with them, to
<pb n="425" facs="tcp:100776:249"/>
whome I imparted my Soule; yea and I ſtill de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſired, that euen the firſt motions of my hart, might be made knowne, to them; and as for ſuch things, as might be ſubiect anie way, to ſuſpition, or doubt, I ſtill was wont to argue them, <note n="*" place="margin">A very ſafe and vviſe vvay of proceed<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing.</note> againſt my ſelf, with the ſtrongeſt reaſons, that I could bring. So that I imparted my Soule to this Father, without anie manner of duplicitie, or diſguiſe at all; and I found, that he vnderſtood me, almoſt euen at the verie firſt, by experience; which was indeed, the onlie thing, whereof I had need, at that time; for then, I could not giue my ſelf ſo well, to be vnderſtood, as now I can; at leaſt not ſo farre, as to expreſſe it home. For, ſince that time, it hath pleaſed our Lord, to enable me to vnder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtand, and to declare to me, the Fauours, which his Diuine Maieſtie doth me; but formerly, it was ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſarie enough for me, to find a perſon, who had paſſed through the ſame things, by experience; if I would hope, that he ſhould perfectly vnderſtand me, and declare to me, what euerie thing was. Now, this Father gaue me very great light; for I could not, by anie meanes, vnderſtand, what that could be, which concerned thoſe Viſions, which were not Imaginarie, or repreſented by the Ima<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gination; and me thought alſo, that I vnderſtood as little of thoſe others, which I ſaw with the onlie eyes of my Soule, for, as I haue ſayd before, thoſe only, which were viſible, by our Corporeall eyes, ſeemed to me, to be indeed, of importance; and of theſe, I had receaued none at all.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="426" facs="tcp:100776:250"/>
But now, this holie man, gaue me light in all; and declared it to me; and required me, not to be troubled anie longer; but that I ſhould bleſſe, and praiſe Almightie God; and that I was to be very ſure, that theſe were true effects of his Spirit; and that, although it were no Article of Faith, yet nothing could be more certainly true, nor which I might more firmely beleiue. And he comforted himſelf very much, with me; and ſhewed me all courteſie, and fauour; and euer after, he had great care of me; and he communicated diuerſe of his affaires, and buſineſſes, with me. And finding, that I had the ſelf-ſame deſires of thoſe things, which he had already put in practiſe, (for indeed, in as much as concerned deſires, our Lord had giuen them to me, with great reſolution) and finding alſo, that I was ſo full of courage, in order to that end, he tooke particular contentment, to treat with me. For, whenſoeuer our Bleſſed Lord is pleaſed to bring one to this State, there is <note n="*" place="margin">This is a moſt certaine truth.</note> no ioy, or comfort, which can be equall to the meeting with ſome ſuch other perſon, as to whome our Lord hath been pleaſed, to vouchſafe ſome be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginning thereof; for then perhaps, I had not much more, then a beginning, by what I may be able to conceiue; And I beſeech our Bleſſed Lord, that I haue it vet. But as for him, he had extraordinarie compaſſion of me, and told me that one of the verie greateſt afflictions of this life, was that, which I had endured; Namely, the oppoſition, and contradiction of good men; and that ſtill, I would
<pb n="427" facs="tcp:100776:250"/>
be a little obnoxious, in the ſame kind; becauſe I muſt euer be in need of help; and that he feared, there was no bodie in that Cittie, who would vnderſtand me. But, that he would ſpeake with my Ghoſtlie Father, &amp; to one alſo of thoſe others, who was wont to giue me moſt diſcomfort; which was, that married Cauallier, of whome I ſpoke before. For he, as being a perſon, who loued me, perhaps, more then the reſt, did continually make warre vpon me; and he was a man of a tender, and holie Soule; and conſidering, how lately before, he had found how wicked I was, he knew not, how to make himſelf ſure, that all was right.</p>
            <p>But now, the holle man <hi>Fray Pedro,</hi> grew to talke with thoſe two perſons, afforeſayd; and he ſhewed them cauſes, and reaſons, why they ſhould, both quiet, and aſſure themſelues, and diſturbe me no more. As for my Ghoſtlie Father, there was no very great need of much diligence; but as for the Cauallier, it ſuffiſed not for him, to heare what <hi>Fray Pedro</hi> ſayd; though yet, it were a meanes, to keep him from frighting me, ſo very much, as he had done before. But then, we reſol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ued togeather, that I ſhould write to <hi>Fray Pedro,</hi> of all that, which might ſucceed to me afterward; and to recommend one another much, to Al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mightie God; for, ſo great was his humilitie, as to make ſome little account of the prayers of this miſerable Creature; which gaue me confuſion enough. But he left me, with extreame comfort, and guſt, and directed me to proceed ſecurely
<pb n="428" facs="tcp:100776:251"/>
on, with my Prayer; and to make no doubt at all, but that it was of Almightie God; and that, when<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſoeuer I might be in anie doubt, for mine owne greater ſecuritie, I ſhould impart whatſoeuer oc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>curred, to my Ghoſtlie Father; and that then, I ſhould hold my ſelf for ſafe. But yet, notwith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtanding all this counſaile, I was not able, to be entirely ſecure; becauſe our Lord was pleaſed, to guide me ſtill, by the way of feare; which ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times made me apt to doubt, that the Diuel had a hand in the buſines, whenſoeuer they would needs tell me, that it was ſo. And thus indeed, vp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on the whole matter, no Creature was able to giue me, either ſo much ſecuritie, or ſo much feare, as to make me yeild more credit to either of them, then our Lord was pleaſed to infuſe into my Soule. So that, howſoeuer this holie man did helpe me, both to quiet, and comfort, yet did I not ſo entirely beleiue him, as to remaine with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out anie feare at all; eſpecially, when our Lord came, ſometimes, to leaue me in certaine troubles of minde, which I ſhall inſtantly relate; yet how<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſoeuer, (as I was ſaying,) my comfort was then much encreaſed. But I could not then ſatisfye my ſelf, with giuing humble thankes enow to Al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mightie God, and to that Glorious Father of mine, <hi>S. Ioſeph,</hi> who (as I was apt to thinke) had brought <hi>Fray Pedro</hi> thither; for he was Commiſſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rie Generall of the <hi>Cuſtodia of S. Ioſeph;</hi> to whome, as alſo to our B. Ladie, I vſed to recommend my ſelf much.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="429" facs="tcp:100776:251"/>
Now it had hapned to me formerly, ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times, (yea and ſo it doth alſo yet, though not ſo often) to find my ſelf in ſo exceſſiue troubles, and afflictions of Mind, togeather with feirce infir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mities, afflictions, and torments of Bodie, that I knew not, which way to turne my ſelf. At other times, I haue been ſubiect to corporall miſeries, which were more greiuous; but yet, not finding my ſelf ſubiect then, to the ſenſe of ſuch ſorrowes of minde, as now I haue, I paſſed with much ala<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>critie, through them all. But whenſoeuer they, of both kindes, came togeather, the miſerie of it was ſo great, as that it gaue me affliction enough. And as for thoſe great Fauours, which our Lord had been pleaſed to doe me, I then forgot them all; and there only remained but ſuch a kind of memorie of them, as of a thing which I had dreamt; and this ſerued but to giue me ſo much the more paine. For, the Vnderſtanding growes, in thoſe caſes, to be all obſcured, and dulled; in ſuch ſort, as that it made me enter into a thou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſand ſuſpicions, <note n="*" place="margin">Heer follovves a vvhole vvorld of ſad tempta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions &amp; troubles.</note> and doubts, as if I had not for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>merly vnderſtood things well; and that perhaps, I followed fancies, in ſtead of truths; and that it might haue been miſerie enough, for me, to be deceaued my ſelf, without ſeeking to abuſe, and coſen ſo manie good men; and I ſeemed to be ſo very wicked, that me thought, all the miſcheifs, and Hereſies, which had been raiſed, and brought lately into the world, were but the fruits of my Sinnes. But, this is a falſe kind of humilitie, which
<pb n="430" facs="tcp:100776:252"/>
the Diuel inuented of purpoſe, for my diſquiet, to try, if he could bring my Soule to deſpaire. And I know ſo well, by experience, that this is a trick of the Diuel, that now, when he findes, that I vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtand him, he torments me not ſo often heerin, as he was wont. The certaintie of this truth, is clearly found, by the reſtleſnes, and diſquiet, wherewith he beginnes; and by the buſsling, which he keepes in the Soule, all the while it laſts; and by the obſcuritie, and affliction, which he brings to it; and by the drynes, and indiſpoſition to Prayer, which he leaues after it; and, in fine, becauſe it produces no good effect at all; for he ſeemes euen to ſtifle the Soule, and to bind euen the Bodie alſo vp, that ſo it may be good for nothing; whereas, by true Humilitie, though the Soule know it ſelf to be wicked, and is in paine, to conſider what we are; and makes vs hold our Sinnes to be as great, and as greatly to be exagge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rated, as hath been ſayd; and that they are felt in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed to be ſuch; yet comes not this kind of ſenſe, with anie tumultuous diſorder; nor doth it diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turbe, and vex the Soule, nor obſcure her, nor giue drynes to her; but rather it regales her, and behaues it ſelf in a very contrarie way; with gen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tlenes, with ſuauitie, and with Light. She <note n="*" place="margin">The differe<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ce betvvee<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> Diuine, and Dia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bolicall greife of minde.</note> is troub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led in ſome ſort, on the one ſide, euen for that ſhe is comforted, to ſee, how great Fauour our Lord imparts to her, in letting her feele that paine; and to conſider, how well employed it is; and the ſorrowes, for whatſoeuer ſhe hath done,
<pb n="431" facs="tcp:100776:252"/>
againſt Almightie God; But yet, on the other ſide, ſhe exalts, and admires his mercie; ſhe hath light, wherewith to put her ſelf to confuſion; and to praiſe his Diuine Maieſtie, for vouchſafing to en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dure her ſo long. But in that other kind of Hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>militie, which the Diuel brings, there is no light, for anie thing, which is good; but it ſeemes, as if God were readie, to put all the world, to fire, and ſword. The Diuel repreſents the Diuine Iuſtice to the Soule; and though he permit her to beleiue, that God hath mercie, (for the Diuel hath no ſuch power, as to deſtroy her Faith) yet hath ſhe euen that, in ſuch ſort, that it is no comfort to her, at all; but rather, when ſhe beholds God's great mercie, he makes it ſerue her, for ſo much the greater torment, becauſe ſhe ſeems to haue been obliged thereby, to haue ſerued Almightie God, ſo much the more.</p>
            <p>This is an inuention of the Diuel, and that of the moſt painefull, and ſubtile, and diſguiſed, that I haue euer found; and therefore I would wiſh your Reuerence (if perhaps, he may procure to tempt you heerafter, in this kind) to looke vpon it, with a Light in your hand, and to procure to know him well, if he leaue you vnderſtanding enough, for doing it. And beleiue not heer, that Knowledge, and Learning will ſerue the turne; for though I be in want enough of all that, yet now, when I am gotten out of his reach, I am growne to vnderſtand very well, that all his diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>courſe, is but foolerie; And that, which I vnder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtand
<pb n="432" facs="tcp:100776:253"/>
alſo, is, that ſometimes our Bleſſed Lord is pleaſed to giue way, and permit it; and he allowes him leaue, to doe this, as he did, that he might try, and tempt <hi>Iob;</hi> though, becauſe I am ſo wic<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ked, he permits not, that it be done to me, with ſo much rigour.</p>
            <p>It hapned to me once, (and I remember very well, that it was vpon the day, before <hi>Corpus-Chriſti Eue,</hi> (a Feſtiuitie, to which I am deuoted, though yet, not ſo much, as were fitt) and at that time, it laſted with me but one day, but at other times, for a weeke, and a Forthnight, yea and ſometimes, three weekes, and peraduenture more, and eſpecially in the Holie Weekes, which were wont to be my Regalo, in point of Prayer) that me thought, he <note n="*" place="margin">The vvay &amp; manner of a great de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolation.</note> catched-vp, and euen car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ried-away my Vnderſtanding, at an inſtant, for certaine things ſometimes, ſo very triuiall, and light, that, at other times, I would but haue laughed at him, for his paines; and then he makes her ſtoope, to whatſoeuer he liſts; and the Soule remaines, as it were, nayled to the place, without being Miſtreſſe of her ſelf, or being able to thinke of anie thing, but thoſe impertinent fooleries, which the rempration repreſents; and indeed, they haue no ſubſtance at all; nor doe they either bind, or looſe, but ſerue only to choake the Soule, in ſuch ſort, as not to ſuffer her to ſubſiſt, in her ſelf. And really, it is true, that it hath hapned to me ſometimes, to conceaue, that the Diuells goe playing with a Soule, as men would doe with a
<pb n="433" facs="tcp:100776:253"/>
Ball; and ſhe, the while, is without anie meanes at all, to deliuer her ſelf, out of their power. Nor can it be expreſſed, in what a deale of ſufferance ſhe is, by this meanes. She walkes in ſearch of ſome defence; and Almightie God permits, that ſhe may find none. She only, and euer remaines, with the Facultie, and Power of her Free-Will; though yet, not faire, and cleare, but as if a man had eyes, which were ſhut; or as if ſome perſon, who had gone very often, by anie way, and ſo, though it were night, and darke, yet, by the markes, which he had formerly taken, knowes where he may be in danger to ſtumble; becauſe formerly he had ſeen the ſame pathes, by day, and ſo, he ſecures himſelf from that danger. In like manner, doth it occurr to the Soule, which now ſeemes, but meerly by cuſtome, not to offend Almightie God; for, I ſpeake not heer, of that protection, which our Lord affords her, though yet, that be the thing, which imports moſt. But, in the meane time, our Faith is deaded; or at leaſt, layd aſleep; as the other vertues alſo are, in ſuch times, as thoſe; though yet, they be not vtterly loſt; for, ſhe well beleiues, euen then, that Doc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trine, which the Church teaches; and ſhe pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nounces it alſo with her mouth; whereas yet, on the other ſide, the Diuel doth ſo preſſe, and dull this Faith, that ſhe ſeemes to haue but ſuch a kind of knowledge of God, as men haue a notice of things, which are ſpoken of, in their hearing; but yet, from very farre off. Her Loue alſo, is ſo
<pb n="434" facs="tcp:100776:254"/>
very Luke-warme, that, if ſhe chance to heare Almightie God ſpoken of, ſhe harkens in ſuch a kind, as to beleiue indeed, that he is that, which he is, becauſe the Church declares it; but yet, she hath vtterly loſt all memorie, of whatſoeuer she hath experimented of him, in her ſelf. For her, to goe and pray, and remaine in Solitude, is but to encreaſe her affliction; for, the torment, which she feeles in her ſelf (and yet, without knowing very well, why) is an vnſupportable thing, in my opinion; and indeed, it is a kind of picture, in lit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle, or rather a patterne of Hell. And this is moſt certainly ſo; as our Lord himſelf was pleaſed to giue me to vnderſtand, once, in a certaine Viſion. For heer, the Soule doth euen burne her ſelf vp, of her ſelf, without her knowing, either by whome, or by what way, she is ſet on fire; or yet, how to eſcape from thence; or finally, how to quench it; for, as for ſeeking to help her ſelf by reading, she will be able to profit by it, no more, then if she could not read at all.</p>
            <p>It hapned to me, one day, to reade the Life of a Saint, ſo to ſee, if I could ſwallow the iuyce, and ſubſtance thereof; and thus to comfort my ſelf, with the conſideration of what he had ſuffered; and ſo, I read half a dozen lines of it, foure or fiue times ouer; and yet, though all were written in mine owne Mother-Toung, I vnderſtood them leſſe, in the end, then I did in the beginning; and ſo I gaue it ouer. This hapned to me manie times; but I more particularly remember this one.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="435" facs="tcp:100776:254"/>
To apply ones-ſelf to conuerſation, in ſuch times as theſe, is yet worſe; for, the Diuel fills vs then, with ſuch an vntoward, and harſh kind of ſpirit of anger, that it ſeemes to me, that I could euen eate folkes vp, ſince I can doe nothing els; yea and me thinkes, I acquitt my ſelf well, in that I forbeare to doe it; and that God alſo ſhewes him, who is in this caſe, a particular Fauour, in preſeruing him from doing, or ſaying ſomewhat, againſt his Neighbour, whereby he might preiu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dice him, and offend Almightie God.</p>
            <p>And now, as for going to my Ghoſtlie Father, at ſuch times; it is certaine, which I ſhall heer re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>late; and it hath hapned to me, very often; That, notwithſtanding they were ſome great Saints, with whome I haue dealt, and yet deale; they vt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tered ſuch harſh words, and chidd me after ſo ſharpe a manner, that, when afterward, I would take occaſion to repeate them, in their owne hearing, themſelues would be euen amazed, at themſelues; and they told me, it was no longer, in their power, to doe otherwiſe. For, though they fully reſolued within themſelues, not to doe it; and at other times, that they had not only compaſſion of me, but euen a kind of ſcruple alſo, in themſelues, to treat me thus, when I was ſo full of affliction, both in Bodie, and Minde; and though they had euen reſolued, to comfort me, with much compaſſion, and pittie, yet, in fine, they were not able, to doe it. Not yet, that they gaue me ill language, in ſuch ſort, as to offend
<pb n="436" facs="tcp:100776:255"/>
Almightie God, by it, but they would vſe words, as full of diſguſt, as could poſſibly be heard, from Ghoſtlie Fathers. But belike, they intended to mortifye me; which though at other times, I could paſſe ouer, or at leaſt, endure, yet then, it grew all, to be a torment.</p>
            <p>But yet ſometimes, I came alſo to be of opini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, that euen I had deceaued them; yea and my ſelf would goe to them, and aduiſe them, in very great good earneſt, that they should take heed of me, leaſt I deceaued them. Not, but that I knew well enough, that I would not doe it, on ſet purpoſe, and vpon deſigne, nor tell them, by anie meanes, anie lye; but the truth is, I was af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>frayd of all things. There was one, who hearing of this temptation of mine, aduiſed me, not to be troubled at it; for, <note n="*" place="margin">A pretty humour.</note> though I should haue a minde to coſen him, yet he had witt enough, to defend himſelf, from me.</p>
            <p>That, which ſometimes gaue me great com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fort, and, as it were, conſtantly, or, at leaſt, moſt ordinarily, was, that I vſed to haue ſome kind of reſpit, after I had Communicated; yea and ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times, euen in approaching to the Bleſſed Sacra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, at the verie inſtant, I should grow ſo very perfectly well, both in Bodie, and Soule, that it did euen amaze me. For, it ſeemed, to be no other thing, then that all the darkneſſes of my Soule, were diſperſed, and diſcharged at an inſtant; and that, vpon the approach of the Sunne, I quickly came to diſcerne thoſe fooleries,
<pb n="437" facs="tcp:100776:255"/>
wherein I had found my ſelf, all that while.</p>
            <p>At other times, by the hearing of ſome one word, which our Lord was pleaſed to ſay to me, and with only expreſſing himſelf thus; <hi>Be not af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flicted; and be not afrayd,</hi> as formerly I haue related, I remained moſt perfectly well; and ſometimes, by ſeeing ſome Viſion, I became, as if I had neuer felt anie inconuenience. And in thoſe caſes, I would be entertaining, and regaling my ſelf, with Almightie God; and would, euen kindly complaine to him, againſt himſelf, for permitting me to ſuffer ſo great torments; though yet I muſt confeſſe, that he had firſt meant, to make me very good amends; becauſe, theſe difficulties, did neuer vſe to ariue, but after a great abundance of Fauours. And me thinkes, he ordaines things ſo, to the end, that the Soule may appeare like gold, which comes refined, and pure, out of the Cruſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble; and that ſo, ſhe may ſee our Lord, in her ſelf; and then, doe thoſe troubles, which ariue, grow to be accounted little, though they ſeem inſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portable, at the time. And we deſire, that we may returne againe, to ſuffer, if our Lord may be ſerued the better, by it; yea and to admit alſo of more tribulations, and perſecutions; Prouided alwayes, that they may happen, without offence of our Lord. Nay, we rather will reioyce in ſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fering for him; for, all will, in the end, bring more profit; though yet, for my part, I could neuer beare them, as I ought, but rather with abundance of imperfection. At other times, theſe troubles
<pb n="438" facs="tcp:100776:256"/>
would come vpon me, in other kindes; and ſo, as that me thinkes, it is abſolutly a kind of im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſſible thing, for me to thinke then, of anie thing, which is good; yea or ſo much, as to deſire, to doe anie ſuch thing; for that I haue both a Bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>die, and a Soule, which is abſolutly vntoward, and good for nothing. But at thoſe times, I am not ſubiect to thoſe other temptations, and diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quiets, but only to a diſguſt in all things, though I know not, why; ſo that nothing can giue con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tentment to my Soule. And then I would be ſometimes procuring, to diuert, and employ my ſelf, vpon the performing of ſome good workes, in the exteriour way; and I would doe ſo, euen half, whether my ſelf would, or no. But, in fine, I am come, at length, to know, by ſuch meanes as theſe, how very little anie Soule is worth, whenſoeuer the grace of Almightie God, is hid<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>den from her. And this kind of conſideration, vſed not to put me to anie trouble at all; for, the beholding mine owne baſenes, after this manner, was wont to giue me a kind of ſatisfaction.</p>
            <p>At other times, I find my ſelf ſo, as that I am vtterly vnable, to frame anie diſtinct, or formed conceipt of Almightie God; nor indeed of anie good thing, after a ſtayd manner. Nor am I able then, to put my ſelf in Prayer, though I be neuer ſo much alone; though yet, I feele ſtill, that I know there is a God; and I find alſo, that it is my Imagination, and my Vnderſtanding, which doe me ſo much hurt, in theſe occaſions, and cafes;
<pb n="439" facs="tcp:100776:256"/>
for, as for my Will, me thinkes, it ſtands right in me, and that it is diſpoſed to all goodnes. But this Vnderſtanding of mine, is ſo entirely loſt, that it ſeemes to be no other thing, then ſome furious, and madd kind of Foole, whome no bodie is able to bind; nor am I ſo farre Miſtreſſe thereof, as that I can make it quiet, for one <hi>Credo.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Sometimes I fall on laughing; and yet then, doe I know my miſerie, and ſtand looking vpon my Soule, and permit her to doe, what ſhe will; and yet, our Lord be thanked, ſhe neuer, by anie meanes, applyes her ſelf to anie thing, which is ill, but only about things, which are indifferent, if there be anie thing, which may occurr, to be done, either heer, or there, or anie where els. But thus, I come to know better, the incomparable mercie, which our Lord is pleaſed to ſhew me, vpon his tying-vp this madd foole, when we are in perfect contemplation. And heer, I conſider, what would become of me, if ſuch perſons as hold me now for good, could diſcerne me, to haue theſe idleneſſes, and impertinencies, which I haue deſcribed heer.</p>
            <p>But now, I haue very great compaſſion of a Soule, to find her, in ſo ill companie, as this. I would faine ſee her rather, in libertie; and I ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſe my ſelf, in this manner, to our Bleſſed Lord: When, O my God, ſhall I ariue, to ſee my Soule, all conioyned, and vnited togeather, in celebrat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing thy praiſe; that ſo, all the Powers thereof, may admire thee? Permit not heerafrer, O Lord,
<pb n="440" facs="tcp:100776:257"/>
that ſhe wander, vp, and downe, by peices; for now it ſeemes no otherwiſe, then as if euerie one of the ſame Powers, were running, vp, and downe, in a ſeuerall way. Theſe things paſſe thus, very often; and I vnderſtand alſo very well, that ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times, the little corporall health I haue, contri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>butes much, to theſe inconueniences. I alſo reflect much, by theſe occaſions, vpon the hurt, which the Sinne of our Firſt Parent, hath done vs; for, me thinkes, it is growne from thence, that we are incapable to enioy ſo great a good; and mine owne ſinnes, are a great part of the cauſe; for cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainly, if I had not committed ſo manie, I ſhould haue remained more entire, and free, towards the doing of good.</p>
            <p>I was ſubiect alſo, by times, to another very great inconuenience; for, conceauing that I vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtood all the Bookes, that treat of Prayer, which I came to read, and that already, our Bleſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed Lord had done me ſome ſuch kind of fauour, as that I needed them not; for this reaſon, I did not read them, but applyed my ſelf to read the Liues of Saints. And finding my ſelf alſo very ſhort, in that, wherein they had ſo heroically ſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ued Almightie God, this ſeemed to doe me good, and giue me ſtrength; but yet, me thought, this was a ſigne of little humilitie, for me to thinke, that I was already ariued, to hold that degree of Prayer. And not being able, to quiet my ſelf otherwiſe, I continued much in paine, till certaine learned men, and particularly, that bleſſed Crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture,
<pb n="441" facs="tcp:100776:257"/>
               <hi>Fray pedro de Alcantara,</hi> declared to me, that I was not, to be troubled at that.</p>
            <p>I am not ignorant, that in the ſeruing of Al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mightie God, I haue not yet ſo much as begunne; though yet, the way, which his Diuine Maieſtie hath held, in doing me Fauours, is the ſame, which he hath vſed towards ſuch, as are good; whereas, for my part, I am no more, then a direct downe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>right meer imperfection, vnleſſe it be, in my deſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>res, to loue him; for, in this, indeed, I ſee well, that our Lord hath done me Fauour, that ſo I may performe ſome little thing, for him. I confeſſe, me thinkes, I loue him; but my actions, and the manie imperfections, which I diſcerne therein, giue me great diſcomfort.</p>
            <p>At other times, my Soule falls into a kind of Foolerie; for ſo it is, when, me thinkes, I doe nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther good, nor ill, but follow on, after the walke of others folkes; and this, neither with paine, nor glorie; nor with thought of life, or death, nor guſt, nor trouble; yea, me thinkes, ſhe feeles no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing at all, but rather ſeemes to me, to walke on, like ſome little Aſſe, who ſeeds, and ſuſtaines him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf, becauſe they giue him ſomewhat to eate; and he eates, almoſt without thinking, what he is doing. For, the Soule, when ſhe is in this ſtate, is not likely to be without feeding, vpon ſome great Fauours of Almightie God, ſince ſhe is not troub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led, with liuing in ſo miſerable a life, as this, but paſſes through it, with patience, and equalitie of minde; but yet, theſe motions, and effects, are not
<pb n="442" facs="tcp:100776:258"/>
found by her, in ſuch ſort, as that the Soule is made to vnderſtand her ſelf by them.</p>
            <p>It ſeemes now alſo to me, to be, as when men ſaile at Sea, by the breath of a ſweet, and gentle Winde; for then, we ridd much way, though we ſcarce know how; Whereas, in thoſe other condi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions, the effects are ſo very great, that the Soule doth almoſt inſtantly<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> diſcerne her owne im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prouement; for inſtantly doe her deſires boile vp, and the Soule can neuer ſatisfye her ſelf; but they, to whome Almightie God imparts ſuch impetuo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſities of Loue, doe find ſuch operations, as theſe. This is like certaine little Springs, which I haue obſerued to riſe, and where the Sand neuer ceaſes to moue vpwards. And this example, and com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pariſon of Soules, which be ariued to this ſtate, ſeemes very naturall to me. For, Loue will be euer boyling vpward, and conſidering, and deuiſing, about what it may be able to doe; and can, by no meanes, be contained in it ſelf; as it ſeemes, the water, whereof I ſpake, is not able to continue in the earth, which ſtill is caſting it vp, from thence. And iuſt ſo, is it very vſuall for the Soule, not to be at quiet, or in contentment with her ſelf, through the loue ſhe beares to Almightie God; but ſhe is ſo bathed, and ſoaked, and filled with it, that ſhe wiſhes, that others would drinke too, (ſince, for her part, ſhe cannot want) that ſo they might aſſiſt her, to ſing the praiſes of Almightie God.</p>
            <p>O how often doe I call to minde, that liuing
<pb n="443" facs="tcp:100776:258"/>
Water, whereof our Lord ſpake to the Samari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tan; as, indeed, I am very much deuoted to that Ghoſpell. And really, it is moſt true, that I was ſo, euen from my childhood, though I did not then, vnderſtand this benefit, as now I doe; but I often beſought our Lord, to beſtow of this Water vp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on me; and alwaies, I had the Image, or Figure of it, at hand, with this Motto, or Word of hers, when he was ſo neer the Well: <hi>Domine da mihi hanc aquam; O Lord, beſtovv this vvater vpon me.</hi> It ſeemes alſo to me, that as a Fire which is very great, needs matter vpon which to worke, to the end that it may not be extinguiſhed: So alſo for thoſe Soules, whereof I ſpeake, it is neceſſary that they be bringing wood, how deare ſoeuer it may coſt them; to the end, that this fire may not goe out. For my part, I am ſo miſerable a Creature, that I would be content, if I had but ſtrawes, to caſt in.</p>
            <p>And ſo it happens to me ſometimes, yea and very often, that, one while I would be laughing, and at other times, much afflicted. For, a certaine interiour motion, and impulſe, which I haue, is euer inciting me, to ſerue God, in ſomewhat; and (ſince I am not fitt for greater matters) to doe it, by gathering Flowers, and making Poſies, and applying them, in decent manner, to holie Ima<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ges, and Pictures; to ſweep, or dreſſe-vp ſome Oratorie; or in doing ſuch other little, and poore things, as gaue me confuſion, to ſee, that they were no greater. And ſo alſo, if I chanced to doe
<pb n="444" facs="tcp:100776:259"/>
anie Pennance, it was all, ſo very little, and ſo poorely done, that vnleſſe our Lord ſhould vouchſafe to accept the Deſire, for the Deed, I ſaw plainely, that I was good for nothing; and, in a word, I did euen laugh at my ſelf.</p>
            <p>But now, it giues no ſmall trouble, to ſuch Soules, as it pleaſes Almightie God, through his goodnes, to endue, with the fire of his Loue, in great abundance, if they be in want of corporall health, and ſtrength, whereby they may be able, to doe ſomewhat for him; ſince this giues a very great paine. For, in regard that we want ſtrength, to carrie ſtill, more and more wood, to this fire, (and ſuch Soules doe euen dye, for the feare they haue, leaſt the Fire ſhould goe out) it ſeemes to me, that ſhe doth euen conſume, and burne her ſelf vp, into aſhes; or els, euen diſſolue her ſelf into teares, and ſo breath her ſelfe away, into no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing; and this is a ſtrong kind of torment, though it leaue not, to be ſauourie withall. Let ſuch a Soule, as this, giue great thankes to Almightie God, if ſhe haue ariued to this <note n="*" place="margin">A happy State.</note> ſtate; and if our Lord haue giuen her perſon, corporall ſtrength, to doe pennance; or if he haue imparted Learn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, and talents, and power, to Preach, and heare Confeſſions, and winne Soules to Almightie God. For ſhe knowes not, nor vnderſtands not the great benefit, which is poſſeſſed by her, vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſſe ſhe be growne ſo farre, as to feele the afflic<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion which it brings, to be euer receauing much, at the hands of our Lord, and neuer to be able
<pb n="445" facs="tcp:100776:259"/>
withall, to be doing his Diuine Maieſtie anie Seruice. Let him be euer Bleſſed for all; and let the Angells giue him glorie, Amen.</p>
            <p>I know not, whether I doe well, to be writing of ſo manie little things; but ſince your Reuer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence hath commanded me yet againe, not to eſteem it anie trouble to enlarge my ſelf, and that I muſt be ſure to omit nothing, I therefore goe diſcourſing with clearnes, and with truth, of as much as I can call to mind. And it is impoſſible, but that I ſhould omitt manie things; for els, it would grow to coſt me much more time, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of I haue very little, as I haue ſayd; and then, when all were done, it would perhaps, be of no benefit at all.</p>

<pb n="447" facs="tcp:100776:260"/>
and wherein I could not be ignorant, but that it was he. I was once in a certaine Oratorie, and he appeared to me, on my left ſide, in an abomina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble kind of figure; and in particular, I obſerued his mouth, becauſe he was ſpeaking to me; and it was of a moſt vglie forme. It ſeemed to me, that a huge flame, came out of his bodie; and it was all, a very bright one, without anie obſcuritie at all. He told me, after a moſt hideous manner, that howſoeuer I had freed my ſelf once, out of his hands, he would yet find meanes enow, to fetch me back againe. I was in a mightie feare, but I bleſſed my ſelf, as well as I could; and ſo he vaniſhed a way; but yet he inſtantly returned; and this hapned to me, two ſeuerall times; Nor did I know, in the world, what to doe; only I had Holie-water, neer at hand; and ſo I ſprinkled it towards the part, where he was; and he neuer returned to me, anie more.</p>
            <p>Another time, he was ſome fiue howers togea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, tormenting me, with very terrible paine, and both exteriour, and interiour diſquiet; in ſuch ſort, that it was euen paſt enduring. The woemen, who were then at hand, were aſtoniſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, to ſee, what paſſed; but neither could they tell, what to doe, nor I, how to ſerue my ſelf; of their helpe.</p>
            <p>My cuſtome is, whenſoeuer anie corporall ſicknes, or paine, is very intollerable, to make certaine Acts within my ſelf, the beſt I can, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerching our Bleſſed Lord, that his Diuine Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ieſtie,
<pb n="446" facs="tcp:100776:260"/>
will giue me patience; and that, if it ſhall redound to his Seruice, I may continue, to ſuffer ſo, euen till the very end of the world. And there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore now, when I found my ſelf put to ſuffer, with ſo much rigour, I applyed my ſelf to get help, by making ſome ſuch acts, as thoſe, and di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uerſe good purpoſes alſo; that ſo, I might beare the burthen, the better. And our Lord was pleaſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed then, that I ſhould clearly vnderſtand it, to be the Diuel; for I ſaw a certaine little abomina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble Negro, or Black-More, hard by me, gnaſhing his teeth, euen like a deſpairing wretch; but yet, in fine, he loſt, by what he hoped to gaine; for, as ſoone as I ſaw him, I fell a laughing, and had no feare of him, at all; but there were ſome perſons by, who knew not, what to doe, in this caſe, nor how to procure anie remedie, for ſuch paine, as they ſaw me endure; the blowes being ſo great, which he made me giue my ſelf, both vpon my Armes, and my Head, and my whole Bodie; and I, not hauing anie power at all, to reſiſt him; yea and (which was worſe, then this) I was ſubiect to ſo great an inward kind of reſtleſnes, and diſquiet, as I could, by no meanes, appeaſe; no nor yet durſt I, ſo much as call for Holie-water, for feare of giuing them apprehenſion, who were there, and ſo, to make them know, what the matter was.</p>
            <p>For my part, I haue found, by much experience, that there is not anie thing, from which, the Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uels doe ſo certainly fly, (and ſo, as to returne no
<pb n="448" facs="tcp:100776:261"/>
more) as from <note n="*" place="margin">The excel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lency of Holy VVater.</note> Holie-Water. They fly alſo from the Croſſe; but, in that caſe, they will preſently, ſometimes, returne againe. So that certainly, the vertue of Holie-water, is great; and for my part, my Soule finds a particular, and euident kind of comfort, when I take it; and really, and vſually, I feele ſuch an eaſe, and pleaſure in it, as I am not well able to expreſſe; for, it is an interiour delight, which comforts my whole Soule; and this is no meer imagination, or fancie, nor a thing, which hath hapned to me only once, but very often; and when I obſerue it, with moſt attention, me thinkes, it is as if a bodie, who were much troub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led with heat, and thirſt, ſhould drinke a draught of very cold water, which ſhould refreſh him, euen to his harts deſire. And heervpon, I alſo con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſider, that all thoſe things, which be ordained by the Church, are of great importance, and mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment; and it is matter euen of much Regalo to me, that thoſe words, which the <note n="*" place="margin">A great, and iuſt conſola<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion.</note> Church vſes, and ſayes, ſhould haue the power, to make Holie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>water, become of ſo very different a condition, from ſuch other, as is not hallowed by the Church. But, in the meane time, when my tor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment would not ceaſe, I told them ſo, who were preſent, that ſo they might not laugh at me; and calling for Holie-water, they brought me ſome, and ſprinkled me with it; but it did me no good. Vpon that, I ſprinkled ſome, towards the place, where the ill Spirit was; and then he went inſtant<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly away; and I grew as inſtantly well, as if they
<pb n="449" facs="tcp:100776:261"/>
had ſtroaked my hurt off from me, with their hands; ſaue that I found my ſelf as wearie, as if I had been cudgelled extreamly. But now, it did me a very great deale of good, to find, that when our Lord giues the Diuel leaue, he is able to doe ſuch a deale of miſchief, to a Creature, both in Bodie, and Soule, euen when they are not his, or abſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lutly, in his power; for then, what would he be able to doe, when they ſhould be wholy left, to his diſpoſing? This gaue me alſo, a very great de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſire, to free my ſelf from ſo ill Companie, as that, of the Diuel, is.</p>
            <p>At another time, and that was lately, the ſelf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſame thing hapned to me, though yet, it laſted not long; but I was then alone; and then, I alſo called for Holie-Water; and two Religious Woemen, (who were very well worth the beleiuing, and would, by no meanes, be induced, to tell an vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>truth,) came-in thither, after the Diuel was depar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted from thence, and declared, that they felt a filthie ſtinke, as of brimſtone. For my part, I ſmelt it not; but they ſay, it continued ſo long, that others might alſo perceiue it.</p>
            <p>Another time, I was in the Quire; and I came into a very great depth of Recollection; and I went away, from thence, for feare, leaſt ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>what might be obſerued. But the Religious in the Quire, who were neer the place where I was, heard a noyſe of very great blowes, which were giuen; and, for my part, I alſo heard thoſe Spirits talke togeather, cloſe to me, as if they had been
<pb n="450" facs="tcp:100776:262"/>
agreeing about ſome buſines of theirs, though I knew not, what, in particular, it was; for I found my ſelfe in ſuch depth of Prayer, that I vnder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtood them not, in expreſſe manner; neither yet, had I anie feare of them, at all.</p>
            <p>But theſe things did ordinarily not ariue, but when ſome Soule, or other, did receiue benefit, vpon my perſwaſion, and aduiſe. And it is cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taine, that a thing hapned to me once, which I ſhall now relate; and there are manie witneſſes of it; &amp;, in particular, my Ghoſtlie Father, to whome I Confeſſe my ſelf now; for he ſaw it in a cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taine Letter, without my telling him, who it was, that wrote it; though yet, he chanced to know it, otherwiſe. But the thing was this. There came once a certaine perſon to me, who had been in Mortall Sinne, about ſome two yeares, and a balf; and he had committed one, which was of the moſt abominable, that euer I had heard of, in my whole life; and, during all that time, he neither Confeſſed, nor reformed himſelf, and yet he ſayd Maſſe, all the while. And though he then, Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſſed his other Sinnes, yet concerning that one, he was wont to aske himſelf, how it could be poſſible, that euer he ſhould Confeſſe ſo fowle a thing; and yet he had a deſire, to free himſelf from it, but knew not, in fine, how to effect it. For my part, I had great compaſſion of the man; and much greif, to ſee Almightie God ſo offended; and I promiſed him, to beſeech our Lord, to giue him remedie; and that I would alſo entreat diuerſe
<pb n="451" facs="tcp:100776:262"/>
others, who were much more likelie to preuaile, then my ſelf, to become ſuiters to his Diuine Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ieſtie, for him; and accordingly, I wrote to a cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taine perſon, about it, this man letting me know, that he could conuey my letter. And it is certaine, that heervpon, he inſtantly Confeſſed his Sinnes; and Almightie God was pleaſed (at the inſtance of thoſe many other holie perſons, to whome the buſines had been recommended) to extend his mercie, to this Soule; and my ſelf alſo, as miſera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble as I am, did not faile, to ſollicit it, the beſt I could. But the man wrote a Letter to me, declar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, that he was reformed, ſo farre, already, as that ſome good time had incurred, wherein he had returned no more, to that Sinne; but yet, that the torment was ſo great, by the temptation, which ſollicited him that way, that he accounted himſelf, to be almoſt, as it were, in a kind of Hell; ſo extreamly was he put to ſuffer by it; and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore, that I muſt help him ſtill, with Almightie God. Vpon this, I recommended him againe to my Siſters, the Religious of our Monaſterie; by meanes of whoſe prayers, it ſeemes, our Lord was pleaſed, to doe me this Fauour; for, they tooke the matter, very much to hart. This man, was a perſon, of whome, no one could gueſſe, who it was; and I humbly beſought the Diuine Maieſtie, to appeaſe thoſe torments, and temptations, to which he was ſubiect; and that thoſe Diuels might be ſuffered to torment me, in his place; prouided alwayes, that I might not offend our Bleſſed Lord,
<pb n="452" facs="tcp:100776:263"/>
in anie thing, by it. And it is very certainly true, that ſhortly after this, I endured moſt greiuous torments, for the ſpace of a moneth. And theſe two particulars, which I haue now related, did happen then. But our Lord, in the meane time, was pleaſed, that they ſhould leaue, to afflict that perſon anie more; for ſo, men ſent me word, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe I had already ſignifyed to them, what had occurred to me, during that moneth. And as for him, his Soule got ſtrength daily; and he grew to be abſolutly free; nor could he ſatisfye himſelf, with giuing thankes, not only to our Bleſſed Lord, but euen alſo to me, as if I had done ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>what therein. But the truth is, that the opinion, which he had, that our Lord did ſometimes ſhew me Fauours, was of benefit to him; for he ſayd, that, whenſoeuer he found himſelf, to be much aſſaulted, and preſſed, he vſed to read my Letters, and that preſently therevpon, he ſhould find himſelf ridd of the temptation. He grew to be much amazed, to vnderſtand, of what I had ſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fered; and how alſo, himſelf came to be free; yea and euen I, came alſo to wonder at it; and certain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, I would haue ſuffered manie yeares, for the aduantage, and deliuerance of a Soule. Let our Lord be praiſed for all; for, the prayers of ſuch, as ſerue him well, can doe much; as, I beleiue, my Siſters doe, of this Houſe; but yet, becauſe I had been earneſt in procuring thoſe prayers, the Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uels would be more enraged againſt me, then againſt others; and our Lord alſo permitted that, for my Sinnes.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="453" facs="tcp:100776:263"/>
About this time alſo, I once thought, that the Diuells would euen haue ſtrangled me; &amp; it was, by night. But as ſoone as I had cauſed Holie-wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter to be caſt vpon me, I ſaw a multitude of them runne away, as if they had been about to breake their necks, from ſome high rock. And it is ſo frequent, and familiar with me, to be tormented by theſe curſed wretches, and the feare, which now I haue of them, is growne to be ſo very little, (by ſeeing, that they are not ſo much as able to ſtirre, vnleſſe our Bleſſed Lord giue them leaue,) that although it might be of comfort to my ſelf, yet I ſhould not faile to wearie your Reuerence, if I related them. But euen that, which is ſayd al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ready, may ſerue to ſhew, that anie true Seruants of Almightie God, may need to trouble them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelues litle, at theſe idle frights, and Bugg-beares, which the Diuels are wont to expoſe, that ſo, they may make vs feare them; and, in fine, let the world be ſure, that euerie time, when we make them ſee, that we deſpiſe them, they will remaine with ſo much the leſſe ſtrength, after it; and the Soule, as being a greater Princeſſe, then ſhe was before, will remaine with ſo much more power, and profit; as I will not ſtand heer, to relate, for feare of too much length.</p>
            <p>But now I will only declare, what hapned to me once, vpon an All-Soules Day, at night; for, being, at that time, in the Oratorie, and hauing recited Matins, as alſo thoſe ſo very deuout Prayers, which are at the end thereof, according
<pb n="454" facs="tcp:100776:264"/>
to the Breuiarie, the Diuel put himſelf vpon the Booke, to the end, that I might not finiſh the Prayer; but I bleſſed my ſelf, with making the Signe of the Holie Croſſe, and ſo he went preſent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly away; but I beginning againe, he alſo returned; and I thinke it was no leſſe, that the like hapned, then three times; and till I caſt Holie-Water at him, I could not make an end of the buſines. But then, I plainly ſaw, that ſome Soules went out of Purgatorie, at the inſtant, who, belike, wanted very little of their deliuerance; and perhaps, the Diuel meant to diuert it. It is ſeldome, that I haue ſeen the Diuel, in anie exact, and particular Forme, or Figure; but manie times, without Forme, as I did the Viſion; for, a Bodie ſees very clearly, that he is there, as I haue declared already; and I will now relate this alſo, becauſe it amazes me very much.</p>
            <p>Being one day, in a certaine Monaſterie, and in the Quire, and vpon the Feſtiuitie of the Bleſſed Trinitie, I chanced to be in Rapt; and I ſaw a great contention, and ſtrife, between Angells, and Diuells, yet not knowing, what that Viſion might meane. But about ſome fifteen dayes before, it was heard, that a certaine great diſagreement had hapned, between ſome perſons, who were of Prayer, and manie others alſo, who were not ſo; &amp; there came a great deale of harme to the place, where this occurred; for, the ſtrife continued long; and it bred a very great deale of diſquiet.</p>
            <p>Another time, I ſaw a multitude of them, all
<pb n="455" facs="tcp:100776:264"/>
round about me; but then, it ſeemed to me, that I was enuironed with a great kind of Light, which permitted them not to approach. And I vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtood thereby, that our Lord kept them off, from coming neer me, in anie ſuch ſort, as to make me offend his Diuine Maieſtie; and by that, which I had found ſometimes in my ſelf, I con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceaued that it was a true Viſion. The matter is, that I now vnderſtand ſo very well, how little power they haue, whenſoeuer I goe not againſt God, that, in effect, I doe not feare them at all; for, their ſtrength is directly nothing, vnleſſe they find the Soules, they ſet vpon, to be cowardlie, and yeilding to them; but then indeed, they ſhew their power.</p>
            <p>In ſome of thoſe former Temptations, me thought, they employed themſelues, now, and then, vpon awaking, and reuiuing in me, the memorie of all the frailties, and vanities, of my former time; in ſuch ſort, as that I had good cauſe, to recommend my ſelf much, to Almightie God; but this, put me to very much paine, by making it ſeem to me, that now, it was all, of the Diuel, ſince thoſe thoughts of mine, returned; till ſuch time, as my Ghoſtlie Father put me in quiet. For really, it ſeemed to me, that euen the firſt motions of ill thoughts, were not ſo much as to approach anie ſuch perſon, as had receiued ſo great Fauours of our B. Lord.</p>
            <p>At other times, it tormented me much, yea and euen it torments me ſtill, to ſee, that men ſhould
<pb n="456" facs="tcp:100776:265"/>
hold me, in ſo high account; and eſpecially, that it ſhould be done, by eminent perſons; and that they ſhoud ſpeake ſo much good of me. And in this, I haue ſuffered, and ſtill ſuffer much; but I quickly caſt my thoughts, vpon the Life of Chriſt our Lord, and his Saints; and, me thinkes, I walke in a way, which is very contrarie, to that of theirs; for they aſpired to nothing, but to be ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iect to iniuries, and contempt. And this makes me walke with ſuch feare, as that I euen ſarce dare hold vp my head; and would be glad, to get my ſelfe out of ſight; which yet, I neuer deſire, when I find my ſelf ſubiect to perſecutions; for then, my Soule carries her ſelf like a great Ladie, whatſoeuer the Bodie may feele. I know not, how theſe things can ſtand; but yet they paſſe in ſuch ſort, that the Soule ſeemes then, to be as in her Kingdome; and that ſhe treads, and tramples all things, vnder her feet. This occurred to me ſeuerall times, and the ſame continued long; and I thought, it was vertue, and humilitie, but now I ſee plainly enough, that it was a temptation; and a Dominican Father, a learned man, declared it to me, very well. When I conceaued, that theſe Fauours, which our B. Lord was pleaſed to doe me, would grow to be publiquely knowne, it was of ſo exceſſiue a torment to me, that it extreamly diſquieted my Soule; and it came, at length, to that paſſe, that, whilſt I was conſidering the ſame, I could more willingly haue been contented, to be buried quick, then that anie ſuch thing ſhould
<pb n="457" facs="tcp:100776:265"/>
ariue. And ſo, when I came to haue thoſe ſo great Recollections, and Rapts, as that it was not poſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſible for me, to reſiſt them in publique, Iremain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed ſo confounded with ſhame afterward, that I would haue been glad, not to appeare, where anie Creature, who knew me, might ſee me. And being once extreamly afflicted, vpon this ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count, I was asked by our Bleſſed Lord, what it was, whereof I was ſo much afrayd. For, <note n="*" place="margin">A queſtion vvorthy of him that askt it.</note> ſaith he, this cannot grow, but from one of theſe two occaſions; Namely, that either it is, becauſe they will murmure againſt you; Orels, for that they will praiſe, and magnifye me. Meaning, that they, who ſhould beleiue it, would praiſe him; and they, who ſhould not beleiue it, would condemne me; though yet, without anie fault at all, of mine. But he ſayd, that both thoſe things, would proue to be of aduantage to me; and that there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore I muſt no longer, be troubled at it. This quieted me very much then; and it alſo comforts me now, whenſoeuer I call it to minde.</p>
            <p>This temptation came on ſo farre, that it gaue me an inclination, to quitt this place, and to carrie my fortunes with me, to another Monaſterie, which was very much more encloſed, and ſhut vp, then that, wherein I was, for the preſent. And I liked it alſo the rather, for that I had heard it extreamly praiſed, manie wayes; and beſides, it was a Houſe, of mine owne Order; yea and alſo very farre off, from my former aboade. And it was a thing, which would haue comforted me much,
<pb n="458" facs="tcp:100776:266"/>
to remaine, where I were vtterly vnknowne; but my Ghoſtlie Father, would neuer permit it.</p>
            <p>Theſe feares did much depriue me of Libertie of Spirit; but I came to vnderſtand afterward, that it was no good Humilitie, ſince it gaue me ſuch a deale of diſquiet. And our Lord, vpon that occaſion, taught me this truth, that, if, <note n="*" place="margin">
                  <hi>This is a very great Truth; but the Accent muſt be put, vpon the vvord</hi> Indeed.</note> 
               <hi>indeed,</hi> I were reſolued, and aſſured, that nothing at all of mine, were good, but that it were all, of God, it would follow, that iuſt ſo, as I would not be ſor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rie, to heare other perſons praiſed, but rather would be greatly comforted, and ioyed, that our Lord did ſhew himſelf in them: So neither would I be ſorrie, that his workes might be alſo ſeen, in me.</p>
            <p>I fell alſo, vpon another extreame; and it was, to beg of Almighty God (yea, and I made particular Prayer to this purpoſe) that, when by accide<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t, anie perſon ſhould enter into good opinion of me, his Diuine Maieſtie would be pleaſed, to declare my Sinnes to him; to the end, that the man might ſee, how abſolutly without anie merit of mine, it pleaſed our B. Lord to doe me Fauours. And this, doe I euer much deſire, though my Ghoſtlie Father haue commanded me, <note n="*" place="margin">And though she should haue conti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nued to aske it, I dare ſay our Lord vvould not haue graunted it.</note> not to aske it. But hither<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to, till very lately, if I chanced to ſee anie perſon, who thought extraordinarily well of me, I tooke the beſt meanes I could find, by ſome deuiſe, or other, to tell him my ſinnes; and thus I concea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ued my ſelf, to find eaſe. But yet heerby, they haue put me into a kind of ſcruple, that this pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceeded
<pb n="459" facs="tcp:100776:266"/>
not in me, from humilitie; and that it ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther grew from a temptation; in regard, that ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nie came to me, and I ſeemed, to haue coſened them all. But though it be very true that they are indeed deceaued, if they thought, that there was anie goodnes in me, yet had I no deſire at all, to deceaue them; nor did I euer pretend anie ſuch thing; but that our Bleſſed Lord might haue per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>haps permitted it. And ſo, for the ſelf-ſame reaſon. I would neuer haue imparted anie priuate acci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent of mine, which was no Sinne, euen to my verie Ghoſtlie Fathers themſelues, vnleſſe I had found it, to be wholy neceſſarie; for I ſhould otherwiſe, haue had much ſcruple to doe it.</p>
            <p>But now I ſee very well, that all theſe little <note n="*" place="margin">A muſt certaine truth.</note> feares, and troubles, &amp; ſuperfluities of ill-ground<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed Humilities, doe ſauour very ſufficiently, of imperfection, and proceed from the immorti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fication of the Soule. For, to a Soule, which is well reſigned, into the hands of Almightie God, it doth not import her a iott more, that they ſhould ſpeake well of her, then ill; if once ſhe vnderſtand well, and home, (forasmuch as God will giue her that grace) that ſhe hath nothing at all, of her ſelf; but let her confide in him, who imparts it, and ſhe ſhall know, in time, why he diſcouers it. And, in the meane while, let her pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pare her ſelf, for perſecution; for, it will moſt cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainly ariue, in ſuch an Age as this, vpon anie ſuch perſon, as to whome our Lord will haue it knowne, that he doth her ſuch Fauours as theſe.
<pb n="460" facs="tcp:100776:267"/>
For, vpon anie ſuch Soule as this, a thouſand watchfull eyes will be caſt; whereas there will not be one, vpon a whole thouſand of ſuch other Soules, as be of a contrarie making. And there is really much cauſe to feare this; and it ought to haue been my feare, that the other was <note n="*" place="margin">A vviſe, &amp; ſolid Truth.</note> not Humilitie, but Puſillanimitie. For, a Soule, which Almightie God permits to be expoſed thus, to the ſight of the world, may expect to be a Martyr of the ſame world; for, if ſhe will not dye to it, ſhe ſhall dye, by it.</p>
            <p>For my part, I really ſee nothing, in this thing, called World, which ſeemes good to me, except only, that it giues not way, that worthie, and good people, ſhould be permitted to doe ill, without being murmured at, for their labour; and by this meanes, they grow to perfect themſelues. But there is need of more fortitude, and courage, for a man, who is yet imperfect, to walke-on towards a way of perfection, then euen to be inſtantly, made a Martyr. For, Perfection is not ſo quickly gotten, vnleſſe it be by ſome ſuch per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon, as to whome our Bleſſed Lord may vouch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſafe that Fauour, by way of a particular priuiledge. But the world diſcerning once, that a man begin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nes to aſpire to doe well, will needs account him perfect, at an inſtant; and then will it preſently ſee anie fault in him, if he haue anie, though it be a thouſand leagues off. Yea and perhaps, that, which they hold to be a fault in him, ſhall indeed, be a vertue; and the other, who condemnes him, and
<pb n="461" facs="tcp:100776:267"/>
is wont, peraduenture, to doe the ſelf-ſame thing, by an impulſe of vice, will iudge ill, of it, in ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther. So that, according to his dictamen, that other man, ſhould neither eate, nor ſleepe, nor euen, as it were, draw his breath. And the more alſo they eſteem ſuch perſons, the more apt are they to forget, that, how perfect ſoeuer their Soules be, and how abſolutly ſoeuer they tread the whole world vnder their feet, yet ſtill, they are in the Bodie, and liue vpon Earth, and are ſubiect to the miſeries of their condition. And therefore ſtill I ſay, that there is need of a great deale of courage; becauſe, ſuch men haue a minde, that the poore Soule, which hath not yet begunne to walke, ſhould already fly. She hath not yet ouer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come, and mortifyed her paſſions; and yet theſe men will needs expect, that ſhe ſhould remaine as entire, and firme, as they haue read of Saints themſelues, after they were confirmed in grace. The particulars, which occurr in this kind, are to giue a man cauſe to wonder; and withall, euen to afflict vs to the hart, to ſee ſo manie Soules turne back againe, which know not (poore Crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures, as they are) what ſhift to make for them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelues; and ſo, doe I beleiue, that mine had alſo done, if our Lord, with ſuch an abundance of mercie, had not diſpatched all that buſines, alone. For, till he, out of his owne goodnes, did ſo, your Reuerence will already haue ſeen, that, on my part, there was nothing at all, but only riſing, and falling, ouer and ouer. I would faine expreſſe this
<pb n="462" facs="tcp:100776:268"/>
point, home; for I beleiue, that manie Soules, grow to be abuſed, and deceiued, becauſe they haue a minde to fly, before Almightie God giue them wings.</p>
            <p>I conceiue, that I haue formerly vſed this Compariſon; but it comes alſo very well in, heer; for I find, that manie Soules, are much afflicted, vpon this occaſion. As namely, when they be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginne, with great deſires, and reſolutions, to goe forward in the way of vertue (and ſome doe euen giue-ouer all, for loue thereof, forasmuch as concernes exteriour things) and yet, ſee more aduantagious effects, and fruits of ſuch vertues, as our Lord hath infuſed into the Soules of others, who are more proficient, then into theirs; and that they cannot performe certaine things, which are ſet downe in thoſe Bookes, which are written of Prayer, and Contemplation, which men are aduiſed to vſe, ſo to make themſelues aſcend vp, the better, and the higher, to this dignitie. And, in fine, when they cannot inſtantly, obtaine theſe things, they diſcomfort, and afflict themſelues. As, for example, not to care a ſtraw, if anie bodie ſhould ſpeake ill of vs; but rather to take more contentment in it, then when they praiſe vs; To haue very little eſteeme of our honour; To be perfectly vntyed from the care of kindred, and friends; and not to deſire, to conuerſe with them, but rather to be wearie of their companie, vnleſſe they be perſons of Prayer; And manie other things of this kind, which muſt, in my opinion, come
<pb n="463" facs="tcp:100776:268"/>
from the guift of Almightie God, becauſe I hold them for Supernaturall bleſſings, and very contra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rie to our owne Naturall inclination. And there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore, let them not be afflicted, but put their truſt in our Lord; that ſo, what now they haue in deſire, his Diuine Maieſtie may be pleaſed, to giue them afterward, with effect, and fruit, by meanes of Prayer, and by their doing, on their part, what they can. For, it is a moſt neceſſarie thing, for this weake, and poore Nature of ours, to place a great confidence in our B. Lord; &amp; not to put our ſelues out of hart, nor to thinke, but that, if we will proceed with courage, we ſhall be victorious; and, becauſe I haue much experience heerof, I will speake a word or two, by way of aduiſe, to your Reuerence. For, you muſt not thinke (though it may appeare, as if it were true) that a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nie vertue is already gained, vnleſſe it be firſt com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pared, and experimented, by the Vice, which is contrarie to it. And we muſt alwaies remaine doubtfull, and ſuſpitious, and not caſt off our cares, as long as we are the owners of our liues. For, our weakneſſes ſtick cloſe, and faſt to vs; vnleſſe (as I was ſaying before) the whole benefit be imparted to vs, by Diuine grace; to the end, that we may know, what all the things of this life, are worth; and that there is neuer anie ſuch thing, as can be tearmed all, but in companie of manie dangers.</p>
            <p>It ſeemed to me, ſome few yeares agoe, that not only I was not inordinatly tyed, to the loue
<pb n="464" facs="tcp:100776:269"/>
of anie of my kindred, but rather that I was wea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rie of them; and it is really very true, that there were times, when I would not ſo much as endure their conuerſation. But yet afterward, there oc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>curred a certaine buſines of much importance, which obliged me to remaine, with a certaine Siſter of mine, whome formerly I had loued, with very extraordinarie affection. And now, being come againe, to conuerſe with her, we ſuited not ſo very well, with one another. For, though ſhe were better, then I, yet being of a different con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dition from mine, in regard that ſhe was married, the conuerſation was not alwaies that, which I could haue wiſhed; and therefore, I liked to be alone, as much as conueniently I might. But yet, after a while, I found, that her troubles, and af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>faires, brought me more reſentment, and care, by much, then ſuch others did, as belonged to anie Chriſtian neighbour of mine, at large; and this gaue me ſome little diſguſt, againſt my ſelf; for, ſo, in fine, I came to know, that I was not ſo very free, and vntyed, as I had formerly conceaued; and that moreouer, I was to haue auoided the occaſion, to the end, that ſo, this vertue, which our Lord had begunne to giue me, might haue gotten ſtrength; and I haue procured, through his Fauour, to pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceed in this manner, euer ſince.</p>
            <p>When our Lord beginnes to impart a vertue to a Soule, it is to be held in great account; and by no meanes, are we to expoſe it, to the danger of being loſt. So is it in thoſe things, which concerne
<pb n="465" facs="tcp:100776:269"/>
reputation, and honour; and ſo alſo, in others. And your Reuerence may well beleiue, that not all they, and we, who eſteem our ſelues, to be abſolutly vntyed from all things, are yet ſo, indeed; and we haue need enough, not to be ſlack, or negligent heerin. For, whatſoeuer perſon there be, who feeles anie care at all, of anie one point of Honour, in himſelf, let him beleiue me, if he meane to profit in Spirit, that there is euer a cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taine tye, at the end of it; and it is, by ſuch a kind of chaine, as that there is no File in the world, but God, and Prayer, and very much endeauour, on our part, which will poſſibly be able, to deuide it; &amp; it ſeemes to be ſo faſt a knot, that I am amazed, to ſee the miſcheif, which it brings.</p>
            <p>Sometimes I ſee certaine perſons, who ſeem to be euen Saints, by their workes; for, they doe ſo very manie, and ſo great ones, that the world doth euen admire them, and exclame, after this manner; Deare God! and how comes it to paſſe, that ſuch a Soule as that, doth ſtill inhabit the Earth? Is he not already, at the verie top of Perfection? What is this? And what can detaine ſuch a man, from being a direct, and downe-right Saint, who doth ſo great things for God? But my anſwer to this queſtion, is, That this man, hath yet, perhaps, ſome little conſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deration, &amp; care, of preſeruing ſome point of Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour, for himſelf; yea, and the worſt of this buſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nes, is, that he will, by no meanes, beleiue, that, in verie deed, there is anie ſuch thing. And that happens, becauſe ſometimes, the Diuel makes
<pb n="466" facs="tcp:100776:270"/>
him conceiue, that he is euen obliged, to haue a great care of it. Well; yet let them harken to mee, I beſeech them; and <note n="*" place="margin">Exer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciſe of Prayer, and loue of Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour, agree not vvell together.</note> euen for the loue of our Bleſſed Lord, I begg of them, that they will be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leiue this poore little miſerable Ant, whome our Lord commands to ſpeake; That, vnleſſe they free themſelues from this Caterpiller, though perhaps it may not deſtroy the whole Tree, becauſe ſome other vertues doe ſtill, peraduenture, remaine, yet euen all thoſe verie vertues, will be worme<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eaten; nor, will it euer be a beautifull Tree; nor will it either thriue, or proſper, in it ſelf; no, nor yet ſo much as ſuffer ſuch others to thriue, and proſper, as ſhall grow neer it; for, the fruit of Good-Example, which it can giue, will not be wholeſome, or ſound; nor laſt long. And I ſay, and ſay againe, that, when there is anie point of Honour to be maintained, how little ſoeuer that may be, it is like the Stopp of the Organ, whereof, when the Point, or Compaſſe, is in fault, the whole Muſick is alſo then, in diſorder. It is a vice, which is alwaies procuring hurt enough, to the Soule; but in the way of Prayer, it is the verie peſtilence it ſelf.</p>
            <p>For then, we are going to procure to ioyne our ſelues, by way of Vnion, with Almightie God; and we ſay, that we diſpoſe our ſelues, to obſerue, and follow the Councells of Chriſt our Lord, whome we find to be all loaden with in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iuries, and falſe teſtimonies, againſt him; and yet we muſt, forſooth, be carefull, to hold-vp
<pb n="467" facs="tcp:100776:270"/>
our owne reputation, and honour, very right, and ſtreight. But it is not poſſible, euer to ariue, at that iourneys end, without going by the ſame way, which he went. And our Bleſſed Lord comes approaching then, to a Soule, when we endeauour to concurr with him, and procure to depart, and deſcend, in manie things, from that, which is euen our right.</p>
            <p>But now ſome perhaps will ſay, I know not wherein that ſhould be; and I haue nothing of this kind, to offer vp, for his ſake. Yet, for my part, I am apt to beleiue, that, whoſoeuer hath indeed ſo generous a reſolution, as this, his Diuine Maieſtie, will ordaine him, ſo manie different wayes, for the gayning of this vertue, that per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>haps, he would not wiſh, to haue had ſo manie. Let vs all therefore, put our hands to worke; for, I am able to tell you, that the Nothings, and poore Littleneſſes, or ſome of them, at leaſt, (which are thoſe miſerable Strawes, whereof I haue ſpoken, and which I caſt into the fire; for, I am fitt for no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing els) are all admitted, and accepted, by our Bleſſed Lord; and let him be praiſed for euer.</p>
            <p>Amongſt the reſt of my imperfections, I was ſubiect to this, for one. I had very little knowledge of the Breuiarie, and of all that, which was to be performed in the Quire; and this hapned, by my being ſo very careleſſe, and giuen to vanities; and the while, I ſaw other Nouices, who were able to haue inſtructed me. Now, I forbore to aske them anie queſtions, for feare leaſt they
<pb n="468" facs="tcp:100776:271"/>
ſhould know of my ignorance. But ſhortly after, a good example came before me (for, this mercie, is vſually vouchſafed, by Almightie God) and ſo, when he had a little opened mine eyes, I would then be content to aske, whatſoeuer I knew not moſt perfectly well, though for the moſt part, I knew it; and thus, both I loſt, forſooth, no ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour, by the bargaine, and afterward, it ſeemed to me, that our Lord was pleaſed, to giue me a better memorie. I alſo knew, the Singing part, very ill; and I was troubled, if I did not learne, what I was bidden; yet, not this, becauſe I failed, in what I ſhould haue performed, as in the preſence of our Lord (for, that had been vertue in me) but in regard, that there were ſo manie, who heard me; and thus, I was ſo diſordered, vpon the meer point of looking, forſooth, to mine ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour, that really, I acquitted my ſelf much worſe, then I knew how to haue done, before. But af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terward, I thought it fitter, to tell them plainely, that I could not doe that well, which, indeed, I could not doe. At the firſt, I had ſome difficultie alſo, euen in this; but afterward, I tooke con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tentment in doing it. And really, it is very true, that, when once a bodie beginnes not to care, that ſhe be knowne not to know a thing, ſhe ſhall performe it much better. And when this baſe, vglie Honour, is once put out of the way (this Honour, I meane, which euerie bodie places, where, and in what he will) by theſe Nothings, which are really Nothing (and I am ſure, I am
<pb n="469" facs="tcp:100776:271"/>
Nothing enough, whome ſuch a Bable, could put to ſo much paine) I was able to doe thoſe things, better; and thus, by performing ſuch poore acts, and ſuch miſerable little things, as theſe, his Diuine Maieſtie vouchſafes to giue them ſtrength, and value, as hauing been performed, for his ſake. He alſo helpes vs on, towards greater things; and ſo did it happen to me, in matters concerning Humilitie, by my ſeeing, that they all profited, except my ſelf; for, I was neuer good, for anie thing. But ònly, when they went from the Quire, I would ſtay to fold-vp their Mantles; for it ſeem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed no leſſe to me, then that they were, as ſo many Angells themſelues, who ſung the praiſes of Almightie God; and ſtill I vſed to doe it, till they came to heare of it; but then, I was not a little a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhamed. For, my vertue did not ariue ſo farre, as to deſire, that they might know of it; not yet, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe I was humble, but only, that they might not laugh at me, for my labour, and for my being ſo abſolutly good for nothing.</p>
            <p>O my deare Lord; how meer a ſcorne, and ſhame is it, to ſee ſo great wickednes, as mine; and find me reckon-vp ſuch poore, and paltrie little graines of ſand, as theſe, which yet alſo, I raiſed not out of the earth, for thy honour, and ſeruice, but all was wrapt vp, in a thouſand miſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries; for, the water of thy Grace, had not yet ſprung, and boyled-vp in mee, to make them riſe. O thou, my deare Creatour, that I had ſomething of worth, and ſubſtance, which I might recount,
<pb n="470" facs="tcp:100776:272"/>
and preſent to thee, amongſt ſo manie ſinnes of mine; ſince I am commanded, to relate thoſe great Fauours, which I haue receaued from thee! It is true, O my Lord, and my God, that I know not, how this hart of mine, can endure it; not how anie Creature, who ſhall euer reade this Storie, can faile to abhorre me, when he ſees ſuch im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>menſe Fauours, as thine, ſo ill acknowledged, and thy ſelf, ſo ill ſerued, for them; and that I am no more aſhamed, to relate, in fine, theſe little ſeruices, as if they were mine. And yet, O my deare Lord, I am aſhamed, but only, my not haue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing anie thing els, to recount, with anie colour, of being mine owne, makes me vnfold theſe, ſo baſe beginnings of mine; to the end, that, who<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſoeuer may haue layd his owne, more ſolidly, and ſubſtantially vp, for thy ſeruice, may well haue good hope, by the meanes; ſince he, who hath vouchſafed to accept my poore beginnings, in part of payment, will certainly receaue thoſe o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers, better, which are greater. I humbly beſeech his Diuine Maieſtie, to giue me grace, at length, that I may not ſtill continue in theſe things, which are but beginnings;</p>

            <p>AFter a long time, when our Bleſſed Lord had already done me manie of thoſe Fauours, which I haue heer related; as others alſo, which were very great; I found one day, whilſt I was in Prayer, though I could not tell, how, that I was placed in Hell. And I vnderſtood, that our Lord was pleaſed, that I ſhould ſee the place, which the <note n="*" place="margin">This is not to be litterally vnder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtood; for the Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uell can prepare no place for a Soule in Hell, but by the Decree of Almighty God, vpon the particular Iudgement giuen at the death of the Party.</note> Diuels had prepared for me, and which I had deſerued for my <note n="*" place="margin">The Sinnes of Ingratitude, diſcorreſpondence, and inordinate af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fection to Creatures, vvhich she did committ; and the greater and mor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tall Sinnes, vvhich she vvould moſt certainly haue committed, if the Mercy of our Bleſſed Lord, had not preuented, and vvithheld her.</note> Sinnes. This laſted but a very little ſpace of time; but yet, if I ſhould liue manie yeares, I hold it for an impoſſible thing, that euer I ſhould be able, to forget it.</p>

The entrie thereof, ſeemed <note n="*" place="margin">Hell is repreſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted to her in Spirit, after a moſt ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tile man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner, and it vvas shevved to her, and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcribed by her, in ſuch ſort, as that ſuch Creatu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>res, may be capa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of, as are indued not only vvith Mindes, but vvith Bodyes.</note> to me, to be, after the manner, of a long, and ſtraite Lane; or rather, as if it had been, a low, narrow, long, and darke Ouen. The ground ſeemed to be, as if it had been like water, all thickned with durt; and it was both very filthie, and of a moſt peſtilentiall ſmell, and had a multitude of loathſome vermine, as flyes, and wormes, and ſuch other vglie creatu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>res, in it. At the end of it, there was a certaine hollow place, as if it had been a kind of a little Preſſe, in a wall; into which, I ſaw my ſelf crow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded, with great conſtraint. Now all that, was euen delightfull to the ſight, in compariſon of what I felt there; and this, which I haue ſayd of it already, I alſo find to be very imperfectly deſcribed. But, as for the Feeling part, the verie beginning to ſay what it was, is a thing, which can neither be well, no nor euen almoſt at all, related, as it was indeed; in regard that I felt a certaine fire, in my verie Soule, though yet I know not, how to declare it, as indeed it was. For, all thoſe almoſt inſupporta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble torments, which I haue felt, with all extremi tie, in this life, and whereof the Phyſitians are wont to affirme, that euen in the Corporeall way, they are the greateſt, which can be ſuffered in this world; (as namely, that ſhrinking-vp of all my Sinnewes, when I inſtantly grew lame by it; beſides manie other torments, in ſeuerall kindes; as alſo that I haue been vexed much, by the Diuel) are all no more, then abſolutly iuſt nothing, in compariſon of what I felt, in that place; beſides
<pb n="473" facs="tcp:100776:273"/>
my knowing, (with all this) that no part of it, was euer to ceaſe, but to continue, without euer haue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing an end. And yet, euen all this, which I haue ſayd, is alſo nothing, in compariſon of that con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinuall agonizing of the Soule, that preſſing, that ſtifling, which is ſo very ſenſible an affliction, to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>geather with that deſperate kind of diſcontent, and diſguſt, and repining, which I am, no way, able to expreſſe. For, to ſay, that it is a continuall tearing of the Soule into fitters, is to ſay little; ſince, in that caſe, it ſeemes, that it muſt be ſome other bodie, who teares it; but, in this, the Soule it ſelf, is the verie Executioner, which euen teares it ſelf. There is, beſides all that, another ſtrange Ingredient, which is, that interiour kind of fire, and that vnſpeakable deſpaire, vpon thoſe intol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lerable torments, and ſorrowes. I ſaw not, who it was, that inflicted theſe things; but, me thought, I found my ſelf to be ſliced, and minced, and preſt, and burnt, all at once. And I ſay, and ſay againe, that that interiour fire, and deſpaire, is the very worſt of it all. Whilſt I was in this moſt peſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tilentiall place, and that, without anie poſſibilitie of euer ſo much, as once hoping for anie comfort at all, there was no ſuch thing, to be thought of, as ſitting, or extending my ſelf; nor is there anie place voyd, to receaue one; though yet they had put me into that thing, which is like a hole in a wall; becauſe euen thoſe verie walls, which are alſo moſt hideous to the ſight, doe euen preſſe their verie ſelues cloſe, towards, and vpon one
<pb n="474" facs="tcp:100776:274"/>
another; and euerie thing there, helpes to choake. There is alſo no light in that place; but all is groſſe, and euen palpable darknes. For my part, I vnder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtand not, how this can be; for, with hauing no light at all, yet all that, which may be able to giue anie vexation to the Sight, is diſcerned, and ſeen. Our Lord was not pleaſed, at that time, that I ſhould ſee anie more of Hell; but afterward I had another Viſion, of moſt fearefull things, and of the puniſhment of certaine particular vices. And, forasmuch as I might be able to diſcerne, and iudge of, by the ſight, theſe ſeemed to be euen more hideous, then the former; but yet, in regard, that I felt not the paine of it, they made me not ſo much afrayd. For in this other preſent Viſion, our Lord was pleaſed, that I ſhould really feele thoſe torments, and afflictions in Spirit, euen as if my verie Bodie, had been ſuffering them there.</p>
            <p>
               <note n="*" place="margin">The excellent fruits, vvhich this Saint did ga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther from this great Fauour, vvhich ſeems to be the ſole cauſe vvhy our B. Lord vvas pleaſed to impare this Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uour.</note> I know not, how all this could be; but yet I vnderſtood well enough, that it was a very great Fauour; and that our Lord was pleaſed, that I ſhould diſcerne, as euen by the verie ſight of mine owne eyes, from whence his great mercie, had deliuered me. For it is nothing, to haue heard talke of it; nor that, at other times, I had conſider<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed ſeuerall ſorts of torments; (though yet I did it not often; for I liked not that, very well, in regard of the feare it gaue me) nor yet, that the Diuels are wont to teare men in peices, with hot pincers; nor anie other thing, whereof I had read; for, all, in fine, is nothing, if once it be compared to this;
<pb n="475" facs="tcp:100776:274"/>
Since this is wholy another kind of thing; and the torments of this world, (compared with this) are no more, then a meer Picture, in com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pariſon of the Life; the verie burning, which is felt in this world, being but a verie trifle, in reſpect of that other. For my part, I remained aſtoniſhed, and amazed at it, and ſo I am, euen whilſt I am writing theſe things, though it hapned to me ſix yeares agoe. And it is a moſt reall truth, that euen now, in the verie place, where I am but thinking of them, the naturall heate of my bodie, begin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nes to faile me, euen for verie feare. Not doe I euer remember, what paſſed then; but that all my afflictions, and troubles, and whatſoeuer can be ſuffered in this life, ſeemed nothing to me; and ſo alſo, me thinkes, it ſeemes, that, in part, we complaine heer, without reaſon. And therefore I ſay againe, that this was one of the greateſt Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uours, that I euer receaued, in my whole life, at the hands of our Lord. For it <note n="*" place="margin">The great be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nefit of this Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uour.</note> hath benefited me very much, both towards the making me looſe all feare, and care, concerning the tribula<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions, and contradictions of this life; as alſo, to giue me ſtrength, towards the enduring them; and finally, to render thankes to our Bleſſed Lord, for deliuering me (as now I may hope) from thoſe terrible, and perpetuall torments.</p>
            <p>Since that time, as I was ſaying, there is no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing, which ſeemes not eaſie to me, in co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>pariſon of one moment of that, which is to be ſuffered there. And I was in a very great wonder, that,
<pb n="476" facs="tcp:100776:275"/>
hauing ſo often read diuerſe Bookes, which giue me ſome notice of a part of the torments of Hell, I feared them ſo little, and held them in ſo ſmall account, conſidering in what caſe I was then, and how it was poſſible for me, to receaue con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tentment in anie ſuch thing, as finally was to car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rie me on, to ſo wretched a place, as that is. Be thou eternally Bleſſed, O my God; for, how well haſt thou made it appeare, that thou louedſt me incomparably better, then I doe my ſelf? How often, O my deare Lord, haſt thou deliuered me; from that darke, and horrible Dungeon? and how often haue I returned, to caſt my ſelf in, thi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, againe, euen againſt thy will? From hence alſo I got a facilitie, to be in very great paine, for the manie Soules of theſe Lutherans, which are condemned to Hell; and eſpecially, becauſe they had once been members of the Holy Catholique Church, by their Baptiſme. I gained alſo great impulſes, to doe good to Soules; and really, it ſeemes to me, to be very certaine, that, for the ſauing of anie of them, from ſo greiuous, and e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uerlaſting torments, I could ſuffer manie deaths, with a very good will. For, I conſider, that if we ſee a perſon in this world, whome we loue, vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dergoe anie great affliction, or paine, it ſeemes, that euen our naturall diſpoſition inuites vs, to haue compaſſion of the caſe; and ſo much as that paine is greater, ſo much the more. And therefore, now, to ſee a Soule, which is, for euer, to be en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chained, to the enduring of that ſupreame afflic<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion,
<pb n="477" facs="tcp:100776:275"/>
and miſerie of all miſeries, who ſhall be able to beare it, and what hart, can euer brooke it, without ſtrange trouble? And ſince we are moued heer, to ſo much compaſſion of men, whoſe mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeries haue yet a tearme prefixed, (and at the fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>theſt, they are to end with their liues) how ſhall we be able to get patience, for thinking of the infinit torments of thoſe others, conſidering, what a huge number of Soules, the Diuel is daily car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rying into Hell? This conſideration alſo makes me deſire, that, in a buſines of ſo mightie impor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance, we may not be ſatisfyed with leſſe, then the doeing of the very vttermoſt we can, on our part; and that we leaue nothing at all, vnattemp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted, to ſecure our ſelues by that meanes; and I humbly beſeech our Bleſſed Lord, to giue vs all, his grace, for this purpoſe.</p>
            <p>When I conſider, that, howſoeuer I were for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>merly moſt wicked, yet had I ſome little care, to ferue Almightie God; not yet, did I then commit certaine things, which are taken and ſwallowed downe, by the world, as familiarly, as to turne the hand. And, with this, I endured huge ſick<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſes; and I did it, with that great patience, which our Lord was pleaſed to giue me, for that purpoſe; and I was alſo not inclined to murmure, and detract, or to ſpeake hardly of anie Creature; nay, it ſeemes to me, as if I ſcarce had power, to with anie bodie anie ill; nor was I couetous, nor enuious, (for anie thing, that I could euer remem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber) at leaſt, to anie ſuch proportion, as might
<pb n="478" facs="tcp:100776:276"/>
reſult to the great offence of Almightie God. And ſome other things alſo there are, wherein (though I were very wicked) I had vſually, the feare of Almightie God before me. And yet, notwith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtanding all this, I ſee where the Diuels <note n="*" place="margin">
                  <hi>Vide ſupra fol:</hi> 471.</note> had ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken vp, and prouided my lodgeing; and it is true, that, conſidering what my faults had been, it ſeemed to me, that I yet deſerued more puniſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment.</p>
            <p>But howſoeuer, vpon the whole matter, I de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clare, that it was a moſt horrible torment; and and that it is a dangerous thing, that the Soule ſhould take contentment, and be at reſt, which is falling, euerie minute, into Mortall Sinne. Nay rather, for the loue of Almightie God, let vs re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moue all the occaſions thereof; for, our Lord will help vs all, as he hath done me. And I humbly beſeech his Diuine Maieſtie, not to giue ouer, to hold me faſt, in his hand, leaſt, if he doe, I returne to fall; for, in that caſe, I ſee already, what is to become of me for euer; but I beſeech our B. Lord againe, not to ſuffer it, euen for his owne mercies ſake, Amen.</p>
            <p>But now, after my ſeeing all this, as alſo manie other great things, and ſecrets, which our Lord, through his owne mercie, was pleaſed to ſhew me, concerning the Glorie, which is deſigned in the next life, for the good, and the Torments, for the wicked; and I procuring now, to light vpon ſome way, or meanes, whereby I might doe Pen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nance, for ſo much ill, as I had committed, and
<pb n="479" facs="tcp:100776:276"/>
might be able alſo, to doe ſomewhat, towards the obtaining of ſo great a good, I deſired, euen to fly out of the ſight of mankind, and now at length, once for all, to deuide my ſelfe from the world, and to part from it. And my hart would now be quiet no longer, but yet was not that diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quiet of mine, anie troubleſome kind of thing, but rather of contentment, and guſt; and it was euident, that it came from Almightie God; and that his Diuine Maieſtie had giuen heate enough, to this Soule of mine, for the diſgeſting of other, and ſtronger meates, then ſhe had formerly taken. <note n="*" place="margin">A ſvveet Effect, of a ſad Cauſe.</note> And now, I beganne to conſider, what I might poſſibly he able to doe, for Almightie God; and the firſt thing, I thought, was to follow that firſt Call, which his Diuine Maieſtie had giuen me, to leade a Religious Life; and that, by the Obſeruance of my Rule, with the greateſt per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fection, that I could practiſe. And though there were, in the Monaſterie, wherein I found my ſelf at that time, manie Seruants of Almightie God, by whome he was very much ſerued, in that place, yet in regard, they wanted temporall meanes, manie of the Religious woemen, were caſt into a kind of neceſſitie, to goe abroad ſometimes, for releife of the Houſe; but yet they did it ſo, as to paſſe, with all kind of chaſtitie, and pietie. And beſides, that Houſe was not founded according to the firſt rigour of the Rule; but only the ſame Rule, was obſerued, in conformitie with all the reſt of the Order, according to the Bulles of Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>laxation,
<pb n="480" facs="tcp:100776:277"/>
and diſpenſation. There were alſo, ſome other inconueniences; and beſides, it ſeemed to me, that the place was of much Regalo, in regard, that it was, both large, and pleaſant. But eſpeci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally, the inconuenience of going ſometimes out of the Monaſterie, was growne to be a very great one for me; though formerly, I had been one, who made moſt familiar vſe of it my ſelf; in regard that ſometimes, ſome perſons, whome the Superiours (being importuned) could not well refuſe, tooke contentment, that I ſhould accom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>panie them, who went abroad. And, by this meanes, according to the vſe, which was held, I might grow by degrees, to remaine very little in the Monaſterie. The Diuel alſo would be ſure to helpe, to be partly a meanes, that I might re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maine little at home; for alwaies, by my impart<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to ſome of the Religious there, thoſe good things, which I had learnt of others, with whome I vſed to conuerſe, they receaued much aduantage and good. But yet once, being there with a cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taine perſon, it hapned, that ſhe ſayd, both to me, and others: What ſay you, if we ſhould become, like thoſe Religious woemen, who goe bare<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>foot; for perhaps, it may be poſſible, in time, to make ſome Monaſterie of that kind? But now I, hauing alſo theſe verie ſame deſires, beganne to treat the buſines, with that Widdow, my Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>panion, and Friend, of whome I ſpake before; who had alſo the ſame deſire with me. Vpon this, ſhe beganne to caſt, how to endue it with Rent;
<pb n="481" facs="tcp:100776:277"/>
but I came quickly to find, that there was no great probabilitie of that; though the deſire, which we had thereof, made vs yet beleiue, that it might perhaps, take effect. But I, on the other ſide, (finding great contentment, in the Houſe, where I was, becauſe it was much according to mine owne minde; and the Cell, wherein I liued, was of very great conuentences for me,) ſuſpend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed my ſelf, from being earneſt, in the execution of that other deſigne; though yet, we did reſolue, to recommend it, in particular manner, to Al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mightie God. And one day, as ſoone as I had Communicated, his Diuine Maieſtie command<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed me, in earneſt manner, to endeauour it, to the verie vtter moſt of my power. And he was pleaſed to make me great promiſes, that the Monaſterie ſhould not faile to be made; and that he would be ſerued much in it; and that it ſhould be called by the name of <hi>S. Ioſeph;</hi> and that himſelf, would keepe vs ſafe, at one of the gates, and his Mother our B. Ladie, at the other; and that Chriſt our Lord would continue with vs; and that the place ſhould proue, to be euen a Starre, which would yeild great brightnes, and ſplendour, of it ſelf; and that, though other Religious Orders, were then relax<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, men muſt not thinke, that he was but little ſerued by them; and what ſhould become of the world, if it were not for Religious perſons? And that I ſhould tell my Ghoſtlie Father, that he had commanded me all this; and that he wiſhed him, not to oppoſe it, nor to diuert me from it. And
<pb n="482" facs="tcp:100776:278"/>
this Viſion, which our Bleſſed Lord was pleaſed to giue me, was followed by ſo great effects, that the <hi>Speech,</hi> which was vſed therein, was ſuch, and vttered in ſuch a manner, that I could not poſſibly doubt, but that it was he. How ſoeuer, I was ſtill, in extreame paine, becauſe the great diſquiets, and troubles, which I was ſure the thing would coſt, did partly repreſent themſelues, to me; and conſidering, how extreamly well content I was, in that firſt Houſe; and though formerly I had treated of this other buſines, yet it was not with anie ſuch reſolution, and certaintie, as if it might be ſure, to take effect.</p>
            <p>Now, heer it ſeemed to me, that the reward ſet it ſelf inſtantly before me, for the doing it; but yet, when I ſaw, that it was likelie to be a thing of very great diſquiet, and trouble, I was ſtill in a kind of doubt, what I would finally doe. And yet, they were ſo manie ſeuerall times, that our Lord renewed his <hi>Speech</hi> to me, vpon this ſubiect, (repreſenting ſo manie cauſes, and reaſons, for it) that I ſaw clearly enough, that it was his will. So that now, I thought no more of anie thing els, but only to acquaint my Ghoſtlie Father, with it; and ſo I gaue him all that, which had occurred, in writing. As for him, he durſt not reſolutly will me, to giue it ouer; but ſaw, that there was little apparance, to carrie it through, according to the diſcourſe of naturall reaſon; in regard, that my Companion, and Freind, who was the onlie per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon, who was to doe it, had very little, or no
<pb n="483" facs="tcp:100776:278"/>
meanes, to effect it. He wiſhed me, to treat of it with the Prelate, who was my Superiour; and that I ſhould doe therein, what he ordained. But I ſpake not of theſe Viſions, with that Prelate; but that Ladie treated with him, and told him, that ſhe deſired to erect a new Monaſterie; and the Prouinciall did very gladly giue way; for he was a freind of all Religious Obſeruance, and Pietie; and ſo he afforded all the fauour, which was needfull; and told her, that he would admit, and accept the Houſe. They ſpake then, of the Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uenue, which it was to haue; and we neuer in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clined, to let it conſiſt of more, then Thirteen Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligious; &amp; this, for manie reaſons. But, before we beganne to treat of the matter, thus farre, we wrote to the holie man, <hi>Fray Pedro de Alcantara,</hi> and acquainted him, with all that, which paſſed; and he counſailed vs to proceed in this deſigne; and he ſent vs his opinion, vpon the whole buſines.</p>
            <p>But now, this purpoſe of ours, was no ſooner knowne ouer the Towne, then there did inſtant<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly grow, to be ſuch a perſecution againſt vs, as cannot be written, in few words. The ſcoffes, the icares, the laughing, the ſaying that it was a Foo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lerie, and ſenſeleſſe toy; That, for my part, I was well enough in my Monaſterie; but for my Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>panion, and freind, they caſt ſuch a loade of per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſecution vpon her, that they euen ouerlayd her. As for me, I knew not, what to doe; for me thought, that they had partly ſome reaſon.</p>
            <p>But being thus diſtreſſed, and recommending
<pb n="484" facs="tcp:100776:279"/>
my ſelf one day, to Almightie God, his Diuine Maieſtie beganne to comfort, and encourage me, and told me, that now I might ſee, through what difficulties thoſe Saints had paſſed, who had founded the Religious Orders of the Church; and that we were to paſſe through manie more perſecutions, then I could imagine; but that yet, we ſhould not be troubled, at all. He told me alſo ſome things, which I was to deliuer to my Companion; and the thing, at which I wondred moſt, was, that inſtantly we were comforted, in reſpect of all that, which was paſt; and encoura<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ged for all that, which was to be future. And it is certaine, that there was not, in all that Towne, anie one perſon of Prayer; nay, in fine, there was ſcarce anie one at all, who did not oppoſe vs, at that time, and who thought not this deſigne, to be a moſt ſenſleſſe thing. There were ſo manie ieaſts, and learings, and ſtirres, in our verie Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>naſterie, that now euen the Prouinciall oppoſed himſelf ſtifly, againſt vs; and he changed his for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer opinion, and now would no longer admit the Houſe; but ſayd, that the Rent was both little, and beſides, not very ſecure; and that there was very great contradiction. He ſeemed to haue reaſon in all; and, in fine, he gaue-ouer the buſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nes, and would not admit the Houſe.</p>
            <p>Now we, who had already receaued the firſt blowes, vpon our owne heads, were greatly troubled at it; but particularly, it ſtruck me much, that the Prouinciall was now found, to be oppo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſite;
<pb n="485" facs="tcp:100776:279"/>
for if he had ſtill liked it, my ſelf had been excuſed, and diſcharged, with all the world. But yet, they were not ſo fauourable, to my Compa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion; for, her they would not abſolue, but left her to her ſelf; yea and they ſayd, that ſhe was obliged to take away the ſcandall.</p>
            <p>She went therefore, to a great learned man, and a great Seruant of God, of <hi>S. Dominick's Order,</hi> to tell him, what had paſſed; and, indeed, to giue him account, of the whole buſines. And this was, before the Prouinciall had giuen it ouer; for, now there was no Creature in the whole Towne, who would giue vs anie opinion, in the Caſe; and therefore, they might well affirme, as they did, that we proceeded, in all this, of our owne heads. But that Ladie made relation of the whole buſines, to this holie man; and acquainted him with the Rent, which ſhe meant to ſettle vpon it, out of her owne Eſtate, with much deſire, that he would aſſiſt vs; for, he was the greateſt learned man, in all that Towne, at that time; and perhaps, there were not manie, more learned, in his whole Order. I told him alſo, of all that, which we intended to doe, and ſome motiues thereof; but I acquainted him not, with anie Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uelation of mine, but only with thoſe naturall reaſons, which moued me. For, I deſired not, that he ſhould giue vs anie opinion, but accord<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to them; And he, on the other ſide, wiſhed, that we would giue him the rearme of eight dayes, wherein to anſwer. He asked vs alſo then,
<pb n="486" facs="tcp:100776:280"/>
whether we were reſolued to doe that verie thing, which he ſhould direct; and I told him, we were. But though I ſayd thus much; and, me thinkes, I would haue done, as I ſayd, yet did I neuer looſe aſſurance, that the Monaſterie, in fine, would be made. My Companion had yet a ſtronger Faith; for, whatſoeuer they might ſay to her, ſhe would neuer giue-ouer to execute the deſigne. But now, though I held it impoſſible, but that the worke would be done (ſo aſſuredly did I beleiue, that the Reuelation aforeſayd, was true, (prouided alwaies, that it were found to containe nothing, either againſt Holie Scripture, or the Decrees of the Church, which we are bound to beleiue, and obſerue) yet (howſoeuer (as I ſaid before) I conceaued that that Reuelation was really of Almightie God) if ſtill that learned man had told me, that we could not effect the thing, without offending his Diuine Maieſtie, and that we ſhould haue ſinned againſt good Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcience, by procuring it, I conceiue that I ſhould inſtantly haue giuen it ouer, and ſought-out ſome other meanes, for my releif; but, for the preſent, our Lord imparted none, but this, to me.</p>
            <p>But now, this Seruant of Almightie God, told me, that he had taken this buſines into his care, togeather with a full reſolution, to employ him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf earneſtly, in procuring, that we might giue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ouer our purpoſe; becauſe the clamour of the people againſt it, had already come to his notice; and ſo alſo, had it appeared to euerie Creature,
<pb n="487" facs="tcp:100776:280"/>
to be an impertinencie; and beſides, that a certaine Cauallier of the Towne, as ſoone as he had vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtood, that we intended to ſpeake with the Father, ſent to him, to aduiſe him, to conſider well what he did; and that by no meanes, he ſhould help vs; yet, that now, himſelf, beginning to conſider, what he was to anſwer vs, and to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flect ſeriously vpon the buſines, and vpon the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tention, which we had, and with what good or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der, and Religious manner we proceeded, he re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolued, in fine, that it would be a thing, reſulting much, to the Seruice of Almightie God; and that we ſhould, by no meanes, forbeare, to put it in execution. And, in conformitie to this, his anſwer was, That we ſhould make what haſt we could, to conclude it; And he alſo let vs know his opi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion, of the way, and manner, which we were beſt to hold in it; and that, though the Rent were little, yet Almightie God was to be truſted with ſomewhat; And that for his part, he deſired, that whoſoeuer ſhould contradict, or oppoſe it, might be ſent to him; for he would know very well, what to anſwer; And accordingly, he aſſiſted vs euer, as I ſhall declare heerafter.</p>
            <p>With this, we went, much comforted, away; as alſo, in that we found, how ſome holie perſons of that place, who formerly had been oppoſite to vs, grew now to be appeaſed; and ſome of them, did alſo aſſiſt vs; and amongſt them, was that ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lie Caualier, of whome I made mention before. Who, in regard that our pretence ſeemed to aſpire
<pb n="488" facs="tcp:100776:281"/>
to great perfection, as indeed it doth, (becauſe it is wholy grounded in Prayer) he gaue-vp this o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pinion, and Vote, That, howſoeuer the meanes, whereby things muſt be effected, ſeemed to car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rie much difficultie with them, and to be with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out great apparance of ſucceſſe, yet perhaps, that it might fall-out to be of Almightie God. Now, it may be, that our Bleſſed Lord diſpoſed him, to be of this minde; and the Doctour alſo, that Preiſt, and Seruant of Almightie God, whome I related to haue voted firſt, and who is the verie Mirrour of all that Towne, &amp; the perſon, whome Almightie God perſerues there, for the good of manie Soules, was now alſo growne already to aſſiſt me in the buſines. And thus we were come to this condition, by the helpe of manie Prayers; and now already, we had bought the Houſe, in a good part of the Towne, though but a poore one; but I value not that, at all; for, our Lord had told me before, that I ſhould enter, as well as I could, and that afterward, I ſhould find, what his Diuine Maieſtie would doe; and that, haue I ſeen well performed. And ſo, although I found, that we had but little meanes, yet I beleiued, that our Bleſſed Lord would take order, that we ſhould be fauoured, by other wayes.</p>

            </argument>
            <p>THis buſines being now in ſuch caſe, and ſo neer the point of finall diſpatch, that they were to draw-vp the Writings the verie next day following, it fell out to be iuſt then, when our Prouincial grew to change his latter opinion, and returne to his former, and I beleiue, he was moued to it, by Diuine ordination, as we ſhall ſee after<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward. For, our Prayers, hauing been ſo manie, as indeed they were, it ſeemes that our Bleſſed Lord went perfecting the worke, and appointing that it ſhould be diſpatched, though after a different manner, from what we conceiued. But when once the ſayd Prouincial had formerly refuſed to admit of the Houſe, my Ghoſtlie Father gaue me a commandment, that I ſhould now, thinke no more of that matter. And yet, our Lord beſt knowes, what troubles, and afflictions, it had coſt
<pb n="490" facs="tcp:100776:282"/>
me, before I could euer bring it to that ſtate, and condition, wherein then it was. But now, the thing being giuen ouer, all that former imputation was confirmed; Namely, that it was nothing, but an impertinencie of woemen; and their murmurings came particularly vpon me; though, till that time, the Prouincial had commanded it, to be done. In the meane while, I grew to be very ill beloued, in the Monaſterie, becauſe I went about to make a new one, which might be of more ſtrict Incloſure. For they ſayd, That I affronted them, by it; and, That God might be as well ſerued there; and, That there were better amongſt them, then my ſelf; and, that now, they diſcouered well enough, that I carried no true loue, to that Houſe; That it had been much better done, to procure to get Reuenues, and Rents, for that place, then for anie other. Yea and now, there wanted not ſome, who aduiſed, that I might be carried to Priſon; and there were but very few, who did, in anie kind, take my part. As for me, I ſaw, that they had reaſon, in very much, of what they ſayd; and ſometimes, I would be making my excuſes, though yet I were not able to tell them the cheif motiue thereof, which was, that I had been com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manded to doe it, by our Bleſſed Lord. I knew not therefore well, what to ſay; and ſo I thought it fitter, to hold my peace. At other times, it pleaſed our Lord, to doe me very great Fauours; for, this of the Monaſterie, put me now, to no diſquiet at all; but I gaue it ouer, with as much facilitie, and
<pb n="491" facs="tcp:100776:282"/>
guſt, as if it had neuer coſt me anie paines, or care. Yet this, could no Creature beleiue, no not euen thoſe perſons of Prayer, with whome I conuerſed; but they conceaued, that I was full of trouble, yea and of ſhame; and euen my Ghoſtlie Father him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelfe, did not abſolutly beleiue the contrary. But, as for me, when I conſidered, that I had done whatſoeuer I could, on my part, I thought I was no further obliged, to the effecting of what our Lord had commanded me. I remained ſtill, in the Monaſterie; and I found my ſelf with much con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tentment, and guſt; yet euen ſtill, I knew not well, how to imagine, but that the thing, would be done, ſooner, or later; and of this, I had no feare at all, though I knew not, either how, or when; but only I beleiued, that it would be certainly done.</p>
            <p>That, which troubled me extreamly, was, that once my Ghoſtlie Father gaue me a great Morti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fication, as if I had done ſomewhat againſt his will. But, it ſeemes, our Lord was pleaſed, that I ſhould be in ſome affliction, euen by occaſion of that, which was moſt tender, and deare, to me. For, whilſt I was in this multitude of perſecutions, when I expected, that ſome kind of comfort would be coming towards me, he wrote me a Letter, to this effect: That <note n="*" place="margin">A ſad, and ſtrange proceed<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing.</note> now he hoped. I ſaw, by what occurred, that all had been nothing, but a Dreame; That I ſhould doe well, to reforme my ſelf heerafter, ſo farre, as not to pretend, to meddle anie more with any buſines, nor to be talking any
<pb n="492" facs="tcp:100776:283"/>
more of this, in particular; for that, I could not, but ſee well enough, what a ſcandall was growne vpon it; and other things he alſo ſayd, which did all ſerue for nothing at all, but only, to put me to paine. This, I confeſſe, gaue me more trouble, then all thoſe other things, put togeather; as con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceauing, or at <note n="*" place="margin">Hovv one ſuſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pition, u vvont to thrid it ſelf cloſe, vpon another.</note> leaſt, as doubting, whether I might not haue been the occaſion, of all the ill, which had hapned; and whether I might not haue committed ſome ſuch errour, as whereby Almightie God, might haue been offended; nay, whether theſe Viſions of mine, had not been Illuſions; and ſo conſequérly, whether my whole courſe of Prayer, had not been of the Diuel; and whether, finally, I were not then, in a plaine ſtate of errour, and per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dition. This, I confeſſe, oppreſſed me, with ſo great extremitie, that I grew to be all, in diſorder, and subiect to extreame affliction. But our Lord, who was neuer wanting to me, in all thoſe troubles of mine, which I haue expreſſed, was often pleaſed to comfort, and ſtrengthen me; though I need not ſtand heer, to relate it. And he told me alſo then, that I ſhould not vex my ſelf; That I had greatly ſerued his Diuine Maieſtie, in that buſines; and not offended him at all; That, for the preſent, I ſhould doe, what my Ghoſtlie Father had commanded me, in holding my peace, till it ſhould be fitt to renew the buſines. And, in the meane time, I re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mained full of contentment, and conſolation; and I held all that perſecution, for nothing, which had come vpon me, till then.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="493" facs="tcp:100776:283"/>
But now, by this meanes, I was taught, by our Bleſſed Lord, what a very great benefit it is, to endure troubles, and perſecutions, for his ſake. For, ſo much was the loue of Almightie God en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>creaſed in my Soule, by this meanes, as were alſo manie other vertues, that I was amazed at it; and this, in fine, is the reaſon, why I cannot but deſire afflictions, and troubles. But the while, thoſe o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther perſons, thought, that I was extreamly out of countena<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ce, with what had hapned; and certainly I ſhould haue been ſo, indeed, if our Lord had not been pleaſed, to comfort me ſo highly, with that great Fauour. But then did thoſe ſtrong impulſes, and impetuoſities of the Loue of Almightie God, whereof I haue formerly ſpoken, beginne to en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>creaſe, more and more; and I alſo came to haue greater Rapts; though yet, I acquainted no Crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, with the gaine, which I had gotten by it.</p>
            <p>In the meane time, that holie man, the <hi>Domini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>can,</hi> did neuer giue-ouer to beleiue, that the bu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſines would be ſure to take effect, euen as well, as I beleiued it, my ſelf. But I would take no knowledge of that, becauſe I was reſolued, not to ſwarue from what I had been commanded, by my Ghoſtlie Father. The <hi>Dominican</hi> negotiated alſo the Buſines, together with my Companion, and friend; and they wrote about it, to <hi>Rome,</hi> and made their Propoſitions, there. And the while, did the Diuel heer, by carrying things, from one perſon to another, procure to make it knowne, that I had had ſome Reuelation, in this buſines.
<pb n="494" facs="tcp:100776:284"/>
Vpon this, ſome came to tell me, with a great deale of apprehenſion, and feare, that I ſhould doe well, to looke to my ſelf; and that the times were ſtrict, and ſhrewd; and that, perhaps, men might lay ſome things to my charge, and goe on, euen to the Inquiſitours, by way of complaint. But this, I confeſſe, made me ſport, and I beganne, to laugh at it; for it was neuer my caſe, to be af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fraid of anie ſuch thing as this; as knowing very well, of my ſelf, that in all things, which concern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed Catholique Faith, yea euen to the leaſt Ce<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>remonie of the Church, I was totally, for it; and that alſo, for the leaſt word of Holie Scripture, I would expoſe my ſelf, a thouſand times, to death. And therefore I deſired them, not to trouble themſelues, concerning me, in this point; and that my Soule were miſerable enough, and too much, if anie ſuch thing could be found in it, as might put me into anie feare of the Inquiſition; That, if I thought, there were anie ground, or cauſe, my ſelf would be the firſt, to goe thither; and that if it were a ſlaunder, raiſed vp againſt me, our Lord would deliuer me, from it; and I ſhould proue the Gainer, by that Bargaine.</p>
            <p>Now, I treated of this matter, with the Domi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nican Father, who (as I ſayd) was ſo very learned a man, that I might well aſſure my ſelf, vpon what<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſoeuer he ſhould declare to me heerin. And I told him then, vpon this occaſion, with the greateſt clearnes, that I could poſſibly vſe, of all the Viſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, which I had had; and of the manner of
<pb n="495" facs="tcp:100776:284"/>
Prayer, which I had vſed; and of the great Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uours, which our Bleſſed Lord had been pleaſed to doe me; and I humbly prayed him, to conſider all theſe things, very well; and to let me vnder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtand, if there were anie thing at all, in anie of them, againſt Holie Scripture; and that alſo, he would acquaint me, with the iudgement, which he made thereof. Now, all this he did; and ſo, ſetled and ſecured me, very much; and I grow to be alſo of opinion, that this accident, was of much aduantage, euen to him. For, though he were for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>merly, very good, yet he gaue himself, much more to Prayer, from that time forward; and withdrew himſelf, to a certaine retired Monaſte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rie, of his owne Order, which was a place of great Solitude, and ſilence; to the end, that ſo, he might exerciſe himſelf the better, in Prayer. He remained there, aboue two yeares; and then, Obe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dience to his Order, tooke him from thence; for which he was ſorrie enough. But they had need of ſuch a man, as he was; &amp; I was no leſſe greiued, when he went from me, through the great want, which I was ſure, I ſhould haue of him; though yet I knew, withall, that he would be a gainer, by it. And whilſt I was in paine, about his iour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ney, our Lord bad me be comforted, and not troubled, for that he went away, to good pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe. And indeed, he came back againe afterward, with his Soule, ſo well improued, and aduanced, in the way of Spirit, that himſelf told me, at his returne, how he would not, for anie thing of this
<pb n="496" facs="tcp:100776:285"/>
world, but that he had gone. And I alſo, could ſay the ſame; for, whereas he had formerly giuen me aſſurances, and comforts, but only by his Letters, he was now growne able to doe it alſo, through the great experience, which he was come to haue in Spirit, and of Supernaturall things. And it alſo pleaſed Almightie God, to bring him back to vs, at ſuch a time, as when his Diuine Maieſtie ſaw, that there would be need of him, for aſſiſting his worke concerning this Monaſterie, which, his will was, ſhould goe for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward.</p>
            <p>But, in the meane time, I remained in ſilence, for a matter of ſome fiue, or ſix moneths; not hearing, or ſaying anie thing, of this buſineſſe; nor did our Bleſſed Lord command me anie thing, about it; nor vnderſtood I the reaſon there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of; but yet ſtill, I could not part with the beleif, but that the buſines would be done, ſooner, or later.</p>
            <p>But at the end of that time aforeſayd, the Rec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tour of the Colledge <hi>of the Societie of</hi> IESVS, who had been there, till then, being now to remoue from hence, his Diuine Maieſtie brought another to be in his place, who was a very Spirituall per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon, and of great courage, and vnderſtanding, and Learning; and he came, at a certaine time, when I was in very great need of helpe. For, in regard, that he, who was my Ghoſtlie Father, had a Su<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>periour ouer himſelf, and by reaſon that they haue this vertue in perfection, not ſo much as
<pb n="497" facs="tcp:100776:285"/>
once to ſtirre, but in conformitie to the will of their Superiours; and though this Ghoſtlie Father of mine, had a very good vnderſtanding of my Spirit, and deſired, that I might profit, &amp; proceed, he yet aduentured not to conclude ſome things, with a firme reſolution, for diuers reaſons, which he had for it, And on the other ſide, my Spirit did preſſe already, to paſſe on, with certaine impulſes, and impetuoſities, which were ſo great, that I found it a very troubleſome thing, to be tyed ſhort; and yet for all this, I reſolued, not to exceed thoſe bounds at all, which he had preſcribed. And being one day, in much affliction, as conceauing, that my Ghoſtlie Father did not beleiue me, it pleaſed our B. Lord, to require me, not to trouble my ſelf; affirming, that that difficultie would be ſoone at an end. For my part, I was much ioyed by this, as conceauing, that I was quickly to dye; and I was wont particularly to reioyce, when I remembred it. But afterward, I ſaw clearly, that his Speech, concerned the coming of this new Rec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tour, of whome I ſpake; and afterward, I neuer had anie occaſion to be in paine, in regard that this ſayd new Rectour, contradicted not the Sub-Rectour, who was my Confeſſarius; but rather <note n="*" place="margin">A holy &amp; vviſe man.</note> directed him, to giue me comfort, and ſcope; and that there was no cauſe of feare; and that he ſhould not conduct my Soule, by ſuch ſtraight, &amp; narrow wayes, and with ſuch reſtrictions; but ſhould permit the Spirit of our Lord, to worke in me. For indeed, at ſome times it ſeemed, that by
<pb n="498" facs="tcp:100776:286"/>
reaſon of thoſe great impetuoſities of Spirit, the Soule had ſcarce roome, for ſo much as to breath.</p>
            <p>I went then, to viſit this Rectour; and my Ghoſtlie Father required me, to treat with him, with all libertie, and clearnes. As for me, I was wont, to find very great difficultie, to declare my ſelf in that kind; but yet really, it is very true, that euen at my verie firſt entrance into the Confeſſio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>narie, I felt a kind of, I cannot tell, what, to call it, in my Spirit, which I remember not, my ſelf to haue euer found, by occaſion of anie Creature, either before, or after; nor can I diſtinctly tell, how it was; nor yet am I able, to expreſſe it fully, by anie way of Compariſon. But it was a cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taine Spirituall ioy, and a kind of vnderſtanding, which my Soule had, that the Soule of that man, would be able to vnderſtand me; and that there would be a kind of conformitie in iudgement, between vs two, although (as I was ſaying) I vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtood not, how. If indeed, I had euer ſpoken with him before; or if others had peraduenture giuen me anie great newes of the man, it had not been very ſtrange, that it ſhould ioy me, when I came to vnderſtand, that he was to heare me. But neither he, nor I, had euer ſpoken word to one another; nor was there anie one, by whoſe meanes, I had euer had anie notice at all, of him; and yet, ſince that time, I haue ſeen very well, that my Spirit deceaued me not; becauſe it hath been of great aduantage in all kinds, both to my Soule, and me, to treat with him. For, his kind of con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uerſation,
<pb n="499" facs="tcp:100776:286"/>
and way of conference, and commu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nication, is a thing of great importance, for ſuch perſons, as our Lord ſeemes to haue forwarded much, in the way of Spirit; for, he makes them runne-on apace, and not goe, foot by foot. And his manner is, to vntye them ſoundly, and totally, from all Creatures; and to put them, to the exer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciſe, and practiſe of Mortification; for, in this, our Bleſſed Lord hath imparted a moſt particular talent to him, as he hath alſo done, in manie other things. Now, as ſoone as I beganne to communicate my affaires with him, I inſtantly vnderſtood his ſtile, and way of proceeding; and I found, that he had a holie, and pure Soule; and that our Lord had giuen him a particular tallent in the trying, and knowing of Spirits. So that I was comforted, both much, and very ſoone, af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter I had once communicated with him; and our Bleſſed Lord beganne againe, to preſſe me, to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards a treating of the Buſines of the Monaſterie; and that I ſhould declare, both to my Ghoſtlie Father, and to this Rectour, the manie grounds, and reaſons, why they were not to diſſwade, and diuert me from it; and ſome of them, made them hartily afrayd to doe it. For, this Father Rectour, neuer did ſo much as doubt, but that it was the Spirit of Almightie God, becauſe he had beheld, and conſidered the effects, with very great ſtudie, and care. In fine, after the conſideration of manie things, they durſt not preſume to diuert me; and my Ghoſtlie Father did againe giue me leaue, to
<pb n="500" facs="tcp:100776:287"/>
vſe all the endeauour I could; and yet, I was able, to ſee very well, what a great deale of trouble it would giue me, in regard I was ſo vtterly alone, and had very little power, to effect anie thing. But we agreed, that it ſhould be carried with great priuacy; and therefore I procured, that a certaine Siſter of mine, who liued els-where, ſhould buy, and build the Houſe, as if it were for her ſelf; and that it ſhould be done with monie, which our Lord found meanes. by certaine wayes, wherewith to pay for it. But it would be a long buſines, to tell you, how his Diuine Maieſtie, went prouiding it; for, as for me, I deſired to be very ſure, to doe nothing, which might be againſt Obedience. But I was not then to learne, that, if I told anie thing to the Superiours of my Order, the whole Buſines would be loſt, as it was be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore; yea and that, if I did ſo now, it would fall<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out to be worſe. In the point of getting monie, for making the bargaine for a Seate, and for building alſo the Houſe, I endured manie troub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>les; and ſome of them, all alone; though yet my Companion, and freind, did alſo the beſt ſhe could. But, in fine, ſhe could doe little, and indeed ſo very little, that, vpon the matter, it was a kind of nothing, but only to take vpon her the name, and to lend it her countenance; for, all the reſt of the trouble, I was mine; and it came vpon me, ſo very manie wayes, that I doe euen wonder, now, how I was able, to endure it, then.</p>
            <p>Sometimes, when I was full of affliction, I
<pb n="501" facs="tcp:100776:287"/>
would be vttering my ſelf, to Almightie God, af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter this manner: O my deare Lord, how comeſt thou to command me things, which ſeem impoſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſible? For, though I be a woeman, yet if I had liber<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie, perhaps ſomething might be done; but being tyed vp, in all reſpects, without monie, and with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out knowing, where to get anie, whereby either the <hi>Breue,</hi> or anie thing els, may be had, what can I doe, O Lord? But being once in a certaine ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſitie, and not knowing, which way to turne my ſelf; and not being able to pay the workmen, <hi>S. Ioſeph,</hi> my true Father, and Patron, appeared to me, and told me, that, monie would not be want<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to me; and therefore, that I ſhould make the agreement; and ſo I did, euen when I had no monie at all; and afterward, our Bleſſed Lord prouided it, by ſo ſtrange wayes, that they, who heard of it, were amazed.</p>
            <p>But now, me thought, the Houſe ſhewed to be very little; and indeed, it was ſo, and in that ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tremitie, that it ſeemed not capable, of being euer able to be a Monaſterie; and I had a good minde, to buy another Houſe; but neither had I, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>withall to doe it, nor otherwiſe, anie meanes to procure it; though there were yet, a very little one, ioyning to it, whereof a Church might be made. But after I had Communicated, one day, our Lord ſayd thus to me: <hi>I haue already vvilled thee, to beginne, as thou mayeſt.</hi> And then, after the man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner of exclamation, he ſayd thus alſo to me: <hi>O the touetouſues of the race of mankinde; vvhich thinkes, that
<pb n="502" facs="tcp:100776:288"/>

Hovv often haue I ſlept in the open ayre, as not knovving, vvhere to lay my head?</hi> Vpon this, I was amazed, and found that he had reaſon; and ſo I went to that little Houſe, and ordered it. And though it were very little, yet it was iuſt fitt, to make ſuch a kind of Monaſterie; and I made it no more my buſines, to compaſſe a larger Seate, but procured, to build vpon that, in ſuch ſort, as it might be fitt to be in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>habited, all courſe, and rude, and without anie other miſterye, but only, that it might not be hurtfull, in point of health; and ſo it ſhall euer re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maine.</p>
            <p>Vpon the day of <hi>S. Clare,</hi> I going to receaue the B. Sacrament, ſhe appeared to me, in very great beautie, and bad me be of a good courage, and goe on, in the worke which I had begunne; and that ſhe would aſſiſt me. And this hath proued ſo true, that a Monaſterie of Religious woemen, of her Order, which is neer this; doth help to ſuſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taine, and feed vs; and (which yet is more) ſhe hath, by little and little, brought this deſire of mine, to ſuch perfection, that the ſelf-ſame po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uertie, which that Bleſſed Saint eſtabliſhed in her Houſe, is exerciſed alſo in this; and we liue of Al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mes; which point, hath coſt me no ſmall trouble, in getting it confirmed, by His Holines; and to be further alſo eſtabliſhed, in ſuch ſort, as that no innouation may be made, not the Houſe be euer capable of Rent. And now doth our Bleſſed Lord euen more then this; and perhaps, the ſame may
<pb n="503" facs="tcp:100776:288"/>
grow, by the interceſſion of this Bleſſed Saint; for, his Diuine Maieſtie prouides vs with all things neceſſarie, in moſt compleat manner, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out our euer asking anie thing, of anie Creature. Let him be Bleſſed for all things, Amen.</p>
            <p>But I, being about that time, vpon the Day of the Aſſumption of our B. Ladie, in a certaine Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>naſterie of the Glorious S. Dominick's Order, I was conſidering the manie Sinnes of my former time, (which I had Confeſſed in that Houſe) and the accidents of my wicked life; and ſuddainly, there came ſo great a Rapt vpon me, that it tooke me, in effect, wholy out of my ſelf. I then ſat downe; and yet it ſeemed to me, that I was not able, either to heare Maſſe, or ſo much, as to ſee the Eleuation; for which, I remained afterward, with ſome ſcruple. Now, it ſeemed to me, that, whilſt I found my ſelf in that condition, I was ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parrelled with a certaine <note n="*" place="margin">All theſe things, and the like; as namely, Darts, or Chai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nes, or Crovv<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nes, or Ievvells &amp;c. are not to be vnderſtoood after a groſſe. &amp; materiall vvay, but yet, that really they haue truth, in their being repreſented diſtinctly, &amp; clearly, to the Imagination of the Partyes; and they cheifly ſerue, as teſtimonies, &amp; Signes, of thoſe interiour graces, &amp; vertues, vvhich vſe to be imprinted vpon Soules, at thoſe very times, by the mercy of our B. Lord.</note> Garme<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t of much white<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nes, and clearnes; and at the firſt, I could not tell, who it was, that cloathed me; but afterward, I ſaw our B. Ladie, on the right hand, and my Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, S. Ioſeph, on the left, who apparelled me then, with that Robe; and it was giuen me to be vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtood, that I was now growne, to be cleanſed, from my Sinnes. When thus I was apparelled, and
<pb n="504" facs="tcp:100776:289"/>
found my ſelf full of ioy, and glorie, it inſtantly ſeemed to me, that our B. Ladie layd hold vpon me, and told me, That it contented her much, to ſee me ſerue the Glorious S. Ioſeph; That I was to beleiue, that, what I pretended, concerning the Monaſterie, ſhould be effected; and, That our Lord, and they two, would be much ſerued, there; That I muſt not be afrayd, that euer there would be anie failing therein, howſoeuer ſome commandments, which might fall out to be im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſed vpon me, would not be according to my guſt; for, euen themſelues, in fine, would defend, and keep vs; That her Sonne had already promiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, that he would be, and remaine with vs; and in teſtimonie that all this ſhould proue true, ſhe caſt a faire, and bright Chaine of gold about my neck, with a Croſſe faſtned to it, of great value. But this Gold, and theſe Pretious Stones, are ſo very different from thoſe of this world, that there is no manner of compariſon between them; for, the beautie of theſe, is farre other, then anie thing, which we can imagine heer. Nor doth hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mane Vnderſtanding ariue to know, of what the Garment was made; nor how to fancie that cleare whitenes to it ſelfe, which our Lord is pleaſed to repreſent; for, all that, of this inferiour world, is no better, then a kind of ſcratch, with a coale, as a man may ſay, in reſpect of the other. The beau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie alſo, which I ſaw in our B. Ladie, was exceſſiue, though yet I could not determine the forme, or figure of anie particular part, which I might aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſigne
<pb n="505" facs="tcp:100776:289"/>
her, but only the frame, and ayre of the whole face togeather. She was apparrelled in white, with exceſſe of ſplendour; but yet of no ſuch kind, as dazles, but moſt dearly ſweet. As for the Glorious S. Ioſeph, I ſaw not him ſo clearly; though yet, I well perceaued, that he was there; like thoſe Viſions, whereof I ſpake, which are not ſeen. Our B. Ladie, was extraordinatily young; and ſhe remained with me, a very little while; and I had exceſſiue glorie, and guſt by it; and more, in my opinion, then euer I had enioyed before; and I would certainly haue been glad enough, if I might neuer haue left it. It ſeemed to me, that I ſaw them both, aſcend to Heauen, with a very great multitude of Angells; and I, the while, remained in much Solitude; though yet withall, ſo comforted, and eleuated, and euen diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolued, and recollected in Prayer, that I remain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, for ſome ſpace of time, in ſuch ſort, as not to be able, either to ſpeake, or ſtirre; but I was wholy, as it were, out of my ſelf. And I conti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nued with a great impulſe of deſire, to be euen as it were, annihilated, for Almightie God; and I found alſo ſuch effects thereof; and the whole, paſſed-on in ſuch ſort, as that I was neuer able, (though I endeauoured much) to doubt, but that this Viſitation was of Almighty God.</p>
            <p>The Queen of the Angells left me topp-full of comfort, and of profound peace, by what ſhe ſayd to me, of Obedience; and the Caſe, was this. For my part, I was very vnwilling, not to giue this
<pb n="506" facs="tcp:100776:290"/>
Houſe vp, to the Order; and indeed our Lord himſelf had told me, that it was not fitt, that they ſhould haue it; and he alſo deliuered me the reaſons, why it was not, by anie meanes, fitt; but that I ſhould ſend about it, to Rome, by a certaine way; and he alſo made me know, that he would cauſe it to be diſpatched, from thence; and ſo it was. And it was ſent by that verie meanes, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of our Lord had told me; but we ſhould neuer haue finally been able to diſpatch it, of our ſelues; and vpon the occaſions, which ſucceeded after<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward, it was very fitt, that it ſhould be ſubmitted, by way of Obedience, to the Biſhop. Yet then, I knew him not, nor vnderſtood, what kind of Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>late he was; but our Lord was pleaſed, that he ſhould be ſo good, and ſhould fauour this Houſe, as much as was fitt, yea and euen neceſſarie, for the encountring of that great co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>tradiction, which occurred heerin; as I ſhall declare afterward; and to put it into that ſtate, wherein now it is.

            <p>BVt, notwithſtanding all the care I tooke, that men might not know, what we were doing, this whole Buſines, could not be carried with ſo much ſecrecie, but that manie, muſt needs vnder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtand it; and ſome of them did beleiue it; and others, not. For my part, I was hartily afrayd, that, if the Prouinciall ſhould come, and they chance to tell him of it, he would command me to giue it ouer; and then, the whole deſigne would be at an end. But our Lord ordained things, in ſuch ſort,
<pb n="508" facs="tcp:100776:291"/>
that, about à matter of twentie leagues off, it oc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>curred, that there was a certaine Ladie, very much afflicted, by the death of her Huſband; and ſhe found her ſelf, in ſuch extremitie thereby, that her health was much concerned; and feared. Now, ſhe had gotten ſome notice of <note n="*" place="margin">She meanes her ſelfe.</note> this miſerable poore wretched Sinner; for it ſeemes, that our Lord had ordained already, that they ſhould ſpeake well of me, in her hearing, for the effecting of other good things, which depended vpon this. This Ladie was very well acquainted with this Prouinciall; and he, conſidering, what a principall perſon ſhe was, and that I was in a Monaſterie, which kept not Clauſure, our Lord gaue her ſo great a deſire to ſee me, (as conceauing, that ſhe ſhould receaue comfort, by my meanes) that it was almoſt no longer now, in her power, not in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtantly to procure, by all poſſible endeauour, to get me thither; and ſo ſhe ſent to the Prouinciall, who was very farre off, at that time; and accord<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ingly he alſo ſent me an expreſſe commandment, vnder Obedience, that forthwith I should tranſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>port my ſelf thither, with a Companion. Now, I came to know of this, vpon a Chriſtmaſſe-Day, at night; and it put me into much diſorder, and gaue me a great deale of paine, to find, that they reſolued to carrie me away, as conceauing, that there was ſome goodnes in me. For, conſidering how wicked I knew my ſelf to be, I could, by no meanes, endure it; but ſo, recommending my ſelf much to Almightie God. I remained, during all
<pb n="509" facs="tcp:100776:291"/>
the time of <hi>Matins,</hi> or at leaſt the farre larger part thereof, in a verie great Rapt. Our Lord declared to me then, that I should not faile to goe, and that I was not to harken to the opinions of others; for few would thinke, without raſhnes, that they could aduiſe me to goe; but that, howſoeuer the iourney might be of much trouble to mee, yet that he would be greatly ſerued thereby; and that it would be alſo very conuenient, that I ſhould abſent my ſelf from hence, till the <hi>Breue</hi> were come; becauſe the Diuel had a great plott prouided, againſt the time, when the Prouinciall should be there, but yet that I muſt be afrayd of nothing, for that, in fine, he should aſſiſt me, in the buſines. Vpon this, I was much comforted; and encouraged; and I related the whole Storie; to the Rectour, who told me, that I muſt, by no meanes, forbeare to goe; but others ſayd, that I muſt not doe it, by anie meanes; and that it was but an in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uention of the Diuell, to the end, that ſome miſcheife might happen to me; and that my beſt way would be, to reply vpon the Prouinciall. But I obeyed the Rectour; and conſidering alſo, what had paſſed in Prayer, I beganne my iourney, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out feare; but yet, not without extreame confu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion, to conſider, vnder what title, and occaſion, they called for me. And finding how much they were deceiued, it made me euen importune our Bleſſed Lord, ſo much the more, not to forſake me. Now it comforted me extreamly, that there was in that place, whither I was going, a Colledge
<pb n="510" facs="tcp:100776:292"/>
of <hi>the Societie of Ieſus,</hi> and that I might be ſubiect to that, wherein they should direct me, when I was there; for, by this meanes, I conceaued, that I was to be in a kind of ſafetie.</p>
            <p>But when I ariued there, our Bleſſed Lord was pleaſed, that the Ladie should receaue ſo much comfort, that her amendment was quickly ſeen; for ſhe was, euerie day, better and better. And this was the more eſteemed, becauſe (as I ſayd be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore) the paine, wherein ſhe was, did hold her in great difficulties, and ſtraights. And it is likelie, that our Lord graunted her eaſe, at the inſtance of the manie prayers, which certaine holie perſons, whome I knew, did make in my behalfe, that ſo, all might ſucceed happily to me. She had alſo, euen in her ſelf, a great feare of Almightie God, and was ſo full of vertue, and goodnes, that her much Chriſtianitie, and pietie, ſupplyed for that, which was wanting in me. Now, ſhe grew into a great loue of me; and I remained, not a whitt in her debt, when I ſaw her goodnes. But yet, in ef<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect, euen all, was trouble to me there; for, the Regalo's, which they gaue me, were no leſſe, then ſo manie torments to me; and their making ſo much account of me, as they ſhewed, did put me into a great deale of feare. I therefore carried my Soule ſo reſtrained, and ſo retired within my ſelf, that I durſt not be, anie way, careleſſe in that kind; and ſo alſo was not our Lord vnmindefull of me. For, he did me, whilſt I was there, moſt exceſſiue Fauours; and they endued me, with ſo
<pb n="511" facs="tcp:100776:292"/>
true, and ſo great libertie of Spirit, as to make me vndervalue, &amp; deſpiſe all thoſe teſtimonies of eſtimation, &amp; honour, which I found there; &amp; the more, the more; and ſo, as that I failed not, to treat with thoſe Ladies, who were ſo great, with as much libertie, as if I had been equall to them; whereas yet they were of ſuch qualitie, that I might, without anie diſhonour at all to my ſelf, haue been euen their domeſtick Seruant. I drew a great aduantage, and benefit from thence; and ſo I told her. I found that ſhe was ſubiect to ſome weakneſſes, and paſſions, as my ſelf am; and how little ſhe was, in reaſon, to eſteem her greatnes, and power; which ſtill, the more it is, ſo much the more trouble, and care, it drawes after it. And they are faine to take ſuch thought, for liuing in ſuch a forme, and methode, as is fitt, forſooth, for their greatnes, and ranke, that, vpon the matter, it ſcarce giues them leaue to liue. For, they eat out of time, and out of order; becauſe all, for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſooth, muſt goe in conformitie, to the ſtate, which they hold, and not with anie regard, to their conſtitution, and health; nay ſometimes, they muſt feed vpon ſuch meates, as are more agreable to their greatnes, then to their guſt; and ſo, as that, for my part, I wholy abhorred, ſo much as euen to deſire to be a great Ladie. God deliuer me from ſuch ill-fauoured grauitie, and greatnes, as this; for, though the Ladie, of whome I ſpeake, be one of the greateſt of this Kingdome (and I beleiue, there are few, more humble, and more
<pb n="512" facs="tcp:100776:293"/>
affable, then ſhe) yet really, I had, and haue com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>paſſion of her, to ſee, how ſhe paſſes, manie times, not in conformitie, euen ſo much as with her owne inclination, but to comply with her condition; for euen, in point of Seruants, there is very little truſt to be repoſed; and though ſhe had them good, yet muſt ſhe not ſpeake more confi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dently, and kindly, to one of them, then to ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther; and if ſhe doe, whoſoeuer is moſt fauoured by her, muſt be ſure to be leſſe beloued by others. In fine, this greatnes, is a great ſubiection; and indeed, one of the greateſt Lyes, which euer the world can tell, is, when it calls ſuch perſons as theſe, Lords, and Ladies; for, as for me, they all ſeem to be no other thing, then euen Slaues; and that, a thouſand times ouer.</p>
            <p>Our Lord was pleaſed at that time, whilſt I re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mained with that Ladie, in her Houſe, that the domeſticks alſo there, improued much in the ſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uice of his Diuine Maieſtie, though yet, for my part, I was not free from ſome troubles, yea and certaine enuies alſo, which were expreſſed, to my diſaduantage, by certaine perſons, in regard of the great affection, which that Ladie bore me; and perhaps, they were ſo ill aduiſed, as to imagine, that I had ſome thought of intereſt, by what I did. But our Lord was pleaſed to permit, that they ſhould giue me ſome few little troubles, both in this kind, and alſo in others, leaſt els, I might per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>haps, haue growne to be intoxicated, by the Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>galo, which was vouchſafed to me, on the other
<pb n="513" facs="tcp:100776:293"/>
ſide; but he was pleaſed, to fetch me out of all thoſe accidents, and aduentures, with the aduan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tage, and improuement of mine owne Soule.</p>
            <p>Whilſt yet I remained there, a certaine Religi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous man, and a very eminent perſon, with whome I had treated ſometimes, (though it were maine yeares before) did chance to ariue in that place. And I being, one day, at Maſſe, in a Monaſterie of his Order, which was neer to the place where I kept, was taken with a kind of inclination, to know, in what condition, or ſtate, that Soule was; for I deſired, that he might be a very great Seruant of Almightie God. I roſe then from ſit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing where I was, that ſo I might be going towards him; but yet, hauing been already recollected in Prayer, it ſeemed to me then, afterwards, that it would be no better, then loſt time; and what, forſooth, had I to doe with him? and ſo, I then diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſed my ſelf, to ſit downe againe; and (as I now remember) I did the verie ſame thing, no leſſe, then three ſeuerall times. In fine, the good Angell was ſtronger, then the ill; and I went, and requi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red him to be called; and ſo he came. I then be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ganne to aske him diuerſe queſtions, as he did me, (becauſe manie yeares had ſlipt away, ſince we mett laſt) concerning the ſeuerall Liues of one a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nother. And I beganne to tell him, that as for mine, it had been ſubiect to manie afflictions of Minde. Vpon this he preſſed much, to know, what thoſe afflictions might be; and I told him, that it was neither greatly pertinent to be knowne, nor
<pb n="514" facs="tcp:100776:294"/>
very fitt for me, to relate. But he replyed, that, ſince the Father of S. Dominick's Order knew them, that Father (whome I had affirmed, to be ſo much his freind) would preſently let him know them; and therefore, that I needed not trouble my ſelf to relate them. But, in fine, the Caſe grew to be this, that neither was it in his power, to forbeare to importune me; nor in mine, to forbeare to declare my ſelf heerin, to him. For, with all that trouble, and ſhame, which I vſed to haue, whenſoeuer there was diſcourſe of things, like this, yet, when I treated of them with this man, and with the Rectour alſo <hi>of the Societie,</hi> of whome I ſpake before, it put me to no trouble at all, but rather, it was of comfort to me. I there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore vnfolded my ſelfe to him, but yet vnder the Seale of Confeſſion; and me thought, he was more aduiſed, then euer; though I alwayes held him, to be a man of very great vnderſtanding. I conſidered the manie talents, and parts he had, wherewith to doe a huge deale of good, if he would giue himſelf entirely, to Almightie God. And it is true, that I haue had this qualitie, for diuerſe of theſe latter yeares, that I cannot ſee anie Creature, who contents me much, <note n="*" place="margin">This Saint vvas an excellent perſon, to make a freind of.</note> but I muſt inſtantly deſire, to haue him wholy giuen to Al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mightie God; and I wiſh it, euen with ſuch an ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tremitie of appetite, that I know not, almoſt in thoſe caſes, what to doe with my ſelf. And though it be very true, that I would faine haue all the world doe him Seruice, yet I deſire, with very
<pb n="515" facs="tcp:100776:294"/>
great impulſe, and euen impetuoſitie, that the perſons, who pleaſe me beſt, ſhould doe it moſt; and ſo I often vſe, to importune our Lord ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>treamly, in their behalf. But, as for that Religious man, of whome I was ſpeaking, he beſought me, that I would recommend him earneſtly to Al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mightie God; but that was more, then needed; for already, I was ſo gone with the man, that I could not poſſibly doe otherwiſe. And ſo I went to the place, where I was accuſtomed to put my<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf in Prayer, all alone, and being then, in deep recollection, I beganne to deale with our Bleſſed Lord; and it was in a ſtile, ſo very familiar, that it was euen halfe fooliſh; for I treat with him, ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nie times, without knowing almoſt, diſtinctly, what I ſay. For then, it is not ſo properly my per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon, as my Loue, which ſpeakes; and the Soule is ſo alienated euen from her ſelf, that I ſcarce diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerne the difference, which then there is, between Almightie God, and me. For, the great loue, which my Soule knowes, that his Diuine Maieſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie beares her, makes her forget, what ſhe is in her ſelf, as conceauing, that ſhe is then, in him. And ſo, as if both ſhe, and he, were one, and the ſelf-ſame thing, without diuiſion, or diſtinction, ſhe vtters but impertinencies, and roauings. I re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>member, that I told him thus much, (after I had begged of him, with abundance of teares, that the Soule of that Religious man, might apply it ſelf, to his Seruice, in great earneſt) That, although I held him already, for good, yet that would not
<pb n="516" facs="tcp:100776:295"/>
ſerue my turne; for, I muſt haue him very good; and accordingly, I ſayd further, thus, in plaine tearmes: <hi>O Lord thou muſt not denye me this favour; but conſider, that this man vvill be very fitt, to make afreind for vs both.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>O great Humanitie, and Bountie of Almightie God! nor doth he ſo much conſider our words, but the deſires, and affections, wherewith they are ſpoken! But now, how can he come to endure, that ſuch a miſerable Creature, as I, ſhould ſpeake to his Diuine Maieſtie, with ſo much boldnes? But, let him be Bleſſed, for euer.</p>
            <p>The while, I remember well, that in thoſe howers of Prayer, wherein I exerciſed my ſelf that night, our Lord gaue me a great affliction, by my doubting, whether I were in his fauour. But now, I deſired not ſo much, to know that, as I did euen deſire to dye, rather then to continue in ſuch a life, as wherein I might not be ſure, whether I were dead, or no. For, it were not poſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſible for me, to endure a sharper death, then to thinke, that I had offended Almightie God. And this paine, put me into ſuch ſtraights, that, being all regaled, as I was, and euen melted, and diſſol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ued in teares, I humbly beſought his Diuine Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ieſtie, that he would not permit it. And ſo I came then to vnderſtand, that I might well be comfor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted, and confide, that I was in ſtate of Grace; for that ſuch loue of Almightie God, and the impart<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of ſuch Fauours, and feelings, as his Diuine Maieſtie vouchſafed to me, were not compatible
<pb n="517" facs="tcp:100776:295"/>
with anie ſuch Soule, as ſhould be in Mortall Sinne.</p>
            <p>But, in the meane time, I grew into a kind of aſſured hope, that our Lord would grant the thing, to that other perſon, which I humbly begged at his hands. He commanded me alſo, to deliuer certaine words to him. But at this, indeed, I was troubled much, as not knowing, how I ſhould be able to vtter them. For, the point of carrying a meſſage to a third perſon, in ſuch ſort as I was ſaying, is a thing, which doth alwaies af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flict me; eſpecially, when I know not, how it will be taken; or, whether the perſon will not laugh at me, for my labour. This put me to a great deale of trouble; but yet, in fine, I thinke, I was ſo farre perſwaded, as to promiſe Almightie God, that I would not forbeare to impart them; and through the great confuſion, and ſhame, wherein I was, I <note n="*" place="margin">A very strange demon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtration of a moſt ciuill, noble, and fre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>indly hart.</note> wrote them, and ſo deliuered them to him. And now, this well appeared, to be an action of Al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mightie God, by the great effect it wrought. For, he reſolued to giue himſelf to Prayer, after very a ſerious manner; though yet, he did it not ſo very ſoone. But yet, our Lord deſigning to make him wholy his owne, was pleaſed to declare certaine truths to him, by my meanes; which, howſoeuer I vnderſtood them not my ſelf, did yet fall out ſo fitly for him, that he was euen a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mazed. And our Lord diſpoſed him to beleiue, that they came from his Diuine Maieſtie; and I, on the other ſide, (though I be that poore miſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able
<pb n="518" facs="tcp:100776:296"/>
Creature, which I am) did humbly, and earneſtly beſeech our Lord, that he would per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fectly, and entirely, conuert that man to himſelf, and make him abhorre all the contentments, and Creatures of this life. And ſo (for which let him be Bleſſed for euer) he hath been pleaſed to doe it, and that in ſo very perfect a manner, that, whenſoeuer this Seruant of his, is ſpeaking to me, it makes me, in effect, turne half foole; and if I had not ſeen it, with my verie eyes, I ſhould hold it for a doubtfull thing, how Fauours could poſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſibly be heaped-vp, ſo very high, vpon a Creature, in ſo ſhort a time; and ſhould hold him, ſo buſily, and continually employed, vpon Almightie God, that already he ſeemes not to liue, for the vſe of anie thing of this world. I humbly beſeech his Diuine Maieſtie, to keep him in his protection, ſtill; for certainly, if he proceed after this rate, (as I hope in our Lord, he will,) his Spirit being ſo deeply rooted in the knowledge of himſelf, he will grow to be, of the moſt eminent Seruants he hath; and will be able to doe good to manie Soules. For he hath gotten great experience, con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerning things of Spirit, in a very ſhort time; and theſe are guifts, which Almightie God imparts, when, and how, he will, without anie preciſe reſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pect, either to the time, which hath been ſpent, or els, to the qualitie of the Seruice. I ſay not yet, but that this may alſo import much; but that our Lord forbeares ſometimes, to giue that, to a per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon, in twentie yeares of Contemplation, which
<pb n="519" facs="tcp:100776:296"/>
yet he forbeares not to beſtow vpon ſome other, in one. Our Lord knowes the reaſon of this. And it is alſo a deceiptfull errour, which abuſes vs, when it ſeemes, we may vnderſtand, and obtaine that, by account of yeates, which can, by no meanes, be had, without experience of the verie things, as they are. And ſo, manie err, as I haue ſayd, in thinking that they are fitt to iudge of Spirits, without hauing anie themſelues. I ſay not, but that a learned man, though he haue no great knowledge of Spirit, may gouerne another man, who hath Spirit. But this is to be vnderſtood, both in the exteriour, and in the interiour way, ſo farre, as it may carrie a conformitie, with the Naturall Powers, by the worke of his Vnder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtanding; and as for thoſe things, which are Su<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pernaturall, he muſt be carefull, that all goe on, with conſent to Holie Scripture. And for the reſt, let him not vex himſelf; nor conceaue, that he vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtands that, whereof, indeed, he knowes no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing; nor ſtifle, and choake thoſe Spirits, which, foraſmuch as concernes theſe things, are gouer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned by another, and a higher Lord; for, in fine, they are not, without a Superiour of their owne.</p>
            <p>Be not amazed at this; nor let theſe things ſeem impoſſible to you; for, all is very poſſible to our Lord; but procure you, to re-inforce your Faith, and to humble your ſelf, when you ſee, that our Bleſſed Lord knowes, how to make a poore, old, ignorant woeman, become a more knowing Creature, perhaps, in this Science, then
<pb n="520" facs="tcp:100776:297"/>
he, who may be otherwiſe, a very learned man. For, by meanes of this Humilitie, one ſhall be able to doe more good, both to the Soules of o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers, and his owne, then if he grow to be Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>templatiue, without that Vertue. And I ſay, and ſay againe, that if he be not a man of experience, or if, at leaſt, he haue not very abundantly of Humilitie, wherewith to vnderſtand, that he vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtands not the buſines, (and that yet, it is not impoſſible, but that the thing, in queſtion, may be true;) he ſhall both gaine little himſelf, and enable him alſo leſſe, to gaine, with whome he deales. But, on the other ſide, if he haue Humilitie, he may be well out of feare, that our Lord will euer permit, that either the one, or the other, ſhall be deceaued.</p>
            <p>But now, concerning this Father, of whome I ſpeake, as our Lord hath giuen him experience, in manie things: ſo hath he alſo endeauoured, to acquire all that, which may be gotten by ſtudie, in this kind. And whe<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ſoeuer his owne experience falls ſhort, he informes himſelf by their meanes, who haue more. And heer, our Lord comes to aſſiſt him, by giuing him a great proportion of Faith; and by this meanes, he hath done very much good, both to his owne Soule, and thoſe alſo of others; and mine, is one of them. For, our B. Lord, conſidering the manie afflictions, which I was to endure, it ſeemes would prouide, that ſice ſome of them would be brought vpon me by ſuch as were to gouerne my Soule, there yet,
<pb n="521" facs="tcp:100776:297"/>
might be others found, who would helpe me, to goe through with thoſe troubles, and aſſiſt me much.</p>
            <p>But as for this Religious man, of whome I haue ſpoken ſo much, our Lord hath ſo entirely changed him, that, vpon the matter, he is no longer to be knowne, for the man he was. He hath now alſo, giuen him much corporall ſtre<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>gth, whereby he is now enabled to doe Pennance, which was impoſſible for him, before; for, he was euer ſicklie. And he is alſo full of courage, towards the performing of anie thing, which is good; and beſides, he hath varietie of other ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cellent things, which make it well appeare, that his Vocation came moſt particularly, from our Lord; And let him be Bleſſed, for euer.</p>
            <p>For my part, I beleiue, that all this good is come to him, by the Fauours, which our Lord hath done him in Prayer; for they are not painted things, or put looſely on; but our Lord hath been pleaſed, to haue him brought to the Touch; and he hath proued therein, as one, who vnder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtands very well, the true value of that merit, which is gotten by the well ſuffering of perſecu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions. And I truſt in the greatnes of our Lord, that much good will accrue to ſome of his Order, by his meanes; yea and euen to the whole Order it ſelf. Already this beginnes to be vnderſtood; and my ſelf haue ſeen great Viſions; and our Lord hath told me ſome particulars, both of him, and of the Rectour of the Colledge of the <hi>Societie of</hi>
               <pb n="522" facs="tcp:100776:298"/>
IESVS, of whome I ſpake; and they are things of great admiration; as alſo of two other Religious men, of <hi>S. Dominick's Order;</hi> but eſpecially of one; for whoſe proceeding, and profit, in the way of Spirit, our Lord hath already manifeſted ſome things to the world, by reall proofe. I had alſo heard formerly of him; but they are manie in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtances, which concerne the perſon, of whome I ſpake before; and one of them, I will heer re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count.</p>
            <p>I was once with him, in a <hi>Locutorie,</hi> or Speak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing-place of a Monaſterie; and ſo very great, was the loue of Almightie God, which my Soule, and Spirit vnderſtood, to be euen burning, in his, that I was euen, as it were, abſorpt by it. For I went conſidering the greatneſſes of Almightie God, and in how ſhort a time he had ſublimed a Soule, to ſo admirable a State. He put me to much con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fuſion, when I heard him giue eare, with ſo great humilitie, to thoſe things, which I would ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times be ſaying to him concerning Prayer; I, who had ſo little to ſay thereof, to ſuch a perſon, as he was. But our Lord was content to endure it, through the earneſt deſire I had, to ſee him a great Proficient, in that kind. And it did me ſo much good, to be with him, that ſtill he ſeemed to in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flame my Soule, with new fire, and with new de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſires, to ſerue our Lord, euen as if I had been but then to beginne.</p>
            <p>O my deare IESVS! what things are they, which a Soule can doe, when it is all, inflamed
<pb n="523" facs="tcp:100776:298"/>
with thy loue? and we ought to eſteem ſuch an one, very much, and humbly beſeech our Lord, to let it continue long, in this world. For, whoſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>euer ownes the ſame kind of loue, ſhould follow ſuch a kind of Soule, as faſt as he can. It is matter of much comfort to a ſick man, to find another, who is toucht, and tainted, by the ſame diſeaſe; for it ſerues him, in the way of ſome conſolation, to ſee, at leaſt, that he is not alone. They helpe one another excellently well, both to ſuffer, and to merit; They ioyne back, to back, and ſo ſupport, and ſuccour one another, like valiant, and reſol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ued perſons, to venture a thouſand liues, for the loue of Almightie God; and, They aſpire to no other happines, then to meet with ſome ſuch oc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>caſion, as wherein they may offer themſelues in Sacrifice, for his Seruice. They are like gallant Souldiers; who, to the end, that they may gaine the Spoile of their Enemies, and ſo grow rich, by that meanes, deſire, that there may ſtill be Warres; as vnderſtanding, that there is no way, for them, to thriue, but by that meanes; for it is no leſſe, then their very occupation, to labour, and to ſuffer.</p>
            <p>O what a great thing it is, when out Lord giues light to know, how much is gained, by ſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fering for him? This point is not vnderſtood, well, and home, till all be giuen ouer, and left. For, whoſoeuer keepes anie thing to himſelf, giues a ſigne, that he eſteemes it to be worth ſomewhat. And if he eſteem it worth ſomewhat,
<pb n="524" facs="tcp:100776:299"/>
it will be neceſſarie for him, to be ſorrie to leaue it. But now heer, all is imperfect, yea and euen loſt; and heer comes the Prouerbe well in, that He is a kind of loſt man, who lookes after that, which is loſt. And what greater loſſe, and perdition; what greater blindnes; what greater miſerie, and misfortune can there be, then to put a great value vpon that, which is abſolutly worth nothing at all?</p>
            <p>But (to returne, to what I was ſaying) when I was extreamly ioyed, by conſidering the Soule of that man, (wherein it ſeemes, that our Bleſſed Lord was diſpoſed, that I ſhould clearly ſee thoſe treaſures, which he had depoſitated therein) and diſcerning alſo the high fauour, which he vouch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſafed to doe me, in regard, that it had hapned by my meanes, I found my ſelf very vnworthie of it; but withall, I held thoſe Fauours, which our Lord had been pleaſed to doe him, in a much higher kind of account, then if he had vouchſafed them to my ſelf. And I payd our Lord an abun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dance of praiſe, to ſee, that his Diuine Maieſtie went ſo fulfilling my deſires, and vouchſafed to heare my prayer; which was, that he would vouchſafe, to ſtirre-vp ſuch kindes of perſons, to his faithfull Seruice.</p>
            <p>And my Soule being then in ſuch condition, as that it could no longer beare ſo greatioy, ſhe went directly out of her ſelf, and loſt her verie ſelf, to be the greater gainer by it. She loſt, I ſay, thoſe cogitations, and conſiderations, and the
<pb n="525" facs="tcp:100776:299"/>
hearing of that Diuine toung, in which the Holie-Ghoſt ſeemed to ſpeake; and then I fell into a great Rapt, which made me, at it were, forgoe the vſe of my Sences, though it laſted but a very little while.</p>
            <p>I ſaw Chriſt our Lord, with an exceſſiue kind of Maieſtie, and Glorie, expreſſing much con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tentment, in that which paſſed there. And ſo himſelf was pleaſed to tell me; as alſo, that I might ſee very clearly, that he loued to be euer preſent, at ſuch diſcourſes; and how much he eſteemes himſelf to be ſerued, in that men take ſuch delight, to ſpeake of him.</p>
            <p>Another time, when I was farre off from hence, I ſaw him lifted-vp by Angells, with much glorie; and I vnderſtood by this Viſion, that his Soule was aduancing apace.</p>
            <p>But ſo it was, that a certaine perſon in the world, to whome he had done much good, and repaired ſome breaches in his reputation, and giuen alſo comfort to his Soule, did yet raiſe a great falſe teſtimonie againſt the honour of this holie man; and he endured it, with much con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tentment, as he alſo did other perſecutions; and performed manie actions, which were greatly for the Seruice of Almightie God. Me thinkes, it is not fitt, to declare more of theſe things, at this preſent. If afterward your Reuerence ſhall thinke otherwiſe (becauſe your ſelf knowes, what they are already) they may alſo be ſet downe heer, for the glorie of Almightie God.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="526" facs="tcp:100776:300"/>
But now, of all theſe things, which I haue de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liuered, about the Prophecies concerning this Houſe; and of others, which I ſhall alſo relate; as alſo of ſeuerall inſtances, in different kindes; they were all accompliſhed, and fulfilled, about a matter of ſome three yeares, before they were knowne; ſome more, and ſome leſſe; as our Lord had declared them to me. And I euer told them ouer, to my Ghoſtlie Father, and to this Widdow, my freind, to whome I had leaue to impart them, as I haue ſayd; and I vnderſtand, that ſhe told them yet to others; and they all know well, that I lye not. Nor will Almightie God, I hope, permit me to be euer ſo miſerable, as, in anie thing, to ſpeake other, then truth; and much leſſe, when it concernes things of ſuch importance.</p>
            <p>But a Brother-in-Law of mine, dying ſuddainly, and I being much troubled at it (becauſe he had not had time, to Confeſſe before,) it was told me, in my Prayer, that my Siſter would alſo dye, after that manner; and therefore, that I ſhould goe thither, and procure to diſpoſe her to dye well. I told this, to my Ghoſtlie Father; and he not permitting me to goe, I heard the ſelf-ſame thing againe, and againe. But when now I told him thus much, he willed me to goe; and ſayd, that nothing would be loſt, by the bargaine: This Siſter of mine, was at a houſe of hers, in the Countrie; &amp; I, going thither, to viſit her, without telling her of the particular cauſe, I gaue her the beſt light I could, concerning all things; and I per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwaded
<pb n="527" facs="tcp:100776:300"/>
her to goe often to Confeſſion, and, in all things, to keep the accounts of her Conſcience, very right, &amp; ſtreight. As for her, ſhe was a very vertuous woeman; and did, as ſhe was deſired, for foure or fiue yeares togeather, before her end; and then ſhe dyed, vpon a ſuddaine, without being ſo much as viſited, and much leſſe Confeſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed. But the happines was, that, according to the cuſtome which ſhe had held, there was little more, then eight dayes expired, after her laſt Confeſſion. This made me a very glad woeman, when I knew of her death; and ſhe ſtayed a very ſhort time, in Purgatorie. Nor is it yet aboue eight dayes, ſince our Lord appeared to me, after I had receaued the Bleſſed Sacrament, and was pleaſed, to let me ſee, how he carried my Siſters ſoule, into glorie.</p>
            <p>In all theſe yeares, from the time, when the particular, concerning her, was told me, till her very death, I forgot not that, which had been giuen me to be vnderſtood, concerning her; as neither alſo, did my Companion. For, as ſoone as ſhe had heard of my Siſters death, ſhe came to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards me, with much admiration, to ſee, how all had been fulfilled, Let our Lord be praiſed for euer, who vouchſafes to take ſuch care of Soules, to the end, that they may not periſh;</p>

            <argument>
               <p>She proſecutes the ſame Diſcourſe, about the Foundation of this Houſe, of our Glorious Father, S. Ioſeph. She ſpeakes of the de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>grees, by vvhich our Lord came to appoint, that holie Pouertie should be ordained there; and of the cauſe, vvhy she came from that Ladie, vvith vvhome she vvas; and of other things alſo, vvhich ſucceeded.</p>
            </argument>
            <p>BVt now, whilſt I was with that Ladie, of whome I haue ſpoken, and with whome I had remained, more then half a yeare, our Lord did ſo ordaine, that a certaine holie woeman of our Order, fell out to come from a place, which was no leſſe, then three-ſcore and then leagues off, from this; and to ariue heer; and to lengthen her way, by ſome leagues, on purpoſe, to ſpeake with me. Our Lord had moued her to this, in the ſelf-ſame yeare, when he moued me, to make another Monaſterie of this Order. And as ſoone as ſhe had entertained this deſire, ſhe ſold what<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſoeuer ſhe poſſeſſed, and went her ſelf, bare-foot, to Rome, to get, and bring-away the Diſpatch of this Buſines. This woeman, is a perſon of much Pennance, and Prayer; and our Lord did her ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nie Fauours; and our B. Ladie appeared to her,
<pb n="529" facs="tcp:100776:301"/>
and required her, ſtill to doe, what ſhe was doing; and ſhe ſerued our Bleſſed Lord, ſo incomparably beyond anie thing that I could doe, that I was in confuſion, euen to appeare in her preſence. She ſhewed me the Diſpatches, which ſhe brought from Rome; and, in thoſe fifteen dayes, which ſhe ſtayd with me, we tooke order, how we would make theſe Monaſteries; and, till I had ſpoken with her, it neuer had come to my know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge, that our Rule, till it was relaxed, did euer command, that none of the Religious Houſes of our Order, ſhould haue anie proprietie, in anie goods. Nor had my ſelf had anie purpoſe, to found anie Monaſterie at all, without Reuenue; for, my intention was, that we ſhould be free from the care of procuring anie ſuch thing, as we might be in neceſſitie, to vſe.</p>
            <p>But this Bleſſed Woeman, hauing been in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtructed by our Lord, was growne to vnderſtand that truth, very well, without being able ſo much, as to read; of which truth, I was ignorant, euen after haueing taken ſo much paines, to read ouer the Conſtitutions of our Order. And as ſoone, as ſhe acquainted me with her purpoſe, I liked it well; though yet, I was afrayd, that it would not be yeilded to; but that they would ſay perhaps, that theſe were but impertinencies; and wiſh, that I would not doe anie thing, whereby others might be put to ſuffer, through my fault. Though yet, in very deed, if I had been alone, I would not haue been detained one minute, from doe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
<pb n="530" facs="tcp:100776:302"/>
it; ſince it would be a Regalo, to my Soule, to obſerue, &amp; follow the Counſailes of <hi>Ieſus-Chriſt</hi> our Lord; for really, his Diuine Maieſtie had al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ready giuen me great deſires, to obſerue Pouertie. So that, for my part, I made no doubt, but that this was beſt; yea and I had long deſired, that it might be poſſible, and compatible with my ſtate, that I might goe begging my bread, for the loue of God, without hauing ſo much, as a houſe, or anie thing els. But only, I was in feare, that if our Bleſſed Lord ſhould not giue the ſelf-ſame deſires to others, which he gaue to me, they would liue, perhaps, with diſguſt; and conſequently, that it might proue a cauſe of ſome diſtraction, or diui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion. For I ſaw, that there were ſome poore Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>naſteries, which liued not with much recollec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion; and I conſidered not, that their not being recollected, was the cauſe of their being ſo poore; and not their Pouertie, the cauſe of their want of Recollection. For, diſtraction makes them not more rich; nor is euer Almightie God wanting to ſuch, as ſerue him. In fine, my Faith was weake; which that, of this Seruant of God, was not.</p>
            <p>But now I, (who would be taking the opinion of ſo manie perſons, for euerie thing, which I was to doe) could find no bodie of this minde; no nor euen my Ghoſtlie Father himſelf; nor yet thoſe other learned men, whome I conſulted in the caſe; but they brought me ſo manie reaſons againſt it, that I knew not, which way to turne my ſelf. For I, for my part, who knew already,
<pb n="531" facs="tcp:100776:302"/>
that it was the Rule of the order, and knew alſo, that it was a point of more perfection, could not perſwade my ſelf, to haue Reuenue. And though ſometimes, they conuinced me, towards their o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pinion, yet ſtill, when I returned to Prayer, and conſidered Chriſt our Lord, ſo very poore, and naked, vpon the Croſſe, I was not able, ſo much as to find patience, for being rich. But I humbly beſought him with teares, to ordaine things, in ſuch ſort, that I might be poore, like him. And I found ſo manie inconueniences, euen in hauing Reuenue, and found it to be ſo great a cauſe of diſquiet, yea and euen of diſtraction alſo, that I did nothing but diſpute the buſines, with thoſe learned men. I wrote alſo about it, to that Reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gious man, of <hi>S. Dominick's Order,</hi> who aſſiſted vs; and he ſent me two ſheets of Paper, which he had written, by way of contradiction, to me; and he grounded himſelf in <hi>Theologie,</hi> for the per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwading me, not to doe it; yea and he told me, that he had ſtudied the point very well. To which I anſwered him, that, for not following my Vo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cation, and for not performing the Vow, which I had made of Pouertie, and embracing the Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſailes of Chriſt our Lord, in all perfection, I meant not to make vſe of his <hi>Theologie,</hi> nor of his Learning; and therefore, that in this caſe, he might be pleaſed to excuſe me.</p>
            <p>For my part, I was very glad, when I found anie Creature, who woud helpe me; and the Ladie, with whome I was, aſſiſted me particular<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly,
<pb n="532" facs="tcp:100776:303"/>
heerin. There were others alſo, who told me inſtantly, at the firſt, that they liked it well; but afterward, when they conſidered it better, they found ſo manie inconueniences, in it, that they were earneſt, in perſwading me, not to proceed therein. But now, I told them heervpon, that if they changed their opinion ſo ſoone, I would hold my ſelf faſt, to the firſt.</p>
            <p>At this time, vpon my entreatie, and becauſe this Ladie had neuer ſeen that holie man <hi>Fray Pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dro de Alcantara,</hi> our Lord was pleaſed, that he ſhould come to her houſe; and he being ſo great a louer of Pouertie, and hauing obſerued, and practiſed it, ſo manie yeares, was not ignorant of the riches, which it contained; and ſo he aſſiſted me much; and commanded me, that I ſhould, by no meanes, forbeare, to carrie-on my deſire. And now, through his opinion, and helpe (he being a perſon, who could beſt giue counſaile in it, as vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtanding the matter in hand, by long experi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence) I reſolued, that I would goe ſeeking no further. And being, one day, recommending the matter earneſtly to Chriſt our Lord, it pleaſed him, to tell me expreſly, That I ſhould, by no meanes, forbeare, to make the Monaſterie, poore; That this was both his Father's will, and his; and That he would help me in it. Now, there were ſo great effects heerof, in a Rapt, which I had, that I could, by no meanes, doubt, but that it was of Almightie God. Another time, he told me, that there was confuſion, in hauing Reuenue; and he
<pb n="533" facs="tcp:100776:303"/>
ſayd alſo other things, in praiſe of Pouertie; aſſur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing me, that no ſuch thing, as was neceſſarie for the life of man, ſhould euer be wanting to ſuch as ſerue him; of which want (as I was ſaying) I neuer was in feare, for my part. Our Lord did alſo turne the hart of the Religious man of <hi>S. Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minick's Order,</hi> of whome I ſayd, that he wrote, to forbid me to make the Monaſterie without Reuenue. And now I was very well pleaſed, vp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on the vnderſtanding of this; and vpon hauing alſo got ſome other Votes, me thought I poſſeſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed all the riches in the world, by reſoluing to liue on Almes, for the loue of our Lord.</p>
            <p>About this time, did my Prouinciall diſcharge his commandment vnder Obedience, which he had impoſed vpon me, for ſtaying there; and left it in mine owne choyce, either to returne, or els to ſtay, for a certaine time. But there was now, an Election of a Prioreſſe, to be made, in our Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>naſterie; and they aduertiſed me, that there were manie, who deſired to impoſe that Charge vpon me; whereof the onlie thought, was of ſo great torment to me, that I could eaſily haue reſolued my ſelf, to endure anie other Martyrdome in the whole world, for the loue of God; but, by no meanes, perſwade my ſelf to this. For, beſides the great trouble, in regard, that they are ſo very ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nie in the Houſe, (which point I neuer liked) and for other reaſons alſo, which did occurr (beſides, that I neuer loued to haue Office, but did euer refuſe them all it ſeemed to me, that it was to put
<pb n="534" facs="tcp:100776:304"/>
my Conſcience it ſelf, in great hazard. And ſo I bleſſed Almightie God, for my not being preſent, in the place; &amp; I wrote alſo, to ſome freinds of mine, that they would not giue me their Vote.</p>
            <p>But when now, I was ſo much pleaſed, not to find my ſelf there, in that noiſe, our Lord told me, that I ſhould by no meanes forbeare to goe. And that, ſince I deſired a Croſſe, there was now, a good great one, prouided for me; and that I muſt not throw it away, but goe on, with reſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lution, and courage; and that he would help me; and therefore that I muſt inſtantly goe. At this, I was mightily troubled, and did nothing but weepe; for I thought, it had been the Croſſe of being Superiour; and (as I was ſaying before) I could not perſwade my ſelf, that this could poſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſibly be good, for my Soule, in anie kind; nor could I find anie reaſon at all, to induce me to it. I related all this Storie, to my Ghoſtlie Father; and he commanded me to be gone; for it was euident<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, of more perfection, to doe ſo; but only, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe the heates were great, I might yet ſtay where I was, ſome few dayes; for feare, leaſt els, the iourney might doe me harme; and that, in ſubſtance, it would ſuffice, if I were there, when the Election ſhould be made.</p>
            <p>But, our Bleſſed Lord hauing ordered things otherwiſe, the buſines of my iourney, was in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtantly to be diſpatched, and done. For, the reſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſnes which I had in my ſelf, was very great, togeather with my euen wanting power, to make
<pb n="535" facs="tcp:100776:304"/>
my Prayer; and it ſeemed alſo to me, withall, that I fell ſhort, in the performance of what our Bleſſed Lord had expreſly commanded me; and the while, I did but paſſe my time there, in eaſe, and pleaſure; That it might ſeem, as if I had no minde at all, to labour, and ſuffer; and That all, was, vpon the matter, but talking, whenſoeuer there grew to be queſtion of ſeruing Almightie God. For els, I being able to be, where it was more perfection for me to find my ſelf, why did I forbeare to effect it? And if I ſhould dye, by the way; in God's name, let me dye. But, in the meane time, (beſides all the reſt) I found my ſelf, with a great preſſing vpon my verie hart; and our Lord, had wholy depriued me, of all kind of guſt, in my Prayer. In a word, I was brought to ſuch a condition, as that now, I was in a great deale of torment; and I humbly prayed the Ladie, where I was, that ſhe would allow me her leaue, to be gone. For already my Ghoſtlie Father, when he found me to be in that caſe, willed me alſo, to beginne my iourney; and our Lord had alſo mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ued him, as well as me. But the Ladic had ſo great a ſenſe of trouble, for my departure, that the ſame, grew alſo to be another torment to me. For, ſhe ſpoke, of how much trouble it had coſt her, to obtaine this fauour of leaue, at the hands of the Prouincial, by meanes of a great deale of importunitie. And really, I held it for a kind of very ſtrange thing, that ſhe would be content, to giue way, heerin; conſidering, how very much,
<pb n="536" facs="tcp:100776:305"/>
ſhe was troubled at it; ſaue only that I conſidered her, as a very great Seruant of Almightie God. And ſo, I telling her once, that my going, impor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted his Seruice much, with manie other things, of that kinde; and letting her alſo know, that it was poſſible, that I might returne to ſee her againe, ſhe grew (with trouble enough) to be yet con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tent, at laſt, that I ſhould goe.</p>
            <p>But now I, for mine owne part, had no diffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cultie at all, in doing it. For, when once I came to vnderſtand, that the thing was of more perfecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on; and that it more imported the Seruice of Al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mightie God, that I ſhould goe, then ſtay, I did (by the contentment, which it gaue me, to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tent him) paſſe eaſily ouer, the paine of leauing that Ladie, whome I ſaw ſo much troubled, at my iourney; as manie other perſons alſo were, to whome I was obliged there, very much; and eſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cially to my Ghoſtlie Father, who was of <hi>the So<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cietie of</hi> IESVS; for, I found my ſelf very happie, in him. But yet, when I ſaw, that I was to want that comfort, for the loue of our Lord, it gaue me contentment, to looſe him. And yet ſtill, I could not well vnderſtand, how this might be. For I ſaw plainly, that theſe contraryes, were in me, at once: To be delighted, To be comforted, and To be ioyed, by that, which yet, did coſt me ſorrow, at the verie hart. For, on the one ſide, I was eaſed, and accommodated, with meanes, and time, to haue manie howers of Prayer; and on the other, I ſaw plainly, that I was to caſt my ſelf, into a kind
<pb n="537" facs="tcp:100776:305"/>
of fire. For already, our Lord had foretold me, as much; and that I went to vndergoe, and carrie a heauie Croſſe; though yet, indeed, I neuer con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiued, that it could poſſibly haue proued ſo very heauie, as I found it to be, afterward. But yet, howſoeuer, I went ſo chearfully on, that I ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>counted my ſelf euen to be deſtroyed, in regard, that I could not caſt my ſelf, inſtantly, into the bat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taile, ſince our Lord had a minde, that I ſhould vndertake it; and ſo, his Diuine Maieſtie gaue me ſtrength; and fetched it, euen out of my verie weaknes. I knew not well, (I ſay,) how this could be; but yet I grew to thinke vpon this Compari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon. If, I poſſeſſing ſome rich Iewell, or anie thing els, which gaue me great contentment, it ſhould happen to me, to know, that ſome perſon, whome I loued, euen better then my ſelf, deſired to haue it, and that I aſpired more, to content him, then to pleaſe my ſelf, it would fall out, in that caſe, that I ſhould enioy more contentment, without that verie thing, then I enioyed before, by the poſſeſſion thereof, ſince it proued to giue con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tentment to that perſon. And therefore now, ſince the contentment, which I haue in content<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing him, exceeds mine owne proper content<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, the trouble, which I might haue, by want<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the Iewell, or euen anie other thing, which I could loue, were taken away; and ſo alſo, would the ſenſe of that contentment be, which it gaue me before. So that, howſoeuer I ſhould haue been in paine, to leaue ſuch perſons, as were ſo
<pb n="538" facs="tcp:100776:306"/>
greatly troubled for my parting from them (the rather, in regard, that I am, euen in condition, and nature, ſo very gratefull, for the Fauours, which are done me, and therefore this accident, if it had ariued, at ſome other time, would haue afflicted me much), yet now, the caſe was ſuch, that I could not be troubled at it, euen though I would. It fell out alſo, in verie deed, to import ſo very much, that I ſhould not haue ſtayd there, one day longer, for as much, as concernes the buſines of this Bleſſed Houſe, that I know not, how it could poſſibly haue been concluded, if I had not gone away, iuſt at that time.</p>
            <p>O greatnes of Almightie God! for I am euen amazed, when I conſider it. But now, I diſcerne very well, that his Diuine Maieſtie, had a particu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lar care, to helpe me; to the end, that we might ſettle, and ſecure, this poore little Corner <note n="*" place="margin">Our Bleſſed Lord, is ſtill as good as his vvord.</note> of God. For really, I hold it to be ſuch; and that it is a Habitation, wherein his Diuine Maieſtie is de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lighted; as he told me himſelf once, when I was in Prayer, That this Houſe was euen the verie Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>radiſe, of his delight. And ſo, very agreably to this, he hath brought certaine Soules hither, in whoſe companie now I liue, with very great <note n="*" place="margin">The great Charity, &amp; Humi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lity of the Saynt.</note> confuſion to my ſelf. For it would not haue been in my power, to haue ſo much as wiſhed for ſuch, as they are, in order to this holie end; they being perſons of ſo great Auſterity, and Pouertie, and Prayer; and carrying all this weight, with ſuch a deale of contentment, and guſt, that there is not
<pb n="539" facs="tcp:100776:306"/>
one Creature, in all the Companie, who doth not hold her ſelf, for wholy vndeſeruing, to haue approached to ſuch a place, as this; and eſpecially ſome, in particular, whome our Lord was pleaſed, to call, from out of the gallanterie, and vanitie of the world; where (according to the lawes of this life) they might haue had contentment enough. But now, our Bleſſed Lord hath giuen them the ſame contentment, ſo farre enlarged, and en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>creaſed, as makes it to be moſt clearly ſeen, That euen heer, they haue a hundred, for one, in com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pariſon of what they left, for his ſake. And now they can neuer ſatisfye themſelues, with giuing him moſt humble thankes, for ſo high a Fauour. He hath alſo changed others, from good, to better. To ſuch, as are very young, he giues both courage, and knowledge; to the end, that they may deſire nothing els; and that they may truly vnderſtand, that, to be ſeuered from all things of this life, is euen heer, a verie enioying, of more repoſe. To them, who are of more yeares, and leſſe health, he giues ſuch a degree of ſtrength, as that they may be able to endure the ſame auſteri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties of Pennance, which the reſt of the Commu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nitie vndergoes.</p>
            <p>O my deare Lord! and how well doth it now appeare, that thou art powerfull? Nor is there anie need, to ſeek out reaſons, and wayes, for thy doing, whatſoeuer thou deſireſt. For euen, aboue the Diſcourſe of our Naturall Reaſon, thou makeſt all things very poſſible; and giueſt vs to vnderſtand
<pb n="540" facs="tcp:100776:307"/>
very well, that, in fine, we haue need of no more, then to loue thee, in good earneſt; and to leaue all things, in good earneſt, for thee. But indeed, it muſt be done, in good earneſt; to the end, that thou, O my Lord, and my God, maiſt make all things eaſie to vs. And heer, it may come hand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſomly in, that thou doſt, but as it were, feigne, or counterfeit, the infuſion of a kind of difficultie, vpon the obſeruing of thy Law. For, as for me, I cannot find, O my Lord, where indeed, that dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficultie is; nor how that way can be accounted ſtrict, or hard, which conducts vs to thee. But I rather plainely ſee, that it is a faire, and Royall way; and no obſcure, and paltrie little path; but a way wherein euerie bodie goes ſafe, who will put himſelf, in good earneſt, vpon the iourney. For, all doubtfull paſſages, and rocks, wherein one may be in danger to catch a Fall, are found to be very farre off, from hence; in regard, that heer we are ſo very remote, from all occaſions of Sinne. But I call that other, a path, and a wicked path; and a narrow, and very dangerous way; which, on the one ſide, hath a huge deep valley, into which one may fall; and on the other, a hide<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous rock, with a precipice, from whence, vpon a verie inſtant, ere he be aware, he may breake his neck, and his bones, into a thouſand peices.</p>
            <p>He, who loues thee, O thou, my eternall Good, with realitie of truth, goes ſecurely, by a Royall, ſafe, and large way; which lyes farre from all ſuch precipices of danger. And no ſooner
<pb n="541" facs="tcp:100776:307"/>
hath ſuch an one, tript neuer ſo little, but inſtant<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, thou, O Lord, lendeſt him thy hand, to helpe him vp. Nor will, euen a Fall, nor manie Falls, be his ruine, if he loue thee, and not the things of this world. Such an one, walkes by the Valley of Hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>militie; nor am I able to vnderſtand, why anie Creature ſhould be afrayd, to put himſelf into this way of Perfection. And I beſeech our Bleſſed Lord, (euen by what he is) that he will giue vs rightly to vnderſtand, how ill, that ſecuritie is, which we looke for, in the midſt of ſuch manifeſt dangers, as where, one is to be ſtill, trudging on, in the ranke, and row of the world; and that we may beleiue, our true ſecuritie, and ſafetie, to conſiſt, in our procuring, to be ſtill going on, in the way of doing Seruice, to Almightie God. Away, away; let vs all fix our eyes vpon him; and let vs not haue anie feare, that this Sunne of Iuſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tice, will ſet, or euer permit vs, to walke in ſuch ſort, by night, as that we may grow to be loſt, vnleſſe we firſt reſolue to leaue him. Nor let vs feare to walke, euen in the midſt of Lyons, of whome, euerie one ſeemes greedie, to be carrying<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>away his ſeuerall peice; and theſe are certaine things, which the world is wont to call, by the name of Honours, and great Eſtates, and Delights. And the Diuel, on the other ſide, ſeemes alſo will<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing heer, to fright vs, with certaine friuolous toyes. A <note n="*" place="margin">Hovv deuout, this deare Saynt is.</note> thouſand times ouer, I am amazed; and ten thouſand times, would I deſire, euen to diſſolue my ſelf, with powring forth my teares; &amp; to cry<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out

to the whole world, all at once, to proclaime mine owne great wickednes, and blindnes; ſo to try, if that, might doe anie good, towards the making men, at laſt, open their eyes.

            <p>BEing parted from that Cittie, where I was, I paſſed with much contentment, by the way, reſoluing to vndertake, and goe through, with all things, which our Lord ſhould be pleaſed to lay vpon me; and that, with a moſt franke, and entire ſubmiſſion, of my whole hart. Now, the ſelfe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſame
<pb n="543" facs="tcp:100776:308"/>
night, when I ariued at <hi>Auila,</hi> our Diſpatch, with the <hi>Breue</hi> from <hi>Rome,</hi> ariued alſo there. So that, I was amazed at it; and ſo alſo were all they, who knew of the haſt, wherewith our Lord had ſollicited me, to come away; when they alſo knew withall, the great neceſſitie, which there was thereof, and the coniuncture alſo otherwiſe, which appeared then. For, I found the Biſhop there, and that holie man, <hi>Fray Pedro de Alcantara,</hi> and a certaine Caualier alſo, a very great Seruant of our Lord, in whoſe houſe, that holie man <hi>Fray Pedro,</hi> was lodged. For, that Caualier, was a per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon, with whome, generally, the Seruants of Al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mightie God, were euer wont, to find a ſafe re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>treat. Now, both thoſe perſons, ioyning togea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, obtained ſo much, at the Biſhop's hands, as that he was content to admit of the Monaſterie; which was not a thing of ſmall importance, con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſidering that it muſt liue vpon Almes. But the Biſhop was really a friend to ſuch, as were indeed reſolued to ſerue our Lord; for inſtantly, he would apply himſelf to doe them fauour. But the approbation of that holie old man, and his deal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing earneſtly, with ſeuerall perſons, to aſſiſt vs, was the thing, which made an end of the worke.</p>
            <p>If I had not chanced to ariue in this verie con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iuncture, as I haue ſayd, I know not, how the beſines could poſſibly haue been diſpatched; for, this holie man ſtayd a very little while, heer; and I thinke, not aboue eight dayes; and euen then, he was very ill, at eaſe; and ſhortly after that
<pb n="544" facs="tcp:100776:309"/>
time, our Lord tooke him out of the world, to himſelf. And it ſeemed indeed, that his Diuine Maieſtie had preſerued him, in this world, till iuſt this buſines might be diſpatched; for it had been long, (that is, I thinke, a matter of two yeares,) ſince he had been very ill, in point of health.</p>
            <p>But all that, which they reſolued now, was to be gouerned with a great deale of ſecrecie; for els, nothing would haue taken effect; ſo ill was the people conceited of it, as appeared afterward. Now, our Lord diſpoſed things ſo, that a Brother<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in-Law of mine, ſhould be ſick, at that verie time; and that his wife ſhould not be heer; but that he muſt be in ſo very great need of helpe, that they gaue me leaue to goe, and be with him; and ſo, by occaſion of that, there was nothing knowne; howſoeuer ſomewhat grew to be ſuſpected, con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerning ſome perſons, though yet it were not fully beleiued. And it is a thing, to make men wonder, how my Brother-in-Law, continued no longer ſick, then ſeemed to be iuſt neceſſarie, for our buſines; and ſhould recouer his health, iuſt as ſoone as it was fitt; to the end, that ſo, both I, might be diſengaged, and he might leaue his houſe free. But our Lord, as I was ſaying did in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtantly reſtore his health; at which, the Patient was in wonder. Yet euen then, had I difficultie enough to procure, by meanes of manie different perſons, to make them giue way, that the buſines might goe forward; and; both with the ſick man, and with the workmen, that the Houſe might be
<pb n="545" facs="tcp:100776:309"/>
finiſhed, out of hand; and be put into the Forme of a Monaſterie. For, there was very much of it vnfiniſhed, at that time; and my Companion was then, not heer; for we held it indeed more con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uenient, that ſhe ſhould be abſent, for the better hiding of the buſines; and I ſaw, that it was of extreame importance, that all ſhould be diſpatch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, with diligence, for manie reaſons; and for this, amongſt the reſt, becauſe it was feared euerie hower, that they would ſend me away.</p>
            <p>In the meane time, I had ſo manie occaſions of vexation, and trouble, that I might haue cauſe to doubt, whether this were not that Croſſe, whereof I was warned; though on the other ſide, it ſeemed, that this was but a little one, in compa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riſon of that other great Croſſe, which our Lord had formerly ſayd, that I was to beare.</p>
            <p>But yet, all being now concluded, our Lord was pleaſed, that ſome ſhould take the Habit, vp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on S. Bartholomews day; at which time, the B. Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crament was expoſed, with all the Solemnity, and deuotion, which we could poſſibly vſe. And ſo, the Monaſterie of our moſt Glorious Father <hi>S. Io<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeph,</hi> fell out to be erected, and made, in the Yeare of our Lord God, One thouſand, fiue hundred, ſeauentie two. And it came then, to my turne, (togeather with two others of our former Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>naſterie, who, by accident, were abroad, at that time) to giue them the Habit. But now, ſince the Houſe where the Monaſtery fell out to be made, was that, wherein my Brother-in-Law, had dwelt
<pb n="546" facs="tcp:100776:310"/>
before, (for he, as I ſayd, had bought it, the better to diſguiſe this buſines) I had leaue to ſtay there. And I did nothing at all, but by the opinion of learned men; that ſo I might be ſure, not to depart, one haires breadth, from my Obedience. And when they ſaw, that the thing was to be ſo aduan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tagious to the whole Order, in manie reſpects, they told me, I might doe as I did; though yet, it were fitt to proceed with great reſeruation, and ſecrecie; and to take care, that my Superiours might not know, what I was doing. For, how little ſoeuer the imperfection had been, which I muſt haue committed therein, I conceaue, that I would haue giuen-ouer the erecting, I ſay not, of one Monaſterie, but of a thouſand, rather then haue falne into it; and this, is certaine. And though I deſired, to ſeuer my ſelf, wholy, from the world, that ſo I might follow my Profeſſion, and Call<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, with more perfection, and Clauſure, I deſir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed it yet, in ſuch ſort, as that, whenſoeuer I ſhould come to vnderſtand, that it was to be, for the greater Seruice of Almightie God, to giue it ouer, I would inſtantly haue been ſure, to doe it, with entire peace, and repoſe.</p>
            <p>But the while, it was a kind of being euen in glorie, for me, to ſee the B. Sacrament expoſed; and that, foure poore <note n="*" place="margin">They vvere very noble, though they vvere poore.</note> Orphans were prouided for, ſince they were taken without Dowrie; and they were very great Seruants of Almightie God. For, this was much endeauoured, at the begin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, that ſuch perſons ſhould enter, and be re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceaued,
<pb n="547" facs="tcp:100776:310"/>
as might lay a good foundation, by their example, for the better effecting the intention, and deſigne, which we had, to carrie all things on, with much perfection, and Prayer; and that ſuch a worke, in fine, might be finiſhed, as were to proue, for the Seruice of our Bleſſed Lord, and in honour of the Habit of his Glorious Mother; for vpon this, did all the anxieties of my care, worke, and beate. And it gaue me alſo great comfort, to haue done expreſly that, which our Bleſſed Lord had been pleaſed to command me; and that there might be one Church more, (and the ſame be dedicated, vnder the name of my Glorious Father, <hi>S. Ioſeph)</hi> then there was before. Not yet, that I conceaued my ſelf, to haue done anie thing in it, at all; for, I neuer had anie ſuch conceipt; neither haue I yet; but I euer vnderſtand, that it is our Bleſſed Lord, who did it; and that, as much as concerned my part, was accompanied with ſo great imperfections, that I rather plainly ſee, that there is much more, for which to blame me, then to thanke me. But yet I muſt confeſſe, that it goes with me for a great Regalo, to ſee, that his Diuine Maieſtie was pleaſed to vſe me, as an inſtrument (I being ſo very wicked, as I am) for ſo great a worke, as this. So that, in fine, I remain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed with much ſatisfaction, and guſt, in this be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>halfe; and, as it were, euen out of my ſelf, in great depth of Prayer.</p>
            <p>But now, vpon the end of all this, which might laſt about ſome three, or foure howers, the Diuel
<pb n="548" facs="tcp:100776:311"/>
procured to giue me ſuch a kind of Spirituall battaile, as I will now declare. He <note n="*" place="margin">The Diuell is ſtill, him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelfe.</note> repreſented to me a doubt, whether that, which I had done, had been well done; whether I had not gone a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt my obligation of Obedience, by procuring to effect certaine things, without hauing been di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rected therein, by my Prouinciall; That I might very well imagine, that my carriage had been of diſguſt to him, in regard, that I had ſubmitted the buſines, to the Ordinarie, and that, without ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uing acquainted him with it, before; though yet, on the other ſide, it be true, that when he would not admit of the Foundation, and ſaw, that I did not alter my courſe, I might probably enough imagine, that he would not care much, though it went on; and Whether theſe new Religious, would be content to liue in ſo great reſtraint; Whether, they were not to want bread, to eate; Whether the whole buſines, were not an abſurd, and fooliſh thing; and Who, in fine, muſt put me vpon it, ſince already I had a Monaſterie of mine owne.</p>
            <p>But now, all that, which our Bleſſed Lord had commanded me; and all thoſe opinions of the learned men, whome I had conſulted; and all the Prayer, which I had cauſed to be made, and that, in effect, without ceaſing; yea and alſo for the ſpace of more, then two whole yeares; all this, I ſay, was as abſolutly ſlipped out of my memorie, as if it had neuer been there; and I only remem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bred now, that I did it according to mine owne
<pb n="549" facs="tcp:100776:311"/>
opinion. But all the vertues, and Faith, which I had before, were ſuſpended in me then, without my hauing ſtrength, either to act anie thing, or euen ſo much, as to defend my ſelf, againſt ſo manie aſſaults.</p>
            <p>The Diuel was alſo tampering with me, and ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>amined me, how it came to paſſe, that I would needs goe ſhut my ſelf vp, in ſo ſtraight a Houſe; and that, with ſo manie infirmities vpon my back; and how I would be able to vndergoe ſo great Pennance, and giue ouer to liue, in ſo good<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lie, and delightfull a place, as the other was, where I had alwaies had ſo much guſt, and ſo manie freinds; and perhaps, theſe others, would not proue ſo; That I had taken very much vpon me; That, perhaps, it would coſt me deſpaire, at the laſt; That the Diuel had pretended, but to depriue me of repoſe, and peace, that ſo I might not be able to frequent Prayer; and to make me grow diſordered, and diſturbed; and ſo, by thoſe de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>grees, to looſe my Soule.</p>
            <p>Such things as theſe, aſſembled in ſuch ſort as I haue related, did the Diuel take care, to ſet be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore me; and ſo, as that it was not almoſt in my power, ſo much as once to thinke, of anie thing els; and by this meanes, did he bring ſuch an afflic<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, and obſcuritie, or rather downe-right dark<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nes vpon my hart, as I am not able to expreſſe. But now, when I found my ſelf to be in this caſe, I went to viſit the Bleſſed Sacrament; though yet I was not able to recommend my Soule, to it; as
<pb n="550" facs="tcp:100776:312"/>
finding my ſelf, in my opinion, with a certaine kind of profound affliction, as if then, I had been, in no leſſe, then the verie agonie of death. To treat with anie bodie, about it, I was not yet to preſume; for there was not yet ſo much, as a Ghoſtlie Father appointed for me. O my deare Lord! what a miſerable kind of life is this, which we lead, where there is no ſecure contentment, nor anie thing, which is not ſubiect to change? It <note n="*" place="margin">This is ſuch a kind of vvorld, as vvhere<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in, things vvill euer goe thus.</note> was ſo very very lately, that, me thought, I would not haue exchanged my condition (in the way of being content) with anie Creature of the whole world; and now, the ſelf-ſame cauſe, euen of the ſelf-ſame contentment, did ſo torment me, that I knew not what to doe with my ſelf. O that we would looke, with attention, vpon the things of this world! for, euerie bodie would then be quickly able to find, by experience, how little he were to lodge, either his contentment, or diſcon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tentment, vpon it. It is moſt certaine, in my opi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion, that this was one of the feirceſt kind of fitts of affliction, that euer I had endured, in my whole life. And it ſeemes, as if my verie Spirit, had half prophecied, how, much did ſtill reſt behind, to be endured; though yet, that ariued not ſo farre, as this, if it had continued.</p>
            <p>But now, our Bleſſed Lord did not permit this poore Seruant of his, to ſuffer long; nor did he euer faile, to ſuccour me, in my tribulations; nor did he alſo, in this. For now he gaue me a little <note n="*" place="margin">A true anſvver to all the Diuells Obiecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons.</note> light, wherewith to ſee, that all this, was
<pb n="551" facs="tcp:100776:312"/>
of the Diuel; and that I might diſcerne the truth; and that the whole buſines, was but to put me into a fright, by lyes; and ſo, I came, by degrees, to call to mind, and to recouer the great reſolu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions, which I had formerly conceaued, towards the Seruice of our Bleſſed Lord; as alſo my deſires, to ſuffer for him. And ſo I grew alſo to conſider, that if, really, I intended to fulfill them, I was not to buſie my ſelf, about procuring reſt, and eaſe; but if I would endure afflictions, that this was the true way, to merit; and that, if I would goe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>through with them, for the Seruice of Almightie God, they would be in ſtead of Purgatorie, for me; &amp; of what was I afrayd? &amp; that, ſince I deſired afflictions, theſe, which were offered now, would be very fitt, &amp; good; and that, where the greateſt contradiction was felt, the richeſt gaine would be found; and why ſhould my hart faile me, for his Seruice, to whome I owed ſo much? And by theſe, and other conſiderations, and employing all the courage I had, I made a promiſe, in preſence of the B. Sacrament, to doe all the verie vttermoſt, that I could, to get leaue to come to this Monaſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terie; as alſo, if I might doe it, with ſafe conſci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence, to promiſe Clauſure.</p>
            <p>But now, at my reſoluing vpon this, the Diuel fled inſtantly away, and left me very quiet, and contented; and ſo I haue remained euer ſince. And all that, which is obſerued in this Houſe, either by way of Incloſure, or Pennance, in anie kind, hath made it ſelf both very delightfull, and
<pb n="552" facs="tcp:100776:313"/>
ſeems very little. And the contentment, on the other ſide, is ſo extreamly great, that I am think<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, ſeuerall times, if I were able to find anie thing, in the whole world, which could be of ſo much guſt to me, as this. I knew not alſo, whether, perhaps, euen this, might not be the true reaſon, why I enioy better health now, then euer; or els that, perhaps, our Lord would haue it ſo, becauſe perhaps, there might be ſome neceſſarie vſe there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of; and becauſe it is but reaſon, that I ſhould alſo doe thoſethings, which are performed by all the reſt; and therefore, that he is pleaſed, to giue me ſo much comfort, as to be able to doe it, though yet, it be with ſome little trouble. But certainly all they, who ſee it, and are priuie to the great in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firmities, to which I am ſubiect, be amazed at it. Bleſſed be our Lord, who giues it all; and hath power enough, wherewith to doe it.</p>
            <p>But I failed not, in the meane time, to be very well wearied, with ſuch a ſtiffe contention, and ſtrife, as this, though yet, I laughed at the Diuel; for I clearly ſaw, it was he. And I conceaue, that our Bleſſed Lord would permit it, becauſe I neuer knew, till then, what it was, to be in anie diſguſt, for being a Religious woeman; Nor did I euer find anie, during the ſpace of eight and twentie yeares, and more, that I had been one. But now, his Diuine Maieſtie permitted it to come vpon me, to the end, that I might the better vnderſtand the great Fauour, which it had pleaſed our Lord, to doe me in that State; yea and the torment, from
<pb n="553" facs="tcp:100776:313"/>
which he had freed me; as alſo, to the end, that, if afterward I ſaw anie one, who ſhould be afflicted in the ſame kind, I might not be frighted at it, but might both haue compaſſion of her, and know alſo, how to giue her comfort, if there ſhould be cauſe.</p>
            <p>But now hauing paſſed this brunt, and being deſirous to reſt a little, when I ſhould haue dined, (for, in all the night before, I had taken none; as alſo in manie other nights, I had not failed of care, and trouble enough, when yet I was alſo tired out, in the dayes; as they knew, very well, what paſſed, not only in the Monaſterie, but in the Cittie, there was growne, to be a great deale of noiſe, and diſquiet, vpon the occaſions, which haue been formerly touched, yea and there ſeem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, to be ſome coulour, for the ſame) iuſt then, the Prioreſſe required me, to be called; and that I muſt goe to her, at the inſtant. And meeting with her commandment, I left my Religious, full of paine, and care, and ſo, inſtantly, went to her. But I then perceaued well, that I was to be ſure of troubles enow; though yet the Houſe, being then diſpatched, I was not in very much paine. Howſoeuer, I betooke my ſelf to Prayer, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeeching our Bleſſed Lord, to be good to me; and begging of my Father <hi>S. Ioſeph,</hi> that he would bring me back againe, to his Houſe; and, in the meane time, I offered-vp all that, which I might chance to endure, for his ſake; and I was to be very well pleaſed, if it fell out, that I might ſuffer
<pb n="554" facs="tcp:100776:314"/>
anie thing for him, or be able to ſerue him. And ſo I went away, with opinion, that they would inſtantly commit me to Priſon. Whereby I yet conceaue, that they would ſo, haue done me, a great deale of pleaſure; for then, I ſhould not haue been vexed with their talking; and I ſhould haue enioyed a little Solitude, whereof I was in very great want; for they had euen, as it were, grinded me to duſt, by forcing me, to conuerſe ſo long, with ſuch a multitude of people.</p>
            <p>But being then ariued, and hauing giuen ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count of my ſelf, to the Superiour, ſhe was a little appeaſed; and they all agreed, to ſend me to the Prouincial; and ſo the Cauſe was to depend, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore him. And as ſoone, as I was come thither, for Iudgement, I found my ſelf with much con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tentment, to ſee, that I was ſuffering ſomewhat, for the loue of our Lord. For, as for hauing done anie thing, either againſt his Diuine Maieſtie, or yet againſt the Order, I conceaued not, that I had offended, but rather had endeauoured to aug<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment it, to the vttermoſt of my power; and would be glad, with my whole hart, to dye for it. For, all my deſires were, that it might be fulfilled, ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to the vttermoſt perfection. But in the meane time, I called to minde the Sentence, which was paſſed vpon Chriſt our Lord; and I acknowledged, what a Nothing this was, in re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpect of his. I accuſed my ſelf then, as in fault, yea and as very faultie; and ſo I make no doubt, but I was, in the opinions of all them, who knew not
<pb n="555" facs="tcp:100776:314"/>
very much, of the Cauſe. And after they had giuen me a great reprehenſion, (though not yet, with ſo much rigour, as the fault might ſeem to deſerue; and as manie of them told the Prouincial, that I had committed) I was abſolutly, for my part, reſolued, to hold on this courſe. And ſo I rather deſired, that they ſhould pardon me; and then puniſh me, if they would; but by no meanes, remaine vnkinde, or ill-affected, towards me.</p>
            <p>In ſome things, I plainly ſaw, that they had no reaſon at all, againſt me; but that they condem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned me, without cauſe; as when they ſayd, I had done, whatſoeuer I had done, to the end, that I might be held in great opinion, and to be talked of; and ſuch other toyes, as that. But in others, I ſaw clearly, that they ſayd true; as namely, that I was much worſe, then the reſt; and that, ſince I had not kept the Obſeruances of that Houſe, which were maintained, with ſo much pietie, and deuotion there, how could I come to thinke of performing another Rule, of more rigour? and, that this, was but to raiſe-vp nouelties in the world, and to ſcandalize the people.</p>
            <p>But yet, all this, cauſed no tumult in my hart, nor put mee to anie paine at all; though yet I ſhewed to be in ſome; leaſt otherwiſe, they might conceaue, that I vndervalued what they ſayd. But, in fine, the Prouincial commanded me, to giue account of my ſelf, to them of the former Monaſtery, and that I muſt neceſſarily doe it. And ſo, being at great peace within my ſelf; and
<pb n="556" facs="tcp:100776:315"/>
our Lord aſſiſting me therein; I gaue ſuch a diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>charge of my actions, as that neither the Prouin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cial, nor the Religious Woemen, who were in that Aſſemblie, found anie thing, for which to condemne me. After this, I ſpoke more plainly to him, in priuate; and I did it alſo more at large; and he was very well ſatisfyed with me; and pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſed me, that, if the Cittie ſhould proceed to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards a being quiet againe, he would giue me leaue to goe to my Monaſterie. But the diſorder, and diſtemper of the Cittie, was ſo very great, as I ſhall now declare.</p>
            <p>Within two or three dayes, after that time, the Gouernour, and other Magiſtrates of the Towne, and ſome alſo of the Chapter of the Cathedrall Church, mett togeather; and they all declared ioyntly, That, by no meanes, they muſt permit the worke, to goe forward; That it would reſult, to the euide<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t diſaduantage of the Common-Wealth; That they muſt not faile, to remoue the B. Sacra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, from thence; and, by no meanes, permit the buſines, to proceed. One onlie Doctour of <hi>S. Dominick's Order,</hi> although he were of a con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trarie opinion to vs (I meane not, in that point of the Monaſterie, but in that other, of being in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>capable of Reuenue, and Poore) ſayd, that there was no cauſe, why the Houſe ſhould inſtantly be diſſolued, after that manner, but that it ought to be well conſidered; That there would be time enough, for this; That it was a Caſe, which be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>longed to the Biſhop; and diuerſe other things, of
<pb n="557" facs="tcp:100776:315"/>
this kind, which did very much good to the bu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſines. For, conſidering how great the furie of the people was, it was happie, that they did not put the diſſoluing of the Houſe, preſently, in execu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion. And this ſhewed, that the thing, in fine, was to take effect; and that our Bleſſed Lord, was pleaſed, to haue it ſo; and that they all could doe little, againſt his will, and pleaſure; but yet, they all aſſigned their reaſons, and expreſſed good zeale, in what they ſayd. And yet thus, without their giuing offence to Almightie God, they made both me, and diuerſe others ſuffer, who fauoured the Buſines.</p>
            <p>The tumultuous diſpoſition of the people, was ſo great, that now there was no talke of anie thing els; and they all agreed, in condemning me; and in going to complaine of me, to the Prouincial, and to my Monaſterie. As for me, I was no more troubled, at what they ſayd, then if they had not ſayd it; but the onlie feare I had, was, whether, or no, they would diſſolue the Houſe; for, this put me to a great deale of paine; and ſo alſo did it, to ſee, that the perſons, who aſſiſted me, loſt credit, and were otherwiſe alſo put to much inconuenience by it. But as for that, which they ſayd of me, I was rather glad of it, then otherwiſe. And if I had had anie Faith, it would haue made no alteration in me at all; but when there is a want in ſome one vertue, all the reſt are wont to be caſt into a kind of ſlumber. And ſo I was much troubled, during thoſe two
<pb n="558" facs="tcp:100776:316"/>
dayes, wherein the two Aſſemblies, whereof I ſpake, were made amongſt the people. And I being very much afflicted, our Lord ſaid theſe words to me: <hi>Doſt thou not knovv, that I am povver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full? Of vvhat art thou afrayd?</hi> And thus did he aſſure me, that the Houſe ſhould not be diſſolued; whereby I remained full of comfort.</p>
            <p>But then, did they diſpatch their Agents, or Sollicitours, to the Councell Royall, with their Informations; and ſo, there came order from thencė, to ſend a Relation thither, of the whole proceeding. So that heet, we might behold the beginning of a great Suite in Law; for already, ſome were gone to the Court, on the part of the Cittie; &amp; others were inſtantly to goe, on the part of the Monaſterie; and, on the other ſide, neither had we anie monie, nor did I know, what to doe; but our Lord prouided all things, for vs. And as for me, my Father Prouinciall did neuer forbid me to deale in it; for he is ſo true a friend to all Vertue, that, although he did not aſſiſt in the worke, yet he would not be againſt it; though yet withall, it be very true, that he would neuer giue me leaue, to paſſe to this new Monaſterie, till he might ſee, what kind of end the Buſines would haue. In the meane time, the Seruants of God, were all alone, and did more, with their prayers, then all that, which I was able to doe, by way of negotiation; though yet ſtill, it were ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſarie, to vſe diligence enough. Sometimes it would ſeem, that all was wanting; and eſpecially
<pb n="559" facs="tcp:100776:316"/>
one day, before the Prouinciall came hither, when the Prioreſſe commanded me, not to treat anie more, about that buſines, but to giue it vt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terly ouer. But then went I to Almightie God, and ſayd: O my Lord; This Houſe is not mine, but it was made for thee; and now, there is no Creature, to negotiate the buſines for vs; and therefore, thy Diuine Maieſtie muſt be pleaſed to doe it. Heervpon, I found my ſelf really, and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtantly, at ſo great eaſe, and ſo without anie man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner of trouble, as if I had had the whole world, on my ſide, to employ it ſelf for me; and ſo I held all the buſines, to be in ſafetie. Vpon this, a cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taine Prieſt, a very great Seruant of Almightie God, who had aſſiſted me alwaies, and was a great freind, and fauourer of all Perfection, went to the Court, to follow the buſines; and laboured in it very much; and ſo alſo, that holie Caualier, of whome I made mention before, did very much therein, and ſhewed it fauour, in all kinds. He endured alſo great troubles, and per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſecutions for it, otherwiſe; and I found him euer, like a Father, to it; and ſo I doe alſo, to this day. And our Lord did ſtill inſpire them, who were our freinds, with ſuch a deale of feruour, that euerie one of them, tooke our buſines to hart, as much as if it had been properly, his owne; and as if his whole honour, and life, had been con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerned in it; though yet, they had indeed, no other intereſt, then only, in regard, that they thought, it did import the Seruice of Almightie God.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="560" facs="tcp:100776:317"/>
But now, it ſeemes clearly, that his Diuine Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ieſtie, aſſiſted the good, and vertuous Prieſt, who was alſo a Doctour; and he indeed, was one of them, who helped vs moſt; for, the Biſhop em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ployed him about it, in his name, in a certaine great <hi>Giunta,</hi> or publique Meeting, which was framed about it; and therein, he ſtood alone, for vs, againſt them all; and, in fine, he found meanes to appeaſe them. For, he made a kind of ouerture, by a certaine way, which was ſufficient, to entertaine, and ſuſpend their proceeding; &amp; indeed there was not anie one, who could other<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe haue ſufficed, to keepe them from reſoluing inſtantly, to employ euen their verie liues, for the ouerthrowing of the Buſines. This Seruant of God, of whome I ſpeake, was alſo the man, who gaue the Habit to the Religious, and ſet-vp the B. Sacrament there; and he was ſubiect to perſecu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion enough, for his labour.</p>
            <p>This batterie continued about half a yeare; and, to relate in particular manner, the great troubles, which paſſed in all that time, would be along buſines. For my part, I wondred extream<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, at what a coyle the Diuel kept againſt a few poore Woemen; and how euerie bodie could vnderſtand, that, forſooth, twelue Religious, and a Prioreſſe (for, they were no more) could be thought, to be of ſuch miſcheif, to a whole Cittie. I meane, ſuch miſcheif to them, who op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſed it; but as for the Religious, they were, in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed, of ſo auſtere life, that, if anie hurt, or errour,
<pb n="561" facs="tcp:100776:317"/>
were to grow by that deſigne, it muſt be only to them. And as for being of preiudice to the place, it carried not ſo much, as anie apparance; and yet they could meet with enow, who would find meanes (and that, forſooth, with good conſcience) to croſſe it. But yet now at length, they came ſo farre, as to affirme, that (prouided alwaies, that they would get Reuenue, and liue vpon it) they were content to giue way, and that the Buſines might goe on.</p>
            <p>For my part, I was then ſo wearie, to ſee all them, who aſſiſted vs, in ſo great trouble (which I regarded much more, then mine owne) that I grew to be of opinion, that it would not be very ill done, to accept their Licence, vnder the condi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of hauing Reuenue, till the times might grow quieter by degrees; and that ſo, we might get to be without it, afterward. At other times, I, being very imperfect, and wicked, beganne to thinke, that perhaps our Lord would not miſlike, that it ſhould be ſo, ſince we could not obtaine our end, otherwiſe; and therefore, I was already growne, to conſent to this Accord. But being in Prayer, the night before the finall concluſion thereof, when the Accord was euen already begunne, our Lord commanded me, that I ſhould conſent to no ſuch thing, as they intended; and that, if we be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ganne to take Reuenue, they would neuer giue vs leaue to forgoe it; and diuerſe other things, he alſo told me. The ſelf ſame night, that holie Crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, <hi>Fray Pedro de Alcantara,</hi> appeared to me; for
<pb n="562" facs="tcp:100776:318"/>
then he was dead. And before alſo he dyed, he wrote to me; and taking notice of the great op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſition, &amp; perſecution, which was raiſed againſt vs, he ſayd, he was hartily glad, that this Foun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dation was made with ſo great contradiction, and how that, ſerued him for a ſigne, that our Lord would grow to be greatly ſerued in this Monaſterie, ſince the Diuel tooke ſuch paines, to hinder it. But yet, he perſwaded vs ſtill, that we ſhould, by no meanes, accept of liuing vpon Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uenue; yea and he preſſed this point, in two or three ſeuerall parts of the ſame Letter; and told me, that if we perſiſted therein, we ſhould grow to effect the Buſines, according to our owne de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſire. I had already ſeen him, at two other ſeuerall times, after his death; and I beheld the much glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rie, wherein he was; and he gaue me no appre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>henſion of feare at all, but rather ioyed me much; for he neuer appeared to me, but in the qualitie of a Glorifyed Bodie; yea and full of exceſſiue glorie; and ſo accordingly, he gaue me great ioy to ſee him; ſaue, that he partly ſhewed himſelf, with a kind of ſeueritie, or rigour, when he told me, that, in no caſe, I ſhould accept of Reuenue; and why would I not follow his counſaile? And ſo he inſtantly vaniſhed; and I remained amazed. I went therefore, the next day, to that Caualier (he being the perſon, to whome we ſtill carried all the buſines, as to one, who aſſiſted vs moſt, therein) and I told him, what had paſſed; and that he ſhould, by no meanes, agree, to take anie Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uenue,
<pb n="563" facs="tcp:100776:318"/>
but rather, to let the Suite goe on. Now, he was euen much more earneſtly of the ſame mind, then I was my ſelf; and was very glad, to find me of his; and afterward told me alſo, how vnwillingly he euer ſpoke, about making anie a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>greement, or compoſition.</p>
            <p>But a certaine other perſon, beganne againe, ere long, to declare himſelf againſt vs; and truly, ſhe was a good Seruant of Almighty God; but yet ſhe wiſhed (though ſhe might haue good in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tentions therein) that ſince the buſines was in ſo good ſtate, they might doe well, to put it into the hands of Lawyers. Vpon this, I had a great deale of diſquiet; for, ſome of them, who aſſiſted me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>grew alſo to be of that opinion; though yet, in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed, it were a verie trick of the Diuel; and per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>haps, it was a morſell of the hardeſt deſgeſtion, of all the reſt. But our Lord aſſiſted me in all; for, that, is the ſumme of the buſines; and it is no eaſie thing, to giue all that, to be well vnderſtood, which paſſed, between the beginning, and finiſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, of this Monaſterie; although this laſt half yeare, and the other, which was the firſt, were the moſt troubleſome parts of the whole time.</p>
            <p>Yet now, the Cittie being growne, in ſome ſort, to be appeaſed, that Father of <hi>S. Dominick's Order,</hi> who was a Graduate in <hi>Theologie,</hi> layd ſo handſomly about him (though he were not pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent then) that he aſſiſted vs much. Our Lord brought him alſo afterward, in a certaine con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iuncture of time, when he did vs a great deale of
<pb n="564" facs="tcp:100776:319"/>
good; and it ſeemed, that his Diuine Maieſtie had induced him to that iourney, for that onlie pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe. For, himſelf told me afterwards; that he had no occaſion at all, to come, but only, by haueing heard of this buſines; and that he grew to know of it, meerly, by chance. He ſtayed heer, as long as was neceſſarie; and when he was returning home, he procured, by certaine meanes, which he vſed, that our Father Prouincial ſhould giue leaue, both that I, and ſome others alſo, might come to ſtay, at our new Monaſterie; which yet ſeemed a kind of impoſſible thing, for him to grant, ſo ſoone; yea and that I might alſo doe the office of teaching, and inſtructing ſuch, as were there already. But the day, when I got thither, was of extreame comfort to my hart. For, being in Prayer in the Church, before I entred into the Monaſterie, and being in a kind of Rapt, I ſaw Chriſt our Lord appeare; and, me thought, he re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceaued me with great loue, and put a Crowne vpon my head; &amp; gaue me tha<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>kes for the Seruice, which I had done to his Mother. At another time alſo, we being all, in the Quire, and in Prayer, after <hi>Compline,</hi> I ſaw our B. Ladie, in exceſſiue glorie, with a white Mantle, vpon, and about her; and ſhe ſeemed to ſhelter, and protect vs all, vnder that Mantle; and I vnderſtood, how high a degree of glorie, our Bleſſed Lord would vouchſafe to the Religious of that Houſe.</p>
            <p>When we came once to celebrate the Office of the Church, the deuotion, which the people
<pb n="565" facs="tcp:100776:319"/>
beganne to carrie towards vs, was very great; and already, there grew to come more Religious to vs; and our Lord beganne alſo, to incline euen them, to doe vs moſt fauour, and, moſt bounti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fully, to impart all things to vs, who had perſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cuted vs moſt. And they came to approue that, which they had miſliked before; and ſo, by little and little, they let their Suite fall. And they ſayd, that now they were come to vnderſtand, that it was the worke of Almightie God, ſince his Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uine Maieſtie had been pleaſed, that it ſhould proceed, and proſper, in deſpight of ſo great con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tradiction. Yea now, there is not a Creature, who conceaues, that it had been well done, to deſiſt from the Worke; and accordingly, they take much care, to prouide vs with Almes, euen with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out our deſiring anie thing, at anie time, of anie bodie. So that, it ſeemes, our Bleſſed Lord ſtirres them vp, to ſend it to vs, of themſelues; and ſo we paſſe without the want of anie thing, in the world, which is neceſſarie; and I hope in our Bleſſed Lord, that it ſhall, for euer, be ſo. For, being ſo few, as we are, if withall we ſhall doe our dutie, (as now his Diuine Maieſtie giues vs grace to doe,) I make my ſelf very ſure, that we ſhall want nothing; and ſo, haue no occaſion, to be troubleſome, or importunate, towards anie Creature; but that, as I was ſaying, our Lord will take care of vs heerafter, as he hath been pleaſed to doe, hitherto. And <note n="*" place="margin">Note the de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcription vvhich the Saynt makes heer of her Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligious.</note> for me, it is an exceſſiue comfort, to ſee my ſelf ſetled heer, with ſuch Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uants
<pb n="566" facs="tcp:100776:320"/>
of Almightie God, as are ſo totally vntyed, from all the perſons, and things of this world. Their conuerſation, and diſcourſe, is only, how they may be able, to proceed beſt, and faſteſt, in the Seruice of his Diuine Maieſtie. Solitude is the greateſt Solace, they can enioy; and to thinke that they ſhall ſee anie Creature, but only ſuch, as may aſſiſt them, towards the enkindling; and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flaming their harts, to the loue of their Spouſe, is the greateſt trouble they haue; yea though it ſhould be, from the neereſt kindred they know. And ſo, there comes no bodie hither, but ſuch as loue to treat of that buſines; for, neither would he content them; nor they, him. And their lan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guage being only to ſpeake of our Bleſſed Lord, as it is, they neither vnderſtand, nor be vnder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtood, vnleſſe the ſame language be ſpoken.</p>
            <p>We keepe, and obſerue the Rule of our B. Ladie of <hi>Carmel;</hi> and this, entirely, as it ought to be, without anie manner of relaxation; but iuſt as it was ordained, by <hi>Albertus,</hi> Patriarch of <hi>Ieruſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lem;</hi> and confirmed, by Pope <hi>Innocentius the Fourth,</hi> in the Fifth yeare of his Pontificate; and in the yeare of our Lord God, 1248.</p>
            <p>So as now, me thinkes, all the troubles, and vexations, which haue been endured, about this Buſines, will fall out to haue been very well em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ployed. And though the Rule be of ſome rigour (for, they neuer eate Fleſh, without neceſſitie; and they <note n="*" place="margin">This Faſt of the Or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der, is not ſo ſtrict, and rigorous, as that of the Church; but is rather a forbear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance of halfe the Meale, then a Faſt.</note> Faſt, eight moneths, in the yeare; and obſerue ſuch other things alſo, as may be ſeen in
<pb n="567" facs="tcp:100776:320"/>
the Originall Rule) yet moſt of the particulars, ſeem to be of little difficultie, to the Religious; &amp; they obſerue alſo other things, which haue ſeem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed neceſſarie to vs, for the more exact perfor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mance of the ſayd Rule. And I hope in our Bleſſed Lord, that this, which is begunne, will proceed, and proſper, according to what his Diuine Maieſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie hath told me.</p>
            <p>The other Houſe, which the <hi>Beata,</hi> of whome I ſpake before, procured to erect, is now already made, in <hi>Alcalà;</hi> and there wanted not alſo oppo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſitions, and great afflictions, and troubles, to them, who laboured in it. I know, that all Religious Obſeruance, is performed there, according to the firſt Inſtitution of this our Rule; and I beſeech our Bleſſed Lord, that all may turne to his honour, and praiſe; and of the <hi>Glorious Virgin Marie,</hi> whoſe Habit we weare; Amen.</p>
            <p>I well beleiue, that your Reuerence will haue been wearyed, with the long Relation, which I I haue made you, of this Monaſterie; which yet, in ſome reſpect, will fall-out to haue been but very ſhort; conſidering the manie afflictions, which were endured; and the great wonders, which our Bleſſed Lord wrought therein; where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of there are manie witneſſes, who can auerre them, by Oath. And now I beſeech your Reuer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence, for the loue of our Lord, that, howſoeuer you may teare what you will, of all the reſt that I haue written, your Reuerence will keepe ſafe, what I ſend you heer, concerning this Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>naſterie;
<pb n="568" facs="tcp:100776:321"/>
and that, when I ſhall be dead, you will deliuer it ouer, to the Religious heer. For, it will greatly ſerue to animate ſuch, as ſhall ſucceed in the Seruice of Almightie God; and to make them procure, not to let that fall to the ground, which is begunne; and ſo, to be ſtill paſſing further, and further, on, when they ſhall ſee, how carefully his Diuine Maieſtie bleſſed it, in the erection thereof, by meanes of ſo wicked, and baſe a Creature, as my ſelf.</p>
            <p>And ſince our Bleſſed Lord hath ſhewed, in ſo particular a manner, that he was reſolued to fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uour, both the beginning, and finiſhing of this Monaſterie, it ſeemes to me, that they ſhall doe very ill, and that they will be ſeuerely puniſhed, by Almightie God, who ſhall endeauour, at all, to ſlacken the perfection of this Rule. For heer, our Bleſſed Lord hath already begunne, ſo to aſſiſt, and ſtrengthen vs, as that this kind of Croſſe, is carried with extraordinary ſuauity, and is very well diſcerned, to be tollerable enough; and that, great preparation is alſo vſed, and prouiſion made, for euerie one of them, who ſhall deſire to enioy their Spouſe <hi>Ieſus-Chriſt,</hi> our Lord, hand to hand, by liuing chearfully, and euerlaſtingly, in the ſayd Rule. For, this is that verie thing, which they are alwaies to reſolue. They alone, with him alone; and they are to be no more, then thirteen; for I ſee, by the opinion of manie, that this is fitt; and I haue found it alſo to be true, by experience, That to preſerue that Spirit, which
<pb n="569" facs="tcp:100776:321"/>
they haue, and to liue of Almes, <note n="*" place="margin">This Point of haueing ſo very fevv, in a Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>naſtery, vvas partly meant, for them vvho vvere to liue in any place, on Almes; and partly becauſe the Saint had ſeen ſome diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>orders by haueing too many Religious in other Hovv<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes; and yet the Saint her ſelfe came aftervvard, to admit of tvventy, in ſtead of tvvelue; and vvould perhaps haue admitted more, if she had found reaſon for it.</note> without asking anie thing of anie Creature, there will not be meanes for more. And euer, let them be beleiued beſt, who, with manie troubles of their owne, and by meanes of the manie prayers of others, procured, that that might be done, which was beſt. And ſo alſo, by the conſideration of the great contentment, and ioy, and the very little care, and trouble, which we ſee euerie bodie to haue in this Houſe; as alſo by the much better health, which now they haue, then formerly they were wont to enioy, it may be held, and hoped, that this courſe will fall-out to be moſt conuenie<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>r. And, whoſoeuer ſhall ſtill conceaue, that the way of life heer, is too ſeuere, and ſharpe, let him ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther apply the fault, to his owne want of Spirit, then caſt it vpon that Diſcipline, which is obſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ued heer; ſince perſons, who are of delicate con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtitution, and haue no health, of which to brag, doe yet ſo eaſily obſerue this Rule, becauſe they haue Spirit. And let thoſe others goe, in God's name, to ſome other Monaſterie, where they alſo may be ſaued, according to the Spirit, which they ſhall haue.</p>

            </argument>
            <p>I Am loath to recount anie more of thoſe Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uours, which our Lord hath done me, then ſuch, as I haue related already; yea and euen they, are more, I doubt, then need to be thought, to haue been ſhewed, to ſo miſerable a Creature, as my ſelf; but yet, to obey our Lord, who hath commanded it, and your Reuerence alſo, who expect it, I will declare ſome things heer, to his glorie. And I humbly beſeech his Diuine Maieſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie, that it may ſerue for the profit of ſome Soule, to ſee, that our Bleſſed Lord would vouchſafe, ſo highly to fauour ſo wretched a thing, as I am; for then, what will he not doe for ſuch others, as ſhall procure to ſerue his Diuine Maieſtie, in good
<pb n="571" facs="tcp:100776:322"/>
earneſt? And euerie bodie will ſo be encouraged heerby, to giue our Lord contentment, and guſt; ſince, euen in this mortall life of ours, he vouch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſafes to impart to vs, ſuch aſſurances, and euen pawnes of his loue.</p>
            <p>But firſt, it is heer to be vnderſtood, that in all theſe Fauours, which Almightie God is pleaſed to doe to a Soule, there is euer; more glorie, or leſſe; as he himſelf is pleaſed to impart it more, or leſſe. For, the glorie, and guſt, and comfort, which he imparts, is ſo much more, in ſome Viſions, then in other, as that I was euen amazed, to find ſo great difference of enioying, euen in this life. For it happens, that there is ſo great an excellencie, belonging to ſome one Regalo, or guſt, which our Lord imparts, in ſome one Viſion, or in ſome one Rapt, that it ſeemes an impoſſible thing, to be able ſo much as to deſire anie thing, beyond it, in this life; nor doth the Soule, indeed, deſire more; nor would euen wiſh, for more ioy, and guſt; though yet, ſince our Bleſſed Lord hath been pleaſed, to giue me to vnderſtand, how great the difference is, in Heauen, between the glory, which is enioyed by ſome, &amp; that, which is enioyed by others, I am come to ſee very clear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, that euen heer alſo, there are no ſet limits in giuing, when our Lord pleaſes. And ſo could I alſo wiſh, that there were no limits ſet, in my doing Seruice to his Diuine Maieſtie, but that I would employ my whole ſtrength, and health, and life, vpon it; that ſo, I might not looſe the leaſt
<pb n="572" facs="tcp:100776:323"/>
imaginable proportion, of my enioying anie Ce<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſtiall bleſſing, through anie fault of mine. And heerin I declare my ſelf, thus farre, That, if this choice ſhould be offered me, Whether I would be ſubiect to all afflictions of the world, euen till the end of the ſame world, and then aſcend, by that meanes, to the enioying of neuer ſo little more glorie; or els, without anie affliction at all, to enioy a little leſſe glorie; I would moſt willing<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly accept of all thoſe troubles, and afflictions, for a little more enioying; that ſo I might alſo vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtand more, of the greatnes of Almightie God; becauſe I ſee, that he, who vnderſtands more of him, doth both praiſe him, and loue him, ſo much the more. I ſay not, but that I ſhould be fully contented, and ſhould eſteem my ſelf, very happie, to be in Heauen, though it were but in the moſt inferiour place thereof; for our Bleſſed Lord would ſhew an abundance of mercie there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by, to ſuch an one, as had been deſigned to Hell-Fire, as I was; and I humbly pray his Diuine Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ieſtie, that he will not caſt his eye vpon my great Sinnes, but that, in fine, I may goe to Heauen. But that, which I ſay, is this, That, if our Lord would giue me grace, to labour much for him, and if I were able, to doe it, I would not, vpon anie tear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mes (how much paine ſoeuer, it might coſt me) forgoe the gaine of anie thing, in the way of Ce<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſtiall glorie, by my fault, (miſerable Creature, that I am) who had once loſt it all, through mine owne great Sinnes.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="573" facs="tcp:100776:323"/>
But heer it is alſo to be noted, that, in euerie Fauour, or Viſion, or Reuelation, which our Lord allowed me, my Soule did ſtill remaine, with ſome great aduantage, or gaine; and ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times, with a gaine, which was very extraordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>narily great, by meanes of ſome of my Viſions. For, by my ſeing Chriſt our Lord, his admirable, and exceſſiue beautie, remained imprinted in me; and I haue it, euen to this day; for, in ſuch a caſe, as this, one onlie time ſerues the turne; and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore, how much more, when it happens ſo very often, as our Lord hath vouchſafed to impart it to me. In particular, I remained with one, which was extreamly conſiderable; and it was this. I was ſubiect to a very great fault, by which, much hurt came vpon me, whenſoeuer I beganne to obſerue, that anie one had a good inclination to me. For if I liked him well, I grew to carrie ſo much affection to him, as that my memorie, would bind me, after a ſort, to be ſtill thinking of him, though yet, it were not, at all, with anie intention to offend Almightie God; and I would alſo be very glad to ſee him, and to thinke of him, and to conſider the good parts, which I found in him; and this, was ſo preiudiciall a thing, that it did my Soule a great deale of hurt. But when once, I was come to behold the great Beau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie of our Bleſſed Lord, I ſaw no Creature after that, which might ſeeme paſſable, in compariſon of him; nor, who was able to take-vp my thought, for one minute. For, by caſting the eye of my
<pb n="574" facs="tcp:100776:324"/>
conſideration, vpon that Image, or Picture of him, which is engrauen in my Soule, I haue re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mained with ſo much Libertie of Minde, in this reſpect, that, euerie thing, which I haue ſeen, ſince that time, makes me readie, almoſt, to caſt the gorge, in compariſon of the excellencies, and ayre, and grace, which I diſcerned to abound in this Lord of mine. Nor is there anie knowledge, or comfort, which I can, at all, eſteem, in com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pariſon of that, which growes by the hearing of one ſingle word, which proceeds out of that Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uine mouth of his; and much more, when I haue heard ſo manie, and ſo often, from him. Nay, I hold it to be a kind of impoſſible thing (vnleſſe our Lord ſhould permit it, in reſpect of my Sinnes) that euer I can looſe the memorie of this bleſſing; or that anie Creature can euer ſo poſſeſſe me, as that I ſhall not inſtantly be free, by reco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uering the remembrance of this Lord.</p>
            <p>It hapned to me ſometimes, with ſome Ghoſtlie Fathers of mine, (for I alwaies loue them much, who gouerne my Soule, in regard, that I take them truly, as in the place of Almightie God himſelf; and me thinkes, it is euer there, where I employ my affection, moſt) that eſteeming my ſelf to be in ſecuritie with them, I would be apt to ſhew them extraordinary ciuilityes; whereas they, on the other ſide, (as being great Seruants of Almightie God) would be, not only carefull, but fearefull, leaſt I ſhould faſten, or tye my ſelf, too much, to them, though it ſhould be, in a moſt innocent
<pb n="575" facs="tcp:100776:324"/>
manner; and they would ſhew themſelues, euen to be diſpleaſed at it. Now, this grew in me, after I had made my ſelf ſubiect, to be be directed, and euen commanded, by them; for before, I did not beare them ſo much loue. But the while, I con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſſe, I would be laughing ſometimes, within my ſelf, to conſider, how extreamly they were de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceaued; though yet, I would not alwaies be tell<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing them, ſo clearly, how little I vſed to tye my<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf to anie Creature, as I was ſure of it, in my<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf. But yet, I gaue them certaintie enough of it; and when once they were growne to be more inward, and more confident with me, they came to know, how particularly I was obliged to our Bleſſed Lord, in that kind. But theſe ſuſpitions, which they had of me, were neuer wont to oc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>curr, but in the beginnings.</p>
            <p>Beſides, there grew to be, both more loue, and more confidence, between this Lord of mine, and me, after I had ſeen him; as one, with whome I was come, to haue a kind of continuall conuer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſation. I ſaw, that though he were God, he was alſo Man; and that he did not wonder, at our weaknes; for, he well knowes our miſerable con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dition, and compoſition, which is ſubiect to take Falls of ſo manie kindes, by that firſt Sinne of <hi>Adam,</hi> which he, was come to repaire, Nay I ſee, that, although he be my Lord, I may yet treat with him, as with a Freind; becauſe he is not ſuch a kind of Lord, as we are wont to meet with, in this world, who pinne all the Lordlyneſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes,
<pb n="576" facs="tcp:100776:325"/>
which they haue, vpon a certaine kind of changeable; and remoueable demonſtrations; and who muſt giue, but particular, and ſet dayes, for Audience; and ſo, the perſons, whome they will heare, muſt be appointed, and named. And if perhaps anie poore Creature haue a buſines, there muſt be vſe of labour, and fauour, and a walking in By-Wayes, before it can be euer negotiated, or concluded. And if perhaps they haue anie thing to doe with the King himſelf, alas poore folkes; for they, who touch not vpon the Caua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lier, or great man, muſt not ſo much as preſume to approach, but be content to aske, who the Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uorites are. And now, they will certainly, not fall out to be ſuch, as vſe to tread the world vnder their feet; becauſe ſuch perſons as theſe, are wont to ſpeake reall truths; for, they neither feare anie thing; nor owe anie thing; nor, in fine, are anie part of the Pallace. For there, theſe things are not vſed; but to diſſemble, whatſoeuer they diſlike; nay, they ſcarce dare ſo much as thinke, for feare, leaſt they ſhould grow by it, into leſſe fauour.</p>
            <p>O King of Glorie, and Lord of all the Kings of this world! how true is it, that thy Kingdome is not guarded by Sticks, and ſtrawes, ſince, in it ſelf, it hath no end? How true is it, that there is no need of third perſons, to introduce vs, to Audi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence with thee? For, by our verie ſeing thy ſelfe, we inſtantly ſee withall, that thou, only, doſt indeed deſerue, to be called Lord; So great is the Maieſtie, which thou ſheweſt. Nor is there heer
<pb n="577" facs="tcp:100776:325"/>
anie need at all, of Aſſembles, and Guards, in Court, whereby thou maiſt be knowne to be King. Whereas, if anie Earthlie King were left alone, he would hardly be knowne to be King; and how much ſoeuer himſelf might deſire it, yet the people would haue difficultie to beleiue it. For, in himſelf, he is no more, then others are; and therefore, we muſt either ſee him ſo adorned, and attended, firſt, or els, we ſhall hardly belieiue afterward, that he is the King. And he hath there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore, ſo much more reaſon, to ſerue himſelf of theſe externall aduantages, and helps; for els, they would not hold him in account; becauſe his ſeem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to be ſo powerfull, depends not vpon the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward, and innate dignitie of his Perſon; but his State is deriued to him, from others. But, O, thou, my Lord, and my King, that I were able now, to repreſent that Maieſtie, which thou haſt? For, it is impoſſible to forbeare to ſee, that thou art the great Emperour of the whole world, in thy ſelf; and that thy Maiſtie doth euen aſtoniſh the beholders. But yet, it puts me to more amaze<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, O my Lord, to ſee, in companie thereof, the great humilitie, and loue, which thou beareſt to ſuch a wretched Creature, as my ſelf. For, we may euer ſpeake, and treat with thee, about all things, euen as we will our ſelues, when once we ſhall haue loſt that firſt amazement, and feare, to ſee the Maieſtie of thy Preſence; though yet then, we ſhall haue more feare to offend thee, then to ſee thee; yea and yet, euen that, not ſo much for
<pb n="578" facs="tcp:100776:326"/>
being, O Lord, afrayd of thy puniſhment, (for, we doe not eſteem that, at all) as in reſpect of the miſerie, which it is, to looſe thy verie ſelf.</p>
            <p>Behold heer, the benefits of this Viſion; beſides manie other great ones, which it leaues in the Soule. And if it be of Almightie God, it makes it ſelf be vnderſtood, by the effects, whenſoeuer the Soule hath Light; for, manie times, as I haue ſayd, our Lord is pleaſed, that it ſhould remaine in darknes, and not ſee this Light; and therefore, it is not ſo ſtrange a buſines, which ſo wicked a Creature as my ſelf, may come to ſee.</p>
            <p>On the other ſide, it is but euen now, that it hath hapned to me, to be eight dayes, in ſuch a caſe, as that I ſeemed, neither to haue knowledge of what I owe to Almightie God, not yet, anie memorie of his Fauours; but only, that my Soule was euen halfe beſotted, and eſtranged, and em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ployed vpon I know not what, nor how. Not yet, vpon anie ill thoughts; but I was ſo very vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>toward, in reſpect of good ones, that I did euen, as it were, laugh at my ſelf; and tooke a kind of guſt, to ſee the great baſenes of a Soule, when<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſoeuer our Lord vouchſafes not to be working, in it. But ſhe yet vnderſtands very well, that ſhe is not without poſſeſſing him, euen in this State; for it is not (as I haue formerly ſayd) as it vſes to be, in our great afflictions; but, though we bring wood thither, and doe alſo, all that verie little, which we are able to doe on our part, there is yet, no ſuch thing, in the world, as the kindling,

at that time, of anie fire, of the loue of our Lord, in our harts. And it is no ſmall mercie of his, that we can ſo much as find, that there is anie ſmoake; for, at leaſt, we know thereby, that ſhe is not dead; and our Lord returnes to kindle it againe, afterward. But then, this Soule of ours (though we breake our verie heads in blowing, and wearie our ſelues alſo otherwiſe, in ordering, and com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſing the wood) ſeemes to be in ſuch a condi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, as that euerie thing ſerues, to choake vs, the more. And ſo, I thinke, the beſt of our caſe to be then, to render our ſelues wholy vp; and to know, that we are able to doe nothing of our ſelues; and then to apply our endeauours, to the doing of ſome externall, meritorious things. Yea and per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>haps our Bleſſed Lord is pleaſed, to take Prayer from vs, at that time; to the end, that the Soule may exerciſe her ſelf in thoſe other actions, and ſo vnderſtand, at length, by good experience, how little ſhe was able to doe, of her ſelf.</p>
            <p>But now I haue, this verie day, regaled my Soule, with our Lord; and preſumed to complaine to his Diuine Maieſtie, euen againſt himſelf, to this effect: How comes it to paſſe, O my God, that it ſeemes not enough for thee, to keep me in this miſerable life; and that I reſolue, to endure it all, for thy ſake; and that I content my ſelf to be, where all is vexation, and trouble; and that I may not ſo much as enioy, euen thee; but that I muſt alſo eat, and ſleepe, and diſpatch buſineſſe, and treat with euerie Creature, according to the oc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>caſion,
<pb n="580" facs="tcp:100776:327"/>
and that I ſuffer all this, for the loue of thee? And now, O my Lord, thou knoweſt, that this is an extreame torment, to my hart; and that yet, in thoſe few little moments of time, which remaine to me, for the enioying thee, thou yet art pleaſed to hide thy ſelf, after this manner, from me. And how can this be compatible with thy mercie? and how can the loue, thou beareſt me, permit it? I beleiue, O my deare Lord, that, if it were a poſſible thing for me, to hide my ſelf from thee, as thou doſt thy ſelf from me, I thinke, I ſay, and I beleiue ſo much, of the loue thou bear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eſt me, as that thou wouldſt not endure it at my hands. But thou art ſtill with me; and euer ſeeſt in what caſe I am. Yet permit not longer, O my Lord, that this kind of courſe be held, but I humbly beſeech thee to conſider, that it is a kind of wrong, to proceed after this manner, with one who loues thee ſo much. This, and the like, hath occurred to me, to ſay; though yet I conſidered firſt, how that place, which had been prouided for me, in Hell, was appointed me, after a kind of fauourable way, in compariſon of what I had deſerued. But yet ſometimes, the loue I beare to our Bleſſed Lord, is ſo very extrauagant, that I ſcarce can tell, what I doe; and then, with all the little vnderſtanding I haue, I make ſuch co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>plaints, as theſe; and our Lord endures them all, at my hands; and therefore, let ſo good a King, as this, be euer praiſed. But now, might we, perhaps, be able, to approach anie King of this world, with
<pb n="581" facs="tcp:100776:327"/>
ſuch audacities, as theſe?</p>
            <p>And yet I wonder not much, that we may not preſume, to talke, after this manner, to our Earth<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly Kings, whome we haue ſo much reaſon to feare; yea or euen to ſuch great Lords, as are the ſuperiour parts of the State. For, <note n="*" place="margin">She inueighs vvith much reaſon, against vaine Comple<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments, and eſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cially amongst Religious people.</note> now we find the world ſo changed, that our verie liues ſhould be longer, then now they are; to the end, that we might haue time enough, to learne the Punto's, and new cuſtomes, and faſhions, of good Man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ners of the world, if there be anie meaning with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>all, that we ſhould alſo, haue anie time to ſpend, in the Seruice of Almightie God. For my part, I euen bleſſe my ſelf, to ſee what happens; for, the truth is, that euen already, I ſcarce knew, how to liue in the world, when I came to this place. For, now it paſſes, I can aſſure you, for no ieaſt, when<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſoeuer there is any little omiſſion, to treat men, euen with much more Stile, and ceremonie, then they deſerue; but they doe really ſo take it, for an affront, that you muſt, forſooth, interpret your intention, and profeſſe your deſire, to make ſatis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>faction, if there be (as I was ſaying) anie omiſſion; yea and I pray God, that they will vouchſafe to beleiue you. But, in the meane time, I returne to affirme, that really, I did not know how to liue; ſo miſerably doe theſe things afflict a poore ouer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>laboured Soule. For ſhe ſees, that, on the one ſide, they command her to employ her whole thought, vpon God; and that it is neceſſarie for her, to doe ſo; to the end, that ſhe may be deliuered from
<pb n="582" facs="tcp:100776:328"/>
manie dangers; and, on the other ſide, ſhe alſo finds, that it concernes her, not to looſe a <hi>Punto,</hi> euen in the <hi>Puntilio's</hi> of this world, vpon the price, of not chanceing to miniſter occaſion, of giuing temptation, and trouble, to them, who place their Honour, in theſe <hi>Punto's.</hi> For, as for me, they tired me, euen outright; and I could neuer be at an end, of making ſatisfactions; for, it was neuer in my power (how much ſoeuer I endea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uoured it) to forbeare the making manie faults, in this kind; which, as I ſayd, are not held, to be little, in the account of the world. And it is true, that, in Religious Orders, (which, in all reaſon, ſhould be excuſed, and diſcharged, in ſuch kinds, as theſe) there is really a very true diſcharge. Not yet that they affirme, that our Monaſteries ought to be a kind of Court, for good breeding, and to know, what belongs to good Manners, (for I confeſſe, I vnderſtand not this kind of language) but becauſe I haue been thinking, that our Saints had antiently affirmed, and taught, that a Monaſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terie ſhould be a kind of Court, to inſtruct ſuch perſons, as had a minde, to make themſelues Courtiers, in the Kingdome of Heauen. But now, things are vnderſtood in the direct contrarie way; becauſe they, who ſhould be continually em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ployed, in pleaſing Almightie God, and in pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>curing to abhorre the world, muſt now, forſooth, be obliged to all attention, and care (in ſtead of pleaſing God) to pleaſe ſuch, as liue in the world; yea and that, in certaine things, which are euerie
<pb n="583" facs="tcp:100776:328"/>
day ſo ſubiect to change, that I know not, how our performances could paſſe vn-reproued; yea though it were poſſible, that all might be learned, in one Leſſon, without anie loſſe at all, of more time.</p>
            <p>Yea, and euen for the Titles, which are expect<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, vpon the Superſcription of Letters, it were now, it ſeemes, not to be vnfitt, that there were ſome Doctours-Chaire erected (as one may ſay) where they might inſtruct, and teach, how ſuch, and ſuch Titles, were to be vſed. For ſometimes, men leaue the Paper emptie, on one ſide of the page of the Letter, and ſometimes on the other. And now he, who was not wont, to be <hi>VVorship<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full,</hi> muſt be called <hi>Honourable;</hi> and I know not, in fine, where things will reſt. For, I am not yet fiftie yeares old, and yet I haue ſeen ſuch changes in my time, that I cannot tell now, how to liue. But then, how will they, who are now borne, know, how to carrie themſelues, if they chance to liue long?</p>
            <p>I haue really great compaſſion of Spirituall perſons, who are obliged to liue in the world, for certaine holie ends; for, I hold it to be a kind of terrible Croſſe, which they are faine to carrie, euen in this reſpect. If they could all come to a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gree in a tale, and profeſſe themſelues to be igno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rant, and be content to be held for ſuch, in this kind of art, or ſcience, they might free them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelues, from a great deale of trouble.</p>
            <p>But now, into what kind of fooleties, haue I
<pb n="584" facs="tcp:100776:329"/>
caſt my ſelf? For, by treating of the greatneſſes of Almightie God, I am growne, by degrees, to ſpeake of the baſeneſſes of the world. And ſince our Lord hath done me the Fauour, to make me able to leaue it, I am reſolued to goe out of it, now at length. Let them fitt themſelues to it, as they liſt, who ſuſtaine, and hold-vp theſe toyes, with ſo much trouble to themſelues; and I pray God, that we may not pay dearly for them, in the other world, where there is no change to be found,</p>

            </argument>
            <p>BEing ſo very ill at eaſe, one night, that I thought fitt to excuſe my ſelf from Prayer, I tooke a Paire of Beades, or Roſarie, into my hand, to employ my ſelf Vocally, by that meanes. And I procured not to recollect my Vnderſtand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, in anie very ſerious manner; though yet, for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>asmuch
<pb n="585" facs="tcp:100776:329"/>
as concerned my exteriour, I was ſuffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciently recollected, and in my Oratorie. But when our Bleſſed Lord hath a minde to anie thing, theſe diligences of ours, to the contrarie, are not wont to ſerue to anie great purpoſe. For, I remaining a while, after this manner, there came a Rapt of Spirit vpon me, with ſuch an exceſſiue impulſe, or impetuoſitie, that there was no power in me, to reſiſt it. It ſeemed to me, that I was car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ried vp, and placed in Heauen; yea, and the firſt perſons, whome I ſaw there, were my Father, and my Mother; and I alſo ſaw ſome things beſides, ſo very great, and all, in ſo very ſhort a ſpace of time, as wherein an <hi>Aue Maria</hi> might be ſayd, that I was amazed; as conceauing, that it was too very great a Fauour for me. In this circumſtance, of the times haueing been ſo ſhort, I may per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>haps be deceaued; for it may haue been a little longer; but at leaſt, it ranne ſpeedily away, and ſeemed ſhort enough. For my part, I was in ſome feare of an Illuſion; but yet, ſuppoſing that it ſhould proue none, I found my ſelf in an extreame deale of ſhame, with conſidering, how I could euer be able to declare anie ſuch thing, as that, to my Ghoſtlie Father. Not yet, in my opinion, that I was to receaue trouble by it, in reſpect of anie ſuch thing, as Humilitie, in me, but becauſe I thought it likelie enough, that he would make ſome ieaſt at it, and ſay: Lord, what a kind of <hi>S. Paul,</hi> or <hi>S. Ierome,</hi> is this woeman growne, that ſhe, forſooth, muſt ſee things of Heauen! yea and
<pb n="586" facs="tcp:100776:330"/>
beſides, in regard, that theſe Glorious Saints, had participated, and been admitted to ſuch things, as theſe, I grew to be in ſo much the more feare of my ſelf; and really, I did nothing but weepe bitterly, in regard, that, in my opinion, there was no apparance of reaſon at all, that theſe things were to paſſe, after this manner.</p>
            <p>But yet howſoeuer, in fine I reſolued, that I would goe to my Ghoſtlie Father, notwithſtand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing all the auerſion, which I had; and that I would acquaint him with all things; for I neuer durſt conceale anie thing, from him, through the very great feare, wherein I was, of being abuſed, and deceiued. Yet when he found me to be ſo greatly afflicted, he did procure to comfort me much; and told me of manie good things, to free me from the paine, wherein I was.</p>
            <p>But afterward, that which followes, hapned to me; and the ſame occurrs to me often. For, our Lord went ſhewing me yet, greater Secrets; I ſay, he went ſhewing them to me; for, that a Soule ſhould euer be able to ſee anie one iott more, then is repreſented to her by our Lord, is abſolut<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly an impoſſible thing; and for my part, I neuer ſaw more, then meerly, what he was pleaſed to ſhew me, at euerie ſeuerall time. But that, was ſo very much, that the leaſt part thereof, ſufficed, to make me remaine all amazed, and my Soule to be very much improued, towards the vndervalue, and diſ-eſteem of whatſoeuer thing might be in this world.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="587" facs="tcp:100776:330"/>
I would be extreamly glad, if I could tell, how to giue ſome little part of the leaſt of that, which I knew, to be vnderſtood; but I find, that it is wholy impoſſible. For, though this Light, which we ſee heer, and that Light, which is repreſented there, be, all of it, Light: yet ſtill, there is ſo great a difference withall, as that there is no manner of compariſon. For, the claritie, and brightnes, euen of the verie Sunne it ſelf, is a thing of meane, and poore apparance, in reſpect of this. In fine, the verie Imagination of man, how ſubtile, and refined ſoeuer it may be, is yet vnable to reach to the deſcribing anie thing of this Light; nor yet of anie other thing at all, which our Lord was pleaſed to giue me to vnderſtand; and that with ſuch a ſoueraigne kind of delight, as cannot poſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſibly be declared. For, all our Senſes enioy ſuch a ſuperiour degree of ſweetnes, that it can no way be fully expreſſed; and therefore I thinke it will be beſt, to ſay no more.</p>
            <p>I had once been aboue an hower, in this con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dition, when our Lord ſhewed me admirable things; and ſeeming not to depart, from being neer me, he ſpake theſe verie words to me: <hi>See heer, my Daughter, vvhat they looſe, vvho are againſt me; &amp; doe not thou forbeare, to let them knovv it.</hi> But, O my deare Lord; what good will my ſaying it, doe to them, whome their owne actions blind ſo deeply, if thy Diuine Maieſtie doe not giue them light? Some there be, to whome thou haſt giuen it; and they haue profited much, by know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
<pb n="588" facs="tcp:100776:331"/>
thoſe greatneſſes of thine; but yet, O my Lord, they ſee, in ſuch ſort, withall, that they are ſhew<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed to ſuch a wretched, and miſerable thing, as my ſelf, that I cannot but eſteem it a ſtrange thing, to find, that anie Creature ſhould beleiue me. Bleſſed be thy name, and thy mercie; for, at leaſt, I haue plainly ſeen an euident amendment, in mine owne Soule; and I would be glad, if I might ſtill remaine there, and not come back to liue heer, anie more. For, the contempt, wherein I held this whole world, was very great; and it ſeemed to be no better, then euen dung, to me; and now I find, how baſely we be employed, who are detained therein.</p>
            <p>Whilſt I remained with that Ladie, of whome I ſpoke before, it hapned to me once, when I was ill, and euen ſick at the hart, (for I haue for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>merly been ſubiect to this miſerie, though no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing ſo much of late) ſhe conſidering me with much charitie, and compaſſion, commanded, that one day, certaine Iewells of hers, ſhould be brought forth, which ſhe had, of very great value; and one, in particular, of Diamonds, which was prized at a verie high rate. Now she conceaued belike, that this would recreate, and reviue me; but I ſmiled inwardly at her, the while; and had compaſſion to ſee, how meane things men eſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teem, when I conſidered, what our Lord hath layd-vp for vs; And I thought, how impoſſible a thing it would be, for me, to put anie manner of value, vpon ſuch toyes, as thoſe, euen though I
<pb n="589" facs="tcp:100776:331"/>
should endeauour it, vnleſſe our Lord ſhould firſt depriue me of the memorie of thoſe other trea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſures.</p>
            <p>But now, this kind of Fauour, giues ſo great a dominion to the Soule, that I know not, whether it can poſſibly be vnderſtood, but only by ſuch perſons, as poſſeſſe it. For it is the proper, true, and naturall diſcharge, and vntying of the Soule, from all things created; and this growes abſolut<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, without anie labour of our owne; and Almigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie God doth it all; and then, his Diuine Maieſtie ſhewes theſe Truths; and that ſo, as to make them remaine imprinted, and engrauen, in the Soule; and they ſerue alſo, to make vs ſee clearly, that it was not poſſible for vs, to acquire them, eſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pecially in ſo ſhort a time, by anie diligences of our owne.</p>
            <p>Vpon this, I alſo came, to haue very little feare of death, which formerly, had been great in me; but now it is growne, to ſeem to be a thing of very much facilitie, and eaſe, for ſuch as apply themſelues to the Seruice of Almightie God. For, by death, the Soule flyes out of priſon, in one moment; and is not only put preſently into liber<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie, but enioyes an euerlaſting reſt, and glory.</p>
            <p>Now, this way, which is held by Almightie God, in carrying the Spirit vp, to ſhew her ſo ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cellent things, in theſe Rapts, ſeemes to beare a very cloſe kind of conformitie, with the paſſage of a Soule, out of a Bodie, at the hower of death; ſince it growes, euen at one inſtant, to be ſo en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tirely
<pb n="590" facs="tcp:100776:332"/>
inpoſſeſſion of this Eternall Good. But heer, I lay aſide, the conſideration of thoſe ſorrowes, and paines, which are felt, when the Soule is torne out of the Bodie; for, we are to make little account of that, and they alſo, who loue God, in good earneſt, and haue ſhaken hands with all the contentments of this life, are certainly wont to dye, with more ſweetnes.</p>
            <p>It alſo ſeemes to me, that theſe Fauours did me very much good, towards the bringing me into a knowledge of our true Countrie; and to ſee, that we were meer Pilgrims heer; and it is a pretious kind of thing, to find what paſſes there aboue; and to vnderſtand, where, in fine, we are to liue, for euer. And whenſoeuer one goes to ſettle, and ſtay, for good and all, in anie Countrie, it giues a great aſſiſtance, towards the enduring all the incommodities of the iourney, when we know, that the end of it, is to be ſuch, as that we may, in fine, be in great repoſe, and happines, when we get thither. It is alſo heer obtained, that, with caſe, we may grow able to conſider Heauenlie things, that ſo our conuerſation may be there. And this is a great kind of gaine, ſince the onlie thinking of Heauen, recollects the Soule; in re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gard that our Lord being pleaſed to ſhew vs ſomewhat, which paſſes there, we are induced to pawſe, and thinke vpon it. And ſometimes it ſo falls out, that they whome I know to liue there, are the Soules, who accompanie me, and in whome I receaue moſt comfort; and theſe indeed
<pb n="591" facs="tcp:100776:332"/>
are they, who ſeem to be truely aliue; and thoſe others, on the other ſide, who liue heer, ſeem to be ſo very deadly dead, as that this whole world, put togeather, cannot amount to be anie compa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nie at all, for me. And eſpecially, when I find anie of theſe impulſes, or impetuoſities, in my ſelf, the whole world ſeemes to be, but a verie Dreame; and all the obiects, of theſe corporeall eyes of mine, a meer ieaſt, and toy; but that, which alrea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy I haue ſeen, with the eyes of my Soule, that, I ſay, is the thing, which ſhe deſires; and becauſe ſhe finds her ſelf, to be yet farre off from thence, this is that, which is no leſſe, then euen death it ſelf, to my Soule.</p>
            <p>In fine, the Fauour is exceſſiuely great, which our Lord vouchſafes to that Soule, to whome he giues ſuch Viſions, as theſe; for, they helpe her much, in all things, and particularly, to the car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rying of a certaine heauie Croſſe, which lyes vpon her. For, nothing can ſatisfye her now; but euerie thing diſguſts, and checks her. And if our Bleſſed Lord did not giue way, that we might forget it ſometimes, (though yet we remember it againe afterward) I know not how we ſhould be able to liue. Let him be Bleſſed, and praiſed, for all Eternitie; and I humbly begg of his Diuine Maieſtie, euen by that very pretious Bloud, which his owne Sonne shed for me, that, ſince he hath vouchſafed, that I should vnderſtand ſomewhat of theſe benefits, and bleſſings, and that I should beginne to enioy them alſo, in ſome kind, euen
<pb n="592" facs="tcp:100776:333"/>
in this life, it may not happen to me, as it did to <hi>Lucifer,</hi> who loſt all, by his owne fault. Doe not permit this, O my Lord, I humbly pray thee, euen by all that, which thou art; for, it is no ſmall feare, which I haue ſometimes; though yet at other times, yea and vſually, the mercie of Almightie God, giues me a very confident hope, that, ſince he hath been pleaſed, to draw me out of ſo manie Sinnes, he will not forſake me ſo now, as to let me be loſt. And this doe I humbly pray your Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uerence, that you will euer deſire, in my behalfe. But, in the meane time, me thinkes, that thoſe precedent Fauours, were not ſo very great, as this, which I will now apply my ſelf to relate; and that, for manie reaſons, &amp; manie bleſſings alſo; and, in particular, for that great courage, &amp; ſtre<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>gth, which haue ſtill remained in me, vpon that account. And therefore, if thoſe former may be conſidered, euerie one by it ſelf, this other, which I am going to relate, will be found to be ſo very great, as that there will be no compariſon at all, between them.</p>
            <p>I was one day, and the ſame fell out to be vpon the Vigil of <hi>Pentecoſt,</hi> or <hi>VVhitſontide,</hi> after Maſſe; and I went to a more remote place, where I often vſed to pray; and I beganne to read in a certaine Booke of this Feaſt, which had been written by a <hi>Carthuſian.</hi> And meeting there, with thoſe ſignes, which both Beginners, and Proficients, and Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect Soules, vſe to haue; and how they may come to vnderſtand, whether the Holie-Ghoſt doe in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>habit their harts, or no; as ſoone as I had read
<pb n="593" facs="tcp:100776:333"/>
theſe three States, it ſeemed to me, that Almigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie God, through his goodnes, did not leaue, or faile, to be preſent with me, after a particular manner, for as much as I might be able to vnder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtand. And whilſt I was praiſing his Diuine Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ieſtie, for that bleſſing, I remembred, that I had read the ſame thing formerly, when I wanted very much of that condition of minde; and then I ſaw, that I wanted it, as plainly, as now I vnder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtand the direct contrarie, concerning my ſelf. But thus I came to know the great Fauour, which our Bleſſed Lord had done me; and from thence, I grew alſo to conſider the Place, which my Soule had deſerued, in Hell, for my Sinnes; and I gaue great praiſe to Almightie God, in regard that now, me thought, my Soule was ſo extreamly changed, that I could hardly almoſt conceaue it, to be the verie ſelf-ſame thing, which it had been before.</p>
            <p>Being then, in this conſideration, there came a great impulſe, or impetuoſitie vpon me, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out my being able, to vnderſtand the occaſion thereof. Me thought my verie Soule had a minde, to get inſtantly, out of my Bodie; for now ſhe could not poſſibly containe her ſelf any longer; nor found ſhe her ſelf, at that time, to be able to ſtay anie longer heer, in the painefull expectation of ſo great a Good. Now, this was ſo exceſſiue an impulſe, or impetuoſitie, that I could not poſſibly tell, euen what to doe, with my ſelf; nor ſo much, as what I ayled; ſo extreamly was I growne, to be
<pb n="594" facs="tcp:100776:334"/>
in diſorder. And though I were ſitting then, yet was I not able, euen to ſitt; and ſo I applyed my ſelf a little, to leane; for I found, that all my natu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rall forces, began to faile me. But perceauing my ſelf to be in this caſe, I ſaw a Doue, vpon mine owne head; but ſuch a Doue, as was very different from them of this world; for ſhe had not of our kind of feathers; but the wings were, as of cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taine little ſhells, which darred a huge ſplendour from themſelues. This Doue was much greater, then any ordinarie Doue; and me thought, I heard a noiſe, which ſhe made with her wings; for, ſhe was fluttering, about the ſpace of an <hi>Aut Maria.</hi> But my Soule was already, in ſuch condition, that growing to looſe her ſelf, ſhe alſo loſt the ſight of the Doue. My Spirit did then beginne to quiet it ſelf, vpon the entertaining of ſuch a Gueſt, as ſhe had gotten; though yet, for my part, I ima<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gined, that ſo wondrous an encounter, and acci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent, as that was, might well haue diſquieted, and frighted it. But she beginning already to enioy, layd quickly all feare aſide; and, togeather with the ſelf ſame ioy, grew to haue quietnes withall, but yet ſtill, remaining in the Rapt. Now, the glorie of this Rapt, was extreamly great; and I remained, during the moſt part of the whole Feſtiuitie of Pentecoſt, ſo ſtunned, and euen, as it were, beſorted, and befooled, that I knew not, what to dot with my ſelf; nor was I able, by anie meanes, to vnderſtand, how ſo high, and great a Fauour, as this was, could poſſibly find a reſting
<pb n="595" facs="tcp:100776:334"/>
place, in me. I neither heard, nor ſaw, in effect; by reaſon of the great exceſſe of my interiour ioy I vnderſtood, how, from that day forward, my Soule remained with a very great encreaſe of improuement, by enioying a more ſublime loue of Almightie God; and that my vertues alſo, had gained a great encreaſe of ſtrength. Now, let him be bleſſed, and praiſed, for all eternities, Amen.</p>
            <p>I ſaw alſo, at another time, the ſame Doue, vp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on the head of a certaine Father, of <hi>S. Dominick's Order;</hi> ſaue that, me thought, both the beames, and the brightnes of the verie wings, did ſpread, and extend themſelues, much further; and it was giuen me then, to vnderſtand, that he was to winne Soules to God.</p>
            <p>Another time, I ſaw our Bleſſed Ladie, putting a white long Garment, vpon the back of a cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taine <hi>Graduate,</hi> of the ſame Order; of whome I haue ſpoken formerly, diuerſe times; and she told me, that she had giuen him that Mantle, for hauing aſſiſted in the Buſines of this Houſe; and that his Soule should be defended, and preſerued, for the future, in ſuch puritie, as that he should not fall into Mortall Sinne. And I aſſure my ſelf, it proued ſo; for he dyed, within few yeares, after; yea and he did both line, and dye, with ſo great Per nance, and ſanctitie, that there can be no doubt thereof, for anie thing, that we are able to vnderſtand. And a certaine Religious man, who had been at his death, told me, that <hi>S. Thomas of Aquin,</hi> had been with him; and that he dyed,
<pb n="596" facs="tcp:100776:335"/>
both with great ioy, and with deſire alſo, to be deliuered from this bannishment, wherein he was. Since that time he hath appeared to me, in very much glorie; and told me, diuerſe things. He was a man of ſo great Prayer, that when a little before he dyed, he would gladly haue forborne the exerciſe thereof, through his great weaknes, he was not able to doe it; for euen then, he had manie Rapts. He wrote to me, a little before he dyed, about what courſe I thought he were beſt to take, for helpe, becauſe euer, as ſoone as he had done Maſſe, he vſed to fall into Rapts, which would laſt long, without his being able to for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>beare them. But our Lord gaue him, at length, the reward, of the great Seruice, he had done him, during his whole life.</p>
            <p>Of the Rectour <hi>of the Societie of</hi> IESVS, whome I mentioned before, I haue ſeen ſome things, con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerning great Fauours, which our Lord did him; but I will not inſert them heer, for feare of being too long. There hapned a great trouble to him once; for he was perſecuted, and found himſelf greatly afflicted; and I hearing Maſſe, one day, ſaw Chriſt our Lord, vpon the Croſſe, iuſt then, when the Preiſt eleuated the Sacred Hoaſt; and he ſpoke certaine words to me, wherewith I was to acquaint him, for his comfort; and others alſo he ſpoke, by way of preuention of ſome future in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>conuenience, which might ariue; and he repre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſented alſo to him, how much himſelf had ſuffer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed for his ſake; and that therefore, he should pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pare
<pb n="597" facs="tcp:100776:335"/>
himſelf to ſuffer. And this gaue him both much comfort, and much courage; and all hapned to him, iuſt ſo, as our Bleſſed Lord had foretold.</p>
            <p>Of the Religious of a certaine Order, yea and of that whole Order togeather, I haue ſeen great things. For I haue ſeen them ſometimes in Heauen, with white Banners in their hands; &amp; I haue ſeen, as I was ſaying, other things of great admiration. And accordingly, I haue this Order, in much ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neration; for I haue treated, and communicated with them much; and I ſee, that their life is agre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able to that, which our Bleſſed Lord hath giuen me to vnderſtand, concerning them.</p>
            <p>I being one night in Prayer, our Lord beganne to vtter ſome words to me, which brought me to remember, how wicked, my life had been; and they gaue me confuſion, and paine enough; for although they imported not anie rigour, yet they endued me with ſuch a tender kind of feeling, and greif, that the Soule was euen diſſolued by it. And we vſe, in ſuch caſes, to find more bene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fit, in the way of knowing out ſelues, by ſome one ſuch word as theſe, then we are able to ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quire, in manie dayes, by our owne conſideration of our miſerie; for, it brings ſuch a truth to be eue<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> ingraue<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> in our Soule, as we cannot poſſibly denye. He repreſented to me alſo, thoſe inclinations of mine, which I had formerly entertained, towards Creatures, with ſo much vanitie; and told me, that I was to put a great value vpon the deſire, which he had, that I would lodge all my affectio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>,
<pb n="598" facs="tcp:100776:336"/>
vpon him, which formerly I had employed ſo ill, ſince he would accept thereof. At other times, he bad me remember, that formerly, I had ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times eſteemed it for a point of honour in me, to goe againſt his Honour; And yet, at other times, that I ſhould remember, how much I owed him; for that I vſed to commit the greateſt offences againſt him, whilſt he vſed to be doing me Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uours. If I haue anie faults (which are not few) our Lord giues them ſo, to be vnderſtood by me, at thoſe times, that it makes me euen, as it were, annihilate my ſelf; and becauſe I haue manie faults, he vſes me ſo, manie times. It hapned to me once, that a Ghoſtile Father reprehended me; and when I thought to comfort my ſelf in Prayer, it was there, that I found indeed, my true repre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>henſion.</p>
            <p>But now, (to returne to that, which I was ſay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing) when our Lord beganne, to bring my wick<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed life to my remembrance, which coſt me a world of teares; and when I alſo conſidered, that I had done no good thing lately, which might euen, in my opinion, deſerue his Fauour. I be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ganne to conſider a while, whether he might not, perhaps, intend ſome new expreſſion of goodnes, to me; becauſe, whenſoeuer I find my ſelf receaue anie particular Fauour from our Lord, it is, ordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>narily, after I haue euen defeated, and annihilated my ſelf. And I conceaue, that our Lord proceeds thus with me, to the end, that I may ſee the more clearly, how farre I am out of the way, of deſerue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing his Fauours.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="599" facs="tcp:100776:336"/>
Shortly after this, my Spirit was ſo abſorpt, and ſnatcht away, that, in effect, it ſeemed to be abſolutly out of my Bodie; at leaſt, it was not vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtood, that it liued in it. And then I ſaw the moſt Sacred Humanitie of our Bleſſed Lord, in much more exceſſiue glorie, then euer I had diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerned before. Now this was repreſented to me, by a certaine admirable, and cleare notice, of his being placed in the verie boſome of his Father. Nor yet doe I know what to ſay, of how this was; for it ſeemed to me, that I ſaw my ſelf pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent, before that verie Diuinitie, and yet, without ſeing my ſelf; and I remained ſo amazed, and euerie way, indeed, in ſuch ſort; that I thinke there paſſed ſome dayes, before I was able to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turne to my ſelf. For, ſtill I was conceauing, that I had the Maieſtie of the Sonne of God, preſent with me, though it were not yet, like the former; for, this I vnderſtood well enough. But how ſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>euer, it remained ſo engrauen in my Imagination, that I cannot be ridd of it, how ſhort ſoeuer the time were, wherein it was repreſented to me; and this is matter, both of great comfort, and of great benefit to my Soule.</p>
            <p>Now, I haue ſeen this verie Viſion, at three other times; and this, in my opinion, is abſolutly, the moſt ſublime Viſion, which euer our Bleſſed Lord gaue me; and it brings the greateſt improue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, and profit, with it. For it ſeemes, that the Soule is greatly purifyed by it; and that it doth vt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terly take away all ſtrength, from the ſenſualitie of
<pb n="600" facs="tcp:100776:337"/>
our Self-Loue. It is a vehement flame, which ſeems to burne vp, and euen annihilate, all the deſires of this life. And ſince (God be bleſſed for it) I had already no inclination, to idle, and imperti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nent things, it was heer declared to me, in diſtinct manner, that all was vanitie; and in particular, how vaine, all the Superiorities, and Signories of this world be. And it falls out alſo, to be of migh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie inſtruction, for the raiſing-vp of our deſires, to be lodged vpon the puritie of Truth; and there remaines a high kind of adoration, and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uerence of God, imprinted after a certaine man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner, which I know not how to deſcribe; but it is of a very different kind, from whatſoeuer we can acquire, in this world. It creates alſo, a huge amazement in the Soule, to conſider, how ſhe euer durſt, or how anie creature can preſume ſo farre, as to thinke of offending ſuch a Supreame Maieſtie of Almighty God.</p>
            <p>I haue declared ſometimes heertofore, the ef<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fects of Viſions, and ſuch other things; but I haue alſo ſayd already, that a Soule receaues more, or leſſe profit, according to the proportion, and manner of the Viſion, as the ſame may be, either more, or leſſe. But in this, it was extraordinarily great, when I came to receaue the Bleſſed Sacra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment; and I did then, record to my ſelf, that in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>comparable Maieſtie, which I had ſeen, and vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtood, to be the verie ſame, which is in this moſt Holie Sacrament. And, manie times, our Lord is pleaſed to let me ſee him, in the Sacred
<pb n="601" facs="tcp:100776:337"/>
Hoaſt, where vpon the verie haire of my head would ſtand on end; and, me, thought. I was euen annihilated, outtight. O my deare Lord and if thou didſt not ouerſhadow, and euen hide thy greatnes, who would euer preſume to ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proach ſo often, as we doe, towards the ioyning of ſuch wretched, and filthie things, as we are, to ſo high a Maieſtie, as thine. But Bleſſed be thou for euer, my deare Lord; and let the Angells, vea and all Creatures, praiſe, and glorifye thy holie name, who doſt ſo meaſure, and weigh things out, to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>geather with our great weaknes, as that we may be able to enioy thoſe Soueraigne Fauours of thine, without being frighted, by thy infinit power; though yet we be ſo miſerable, and vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>worthie Creatures.</p>
            <p>Me thinkes, it might happen to vs heer, as once it did to another; and this I know to be true. A certaine Labouring-man found a treaſure; and the ſame falling out to be greater, then could get roome in his ſtraight, and narrow-hart, he come<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to haue this treaſure in his power, grew with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>all, to haue ſuch a melancholie in his minde, that he came, by little and little, to dye, by the verie care, and affliction of his thoughts, for not know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, what he were beſt to doe, with his treaſure; Whereas, if he had not found it all togeather; but that ſome one had giuen it him, by little, and little, accommodating him, and ſuſtaining him by degrees, the poore man would haue liued con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tented, and it would neuer haue coſt him his life.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="602" facs="tcp:100776:338"/>
O thou, who art the riches of the poore! and how admirably doſt thou know, how to ſuſtaine Soules? and how carefull art thou, to ſhew them treaſures, by little, and little; and that they may not ſee too much at once; when I ſee ſo great a Maieſtie, as thine, diſſembled, as it were, and diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guiſed, in ſo ſmall a thing, as the Sacred Hoaſt? It is true, that in theſe latter times, and ſince I haue been partaker of theſe Viſions, I am euen in admi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration, at ſo great a wiſdome; nor doe I know, how our Lord giues me ſtrength, and courage, to approach it. But if he, who hath done me, and doth me ſtill, ſo great Fauours, did not gouerne mee alſo heerin, it were not poſſible, that I could diſſemble the matter anie longer, but muſt cry out, and that alowd, at the ſight of ſo great won<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders, as theſe.</p>
            <p>And what now is it then, that ſo miſerable a Creature, and ſo loaden with abominations, as I am, and who haue ſpent my whole life, in ſo lit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle feare of Almightie God, ought to find, with all reaſon, in her ſelf; to ſee, that ſhe approaches ſo great a Maieſtie, euen when he is pleaſed, that my Soule ſhould behold him, with her very eyes? How ſhall this mouth of mine, which hath vtter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed ſo manie words, againſt the Seruice of that verie Lord himſelf, preſume to touch that moſt Glorious Bodie of his, ſo full of pietie, and puritie; ſince the loue, which that Diuine Countenance, of ſo much beautie, ſuauitie, and affabilitie, diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>couers to vs, doth more afflict, and wound the
<pb n="603" facs="tcp:100776:338"/>
Soule, then doth, euen that feare, and terrour, which is bred in vs, by the conſideration of his high Maieſtie. But what then, ſhould I feele in my ſelf, who haue ſeen all this, whereof I ſpeake, two ſeuerall times? I am really about to ſay, O thou my deare Lord, and the verie Glorie of my Soule, that I haue, in ſome kind, done thee Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uice, by the great afflictions, which my Soule hath felt in her ſelf; and yet, alas, alas, I can hard<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly tell euen what I ſay, who am, in effect, writ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing this, without knowing, almoſt, what I doe, For I find, that I am all troubled, yea and halfe beſides my ſelf, when I goe back, to bring theſe things to my remembrance; though I might ſeem to haue ſome little reaſon, for what I ſay; and that I had done ſome little thing, for thy Seruice, O my Lord, &amp; my God. But ſince I am not the owner of ſo much as one good thought, if thou impart it not to mee, there is nothing, for which I can pretend to be thanked; but I am ſtill the debtour, O my Lord; and ſtill, thou art the partie offended.</p>
            <p>Going one day, to receaue the B. Sacrament, I ſaw two Diuelis, with the eyes of my Soule, more clearly, then if I had ſeen them with the eyes of my Bodie, in a moſt abominable figure. And, me thought, their hornes did encompaſſe the very throat, of a certaine poore Preiſt; and I ſaw alſo my Lord, with that great Maieſtie, whereof I haue ſpoken, placed in thoſe hands of that Preiſt, which he was going to miniſter to me, with the ſame
<pb n="604" facs="tcp:100776:339"/>
ſinnefull hands of his; for I vnderſtood that Soule, to be then, in the ſtate of Mortall Sinne. But now, what kind of Obiect, muſt it be, to ſee thy Beau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie, O my Lord, in the midſt of ſo abominable fi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gures? Thoſe Diuells were, as all amazed, and frighted, in thy preſence, and willingly enough, would haue been gone from thence, if they could haue gotten thy leaue. This gaue me ſuch an ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſiue trouble, that I knew not, how I ſhould be able to Communicate, through the great feare, wherein I was; as conceauing, that, if it had been a true Viſion, his Diuine Maieſtie would neuer haue permitted, that I ſhould diſcerne the miſerie, wherein that poore Soule remained. The ſame deare Lord of mine, commanded me to pray for that Soule, and told me, that he had ſuffered, what I had ſeen, to the end, that I might know, of how great power, and force, the words of <hi>Conſecration</hi> were; and that Almightie God would not be kept from thence, how wicked ſoeuer that Preiſt ſhould be, who pronounced them; and to the end, that I might alſo diſcerne his great goodnes, in not forbearing to put himſelf into the hands, euen of his greateſt enemies, for the good, both of me, and of all men. And I alſo vnderſtood thereby, how much more, Preiſts are obliged to be vertuous, and good, then other men; and how terrible a thing it is, to take the B. Sacra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment vnworthily; and how abſolute a Lord, the Diuel is, of anie Soule, which is in Mortall Sinne. In fine, this paſſage did me a great deale of good,
<pb n="605" facs="tcp:100776:339"/>
and gaue me a moſt particular knowledge, of the very great obligation, wherein I was, to Al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mightie God; And let him be Bleſſed, and praiſed, for all eternitie. Amen.</p>
            <p>Another time, I hapned to ſee another thing, which amazed me extreamly. I was in a certaine place, where a certaine perſon dyed, who had li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ued very ill, and that manie yeares; but during two of them, he had been ſick; and, in ſome things, he alſo ſeemed to be reformed. This man dyed without Confeſſion; but ſtill, it ſeemed to me, that he was not to be damned; though yet, whilſt men were ſhrowding him, and preparing him for Buriall, I ſaw manie Diuells poſſeſſe themſelues of that Bodie; and they ſeemed, as it were, to play with it; and yet withall, they vſed diuerſe cruelties vpon it; for they did, with cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taine great hookes, both teare, and toſſe it, from one to another; and this ſtruck me into a very great feare. When afterward I ſaw him carried to be buried, with all the ceremonie, and honour, which is allowed to others, I conſidered the goodnes of Almightie God, in not permitting the Soule, euen of that man, to be defamed, but that it might be concealed, that he was an Enemie of his.</p>
            <p>For my part, I was euen turned halfe foole, by what I had ſeen; yet, during all the performance of the Office of the Dead, there was no more Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uel, to be ſeen; but when afterward, they put the Bodie into the Graue, there was ſuch a multitude
<pb n="606" facs="tcp:100776:340"/>
of them, readie to receaue the Bodie, that I was euen out of my ſelf, with beholding it; and it was no little courage, which I needed, for enabling me to diſſemble the ſeeing it. And I conſidered, how thoſe Diuels were likelie to treat that Soule, when they exerciſed ſuch an abſolute dominion, euen ouer that woefull Bodie. And I would to Chriſt, that, what I ſaw, had alſo been ſeen by ſuch, as are in Mortall Sinne; for, me thinkes, it muſt haue been of much effect, and force, to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards a making them mend their liues.</p>
            <p>Now, all this obliged mee to know, more and more, what I owed to Almightie God; and from what he had deliuered my Soule, But yet I went on, with feare enough, till I had imparted theſe particulars to my Ghoſtlie Father, as conceauing, that, perhaps, it might haue been ſome Illuſion of the Diuel, whereby to defame that Soule, though yet the man had not been held to be of very good life. But yet, it is verie true, that whether it were an Illuſion, or no, I am ſure, I neuer remember it, but it makes me afrayd.</p>
            <p>And now, ſince I haue begunne to ſpeake of Viſions, which haue relation to ſome ſuch per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons, as are dead, I will alſo declare ſome things, concerning ſome other kind of Soules, which our Lord hath been pleaſed, that I ſhould ſee. But I will speake only of few; both to be the ſhorter, and becauſe it will not be neceſſarie to ſay much, in order to the receauing of benefit thereby. They told me once, that a certaine man
<pb n="607" facs="tcp:100776:340"/>
was dead, who had been Prouinciall of his Order; but when he dyed, he was Prouinciall of another Prouince. Now, I had communicated much, with this man; and had been obliged to him, for ſome good offices, which he had done me. This man was of much, &amp; many vertues; but yet when I came to know that he was dead, I was greatly troubled at it, becauſe I was in feare, and doubt, of his Saluation, in regard, that he had been a Prelate, or Superiour, twentie yeares; which re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally, is a thing, that I am apt to feare, as holding it, to be a matter of much danger, to haue charge of Soules. And ſo I went, with trouble enough, to an Oratorie, and gaue him all that little good, which I had euer done, in my whole life; which yet was little enough; and I humbly beſought out Bleſſed Lord, that he would ſupply, out of his in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>finit merits, for as much, as that Soule might wat, towards the freeing it ſelf, out of Purgatorie. And whilſt I was begging this Boone of our Bleſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed Lord, in the beſt manner I could, me thought he roſe, as from ſome deep part, out of the earth, on my right ſide; and ſo I ſaw him mount-vp to Heauen, with very great ioy. The man was very old, before he dyed; but yet now, he ſeemed to me, to be but of thirtie yeares old, or rather ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>what leſſe; but with much brightnes, in his face. This Viſion paſſed away, very ſpeedily; but yet I was ſo extreamly comforted by it, that the death of that man, did put mee now, to no more paine; though I had troubled manie others, about him;
<pb n="608" facs="tcp:100776:341"/>
for he was very well beloued. And thus alſo the comfort of my Soule, being ſo great, I could not poſſibly doubt; but that the Viſion was true; and no illuſion. This hapned but fifteen dayes, after his death; but ſtill I was not ſlack; in procuring, that he might be recommended to Almightie God; ſaue that, I could not doe it ſo hartily; as be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore I ſaw this Viſion. For, when our Lord ſhewes me ſuch things, and that yet I will pray for them afterward, I cannot chooſe but conceaue, that it is, as if I gaue an Almes to a rich man. But now, I came to vnderſtand afterward, (for the man dyed very farre off) that the death, which our Lord granted him, was of ſo great comfort to him, by the knowledge of himſelf, and by the humilitie, which he expreſſed, that it was of very great edi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fication.</p>
            <p>Now, a certaine Religious Woeman dyed at home with vs, about a day and a halfe, before that occurred, whereof I am going to ſpeake; but ſhe had been a good Seruant of Almightie God. And another Religious Woeman reading one of thoſe Leſſons, which belong to the Office of the Dead, which was recited in the Quire, for her Soule, it was my turne, to ſtand by; and aſſiſt, in repeating the Verſi<gap reason="illegible: blotted" extent="2 letters">
                  <desc>••</desc>
               </gap>e; but in the midſt of the Leſſon, me thought, I ſaw the Soule riſe vp, as the other did; and ſo went to Heauen. Now, this was no Ima<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginarie Viſion, like the laſt; but like others, which I recounted before. Yet theſe be no leſſe certaine, then thoſe others are.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="609" facs="tcp:100776:341"/>
There was alſo another Religious Woeman of between eighteen, and twentie yeares old, who dyed at home, in our Houſe. Now ſhe had been alwaies ſicklie, and a great Seruant of God; and very diligent in the Quire; and, in fine, a very vertuous woeman; and really, I was apt to thinke, that ſhe ſhould not haue gone to Purgatorie at all, but rather, that there would haue been ſuper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>numerarie merits, in regard of the manie ſickneſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes, which ſhe had endured. But yet, when we were reciting the Office, before ſhe was buryed, and ſome foure howers after ſhe dyed, I vnder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtood, that her Soule ſprung vp, out of the ſame place, and went to Heauen.</p>
            <p>Being one day, in a Colledge <hi>of the Societie of</hi> IESVS, with thoſe great afflictions, and troubles, which I haue declared my ſelfe ſometimes to haue had, and ſtill haue, both in Bodie, and Soule, I found my ſelf, to be in ſuch condition, that me thought I was not able, ſo much as to entertaine one good thought. There dyed, that night, a Brother <hi>of the Societie,</hi> of that Houſe; and I recom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mending him, the beſt I could, to Almightie God; and being at the Maſſe of another Father <hi>of the So<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cietie,</hi> for his Soule, I was ſeazed by a very great Recollection; and I ſaw him goe-vp to Heauen, with much glorie; yea and I vnderſtood, that our Bleſſed Lord himſelf, did accompanie him, by way of particular fauour.</p>
            <p>A Religious man of our Order, who was a very good man, was falne very dangerouſly ſick; And
<pb n="610" facs="tcp:100776:342"/>
I, being then at Maſſe, grew to be in very great Recollection, and ſaw, that the man was dead; and that he went, inſtantly, to Heauen, without touching vpon Purgatorie at all; and he dyed in that verie hower, as I was told afterward. Now I wondred, that he had neuer entred into Purga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>torie; but I vnderſtood, that he, hauing been a Religious man, and hauing well obſerued the Vowes of his Profeſſion, the Bulles, granted in fauour of his Order, had auailed him, towards his eſcape of Purgatorie. Now, I know not, why this was giuen to be vnderſtood, by me; but, me thinkes, it may be very well, to make me know, that a man's being a Religious man, doth not conſiſt only in his Habit; I meane, not in the on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lie wearing it, as if that verie thing, did endue him with more perfection.</p>
            <p>I will now relate no more of theſe things; for there is no great cauſe, why I ſhould; though yet our Bleſſed Lord haue done me the fauour, to ſhew me very manie. But amongſt all thoſe Soules, which I haue ſeen, I haue not vnderſtood of anie one, which eſcapes the going at all, into Purgatorie, but only this laſt Father, and that holie man, <hi>Fray Pedro de Alcantara,</hi> and that <hi>Dominican</hi> Father, of whome I ſpake before. Our Lord hath alſo been pleaſed to let me ſee the ſeuerall de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>grees, which they haue of glorie, by repreſenting the places to me, wherein they are; and I find, that there is a great deale of difference, between ſome, and others.</p>

               <p>She proceeds in the ſame Subiect, of shevving the great Fauours, vvhich our Lord had done her. And she declares, hovv he vvas pleaſed to promiſe his Fauour to them, for vvhome she should begg it; and she relates ſome important particulars, vvherein his Diuine Maieſtie had done her particular Fauours, of this kind.</p>
            </argument>
            <p>BEing once very importunate, with our Bleſſed Lord, that he would be pleaſed, to giue ſight to a certaine perſon, to whome I had obligation, and who was almoſt growne to be vtterly blind, I had much compaſſion on him; and I feared, leaſt our Lord would not heare me, in regard of my Sinnes. But yet he appeared to me then, as he had alſo done, at other times, and beganne to ſhew me the Wound of his left hand; and, with his right hand, he drew out the great naile, which had been thruſt into it; and me thought, that ſome of the verie fleſh, came out, with the naile. I ſaw well, how great paine it did import; and it afflicted me much. But he told me, that ſince he had endured ſo much for my ſake, I ſhould not doubt, but that he would more eaſily be drawne, to harken to this Suite of mine; and ſo he promi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed,
<pb n="612" facs="tcp:100776:343"/>
that he would grant, whatſoeuer I ſhould deſire; but, he knew very well already, that I would begg nothing of him, but only to his owne honour, and glorie; and that I made this preſent Suite, vnder that condition. He willed me alſo to remember, and conſider, that euen, when I did him not true Seruice, I had not deſired anie thing of him, which he had not granted, euen better, then my ſelf had deſired; and therefore, how much more would he be ſure enough, to doe it now, when he knew I loued him; and therefore, that I ſhould banniſh all doubt. And, I thinke, eight dayes did not paſſe, but that our Lord reſtor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed ſight, to that perſon; and this was preſently knowne, by my Ghoſtlie Father. Now, perad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uenture, as I thought at firſt, this did not happen, by meanes of anie prayer of mine; though yet, ſince I ſaw this Viſion, I haue remained with ſome little certaintie, that the thing was done, by the Fauour of his Diuine Maieſtie, to me; and accord<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ingly, I haue preſented him with my thankes.</p>
            <p>Another time, there was a perſon ſick, of a very painefull infirmitie; which, becauſe it was of an odd condition, and way, I forbeare to parti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cularize it heer. But it was a kind of inſupportable thing; and he had been troubled with it, two moneths; but he endured a torment by it, which did euen teare him in peices. Now, my Ghoſtlie Father went to viſit him; and that, was the Rec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tour of the Colledge, of whome I ſpake; and he had great compaſſion of the man; and told me,
<pb n="613" facs="tcp:100776:343"/>
that, in anie caſe, I muſt alſo goe &amp; giue him a Viſit, for that he was a perſon, to whome I might handſomly doe it, in regard, that he was my Kinſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man. I went, and had ſo much pittie of him, that I beganne to begg his health of our Lord, after a very importunate manner. And in this, I ſaw clearly (by the very vttermoſt, of what I am able to imagine) how much Fauour our Lord was pleaſed to doe me therein; for inſtantly, vpon the verie next day, he was abſolutly well.</p>
            <p>I was once in a great deale of trouble, becauſe I came to know, that a certaine perſon, to whome I was much obliged, was reſolued to doe a thing, which was greatly againſt the honour, both of Almightie God, and himſelf; and yet he was very much bent, to doe the thing. Now, my trouble for this, was ſo great, that I knew not, which way to find remedie, and meanes, to make him leaue it; and indeed, it rather ſeemed, that there was none. But then, I beſought Almightie God, and that with my whole hart, that he would help vs; and till I could find it done, I ſhould be in paine. Being therefore now in this caſe, I went to a certaine Oratory, a little remore from where I was; for there are diuerſe ſuch, in this Monaſte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rie; and finding a Picture of Chriſt our Lord, as he was bound to the Pillar, I humbly begged of his Diuine Maieſtie, to doe me that Fauour. And preſently, I heard one ſpeake to me, in a moſt ſweet voice; but it was framed, as if it had been, in the manner of whiſtling. For my part, I was all
<pb n="614" facs="tcp:100776:344"/>
in a fright; and the verie haire of my head, ſtood an end; and I had a great deſire, to heare, what it ſayd to me. But when once my feare was gone, (which was alſo quickly), I remained with reſt, and ioy, and ſo great an interiour kind of delight, that it amazed me, how the onlie hearing of a voice, (and that, with the onlie eares of fleſh, and bloud; yea and without the articulation, or fram<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of anie one word) was able to produce ſo powerfull an operation in the Soule. But, in the meane time, I found euen thereby, that the thing, which I had deſired, ſhould be done; and ſo it was; and the paine, wherein I found my ſelfe, concerning it, was vtterly remoued, in a thing, which was not yet, as if I had found it, to be cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainly granted, as it hapned to be, afterward. And I related the whole accident, to my Confeſſours, who, at that time, were two; and they both, were very learned men, and the Seruants of Almighty God.</p>
            <p>I knew alſo of a certaine perſon, who had re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolued to ſerue his Diuine Maieſtie, in very good earneſt; and he had vſed Prayer, ſome dayes; and therein, his Diuine Maieſtie had done him manie Fauours; and yet he gaue-ouer his courſe of Prayer, vpon certaine occaſions, which occurred to him; and thoſe he did not quitt, although they were full of danger. This put me to a great deale of paine; becauſe the man, whome the matter concerned, was a perſon, whome both I loued much, and whome I alſo was much obliged to
<pb n="615" facs="tcp:100776:344"/>
loue. And, I beleiue, it had been more then a moneth, wherein I did almoſt nothing els, but begg of Almightie God, that he would bring this Soule back, to himſelf. And being in Prayer, one day, I ſaw a Diuel hard by me, with certaine pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pers in his hand, which he was tearing; and he ſeemed to be in a very great rage. But this put me into much comfort; becauſe I conceiued thereby, that my Suite was granted; and ſo it was, as I came to know afterward. For, the Partie had been at Confeſſion, and had done it, with great Contrition; and he returned, in ſo very good ear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſt, to Almightie God, that I hope in his Diuine Maieſtie, he will euer goe aduancing in his Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uice. And let him be Bleſſed for euer, Amen.</p>
            <p>In this particular, of procuring our Bleſſed Lord, to bring Soules out of greiuous Sinnes, vp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on my humble ſuite; and of others, who were brought, manie times, to more perfection; and of freing Soules alſo out of Purgatorie; and of doing other things alſo of great importance, the Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uours of our Bleſſed Lord, haue been ſo great, that I ſhould both wearie my ſelf, and my Read<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er, if I would pretend to relate them. And theſe things haue hapned oftner to me, for the benefit of Soules, then of Bodies; and this is ſo very well knowne, that it hath manie witneſſes. But then inſtantly, there grew a kind of Scruple vpon me, ſince I could not chooſe but beleiue, that our Lord was pleaſed, to doe diuerſe things, through my Prayer, (for, in this caſe, and at this time I
<pb n="616" facs="tcp:100776:345"/>
abſtract from his goodnes, and mercye, which is euer the cheif cauſe of all things) but for the reſt, theſe are now ſo manie particulars, and ſo well knowne by others, that I haue no difficulty at all, to beleiue them; and I bleſſe his Diuine Maieſtie, for the ſame; and they put me to great confuſion; becauſe I ſtill find my ſelf, to be, more, and, more, a debtour. But that conſideration makes my deſire to ſerue him, encreaſe; and reviues my loue. And (which yet amazes me more,) thoſe things, which our Lord findes not to be conuenient, I can ſcarce begg of his Diuine Maieſtie, euen almoſt, al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>though I would; and if I doe, it is with ſo little ſtrength, and ſpirit, and care, that, although I would faine force my ſelf, yet it is euen impoſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble for me, to doe it in theſe, as I doe it in thoſe others, which his Diuine Maieſtie hath a minde to effect; for, ſuch, I ſee, I am able to begg often, and that, with great importunitie; and though I carrie not the particular care of them, about me, yet me thinkes, they come before me, of them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelues. So that the difference, between theſe two wayes of asking, is ſo very great, as I am not able to declare. For, though I aske in one of theſe kinds of things, wherein, I forbeare not to vrge my ſelf to begg them of our Lord; (howſoeuer I feele not that kind of feruour in my ſelf, which I doe in thoſe other) and though they chance to import mine owne particular very much, yet is it, in ef<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect, but as when a man chances to be toung<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tyed; who although he would faine ſpeake, yet
<pb n="617" facs="tcp:100776:345"/>
he cannot doe it; and if he ſpeake, it is but in ſuch ſort, as that he ſees, it cannot be vnderſtood; whereas the other; is, as when a man ſpeakes cleare, and plaine, to a man, whome he findes very willing to heare him. Or els, let vs ſay, that one of thoſe Fauours, is begged, as by a Vocall Prayer; and the other, as in a way of Contempla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, which is ſo very ſublime, that our Lord re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſents himſelf in ſuch ſort, as that we vnder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtand, that he vnderſtands vs; and that his Diuine Maieſtie is ioyed to ſee, that we begg anie thing of him, that ſo he may doe vs fauour. Bleſſed be he for euer, who giues vs ſo much; and to whome I giue ſo little. For what, O my Lord, doth anie man, who doth not euen defeate himſelf wholy for thee? and yet, <hi>hovv much, hovv much, hovv much,</hi> and a thouſand times more, I might ſay, <hi>hovv much,</hi> am I wanting heerin? And now, vpon this reaſon, I ſhould not ſo much, as once deſire, euen to liue (though yet, I haue other reaſons alſo, not to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſire it) becauſe I liue not, according to my obli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gation towards thee. Nay, how full doe I ſee my<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf of imperfections, and with what faintnes, and baſenes, doe I ſerue thee? And really, me thinkes, ſometimes, I wiſh, that I were euen depriued of ſenſe, that ſo I might not vnderſtand ſo very much ill of my ſelf, as I doe. Yet I beſeech him, to redreſſe it all, who knowes ſo well, how to doe it.</p>
            <p>But I remember, I ſpake before, of my being in the Houſe of a certaine great Ladie; where, I
<pb n="618" facs="tcp:100776:346"/>
aſſure you, folkes had good reaſon, to haue their witts, well about them, and alwaies to be conſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dering the vanitie, which worldlie things carrie with them. For ſhe was a perſon, very much eſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teemed, and very much praiſed; and there were temptations enow, towards leſſe perfection, through much diſtraction; whereby one might eaſily, haue been ſhrewdly taken, if I had looked vpon nothing, but my ſelf. But he who iudgeth rightly, and lookes vpon vs, with true ſight in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed, was carefull not to giue ouer the keeping me, euer, ſafe, in his hands. And now, when I am ſpeaking of hauing a true, and reall ſight of things, I remember, and conſider, the great trouble, which anie ſuch perſon, as whome it hath pleaſed Almightie God to endue with a knowledge of that, which indeed is Truth, muſt needs be put to, when he is forced to treat with others, about things, which concerne this tranſitorie, and trou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bleſome world; where, all, in fine, is much diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guiſed, and masked, as our Lord himſelf told me once.</p>
            <p>But, in the meane time, manie of thoſe things, which I write heer, are by no meanes, of mine owne head; but they haue been told me, by that Heauenlie Maiſter of mine. And becauſe, in all thoſe things, which I am wont to affirme, after a direct and poſitiue manner, I vſe to expreſſe my ſelf, by theſe words: <hi>This I vnderſtood;</hi> or els, <hi>Our Lord told me this;</hi> I find my ſelf with a very great ſcruple, of either adding, or, anie way, altering,
<pb n="619" facs="tcp:100776:346"/>
ſo much as anie one ſyllable thereof. And ſo, when<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſoeuer I doe not moſt expreſly remember euerie circumſtance of anie thing, of this kind (which is to be related by me) I am wont to deliuer that, alwaies, as in mine owne name. Or els, becauſe ſometimes they proceed from mine owne parti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cular dictamens, I vſe not to call anie thing mine, which is good in itſelf; becauſe indeed, I am farre enough from being ignorant, that anie ſuch thing, as is in me, is good; but I affirme only thoſe things, as in mine owne name, and they are deliuered, as by my ſelf, which did not come into my vnderſtanding, and knowledge, by way of Reuelation.</p>
            <p>But O my deare Lord, and my God! and how often doth it happen to vs heer, that euen, in the moſt ſpirituall occaſions, we are reſolued, manie times, to vnderſtand things, but iuſt ſo, as we haue a minde to vnderſtand them our ſelues; and euen they are wreſted much, from the true ſenſe. And ſo we alſo doe, in things of this world; and we will needs make our ſelues beleiue, that we muſt tax euen our owne profit in Spirit, according to the meaſure of the time, wherein we haue had anie exerciſe of Prayer. Nay it ſeemes, that we haue had a minde, to put a tax, and limit, vpon him, who, by no meanes, will be ſubiect to anie, when there is queſtion of imparting his Fauours, which he is wont to diſpoſe, when he will, and who can impart more benedictions to one, in ſix moneths, then to another, in a great multitude of
<pb n="620" facs="tcp:100776:347"/>
yeares. And this is a moſt certaine truth, which I haue ſeen ſo expreſly verifyed, euen with my verie eyes, vpon the inſtance of manie perſons, that I wonder, how we can ſo much as detaine our ſelues, in the leaſt doubt thereof. But I am very apt to beleiue, that a man, who hath anie talent, in trying, and knowing Spirits, and to whome our Bleſſed Lord ſhall haue giuen true Humilitie, will not be able to fall, and continue in this errour. For, ſuch a man will iudge of things, by the effects, and by the ſtrong purpoſes, and firme reſolutions, and loue of the party, who is chiefly concerned. And beſides, our Lord is wont to giue ſuch a perſon light, whereby he may be able to vnderſtand it; and by that verie light, he alſo diſcernes, the profiting, and proceeding for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward, of Soules; and not by the number of yeares, wherein they haue attended to theſe things. Becauſe ſome one Soule, may, as I ſayd before, haue obtained that, in ſix moneths, which another ſhall not haue been able to get, in twentie yeares. For, as I ſayd alſo before, our Lord be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtowes thoſe things, to whome he will; and com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monly he doth it to ſuch, as diſpoſe themſelues beſt, to receiue them. And in proofe heerof, I ſee, that there come now to this Houſe of ours, cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taine Gentlewoemen, and Ladies, who are very young; and yet, when our Bleſſed Lord vouch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſafes once to touch their harts, and to giue them a little Light, and Loue; and when, in a very ſhort time, he is pleaſed to allow, and impart ſome Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>galo,
<pb n="621" facs="tcp:100776:347"/>
and guſt of Spirit, to them, they haue not ſtayed, and pawſed; nor was anie difficultie able to offer it ſelf againſt them, which could ſtopp them; but they would be going on, without ſo much as remembring, that they were to liue, by eating their meate; and they ſhut themſelues vp, for euer, in a Houſe, without hauing ſo much, as anie Reuenue, vpon which to liue; like perſons, who put no manner of eſteem, vpon anie thing of this world, for the loue of him, who, they know, loues them. And they giue ouer, euen all things, all at once; nor haue they anie will at all, which is meerly their owne; nor doe they vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtand it, to be poſſible, that euer they can re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceaue diſguſt, by enduring ſuch a ſtraight ſhutting vp; but all of them, offer-vp their whole ſelues, in Sacrifice, to the honour, and glorie of Al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mightie God.</p>
            <p>And now, how willingly, and iuſtly doe I allow them, to haue gotten the Start of me heerin? and how mightily ought I to be aſhamed, and euen confounded, in the preſence of Almightie God, to ſee, that, what his Diuine Maieſtie could not finiſh in my Soule, through my fault, in ſuch a multitude of yeares, ſince I vſed Prayer, and wherein he beganne to doe me Fauours, he hath yet been able to accompliſh in them, within three moneths; yea and euen, with ſome of them, in three dayes, with doing them alſo farre leſſe Fauour, then to me. Though yet withall, it be very true, that our Bleſſed Lord, payes them ſo well,
<pb n="622" facs="tcp:100776:348"/>
for their paines, that they are all, very farre, from being ſorrie, to haue done, whatſoeuer they haue done, for the loue of him.</p>
            <p>For this purpoſe, I could wiſh, that we might call to minde, how manie yeares they are, ſince we made our Profeſſion, and haue vſed Mentall Prayer. Not yet, for the giuing them anie trouble, by making them turne back, who haue made a great deale of way, in a ſhort time, and to get them to goe, but our pace, which is as much as it would be, to make them, who flye like Eagles (through the Fauours, which it hath pleaſed Al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mightie God, to doe them) to walke the ſlow dull pace of a ſhackled Hen; but to the end, that we may grow, to carrie the honour of his Diuine Maieſtie, in our eye. And then, if we find theſe Siſters of ours, to be humble, whome we ſee, to be ſo forward, in the way of Spirit, that we ſhould giue them, ſtill, the raynes. For certainly, our Bleſſed Lord, who hath done them ſo great Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uours already, will neuer ſuffer them to breake their necks, by falling downe, as from ſome dan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gerous rock. They commit, and truſt themſelues, in the hands of Almightie God; for, this benefit doe they reape, by the truth, which Faith teaches them; and ſhall not we alſo truſt them there? but <note n="*" place="margin">An excellent &amp; moſt vſefull Docu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment.</note> muſt we limit, and confine them, by our narrow meaſure, according to the meanneſſe, &amp; ſtraight<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nes of our owne poore mindes? No, no; this muſt not be; but rather, if our ſelues cannot ariue to be owners of thoſe ſtrong affections, and firme re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolutions,
<pb n="623" facs="tcp:100776:348"/>
which abound in them (for, theſe things cannot be well vnderſtood, without ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perience) let vs procure to humble our ſelues, and not condemne them? For els, by ſeeming to haue a care of their aduantage, and profit, we ſhall depriue our ſelues, of our owne; and we ſhall alſo looſe the occaſion, which our Lord ſhewes vs ſo faire, for our owne greater humili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie; and that we may the better vnderſtand, how much is wanting to vs; as alſo, how much more abſolutly, thoſe other Soules are likelie to be vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tyed, and freed, from worldlie things then ours; and how much neerer, they are approached to Almightie God, then we; ſince we ſee, that his Diuine Maieſtie, is come ſo much cloſer vp, to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards them, then vs. For my part, I can vnder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtand no more, in this caſe; neither indeed haue I anie deſire to vnderſtand more, then that I had rather haue ſuch Prayer, as hauing been obtained, and exerciſed but a ſhort time, might be found to haue great effects, and which inſtantly appeare, (for it is impoſſible, that a Creature ſhould be content, to throw away a whole world at once, vpon the onlie reaſon, of pleaſing Almightie God, without a mightie force of loue) then ſuch an other kind of Prayer, as ſhould haue continued manie yeares; and yet neuer, in fine, haue made an end of reſoluing vpon anie more, at the laſt, then at the firſt, to doe aniething, for the pure loue of Almightie God, vnleſſe it be ſome poore, little, fidling bable, which is no bigger, then a
<pb n="624" facs="tcp:100776:349"/>
graine of Salt, which hath neither bulke, nor weight, but is ſuch, as that anie Bird might be able, to carrie it away, in her Bill. For, I confeſſe, we hold it not, for a matter of much effect, and mortification, when a great account is made, of doing ſuch, and ſuch things, for the loue of our Lord, which indeed, it is both pittie, and ſhame, that we ſhould vnderſtand, and value, at anie rate, though perhaps we ſhould doe neuer ſo manie, of that kind. For my part, I am but one of theſe, and am apt, not only to forget the Fauours of Al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mightie God, but euen to ouervalue mine owne poore endeauours. I ſay not yet, but that his Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uine Maieſtie will vouchſafe to put ſome value euen vpon little things, through his owne great goodnes; but as for me, I would make no account thereof; nor, in effect, ſo much as ſee, that I doe them, ſince they are but a kind of Nothing. But yet, pardon me, euen heerin, O my deare Lord; and blame me not, if I procure to comfort my ſelf, with thinking of this little kind of Somewhat, ſince I am able to ſerue thee ſolidly, in Nothing; but if really I found my ſelf able, to ſerue thee, in things, which were indeed of weight, and mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, I would be farre from making account of theſe things, of Nothing.</p>
            <p>O how happie are thoſe perſons, who are able to doe thee Seruice, in great matters? And cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainly, if hauing enuie of them, and entertaining earneſt deſires, of being able to doe the like, inight be taken by thee, for good payment, vpon
<pb n="625" facs="tcp:100776:349"/>
true account, from this poore Seruant of thine, infallibly I would not ſitt-out at pleaſing thee. But the truth, my deare Lord, is this, That directly I am good for nothing; though yet, thou maiſt well giue me value, ſince thou loueſt me ſo much.</p>
            <p>But now, it hapned lately, by a <hi>Breue,</hi> which came from <hi>Rome,</hi> that this Monaſterie ſhould be vncapable of Reuenue; ſo that now, it may be eſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teemed to be finiſhed. It coſt vs ſome trouble to effect it; and I remained with much comfort, to ſee things ſetled. And reflecting vpon the difficul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties, which I had mett; and praiſing our Bleſſed Lord, for his being pleaſed, to haue partly ſerued himſelf of me heerin, I applyed my ſelf a little, to looke back, vpon all the paſſages of the whole buſines. And really, it is very true, that in euerie one of thoſe particulars, wherein there might be anie apparance, that I had contributed ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>what, I find manie imperfections, and errours; Sometimes, of little Courage; and ſometimes alſo, of little Faith. For, till I ſaw all that accompliſhed, which it had pleaſed our Bleſſed Lord to tell me before, of what ſhould be done, concerning it, I did neuer, in a reſolute, and aſſured manner, make an end, of fully beleiuing, that it would be, though yet withall, it be true, that I alſo could not tell, how to doubt it. Nor knew I, how all this could ſtand togeather; but it ſeemes, that manie times, it looked in my eye, as if it muſt be impoſſible, on the one ſide, and yet, it could not be doubted, on the other; I meane, it could not be firmly be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leiued,

but that the thing, would be done. Yet, in fine, I found, that there was this aduantage in it, That our Lord himſelf, did all the good, which was done; and I, all the ill; and ſo I would thinke of it, no more: becauſe, if I did, I ſhould be ſure to ſtumble vpon manie faults of mine owne. But, Bleſſed be he, for euer, who, when he is diſpoſed, knowes how to fetch good out of them all; Amen.</p>
            <p>I ſay then, that it is no leſſe, then a kind of dan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gerous thing, to goe rating, and meaſuring the only yeares, wherein anie bodie may haue had the exerciſe of Mentall Prayer. For, though per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>haps, there may be a peice of Humilitie in the conſideration thereof, yet withall, it alſo ſeemes, that there is a kind, of I cannot tell what, as if there were a ſhew, that a bodie would conceiue, that he had deſerued ſome little thing, for his paines. I ſay not, that theſe yeares of Prayer, haue not their worth; and ſo we ſhall be well payd for them; but yet, if anie Spirituall perſon ſhall con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiue, that, for the manie yeares, wherein he hath vſed Mentall Prayer, he deſerue thoſe great Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>galo's, and guſts, I hold it for a moſt infallible truth, that he ſhall neuer get vp, to the topp of Libertie of Spirit. But, is it not, on the other ſide, enough, that he hath obtained ſo much Fauour of Almightie God, that he defends him ſo farre, as to hinder him from committing ſuch Sinnes, as he fell into, before he was a man of Prayer? but that now, forſooth, he will needs proceed
<pb n="627" facs="tcp:100776:350"/>
with his Diuine Maieſtie, for the Fauours, which he hath receaued from his holie hand, as thoſe Debtours vſe to doe, who goe to Suite with Cre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ditours, for their owne money. Perhaps (as I was ſaying) this may looke, in ſome lights, like a peice of profound Humilitie; but for my part, I cannot thinke ſo; but rather, that it is a part of boldnes. And I am ſure enough, that I (with being not humble at all) neuer durſt preſume, ſo farre. Yet perhaps, this laſt is true, in regard, that I neuer did God anie ſeruice; and therefore, I haue begged no ſuch fauour at his hands; whereas yet, if I had thought, I had deſerued, I ſhould haue been more earneſt, then anie other, in deſiring of our Lord, that I might be payd, euen heer, for my paines. And yet, I doe not ſay, but that a Soule may goe encreaſing, by this meanes; and that God will make him amends, if his Prayer haue been hum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble; but yet ſtill, I would faine haue that point forgotten, which ſpeakes of reckoning-vp thoſe manie yeares of our Seruice of our Lord. For, all that, which we are, anie way, able to doe, is fitt to make a man, euen caſt the gorge, in compari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon of the leaſt dropp of that bloud, which our Bleſſed Lord ſhed for vs. And if, beſides, it be moſt really true, that, by doing Seruice to Al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mightie God, we come to be his debtours, ſo much the more, what manner of thing is it, that we ſhould fall vpon begging recompences of that kind; ſince, if we pay a Farthing of the old debt, there returnes a Bill of a thouſand Ducats vpon
<pb n="628" facs="tcp:100776:351"/>
vs, for a new Loane. But, in fine, for the loue of our Lord, let vs leaue to paſſe theſe iudgements, which indeed, ought not to be ours, but his. This courſe of making Compariſons, is not ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cellent, euen in temporall, &amp; familiar things; and what then ſhall it be, about that, which God only knowes? And his Diuine Maieſtie ſhewes well, that he knowes it; for he reſolues, when he thin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kesfitt, to pay the laſt Labourer, as well as the firſt.</p>
            <p>I haue written that, which heer I haue deliuer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed in theſe three ſheets of paper, at ſo manie ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uerall times, and in ſo ſeuerall dayes, (for I had, and haue ſtill, as I haue ſayd, ſo little meanes, and leaſure) that I had forgotten what I was beginn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to ſay, about this Viſion, which followes. But I ſaw, whilſt I was in Prayer, a great Feild, lying open, and all apart, by it ſelf; and that, much com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>panie, of different kindes, was round about me, which circled me in. And it ſeemed to me, that cuerie one, had offenſiue weapons in his hands, wherewith to hurt me; as Lances, Swords, and Daggers; and others had alſo long Staues. In a word, I could not get from thence, by anie way, or meanes, without danger of death; eſpecially, being alone, and not hauing anie one Creature, to helpe me. And being thus, in ſo great affliction of Spirit, that I knew not what to doe, I lifted-vp mine eyes towards Heauen, and ſaw Chriſt our Lord; not then in Heauen, but yet very high, and farre off from me, in the ayre, who reacht<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>forth his hand, towards me, and fauoured me
<pb n="629" facs="tcp:100776:351"/>
from thence, in ſuch ſort, that I feared neither all that other people, nor yet theſe; who all, were vnable to doe me hurt, how much ſoeuer they ſhould deſire it. This Viſion ſeemes, at the firſt ſight, to be without anie fruit, or good effect, at all; but it hath yet done me a great deale of good, becauſe I haue vnderſtood what it ſignifyed. For, I ſaw my ſelf, in that encounter, ſhortly after, and knew, that it was nothing els, but this Viſion; and I alſo came to know it, to be a verie picture, or rather Mappe of the world. For, as manie as are in it, (abſtracting euer from thoſe few, who apply themſelues, to doe our Lord particular Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uice) ſeemed to carrie Armes againſt this wretch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed Soule of ours; as namely, Honours, Eſtates, Delights, and the like. For it is euident, that the Soule is all ouercaſt with a Nett, before it be a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ware; at leaſt, all theſe things, doe the beſt they can, to endanger, and wrapp vs vp, faſt enough; as namely, Freinds, Kindred, and (which amazes me more) euen ſuch, as are vertuous people. For, I found my ſelf afterward, to be extreamly preſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed, and euen oppreſſed, by them: they concea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uing, in the meane time, that they carried them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelues very well; but, the while, I knew not at all, either how to defend my ſelf, or what to doe.</p>
            <p>O my deare God! and if now I ſhould ſtand, to relate the kindes, and differences of thoſe troubles, which ſet vpon me, at that time, euen after all thoſe others, whereof I ſpake before, how well might this, be able to ſerue for a
<pb n="630" facs="tcp:100776:352"/>
meanes, to make a man wholy abhorre all things? It was, me thinkes, the verie greateſt perſecution of all, that euer I had endured. For, I felt my ſelf, at ſome times, ſo ſtraightly ſet vpon, on all ſides, that I only found remedie, by lifting-vp mine eyes to Heauen, and crying vpon Almightie God. And I remembred very well, what I had ſeen, in this laſt Viſion of mine; and it did me a great deale of good, towards a not putting confidence in anie Creature; for, there is no one of them firme, and ſtable; but only God alone, is entirely, and truly ſo. But, in theſe great afflictions, our Lord hath euer vſed to ſend me ſome perſon, or other, who, in his name, might lend me his hand; as he ſigni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fyed to me, that he would; and as he did alſo let me ſee, in this laſt Viſion; and ſo I tyed not my ſelf to anie thing, but only to pleaſe our Bleſſed Lord; and this hath ſerued to ſuſtaine this poore little vertue, which I had, in deſiring to ſerue him; And let him be Bleſſed for euer.</p>
            <p>But finding my ſelf once, very vnquiet, and in great diſorder, yea and in skirmiſh, or rather, in a verie battaile, without being able to recollect my ſelf; yea and my thoughts being ſcattered, and diſperſed, vpon things, which were not very perfect; and withall, not ſeeming, to be ſo vtterly vntyed from all things, as I vſed; and being ſtill, ſo wicked, as I was, I grew afrayd, that the Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uours, which our Bleſſed Lord had done me, might fall-out to be Illuſions; and, in fine, I then remained, with a very great obſcuritic of minde.
<pb n="631" facs="tcp:100776:352"/>
But now, whilſt I was in this paine, our Lord beganne to ſpeake to me, and told me, that I muſt not be thus afflicted; but that, finding my ſelf in that caſe, I might well vnderſtand euen thereby, in how great miſerie I muſt remaine, if once he ſhould depart from me; and that there was to be no ſecuritie at all, as long as we ſhould continue in this world. I was alſo giuen to vnderſtand, how well our labour was employed, in this ſtrife, and warre, ſince it would not faile to be follow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, with ſo high a reward. And, me thought, our Bleſſed Lord had compaſſion of them, who liue in this world; but that I muſt not thinke, that he had forgotten me; yea and that he would neuer leaue me; but yet ſo, as that ſtill I muſt alſo doe my part, in helping my ſelf. And this did our Bleſſed Lord declare to me, with a kind of tender compaſſion, and Regalo, accompanied with cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taine words, whereby ſo high Fauour was done me, as I need not ſtand heer to relate. And theſe others, which follow heer now, his Diuine Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ieſtie ſaith alſo often to me, with demonſtration of moſt particular loue: <hi>Thou art novv, grovvne to be mine; and I am thine.</hi> And thoſe words, which I am euer wont to ſay (and to my thinking, I ſay them, with much truth) are theſe, which follow: <hi>VVhat care I, O my Lord, for my ſelf but only for thee?</hi> But I confeſſe, thoſe words of his, to me, are of great Regalo to my hart; though yet withall, they be of exceſſiue confuſion, when I remember, what kind of Creature I am. But <note n="*" place="margin">A true noble, &amp; moſt ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nerous hart.</note> it ſeemes, that
<pb n="632" facs="tcp:100776:353"/>
I haue need of more courage, for the receauing of thoſe high Fauours, then euen for the enduring of vnſpeakable afflictions. But now, when theſe things are in motion, all the poore good actions of my life, are vtterly forgotten by me; and then, it is only repreſented to my minde, how wicked I am; and that, without anie diſcourſe at all, of my vnderſtanding; ſo that euen this alſo, doth ſeem, at certaine times, to haue ſomewhat of the Supernaturall in it.</p>
            <p>Sometimes, there come alſo vpon me, ſo ear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſt, and euen eager appetites, of receauing the Bleſſed Sacrament, that I know not, whether it can be poſſible for me, to expreſſe them to the full. It hapned to me one morning, that it rayned ſo extreamly, as to ſeem no way fitt for me, to goe out of doores. But yet, being once gotten abroad, I was already growne alſo, to be ſo farre out of my ſelf, through that deſire of Commu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nicating, that although they had ſet Lances, euen pointed, and held faſt againſt my verie Breaſt, me thought I could haue paſſed, euen through them all; and how much more then, through water. And as ſoone, as I ariued at Church, I was taken with a very great Rapt. For, me thought, the verie Heauen was open, and not by one ouerture only, as I had ſeen it, at other times; and I ſaw another alſo aboue that, vpon which I vnderſtood (by way of a certaine notice, which I am not able to expreſſe) the Diuinitie it ſelf to be, though yet I ſaw not the Diuinitie. And, me thought, it
<pb n="633" facs="tcp:100776:353"/>
was vpheld, by certaine Myſterious Beaſts; and I was conſidering, whether they were not thoſe of the Euangeliſts. But yet, I neither ſaw, how the Throne was ſeated, nor who was ſitting in it; but only a great multitude of Angells, about it; which ſeemed to me, of much more beautie, beyond compariſon, then thoſe others, which I had ſeen in Heauen, before. And I haue been thinking, whether they might not haue been Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>raphins, or Cherubins; for, they are very differ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ent, in point of glorie; and they ſeemed, to be mightily inflamed. And as for the glorie, which then I felt in my ſelf, it can neither be written, nor ſpoken; nor is anie one able, euen to thinke it, but ſuch as had been made partakers of it, by ſee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing it. But I vnderſtood, that abſolutly all that, which poſſibly can be deſired, was there; and that, all togeather. I there, ſaw nothing at all, diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinctly; but they told me (yet I know not, euen who they were) that the thing, which I might there be able to doe, was, to vnderſtand, that I could vnderſtand nothing; but that I might ſee from thence, the direct Nothingnes of all things, in compariſon of that. And really, it is very true, that my Soule, from that time forward, hath found it ſelf, as if it were extreamly affronted, and confounded, to obſerue, that it was able to pauſe at all, vpon anie thing created; and how much more then, to be affected, either by it, or to it. For, all things ſeem to me, euer ſince, to be neither better, nor more, then the verie neſt of an
<pb n="634" facs="tcp:100776:354"/>
Ant. But I Communicated; and was at Maſſe; though yet I knew not, how I could be ſo. I conceiued, that the time had been very ſhort; and wondered, when the Clock ſtruck; and ſo found, that it was two howers, wherein I had re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mained, in Rapt, and glorie.</p>
            <p>I was amazed after this, to know, how, by ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proaching ſo neer to this Fire, which ſeemed to come from aboue, out of the true loue of Al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mightie God, it was yet, in no power of mine at all, to get the leaſt ſparke thereof, but only, when his Diuine Maieſtie was pleaſed to impart it. For, how much ſoeuer I deſire it, and how earneſtly ſoeuer I procure it, and would defeate, and euen deſtroy my ſelf for it, there is yet no meanes at all, to obtaine it. But now, this Rapt of mine, ſeemes euen to haue conſumed the faults, and lukewarmneſſe, and miſeries of the old man, as the Phenix is ſayd to doe her ſelf, out of whoſe aſhes, when ſhe is burnt, ſprings another Phenix. For iuſt ſo, doth a Soule become abſolutly an o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther kind of thing, with deſires wholy different, and with a courage ſo encreaſed, that now ſhe ſeemes not, to be, what ſhe was before; but now beginnes to walke, with a new kind of puritie, in the way of our Lord. And I iuſt then beſeech<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing his Diuine Maieſtie, that it might proue to be ſo, in my caſe, and that I might now, at leaſt, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginne, as vpon a new account, to doe him ſeruice, he ſpake theſe words to me: <hi>Thou haſt made a good Compariſon; and ſee, that thou forget it not; that ſo,
<pb n="635" facs="tcp:100776:354"/>
thou maiſt euer procure to improue thy ſelf.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>And being once, in the ſelf-ſame doubt, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of I ſpake euen now, whether theſe Viſions were of God, or no, our Lord appeared, and ſpake theſe words, to me, with ſome rigour: <hi>Hovv long, O yee Sonnes of men, vvill yee continue to be hard of hart?</hi> And he alſo willed me then, to examine my ſelf well, vpon this one Interrogatorie: <hi>VVhe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther I vvere entirely giuen to him, for his, or no; and that if I vvere giuen ſo, and vvas ſo, I should beleiue, that he vvould not ſuffer me to be loſt.</hi> And whereas I af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flicted my ſelf much, vpon his vttering that ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clamation aforeſayd, he returned with great ten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dernes, and Regalo, and told me, that he would not haue me afflict my ſelf; and that he knew al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ready, that I, for my part, would not faile, to ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ply my ſelf wholy to that, which might be for his Seruice; and that ſo, he would alſo doe all that, which I deſired of him, againſt Illuſions; and ſo he was pleaſed to doe that thing in particular, which then I humbly begged, at his hands. For he willed me, to looke in, vpon the Loue, which went encreaſing daily, in me; for, thereby, I might beſt vnderſtand, that the Diuel had no part in it; and that I muſt not thinke, Almightie God would conſent, that the Diuel ſhould haue ſo much power ouer the Soules of his Seruants, as to be able to giue me ſuch a claritie of vnder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtanding, togeather with ſuch a depth of repoſe of minde, as I poſſeſſed. And he gaue me alſo further to vnderſtand, that ſuch, and ſo manie men,
<pb n="636" facs="tcp:100776:355"/>
hauing told me, that theſe Viſitations were of Almightie God, I ſhould doe ill, if I did not be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leiue them.</p>
            <p>Being alſo another time, in Prayer, vpon <hi>S. A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thanaſius's</hi> Creed, of <hi>Quicumque vult,</hi> &amp;c, I was giuen to vnderſtand the manner, how there was one onlie God, and three Perſons; and this, in ſo perſpicuous, and cleare a kind, that I was no leſſe comforted by it, then amazed at it. This alſo, did me very much good, towards the giuing me en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>creaſe of knowledge, concerning the greatnes of Almightie God, and of his wonders; and for all ſuch occaſions, alſo, as wherein I thinke of the Bleſſed Trinitie, or heare ſpeech thereof. And now, me thinkes, I conceaue, how all that Myſte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rie ſtands, very well; and it contents me much.</p>
            <p>One day, vpon the Aſſumption of our B. Ladie, the Queen of the Angells, our Lord was pleaſed to doe me the Fauour, in a certaine Rapt, that her riſing vp, into Heauen, was repreſented to me, to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>geather with the ſolemnitie, and ioy, of that Ce<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſtiall Court, wherewith ſhe was receiued; as alſo the place, which ſhe held. To tell, what kind of thing this was, I am no way able. The glorie, which euen my Spirit had, to ſee, that hers is ſo great, was euen extreame; and I remained with great effects, and improuements, by it, towards a wiſh, of vndergoing yet, greater afflictions, for the loue of our Lord. And ſo it alſo gaue me en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>creaſe of deſires, to ſerue our B. Ladie, ſince both her dignitie, and merit, was ſo great. And being
<pb n="637" facs="tcp:100776:355"/>
one day, in a Colledge <hi>of the Societie of</hi> IESVS, and the Brothers of that Houſe, being then in act of receauing the B. Sacrament, I ſaw a very rich Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nopie, ouer their heads; and this, at two ſeuerall times; but yet, when others Communicated there, I ſaw it not.</p>

            </argument>
            <p>BEing once in Prayer, the delight, and guſt, which I felt within my ſelf, was ſo great, and I found my ſelf ſo vnworthie of ſo high a Fauour, that I beganne, vpon that occaſion, to conſider, how much better I had deſerued to poſſeſſe that place in Hell, which was prepared for me; for I could neuer forget, in what manner I had ſeen my ſelf there. And now, by meanes of this conſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deration, my Soule beganne to be ſo much more inflamed, that my Spirit grew to be in Rapt; and ſo, as that I know not, how to expreſſe it. For, me thought, I was put, and plunged, into that Maieſtie, which I had formerly vnderſtood; but yet ſo, as that I know not, how to declare it. In
<pb n="638" facs="tcp:100776:356"/>
this Maieſtie, a certaine Truth was giuen me to be vnderſtood, which indeed, is the accompliſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of all Truth; but yet ſtill, I know not how to relate it. For, I ſaw nothing at all diſtinctly; but they told me theſe words, though yet I ſaw not, who ſpake them; only I knew, that it was the verie Truth; <hi>This, vvhich I doe for thee, is no ſmall mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter; but rather, it is a thing, for vvhich thou ovveſt me much; becauſe one of the mischeifs, vvhich grovves to the vvorld, proceeds from not knovving the Truths of Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, vvith cleare truth; but, one tittle thereof, shall not faile.</hi> Now, as for me, I conceaued, that my ſelf had alwaies beleiued this; yea and that all Catho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liques, had alſo beleiued it. But then, he ſayd to me againe: <hi>Alas, my Daughter, there be fevv, vvho loue me, according to Truth; for, if they did, I vvould not conceale my ſecrets, from them. But, doſt thou knovv, vvhat it is, to loue me, according to Truth? It is, to knovv, that all is a Lye, vvhich is not acceptable to me. Thou shalt be able, to ſee this clearly (vvhich novv thou doſt not vnderſtand) by the profit, vvhich thy Soule shall get.</hi> And ſo accordingly, I haue ſeen it performed; our Lord be euer praiſed, for it. For, all things, which are not addreſſed to the ſeruice of Almightie God, doe, of late, ſeem to me, ſo hugely to be vanitie, and a lye, that I am no way able to ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſe, how much I vnderſtand thereof. And it moues me to deep compaſſion, to ſee men liue, in ſo great obſcuritie, and ignorance, as they are in, of thy Truth; but, by this meanes, I haue benefited my ſelf, in manie kindes, whereof I will
<pb n="639" facs="tcp:100776:356"/>
heer relate ſome; and ſome I ſhall not be able to relate.</p>
            <p>But our Lord ſayd one word to me heer, in particular, with very great fauour; though I know not alſo, how this was. For I ſaw nothing; but I remained in ſuch ſort, after it, as I know not alſo, how to declare, euen that. Only I am ſure, I re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mained, by this meanes, with a very great kind of fortitude, and firme purpoſe, of accompliſhing euen the leaſt part of Holie Scripture, with the vttermoſt of all my power. And nothing, me thinkes, could offer it ſelf to me, through which I would not paſſe, for the making this good.</p>
            <p>There remained alſo a truth, of this Diuine Truth, which was now repreſented to me (though yet ſtill, I know not how) ſo deeply engrauen in my hart, that it made me carrie a new kind of profound reuerence to Almightie God. For it im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parts a notice of his high Maieſtie, and great Power, after ſuch a manner, as cannot be deſcrib<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed; but I can only vnderſtand, that it is a migh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie kind of thing. I now remained alſo, with a very great deſire, neuer to ſpeake at all, but of things, which were ſubſtantially true; and which might iuſtly take precedence of all that, which vſes to be treated of, in this world. And ſo I then began, to find it paine enough, euen to liue in it. This Viſion left me with a Regalo of great tender<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nes; and with humilitie alſo. It ſeemed to me, that our Bleſſed Lord did giue me to vnderſtand much, in this viſion, though yet, without my
<pb n="640" facs="tcp:100776:357"/>
vnderſtanding the manner of it; but, at leaſt, I was ſatisfyed well enough, that it was no Illuſion. I ſaw nothing; but yet I vnderſtood the great be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nefit, which there is, in not making account of anie thing, which brings vs not neerer to Almigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie God; and ſo I came to vnderſtand, what kind of thing it is, for a Soule, to walke in Truth, in the preſence of the ſame Truth. That, which I vnderſtood, is, that our Lord gaue me to vnder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtand, That he is verie Truth it ſelf. And all theſe things, at which I haue now pointed heer, I vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtood ſometimes, by their being ſpoken to me; and at other times, without ſpeech; but yet, ſome of this latter ſort, with more clearnes, then thoſe others, which were imparted to me, by words. I vnderſtood very great truths, of this Truth; and better, then if manie learned men had taught me; and at leaſt, it ſeemes to me, that they could, by no meanes, haue ſo imprinted them, in my minde, nor ſo clearly haue giuen me to vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtand the vanitie of this world. This Truth, which, I ſay, was giuen me to be vnderſtood, is verie Truth, in it ſelf; and it is both without be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginning, and without end; and all other Truths, depend vpon this Truth; and all other Loues, vp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on this Loue; and all other Greatneſſes, vpon this Greatnes; though yet, all this be deliuered by me, with much obſcuritie, in compariſon of that clearnes, wherewith our Bleſſed Lord was plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed to impart it. And, how very well doth this become the great power of that Maieſtie, to leaue
<pb n="641" facs="tcp:100776:357"/>
ſuch things as theſe, imprinted vpon the Soule, whereby ſuch aduantages are obtained? and that, in ſo ſhort a time? O Greatnes, and Maieſtie of my Omnipotent Lord! What is it, which thou art doing? Conſider who it is, to whome thou art vouchſafing ſuch Soueraigne Fauours? Doſt thou not remember, how this Soule hath been a verie Abyſſe of Lyes, and euen a deep Sea of va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nities? and all this, through faults of mine owne? For, notwithſtanding that thou gaueſt me an in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clination, which, naturally, did abhorre lying, yet I made my ſelf apt to treat, in manie things, after a deceiptfull kind of manner. How art thou able, O my God, euen to endure me? and how can ſo great goodnes of thine, be ſhewed to one, who hath ſo ill deſerued it? and how can ſo much Sinne againſt thee, be compatible with ſuch Fauours, as theſe?</p>
            <p>Being once reciting the Howers of the Diuine Office, with all the reſt of the Religious, my Soule beganne to be ſuddainly recollected; and it ſeemed to me, that it was like ſome cleare, and pure Looking-Glaſſe, without hauing anie thing, either on the back, or on the ſides; or yet, either aboue, or below, which was not all, extreamly cleare. And in the very Center thereof, Chriſt our Lord was repreſented to me, iuſt ſo, as I am accuſtomed to ſee him. It ſeemed to me, that I ſaw him clearly, in all the parts, and portions of my Soule, as in a Looking-Glaſſe; and ſo alſo (though I know not how) our Bleſſed Lord him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf,
<pb n="642" facs="tcp:100776:358"/>
was engrauen therein, with ſuch a certaine kind of enamoured communion, or communi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cation of himſelf, as I cannot poſſibly expreſſe. Only I know, that this Viſion hath been of very great benefit to me; and is ſo, whenſoeuer I re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>member it; and eſpecially, after I receaue the B. Sacrament. But it was giuen me heerby to vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtand, that the being of a Soule in Mortall Sinne, is to make this Glaſſe be couered, with a great Clowde, and ſo, to become very darke; and that ſo, though our Bleſſed Lord be euer pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent with vs (yea ſo very preſent, as that he giues vs our verie Being, thereby) yet then, he is not ſo repreſented, as to be ſeen by vs; And that, when the Caſe concernes Heretiques, the Looking-Glaſſe is directly broken, which is farre worſe, then to be obſcured. But now, there is a very great deale of difference, between my ſeeing it, and my relat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing it; for it is no eaſie thing, to giue it well to be vnderſtood. Yet this hath done me a great deale of good, and hath affected me with much pittie, and greif, for thoſe times, wherein my ſelf did obſcure my Soule, in ſuch ſort, as that I was not able to behold, and ſee this Bleſſed Lord of mine. It ſeemes alſo to me, that this kind of Viſion, is very vſefull to perſons, who are of much recol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lection, to teach them a way of thinking of our Bleſſed Lord, as in the moſt interiour part of their Soules; which is a conſideration, that will ſtick cloſeſt to then, and will be of much more bene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fit, then if they were conſidered; as anie way our
<pb n="643" facs="tcp:100776:358"/>
of the Soule, according to what I haue ſayd els where; and it is contained alſo in ſome Bookes, which are written of Prayer, about the way, how wee are to ſeeke Almighty God. In particular, the Glorious S. Auguſtin ſpeakes much, of, how Al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mightie God is not to be ſought, either in plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſures, or externall places; and that he could be no way found ſo well, as in our ſelues; and this is certainly the beſt way; nor haue we need, to goe further off, then to our verie ſelues; and much leſſe, to clime-vp as high as Heauen, for this pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe; for, this will but diſtract the Soule, and wea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rie the Spirit; and doe vs nothing neer, ſo much good.</p>
            <p>I will alſo giue an aduertiſment heer, to the end, that if anie bodie haue anie ſuch thing, as that, he may know the better, how to carrie him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf. It happens in ſome very great Rapts, (when the time is paſt, wherein the Soule remaines in Vnion; and when all the Faculties, and Powers thereof, are abſorpt; and which laſts, as I haue ſayd, but a little while) that the Soule remaines recollected, and is not able, in the exteriour way, to returne to it ſelf; but thoſe two Powers, and Faculties, namely the Vnderſtanding, and Memo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rie, remaine, as with a kind of frenſie, in great diſorder. This, I ſay, happens ſometimes; and eſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pecially, with Beginners. And I haue been think<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, whether it may not proceed, from this, That our condition is naturally very weake, and not able to admit, and endure ſo great a ſtrength
<pb n="644" facs="tcp:100776:359"/>
of Spirit, and that the Imagination is weakned alſo much; and I know, that this happens to ſome. Now, for my part, I am apt to thinke, that it were not ill, to oblige them, in ſuch caſes as this, to leaue-off their Prayer, for that time, and to goe recouering that, afterward, which they looſe then; that ſo, all come not on togeather; for it may chance proue an occaſion of much inconueni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence. And of this, we haue experience; and that it will fall out, to be of better proofe, to conſider very well, how much our ſtate of health, and ſtrength, is able to endure. But in all things, there will be need of good experience, and of a good Directour; for, when once the Soule is growne to be in theſe tearmes, manie things will come to offer themſelues, wherein there will be need enough of ſome bodie, with whome it may be fitt, to conſider them. And if anie ſuch man can not be found, when he is ſought, our Bleſſed Lord himſelfe, will not be wanting to him, ſince he would not be wanting to me, I being the wic<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ked Creature, I am. For I beleiue, there are very few, who are come to haue experience of ſo ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nie things; and if there be not experience, it is in vaine to thinke of anie remedie, which will not rather ſerue to diſquiet, and afflict the Soule. But the beſt is, that our Bleſſed Lord will take euen that trouble of ours, in account, for ſome ſatisfaction of himſelf; and therefore it will fall<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out, to be better done, to conferr thereof, as I haue formerly ſayd; and ſo will it alſo be, to pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceed,
<pb n="645" facs="tcp:100776:359"/>
after this manner, in all thoſe things, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of I am ſpeaking, now. For I ſee, that this imports very much, (eſpecially if they be woemen, who are concerned) and that they doe it, with their Ghoſtlie Father; and that he alſo be ſuch, as is fitt. At leaſt, there vſe to be more woemen, then men, to whome our Lord imparts theſe Fauours; and this I vnderſtood firſt, from the holie man, <hi>Fray Pedro de Alcantara;</hi> and I haue alſo ſeen my ſelf, that they proceeded, and profited more, in this way of Spirit, then men doe. But he gaue excellent reaſons, for his opinion, which need not be inſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted heer; for they all, are in fauour of woemen.</p>
            <p>Being, one day, in Prayer, there was ſuddainly repreſented to me (but it was without my ſeeing anie thing formed; and yet it was with a very ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>traordinarie kind of claritie) how all things, are ſeen, in Almightie God; and how he hath them all, in himſelf. To know, how to ſet this downe, is in no power of mine; but it remained deeply imprinted in my Soule; and it was one of the greateſt Fauours, that euer had been done me, by our Bleſſed Lord; yea and of thoſe alſo, which put me to greateſt confuſion, &amp; ſhame, when I conſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dered the manie ſinnes, which I had committed againſt him. I well beleiue, that, if our Bleſſed Lord had been pleaſed, to let me ſee this Viſion, at ſome other time of my life; or if they could ſee him now, who are ſinning againſt him, they would neuer haue the hart, and courage, to doe, as they doe. It appeared to me, as I ſayd; but yet
<pb n="646" facs="tcp:100776:360"/>
ſo, as that I cannot expreſly affirme, that I ſaw anie thing diſtinctly; but yet ſomewhat, me thinkes, muſt needs haue been ſeen by me, ſince I am able to make this verie compariſon; but that it fell out, to be ſignifyed, by ſo delicate, and ſubtile a way, as that the vnderſtanding is not able to reach it; or els, that I haue no skill of all thoſe kinds of Viſions, which ſeem not to be Imaginarie; but yet, in ſome of theſe, I verily thinke, that perhaps there may be ſomewhat of the Imaginarie, or formed apparance, and that only the Powers of the Soule, being then in Rapt, they are not able afterward, to aſſigne anie Forme, in what manner our Lord repreſents himſelf to them there; and how he is pleaſed, that they ſhall enioy him. But yet, ſuppoſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing it to be the Diuinitie, in the forme of ſome bright Diamond, which were bigger, then the whole world; or els, of ſome Looking-Glaſſe, after the manner of what I ſayd before, concer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning the Soule, in that other Viſion, (ſaue that this is in ſo ſuperiour a kind of manner, that I am not able to expreſſe it) and that all that, which we doe, is ſeen in this Diamond (it being ſuch, as that all things are ſhut-vp in it, becauſe there is nothing, which can get out of that greatnes) it was a thing extreamly to amaze me, to be able to ſee, in ſo very ſhort a time, ſo manie things to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>geather, in this bright Diamond. And ſo was it alſo matter of extreame compaſſion, and greif, for me (euerie time, that I remember my ſelf) to haue ſeen, that things, ſo very vglie, and fowle, as my
<pb n="647" facs="tcp:100776:360"/>
ſinnes were, ſhould be repreſentted, and ſhewed, in that ſo clearnes of light. And the truth is, that whenſoeuer I remember it, I know not, how it comes to be poſſible for me, to endure it; and I did really then remaine, ſo extreamly out of countenance, and aſhamed, that, me thinkes, I could not tell, where to hide my head.</p>
            <p>O <note n="*" place="margin">Great effects of a Viſion.</note> that ſome Creature, or other, were able to giue this Truth to be well vnderſtood, by theſe people, who commit diſhoneſt filthie ſinnes; that ſo they might come to know, that they are not ſecret; and that Almightie God, hath reaſon to be very ſenſible of thoſe wrongs, ſince they are acted ſo truly, in the preſence of his Diuine Maieſtie; and that we carrie our ſelues, with ſo baſe irre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uerence, before him.</p>
            <p>I ſaw heer alſo, how iuſtly Hell is deſerued, for anie one Mortall Sinne; becauſe it is paſt our power, to vnderſtand, what a moſt greiuous crime it is, to commit it, in the preſence of ſo great a Maieſtie; and what an vnſpeakable diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance, and diſſimilitude, is found, between that, which he is, and that, which our Sinnes are; and how it appeares euen heerby, ſo much the better, how great his mercie is, ſince, notwithſtanding he knowes all this, he yet endures vs.</p>
            <p>It hath alſo made me conſider, that if ſuch a Viſion, as this, can leaue the Soule ſo extreamly aſtoniſhed, and amazed, what kind of thing, will the Day of Iudgement proue to be, when this Maieſtie of Almightie God, will ſhew it ſelf, with
<pb n="648" facs="tcp:100776:361"/>
all clearnes; and ſo we ſhall alſo clearly ſee, what kind of things, our ſinnes were, which we com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitted againſt him. O my deare God! what blind<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nes is this, which hath ſeazed me? And I haue often been amazed, euen whilſt I haue been writ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing this; and your Reuerence need be amazed at nothing, but how I am able euen to liue, whilſt I am looking both vpon theſe things, and my ſelf. But let him be eternally bleſſed, who hath vouch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſafed to endure ſuch things, at my hands.</p>
            <p>Being once in Prayer, in very great recollec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, and with much quietnes, and ſweetnes, me thought I was all emcompaſſed with Angells, and very neer to Almightie God; and I beganne to be an humble Suiter to his Diuine Maieſtie, for the benefit, and aduantage of his Church. And he gaue me to vnderſtand, the much good, which a certaine Order ſhould doe the world, in theſe latter times; and the great courage, wherewith the Members thereof, ſhould defend, and vphold the Catholique Faith.</p>
            <p>Being once in Prayer, neer the Bleſſed Sacra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, there appeared to me a certaine Saint, whoſe Order was in ſome decay. He had a great Booke in his hands, which he opened, and willed me to read certains Letters in it, which were very legible, and large; and they ſayd thus: <hi>In fu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture times, this Order shall flourish, and haue manie Martyrs.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Another time, being at Matins in the Quire, ſix or ſeauen perſons were repreſented, and ſet
<pb n="649" facs="tcp:100776:361"/>
before me; and I held them to be of the ſame Or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der, and they had Swords in their hands. And I conceaue, that I was giuen thereby to vnder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtand, that they ſhould defend the Faith. For, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing in Prayer, another time, and rapt in Spirit, me thought, I was in a very ſpauous feild, where manie were, who fought; and they of this Order, did alſo fight, with great feruour. They had their faces beautifull, and much inflamed; and they beate multitudes of men, downe to the ground, and killed others. This battaile ſeemed to be gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uen againſt Heretiques; &amp; I haue ſeen this Glori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous Saint, diuerſe times; and he hath told me ſome things, and giuen me thankes, for the Prayers, which I make for his Order; and he hath promi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed, that he will recommend me to our Bleſſed Lord. I ſpecifye not the ſeuerall Orders heer, leaſt ſome ſhould be offended at it; and if our Lord ſhall thinke it conuenient, he may declare them. But euerie Order ſhould procure, and ſo ſhould euerie particular man of euerie Order, that, in ſo great a neceſſitie, as that, wherein the Church is, at this time, they might be able to ſerue her. For, happie are thoſe liues, which may come to looſe themſelues, vpon this occaſion.</p>
            <p>A certaine perſon deſired me once, to beg of Almightie God, that I might vnderſtand, whether or no, it would be for the Seruice of his Diuine Maieſtie, that he ſhould take a Biſhoprick. I did ſo; and our Lord made me this anſwer, after I had Communicated: <hi>VVhen he shall vnderſtand, vvith
<pb n="650" facs="tcp:100776:362"/>
all clearnes, and truth, that true Dominion conſiſts, in poſſeſsing nothing, he may take it, then.</hi> Giuing thereby to vnderſtand, that, whoſoeuer is to be a Prelate, muſt be very farre, from ſo much as deſiring it; and yet further, from procuring it.</p>
            <p>Theſe Fauours, and manie other alſo, haue been, and are ſtill, very ordinarily ſhewed, by our Bleſſed Lord, to this ſinnefull Woeman; which, me thinkes, are not very neceſarie, to be related; ſince by thoſe, which are deliuered already, my Soule, togeather with the Spirit, which our Lord hath giuen me, may be vnderſtood. But let him be euer bleſſed, who hath had ſo much care of me.</p>
            <p>He told me once, by way of comforting me, that I muſt not afflict my ſelf (and this he did, with moſt tender loue) for that, in this life of ours, we could not poſſibly, be alwaies after the ſame manner; but that ſometimes, I would be in feruour; and ſometimes, without it; Sometimes, with vnquietnes, and temptations; and Some<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times, without them, and in peace; but that I muſt hope in him, and feare nothing.</p>
            <p>Being one day in thought, and doubt, whether it were not a kind of being tyed to Creatures, to be glad to be with ſuch perſons, as with whome I treat the buſines of my Soule; and to loue both them, and others alſo, whome I find to be the Seruants of Almightie God; and to receaue com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fort, by being with them; he told me, that, if when a man is dangerouſly ſick, the preſence of
<pb n="651" facs="tcp:100776:362"/>
a Phiſitian, ſeemes euen to reſtore him to health, it would not be a vertue, to forbeare to be glad of him, and to loue him. And what (ſayd he) wouldſt thou haue done, if it had not been, for ſuch, as they? That he diſliked not, that conuerſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion ſhould be held with ſuch, as were good, but that my words muſt euer be well conſidered, and holie; and that ſo, it would be rather profitable to me, then hurtfull, not to giue-ouer communica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion with them. Now, this imparted a particular comfort, to me; for ſometimes, it would ſeem, to be a hauing too great a tye, vpon creatures, which made me once incline, to giue-ouer the cuſtome I had, to conuerſe with them. But our Lord did euer counſaile me, in all things; yea ſo farre, as euen to tell me, how I ſhould carrie my ſelf, towards weake perſons; and ſome others alſo; and he neuer layes the care of me, aſide, But I am much troubled, to find, that I am good for ſo little, in his Seruice; as alſo, that I can doe the leſſe, through my ſpending more time, then I wi<gap reason="illegible: blotted" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>h, vpon ſo weake, and waſted a bodie, as mine is.</p>
            <p>As I was once in Prayer, and the hower of our going to reſt, came on, I found my ſelf, in a great deale of paine; and knowing, that my ordinarie Vomits would ariue; and obſerueing my ſelf to be ſo tyed-vp, to theſe cares; and the Spirit, on the other ſide, deſiting to haue ſome time, for it ſelf, I grew to be euen ſo tired, that I beganne to be greatly afflicted, and to weepe much; and that
<pb n="652" facs="tcp:100776:363"/>
happens very often to me. And this condition puts me to ſuch a kind of anger, that, me thinkes, I doe, in thoſe times, euen abhorre my ſelf; though yet it be true withall, that I doe not abhorre my ſelf indeed; nor yet am wanting, in what is neceſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſarie for me; and I rather pray God, that I take not more care of my ſelf, then I ſhould; and ſo, I feare, I doe. But now, whilſt I was in this greif, our Lord appeared to me, and regaled me very much; and told me, that I muſt endure theſe troubles, and goe-through with them, for loue of him; and <hi>That my Life, vvas neceſſarie, yet;</hi> And ſo, me thinkes, I neuer ſee my ſelf in anie very great paine, which I value, ſince I reſolued to ſerue this Lord, and Comforter of mine, with all my power. For, though he permitted me to ſuffer a little, yet would he ſtill be aſſiſting me ſo with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>all, that I eſteem not my ſelfe to doe much, in deſiring to ſuffer afflictions, for his ſake. So that now, me thinkes, there is no reaſon, why we ſhould euen deſire, ſo much as to liue, but only, to the end that we might ſuffer; and accordingly, this is the thing, which I begg, with moſt affec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, of Almightie God. And ſometimes, I am ſay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to him, with my whole hart: <hi>O Lord, let me ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther ſuffer, or dye; for I begg no other thing of thee, for my ſelf.</hi> And now it vſes to comfort me, to heare the Clock ſtrike; for ſo, me thinkes, I am growne, a little neerer, to the ſeeing of God (though it be but a little) becauſe one hower more of my life, is paſt. At other times, I find my ſelf in ſuch ſort,
<pb n="653" facs="tcp:100776:363"/>
that I neither take much pleaſure, in liuing; nor yet, me thinkes, haue anie great minde, to dye; and ſo, in the meane time, I remaine with a kind of ſtupiditie, and darknes of minde, in all things; and, manie times, I alſo haue ſome troubles. And ſince our Lord was pleaſed, that thoſe Fauours ſhould be publiquely knowne, which his Diuine Maieſtie vouchſafed to ſhew me (as he himſelf had told me, ſome yeares agoe, that they ſhould be; which gaue me vexation enough; and it is not a little, that I haue endured therein, as your Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uerence knowes; for euerie bodie, will vnder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtand things, as he liſtes) I comfort my ſelf yet, with this, that it hath not ariued by my fault; be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe I neuer ſpake of anie ſuch thing, but either to my Ghoſtlie Fathers, or others, who I knew euen by them, had vnderſtood thereof. For of this, I was very warie, euen to extremitie; though yet perhaps, I abſtained not, ſo much, for reſpect of humilitie, as in regard, that I had paine enough, to tell euen my Ghoſtlie Father thereof; and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore, how much leſſe would I impart things of this nature, to others.</p>
            <p>But now, I earneſtly deſire, that Almightie God may receaue glorie by it; howſoeuer there be ſome, who murmure at me, very much, vpon this occaſion; though euen yet, I thinke, they may peraduenture doe it with good zeale. And there are others, who are afrayd, euen to treat with me, in anie kind; yea and euen to receaue the Confeſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion of my Sinnes; and others, ſay alſo other
<pb n="654" facs="tcp:100776:364"/>
things. But how ſoeuer, ſince I vnderſtand, that it hath pleaſed our Bleſſed Lord, to reduce manie Soules, by this meanes; and becauſe I ſee clearly, and remember continually, how much, himſelf would be pleaſed to endure, for the gaining of one Soule, I allow my ſelf to take little trouble for anie thing, which men can ſay of me. And I know not, whether or no, this may not haue been a part of the cauſe, why his Diuine Maieſtie hath placed me, in this little Corner of the world, where I am ſo ſhut vp; and where I thought, there would be no more memorie of me, then of a thing, which was dead. But their forgerfulnes, was not ſo great, as I wiſhed; and ſo I haue been conſtrained, to ſpeake ſometimes, with ſome per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons. Yet howſoeuer. I am not now, where the world may eaſily, ſee me; for it ſeemes, that our Lord hath been pleaſed, to driue me from Sea, to this Port; and I truſt; in his Diuine Maieſtie, that it will proue a very ſafe one, for me. And ſince now I am out of the world, and find my ſelf, in the companie of few (but they, holie Creatures) I looke downe, vpon the world, as from a place, which is very high; and ſo, it is growne to be of little moment with me, what they, below, doe ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther ſay, or thinke. And I would make much more account, to vnderſtand, that anie one Soule ſhould haue profited to the weight of one little graine, in God's Seruice, by my meanes, then of all, which can be ſayd of me, in anie kind. For, ſince I haue found my ſelf, in this place, our Lord
<pb n="655" facs="tcp:100776:364"/>
hath been gratiouſly pleaſed, that all the deſires of my hart, might haue no other ayme, but this. And he hath alſo giuen me, euen a kind of ſleep, in this life, which makes me find, that whatſoeuer I ſee, is but dreaming; nor am I able to ſay, that I reape, either much contentment, or trouble, by anie thing of this world. And if yet ſome things giue me anie, it paſſes away, with ſo very great ſpeed, that I euen wonder at it; and it makes but iuſt, ſuch a kind of impreſſion vpon me, as a thing would doe, whereof I had dreamt. And it is a moſt perfect truth, that although I ſhould after<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward haue a peice of a minde, either to be glad of anie contentment, or to be ſorrie for anie miſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>accident, and trouble, it is really no more now, in my power, but iuſt ſo, as anie man, who were diſcreet, would take, either trouble, or ioy, from a dreame of his owne. For now, our Bleſſed Lord hath already been pleaſed, to awake, and open the eyes of my Soule, from out of that follie, wherein it was. And whereas, by my not being mortifyed, nor dead, to the things of this world, I was wont to haue much feeling of ſuch things, as hapned, his Diuine Maieſtie is pleaſed now, that I ſhould looſe my true ſight, no more.</p>
            <p>In this ſort, Sir, doe I liue now; and I beſeech your Reuerence, my good Father, to begg of Al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mightie God, that he will either take me quickly to himſelf; or els I beſeech his Diuine Maieſtie, that he giue me power to ſerue him. In the meane time, I humbly beſeech Almighty God, that what
<pb n="656" facs="tcp:100776:365"/>
I haue written heer, may be of ſome vſe, to your Reuerence; and I haue not done it, without ſome trouble, in regard of the little conueniences, which I had. But happie ſhall this trouble be, if I haue chanced, to hit anie thing, right; and if our Bleſſed Lord may receaue ſome one only Act of praiſe, by occaſion thereof, I ſhall eſteem my ſelf to be fully payd, though your Reuerence ſhould burne it all, immediatly after. And yet I could not wiſh, that this ſhould happen, till thoſe three perſons had ſeen it, of whome you know; ſince they are, and haue been, my Ghoſtlie Fathers. For, if the thing be not right, it will be fitt, that they giue-ouer the good opinion, which they haue of me; and if, on the other ſide, things goe well, I know, that they are good, and learned men; and they can not be ignorant, from whence it comes; and they will giue him glorie, and praiſe, who hath done it, though he haue ſerued himſelf of me, therein. I beſeech his Diuine Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ieſtie, that he will euer keepe your Reuerence, in his holie hand, and make you ſo great a Saint, as that you may, with Spirit, and Light, illuminate this miſerable Creature, who hath ſo little of the humble, in her, and ſo much of the bold, as that ſhe hath preſumed to write of theſe high things. I beſeech our Lord, that I haue not erred therein, whilſt my ayme, and deſire was, to hitt right, and to obey; and that, in fine, there might be ſomewhat, for which our Lord ſhould be praiſed.

            <p>THe Holie-Ghoſt be alwaies with your Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uerence, Amen. It would not be amiſſe, euen almoſt to exaggerate the Seruice, which now I am doing to your Reuerence, that ſo you may, euen hold your ſelf, to be the more obliged, to take very particular, and great care, to recom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mend me to Almightie God. And this, I may well preſume to doe, ſince it hath coſt me ſo very deare, to ſee my ſelf thus, ſet downe in writing; and to haue brought, by occaſion thereof, ſo ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nie of my great miſeries, to my remembrance; though yet withall, I can affirine with much truth, that I haue had farre more auerſion, and trouble, vpon my declaring the Fauours, which it pleaſed our Bleſſed Lord to doe me, then it would haue been for me, to diſcouer, euen the offences themſelues, which I haue committed againſt his Diuine Maieſtie. But, in the meane time, I haue done, what your Reuerence hath commanded, in order to the enlarging my ſelf, in this Diſcourſe; though yet withall, it be vpon
<pb n="659" facs="tcp:100776:366"/>
condition, that your Reuerence will alſo doe, what you promiſed, in tearing whatſoeuer you ſhall not like. I had not finiſhed ſo much, as the verie reading it ouer, after I had written it, euen now, when your Reuerence ſent to me, for it; and therefore, it may very well chance, that ſome things are ill declared; and others, very vnneceſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſarily repeated; for, the time, wherein I was able to doe it, did proue ſo very ſtreight, and ſhort, that I could not ſo much, as looke ouer, what I had written. I beſeech your Reuere<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ce, to reforme my errours heerin; and to command it, to be coppied out, and ſent to <hi>Father Auila;</hi> for els, per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>haps, the hand may be knowne to others. But I deſire very much, that ſuch order may be taken, as that he may ſee it; ſince I partly beganne to write it, vpon that deſigne. For, when he ſhall once conceaue, that I goe in a way, which is right, I ſhall be very much comforted by it; and ſo, when I ſhall haue vſed this diligence, there will be, on my part, no more to be done. I humbly pray your Reuerence, to doe, in all things, as you ſhall thinke fitt; and conſider, that you are euen obliged, therein, for ſuch an one, as truſts her Soule in your hands, after ſo confident a manner. As for yours, I will be recommending it to our Bleſſed Lord, all the dayes of my life; and I be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeech you therefore, make great haſt to ſerue his Diuine Maieſtie, to the end, that you may be the better able, to doe me alſo fauour, with him; ſince your Reuerence will eaſily ſee (by that, which
