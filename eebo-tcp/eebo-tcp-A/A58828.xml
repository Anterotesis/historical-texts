            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

of <hi>Lerma</hi> and the <hi>Popes Nuntio,</hi> who were the Head and Feet of all the Aſſem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bly.
Theſe two ſtayed long away for divers reſpects: The <hi>Nuntio,</hi> that he

The Duke of <hi>Lerma</hi> to expreſs the Authority and Dignity of his own Perſon,
and to ſhew how a Servant put in place of his Maſter exacts more ſervice of
his Fellow-Servants than the Maſter himſelf.</p>
            <p>Theſe two ſtayed till all the reſt were weary of waiting, but at length the
<hi>Nuntio</hi> ſuppoſing all the Council ſat, launced forth and came to <hi>Roade</hi> in the
Council Chamber, where after mutual diſcharge of Duty from the Compa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny,
and bleſſing upon it from him, he ſate down in ſolemn ſilence, grieving
at his overſight, when he ſaw the Duke of <hi>Lerma</hi> abſent, with whom he
ſtrove as a Competitor for <hi>Pomp</hi> and <hi>Glory.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>The <hi>Duke</hi> had ſent before, and underſtood of the <hi>Nuntio</hi>'s being there, and
ſtayed ſomething the longer, That his boldneſs might be obſerved, wherein
he had his deſire; for the <hi>Nuntio</hi> having a while, patiently driven away the

out of breath; but the Duke of <hi>Villa Hermoſa</hi> (Preſident of the Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cil

upon the occaſion of the Duke of <hi>Lerma</hi> his abſence, and beckoned <hi>Seigniour
Gondamore</hi> to him, uſing this ſpeech in the hearing of the <hi>Nuntio,</hi> after a ſport<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
manner. <hi>How unhappy are the People, where you have been;</hi> firſt, <hi>for their
Souls, being Hereticks,</hi> then <hi>for their Eſtates, where the name of a Favourite is ſo fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miliar?
How happy is our Eſtate, where the Keys of Life and Death are ſo eaſily
come by</hi> (pointing at the <hi>NUNTIO) hanging at every Religious Girdle, and where
the door of Juſtice and Mercy ſtand equally open to all Men, without reſpest of Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons:</hi>
The Embaſſadour knew the <hi>Ironical</hi> ſtroak to be intended as a by-blow
to the <hi>Nuntio,</hi> but fully at the Duke of <hi>Lerma</hi> (whoſe greatneſs began now to
wax heavy towards Declenſion) and therefore he returned this Anſwer, <hi>Your
Excellency knoweth the State is happy, where</hi> wiſe Favourites <hi>govern Kings, if
the Kings themſelves be fooliſh, or if the wiſer Sort will not yet be govern'd by them,
The</hi> STATE <hi>of</hi> ENGLAND (<hi>howſoever you hear of it in</hi> Spain <hi>or</hi> Rome) <hi>is ſo
happy in the laſt kind, they need not care much what the Favourite be (though for the
moſt part, he be ſuch as prevents all Suſpition in that kind, being rather choſe as a
Scholar to be taught than a Tutor to teach) of this they are ſure no Prince exceeds
theirs in perſonal Abilities, ſo that nothing could be added to him in my wiſh, but this
one,</hi> He were our Vaſſayle and a Catholick.</p>
            <p>With that the noiſe without gave notice of the Duke of <hi>Lerma</hi> his entrance,

ſecret, neither need we refrain this Freedom of Speech from the <hi>Nuntio</hi> his Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſence;

ſo imploys them, that they are generally reputed, how remote ſoever they are from

much muſt be left in truſt to the Diſcretion, Judgment, and Diligence of

may be more Scope allowed them to deal in, as occaſion ſhall require; Breifly

I ſayled, to make profit of all Humours, and by all means to advance the
State of the <hi>Romiſh Faith,</hi> and <hi>Spaniſh Faction,</hi> together upon all advantages
of Oaths and the breach of them; for this is an old Obſervation and a true one,

Conquerors of the Old; and to this end, whereas His <hi>Excellency</hi> in his excellent
Diſcourſe ſeems to extend our outward Forces and private Aims, only againſt
<hi>Hereticks,</hi> and to reſtrain them with true Amity with theſe of the <hi>Romiſh Reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gion:</hi>
this I affirm that ſince there can be no ſecurity, but ſuch <hi>Princes</hi> though
now <hi>Romiſh Catholicks</hi> may turn Hereticks hereafter, my Aimes have ever been
to make profit of all, and to make my <hi>Mr. Maſter</hi> of all, who is a faithful and

Entercourſe of <hi>Letters,</hi> and <hi>Meſſengers;</hi> theſe only I will ſpeak of that I have
of late done, ſince the return of the <hi>Lord Roos</hi> from hence, and may ſeem moſt
directly to tend to thoſe ends formerly propounded by his <hi>Excellency</hi> that is,
the Advancement of the <hi>Spaniſh State,</hi> and <hi>Romiſh Religion</hi> together: Firſt it is well
obſerved by the Wiſedom of our <hi>State,</hi> that the <hi>King</hi> of <hi>England</hi> (who is other<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe
one of the moſt accompliſh'd <hi>Princes</hi> that ever Reigned) extreemly hunts
after Peace and ſo affects the true name of a Peace-maker, as that for it he will
do or ſuffer any thing, and withall they have beheld the general boun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty
and muniſicence of his Mind, and neceſſity of the <hi>State</hi> ſo exhauſted, as it is
unable to ſupply his deſires, who ſeeks to have that he may give to others, u<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pon
theſe advantages they have given out directions, and inſtructions both to
me and others, and I have obſerved them as far as I was able.</p>
               <p>And for this purpoſe, whereas there was a Marriage propounded betwixt
them and us; ((how ſoever I ſuppoſe our <hi>State</hi> too devout to deal with <hi>Hereticks</hi>
in this kind in earneſt) yet I made that a <hi>Cover</hi> for much <hi>Intelligence,</hi> and a <hi>means</hi>
to obtain what I deſired, whilſt the <hi>State</hi> of <hi>England</hi> longed after the Marriage,
hoping thereby (though vainly) to ſetle Peace, and fill the <hi>Exchecquer;</hi> Here the
<hi>Aroh-Biſhop</hi> of <hi>Toledo,</hi> Inquiſitor-General, ſtept up and interrupted <hi>Gondamore,</hi>

they ſhould endanger the <hi>Soul</hi> of the Young <hi>Lady,</hi> and the reſt of her Company
<pb n="7" facs="tcp:63475:6"/>

               </p>
               <p>To the firſt Objection the <hi>Popes N<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="3 letters">

                     </gap>io</hi> anſwered, that his <hi>Holineſs</hi> for the
Catholick <hi>Cauſe</hi> would diſpence with the Marriage; and urged theſe following
Reaſons. Firſt that there was <hi>Valuable Danger,</hi> in the hazarding of <hi>One</hi> for
the gaining of <hi>Many,</hi> perhaps of all. Secondly that it was no hazard ſince
<hi>Women</hi> (eſpecially <hi>Young Ones</hi>) are too obſtinate to be removed from their
<hi>Opinions,</hi> and abler to win <hi>Solomon</hi> to their <hi>Opinions,</hi> than <hi>Solomon</hi> to work
them to his Faith. Thirdly it was great advantage to match with ſuch, from
whom they might break at pleaſure, having the Catholick <hi>Cauſe</hi> for a Colour,
and beſides if need were, to be at liberty in all reſpects, ſince there was no
Faith to be kept with <hi>Hereticks;</hi> and if his <hi>Holineſs</hi> may diſpence with the
Murder of ſuch, and diſpoſe of their <hi>Crowns,</hi> as what good <hi>Catholick</hi> doubts but
he may; much more he may, and will he in their Marriages, to prevent the Lepro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſy-Seed
of <hi>Hereſy,</hi> and to ſetle <hi>Catholick-Blood</hi> in the <hi>Chair</hi> of <hi>State:</hi> to the ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cond
Objection the <hi>Embaſſador</hi> himſelf anſwered, ſaying, that though the
<hi>Engliſh</hi> generally loathed the Match, and would as he thought buy it off with
half their Eſtates, hating the <hi>Nation</hi> of <hi>Spain,</hi> and their <hi>Religion</hi> (as appears by
an uproar and aſſault a day or two before his Departure from <hi>London</hi> by the Ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prentices,
being greedy to vent their own Spleen, in doing him or any of his a miſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cheif)
yet two ſorts of People unmeaſureably deſired the Match might proceed.
Firſt, the begging and beggarly <hi>Courtiers</hi> that they might have to furniſh their
Wants. Secondly, The <hi>Romiſh Catholicks,</hi> who hoped thereby, at leaſt, for
a Moderation of <hi>Fines,</hi> and <hi>Laws,</hi> perhaps a <hi>Toleration;</hi> and perhaps a total
<hi>Reſtauration</hi> of their Religion in <hi>England;</hi> in which regard quoth he, I have
known ſome Zealous Perſons proteſt; that if all their Friends, and half their
Eſtates could procure the Service of our <hi>Lady;</hi> if ſhe came to be married with the
<hi>Prince</hi> they would uſe the means faithfully to <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

                  </gap>ight under her Colours when they
might ſafely do it, and if it came to <hi>Portion</hi> they would under-hand contribute
largly of their Eſtates to the <hi>Spaniſh Collector,</hi> and make up half the Portion of
themſelves, perhaps more: So by this Marriage it might be ſo wrought, that
the <hi>State</hi> ſhould be rather robb'd, and weakened (which is our Aim) than ſtreng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thened;
as the <hi>Engliſh</hi> vainly hope; beſides in a ſmall time they ſhould work
ſo far in the Body of the <hi>State</hi> by buying Offices and the like, either by <hi>Sea</hi> or
<hi>Land;</hi> of Juſtice <hi>Civil</hi> or <hi>Eccleſiaſtical,</hi> in <hi>Church or State,</hi> (all being for <hi>Money</hi>
expoſed to Sale) that with the Help of <hi>Jeſuites</hi> they would undermine with meer
wit, (without <hi>Gunpowder</hi>) and leave the King but a few <hi>Subjects,</hi> whoſe
Faith he might rely upon, while they were of a Faith adverſe to his: For what
<hi>Catholick-Body</hi> that is ſound at the Heart, can abide a Corrupt and Heretical
Head, or Ruler? With that the <hi>Duke Medina des Rio Setto Preſident</hi> of the <hi>Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cil</hi>
of <hi>War,</hi> and of the <hi>Council</hi> of <hi>State</hi> roſe up and ſaid, His <hi>Predeceſſors</hi> had felt
the Force and Wit of the <hi>Engliſh,</hi> in 88. and he had cauſe to doubt the <hi>Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tholicks</hi>
themſelves that were <hi>Engliſh,</hi> and fully <hi>Jeſuited,</hi> upon any Foreign
<hi>Nation,</hi> would rather take part with their own King, though an <hi>Heretick,</hi> than

Admiration, even to Aſtoniſhment, they have ſleighted, miſreported ſcorned, and
perverted to his diſgrace, and my rejoycing; magnifying in the mean time
our defect for grace.</p>
               <p>Here the <hi>Duke Pastrane, Preſident</hi> of the Counſel, for <hi>Italy;</hi> ſteps up and ſaid
he had lately read a Book of one <hi>Cambdens</hi> called his <hi>Annals;</hi> wherein writing of
a Treaty of a Marriage long ſince, between Engliſh <hi>Elizabeth,</hi> and the French
<hi>Duke</hi> of <hi>Andiou:</hi> He there obſerves, that the Marriage was not ſeriouſly intended
on either ſide, but Politickly pretended by both <hi>States</hi> counterchangeably, that
each might effect their own ends, there the <hi>Engliſh</hi> had the better; and I have ſome
cauſe to doubt, ſince they can diſſemble, as well as we; that they have their
Aimes under hand as well as we; and intend the <hi>Match</hi> as little as we do, and this
(quoth he) I believe the rather becauſe the King as he is wiſe to conſult and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſider;
ſo he is a conſtant Maſter of his word, and hath written, and given ſtrong
Reaſons againſt <hi>Matches</hi> made with Perſons of contrary Religion; which
Reaſons no other Man can anſwer: And therefore doubtleſs he will not go
from, nor counſel his Son to forſake thoſe Rules laid down ſo deliberately.</p>
               <p>Your <hi>Excellency</hi> miſtakes; (quoth the <hi>Embaſſador</hi>) the advantage was then
on the Side of the <hi>Engliſh,</hi> becauſe the French Men ſought the <hi>Match;</hi> now it
muſt be upon ours, becauſe the <hi>Engliſh</hi> ſeek it, who will grant any thing rather
than break off; and beſides, they have no Patience to temporiſe and diſem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble,
in this or any other Deſign, as the <hi>French</hi> long ſince have well obſerved;
for their neceſſities will give them neither time nor reſt, nor hope elſewhere
to be ſupplyed. As for their King, I cannot ſearch into his heart, I muſt be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve
others that preſume to know his mind, hear his words, and read his wri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tings,
and theſe relate what I have delivered: But for the reſt of the People, as
the number of thoſe, that are truly religious, are ever the leaſt for the moſt part
of leaſt account: ſo is it there, where if an equal Oppoſition be made betwixt
their truly <hi>Religious</hi> and <hi>Ours,</hi> the remainder will be the greateſt number and
will ſtand indifferent, and fall to the greateſt Side, where there is moſt hope of
Gain, and Glory: for thoſe two are the Gods of the <hi>Magnitude,</hi> and of the
<hi>Multitude:</hi> Now theſe ſee apparently no certain Supplies for their wants,
but from us.</p>
               <p>Yes, quoth the <hi>Duke,</hi> for even now you ſaid the <hi>General-State</hi> loathing the
<hi>Match,</hi> would redeem the fear thereof, with half their Eſtates: It is there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
but calling a <hi>Parliament,</hi> and the Buſineſs were ſoon effected. A <hi>Parlia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment</hi>
(quoth the <hi>Embaſſador</hi>) nay, therein lies one of the <hi>Principle-Services</hi> I have
done, in working ſuch a Diſlike between the King and the <hi>Lower-Houſe:</hi> by
the Endeavour of that <hi>Honourable-Earl</hi> and <hi>Admirable-Engine,</hi> a ſure Servant to
<pb n="9" facs="tcp:63475:7"/>
us, and the Cauſe whilſt he lives, as the King will never endure a <hi>Parliament</hi>
again, but rather ſuffer abſolute want, than receive conditional releif from his
<hi>Subjects:</hi> the Matter was ſo curiouſly carried the laſt <hi>Parliament,</hi> that is in the
<hi>Powder-PLOT,</hi> the Fact effected ſhould have been imputed to the <hi>Puritans,</hi> the
(greateſt <hi>Zelots</hi> of the <hi>CALVINIAN-Sect</hi>) ſo the Propoſitions which damn up
the Proceedings of this <hi>Parliament</hi> (howſoever they were invented by Roman
<hi>Catholicks,</hi> and by them invented to diſturb that Seſſion) yet were propounded
in favour of the <hi>Puritans,</hi> as if they had been hammored in their Forge, which
very <hi>Name</hi> and <hi>Shadow</hi> the King hates: it being a ſufficient Aſperſion to diſgrace
any Perſon, to ſay he is ſuch, and a ſufficient Bar to ſtop any Suit, and utter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
to croſs it, to ſay it ſmels of, or enclines to, that Party: moreover there are
ſo many about him, which blow this <hi>Coal</hi> fearing their own States. If a <hi>Parli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ament</hi>
ſhould enquire into their Actions, they uſe all their <hi>Art,</hi> and <hi>Induſtry</hi> to
withſtand ſuch a <hi>Council:</hi> perſwading the King he may rule by his abſolute Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rogative,
without a Parliament: and thus furniſh himſelf by a <hi>Mariage</hi> with
us, and by other <hi>Domeſtick</hi> Projects without Subſidies, when leaving off Subſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dies,
and Taxes have been the only uſe Princes have made of ſuch: and where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>as
ſome Free-minds among them, reſembling our Nobility; who prefer
the Priviledg of <hi>Subjects</hi> againſt <hi>Sovereign</hi> Invaſion; call for the Courſe of
the <hi>Common</hi>-Law; (a <hi>Law</hi> proper to their Nation) there is other time <hi>Servers</hi> cry
the Laws down, and up the Prerogative; whereby they pray upon the <hi>Subjects</hi>
by their <hi>Suites,</hi> and <hi>Exactions; mulct</hi> the State, and keep it poor; procure them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves
much Suſpioion amongſt the Better and Judicious Sort, and hate a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mongſt
the oppreſſed Commons; And yet if there ſhould be a Parliament ſuch
a courſe is taken, as they ſhall never chuſe their Sheire <hi>Knights</hi> and <hi>Bur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>geſſes</hi>
freely, who make the better-half of the Body thereof; for theſe being to be
elected, by moſt Voices of the Free-Holders in the Country, where ſuch <hi>Electi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons</hi>
are to be made, are carried which way the Great Perſons who have
Lands in theſe Countries pleaſe; who by their Letters command their <hi>Ten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nants
Followers</hi> and <hi>Friends,</hi> to nominate ſuch as adhere to them, and for the moſt
of them are our <hi>Faction;</hi> and reſpect their own benefit and gain, rather than their
Countries-Good: yea the Country People themſelves, will every one ſtand, for
the <hi>Great-Man</hi> their <hi>Lord,</hi> or Neighbour, or Maſter, whithout regard of his Hone<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſty,
<hi>Wiſdom</hi> and Religion. That which they aim at, (as I am aſſured by faithful
Intelligence) is to pleaſe their <hi>Landlords,</hi> and to renew their Leaſe, in which
regard they will betray their Country and Religion too: and Elect any Man
that may moſt profit their Particular: Therefore it is unlikely there ſhould be
a Parliament, and impoſſible the Kings Debts ſhould be paid, his Wants ſuffici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ently
repaired, and left himſelf ful-handed by ſuch a Courſe: and indeed (as it
is generally thought) by any other courſe than with a Marriage with us: for
which Cauſe whatſoever Project we liſt to attempt, enters ſafely at the door,
whilſt their Policy lyes aſleep, and will not ſee the danger, I have made try<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>al
of theſe Particulars, and found few Exceptions in theſe general Rules;
Thereby I and their own wants together have kept them from furniſhing their
<hi>Navy,</hi> which being the Wall of their Iſland, and once the ſtrongeſt in Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtendom
lies now at road, unarm'd and fit for ruine: If ever we doubted their
ſtrength by Sea, now we need not, there are but few ſhips or men able to
<pb n="10" facs="tcp:63475:8"/>
look abroad, or to live in a ſtorm much leſs in a Sea fight. This I effected by
buzing in their Ears, The furniſhing a Navy bred ſuſpition in my Maſter, and
ſo would avert his mind from this Match, the hope of which rather than they
would looſe, they would almoſt looſe their hope of Heaven.</p>
               <p>Secondly, All their Voyages to the <hi>Eaſt Indies</hi> I permitted rather with a co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lourable
reſiſtance, than a ſerious; becauſe I ſee them not helpful but hurt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful,
to the State in general; carrying out <hi>Gold</hi> and <hi>Silver,</hi> bringing home
<hi>Spice, Silks, Feathers</hi> and ſuch like <hi>Toyes:</hi> an inſenſible waſting the Common Stock
of <hi>Coyn</hi> and <hi>Bullion,</hi> whilſt it fills the Cuſtom Houſe, and ſome Private Houſes,
who thereby are unable to keep this Diſcomodity on foot, by Bribes eſpecially:
So many Great Perſons being Venturers and Sharers in the Gain: beſides this waſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth
the <hi>Mariners,</hi> not one of ten returning, which I am glad to hear; for they
are the Men we ſtand in fear of, as for the <hi>Weſt-Indian</hi> Voyages I withſtood them
in earneſt, becauſe they began to inhabit there, and to fortifie themſelves, and
may in time there perhaps raiſe another <hi>England</hi> to withſtand a <hi>New Spain</hi> in <hi>A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>merica:</hi>
As this Old England oppoſeth our State, and clouds the glorious extent
thereof in <hi>Europe:</hi> Beſides, there they trade for Commodities, without waſt of
their Treaſure, and often return Gold for Knives, Glaſſes, or the like Trifles,
without ſuch loſs of their Mariners as in other places: the refore I croſt whatſoe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver
intendments were projected for <hi>Virginia</hi> or <hi>Burmoudos,</hi> becauſe they may be
hereafter really helpful unto them, as now they ſerve for Dreyns to unload their
Populous State, which elſe would overthrow his own Banks by continuance
of Peace and turn head upon it ſelf, or make a Body fit for any Rebellion: And
ſo far I prevayled therein, as I cauſed moſt of the <hi>Recuſants</hi> who were to go
thither to withdraw their Ventures and diſcourage the work: So that beſides
Private Perſons unable to effect much, nothing was done by the Publick Purſe:
and we know by experience ſuch Voyages and Plantations are not effected with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out
great means, to ſatisfy great difficulties, and with an unwearied Reſolu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
and Power to meet all hazards and diſtaſtes, with ſtrong help and continu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>al
ſupplies, or elſe the undertaking proves idle: By this means alſo I kept the
Voluntary Forces from <hi>Venice,</hi> until it was almoſt too late to ſet out, and had
hopt that work ſhould have broken forth to action, before theſe would have ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rived
to ſuccor them: I put hard for the <hi>Cantionarie Towns,</hi> which our late <hi>Philip</hi>
of <hi>happy Memory</hi> ſo much aimed at, accounting them the Keys of the Low Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tries,
That they might be delivered to his <hi>Catholick Majeſty,</hi> as to the proper
Owner, and had perhaps prevailed, but that the profeſt Enemy to our State
and Church, who dyed ſhortly after, gave Counſel to reſtore them to the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bellious
States, as one that knew popular Commonwealths to be better Neigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bours,
ſafer Friends, and leſs dangerous than Monarchs, and ſo by this pra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctice
wreſted from my hands, and furniſh'd the Exchequer from thence, for
that time, neither was I much grieved, becauſe the dependency they had be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
of the <hi>Engliſh</hi> ſeem'd to be cut off, and the intereſt that the <hi>Engliſh</hi> had
in them to be taken away, which muſt now fully and finally be effected before
we can either hope to conquer them, or <hi>England,</hi> who holding together, are
too ſtrong for the world at Sea; and therefore muſt be diſunited, before they
can be overcome. This Point of State is acknowledged by our experienced Pen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tioner
and ſure Friend <hi>Monſieur Barn<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

But the laſt Service I did for the State, was not the leaſt; when I under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wrought
that <hi>admirable Engine Rawley;</hi> and was the cauſe his Voyage (threat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning
much danger to us) was overthrown and himſelf returning in diſgrace: I
purſued almoſt to Death, neither (I hope) need I ſay almoſt, if all things hit
right, and all things hold, but the determination of my Commiſſion would not
permit me longer to ſtay to follow him to Execution, which I deſired the rather,
that by Confeſſion I might have wrung from the inconſiderable Engliſh an ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>knowledgment
of my Maſters right in thoſe places, puniſhing him for attemp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting
there, though he might preſcribe for the firſt foot; and this I did to ſtop
their mouths hereafter; and becauſe I would quench the Heat and Valour of
that Nation, that none ſhould dare hereafter to undertake the like, or be ſo
hardy to look out at Sea, or breath upon our Coaſt.</p>
               <p>And laſtly, becauſe I would bring to an ignominious Death, that Old
<hi>Pirate,</hi> who is one of the laſt now living, bred under that deceaſed <hi>Engliſh Virago,</hi>
and by her fleſht in our ruine; to do this I had many Agents.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>First,</hi> Diverſe <hi>Courtiers,</hi> who were hungry and gaped wide for <hi>Spaniſh Gold.</hi>

               <p>
                  <hi>Secondly,</hi> Some that bare him a grudg at the heart for inveterate Quarrels.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Thirdly,</hi> Some Foreigners, who having in vain ſought the <hi>Elixir</hi> hitherto, ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ped
to find it in his head.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Fourthly,</hi> all Men of the <hi>Romiſh Faith,</hi> who are of the <hi>Spaniſh Faction;</hi> and

               <p>
                  <hi>Laſtly,</hi> I left behind me ſuch an Inſtrument compoſed artificially of a Secu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lar

for the reſt, what though it be a croſs to the People, or that <hi>Clergy,</hi> we that
only Negotiate for our own gain, and treat about this Marriage for our own
ends, can conclude or break off when we ſee our own time, without re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpect

that the Commons generally are ſo Effeminate and Cowardly that at

<pb n="12" facs="tcp:63475:9"/>
being ever amongſt them ready to aſſiſt us, and they being unprovided of
Ships and Armes, or Hearts to fight, an univerſal diſcontentment filling all
men: This have I from their <hi>Muſtermaſters</hi> and <hi>Captains,</hi> who are many of
them of our Religion, or of none, and ſo ours, ready to be bought and ſold,
and deſirous to be my Maſters Servants in Fee. Thus much for the State
particularly, wherein I have bent my ſelf to weaken them and ſtrengthen us,
and in all theſe have advanced the <hi>Catholick Cauſe,</hi> but eſpecially in procu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring
favours for all ſuch as favour that ſide, and croſſing the other by all

maintained dangerous <hi>Schiſme</hi> between our <hi>Secular Prieſts</hi> ond <hi>Jeſuites,</hi> by
which he diſcovered much weakneſs to the diſhonour of our <hi>Clergy,</hi> and

Countries,</hi> to work ſecretly and inſenſibly between the <hi>Conformiſt</hi> and <hi>Noncon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formiſt,</hi>
and to caſt an eye as far as the <hi>Orcades,</hi> knowing that buſineſs might
be ſtirred up there that might hinder proceedings in <hi>England,</hi> and ſo to prevent
their Conqueſt. The effect you have partly ſeen in the Earl of <hi>Argyle,</hi> who

               </p>
               <p>Neither do our hopes end here, for we daily expect more Revolters, at leaſt
ſuch a diſunion as will never admit ſolid Reconcilement, but will ſend ſome to
us, and ſome to <hi>Amſterdam,</hi> for the King, a wiſe and vigilant Prince, labouring
for a perfect union betwixt both the Kingdoms, which he ſeeth cannot be
effected where the leaſt Ceremony of <hi>Religion</hi> is continued, divers ſharp and
bitter brawls from thence ariſing, whileſt ſome ſtriving for Honour more
than for Truth, prefers their own way, and will, before the general peace
of the Church, and the Edification of Souls; He, I ſay, ſeeks to work an uni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formity
betwixt both Churches, and to this end made a Journey into <hi>Scot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land,</hi>
but with no ſuch ſucceſs as he expected, for divers of ours attended the
Train and ſtirred up Humours and Factions, and caſt in ſcruples and doubts
to hinder and croſs the proceeding; yea thoſe that ſeem moſt averſe to us,
and averſe to our Opinions by their Diſobedience and Example, helped for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward
our Plots, and theſe are encouraged by a Faction and heady multitude,
by a falſe and irreſolute <hi>Clergy</hi> (many falſe Brethren being amongſt the <hi>Biſhops</hi>)
and by the prodigal Nobility who maintain theſe ſtirrs in the Church, that
thereby they may keep the Church-livings in their hands, which they have
moſt Sacrelegiouſly ſeized upon in the time of the firſt Deformation, and which
they fear would be returned by the <hi>Clergy,</hi> if they could be brought to Peace and

               <p>But (quoth the <hi>Inquiſitor-general</hi>) now if this Act of the King wherein he is moſt
earneſt and conſtant ſhould ſo prevail as it ſhould effect a perfect union both in
<hi>Church</hi> and <hi>Commonweal.</hi> I tell you it would in my Conceipt be a great blow to
us, if by a general meeting a General Peace ſhould be concluded, and all their

               <p>True (quoth <hi>Gundamore</hi>) but he takes his mark amiſs, howſoever he under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtands
the People and their inclination better than any man, and better knows
how to temper their paſſions and affections, for (beſides that he is hindred
there in <hi>Scotland</hi> underhand by ſome for the reaſons before recited, and by
other great Ones of ours who are in great places and Authority amongſt them)
he is likewiſe deluded in this point by his own <hi>Clergy</hi> at home in <hi>England,</hi>
who pretend to be moſt forward in the cauſe for they conſidering if a general
Uniformity were wrought, what an Inundation would follow, whilſt all or moſt
of theirs (as they fear) would flock hither for preferment (as men preſſing to
the Sun for Light and heat, and ſo their own ſhould be unprovided, theſe
therefore (I ſay) howſoever they bear the King in hand, or underhand againſt
it, and ſtand for all Ceremonies to be obtruded with a kind of abſolute neceſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſity
upon them, when the other will not be almoſt drawn to receive any, when
if an abatement were made, doubtleſs they might be drawn to inſert in the
midſt, but there is no hopes of this with them, where neither Part deals ſeri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ouſly,
but only for the preſent to ſatisfy the King and ſo there is no fear on our
ſide, that affections and opinions ſo diverſe will ever be reconciled and made
one: The B. of St. <hi>Andrews</hi> ſtands almoſt alone in the cauſe, and pulls upon him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf,
the labour, the loſs, and the envy of all with little proficiency, whilſt the
adverſe Faction have as ſure Friends and as good Intelligence about the King as
he hath, and the ſame <hi>Poſt,</hi> that perhaps brings a Packet from the King to him
brings another from their Abettors to them, acquainting them with the whole
Proceedings and Counſels, and preparing them aforehand for oppoſition, this
I know for Truth, and this I rejoyce in, as concerning much the <hi>Catholick Good.</hi>
But (quoth the <hi>Nuntio</hi> are there none of the <hi>Heretical Preachers</hi> buſie about this
match, methinks their fingers ſhould itch to be writing, and their Tongues
burn to be Prating of this buſineſs, eſpecially the <hi>Puritanical Sort,</hi> howſoever the
moſt temperate and indifferent carry themſelves. The truth is my Lord (quoth
the Embaſſador) that privately what they can, and publickly what they dare,
both in <hi>England</hi> and <hi>Scotland</hi> all for the moſt part (except ſuch as are of our Faith)
oppoſe this match to the utmoſt by Prayers, Counſels, Speeches and wiſhes, but
if one be found longer tongued then his Fellows, we have ſtill means to charm
their ſauſineſs, to ſilence them, and expell them the Court, to diſgrace them,
and croſs their Preferment with the Imputation of pragmatick <hi>Puritaniſm,</hi> for
inſtance I will relate this one particular, a Doctor of theirs, and a <hi>Chaplain</hi> in
Ordinary to the King, gave many reaſons in a Letter againſt this Marriage, and
propounded a way, how to ſupply the Kings wants otherways, which I un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtanding,

                  </gap>nd, That the Doctor was committed, and hard<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
eſcaped the danger of his preſumptuous Admonition, though the State knew
<pb n="14" facs="tcp:63475:10"/>
his Intent honeſt, and his Reaſons good, wherein we on the other ſide (both
here and with the <hi>Arch-Duke</hi>) have Books penned, and Pictures printed directly
againſt their King and State, for the which their <hi>Embaſſadors</hi> have ſought ſatis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>faction
of us in vain, not being able to ſtay the Print, or ſo much as to touch
the Hem of the Authors Garment: But we have an Evaſion, which <hi>Heretioks</hi>
miſs, our Clergy being freed from the Temporal Sword, and ſo not included
in our Treaties and Conditions of Peace, but at liberty to give any <hi>Heretical
Prince</hi> the ſlip when they liſt, whereas theirs are lyable to accompt and hazard,
and are muſſed for barking, when ours may both bark and bite too; the Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſel-Table
and the <hi>Star-Chamber</hi> do ſo terrifie them, as they dare not riot, but run
at the Stirrop with excellent Command, and come in at the leaſt rebuke: They
call their preaching in many Places ſtanding up, but they crouch and dare not
ſtand up, behaving themſelves like Sitters ſilent, creeping upon their Bellies
lick the Duſt, which our Prieſts ſhake from their beautiful feet. Now (quoth
the Duke of <hi>Lerma</hi>) ſatisfy me about our own Clergy, how they fare, for there
were here Petitions made to the King in the name of the diſtreſſed, afflicted,
perſecuted and impriſoned Prieſts, that his Majeſty would interceed for them,
to free them from the intollerable burdens they groaned under, and to procure
them their Liberties, and Letters were directed from us to that end, that you
would negotiate that Demand with all ſpeed and diligence.</p>
               <p>Moſt excellent Prince (replyed <hi>Gondamore</hi>) I did your Command with a kind
of Command my ſelf, not thinking it fit to make it a Suit in your Name, or my
Maſters, I obtained them Liberty to walk freely up and down, to face and out<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>face
their Accuſers, judge Magiſtrates, Biſhops, and to excuſe their Function
almoſt as freely, altogetheras ſafely as at <hi>Rome.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Here the <hi>Nuntio</hi> replyed, that he did not well in his Judgment, in procuring
their Liberty, ſince they might do more good in priſon than abroad, becauſe in
priſon they ſeemed to be under perſecution, and ſo were pitied of others, and
pity of the perſon prepares the affection further, beſides then they were careful
over their own Lives to give none Offence, but abroad they might be ſcandalous
in their Lives, as they uſe to be in <hi>Rome</hi> and <hi>Spain</hi> and other <hi>Catholick Countries,</hi>
and ſo the opinion of their Holineſs, which upholds their credit and cauſe a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt
the married Clergy, would ſoon decay.</p>
               <p>But the Embaſſador anſwered, he conſidered thoſe Inconveniences, but beſides
a ſuperiour Advantage aroſe from the profit of Liberty more than of Reſtraint,
for now they might freely confer and were ever practiſing, and would doubt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſs
produce ſome work of wonder, and beſides by reaſon of their Authority
and means to change places did apply themſelves to many perſons, whereas in
priſon they could only deal with ſuch as came to be taught, and were their own
before; and this (quoth he) add as a ſecret, that as before they were maintai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned
by private Contributions to denounce <hi>Catholicks</hi> even to acceſs; ſo much
more now ſhall they be able to gather great Sums to weaken the State, and fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſh
them for ſome high attempt, by the example of Cardinal <hi>Woolſey,</hi> barrel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling
up Gold for <hi>Rome,</hi> and this they may eaſily do, ſince all <hi>Catholicks</hi> rob the
<hi>Heretical Priests,</hi> and hold <hi>Tithes</hi> from them by <hi>fraud</hi> or <hi>force,</hi> to give to theirs
of their own, to whom it is properly due, and if this be ſpyed, it is an eaſy mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
to lay all upon the <hi>Hollander,</hi> and ſay, <hi>He carryeth the Coyn out of the Land</hi> (who
are forward indeed in ſuch practiſes) and ſo ours ſhall not only be excuſed, but
a flaw made betwixt them, to weaken their amities, and to get ſuſpition betwixt
them of each others Love.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="15" facs="tcp:63475:10"/>
But amongſt all theſe Prieſts; (quoth the <hi>Inquiſitor General</hi>) did you re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>member,
that Old Reverend Father <hi>Baldwin,</hi> who had a Finger in that admirable
attempt made on our behalf againſt the Parliament Houſe? Such as he de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerving

               <p>Holy Father (quoth <hi>Gondamore</hi>) my principal care was of <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

                  </gap>im, whoſe Life

went in Perſon attended with my Trayn, and diverſe other well-willers to
fetch him out of the <hi>Tower,</hi> where he was in durance; as ſoon as I came into
his ſight, I behaved my ſelf after ſo lowly and humble a manner, that our Ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſaries
ſtood amazed to ſee the Reverence we gave to our <hi>Ghostly Fathers;</hi> and
this I did to confound them and their contemptous Clergy, to beget an ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>traordinary
Opinion of Holineſs in the Perſon, and Piety in us; and alſo
to provoke the <hi>Engliſh Catholicks</hi> to the like devout Obedience, that thereby at
any time their <hi>Jeſuites</hi> (whoſe Authority was ſomewhat weakened, ſince the
<hi>Schiſm</hi> betwixt them and the <hi>Seculars,</hi> and the ſucceeding <hi>POUDER PLOT</hi>) may

their Children, Kings their Subjects; and that they may do this the
more boldly and ſecurely<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> I have ſomewhat daſht the Authority of their High
Commiſſion; upon which whereas there are diverſe Purſevants (Men of the
worſt kind and condition) reſembling our Flies and Familiars, attending upon
the Inquiſition<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> whoſe Office and Imployment, is to diſturb the <hi>Catholicks,</hi>

and the like religious Appurtenances. I have cauſed the Execution of their
Offices to be ſlackned, that ſo an open way may be given to our Spiritual In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtruments,
for the free-exerciſe of their Faculties: And yet when theſe Pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſevants
had greateſt Authority, a ſmall Bribe in the Country would blind their
Eyes, or a little greater at <hi>Court,</hi> or in the <hi>Exchequer</hi> fruſtrate and croſs all their
Actions, for that their Malice went off like Squibs, made a great Crack to
fright Children and new-born Babes, but hurt no Old Men of Catholick Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rits;
and this is the effect of all other their Courſes of Proceedings in this kind,
in all their Judicial Courts, whether known <hi>Catholicks</hi> committed as they ſtile
them, or often ſummoned and cited, threatened and bound over, but the
danger is paſt ſo ſoon as the Officer hath his Fee paid him, then the Execution
goeth no further: nay, upon my conſcience they are as glad when there are
offenders in that kind, becauſe they are bountiful, and the Officers do their
beſt to favour them, that they may encreaſe; and ſo their Reuenue and Gain
come in freely. And if they ſhould be ſent to Priſon, even that place for the
moſt part is made a Sanctuary to them; as the <hi>Old Romans</hi> were wont to ſhut
up ſuch, by wayes of reſtraint, as they meant to preſerve from the Peoples
Fury, for they live ſafe in Priſon, till we have time to work their liberty,
and aſſure their Lives, and in the mean time their place of reſtraint is as it
were a Study to them, where they may have opportunity to confer together
as in a <hi>Colledge,</hi> and to arm themſelves in Unity againſt the Single Adverſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry
abroad.</p>
               <p>But (quoth the Inquiſitor General) how do they for Books, when they have

given by that famous Knight <hi>Sr Thomas Bodly,</hi> if either I had been then imployed, or this courſe
of mine than thought upon; for I would labour what I might this way or any other way to diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>arm
them, or either to tranſlate their beſt <hi>Authors</hi> hither, or at leaſt to leave none but in the
hands of <hi>Roman Catholicks,</hi> who are aſſuredly <hi>ours,</hi> and to this end a ſpecial Eye would be had
upon the <hi>Library</hi> of one Sr. <hi>Robert Cotton</hi> (an Ingroſſer of <hi>Antiquities</hi>) the moſt choice and ſin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gular
pieces might be gleened, and gathered up by a <hi>Catholick</hi> Hand: Neither let any Man think
That deſcending thus low to petty Particulars is unworthy an Embaſſador, or a ſmall avail for

converſing for <hi>Stateſmen,</hi> than amongſt Schollars, eſpecially the King, for whom we watch
is the King of Scholars, and loves to live altogether almoſt in their Element: Beſides if we
can by any means continue differences in their Church, or make them wider, or get diſtaſt betwixt
