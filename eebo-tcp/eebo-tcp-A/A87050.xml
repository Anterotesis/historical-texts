            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

               <hi>Leah</hi> and <hi>Rachell,</hi> or the two fruit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full Siſters of <hi>Virginia</hi> and <hi>Mary-land;</hi> their pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent condition impartially ſtated and related.</head>
            <p>IT is the glory of every Nation to enlarge themſelves, to encourage their own forraign attempts, and to be able to have of their own, within their own territories, as many ſeveral commodities as they can attain to, that ſo others may rather be beholding to them, then they to others; and to this purpoſe have Encouragements, Privi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledges and Emunities been given to any Diſcoveries or Ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venturers into remote Colonies, by all politique Common Wealths in the world.</p>
            <p>But alas, we Engliſhmen (in all things elſe famous, and to other Countries terrible) do not onely faile in this, but vilifie, ſcandalize and cry down ſuch parts of the unknown world, as have been found out, ſetled and made flouriſhing, by the charge, hazzard and diligence of their own brethren, as if becauſe removed from us, we either account them peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple of another world or enemies.</p>
            <p>This is too truly made good in the odiums and cruell ſlanders caſt on thoſe two famous Countries of <hi>
                  <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>irginia</hi> and
<pb n="2" facs="tcp:118942:5"/>
               <hi>Mary-land,</hi> whereby thoſe Countries, not onely are many times at a ſtand, but are in danger to moulder away, and come in time to nothing; nor is there any thing but the fertility and natural gratefulneſſe of them, left a remedy to prevent it.</p>
            <p>To let our own Nation (whoſe common good I covet, and whoſe Common wealths ſervant I am, as born to no other uſe) be made ſenſible of theſe injuries: I have under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taken in this Book to give the true ſtate of thoſe places, ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to the condition they are now in; and to declare either to diſtreſſed or diſcontented, that they need not doubt becauſe of any rumour detracting from their good<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſes, to remove and caſt themſelves and Fortunes upon thoſe Countries, in which if I ſhould deviate from the truth; I have at this preſent carping enemies in <hi>London</hi> enough, to contradict and cry down me and this, for Impoſtours. It is not long ſince I came from thence (God knows ſore a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt my will) having lived there upward of one and twen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty years; nor do I intend (by Gods aſſiſtance) to be long out of it again: and therefore can by experience, not hear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſay (as <hi>Bullock</hi> and other lying Writters have done, who at randome or for their own private lucre have rendred their Books rediculous and themſelves infamous lyars, nor will I like them, over extoll the places, as if they were rather Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>radices than earthly habitations; but truly let ye know, what they are, and how the people there live.) Which when impartially viewed, will undoubtedly clear up thoſe Fog<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gy Miſts, that hath to their own ruine blinded and kept off many from going thither, whoſe miſeries and misfortunes by ſtaying in <hi>England</hi> are much to be lamented, and much to be pittied.</p>
            <p>In reſpect theſe two Siſter Countries (though diſtinct Governments) are much of one nature, both for produce and manner of living; I ſhall only at preſent, Treat of the elder Siſter <hi>Virginia,</hi> and in ſpeaking of that include both: And ere I leave off, ſhall in particular rehearſe the unnatu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rall uſuage <hi>Mary-land</hi> the younger Siſter, hath had, not by

            <p>The Country is reported to be an unhealthy place, a neſt of Rogues, whores, deſolute and rooking perſons; a place of intolerable labour, bad uſage and hard Diet, <hi>&amp;c.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>To Anſwer theſe ſeveral calumnies, I ſhall firſt ſhew what it was? next, what it is?</p>
            <p>At the firſt ſettling and many years after, it deſerved moſt of thoſe aſperſions (nor were they then aſperſions but truths) it was not ſettled at the publique charge; but when found out, challenged, and maintained by Adventurers, whoſe avarice and inhumanity, brought in theſe inconve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niences, which to this day brands <hi>

            <p>Then were Jayls emptied, youth ſeduced, infamous wo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men drilled in, the proviſions all brought out of <hi>England,</hi> and that embezzelled by the Truſtees (for they durſt neither hunt fowl, nor Fiſh, for fear of the <hi>Indian,</hi> which they ſtood in aw of, their labour was almoſt perpetuall, their allow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance of victual ſmall, few or no cattle, no uſe of horſes nor oxen to draw or carry, (which labours men ſupplyed them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves) all which cauſed a mortality; no civil courts of juſtice but under a Marſhall law, no redreſſe of grievances, complaints were repaied with ſtripes, moneys with ſcoffes, tortures made delights, and in a word all and the worſt that tyrany could inflict or act, which when complained of in <hi>England:</hi> (but ſo were they kept under that it was long ere they would ſuffer complaints to come home) the bon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dage was taken of, the people ſet free, and had lands a ſigned to each of them to live of themſelves, and enjoy the benefit of their own induſtry; men then began to call what they laboured for their own, they fell to making themſelves convenient houſing to dwell in, to plant corne for their food, to range the wood for fleſh, the rivers for fowle and fiſh, to finde out ſomwhat ſtaple for ſupplie of cloathing, to continue a commerce, to purchaſe and breed cattle, &amp;c. but the bud of this growing happineſſe was again nipt by a cruell Maſſacre committed by the Natives, which again pull'd them back and kept them under, enforcing them to

            <p>Yet was not <hi>Virginia</hi> all this while without divers honeſt and vertuous inhabitants, who obſerving the general neg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lect and licenſiouſneſſes there, cauſed Aſſemblies to be call'd and Laws to be made tending to the glory of God, the ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vere ſuppreſſion of vices, and the compelling them not to neglect (upon ſtrickt puniſhments) planting and tending ſuch quantities of Corn, as would not onely ſerve them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves, their Cattel and Hogs plentifully, but to be ena<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bled to ſupply <hi>New England</hi> (then in want) with ſuch pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portions, as were extream reliefs, to them in their neceſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="5" facs="tcp:118942:6"/>From this induſtry of theirs and great plenty of Corn, (the main ſtaffe of life) proceeded that great plenty of Cat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tel and Hogs, (now innumerable) and out of which not on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly <hi>New England</hi> hath been ſtocked and relieved, but all other parts of the <hi>Indies</hi> inhabited by Engliſhmen.</p>
            <p>The inhabitants now finding the benefit of their indu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtries, began to look with delight on their increaſing ſtocks: (as nothing more pleaſurable then profit) to take pride in their plentifully furniſhed Tables, to grow not onely civil, but great obſervers of the Sabbath, to ſtand upon their re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>putations, and to be aſhamed of that notorious manner of life they had formerly lived and wallowed in.</p>
            <p>They then began to provide and ſend home for Goſpel Miniſters, and largely contributed for their maintenance; But <hi>
                  <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>irginia</hi> ſavouring not handſomely in <hi>England,</hi> very few of good converſation would adventure thither, (as thinking it a place wherein ſurely the fear of God was not) yet many came, ſuch as wore Black Coats, and could babble in a Pulpet, roare in a Tavern, exact from their Pariſhoners, and rather by their diſſoluteneſſe deſtroy than feed their Flocks.</p>
            <p>Loath was the Country to be wholy without Teachers, and therefore rather retain theſe then to be deſtitute; yet ſtill endeavours for better in their places, which were ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tained, and theſe Wolves in ſheeps cloathing, by their Aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſemblies queſtioned, ſilenced, and ſome forced to depart the Country.</p>
            <p>Then began the Goſpel to flouriſh, civil, honourable, and men of great <gap reason="illegible" extent="1 letter">

            <p>In the Countries minority, and before they had well cleared the ground to let in ayre (which now is otherwiſe) many imputed the ſtifling of the wood to be the cauſe of ſuch ſickneſſe; but I rather think the contrary; for di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vers new Rivers lately ſettled, were at their firſt comming upon them as woody as <hi>James</hi> Rivers, the firſt place they ſetled in, and yet thoſe Rivers are as healthy as any former ſetled place in <hi>Virginia</hi> or <hi>England</hi> it ſelf: I believe (and that not without reaſon) it was only want of ſuch diet as beſt agreed with our Engliſh natures, good drinks and whole<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſome lodgings were the cauſe of ſo much ſickneſſes, as were formerly frequent, which we have now amended; and therefore enjoy better healths; to which I add, and that by experience ſince my comming into <hi>England,</hi> and many (if not all <hi>
                  <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>irginians</hi> can do the like,) that change of ayre does much alter the ſtate of our bodies: by which many travel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lers thither may expect ſome ſickneſs, yet little danger of mortality.</p>
            <p>A Geographicall deſcription of the Country I ſhall not attempt (as having littles kill in the Mathematicks) enough of that hath been formerly Written; nor is it a place now to learn to diſcover. I ſhall abhor to ſpirit over any; but go along with ſuch as are voluntarily deſirous to go thither, and lead them with my blunt relation (for truth knows little of eloquence) aboard the Ships thither bound, and
<pb n="7" facs="tcp:118942:7"/>
carrying you into the Country, ſhew you the courteſie of the place, the, diſpoſition of the Inhabitants, the commodi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties, and give all ſorts of people advice how and where to ſet down for their preſent benefit and future accommoda<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion.</p>
            <p>If any are minded to repair thither, if they are not in a capacity to defray their own charges (if they are I wiſh they might and ſo be at their own diſpoſing) let them not be ſeduced by thoſe mercinary ſpirits that know little of the place, nor aime at any good of theirs, but onely by foyſting and flattering them to gain a reward of thoſe they procure them for; beware them, for it is not only hab nab whether ye go to a good ſervice or a bad, but ſcandalous to your ſelves to be ſo ſeduced, and it were good and very juſt that ſuch vagabond people were ſeverely puniſhed, as great betrayers of their own Nation, for ye cannot imagine but there are as well bad ſervices as good; but I ſhall ſhew ye if any happen into the hands of ſuch crooked diſpoſiti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, how to order them and eaſe your ſelves, when I come to treat of the juſtice of the Country, which many being ig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>norant of ſuffer inconveniences, which by this they may prevent.</p>
            <p>Let ſuch as are ſo minded not raſhly throw themſelves upon the voyage, but obſerve the nature, and enquire the qualities of the perſons with whom they ingage to tranſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>port themſelves, or if (as not acquainted with ſuch as in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>habit there, but go with Merchants and Mariners, who tranſport them to others,) let their covenant be ſuch, that after their arrival they have a fortnights time aſſigned them to enquire of their Maſter, and make choyce of ſuch as they intend to expire their time with, nor let that brand of ſel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling of ſervants, be any diſcouragement to deter any from going, for if a time muſt be ſerved, it is all one with whom it be ſerved, provided they be people of honeſt repute, with which the Country is well repleniſhed.</p>
            <p>And be ſure to have your contract in writing and under hand and ſeal, for if ye go over upon promiſe made to do this or that, or to be free or your own men, it ſignifies no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing,

for by a law of the Country (waving all promiſes) a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny one coming in, and not paying their own paſſages, muſt ſerve if men or women four years, if younger according to their years, but where an Inden<gap reason="illegible" extent="1 letter">

               </gap>ure is, that is binding and obſerving.</p>
            <p>The uſuall allowance for ſervants is (beſides their charge of paſſage defrayed) at their expiration, a years proviſion of corne, dubble apparrell, tooles neceſſary, and land ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to the cuſtome of the Country, which is an old de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>luſion, for there is no land accuſtomary due to the ſervant, but to the Maſter, and therefore that ſervant is unwiſe that will not daſh out that cuſtom in his covenant, and make that due of land abſolutely his own, which although at the preſent, not of ſo great conſequence; yet in few years will be of much worth, as I ſhall hereafter make manifeſt.</p>
            <p>When ye go aboard, expect the Ship ſomewhat troubled and in a hurliburly, untill ye cleer the lands end; and that the Ship is rummaged, and things put to rights, which many times diſcourages the Paſſengers, and makes them wiſh the Voyage unattempted: but this is but for a ſhort ſeaſon, and waſhes off when at Sea, where the time is plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſantly paſſed away, though not with ſuch choiſe plenty as the ſhore affords.</p>
            <p>But when ye arrive and are ſettled, ye will find a ſtrange alteration, an abuſed Country giving the lye in your own approbations to thoſe that have calumniated ir, and theſe infalable arguments may convince all incredible and ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtinate opinions, concerning the goodneſſe and delight<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fulneſſe of the Country, that never any ſervants of late times have gone thither; but in their Letters to their Friends commend and approve of the place, and rather in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vite than diſſwade their acquaintance from comming thi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther. An other is this, that ſeldom (if ever) any that hath continued in <hi>
                  <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>irginia</hi> any time, will or do deſire to live in <hi>England,</hi> but poſt back with what expedition they can; al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>though many are landed men in <hi>England,</hi> and have good E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtates here, and divers wayes of preferments propounded to them, to entice and perſwade their continuance.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="9" facs="tcp:118942:8"/>The Country is as I ſaid of a temperate nature, the dayes, in ſummer not ſo long as in <hi>England,</hi> in winter longer; it is ſomewhat hotter in <hi>June, July</hi> and <hi>Auguſt</hi> then here, but that heat ſweetly allayed by a continual breaze of winde, which never failes to cool and refreſh the labourer and tra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veller; the cold ſeldom approaches ſencibly untill about <hi>Chriſtmas,</hi> (although the laſt winter was hard and the worſt I or any living there ever knew) and when winter comes, (which is ſuch and no worſe then is in <hi>England,</hi>) it conti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nues two monthes ſeldom longer, often not ſo long and in that time although here ſeldom hard-weather keep men from labour, yet there no work is done all winter except dreſſing their own victuals and making of fires.</p>
            <p>The labour ſervants are put to, is not ſo hard nor of ſuch continuance as Husbandmen, nor Handecraft<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men are kept at in <hi>England,</hi> as I ſaid litle or nothing is done in winter time, none ever work before ſun riſing nor after ſun ſet, in the ſummer they reſt, ſleep or exerciſe themſelves five houres in the heat of the day, Saturdays afternoon is alwayes their own, the old Holidayes are obſerved and the Sabboath ſpent in good exerciſes.</p>
            <p>The Women are not (as is reported) put into the ground to worke, but occupie ſuch domeſtique imployments and houſwifery as in <hi>England,</hi> that is dreſſing victuals, righting up the houſe, milking, imployed about dayries, waſhing, ſowing, &amp;c. and both men and women have times of re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>creations, as much or more than in any part of the world beſides, yet ſom wenches that are naſty, beaſtly and not fit to be ſo imployed are put into the ground, for reaſon tells us, they muſt not at charge be tranſported and then man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tained for nothing, but thoſe that prove ſo aukward are ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther burthenſom then ſervants deſirable or uſefull.</p>
            <p>The Country is fruitfull, apt for all and more then <hi>Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land</hi> can or does produce, the uſuall diet is ſuch as in <hi>Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land,</hi> for the rivers afford innumerable ſortes of choyce fiſh, (if they will take the paines to make wyers or hier the Natives, who for a ſmall matter will undertake it,) winter and ſummer, and that in many places ſufficient to

ſerve the uſe of man, and to fatten hoggs, water-fowle of all ſortes are (with admiration to be ſpoken of) plentifull, and eaſte to be killed, yet by many degrees more plentifull in ſome places then in otherſome, Deare all over the Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>try, and in many places ſo many, that veniſon is accounted a tireſom meat, wilde Turkeys are frequent, and ſo large that I have ſeen ſome weigh neer threeſcore pounds; other beaſts there are whoſe fleſh is wholſom and ſavourie, ſuch are unknowne to us; and therefore I will not ſtuffe my book with ſuperfluous, relation of their names; huge Oy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſters and ſtore in all parts where the ſalt-water comes.</p>
            <p>The Country is exceedingly repleniſhed with Neat cat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle, Hoggs, Goats and Tame-fowle, but not many ſheep; ſo that mutton is ſomwhat ſcarce but that defect is ſupplied with ſtore of Veniſon; other fleſh and fowle, the Country is full of gallant Orchards, and the fruit generally more luſcious and delightfull then here, witneſſe the Peach and Quince, the latter may be eaten raw ſavourily, the former differs and as much exceeds ours as the beſt reliſhed apple we have doth the crabb, and of both moſt excellent and comfortable drinks are made, Grapes in infinite manners grow wilde, ſo do Walnuts, Smalnuts, Cheſnuts and a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bundance of excellent fruits, Plums and Berries, not grow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing or known in <hi>England;</hi> graine we have, both <hi>Engliſh</hi> and <hi>Indian</hi> for bread and Bear, and Peaſe beſides <hi>Engliſh</hi> of ten ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veral ſorts, all exceeding ours in <hi>England,</hi> the gallant root of Potatoes are common, and ſo are all ſorts of rootes, herbes and Garden ſtuffe.</p>
            <p>It muſt needs follow then that diet cannot be ſcarce, ſince both rivers and woods affords it, and that ſuch plen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty of Cattle and Hoggs are every where, which yeeld beefe, milk, butter, cheeſe and other made diſhes, porke, bacon, and pigs, and that as ſweet and ſavoury meat as the world affords, theſe with the help of Orchards and Gardens, Oy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſters, Fiſh, Fowle and Veniſon, certainly cannot but be ſufficient for a good deit and wholſom accommodation, conſidering how plentifully they are, and how eaſie with induſtry to be had.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="11" facs="tcp:118942:9"/>Beare is indeed in ſome place conſtantly drunken, in o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther ſome, nothing but Water or Milk, and Water or Beve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rige; and that is where the goodwives, if I may ſo call them, are negligent and idle; for it is not for want of Corn to make Malt with (for the Country affords enough) but be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe they are ſloathfull and careleſſe: but I hope this item will ſhame them out of thoſe humours, that they will be adjudged by their drink, what kinde of Houſewives they are.</p>
            <p>Thoſe Servants that will be induſtrious may in their time of ſervice gain a competent eſtate before their Free<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>domes, which is uſually done by many, and they gaine e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſteem and aſſiſtance that appear ſo induſtrious: There is no Maſter almoſt but will allow his Servant a parcell of clear ground to plant ſome Tobacco in for himſelf, which he may husband at thoſe many idle times he hath allowed him and not prejudice, but rejoyce his Maſter to ſee it, which in time of Shipping he may lay out for commodities, and in Summer ſell them again with advantage, and get a Sow-Pig or two, which any body almoſt will give him, and his Maſter ſuffer him to keep them with his own, which will be no charge to his Maſter, and with one years increaſe of them may purchaſe a Cow Calf or two, and by that time he is for himſelf; he may have Cattel, Hogs and Tobacco of his own, and come to live gallantly; but this muſt be gained (as I ſaid) by Induſtry and affability, not by ſloath nor churliſh behaviour.</p>
            <p>And whereas it is rumoured that Servants have no lodg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing other then on boards, or by the Fire ſide, it is contra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry to reaſon to believe it; Firſt, as we are Chriſtians; next as people living under a law, which compels as well the Maſter as the Servant to perform his duty; nor can true la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bour be either expected or exacted without ſufficient cloa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing, diet, and lodging; all which both their Indentures (which muſt inviolably be obſerved) and the Juſtice of the Country requires.</p>
            <p>But if any go thither, not in a condition of a Servant, but pay his or her paſſage, which is ſome ſix pounds: Let
<pb n="12" facs="tcp:118942:10"/>
them not doubt but it is money well layd out (yet howe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver let them not fall (although they carry little elſe to take a Bed along with them, and then few Houſes but will give them entertainment, either out of curteſie, or on reaſonable tearms; and I think it better for any that goes over free, and but in a mean condition, to hire himſelf for reaſon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able wages of Tobacco and Proviſion, the firſt year, provi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded he happen in an honeſt houſe, and where the Miſtreſſe is noted for a good Houſewife, of which there are very ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny (notwithſtanding the cry to the contrary) for by that means he will live free of disburſment, have ſomething to help him the next year, and be carefully looked to in his ſickneſſe (if he chance to fall ſick) and let him ſo covenant that exceptions may be made, that he work not much in the hot weather, a courſe we alwayes take with our new hands (as they call them) the firſt year they come in.</p>
            <p>If they are women that go after this manner, that is pay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing their own paſſage; I adviſe them to ſojourn in a houſe of honeſt repute, for by their good carriage, they may advance themſelves in marriage, by their ill, overthow their fortunes; and although looſe perſons ſeldome live long unmarried if free; yet they match with as deſolute as themſelves, and never live handſomly or are ever reſpected.</p>
            <p>For any that come over free, and are minded to dyet and quarter in another mans houſe, it matters not whether they know on what term or conditions they are there; for by an excellent Decree, made by Sir <hi>William Berkly,</hi> when Governour; (as indeed he was the Author of many good Laws:) It was ordered, that if any inhabitant received any ſtranger Merchant, or border into their houſes, and did not condition in Writing with him or them ſo entertained on what tearms he received them, it ſhould be ſuppoſed an in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vitation, an no ſatisfaction ſhould be allowed or recovered in any Court of Juſtice; thereby giving notice that no ſtranger coming into the Country ſhould be drilled in, or made a purchaſe of under colour of friendſhip: but that the Inhabitants at firſt coming ſhall let them know how they mean to deal with them, that if they like not the
<pb n="13" facs="tcp:118942:10"/>
terms they may remove themſelves at pleaſure; a Law ſo good and commendable, that it is never like to be revoked or altered.</p>
            <p>Now for thoſe that carry over Families and eſtates with a determination to inhabit, my advice is that they neither ſojourn for that will be chargeable; nor on the ſudden purchaſe, for that may prove unfortunate; but that they for the firſt year hire a houſe (for ſeats are alwayes to be hi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red) and by that means, they will not onely finde content and live at a cheap rate, but be acquainted in the Country and learn the worth and goodneſſe of the Plantation they mean to purchaſe; and ſo not raſhly intangle themſelves in an ill bargain, or finde where a convenient parcell of Land is for their turns to be taken up.</p>
            <p>Yet are the Inhabitants generally affable, courteous and very aſſiſtant to ſtrangers (for what but plenty makes hoſpitality and good neighbour hood) and no ſooner are they ſettled, but they will be viſiting, preſenting and ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vicing the ſtranger how to improve what they have, how to better their way of livelihood.</p>
            <p>Juſtice is there duly and daily adminiſtred; hardly can any travaile two miles together, but they will finde a Ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtice, which hath power of himſelf to hear and determine mean differences, to ſecure and binde over notorious offen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders, of which very few are in the Country.</p>
            <p>In every County are Courts kept, every two moneths, and oftener if occaſion require, in which Courts all things are determined without exceptions; and if any diſlike the proceedings of thoſe Courts, they have liberty to appeal to the Quarter Court, which is four times a year; and from thence to the Aſſembly, which is once or oftner eve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry year: So that I am confident, more ſpeedy Juſtice and with ſmaller charge is not in any place to be found.</p>
            <p>Theſt is ſeldome puniſhed (as being ſeldome or never committed; for as the Proverb is, where there are no re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceivers, there are no thieves; and although Doores are nightly left open (eſp<gap reason="illegible" extent="1 letter">

            <p>Indeed I have known ſome ſuffer for ſtealing of Hogs, (but not ſince they have been plentifull) and whereas Hogſtealing was once puniſhed with death, it is now made penal, and reſtitution given very amply to the owner thereof.</p>
            <p>Caſes of Murther are puniſhed as in <hi>England,</hi> and Juries allowed, as well in Criminal cauſes, as in all other diffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rences between party and party, if they deſire it.</p>
            <p>Servants complaints are freely harkened to, and (if not cauſleſly made) their Maſters are compelled either ſpeedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly to amend, or they are removed upon ſecond complaint to another ſervice; and often times not onely ſet free, if the abuſe merit it, but ordered to give reparation and damage to their ſervant.</p>
            <p>The Country is very full of ſober, modeſt perſons, both men and women, and many that truly fear God and fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low that perfect rule of our bleſſed Saviour, to do as they would be done by; and of ſuch a happy inclination is the Country, that many who in <hi>England</hi> have been lewd and idle, there in emulation or imitation (for example moves more then precept) of the induſtry of thoſe they finde there, not onely grow aſhamed of their former courſes, but abhor to hear of them, and in ſmall time wipe off thoſe ſtains they have formerly been tainted with; yet I cannot but confeſſe, there are people wicked enough (as what Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>try is free) for we know ſome natures will never be re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formed, but theſe muſt follow the Fryers rule, <hi>Si non caſte, tamen cante;</hi> for if any be known, either to prophane the Lords day or his Name, be found drunk, commit whore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome, ſcandalize or diſturb his neighbour, or give offence to the world by living ſuſpiciouſly in any bad courſes; there are for each of theſe, ſevere and wholſome laws and remedies made, provided and duly put in execution: I can confidently affirm, that ſince my being in <hi>England,</hi> which is

not yet four moneths, I have been an eye and ear witneſſe of more deceits and villanies (and ſuch as modeſty forbids me to utter) then I either ever ſaw or heard mention made of in <hi>Virginia,</hi> in my one and twenty years aboad in thoſe parts.</p>
            <p>And therefore thoſe that ſhall blemiſh <hi>Virginia</hi> any more, do but like the Dog bark againſt the Moon, untill they be blind and weary; and <hi>Virginia</hi> is now in that ſecure grow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing condition, that like the Moon ſo barked at, ſhe will paſſe on her courſe, maugre all detractors, and a few years will bring it to that glorious happineſſe, that many of her calumniators, will intercede to procure admittance thi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, when it will be hard to be attained to; for in ſmal time, little land will be to be taken up; and after a while none at all; and as the Mulberry Trees grows up, which are by every one planted, Tobacco will be laid by, and we ſhall wholy fall to making of Silk (a Sample of 400 l. hath already been ſent for <hi>England,</hi> and approved of) which will require little labour; and therefore ſhall have little uſe of Servants; beſides, Children increaſe and thrive ſo well there, that they themſelves will ſufficiently ſupply the defect of Servants: And in ſmall time become a Nation of themſelves ſufficient to people the Country: And this good policy is there uſed; As the Children there born grow to maturity, and capable (as they are generally very capable and apt) they are ſtill preferred and put into au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thority, and carry themſelves therein civilly and diſcret<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly; and few there are but are able to give ſome Portions with their daughters, more or leſſe, according to their a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bilities; ſo that many comming out of <hi>England</hi> have raiſed themſelves good fortunes there meerly by matching with Maidens born in the Country.</p>
            <p>And therefore I cannot but admire, and indeed much pitty the dull ſtupidity of people neceſſitated in <hi>England,</hi> who rather then they will remove themſelves, live here a baſe, ſlaviſh, penurious life; as if there were a neceſſity to live and to live ſo, chooſing rather then they will forſake <hi>England</hi> to ſtuff <hi>New-gate, Bridewell,</hi> and other, Jayles with

            <p>I have ſeriouſly conſidered when I have (paſſing the ſtreets) heard the ſeveral Cryes, and noting the commmo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dities, and the worth of them they have carried and cryed up and down; how poſſibly a livelihood could be exacted out of them, as to cry Matches, Smal-coal, Blacking, Pen and Ink, Thred-laces, and a hundred more ſuch kinde of trifling merchandizes; then looking on the naſtineſſe of their linnen habits and bodies: I conclude it gain ſuffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cient could be raiſed out of them for ſubſiſtance; yet their manner of living was degenerate and baſe; and their con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dition to be far below the meaneſt ſervant in <hi>Virginia<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>

            <p>The other day, I ſaw a man heavily loaden with a burden of Faggots on his back, crying, Dry Faggots, Dry Faggots; he travailed much ground, bawled frequently, and ſweat with his burthen: but I ſaw none buy any, neer three houres I followed him, in which time he reſted, I en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tered into diſcourſe with him, offered him drink, which he thankfully accepted of (as deſirous to learn the miſtery of his trade) I enquired what he got by each burden when ſold? he anſwered me three pence: I further asked him what he uſually got a day? he replyed, ſome dayes nothing ſome dayes ſix pence; ſome time more, but ſeldome; me thought it was a pittifull life, and I admired how he could live on it; And yet it were dangerous to adviſe theſe wretches to better their conditions by travaile, for fear of the cry of, a ſpirit, a ſpirit.</p>

               <pb n="17" facs="tcp:118942:12"/>The country is not only plentifull but pleaſant and profitable, pleaſant in regard of the brightneſſe of the weather, the many delightfull rivers, on which the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>habitants are ſettled (every man almoſt living in ſight of a lovely river) the abundance of game, the extraordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nary good neighbour-hood and loving converſation they have one with the other.</p>
            <p>Pleaſant in their building, which although for moſt part they are but one ſtory beſides the loft, and built of wood, yet contrived ſo delightfull, that your ordinary houſes in England are not ſo handſome, for uſually the rooms are large, daubed and whitelimed, glazed &amp; flowered, and if not gl<gap reason="illegible" extent="1 letter">

            <p>The manner of living and trading there is thus, each man almoſt lives a free-holder, nothing but the value of 12. d. a year to be paid as rent, for every 50. Acrees of land; firing coſt nothing every man plants his own corne and neede take no care for bread: if any thing be bought, it is for comodity, exchanged preſently, or for a day, payment is uſuall made but once a year, and for that Bill taken (for accounts are not pleadable.)</p>

            <p>In a word, <hi>Virginia</hi> wants not good victual, wants not good diſpoſitions, and as God hath freely beſtowed it, they as freely impart with it, yet are there aſwel bad natures as good.</p>
            <p>The profit of the country is either by their la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bour, their ſtockes, or their trades.</p>
            <p>By their labours is produced corne and Tobacco, and all other growing proviſions, and this Tobacco however now low-rated, yet a good maintenance may be had out of it, (for they have nothing of neceſſity but cloathing to purchaſſe) or can this mean price of To<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bacco long hold, for theſe reaſons, Firſt that in Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land it is prohibited, next that they have attained of late thoſe ſorts equall with the beſt Spaniſh, Thirdly that the ſickneſſe in Holland is decreaſing, which hath been a great obſtruction to the ſail of Tobacco.</p>
            <p>And laſtly, that as the mulbery tree grows up, tobacco will be neglected and ſilke, flax, two ſtaple commo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dities generally fallen upon.</p>
            <p>Of the increaſe of cattle and hoggs, much advantage is made, by ſelling biefe, porke, and bacon, and butter <hi>&amp;c.</hi> either to ſhipping, or to ſend to the Barbadoes, and other Iſlands, and he is a very poor man that hath not ſometimes proviſion to put off.</p>
            <p>By trading with Indians for Skine, Beaver, Furres and other commodities oftentimes good profits are raiſed; The Indians are in abſolute ſubjection to the Engliſh, ſo that they both pay tribute to them and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive all their ſeverall king from them, and as one dies they repair to the Engliſh for a ſucceſſor ſo that

            <p>Several ways of advancement there are and imploy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments both for the learned and laborer, recreation for the gentry, traffique for the adventurer, congregations for the miniſtrie (and oh that God would ſtir, up the hearts of more to go over, ſuch as would teach good doctrine, and not paddle in faction, or ſtate matters; they could not want maintenance, they would find an aſſiſting, an imbracing, a conforming people.)</p>

and ſince Agent for <hi>Virginia</hi> to the then parliament, and laſtly in a condition of baniſhment, ſo that they knew not in thoſe ſtreights how to diſpoſe of themſelves.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Mary-land</hi> (my preſent ſubject) was courted by them as a refuge, the Lord Proprietor and his Governor ſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>licited to, and ſeveral addreſſes and treaties made for their admittance &amp; entertainment into that province, their conditions were pittied, their propoſitions were harkened to and agree on, which was that they ſhould have convenient portion of land aſſigned them, liber<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie of conſcience and priviledge to chooſe their owne officers, and hold courts within themſelves, all was granted them, they had a whole County of the richeſt land in the province aſigned them, &amp; ſuch as themſelves made choyce of, the conditions of plantations (ſuch as were common to all adventurers) were ſhewed and propounded to them, which they extreamly approved of, and nothing was in thoſe conditions exacted from them, but appeales to the Provincial court, quit-rents, and an oath of fidelitie to the Proprietor: An aſſembly was called thoroughout the whole Country after their comming over (conſiſting aſwell of themſelves as the reſt) and becauſe there were ſome few papiſts that firſt inhabited theſe themſelves, and others of being diffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rent judgments, an act paſſed that all profeſſing in Jeſus Chriſt ſhould have equall juſtice, priviledges and bene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fits in that province, and that none on penaltie (men<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tioned) ſhould diſturb each other in their ſeveral pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſſions, nor give the urging termes, either of Round<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>heads, ſectarie, Independent, Jeſuit, Papiſt, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tending an abſolute peace and union; the Oath of Fi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>delitie (although none other then ſuch as every Lord of a manner requires from his tenant) was over hauled, and this clauſe added to it (provided it in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fring not the libertie of the conſcience.)</p>

            <p>The governour (ſo reſtored) being truly informed that their proceedings were illegal; held Courts and proceeds as if no ſuch alteration had been made, iſſues out Writs (according to order) In the name of the Lord proprietor, but they require and command them to do it in the name of the Keepers of the Liberties of England, according to act of Parliament, to which an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwer ſufficient was given, that they never were in op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſition to the preſent power, they had taken the En<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gagement, &amp; for the tenure or form of writs, they were not compelled by vertue of that act to make them other wiſe then they always had done, for by Patent from the late K. they had power to iſſue out in the Proprietors name, and never had uſed the Kings name at all, there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore that act requiring all Writs formerly iſſuing out in the late Kings name, now to revolve to the Keepers of the Liberties of England, was no way binding to them, who had never uſed the kings name at all.</p>
            <p>But it was not religion, it was not punctilios they ſtood upon, it was that ſweete, that rich, that large Country they aimed at; and therefore agrees amongſt themſelves to frame petitions, complaints, and ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcriptions from thoſe bandetoes to themſelves (the

            <p>The Governor deſirous to reclaim thoſe oppoſing, takes a partie about 130. perſons with him, and ſailes into thoſe parts, one <hi>Roger Heamans</hi> who had a great ſhip under him, and who had promiſed to be inſtru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mentall to the governor, to wind up thoſe differences (being <hi>Judas</hi> like, hired to joyn with thoſe oppoſing Countries) and having the Governour and his veſſells within reach of his Ordnance, perfidiouſly &amp; contrary to his undertaking and ingagments, fires at them and enforces them to the firſt ſhore to prevent that miſchief.</p>

            <p>The Governour being ſhot in many places yeilds on quarter, which was granted; but being in hold, was threatned (notwithſtanding that quarter given) to be imediatly executed, unleſſe he would writ to the reſt to take quarter, which upon his requeſt they did, twentie odd were killed in this skirmiſh, and all the reſt priſoners on quarter, who were diſarmed &amp; taken into cuſtodie.</p>

            <p>A pious conſideration of theſe diſtractions is by his Highneſſe taking notice of, and theſe controverſies are by him referred to the Hearing, and Report of thoſe two Honourable and judicious Gentlemen the Lords <hi>Whitlock</hi> and <hi>Widdrington,</hi> whoſe Pains and Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deration in Hearing, and mildly diſputing indifferent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly the condition of theſe uproars, gives not onely hopes of relief, but have added to their renowns, by all thoſe that (as obſerved) have been preſent at the ſeverall Hearings, an account whereof will ere long be publiſhed in print.</p>
            <p>Upon determination whereof, it muſt be concluded that a ſettlement will follow, and then many families will flock over to inhabit theſe ruines, the fertility of the province will (in ſhort time) make good (except<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the blood ſpilt which can never be recalled nor ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tisfied for.)</p>

            <p>And being ſo ſetled, I know no country (although I have travelled many) that I more affect, more eſteem, that which profits delights, and here is both abſolute profit, reall delight; I ſhall forget my undertaking in the beginning of my booke, which was not to over ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tall the Country: for ſhould I indeed give it its due commendations, I ſhould ſeem to be ſuborn'd; but in few words, it is that Country in which I deſire to ſpend the remnant of my dayes, in which I covet to make my grave.</p>
            <p>This I have not written for profit, for it is known I have given away the copy, and therefore am the leſs to be miſtruſted for a deluder, for popular applauſe I did it not, for in this pregnant age, my lines appear ſo harſh and diſordered, that I would not have affixed my name to it, but in obedience to thoſe commands that ſo require it, and to prevent the imputation of a libeller, the maine drift and ſcope I have herein aim<gap reason="illegible" extent="1 letter">

            <p>AS I have done your Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>try of <hi>Virginia</hi> juſtice in ſtanding up in its defence, ſo I expect and entreat the like from you: I know ye are honeſt and underſtand your ſelves; I cannot except nor ſpeake a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt any of ye, but <hi>Will. Clai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>borne,</hi> whom ye all know to be a Villaine, but it is no more blemiſh to your degree, to have him of your ſocietie, then it was to the Apoſtles to have Iudas of theirs, I have had in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jury by him by palpable couſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nages done me, as I ſhal one day demonſtrate. But for the de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cree

of your court againſt one Captaine <hi>Thomas Thorough<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>good,</hi> late Commander of the Shipp <hi>Creſſent.</hi> I deſire you to conſider of it again and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſe it for theſe reaſons fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowing.</p>
            <p>I was an inhabitant of <hi>Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry-land</hi> of two years ſtanding, proſcribe to die by the rebells of the Bay. I fled diſguiſed to <hi>Virginia,</hi> came a bord his Ship by an unknowne name, made my condition, not my perſon known to him, and he charita<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bly brought me for <hi>England,</hi> otherewiſe I had cauſlesly been put to death. For which letters certifies us in <hi>England,</hi> that ye have amerſed him in deep <hi>pen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>alties,</hi> by an acted of Aſſembly made againſt maſters or Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manders
<pb n="31" facs="tcp:118942:19"/>

            <p>Firſt, know I was no inha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bitant of <hi>Virginia,</hi> but <hi>Mary-land,</hi> a government ye have no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing to doe with.</p>
            <p>Next I came with my Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernours conſent, Captaine <hi>William Stone</hi> who in <hi>England</hi> juſtifies Captain <hi>Thoroughgoods</hi> bringing me home: and here I muſt and will abide ſuch cen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure or vindication as the ſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preame power of <hi>England</hi> ſhall find me to have merited; and therfore I humbly requeſt ye to peruſe and reverſe that or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der againſt him for bringing me for <hi>England.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>I ſhall hereafter give ſuch an account to <hi>Virginia</hi> of my a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctions

from time to time, that they ſhall be fully ſatisfied; I never deſerved the leaſt injurie either from any Government, nor any private perſon, ſince I firſt inhabited there. But that ſhall be a ſubject particular: and a peece not uſefull in <hi>Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land,</hi> but only to ſcatter in <hi>Vir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginia</hi> amongſt my friends, whoſ good opinion I covet, and that they may know in many odi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ums I have been wronged, and that I am the man that have ſeene affliction.</p>
