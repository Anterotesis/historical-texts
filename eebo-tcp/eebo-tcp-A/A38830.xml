            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

               <p>IF thou ſhalt find any one who doth not as yet be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leive
the Goſpel, what wilt thou do when he
ſhall ſay unto thee I do not beleive? But nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
had I beleived the Goſpel unleſs I had been
thereunto moved by the Authority of the Catholick
Church: Thoſe therefore to whom I ſubmitted, when
they required me to beleive the Goſpel, why ſhould
I not alſo yield Obedience unto them when they di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rect
me not to beleive <hi>Manichaeus?</hi> Take your
choice; If you tell me I muſt beleive the Catholicks,
they give me Advice not to give Credit to you, and
therefore if I beleive them I cannot but refuſe to be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leive
you. If you tell me I muſt not beleive the Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tholicks;
you proceed ill, when you go about by the
Goſpel to perſwade me to beleive <hi>Manichaeus,</hi> be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe
it was from the Preachings of the Catholicks
<pb facs="tcp:96565:3"/>
that I beleived the Goſpel it ſelf. If you tell me I
did well when I beleived the Catholicks prayſing the
Goſpel, but I do ill when I beleive the ſame perſons
decrying <hi>Manichaeus,</hi> do you take me to be ſo ſtu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pid
as without any Reaſon given unto me I ſhould be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leive
or disbeleive what you pleaſe? &amp;c. But if
you have any Reaſon to offer unto me, lay aſide the
Goſpel; if you hold your ſelf to the Goſpel I ſhall
adhere to thoſe upon whoſe commands I beleived the
Goſpel, and ſo long as I Obey them I ſhall not be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leive
you. But if by Accident you ſhould find any
thing in the Goſpel moſt evidently touching the Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtleſhip
of <hi>Manichaeus,</hi> you will weaken the Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thority
of the Catholicks in my eſteem who require me
not to beleive you, but that being weakned I ſhall not
beleive the Goſpel, becauſe I beleive that by them;
ſo that whatſoever you bring from the Goſpel will be
of no force with me. Wherefore if nothing be found in
the Goſpel for the manifeſtation of <hi>Manichaeus</hi> his
Apoſtleſhip, I ſhall rather give credit to the Catho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>licks
then you. But if any thing ſhall be there found
manifeſt on the behalf of <hi>Manichaeus,</hi> I ſhall nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
beleive them nor you: Not them, becauſe they told
me a Lye of you; nor ſhall I beleive you, becauſe you
urge that Scripture to me which I beleived upon their
Authority who told me a Lye in relation to you.</p>

ſpread concerning me, and of my change
and Alteration in the great Affair of Religion,
put you upon an Expectation to hear ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing
from me; and that in Print too: It
having been my conſtant former Method to
give an account of my ſelf to the World that way. And although
I might very well excuſe my ſelf from the ſame thing now, that
ſcribling humor being only in the dayes of my Ignorance; when
God Almighty pleaſed to permit a Veil to hang between my
eyes and his moſt glorious Truth, Namely the veile of my Pride,
and Folly: Yet leaſt from a total ſilence, the world which in its
own Nature is cenſorious enough, ſhould apprehend, that I either
wanted Charity to my late dear Breathren, or Courage to own the
Truth, or that I thought the way unjuſtifiable, wherein I now
Worſhip and Adore the God of my Fathers, theſe good and Pi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous
men, who until the pretended Reformation of <hi>Luther</hi> and
his Followers, knew no other way of Worſhip or Religion, then
this, by which Millions of them were ſent into the Boſome of
Chriſt. I have at laſt reſolved to give you a ſhort accompt of my
ſelf, and what hath befallen me ſince the Happy Reſtauration of
our moſt Gracious Soveraign to his Crown and Dignities.</p>
            <p>And indeed when I conſider the Love which I have ever had
for you, and the returns of Affection, which I have received
from many, and moſt of you; I think my ſelf more then ordina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rily
Engaged, to be free with you in theſe things, as hoping, and
in Charity believing, that if I can Convince you of the reaſona<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bleneſs
of my Proceedings, you will approve of what I have done;
And on the other ſide, if any of you can make it appear, wherein
I have done amiſs, you will be ſo juſt (and this Juſtice I here
challenge from you) as to ſhew me my Errors.</p>
            <p>My carriage whilſt I was in Communion with you, was (I
hope) alwaies ſuch, as to give you a ſufficient reaſon to beleive
that I neither was, nor am byaſſable by Worldly Intereſts, and
<pb n="2" facs="tcp:96565:4"/>
ſelfiſh Conſiderations? When I profeſt my ſelf againſt Infant
Baptiſme, I had run through almoſt (if not altogether) all the
ſeveral Profeſſions of Ch<gap reason="illegible" resp="#OXF" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>iſtianity then appearing in this King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome,
the Catholique only excepted, which as I never had any
oppertunity to examine, as not meeting with any of that party
who were willing to publiſh themſelves to me for ſuch, ſo nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
did I think them, or their Principles worthy my Conſidera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion,
having from the joynt and unanimous conſent of all our
Pulpits, beleived thoſe of that party to be ſo groſly ignorant,
that to diſcourſe with them in relation to Religion, were but to
caſt away time and labour.</p>
            <p>Being thus prejudiced againſt the Catholique party, it pleaſed
Almighty God to bring me into the company of a Lay Gentle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man
of that perſwaſion, and to give me occaſion to ſpend ſome
conſiderable time with him: I no ſooner underſtood his Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſſion
as to Religion, but I began to attempt him, in that where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in
I thought (as conſcious of the weakneſs of his cauſe) he would
never have engaged; but I ſoon found my miſtake by his readi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs
to embrace diſcourſes of that nature. And I found alſo, that
we had all embraced a moſt notorious Error, while we ſuffered
our ſelves to be perſwaded, that the Catholickes were an Igno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rant
Generation.</p>
            <p>The Gentleman ſeemed deſirous to examine every thing from
the bottome, and to lay the Ax to the Root, and truly I thought
that very reaſonable, as conceiving that where the foundation
was unſound, the ſuperſtructures were not to be relyed on: He
enquired of me therefore in the firſt place, whether I was ſure &amp;
certain that the Chriſtian Religion in general was more true,
then the Religions of the Turks, Jews, or any other, which was
oppoſite thereunto? and whether I was ſo certainly, and infalli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bly
aſſured of this; that it was not poſſible for me, or for thoſe
who taught me Chriſtianity, to be miſtaken in this? And he
gave me this Reaſon for his Queſtion, namely, that if neither I
my ſelf, nor thoſe who taught me that Chriſtianity was the only
ſafe way to Salvation, and the only way in which Heaven was to
be attained, was infallibly certain, or were capable of
any miſtake, or might in any poſſibility commit an errour in this
thing; then as to me, Chriſtianity could be no more, <hi>then proba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bly</hi>
               <pb n="3" facs="tcp:96565:4"/>
true; and we could with no colour of Reaſon, condemn the
Jew, Turk, or Pagan, ſince they were as well perſwaded of their
ſeveral waies, as we could be of ours, upon a fallible certainty;
and for ought we knew (not having any infallible certainty for
our Chriſtianity) ſome of them might be in the Right, and we in
the wrong way. And how could you ſay to a Jew, you muſt be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come
a Chriſtian, if you expect to be ſaved, when as if he Exa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mine
you ſtrictly and cloſely in relation to what certaitny you
have of the truth of Chriſtianity, your Anſwer will amount to no
more then this, <hi>You conceive you are in the Right, and you hope and
beleive you are not miſtaken: But it is poſſible you may be miſtaken
in this; for every man is a Lyar, every man and all men, and every
Church is fallible, and ſubject to Error, and to be miſtaken.</hi> Can
ſuch Arguments as theſe invite a Jew or Turk to become a Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtian?</p>
            <p>I confeſs I was extreamly troubled with this firſt difficulty,
and knew not how to anſwer it plainly, and without apparent
ſhuffling, and declining the queſtion, which I plainly did, by ur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ging,
that if he intended to call the Religion which Chriſt Eſta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bliſhed
in the world into queſtion, and to make a doubt of the
mayn and Grand Principle of Chriſtianity, which we both of us
agreed to be true, I ſhould treat no farther; and that if himſelf
doubted of the Truth of Chriſts Religion, I was not prepared to
Diſpute the point.</p>
            <p>This Anſwer ſeemed very ſtrange even to my ſelf, but it ſee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med
more ſtrange to me, that I ſhould find my ſelf Gravelled in
ſuch a queſtion as was fit for every one to anſwer. However my
Opponent uſed me Gently and Sweetly, and without the leaſt
ſhew of inſulting over my weakneſs, he told me that in reaſon I
ought to anſwer this difficulty; for (replied he) though it may
be true, and is moſt certainly true, that the Chriſtian Religion,
upon the true Grounds upon which it is founded, is infallibly
certain and Divine; yet upon the Grounds upon which you may
found your beleif thereof, it may poſſibly not be true or certain as
to you: for example, ſuppoſe you are told a thing by a known or
common perjured perſon, and upon his word you beleive it, you
cannot be certainly aſſured that the thing is true, becauſe ſuch
an Infamous, common notorious Lyer tells you ſo, but the thing
<pb n="4" facs="tcp:96565:5"/>
is really to you doubtful, nay more probably falſe then true, and
yet the thing in it ſelf is true: ſo if in the Apoſtles
times one had beleived Chriſtianity to be true, not becauſe the
Apoſtles taught him ſo, but becauſe <hi>Simon Magus</hi> affirmed it to
him, in this caſe who ſees not that ſuch a mans faith had not
been true but that the whole thing to him had been uncertain,
the belief of it being grounded upon a wrong Foundation, which
was no waies certain? From all which it is evident that no He<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>retick
can have true Faith, this I ſhall farther prove, in regard the
contrary is an error broached publikely by Mr. <hi>Baxter</hi> in his
Treatiſe againſt Mr. <hi>William Iohnſon,</hi>
               <note place="margin">This is ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken out of Mr. <hi>John<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons</hi> reply to Mr. <hi>Baxter,</hi> called <hi>Novelty Repreſſed,</hi> Fo. 142. 143 &amp;c.</note> who hath fully ſilenced Mr.
<hi>Baxter</hi> beyond all poſſibility of replying with reaſon in relation
to this perticular, the proof which <hi>I</hi> give is in this Argument.
Whoſoever hath true Faith, beleiveth the thing beleived, or the
material object of Faith for the Divine Authority of God revea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling
it. But no Heretick beleiveth ſo. Therefore no Heretick
hath true Faith. The Major is granted by all, becauſe Chriſtian
Faith muſt reſt upon Gods Revelation, as its formal object. The
Minor is proved thus, whoſoever beleives the material object of
Faith, or the thing beleived, for the Divine Authority of God
revealing it, muſt beleive all things which are as ſufficiently pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pounded
to him, to be revealed by God, as are thoſe Articles,
which he doth beleive. And muſt beleive nothing as a Revelati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
of God, which is as ſufficiently declared to him to be errone<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous,
or not a Revelation, as the Articles of Faith are to be revea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led.
But every Heretick either refuſeth to beleive ſomething,
which is ſo ſufficiently propounded to him to be revealed from
God, or beleives ſomething, as a Revelation, which is ſo ſuffici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ently
declared to him to be erroneous, or not revealed from
God; Therefore no Heretick hath true Faith. The firſt part of
this Major is proved thus: Whoſoever refuſeth to beleive, what
is ſo ſufficiently propounded to be revealed by God, either refu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeth
all, that is ſo propounded, or beleives ſome things, and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fuſeth
to beleive others as ſufficiently propounded, as thoſe
which he beleives: If he refuſeth all, he can have no true Faith,
for he belives nothing, and is therefore no Chriſtian: If he be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leives
ſome, and refuſeth others equally propounded, then he
<pb n="5" facs="tcp:96565:5"/>
beleives not thoſe things, which he doth beleive for the Divine
Authority revealing, (for when two things are equally propoun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded
to the underſtanding, they ought to worke equally upon it)
but upon his own wilful choice or private judgement refuſeth
ſome, and aſcents to others. As to the ſecond part of the afore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſaid
Major, <hi>viz.</hi> That no man can have true Chriſtian Faith, who
beleives any thing as a Revelation, which is as ſufficiently pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pounded
to him to be Erroneous, as the Articles by him belei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved,
are propounded to be Revelations; the very ſame Authori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty
which affirms the one, denying the other: Suppoſe the ſame
Authority acknowledged doth ſufficiently propound to a Calve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſt
the Articles of Faith, as revealed from God, and at the ſame
time aſſures him, that his conceit of the Popes being the great
Antichriſt was never revealed from God, but is a manifeſt error
in Faith: In this caſe our Calveniſt muſt disbeleive that propoun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding
Authority, and thereby loſe his Faith in the former Arti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cles
by him beleived, and have no true faith in the firſt; or he
muſt beleive the ſame Authority in the ſecond becauſe it is the
ſame Authority in both<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> For that very Authority which pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pounds
the Articles of Faith, as revealed of God, propounds the
other as not revealed, and as contrary to Gods Revelation. By
all which it is moſt evident, that if your Faith be built upon a
wrong Foundation, it is of no value, nor doth it give you any cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainty,
nor is it indeed Faith, but Humor and Opinion.</p>
            <p>This Diſcourſe ſeemed to me ſo convincing; that I could not
but agree unto it; and therfore I told him as a full anſwer to his
firſt queſtion, that I embraced Chriſtianity, and that ſort of
Chriſtianity to which I adheared in oppoſition to all others, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe
the Scriptures which are Gods Word, taught me ſo to do,
and that I beleived the Scriptures to be Gods word from the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fallible
teſtimony of Gods ſpirit, bearing witneſs with my ſpirit,
that they were Gods Words; and that I was fully convinced,
that this proceeded from the infallible teſtimony of Gods ſpirit,
from a certain knowledge and feeling which I had of the ſame
within my ſelf, and in my own Conſcience.</p>
            <p>To all which it was mildly replyed, that upon the Grounds
which I had laid, and whereon I founded my ſelf, it was impoſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble
for me, to be infallibly aſſured, that this teſtimony which I
<pb n="6" facs="tcp:96565:6"/>
mentioned was infallibly the teſtimony of the ſpirit of God: For
having granted the Proteſtant Principle, that <hi>I was not infallible,</hi>
that <hi>no man or number of men was or were infallible;</hi> this ſpirit
which I talked of, might (for ought I knew) be the ſpirit of er<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ror.
And for farther evincing thereof, I was deſired to reflect on
theſe Scriptures, Jer. 17. 9. <hi>The heart of Man is deceitful above
all things, who can know it?</hi> Eccleſ. 9. 1. <hi>No man knoweth Love
or Hatred by all that is before them.</hi> And to conſider the ſtrange
deluſion, which bewitched the Angel, or Biſhop of <hi>Laodicea,</hi>
Revel. 3. 17. <hi>Becauſe thou ſayeſt I am Rich and encreaſed with
goods, and have need of nothing, and knoweſt not that thou art wret<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ched,
and miſerable, and poor, and blind, and naked.</hi> How much
was he deceived in his own jupgement of his own Eſtate! In fine
what would you (ſaid he) anſwer to an Arrian, or Jew, or Turk,
ſhould they urge the like knowledge, and feeling, with the like
confidence, to prove they were in the truth, and Chriſtianity a
deluſion? What you would reply to them, ſuppoſe as ſaid unto
your ſelf, and ſee if it will not ſatisfie.</p>
            <p>In the mean time (ſaid he) you ſeem to imply and ſo to grant
that we ought to have an infallible certainty of what we beleive
with Divine Faith; this the Apoſtles had in the time of our bleſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed
Saviours converſing with them upon earth, they had ſuffici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ent
to prevail with their wills, to command their underſtandings
into the beleif of his being God conſequently infallible, and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſequently
that whatſoever he taught was to be aſſented unto as
infallibly true, without being queſtioned by our little feeble li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mited
Reaſons. And this was neceſſary for the Church then, o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>therwiſe
they could not have been ſufficiently aſſured that what
Chriſt taught them was true, conſequently it would not have
been a ſin in them to have doubted. This infallible aſſurance al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſo
the Chriſtians who lived in the Apoſtles times, and after the
Aſcenſion of our Lord, enjoyed; they had ſufficient to enduce
them to a beleif, that the Holy Apoſtles were infallible guides
and reachers; and that whatſoever they taught and commanded
them, was as infallible true, as if God had immediately ſpoken
to them the ſame things, and no more to be doubted, contradi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cted,
or diſputed againſt by their reaſons (which doubtleſs were
as good and ſtrong as ours) then the immediate words, com<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>mands,
<pb n="7" facs="tcp:96565:6"/>
or dictates of Almighty God; otherwiſe thoſe who refu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed
to hear and obey them had been in no fault, and it would have
been an unſufferable Pride and preſumption in St. <hi>Paul</hi> to have
required ſuch an abſolute ſubmiſſion to what he taught, as to ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lige
the Chriſtians of his time not to have beleived an Angel
from Heaven teaching contrary to what he taught them. Hence
it is, that the remaining writings (for ſo much as we have of
them) of the Bleſſed Apoſtles, are by all Chriſtians eſteemed, as
the Words of God. And this was neceſſary in the Age after
Chriſt for the Church of God, namely in the Apoſtles times, to
have a living infallible way of direction, in ſo much as had we
then lived, and had encountred with any doubts or difficulties
relating to Religion, and to the true meaning of what was either
ſpoken or written by any Apoſtle, or by all the Apoſtles, we
ſhould without all doubt have made our immediate recourſe to
them, ſome or one of them, for the ſolving of ſuch doubts, and
the explayning of ſuch difficulties; and ſhould have received and
ſubmitted unto ſuch ſolutions as made by God himſelf, without
ever interpoſing our own reaſons or ſenſes in oppoſition. This
we ſee was the courſe taken in the fifteenth of the Acts<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> when
certain doubts were ariſen amongſt Chriſtians, the Apoſtles met
in a Council they conſidered the things, they determined with
an <hi>It ſeemeth good unto the Holy Ghoſt and to us.</hi> Their Decrees
and Canons were obeyed, and ſubmitted unto by the whole, and
the Diſputes were at an end. But ſuppoſe ſome diſpute had ari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſen
touching the ſence and meaning even of ſome of thoſe De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crees,
muſt not it have been interprited by ſome judicial Autho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity?
Doubtleſs yes. And queſtionleſs the then Chriſtians would
have appealed or applyed to the ſame Authority that made thoſe
Canons and Decrees, for the interpretation of them, and would
have ſubmitted to ſuch interpretations; otherwiſe it would have
been with the Primative Chriſtians then, as it is with you now,
every one would have framed his own interpretation, thoſe who
had been Maſters of the greateſt Wit, power, or intereſt, would
have framed Parties or Churches to themſelves; and in fine the
Sword of the Fleſh and not the Spirit of God muſt have given the
Rule and Law to Chriſtianity, they would have been ſo far from
any poſſibility of maintaining <hi>The Unity of the ſpirit in the bond of
<pb n="8" facs="tcp:96565:7"/>
Peace,</hi> from being <hi>One body,</hi> that they would have divided into
as many parts (to ſpeak without grateing) as you now are, and
have gone to Cuffs, and raiſed Wars for the decideing of Contro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſies,
as we have ſeen you do ſince you divided your ſelves from
the Holy Catholick Church of Chriſt.</p>
            <p>It is not hard for you to imagine into what confuſion theſe
Diſcourſes put my poor ſoul, to hear ſuch things, ſo great eviden<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces
of Reaſon produced by a private Gentleman of that party,
whom I had beleived ſo ignorant. I had oftentimes in Diſputati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons,
both publickly and privately encountred, and (I thought)
worſted ſeveral of the Engliſh Clergy in thoſe points wherein I
differed from them. But I found nothing now to ſay againſt theſe
Principles, which I had yet hitherto ſuppoſed the moſt ridicu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lous,
that any people could imagine to ſet up.<note place="margin">The Books which I here in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tend are. <hi>The Que<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtion of Queſtions, the before mentioned Novelty repreſſed with</hi> Fiat Lux, <hi>and that Ela<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>borate Trea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiſe called</hi> Infidelity Unmasked or a Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>futation of a Book Publiſhed by Mr. <hi>Wil. Chil. Fagworth.</hi>
               </note> Well I could no
longer conteſt, but reſolved to have recourſe unto Almighty God
by Prayer for his Divine Aſſiſtance, and to make it my buſineſs
according to the utmoſt of my poor skill and underſtanding, to
take a full view of the Grand Principles of the Catholick Faith,
and of Chriſtianity; and laying aſide all Prejudices, Pride, and
Humour, I reſolved by the aſſiſtance of God to embrace and ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mit
unto whatſoever I ſhould underſtand to be moſt agreeable
with his moſt holy will and pleaſure, without taking any regard
to worldly intereſt, or the cenſures of men, which I had reaſon to
beleive would run high againſt me. And the better to enable me
in this ſearch and examination, I borrowed from this Gentleman
ſeveral books and treatiſes, from whence I made ſeveral Collecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons,
the Heads of which I recommend to your conſiderations,
they being ſuch, as had (by the Gracious aſſiſtance of Almighty
God) ſuch a prevailing power upon my underſtanding, as to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vince
me of the errors of the way, wherein I then was, and to
bring me to the Knowledge of the Divine truths of the Catholick
and Chriſtian Faith.</p>
            <p>I gathered from the true interpretation of that Text of Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture,
Heb. 11. 6. <hi>Without Faith it is impoſſible to pleaſe God.</hi> And
of that Mar. 16. 16. <hi>He that beleiveth not, ſhall be damned.</hi> And
of that other Epheſ. 4. 5. <hi>There is but one Faith, and one Baptiſme,
one Lord Ieſus.</hi> That the faith which was to ſave me, and by the
which I was to pleaſe God, muſt certainly be the <hi>true Faith,</hi>
               <pb n="9" facs="tcp:96565:7"/>
which cannot be found in contrary Opinions, it being but <hi>One<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
               </hi>
and of contraries, One only can be true. I alſo collected from
that Text, 2. Cor. 10. 5. <hi>Bringing into Captivity every thought,
to the Obedience of Chriſt,</hi> That this <hi>Faith</hi> or beleiving was to be
ſeated in the underſtanding, that the underſtanding was to ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mit,
not diſpute. And that this Act <hi>To beleive,</hi> was a Command
or Precept of Almighty God, who will have his Will obeyed by
all his Subjects, and the not obeying of which is puniſhed with
eternal Damnation. Laſtly I found from that Text Heb. 10. 23.
<hi>Let us hold faſt the profeſſion of our Faith without wavering, for he
is faithful that hath promiſed.</hi> That Faith, if truly Divine, muſt
be an infallible aſſent of our underſtanding, ſubmitting it ſelf obe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diently
to beleive the Revelations of God. For otherwiſe Faith
and conſequently all Religion, may be no more then fancy, or
Opinion, and then no waies certain, and if ſo, then no Obliga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion.</p>
            <p>From whence I thought it did very naturally follow, firſt that
there muſt be ſome means appointed by God, by which we may
know this one true Faith from all falſe Opinions for to require us
to beleive upon pain of Damnation, and not to give us any means
whereby we may know what to beleive, were to require us to
make Bricks without Straw. Secondly that theſe means muſt be
infallible, for we cannot be brought to an infallible aſcent by fal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lible
and uncertain means, and God would not require us to aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent
to an Authority which may deceive us. Thirdly, that the
underſtanding muſt ſubmit to theſe means under pain of Damna<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion;
for if the underſtanding were at liberty to ſubmit, or not to
ſubmit, to the means by which Faith is conveyed unto us, it
would be no fault not to beleive, conſequently God could not
juſtly damne us for not beleiving. Beſides, whoſoever ſhall re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fuſe
to be governed by their means, and that Authority which
God hath appointed to govern him, is a Rebel againſt God.
Fourthly, that two men of two differing Faiths or beliefs cannot
be ſaved: for they both of them, knowing that they are bound to
be guided and governed by thoſe means which God hath appoin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted
to convey faith unto them, and one of them flatly refuſing to
ſubmit, this perſon who refuſeth, muſt be guilty of diſobedience
to Gods command, and conſequently cannot be ſaved. Fifthly,
<pb n="10" facs="tcp:96565:8"/>
that ignorant people by ſuch reaſonable diligence, as is very tol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lerable
to humane frailty, and very poſſible for them may come
to the knowledge of theſe means. For otherwiſe God would
have appointed means which would be unprofitable to the end,
and the far greater number of Souls for whom Chriſt dyed, would
not be ſufficiently provided for; by the ſweet Providence of God.
By which that Propheſy would be ineffectual, Eſay. 35. <hi>Say to
them that are of a fearful heart, be ſtrong, fear not, behold your God
will come and ſave you, then the eyes of the blind ſhall be opened and
the Ears of the deaf unſtopped, &amp;c. And one high way ſhall be there,
and a way, and it ſhall be called the Holy way, the way faring men,
though Fooles ſhall not err therein.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>And thus far I met with nothing but what I eſteemed very a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>greeable
with all ſorts of people, profeſſing themſelves Chriſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans.
All that I ever met with ſeemed to grant that there muſt
be a way, and a Rule; there muſt be means appointed, there muſt
be a governing power to judge and decide all doubts, and teach
us the true way to Heaven with certainty. But <hi>who this Rule or
Iudge is,</hi> that is the difficulty, for when once we have found it, I
think all perſons will agree that they are obliged to ſubmit unto
it, as to the Apoſtles if they were actually living, or to Chriſt
himſelf: This therefore I thought to be the only queſtion that I
was to gain ſatisfaction unto: I therefore ceaſed to enquire af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
this doctrine, or the other Article, as beleiving, that if I could
once find out this Rule, this Judge which God had appointed as
the means to direct me, and to which I was to ſubmit, as to that
Authority which God had appointed to Rule and Govern me, to
teach me what I was, and what I was not to beleive; I ſhould no
more ſcruple to beleive what that Authority ſhould teach me to
be revealed by God, then if I heard God himſelf ſpeaking: And
I was no way diſcouraged in my reſolution to ſearch, when I
conſidered, that as God ſpoke in Antient times by the mouthes
of his Prophets, before and after the Scriptures were written; and
by the mouthes of his Apoſtles before, and after the New Teſta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
was written; and that the writing of what God directed
to be written, did not leſſen the power of God, but that he might
ſtill direct by<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> the mouthes of his Prophets, and Apoſtles, ſo poſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſibly
I might find God ſtill ſpeaking by an Authority, which hi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>therto
I had not been acquainted with.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="11" facs="tcp:96565:8"/>
I found all the Rules and meanes propoſed by every party to
amount to four in the whole. One party would ſet up a claim to
the Spirit directing them, and ſpeaking to their ſpirits. Another
will have Reaſon to be this Rule and Judge. A third will ſet up
ſole Scripture. And the fourth aſſigneth the Holy Catholick
Church of Chriſt Viſible here on Earth, to be that Judge and Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rector.
And finally that medium appoynted by God himſelf for
the ends before mentioned, and to which all Chriſtians were to
ſubmit. Other then theſe I never heard of any, for I alwaies e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſteemed
the <hi>Quakers</hi> Light to be either the Spirit or natural Rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon,
and I reſolved to rank it under one of thoſe conſiderations
by a name more known to the world, then that which they have
given it. And therefore theſe I reſolved moſt carefully to exa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mine.</p>
            <p>As to the firſt touching the Spirit, bearing witneſs in ſecret
with our ſpirits, or in plainer terms <hi>the Private Spirit,</hi> I conſide<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red
that there is no man in the world Jew or Turk, Pagan or
Chriſtian, but may (if he will put on confidence enough) affirme
that he is taught inwardly by God; many of all ſorts do this and
yet teach contradictions, ſome therefore muſt be deceived, ther<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
this not the Rule. Nor hath this any effect amongſt thoſe
who pretend it, for by this none of them ever as yet reconciled
any differences, but each pretender grows perverſe and obſtinate,
and ſeperates from all who pretend to have the ſpirit as well as
himſelf, and ſo endleſs Hereſies<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> and Schiſms ariſe without any
poſſibility to allay them, or for either the Learned, or the Ignorant
to judge which of theſe bold pretenders hath a true ſpirit: In the
mean time it will not (poſſibly) be hard for a ſober man to find
that they are all of them governed by the Spirit of Error, who
pretend thus audaciouſly, if he conſiders well the Rule which St.
<hi>Iohn</hi> gives for diſcerning the ſpirit of truth from the ſpirit of error.
1 <hi>Ioh. 4. 6. v. We are of God, he that knoweth God heareth us, he
that is not of God heareth not us: Hereby know we the Spirit of
Truth from the Spirit of Error.</hi> As if he ſhould have ſaid, Chriſt
hath placed Apoſtles, and Teachers, and Doctors, to govern and
teach his Church, we are thoſe, and therefore of God; therefore
whoever pretends to know the Will of God, muſt hear and obey
and ſubmit unto us, or it is evident what he ſaith, is but a pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tence,
<pb n="12" facs="tcp:96565:9"/>
and he doth not indeed know God, nor is he of God; for
if he did know God, or were of God, he would certainly hear us.
Here therefore is your Rule to know true from falſe ſpirits: The
ſpirit of truth is alwaies remaining with that Authority which
God hath placed in the World, to teach truth to the world, and
bring them to the Faith; and all that are actuated and lead by
this ſpirit, are taught by it to ſubmit to this Authority, and to
hear thoſe whom God hath ſent and doth ſend by this Authority,
ſince <hi>Faith</hi> only <hi>comes by hearing</hi> thoſe who are truly ſent; but
the ſpirit of error is a ſpirit of Pride, which refuſeth to ſubmit to
that Authority which God hath ſet up, and <hi>heaping to themſelves
Teachers, having itching eares, turn away their ears from the
Truth,</hi> 1 Tim. 4. <hi>v.</hi> 3. 4. By this I ſaw, that although the Rule
and the Judge, which I looked for, muſt have the aſſiſtance and
influence of the Holy Ghoſt, the Spirit of Truth, yet it could not
be every private man or woman who laid claim to ſuch influen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces,
and who could no more ſatisfie another that they are guided
by the Spirit of Truth, then many who are caſt into Bedlam for
affirming themſelves to be God, can evince themſelves to be ſo,
and whoſe affirmations (for ought I know) are as concluding as
the other. In this therefore I was ſatisfied.</p>
            <p>The next thing which I conſidered was <hi>Reaſon,</hi> which I found
could not poſſibly be this Rule and Judge that I ſought for, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe
firſt, it was to ſubmit as a Subject and Vaſſall to that Rule
and Judge, therefore it could not be it. Secondly, it was falli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble,
and ſtrangely apt to miſtake, which is againſt the Nature of
this Rule and Judge to be; For if God ſhould obliege us upon
pain of damnation to ſubmit unto, and to be governed &amp; ruled by
an Authority that might deceive us, and might teach us that for a
truth which is not, we ſhould be bound to beleive that for true
which is not ſo, and yet be damned for not beleiving the truth.</p>
            <p>Thirdly if Reaſon were to be this Rule and Judge, then it
would follow contrary to the Scripture, that <hi>it is not impoſſible to
pleaſe God without Faith,</hi> for Reaſon would teach us ſufficiently
how to pleaſe God, yea it would be a breach of this rule to be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leive
what we do not underſtand, and then every Religion would
be the truth, conſequently contradictions would be true, conſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quently
there would be many Religions, and not only not one
<pb n="13" facs="tcp:96565:9"/>
faith but no faith at all; for there is ſcarce a man living but his
reaſon differs from anothers, underſtandings and judgements
differing as much as Faces, and Reaſon excludes faith: There<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
no one that followes his own Reaſon could in juſtice be
condemned by God, conſequently all men would be ſaved, un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſs
peradventure you will ſay, that in a buſineſs of ſuch conſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quence,
as the ſalvation of our ſouls, our private Reaſon per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwades
us to prefer the Authority of ſuch as are wiſer then our
ſelves before our own judgements, which is moſt true; But then
I inferr that Roman Catholicks are the moſt rational people in
the world, and conſequently have the beſt Religion as acting
moſt conformably to Reaſon; for they rely upon the Authority
of General Councels, conſiſting of the ableſt and moſt Learned
men of all Nations, which is the greateſt Authority to be found
on earth, eſpecially if they have the aſſiſtance of the Holy Ghoſt,
as it appears they have both by the teſtimony of Scripture, and
the conſtant tradition of all Ages. Laſtly, that would probably
be the truth, and the true faith to one man this year, which ſeven
years hence would be an error, and a falſe faith, to the ſame per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon;
for in ſuch a compaſs of time a mans reaſon hath ſuch an
alteration. Upon theſe grounds I concluded, that certainly God
in his good Providence, had appointed a more ſure Guide, Rule
and Judge to bring me to the infallible faith of Chriſtianity, then
my own Reaſon.</p>
            <p>The next thing in order to be conſidered, was the Scriptures,
whether theſe were ſolely ſufficient to teach us the true Faith,
and from time to time to direct Rule and Govern us, and to be
this Rule and Jude, to whoſe ſentence and determination, to
whoſe directions and Authority all were to ſubmit, and which
was to ſupply unto us the place of Chriſt and the Apoſtles. And
indeed I found this highly contended for, and ſeveral Reaſons
urged for it.</p>
            <p>Firſt the words of our Saviour, Joh. 5. 39. <hi>Search the Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures,
for in them ye think ye have Eternal Life, and they are they
which teſtify of me.</hi> But to this I found ſeveral anſwers given,
which to me were a ſatisfaction. For firſt, it doth not appear whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
this in the Original be the Imparative or Indicative Mood.
St. <hi>Ciril</hi> with whom <hi>Beza</hi> agrees, takes it in the Indicative
<pb n="14" facs="tcp:96565:10"/>
Mood, and then the ſence runs thus; You do ſearch the Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures,
becauſe in them you have an Opinion that you have Eter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal
Life, and yet even thoſe Scriptures are ſo far from being
againſt me, that they teſtify of me; ſo that I ſhall be no waies
prejudiced if I ſhould joyne iſſue with you, and try my cauſe by
your own Rule. And in this ſence they are ſo far from proving
what they are produced for, that they prove directly the contra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry;
they are ſo far from being a command to all to read, or
ſearch, or make Scripture the ſole Rule and Judge, that they
rather ſeem a reprehenſion to all who ſhall frame that conceit of
the Scriptures. Secondly theſe words cannot extend to prove
this concluſion, if they were in the Imparative Mood (which
can never be proved infallibly) becauſe they cannot be profitable
to work Faith in thoſe who cannot read, who are the far greater
part of mankind. Thirdly, this cannot be the ſence of theſe
words, becauſe they would then have excluded Chriſt Jeſus
himſelf, and after him his Apoſtles, from being the Infallible
means by which true faith was to be taught to the world, and
who were doubtleſs in their time the infallible Judges for the
deciding of all Controverſies, and the determining true Faith,
from falſe Opinions, and to whoſe judgements all upon pain of
Damnation were to ſubmit.</p>
            <p>The ſecond Reaſon urged for ſole Scripture was, 2 Tim. 3. v.
15. 16. <hi>From a child thou haſt known the Holy Scriptures, which
are able to make thee wiſe unto ſalvation through Faith which is in
Chriſt Jeſus. All Scripture is given by Inſpiration of God, and is
profitable for doctrine, for Reproof, for Correction, for Inſtruction in
Righteouſneſs, that the man of God may be perfect, thoroughly fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſhed
to all good works.</hi> But I found that neither would this Text
(ſo much and indeed ſo totally relyed upon) ſerve as a proof for
what it was pretended, namely to prove that the <hi>Scripture alone</hi>
was the way, the Rule, the Means, the governing power appoin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted
by God to judge, and to decide all doubts, and to teach us the
true Faith, and the true way to Heaven with certainty. The
Reaſons why this Text would not prove this were theſe. Firſt,
that which is ſpoken there of Scriptures is, that they were able
<hi>through</hi> or by <hi>faith in Chriſt Ieſus to make wiſe,</hi> and that they are
<hi>profitable</hi> to the ends there mentioned: But this <hi>Profitable</hi> is
<pb n="15" facs="tcp:96565:10"/>
not ſole ſufficient, and this <hi>Able</hi> through or by Faith is not ſole<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
able, but ſuppoſeth Faith already, and therefore pretends not
that they are the means preceding faith to beget faith. It was a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>greed
by all<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> that the Scriptures to one that had faith already,
and to the Man of God, who would ſubmit to ſuch Interpretati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons
of Scriptures as God ſhould teach him, and hold forth unto
him by that Authority which God had appointed to Guide,
Rule, Teach and Govern him, and to whom God had appointed
him to ſubmit, were extreamly <hi>profitable and able to make him
wiſe unto ſalvation.</hi> But to one who had not the faith, and who
did not already beleive them to be the word of God, they were
no way uſeful or profitable, <hi>for faith comes by hearing,</hi> not by
reading. Secondly, thoſe Scriptures here meant, were thoſe
which St. <hi>Timothy</hi> had <hi>known from his youth,</hi> which were the <hi>Old
Teſtament only;</hi> conſequently by this Rule they are ſolely ſuffici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ent,
conſequently the New Teſtament at the beſt <hi>not neceſſary,</hi>
nor the Preaching of Chriſt, or the Apoſtles, nor the Sacraments
of the New Teſtament, ſo that this Scripture either proves too
much, if admitted in the ſence for which it is produced, or it
proves nothing to this purpoſe. Thirdly, the word <hi>All Scripture</hi>
muſt ſignifie either <hi>every Scripture</hi> as the Original word <gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap>
ought to be rendred; or <hi>All</hi> the Scriptures that ever were, or <hi>All</hi>
the Scriptures that were when this Text was written, or <hi>All</hi> the
Scriptures that we now have. If it be <hi>every Scripture,</hi> then it
proves too much, and conſequently nothing to the preſent in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tent,
for then all the Scriptures ſave only one book are uſeleſs.
If it be <hi>All</hi> that ever were, we have them not, as I ſhall ſhew
hereafter, conſequently our rule is maymed, and God hath not
given us ſufficient means for the ends propoſed. If <hi>All</hi> the Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures
that were when this Text was written, then at leaſt all
that have been written ſince were ſuperfluous, at leaſt not neceſſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry.
If <hi>All</hi> that we now only have, and that the Apoſtle foreſaw
what would come to our hands in <hi>England,</hi> I would gladly have
ſome aſſurance why the Text muſt be thus underſtood and no
otherwiſe?</p>
            <p>In fine if from thoſe words of our deareſt Lord<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> 
               <hi>Theſe things I
ſay that ye might be ſaved,</hi> Joh. 5. 34. We are not to conclude
that thoſe very words or things then ſpoke, were ſole ſufficient
<pb n="16" facs="tcp:96565:11"/>
for Salvation, but only that they were conducing to our ſalvation;
ſo from neither of the Texts before urged, or any other that can
be urged, can we conclude, that the Scriptures are <hi>ſolely ſufficient,</hi>
but only that they are conducing to our ſalvation, and that the
directions therein included if followed truly, and according to
the intent of the Holy Goſt, are able to make him who is already
a good Chriſtian, wiſe unto ſalvation.</p>
            <p>And now that I clearly found that no Arguments which were
urged for the ſole ſufficiency of Scripture, and to prove that the
Scripture alone is this infallible judge, or rule or means, appoin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted
by God as aforeſaid, did prove the Scriptures to be ſo, or ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tisfie
the point for which they were produced. I reſolved to ſee
what could be ſaid againſt this common general Opinion of all
who oppoſe the Church of <hi>Rome,</hi> why the Scriptures could not
be this Rule and Judge.</p>
            <p>The firſt reaſon that I found was, that it did never yet appear
to anſwer this end; for thoſe who pretend the moſt to conſult the
Scriptures, do moſt of all men diſagree in matters of faith, and
in interpreting theſe Scriptures. <hi>Luther</hi> the firſt beginner of
Proteſtants, gathered a Flock of followers, which divided into
ſeveral other ſub-diviſions, contradicting each other. So <hi>Iohn
Calvin</hi> rayſed a party in <hi>Geneva</hi> of whom <hi>Luther</hi> ſaith expreſly,
Tom. 7. Fo. 380. <hi>I ſcarce ever read of a more deformed Hereſy,
which preſently in the beginning, was divided into ſo many heads,
ſuch a number of Sects, not one like another, and ſuch variety and
diſagreeing of Opinions.</hi> And have we not diviſions enough in this
poor Kingdome, and amongſt thoſe who call themſelves Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teſtants?
Are there not (beſides the Church of <hi>England</hi> which I
pretend not to treat of becauſe eſtabliſhed) Presbyterians, In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dependents,
Anabaptiſts, Fifth Monarchy men, Quakers, &amp;c.
Maintaining Doctrines contrary to each other? Do not all or
moſt of theſe pretend the Scriptures alone to be the Rule and
Judge? and doth this Rule or Judge anſwer the end for which
they pretend it was delivered to the World? I remember it is
excellently well inferred by the Learned Author of the Book In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tituled
<hi>Fiat Lux,</hi> That it is impoſſible for any one of theſe par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tyes
(which I muſt now crave leave to call Sects) with reaſon to
cenſure or condemn any of the others, although never ſo diffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rent
<pb n="17" facs="tcp:96565:11"/>
from themſelves even in points by them eſteemed funda<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mentals;
ſince each of them have their uncontroulable Plea
for themſelves, that their faith is in every reſpect conformable to
what they underſtand to be the true ſence and meaning of the
Scriptures, which they all agree to be the ſole and only Rule and
Judge. Nay which of theſe Parties can deny the others the Ti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle
of Proteſtant, or convince them of Hereſy, ſince to be a Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teſtant,
no more is required (or if it be I would gladly know what
it is) then to admit of the Scriptures interpeted according to
their beſt underſtandings and Conſciences to be the ſole and on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
rule of Faith and judge of controverſies? is not he that profeſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeth
to follow this principle, allowed by all to be a perfect good
Proteſtant though never ſo much differing in faith from others
who make the ſame profeſſion? Good God? haſt thou told us
that Hereſies muſt be, and yet left us without all poſſibility of
convincing or condemning them, or knowing who are, and who
are not Hereticks? But thoſe who pretend this Rule and Judge
to be Scripture, do in truth as little intend it as any who oppoſe
them: for if they will pleaſe but to ſpeak their conſciences
clearly, it would ſoon appear that it is not the Holy Scriptures
which byaſs them, but their own private reaſons, puting private
ſences and gloſſes upon thoſe Scriptures, which were eaſily quit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted
if they would once give themſelves the liberty to ſee how
eaſy it is for their reaſon to erre in divine things, which are as
far above the reach of reaſon as Heaven is above the Earth, as it
is for the ſame reaſon to miſtake ſo much in humane affairs as we
ſee it to do.</p>
            <p>The ſecond reaſon was that the Letter of Scriptures was to
be conſtrued and applyed by men, wherefore as mens Judge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments
and intereſts differ, ſo will their Expoſitions of written
words; from hence differing ſences will be rayſed, and from
thence different faiths. For Example, If I were to diſpute againſt
an Arrian, and to prove that God the Father, and God the Son
are of the ſame ſubſtance, I ſhould urge that Text; Joh. 10. 30.
<hi>I and my Father are one thing.</hi> And by this, according to my
judgement. I ſhould think I had proved the queſtion. But then
my <hi>Arrian</hi> comparing this with Joh: 17. 22. <hi>Where Chriſt pray<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth
to his Father, that his Diſciples might all be one thing, as thou
<pb n="18" facs="tcp:96565:12"/>
Father in me and I in thee,</hi> concludes that this <hi>One</hi> or <hi>One thing</hi>
in both theſe Texts are to be intended <hi>One</hi> in Affection, not in
ſubſtance; for, (ſaith he) it can never be underſtood that Chriſt
intended to pray that his Diſciples might be <hi>One</hi> in ſubſtance. If
I ſhould urge the <hi>Arrian</hi> farther, and ſay that the Council of
<hi>Nice</hi> gave the ſame interpretation which I do, to the Text which
I urge, he would anſwer as Proteſtants generally do, that he hath
a Worthy eſteem of Councils and Fathers, ſo far as they agree
with Scriptures, but he doth not think them infallible, he be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leives
they may miſtake and therefore where he finds them diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>agreeing
with the Word of God, he muſt contradict them all.</p>
            <p>The third Reaſon which I thought forcible, was, that thoſe
who are thus far from for the <hi>ſole Scriptures,</hi> do not ſay that <hi>One</hi>
or any perticular number of the Books of Scriptures, but <hi>All the
works of Scripture,</hi> which were written by Inſpiration of God, do,
being joyned together, make up this Rule and Judge to be a
compleat Rule and Judge. I concluded therefore, if any of theſe
Books be now loſt, this Rule is not perfect; and then Man is left
by God without means to beleive, conſequently muſt be dam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned
for that which is not his fault. Now that many of theſe
books are loſt, I found clear from thoſe which remain, there is
mentioned Num. 21. <hi>v. 14. The Book of the Warrs of the Lord.</hi>
This is loſt. It is ſaid of Solamon. 1 Kings 4. 3. 2. <hi>That he ſpoke
three thouſand Proverbs, and his Songs were a thouſand and five.</hi> I
conceive ſome of theſe upon a juſt reckoning, will be obſerved
to be wanting. We find named. 2 Chron. 9. 29. <hi>The book of Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>than
the Prophet, the Prophecy of Ahijah, and the Viſions of Iddo.</hi>
Theſe are loſt, as alſo thoſe named 1 Chro. 29. 29. <hi>The book of
Samuel, the book of Nathan, the book of God.</hi> It is clear from
<hi>Mat.</hi> 27. 9. That part of <hi>Ieremy</hi> is loſt, for that Evangeliſt cites a
Text of <hi>Ieremy</hi> not to be found in any of <hi>Ieremies</hi> books which we
have. So alſo are the Books of that Prophet mentioned Matt. 2.
23. who foretold that Chriſt ſhould be called a <hi>Nazarene.</hi> We
ſhall find by 1 Cor. 5. 9. That the Epiſtle which our Canon calls
St. <hi>Paul</hi>'s firſt Epiſtle to the Corinthians was not truly his firſt to
them, for there he ſaith, <hi>I wrote to you in an Epiſtle not to company
with Fornicators;</hi> wherefore if he hid the written an Epiſtle to
them, this was not his firſt to them. St. <hi>Paul</hi> wrote alſo an Epiſtle
<pb n="19" facs="tcp:96565:12" rendition="simple:additions"/>
from <hi>Laodicea,</hi> which he mentions thus, Col. 4. 16. <hi>Read the
Epiſtle from Laodice.</hi> It ſeems there was ſomething in it which
was material, yet we do not find that Epiſtle; the concluſion I
think falls out very naturally.</p>
            <p>The fourth Reaſon was this, nothing can be a ſole ſufficient
Rule to all, or the only way and means to convey Divine and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fallible
Faith to all, or a Judge to whoſe Sentence all are to ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mit
on pain of Damnation, which cannot be certainly and truly
underſtood by all; But the Scriptures cannot be certainly under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtood
by all. Nay they are very ſubject to be deſperately miſun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtood,
if you beleive the ſecond Epiſtle of St. <hi>Peter,</hi> (and be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leive
it we muſt for it is Gods word) 2 <hi>Pet.</hi> 3. 16. where ſpea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king
of all St. <hi>Pauls</hi> Epiſtles in general, he ſaith, <hi>In which are
ſome things hard to be underſtood, which they that are unlearned and
unſtable, wreſt as they do alſo the other Scriptures unto their own
deſtruction.</hi> It is in vain to ſay, that the Scriptures are eaſy in Fun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>damentals,
and in what concerns our ſalvation, for we have here
a teſtimony that they are hard and wreſted by the unlearned and
unſtable to their deſtruction, that is to their Damnation: Now
if they were only hard in things not appertaining to Salvation, the
wreſting of ſuch things could not bring men to Deſtruction. It
followes that they cannot be a ſafe and infallible ſecure Rule, nor
indeed any Rule at all the ignorant, who are infinitely the
greater part of thoſe for whom Chriſt dyed.</p>
            <p>The fift Reaſon is this, if the Scriptures that is the writings of
the Prophets, Evangeliſts and Apoſtles, &amp;c. be this Rule and
Judge, it can only be meant of their true, Authentical and Ori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginal
writings, not of corrupted copies: Therefore if we have
not their true Originals our Rule is imperfect; Obſerve what
the moſt learned Proteſt. Chamier ſaith in this perticular of Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture
Tranſlations, <hi>We acknowledge them to be made but by a private
Spirit, as far as every mans judgement, skilfulneſs in Languages,
dilligence and ſincerity were able to reach. Therefore there is none
either in our own tongue or in any other, unto which we think meet to
ſubiect either our ſelves or other men. As for Tranſlations the ſence
of Proteſtants is this, that all of them, of what ſtanding name, or
credit ſoever they be and with what diligence, ſincerity or Learning
ſoeuer they were made, are only ſo far certain as they agree with
<pb n="20" facs="tcp:96565:13"/>
the firſt Context, I mean as far as they expreſs that ſence which is
certainly manifeſt</hi> (and how ſhall that appear) <hi>to be the ſence of the
Hebrew and Greek words</hi> (he muſt intend here the true Origi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nals)
<hi>but if they vary and ſwerve never ſo little from hence</hi> (i. e.
from the true Originals) <hi>that ſence which they give or expreſs, we
judge neither to be Divine nor Authentick, nor Canonical, but
merely humane,</hi> Cham. Panſtr. Tom. 1. l. 1. 2. <hi>c. 2. S.</hi> 3. 5. So
then we muſt have the true Originals, or we have no perfect Rule
of the Scriptures, and therefore I would gladly ſee and ſpeak with
that man, who can aſſure me infallibly, that the Hebrew and
Greek Scriptures which we have, are theſe Originals; Nay who
will adventure to make Oath, that theſe which we have do agree
with the true Originals. And yet if we could be ſecure of this, I
doubt it will be hard to finde any perſon who doth ſo infallibly
underſtand the Originals, as to give us a true Tranſlation, on
which we may with as much infallible aſſurance rely, as upon
God interpreting: And yet if this cannot be had, we muſt con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſs
that we are not certain whether we have this Rule pure or
not. Sure I am the Apoſtles did not tranſlate theſe books into
Engliſh, we are ſo far from having St. <hi>Matthews</hi> Original, that
we know not in what Language it was written, or whether he
who tranſlated it into Greek were an honeſt man or not, we all
agree that our Engliſh Tranſlatours were fallible men, they
might be miſtaken, and have miſtaken in multitudes of places;
themſelves ſay they were careful to get the beſt Copies of the
Hebrew and Greek they could find, but were not infallibly cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain
that thoſe they had were true. Have we then in theſe a ſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficent
certainty to venture our ſoules upon, ſuppoſing God to
have appointed the Scriptures as our ſole Rule, Guide and Judge?
I think no man who hath any modeſty, or any conſideration of
his Souls good, will ſay that we have. But ſure I am, whoever
ſhall dare to ſay it, will never be able to prove it infallibly. Give
me leave to Expoſtulate thus with you, who are for ſole Scripture.
What Scriptures would ye have me to ſubmit unto, who am a
meer Engliſh man? If you ſay the Originals, neither you nor I
know where to find them: If you ſay to ſuch Copies as you have,
I ask by what Authority do you require this, ſince they are but
Copies of Copies, which you cannot certainly tell me that th<gap reason="illegible" resp="#OXF" extent="1+ letters">

Tranſlation of the Bible takes away from the Text, and adds to
the Text, to the changing and obſcuring the very ſence and mea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning
of the Holy Ghoſt. Our late great Linguiſt M. <hi>Broughton</hi>
in his Advertiſements of Corruptions, affirms to the then Bi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhops
of England, <hi>That their publick Tranſlation of Scripture into
Engliſh is ſuch, as that it perverts the Text of the Old Teſtament,
in 848 places, and that it cauſeth million of millions to reject the
New Teſtament, and to run into Eternal Flames.</hi> And Dr. <hi>Daniel
Feately</hi> in his Treatiſe Entituled <hi>The Dippers Dipped,</hi> hath theſe
words pag. 1. <hi>No Tranſlation is ſimply Authentical, or the undoub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted
word of God. In the undoubted word of God there can be no error,
but in Tranſlations there are and may be errors. The Bible Tran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſlated
therefore is not the undoubted word of God but ſo far only as it
agreeth with the Original.</hi>

when thus preſſed, and how you will be able to ſatisfie me
with certainty, that what you would have me rely upon and ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mit
unto is the undoubted word of God pure and uncorrupted.
And by what Rule ſhall I with certainty ſatisfie my ſelf what
books thoſe are which are the Word of God, for if that be not
known, I ſee not but that it is as poſſible for me to have other
books impoſed upon me, then what I have yet heard of or at
leaſt ſeen, as part of this Word of God as well as former Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtians,
ſome Ages after the Apoſtles times had the Epiſtle to the
Hebrews, thoſe of St. <hi>Iames,</hi> St. <hi>Iude,</hi> the latter of St. <hi>Peter,</hi> the
ſecond and third of St. <hi>Iohn,</hi> with the Apocalips, or Revelation
impoſed upon them by Councils, where the Pope was chief?
theſe things are fit to be clearly known, and that with certainty
<pb n="22" facs="tcp:96565:14"/>
too before a man ſubmit in ſo high a meaſure as you require.</p>
            <p>The ſixt Reaſon which I met with was; whatſoever is a ſole
ſufficient Rule muſt be plain, and clear, in all neceſſary points (at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leaſt)
which relates unto Faith, or the means by which Salvati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
is to be had which the Scripture is not; and above all things
it muſt not contradict it ſelf, which the Scriptures ſeem to do; to
prove theſe I ſhall give ſome few Inſtances, which I think can
never be infringed, that they are not plain and clear as is before<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſaid,
conſider.</p>
            <p>1. All Chriſtians generally (except ſome few) do agree that
the Sacraments of the Goſpel are neceſſary in order to ſalvation;
now as to theſe, the Scriptures are ſo far from being clean, that
they do not ſo much as determine what a Sacrament is, how ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny
Chriſt ordained, or whether there be any Sacraments or not.</p>
            <p>2. It is neceſſary to Salvation to beleive all the Books of the
Holy Scriptures to be the word of God, and to beleive nothing
written, to be the Word of God, which is Apocryphall. But by
the Scriptures it cannot be made out plainly and clearly which
Books are the Word of God, and which are Apocriphall.</p>
            <p>3. It is neceſſary to beleive the Scriptures to be the Word of
God; but there is no Text or Texts of Scripture to prove that
the Scriptures which we have, are Gods word.</p>
            <p>4. It is neceſſary to know that the Scriptures are not corrup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted,
for if they are corrupted, they ceaſe to be the word of God,
ad then they cannot be any Rule or ſure guide unto us, But of
this we can have no aſſurance in Scripture.</p>
            <p>5. It is neceſſary in order to the knowing the true mind, mea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning
and will of God, and what he intended by ſuch a Text,
that we know when a Text is to be underſtood liberally, when fi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guratively,
when miſtically; but this cannot be underſtood from
ſole Scripture, as dayly experience informs us.</p>
            <p>6. It is neceſſary to know, that the very Copies and Tranſla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions
of the Scriptures which we have, &amp; upon which we ground
our ſelves, are certainly true; for if they are not, we build upon
uncertainties; and conſequently have no ſure foundation for our
Faith; yet we cannot be aſſured, nor have ſo much as any infor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mation
as to this perticular from the Scriptures.</p>
            <p>7. It is neceſſary that the many manifeſt controverſies about the
<pb n="23" facs="tcp:96565:14"/>
true ſence of Scripture ſhould be decided, becauſe where two
contrary ſences are impoſed, or urged, and both affirmed to be
the meaning of God, and his Revelation, one only can be true,
and he who refuſeth to beleive that which is true, ſhall be dam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned;
yet theſe controverſies cannot be decyded by Scripture.</p>
            <p>8. It is neceſſary to know what is purely and abſolutely neceſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſary
to ſalvation to be beleived, and what not, that is as you ſay
what is fundamental and what not fundamental, and to be in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formed
of this plainly, leſt we err and thereby be damned, but in
this the Scripture is ſilent.</p>
            <p>9. It is neceſſary to beleive that <hi>God the Father is not begotten'
that God the Son is not made, but begotten, by his Father only; That
God the Holy Ghoſt is neither made nor begotten, but doth proceed,
and that from the Father and the Son, That Chriſt is of one ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtance
with the Father,</hi> and that theſe <hi>three</hi> are <hi>One,</hi> and that <hi>One,
Three:</hi> I refer to conſideration whether all theſe points be plain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
and clearely to be found in Scripture, if they were it had been
almoſt impoſſible, for ſo many diviſions to have hapned about
them, as have done amongſt perſons on all ſides, admitting the
Scriptures to be the word of God.</p>
            <p>10. It is neceſſary (the Church of <hi>England</hi> ſaith) that Infants
ſhould be Baptiſed, that women ſhould receive the Holy Sacra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
of the Euchariſt, that Chriſtians ſhould obſerve the Lords
day, yet none of theſe points are clearly or perticularly proved by
Scripture.</p>
            <p>11. It is a Sin, and (as the Generality of Chriſtians agree) an
Hereſy to Re-baptiſe any one who hath been Baptiſed by an He<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>retick
where doth the Scripture ſay ſo?</p>
            <p>That there are in the Scriptures ſeveral places which ſeem Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tradictions,
and conſequently ſome part of the Scriptures ſeem
untrue, is eaſily proved; and I ſhall here give you ſome few
plain Inſtances for example, to which many more might be
added.</p>
            <p>1. In the 2. <hi>Kings</hi> C. 8. <hi>v.</hi> 26. You read thus. <hi>Two and twen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty
years old was</hi> Ahazia <hi>when he began to reigne, and he reigned one
year in Ieruſalem, and his mothers name was</hi> Athaliah <hi>the daughter
<pb n="24" facs="tcp:96565:15"/>
of</hi> Omri. But in 2 Chron. c. 22. <hi>v.</hi> 2. You will read thus, <hi>Forty
and two years old was</hi> Ahazia <hi>when he began to reign, and he reigned
one year in Ieruſalem, his mothers name was</hi> Athaliah <hi>the daughter
of</hi> O<gap reason="illegible" resp="#OXF" extent="1+ letters">
                  <desc>•…</desc>
               </gap>ri. Now againſt the infallibility of Scripture, Reaſon con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vinceth
her ſelf to have this infallible demonſtration, <hi>viz.</hi> No
one who ſpeaketh two things, the one contrary to the other, can
be ſaid to be infallible in ſpeaking; but to affirm of the ſame perſon
that <hi>he began to reign when he was two and twenty years old,</hi> and
that <hi>he was two and forty years old when he began to reigne;</hi> is to
ſpeak two things the one contrary to the other, therefore ſaith
Reaſon the Scripture is not infallible in ſpeaking.</p>
            <p>2. In St. <hi>Matthews</hi> Goſpel, Chap. 1. <hi>v.</hi> 17. you read thus,
<hi>All the generations from Abraham to David are fourteen generati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons,
and from David till the carrying away into</hi> Babylon <hi>are fourteen
generations, and from the carrying away into</hi> Babylon <hi>unto Chriſt
are fourteen generations;</hi> Now if you pleaſe to conſider that three
fourteens muſt make forty and two, and then pleaſe to reckon up
all the perſons named, you ſhall find them demonſtrably to be
but one and forty and no more, which is but two fourteens and
one thirteen. Now Reaſon asketh whether this can be infallibly
true.</p>
            <p>3. In St. <hi>Lukes</hi> Goſpel Ch. 3. <hi>v.</hi> 35. 36. you ſhall read thus,
<hi>Salah, which was the ſon of Cainan which (Cainan) was the ſon of
Arphaxad,</hi> &amp; if you read <hi>Ge. c.</hi> 11. 12. you ſhall not find that <hi>Cainan</hi>
was the Son of <hi>Arphaxad</hi> as St. <hi>Luke</hi> ſaith, but that <hi>Arphaxad lived
five and thirty years &amp; begat Salah.</hi> Now according to St. <hi>Luke</hi> this
<hi>Salah</hi> was the ſon of <hi>Cainan</hi> not of <hi>Arphaxad.</hi> 'If it be anſwered
that <hi>Salah</hi> was <hi>Arphaxads</hi> ſon, becauſe <hi>Arphaxad</hi> was his
Grandfather: I pray obſerve that <hi>Arphaxad</hi> is ſaid to have <hi>begot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten</hi>
him, and that when he was <hi>five and thirty years old.</hi> And if
you remark that Chapter in <hi>Geneſis,</hi> no one is ſaid to have had a
ſon before he was thirty years old: But the greateſt difficulty will
be here, It is ſaid <hi>Arphaxad lived five and thirty years and begat
Cainan.</hi> If then <hi>Arphaxad</hi> was Granfather to <hi>Salah,</hi> becauſe he
begat <hi>Cainan,</hi> when he was five &amp; thirty years old, (in which year
of his age he begat <hi>Salah</hi> then <hi>Salah</hi> his Grandchild, and <hi>Cainan</hi>
his ſon muſt be both born in the ſame year, which ſaith Reaſon is
impoſſible. Now if Scripture can determine all controverſies, I
<pb n="25" facs="tcp:96565:15"/>
hope you will ſhew me how to ſolve theſe difficulties by the
Scripture which how to do I profeſs moſt ſeriouſly I do not un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtand.</p>
            <p>The ſeventh Reaſon which I found againſt this Opinion of
ſole Scripture was, that if the Scriptures had been appointed by
God for this end of being our ſole Rule, Guide and Judge, in all
our doubts, and the ſole means to bring faith unto our ſouls,
they would have been ſo in the Apoſtles times (at leaſt) after all
the books of the New Teſtament were written; but that they
were ſo we do not find, for then the Authority of the Apoſtles
muſt have ceaſed ſo ſoon as they had made an end of Writing,
which I beleive no one will ſay, much leſs prove: And then
even in the times of the Apoſtles, if a controverſie had ariſen
touching the true ſence of any Text, no addreſs ſhould
have been to the Apoſtles to decide the doubt, but to the book
which every one muſt have judged, though in oppoſition to the
then preſent interpretation of the Apoſtles, if they had then ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken
upon them to explain their own writings, which to ſay, I
think, will appear ſufficiently abſurd to all men. Nay if the
Scriptures had been intended for this, it muſt have followed in
all probability, that our Lord Chriſt would have left his own law
and doctrines in writing under his own hand which he hath not
done: at leaſt he would have obleiged all his Apoſtles to write,
which he did not that we know of. It ſhould alſo follow, that to
write had been the chief part of the Apoſtles Miniſtry, conſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quently
that moſt part of the Apoſtles neglected to perform the
chiefeſt part of their Miniſtry, &amp; were negligent to do that which
above all things was their duty, will any of you preſume to affirm
this? yet if you ſpeak conſequently, it will be hard to avoid it.</p>
            <p>The laſt Reaſon which I ſhall recount unto you is this, that
to make the Scripture this ſole Rule and Judge, is in effect not
to make the Scripture ſo<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> but to make every individual man and
woman, who take upon them to read and underſtand the Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures,
ſuch a Rule and Judge unto themſelves; for what diffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rence
is there between judging by my own Reaſon and judging
by a Law to be Interpreted by my own Reaſon: This is to
make the Scripture not Gods Word, but the word of every pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vate
man. Hence I concluded, that if Chriſt be God, as cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainly
<pb n="26" facs="tcp:96565:16"/>
and infallibly he is, and if he truly loved thoſe ſoules for
which he dyed, he hath certainly provided for them ſome more
aſſured means by which to know the true Faith, without which
he will not ſave them, then by leaving them to the Scriptures to
be interpreted by each one as he thinks beſt; for what Law ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ker
was there ever found ſo ridiculous, as to gather a people into
a body, and give them a Law book in writing to govern them,
and to be their only judge in all their differences, without ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pointing,
nay expreſly prohibeting, that there ſhould be any li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving
judge or Judges, or any Court to expound this Law, and to
have the Executive Authority and jurisdiction, from whence
there ſhould be no appeal?</p>
            <p>Having conſidered after this manner what could be ſaid, for
the private Spirit, Reaſon, and the ſole ſufficiency of Scripture, I
was in the laſt place to ſee what could be ſaid on the behalf of
the Catholick Church, reſolving from theſe premiſes, that if here
I could not find a ſatisfaction in point of certainty, and an infal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lible
aſſurance, I was not to expect it, (as far as I yet under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtood)
from the Principles of Chriſtianity, and conſequently
muſt conclude, that Religion, and Faith, were no more then
Fancy and Opinion.</p>
            <p>I thought it not unreaſonable, and other perſons would
doubtleſs have thought the Argument ſtrong enough, if I had
ſought no further, but concluded, the Private ſpirit is not, Rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon
is not, the Scriptures are not this Rule and Judge; therefore
the Church is. But I reſolved to examine farther, and having a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>greed
the point that ſuch a Rule and Judge there muſt alwaies
be of neceſſity, and therefore there hath alwaies been, and ever
ſhall be ſuch a One, unleſs we ſhall ſay (which I hope none will)
that God is defective in neceſſaries. I found firſt, for the firſt
2000 years, before any Scriptures were written, the Church of
God was this Rule and Judge: Was not Circumciſion and other
Rights brought in by <hi>Abraham,</hi> and practiſed by the Church
then without any Scripture to try them by? what would you
have ſaid if you had then lived? would you have diſobeyed the
then Church, and rejected thoſe Ordinances becauſe there were
then no Scriptures to warrant them?</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Secondly the Church of the Jews was ſo to the Jews after that
<pb n="27" facs="tcp:96565:16"/>
the Scripture was written; and this by the expreſs direction of
Scripture Deut.</hi> 17. 8. Thou ſhal come to the Prieſts, the Levites,
and unto the Iudge, that ſhall be in thoſe daies, and enquire, and
they ſhall ſhew thee the ſentence of Iudgement, &amp;c. And according
to the judgement which they ſhall tell thee, you ſhall do, Thou ſhalt
not decline from the ſentence which they ſhall ſhew thee, to the right
hand, nor to the left hand; And the man that will do preſumptuouſly,
and will not hearken unto the Prieſt or unto the Iudge, even that man
ſhall dye. <hi>Therfore our Bleſſed Lord, whilſt the Jewiſh Church was
yet in being, gave directions, Mat.</hi> 23. 2. 3. The Scribes and Phari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſees
ſit in <hi>Moſes</hi> Chair; all therfore whatſoever they bid you obſerve,
that obſerve and do. <hi>Would God direct them unto, &amp; puniſh with
Death for not obeying an Authority, which might deceive them,
would our Lord command the doing of whatſoever ſhould be done
by an Authority when that Authority was capable of miſtaking?</hi>
            </p>
            <p>From hence I concluded, that it was poſſible for the Church of
God to be ſuch a Rule and Judge, and to be the means appointed
by God, to give infallible inſtructions in the Truth. Now as con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerning
the Church in the new Law under Chriſt, I found.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Thirdly, that God had promiſed ſuch a Church, ſuch an Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thority
by the mouthes of his Prophets, Iſa.</hi> 2. v. 2. 3, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> It
ſhall come to paſs in the laſt dayes (<hi>ſo the Apoſtles called the time
of the New Law</hi>). That the Mountain of the Lords houſe ſhall be
Eſtabliſhed in the top of the mountains, (<hi>behold its viſibility</hi>) All
Nations ſhall ſlow unto it, (<hi>ſee its Univerſality and extent</hi>) and ſay
come ye and let us goe up to the mountain of the Lord, to the houſe of
the God of <hi>Jacob;</hi> And He (<hi>that is God</hi>) will teach us his waies, (<hi>in
this his houſe or Church</hi>) for out of Sion ſhall go forth the Law,
(<hi>as by the Apoſtles on Whitſunday</hi>) and the Word of God from
Ieruſalem (<hi>where the firſt Preaching of the Goſpel begun</hi>) And
he ſhall judge amongſt the Nations; <hi>Not perſonally for Chriſt
went not of</hi> Iewry, <hi>but) by his Churches Tribunal, erected a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mongſt
all Nations ſo conſpicuouſly, that they may all flow to it.
Will any one ſay this judgement, which is Gods judgement, can
be fallible? Or that in this Tribunal, he that teacheth can teach
us Errors? Iſa. 35. 8. where God promiſeth to eſtabliſh a way
of holineſs ſo direct unto us, that</hi> Fooles ſhould not erre therein <hi>Iſa.</hi>
54. 3. 13, 17. Thy ſeed ſhall inherit the Gentiles, thy children ſhall
be taught of the Lord, and every tongue that ſhall riſe againſt thee
<pb n="28" facs="tcp:96565:17"/>
in Iudgement, thou ſhall condemne, <hi>Iſa.</hi> 56. 21. As for me, this is
my Covenant with them ſaith the Lord my ſpirit (<hi>infallible</hi>) that is
upon thee and my words (<hi>infallible alſo</hi>) which I have put in thy
mouth (<hi>the mouth by which the Church teacheth and judgeth</hi>)
ſhall not depart out of thy mouth, nor out of the mouth of thy Seeds
ſeed, ſaith the Lord from henceforth and forever. <hi>Behold here the
ſpirit of Truth, intailed upon the Church to preſerve it from Er<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ror,
Iſa. 60. 10. 12 &amp;c.</hi> The ſons of ſtrangers ſhall build up thy
walls, their Kings ſhall miniſter unto thee, thy Gates ſhall be open
continually, they ſhall not be ſhut day nor night, that men may bring
unto thee the forces of the Gentiles, and that their Kings may be
brought, For the Nation and Kingdome which will not ſerve thee,
(<hi>by ſubmitting to thy doctrine</hi>) ſhall periſh, I will make the place
of my feet glorious, they ſhall call thee the City of the Lord, I will
make thee an eternal Excellency, thy ſun ſhall no more go down, nor
ſhall thy moon withdraw it ſelf, but the Lord ſhall be unto thee an
everlaſting Light. <hi>If thoſe ſhall periſh who refuſe to ſubmit to
this Authority, to whom God is an everlaſting Light, and whom
he makes an everlaſting Excellency, we need not fear that it can
deceive us, or that it can ever ſo be Eclipſed, as to be at any
time inviſible. Many more promiſes might be collected out of
the Old Teſtament, but I come to ſhew.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Fourthly, that Chriſt by his own mouth, and by the mouthes
of his Apoſtles hath promiſed to us likewiſe ſuch a Church, Mat.
16. 19. <hi>Upon this Rock I will build my Church,</hi> (which he had
foretold by his Prophets ſhould be of ſo vaſt extent) <hi>And the
Gates of Hell ſhall not prevail against it,</hi> Mat. 18. 17. <hi>He that
will not hear the Church, let him be unto thee as a Heathen or a
Publican,</hi> but if Chriſt by his ſpirit doth not preſerve this Church
from all poſſibility of teaching me error inſtead of a truth, I may
from this Church which Chriſt obligeth me to hear, and unto
which obligeth me to ſubmit, receive ſuch errors as may damn
me. Mat. 28. 20. <hi>And Loe I am with you alwaies even unto the
end of the World.</hi> this muſt be meant of the viſible Church which
was to be in every Age, for the Apoſtles were not to live and to
Baptiſe and teach alway unto the end of the world. And there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
if the ſame aſſiſtance and preſence of Chriſt was promiſed to
the Church after the Apoſtles, I think we ſhall not doubt but
<pb n="29" facs="tcp:96565:17"/>
that it is the <hi>ſame</hi> that is infallible. But that it may clearely ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pear
that the Aſſiſtance promiſed by Chriſt to his Church exten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded
to an infallible ſecurity from all errors, conſider <hi>Iohn</hi> 14. 16.
<hi>I will pray the Father and he ſhall give you another Comforter, that
he may abide with you for ever, even the ſpirit of Truth, whom the
world cannot receive,</hi> and v. 26. <hi>The Comforter which is the Holy
Ghoſt, whom the Father will ſend in my Name, he ſhall teach you
all things, and bring all things to your remembrance, whatſoever I
ſhall ſay unto you,</hi> and ch. 16. 12. <hi>I have many things yet to ſay unto
you, but you cannot hear them now, howbeit when the Spirit of Truth
is come, he will guide you into all truth.</hi> But <hi>all Truth</hi> excludeth <hi>all
Errors,</hi> and this for ever which was longer then the Apoſtles
were to live: If we therefore enquire, by what means this teach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
ſhall be, by whom the people ſhall be taught all Truths? and
how preſerved from all errors? St. <hi>Paul</hi> will tell us, Eph. 4. 11.
<hi>He gave ſome Apoſtles</hi> (ſucceeding in full Apoſtolical Authori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty)
<hi>ſome Prophets</hi> (expounders of the Prophets) <hi>ſome Evange<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liſts</hi>
(Preachers of the Goſpel) <hi>ſome Paſtors and Teachers,</hi> to
what end? <hi>For the perfecting of the Saints, for the work of the
Miniſtry, for the edifying of the body of Chriſt.</hi> For what time?
<hi>Till we all come in the Union of the faith.</hi> But will theſe ſecure us?
the next verſe will tell you, <hi>That we henceforth be no more children,
toſſed to and fro, and carryed about with every wind of Doctrine by
the ſleight of men, and cunning craftineſs, whereby they lye in waite
to deceive.</hi> Gods intent then was, to provide ſuch means for
mankinde, as might ſecure them in their beleif in every Age, that
they might not be deceived by the cunning craft of falſe Teachers,
ſuch as now think themſelves able by pretending inward Lights,
Private Spirits, and evidence of Scripture, by themſelves Inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preted,
to teach us a doctrine contrary to all thoſe, who for al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moſt
fifteen Ages before them have been (and none others, tea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ching
a contrary Faith can be named, who have been) the Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtles,
Prophets, Evangeliſts, Paſtours, and Teachers, in the Viſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble
Church of Chriſt. In the laſt place I ſhall urge that Text of
St. Paul to <hi>Timothy, 1. Tim. 3. 15. The Church of the Living God,
the Pillar and ground of Truth.</hi> And may we not ſecurely rely up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
that Pillar, which God hath erected for us? and found our
Faith upon that <hi>Ground of truth,</hi> which the God of all truth hath
given us for that end?</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="30" facs="tcp:96565:18"/>
To elude their plain and evident Texts, I know you are wont
to ſay, in the firſt place, that they may have other Interpretati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons,
and therefore this is not the truth. But will not the ſame
reaſon hold, the Apoſtles cited many Texts of Scriptures, and
interpreted them ſo as to prove Chriſt the Meſſias; and his Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrines
to be true, whereas thoſe Texts might have had other in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terpretations;
therefore the Interpretation put on them by the
Apoſtles were not true? Who ſees not the weakneſs of this Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gument.
Can you ſhew with any aſſurance, that theſe Texts are
not capable of theſe interpretations? If not, then according to
your own principles theſe interpretations may be true, for you
who ſay the contrary are not infallible, but may be miſtaken.</p>
            <p>Another anſwer which you uſe to give is, that you are willing
to agree, that ſo long as the Church of Chriſt teacheth confor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mable
to Scripture, ſhe is infallible, and ſo long as ſhe doth her
Duty ſhe may and ought to be beleived. But this is as weak as
the former; for who ſees not, that it gives the Church no more
priviledge, nor allowes it to have any more benefit from theſe
promiſes then the Divel hath? for ſo long as he teacheth
conformable to Scripture he may be beleived. A ſtraw may be
a Pillar until it bends, and Quick-ſands ſure ground until they
yield. What aſſurance can we have that the Holy Apoſtles did
their duty in writing what the Holy Ghoſt did dictate unto them?
For if they did not, their writings are not to be beleived; conſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quently
we are not, nor can we be infallibly ſecure; that the
Scriptures which we have were dictated by, and are by Inſpirati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
from God: If you can anſwer this, ſo as to be ſecure that the
Apoſtles did their duty, the ſame will be our anſwer, that the
preſent Viſible Catholick Church of Chriſt at all times doth her
Duty.</p>
            <p>The fift Argument is; that the Church of God was this Rule
and Judge, this only means to convey Faith, and this infallible
Guide and Authority when our Bleſſed Saviour was alive, and be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
the New Teſtament was written, and alſo in the Apoſtles
times both before and after the whole New Teſtament was
written. If not I obliege you to ſhew ſome evident Text which
proves certainly, that after the New Teſtament was written, the
Church in the Apoſtles time was deprived of this priveledge and
<pb n="31" facs="tcp:96565:18"/>
Authority, and that it had been no ſinne, then to oppoſe, or not
ſubmit to the guidance, direction, government, and authority of
the Apoſtles. But if notwithſtanding this you ſhall (without gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving
any other Reaſon) inſiſt that the Apoſtles were this infalli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble
Rule and Judge, in their times only, until the Canon of
Scriptures was finiſhed, and then loſt their Authority when they
had compleated the Canon. I pray conſider what will be the
conſequence in caſe it ſtands proved that the Canon of Scripture
which they finiſhed, is now uncompleated by the loſs of thoſe E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>piſtles
and parcels of the Apoſtles writings which I have proved
to be loſt? Will it not follow, that for the ſame Reaſon that an
infallible living rule and Judge was neceſſary before the Canon
was compleat, the ſame is now neceſſary ſome part of the Canon
being loſt? And what will the conſequence be if it ſtand proved
alſo that ſuppoſing the Canon were compleat, yet it is not ſuffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cient
to decide the controverſies now a foot amonſt Chriſtians in
matters of Faith? Will it not follow that then it is neceſſary to
have ſuch a Rule and Judge as is before mentioned? The late
Learned Dr. <hi>Ferne</hi> a great Champion for ſole Scripture, confeſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeth
Sext. 27. That <hi>Indeed ſuch a Iudge or Umpire in Chriſtendome
would (if to be had) be a ready means to compoſe all differences and
to reſtore truth and peace.</hi> But ſhall we think that our bleſſed Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deemer
when he firſt founded his Holy Church did not ſee this
as clearly as Dr. <hi>Ferne?</hi> certainly he did, and for this reaſon he
appointed the Holy Apoſtles and their Succeſſors to be this Judge
and Umpire, and if you deſire or expect to ſee an end of thoſe dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferences
wherein ye are now involved, by relying on your own
private Interpretations of the Scriptures, you muſt addreſs your
ſelves to this Judge and be content to ſtand the determination of
their Umpire which is infallible; I ſay infallible, for as the Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtles
though as men were ſubject to error in their own private af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fairs,
and actings, and as ſuch might one withſtand the other and
reprove the other, yet were they by the aſſiſtance of Gods Holy
ſpirit in defining and delivering matters of Faith; ſo the Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lates
of the Holy Catholick Church though as men they were fal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lible
in their own private actings and affairs, yet when aſſembled
in a General Council with their Supream Paſtor, they are ſtill
made infallible in defining matters of Faith by the aſſiſtance of
<pb n="32" facs="tcp:96565:19"/>
the ſame Holy Ghoſt, who was as well promyſed to them as to
the Apoſtles.</p>
            <p>The laſt reaſon is, that none of the difficulties that were pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſed
to prove the Scriptures not to be the Rule, and Judge be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
mentioned, are capable of being objected againſt the Church.
For firſt, this Judge and Rule is capable of anſwering the end for
which it is appointed and propoſed, all who ſubmit unto the
Church agreeing in matters of Faith: Secondly, it is not capa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble
of being miſunderſtood or miſinterpreted by the various Rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons
Judgements and Intereſts of men; but is alwaies in being,
and capable upon demand to explain and declare its own ſence,
and intention upon any difference ariſing. Thirdly, it is capable
of being underſtood by <hi>All.</hi> Fourthly, it is capable of being cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainly
known by all. Fifthly, it is capable of determining what
plaineſs and clearneſs in every Article of Faith, and hath alwaies
appeared to do ſo to the condemation and confuſion of all oppo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſers.
Sixthly, this was the ſaid Rule and Judge in Chriſts time,
and in the times of the Apoſtles. Laſtly, this doth not ſet up e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>very
individual man and woman to be a Judge and Rule unto
themſelves, but preſerves the unity of the ſpirit in the Bond of
Peace; by teaching all underſtandings to become Captives to this
Rule and Judge appointed by God, for their guidance and di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rection.</p>
            <p>But I know there will be yet an Objection made by you of the
ſeperation, whether theſe Texts which ſpeak ſo amply of the
Church, are to be underſtood of the Church Militant and viſible
in this World? or of the Church Triumphant? For certainly did
you apprehend that God had a Church in this world, that is, a vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſible
body politique diſtinct from that inviſible Church which is
Chriſts Miſtical body Triumphant, you would not (as I in Cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity
beleive) divide your ſelves into ſo many Congregations, in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dependent
of each other or any other body or Government
whatſoever in relation to Religion. Now to ſatisfy you in this I
ſhall deſire you to conſider, Acts the 20. 28. Where the Text
ſpeaks of a Church governed by High Paſtors which can only
be meant of the Viſible Church, and that of <hi>the whole Flock,</hi> or
Church <hi>which Chriſt redeemed with his blood,</hi> which cannot be
meant of any perticular Congregational Church 1 Cor. 10. 32.
<pb n="33" facs="tcp:96565:19"/>
               <hi>Give none offence, neither to the Iews nor to the Gentiles, nor to the
Church of God even as I pleaſe all men in all things,</hi> where he
ſpeaks clearly of the ſole and entire viſible Church, 1 Cor. 12.
28. where mention is made of the Governours and Prieſts
which are extended throughout the whole viſible Church only.
<hi>God hath ſet ſome in the Church, firſt Apoſtles, ſecondly Prophets,
&amp;c.</hi> and <hi>Epheſ.</hi> 4. 11. before cited, <hi>Col.</hi> 1. 24. 25. Where
Church is taken for the Militant only, for St. <hi>Paul</hi> was not <hi>made
a Miniſter</hi> of the Church Triumphant, 1 <hi>Tim.</hi> 2. 15. before cited,
muſt ſignifie the ſole and whole viſible Church, for no perticu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lar
Church can be ſtiled <hi>The pillar and ground of truth,</hi> ſince they
may fall, and often have fallen from truth. <hi>Iam.</hi> 5. 14. Where
he ſpeaks in general to all beleiving Chriſtians, and of a Church
uſing viſible Ceremonies, and Prieſts or Elders, which is not the
Church Triumphant, <hi>Mat.</hi> 16. 18. where the Church of Chriſt
is to be built upon <hi>Peter,</hi> and therefore muſt be meant of the
viſible Church Militant; for it is built, whilſt Militant and trans<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferred
when it is Triumphant. Nor can this be any other then a
viſible Church founded upon a viſible Rock or Foundation: for
that Rock there ſpoken of is not Chriſt, but St. <hi>Peter,</hi> as the
words clearly ſignifie, for our Saviour ſaies, upon <hi>this Rock</hi> I will
build my Church, immediatly after he had named St. <hi>Peter,</hi>
where as if he had meant himſelf, or St <hi>Peters</hi> confeſſion of his
being the Son of the ever living God, this being the remote or
mediate antecedent, he ſhould have ſaid according to Grammer
and true conſtruction <hi>and upon that Rock.</hi> Beſides he ſaies, <hi>I will
build my Church,</hi> whereas if by <hi>Rock</hi> he had intended himſelf, or
St. <hi>Peters</hi> aforeſaid confeſſion, he would have ſaid, <hi>upon this
Rock I have built</hi> or <hi>I do build my Church,</hi> not <hi>I will build:</hi> For
when our Lord ſpoke theſe words, his Church was then actu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally
built upon him, and upon his being the Son of the Living
God. He ſpoke then therefore of what he intended to do and of
what was to be after his Reſurrection and Aſcenſion into Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven,
and promiſeth here that for thoſe future times his viſible
Church ſhould be built upon St. <hi>Peter.</hi> Laſtly, that I may ſpeak
not as to the word only, but alſo as to the thing it ſelf, <hi>viz.</hi> The
Divine conſtitution of the Catholick viſible Church, by the Or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinance
of our deareſt Saviour. Conſider, 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 12. where it is
<pb n="34" facs="tcp:96565:20"/>
at large deſcribed by the Holy Apoſtle to be <hi>One body</hi> with diffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rent
parts fitly diſpoſed, ordered and connected together in one
and the ſame body. Whereof <hi>One,</hi> he ſaith is the Head, and that
muſt be as viſible as the reſt of the body, (for a viſible body
without a viſible head would be a Monſter) and ſuch a viſible
Head as ſtands in need of the foot, which Chriſt cannot do being
God, and ſo wanting nothing. And this the Apoſtle applies to
the Apoſtolical Church in his time, and the ſame is alſo deſcri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bed
again <hi>Epheſ.</hi> 4. from v. 4. to the 17. But I ſuppoſe you will
be asking? Is not then Chriſt the Head of his Church, can the
Church have another Head beſides Chriſt? I anſwer Chriſt is
the Head of his Church, and yet the Church of Chriſt by his ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pointment
may have in its external Government another Head,
that is an external Head, by the appointment of Chriſt. I ſay
Chriſt is the only abſolute independent Head, but he may ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>point
a dependent Head derived from him. Chriſt is the ſole
Head that Governs all both Paſtors and People, and the cheif
Paſtor alſo. Thus God is the King of the World; may not he
therefore have other Kings Reigning under him? Now how op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſite
and contrary your Congregational Churches, and all
Churches divided from the true Viſible Church are to this con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtitution,
is eaſy for you to ſee. What are thoſe Congregational
Churches but a confuſed Rabble of Itching Ears, heaping up
Teachers to themſelves, without any either ſingle Perſon, or
Aſſembly of them endowed with power to govern or direct all of
their Congregations diſperſed in divers Provinces and Countries,
but every one ſtands upon its own bottome, and hath no depen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dance
of the reſt, as do the Common-Wealths of <hi>Venice, Gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>va,
Holland, &amp;c.</hi> ſo that they have no viſible unity amongſt
them, either of coordination or ſubordination, but are politick
bodies, wholly ſeperate and disjoyned the one from the other.
Can you think this the conſtitution of Chriſts viſible Church on
earth? Is this One Body? Is this a compaction and conjunction
by joynts and Nerves, mentioned by the Apoſtles? The firſt and
Original Chriſtian Church in our Saviour time was ſuch an uni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted
body, as St. <hi>Paul</hi> mentions, having then our Saviour for its
viſible Head, and his Diſciples for its Members, all united toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
in one viſible Communion; and was not this Original
<pb n="35" facs="tcp:96565:20"/>
Church the Model and Platform laid by our Saviour to be imita<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted
and followed in its manner of Government by all ſucceeding
Ages? The Apoſtolical Church next to that of our Saviours time,
was like unto it, where St. <hi>Peter</hi> was the chief Paſtor, and the A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſtles
under him, over the whole Church diſperſed both amongſt
Jews and Gentiles, as appears <hi>Acts</hi> 15. and who had power to
change this Original and Apoſtolical manner of union and Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernment
in after Ages into a quite oppoſite digeſtion, and to
bring in a perfect Anarchie?</p>
            <p>I hope from the grounds here laid, it will appear as clear to
you as I profeſs it did to me, that the viſible Church of God on
Earth which in the Creed is called the Holy Catholick Church,
was and is that Rule and Judge, that means appointed by God,
for the conveying of the Chriſtian Faith to the World, and to
whom all on pain of Damnation, were and are by Gods Ordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nance
to ſubmit, as to the Authority appointed by God to teach
them what they ought to beleive in order to the attaining of Sal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vation,
and that without diſputing any more then they would
have diſputed the decrees and directions of the Holy Apoſtles,
were they now living upon Earth, conſequently that this Autho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity
was infallible.</p>
            <p>It will onely remain that we conſider which amongſt all
thoſe congregations now on Earth, which pretend themſelves to
be this Church of Chriſt is really and truly this Holy Church and
Spouſe of Chriſt. For having once found her, and knowing that
ſhe is ſo aſſiſted by the Holy Ghoſt, that ſhe cannot teach us an
Error, inſtead of a Truth, we ſhall no more diſpute the verity of
her Doctrines, then we ſhould have queſtioned the Articles of
Faith taught by the Holy Apoſtles, or the words of Chriſt him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf?
Wherefore if this Church this infallible Guide ſhall teach
us, that Infants are to be Baptiſed, that it is as lawful to deſire
the Saints departed to pray for us, as to deſire the Prayers of thoſe
who are living on our behalfs, That the body of Chriſt our Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viour
is really and truly preſent in the Sacrament of the Altar (or
the Lords Supper) or any the like Article of Faith, we ſhall no
more doubt of it then, the firſt Chriſtians did diſpute the verity
of what the Apoſtles taught them; when they informed them
<pb n="36" facs="tcp:96565:21"/>
that they were to beleive that Chriſt whom they had ſeen as
man was true and very God, that a Virgin ſtill remaining a Vir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gin,
might by the power of the Holy Ghoſt bring forth a child.
That the body of Chriſt ſpirituallized might paſs through a Dore,
the Dore being ſhut: That three could be One, and One three.
For who ſhall dare to queſtion what God ſhall tell him to be
true. And if God now ſpeaks by the mouth of his preſent Church as
he did by the mouth of his Church in the times of the Apoſtles,
who ſhall doubt the truth of thoſe words, which proceeded from
his mouth?</p>
            <p>Wherefore as to this laſt queſtion, which is now this preſent
Church of Chriſt, which is our infallible Guide and Judge ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pointed
by God for our direction, and to whom we are to ſubmit,
as aforeſaid. I ſhall in brief give you that anſwer, which I pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſs
gave me a full and clear ſatisfaction; and it is ſhortly this.
The Proteſtant Church of <hi>England</hi> and all other Churches diffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rent
from the Roman, do judge and declare and profeſs them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves
to be fallible, even according to the infallible word of
God. If then the ſaid Proteſtant Church of <hi>England</hi> or any other
Churches different from the Roman be infallible in all that they
judge, and in that they declare and profeſs to be true according
to the word of God; they doubtleſs are then infallible, and ſpeak
then the infallible truth, when they judge, declare and profeſs
that even according to the Word of God, they are fallible.
Therefore infallibly they are fallible. Hence again it being thus
proved that no Church different from that Roman is infallible:
And it being before proved that God hath appointed ſome
Church upon earth to be our infallible Judge, it demonſtratively
followeth that the Roman Church muſt needs be this infallible
Judge, becauſe no church different from it (that is none but the
Roman Church) can be this infallible Church. But I pray you
do not miſtake this Argument, as ſome have pleaſed to do, who
think the force of it to lye thus, <hi>viz.</hi> The Roman Church clai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>meth
infallibility, therefore ſhe is infallible. This is nothing like
the Argument which I put, the force of which lies thus. That
the Church truly appointed by God for this infallible Judge of
controverſies cannot poſſibly be any of thoſe Churches, which
teach themſelves not to be this infallible Judge, becauſe they
teach themſelves to be Fallible: if then they be infallible in the
<pb n="37" facs="tcp:96565:21"/>
doctrine they teach, they are infallible when they teach them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves
to be fallible. Therefore infallibly they are fallible. Now
the Church which is truly appointed by God to be this infallible
Judge, muſt needs have this condition that ſhe doth own her in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>falibility;
but this is far from ſaying that meerly her owning of in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fallibility
doth make infallibility her own. It is a very different
thing to ſay. <hi>He that muſt be a Miniſter muſt needs be a man and
not a woman,</hi> and to ſay<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> 
               <hi>That ſuch a one muſt needs be a miniſter
becauſe he is a man and not a woman.</hi> So it is one thing to ſay, the
Church which is the infallible Judge muſt be a Church judging
and holding, and profeſſing her ſelf to be infallible; and cannot
be a Church, which judgeth and profeſſeth her ſelf to be fallible.
And another quite different thing to ſay, that ſuch a Church is
the infallible Judge becauſe ſhe teacheth and profeſſeth her ſelf
to be ſo.</p>
            <p>Not be not (I pray) ſo far miſtaken, as ſome are uſually, and
wilfully, if not maliciouſly, to think that when I ſpeak of the Ro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man
Church, I intend the Church of the Dioceſs of Rome, and
ſo pretend to make a perticular Church to be an Univerſal, and
the Univerſal or Catholick Church of Chriſt. No, I entend by
the Roman Church, all that vaſtly extended community of chriſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans,
which liveth in communion with, and in ſubjection and O<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bedience
unto the Biſhop of Rome, as to their Supream Paſtour
and Governour on Eearth in things appertaining unto faith next
under Chriſt. This is the Flock of Chriſt adhering to the true
Shepheard appointed them by God.</p>
            <p>And now (deareſt Friends) I have no more to ſay, but only
entreat you in the bowels of Charity to learn by heart that moſt
pretious leſſon of our ſweet Saviour, viz. <hi>Learn of me for I am
meek and humble of heart.</hi> And that you may be in a ready way
to learn this, remember (in order to it) that Leſſon (which I
mentioned before) of his beloved Apoſtle St. John. 4. 6. <hi>We
are of God, he that knoweth God heareth us, he that is not of God
heareth us not, hereby know we the ſpirit of truth and the ſpirit of
error.</hi> There was nothing then required to diſtinguiſh theſe two
ſpirits, but to hear or to refuſe to hear the Apoſtles, and ſeeing
St. <hi>Paul</hi> ſaith, <hi>Faith comes by hearing;</hi> It will be as neceſſary
now to hear in our times, thoſe who are lawfully ſent to teach
<pb n="38" facs="tcp:96565:22"/>
it, as it was in the times of the Apoſtles. If therefore ye hear
no body, or follow thoſe who at firſt, and in their beginning heard
no body, you refuſe to hear thoſe who are ſent to teach you
And then according to St. <hi>Iohn,</hi> it is evident you are lead by the
ſpirit of error. Conſider theſe things and be happy, according to
the Prayers of,</p>

            <p>I apprehend that it is not impoſſible but that ſome of you will be at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tempting
to anſwer this Letter, and endeavouring to ſhake theſe
Principles, which have by Gods Grace proved of ſtrength to win me to
the Holy Catholick Faith. To ſuch I ſhall only give theſe cautions.
Firſt that they will be pleaſed in their Anſwer, to ſet down my own
words as they lye intirely and without maiming them: If they ſhall
pleaſe to anſwer by Paragraphs, and to ſet down each of my Para<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>graphs
wholly and ſincerely before their Anſwer to the ſame Para<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>graph,
I ſhall own their Candor and Iuſtice; But if they Anſwer by
ſetting up a Puppit of their own, pretended to be mine, they will not
make mine, but their own Arguments ridiculous; and will not de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerve
a Reply from me, or to be regarded by any one. Secondly, that
they will forbear all Reproaches and Slanders, againſt the Catholick
Church, or Catholicks in general or in perticular, this is a fault to
which Proteſtants are too much addicted in general; but moſt Perti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cularly
thoſe of the Presbiterian and Independent perſwaſions, they
have alwaies uſed to deal with Catholicks; as they did with His
late Majeſty of glorious memory, and with our moſt dread Soveraign
that now is, and their party, viz. to impute crimes to them without
end, and errors innumerable; without taking care to examine whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
what they charged them with was true or falſe: So if they can
throw Dirt enough upon the Catholicks, and impute Opinions unto
them ſufficiently monſtrous, all is well, they know the major part of
the Nation to be byaſſed with intereſt, and ready enough to beleive
what ever is ſuggeſted againſt thoſe whom they call the <hi>Common
Enemy,</hi> and that thouſands will admit a thing for truth if they find
it in Print, rather then take the pains to examine whether it be true
or not, and therefore have no difficulty to caſt forth untruths, with as
much confidence as if themſelves were ſatisfied, that all they publiſh
is dictated by the Holy Ghoſt: As for thoſe who are and ſhall be
guilty of theſe crimes, I only wiſh them the like Repentance which St.
<hi>Auguſtine</hi> had for the like errors committed by himſelf whilſt he was
a <hi>Manichaean,</hi> of which he makes this mention, St. <hi>Aug.</hi> the 6. book
of his Confeſ. c. 3. towards the end. <hi>I bluſh even full of Joy in re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gard
that I found my ſelf thereby not to have barked againſt the
<pb n="40" facs="tcp:96565:23"/>
Catholick Faith, but againſt the Fancies and Fictions of carnal
thoughts. But yet I have been raſh and impious in that I had
ſaid thoſe things accuſingly which I ought to have learnt inqui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tingly.</hi>
Nor do not (I beſeech you) take a liberty to upbraid me as
if I had ſome private ends in my preſent Change; but be pleaſed to
conſider, that I am now united to a Communion whoſe portion in this
Kingdome is to ſuffer, to be poor and ſcorned, to want preferments and
ſuffer affronts from every hand who ſhall pleaſe to give them. Whilſt
I was at the head of a Troop of Horſe in the Rebellious Army
(a ſin which I hope my deareſt Saviour hath forgiven me, I having
heartily asked pardon of my God as I here do of my Soveraign for the
ſame) I was in a condition to riſe, and thrive, and glut my ſences with
what this world called good and pleaſing; But I thank my Saviour I
am now brought home to that Church of His, which teacheth me to
ſuffer and be humble, to give Obedience to Authorities for Conſcience
ſake, to become a ſervant and a learner, not a maſter or a Teacher, to
hear thoſe that are lawfully ſent to take care of my Soul, and not to
uſurps the Office of the Prieſts, or proudly to intrude my ſelf into that
Sacred Function. I muſt for ever hereafter ceaſe to be contentious,
and let my Prince or thoſe who are in Authority under him deter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mine
what they pleaſe in relation to my body or Eſtate, I hope I ſhall
at all times hereafter follow the bleſſed Precepts of God, which I re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive
from the mouth of his Church, and from the Holy Scriptures,
namely <hi>To make Supplications, and Prayers, and Interceſſions,
and giving of thanks for all men, for Kings and all that are in Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thority,
that I may lead a quiet life in all godlineſs and honeſty,
1 Tim. 2. v. 1. 2. And to thoſe who ſhall be otherwiſe minded
I ſhall only ſay,</hi> We have no ſuch cuſtome amongſt us in the Church
of God.</p>
