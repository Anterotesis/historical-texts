         <editorialDecl>
            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            <p>
               <seg rend="decorInit">B</seg>Efore I was ſtirred up to ſet pen to pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per in this follow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing Treatiſe, I found in my ſpirit ſuch a contrariety to it, that I reſolved within my ſelf I would write no more. But within a little while after, I found the Spirit of God to have ſuch violent, ſtrong, and powerful influence upon me, that I could not withſtand it, but write. And beſides, I had
<pb facs="tcp:169869:3"/>
no peace and quietneſs in my ſpirit, till I had unloadened my ſpirit, and finiſhed this Work: for I had this daſhed into my ſpirit, <hi>Write.</hi> But no ſooner was it daſhed in, but <hi>I went and conſulted with fleſh and blood,</hi> and ſo queſtioned it, whether it was from the Lord, or no. And after ſome further clearings of it up by the Lord to my ſpirit, I was forced to lie down under the truth, power, and authority of it. Within a while after, there were divers places of Scripture given in unto me, with the minde, interpretation, and meaning thereof; which I was
<pb facs="tcp:169869:3"/>
to write, and which I have in this Diſcourſe inſerted.</p>
            <p>Two things therefore I do deſire of you in the reading of this Diſcourſe:</p>
            <p>Firſt, That you would not paſs cenſure upon it, till you have thorowly examined and tried what is written, leſt you paſs ſentence upon the Truth, and ſo be found an oppoſer of it.</p>
            <p>The ſecond is this: That you would not judge nor take that for Error, that doth not ſute with your judge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments or apprehenſions: this is the weakneſs of many Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſſors in our age; if their judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments
<pb facs="tcp:169869:4"/>
and lights cannot com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prehend a thing, they look up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on that thing to be erroneous: they meaſure Truth according to their capacity; it is not Truth no further then they can reach it: this very thing hath made many to withſtand Truth; As for example, our Prieſts and others, how often have they withſtood Truth, meerly upon this ground! Weigh what is written, pon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der it in your heart and ſpirit: if you cannot comprehend what is written, be ſilent, do not reſiſt it; it may be, you may have a diſcoverie of that you never had before; haply
<pb facs="tcp:169869:4"/>
what is written, may meet with ſome of your hearts and ſpirits<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> Here are waters to the Ancles, to the Knees, to the Loyns; a River that cannot be paſſed over, a Fountain that will never be dry; waters to wade in, to ſwim in; living waters, waters of life; healing waters, pure waters; waters to drown man in, to bury man in: do not deſpiſe theſe waters, wait on them; you know not but that an Angel from heaven may come down and put you into them, and involve you in them: there is one in this Diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>courſe, it may be, may meet with you; if he doth, he will
<pb facs="tcp:169869:5"/>
rob you of all your goods, wit, parts, gifts, underſtanding, knowledge, wiſdom, power; he will quite undo you, yea, take away your life. If you meet with one that doth this, do not forget to return praiſes to him; wait, it may be you may have that great doubt re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolved, Chriſt in you, whom you have ſo much expected from heaven &amp; from the deep: if you have, exalt the Lord, not me. It may be, you may meet with ſome diſcoveries of the Father, Word and Spirit, or Water, Blood and Holy Ghoſt, and of their ſeveral te<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtimonies; if you do, praiſe
<pb facs="tcp:169869:5"/>
him that lives for ever and e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver, not me. It may be, God may meet with you in a para<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bolical way and manner, as he did <hi>David,</hi> and make you paſs ſentence upon your ſelf, in paſſing ſentence upon another, and condemn you out of your own mouth that you have ſin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned; if he doth, magnifie the Lord, not me. It may be, Je<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſus Chriſt may ſteal like a theef into your hearts by this Diſcourſe, with greater power and glory then ever he hath done heretofore: if he doth, be ſure to return praiſes unto him, not to me. It may be, God may make mention of <hi>Rahab</hi>
               <pb facs="tcp:169869:6"/>
and <hi>Babylon</hi> to you, in this Diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>courſe; it may be he may call you to behold <hi>Philiſtia</hi> and <hi>Tyre,</hi> with <hi>Ethiopia,</hi> &amp; tell you that <hi>this man was born there:</hi> if he doth, admire the Lord, not me. It may be, you may have a diſcoverie of that glory that is to be revealed in theſe latter days, and is in this Diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>courſe ſet down: Who would reſiſt and withſtand therefore? who would not wait, ſeeing there is no ſafety in reſiſting, but in patiently waiting? Then reſiſt rather ſay, Ah Lord, there may be Truth in this Diſcourſe, though I cannot comprehend it; and it is madneſs in men, to
<pb facs="tcp:169869:6"/>
withſtand and ſpeak evil of that they know not, nor are a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble to comprehend: reveal it, diſcover it, that I may praiſe thee; then he will diſcover it to thee. Here is no need of the Sun, Moon, Stars, Candle, and Temple; for the Lord God Al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mighty, and the Lamb, are the Temple thereof, and the glory of God did lighten them, and the Lamb is the light thereof: and there ſhall be no night there, and they need no Can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dle, neither light of the Sun; for the Lord God giveth them light. I look for ſome to ſcoff, laugh, and jeer at me, and that which I have written; to ſlight
<pb facs="tcp:169869:7"/>
and ſcorn me, and what is writ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten, As I am ſure the Prieſts and others will. Do, ſlight, ſcorn, laugh and jeer at me and what I have written; ſee what you will get by it in the end; ſee what will be the iſſue of it. And I look for others to finde fault with me, and ſpeak evil and reproach me, and be an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gry with me for what I have written. Others I look ſhould ſay that I go backward and for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward in what I write, and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tradict my ſelf. I look that o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers haply ſhould ſay, that I write ſcatteringly, meanly, and not learnedly, but poorly. I care not what they ſay, I
<pb facs="tcp:169869:7"/>
weigh it not; I deſire to ſpeak not in the eloquence of mans wiſdom, but in the plainneſs of the Spirit: and as for their ſcoffs, jeers, laughters, evil ſpeakings, and reproaches, I weigh them not likewiſe; they are my portion, I rejoyce in them all, if there were as ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny more of them: I ſhall and do count them my Crown, and ſhall and do not think my ſelf worthy of them. I know whom I have believed, whoſe I am; not Mens, not Sins, not Satans, but the Lords,</p>

               <seg rend="decorInit">I</seg>N the Thirtieth and One and thirtieth Verſes of the Ninth Chapter to the <hi>Romanes,</hi> there are two Nations ſpoken of; that is to ſay, the Gentiles and the Jews. The Gentiles were thoſe which followed not after righte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ouſneſs, yet had attained to righteouſneſs, even the righteouſneſs which is of faith: and the Jews, otherwiſe <hi>Iſrael,</hi> were thoſe which fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowed after the Law of righteouſneſs, but had not attained to the Law of righteouſneſs. The firſt reaſon of it, is ſet down in verſe 32. <hi>Wherefore? becauſe they ſought it not by faith, as the Gentiles did, but as it were by the works of the Law.</hi> The ſecond reaſon of it, is, Becauſe they ſtumbled at that ſtum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bling ſtone, v. 33. <hi>As it is written, Behold, I lay in Sion a ſtumbling ſtone, and rock of offence; and whoſoever believeth on him, ſhall not be aſhamed.</hi> Jeſus Chriſt is a great ſtumbling block, and rock of offence, to thoſe profeſſors that do not openly nor profeſſedly,
<pb n="3" facs="tcp:169869:9"/>
but, as it were, ſeek righteouſneſs by the Law.</p>

            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>Anſw.</hi> It is to ſeek righteouſneſs partly by believing, and partly by doing. Thoſe that do ſo, ſtumble at Chriſt, and know not what to make of him, and are offended at him; and, in the end, they ſplit themſelves againſt him, juſt as thoſe glorious profeſſors the Scribes and Phariſees did, by reaſon of their not knowing him. Now in the firſt Verſe of the tenth Chapter to the <hi>Romanes, Paul</hi> tells his brethren the Jews what a hearty deſire he had, and how he prayed that they might be ſaved: <hi>Brethren, my hearts deſire and prayer to God for Iſrael is, that they might be ſaved.</hi> And the reaſon of this prayer, he tells them<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> verſ. 2. <hi>For I bear them record, that they have a zeal of God, but not according to know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge.</hi> They were mighty zealous for God, but it did not proceed from true knowledge: as the Scribes and Phariſees were mighty zealous and ſtrict in keeping the Sabbath, praying, giving of alms, and the like; but it proceeded not from a right knowledge, it did not proceed from a true principle. And
<pb n="4" facs="tcp:169869:10"/>
there are many Zealots in our days, Oh how full of zeal they are for God, in praying, ſpeaking, preaching, and the like! but yet not agreeable to true knowledge. And the reaſon of this is in the third verſe: <hi>For they being ignorant of Gods righteouſneſs, and going about to eſtabliſh their own righte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ouſneſs, have not ſubmitted themſelves unto the righteouſneſs of God.</hi> As the not ſeeking righteouſneſs by faith, keeps thoſe from attaining to the Law of righteouſneſs, that follow after the Law of righteouſneſs: ſo ignorance of Gods righteouſneſs makes many go about to eſtabliſh their own, and ſo by that means do not ſubject to God's righteouſneſs. In the fourth verſe, <hi>Paul</hi> ſheweth, that <hi>Chriſt is the end of the Law, for righteouſneſs, to every one that belie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veth:</hi> which the glorious Iſraelites, Scribes and Phariſees, follow after, thinking to be juſtified thereby. The righteouſneſs of which Law, <hi>Moſes</hi> deſcribes in the fifth verſe, that <hi>the man which doth thoſe things ſhall live in them.</hi> Which ſaying, Satan, many times, makes uſe of againſt poor ſouls, thereby to ſtir them up to follow after the righteouſneſs of the Law: And he makes uſe of it thus: Saith Satan, If you do the things that the
<pb n="5" facs="tcp:169869:10"/>
Law commands you, you ſhall live by them: this is Scripture ſaith the devil, If you perform the Law, you ſhall live; for there is life wrapped up, in keeping of the Law: And poor ſouls ſet upon the keeping of it, and trouble, and perplex, and wear out them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves; and the more they ſtrive to keep it, the further off are they from keeping of it; And the devils deſign in it, is, to keep poor ſouls from ſubmitting to the righteouſneſs of God; the devil knowing well, <hi>that as many as are of the works of the Law, are under the curſe; for it is written, Curſed is every one that continueth not in all things that are written in the Book of the Law, to do them,</hi> Gal. 4. 10, 11. <hi>And that no man is juſtified by the Law, in the ſight of God, is evident: for the juſt ſhall live by Faith,</hi> Now in the 6. <hi>ver.</hi> which is that I intend to ſpeak to, <hi>Paul</hi> deſcribes the righteouſneſs of Faith: <hi>But the righteouſneſs which is of Faith, ſpeaketh on this wiſe, Say not in thine heart, Who ſhall aſcend into hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven? that is, to bring Chriſt down from above,</hi> &amp;c.</p>
            <p>The words are the voice of the righteouſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs which is of Faith; they are what the righ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teouſneſs of Faith ſpeaketh: and there are
<pb n="6" facs="tcp:169869:11"/>
in the words, theſe things to be conſidered:</p>
            <p>Firſt, What Faith is.</p>
            <p>Secondly, What the voice of the righte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ouſneſs of Faith is.</p>
            <p>Thirdly, What it ſpeaks.</p>
            <p>Fourthly, To whom it ſpeaks.</p>
            <p>The firſt thing to be conſidered, is, What Faith is; that is, what the Faith of Chriſt is, as it is in the original. It is a ſuper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>natural divine work of God, upon the Spirit, which enables the ſoul to believe above all that natural Faith and Hope that is in the ſoul, and above all fear and queſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>onings, and againſt all grounds that are in the ſoul to the contrary: it is that which let<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teth us into God, into the righteoſneſs of God; it is the key that unloks the Cabinet where righteouſneſs is, and lets us in into the myſte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries of the kingdom: <hi>Gal.</hi> 3. 7, 9. <hi>Know ye therefore, that they which are of Faith, the ſame are the children of Abraham, and are bleſſed with faithful Abraham.</hi> Or, faith in this place may be taken for Chriſt; <hi>Gal.</hi> 3. 23. <hi>But before Faith came, we were kept under the Law, ſhut up unto the Faith which ſhould afterwards be revealed.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>The ſecond thing to be conſidered, is, what the righteouſneſs which is of Faith is. It is the
<pb n="7" facs="tcp:169869:11"/>
righteouſneſs which is by believing. But what is the righteouſneſs which is by believing? It is the righteouſneſs of God. But you will ask me, What is that? See in <hi>Rom.</hi> 3. 25, 26. <hi>Whom God hath ſet forth to be a propitia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, through Faith in his blood, to declare his righteouſneſs, for the remiſſion of ſins that are paſt, through the forbearance of God; to declare, I ſay, at this time his righ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teouſneſs, that he might be juſt, and the juſtifier of him which believeth in Jeſus.</hi> His righteouſneſs conſiſteth in this, in that he can remit ſin, and yet be faithful; in that he can juſtifie the ungodly, and yet be juſt: or the righteouſneſs of Faith is the righteouſneſs of Chriſt; for Faith is called Chriſt, as I ſaid before; <hi>He is made of God unto us, Wiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom, Sanctification, Juſtification, Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demption, Righteouſneſs,</hi> and the like. But what is the righteouſneſs of Chriſt? or in what doth the matter of it conſiſt?</p>
            <p>In the Active and Paſſive obedience of Chriſt; That is, in what he hath done and ſuffered for us.</p>
            <p>The third thing to be conſidered, is, What the voice of the righteouſneſs of Faith is, or what it ſpeaketh.</p>
            <p>It ſpeaketh theſe following things; that is to ſay,</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="8" facs="tcp:169869:12"/>
               <hi>Say not in thine heart.</hi> That is, Do not ſpeak ſecretly. It ſpeaks this to us, our readi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs to ſpeak that ſecretly, which haply we would not ſpeak openly, that others may take notice of what we ſay.</p>
            <p>Queſt.<hi> But what ſhould I not ſay in my heart?</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>Anſw.</hi> Theſe two things following: Firſt, <hi>Who ſhall aſcend into heaven?</hi> What is that? <hi>That is, to bring down Chriſt from above.</hi> We are ready to ſpeak it in our hearts, though not in our mouthes, Who ſhall aſcend into heaven? We want Chriſt; he is not in our hearts; ſurely he is in heaven; and our ſouls are troubled with care for one to go up into heaven, to fetch him down into our hearts: O how we have endeavoured to fetch him down, by prayer and ſtriving! As I my ſelf have done: O how I have gaped for him to come down from heaven into my mouth and heart, when I was many times praying! And when I could do no good this way, I have been much inquiſitive in my ſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit for one to fetch him down from out of the skies, and out of the deep, into my heart.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Anſw.</hi> 2. <hi>Say not in thine heart, Who ſhall deſcend into the deep?</hi> What is that?
<pb n="9" facs="tcp:169869:12"/>
               <hi>That is, to bring up Chriſt again from the dead.</hi> For want of a feeling of Chriſt within us, we are ready to ſay in our hearts, though not with our mouthes, Who ſhall deſcend into the deep? We conclude many times in our ſpirits, that either he is in the heavens, or in the deep. But firſt, we are carried out, with much care, for one to fetch him from above: And if Jeſus Chriſt come not down from thence into our hearts, then we conclude he is not there, but in the deep; and we are very inquiſitive who ſhall fetch him from the dead. We think that either he is above us, or beneath us, among the dead in the grave, in hell. Sometimes we think he is riſen, and aſcended above; and ſometimes we think that he is not.</p>
            <p>Thus much for that which the righteouſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs of faith would have us not ſay.</p>
            <p>Now we are to ſpeak of that which the righteouſneſs of faith ſaith. What is that?</p>
            <p>Firſt, <hi>The righteouſneſs of faith ſaith, The Word is nigh thee.</hi> But what word? <hi>The word of faith, which we preach<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
               </hi> What word is that? Chriſt. Why is he called the <hi>word of faith?</hi> Becauſe he it is that begets faith in ſouls. The righteouſneſs
<pb n="10" facs="tcp:169869:13"/>
of faith ſaith, That word is nigh thee. Oh that God would give us ears to hear: it is good news that the righteouſneſs of faith ſpeaks. We will hear thee what thou ſayſt, therefore ſpeak, Lord.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>The Word is nigh,</hi> Whom? Thee, us, them, him, her, all. Friends, Chriſt is nigh us; he is on our right hand, and on our left hand<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> though we ſee him not, <hi>Job</hi> 23. 9. The Word of God is nigh us. But why is Chriſt called <hi>the Word of God</hi> in Scripture? Becauſe, as the word of a man is that where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by a man expreſſeth himſelf, his minde: ſo Chriſt is called the <hi>Word</hi> of God in this re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpect; he is the minde of the Father expreſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed. That by which we know the minde of a man, is his words; that by which we know the minde of God, is by his Word. So that Chriſt is the minde of God diſco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vered; the Word is God made known, re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vealed: <hi>This Word was God, and was with God,</hi> Joh. 1. 1. Chriſt is called the Word of Truth likewiſe in Scripture: <hi>Who hath begotten us to himſelf by the Word of Truth.</hi> But why is he called <hi>the Word of Truth?</hi> Becauſe he begets Truth in the ſoul. This Word is nigh thee. How nigh me? Very nigh thee: <hi>Deut.</hi> 30. 14. <hi>For</hi>
               <pb n="11" facs="tcp:169869:13"/>
               <hi>the Word is very nigh unto thee.</hi> Where is it? In thy mouth. I do not finde him there. Though you do not, yet he is there.</p>
            <p>Secondly, He is in thine heart. I do not feel him there, and therefore he is not there. That will not follow: he is there, though you feel him not: that Jeſus which you look for from above and beneath, is exceeding nigh to thee, even in thy mouth, and in thine heart; he is as nigh as poſſible can be: he is <hi>not far from every one of us,</hi> Acts 17. 27. We many times diſquiet our ſelves for one to fetch him from above, and from the deep; whenas, poor ſouls, our Chriſt is within us. We are carried out after more Senſe then Faith; and that is the reaſon that we no longer then we feel Chriſt to be in us, do conclude him to be in our hearts.</p>
            <p>The next thing to be enquired into, is, To whom the voice of the righteouſneſs of faith ſpeaketh. That is, to thoſe, who, by rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon of the want of feeling Jeſus Chriſt within them, are carried out to enquire who ſhall aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cend into the heavens, and who ſhall deſcend into the deep, to fetch Chriſt from thence into their hearts: which were the Jews, <hi>Iſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rael,</hi> and, in them, the Saints: And the words
<pb n="12" facs="tcp:169869:14"/>
indeed are ſpoken, to prevent all Objections in them, and others, againſt this truth, Chriſt in them. And there is not an Objection that they can make, or that we and others can make, but it is there anſwered. The voice of the righteouſneſs of faith ſpeaks ſo fully to all Objections, that I cannot but ſubſcribe to the truth of what it ſaith, That Chriſt is in me: I am forced to do it, by reaſon I have nothing to ſay againſt the truth; though my baſe heart, together with the devil, is ready to queſtion every truth of God, though it be never ſo plain.</p>
            <p>The words being explicated, there will ariſe naturally this Corollary; that is to ſay,</p>
            <p>That there is an aptitude in the ſpirits of thoſe who feel not the Lord Jeſus within them, to enquire who ſhall aſcend into hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven, or who ſhall deſcend into the deep, to fetch Chriſt from thence into their ſpirits, whenas Chriſt is within them. This is clear from the words.</p>
            <p>The grounds of this Doctrine are two:
<list>
                  <item>1. Ignorance.</item>
                  <item>2. Unbelief.</item>
               </list>
            </p>
            <p>Firſt, Ignorance. We are ignorant of the Omnipreſencie of Chriſt, that he is preſent
<pb n="13" facs="tcp:169869:14"/>
in every place, and in our hearts, as in every place. I have heard many profeſſors ſubſcribe to this truth, but yet have denied it a truth in their particular ſouls.</p>
            <p>Secondly, Unbelief. We cannot believe that he is in our hearts: we will give Chriſt a being in every place, but not in our hearts. The cauſe of Unbelief, is Ignorance: we are ignorant of this truth, Chriſt in us, and therefore cannot believe it.</p>
            <p>If it be ſo, that there is a readineſs in thoſe who feel not the Lord Jeſus in them, to enquire who ſhall aſcend into heaven, and who ſhall deſcend into the deep, to fetch Chriſt from thence into their hearts; Then ſay not in your hearts, Who ſhall aſcend, and who ſhall deſcend, to fetch Chriſt from hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven and the deep, into your hearts: it is the voice of the righteouſneſs of Faith. Why do you ſay ſo? what is the reaſon of it? Becauſe, ſaith the ſoul, I do not injoy him, nor poſſeſs him within me. How do you know that you do not injoy him? Becauſe I feel him not: I ſhould feel him within me, if he were there. Poor ſoul, he may be within thee, though thou feeleſt him not; and it is thy being car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ryed out after more Feeling then Faith, that blindes thine eyes.</p>
            <p n="2">
               <pb n="14" facs="tcp:169869:15"/>
2. If it be ſo, This may ſerve to diſcover what manner of ſpirit we are of; it diſcovers the baſeneſs of our ſpirits, that though the righ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teouſneſs of faith ſaith, Say not in your hearts, Who ſhall go up into heaven, and who ſhall go down into the deep, to fetch Chriſt from thence into our hearts; yet we will ſay ſo, and do ſay ſo often in our hearts, though we have no ground to ſay ſo, ſeeing Chriſt is within us.</p>
            <p>A ſecond Corollary from the words, is this:</p>
            <p>That that Chriſt which we take care for, who ſhall aſcend into the heavens, and who ſhall deſcend into the deep, to bring him into our hearts, is within us, even in our hearts. This is cleer from the words: They enquired, who ſhall aſcend, and who ſhall deſcend, to bring Chriſt into their hearts; whenas he was within them. To prove this truth further, we ſhall bring divers places of Scripture: See that in <hi>Joh.</hi> 15. 4. <hi>Abide in me, and I in you:</hi> he ſpeaks to his Diſciples that were offended at his fleſhly de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parture from them: and that in <hi>Joh.</hi> 17. 23. <hi>I in them, and thou in me:</hi> and then that in 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 13. 5. <hi>Examine your ſelves, whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther ye be in the Faith: prove your own ſelves: know ye not your own ſelves, how that Jeſus Chriſt is in you, except ye be</hi>
               <pb n="15" facs="tcp:169869:15"/>
               <hi>reprobates?</hi> That is, unapproved, or rejected. As if the Apoſtle ſhould ſay, You are repro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bates, if Chriſt be not in you: and therefore he puts them upon trying &amp; proving whether he be in them or no. And that in <hi>Eph.</hi> 4. 6. <hi>One God and Father of all who is above all, and through all, and in you all.</hi> And that in 1 <hi>Joh.</hi> 4. <hi>Ye are of God, little children, and have overcome them; becauſe greater is he that is in you, then he that is in the world;</hi> ſpeaking of Chriſt, that he is in us, and is ſtronger then he that is in the world, which is the devil. It is very ſweet to conſider this well; and the right conſideration of it, will take away the fear that is many times in our ſpirits of the devil, and of Chriſt not being in us. And that in <hi>Gal.</hi> 2. 20. <hi>I am crucified with Chriſt, nevertheleſs I live; yet not I, but Chriſt lives in me.</hi> I am crucified, and yet I live. This is a paradox, a ſtrange thing: how can a man be crucified, and yet live? The meaning of it is, he was crucified to the world, and lived to God. And in <hi>Pſal.</hi> 46. 5. <hi>God is in the midſt of her; ſhe ſhall not be moved.</hi> Friends, God will not ſuffer us to be moved away from the hope of the Goſpel, but will help, and that early, when a temptation ſeizeth upon us, becauſe he is in the midſt of us. And
<pb n="16" facs="tcp:169869:16"/>
that in <hi>Jerem.</hi> 14. 9. <hi>Why ſhouldſt thou ſeem to be as a man amazed with us, and as a mighty man that cannot ſave us?</hi> They ask God this queſtion; Yet, that is, Though it be ſo, thou art in the midſt of us, thou art neer to us, we are called by thy Name: that is, We are thine, and therefore leave us not. Juſt ſo, poor ſouls many times ſay to God, when he ſeems to their ſouls as a man amazed, and as one that cannot ſave them; Why art thou ſo, Lord? tell us the reaſon of it: notwithſtanding this, thou art in the midſt of us; thou art ours, and we are thine; we are called by thy Name; do not forſake us. And that in <hi>Zeph.</hi> 3. 5. <hi>The juſt Lord is in the midſt thereof,</hi> (ſpeaking of his Sanctuary:) <hi>he will not do iniquity,</hi> that is, ſin. Friends, the holy Lord is within us: ſee the fifteenth verſe: <hi>The Lord is in the midſt of thee; thou ſhalt not ſee evil any more.</hi> Therefore, in the fourteenth verſe, he calls upon his people to ſing: <hi>Sing, O daughter of Zion; ſhout, O Iſrael; be glad and rejoyce with all the heart, O daughter of Jeruſalem.</hi> Is not this good news? Friends, why do ye not ſing and ſhout for joy, ſeeing the Lord is within you? And in the ſeventeenth verſe he
<pb n="17" facs="tcp:169869:16"/>
ſpeaks of the ſame thing: <hi>The Lord thy God in the midſt of thee;</hi> or, <hi>he that is thy God, is in the midſt of thee: he is mighty;</hi> that is, he is ſtrong; <hi>he will ſave thee;</hi> nothing ſhall hinder him, nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther ſin nor devils: <hi>he will rejoyce over thee with joy;</hi> that is, he will ſpend his joy upon thee; thou ſhalt have his joy; he will love thee, and <hi>he will reſt in that love;</hi> he will lie down and take his eaſe in that love wherewith he hath loved thee: <hi>He will</hi> not onely <hi>rejoyce over thee with joy,</hi> but <hi>he will joy over thee with ſinging:</hi> he will ſing and joy over thee; thou ſhalt be the ſubject of his joy and rejoycing. Now in the ſixteenth verſe it is ſaid, <hi>In that day it ſhall be ſaid to Jeruſalem, Fear thou not, I am in the midſt of thee; and to Zi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, Let not thy hands be ſlack;</hi> that is, be not unbelieving.</p>
            <p>The reaſon why I mentioned all theſe places of Scripture, was, that ſo the Obje<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctions might be fully ſatisfied concerning this truth, Chriſt in them.</p>
            <p>If it be ſo, that that Chriſt which we take care for, who ſhall aſcend into the heavens, and who ſhall deſcend into the deep, to bring him into our hearts, is within us, that is, in our hearts:</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="18" facs="tcp:169869:17"/>
Then, Friends, be peſwaded of this truth, that Chriſt is within you. But who is it that ſaith, that Chriſt is within us? The righte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ouſneſs of faith and the Scriptures ſay ſo, that he is in us, in the midſt of us, nigh to us, even in our hearts. O glorious truth! O excellent truth! This is ſweet, ſweet. But you ſeem to make no difference between Chriſt's being in all the world, and his being in the Saints. Yes but I do; there is a great deal of difference. He is in all the world more generally; he is in his Saints more par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticularly.</p>
            <p>If it be ſo, then this may ſerve to diſcover this truth to us: O how pitiful ignorant many profeſſors are of this truth, Chriſt in them! How ready are they to diſclaim it, and put it away from them, and not to own it, by teaſon of their not knowing and igno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rance of it! Friends, do ye believe it? is it a truth to your ſouls? Then why do you not rejoyce and ſing? why are ye ſad, ſee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the Lord God, in the midſt of you, is mighty.</p>
            <p>If it be ſo, wait upon God, till he reveal his Son in you. <hi>Paul</hi> did not know Chriſt to be in him, before God revealed him: <hi>When it pleaſed God to reveal his Son in</hi>
               <pb n="19" facs="tcp:169869:17"/>
               <hi>Paul, then Paul knew him to be in him. No man knows the Son, but he to whom the Father will reveal him:</hi> Therefore de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſire the Father to reveal him in you.</p>
            <p>If it be ſo, awake him not, till he pleaſe. <hi>Cant.</hi> 3. 5. <hi>I charge you, O ye daughters of Jeruſalem, by the roes and hindes of the field, that ye ſtir not up, nor awake my Love, till he pleaſe.</hi> And <hi>Cant.</hi> 2. 7. he ſpeaks of the like thing, We are ready to awake the Lord, and ſtir him up, when he doth not pleaſe: we are not contented that he ſhould awake when he pleaſeth. If he doth not awake when we would awake him, and diſcover himſelf in us and to us, then we are diſcontented and troubled at it. The Spouſe chargeth the daughters of <hi>Jeruſalem</hi> not to do it, by the roes and hindes of the field: the meaning is, The Spouſe doth call the very dumb creatures to witneſs againſt ſtirrers up of Chriſt; and we are charged alſo not to do it. And therefore, Friends, take heed, be patient; wait, wait, till he is pleaſed to make known himſelf in you.</p>
            <p>If it be ſo, then take heed of conferring with fleſh and blood, (which is men, or the fleſhly part of the ſoul) when he doth pleaſe to reveal himſelf. This we are ready to do,
<pb n="20" facs="tcp:169869:18"/>
and then immediately we queſtion whether it be true or no, that he is within us. <hi>Paul</hi> ſaith, <hi>Gal.</hi> 1. 16, that <hi>he conſulted not with fleſh and blood,</hi> when he had adiſco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>very of Chriſt in him, whether it was true or no. If ye go to ask fleſh and blood the truth of your diſcoveries, it will tell you, that all your diſcoveries of Chriſt are falſe. Have a care therefore of going to fleſh and blood: ſo ſoon as ever you have a manife<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtation of Chriſt in you, fleſh and blood will make you queſtion all your diſcoveries of Chriſt; and the reaſon is, becauſe it is an enemy to the ſoul.</p>
            <p>If it be ſo, that Chriſt is within us, Then let us confeſs him with our mouthes; this is our duty, to confeſs him: Whom? Jeſus Chriſt. How confeſs him? To be within us. Where? In our hearts. That which is required on our parts, is, I ſay, to confeſs him to be within us: <hi>That if thou ſhalt confeſs with thy mouth the Lord Jeſus,</hi> He is in us; it is ſo, it is no lye. Whether we confeſs it, or no, this is the true ſaying of the righteouſneſs of faith; and therefore let us confeſs him.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Object.</hi> But, may ſome ſay, How ſhall I confeſs him, when I do not know whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
<pb n="21" facs="tcp:169869:18"/>
or no he is in me? Whether you know, or do not know it, he is there. But I cannot acknowledge it, ſaith the ſoul. Why cannot you acknowledge it? Becauſe I do not feel him to be within me: nay, ſurely he is not within me. Why do you ſay ſo? What makes you ſay ſo? What makes you think he is not within you? I am ſuch a vile wretch, ſaith the ſoul, ſo ſinful, ſo ungodly; my heart is ſo filthy, ſo vain, and that makes me con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clude and think he is not within me: it doth not conſiſt, ſaith the ſoul, with Chriſts holi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs, to be in ſuch a vile unclean heart.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Anſw.</hi> 1. To this I anſwer: What thou ſayeſt, is a cleer Argument to me, that he is in thy heart: for elſe, if he were not there, how cameſt thou to have ſuch a diſcovery of the baſeneſs of thy heart? Who gave it thee? Where hadſt thou it? Deal ſeriouſly with me; did not Chriſt within thee, diſcover it to thee? Thou canſt not have otherwiſe a diſcovery of thy heart, but by Chriſt within thee. <hi>He that hath an ear to hear, let him hear.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>Anſw.</hi> 2. I anſwer to it thus: I can prove it to you, that he is in the worſt of ſin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ners: See in <hi>Hoſ.</hi> 11. 9. <hi>I will not execute the fierceneſs of my anger, I will not re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turn</hi>
               <pb n="22" facs="tcp:169869:19"/>
               <hi>to deſtroy Ephraim: for I am God, and not man, the holy One in the middeſt of thee. Ephraim</hi> was as vile as could be, yea, as thou canſt be: we ſhall ſee this, if we look into <hi>Hoſ.</hi> 8. 11. <hi>Becauſe Ephraim had made many Altars to ſin, Altars ſhall be unto him for ſin.</hi> Idolatry is a great ſin, in the account of God; it is worſe then Witch-craft, and yet he committed it. And then that in <hi>Hoſ.</hi> 8. 9. <hi>For they are gone up to Aſſyria, a wild aſs, alone by himſelf: Ephraim hath hired lovers.</hi> And that in <hi>Hoſ.</hi> 6. 10. <hi>I have ſeen a horrible thing in the houſe of Iſrael; there is the whore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom of Ephraim.</hi> And ſo throughout all the chapters of <hi>Hoſea,</hi> the Prophet diſcovers <hi>Ephraims</hi> wickedneſs. And he was in <hi>Paul</hi> the chiefeſt of ſinners, before God re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vealed him in him; <hi>Gal.</hi> 1. 16. So that now I think your objections are anſwered. <hi>(Selah.)</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>Anſw.</hi> 3. And by way of anſwer to that, you do not know him to be in you, I ſay thus: That though you do not know him to be in you, yet you ſhall know him to be within you. See <hi>Joh.</hi> 14. 20. <hi>At that day, you ſhall know that I am in my Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, and you in me, and I in him.</hi> That
<pb n="23" facs="tcp:169869:19"/>
day is to be underſtood when Chriſt does ſend the Comforter. And that in <hi>Joel</hi> 2. 27 <hi>And ye ſhall know that I am in the mid<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deſt of Iſrael, and that I am the Lord your God, and none elſe.</hi> The time is com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, yea, it is at hand, that you ſhall know Chriſt to be in the middeſt of you, and to be your Lord and God: you ſhall know him; nothing ſhall hinder you from know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of him, neither ſin nor devils. O it is a good word of God, (praiſed be God:) you ſhall not onely know it, but God is willing to make it known, to reveal it. See that in <hi>Col.</hi> 1. 17. <hi>To whom God is willing to make known Chriſt in you the hope of glory: and all the promiſes in Chriſt are Yea and Amen.</hi> He is very willing to do it. See that in <hi>Zach.</hi> 2. 5. <hi>For I, ſaith the Lord, will be unto her a wall of fire round about, and will be the glory in the middeſt of her:</hi> Which is ſpoken of <hi>Jeruſalem, ver.</hi> 2. See likewiſe, <hi>Gen.</hi> 45. 1, 2, 3, 4. <hi>Then Joſeph could not refrain himſelf before all them that ſtood by him, but he muſt diſcover himſelf to his brethren: for he had no power over himſelf. And he cryed, Cauſe every man to go out from me. And there ſtood no man with him, while Joſeph made</hi>
               <pb n="24" facs="tcp:169869:20"/>
               <hi>himſelf known to his brethren. And he wept aloud; and the Egyptians and houſe of Pharoah heard. And Joſeph ſaid unto his brethren, I am Joſeph: Doth my Father yet live? And his brethren could not anſwer him: for they were troubled at his preſence. And Joſeph ſaid to his bre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thren, Come neer me, I pray you. And they came neer. I am Joſeph your bro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, whom ye ſold into Egypt.</hi> This <hi>Jo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeph</hi> is a Type of Chriſt; and his diſcover<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing himſelf to his brethren, is the manner that Chriſt takes to reveal himſelf to his bre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thren. Chriſt cannot many times refrain himſelf; he cannot forbear, but diſcover and reveal himſelf to his brethren, that have ſold him into <hi>Egypt;</hi> he muſt diſcover himſelf to his brethren, as <hi>Joſeph</hi> did: as <hi>Joſeph</hi> wept to ſee his brethren, ſo doth Jeſus Chriſt to ſee his brethren; he weeps aloud to ſee us; yea, he weeps for joy to ſee his brethren, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore he diſcovers himſelf to them; and af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terwards he ſaith, I am <hi>Ioſeph,</hi> I am your <hi>Ioſeph,</hi> one of your fellow-brethren; Doth my Father yet live in you? When Chriſt ſpeaks thus to the ſoul, the Soul cannot an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwer him, becauſe it is troubled at his pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſence. And as <hi>Ioſeph</hi> ſaid to his brethren,
<pb n="25" facs="tcp:169869:20"/>
Come neer; ſo Chriſt bids us come neer. We are ready, when we have a diſcovery of Chriſt, to ſtand afar off, and to be a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fraid of him; and then Chriſt ſaith, Come neer; as if he ſhould ſay, Why ſtand you a loof off? Come neer: and to encourage them to come neer, he ſpeaks more plainly to them now, I am <hi>Joſeph</hi> your brother, whom ye ſold into <hi>Egypt;</hi> but before he ſaid, I am <hi>Joſeph,</hi> onely: and then the ſoul comes neer to Chriſt. O how ſweet this is! Chriſt ſhall not, no, will not, onely reveal himſelf; but he can do no otherwiſe; he cannot re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>frain himſelf; and therefore Chriſt ſaith un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to them, <hi>Be not grieved nor angry with your ſelves, that ye ſold me into Egypt: for God did ſend me before you, to pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerve life.</hi> See how Chriſt endeavours to take away all grief and anger from his bre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thren, by telling them that God ſent him into <hi>Egypt</hi> to preſerve life. <hi>Selah.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>So that confeſs him to be in you, though you do not feel him within you: yet if you believe he is in you, you may confeſs him: But what is it to confeſs him? To confeſs him, is to acknowledge him come in the fleſh, and come within you: 1 <hi>Joh.</hi> 4. 2. <hi>Hereby know yee the Spirit of God: eve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry</hi>
               <pb n="26" facs="tcp:169869:21"/>
               <hi>ſpirit that confeſſeth that Jeſus Chriſt is come in the fleſh, is of God.</hi> 1 Joh. 4. 15. <hi>Whoſoever ſhall confeſs that Jeſus is the Son of God, God dwels in him, and he in God.</hi> Confeſſing there, is acknowledging. <hi>Phil.</hi> 2. 11. <hi>And that every tongue ſhall confeſs, that Jeſus Chriſt is Lord, to the glory of God the Father.</hi> There is the ſame word. So that to confeſs him, is to ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>knowledge him. How? Thus: thou art within me; I do ſubſcribe to the truth of it, that it is ſo even ſo. But yet I cannot con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſs him, ſaith the ſoul. The word of faith is in thy mouth, to make thee to confeſs that Chriſt is within thee, and to ſay, It is true, Lord, as I have believed, thou art within me. There is the acknowledgement of the ſoul.</p>
            <p>There is not onely a confeſſion of the mouth required of the ſoul, but a belief of the heart likewiſe, that God raiſed Chriſt from the dead; which I do intend a little to ſpeak to. <hi>Dead</hi> here is to be underſtood grave, hell, that ſtate that Jeſus Chriſt was in, of whom it was ſaid, <hi>Thou wilt not leave my ſoul in hell, neither wilt thou ſuffer thy holy One to ſee corruption,</hi> Pſal. 16. 10. It is not enough to confeſs Chriſt
<pb n="27" facs="tcp:169869:21"/>
to be within us, but to believe in our hearts that God raiſed him from the dead: if we would be ſaved, our Faith muſt reach fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther then Chriſt in us; it muſt reach to the Father alſo. See 1 <hi>Pet.</hi> 1. 21. <hi>Who by him do believe in God, that raiſed him from the dead, and gave him glory, that our faith and hope might be in God.</hi> See fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther in <hi>Act.</hi> 13. 32, 33, 34. <hi>And we declare unto you glad tidings, how that the pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſe which was made to our Fathers, God hath fulfilled the ſame unto us their chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren, in that he hath raiſed up Ieſus again, as it is alſo written in the ſecond Pſalm, Thou art my Son, this day have I begotten thee. And as concerning that he raiſed him up from the dead, now no more to return to corruption, he ſaid, I will give him the ſure mercies of David.</hi> A faith that ſaves, that is, a faith that is ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>companyed with Salvation, is in God as one that raiſed Chriſt from the dead: for there is in Gods raiſing Chriſt Remiſſion of ſins, <hi>and juſtification from all things</hi> (as ſin, iniqui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty, and the like) <hi>from which we could not be juſtified by the Law of Moſes,</hi> Act. 13. 38, 39. And beſides, <hi>to us, there is an im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>putation of righteouſneſs,</hi> which was im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>puted
<pb n="28" facs="tcp:169869:22"/>
to <hi>Abraham, if we believe on him that raiſed up Ieſus our Lord from the dead, who</hi> for this very end <hi>was raiſed from the dead,</hi> that is to ſay, <hi>for our juſtificati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on,</hi> Rom. 4. 24, 25. God would have us be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve in him; as one that raiſed Chriſt from the dead, becauſe in Gods raiſing Chriſt, he raiſed us, <hi>through the faith of the opera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of God, who hath raiſed him from the dead, and the uncircumciſion of our fleſh hath he quickened together with him, having forgiven us all treſpaſſes; blot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting out the hand-writing of ordinances that was againſt us, which was contrary to us, and took it out of the way, nayling it to the croſs; and having ſpoyled prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cipalities and powers, he made a ſhew of them openly, triumphing over them all.</hi> A glorious ſlaughter of all our enemies is to be ſeen, in Gods raiſing Chriſt from the dead. And then that in <hi>Eph.</hi> 2. 5, 6. In Gods rai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing Chriſt, <hi>we, though we were dead in ſins, yet were quickened together with him, and were raiſed up together with him, and made to ſit together in heavenly places, in Chriſt Ieſus;</hi> which was Gods rich mercy and great love: and his end in it, was, <hi>That in the ages to come he might</hi>
               <pb n="29" facs="tcp:169869:22"/>
               <hi>ſhew the exceeding riches of his grace, in his kindneſs towards us in Chriſt Ieſus,</hi> Eph. 2. 4, 7. Now God many times ſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fers us to have the ſentence of death in our ſpirits, he ſuffers us to be preſſed out of mea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure, beyond ſtrength, inſomuch that we deſpair of life, that we ſhould not truſt in our ſelves, but in God that raiſed the dead.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Queſt.</hi> But you will ask me, Firſt, How God raiſed Chriſt from the dead.</p>
            <p>Secondly, What it is to be believe it.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Anſw.</hi> For the firſt, how God raiſed Chriſt; It was,</p>
            <p n="1">1. <hi>By the glory of the Father, </hi>Rom. 6. 4, 9</p>
            <p n="2">2. <hi>By the Spirit,</hi> Rom. 8. 11.</p>
            <p n="3">3. <hi>By his mighty power,</hi> Eph. 1. 20.</p>
            <p>The ſecond thing to be enquired into, is, What it is to believe that God raiſed his Son from the dead.</p>
            <p>There are divers ſorts of faith ſpoken of in Scripture: There is a believing from the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lation of another, <hi>Ioh.</hi> 4. 42. As the <hi>Sama<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritans</hi> did, meerly upon the report of the woman, but afterwards they believed becauſe they had ſeen Chriſt: and there is a believing, as I ſaid before, that is not accompanied with ſalvation; which <hi>Simon Magus</hi> had: and there is a believing that is accompanied
<pb n="30" facs="tcp:169869:23"/>
with ſalvation, <hi>Heb.</hi> 10. 39. <hi>But we are not of them who draw back unto perdition, but of them that believe to the ſaving of the ſoul:</hi> This is the belief that is intended here. Now that faith that ſaves<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> is the faith of Chriſt; which conſiſteth in yeelding up hear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty obedience and ſubjection to this truth, that God raiſed Chriſt from the dead: <hi>We have obeyed from the heart, that form of do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrine that hath been delivered unto us,</hi> Rom. 6. 17. This believing in God, that he raiſed Chriſt from the dead, is nothing but a ſouls lying down under the power and au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thority of it, and ſaying, It is ſo, It is ſo, Lord. Lie down therefore under the power of this truth, that God raiſed his Son; ſay it is a truth, and thou ſhalt be ſaved: it is a truth, Lord, it is even ſo; thou art ſaved.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Queſt.</hi> But you ſeem to make no difference between confeſſion of the mouth, and belief with the heart.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Anſw.</hi> Yes but I do. Faith in the heart believes this is a glorious truth, that God raiſed Jeſus Chriſt from the dead, and that Chriſt is within us; Confeſſion with the mouth declares and publiſheth nothing but what ſaith in the heart believes is truth.</p>

            <p>IN the firſt verſe of this Chapter, there is the Lord ſending <hi>Nathan</hi> unto <hi>David,</hi> with a Parable in his mouth: It was the Lord that ſent him unto <hi>David,</hi> and that put the Parable into his mouth, to declare to <hi>David.</hi> From part of the firſt verſe to the fifth verſe, <hi>Nathan</hi> makes known the Para<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble. A Parable, you know, is to be taken otherwiſe then is ſet down in the letter of it, and is much like an Allegory.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="33" facs="tcp:169869:24"/>
The firſt words of the Parable are theſe: <hi>There were two men in one city; the one rich, and the other poor.</hi> The City are the Saints: ſee <hi>Heb.</hi> 12. 22. <hi>But ye are come unto mount Sion, and unto the city of the living God, the heavenly Jeruſalem, and to an innumerable company of angels.</hi> And <hi>Eph.</hi> 2. 22. <hi>Matth.</hi> 27. 53. <hi>Rev.</hi> 21. 2, The rich man is <hi>David,</hi> who had exceeding many flocks and herds. The poor man is Chriſt: ſee <hi>Eccleſ.</hi> 9. 15. <hi>There was a little citie, and few men in it; and there came a great king againſt it, and beſieged it, and built great bulwarks againſt it. Now there was found in it a poor man, and he by his wiſdom delivered the city.</hi> See likewiſe 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 8. 9. <hi>For ye know the grace of our Lord Jeſus Chriſt, that though he was rich, yet for our ſakes he became poor, that ye through his poverty might be made rich.</hi> See <hi>Pſal.</hi> 34. 6. <hi>This poor man cried, and the Lord heard him, and ſaved him out of all his troubles.</hi> And in ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther place he is called, <hi>The man Chriſt Je<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſus.</hi> Now the rich man's and poor man's living in one city, was their enjoying each other, and having fellowſhip with each other, in the city of God. The rich man's flocks
<pb n="34" facs="tcp:169869:25"/>
and herds, are thoſe exceeding many ſpiritual bleſſings that God had bleſſed <hi>David</hi> with; which are thoſe bleſſings that God bleſſeth many of his people with: ſee <hi>Epheſ.</hi> 1. 3. <hi>Bleſſed be the God and Father of our Lord Jeſus Chriſt, who hath bleſſed us with all ſpiritual bleſſings in heavenly places in Chriſt.</hi> The poor man's ewe-lamb is the beloved diſciple of Chriſt, as <hi>John</hi> was: ſee <hi>Luke</hi> 13. 23. <hi>Now there was leaning on Jeſus boſome one of his diſciples, which Jeſus loved.</hi> This ewe-lamb the poor man bought with a price, even with that price he bought the reſt of his people with: 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 6. 12. <hi>Ye are bought with a price; there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore glorifie God in your body, and in your ſpirits, which are Gods.</hi> And then that in 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 7. 23. <hi>Ye are bought with a price: be not ye the ſervants of men.</hi> Jeſus Chriſt did not onely buy this ewe-lamb, but nouriſhed it up himſelf, with the milk of himſelf; it grew up together with him: that is, Chriſt brought it up with himſelf, as he was brought up with the Father: ſee <hi>Prov.</hi> 8. 20. And it grew up with his children; that is, with Chriſt's children: Who are thoſe? <hi>Such that are of faith,</hi> and ſo <hi>are bleſſed with faithful Abraham,</hi> and <hi>are</hi>
               <pb n="35" facs="tcp:169869:25"/>
Gal. 3: 7, 9. <hi>Thoſe which are born of the free woman,</hi> that is, <hi>born after the Spirit,</hi> or <hi>by promiſe.</hi> It did not grow up with Chriſt alone, but with the reſt of his children, who grew up with him. And it did eat of the poor man's own meat, and of the poor man's own drink; which is Chriſt himſelf. That which nou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riſhed the lamb, and which the lamb fed upon, was the meat and drink of Chriſt, which is his fleſh and blood. See in <hi>Joh.</hi> 6. 53, 54, 55, 56. <hi>Then Jeſus ſaid unto them, Verily, verily, I ſay unto you, Except ye eat the fleſh of the Son of man, and drink his blood, you have no life in you. Whoſoever eateth my fleſh, and drinketh my blood, hath eternal life. For my fleſh is meat indeed, and my blood is drink indeed. He that eateth my fleſh, and drinketh my blood, dwells in me, and I in him.</hi> That which Chriſt fed this Lamb with, was Life and Spirit, which is his fleſh and blood. O glorious food! Friends, it is the beſt food Chriſt hath, or that he can feed a ſoul with. Chriſt did not onely buy this Lamb, nouriſh it up with himſelf, and with his children, feed it with his own fleſh, and with his own blood; but it muſt lie
<pb n="36" facs="tcp:169869:26"/>
in his own boſom: his beloved diſciple is ſo dear to him, that he will not have it lie out of his own boſom: And therefore he is ſaid toca<gap reason="illegible" resp="#UOM" extent="1 letter">

               </gap>
               <g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry the lambs in his own boſom, <hi>Iſai.</hi> 40. 11. <hi>He ſhall feed his flock like a ſhepherd: he ſhall gather the lambs with his arm, and carry them in his boſom, and ſhall gently lead thoſe that are with young.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>And then he goes on with the Parable:<hi> And it was unto him as a daughter, </hi>that is, as one of the daughters of<hi> Jeruſalem: </hi>See<hi> Cant. </hi>3. 10.<hi> He made the pillars thereof of ſilver, the bottom thereof of gold, the covering of it of purple; the midſt thereof being paved with love, for the daughters of Je<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ruſalem. </hi>Speaking of<hi> Solomon, </hi>who<hi> made himſelf a chariot of the wood of Leba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>non, </hi>verſe 9. See<hi> Luke </hi>23. 28.<hi> But Jeſus turning to them, ſaid, Daughters of Hie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ruſalem, weep not for me, but weep for your ſelves, and for your children. </hi>This was ſpoken when Jeſus was a leading away to ſuffer. See that in<hi> Cant. </hi>5. 16.<hi> This is my friend, O daughters of Jeruſalem; </hi>meaning Chriſt. But what is a daughter of<hi> Hieruſalem? </hi>It is a daughter of love and glory.</p>

               <hi>And there came a traveller unto the rich man. </hi>This traveller is a wayfaring man; and a wayfaring man is one that is here, and there, and everywhere; an unſta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble and unſetled man. Wayfaring men are often ſpoken of in Scipture. See<hi> Jer. </hi>9. 2.<hi> O that I had in the wilderneſs a lodging place of wayfaring men, that I might leave my people, and go from them! for they be all adulterers, and an aſſembly of treacherous men. </hi>And that in<hi> Iſ. </hi>35. 8.<hi> And an high-way ſhall be there, and a way; and it ſhall be called the way of holineſs: the unclean ſhall not paſs over it, but it ſhall be for thoſe: the wayfaring men, though fools, ſhall not erre therein. </hi>And that in<hi> Ier. </hi>14. 8.<hi> O the hope of Iſrael, the Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viour thereof in the time of trouble, why ſhouldſt thou be as a ſtranger in the land, and as a wayfaring man, that turneth aſide to tarry for a night?</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>This rich man ſpared to take of his own flocks, and of his own herds, to dreſs </hi>or make ready<hi> for the wayfaring man that was come to him, but took the poor mans lamb, and dreſſed it for the man that was come unto him. </hi>The taking of the poor man's lamb, and dreſſing it for the wayfaring
<pb n="38" facs="tcp:169869:27"/>
man, is the doing of any thing that is ſinful before God; as<hi> David</hi>'s ſlaying<hi> 
                  <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>riah </hi>the Hittite, and taking the Hittite's wife to be his, verſ. 9. Or a man offending his weak brother: ſee 1<hi> Cor. </hi>8. 11, 12.<hi> And through thy knowledge ſhall thy weak brother periſh for whom Chriſt died? But when you ſin ſo againſt the brethren, and wound their weak conſcience, ye ſin againſt Chriſt. </hi>Therefore he ſaith, verſ. 9, 10.<hi> Take heed leſt by any means this liberty of yours be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come a ſtumbling block to them that are weak. For if any man ſee thee which haſt knowledge, ſit at meat in the idols temple, ſhall not the conſcience of him that is weak be by you emboldened to eat thoſe things which are offered to idols? </hi>The commit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting of any ſin, is the ſlaying of the poor mans lamb for the traveller.</p>
            <p>After this,<hi> David's anger was greatly kindled againſt the man: and he ſaid to Nathan, As the Lord liveth, </hi>(that is, As ſure as the Lord liveth)<hi> the man that hath done this thing ſhall ſurely die; </hi>or, is wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thy to die; or, he is a ſon of death. This kinde of ſaying of<hi> David, </hi>is ſutable to that, in a manner, in<hi> Gen. </hi>38. 24.<hi> And it came to paſs about three months after, that it
<pb n="39" facs="tcp:169869:27"/>
was told Iudah, ſaying, Tamar thy daugh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter in law hath played the harlot; and al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſo behold, ſhe is with childe by whoredom. And Iudah ſaid, Bring her forth, and let her be burnt.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>In this 2 <hi>Sam.</hi> 6. 12. <hi>David</hi> ſets forth what the rich man that had killed the poor mans lamb, ſhall reſtore: <hi>And he ſhall re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtore the Lamb fourfold,</hi> according to the Levitical Law: ſee <hi>Exod.</hi> 22. 18.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Becauſe he did this thing, and becauſe he had no pity, </hi>of the poor man's lamb. Sutable to this, is that in<hi> Pſal. </hi>109. 16.<hi> Becauſe he remembred not to ſhew mercy, but perſecuted the poor and needy man, that he might even ſlay the broken in heart.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Now in the ſeventh verſe of 2 <hi>Sam.</hi> 12. <hi>Nathan</hi> deſcribes the man that took the poor mans lamb, and ſlew it for the travel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ler: <hi>And Nathan ſaid unto David, Thou art the mau</hi> that did this thing. See how all this while <hi>David</hi> condemns himſelf out of his own mouth; and paſſeth ſentence up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on himſelf, in paſſing ſentence upon another; juſt as <hi>Iudah</hi> did: See that fore-named place of Scripture, in <hi>Gen.</hi> 38. 25, 26. <hi>When ſhe was brought forth, ſhe ſent to her father in</hi>
               <pb n="40" facs="tcp:169869:28"/>
               <hi>law, ſaying, By the man whoſe theſe are, am I with childe: and ſhe ſaid, Diſcern, I pray, whoſe theſe are, the ſignet, and bracelets, and ſtaff. And Iudah acknow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledged them, and ſaid, She hath been more righteous then I, becauſe I gave her not to Shelah my ſon. And he knew her again no more. Iudah</hi> condemned himſelf out of his own mouth, in condemning <hi>Ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mar;</hi> as well as <hi>David</hi> did, in paſſing ſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tence upon the rich man: And he knew, af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter that <hi>Tamar</hi> had ſhewed him the brace<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lets, ſignet, and ſtaff, that he was the man that judged himſelf out of his own mouth.</p>
            <p>The Parable being explicated, there will ariſe naturally theſe Points of Doctrine.</p>
            <p>The firſt is this, That <hi>Nathan</hi> the Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phet never went about any thing, but he was ſent of God to do it.</p>
            <p>The ſecond is this, That Chriſt ſuffers that diſciple whom he dearly loves, to be brought and nouriſhed up with him, and to grow up together with Chriſt, and with his children; to eat of his own meat, and drink of his own drink, and lie in his own boſom, and to be unto him as a daughter.</p>
            <p>The third is this, That committing of
<pb n="41" facs="tcp:169869:28"/>
any ſin whatſoever, is the killing of the poor man's lamb.</p>
            <p>The fourth is this, That God many times ſpeaks in a Parabolical way and manner, to awaken poor ſouls out of the deep ſleep of ſecurity and ſin, by cauſing them unknow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ingly to paſs an impartial ſentence againſt themſelves in the perſon of another; that ſo they might be brought to unfeigned repen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance.</p>
            <p>The fifth is this, That that which con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vinceth a ſoul of ſin, is God's ſaying unto him, <hi>Thou art the man.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>For the firſt, That <hi>Nathan</hi> the Prophet never went about any thing, but he was ſent of God to do it; this is clear from the words. He was ſent from God unto <hi>David,</hi> to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clare this Parable unto him: he was ſent from God to <hi>David,</hi> to tell him that the Lord had put away his iniquity: he was ſent of God to <hi>David,</hi> to ſpeak nothing but what God had put into his mouth; <hi>accord<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to all the viſion, ſo did Nathan ſpeak unto David,</hi> 1 Chron. 17. 1, 2, 3, 15.</p>
            <p>If it be ſo, Then this may ſerve to diſco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver thoſe that go before they are ſent, with this in their mouthes, The Lord hath ſent them; whereas the Lord hath not ſent them:
<pb n="42" facs="tcp:169869:29"/>
they tell the people ſo indeed, that the Lord ſent them to this place, and to that place; whenas they ſhould finde, if they would deal ſeriouſly with their own hearts, that it was their great Livings that brought them thither. There are many that take upon them the Apoſtles Commiſſion to preach, without power from above, meerly to get livings, to get a livelihood: What enquiring hath there been, and yet ſtill is, among the Prieſts, for fat Benefices! what asking<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> each other is there amongſt them, What is ſuch a Living worth, and ſuch a Living; is it worth any thing? is it a great one or not? If it be a great one, then what laying of heads together amongſt the Prieſts, is there; to get it! and if it be a ſmall Living, rather then they will have none, they will have that. They make merchandiſe of the Word. O how Chriſt ſpeaks of theſe Prieſts, in <hi>Matth.</hi> 23. 13, 14, 15, 24, 25, 27, 28. <hi>Wo unto you, hypo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crites; for ye ſhut up the kingdom of hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven againſt men: for ye neither go in your ſelves, neither ſuffer ye them that are entring to go in. Wo unto you hypo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crites, who for a pretence make long pray<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers:</hi> you uſe vain repetitions, and think to be heard for your much ſpeaking. <hi>Wo unto</hi>
               <pb n="43" facs="tcp:169869:29"/>
               <hi>you, ye hypocrites; ye compaſs ſea and land to make one proſelyte; and when he is made, you make him twofold more the childe of hell then your ſelves.</hi> When ye faſt, ye are like the hypocrites, that are of a ſad countenance: for they disfigure their faces. <hi>Wo unto you, ye blinde guides, which ſtrain at a gnat, and ſwallow a ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mel. Well did Iſaiah propheſie of you, ſaying, This people draw nigh unto me with their mouth, and honoureth me with their lips, but their heart is far from me.</hi> But <hi>in vain do ye worſhip, teaching for do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrines the commandments of men. Ye blinde leaders of the blinde; if the blinde lead the blind, both ſhall fall into the ditch. Ye can diſcern the face of the skie, but ye cannot diſcern the ſignes of the time. Ye are graves that appear not, and the men that walk over them are not aware of them. Wo unto you; for ye lade men with burdens grievous to be born, and ye your ſelves touch not the burdens with one of your fingers. Ye love the uppermoſt ſeats in the Synagogues, and greetings.</hi> Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ware therefore, Friends, of the leaven of the Phariſees. <hi>Wo unto you; for ye make clean the outſide of the cup and of the platter,</hi>
               <pb n="44" facs="tcp:169869:30"/>
               <hi>but within ye are full of extortion and exceſs. Ye are like</hi> (ſaith Chriſt) <hi>whited ſepulchres, which indeed appear beautiful outward, but are within full of dead mens bones,</hi> and of all uncleanneſs: ye outward<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly appear righteous to men, but within ye are full of hypocriſie and iniquity: ye do what ye do, to be ſeen of men, and have glory of men. <hi>Ye ſerpents, ye generation of vipers, how can ye eſcape the damnation of hell?</hi> And the old Prophets ſpeak as much, if not more, againſt them; That <hi>they propheſied in his name, whenas he ſent them not:</hi> See <hi>Jer.</hi> 14. 15. <hi>I am againſt the prophets, ſaith the Lord, that ſteal my word every one from his neighbour,</hi> Jer. 23. 30. O what picking and ſtealing by whole-ſale, is there among the Prieſts of our age, out of other mens Books and Writings, and from one another! What patching up of Sermons is there amongſt them, of other mens ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>periences, and ſo preach them! <hi>I have not ſent theſe prophets, yet they ran; I have not ſpoken to them, yet they propheſied,</hi> Jer. 23. 21. <hi>They propheſie lyes, yea, they are prophets of the deceit of their own heart.</hi> Jerem. 23. 26. <hi>The heads thereof judge for reward, and the prieſts thereof</hi>
               <pb n="45" facs="tcp:169869:30"/>
               <hi>teach for hire, and the prophets thereof di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vine for money; yet they will lean upon the Lord, and ſay, Is not the Lord among us? none evil can come upon us,</hi> Mic. 3. 11. <hi>Her prophets are light and treacherous perſons, her priests have polluted the San<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctuary,</hi> Zeph. 3. 4. <hi>And it ſhall come to paſs in that day, that the prophets ſhall be aſhamed every one of his viſion, when he hath propheſied; neither ſhall they wear a rough garment to deceive,</hi> Zech. 13. 4. You Prieſts, and Prophets, hearken to the word of the Lord in <hi>Mic.</hi> 3. 5, 6. <hi>Thus ſaith the Lord God concerning the prophets that make my people erre, that bite with their teeth, and cry Peace; and he that putteth not into their mouthes, they even prepare war againſt them. Therefore night ſhall be unto you, that ye ſhall not have a viſion; and it ſhall be dark unto you, that ye ſhall not divine: and the ſun ſhall go down over the prophets, and the day ſhall be dark over him.</hi> And then that in <hi>Jer.</hi> 24. 15. <hi>Thus ſaith the Lord concerning the pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phets, Behold, I will feed them with worm<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wood, and make them drink the water of gall: for from the prophets of Jeruſalem, is prophanes gone forth into all the land. They</hi>
               <pb n="46" facs="tcp:169869:31"/>
               <hi>commit adultery, and walk in lies; they ſtrengthen alſo the hands of evil doers, that none doth return from his wicked<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs: they are all of them unto me as So<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom, and the inhabitants thereof as Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>morrah, </hi>ver. 14. See here what God threatens and ſpeaks to you Prieſts and Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phets;<hi> your judgement doth not linger, it is at the very door; </hi>And God himſelf will exalt a poor deſpiſed people that ſhall do his work.<hi> Behold I am againſt the prophets, ſaith the Lord, that uſe their tongue, and ſay he ſaith. Behold, I am againſt them that cauſe my people to erre by their lies, and by their lightneſs, yet I ſent them not, nor commanded them: therefore they ſhall not profit this people at all, ſaith the Lord, </hi>Jer. 23. 31, 32.<hi> There is a voice of the howling of the ſhepherds; for their glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry is ſpoyled: a voice of the roaring of young lions, for the pride of Jordan is ſpoiled, </hi>Zach. 11. 3. Methinks I hear this voice, Howl, O ye Prieſts; howl, O ye ſhep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>herds; howl O ye Prophets, that ſlay the flock of the ſlaughter,<hi> and hold </hi>your ſelves<hi> not guilty: and they that ſell them ſay, Bleſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed be the Lord, for I am rich; and their own ſhepherds pitty them not. Three</hi>
               <pb n="47" facs="tcp:169869:31"/>
               <hi>ſhepherds alſo I cut off in one month, and my ſoul loathed them, and their ſoul alſo abhorred me, </hi>Zech. 11. 3<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> 5<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> 8. Gird your ſelves and lament, ye Prieſts; howl, ye Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſters of the altar: come, lie all night in ſackcloth for the ſinfulneſs of your doings, in changing your ſelves into angels of light, and miniſters of righteouſneſs.<hi> But they alſo have erred through wine, and through ſtrong drinke are out of the way, the Prieſt and the Prophet have erred through ſtrong drink, they are ſwal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowed up of wine: they are out of the way through ſtrong drink; they erre in viſion, they ſtumble in Judgement, </hi>Iſa. 28. 7.<hi> From the Prophet even unto the Prieſt, every one dealeth falſly, </hi>Jer. 6. 13.<hi> For both prophet and prieſt are prophane, yea, in my houſe have I found their wicked<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs, ſaith the Lord, </hi>Jer. 23. 11.<hi> And there ſhall be like people like prieſt: and I will puniſh them for their ways, and reward them their doings, </hi>Hoſ. 4. 9.<hi> The prieſts ſaid not, Where is the Lord? and they that handle the Law, knew me not: the pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtors alſo tranſgreſſed againſt me, and the prophets propheſied by Baal, and walked after things that do not profit. Wherefore</hi>
               <pb n="48" facs="tcp:169869:32"/>
               <hi>I will yet plead with you, </hi>Jer. 2. 8, 9.<hi> The prophets propheſie falſly, and the prieſts bear rule by their means, and my people love to have it ſo: and what will you do in the end thereof? </hi>Jer. 5. 31.<hi> Hear ye this, O prieſts, and hearken, ye houſe of Iſrael, and give you ear, O houſe of the king: for judgement is toward you, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe you have been a ſnare </hi>to the people of God, Hoſ. 5. 1.<hi> As troups of robbers wait for a man, ſo the company of prieſts murther in the way by conſent: for they commit lewdneſs, </hi>Hoſ. 6. 9. Thus ſaith the Lord,<hi> O prieſts, that deſpiſe my name; and ye ſay, Wherein have we deſpiſed thy Name? Ye offer polluted bread upon mine altar, and ye ſay, Wherein have we pollu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted thee? </hi>Mal. 1. 6, 7.<hi> And now, O yee prieſts, this commandment is for you. If ye will not hear, and if ye will not lay it to heart, to give glory to my Name, I will even ſend a curſe, upon you, ſaith the Lord, and I will curſe your bleſſings, </hi>Mal. 2. 12.<hi> The paſtors are become brutiſh, and have not ſought the Lord: therefore they ſhall not proſper, and all their flocks ſhall be ſcattered, </hi>Jer. 10, 21.<hi> Many pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtors have deſtroyed my vineyard, they</hi>
               <pb n="49" facs="tcp:169869:32"/>
               <hi>have troden my portion under foot, they have made my pleaſant portion a deſolate wilderneſs; and being deſolate, it mourn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth unto me, </hi>Jer. 12. 10, 11.<hi> We be unto the paſtors that deſtroy and ſcatter the ſheep of my paſture, ſaith the Lord. There<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore thus ſaith the Lord God of Iſrael a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt the paſtors that feed his people, Ye have ſcattered my flock, and driven them away, and have not viſited them: behold, I will viſit upon you the evil of your do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings, ſaith the Lord, </hi>Jer. 23. 1, 2. And in another place he ſaith,<hi> I will require my flocks at your hands.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>Object.</hi> But you will ſay, that you are no Prieſts, and that I have no warrant to call you ſo.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Anſw.</hi> That you are Prieſts, will appear by comparing you with the Prieſts under the Law; as,</p>
            <p>Firſt, The Prieſts under the Law did wear holy garments, <hi>Exod.</hi> 31. 10. ſo did and do you; as Copes, Surplices, and the like.</p>
            <p>Secondly, The Prieſts office under the Law, was to make atonement for ſin by of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fering ſacrifice, <hi>Levit.</hi> 4. 20. <hi>Levit.</hi> 14. 20. <hi>Numb.</hi> 15. 25, 28. This hath been and is the work of you Prieſts, to offer ſacrifice, to
<pb n="50" facs="tcp:169869:33"/>
make atonement, peace, and reconciliation for ſin. For this purpoſe you have prayed, and moved others to pray; as I have heard ſome of you ſay to your hearers, Make your atonement, peace, and reconciliation with God, by prayer, faſting, humbling your ſelves, and the like.</p>
            <p>Thirdly, The Prieſts under the Law were to offer up ſacrifice to take away ſin, <hi>Levit.</hi> 15. 30. So do you Prieſts; you pray, and faſt, and humble your ſelves, and do this and that, to take away ſin.</p>
            <p>Fourthly, None but the high-prieſts, un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der the Law, were to enter into the holy of holies, <hi>Heb.</hi> 9. 6, 7, 25. So you ſay and hold now, None but you are to enter into the holy of holies, whenas there is a free way and paſſage made by the veil of Chriſt, that is to ſay, his fleſh, for all the ſaints to enter into the holy of holies.</p>
            <p>Fifthly, The Prieſts under the Law lived by Tythes, they had no other maintenance but Tythes: So do you Prieſts live upon that which was for the maintenance of the Prieſts under the Law, that ſerved at the Altar, which was Tythes; and ſo may fitly be called Prieſts. It was a Legal adminiſtration that they were under, therefore they were to
<pb n="51" facs="tcp:169869:33"/>
live of the Law: but thoſe who are under the diſpenſation of the Goſpel, they live of the Goſpel; that is, free, and can truſt God for their maintenance.</p>
            <p>Sixthly, The Prieſts under the Law were to interpret the Law, <hi>Neh.</hi> 7. 8. This hath been and is the work of you Prieſts, to open the Law, to preſs the people upon working for life, and to threaten judgement to drive to Chriſt.</p>
            <p>

               </hi>therefore<hi> propheſie againſt the ſhepherds of Iſrael, propheſie and ſay unto them, Thus ſaith the Lord God unto the ſhepherds, Wo be to the ſhepherds of Iſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rael that feed themſelves: ſhould not the ſhepherds feed the flocks? Ye eat the fat, and ye clothe you with the wooll: ye kill them that are fed: but ye feed not the ſlock. The diſeaſed have ye not ſtrength<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ened, neither have ye healed that which was ſick, neither have ye bound up that which was broken, neither have ye brought again that which was driven a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>way, neither have ye ſought that which was loſt, but with force and with cruelty have ye ruled them, </hi>Ezek. 34. 2, 3, 4.<hi> His watchmen are blinde: they are all ignorant, they are all dumb dogs, they

And the ſhepherds ſhall have no way to flee, nor the principal of the flock to eſcape. A voice of the cry of the ſhepherds, and an howling of the principal of the flock ſhall be heard: </hi>I hear it, I hear it; and o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers ſhall hear it:<hi> for the Lord hath ſpoiled their paſture, </hi>Jer. 25. 34, 35, 36.<hi> Ye ſhepherds </hi>and prieſts,<hi> hear the word of the Lord </hi>again,<hi> Thus ſaith the Lord God, Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hold, I am againſt the ſhepherds, and I will require my flock at their hand, and cauſe them to ceaſe from feeding my flock, nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther ſhall the ſhepherds feed themſelves

any more: for I will deliver my flock from their mouth, that they may not be meat for them. </hi>And as for his people, he ſaith,<hi> I will ſeek out my ſheep, and will deliver them out of all places where they have been ſcattered in the cloudy and dark day, and will bring them to their own land, and feed them upon the mountains of Iſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rael by the rivers, and in all the inhabi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted places of the Country. I will feed them in a good paſture, and upon the high mountains of Iſrael ſhall their fold be: there ſhall they lie in a good fold, and in a fat paſture ſhall they feed; I will feed my flock, and cauſe them to lie down, ſaith the Lord. I will ſeek that which was loſt, and bring again that which was dri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven away, and will binde up that which was broken, and will ſtrengthen that which was ſick. </hi>God will feed his flock himſelf, and cure them and heal them him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf.<hi> Ezek. </hi>34. 9, 10, 11, 12, 13, 14, 15, 16.</p>
            <p>If it be ſo, that the Prophet <hi>Nathan</hi> ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver went about any thing without a Call from God; Then take heed of thoſe that venter upon any thing without a Call from God; as there are many of our Prieſts do: they preach and propheſie without a Call from

God: they have been at <hi>Cambridge,</hi> and have taken their Orders and Degrees, and have been choſen by men to the work; and they think that is a ſufficient Call from God. <hi>Paul</hi> had not his Miniſtery from man, nor by man, but as he was taught it by the revelati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of Jeſus Chriſt: and therefore theſe are falſe Prieſts and Prophets. <hi>There ſhall falſe Prophets ariſe, that ſhall deceive many; if it were poſſible, the very Elect.</hi> If the Prieſts in our age, were put to prove their Call to the Miniſtry, there would be found very few of them that could prove their Call from God. Beware therefore of theſe Wolves; take heed of the voice of ſtrangers, leſt they devour you: they will pretend that they are fearful of offending or troubling the conſciences of Gods people; but if any child of God makes a ſcruple in his conſci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence of paying Tythe, and that it is a trouble to his conſcience to pay it, and he ſhould, if he diſt pay Tythe<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> ſin againſt his conſcience; yet the Prieſts will have it. What care they for offending the Conſcience of Gods peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple? How ſhall we live<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> ſay they, elſe? It is not Conſcience, ſay they, it is rather humor; and beſides, Tythes is a Civil Right, and a ſoul need not ſcruple them, ſay they. This
<pb n="55" facs="tcp:169869:35"/>
is a diveliſh cloak to cover the Prieſts baſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs. But we hope you would have us have a livelihood? Yes, (God forbid elſe:) work with your hands as the Apoſtle ſaith, and live no more upon the ſweat of other mens brows; elſe you muſt faſt, <hi>and not eat:</hi> See 2 Theſ. 3. 10. <hi>For even when we were with you this we commanded you, that if any would not work, neither ſhould he eat. And if any man obey not our word by this Epiſtle, note that man, and have no company with him, that he may be aſha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med,</hi> ver. 14. We do work, they will ſay; we ſweat and take pains day and night for the good of peoples ſouls. But do you work with your hands, and ſet upon ſome manual calling or other? I know you take a great deal of pains for to ſtudy and get by heart this mans and that mans writings, and to preach them in publike Congregations, to get a living: but do you work as the Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtles did with their hands?</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Obj. </hi>But it is ſaid in Scripture that<hi> the Lord hath ordained that they which preach the Goſpel ſhould live on the Goſpel; </hi>and,<hi> Do ye not know that they which miniſter about ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly things, live of the things of the Temple; &amp; they which wait at the Altar, are parta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kers
<pb n="56" facs="tcp:169869:36"/>
with with the Altar? Or I onely and Barnabas, have not we power to for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bear working? Who goeth a warfare at his own charges? Who planteth a Vine<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>yard, and eateth not of the fruit thereof? Who feedeth a flock, and eateth not of the milk thereof? Say I theſe things as a man? Or ſaith not the Law the ſame alſo? For it is written in the Law of Moſes, Thou ſhalt not muzzle the mouth of the Ox that treadeth out the corn. Doth God take care for Oxen? Or ſaith he it altogether for our ſakes? For our ſakes, no doubt, this is written; that he that ploweth, ſhould plow in hope; and he that threſheth in hope, ſhould be partaker of his hope. If we have ſown unto you all ſpiritual things, is it a great thing, if we ſhall reap your carnal things? If others be partakers of this power over you, are not we rather? </hi>1 Cor. 9. 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12, 13, 14.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Anſw.</hi> I anſwer thus: It is true, that thoſe that preach the Goſpel, ſhould live by the Goſpel; but you preach other mens books and writings: You preachers of the Goſpel! What, you ambaſſadours of Chriſt, and have not matter to ſpeak from Chriſt, but ſpeak other mens experience! Neither, as
<pb n="57" facs="tcp:169869:36"/>
I ſaid before, had you your Miniſtery from Chriſt, nor by Revelation, as <hi>Paul</hi> had. If you had your Miniſtery from Chriſt, you would truſt Chriſt for a livelihood; you would not firſt ſeek a Living, and then go and preach the Goſpel. You cannot preach without other mens books, and therefore are not fit to preach the Goſpel. Can you preach, all books being taken away from you ſave the Bible, at any time when you are deſired to do it? Can you preach twice every day of the week throughout the yeer, without other mens books? If you cannot, you are not to live on the Goſpel: for ye are no true Preachers of the Goſpel.</p>
            <p>Secondly, I anſwer thus: Though thoſe that preach the Goſpel may live on the Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpel, as<hi> Paul </hi>and<hi> Barnabas </hi>might; yet, ſaith<hi> Paul, We have not uſed this power, but ſuffer all things, leſt we ſhould hinder the Goſpel of Chriſt, </hi>1 Cor. 9. 12.<hi> But I have uſed none of theſe things, neither have I written theſe things </hi>(ſaith<hi> Paul) that it ſhould be ſo done unto me: for it were better for me to die, then that any man ſhould make my glorying void, </hi>1 Cor. 9. 15.<hi> What is my reward then? Verily, that when I preach the Goſpel, I may
<pb n="58" facs="tcp:169869:37"/>
make the Goſpel of Chriſt without charge, that I abuſe not my power in the Goſpel, </hi>1 Cor. 9. 18.<hi> For your ſelves know how ye ought to follow us: for we behaved not our ſelves diſorderly among you, neither did we eat any mans bread for nought, but wrought with labour and travel night and day<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> that we might not be chargeable to any of you, </hi>2 Theſſ. 3. 7, 8. Let me ſee you Prieſts do ſo: where is there ſuch a ſpirit as<hi> Paul </hi>had, among you? O how you make the Goſpel of Chriſt chargeable! Your reward is Tythes; but this was<hi> Paul</hi>'s reward, His preaching the Goſpel for no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing: he abuſed not his power in the Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpel, as you do: he wrought with labour and travel night and day, that he might not be chargeable to any; you are idle, and mad upon taking Tythes.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Object.</hi> But you will ſay, We have done good, many of us, and converted ſouls, and are worthy of ſomewhat for our pains.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Anſw.</hi> This was <hi>Paul</hi>'s reward, his preaching the Goſpel for nothing; and it is a bigger reward then taking Tythes. O that you would conſider of it therefore!</p>
            <p>If it be ſo, let us be ſure to have a Call from God for what we do. We do many
<pb n="59" facs="tcp:169869:37"/>
things that we have no Call for from God. O how ſweet it is, when we do what we do from a Call from God! We cannot take pleaſure in any thing we do, unleſs we have a Call from God to do it. We cannot war<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rant unto our ſelves ſafety and proſperity in going unto ſuch a place, and ſuch a place, and convert ſuch a ſoul, without a Call from God. We muſt not look that God ſhould go with us, and be with us, in any enterpriſe, without a Call from God. If we have a Call for what we do, we may do what we under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>take with cheerfulneſs, and may expect God to go with us, and be with us, and in us, to help us to do what he calls us to.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Queſt.</hi> But, may ſome ſay, How ſhall we know whether we have a Call to this or to that?</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Anſw.</hi> You may know it by this, that is to ſay, by the power of God: If it be naked<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly the power of God that carries you out to do this or that, and not any by-reſpect, or ſelf-end, then you have a Call from God. Or you may know it by this: If you be cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led by God to do this or that, he enables you to do that which you are called to, ſutable and according to his will.</p>
            <p>If it be ſo, Then if God hath called any
<pb n="60" facs="tcp:169869:38"/>
of you to teach, inſtruct, pray, and the like, to go to ſuch a place, and do ſuch a thing; whatſoever he hath called you to, that do; be not diſobedient to the heavenly viſion: follow the Lamb whitherſoever he calls you; if it be to ſuffer, yet follow him<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> if he bid thee go to ſuch a one, and ſuch a one, to tell him of his ſinfulneſs, pride, baſeneſs, hypo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>criſie, to convince him of his ſin, though in a Parabolical way and manner; go, and the Lord will be with thee.</p>
            <p>The next Point of Doctrine to be<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> ſpoken to, is, That Chriſt ſuffers that diſciple whom he dearly loves, to be brought up and nou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riſhed with him, and to grow up together with him and his children; to eat of his own meat, and drink of his own cup, and lie in his own boſom, and to be unto him as a daughter. This is clear from the words.</p>
            <p>If it be ſo, Then this ſpeaks the great love that Chriſt hath to his beloved diſciple. Friends, what high love is here! What, for his beloved diſciple to be brought up and nouriſhed with Chriſt, and to grow up toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther with him; to eat of Chriſt's own meat which he eats of, and to drink of his own cup, that cup which he drinks in! and more<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>over,
<pb n="61" facs="tcp:169869:38"/>
to lie in his own boſome, and be unto him as a daughter! Greater love then this, can no man ſhew. What heart would not this love raviſh and melt! It ſpeaks the heighth, length, bredth, and depth of love. Lord, thou makeſt us amazed at it; we cannot do any thing but wonder at it: we are not able to expreſs it, and tell what it is, and how much it is: it is ſo vaſt, that when we look into it, we loſe our ſelves in the apprehenſions of it: we cannot declare it, but ſtand and admire, that he ſhould ſuffer us to lie in the boſome of himſelf, who lay in the boſom of his Father, and there drink of thoſe breſts of conſolation that are in him, and to ſit at his own table, and eat his own meat, and drink his own drink. O admirable! O ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cellent! <hi>And I appoint unto you a king<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom, as my Father hath appointed unto me, that ye may eat and drink at my table in my kingdom, and ſit on thrones, judging the twelve tribes of Iſrael,</hi> Luke 22. 29, 30.</p>
            <p>If it be ſo, Friends, then beg of Chriſt to be one of his beloved diſciples, that ſo you may be brought up and nouriſhed with him, and grow up together with him, and with his children; eat of his own meat, and drink
<pb n="62" facs="tcp:169869:39"/>
of his own cup, and lie in his own boſome, and be unto him as a <hi>daughter of Jeruſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lem.</hi> It is a high priviledge to be one of the beloved diſciples of Chriſt: for then we are intereſſed into all the glory of Chriſt; there is nothing that Chriſt hath, but we have a ſhare in: if we be his lambs, we are under his tender care and protection from the wolfs mouth.</p>
            <p>If it be ſo, then do not envie the poor lambs happineſs; that is to ſay, his being brought up and nouriſhed with Chriſt, and growing up together with him, and with his children; his eating of Chriſt's own meat, and drinking of Chriſt's own cup, and lying in his boſome, and being unto him as a daughter. We are ready to envie another's happineſs: becauſe we are not as this man, and cannot do as this man, therefore we envie him: Such a one hath notable parts, can write and preach; he hath ſweet enjoyments of God, knows much; but I am poor, and enjoy nothing, and can do nothing: and be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe the ſoul cannot do as that man doth, therefore, through the baſeneſs of the heart, and malice of the devil, it envies, ſpeaks evil of, and reproacheth that man.</p>
            <p>I beſeech you, therefore, take heed of
<pb n="63" facs="tcp:169869:39"/>
ſpeaking evil of the poor man's lamb, that is as dear to Chriſt as the apple of his eye, leſt you ſpeak evil of, envie and reproach Chriſt. That is indeed a beloved diſciple of Chriſt, which Chriſt ſuffers to lie in his bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſome, to eat of his own meat, and drink of his own drink, &amp;c. Therefore, beware, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ware, take heed what you ſpeak of a beloved diſciple of Chriſt.</p>
            <p>The next Point of Doctrine to be ſpoken to, is this, That the committing of ſin is ſlaying the poor man's lamb. This is clear from the words.</p>
            <p>If it be ſo, that the committing of ſin is the ſlaying the poor man's lamb, then, Friends, take heed of ſinning, of committing adulte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry, murder, fornication; of offending a weak brother; of being proud, high-minded, lifted up<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> leſt you kill the poor man's lamb.</p>
            <p>If it be ſo, then this may ſerve to diſcover what the killing of the poor man's lamb, or ſlaying the beloved diſciple of Chriſt<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> is: It is the doing of any thing that is ſinful before God; all your unholy walkings, all your ſelf-admirations, all your ſelf-exaltations high conceit of your ſelves, ſelf-applauſe, is the ſlaying the poor man's lamb.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="64" facs="tcp:169869:40"/>
If it be ſo, let the poor man's lamb be tender in your eyes: it is tender in Chriſt's eyes, let it be ſo alſo in yours. Do you love it as Chriſt loves it? Be you careful of offending, killing, ſlaying of it, as Chriſt is: let it be dear to you, as it is to Chriſt.</p>
            <p>The next Point of Doctrine to be ſpoken to, is this, That God many times ſpeaks in a parabolical way and manner, to awaken a poor ſoul out of the ſleep of ſecurity and ſin, by cauſing him unknowingly to paſs an im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>partial ſentence againſt himſelf, in the perſon of another, that ſo he might be brought unto unfeigned repentance. This is clear from the Parable.</p>
            <p>If it be ſo, then this may ſerve to diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cover the truth of this, How that God many times takes ſuch a myſtical way of ſpeaking, that he makes the poor creature condemn himſelf, paſs ſentence upon him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf in the perſon of another, as he made <hi>David.</hi> It makes me wonder at <hi>David</hi>'s being caught by God, and what he ſaid, when the Prophet ſaid unto him, <hi>Thou art the man.</hi> Friends, if you have committed adul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tery, murder, fornication, or ſome ſecret ſin, or the like; God hath a Parabolical way
<pb n="65" facs="tcp:169869:40"/>
and manner, to make you paſs ſentence upon your ſelves, in paſſing ſentence upon others, if he intend good to you. There is no hiding of your ſins; God will finde them out. <hi>David</hi> little thought that he was the man the Prophet ſpoke to, and that he paſſed ſentence upon himſelf in the perſon of ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther. God can catch us, ſome way or other: if he intend good to our ſouls, he will ſhew us that we have ſinned, as he did <hi>David,</hi> ſome way or other.</p>
            <p>If it be ſo, it ſpeaks the wiſdom of God. O how wiſe is our God, for our good! Though haply, we think him not to be ſo. O the depth of the wiſdom of God! his ways are paſt finding out, in this thing, in convincing of ſin in ſuch a parabolical way. We ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny times ſpeak againſt his wiſdom and ways, becauſe we do not comprehend them: there is no ſearching of his ways, they are paſt finding out; the more we ſearch into them, the more we loſe our ſelves in them.</p>
            <p>The fifth doctrine is this: That that which convinceth a man of ſin, is, Gods ſaying unto him, Thou art the man: This is cleer from the words.</p>
            <p>If it be ſo, Then you that take your fill
<pb n="66" facs="tcp:169869:41"/>
of ſin, that commit ſin with greedineſs; when God comes to ſay to you ſouls, You are the men and the women that have ſinned againſt him, what will you do then? And you that are proud, ſelf-conceited, high-minded, and the like; God will finde you out, and diſcover to you, that you are the men and women that have ſinned againſt him, and wronged your own ſouls. To confirm this Doctrine, conſider that in <hi>Act.</hi> 2. 3, 6. <hi>Therefore, let all the houſe of Iſrael know aſſuredly, that God hath made that ſame Jeſus, whom ye have crucified, both Lord and Chriſt;</hi> Whom they had crucified. When God had ſaid unto them, that they were thoſe which crucified Chriſt, that they were the men which did it; when they heard this, they were pricked in their hearts, and cryed out, What ſhall we do to be ſaved? And in another place, <hi>It was ye that denyed Chriſt in the preſence of Pilate, that de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nyed the holy One and juſt, and deſired a murderer to be granted unto you: it was ye that killed the prince of life, whom God, raiſed from the dead,</hi> Act. 3. 13, 14, 15. <hi>The God of our Fathers raiſed up Jeſus, whom ye ſlew and hanged on a tree, him hath God exalted with his right</hi>
               <pb n="67" facs="tcp:169869:41"/>
               <hi>hand, to be a Prince and a Saviour, to give repentance unto Iſrael, and forgiveneſs of ſins. When they heard that, they were cut to the heart, and took counſel to ſlay them,</hi> Act. 5. 30, 31, 33. The Apoſtles ſaying unto them in the Spirit of Chriſt, that they were thoſe that ſlew Chriſt, they were the men that did it; that cuts them to the heart, and makes them take counſel to ſlay them. VVhen God ſpeaks to a ſoul, Thou art the man that haſt ſinned, that haſt ſlain Chriſt; either he will cry out, VVhat ſhall I do to be ſaved? or elſe he will inrage and take counſel againſt the people of God. The VVord of God is like a two edged ſword, and will cut one way or other.</p>
            <p>If it be ſo, Then O that God would ſay to you, as he did to <hi>David,</hi> you are the men and women, that have killed the poor mans Lamb! VVe are ready, with the whoriſh wo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man, to wipe our mouthes, and ſay, VVe have not ſinned: but when God comes to diſco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver ſin, we ſhall ſee we have ſinned, been proud, vaunted, and gloried in our ſelves what we have been, done, or can do; that we have ſpoken honourable of thoſe that ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mired us, and poor, and baſe, and contempti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble, of thoſe that did not admire us, and cry us up.</p>

            <p>IN the fifth verſe of this chapter, there is a Queſtion propounded with an Anſwer anne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>xed to it. The Queſtion is this: <hi>Who is he that overcometh the world?</hi> The anſwer is this: <hi>But he that believeth that Jeſus is the Son of God, this is he that came by water and</hi>
               <pb n="6" facs="tcp:169869:42"/>
               <hi>bloud, even Jeſus Chriſt; not by water onely, but by water and blood. And it is the Spirit that beareth witneſs of this.</hi> The reaſon is, <hi>becauſe the Spirit is truth.</hi> Now theſe two verſes which we are to ſpeak to, are a reaſon of part of the ſixth verſe. There are in the firſt verſe of the words, theſe things to be conſidered,</p>
            <p>Firſt, Who the Witneſſes are that bear re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cord in Heaven.</p>
            <p>Secondly, What Heaven is, in which they bear teſtimony.</p>

            <p>Thirdly, What their teſtimonies are.</p>
            <p>Fourthly, How the Witneſſes agree in one.</p>
            <p>The firſt thing to be conſidered in the firſt verſe of the words, is this: Who the Wit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſes are, that bear record in Heaven. They are three great myſteries, the Father, the
<pb n="80" facs="tcp:169869:43"/>
Word, and the Spirit; the hugeſt myſteries that ever were; which no natural eye can finde out: all the parts, learning, and gifts of men, are here loſt: And beſides, they are of ſuch infinite vaſtneſs, that they ſwallow up all other myſteries whatſoever. The very marrow of Godlineſs and Chriſtianity con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiſts and lies hid in the knowledge of theſe Three: it is the right underſtanding of theſe Three, that makes the ſoul truly godly. All happineſs and glory lie involved in theſe Three, the Father, Word, and holy Ghoſt.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Queſt.</hi> But you will ask me, What is the Father? what is the Son? and what is the holy Ghoſt?</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Anſw.</hi> The Father is God, the Son the ſame God, and the holy Ghoſt the ſame God; though in a different manner.</p>
            <p>

the earth, and of the ſea, and of every thing in the earth and in the ſea; that belongs to the Old Creation: for it is the proper work of God, as he is the Father, to Beget and Create.</p>
            <p>Secondly, He is called the Father with re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpect to the New Creation: he is the Father, as he is the begetter of Chriſt, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 2. 7. and as he is the begetter of ſouls to himſelf <hi>by the Word of truth</hi> in the New Creation, <hi>James</hi> 1. 18. as he is the begetter of us <hi>to a lively hope, by the reſurrection of Jeſus Chriſt from the dead,</hi> 1 Pet. 1. 3. and as he is the begetter of us to himſelf by the Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpel, 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 4. 15.</p>
            <p>He is called the Word, firſt, with reſpect to the Old Creation likewiſe; ſecondly, with reſpect to the New Creation alſo.</p>
            <p>Firſt, He is called the Word, with reſpect to the Old Creation, as he is the thing be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gotten in the heavens, and in the earth, and in the ſea, and in every thing in the heavens, earth, and ſea: for there is nothing in them, but holds forth <hi>the power and wiſdom of God, which is Chriſt:</hi> ſee 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 1. 24.

            <p>Secondly, He is called the Word, with
<pb n="72" facs="tcp:169869:44"/>
reſpect to the New Creation, as he is the thing begotten in us in the New Creation; as he is the life, power, and <hi>hope of glory within us,</hi> Col. 1. 27. as he is our wiſdom, juſtification, ſanctification, redemption, and the like. For it is the proper work of the Son, to be begotten in us.</p>
            <p>He is called the Spirit, with reſpect to two things:</p>
            <p>Firſt, as he is a diſcoverer and revealer of Truth and Glory to us, and in us, in the Old Creation: there is abundance of Truth and Glory to be ſeen there, which we ſee not, nor know: every thing of the Old Creation ſets forth more or leſs glory. <hi>The heavens declare the glory of God, and the firma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment ſheweth his handy-work.</hi> And the devil keeps us from looking after the glory of God that ſhines forth in the things of the world. Now it is the onely work of God, as he is the Spirit, to diſcover and reveal that glory and truth that lies hid in every thing in the world.</p>
            <p>Secondly, he is the Spirit, as he is the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vealer and diſcoverer of truth and glory in the New Creation: there is no glory to be ſeen, without the Spirit; and there is no knowing of truth and glory, but by the Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit.
<pb n="73" facs="tcp:169869:44"/>
We may ſeek to finde it out, and la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bour, and weary out our ſpirits, and yet not finde it. It is not the joyning of every mans Learning together, can finde it out: Truth indeed will put all learned Rabbies to a <hi>non-plus.</hi> And ſo for the Glory of God, it is unſearchable; men cannot finde it out, though they joyn all their heads together. <hi>Where is the wiſe? where is the ſcribe? where is the diſputer of this world?</hi> Tell me what is glory of God, and what is Truth. You cannot tell me: for, no man knows the minde of God, but God. Now it is the onely work of God, as he is the Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit, to reveal and make known Truth and Glory to us and in us.</p>
            <p>Again, he is called the Spirit, as he is the leader of the poor creature into Truth and Glory, in the Old Creation. Though God, as the Spirit, diſcovers Truth and Glory to us in the Old Creation; yet, Friends, we cannot be led into it, but by the Spirit: though we ſee never ſo much Truth and Glory ſhine forth in the Old Creation, yet we cannot enjoy it, without the Spirit; the Spirit is that which leadeth us into the enjoy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of it, which is ſweeter then the ſeeing of it. <hi>Howbeit, when he the Spirit of</hi>
               <pb n="84" facs="tcp:169869:45"/>
               <hi>truth is come, he will guide you into all truth: for he ſhall not ſpeak of himſelf; but whatſoever he ſhall hear, that ſhall he ſpeak; and he will ſhew you things to come,</hi> Joh. 16. 13.</p>
            <p>Secondly, he is the Spirit, as he is the guider of poor creatures into Truth and Glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry, in the New Creation. Friends, if there be any Truth and Glory that you poſſeſs, the Spirit guided you into it: for we are ſo ready to go out of the way of Truth and Glory, though it be diſcovered to us, that unleſs we had ſome one to guide us into Truth and Glory, we ſhould miſs of the enjoyment of it, though we ſee it.</p>
            <p>The ſecond thing to be ſpoken to in the firſt verſe of the words, is this: What hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven is, in which the Witneſſes bear re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cord.</p>
            <p>Heaven here, is rhe uncompounded and unmixt ſtate of Saints; it is ſuch an eſtate of glory in which Saints ſhall be, as ſhall not be mixed or compounded with fleſh. That ſtate which we are now in, it is a mixt ſtate of Fleſh and Spirit; but that ſtate which we ſhall be in, in heaven, is a pure ſtate of Spirit and Glory.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="85" facs="tcp:169869:45"/>
The third thing to be enquired into, is, What the Witneſſes record in heaven is. In which, we ſhall conſider four things.</p>
            <list>
               <item>1. What the Father's report is.</item>
               <item>2. What the Word's report is.</item>
               <item>3. What the holy Ghoſt's report is.</item>
               <item>4. How they witneſs.</item>
            </list>
            <p>For the firſt, what the Father's report is: The Father's report is ſomewhat concerning the Son. What is that? See in 1<hi> Joh. </hi>5. 9, 10, 11, 12.<hi> If we receive the wit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs of men, the witneſs of God is greater: for this is the witneſs of God, which he hath teſtified of his Son. He that belie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veth on the Son of God, hath the witneſs in himſelf: </hi>and<hi> he that believeth not God, hath made him a lyer, becauſe he be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieveth not the report that God gave of his Son. And this is the report, that God hath given to us eternal life, and this life is in his Son. He that hath the Son, hath life; and he that hath not the Son of God, hath not life. </hi>See that in<hi> Joh. </hi>5. 32.<hi> There is another that beareth witneſs of me; and I know that the witneſs which he beareth of me, is true. </hi>See verſe 37.<hi> And the Father himſelf which hath ſent me, hath born witneſs of me. </hi>But
<pb n="76" facs="tcp:169869:46"/>
what doth the Father witneſs of Chriſt? See in<hi> Matth. </hi>3. 16, 17.<hi> And Jeſus, when he was baptized, went up ſtraightway out of the water; and lo, the heavens were open<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed unto him, and he ſaw the Spirit of God deſcending like a dove, and lighting upon him. And lo, a voice from heaven, ſaying, This is my beloved Son, in whom I am well pleaſed. </hi>That which the Father teſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fies of Chriſt, is, That he is the Meſſiah, the Son of God; and that he is well pleaſed with his Son, and ſo with us, in his Son. Then that in<hi> Joh. </hi>8. 18.<hi> The Father that ſent me, beareth witneſs of me. </hi>What is that? See verſ. 12.<hi> Then ſpake Jeſus again unto them, ſaying, I am the light of the world: he that followeth me, ſhall not walk in darkneſs, but ſhall have the light of life. </hi>God beareth record of Chriſt, that he is the light of the world, that en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lightens the world; and that he that is a follower of Chriſt, ſhall not walk in dark<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs, but ſhall have the light of life, that is, life's light; that is, he ſhall have that light that is accompanied with life. See that in<hi> Heb. </hi>7. 17.<hi> For he testifieth, Thou art a priest for ever after the order of Melchi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zedek. </hi>The Father teſtifieth of Chriſt, that
<pb n="77" facs="tcp:169869:46"/>
he is an everlaſting Prieſt, to make interceſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion for us, and to take away our ſins.<hi> Who is made, not after the Law of a car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal commandment, but after the power of an endleſs life, </hi>that is, unlooſeable and indiſſolvable life.</p>
            <p>The ſecond thing to be enquired into, is, What the Word's report is.</p>
            <list>
               <item>1. It beareth witneſs of the Father.</item>
               <item>2. Of it ſelf.</item>
            </list>
            <p>Firſt, It beareth witneſs of the Father, that he ſent his Son to be the Saviour of the world; <hi>it teſtifieth what it hath ſeen and heard,</hi> in the Father, and from the Father, <hi>Joh.</hi> 3. 32. The Word teſtifieth of that good will, love, and grace, which it hath ſeen and heard to be in the Father, towards the worſt of ſinners: the Word beareth wit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs of the Father, by its works that it did, that the Father ſent him into the world, to fi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſh that great work of Redemption and Reconciliation. See <hi>Joh.</hi> 18. 37. <hi>To this end was I born, and for this cauſe came I into the world, that I ſhould bear witneſs unto the truth. Every one that is of the truth, heareth my voice.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Secondly, It teſtifieth of it ſelf. See<hi> Joh. </hi>8. 14, 18.<hi> Jeſus anſwered and ſaid unto
<pb n="88" facs="tcp:169869:47"/>
them, Though I bear record of my ſelf, yet my record is true: for I know whence I came, and whither I go. I am one that beareth witneſs of my ſelf, </hi>that I came from the Father, and go to the Father.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Object,</hi> But, may ſome ſay, Chriſt ſaith in <hi>Joh.</hi> 5. 3. <hi>If I bear witneſs of my ſelf, my witneſs is not true:</hi> ſo that Chriſt bearing witneſs of himſelf, is not true.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Anſw.</hi> To this I anſwer; If Chriſt bear witneſs of himſelf alone, that is, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out the Father, and not as one ſent from the Father; then indeed his witneſs is nottrue; otherwiſe it is.</p>
            <p>The third thing to be enquired into, is, What the holy Ghoſt's report is.</p>
            <p>The holy Ghoſt's report, ſee in<hi> Heb. </hi>10. 15.<hi> Whereof the holy Ghoſt alſo is a wit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs to us: </hi>of which ſee in verſ. 10.<hi> By the which will we are ſanctified, through the offering of the body of Jeſus Chriſt once for all. </hi>See likewiſe verſ. 12.<hi> This man, after he offered one ſacrifice for ſins for ever, ſate down on the right hand of God, from henceforth expecting till his enemies be made his footſtoole. </hi>See verſ. 14.<hi> For by one offering, he hath perfected for ever them that are ſanctified. </hi>All which the<hi>
                  <pb n="89" facs="tcp:169869:47"/>
               </hi>holy Ghoſt teſtifieth. And that in<hi> Act. </hi>5. 32.<hi> For we are his witneſſes of theſe things, and ſo is alſo the holy Ghoſt, whom God hath given to them that obey him. </hi>What doth the holy Ghoſt witneſs? See in verſ. 30, 31.<hi> The God of our Fathers rai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed up Jeſus, whom ye ſlew and hanged on a tree. Him hath God exalted with his right hand, to be a Prince and a Saviour, for to give repentance to Iſrael, and for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>giveneſs of ſins: </hi>of which the holy Ghoſt is a witneſs. Now the holy Ghoſt beareth witneſs<hi> by cloven tongues, </hi>that Chriſt is exalted. See<hi> Act. </hi>2. 3, 4, 33.<hi> And there appeared unto them cloven tongues like as of fire, and it ſate upon each of them. And they were all filled with the holy Ghoſt, and began to ſpeak with other tongues, as the Spirit gave them utter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance. Therefore, being by the right hand of God exalted, and having received of the Father the promiſe of the holy Ghoſt, he hath ſhed forth this which you now ſee and hear.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>The fourth thing to be inquired into, is, How the Father, Word, and holy Ghoſt wit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs. They witneſs immediately, that is, without means.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="80" facs="tcp:169869:48"/>
The next thing to be inquired into, is, How the Father, Word, and holy Ghoſt, are one. They are one in ſubſtance, in being; they are one pure eſſence and perſon. He doth not ſay, <hi>They agree in One;</hi> but, <hi>Are One.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>If it be thus, Then this may ſerve to diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cover what theſe three Witneſſes in Heaven are; they are the Father, Word, and holy Ghoſt; three immediate, true, and ſtrong Witneſſes. <hi>It is written in the Law, that the teſtimony of two witneſſes is true;</hi> much more the teſtimony of three. What greater teſtimony can there be in Heaven, then the teſtimony of three? the Father bearing teſtimony of the Son, and the Son of the Father, and the holy Ghoſt of both; all three witneſſing grace and love, to our ſpirits, that we are theirs, and they ours. <hi>Job</hi> ſaith, <hi>Alſo now behold, my witneſs is in heaven;</hi> (ſpeaking of the Father, Son, and holy Ghoſt in unity) <hi>and my record is on high,</hi> that is, in the high places, <hi>Job</hi> 16. 19. <hi>It ſhall be eſtabliſhed for ever, as the moon, and as a faithful witneſs in heaven: Selah:</hi> ſpeaking of <hi>Davids</hi> Throne. So <hi>Pſa.</hi> 37. The witneſſes in Heaven are ſuch as are faithful. Now <hi>a faithful witneſs will not lye,</hi> Prov. 14. 5, 25.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="81" facs="tcp:169869:48"/>
If it be ſo, Then deſire God to open <hi>the Temple of the Tabernacle of the Teſtimony in heaven</hi> to you. <hi>Rev.</hi> 15. 5. It is ſaid, when <hi>the Temple of God was opened in heaven, there was ſeen in the Temple the Arke of his Teſtament; and there were light<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nings, and voices, and thunderings, and an earthquake, and great hail,</hi> Rev. 11. 19. Friends, when God comes to open his Temple in Heaven, then we ſhall ſee the Ark of his Teſtament, and lightenings, and voices, and thunders, and an earthquake, and great hail fall upon the man of ſin in us.</p>
            <p>If it be ſo, Then this may ſerve to diſco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver what the myſtery of the Father, Son, and holy Ghoſt or Spirit is; That they are three, and yet one; one, and yet three: that the Father is one, the Son another, and the holy Ghoſt another; and yet the ſame<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> God va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riouſly come forth. So that Unity brancheth forth it ſelf into Variety, and Variety into Unity: the Father is not limited to Unity, but ſpreads forth himſelf into Diverſi<gap reason="illegible" resp="#UOM" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>y.</p>
            <p>If it be ſo, Then this may ſerve to diſcover the vanity and blaſphemy of thoſe that hold that Chriſt and the Spirit are meer Creatures, and not the moſt high God; For it is cleer from what hath been ſpoken, that they are
<pb n="92" facs="tcp:169869:49"/>
the moſt high God in Unity; and the Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, Son, and Spirit differ not, but in their ſeveral makings forth; all are but one, eter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal, wiſe, immortal, and inviſible Being. And the reaſon why people fall into ſuch groſs abſurdities, is, becauſe they are igno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rant of this myſtery: He that ſendeth, and he that is ſent; He that gave the holy Ghoſt, and the holy Ghoſt that was given; He that ſpeaketh of himſelf, and he that ſpeaketh not of himſelf; He that teacheth, and he that is taught; He that gives, and he that receiveth; He that is the giver, and he that is the gift; He that prayeth, and he that of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fers up prayer, are all but one incomprehen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſible being; and therefore Chriſt ſaith of the Father and himſelf, that they are one: <hi>I and my Father are one.</hi> Till we come to underſtand things thus, we ſhall miſs of the truth, and run into a thouſand errours.</p>
            <p>Thus much for the firſt verſe of the words.</p>
            <p>The firſt thing to be conſidered in the ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cond verſe of the words, is, What earth is, in which the Water, Blood, and Spirit wit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs.</p>
            <p>Earth is the mixt and compounded ſtate
<pb n="83" facs="tcp:169869:49"/>
of Saints, in which they live in this life; which is an eſtate part of fleſh, and part of ſpirit; part fleſhly, part ſpiritually: in which ſtate, there is ſuch a luſting and fighting of the ſpirit againſt fleſh, and fleſh againſt the ſpirit, that a Saint cannot do many times the things he would, but is led captive into the law of ſin.</p>
            <p>The ſecond thing to be conſidered in the ſecond verſe of the words, is, Who they are that bear witneſs on earth. They are three; the Spirit, VVater, and Blood.</p>
            <p>But you will ask me, VVhat the Spirit is, what the VVater is, and what the Blood is.</p>
            <p>The Spirit is God, and the Lord is that Spirit. Now God is the Spirit (as I ſaid be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore) in reference to the diſcovery of truth, and leading into truth: or, he is called the Spirit, in reſpect of his Omnipreſency, or be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe of its Inviſibility: a ſpirit cannot be ſeen.</p>
            <p>The ſecond thing to be ſpoken to, is, VVhat the VVater is. It is that which came out of the ſide of Chriſt, when one of the ſouldiers with a ſpear pierced his ſide.</p>
            <p>The third thing to be ſpoken to, is, VVhat
<pb n="84" facs="tcp:169869:50"/>
the Blood is, that beareth witneſs in earth: It was that likewiſe which iſſued out of Chriſt's ſide. See both theſe in <hi>Joh.</hi> 19. 34.</p>
            <p>The next thing to be conſidered in the words, is, VVhat the VVitneſſes teſtimo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nies in earth are: and in this, there are theſe three things to be conſidered:</p>
            <list>
               <item>1 VVhat the witneſs of the Spirit is.</item>
               <item>2 VVhat the witneſs of VVater is.</item>
               <item>3 VVhat the witneſs of Blood is.</item>
               <item>4 How they witneſs.</item>
            </list>
            <p>The firſt thing to be inquired into, is, VVhat the witneſs of the Spirit is, or what it teſtifieth. It teſtifies of Chriſt: See<hi> Joh. </hi>15. 26.<hi> But when the Comforter is come, whom I will ſend unto you from the Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, even the Spirit of truth which pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceedeth from the Father, he ſhall teſtifie of me, and make known me: </hi>I ſay, The Spirit teſtifies of Chriſt; it witneſſeth Chriſt to the ſoul.</p>
            <list>
               <item>1 It teſtifies of the ſufferings of Chriſt.</item>
               <item>2 Of the glory that ſhould follow thoſe ſufferings.</item>
            </list>
            <p>Firſt, It teſtifieth the ſufferings of Chriſt; it witneſſeth them to the ſoul; it makes known what Chriſt hath ſuffered, and the fruit of thoſe ſufferings; and witneſſeth
<pb n="85" facs="tcp:169869:50"/>
the truth thereof to the ſoul, 1 <hi>Pet.</hi> 1. 11.</p>
            <p>Secondly, It teſtifies of that glory which ſhould follow thoſe ſufferings. VVhat is the glory? That glory which Jeſus Chriſt is in at the right hand of the Father. VVhat is that? See in <hi>Joh.</hi> 17. 5. <hi>And now, O Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, glorifie me with thine own ſelf, with the glory which I had with thee before the world was;</hi> which was with his own ſelf. Now the Spirit teſtifies of that glory, and witneſſeth it to the ſoul. There is always glory following after affliction; and the more affliction, the more glory: <hi>Our light afflictions, which are but for a moment, are not worthy to be compared with that glory which is to be revealed in us.</hi> All which the Spirit teſtifies.</p>
            <p>The next thing to be conſidered, is, VVhat VVater witneſſeth. It witneſſeth myſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cally Sanctification, Purity, VVaſhing, Cleanſing, doing away ſin.</p>
            <p>The third thing to be conſidered, is, VVhat Blood witneſſeth. It witneſſeth Salvation, Redemption, Juſtification, Life, though in a myſtical ſence.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Object.</hi> But, may ſome ſay, How can VVater witneſs Sanctification, waſhing, cleanſing of the ſoul? And how can Blood
<pb n="86" facs="tcp:169869:51"/>
witneſs Salvation, Juſtification, and the like, ſeeing the VVater and Blood of Chriſt was long ſince ſpilt upon the ground?</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Anſw.</hi> I ſhall anſwer this, by asking another Queſtion: How did <hi>Abel,</hi> being dead, ſpeak? <hi>Rev.</hi> 11. 4.</p>
            <p>The fourth thing to be inquired into, is, How the Spirit, VVater, and Blood wit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs. They witneſs mediately, that is, by means.</p>
            <p>The laſt thing to be inquired into, is, How the Spirit, VVater, and Blood agree in one. Thus: They witneſs to one thing: what the Spirit witneſſeth, that VVater witneſſeth; and what VVater witneſſeth, Blood witneſſeth; and what VVater and Blood witneſs, that the Spirit witneſſeth, which is love.</p>
            <p>If it be thus, Then this may ſerve to in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>form us of this truth, That God hath not left us without three VVitneſſes in earth: God would not have us be without three, by reaſon that he tenders us ſo much: he knows our frailties, that we are ready to be ſet up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on by Satan, and to ſink in our Spirits for want of VVitneſſes: he hath given us three, to confirm us, and eſtabliſh us, in our mixt ſtate of fleſh and blood, leſt we ſhould be
<pb n="87" facs="tcp:169869:51"/>
diſcouraged, and ſo faint away in our ſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rits, becauſe of thoſe corruptions and fleſh which are within us: he hath given us his own Spirit, and his own VVater and Blood, to bear witneſs to our ſouls of loving kindneſs and mercy, ſanctification, pardon of ſin, righteouſneſs, and the like.</p>
            <p>If it be thus, Then do not ſay you ſhall not be Sanctified and made clean: VVater witneſſeth Sanctification, and Purity to the ſoul. Do not ſay you are not, nor ſhall be juſtified, that your ſins are not pardoned: Blood ſpeaks it, that your ſins are pardoned, and you juſtified.</p>
            <p>If it be thus, Then ſet to your ſeals to that which the Spirit, VVater, and Blood teſtifie: the not receiving what they witneſs, is the cauſe of abundance of trouble, and ſinkings of the ſpirit. Liſten therefore what VVater and Blood, or rather the Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit in water and blood witneſſeth, and it will force you to ſubmit to its teſtimonies; and thoſe that have received their teſtimonies, have ſet to their ſeals that God is true.</p>

            <p>THere are in the firſt verſe of this Pſalm, theſe things to be conſidered:</p>
            <p>Firſt, what is meant by <hi>foundation</hi> here.</p>
            <p>Secondly, whoſe this foundation is.</p>
            <p>Thirdly, where this foundation is.</p>
            <p>Fourthly, what the <hi>holy mountains</hi> are in which the foundation is.</p>
            <p>The firſt thing to be enquired into, is, What is meant by<hi> foundation </hi>here. It is meant Chriſt; he is a Saints foundation, up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on which he builds, or is built.<hi> We are built upon the foundation of the Apoſtles and Prophets, Jeſus Chriſt himſelf being the chief corner-ſtone. </hi>It is not any thing that a believer builds upon, but Jeſus Chriſt.<hi> As a wiſe maſter-builder, </hi>(ſaith<hi> Paul) I laid the foundation, Chriſt: for other foundation can no man lay, then that is laid, Jeſus Chriſt. Now if any man build upon this foundation, gold, ſilver, precious ſtones, wood, hay, ſtubble, </hi>which are falſe<hi>
                  <pb n="90" facs="tcp:169869:53"/>
               </hi>Doctrines and Principles;<hi> every mans work ſhall be made manifeſt: for the day ſhall declare it, becauſe it ſhall be revealed by fire; and the fire ſhall trie every mans work, of what ſort it is<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> If any mans work abide, which he hath built there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>upon, he ſhall receive a reward. If any mans work ſhall be burnt, he ſhall ſuffer loſs<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> but he himſelf ſhall be ſaved; yet ſo as by fire, </hi>1 Cor. 3. 10, 11, 12, 13, 14, 15.</p>
            <p>The ſecond thing to be enquired into, is, Whoſe this foundation is. It is God's foun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dation, of God's own laying in the moun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tains: <hi>Behold, I lay in Zion for a founda<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, a ſtone, a tried ſtone, a ſure founda<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion,</hi> Iſai. 28. 16. And in another place it is ſaid, <hi>that the foundation of God ſtand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth ſure,</hi> 2 Tim. 2. 19.</p>
            <p>The third thing to be enquired into, is, Where this foundation is: that is to ſay, in the holy mountains. What is meant by the holy mountains? See<hi> Dan. </hi>9. 16.<hi> O Lord, according to all thy righteouſneſs, I be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeech thee, let thine anger and thy fury be turned away from thy city Jeruſulem, thy holy mountain; becauſe, for our ſins, and for the iniquities of our fathers, Je<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ruſalem
<pb n="91" facs="tcp:169869:53"/>
and all thy people are become a re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proach to all that are about us. </hi>And that in<hi> Joel </hi>3. 17.<hi> So ſhall ye know that I am the Lord your God, dwelling in Zion my holy mountain: then ſhall Jeruſalem be holy, and there ſhall be no ſtrangers paſs thorow her any more. </hi>So that the holy mountain is the City<hi> Jeruſalem; </hi>it's<hi> Zion: </hi>God hath laid his foundation in<hi> Jeruſalem, </hi>in<hi> Zion, </hi>for<hi> Zion </hi>to build upon.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>The Lord loves the gates of Zion more then all the dwellings of Jacob.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>There are in this verſe theſe things to be conſidered:</p>
            <p>Firſt, what <hi>the gates of Zion</hi> are. They are thoſe that open into <hi>Zion,</hi> that give an entrance into <hi>Zion,</hi> that let us into <hi>Zion.</hi> It is the property of a gate to let in into ſome place or other: ſo the gates of <hi>Zion</hi> are thoſe which give us an admittance into <hi>Zion.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>The ſecond thing to be enquired into, is, what<hi> the dwellings of Jacob </hi>are. They are theſe: They dwelt upon ſomewhat that was not God; they dwelt upon wickedneſs, as thoſe that know not God do: ſee<hi> Job </hi>18. from verſ. 6 of this Chapter, to verſ. 21.<hi> Yea,
<pb n="92" facs="tcp:169869:54"/>
the light of the wicked ſhall be put out, and the ſpark of his fire ſhall not ſhine; the light ſhall be dark in his tabernacle, and his candle ſhall be put out with him: the ſteps of his ſtrength ſhall be ſtraightned, and his own counſel ſhall caſt him down. For he is caſt into a net by his own feet, and he walketh upon a ſnare. The grin ſhall take him by the heel, and the robber ſhall prevail againſt him. The ſnare is laid for him in the ground, and a trap for him in the way. Terrours ſhall make him a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fraid on every ſide, and ſhall drive him to his feet. His ſtrength ſhall be hungerbit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten, and deſtruction ſhall be ready at his ſide. It ſhall devour the ſtrength of his skin; even the firſt-born of death ſhall de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vour his ſtrength. His confidence ſhall be rooted out of his tabernalce, and it ſhall bring him to the king of terrours. It ſhall dwell in his tabernacle, becauſe it is none of his: brimſtone ſhall be ſcattered upon his habitation. His roots ſhall be dried up beneath, and above ſhall his branch be cut off. His remembrance ſhall periſh from the earth, and he ſhall have no name in the ſtreet. He ſhall be driven from light into darkneſs, and chaſed out of the world.
<pb n="93" facs="tcp:169869:54"/>
He ſhall neither have ſon nor nephew a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mong his people, nor any remaining in his dwellings. They that come after him, ſhall be aſtonied at his day, as they that went before were affrighted. Surely ſuch are the dwellings of the wicked, and this is the place of him that knoweth not God. </hi>Then that in<hi> Pſal. </hi>55. 15.<hi> Let death ſeiſe upon them, and let them go down quick into hell: for wickedneſs is in their dwel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling, and among them. </hi>Now the Lord loves the gates of<hi> Zion, </hi>the outward part of<hi> Zion, </hi>the entrance of<hi> Zion, </hi>more then<hi> Jacob</hi>'s dwellings: he cannot endure dwel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling places where wickedneſs is: he cannot endure our dwelling places, that which we dwell and live upon beſides God.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Glorious things are ſpoken of thee, O city of God. Selah.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>The things that are to be enquired into in this verſe, are theſe following<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
            </p>
            <p>Firſt, what <hi>the city of God</hi> is. It is that in which God dwells and inhabits, and takes up his abode: it is <hi>Zion, Jeruſalem;</hi> it is God's people.</p>
            <p>The ſecond thing to be enquired into, is, what thoſe<hi> glorious things </hi>are that are
<pb n="94" facs="tcp:169869:55"/>
ſpoken of the city of God. See<hi> Pſal. </hi>45. 13, 14, 15.<hi> The Kings daughter is all glorious within; </hi>(which is the Church of Chriſt:)<hi> her clothing is of wrought gold. She ſhall be brought to the King </hi>Chriſt Jeſus<hi> in rayment of needle-work: the vir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gins her companions that follow her, ſhall be brought unto thee. With gladneſs and rejoycing ſhall they be brought: they ſhall enter into the Kings palace; </hi>that is, into Chriſts glory; whoſe<hi> garments ſmell of myrrhe, aloes, and caſſia, out of the ivory palaces whereby they have made thee glad, </hi>verſ. 8.<hi> Kings daughters were among thy honourable women: upon thy right hand did ſtand the queen in gold of Ophir, </hi>verſ. 9. See that in<hi> Iſai. </hi>33. 20, 21.<hi> Look upon Zion, the city of our ſolemnities: thine eyes ſhall ſee Jeruſalem a quiet habita<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, a tabernacle that ſhall not be taken down: not one of the ſtakes thereof ſhall ever be removed, neither ſhall any of the cords thereof be broken; but there the glorious Lord will be unto us a place of broad waters and ſtreams, wherein ſhall go no galley with oars, neither ſhall gallant ſhips paſs thereby.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>See <hi>Rev.</hi> 21. 1. <hi>And I ſaw a new hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven</hi>
               <pb n="95" facs="tcp:169869:55"/>
               <hi>and a new earth.</hi> This new heaven and earth is a ſtate of righteouſneſs: See 2 <hi>Pet.</hi> 3. 13. <hi>Nevertheleſs we, according to his promiſe, look for new heavens and a new earth, wherein dwelleth righteouſneſs:</hi> that is, ſuch heavens and ſuch an earth as is free from all corruption and ſin. This new heaven and new earth is ſpoken of in <hi>Iſai.</hi> 45. 17. <hi>For behold, I create new heavens and a new earth; and the former ſhall not be remembred, nor come into minde.</hi> This new heaven and new earth is deſcribed there to be ſuch an eſtate of glory, in which the voice of weeping ſhall be no more heard, nor the voice of crying, <hi>verſ.</hi> 19. but <hi>Jeruſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lem</hi> ſhall be created a rejoycing and a joy, <hi>verſ.</hi> 18. And he who bleſſeth himſelf in the earth, ſhall bleſs himſelf in the God of truth; and he that ſweareth in the earth, ſhall ſwear by the God of truth; becauſe the former troubles ſhall be forgotten, <hi>verſ.</hi> 16.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>For the firſt heaven and firſt earth were paſſed away:</hi> they ſhall not be remembred, nor come into minde. Which firſt heaven and earth is that ſtate of things in and under which the Saints are now: <hi>Whoſe voice then ſhook the earth; but now he hath</hi>
               <pb n="96" facs="tcp:169869:56"/>
               <hi>promiſed, ſaying, Yet once more I ſhake not the earth onely, but alſo heaven,</hi> Heb. 12. 26. God is now a ſhaking the old heaven and earth, and they begin to fall apace, and to make way for the new heavens and earth.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>And there was no more ſea:</hi> That is, no more troubleſomneſs, confuſedneſs, broils, waves, tempeſts, and ſtorms. This <hi>John</hi> ſaw, and it will ſhortly be fulfilled.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>And I John ſaw the holy city, new Hieruſalem, coming down from God out of heaven, prepared as a bride adorned for her husband.</hi> This holy City, new <hi>Hieru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſalem,</hi> is the Church of Chriſt in her glori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous triumphing eſtate. It is therefore ſaid to come down from God out of heaven, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe it hath all its newneſs and holineſs from God, and from heaven, by which ſhe is now prepared and adorned for her husband.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>And I heard a great voice out of hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven, ſaying, Behold, the tabernacle of God is with men, and he will dwell with them, and they ſhall be his people; and God himſelf ſhall be with them, and be their God. Iohn</hi> heard a voice from heaven, which called him to behold, ſee, and take notice, that God would tabernacle in men,
<pb n="97" facs="tcp:169869:56"/>
make men his tabernacle. He tells <hi>Iohn</hi> that this his tabernacle is with men; he doth not tell him it ſhall be with men; but it is already; he dwells himſelf with the Saints already: intimating unto us this, that it is ſo in the counſel of God. There is a great deal in that word <hi>himſelf:</hi> he dwells in us now by the Spirit: <hi>(Ye are the habitation of God by the Spirit:)</hi> but he will dwell himſelf, in his own proper ſubſtance, being, and perſon: <hi>God himſelf ſhall be with them:</hi> He is with us now, but he ſhall be with us in greater glory: <hi>and he will dwell with us:</hi> Now he is in us and with us for a while, and then withdraws himſelf; but then he ſhall take up his dwelling for ever in our hearts: <hi>and we ſhall be his people:</hi> We are his people now; but we ſhall be ſo his peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple, as that his name ſhall be written upon our foreheads, that we ſhall be diſtinguiſhed from the world: the world ſhall acknow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge us to be his: <hi>and he ſhall be their God:</hi> He is their God now, but it ſhall ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pear to all then that he is their God.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>And God ſhall wipe away all tears from their eyes; and there ſhall be no more death, neither ſorrow, nor crying, neither ſhall there be any more pain: for the for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer</hi>
               <pb n="98" facs="tcp:169869:57"/>
               <hi>things are paſſed away.</hi> Here is a fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther deſcription of <hi>Hieruſalem</hi>'s ſtate. When God comes to dwell among us him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf, when he himſelf comes to be with us, he will put an end to all our ſorrow, and cry<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, and pains; yea, he will wipe away all our tears; ſo that we ſhall weep no more; he will take away death, even that death through fear of which many were all their life-time ſubject to bondage, <hi>Heb.</hi> 2. 15. and we ſhall live for ever in his ſight: and the reaſon is, Becauſe the former things are paſt away.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>And he that ſate upon the throne, ſaid Behold, I make all things new. And he ſaid unto me, Write: for theſe words are true and faithful. And he ſaid unto me, It is done.</hi> Here is Chriſt upon the throne, calling us to behold that he makes all things new. Friends, Jeſus Chriſt is doing of it, and he will reſtore his people into a better and more firm eſtate then they were in in the firſt <hi>Adam;</hi> and for the confirmation of this, commandeth <hi>John</hi> to write it as a thing already done. Things to come, which are decreed in the counſel of God, are as certain as if they were paſt: for God cannot change nor alter: therefore he ſaith, <hi>I am Alpha</hi>
               <pb n="99" facs="tcp:169869:57"/>
               <hi>and Omega, the firſt and the laſt,</hi> ver. 6.</p>
            <p>Now at the ninth verſe he ſaith, <hi>And there came unto me one of the ſeven An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gels which had the ſeven vials full of the ſeven plagues, and talked with me,</hi> ſay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, <hi>Come up hither;</hi> (Here the Spirit of the Lord calls up <hi>John</hi> above himſelf, that ſo he might ſee and receive the viſions of the Lord) <hi>I will ſhew thee the Bride the Lambs wife,</hi> that is, the Church of Chriſt in her glorious eſtate.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>And he carried me away in the ſpirit to a great and high mountain,</hi> which is Chriſt, that ſo he might take a view of the ſpouſe of Chriſt in her glory. Which thing holds forth this to us, that none can take a right view of the new <hi>Jeruſalem,</hi> unleſs they be taken from earth into heaven. <hi>And ſhewed me that great city, the holy Jeru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſalem, deſcending out of heaven from God, having the glory of God,</hi> that is, the light, wiſdom, power, beauty, and excellen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy of God: no leſs then the very glory of God is the new <hi>Ieruſalem</hi> clothed with. <hi>And her light was like unto a ſtone moſt precious, even like a jaſper ſtone;</hi> which is full of beauty, excellency, and glory. <hi>And cleer as cryſtal,</hi> that is, in reſpect of its
<pb n="100" facs="tcp:169869:58"/>
bright ſhining and gliſtering light<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> 
               <hi>And had a wall great and high;</hi> which ſpeaks the ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>curity, defence, and ſafetineſs of the City. <hi>And it had twelve gates;</hi> which ſignifieth this to us, the hardneſs and difficulty of ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mies to enter in. <hi>And at the gates twelve angels,</hi> to keep the gates, that none but the righteous enter in. <hi>And names written thereon, which are the names of the twelve tribes of the children of Iſrael;</hi> that is, all the Elect of God, both Jews and Gentiles, that are not Iſraelites after the fleſh, but true Iſraelites. Which holds forth this to us, that thoſe that are to enter into the Ci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty, their names are written upon the gates of the City. <hi>On the eaſt three gates, on the north three gates, on the ſouth three gates, and on the weſt three gates.</hi> Which holds forth this unto us, That out of all the four quarters of the earth, the Elect ſhall be ga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thered. See <hi>Mat.</hi> 24. 31. <hi>And he ſhall ſend his angels with a great ſound of a trumpet; and they ſhall gather together his elect from the four windes, from one end of hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven to the other:</hi> or, <hi>from the uttermoſt parts of the earth, to the uttermoſt part of heaven,</hi> Mark 13, 27. And ſome ſhall
<pb n="101" facs="tcp:169869:58"/>
be let in at one gate, and ſome at another. <hi>And the wall of the city had twelve foun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dations;</hi> which ſpeaks the ſureneſs of its foundation: <hi>and in them the names of the twelve apoſtles of the Lamb;</hi> to ſignifie unto us, that the ground and foundation of this City is laid upon the doctrine of the Apoſtles and Prophets, Jeſus Chriſt being the corner-ſtone. <hi>And he that talked with me, had a golden reed to meaſure the city, and the gates thereof, and the wall thereof.</hi> Meaſuring with Reeds, was a thing of great uſe, as we read among the Prophets. Becauſe every thing of this ſpiri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tual <hi>Ieruſalem</hi> is glorious, therefore the mea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſuring-reed is ſaid to be of gold. This golden Reed is the Spirit. <hi>And the city lieth fourſquare:</hi> which preſents us with this, The faſtneſs and unmoveableneſs of its ſtature: for round things are eaſily rolled and moved aſide; but ſquare things are not. <hi>Seeing we receive a kingdom that cannot be ſhaken, let us have grace, whereby we may ſo ſerve God, that we may pleaſe him, with reverence and fear,</hi> Hebr. 12. 28. <hi>And the length is as large as the breadth. And he meaſured the city with the reed, twelve thouſand furlongs: the length, and</hi>
               <pb n="102" facs="tcp:169869:59"/>
               <hi>the breadth, and the height of it are equal.</hi> The Angel with his golden Reed meaſureth the ſquare ſide of the City, both in length, breadth, heighth, and depth of it and findeth each of them to be Twelve thouſand furlongs; which after 8 furlongs to the mile, maketh in our account fifteen hundred miles, as ſome ſay; and ſo the whole ſquare of this great City cometh to ſix thouſand miles; which is a great compaſs; and holdeth forth unto us the great largeneſs of this City, that there is room enough for all the inhabitants thereof, yea moſt pleaſant and commodious rooms. <hi>And he meaſured the wall thereof, an hundred fourty and four cubits, according to the meaſure of a man, that is, of the angel:</hi> which, after our common account of two Cubits to a Yard, amount unto ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venty and two yards; which is a great thick<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs, even ſo thick, as no enemy can break in. <hi>And the building of the wall of it was of jaſper;</hi> that is, ſpotty, greedy, green, and flouriſhing. <hi>And the city was pure gold,</hi> without any mixture. <hi>Like unto clear glaſs,</hi> pure and gliſtering. <hi>And the foundations of the wall of the city were garniſhed;</hi> beautified and adorned with all manner of precious ſtones, which were written upon
<pb n="103" facs="tcp:169869:59"/>
the breſt-plate of the High-prieſts under the Law.</p>
            <p>But here we are not to think that the city of God is of ſuch metal and matter indeed, as is here deſcribed: but the holy Ghoſt would give us ſome taſte of it, and, after a ſort, ſhadow out unto us under theſe things, which are of moſt eſteem amongſt men, what the glory and excellency of this new <hi>Hieru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lem</hi> is.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>And the twelve gates were twelve pearls; every gate was of one pearl: and the ſtreet of the city was pure gold, as it were tranſparent glaſs.</hi> All which hold forth to us the braveneſs, beautifulneſs, glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riouſneſs, gliſtering, and admirableneſs of the City. If the gates be of Pearl, and the ſtreet of gold, then what are the inmoſt rooms! <hi>And I ſaw no temple therein,</hi> as was in the old <hi>Ieruſalem. For the Lord God Almighty, and the Lamb, are the temple of it.</hi> As the City hath no need of the Temple, ſo <hi>it hath no need of the ſun, neither of the moon, to ſhine in it:</hi> that is, it hath no need of any light: <hi>for the glory of God did lighten it, and the Lamb is the light thereof.</hi> God and Chriſt is all in all there. <hi>The kings of the earth do bring</hi>
               <pb n="104" facs="tcp:169869:60"/>
               <hi>their glory and honour into it.</hi> Though none of the Kings and Nobles of the Gentiles might be admitted into the old <hi>Jeruſalem,</hi> yet they have free paſſage into this. <hi>And the gates of it ſhall not be ſhut at all by day.</hi> The gates of this City always ſtand open for believers to come in, as not fearing enemies. <hi>For there ſhall be no night there.</hi> All ſhall be light. <hi>And they ſhall bring the honour and glory of the nations into it;</hi> and throw it down at Chriſt's feet. <hi>And there ſhall in no wiſe enter into it any thing that defileth, neither whatſoever worketh abomination<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> or maketh a lye, but they that are written in the Lambs book of life.</hi> No unclean thing ſhall enter in here.</p>
            <p>Now in Chap. 22. to verſe 6. he ſpeak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth of a <hi>pure river of water of life:</hi> This River is Chriſt, who is pure: the Water of this River, is the Spirit, that flows from him, and begets life in us. <hi>Clear as cryſtal.</hi> There is no muddineſs in it. <hi>Proceeding out of the throne of God and the Lamb.</hi> Which holds forth unto us, that God in Chriſt is the original of all our life and hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pineſs. <hi>In the midſt of the ſtreet of it, and of either ſide of the river, was there the tree</hi>

            <p>
               <hi>I will make mention of Rahab and Ba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bylon to them that know me.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>The firſt thing to be inquired into in theſe words, is, What<hi> Rahab </hi>is. It is<hi> Egypt: </hi>See<hi> Iſa. </hi>51. 9.<hi> Awake, awake, put on ſtrength, O arm of the Lord; awake as in the ancient days, in the generations of old. Art thou not it that hath cut Ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hab, and wounded the dragon? </hi>See<hi> Pſal. </hi>89. 10.<hi> Thou haſt broken Rahab in pie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces. </hi>Or<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
               <hi> Rahab </hi>may be taken for the har<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lot.<hi> Heb. </hi>11. 31.<hi> By faith, the harlot Rahab periſhed not with them that be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieved
<pb n="107" facs="tcp:169869:61"/>
not, when ſhe had received the ſpies with peace.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>The ſecond thing to be inquired into, is, What <hi>Babylon is.</hi> It is a great City, <hi>Rev.</hi> 18. 10. <hi>Alas, alas, that great city Ba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bylon.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>The third thing to be inquired, is, What Gods <hi>making mention</hi> of <hi>Rahab</hi> and <hi>Ba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bylon</hi> is. It is his making known and diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>covering of <hi>Rahab</hi> and <hi>Babylon.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>The fourth thing to be inquired into, is, to whom God will make mention of <hi>Rahab</hi> and <hi>Babylon:</hi> and that is, to thoſe that <hi>know</hi> him; to thoſe that are acquainted with God; that have not an outward cog<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nizance of God, but a divine inward know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge of him: God will make mention of <hi>Rahab</hi> and <hi>Babylon</hi> to them that thus know him. What, make mention of <hi>Rahab</hi> and <hi>Babylon?</hi> Why? What is to be ſeen in <hi>Rahab?</hi> Is there any thing to be ſeen that is worth the ſeeing, in <hi>Egypt,</hi> where there is nothing but blackneſs<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> darkneſs, bondage, cruelty, and the like? Yes, <hi>this man was born there.</hi> Who is that? Chriſt. VVhat, Chriſt born in <hi>Egypt,</hi> among the <hi>Egyptians,</hi> where there is nothing but cruelty, dark<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs, and bondage? This is ſtrange. God
<pb n="108" facs="tcp:169869:62"/>
will make mention of this, to them that know him, as an incouragement to them to believe, notwithſtanding their darkneſs and bondage, that Chriſt ſhall be born in them. Or, <hi>Rahab</hi> here<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> may be taken for the har<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lot. If you take <hi>Rahab</hi> for the harlot, then it is thus: God will make mention of <hi>Ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hab</hi> the harlot to them that know him. VVhat, a harlot? Is there any thing to be ſeen or learn'd from her? Yes; though ſhe was a harlot, yet ſhe obtained mercy; and ſo it is an incouragement to us. Gods ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king mention of <hi>Rahab</hi> the harlot to them that know him, is his letting them ſee, that ſhe obtained mercy; that ſo it might be an incouragement to thoſe to whom he makes mention of it, to believe.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>I will make mention of Babylon</hi> like<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe <hi>to them that know me.</hi> VVhy, is there any thing to be ſeen in <hi>Babylon,</hi> among the <hi>Babylonians?</hi> Yes: <hi>This man was born there.</hi> VVhere? In <hi>Babylon,</hi> among the <hi>Babylonians,</hi> thoſe ſinful perſecuting creatures, that held the people of God in captivity: this God will make mention of to them that know him, as an incouragement to them likewiſe.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="109" facs="tcp:169869:62"/>
Behold, ſee, take notice. What ſhall we take notice of? <hi>Philiſtia.</hi> What is <hi>Philiſtia?</hi> A Country, of which the <hi>Phi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liſtims</hi> came. What is to be ſeen there? <hi>This man was born there.</hi> Where? A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mong the <hi>Philiſtims</hi> that fought againſt Chriſt, and were enemies to him.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Behold,</hi> ſee, take notice of <hi>Tyre.</hi> What is <hi>Tyre?</hi> A City, <hi>Mat.</hi> 11. 21, What is to be ſeen there? <hi>This man was born there.</hi> What, born in that ſinful City? Yes.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Behold, Ethiopia.</hi> What was <hi>Ethio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pia?</hi> A Country, of whom the <hi>Ethiopians</hi> came, that is, Blackamores. What is to be ſeen there? <hi>This man was born there.</hi> Where? Among the Blackamores, thoſe ſullied, ſinful, black creatures.</p>
            <p>So that if Satan makes the queſtion, how Chriſt can be born in ſuch an <hi>Egyptian Ba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>byloniſh Rahab</hi>-like heart as thine is; make mention of <hi>Rahab</hi> and <hi>Egypt,</hi> and tell him<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> That <hi>this man was born there.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>If Satan makes the Queſtion, how Chriſt can be born in thee, that art ſo <hi>Philiſtia</hi> and <hi>Tyre</hi>-like; Behold <hi>Philiſtia</hi> and <hi>Tyre,</hi> and tell him, That <hi>this man was born there.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <pb n="110" facs="tcp:169869:63"/>
If Satan tempt thee with thy blackneſs and ſulliedneſs<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> and makes thee queſtion whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther Chriſt be born in thee, from thy black<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs and ſulliedneſs; Behold <hi>Philiſta;</hi> and tell Satan, That <hi>this man was born there.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>As it was ſaid of<hi> Rahab </hi>and<hi> Babylon, Philiſtia<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> Tyre, </hi>and<hi> Ethiopia, </hi>That<hi> this man was born there: </hi>ſo it ſhall be ſaid of<hi> Zion. And of Zion it ſhall be ſaid<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> This man, and that man, </hi>that is,<hi> man and man, </hi>the man Chriſt Jeſus, and the man<hi> David, was born in her.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>And the Higheſt himſelf ſhall eſtabliſh her.</hi> God himſelf ſhall eſtabliſh her with grace, ſhall root her and ground her in him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf, againſt all winds of Doctrine, tempta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions, ſin<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> and the gates of hell.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>The Lord ſhall count,</hi> or, <hi>reckon, when he writeth up the people (among the living in Jeruſalem<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
               </hi> Iſa. 4. 3. <hi>In the writing of the houſe of Iſrael,</hi> Ezek. 13. 9.) <hi>That this man</hi> Chriſt, <hi>was born there.</hi> Born where? In Zion. Selah. <hi>He that hath an ear to hear, let him hear.</hi>

            <p>The Pſalmiſt ends the Pſalm with this ſweet ſaying,<hi> All my ſprings are within thee: </hi>As if he ſhould ſay, I am nothing but what I am from thee, thy ſprings are mine; all my ſprings of comfort joy, parts, are in thee; and if thou withdraweſt them, I die: my lower and upper ſprings are in thee, my leſſer and my greater.

            <p>IN the verſes going before, the Prophet <hi>Iſaiah</hi> gives a deſcription of that diſco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>very that he had of the Lord, and of the time when he had it: the deſcription of his dicovery is part of the firſt verſe, to the fifth: the time when he had this diſcovery, is ſet down in the firſt words of the firſt verſe, which was in the year that King <hi>
                  <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>zziah</hi> dyed, 2 <hi>Chron.</hi> 26. 23. The Prophets diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>covery of the Lord, is as followeth.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>I ſaw the Lord ſitting upon a throne; </hi>as ready to judge,<hi> Pſa. </hi>9. 7, 8.<hi> But the Lord ſhall endure for ever: he hath pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pared his throne for judgement, and he ſhall judge the world in righteouſneſs; he ſhall miniſter judgemen to the people in uprightneſs. </hi>See<hi> Dan. </hi>7. 9, 10.<hi> I beheld till the thrones were caſt down, and the Ancient of days did ſit, whoſe garment was white as ſnow, and the hair of his head like the pure wool; his throne was like the very flame, and his wheeles as burning fire<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> a fiery ſtream iſſued and came forth from before him: thouſand thouſands miniſtred unto him, and ten
<pb n="115" facs="tcp:169869:65"/>
thouſand times ten thouſand ſtood before him. The judgement was ſet, and the books were opened. </hi>See that in<hi> Rev. </hi>4. 2<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> 3.<hi> And immediately I was in the Spirit, and behold, a throne was ſet in heaven, and one ſate on the throne; and he that ſate, was to look upon like a jaſper, and a ſar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dine; </hi>two gliſtering ſtones.<hi> And there was a rain-bowe round about the throne, in ſight like unto an emerald; </hi>which holds forth the Covenant of Grace. See<hi> Revel. </hi>6. 16.<hi> And they ſaid to the mountains and rocks, Fall on us, and hide us from the face of him that ſitteth on the throne, and from the wrath of the Lamb. </hi>And that in<hi> Rev. </hi>20. 12.<hi> And I ſaw the dead<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> ſmall and great, ſtand before God: and the books were opened, and another book was opened, which is the book of life: and the dead were judged out of thoſe things which were written in the books, according to their works. </hi>At verſ. 19.<hi> And I ſaw a great white throne, and him that ſate on it, from whoſe face the earth and the hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven fled away, and there was found no place for them.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Or, the Throne may be taken thus: A Throne denotes Dignity, Rule, Kinglineſs,
<pb n="116" facs="tcp:169869:66"/>
Authority: Sitting holds forth Reſt. The words being thus explained, the meaning of them is this: <hi>Iſaiah</hi> ſaw the Lord ſitting up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on the Throne; that is, ruling, reigning, tri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>umphing, in a peaceable manner, over his enemies.</p>
            <p>

               <hi>And his train filled the temple:</hi> That is, the skirts of his Robes<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> with which he ſate upon the Throne, filled the Temple, that is, the Saints: for they are the Temple of the living God, 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 3. 16, 17.</p>
            <p>

the brightneſs of Chriſt's glory; even as<hi> Moſes </hi>did: ſee<hi> Exod. </hi>3. 6.<hi> Moreover, he ſaid, I am the God of thy fathers, the God of Abraham, the God of Iſaac, and the God of Jacob. And Moſes hid his face: for he was afraid to look upon God. </hi>See that likewiſe in 1<hi> King. </hi>19. 11, 12, 13.<hi> And he ſaid, Go forth, and ſtand upon the mount before the Lord. And behold, the Lord paſſed by, and a great and ſtrong winde rent the mountains, and brake in pieces the rocks before the Lord; but the Lord was not in the winde: and after the winde, an earthquake; but the Lord was not in the earthquake: and after the earthquake, a fire; but the Lord was not in the fire: and after the fire, a ſtill ſmall voice. And it was ſo, when Elijah heard it, that he wrapped his face in his mantle<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> and went out<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> and ſtood in the entring in of the cave. Elijah </hi>could not endure the glory of God, and therefore puts a mantle before his face.</p>
            <p>

               <hi>And the poſts of the door moved at the voice of him that cried; and the houſe was filled with ſmoak<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> 
               </hi>that is, the poſts of the door of the houſe or temple moved. The poſts are thoſe upon which the door hangs: Their moving was a ſigne of God's in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dignation.
<pb n="119" facs="tcp:169869:67"/>
See<hi> Amos </hi>9. 1.<hi> I ſaw the Lord ſtanding upon the altar, and he ſaid Smite the lintel of the door, that the poſts may ſhake; and cut them in the head all of them<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> and I will ſlay the laſt of them with the ſword: he that fleeth of them, ſhall not flee away; and he that eſcapeth of them ſhall not be delivered.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>And the houſe was filled with ſmoak: </hi>Another ſigne of his fierce anger incenſed. See<hi> Pſal. </hi>18. 7, 8.<hi> Then the earth ſhook and trembled<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> the foundations of the hills moved and were ſhaken, becauſe he was wroth. There went up a ſmoak out of his noſtrils, and fire out of his mouth de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>voured; coals were kindled by it. </hi>See<hi> Deut. </hi>29. 20.<hi> The Lord will not ſpare him but then the anger of the Lord, and his jealouſie ſhall ſmoak againſt that man. </hi>Or by ſmoak here is meant darkneſs: ſee<hi> Rev. </hi>15. 8.<hi> And the temple was filled with ſmoak from the glory of God, &amp; from his power: and no man was able to enter into the temple, till the ſeven plagues of the ſeven angels were fulfilled.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>In this ſymbolical Viſion, <hi>Iſaiah</hi> ſaw the Lord; and the diſcovery of the Lord had ſuch an efficacie and power upon his ſpirit,
<pb n="120" facs="tcp:169869:68"/>
that he was forced to cry out, that he was <hi>undone.</hi> So that the words are a fruit of that diſcovery that <hi>Iſaiah</hi> had of Chriſt. And there are in them theſe things to be con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſidered:</p>
            <p>Firſt, Here is what <hi>Iſaiah</hi> ſaid when he ſaw the Lord: <hi>Wo is me,</hi> or, <hi>Wo belongs to me;</hi> it is my portion.</p>
            <p>Secondly, Here is the reaſon of that ſay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, Wo is me; and that is, <hi>For I am un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>done,</hi> that is, cut off.</p>
            <p>Thirdly, Here is the ground why he ſaid he was undone; which is threefold:</p>
            <p n="1">1.<hi> Becauſe I am a man of unclean lips; </hi>that is, becauſe he was vile.</p>
            <p n="2">2.<hi> I dwell in the midſt of a people of un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clean lips.</hi>
            </p>
            <p n="3">3.<hi> Becauſe mine eyes have ſeen the King, the Lord of hosts.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>That which we ſhall raiſe from the words, is this:</p>
            <p>That a true ſeeing the Lord, is accom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>panied with theſe things following:</p>
            <p>Firſt, It undoes a man.</p>
            <p>Secondly, It makes him cry out, Wo is he.</p>
            <p>Thirdly, It makes him cry out that he is a man of unclean lips.</p>
            <p>Fourthly, That he dwells in the midſt of a people of unclean lips.</p>
            <p n="1">
               <pb n="121" facs="tcp:169869:68"/>
I. Firſt of all, A true diſcovery of the Lord, undoeth a man; that is, cuts him off from what he is, or can do. <hi>As for Sama<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ria<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> her king is cut off, as the foam upon the water,</hi> Hoſ. 10. 7. As the foam upon the face of the water is cut off, ſo is that man cut off and beheaded, that hath ſeen the Lord. Or, it may be meant that <hi>Iſaiah</hi> was cut off in his own apprehenſions &amp; thoughts. Or, the word <hi>undone</hi> may be taken thus: An undone man is one that hath nothing to live upon of his own; no victuals or cloathes of his own: Friends, to be undone, is to have nothing to live upon of our own; as parts, gifts, righteouſneſs, doing, working, being, thinkings, conceits, ſelf-perſwaſions, high eſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mation of our ſelves, fancies, fictions, and the like; but to live upon ſomewhat of another, which is Chriſt. There is in a true undoing of a man by the ſight of the Lord, theſe things following:</p>
            <p>Firſt, There is a ſtriking of a man down. When God intends good to a ſoul, the firſt work that God takes with him, is, he ſtrikes him down ſtark dead, that he never lives any more to himſelf, or to ſin, or to the devil, but unto God. In this manner <hi>Paul</hi> was ſtruck down, <hi>as he journeyed with letters to Da<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maſcus:</hi>
               <pb n="122" facs="tcp:169869:69"/>
               <hi>he came neer to Damaſcus, and ſuddenly there ſhined round about him a light from heaven; and he fell to the earth, and heard a voice ſaying unto him, Saul, Saul, why perſecuteſt thou me?</hi> Acts 9. 3, 4. Much like to this, is that in <hi>Rev.</hi> 1. 17. <hi>And when I ſaw him, I fell at his feet as dead.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Secondly, A true diſcovery of the Lord, takes away a man's ſight, that he cannot ſee with his own eyes. Friends, if God intends us good, he will put out our eyes; he will blinde us, that we ſhall not ſee in our own light<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> as he did <hi>Paul<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> And Saul aroſe from the earth; and when his eyes were opened, he ſaw no man<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> but they led him by the hand, and brought him into Damaſcus.</hi> See <hi>Acts</hi> 9. 8. and 22. 11. We would live and ſee, but God will deſtroy our life and ſight, if he intend us good.</p>
            <p>Thirdly, A true diſcovery of the Lord, takes away a mans ſtrength and breath. See <hi>Dan.</hi> 10. 16, 17. <hi>And behold, one like the ſimilitude of the ſons of men, touched my lips. Then I opened my mouth, and ſaid unto him that ſtood be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore me, O my Lord, by the viſion my ſor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rows are turned upon me, and I have re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tained</hi>
               <pb n="123" facs="tcp:169869:69"/>
               <hi>no ſtrength: for how can the ſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vant of this my Lord talk with this my Lord? for as for me, ſtraightway there remained no ſtrength in me<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> neither is there breath left in me.</hi> It takes away our breathing after God, and our ſtrength, our power to do this and that<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> to ſubdue ſin, withſtand temptation, and to wreſtle with God, ond the like. We are ready to vaunt, and ſay, This is that which we have done by our might, for the honour of our majeſtie: but God will, if he intend good to us, con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>found our breathings and ſtrength, yea, all that we are, or can do.</p>
            <p>Fourthly, A true diſcovery of the Lord confounds a mans Underſtanding. See <hi>Prov.</hi> 30. 1, 2. <hi>The words of Agur the ſon of Jakeh, even the prophecie: the man ſpake unto Ithiel, even unto Ithiel and <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>cal. Surely I am more brutiſh then any man, and have not the underſtanding of a man.</hi> Our underſtandings are a great hinderance to us, in the knowledge of the things of God; and till our underſtanding of things be deſtroyed, we ſhall not ſee in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to the truth of things.</p>
            <p>Fifthly, A true diſcovery of the Lord<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtroys our Knowledge, We would and do
<pb n="124" facs="tcp:169869:70"/>
know things; and no further then things do ſute with our knowledge, do we take things to be truth. We make our Knowledge the meaſure of all Truth. But a true ſight of God, will confound it: If once you come to ſee the Lord<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> then you will ſay, you have not the underſtanding of a man; As I was forced to ſay.</p>
            <p>Sixthly, A true ſight of the Lord, deſtroys our Wiſdom that makes us wiſe in our own eyes. We think we are wiſe, and we need not the wiſdom of God, whenas our <hi>wiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom is fooliſhneſs.</hi> We think we carry our ſelves wiſely: but <hi>God will deſtroy the wiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom of the wiſe.</hi> We think we are wiſe to do good, and all other wiſdom is nothing to our own: but a true ſight of God will put an end to it.</p>
            <p>Seventhly, A true diſcovery of the Lord, deſtroys all mans Holy walkings: Not that I am againſt holy walkings, if they be the holy walkings of Chriſt: it deſtroyeth all that a man hath truſted in, and put confi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence in, beſide the Lord; all his natural faith and hope of being ſaved; all his ſpeak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings, pride, ſelfiſhneſs, and the like.</p>
            <p n="2">II. A true ſight of God doth not onely undo a man, but diſcovers ſin to him, and
<pb n="125" facs="tcp:169869:70"/>
makes him cry out, that he is a ſinner, that he is a man of unclean lips, that he hath ſin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned againſt the Lord: <hi>Againſt thee, thee onely have I ſinned, and done this evil.</hi> It makes a man abhor himſelf: <hi>I have heard of thee by the hearing of the ear, but now mine eye hath ſeen thee; where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore I abhor my ſelf, and re pent in duſt and aſhes,</hi> Job. 42. 5, 6.</p>
            <p n="3">III. A true ſight of God, makes a man cry out that he dwells among a ſinful people: O it is a wicked people among whom I dwell and live! It makes him cry out of their ſinfulneſs. A ſoul that hath ſeen God, cries out of ſin<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> whereever he ſees it; and of his <hi>dwelling in the tents of Sechem.</hi> It doth not onely make a ſoul cry out that he is a man of polluted lips, but makes him ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>knowledge, that the people among whom he dwells are ſinful. A man that hath ſeen the Lord, will not onely cry out that he himſelf hath ſinned, but that thoſe among whom he dwells have ſinned.</p>
            <p n="4">IV. A true ſight of God makes a man cry out, Wo is him: wo and deſtruction be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>longs to me, for I am undone<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> I am a man of polluted lips, for I have ſeen the Lord. Friends, if once you come to ſee the Lord,
<pb n="127" facs="tcp:169869:71"/>
then you will cry out<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> Wo is you, wo is you, we are undone<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> we know not what to do; <hi>How ſhall we do to be ſaved?</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>Then flew one of the Seraphims unto me:</hi> That is<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> one of the fiery Angels, at the command of God. See <hi>Pſal.</hi> 103. 20. It is ſaid, <hi>It flew:</hi> It ſpeaks the ſwiftneſs with which it went to <hi>Iſaiah;</hi> it ſpeaks the haſte that it made to him, <hi>Iſaiah</hi> being in an un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>done ſtate. <hi>Having a live coal in his hand<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
               </hi> This Seraphim did not fly empty to <hi>Iſaiah,</hi> but it had in his hand a live coal; it came with ſomewhat to enliven and comfort <hi>I<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſaiah</hi> in this ſtate. But what is this live coal? And whence had the Seraphim it? This live coal is the Spirit: <hi>And the Seraphim, had taken it with the tongs from off the altar:</hi> which Altar, in the type of it, was the Altar of burnt offerings, where the fire never went out, and upon which the fat of the Peace-offerings was burnt: See <hi>Lev.</hi> 6. 12. The Antitype of which Altar is Chriſt: ſo that the Seraphim had it from Chriſt. The tongs are that with which he took the coal from off the Altar. <hi>And he laid it upon the prophets mouth;</hi> or<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> cauſed it to touch the Prophets lips. <hi>And ſaid, Lo, this hath</hi>
               <pb n="126" facs="tcp:169869:71"/>
               <hi>touched thy lips, and thine iniquity is ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken away, and thy ſin purged.</hi> The coal touching the Prophets lips, is nothing but a ſecret perſwaſion by the Spirit, that his ini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quity was done away. God no ſooner ſtrikes a man down dead, and undoes him, but he ſends a Seraphim with a live coal, to tell him good news, that his ſins are pardoned, and his iniquities are done away.</p>
            <p>If it be thus, Then this may ſerve to diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cover a true ſight of the Lord from all falſe ſights of him. Friends, if it be a true ſight of the Lord that you have had, then it hath undone you, taken away your Strength, Breath<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> Underſtanding<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> Knowledge, Wiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom, Light, Life, &amp;c. It hath robbed you of all yours, made you a meer beggar, ſo that you have nothing of your own to truſt to<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> feed and live upon: It hath ſtricken you ſtark down dead; dead to every thing of your own and of the worlds, and alive to God: it hath crucified you, ſlain you, that you no more live<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> but Chriſt lives in you: it hath forced you to cry out, Wo is you, wo is you; for you are of unclean lips, and you dwell among a people of unclean lips. <hi>He that hath an ear to hear<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> let him hear.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>If it be ſo, Then do not cozen and cheat
<pb n="128" facs="tcp:169869:72"/>
your own ſouls: do not ſay you have ſeen, when you have not ſeen him. VVhat, have you ſeen the Lord, and are not dead, and are not undone? VVhat have you ſeen the Lord, and are alive? Do not lye. I beſeech you, <hi>let not a deceived heart lay hold on you; do not feed on lyes,</hi> in this reſpect. If you have not ſeen him, ſpeak the truth, and do not decieve your own ſouls: if you have ſeen him, he hath ſtricken you down dead. If you ſay you have ſeen him, &amp; are yet alive, then I know not what ſeeing of him is.</p>
            <p>If it be ſo, Then this may ſerve to diſcover the goodneſs of God, that when he hath ſtruck a ſoul down dead, and took away his life from him, undone him, forced him to cry out that he is undone, and that wo, wo is he, for he is a man of uncircumciſed lips, and dwells among a people of unclean lips; yet, that God ſhould not ſuffer that man to be ſwallowed up in deſpair, but ſhould cauſe to flie one of his Seraphims unto him with a live coal in his hand, and to lay it upon his mouth, to put life into him, and ſay, <hi>Lo, this hath touched thy lips, and thine ini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quity is taken away<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> and thy ſin purged;</hi> and ſhould ſay<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> 
               <hi>O man greatly beloved, fear not; peace be unto thee: be ſtrong,</hi>
               <pb n="129" facs="tcp:169869:72"/>
               <hi>yea, be ſtrong; As he did to Daniel,</hi> Dan. 10. 19. This is admirable.</p>
            <p>If it be ſo, Be not afraid to be undone, to loſe your Life, Light, Breath, Underſtanding, Knowledge, Wiſdom, and Strength. O it is ſweet, ſweet: do not think much, though God by the diſcoveries of himſelf to you, rob you of all you have<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> leave you a begger. Be not afraid of the diſcoveries of ſin; do not fear that you ſhall be ſwallowed up in de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpair, if God ſhould diſcover your ſelf and ſin to you: ſo ſoon as ever he hath diſcover<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed ſin to you, undone you, taken away your life, he will ſend a Seraphim with a live coal in his hand, a coal that hath life in it, and will lay it upon your mouth, and ſay to you, <hi>This hath touched thy lips, and thine ini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quity is taken away, and thy ſin purged,</hi> Thou art greatly beloved; fear not; peace be unto thee; be ſtrong; and ſo fetch life in thee again, keep thee from ſinking in ſpirit, and being ſwallowed up in deſpair. And you ſhall no more live your own life, but for ever live the life of God; And you ſhall no more underſtand and know things, and ſee things in your own underſtanding knowledge, and light: but in the underſtanding, knowledge, and light of God: you ſhall do nothing in
<pb n="130" facs="tcp:169869:73"/>
and by your own ſtrength and wiſdom, nor breathe after God in your own breath: but you ſhall do all things in the ſtrength and wiſdom of God, breathe after himſelf in the breath of God. <hi>Selah.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>If it be ſo, Beg of God a diſcovery of Chriſt upon the throne; of a riſen Chriſt; that it may undo you, take away your Life, VViſdom<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> Strength, Underſtanding, Know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge, Light, Strength. It is a ſweet thing to be undone, to be ſtript of all a man hath, to lie naked before God; and we to have nothing and be nothing of our own, but to have all and be all in God: it is the greateſt work God can do for a ſoul, and it is the greateſt mercy God can ſhew to a ſoul.</p>
            <p>If it be ſo, Then O that I had a diſcovery of a riſen Chriſt, of Chriſt upon the throne, ſaith the ſoul. Do you know what you de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſire, what you ask for? Are you contented to be undone, to loſe all that you have and are? Are you willing to have all burnt up in you by that fiery flame that iſſueth out of Chriſts mouth? Then he will manifeſt him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf to you, and you ſhall know the Lord in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed and in truth, in your ſouls.</p>

            </p>
            <p>There are in the firſt verſe of the words, theſe things to be conſidered:</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Firſt<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> what</hi> the bells of the horſes <hi>are.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Secondly, what the meaning of that ſay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing is, There ſhall be upon the bells of the horſes<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> 
               <hi>Holineſs unto<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>the Lord.</hi>

            <p>Fifthly<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> what the <hi>altar</hi> is.</p>
            <p>Sixthly, what<hi> the bowls before the al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tar </hi>are.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="133" facs="tcp:169869:74"/>
Seventhly, in what ſence the pots in the Lord's houſe ſhall be like the bowls before the altar.</p>
            <p>The firſt thing to be enquired into, is, What the bells of the horſes are. They are the bridles of the horſes, which govern, rule, and command the horſes. Bridles are ſuch, that are put into the horſes mouthes, to reſtrain them.</p>
            <p>The ſecond thing to be enquired into, is, What the meaning of that ſaying is, There ſhall be upon the bells of the horſes, <hi>Holineſs unto the Lord.</hi> The Prophet having ſpoken before, of the horſes overthrow, and other cattel of the enemies, (ſee v. 15.) he addeth, to make up the meaſure, That all their ſpoils, even the very deckings of their furniture, ſhould be conſecrated to God, to make uten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſils for his ſervice. The meaning is, God ſhall convert to his ſervice, in his Church, all ſuch things as before were employed a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt him. See this interpretation further cleared, in <hi>Iſai.</hi> 23. 17, 18. <hi>And it ſhall come to paſs, after the end of ten yeers, that the Lord will viſit Tyre, and ſhe ſhall turn to her hire, and commit fornication with all the kingdoms of the world upon</hi>
               <pb n="134" facs="tcp:169869:75"/>
               <hi>the face of the earth: and her merchan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diſe and her hire ſhall be holineſs to the Lord; it ſhall not be treaſured, nor laid up: for her merchandiſe ſhall be for them that dwell before the Lord, to eat ſuffici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ently, and for durable cloathing.</hi> Her hire ſhall be holineſs unto the Lord; that is, ſhall be converted to the ſervice of God, which was before employed againſt God. Or, the meaning of that ſaying, <hi>There ſhall be upon the bells of the horſes, Holi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs unto the Lord,</hi> may be this: There ſhall be holineſs ſeen upon mean things poor things comparatively, as a Bridle is: A man ſhall look nowhere, but he ſhall ſee Holineſs writ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten, yea, upon the moſt contemptible things: If a man look behinde him, or before him, or on either ſide of him, he ſhall ſee Holi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs, that is<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> he ſhall ſee ſomewhat of God in every thing in the world; ſhall ſee Holi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs in mount <hi>Zion:</hi> though mount <hi>Zion</hi> now ſeems to be that ſhe is not, black, un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>holy, yet there ſhall be Holineſs ſeen there: for it ſhall ſhine forth, and all the world ſhall ſee it: See <hi>Obadiah</hi> verſ. 17. <hi>
                  <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>pon mount Zion ſhall be deliverance, and there ſhall be holineſs.</hi> As there is writ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten Holineſs upon the breſtplate of our high-prieſt
<pb n="135" facs="tcp:169869:75"/>
Chriſt Jeſus: ſo ſhall there be Holi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs written upon us, upon <hi>mount Zion;</hi> and it ſhall be viſible too, as it is in our Head, and as it was in the High-prieſt under the Law: See <hi>Exod.</hi> 39. 30. <hi>And they made the plate of the holy crown of pure gold, and wrote upon it a writing like to the ingraving of a ſignet, Holineſs to the Lord,</hi> or <hi>of the Lord.</hi> And as holineſs was ingraven upon the Breſtplate of the High-prieſt under the Law: ſo it ſhall be upon us. Conſider that in <hi>Joel</hi> 3. 17. <hi>So ſhall ye know that I am the Lord your God, dwel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling in Zion, my holy mountain. Zion</hi> is holy, but the world ſees it not, and therefore the world ſpeaks evil of <hi>Zion.</hi> Then ſhall <hi>Je<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ruſalem be holy,</hi> or holineſs; <hi>and there ſhall be no ſtranger paſs thorow her any more.</hi> God looks upon <hi>Jeruſalem</hi> to be holy, now; but when there ſhall be no ſtranger paſs thorow her, then ſhe ſhall be more ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly; then ſhe ſhall be viſibly holy; holineſs ſhall ſo break forth in her, that the world ſhall acknowledge her to be holineſs to the Lord.</p>
            <p>The third thing to be enquired into, is, What the Lords houſe is. It is <hi>Zion,</hi> it is <hi>Jeruſalem:</hi> the Lords houſe are thoſe in
<pb n="136" facs="tcp:169869:76"/>
whom he dwells; and they are his peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple.</p>
            <p>The fourth thing to be enquired into, is, What the pots in the Lords houſe are. The pots in the letter, were thoſe that were made uſe of under the Law, and were made of braſs. See<hi> Exod. </hi>38. 3.<hi> He made all the veſſels of the altar, the pots, and the ſhovels, and the baſins, and the fleſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hooks, and the fire-pans, all the veſſels thereof, made he of braſs; and they were ſuch in which they ſod the holy offerings. </hi>See 2<hi> Chron. </hi>35. 13.<hi> And they roſted the paſſeover with fire, according to the or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinance; but the other holy offerings ſod they in pots, and in caldrons, and in pans, and divided them ſpeedily among the peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple, and afterwards they made ready for themſelves and the prieſts, becauſe the prieſts the ſons of Aaron were buſied in offering of burnt offerings. </hi>See that in<hi> Ezek. </hi>46. 22, 23, 24.<hi> In the four cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ners of the court, there were courts of fourty cubits long, and thirty cubits broad; theſe four corners were of one meaſure: and there was a new building round about in them, round about them four: and it was made with boyling<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>places
<pb n="137" facs="tcp:169869:76"/>
under the rows round about. Then ſaid he unto me, Theſe are the places of them that boil, where the mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſters of the houſe ſhall boyl the ſacrifice of the people. </hi>So that you ſee the pots in the letter were thoſe in which the Sacrifices of the people were to be boiled. The pots in the myſterie, are thoſe Divine diſcove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries and manifeſtations of Chriſt, in which the ſpiritual Sacrifices of the Saints are and ſhall be boyled. That they are the diſcoveries of Chriſt that fit a Sacrifice to be offered to God, ſee<hi> Mal. </hi>3. 2, 3, 4.<hi> But who may abide the day of his coming, and who ſhall ſtand whon he appeareth? for he is like refiners fire, and like fullers ſoap; and he ſhall ſit as a refiner and purifier of ſilver; he ſhall purifie the ſons of Levi, and purge them as gold and ſilver, that they may offer unto the Lord an offering in righteouſneſs: then ſhall the offering of Judah and Je<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ruſalem be pleaſant unto the Lord<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> as in the days of old, and as in former yeers.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>The fifth thing to be enquired into, is, What the Altar is. The Altar is Chriſt.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="138" facs="tcp:169869:77"/>
The ſixth thing to be enquired into, is, What the Bowls before the Altar are. The Bowls, in the letter, were thoſe in which was put the blood of the Sacrifice, and of Sprinkling. See 2 <hi>Chron.</hi> 4. 8. <hi>Exod.</hi> 29. 20. <hi>Levit.</hi> 4. 6. <hi>Levit.</hi> 9. 8, 9. Or, the Bowls in the letter were thoſe in which they put fine flour mingled with oil, for a meat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>offering: See <hi>Numb.</hi> 7. 13, 19, 25, 31, 37, 43, 49, 55, 61, 67, 73, 79. The Bowls in the ſpiritual interpretation, are the Saints, in which the blood of ſprinkling is. The pots in the Lords houſe ſhall be like the Bowls before the Altar, in this reſpect, that is to ſay, for multitude; as it was in the letter: ſee 2 <hi>Chron.</hi> 4. 8. <hi>He made alſo ten tables, and placed them in the temple, five on the right ſide, and five on the left: and he made an hundred baſins,</hi> that is, <hi>bowls of gold.</hi> Now the pots were not ſo many. It ſpeaks the ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nifold diſcoveries of God that ſhall be in the later days to his people. Or, it ſpeaks this, that is to ſay, The multiplicity of ſpiritual ſervices that ſhall be offered to God in the later days.</p>
            <p>The things that are to be enquired into
<pb n="139" facs="tcp:169869:77"/>
in the laſt verſe of the words, are theſe fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowing.</p>
            <p>Firſt, what <hi>Judah</hi> and <hi>Jeruſalem</hi> are.</p>
            <p>Secondly, what every pot in <hi>Judah</hi> and <hi>Jeruſalem</hi> is.</p>
            <p>Thirdly, how and in what ſence it ſhall be holineſs to the Lord of hoſts.</p>
            <p>Fourthly, what is meant by the <hi>Canaan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ite.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Fifthly, when theſe things ſhall come to paſs.</p>
            <p>The firſt thing to be ſpoken to, is, What <hi>Judah</hi> and <hi>Jeruſalem</hi> are. <hi>Judah</hi> was one of the twelve Tribes: ſee <hi>Revel.</hi> 7. 5. <hi>Hieruſalem</hi> is the Saints of the moſt High, the Lambs wife.</p>
            <p>The ſecond thing to be ſpoken to, is, What every pot in <hi>Judah</hi> and <hi>Jeruſalem</hi> is. It is the ſame as the pots in the Lords houſe are: Every pot, that is, every diſcovery of Chriſt, that purifies every Sacrifice, and makes it fit to be offered up to God.</p>
            <p>The third thing to be ſpoken to, is, How and in what ſence every pot in <hi>Judah</hi> and <hi>Jeruſalem</hi> ſhall be Holineſs to the Lord. The meaning is, It ſhall be of a holy uſe to the Lord of hoſts, that is, of Armies.
<pb n="140" facs="tcp:169869:78"/>
But of what uſe? To purifie and make fit Sacrifices to be put up to him. Or<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> it may be taken thus: every diſcovery of Chriſt ſhall be holy to the Lord; that is, there ſhall be written upon every diſcovery, <hi>Holineſs:</hi> for thoſe are trueſt diſcoveries, that have Holineſs written upon them. <hi>Sclah.</hi> And all they that Sacrifice ſhall come and take of them, that is<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> of the diſcoveries, and ſeethe there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in: they ſhall boyl their Sacrifices in the diſcoveries and manifeſtations of Chriſt, and ſo make them pure Sacrifices, to be offered up to God, <hi>Mal.</hi> 1. 11.</p>
            <p>The fourth thing to be ſpoken to, is, What is meant by the<hi> Canaanite. </hi>The<hi> Canaanite </hi>may be meant the<hi> Merchant: </hi>he ſeems to have a ſpecial relation to the abuſe of Mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chandiſing and ſelling, which was uſed in the Temple: See<hi> Joh. </hi>2, 15.<hi> And when he had made a ſcourge of ſmallcords<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> he drave them all out of the temple, and the ſheep and the oxen and poured out the changers mony, aud overthrew the tables, </hi>Mat. 21. 2. Or, by the<hi> Canaanite </hi>may be meant the un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clean, perſon: See<hi> Iſa. </hi>35. 6.<hi> And an high<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>way ſhall be there, and a way; and it ſhall be called the way of holineſs: the unclean ſhall not paſe over it. </hi>See Rev. 2. 27.<hi> And
<pb n="141" facs="tcp:169869:78"/>
there ſhall in no wiſe enter into it any thing that defileth, neither whatſoever worketh abomination or maketh a lye. </hi>God will ſo purifie his people, that there ſhall be no unclean thing in them; but they ſhall be ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly and unblameable before him.</p>
            <p>The laſt thing to be ſpoken to, is, When all theſe things ſhall come to paſs; and that is, <hi>In that day.</hi> What is meant by <hi>that day?</hi> The day of Gods coming: See <hi>Zech.</hi> 14. the latter part of verſ. 5. Then ſhall theſe Prophecies be fullfilled, when Jeſus Chriſt ſhall appear the ſecond time without ſin, to ſalvation.</p>
            <p>If it be thus, Then this may diſcover what ſhall be in that day; there ſhall be holineſs written upon every thing: we ſhall ſee ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>what of God in every thing, even in the meaneſt things. And thoſe things that have been made uſe of againſt the Lord, ſhall be turned into an holy uſe: they ſhall be holi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs unto the Lord. The pots in the Lords houſe ſhall be like the bowls before the Al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tar: there ſhall be multiplicities of diſcove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries of Chriſt; that is, abundance of diſco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veries of Chriſt in the latter days: Every pot in <hi>Jeruſalem</hi> ſhall be holineſs unto the Lord; there ſhall be holineſs written upon every
<pb n="142" facs="tcp:169869:79"/>
diſcovery of God: they ſhall come and boyl their Sacrifices in theſe diſcoveries of God: there ſhall no Merchant, no unclean thing, be in <hi>Zion,</hi> in <hi>Jeruſalem,</hi> but all ſhall be pure, <hi>and nothing ſhall hurt nor deſtroy in Gods holy mountain.</hi> So that <hi>Zion</hi> ſhall be a peaceable and pure eſtate.</p>
            <p>If it be ſo, This may ſerve to diſcover what <hi>Zion,</hi> the Lords houſe, is. It is not a Stone<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>walled houſe, ſuch as your meeting-places are: the Lords houſe is his People, in whom he dwells: the the foundation of this houſe, is Chriſt; it is founded upon a ſure Rock, that the winds and ſtorms of corruptions and temptations cannot ſhake it. The Lords houſe is a ſpiritual building, built by himſelf, to be the habitation of himſelf by the Spirit.</p>
            <p>If it be thus, Then this may ſerve to in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>form us of thoſe pure Sacrifices that ſhall be offered up to God in the latter days. Now, our Sacrifices are full of droſs and mixture of ſomewhat of our own; but then, they ſhall be clean: that which ſhall make them clean, ſhall be thoſe great and large diſcove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries of God that then will be. Now, we are troubled and perplexed that we cannot offer up better Sacrifices then we do, to God, that we cannot worſhip him as we would
<pb n="143" facs="tcp:169869:79"/>
do, in Spirit and in truth; but then, we ſhall worſhip in the pureneſs of the Spirit.</p>
            <p>If it be ſo, Then this may ſerve to diſco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver true diſcoveries of Chriſt, from falſe. VVhat a many rotten pretended diſcoveries of Chriſt we and others have had! O how we have entertained falſhood inſtead of truth, and lived upon it! But a true diſcove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry of Chriſt, hath this Motto written upon it, <hi>HOLINESS TO THE LORD.</hi> If your diſcoveries of God bring not along with them holineſs, they are deluſions of Satan: if any diſcoveries of God come with holineſs engravened upon them, receive them.</p>
            <p>If it be ſo, Then this may ſerve to over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>throw that doctrine that is newly ſprung up; which is, that there ſhall not be Sacri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fices offered up to God in the new <hi>Jeruſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lem</hi>-ſtate. That there ſhall be, it is cleer from what I have ſaid: Onely there ſhall be this difference; more purer Sacrifices ſhall be offered up then, then now there are: then ſhall the offerings of <hi>Judah</hi> and <hi>Jeruſalem</hi> be more pure and pleaſant to the land. And that the words here ſpeak of the new <hi>Jeru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſalem</hi>-ſtate, it appears by the laſt verſe: <hi>There ſhall be no more the Canaanite in the land;</hi> of which thing <hi>John</hi> ſpeaks of, when
<pb n="144" facs="tcp:169869:80"/>
he ſpeaks of the new <hi>Jeruſalem</hi>-ſtate, in <hi>Rev.</hi> 21. 27.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Queſt.</hi> But, may ſome ſay, It will be a long while before what you have ſaid will come to paſs.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Anſw.</hi> To this I anſwer, It will come to paſs <hi>in that day;</hi> and how ſoon God may come, we know not: he may come preſent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, and deceive many, for ought that we know.</p>
            <p>Secondly, I ſay this, that <hi>all the promiſes of Chriſt are yea and amen in Chriſt;</hi> and we are not to look upon prophecies and promiſes as altogether at a diſtance, and to be fullfilled hereafter; but <gap reason="illegible" resp="#UOM" extent="2 letters">

            </epigraph>
            <p>IN the firſt Verſe of this Chapter, the Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phet ſpeaks of the coming of the day of the Lord: <hi>Behold, the day of the Lord cometh,</hi> ſaith he: <hi>Behold;</hi> as if he ſaw it, and therefore called upon them to ſee it: and tells them, that <hi>their ſpoil ſhall be divided in the midſt of them.</hi> He bids them be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hold and take notice of the coming of the day of God, leſt it ſhould come upon them unawares. He gives them the reaſon why he would have them take notice of the coming of the day of God: <hi>For I will ga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther all nations againſt Jeruſalem to bat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tel, and the city ſhall be taken, and the houſes rifled, and the women raviſhed.</hi> Here he ſpeaks of the ruine of <hi>Jeruſalem. And half of the city ſhall go forth into captivity.</hi> Here he ſpeaks of leading one half of the City into Captivity. <hi>And the reſidue of the people ſhall not be cut off</hi>
               <pb n="147" facs="tcp:169869:81"/>
               <hi>from the city.</hi> Here, he would ſave a remnant that ſhould poſſeſs and enjoy thoſe glorious things propheſied of in this Chapter. <hi>Then ſhall the Lord go forth, and fight againſt thoſe nations:</hi> or, as it is in the margine of ſome Bibles, <hi>in the middle,</hi> or <hi>among thoſe nations gathered together a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt Jeruſalem;</hi> not as an enemy, but helper. <hi>And he ſhall fight as when he fought in the day of battel for Gideon,</hi> Judg. 7. 22. God ſetting every mans ſword againſt his fellow; <hi>and as at the red-ſea,</hi> cauſing his enemies to be drowned in the ſea, and his people to go over dry-foot. <hi>And his feet ſhall ſtand in that day upon the mount of Olives which is before Jeru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſalem on the eaſt.</hi> God would fight upon that mount againſt <hi>Jeruſalem.</hi> Or, it may be taken thus: By this manner of ſpeech the Prophet ſheweth Gods power and care over his people, and how he will as it were by miracle ſave them. <hi>And the mount of O<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lives ſhall cleave in the midſt thereof, to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward the eaſt, and toward the weſt; and there ſhall be a very great valley: and half of the mountain ſhall remove toward the north, and half of it toward the ſouth, ſo that there ſhall be a very great valley;</hi>
               <pb n="148" facs="tcp:169869:82"/>
inſomuch that out of all the parts of the world they ſhall ſee <hi>Jeruſalem,</hi> which was before hid with this mountain. This is to be underſtood of ſpiritual <hi>Ieruſalem,</hi> the people of God. See <hi>Iſai.</hi> 66. 23. <hi>And it ſhall come to paſs, that from one new moon to another, and from one ſabbath to ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, ſhall all fleſh come to worſhip before me, ſaith the Lord. And ye ſhall flee to the valley of the mountains:</hi> All you be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lievers ſhall run unto the people of God, to be ſafe from the deſtruction of <hi>Ieruſalem.</hi> Or it may be taken thus: The Prophet ſpeaketh of the hypocrites, that could not endure the preſence of God, but ſhould flee into all places where they might hide them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves among the mountains. <hi>For the valley of the mountains ſhall reach unto Azal;</hi> that is, to the place he ſeparated for his peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple; which the word <hi>Azal</hi> ſignifieth. <hi>Yea, ye ſhall flee, like as ye fled from be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore the earthquake in the days of <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>z<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ziah king of Iudah;</hi> which fleeing was with fear and trembling. <hi>And the Lord my God ſhall come, and all the ſaints with thee.</hi> Becauſe they did not credit what the Prophet ſaid to them, he turneth to God, and comforteth himſelf, in that he knew
<pb n="149" facs="tcp:169869:82"/>
theſe things ſhould come to paſs, and ſaith, <hi>And the Lord my God ſhall come, and all the ſaints with thee,</hi> to perform this. The Prophet ſpeaks to the Lord, as his God, and can claim an intereſt and propriety in him<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> as his; as the Pſalmiſt in many places of the Pſalms doth: <hi>Thou art my God, and I will praiſe thee.</hi> Oh how ſweet a thing it is, when a ſoul can claim an intereſt in God, and can ſay, Thou art my God, The Lord my God ſhall come! The Prophet cannot onely claim an intereſt in the Lord, as his God; but he can command God; He ſhall come: he had power with God, as <hi>Iacab</hi> had over the Angel. Friends, what an excellent thing it is, for a ſoul to command God, to have power with God for any thing; to ſubdue ſin, repel a temptation, conquer the devil! A believer hath this pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viledge and power; he may command the Lord, as his God, for things to come, things concerning his ſons, or the work of Gods hands; and he will be commanded by him. See <hi>Iſai.</hi> 45. 11. <hi>And there was no day like that, before it, or after it, that the Lord hearkened unto the voice of a man: for the Lord fought for Iſrael.</hi> See this in <hi>Ioſh.</hi> 10. 14. <hi>And this is the confidence</hi>
               <pb n="150" facs="tcp:169869:83"/>
               <hi>that we have in him,</hi> or concerning him, <hi>that if we ask any thing according to his will, he heareth us: and if we know that he hear us, whatſoever we ask, we know that we have the petition that we deſired of him,</hi> 1 Joh. 5. 14, 15. <hi>And whatſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever ye ſhall ask in my name, that will I do, that the Father may be glorified in the Son. If ye ſhall ask any thing in my name, I will do it,</hi> Joh. 14. 13, 14. <hi>And in that day ye ſhall ask me nothing: Verily, verily, I ſay<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> unto you, Whatſoever ye ſhall ask the Father in my name, he will give it you,</hi> Joh. 16. 23.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>The Lord my God ſhall come.</hi> There are three ſorts of the coming of Chriſt, in Scripture.</p>
            <p>Firſt, There was a coming of Chriſt in fleſh.<hi> Great is the myſtery of godlineſs, God manifeſted in the fleſh, </hi>1 Tim. 3. 16.<hi> Who verily was fore-ordained before the foundation of the world, but was mani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſted in theſe laſt times for you, </hi>1 Pet. 1. 20.<hi> But we have not followed cun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ningly-deviſed fables, when we made known unto you the power and coming of our Lord Ieſus Chriſt; but were eye-wit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſes of his majeſtie. </hi>See this in 2<hi> Pet.</hi>
               <pb n="151" facs="tcp:169869:83"/>
1. 16. Now this coming of Chriſt was to<hi> finiſh tranſgreſſion, </hi>and to<hi> make an end of ſin, and to make reconciliation for iniquity, and to bring in everlaſting righteouſneſs, </hi>Dan. 9. 24.</p>
            <p>Secondly, There is a coming of Chriſt in Spirit. See<hi> Ioel </hi>2. 28, 29.<hi> And it ſhall come to paſs in the laſt days, ſaith God, I will pour out of my Spirit upon all fleſh; and your ſons and daughters ſhall propheſie, and your young men ſhall ſee viſions, and your old men ſhall dream dreams. </hi>See that likewiſe in<hi> Zech. </hi>12. 10.<hi> And I will pour out upon the houſe of David, and upon the inhabitants of Ieru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſalem, the ſpirit of grace and of ſupplica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion; and they ſhall look upon me, whom they have pierced, and they ſhall mourn for him, as one mourneth for his onely ſon, and ſhall be in bitterneſs for him, as one that is in bitterneſs for his firſt-born. </hi>Now all this was fulfilled in part, in<hi> Act. </hi>2. 2, 3. and is yet to be fulfilled. And the end of his coming thus, was, to<hi> convince the world of ſin, of righteouſneſs, and of judgement. </hi>See<hi> Ioh. </hi>6. 9, 10, 11. and to teach his diſciples<hi> all things, </hi>and to<hi> bring all things to their remembrance. </hi>See
<pb n="152" facs="tcp:169869:84"/>
               <hi>Ioh. </hi>16. 26. and to<hi> teſtifie </hi>of Chriſt to them, and to<hi> guide them into all truth; </hi>and many other things.</p>
            <p>Thirdly, There is a third appearance of Chriſt, which is <hi>his appearance the ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cond time, without ſin<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> unto ſalvation, unto them that wait for him,</hi> Heb. 9. 28. Which coming of Chriſt, is the laſt com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of Chriſt; of which I do intend now to ſpeak.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>My God ſhall come. </hi>I can ſay boldly, as well as the Prophet My God ſhall come, (bleſſed be his holy Name:) I can com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mand him, and he will be commanded by me. And not onely My God ſhall come, but Your God ſhall come. He is not onely the Prophet's God that ſhall come<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> but My God, Our God, Thy God, and Your God which ſhall come. What, my God? Yes: ſee<hi> Iſai. </hi>35. 3, 4.<hi> Strengthen ye the weak hands, and confirm the feeble knees: ſay to them that are of a fearful heart, </hi>that is, of an unbelieving heart, or haſtie heart,<hi> Be ſtrong fear not: behold, your God will come: </hi>your God that you ſeek for, and wait for, will come, and he ſhall come. What, to me? Yea, to a haſtie heart. But he will appear to my ſhame.<hi>

<pb n="158" facs="tcp:169869:87"/>
Chriſt's Chariot, in which he will come riding into the world, and into the ſpirits of his people. He ſhall come in this Chariot two manner of ways:</p>
            <p>Firſt, he ſhall come with Power: he ſhall come with power into the world, and the ſpirits of his people: they ſhall feel his power: he will come with majeſtie, and as one that hath authority: he will<hi> beat down the mountains, and every thing that lies in oppoſition to him; the lofty looks of men and women ſhall he humble, and the haughtineſs of them ſhall he bow down: then every one that is prond, lofty, and lifted up, ſhall he bring lowe; all the tall cedars of Lebanon, that are high and lift<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed up, and all the tall oaks of Baſhan, and all the high hills, and the high towers, and fenced walls, and the ſhips of Tarſhiſh, and pleaſant pictures; and the idols ſhall he utterly overthrow and aboliſh. And they ſhall go into the holes of the rocks, and into the caves of the earth, for fear of the Lord, and the glory of his majeſtie, when he ariſeth to ſhake terribly the earth: and then ſhall they caſt their idols of ſilver and gold, which they have made every one for himſelf to worſhip, to the
<pb n="159" facs="tcp:169869:87"/>
moles, and to the bats, to go into the clefts of the rocks, and into the tops of the rag<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ged rocks<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> for fear of the Lord, and for the glory of his majeſty.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Secondly, he ſhall come in great Glory; that is, huge<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> vaſt glory, that ſhall dazzle the eyes of all people: he ſhall come in ſuch glory as ſhall ſcorch the men of the earth: he ſhall come in the brightneſs of himſelf, which ſhall aſtoniſh all fleſh.</p>
            <p>Thirdly, he ſhall come with clouds. See <hi>Revel.</hi> 1. 7. <hi>Behold, he cometh with clouds, and every eye ſhall ſee him, and they alſo which pierced him; and the kinreds of the earth ſhall wail be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe of him. Even ſo. Amen.</hi> Clouds of darkneſs ſhall uſher him in into the world, and all ſhall ſee him; and thoſe that have pierced him, ſhall cry out becauſe of him.</p>
            <p>Fourthly, he ſhall come with his Saints and Angels.</p>
            <p>Firſt, he ſhall come with his Saints:<hi> My God ſhall come, and all his Saints with him. And Enoch alſo, the ſeventh from Adam, propheſied of theſe, Behold, the Lord cometh with ten thouſand of his ſaints, </hi>Jude<hi> verſ. </hi>14.<hi> To the end he

may eſtabliſh your hearts unblameable in holineſs before God, even our Father, at the coming of our Lord Ieſus Chriſt with all his ſaints, </hi>1 Theſ. 3. 13.</p>
            <p>Secondly, he ſhall come with his Angels likewiſe.<hi> The chariots of God are twen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty thouſand, even thouſands of angels: the Lord is among them as in Sinai, in the holy place, </hi>Pſal. 68. 17.<hi> For the Son of man ſhall come in the glory of his Father, with his angels, </hi>Matth. 16. 27.<hi> And to you who are troubled, reſt with us, when the Lord Jeſus ſhall be revealed from heaven with his mighty angels. </hi>2 Theſſ. 1. 7. As clouds and darkneſs ſhall uſher him in, ſo Saints and Angels ſhall be his guard to wait upon him, in his coming.</p>
            <p>I ſhall further hold forth the coming of Chriſt, theſe manner of ways following; and then ſhew you the end of his coming.</p>
            <p>Firſt, he ſhall come in the glory of his Father.</p>
            <p>Secondly, he ſhall come in the glory of Himſelf.</p>
            <p>Thirdly, he ſhall come in the glory of his Angels.</p>
            <p>Firſt, he ſhall come in the glory of his Father, cloathed with his Fathers glory, clad<hi>
                  <pb n="161" facs="tcp:169869:88"/>
               </hi>with his riches, grace, and good will; filled with his fulneſs. See<hi> Mar. </hi>8. 38.<hi> Whoſoever therefore ſhall be aſhamed of me, and of my words, in this adulterous and ſinful generation, of him alſo ſhall the Son of man be aſhamed, when he comes in the glory of his Father.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Secondly, he ſhall come in his own glory, which is God himſelf.<hi> Father, glorifie me with thine own ſelf, </hi>which is<hi> with the glory I had with thee before the beginning of the world, </hi>Joh. 17. 5.<hi> The Lord poſſeſſed me in the beginning of his way, before his works of old: I was ſet up from everlaſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, from the beginning, or ever the earth was, </hi>Prov. 8. 22, 23.<hi> In the beginning was the Word, and the Word was with God, and the Word was God, </hi>Joh. 1. 1.

With all his fulnhſs he ſhall come.</p>
            <p>Thirdly, he ſhall come in the glory of his Angels, cloathed with the Angelical glory. But what is the glory of Angels? See <hi>Heb.</hi> 1. 7. <hi>And of the angels he ſaith,</hi>
               <pb n="162" facs="tcp:169869:89"/>
               <hi>Who maketh his angels ſpirits, and his miniſters a flame of fire.</hi> The glory of Angels is that flame of fire that is in them, and wherewith they are cloathed, which is nothing but their fiery and flame-like ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pearances. The glory of Angels is the ſtrength of Angels<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>

The glory of Angels is their holineſs: See <hi>Mat.</hi> 25. 31. <hi>When the Son of man ſhall come in his glory, and all the holy angels with him, then ſhall he ſit upon the throne of his glory.</hi> The glory of Angels conſiſteth in this likewiſe: <hi>They neither marry, nor give in marriage.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>The laſt thing to be enquired into, is, the ends of his coming. They are theſe things following.</p>
            <p>The firſt is this:<hi> That in the diſpenſation of the fulneſs of times, he might gather to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther into one, all things in Chriſt, both which are in heaven, and which are on earth, </hi>Eph. 1. 10.<hi> And he ſhall ſend his angels, with a great ſound of a trumpet </hi>or, with a trumpet and a great voice;<hi> and they ſhall gather together his elect from the four windes, from one end of heaven to the
<pb n="163" facs="tcp:169869:89"/>
other, </hi>Matth. 24. 31. or,<hi> from the utter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moſt parts of the earth, to the uttermoſt part of heaven, </hi>Mar. 13. 27.</p>
            <p>Secondly, that he might<hi> gather his people together, unto the ſupper of the great God; </hi>that is to ſay,<hi> to eat the fleſh of kings, and the fleſh of captains, and the fleſh of mighty men; and the fleſh of horſes, and of them that ſit on them; and the fleſh of all men, both free and bond, both ſmall and great. </hi>Friends, we ſhall feed upon all our enemies; we ſhall make a ſupper of them all,<hi> Rev. </hi>19. 18.<hi> And I ſaw an an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gel ſtanding in the ſun, and he cried with a loud voice, ſaying to all fowls that flie in the midſt of heaven, Come and gather your ſelves together to the ſupper of the great God, </hi>verſ. 17.</p>
            <p>The third end, is<hi> to take vengeance on them that know not God, and that obey not the Goſpel of our Lord Jeſus. </hi>2 Theſ. 1. 7, 8 9.<hi> And to you who are troubled, reſt with us, when the Lord Jeſus ſhall be revealed from heaven with his mighty angels in flaming fire, taking vengeance on them that know not God, and that obey not the Goſpel of our Lord Jeſus Chriſt: who ſhall be puniſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed with everlaſting deſtruction from the
<pb n="164" facs="tcp:169869:90"/>
preſence of the Lord, and from the glory of his power.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>The fourth end of his coming, is, that he might deſtroy that wicked one:<hi> And then ſhall that wicked one be revealed, whom the Lord ſhall conſume with the ſpirit of his mouth, and ſhall deſtroy with the brightneſs of his coming; </hi>which is Antichriſt, 2<hi> Theſ. </hi>2. 8.</p>
            <p>If it be thus, that My God, Thy God, Our God, Your God ſhall come, yea, will come; Be not afraid of his coming and of his fiery appearance: he comes to ſave you, to redeem you: he brings with him Redem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ption and Salvation: he comes to deliver you from your corruptions, from your tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ptations, from your bondage and affliction. Why ſhould ye fear? <hi>Therefore, lift up your heads: for your redemption draws nigh.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>If it be thus, that My God, Thy God, Your God ſhall come, Do not doubt of his coming.<hi> Say to them that are of a fearful heart, Be ſtrong, fear not; behold, your God will come; </hi>You need not fear but that he will. But when will he come? He ſhall ſuddenly come,<hi> Mal. </hi>3. 1.<hi> The
<pb n="165" facs="tcp:169869:90"/>
Lerd whom ye ſeek, even the Meſſenger of the covenant, whom ye delight in, ſhall ſuddenly come into his temple. Behold, I come quickly; hold that faſt which thou haſt, that no man take thy crown, </hi>Revel. 3. 11. Friends, look to your Crown: God hath ſet a Crown of pure gold, that is, of ſalvation, upon your heads; take heed that Satan rob you not of it:<hi> Behold, I come as a thief: bleſſed is he that watcheth, and keepeth his garments, leſt he walk naked, and they ſee his ſhame, </hi>Rev. 16. 15.<hi> Behold, I come quickly: bleſſed is he that keepeth the ſayings of the prophecies of this book, </hi>Rev. 22. 7.<hi> Behold, I come quickly, and my reward is with me, to give every man according to his work, </hi>verſ. 12.<hi> As the light cometh out of the eaſt, and ſhineth even unto the weſt, ſo ſhall alſo the coming of the Son of man be; </hi>which will be with ſpeed, quickly,<hi> Matth. </hi>24. 27. He hath promiſed that he will come, and come quickly.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Queſt.</hi> But, may ſome ſay,<hi> Where is the promiſe of his coming? for ſince the fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers </hi>and Apoſtles<hi> fell aſleep, all things continue as they were from the beginning of the creation.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <pb n="166" facs="tcp:169869:91"/>

               <hi>Anſw.</hi> Take heed what you ſay. This was the ſaying of ſcoffers that walked after their own luſts<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> See 2 <hi>Pet.</hi> 3. 4.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Quest.</hi> But, may ſome ſay, There are a great many things to be fulfilled and ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>compliſhed before Chriſt comes in this manner; as. The calling of the Jews, The bringing in of the Gentiles, The time of <hi>re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtitution of all things,</hi> ſpoken of in <hi>Acts</hi> 2. 20, 21. and divers other things, ſpoken of in <hi>Matth.</hi> 24. Alſo, Satan is to be caſt into the bottomleſs pit, and to be ſhut up there, and to have a ſeal ſet upon him, that he ſhould deceive the Nations no more, till the thouſand yeers ſhould be fulfilled: after that, he muſt be looſed for a little ſea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon, <hi>Rev.</hi> 20. 1, 2, 3.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Anſw.</hi> To all theſe Objections, I anſwer thus: It is true, there are the Jews to be called, and the fulneſs of the Gentiles to be brought in; but when this ſhall be, no man knows: and, for ought that we know, it may be quickly, in a very ſhort time, in the twinkling of an eye. And as for the reſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tution of all things, which is to be fulfilled before the coming of Chriſt; that may be as ſoon, for ought that we know. And as to thoſe things ſpoken of in the 24 of
<pb n="167" facs="tcp:169869:91"/>
               <hi>Matthew,</hi> which are to be fulfilled before the coming of Chriſt; I ſay, The moſt part of them are already fulfilled, and the reſt are about fulfilling, and will be fulfil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led in a very ſhort time. And as to Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tan's being bound, and caſt into the bottom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſs pit, and there to be ſhut up, and ſeal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, that he ſhould deceive the nations no more till the thouſand yeers be fulfilled: I ſay this, That Satan hath been bound al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ready, and caſt into the bottomleſs pit, and there was ſhut up and ſealed, that he ſhould not deceive the nations: I ſay, he was, com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>paratively to that which he is now; and that he is let looſe again: If ever the Dragon was let looſe, he is let looſe now; and he is now gon out to deceive the nations which are in the four quarters of the earth, <hi>Gog and Magog,</hi> to gather them together to battel, the number of whom is as the ſand of the ſea: And they ſhall go upon the breadth of the earth, and compaſs the camp of the Saints about, and the beloved City; and fire ſhall come down from God out of heaven, and devour them. And after this, the devil, that deceived them, ſhall be caſt into the lake of fire and brim<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtone, where the beaſt and the falſe prophet are, and ſhall be tormented day and night
<pb n="168" facs="tcp:169869:92"/>
for ever and for ever. And if I be out in this, then I ſhall ſay thus, That a thouſand yeers with the Lord are as one day, 2 <hi>Pet.</hi> 3. 8. And by the way note this, That I do not believe that it is ſo to be underſtood, that Satan ſhall be ſo ſhut up, as that he ſhall not decive ſome.</p>
            <p>If it be ſo,<hi> That which any of you hath already, hold faſt, until Chriſt comes, </hi>Rev. 2. 25. You that are Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſſors in deed, and not in ſhew onely, hold faſt your good Profeſſion; let not Satan drag you out of your Profeſſion, into earth:<hi> Hold faſt, and repent: if thou ſhalt not watch. I will come on thee as a thief, </hi>ſaith Chriſt;<hi> and thou ſhalt not know what hour I will come upon thee, </hi>Rev. 3. 3.<hi> Watch ye therefore </hi>when the maſter of the houſe cometh,<hi> leſt coming ſuddenly, he finde you ſleeping. And what I ſay unto you, I ſay unto all, Watch; </hi>Mark 13. 35, 36, 37.<hi> Watch therefore; for ye know not at what hour your Lord will come, </hi>Matth. 24. 42, 43, 44.<hi> But know this, that if the good man of the houſe had known in what watch the thief would come, he would have watched, and would not have ſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fered his houſe to be broken up. There<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
<pb n="169" facs="tcp:169869:92"/>
be ye </hi>alſo<hi> ready: for in ſuch an hour as ye think not, the Son of man cometh. </hi>Surely Jeſus Chriſt is not far off, but will ſteal in upon us unawares, when we look not for him: Therefore watch, with oil in your lamps. And to encourage you to watch, conſider that place of Scripture in<hi> Luke </hi>12. 37.<hi> Bleſſed are thoſe ſervants, whom the Lord when he cometh ſhall finde watching; verily I ſay unto you, that he ſhall gird himſelf, and make them to ſit down to meat, and will come forth and ſerve them. And if he ſhall come in the ſecond watch, or come in the third watch, and finde them ſo doing, bleſſed are thoſe ſervants. But if that ſervant ſhall ſay in his heart, My Lord delayeth his com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing; the Lord of that ſervant ſhall come in a day when he looketh not for him, </hi>Luke 12. 45.</p>
            <p>If it be thus,<hi> Be patient unto the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of our Lord: </hi>be ye patient alſo; for<hi> the coming of the Lord draws nigh; </hi>it is at hand,<hi> James </hi>5. 7, 8. It was nigh in the Apoſtles times; it is neerer now.<hi> For ye have need of patience, that after ye have done the will of God, ye might re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive the promiſe. For yet a little while,
<pb n="170" facs="tcp:169869:93"/>
and he that ſhall come, will come, and will not tarry, </hi>Heb. 10. 36, 37. Certainly he is not far off, but will ſteal in upon us, when we never expect him.</p>
            <p>If it be ſo, wait and look for Chriſt's coming. <hi>Ye come behinde in no gift, waiting for the coming of our Lord,</hi> 1 Cor. 1. 7. <hi>Looking for and haſting to the coming of God, wherein the heavens being on fire, ſhall be diſſolved, and the element ſhall melt with fervent heat,</hi> 2 <hi>Pet.</hi> 3. 12. Look for him from the clouds; expect him to come down in a cloud of darkneſs into your ſpirits: for he will break thorow your darkneſs, and turn it into light. Wait: who knows but that he may come down in a cloud of darkneſs into your hrarts?</p>
            <p>If it be ſo,<hi> Little children, abide in him, that when he ſhall appear, we may not be aſhamed at his coming, </hi>1 Joh. 2. 28.<hi> For as the days of Noe were, ſo ſhall alſo the coming of the Son of man be. For as in the days that were before the flood, they were eating and drink<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, marrying and giving in marriage, until the day that Noe entered into the ark, and knew not until the flood came,
<pb n="171" facs="tcp:169869:93"/>
and took them all away: ſo ſhall alſo the coming of the Son of man be, </hi>Matth. 24. 37, 38, 39.<hi> The very God of peace </hi>(therefore)<hi> ſanctifie you wholly: and I pray God that your whole ſpirit, ſoul and body may be preſerved blameleſs unto the coming of our Lord<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> 
               </hi>1 Theſ. 5. 23.</p>
            <p>If it be thus, Then <hi>Occupie till Chriſt come.</hi> God hath given every one of us a Talent; let us improve our Talents; and let us not ſay, when Chriſt comes (as one of thoſe Ten did) Lord, here is thy Talent, which I have kept laid up in a napkin: for I feared thee, becauſe thou art an auſtere man, that thou takeſt that up thou layeſt not down, and reapeſt that thou didſt not ſowe; but let us give him his own, with overplus; <hi>Luke</hi> 19. 20, 21. Let us not be as one of thoſe Husbandmen to whom God committed his Vineyard till he came; that when God ſhould ſend one of his ſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vants, or his Heir, for the fruit of his Vine<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>yard, that ſhould beat or wound any of his ſervants that he ſends, or kill the Heir, and caſt him out of the Vineyard; leſt he come and deſtroy us, <hi>Luke</hi> 20. 9, 10, 11, 12, 13, 14, 15.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="172" facs="tcp:169869:94"/>
               <hi>And it ſhall come to paſs in that day, that the light ſhall not be clear, nor dark.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>There are three things in theſe words, to be enquired into:</p>
            <p>Firſt, What <hi>that day</hi> is. It is the day of God's coming, of his appearance; as ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pears by verſ. 5.</p>
            <p>Secondly<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> What is meant by <hi>light</hi> here<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> I may be taken either for a natural or ſpiri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tual light.</p>
            <p>Thirdly, What is meant by that expreſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion, <hi>The light ſhall not be clear nor dark.</hi> The meaning is, It ſhall be a <hi>medium</hi> be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>twixt both: part clear, that is, precious; and part dark, that is, darkneſs; not alto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether clear, nor yet altogether dark: we cannot ſay that it ſhall be clear, nor yet can we ſay it ſhall be dark; but it ſhall be be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>twixt both.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>But it ſhall be one day:</hi> Or, The day ſhall be one; that is to ſay, One perpetual day. The Prophet's meaning is, that there ſhall be continual light in the Church of Chriſt under the Meſſiah; though ſometimes more dim and dark then at other times, yet
<pb n="173" facs="tcp:169869:94"/>
ways ſome light. Or, one perpetual day may be taken thus; In which there ſhall be no darkneſs at all: <hi>Rev.</hi> 22. 5. <hi>And there ſhall be no night there; and they need no candle, neither the light of the ſun: for the Lord God gives them light. And they ſhall raign for ever and ever.</hi> Or, it may be taken for a ſingular day, to wit, of Chriſt<hi>'s</hi> death, when the Sun was darkened at noon: <hi>Amos</hi> 8. 9. <hi>And it ſhall come to paſs in that day, ſaith the Lord God, that I will cauſe the ſun to go down at noon, and I will darken the earth in the clear day.</hi> Which thing God did; and ſo re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mained three hours: ſee <hi>Matth.</hi> 27. 45. <hi>Now from the ſixth hour there was dark<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs over all the land, until the ninth hour.</hi> Or it may be taken for the day of Chriſt's coming: and the reaſon of it, are the words following, <hi>Which ſhall be known to the Lord. Of that day and hour knows no man, no not the angels in heaven, but my Father,</hi> Mat. 24. 36.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Not day nor night:</hi> It ſhall not be day, neither ſhall it be night. What then ſhall it be? It ſhall be ſomewhat of ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>But it ſhall come to paſs, that at even<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing-time
<pb n="174" facs="tcp:169869:95"/>
it ſhall be light. </hi>When we look for nothing but darkneſs to approach, when dark night draws on, then light ſhall break forth: when we look for darkneſs, then be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hold glorious light. See<hi> Iſai. </hi>60. 19, 20.<hi> The ſun ſhall be no more thy light by day, neither for brightneſs ſhall the moon give light unto thee; but the Lord ſhall be un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to thee an everlaſting light, and thy God thy glory: the Lord himſelf ſhall be un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to us an everlaſting light: thy ſun ſhall no more go down, neither ſhall thy moon withdraw it ſelf: for the Lord ſhall be thine everlaſting light, and the days of thy mourning ſhall be ended. </hi>See<hi> Revel. </hi>21. 23.<hi> And the city had no need of the ſun, neither of the moon, to ſhine in it: for the glory of God did lighten it, and the Lamb is the light thereof. </hi>In the evening<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>time, when we little expect light, this everlaſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing glorious light ſhall break forth.</p>
            <p>The Prophet further goes on, to diſcover what ſhall be in that day.</p>
            <p>And it ſhall be in that day,<hi> that living waters ſhall go out from Jeruſalem. Je<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ruſalem </hi>here, is to be taken for the City of God, his Saints. The<hi> living waters </hi>here,
<pb n="175" facs="tcp:169869:95"/>
are waters that have life in them, which are the abundance of the Spirit: ſee<hi> Joh. </hi>7. 38.<hi> He that believeth in me as the Scripture hath ſaid, out of his belly ſhall flow rivers of living water. </hi>Theſe ſhall flow out of the Saints: ſee<hi> Ezek. </hi>47. from the firſt verſe to the ſeventeenth.<hi> Afterward he brought me again unto the door of the houſe, and behold, waters iſſued out from under the threſhold of the houſe eaſtward: for the forefront of the houſe ſtood towards the caſt; and the waters came down from under from the right ſide of the houſe, at the ſouth ſide of the altar. Then brought he me out of the way of the gate northward, and led me about the way without unto the utter gate, by the way that looketh eaſtward, and behold, there ran out waters on the right ſide. And when the man that had the line in his hand went forth eaſtward, he meaſured a thouſand cubits, and he brought me tho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>row the waters: the waters were to the ancles. Again he meaſured a thouſand, and brought me thorow the waters: the waters were to the knees. Again he mea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſured a thouſand, and brought me thorow the waters: the waters were to the loins.
<pb n="176" facs="tcp:169869:96"/>
Afterward he meaſured a thouſand, and it was a river, that I could not paſs over: for the waters were riſen, waters to ſwim in. And he ſaid anto me, Son of man, haſt thou ſeen this? Then he brought me, and cauſed me to return to the brink of the river. Now when I had returned, behold, at the brink of the river were very many trees, on the one ſide, and on the other. Then ſaid he unto me, Theſe waters iſſue out toward the eaſt country, and go down into the de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſart, and go into the ſea: which being brought forth into the ſea, the waters ſhall be healed. And it ſhall come to paſs, that every thing that moveth, that liveth, which moveth whitherſoever the river ſhall come, ſhall live; and there ſhall be a very great multitude of fiſh, becauſe theſe waters ſhall come thither: for they ſhall be healed, and every thing ſhall live whither the river cometh. And it ſhall come to paſs, that the fiſhers ſhall ſtand upon it, from Engedi even unto Eneglaim: they ſhall be a place to ſpread forth nets; their fiſh ſhall be ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to their kindes, as the fiſh of the great ſea, exceeding many. But the</hi>
               <pb n="177" facs="tcp:169869:96"/>
               <hi>miry places thereof, and the mariſhes thereof, ſhall not be healed; they ſhall be given to ſalt. And by the river, up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on the bank thereof, on this ſide, and on that ſide, ſhall grow all trees for meat, whoſe leaf ſhall not fade, neither ſhall the fruit thereof be conſumed: it ſhall bring forth new fruit, according to his months, becauſe their waters they iſſued out of the ſanctuary; and the fruit thereof ſhall be for meat, and the leaf thereof for medicine. </hi>So that you ſee what theſe waters are; they are ſuch as are not paſſable, healing waters, waters of life. See<hi> Joel </hi>3. 18.<hi> And it ſhall come to paſs in that day, that the mountains ſhall drop down new wine, and the hills ſhall flow with milk and all the rivers of Judah ſhall flow with waters; and a fountain ſhall come forth of the houſe of the Lord, and ſhall water the valley of Shittim. </hi>The Mountains, here, are the Saints: for they are ſo called in Scripture. The New Wine which they ſhall drop down, is new diſco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veries of the Spirit. The Hills are the Saints likewiſe, caught up into high enjoyments of God. Their flowing with Milk, is no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing but the Spirit breaking forth in an a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bundant
<pb n="178" facs="tcp:169869:97"/>
manner in them, in another conſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deration. The meaning of that ſaying, A fountain ſhall come forth of the houſe of the Lord, is this: There ſhall be ſuch a fountain of living waters, that is, of the Spirit, flow forth from the Saints, as ſhall not be dry. See<hi> Revel. </hi>22. 1.<hi> And he ſhewed me a pure river of water of life, clear as cryſtal, proceeding out of the throne of God, and the Lamb. </hi>Which ſpeaks the ſame thing; onely it holds forth the pureneſs of thoſe waters.<hi> In the midſt of the ſtreets of it, and of either ſide of the river, was there the tree of life, which bare twelve manner of fruits, and yeelded her fruit every month; and the leaves of the tree were for the healing of the nations.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Half of theſe waters ſhall go towards the former or Eaſtern ſea, and half of them toward the later ſea, or hinder ſea. The Eaſtern Sea, here in the letter, is the <hi>Lake of Sodom;</hi> and the hinder Sea is the <hi>Mediterranean ſea.</hi> But take it in the myſtery, and the meaning is this: By the former Sea are meant thoſe that are for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wardeſt in the ways of Chriſt: by the hin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der Sea, thoſe that are hindermoſt in the
<pb n="179" facs="tcp:169869:97"/>
ways of Chriſt. Or, the former Sea, and hinder Sea, may be taken for the Gentiles: <hi>The abundance of the ſea ſhall be convert<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed to thee:</hi> See <hi>Iſai.</hi> 60. 5. It ſpeaks this clearly, A general and large pouring forth of the Spirit.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>In ſummer and in winter ſhall it be.</hi> When it is Summer, and when it is Win<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tet with a ſoul, theſe waters ſhall never be dried up; no, not in the hotteſt time of Summer, as your natural Summer-ſtreams are.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>And the LORD ſhall be King over all the earth.</hi> He ſhall alone be acknow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledged and worſhipped, he ſhall alone reign and rule; none but the Lord.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>In that day ſhall there be one LORD, and his Name one. That day</hi> is to be underſtood of the day of God's coming, and of the appearance of Chriſt.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>There ſhall be one Lord.</hi> Now there are many Lords, but then ſhall there be onely the true God acknowledged. <hi>There ſhall be one Lord,</hi> or, <hi>The Lord ſhall be one.</hi> Now he is twain; then he ſhall be one.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="180" facs="tcp:169869:98"/>
               <hi>And his Name ſhall be one.</hi> Now Twain, then One. O what a glorious ſtate will that be, when there ſhall be but One Lord and One Name worſhipped! Then ſhall be no other Name profeſſed, but onely the Name of the Lord. Though all people now profeſs another God, and <hi>walk in the name of his God</hi> (Micah 4. 5.) yet they ſhall then walk in the Name of the true God alone.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Queſtion.</hi> What is it to walk in the Name of the Lord?</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Anſwer.</hi> It is to walk in the power, majeſty, wiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom, knowledge, light, and life of God.</p>
            <p>If it be thus, that the light ſhall not be clear nor dark, neither day nor night, in the day and coming of Chriſt; Then think it not ſtrange, if it fall out ſo, as ſurely it will. <hi>But in the evening it will be light.</hi> When the night begins to ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proach, and groſs darkneſs to follow, then light will break forth, even the everlaſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing light of God himſelf. A ſtrange thing
<pb n="181" facs="tcp:169869:98"/>
is, Friends, when a man is in ſpiritual blindneſs, betwixt darkneſs and light: ſometimes he thinks he ſees, and ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times he thinks he ſees not; he cannot tell. <hi>In the evening it ſhall be light;</hi> when a ſoul leaſt looks for it. Who would look for light to break forth in the evening! But it is true that it ſhall; therefore, wait for it.</p>
            <p>If it be ſo, that living waters ſhall flow forth from <hi>Jeruſalem,</hi> half of them toward the former ſea, and half of them toward the hinder ſea; Then this may ſerve to diſcover the abundance of the Spirit that ſhall be poured forth in the later days; A fountain of living waters ſhall flow forth from <hi>Jeruſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lem,</hi> to water the world with; The moun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tains ſhall drop down new wine, and the hills ſhall flow with milk, and all the rivers of <hi>Judah</hi> ſhall flow with waters. The Church of Chriſt ſhall be ſo filled with the Spirit, as it ſhall be in them as a Fountain; and it ſhall come flowing ſorth from them, towards the former ſea, and later ſea. This ſhall be in Summer and in Winter; it ſhall be al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ways, it ſhall conſtantly flow forth from them towards the world.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="182" facs="tcp:169869:99"/>
If it be ſo, You that want the Spirit, wait for it: if you believe, out of your belly ſhall flow rivers of waters; a fountain of living waters ſhall flow forth from you, to water the dry and parched ground.</p>
            <p>If it be thus, This may ſoon diſcover who ſhall reign in that day, <hi>The Lord alone ſhall reign;</hi> he ſhall be King then over all the earth; then our Lord will be exalted. Now men reign, and are exalted; but he will throw them down, and exalt himſelf. <hi>And his Name ſhall be one.</hi> His Name is not one now; there are other names beſides his, worſhipped: but God will throw them down, and His alone ſhall be lifted up.</p>

            <head>The POSTSCRIPT.</head>
            <p>THere are three things which moved me to write this <hi>Poſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcript:</hi>
            </p>
            <p>The firſt was, To declare and make known, that that which I have written againſt the Prieſts, was in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tended onely against thoſe that are baſe and vile, and ſuch as take Tythes, and are proud, ignorant, idle, blinde Prieſts, ſuch as are for Gain; that feed Themſelves, and not the Flock;
<pb n="184" facs="tcp:169869:100"/>
that Go, before they are Sent; that teach for hire, and the like.</p>
            <p>The ſecond thing was, To take off thoſe things that have been laid to my charge by Some, concerning my firſt Book; which are theſe:</p>
            <p>Firſt, They affirm that I ſay in my Book, that <hi>I take heaven to be the light and glory of God;</hi> which is true: and <hi>that Satan in heaven, is Satan in the very light and glory of God;</hi> which I deny: For it is an impoſsible thing, and cannot be. Though this I cannot but ſubſcribe to, that is to ſay, That he will admi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſter to ſouls in that ſtate, and teach ſouls to make falſe applications and miſapprehenſions of things.</p>
            <p>And beſides, if they would look diligently into my Book, and ſearch narrowly how things are ſpoken there, they would finde that I ſpeak a quite contrary thing: for I ſay, that <hi>Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tan in heaven, is Satan in glory;</hi>
               <pb n="185" facs="tcp:169869:100"/>
               <hi>and Satan in glory, is Satan in an angel of light.</hi> As in theſe words, <hi>And there appeared ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther wonder in heaven;</hi> the mean<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing is not, that there appeared re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally <hi>a great Red Dragon</hi> in the light and glory of God; but the meaning is, <hi>John</hi> being taken up by the Spirit into heaven, that is, into the light and glory of God, he ſaw the appearance of the <hi>great Red Dragon</hi> there; but not really the Dragon, in the very light and glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry of God.</p>
            <p>The ſecond thing that they lay to my charge, is, the Title of my laſt Book, which is, <hi>A WONDER, AND NO WONDER:</hi> They admire how I can make that which <hi>Is a Wonder,</hi> to be <hi>No Wonder.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>This is a poor thing to give an Anſwer to: But I will ſatisſie them
<pb n="186" facs="tcp:169869:101"/>
ſo far, as to tell them, I make <hi>A Wonder, No Wonder,</hi> thus: It is <hi>a Wonder</hi> to thoſe that are not acquainted with what <hi>Satan in hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven</hi> is; for they ſtand and admire at the thing: But it is <hi>not a Won<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der</hi> to thoſe that know what <hi>Satan in heaven</hi> is; they do not admire, neither do they at all wonder at it, becauſe they know it, and are well acquainted with it.</p>
            <p>And the reaſon wherefore <hi>John</hi> called it <hi>A Wonder,</hi> was, Becauſe he knew not what <hi>Satan in heaven</hi> was, he was not acquainted with <hi>Satan in an angel of light.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Conſider that place in<hi> 2 Cor. 11. 14<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> And no marvel: for Satan himſelf is changed into an angel of light.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>The reſt of the things they lay to my charge, are words in my Book which are falſly printed; for which
<pb n="187" facs="tcp:169869:101"/>
the Printer indeed is to be blamed, not I.</p>
            <p>The third thing that moved me to write this<hi> Poſtſcript, </hi>was, To an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwer a poor weak ſaying of one whom I forbear to name, which was this:<hi> There are many that take upon them to write now a days, but I know no warrant for any of them to write, ſeeing there are ſo many learned, able, and godly men, that do write; unleſs they could write ſome New Truth, that was never heard of be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>To the firſt, I ask you this: Is all Truth in learned godly men? Have none but they a warrant to write? May not a childe of God, that hath no Learning at all, be en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dued with the Spirit, and power from on high, and ſo be made as fit as they to preach and write? Is not the
<pb n="188" facs="tcp:169869:102"/>
ſame Spirit in one, as in the other? Certainly you have loſt your Senſes; you ſeem to hold that which many ignorant Prieſts do; that is to ſay, That none are ſo able to deliver and write Truth, as themſelves are. I am ſure that godly learned men will not aſſume this to themſelves, but will eſteem others above themſelves. There is that revealed, many times, to a poor, ignorant, weak Chriſtian, that learned Chriſtians are ignorant of: and I have ſeen that written by a Babe, the like whereof I never ſaw come from learned Profeſſors, though they were godly. I ſpeak not this to diſcourage them, or to ſet light by them; but to take off partiality: and my end in anſwering the foreſaid ſaying, was (God knows) That thoſe that heard it, might not be led aſide by it, but that they might ſee the va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity of it, and that it proceeded either from Ignorance or Envie</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="189" facs="tcp:169869:102"/>
To the ſecond, I ſay, There is no Truth new, that is to be written; but that which is written, and ſhall be written, is the old Truth. It is true, in one ſence, old Truth may be new; as in that ſence, <hi>I write to you a new Commandment:</hi> it was new to them, becauſe they had not practiſed it before; but yet it was the old Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mandment, which was, That they ſhould <hi>love one another.</hi> Now he that writes, must write old Truth, that was heretofore, or elſe he muſt write a Lye: <hi>There is nothing new un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der the ſun.</hi> There are many hidden old Truths which you and others know not, though ye and others think ye know them; and therefore they may write them, and declare them, if they be called to it of God. And thoſe that think themſelves to know most, know least, yea, are very fools: nay, a man may write thoſe things that you and others haply know to be Truth: for
<pb n="190" facs="tcp:169869:103"/>
though you and others know them to be Truth, yet haply others do not; ſo that he writes the things he hath ſeen, felt, and handled: but for any to write the things of another (as he may) which he hath not ſeen nor felt, this is not lawful.</p>
