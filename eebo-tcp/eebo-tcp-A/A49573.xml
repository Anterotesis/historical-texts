            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            <p>THIS Play was Written by the Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thor in <hi>France</hi> above twelve Years past, without any design of becoming Publick, but only as an Exercise to learn to Write, at an Age when many are but begin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning to Spell. It was afterwards accidentally communicated to some Persons, and begg'd by a Friend, who propos'd to make some Advantage by it, which was consented to upon Promise that the Author should never be nam'd. Thus it remain'd for some Years in other Hands, till at last the Author was importun'd to own it, or his Friend had been
<pb facs="tcp:99818:4"/>
disappointed. Some few Alterations were made to suit it only to the present time of Acting; in every thing else the Play is the same as at first, even to the Songs, and the Epilogue as it is printed. If his Friend has had a Third Day to his Satisfaction, it is all the end that the Author propos'd to himself: And if before the ordinary Age of Manhood, he<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

               <p>Yes, and be told it. Know then, my dear <hi>Angelica,</hi> that thÃ´ in publick I have been an Enemy declar'd to Love, yet we have held a private Correspondence together. And what may seem yet more <hi>Bizarre,</hi> the Man in the World whom I have al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ways us'd worst, is he whom I have lov'd best. I know what Dissemblers are Men, and am resolv'd to enquire thorowly into my Lover, before I discover my Inclinations. If I find <hi>Frede<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rick</hi> loves me sincerely, and is a Man of Honour, I will then ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plain my self in his favour: But if I prove him unworthy, my Aversion, that is now but Pretence, shall be real, and he shall never so much as suspect that I have had the least good thought of him.</p>

               <p>In pursuance therefore of this Design, I have already made a friendship with him, passing for my own Brother <hi>Court<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>all,</hi> whom every one knows to resemble me so entirely, that we have often, by changing of habits, been mistaken the one for the other. Thus have I many opportunities to pry into his most secret affections, to examin his humour, and sound him to the bottom: But the Jest on't is, that he has propos'd a cross Match to me, proffering me the choice of his four Sisters, provided I will undertake to persuade <hi>Constantia</hi> to relent; to which I have agreed, and have accordingly made formal Address to all four.</p>

               <p>Yes, and am hugely diverted; for, you must know, their Brother has strictly instructed 'em to be wanting in no kind of encouragement: I never rise in a morning, but I find my Toilette cover'd with Presents, Rings, Bracelets, Perfumes, and a world of fine things; for which I make equal acknow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledgments

No, give me the Lover that's free, who never pries into my Affairs, who has his Secrets, and lets me have mine; for so all private Reck'nings are handsomely discharg'd, no matter for the rest, that's the Husband for me.</p>

               <p>Ay, igad, or resolve to lie alone. Why yonder's my Lady <hi>Homely,</hi> 'tis hard to remember when she was young, and yet her doors are always blockt up with Coaches and Chairs; whil'st in the mean time my Lady <hi>Lovely</hi> scarce re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceives a Visit from morning to night, and yet is the most beau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiful Woman in Town.</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>Lad. Dor.</speaker>
               <p>And what say you is the Reason of this?</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>Sir Toby.</speaker>
               <p>The Reason is plain: The first gives to her Gal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lants, what the other reserves for a Portion for a Daughter, or bestows in charitable Uses to the Poor. Besides, it has been always the fashion for great Ladies when they are a little turn'd of their Prime; and your Ladyship is too considerable to be out at any thing that's a fashion.</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>Lad. Dor.</speaker>
               <p>'Tis true, a Woman of Quality shou'd be in all the Fashions: But pray inform me, how is this Keeping? Do Men of Quality take Money? Or is it by Presents of Jewels, and such things?</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>Sir Toby.</speaker>
               <p>Nothing like ready Money, adzooks. A thousand Guinea's in ready Cash, tickles a young Fellow beyond a Jewel
<pb n="33" facs="tcp:99818:21"/>
of twice the value: Not but that a Jewel now and then by the by, is a pretty Provocative; but however a setled Quarteridge is necessary.</p>

            <sp>
               <speaker>Lad. Dor.</speaker>
               <p>I protest you are a very Learned Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son.</p>

            <sp>
               <speaker>Sir Toby.</speaker>
               <p>Besides the standing Pension, there must be an al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowance too for Extraordinaries: for Example; <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>â€¢</desc>
                  </gap>or Balls at Court, and publick appearances of that kind. At such times, I say, the Courtiers will give themselves to the Devil for a lit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle money, especially in hard times, when Salaries are ill paid.</p>

               <p>
                  <hi>Sir Toby</hi> you have convinc'd me; but yet there remains a main Point to be consider'd, which is, how to im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pose upon the Town. This Town is a prying malicious place; as long as the Town do's not talk, our Honour is safe; and as long as our Honour is safe, there's no harm done: for 'tis a receiv'd Maxim among us Ladies, That 'tis the Talk, and not the Intrigue, that's the Crime.</p>

               <speaker>Sir Toby.</speaker>
               <p>The way to keep the Town Civil, is to be openly Scandalous and Lewd. We never talk out of Aver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sion to the Guilty, but Spight to the Innocent; and care not to expose those who do Ill, but defame those who do Well. Believe me, the only way to gain an ill Reputa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, is to live Chaste; the Town abhors Modesty and Ver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tue, but Impudence and Vice are its inseparable Compani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons: Be as wicked as you please, th<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

               <p>O, no matter for that. I'll tell you their Method; they spread themselves in Parties all over the House; some in the Pit, some in the Boxes, others in the Gal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leries, but principally on the Stage; they Cough, Sneeze, talk Loud, and break silly Jests; sometimes Laughing,
<pb n="40" facs="tcp:99818:25"/>
sometimes Singing, sometimes Whistling, till the House is in an Uproar; some Laugh and Clap; some Hiss and are Angry; Swords are drawn, the Actors interrupt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, the Scene broken off, and so the Play's sent to the Devil.</p>

               <p>'Tis fit, Madam, that some new ways should be invented to engage the Ladies; 'tis dull to tread always in the same path. And nothing is found so prevailing as these mute Accomplishments. Writing, and saying fine things, have given place to the Caper, the Flute, and the Voice.</p>

               <speaker>Lucin.</speaker>
               <p>If you examine strictly into the miscarriages of most Wives, you will find 'em grounded upon the neglect of their Husbands, and the Ill Usage they receive, more than their own Inclinations to Evil.</p>

               <p>Resentment has made more Cuckolds than Incon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stancy: Women are naturally Fond and Faithful; but they are Revengeful, and of all Provocations, Neglect is the greatest.</p>

               <p>It is not therefore to us, but to themselves, that they owe their Misfortunes.

               <p>The most Prepostterous Abuse in Marriage is, when
<pb n="73" facs="tcp:99818:41"/>
upon Agreement of Friends, two that know nothing of one â€”anothers minds, are to lye together at first sight; this, as to the World, is coming together Honourably: A Woman that is sold for all her Life long, is a Wife; and she that is sold but for a Quarter of an Hour, is a Whore.</p>
