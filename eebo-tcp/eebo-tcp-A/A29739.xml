            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>

CONFERENCES
BETWEEN
<hi>Some of thoſe that are called</hi>

Concerning their different

ONE
Whereof, was appointed with M<hi rend="sup">r.</hi>
BURTON, and a number of his Church, and
the other, with Mr. <hi>John Goodwin,</hi> and ſome of
his Church; which was occaſioned by a Gentlewoman
being a Member thereof, whoſe Husband is
one of the <hi>Separation:</hi> with a Letter
written to that purpoſe.</p>
            <p>NOW
Publiſhed by D. B. for reſolution of thoſe who are
doubtfull, in all or any of the matters here controverted;
chiefly concerning the <hi>High places,</hi> which are uſually
called <hi>Churches,</hi> and now of late by the
Souldiers, <hi>Steeple-houſes.</hi>

            <p>LONDON,

            <head>To the impartial Reader.</head>
            <p>
               <seg rend="decorInit">T</seg>Here being a meeting appointed between Mr.
<hi>Burton,</hi> with ſome of his Congregation, and ſome
of my judgement in matters of Religion, that both
they and we might conferre together, and the
better know the difference of our profeſſions and
practiſes, and ſo indeavour (if poſſible) to be of our
mind, concerning the truth; at which meeting, we expected accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dingly
to have had all matters in controverſie between us, fully and
lovingly, debated; but the iſſue did not prove, as we could have
wiſhed.</p>
            <p>Again, upon an other occaſion of ſome difference alſo, in certain
points of Religion, between a Sea Captain and his wife, he being one
of our Members, and ſhe of Mr. <hi>John Goodwins:</hi> a meeting
likewiſe was appointed between him, with ſome of his Church, and
ſome of ours, at which meeting thoſe matters were diſcuſſed at
large, though many lets (as in the former) were caſt in the way, to
hinder both the progreſs and concluſion thereof.</p>
            <p>Now, ſeeing the firſt of theſe conferences was above ſix yeares a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>goe,
and the laſt about one year agoe, and both of them written
when they were recent in the memory, it may thereby appear, how
unwilling all or any of us (though having the better part, as
we hope) have been, to divulge them or any of them to publick view.</p>
            <p>But now upon further conſideration, and weighing the matter
more ſeriouſly, (as in aballance) I find that in the one ſcale, all the
prejudice and diſcontent, which the other party may poſſibly take
without any juſt cauſe, in that we thus ſhew here to the world, both
their parts and ours, to be all very light; in compariſon of the ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nerality
of the peoples great ignorance, and manifold doubts in the
other ſcale; who are ſtill captivated in <hi>Babel,</hi> and both miſled and
blindfolded, not onely by the Clergy in general, who ſucceed their
Lords and Maſters, the <hi>Biſhops,</hi> (howbeit the Servant be not a-above
his Lord) but even ſtill for ſiniſter ends, by the moſt ſmooth
and ſubtle ſort of them, who make a greater ſhew of godlineſs, and
reformation then the reſt, ſuch us this Mr. <hi>Goodwin</hi> is, and Mr.
<hi>Burton</hi> was.</p>
            <p>
               <pb facs="tcp:66521:3"/>
This ignorance and doubting doth conſiſt in divers particulars con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerning
the ſacred worſhip of God, chiefly the <hi>high places,</hi> otherwiſe
called Churches and Steeple-houſes, here in both conferences contro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verted:
although their <hi>national Church-worſhip, worſhippers,
Miniſtry, Covernment, and maintenance,</hi> are there by the ſcope of
all to be obſerved: in which and many other, moſt of the people are
alſo very ignorant and doubtful.</p>
            <p>And conſidering, as on the one ſide, that no man ought to hide his
Talent, nor be a ſelf-lover; but every Chriſtian eſpecially, is to
diſpenſe whatſoever meaſure of gift he hath received, to the good of
others; ſo on the other ſide, what great need there is ſtill (as was
ſaid) both of information and reſolution in the aforeſaid matters,
(notwithſtanding all the floods of books now a dayes, concerning o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
ſubjects.</p>
            <p>And although Mr. <hi>Chidley</hi> (my yoak-fellow in the firſt, and
both for himſelf and me in the laſt,) was ſomewhat averſe to the
publiſhing of the buſineſs, yet ſince we are of one mind in the
particulars thereof, the reſt of us have thus brought both Conferences
to publick obſervation, chiefly concerning the <hi>high-places,</hi> for though
we have often heard, that howbeit <hi>Rome was not built in one day,
(as the proverb is)</hi> yet a greater number of <hi>Romiſh</hi> houſes, ſuch as
the Monaſteries, Abbies and Nunries both in <hi>Scotland</hi> and <hi>Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land,</hi>
were demoliſhed in one day formerly, then there have been
Croſſes pulled down, either on Steeples or Streetes, in a hundred of
theſe dayes, now wherein we live, notwithſtanding there were both
far more letts, and fewer pretences of reformation, in thoſe dayes
then in theſe.</p>
            <p>Thus, having no further occaſion here, to hinder thee from this
good occaſion it ſelf, I refer thee to take hold thereof, and of all things
elſe, which may adde to thy knowledge and ſanctification, as I wiſh
to do my-ſelf, whiles there is any time or opportunity yet remaining:
onely at preſent, I intreat thee, that what degree of profit ſoever
thou reapeſt hereby, thou wilt give unto God (as the onely true
owner) the whole praiſe: and as for me his weak inſtrument in this
behalf, if I incur no juſt diſpraiſe, I ſhall reſt fully and gladly
contented,</p>
            <closer>
               <signed>Thine, as thou both deſireſt and endea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>voureſt,

            <head>Two Conferences, between ſome
of thoſe that are called Separatiſts and
Independents, concerning their differ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ent
Tenents.</head>
            <p>THere being a <hi>Conference</hi> in <hi>London,</hi> appointed be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween
ſome of thoſe Chriſtians, uſually called the <hi>Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>paration,</hi>
and Mr. <hi>Burton,</hi> a Paſtor of an <hi>Independant</hi>
Church, concerning ſome differences between them,
and divers <hi>Separatiſts</hi> coming to his houſe in <hi>Fryday-ſtreet,</hi> for
that purpoſe, upon the 17. day of the 4. moneth, 1645. being
the 5. day of the week, after Church-exerciſe, and onely three
of them having occaſion to ſpeak, <hi>viz.</hi> Mr. <hi>Brown,</hi> Mr. <hi>Duppa,</hi>
and Mr. <hi>Chidley;</hi> and the ſaid Mr. <hi>Brown,</hi> immediatly after the
<hi>Conference,</hi> writing the ſum of what he and the ſaid Mr. <hi>Burton</hi>
ſpake, which to this time he hath kept ſecret, and it might be
he would have done ſtill, were it not that by the intreaty of
certain friends, and to give them and others ſome ſatisfaction,
concerning the high places of <hi>England,</hi> lately debated again
between the ſaid Mr. <hi>Chidley</hi> and Mr. <hi>John Goodwin,</hi> he hath
now divulged the ſame to publick view: together with that
other <hi>Conference</hi> of late, which was occaſioned by a Member
of our <hi>Congregation,</hi> whoſe wife was a Member of Mr. <hi>Goodwins</hi>
Church, and deſired to be ſatisfyed, whether her Husband or
ſhe was in the trueſt Church-ſtate.</p>
            <p>The firſt Queſtion was, whether Mr. <hi>Burton</hi> and his Church
were in the order of the Goſpel, that the <hi>Separation</hi> might
<pb n="2" facs="tcp:66521:4"/>
know certainly how to eſteem them, intitle them, and have fel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowſhip
with them; and whether they were ſo indeed, as they
profeſſed to be in word, and Mr. <hi>Burton</hi> anſwering affirma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tively:
it was in the next place demanded, how then did his
practiſe and theirs ſo much differ, both their profeſſions and
Covenants ſeeming to be alike, and therefore deſiring to have
his practice compared with his Covenant or profeſſion, or any
of them, with theirs of the <hi>Separation,</hi> which he abſolutely re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fuſed,
ſaying, he and his Church were a free and <hi>Independant</hi>
body or Corporation, and therefore not bound to make ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count
to any other Church or people in the world, although
never ſo famous, and one of his elders added, that the very (a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>valiers
or Malignants themſelves, gave them the Title of <hi>Sepa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ratiſts.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>But it being objected to Mr. <hi>Burton,</hi> that he was bound
both by precept and example of the immediat Apoſtles, to give
a reaſon of his faith, ſtop the mouthes of gain-ſayers, yea and
approve himſelf to thoſe that are without, far more to thoſe
that are within, even to be indeed as he profeſſeth himſelf and
the rather, in that he is a teacher and guide to others; as the
firſt Church of the Gentiles at <hi>Antiochia,</hi> thought it rather an
honour then any diſparagement, to aske reſolution of ſome
doubts at the Church of the <hi>Jewes,</hi> who were before them in
the faith and order of the Goſpel at <hi>Jeruſalem,</hi> though ſome
of the Apoſtles were preſent at both; and the rather, we hope
you wil do, ſaid Mr. <hi>Brown,</hi> becauſe we come to you in love, e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſteeming
more of you then hundreds of your breeding, (I mean
at the Univerſities) in regard both of your ſufferings and wri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tings,
far beyond what they have either acted or ſuffered, eſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cially
for that publick Sermon, you made in the Pillary-Pulpit
at <hi>Weſtminſter,</hi> three houres long, even reſiſting unto blood a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt
the evill of the times, unto which I was a witneſſe, and
is a motive of my coming to you at this time. He anſwered that
his profeſſion and practiſe were agreeable, and that he and his
people entered, according to the rules preſcribed in the Goſpel,
and ſo walked for ought he knew, as many can bear witneſs,
and we alſo may, if we wil come and hear him.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="3" facs="tcp:66521:4"/>
To the which or the like words, one of his Elders added
that <hi>John Baptiſt</hi> ſent two of his Diſciples to ask our Saviour,
whether he was the <hi>Meſſias,</hi> or if they ſhould look for ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther,
and our Saviour not anſwering them directly, bids them
tell their Maſter what they heard and ſaw, yea, and reckoneth
up divers excellent particulars, which he onely expreſſed with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out
either inference or application; ſo his meaning (to our ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prehenſion)
was, that if we were not pleaſed with what they
profeſſed or practiſed, concerning the worſhip of God, we
might rather come and ſee, and heare and obſerve, their works
of converſion, and manner of converſation, then to reaſon the
matter; but we deſiring firſt to conferre ſome few times, to ſee
if we could poſſibly agree in the truth, perceiving their un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>willingneſs,
by ſome harſh ſpeeches and carriages, did appre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hend
it would be to ſmall purpoſe.</p>
            <p>Upon the hearing of theſe or words to that purpoſe,
Mr. <hi>Burton</hi> ſaid, that he had renounced his Miniſtry and Or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders
which he had of the Church of <hi>England,</hi> and that he wit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſed
by his ſuffering, againſt the Miniſtry, conſtitution, wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhip,
Government, and high-places of that national Church,
and that there was no holineſs in thoſe places.</p>
            <p>And upon his juſtifying himſelf and his people in all things,
by our Saviours practiſe and his Apoſtles, it was demanded by
Mr. <hi>Brown;</hi> what meaneth then the blearing of thoſe ſheep, and
the lowing of them Oxen daily in our eares if you do, and o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bey
all things ſo well (as both <hi>Saul</hi> &amp; the Angell of <hi>Laodicea,</hi>
&amp; many others ſpake of themſelves) what meaneth then (I ſay)
both your preaching, and all your Members hearing in thoſe
Pariſh-Aſſemblies; is it not a halting between two opinions,
and that ye ſhew your ſelves, neither to be hot nor could in ſo
doing?</p>
            <p>He anſwered that our Saviour and his Apoſtles, reſorted to
the Synagogues of the Jewes, and why might not they go
as wel to the Pariſh-Aſſemblies?</p>
            <p>But ſaith Mr. <hi>Brown,</hi> you muſt neither compare the <hi>Jewiſh</hi>
Church with the <hi>Engliſh;</hi> nor yet the Synagogues of the one,
with the high places of the other; but rather the high places
<pb n="4" facs="tcp:66521:5"/>
of <hi>England,</hi> with thoſe in <hi>Judah,</hi> in that they have both an un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lawful
dedication and foundation; ſo it appeareth by your
practiſe, whatſoever by your words you profeſs, that you are
ſtill in <hi>Babel,</hi> abſolving the wicked (ſparing as it were the fatt)
by your preſence, and condemning the juſt in <hi>Sion,</hi> (whom ye
eſteem to be lean) by your abſence, though ye know obedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence
to be better then ſacrifice.</p>
            <p>He and another of his Elders anſwered, that neither did he
preach, nor they hear in every common Pariſh-Church, but
ſuch as they chuſed above others, neither did they hear in thoſe
high-places, as men were in diſcharge of their Miniſterial fun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction,
but onely in the exerciſe of their gifts, and not ſo much
for edification, as that they might get ſome matter of accu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſation
againſt them by hearing them, and thereof make ſome
profitable uſe, when they ſaw a convenient occaſion.</p>
            <p>Then it was demanded, how he and other <hi>Independents</hi> could
juſtifie their unequal yoking, with thoſe in the Pariſh-Aſſem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>blies,
whom they judge to be onely of the world, and not of
the Church, as themſelves profeſs to be; and though they par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>take
in the word &amp; prayer with them, in the publick high places,
yet they are not ſo thankful, as to admit thoſe of the Aſſemblies
to partake with them at their privat adminiſtring the ſeales, as if
that privat ſeparation at that time, or in that place, would al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
the national Church conſtitution of them and all the root
together in one.</p>
            <p>Whereas, they ſhould have no ſpiritual fellowſhip at
all, with the unfruitful works of darkneſs, but ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
reprove them, and witneſs againſt them, as both <hi>Iddo</hi> the
Prophet did at <hi>Bethel,</hi> and as the <hi>Jewes</hi> were commanded of
God, not to go to <hi>Bethaven, Beerſheba, Bethel,</hi> nor <hi>Gilgal,</hi> yea
and we find it recorded, as a But or Exception, even againſt
ſome of the Kings of <hi>Judah,</hi> for not aboliſhing thoſe high pla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces;
whereby not onely evil it ſelf, but all the appearances and
occaſions of evil might be removed; ſo that whatſoever place
hath an Idolatrous inſtitution or dedication, cannot by any
meanes be purged, but in altering the form thereof, by
utter demolition, and ſcarce applying the ſame to a civil uſe, or
to be a common habitation.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="5" facs="tcp:66521:5"/>
To which was anſwered, that thoſe places might ſtill be well
uſed by Gods people, though they have been abuſed by Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thens
and Papiſts.</p>
            <p>Whereupon occaſion was taken by Mr. <hi>Brown,</hi> (ſeeing them
ſo unwilling to confeſs the truth) to clear thoſe two points,
both of a Church-ſtate; and place of meeting, expecting a ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tisfactory
anſwer of them, at leaſt for the hearers ſake.</p>
            <p>He affirmed, that in regard the Temple of <hi>Jeruſalem,</hi> was
built according to Gods own direction, and therefore a holy
work, alwayes capable to be purged, and reduced to the firſt
principle of integrity, if ever it ſhould be abuſed by Idolatry;
as it was polluted, purged, and reduced divers times, according
as the Magiſtrates and people following their example, were
diſpoſed to good or evil, as upon divine record, in the books
of the <hi>Kings</hi> and <hi>Chronicles</hi> doth appear.</p>
            <p>So the Churches conſtituted by the immediat Apoſtles, ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording
to <hi>Chriſts</hi> inſtitution, conſiſting all of faithful people,
according to viſibility, (referring ſecret things to God) and
therefore, all proceeding from a true and holy original, when<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſoever
they ſhould be corrupted either by ſinful matter, or
corrupt practiſes, as in <hi>Corinth</hi> by that inceſtuous perſon, or in
<hi>Galatia</hi> by that falſe Doctrine, they were ſtill purgeable, and
were indeed purged. for otherwiſe a little leaven, would have
ſowred the whole lump.</p>
            <p>And according both to the Temple and Churches purifying,
<hi>Adam</hi> the firſt man, being created holy and unblameable, if he
ſhould fall, (as he did indeed) to ſin and Apoſtacie, he was (by
meanes of his original holineſs by creation) reſtored by the ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cond
<hi>Adam</hi> Chriſt, to his former integrity.</p>
            <p>But neither material Temples, built by the man of ſin and
child of pardition, nor by the Heathens, and dedicated to Ido<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>latry,
and intitled by the name of Saints departed, although o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>therwiſe
uſed to the worſhip of God, as the <hi>Jewes</hi> did ſacrifice
ſtill in the high-places of <hi>Judah,</hi> after King <hi>Manaſſes</hi> conver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion
and reformation, 2 <hi>Chron.</hi> 33. 17. nor yet aſſemblies ga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thered
or conſtituted by humane invention, contrary to the
patern of the Churches mentioned in the Goſpel, can be redu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ced
<pb n="6" facs="tcp:66521:6"/>
to any purity or integrity, becauſe they never had any, but
muſt needes ſtill continue in Apoſtaſie and Idolatry, (as they
were made thereof at the firſt, until there be a viſitation or diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolution)
as we have woful experience, even yet in theſe dayes:
which were pretended to be dayes of reformation, and might
be yet ſo indeed, if it ſhould pleaſe God to honour thoſe whom
he hath ſet in Authority, with ſo excellent, worthy, and glori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous
a work, beyond all other works; as he did that worthy
young King <hi>Joſiah.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>To thoſe grounds thus, or to this effect layed, Mr.
<hi>Burton</hi> and his congregation, in ſtead of anſwering, op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſing,
applying, or any wiſe clearing themſelves, (in a harſh
and angry manner) propounded three queſtions to the <hi>Sepa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ratiſts.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Firſt, who built the Synagogues of the <hi>Jewes?</hi> To which he an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwered,
In that the Scripture is ſilent, who built the Synagogues
(except only a Centurion, who loved the <hi>Iewiſh</hi> Nation built
one) it doth not become any man to demand the queſtion; nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
is it neceſſary to edification or ſalvatio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>; but we neither read
nor hear of any dedication of them to Idolatry, which the
<hi>Scottiſh</hi> Covenant abjureth, as wel as they do the <hi>Romiſh</hi> Hie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rarchy,
worldly monarchy, blaſphemous liturgy, canonizing
of Saints, and baptizing of bells; And it ſufficeth us, that the
Synagogues were lawful meeting places, for the more frequent
and convenient practice of the <hi>Jewiſh</hi> Religion, except what
was appropriated to the Temple, at certain times of the year,
or elſe neither our Saviour nor his Apoſtles would have coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tenanced
thoſe places with their preſence; nor <hi>King David</hi> in
the <hi>Pſalmes</hi> complained of the deſolation thereof.</p>
            <p>His ſecond Queſtion was, Might no meeting-houſes be built,
to the Churches of the Saints now under the Goſpel? To
which the <hi>Separatiſts</hi> anſwered, that there both have been,
and ſtill are many lawful meeting-places, built by lawful Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thority
for the Churches of the Saints under the Goſpel, for
keeping them both from the injury of weather, and for their
more quiet and peaceable practicing of the Ordinances, being
ſheltered and hidden, both from the open and ſecret enemies of
<pb n="7" facs="tcp:66521:6"/>
God and his truth, beſides the dwelling, houſes of Members
and wel-willers, and wherein alſo are Churches, both habiting
and converſing, and all without either dedication, conſecration,
or any kind of ſuperſtition.</p>
            <p>And his third queſtion was, Whether were thoſe which we
call high-places, and he ſtill comparing to the <hi>Synagogues,</hi> conſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crated
before, in, or after they were built? The Separatiſts an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwered,
that Mr. <hi>Burton</hi> himſelf knew better, who built and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dicated
thoſe ſhops of <hi>Antichriſt</hi> (wherein he hath lived all
his dayes) then the <hi>Separatiſts,</hi> who were meer ſtrangers to
ſuch things, and unto which, both he and his Congregation do
ſtill bring all their Tithes, Sacrifices, Gifts, and Oblations; but
for the hearers ſake, the <hi>Separatiſts</hi> ſaid, (according as they un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtood)
that the full dedication of the houſe, (whatſoever
be of the ground) muſt be at the accompliſhing: but in regard
both of intention, earneſt, and beginning of action, are com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pleated
at the firſt ſtone laying, as the <hi>Biſhops</hi> uſually laid
the firſt ſtone, and made the bleſſed (or rather curſed) begin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning,
and ſo they and the workmen proceeding and ending e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>qually,
the one with the other, by Maſſes, mattens, letanies, or
ſuch like abominations, whereby the <hi>Popiſh</hi> Clergy (ſtil ſtrength<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned
with civil Authority) do practice their devotions in all
their conſecrations.</p>
            <p>And in end, after Mr. <hi>Burton</hi> did withdraw to refreſh him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf,
he being in exerciſe with his congregation before this ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pointed
diſputation, amongſt ſome other ſpeeches had with
the Elders and other Members of his Church in his abſence,
they alleadged, that if we ſhould look ſo narrowly and preciſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly,
to <hi>Antichriſtian</hi> or Heatheniſh dedication of places, why
do we offer any ſervice or ſacrifice to God at all, either in
<hi>England, Scotland, France</hi> or <hi>Ireland;</hi> for they were all four
dedicated to Saints departed, ſuch as <hi>St. George, St. Andrew,
St. Denis,</hi> and <hi>St. Patrick?</hi>
            </p>
            <p>It was anſwered, that thoſe Nations and all others, were
created and built by the great <hi>CREATOR,</hi> builder, and maker of
all things, and ordained for his people to live in, yea even the
wicked as well as the godly, all having equal right by the bene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fit
<pb n="8" facs="tcp:66521:7"/>
of Creation, even the tares as wel as the wheat in the field
of the world, until the Haveſt of the great day; but he never
ordained any Idolatrous places which are built and dedicated
by man, (or by that man of ſin, and child of perdition) to be
worſhipped in, but hath deſtinated ſuch works, yea and (work<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers
alſo (except repentance intervene,) to deſtruction, and ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>counteth
all kind of Sacrifices, upon whatſoever pretence
there offered, to be like King <hi>Jeroboams</hi> practiſe at <hi>Dan</hi> and
<hi>Bethel,</hi> (who made <hi>Iſrael</hi> to ſin) even abominations of de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolation.</p>

Upon the 22. of <hi>Auguſt,</hi> 1648. the meeting was appointed
to be, unto which divers perſons came, at which Mr. <hi>Chidley</hi>
would have inſiſted upon the matter and forme, &amp;c.</p>
            <p>And firſt upon the <hi>matter,</hi> but Mr. <hi>Goodwin</hi> would not debate
that, nor other things there deſired to be handled, but ſaid, he
would go a readier way to work, and make an end of the buſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe
without that; for ſaith he, ſuppoſe it be granted, that all
our matter be ſo corrupt, as you preſuppoſe it is, yet it is law<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full
for your Members to communicate with ours; for ſaith he,
it is lawfull for a man to communicate with one whom he
doubts whether he be a <hi>Believer</hi> or not, but this was denied
by Mr. <hi>Chidley,</hi> from two conſiderations.</p>
            <p>Firſt, That whatſoever is doubtfull is not to be practiſed,
though it be a thing indifferent, <hi>becauſe it is not of faith,</hi> and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
a <hi>ſin,</hi> becauſe <hi>whatſoever is not of faith is ſin.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Secondly, much more is he to forbeare that which is con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary
to the <hi>word</hi> of God, as to <hi>communicate</hi> with one of whom
we have not good teſtimony of his life and converſation, and
that the work of grace is wrought upon him, that he is effectu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally
called, and ſeparated from Idolatry, and cleaveth unto the
<hi>Way of Chriſt</hi> in purity. Now ſaid he, we know you not, yee are
ſtrangers to us.</p>
            <p>We are not come to accuſe, but to hear your manifeſtation
for our ſatisfaction, that yee are fit matter for the <hi>Church of
Chriſt,</hi> and we hope we ſhall not break <hi>Communion</hi> for every
circumſtance of difference amongſt us, if it do not make againſt
the aboſolute being of a <hi>Saint.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Then Mr. <hi>Goodwin</hi> ſaid, I grant that a man is not to practiſe
a thing if he be doubtfull of it, but howſoever, he that is doubt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full
is to give good reaſon of his doubt.</p>
            <p>Then the Gentleman that doubted, was called upon to give
his Reaſons, why he could not communicate with his wife, who
told them that the Lord had ſhewed him the evill of the
Church of <hi>England,</hi> and that he was joyned to a ſeparated
Congregation, and thought that he ſhould not be fit matter
for the <hi>Church</hi> to communicate with, if he ſhould hold Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>munion
with the Members of Mr. <hi>Goodwins Church, becauſe</hi>
Mr. <hi>Goodwins</hi> Peoples practice was to preach and heare in the
<pb n="11" facs="tcp:66521:8"/>
               <hi>Parriſh-Churches</hi> of <hi>England,</hi> and to <hi>Worſhip</hi> in the <hi>Idolls Temples,</hi>
and to <hi>Baptize the Children</hi> of <hi>unbelievers,</hi> and ſuch like.</p>
            <p>Then after ſome further diſcourſe, they ſhewed themſelves
to be willing to debate the buſineſſe concerning the <hi>high places;</hi>
whereupon the queſtion was ſtated.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Whether it were lawfull to worſhip in the Idolls Temples?</hi> The
ſum of the Conference briefly followeth.<note place="margin">Mr. John Goodwin.</note> The <hi>Apoſtle</hi> to <hi>Timo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thy,
(Tim. 2. 8.)</hi> ſaith, <hi>I will therefore that men pray every where,
lifting up holy hands, without wrath and doubting.</hi> And thereupon
Mr. <hi>Goodwin</hi> argued, that Gods word had made no reſtriction,
and therefore that we are not to reſtraine it, and that therefore
this word: <hi>(every where)</hi> in this place is to be taken for all man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner
of places without exception.</p>
            <p>To which Mr. <hi>Chidley</hi> anſwered, that God himſelf had made
reſtrictions, ſhewing that we are not to worſhip him in Idolls
Temples, for he hath commanded them to be quite <hi>pull'd down,
Numb.</hi>
33. 52. and that command is not taken away, but re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maineth
in full force to this day; This word <hi>every</hi> in this place
is to be reſtrained, as in other places, where its ſaid, <hi>Children o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bey
your Parents in all things, Col. 3. 20. Servants obey your Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſters
in all things; and every Creature of God is good, and all things
are lawfull:</hi> In all which we are to know, how farre ſuch words
are reſtrained, and how farre not; it extendeth, and is to be re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrained
to <hi>lawfull things,</hi> and ſo this place where he ſaith, <hi>pray
every where,</hi> that is, <hi>in every place which is not prohibited by Gods
Law,</hi> but its prohibited by <hi>Gods Law</hi> for the Saints to worſhip
in <hi>Idols Temples,</hi> for he hath commanded, they ſhould be quite
pluckt down, ſaying <hi>ye ſhall quite pluck down all their high places,
Numb.</hi> 33. 52. becauſe they are polluted with diabolicall un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cleanneſſe,
now this Command was never abrogated, as I ſaid
before: But Mr. <hi>Goodwin</hi> ſaid there is no <hi>Guilt of ſin</hi> upon the
<hi>high places,</hi> neither is there any <hi>ſin imputed</hi> to them, but its a ſin
to hold reſtriction of places for <hi>Gods worſhip</hi>
            </p>
            <p>To which Mr. <hi>Chidley</hi> anſwered, That God accounts them
<hi>diabolically uncleane,</hi> and calleth them by the name of <hi>ſin it ſelfe.</hi>
as he calleth <hi>the high places of Aven, the ſin of Iſrael, Hoſea</hi> 10. 8.
And if it be a ſin to hold reſtriction of places for the worſhip of
<pb n="12" facs="tcp:66521:9"/>
God, then it is a ſin to uphold that reſtriction, by worſhipping
God in thoſe places that are ſo reſtrained.</p>
            <p>Its you that uphold diſtinction of places ſaid Mr. <hi>Goodwin,</hi>
not we who meet in them; we hold all places alike.</p>
            <p>Mr. <hi>Chidley</hi> anſwered again, we uphold not the diſtinction
of places, but its you by your <hi>worſhipping,</hi> and pleading for thoſe
places that are reſtrained by men.</p>
            <p>Saith Mr. <hi>Goodwin,</hi> even now you would maintain diſtinction
of <hi>places,</hi> and now you ſay, you uphold no diſtinction of places.
Mr. <hi>Chidley</hi> ſaid, its true in a ſenſe, we uphold them not at all;
but when they have ſet up Idolls Temples, we do hold that thoſe
places are made diabolicall by them, becauſe wicked men have
dedicated them to their <hi>Idols:</hi> no more doth God himſelf in
the firſt place make ſuch diſtinctions of places as they make, but
when once they have put <hi>a diabolicall uncleanneſſe</hi> upon the
ſame, <hi>God</hi> declares then that they are <hi>uncleane,</hi> and calleth them
<hi>ſin,</hi> and commandeth them to be <hi>pulled down,</hi> and ſo we diſtin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guiſh
not in the firſt place, but they make the places to be di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtinct
<hi>diabolically</hi> by their <hi>dedication</hi> of thoſe places to <hi>Idols,</hi> and
ſo the diſtinction is <hi>theirs,</hi> not <hi>ours. God</hi> himſelf <hi>made all things
good at the firſt,</hi> and made no <hi>Devill,</hi> but made <hi>Angels,</hi> and they
made themſelves <hi>Devills, ſo he made all things good, and made no
Temple of Idolls, or Temple of Devills,</hi> ſo concerning men he pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſſeth,
<hi>that he deſireth not the death of a ſixner, and why will ye
die O Houſe of Iſrael?</hi> to ſhew them that <hi>their damnation is of
themſelves,</hi> and yet elſewhere he ſheweth in reſpect of the <hi>evill
of puniſhment, there is no evill in the City but he doth it;</hi> but they
bring it upon themſelves in the firſt place. Therefore when they
have made <hi>Idols,</hi> or <hi>Idols Temples,</hi> God owneth them not, but
in his juſt judgement <hi>puniſheth</hi> them, and commands them to be
demoliſhed; and we would have them to be deſtroyed, accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding
to <hi>Gods Commands,</hi> and the <hi>example of King Joſiah, 2. Chron.</hi>
34. and other <hi>holymen of God,</hi> and therefore we are farre from up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>holding
them: yet hold them the <hi>Temples of Devills,</hi> till they
are pulled down. Its impoſſible ſaid Mr. <hi>Goodwin,</hi> to prove that
all the <hi>Temples</hi> in the Land are dedicated to <hi>Idolls;</hi> but what if
they were, is it unlawfull to worſhip in them therefore?</p>
            <p>2. <hi>Theſe Steeple-houſes</hi> here, were not <hi>dedicated to Devills,</hi>
               <pb n="13" facs="tcp:66521:9"/>
but ſome to <hi>Chriſt,</hi> others of them are <hi>dedicated to God,</hi> himſelf,
even to the <hi>Trinity,</hi> and moſt of them are <hi>dedicated to Saints,</hi> &amp;c.</p>
            <p>3. Chriſt came into the World to take away the diſtinction
between <hi>places</hi> and <hi>places,</hi> and to make <hi>all places alike;</hi> and to
deny this, tendeth to deny that <hi>Chriſt Jeſus</hi> is come into the
world, and to eſtabliſh <hi>Jewiſhme.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>4. When he came into the <hi>world,</hi> he diſſolved the <hi>uncleannes</hi>
which God had made and put upon the <hi>Creatures,</hi> how much
more then the <hi>uncleanneſſe</hi> which men had put on thoſe places
of theirs built of <hi>ſtone.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>5. By the ſame grounds we may refuſe to worſhip <hi>God</hi> in any
part of the land: ſuppoſe this whole <hi>Kingdom</hi> be dedicated to St.
<hi>George,</hi> as <hi>France</hi> to St. <hi>Dennis,</hi> &amp; all the <hi>houſes</hi> dedicated all over
the <hi>Kingdom,</hi> as once its ſaid to be <hi>wholly dedicated to St. George;</hi>
muſt we not worſhip <hi>God</hi> in the <hi>Kingdom,</hi> becauſe of that.</p>
            <p>6. In <hi>John</hi> the 4. its clear that <hi>Jeſus Chriſt</hi> ſpeaking to the
woman of <hi>Samaria,</hi> ſheweth that <hi>all places are now alike,</hi> and as
there is no place unto which the <hi>worſhip</hi> of God is bound, ſo
there is no place, though an <hi>Idolls Temple,</hi> but that men may
lawfully worſhip and ſerve God in; for when the woman
queſtioned, <hi>ſaying v. 20. Our Fathers worſhipped in this Moun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain,
and ye ſay that in Jeruſalem is the place where men ought to
worſhip. 21. Jeſus ſaid unto the woman, believe me the houre com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth,
when ye ſhall neither in this Mountain, nor yet at</hi> Jeruſalem
<hi>Worſhip the Father.</hi> As if he ſhould ſay, the houre is coming, that
all places ſhall be left free for to worſhip in, both <hi>this mountain,</hi>
and <hi>all others,</hi> not one place above another, but all alike, no
place more <hi>holy,</hi> no place more <hi>unholy,</hi> though in the <hi>Mountain</hi>
of <hi>Samaria, where was an Idolls Temple,</hi> and ſo takes away the
diſtinction of <hi>places,</hi> which was under the <hi>Law. And the reaſon
why the Idolls Temples were prohibited under the Law, was becauſe
God had branded them then.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>7. Upon the ſame ground that we muſt not worſhip in <hi>theſe pla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces,</hi>
becauſe dedicated by <hi>Idolaters,</hi> it is not lawful for men to wor<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ſhip
in their <hi>houſes,</hi> becauſe <hi>Idolatry</hi> hath been committed theer.</p>
            <p>Unto all which Mr. <hi>Chidley</hi> made anſwer as followeth.</p>
            <p>1. It is not impoſſible to prove theſe <hi>Temples</hi> in the <hi>Land</hi>
which the <hi>Idolators</hi> frequent to be <hi>dedicated</hi> to <hi>Idolls.</hi> And the
<pb n="14" facs="tcp:66521:10"/>
way to try them is as a <hi>Thief</hi> or <hi>Murderer</hi> is <hi>tryed</hi> when he is
<hi>arraigned</hi> before the <hi>Judge,</hi> if he <hi>confeſſe</hi> it with his own mouth,
<hi>he is out of his own mouth condemned;</hi> even ſo, if the founders of
theſe places, have confeſſed out of their own mouthes, that
they have dedicated them to ſuch uſes, as the Records of the
Realm teſtifie, the ſaid places are condemned, and ought to be
executed, but for theſe things, I referre unto the records of the
<hi>Realme,</hi> and unto thoſe plain and manifeſt proofes openly
known formerly.</p>
            <p>2. Whereas its alledged that they were not <hi>dedicated</hi> unto
<hi>Devills,</hi> I ſay <hi>Temples dedicated</hi> to <hi>Idolls,</hi> are <hi>dedicated</hi> to <hi>Devils,</hi>
and ſo the <hi>Apoſtle Paul</hi> ſpeaketh of the <hi>Idolls Sacrifices,</hi> when
he ſaith to the <hi>Corinthians, 1 Cor.</hi> 10. 20. That the things which
the <hi>Gentiles ſacrifice, they ſacrifice to Devills,</hi> and not to <hi>God,</hi>
and <hi>I would not that they ſhould have fellowſhip with Devills;</hi> The
Scripture calleth <hi>Idolls</hi> by the name of <hi>Devills,</hi> ſo the two
calves which <hi>Jeroboam</hi> ſet up at <hi>Dan</hi> and <hi>Bethel</hi> were called
<hi>Devills,</hi> for in ſetting up and worſhipping <hi>Idolls,</hi> men ſet up and
worſhip <hi>Devills:</hi> therefore the <hi>Temples</hi> of <hi>Idolls</hi> are the <hi>Temples</hi>
of <hi>Devills,</hi> (and not the <hi>Temples</hi> of <hi>God)</hi> no more are theſe.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>And whereas it is ſaid ſome are</hi> dedicated <hi>to</hi> Chriſt, <hi>what is</hi>
their Chriſt? their Chriſt <hi>is not he that</hi> ſtandeth at the right
hand of God, <hi>but it is</hi> a peece of bread, <hi>which they fall down and</hi>
worſhip, <hi>calling it</hi> their God, <hi>and eat it when they have done,</hi>
O ridiculous horrible impiety, worſe then Jeroboams! <hi>and they do
not ſay,</hi> its a figure of the body of Chriſt, <hi>and</hi> the wine a figure of
the blood of Chriſt, <hi>but (ſay they) it is</hi> really <hi>the</hi> Body <hi>and</hi> Blood
<hi>of</hi> Chriſt, <hi>and to</hi> this Chriſt <hi>do they</hi> dedicate <hi>their</hi> Temples <hi>which
they call</hi> Chriſts Chruch.</p>
            <p>And ſo their <hi>Trinity</hi> is not the <hi>eternall God,</hi> the <hi>Father, Son,</hi>
and <hi>Holy Spirit,</hi> but their <hi>Trinity</hi> which they <hi>worſhip</hi> is the
picture <hi>(painted upon a wall)</hi> of an <hi>old man (ſitting)</hi> in (that
which they <hi>picture)</hi> for <hi>heaven,</hi> and there is the <hi>Picture</hi> of what
they call the <hi>Son:</hi> and the <hi>Holy Ghoſt,</hi> they have alſo <hi>(painted</hi>
out) in the <hi>likeneſſe</hi> of a <hi>Dove; this is their Trinity</hi> which they
<hi>fall</hi> down and <hi>worſhip,</hi> and <hi>dedicate their Temples unto</hi> And admit
that moſt of them were dedicated to <hi>Saints</hi> and <hi>Angels,</hi> it is to
be conſidered, whether it be not <hi>Idolatry</hi> to <hi>dedicate</hi> any <hi>Places</hi>
               <pb n="15" facs="tcp:66521:10"/>
to <hi>Saints</hi> or <hi>Angels;</hi> but what are your <hi>Saints</hi> or <hi>Angels</hi> which
they <hi>dedicate</hi> their <hi>Temples</hi> unto new <hi>Images</hi> which they make
of them, that are no more like unto them, then my <hi>Pictur</hi> is
like Mr. <hi>Goodwins,</hi> and they fall down before theſe <hi>Images,</hi> ſay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing,
<hi>St. Peter ſave me, St. Paul ſave me,</hi> &amp;c. Theſe their im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pieties
far exceed the <hi>Abominations</hi> of the <hi>Heathens,</hi> and ſo are
their <hi>Idols Temples abominable places,</hi> and ought not to be <hi>wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhipped
in,</hi> of the <hi>Saints.</hi> Beſides <hi>divers Temples</hi> in <hi>England</hi> are
<hi>builded</hi> and <hi>dedicated</hi> to the <hi>Heathen Gods,</hi> as well as theſe are
to the <hi>Chriſtian</hi> or rather <hi>Antichriſtian Gods.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Then Mr. <hi>Goodwin</hi> began to commend what he had read of
the <hi>Papiſts</hi> works, concerning the <hi>nature</hi> and <hi>eſſence</hi> of <hi>God,</hi> ſay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing,
We ſhould not belie the <hi>Devill.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Mr. <hi>Chidley</hi> anſwered, do you think that <hi>Jeroboam</hi> and <hi>Jeſus</hi>
was not acquainted with ſuch things? but the <hi>Papiſts</hi> impiety
far exceedeth his, <hi>he made Calves</hi> in imitation of thoſe at <hi>Jeru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſalem.</hi>
Theſe make a <hi>breaden God,</hi> and eat it when they have
done, beſides their other <hi>Abominations,</hi> by which <hi>they provoke the
Lord to anger.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Therefore friends,<note place="margin">Mr. Chidley applying his Speech to the People pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent.</note> I deſire as you tender the <hi>ſalvation</hi> of your
<hi>ſoules,</hi> to <hi>labour</hi> to <hi>know that iniquity is in a myſtery,</hi> and to
diſcover the ſame; and alſo learn to <hi>know the myſtery of godlineſs,</hi>
and how <hi>it differs from the myſtery of iniquity,</hi> though in ſome
ſort the <hi>myſtery</hi> of <hi>iniquity</hi> reſembleth it, which maketh it the
harder to be diſcerned, which cauſeth ſo many <hi>ſoules</hi> to be blind<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
to their condemnation; for God is not their God, but theſe
are, <hi>theſe are their Gods,</hi> let them pretend what ever they will,
they <hi>worſhip theſe Images.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>3. Where its ſaid that Chriſt came into the world to take a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>way
the <hi>diſtinction</hi> of <hi>places</hi> and <hi>places,</hi> and to make <hi>all places a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>like,</hi>
and that to deny this, tendeth to deny that <hi>Jeſus Chriſt</hi> is
come into the <hi>World,</hi> and to <hi>eſtabliſh Jewiſhme.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>I anſwer, That <hi>Chriſt came not into the world to take away the
diabolicall uncleanneſs of Idols Temples:</hi> no more then of <hi>Idols</hi>
themſelves: to affirm that he did, tendeth not onely to deny
<hi>Chriſt,</hi> but alſo to acknowledge <hi>Antichriſt,</hi> and to <hi>eſtabliſh Ido<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>latry.</hi>
But he hath ſaid, <hi>Little Children, keep your ſelves from
Idolls.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <pb n="16" facs="tcp:66521:11"/>
4. Whereas it is ſaid, that when he came he <hi>diſſolved</hi> the <hi>un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cleanneſs</hi>
which <hi>God</hi> had made, and put upon the <hi>Creatures;</hi> how
much more then the <hi>uncleanneſs</hi> which men had put upon thoſe
<hi>places,</hi> but of <hi>lime</hi> and <hi>ſtone?</hi> Mr. <hi>Chidley</hi> anſwered, that it fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>loweth
not: That becauſe <hi>Chriſt did take away the ceremonial
uncleanneſs which was put upon the Creatures by God,</hi> that there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
he took away the <hi>diabolicall uncleanneſs</hi> which was put up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
the <hi>Creatures</hi> by <hi>men,</hi> unleſs to <hi>demoliſh,</hi> and <hi>aboliſh</hi> them.
As at his coming its ſaid, <hi>the Idols he will utterly aboliſh;</hi> Its a
<hi>maxim</hi> in <hi>divinity,</hi> amongſt the <hi>Separation,</hi> that <hi>Chriſt dyed not
for Temples made of lime and ſtone,</hi> but for <hi>his Church,</hi> which con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiſteth of <hi>living ſtones,</hi> he died not then for <hi>Idols Temples,</hi> no
more then for <hi>Idols:</hi> and though I am <hi>verily perſwaded, that
nothing is unclean of it ſelf,</hi> ſo it was in the time of the <hi>Law,</hi> but
<hi>inſtitution</hi> cauſed the <hi>difference,</hi> and it is conſiderable, that in the
time of the <hi>Law</hi> the <hi>Badgers</hi>
               <note n="†" place="margin">The Ori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginall hath it <hi>Tachas</hi> Skins, whe<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ther there be a defect in the common <hi>Tranſlation,</hi> its queſtiona<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble, and it ſeemeth ſom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>what doubt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full. But that <hi>Idols Temples</hi> are hated by <hi>God</hi> is out of doubt.</note> 
               <hi>Skinnes</hi> were made uſe of to co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver
the <hi>Lord Sanctuary,</hi> but when did the Lord ever take that
which belonged to any <hi>Idol,</hi> or <hi>Idols Temple,</hi> to <hi>cover his San<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctuary?</hi>
never; it argueth therefore, that there is a great deal of
difference between thoſe Creatures, that were ceremonially un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clean,
and thoſe diabolically unclean, and <hi>Chriſt</hi> might well take
away the <hi>uncleannes</hi> of the one, but not of the other; we are bid<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>den
in the Goſpel, to <hi>keep our ſelves from Idols,</hi> and <hi>from the pol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lutions
of Idols:</hi> Therefore <hi>Jeſus Christ hath not cleanſed them,
though he hath made the ceremonial things common.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>5. Whereas it was ſaid, by the ſame ground, as we refuſe
to worſhip <hi>God</hi> in theſe <hi>dedicated places;</hi> we may refuſe to
<hi>Worſhip God</hi> in any place of the Land.</p>
            <p>Mr. <hi>Chidley</hi> anſwered, that it followeth not; for though
ſome be <hi>Idols Temples,</hi> yet all the houſe are not.</p>
            <p>I know ſaid he, that as the <hi>Heathen Nations</hi> had their <hi>great
Gods</hi> beſides their <hi>petty Gods,</hi> ſo <hi>theſe Nations</hi> beſides there <hi>petty
abominable Idols,</hi> they have <hi>for every Nation a God;</hi> as St. <hi>George
for England,</hi> St. <hi>Patricke for Ireland,</hi> St. <hi>Denis for France,</hi> St.
<hi>David for wales;</hi> and to that <hi>God</hi> St. <hi>George</hi> are <hi>Temples dedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cated,</hi>
which are called <hi>Saint Georges Churches:</hi> theſe are there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
<hi>Idoles Temples,</hi> and ought not to be worſhipped in, it can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not
be proved ſo of <hi>all the houſes</hi> in the <hi>Land;</hi> but if any man wil
<pb n="17" facs="tcp:66521:11"/>
prove his houſe to be an <hi>Idols Temple</hi> when the <hi>Parl.</hi> ſets forth
an edict that all the <hi>Idols Temples</hi> in the <hi>Land</hi> ſhall be thrown
down, thoſe ſhall be demoliſhed as well as the other. As <hi>King
Hen:</hi> the <hi>8th.</hi> did demoliſh divers of the Monaſteries.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>King Henry</hi> 8th. did ſomwhat like to <hi>Jehu. Jehu</hi> though he
deſtroyed the <hi>Houſe</hi> of <hi>Baal,</hi> yet the <hi>Idols Temples</hi> of <hi>Jereboam</hi>
he deſtroyed not: ſo <hi>King Henry</hi> the 8th. deſtroyed divers of the
<hi>great high places,</hi> but the <hi>leſſer high places</hi> he did not demoliſh;
though they were all one in reſpect of <hi>pollution;</hi> ſave that which
hath moſt deceit in it, is moſt to be hated.</p>
            <p>And as for the Land it ſelfe, if it be poſſible to <hi>Dedicate</hi> the
whole earth to St. <hi>George,</hi> then its poſſible to dedicate the <hi>whole
world</hi> to an <hi>Idoll:</hi> but it is not in their power to <hi>dedicate</hi> it no
more then to dedicate the <hi>Sun and Moon and Starrs</hi> &amp;c. Now
the <hi>Sun</hi> and <hi>Moone</hi> and <hi>Starrs</hi> have been worſhipped as Gods,
yet were not to be demoliſhed; becauſe they were not their <hi>only
propriety,</hi> all men have their <hi>propriety in them;</hi> and therefore
though <hi>God</hi> commanded the <hi>Idols Temples,</hi> built upon <hi>Moun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taines</hi>
and <hi>Hills</hi> to be demoliſhed, yet he did not require the
<hi>Mountaines</hi> and <hi>Hills</hi> to be pulled down, they were of <hi>Gods</hi>
making, as the earth: the <hi>Idols Temples</hi> were of mens <hi>framing</hi>
and <hi>erecting,</hi> And in this <hi>diſtinction</hi> about <hi>propriety</hi> the <hi>Parlia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment</hi>
bears more out in their declaration, where they reaſon con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerning
the <hi>Propriety</hi> of the <hi>King</hi> &amp; of the people. Moreover <hi>Lands</hi>
are the <hi>Propriety</hi> of <hi>Poſterity</hi> even of the <hi>after-Generations</hi>
which cannot <hi>properly be given to Idols</hi> as <hi>Temples</hi> that are of
their making, no more then the <hi>Sun</hi> and <hi>Moone,</hi> which were
worſhipped, and <hi>are common to all;</hi> for <hi>God cauſeth the Sun to
ſhine upon the evill and upon the good, and upon the juſt and unjuſt.</hi>
And concerning <hi>houſes, The Lord</hi> did command in <hi>Iſrael,</hi> that
the <hi>high places ſhould be pull'd down,</hi> when he allowed the <hi>dwel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling
houſes to ſtand,</hi> except ſome houſe, <hi>upon whoſe roofes they
burned incenſe to other Gods.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>6. Concerning <hi>Chriſts</hi> ſpeeches to the <hi>woman</hi> of <hi>Samaria,</hi> no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing
can be gathered thence for <hi>Idols Temples,</hi> true it is that it
ſheweth that a time ſhould come, when the people ſhould not
be limitted to this place or to that, and this makes againſt thoſe
who limit men to places, and alſo againſt thoſe that uphold ſuch
<hi>limitted places,</hi> by worſhipping in them. But that <hi>Chriſt</hi> allow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth
<pb n="18" facs="tcp:66521:12"/>
men to worſhip in <hi>Idols Temples,</hi> and declareth them to be
no more polluted, then any other place (which you affirm) can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not
be gathered, neither by the expreſs words of <hi>Chriſt,</hi> nor ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſary
conſequence; for the matter in queſtion between <hi>Chriſt</hi>
and the <hi>woman</hi> was, which was the place of <hi>worſhip,</hi> not about
the <hi>places</hi> of <hi>worſhip,</hi> but the place of worſhip, whether it was
at that <hi>Mountain,</hi> or at <hi>Jeruſalem. Our Fathers</hi> (ſaith he) <hi>wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhipped
in this Mountain, and ye ſay that in Jeruſalem is the place
of worſhip.</hi> He doth not ſay [a] place, but [the] place, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by
it appeareth that her queſtion was about [the] place, where
men ought to worſhip; whether it was at that Mountain, or at
<hi>Jeruſalem,</hi> for then God bound his publick worſhip to one
place.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Now Jeſus ſaid unto her,</hi> Woman, believe me the houre cometh
when ye ſhall neither in this Mountain, nor yet at Jeruſalem wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhip
the Father. <hi>Now</hi> Chriſt <hi>by this ſpeech doth not allow them
to worſhip in</hi> Idols Temples <hi>though in a ſence, all places are free
to do it, all places of</hi> Gods Creation; <hi>but places of mens</hi> limitation,
erection, <hi>and</hi> dedication <hi>to</hi> Idols, <hi>ought to be pulled down; and
this by way of application, may appeare in the 22. and 23. ver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes
of the ſame Chapter, where Chriſt dealeth plainly with her
ſaying,</hi> Ye worſhip ye know not what, we know what we worſhip, for
ſalvation is of <hi>Jewes:</hi> but the houre cometh and now is, when the
true worſhippers ſhall worſhip the Father in ſpirit and in truth; for
the Father ſeeketh ſuch to worſhip him: <hi>As if he ſhould ſay, think
not that though the</hi> time <hi>be, that</hi> the true worſhippers ſhall not be
limitted to worſhip in a place, <hi>that therefore this is any juſtificati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
of you</hi> Samaritans <hi>who worſhip in</hi> Idols Temples, <hi>and</hi> wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhip
Idols. Ye worſhip you know not what: we know <hi>(ſaith he)</hi> what
we worſhip, <hi>and alleageth this reaſon,</hi> for ſalvation is of the <hi>Jewes;
intimating, that</hi> ſalvation <hi>was not of the</hi> Samaritans, who wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhipped
Idols, <hi>and in</hi> Idols Temples; <hi>ſo that if they would have</hi>
ſalvation, <hi>they muſt turn from ſuch</hi> vanities: <hi>Therefore he
would have them to</hi> worſhip the Father in ſpirit and truth. <hi>Now
the</hi> ſpirit <hi>and</hi> truth <hi>are diſtinct, though all one in</hi> purity. <hi>The</hi>
ſpirit <hi>is the</hi> ſpirit <hi>of</hi> God, <hi>and the</hi> truth <hi>is the</hi> word <hi>of</hi> God, <hi>as it is
written,</hi> Thy word is truth, <hi>now the</hi> word of truth <hi>doth ſpeak a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt</hi> Idols Temples, <hi>and therefore, we are not to worſhip</hi> God
<hi>in</hi> Idols Temples, but in ſpirit and truth: <hi>The</hi> ſpirit of God is a pure
<pb n="19" facs="tcp:66521:12"/>
ſpirit, <hi>but</hi> Idols <hi>and</hi> Idols Temples, <hi>are</hi> unclean <hi>and</hi> diabolicall, <hi>and
contrary to the nature of the</hi> ſpirit, the Father ſeeketh ſuch to
worſhip him, that worſhip him in ſpirit and truth: <hi>and therefore if
you would be found of him, worſhip not in</hi> Idols Temples, <hi>but
in</hi> ſpirit and truth. <hi>And by all this</hi> Scripture, <hi>here is not the leaſt
colour for; but rather againſt</hi> Idols Temples. Chriſt never ſhed
his blood to uphold and purge Idols Temples, from their diabolicall
uncleanneſſe, <hi>which</hi> uncleanneſs proceeded not from any inſtitution
of God, <hi>but from the</hi> Devill.</p>
            <p>And whereas it is ſaid, that the reaſon why <hi>Idols Temples</hi>
were prohibited under the <hi>Law,</hi> was <hi>becauſe God had branded
them then.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Mr. <hi>Chidley</hi> anſwered, That they made them <hi>Idols Temples,</hi>
God <hi>branded them,</hi> and to this day, that <hi>brand</hi> is not taken off
them, but remaineth ſtill upon them: The blood of <hi>Chriſt</hi> hath
not cleanſed them, the brand is ſtill upon them, as well as upon
the <hi>Idols themſelves</hi> to this day: Therefore as the <hi>Saints</hi> are to
keep themſelves from Idols, ſo are they to keep themſelves from
worſhipping in <hi>Idols Temples,</hi> becauſe the <hi>brand</hi> is upon them.</p>
            <p>Neither do we ſay that a <hi>place</hi> is an <hi>Idols Temple,</hi> becauſe <hi>Ido<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>latry</hi>
is committed there, as if a <hi>Papiſt</hi> ſhould <hi>croſſe himſelf,</hi> and
fall down and worſhip in his <hi>Idolatrous manner,</hi> in this or in an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>other
mans <hi>houſe,</hi> this doth not make it an <hi>Idols Temple;</hi> but
if he <hi>build</hi> and <hi>dedicate,</hi> and <hi>conſecrate</hi> a place <hi>of his own proper
goods,</hi> to an <hi>Idole:</hi> this is now an <hi>Idolatrous place,</hi> and <hi>God</hi> in
the time of the <hi>Law</hi> commanded <hi>Iſrael</hi> to pluck down all the <hi>I<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dolatrous
high places,</hi> but not all the houſes, therefore the hou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes
may ſtand, when <hi>the high places are quite pluckt down.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Then Mr. <hi>Goodwin</hi> returned to his former ſence, of that place
in the 4. of <hi>John,</hi> but it was denied that <hi>Jeſus Chriſt,</hi> doth in the
leaſt allow or countenance the woman of <hi>Samaria,</hi> or any <hi>Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maritan</hi>
or any <hi>Idolater</hi> elſe, or any man whatever, to worſhip
in <hi>Idols Temples.</hi> Then Mr. <hi>Goodwin</hi> to back it, returned to the
firſt Scripture in 1 <hi>Tim.</hi> 2. 10. concerning the word <hi>(every where)</hi>
but it was told him, that that was reſtrained by God himſelf, and
that by every where is meant, all places of <hi>Gods Creation,</hi> but
not of <hi>Mans limitation and dedication</hi> to an <hi>Idol,</hi> and therefore
not the <hi>Temple</hi> of <hi>Samaria,</hi> as he alleaged, from <hi>John</hi> 4. which
<pb n="20" facs="tcp:66521:13"/>
ſaith, <hi>The houre cometh; when ye ſhall neither at this Mountain, nor
yet at Jeruſalem worſhip the Father.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Then ſaid Mr. <hi>Goodwin,</hi> it is very clear from <hi>Iohn</hi> 4. Chriſts
ſpeech to the woman of <hi>Samaria,</hi> that he came to looſe the
bands wherewith men were bound, to come to worſhip at the
<hi>Temple</hi> of <hi>Jeruſalem,</hi> and in ſaying, neither at this <hi>Mountain,</hi>
nor yet at <hi>Jeruſalem,</hi> he doth not juſtifie the worſhip in the one
place more then the other.</p>
            <p>And if by <hi>ſpirit</hi> you meane the <hi>directions of the ſpirit,</hi> its true;
and by <hi>the ſpirit</hi> may be meant <hi>the ſpirit of a man,</hi> as <hi>Paul</hi> ſaith,
whom I ſerve in my <hi>ſpirit.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>To which Mr. <hi>Chidley</hi> anſwered. That <hi>Chriſt</hi> came to looſe
the <hi>bands</hi> which tyed men to the <hi>Temple</hi> of <hi>Jeruſalem,</hi> is true; but
it followeth not therefore, that he hath left us free to worſhip
in <hi>Idols Temples:</hi> he juſtified the worſhip in his own <hi>Temple;</hi> but
not in <hi>Idols Temples;</hi> neither doth the ſaying of <hi>Chriſt</hi> import
any ſuch thing; <hi>Chriſt</hi> ſaith afterwards to the <hi>woman, ye worſhip
ye know not what,</hi> as if he ſhould ſay, do not think that I do in
the leaſt juſtifie your practiſes, <hi>or your abominable Idols,</hi> or <hi>Idols
Temples,</hi> becauſe I have ſaid, <hi>neither at this Mountain, nor at Je<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ruſalem
ſhall ye worſhip the Father;</hi> but I would have you know,
<hi>that ye Samaritans worſhip ye know not what, we</hi> [Jewes] <hi>know
what we worſhip, for ſalvation is not of you</hi> Samaritans, <hi>but of the</hi>
Jewes, <hi>and Chriſt</hi> ſheweth that <hi>the Father muſt be worſhipped in
ſpirit and truth:</hi> now there is not the leaſt word of <hi>truth</hi> to ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtifie
worſhipping in the <hi>Idols Temples.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>And concerning the Allegations, that by the <hi>ſpirit</hi> is to be un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtood
the <hi>directions thereof,</hi> and is meant of <hi>a Mans ſpirit,</hi> and
the <hi>truth therein,</hi> as <hi>Paul</hi> ſaid, <hi>God whom</hi> I <hi>ſerve in my ſpirit.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Mr. <hi>Chidley</hi> anſwered, I grant that we are to ſerve <hi>God</hi> by the
directions of his <hi>ſpirit,</hi> and that is by his <hi>holy word,</hi> which di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>recteth
us not to worſhip in <hi>Idols Temples,</hi> but ſheweth that
they are ſin, and to be quite pulled down: And though <hi>Paul</hi>
ſaith, he ſerved <hi>God</hi> in his <hi>ſpirit,</hi> it may be taken, that he ſerved
<hi>God who was in his ſpirit,</hi> for <hi>God</hi> is ſaid to <hi>dwell in the Saints by
his ſpirit,</hi> and the Saints are exhorted <hi>to pray in the Holy Ghoſt
which is the ſpirit of God,</hi> who directeth us by his word of truth,
to which we are left for direction, which doth not allow any
to worſhip him in <hi>Idols Temples,</hi> and therefore this place in <hi>John</hi>
               <pb n="21" facs="tcp:66521:13"/>
4. 22. 23. by application maketh againſt them. That Scripture
ſaith Mr. <hi>Goodwin,</hi> doth not include by <hi>truth</hi> the <hi>circumſtance</hi>
of <hi>place.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>But it doth (ſaid Mr. <hi>Chidley)</hi> for <hi>the word is truth,</hi> which wit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſeth
againſt the <hi>Idols Temples,</hi> and layeth that <hi>brand</hi> upon
them, which the <hi>blood</hi> of <hi>Chriſt</hi> taketh not off.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>And whereas it is called a</hi> Circumſtance, <hi>it is more, its a</hi> mate<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rial
ſubſtance; <hi>ſeeing</hi> Gods Commands <hi>are ſo directly againſt</hi> I<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dols
Temples, <hi>I cannot believe (ſaid Mr.</hi> Goodwin) <hi>that</hi> ſtones <hi>are
capable of</hi> pollution, there's no place holy now; <hi>and therefore there
is no</hi> place unholy <hi>or</hi> polluted, <hi>but</hi> as all Creatures are cleane, ſo are
all places.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Mr.</hi> Chidley <hi>replyed,</hi> why may not ſtones be capable of pollution,
as well as a peece of bread? which bread and wine conſecrated by an
Idolatrous Prieſt, is the Table of Devils; and the Cup, the Cup of De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vils:
as contrariwiſe the bread and wine given in the Lords Supper, is
the Table and Cup of the Lord. <hi>And I deſire you Sir, to take what
hath been ſpoken into conſideration, &amp; before you depart,</hi>
               <note n="*" place="margin">Mr. Good<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>win was a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>part now.</note> 
               <hi>take
along with you this diſtinction which I once propoſed to divers
honeſt men, Mr.</hi> Burroughs; <hi>Mr.</hi> Burton, <hi>M.</hi> Sal<gap reason="illegible" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>marſh, <hi>M.</hi> Knowles,
<hi>and Dr.</hi> Holmes, <hi>and divers others; for in pleading about the</hi>
high places, <hi>they all unanimouſly concurr'd, that</hi> now in the time of
the Goſpel, there is nothing holy nor unholy; and this they ſaid was Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpel-liberty,
&amp; that to affirm contrary to this, was a taking away of the
liberty of the Goſpel. <hi>And they were ſo enamoured with this point,
that they repeated it divers times, which when I heard, I ſtood up
and ſaid, whereas it hath bin concluded, that there is nothing ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
nor unholy, and that to affirm there is, is to takeaway the li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>berty
of the Goſpel; I ſay, that</hi> now in the time of the Goſpel, ſome
things are holy, even the bread of the Lord, and the Cup of the Lord,
other things are unholy, even the table &amp; cup of Devils; &amp; other things
are meerly common; <hi>&amp; this</hi> Divinity <hi>I learned of the</hi> Apoſtle Paul,
<hi>who</hi> was not inferiour to the chiefeſt Apoſtles, <hi>who when he ſpeak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth
to the</hi> Corinthians, <hi>calleth the</hi> bread <hi>and</hi> wine <hi>in the</hi> Lords
Supper, the Table and Cup of the Lord, which none were to eat and
drink but holy perſons. <hi>That</hi> meat <hi>and</hi> drink <hi>which was in the</hi> I<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dols
Temples, <hi>he calleth it the</hi> Table <hi>and</hi> Cup of Devills, <hi>and there
is that which is meerely</hi> naturall <hi>and</hi> common, <hi>which words of
<pb n="22" facs="tcp:66521:14"/>
mine they took into conſideration, and I think Mr.</hi> Burroughs <hi>had
more ſight in it, then any of them all; and ſo likewiſe, I deſire
you, to take theſe things into conſideration. And whereas
it is objected, that</hi> becauſe there is no place holy now, <hi>that there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
there is</hi> no place unholy. <hi>Sir, it will not follow, that becauſe
there is no</hi> material place, <hi>which is the</hi> Temple of the Lord, <hi>as the</hi>
Temple <hi>of</hi> Jeruſalem <hi>in former time, that therefore there is no</hi>
Idols Temple, <hi>or</hi> Temple <hi>of</hi> Devills; <hi>for then by that account,
becauſe there is no</hi> fleſh <hi>of</hi> Beaſts <hi>now to be offered, according
to the ſaying, Sacrifice and offering thou wouldeſt not, there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
the fleſh in the</hi> Idols Temple <hi>is not uncleane; but the</hi> Apoſtle
<hi>calleth it</hi> The Table of Devills, <hi>as really as he calleth the</hi> holy
bread and wine, the Table and Cup of the Lord: <hi>Therefore as</hi> Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crifices
of Beaſts, are not now holy, <hi>yet the</hi> meat ſacrificed to Idols,
is the Table of Devills; <hi>ſo though</hi> there is no Temple holy now, <hi>yet</hi>
the Temples dedicated to Idols, are the Temples of Idols, the Temples
of Devills.</p>
            <p>I do believe Sir, that <hi>there is nothing unclean of itſelf,</hi> nor holy
of it ſelf, but <hi>inſtitution</hi> whether <hi>divine</hi> or <hi>diabolicall,</hi> maketh the
ſame otherwiſe then it was before, <hi>though it is in a manner com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon,
as David ſaid of the ſhew-bread,</hi> and ſo it hath been under
the <hi>Law,</hi> and ſo it is under the <hi>Goſpel.</hi>
