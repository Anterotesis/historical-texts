            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

VINDICATION
OF THE
Late CASE
OF
ALLEGIANCE, &amp;c.</head>
            <p>IN a <hi>Postscript to an Answer to a late Pamphlet intituled, O<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bedience
and Submission to the Present Government, demon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>strated
from Bishop</hi> Overal'<hi>s Convocation Book,</hi> the Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thor
is pleased to Examine what I have said relating to
the said Subject, in my <hi>Case of Allegiance due to Soveraign
Powers;</hi> He writes with great triumph and assurance, which it
seems Men may do, who are resolved never to own a Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stake;
though he thinks it unpardonable in me, who have
been so weak, as to confess, that I am not Infallible, ever to
believe my own Senses again. He threatens an Answer to
my Arguments <hi>in due Time;</hi> and I will patiently expect till
his <hi>due Time</hi> comes, and apply myself at present to his <hi>Post<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>script,</hi>
and <hi>Answer,</hi> as far as I am concerned in it; but shall
beg leave to follow my own Method, and justifie what I have
said in the same Order, I have said it in, his altering of which
has more Art than Honesty in it.</p>
            <p>The Mighty Place, <hi>as he truly calls it, is</hi> Chap. 28. Pag. 57.
<hi>where the</hi> Convocation <hi>having given an Account of the Vari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous
and Irregular Revolutions of Government, brought about
by the Providence of GOD,</hi> 
               <q>
                  <hi>who for the Sins of any Nation
or Country, altereth their Governments and Governours, trans<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferreth,
<pb n="2" facs="tcp:50779:3"/>
setteth up, and bestoweth Kingdoms, as it seemeth best
to his heavenly Wisdom, they add these remarkable Words:</hi>
               </q>
And when having attained their Ungodly Desires, (whether ambi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tious
Kings by bringing any Country into their Subjection, or disloyal
Subjects by their rebellious Rising against their natural Soveraigns)
they have established any of the same degenerate Forms of Govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
among their People; the Authority either so Unjustly gotten,
or wrung by Force from the true and lawful Possessor, being always
GOD's Authority (and therefore receiving no Impeachment by the
Wickedness of those that have it) is ever (when any such Altera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions
are throughly settled) to be Reverenced and Obeyed, and the
People of all sorts (as well of the Clergy, as of the Laity) are to
be subject unto it, not only for Wrath, but also for Conscience sake.</p>
            <p>This I then thought, and think so still (though our Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thor
thinks not) a very plain Testimony, that all Usurped
Powers,<note place="margin">Cast of Al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leg. <hi>p.</hi> 5.</note> when <hi>throughly settled,</hi> have GOD's Authority, and
must be Obeyed: And while I was transcribing this Passage,
there came to my hand the <hi>New Observator</hi> of <hi>Friday, Dec. 5,
1690, Vol. 3. Numb.</hi> 12. containing a Letter written by King
<hi>Iames</hi> the First, with relation to this very <hi>Convocation,</hi> which
he says he transcribed <hi>Verbatim</hi> from the Original, communi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cated
to him by an eminent Person, in whose hands it is; the
four last Lines of which are written with King <hi>Iames</hi>'s own
hand, and the rest, as he guesses, by the then Secretary of
State. The Letter was written to Dr. <hi>Abbot;</hi> I shall not tran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>scribe
the whole, but such Passages as may satisfie us, how
King <hi>Iames</hi> himself understood the <hi>Convocation.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>You have dipt too deep in what all Kings reserve among the <hi>Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cana
Imperii.</hi> And whatever Aversion you may profess against
GOD's being the Author of Sin, you have stumbled upon the Thre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>shold
of that Opinion, in saying upon the matter, That even Tyran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny
is GOD's Authority, and should be reverenced as such. If the
King of <hi>Spain</hi> should return to claim his old Pontifical Right to my
Kingdom, you leave me to seek for others to Fight for it; for you
tell me upon the matter before hand, his Authority is GOD's Autho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity,
if he prevail.</p>
            <p>This makes so much for our <hi>Author</hi> indeed, that King <hi>Iames</hi>
did not like the Doctrine of the <hi>Convocation,</hi> no more than <hi>he</hi>
does; but then it proves against him, that K. <hi>Iames</hi> understood
the <hi>Convocation</hi> not in his, but in my Sence: For when he
charges them with <hi>saying upon the Matter,</hi> (that is, in sence, tho'
<pb n="3" facs="tcp:50779:3"/>
not in express words) <hi>that Tyranny is God's Authority, and should
be reverenced as such,</hi> it is the very Interpretation I there give of
it, <hi>That those Princes, who have no legal Right to their Thrones,
may yet have God's Authority:</hi> for by <hi>Tyranny</hi> the King meant
such Princes as are <hi>Tyranni sine Titulo,</hi> or Illegal Kings; for as
for Tyrants <hi>Exercitio,</hi> who are Rightful Kings, but govern Ty<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rannically,
neither K. <hi>Iames</hi> nor this <hi>Author</hi> would dispute, whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
they have God's Authority. And if they may have God's
Authority, whilst they are in the first sence <hi>Tyrants,</hi> or have no
legal Right to their Thrones, then their Government may be
<hi>thoroughly settled</hi> as the <hi>Convocation</hi> speaks, without a legal Right;
for till <hi>a thorough Settlement,</hi> according to the Doctrine of the
<hi>Convocation,</hi> they have not God's Authority; and when the
King charges them with <hi>saying upon the matter, That Tyranny is
God's Authority,</hi> he must conclude, that they taught, that such
Tyrants might be <hi>throughly settled</hi> in their Government; for if
they cannot <hi>be settled</hi> till they obtain a legal Title, they must
cease to be such Tyrants, before they have God's Authority:
And it is evident, that K. <hi>Iames</hi> did not apprehend, that the
<hi>Convocation</hi> meant by <hi>a thorough Settlement,</hi> (as this <hi>Author</hi> ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pounds
it) a <hi>Settlement</hi> by <hi>the Death or Cession</hi> of the rightful
King and all his Heirs, or by <hi>a long Prescription of an hundred Years,</hi>
of which more presently; for he was afraid, that by this Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrine,
the King of <hi>Spain,</hi> should he claim by his Pontifical
Right, and prevail in it, might, while he himself lived, be so
thoroughly setled in the Kingdom of <hi>England,</hi> as to have God's
Authority, and then his Subjects must not Fight for him, their
old rightful King, against the King of <hi>Spain,</hi> who by a thorough
Settlement and Possession of the Throne of <hi>England,</hi> would be
invested with God's Authority, and must not be opposed by the
Subjects of <hi>England.</hi> The King disliked this Doctrine so much,
that he thought fit to suppress it, and to reserve it among the
<hi>Arcana Imperii;</hi> which was a much wiser course then to palliate
it with such forced Interpretations, as no impartial Reader can
think to be the sence of the <hi>Convocation.</hi> If I have mistaken
the sence of the <hi>Convocation,</hi> I have done no more then King
<hi>Iames</hi> did, who was nearly concerned to know, what they
meant: if I err in following the <hi>Convocation,</hi> I err with as great
and learned Men, as any Age of the Church has bred; I err
with the Church of <hi>England,</hi> if we may learn the Sence of the
Church from a <hi>Convocation.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <pb n="4" facs="tcp:50779:4"/>
But let us set aside the <hi>King's Letter,</hi> and try if we can learn
the sense of the <hi>Convocation</hi> from the <hi>Convocation</hi> itself.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>I observed in the first place, from the Words of the</hi> Convocation,
That those Princes,<note place="margin">Case of Al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leg. <hi>p.</hi> 5.</note> who have no Legal Right to their Thrones, may
yet have God's Authority: <hi>which I proved, because</hi> the Convoca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
speaks of Illegal and Usurped Powers, and yet affirms, that the
Authority exercised by them, is God's Authority.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>To this our</hi> Author <hi>answers,</hi>
               <note place="margin">
                  <hi>Postcript,</hi> p. 3.</note> The Doctor will not, but the Convo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cation
distinguishes between the means of acquiring the Power, and the
Power itself; the means of acquiring Power may be very unjust and ille<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gal,
and yet the Power afterwards may be very Legal. But the Doctor
resolves they must be all one; and because the Convocation speaks of
the Ambition of encroaching Kings, and the Rebellion of Subjects, as a
means, whereby Governments have been altered; therefore by a Govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
being throughly setled, they must mean usurped Powers. As if it
were impossible for such beginnings afterwards to acquire a Right, and to
terminate in a Legal Title; and till that is, the Government is as un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>just
as the Rebellion and Encroachment. <hi>So that according to this</hi>
Author, <hi>a Government, which is illegally and wickedly begun,
when it is legally setled has God's Authority, and this is all, that
the</hi> Convocation <hi>meant by it.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>As for what he says, That <hi>I will not distinguish between the means
of acquiring Power, and the Power itself.</hi> I do not indeed distinguish
as he does, but I distinguish as the <hi>Convocation</hi> does, that the
Means are wicked; but the Power and Authority is Gods;
which is all the distinction the <hi>Convocation</hi> makes; and I desire
him to shew me, where the <hi>Convocation</hi> says, that the Govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
which is illegally acquired, cannot be throughly setled, till
it becomes Legal; if this had been their meaning, it had been
easily said, and had prevented all mistakes about it, which their
words without this limitation are very apt to betray Men into.</p>
            <p>I believe all unbiassed Men who are not prepossed with other
Notions, and concerned, that the <hi>Convocation</hi> should be on their
side, would never dream of our Author's Sence of the <hi>Convocation.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>For 1. If the</hi> Convocation <hi>meant no more than our Author says,
that a Government illegally begun, when it is legally setled,
has God's Authority, what a wonderful discovery is this, that</hi>
Legal Princes <hi>have God's Authority! for who doubts of this?
What need was there to introduce this with such a long pom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pous
Preface of the changes of Government, by the Ambition of
Princes, and the Rebellion of Subjects? For let Governments
<pb n="5" facs="tcp:50779:4"/>
begin how they will, when they are once legally setled, no
Man, that I know of, who owns the Authority of any Govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
to be from God, disputes theirs. Which makes me
wonder at our Author's reason,</hi>
               <note place="margin">Answer, pag. 21.</note> viz. Left it should be thought,
that wicked ways of obtaining this Right, was a prejudice to the
Right itself, and people should from thence take occasion to rebel, and
disturb all the Governments of the World, because they could not shew
an express Order from God, or derive the Pedigree of their Govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
even from <hi>Adam</hi> and <hi>Noah;</hi> to prevent the terrible Confusion
that such a Notion would make in the World, they say, That the wic<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ked
ways of attaining it, or the wickedness of the persons that have it,
is no impeachment of the Right itself; but when it is attain'd it is
God's Authority, and ought to be obeyed.</p>
            <p>That is to say, a wise and grave <hi>Convocation</hi> write a whole
<hi>Chapter</hi> to confute a Notion, without naming it, or giving any
hint at it, which if ever it entred into any mad Man's Head,
yet never did, never can disturb any Government, till a Nation
is fitter for <hi>Bedlam,</hi> than to be directed by a <hi>Convocation:</hi>
whereas the Difficulties occasioned by the Changes and Revo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lutions
of Government, especially when a rightful Prince
is dispossessed, and another setled in his Throne, are very
great, and worthy of the determination of a Convocation
to direct Mens Consciences in such cases; and which is the most
probable account of this matter, let every one judge.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>2dly,</hi> When the <hi>Convocation</hi> speaks of the Settlement of Ille<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gal
Powers, which began by Ambition and Rebellion, it is ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nifestly
unreasonable, unless it had been expressed, to expound
this of a Legal Settlement, by acquiring a new Legal Right.
<hi>Settlement,</hi> I grant, as our <hi>Author</hi> says, is a Term of Law, and
used by Lawyers of a Legal Settlement, and must always in
reason be understood so in Law, when the contrary is not ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pressed;
but yet a firm and stable possession without Right,
must be confessed, to be a Settlement too, though not a right<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful
Settlement: I suppose, our <hi>Author</hi> will not deny, but that
the Government was setled in fact under the Three <hi>Heneries,</hi> tho'
in his sense it was not a Legal Settlement.</p>
            <p>Now as it is reasonable in Law, to understand a Settlement of
a Legal Settlement, when the contrary is not expressed, because
the Law must speak of such Settlements as are according to Law;
so for the same reason, when the <hi>Convocation</hi> speaks of the Set<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tlement
of Powers, which are against Law, it must be under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stood
<pb n="6" facs="tcp:50779:5"/>
of the Settlement of Possession, not of Right, unless this
had been expressed; for the only ordinary way of setling illegal
Powers is by Possession, not by Right, and that ever such Pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers
be afterwards legally setled is a great accident, and therefore
the natural and obvious exposition of <hi>Settlement</hi> in such Cases, is
a Settlement of Possession; and it argues great perverseness of
mind to reject that sence of the Word, which is proper to the
Subject to which it is applied, for such a Sence as is forreign
and unnatural.</p>
            <p>It is plain, that the <hi>Right</hi> and <hi>Settlement</hi> of <hi>Government</hi> are
two very different things, for they may be parted; the first re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lates
to the Title, the second to the setled Possession, and Exer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cise
of Government: and whenever a rightful King is dispos<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sessed,
our <hi>Author</hi> must grant, that his Settlement is gone, tho'
not his Right; and if Right and Settlement may be parted, I
desire to know, why there may not be a Settlement without
Right; and then it is ridiculous to conclude, that Settlement
must always signifie Right.</p>
            <p>Nay, the Addition of <hi>Thorough</hi> plainly refers Settlement to
<hi>Possession,</hi> and not to <hi>Right;</hi> for there are no degrees of <hi>Right,</hi>
no more than there are of <hi>Truth;</hi> for all Right in this Case of
a Legal Title is <hi>Thorough Rite;</hi> but there are degrees of Settle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment,
as that signifies Possession; for Princes may be more or
less setled in the Possession and Exercise of Government; which
is reason enough to expound <hi>thoroughly setled</hi> of a <hi>thorough setled
possession</hi> of Power, and Authority, or a compleat and perfect
Administration of the Government.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>3dly,</hi> Let us consider what our <hi>Author</hi> makes necessary to the
thorough Settlement of such Powers as begin by Usurpation or
Rebellion, and try what sense it will make of what the <hi>Convoca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion</hi>
says.</p>
            <p>Now he tells us,<note place="margin">
                  <hi>Answer,</hi> pag. 19.</note> 
               <hi>That a Right to a Government may be acquired,
by the death or cession of the Person in whom the Right was:</hi> and <hi>this</hi>
(he says) <hi>is the case: In this Chapter the Convocation mentions several
Variations of Government, as to the Forms, Aristocracy and Democra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy;
and as to the ambitious encroaching of Kings upon their Neigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bours;
and particularly the Four Monarchies, and the King of</hi> Baby<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lon
<hi>upon the</hi> Jews: <hi>All which respective Governments; tho they were
begun by Rebellion, Ambition, and unlawful means (which the Convoca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
condemns) yet afterwards they became lawful Governments, and
had such a right to the respective Governments they did possess:</hi> and
<pb n="7" facs="tcp:50779:5"/>
this is to be <hi>thoroughly setled.</hi> To the death and cession of the
person in whom the Right was, he adds in another place, <hi>when
the right to the Government is acquired by prescription, and that is a
long and uninterrupted possession joyned with the consent of the people;</hi>
that is,<note place="margin">Ibid. p. 27.</note> a possession of an hundred Years, as he has learnt from
Bishop <hi>Buckeridge.</hi> So that to make a legal settlement of a Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernment
illegally begun, the rightful Prince, and all his Heirs,
must die, or resign up their Government to the Usurper; or
the Usurper and his Heirs must reign about an hundred Years,
and then he may come to be a legal King; though this settle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
by <hi>prescription</hi> I do not well understand. For suppose the
Usurper should have an uninterrupted possession of an hundred
Years, will this make him a rightful King without <hi>the death</hi> or
<hi>cession</hi> of the whole Royal Family? If it will, how does the Roy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>al
Family come to lose their right by an usurped possession of
their Throne? for how long soever it has been, it is an usur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pation
still, and the right is still in them: and if an usurpation
will destroy their right, why not a short usurpation, as well as
a long one? for it is all but usurpation still: and how will our
<hi>Author</hi> justifie the people in consenting, that such an usurper
should reign, while their rightful King is living? or how long
must the usurper reign before the people must consent to it?
and how long must he reign afterwards with their consent,
before he comes to be <hi>thoroughly setled</hi> as a lawful King? or if
the lawful King must die, or resign his Crown to settle the u<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>surper,
what need of so long a prescription? since he tells us,
that <hi>a possessory Right is something, and where there is no better, that
ought to carry it; and the conclusion from hence is this: That any
person (by what means soever) gaining the possession of the Throne,
if there be no better claims against him,</hi>
               <note place="margin">Ibid. p. 19.</note> 
               <hi>then he hath a right to it, and
then and not till then he is throughly setled.</hi> So that according to
my understanding, this presciption signifies nothing. If there
be no body, that has a better claim to the Crown, possession
gives a right: if there be, I desire to know of our <hi>Author,</hi> whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
an hundred years possession is a good right against a bet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
claim; or how this better claim comes to expire after an
hundred years usurpation? But however, we will take it all to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether,
and see what can he made of it.</p>
            <p>Now I observe, 1. That all the <hi>Convocation</hi> says, relates to
the visible and actual alterations of Governments and Gover<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nours,
and translation of Kingdoms, <hi>brought about by the wicked<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness
<pb n="8" facs="tcp:50779:6"/>
of men, but disposed by the divine foresight and providence to ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>complish
his own wise counsels.</hi> Now this is matter of fact, not
of right, unless all alterations of Government are rightful and
legal: and therefore the settlement of such alteratious is an
actual not a legal settlement of them. And this brings the
Dispute to matter of sense; for if such alterations of Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernment
and translation of Kingdoms may he made and set<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led
without the death or cession of the rightful King, and
without the prescription of an hundred years, then the death
or cession of the King, or a long prescription cannot be ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cessary
to the settlement, the <hi>Convocation</hi> speaks of; for there
may be an actual and visible settlement without it, which is
all that is required to an actual and visible translation of King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>doms;
and that is all the <hi>Convocation</hi> intended. And he who
will venture to say, that a new Prince can't be actually and vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sibly
setled in the Throne, while the old rightful King is
living and makes his claim, shall dispute by himself for me.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>2ly.</hi> The <hi>Convocation</hi> expresly teaches, that the Authority,
which is God's Authority, and must be reverenced and obey<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed,
when such Alterations are <hi>throughly setled,</hi> is the Authority,
<hi>which is unjustly gotten, or wrung by force from the true and law<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful
possessor:</hi> and then it is plain, it is not a legal Authority by
<hi>the death or cession</hi> of the rightful King; for we are to obey it,
as God's Authority, though it be wrung by force from the
true and lawful possessor; and though the present possessor
should have no other visible Title to it, but such unjust force.
The words are these: <hi>The Authority either so unjustly gotten, or
wrung by force from the true and lawful possessor, being always God's
Authority (and therefore receiving no impeachment by the wickedness
of those that have it) is ever (when any such alterations are throughly
setled) to be reverenced and obeyed,</hi> &amp;c. Now let any man,
who understands Grammar, construe this otherwise, if he can.
What Authority is that, which must be obeyed and reverenced?
It is (says the Convocation) <hi>the Authority unjustly gotten, or wrung
by force, from the true and lawful possessor;</hi> and therefore not a new
legal Authority gained by <hi>death or cession,</hi> or <hi>a long prescription.</hi>
What is <hi>God's Authority,</hi> which we must obey? It is no other,
<hi>than the Authority unjustly gotten, or wrung by force,</hi> &amp;c. which <hi>can
receive no impeachment by the wickedness of those, who have it.</hi> By
what <hi>wickedness?</hi> their wicked and ungodly and violent means
of getting and having it: for the <hi>Convocation</hi> speaks of no other
<pb n="9" facs="tcp:50779:6"/>
wickedness, but the wickedness of Usurpation: so that we must
obey the Authority, because it is Gods, even when men have
it wickedly, and therefore before they have acquired any new
legal Title to it.</p>
            <p>And this I think plainly proves, that the settlement, the <hi>Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vocation</hi>
speaks of, is not a legal settlement, for that would make
the Authority legal, whereas these Alterations may be <hi>throughly
setled,</hi> whilest the Authority exercised in such new Governments
is unjustly and wickedly got and possessed. This, I think, if
our <hi>Author</hi> be not very unreasonable, is enough to justifie my
first Assertion, <hi>That the Convocation speaks of illegal and usurped
Powers, and yet affirms the Authority exercised by them is God's Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thority,
and therefore those Princes, who have no legal Right, may
have God's Authority.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>I proceeded to prove the same thing from other testimonies
out of the <hi>Convocation Book.</hi>
               <note place="margin">Case of Al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leg. p. 6.</note> For <hi>they teach, that the Lord</hi> (in
advancing Kings to their Thrones) <hi>is not bound by those Laws
which he prescribeth others to observe, and therefore commanded Iehu
a subject to be anointed King over</hi> Israel <hi>to punish the sins of</hi> Ahab
<hi>and</hi> Jezebel, (p. 46.) And <hi>the Lord both may and is able to over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>throw
any Kings or Emperors, notwithstanding any claim, Right,
Title, or Interest, which they can challenge to their Countreys, King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>doms,
or Empires.</hi> These Passages our <hi>Author</hi> has thought fit to
take no notice of; for if they do not prove God's Sovereign
Authority, to remove and pull down the most rightful Kings,
and give his Authority to those, who have no right, and place
them in the Thrones of those, who have the right, there is no
sense to be made of them.</p>
            <p>Our <hi>Author's hypothesis</hi> is as direct a contradiction to this, as
words can make it: for if no Prince can have God's Authority,
nor must be obeyed, unless he have a legal Right, either an old
Hereditary Right, or a new Acquired Right, by the death or
cession of the Royal Family, or by a long prescription; then
<hi>God is bound to those Laws in advancing Kings, which he prescribes
to others;</hi> that is, to adhere to Humane Rights: then <hi>God may
not overthrow any Kings or Emperors, who challenge their Countries,
Kingdoms, or Empires, by any just Claim, Right, Title, or Interest.</hi>
Then he cannot set up any Kings, or Emperors, who have no just
right and claim. For he cannot unmake a rightful King, if he
cannot absolve Subjects from their Allegiance; nor make a
King without a legal Right, if he cannot give him his Autho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity,
<pb n="10" facs="tcp:50779:7"/>
and transfer the Allegiance of Subjects to him. God can
remove the Man by death, but cannot unmake the King, unless
he unmake himselfe by resigning his Crown; He can set a Man
upon the Throne, but cannot make a King of him, without the
leave of the Right Heir, under an hundred years prescription:
Whereever our <hi>Author</hi> learnt this Doctrine, I am sure, this <hi>Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vocation</hi>
never taught it him.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>To confirm this, I observed, that the</hi> Convocation <hi>teaches, that
Obedience was due to such Kings, as never could have any legal
Right to the Government of</hi> Israel; <hi>as the Kings of the</hi> Moabites
<hi>and</hi> Aramites,<note place="margin">Ibid.</note> 
               <hi>of</hi> Aegypt <hi>and</hi> Babylon, <hi>and yet says,</hi> that the <hi>Is<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>raelites</hi>
knew, that it was not lawful for them of themselves, and by
their own Authority, to take Arms against the Kings, whose Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jects
they were, though indeed they were Tyrants. <hi>And</hi> that it had
not been lawful for <hi>Ahud</hi> to have killed King <hi>Eglon,</hi> had he not
first been made by God, the Iudge, Prince, and Ruler of the People.</p>
            <p>On the other hand our <hi>Author</hi> affirms, that all these Kings
had a legal Right;<note place="margin">Postscript, p. 3.</note> and were legal Powers; and <hi>that it appears
in all and every one of the Instances the Convocation gives of Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernment,
to which they say obedience is due, that these Governments
had such a Right.</hi>
               <note place="margin">Ans. p. 19.</note> This is a bold Undertaker, unless he only play
with equivocal words; and that I believe is the truth of the
matter; for such legal Rights, as he has found for these Prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces,
will quickly transubstantiate all usurped Powers into legal
Governments.</p>
            <p>But our first Inquiry is, What the <hi>Convocation</hi> thought of
these Kings; as for instance, the Kings of the <hi>Aramites</hi> and
<hi>Moabites,</hi> who ruled over and oppressed <hi>Israel;</hi> whether they
thought them the legal and rightful Kings of <hi>Israel;</hi> they call
indeed the <hi>Israelites,</hi> their <hi>Subjects,</hi> as our <hi>Author</hi> observes; and
from thence proves, that these Kings had a legal power over
<hi>Israel;</hi> but the mischief is, that the Convocation in express
words owns them to be only Kings <hi>de facto,</hi> to whom they
were in subjection, and teaches, that if any man shall affirm,
<hi>that any person, born a Subject, and affirming by all the Arguments,
which Wit or Learning could devise, that God had called him to mur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
the King</hi> de facto, <hi>under whom he lived; yea, though he should
first have procured himself to be proclaimed and anointed King, as</hi>
Adonijah <hi>did, and should afterwards have laid violent hands upon
his Master, ought therefore to be believed of any that feared God, he
doth greatly err.</hi> Which is spoke with reference to <hi>Ahud</hi>'s kil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling
<pb n="11" facs="tcp:50779:7"/>
King <hi>Eglon,</hi> who it seems, was but a King <hi>de Facto,</hi> in the
judgment of the <hi>Convocation;</hi> and, I suppose, our <hi>Author</hi> knows
what a King <hi>de Facto</hi> signifies, in opposition to a King <hi>de Iure,</hi>
one who is King without a legal Right: and yet the <hi>Convocati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on</hi>
asserts that such Kings <hi>de Facto</hi> must not be murdered by
their Subjects; which is an express Determination against our
<hi>Author.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Let us now see what legal Right and Title our <hi>Author</hi> has
found, for the Kings of the <hi>Aramites,</hi> and <hi>Moabites,</hi> and <hi>Babylo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nians</hi>
over <hi>Israel;</hi> and for all the <hi>four Monarchies,</hi> which were
successively Erected with the most manifest Violence and Usur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pation:<note place="margin">
                  <hi>Postscript,</hi> p. 2.</note>
And that is, the Submission both of Prince and People,
which he says, I grant, gives a legal Right; whereas I only said,
That <hi>the Submission of the Prince might be thought necessary to trans<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fer
a legal Right;</hi> which I think differs a little from granting it
does so.</p>
            <p>The truth is, our <hi>Author</hi> is here blunder'd for want of clear
and distinct Notions of what he writes, and imposes upon him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>self
and others with ambiguous Terms; which if they were
truly stated, would clear all these Difficulties.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Legal Powers</hi> signifie such Powers as are according to Law;
but then there are different kinds of Laws, and when we speak
of <hi>legal Powers,</hi> unless we agree by what Law we call them <hi>Le<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gal,</hi>
we shall never understand one another.</p>
            <p>Now we may understand <hi>Legal,</hi> either with respect to the
Laws of Nature, the Laws of Nations, or the Laws and Consti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tutions
of a particular Nation or Kingdom; and in this last
sence <hi>Legal</hi> is understood by all Men, who understand them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves,
in this Controversie of <hi>legal Powers;</hi> that those only are <hi>le<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gal
Powers,</hi> who have the rightful Authority of Government ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording
to the Laws and Constitutions of the Kingdom which
they govern: This is the reason of the Distinction between a
King <hi>de Iure</hi> and <hi>de Facto,</hi> which relates to the particular Laws
and Constitutions of the Kingdom; a King <hi>de Iure</hi> is a right<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful
King by the Laws of the Land; a King <hi>de Facto,</hi> whatever
other Right he may have, is not rightfully and lawfully posses<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed
of the Crown, by the Laws of Succession proper to that
Kingdom. And if our <hi>Author</hi> will take the Controversie off of
this Bottom, and dispute only about legal Powers in general,
we will then admit his Plea of Submission, and joyn issue with
him upon that Point.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="12" facs="tcp:50779:8"/>
And this is all the Mystery I intended, when I affirmed, that
the <hi>Moabites</hi> and <hi>Aramites, Aegyptians</hi> and <hi>Babylonians,</hi> could not
have <hi>a legal and natural</hi> Right to Govern <hi>Israel;</hi> that is, that by
the Constitutions of the <hi>Iewish</hi> Commonwealth, they could not
give the Power of the Government to a Stranger, nor set up a
Prince over them, who was not of their Brethren; and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
no Strangers, neither <hi>Aramites</hi> nor <hi>Moabites,</hi> could be their
legal Kings. As for their Submission, when under Force, it
shall be considered presently.</p>
            <p>This made me smile to see how he was concerned to ward
off a Blow,<note place="margin">
                  <hi>Postscript,</hi> p. 3.</note> which was never intended him; for since the <hi>Isra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>elites</hi>
did submit to the <hi>Aramites</hi> and <hi>Moabites,</hi> &amp;c. and accord<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
to our <hi>Author,</hi> Submission gives a legal Right, he could not
imagine why I said, that those Nations never could have a legal
Right to the Government of <hi>Israel,</hi> unless it were, because <hi>God
was at that time their Soveraign, and He did not submit;</hi> and the
Submission of the Soveraign, as well as of the People, is necessa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry
to give a legal Right: And now he had started an Objection,
which he knew not what to do with; and his Answer is as ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>travagant
as the Objection; for he has found out something,
which he thinks equivalent to God's Submission to the <hi>Aramites</hi>
and <hi>Moabites,</hi> and that is, <hi>that God delivered them into their hands:</hi>
What then? did God resign his Government of <hi>Israel</hi> into the
hands of the <hi>Aramites</hi> and <hi>Moabites,</hi> and quit his Right and Claim
to the Government of them? <hi>Spectatum admissiâ</hi>
            </p>
            <p>But to proceed: I will grant this <hi>Author,</hi> that <hi>legal Powers</hi>
may be understood in a larger Notion, as that may be said to
be <hi>Legal,</hi> which is agreeable to the Laws of Nature or Nations;
and in this sence, Submission may make a <hi>legal King</hi> of him,
who, according to the Laws of the Land, can be only <hi>a King
de Facto.</hi> This is worth considering, and therefore I shall brief<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
explain it:</p>
            <p>In a State of Nature, wherein we must suppose all Men free
from any Government, but that of Parents, and Heads of Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>milies,
(which how far it extended before Civil Governments
were formed, we cannot tell) they were at liberty to give up
the Government of themselves to whom they pleased; and this
made such Persons their legal and rightful Princes and Gover<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nours
by the Law of Nature: For Men who are free, may give
the Government of themselves to another, and if they may do
this, their doing it is a Law to themselves.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="13" facs="tcp:50779:8"/>
Especially Nature teaches this, When Men are over-powered
by Force, and must either submit to the Government, or suffer
the Vengeance and Fury of an Usurping <hi>Nimrod;</hi> for Nature
teaches us to preserve ourselves, and therefore justifies whatever
may be lawfully done to preserve ourselves; and in a State of
Nature Men may part with their Liberty, and submit to be
governed by another; and such a Submission, with respect to
themselves, gives a Right; for it is a voluntary Consent, tho'
extorted by Force, as all <hi>Moralists</hi> allow such a mixt Choice
and Election to be.</p>
            <p>But it will be said, This is nothing to us, who are at such a
distance from the first Original of Government: this can be
done but once; for when we have given up ourselves to the
Government of another, we have given away our Liberty to
chuse for ourselves.</p>
            <p>Right! unless we fall into a State of Nature and Liberty a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gain,
or something like it; which may be done many ways,
but I shall name but one, and that is in case of a new prevailing
Force; that is, with respect to a Kingdom, when Prince and
People are conquered, for then the Government is at an end,
and they are as much at liberty to submit to a Conquering
Prince, as they were in the State of Nature; for every Dissolu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
of Government must so far restore us to the State and Li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>berties
of Nature, as to provide for ourselves; or if the Prince
be conquered, and driven out of his Kingdom, and the People
in the Power of the Conqueror, they are as perfectly at liberty
to submit to the new Conqueror, as they were before to submit
to their old Prince, or his Ancestors; with respect to private
Subjects, when their Prince or the Government of the Nation
is violently Changed, and they are as much under the Force and
Power of the new Prince, or new Government, as they could
be under a conquering Prince, who had Conquered both King
and People: for Force will justifie Submission, and then it is
much the same thing from what quarter the Force comes: when
a Man is under the power of a new Government, which he can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not
resist, and which will not protect him, nay, which will un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>do
and ruine him, if he will not submit, it is all one to him,
with respect to his Submission, as if both his King and Country
were absolutely conquered.</p>
            <p>Though we live under a settled Government, yet if we hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pen
to fall into the hands of Thieves and Robbers, where the
<pb n="14" facs="tcp:50779:9"/>
Government can't protect us, we may very innocently for our
own preservation, promise and swear to them such things, as are
against the Laws of the Land, and which it would be unlawful
for us to do in other circumstances; and then I think with great<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er
reason, if the Government cannot protect itself, nor its Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jects,
from a greater Force, Subjects are at liberty to shift for
themselves, and to submit to the greater Power; for our Obli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gations
to human Government are reasonably supposed to ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cept
the case of a greater force, since such Obligations can last
no longer than the Government lasts. Conquest is the death and
dissolution of the Government, and dissolves the Contract, as
the death of either Party does the Marriage-Vow. This is not
as some vainly talk to justifie the breach of Oaths and Promises
to save ourselves, and to make Self-preservation the only Supreme
Rule of Good and Evil; but the dissolution of the Government,
or of the Power of the Prince to protect himself or his Subjects
in his Government, puts an end to the Obligation of Oaths: for
in matters of Government, it is an unalterable Right of Nature
to submit to Force.</p>
            <p>All Men will grant, that no human Laws and Constitutions
are so sacred as the positive Laws of God; I mean that Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernment
and Polity which God himself prescribed to the Chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren
of <hi>Israel;</hi> which they were religiously bound to observe by
vertue of their Covenant with God; which certainly was as sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cred
as any Oath. Now these Laws did not admit of the Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thority
and Government of Strangers, but expresly forbad it;
that had they chose to be governed by any Foreign Prince, they
had greatly sinned in it; but this very Law, as sacred as it was,
gave way to necessity, and when they were conquered by the
<hi>Aramites,</hi> or <hi>Moabites,</hi> or any other Nation, it was no fault to
submit to them. And if Force would justifie this in the <hi>Israe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lites,</hi>
who had God for their King, and were obliged by their
Covenant with him to accept of no Forreign Prince to govern
them; it is hard if it will not justifie the Subjects of Human
Governments, (most of which were at first founded in meer
Force) whatever their Oaths or Obligations be, to submit to
a new and greater Force.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>And this gives a sufficient Answer to what our</hi> Author <hi>adds in
the place last quoted: That God's being the King of</hi> Israel, would
be an argument against their submission; for the Doctor tells us, That
where God entails the Crown, <hi>(he refers to what I say about</hi> Io<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ash
<pb n="15" facs="tcp:50779:9"/>
               <hi>and</hi> Athaliah, <hi>of which more anon)</hi> the people were not to sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mit
to an Usurper, if the right Heir was alive; and therefore much
more where God himself was their King, <hi>(as if God were not the
King of</hi> Israel, <hi>when he set Kings over them)</hi> and then surely they
might lawfully resist these Kings, whose Subjects they were not, nor
could be, and they needed no especial Commission or Direction to destroy
the Usurpers, as <hi>Ahud</hi> did <hi>Eglon;</hi> but they might, nay they were bound
to do it, as <hi>Jehoiada</hi> slew <hi>Athaliah.</hi> For I hope God s Entail is not
of greater force than his own immediate Government. So that either
their submission transferred a legal Right, or else their submission was a sin.</p>
            <p>This looks like something very deep, but it is so very a no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing,
that I cannot devise what he would be at: Would he
prove, that God was not the King of <hi>Israel,</hi> against the Scriptures,
who say he was? Or would he prove, that the <hi>Israelites</hi> ought
not to have submitted to the <hi>Moabites,</hi> but have had all their
Throats cut by a vain opposition? Or would he prove against
the <hi>Convocation,</hi> that they were not the Subjects of King <hi>Eglon,</hi>
but any <hi>Israelite</hi> might have killed him without any such Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mission
from God, as <hi>Ahud</hi> had? Whatever he intends to prove,
if he knows that himself; yet as far as I am concerned, it is no
more but this: That while the <hi>Israelites</hi> were under no Forreign
Force, but had liberty to live by their own Laws, they were
bound to make him their Prince, on whom God had entailed
the Crown; while they were under Force, they might do as
they could, and submit to the Conqueror, which submission
could not give those Usurpers a Legal Right, according to the
Laws and Constitutions of the <hi>Iewish</hi> Common-wealth, but ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording
to the Laws of Nature, which allow submission unto a
Conquerour, it did.</p>
            <p>Now if the Laws of Nature, when we are under the Prote<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction
of no Government, allow us to submit to Force and Power;
then call it Conquest, or what you will, when I am under no
Protection, and under Force, I am at liberty to submit, what<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever
my former Obligations were; and I become as firmly and
entirely bound to such a new Power, as ever I was to the most
Legal Prince.</p>
            <p>Thus far the Laws of Nature go towards making a Legal King,
and this is confirmed by the Laws of Nations, which are no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing
else but received Customs and Usages, agreeable to the
Laws of Nature, and right Reason: Now though different Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions
have different Laws of Succession to the Crown, yet they
<pb n="16" facs="tcp:50779:10"/>
seem all to agree in this, That he is the King, who is in posses<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sion
of the Throne, with the consent and submission of the
People. The consent and submission of the People, turn that,
which was originally no more but Force, into a Civil and Le<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gal
Authority, by giving themselves up to the Government of
the Prince.</p>
            <p>By this means Kingdoms and Empires are transferred, and
Princes gain a Right to those Thrones, to which they had no
antecedent Right. When God intends to pull down one King,
and set up another, he gives success to the rising Prince, puts the
Nation into his hands, and so orders it, that by Force and Pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er,
or other Arts, he obtains their consent and submission, and
then he is their King, and is invested with God's Authority; e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>specially
when he is visibly setled in the Throne by the united
strength and power of the Kingdom.</p>
            <p>Upon these terms, I suppose, our <hi>Author</hi> and I may very well
agree; that the <hi>Convocation</hi> does allow such Governments, as
were begun by wicked means, when they <hi>are throughly setled</hi> to
become legal and rightful Powers, not by the Laws of the Land,
but by the consent and submission of the People, and the Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thority
of God, wherewith they are invested: This I owned
before, that the distinction between Kings <hi>de Iure,</hi> and <hi>de Facto,</hi>
related only to the Laws of the Land, for upon other accounts,
those Kings who are set up by God, and have his Authority, are
rightful Kings; that is, so rightful, that our Obedience is due to
them.</p>
            <p>But this is all shuffling and playing with words; for the single
Question is, Whether the <hi>Convocation</hi> by, <hi>throughly setled,</hi> means,
that such Governments as are begun by Usurpation or Rebelli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on,
or other wicked means, cannot be <hi>throughly setled,</hi> till they
acquire a legal Right by the Laws of the Land; which he says
must be by the death or cession of the rightful King, or by a
long Prescription: now this I say, the <hi>Convocation</hi> could not
mean, as appears by the Instances they give of such Powers.
For the <hi>Aramites</hi> and <hi>Moabites</hi> could never, by the Constitution
of the <hi>Iewish</hi> Commonwealth, be the legal and rightful Kings
of <hi>Israel:</hi> and a Common-wealth where there is a perpetual
Succession of Persons in whom the ordinary Power resides, can
never die, nor lose their claim to that Power, which is given them
by God, though they might submit when under Force; so that
here was neither <hi>Death</hi> nor <hi>Cession,</hi> and they were far from having
<pb n="17" facs="tcp:50779:10"/>
such a <hi>Prescription,</hi> as our <hi>Author</hi> makes necessary to give such Pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers
a Legal Right, and this answers all his other instances, where
he argues only from the term <hi>lawful.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Now if submission in such Cases will give a Right to our Obe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dience
in contradiction to the Laws of the Land; that which ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stified
the submission of <hi>Israel,</hi> will justifie the submission of any o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
People to a prevailing Power, and will give such Powers as
good a Right, as the <hi>Aramites</hi> and <hi>Moabites</hi> could challenge to <hi>Israel.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>All that can be said here, I think, is this: That by submission,
which gives a legal Right,<note place="margin">Answ. <hi>p.</hi> 5.</note> our <hi>Author</hi> means <hi>the submission and ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>knowledgment
of those in whom the Right is:</hi> That is to say, the sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mission
of the People does not give a legal Right, but the submission
of the King does.</p>
            <p>1. But for answer to this, in the first place I desire to know,
what submission of the King it is, that gives a legal Right? Is
swearing Allegiance a submission and acknowledgment? What be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>came
then of the Right of the House of <hi>York,</hi> when the <hi>Duke</hi> of
<hi>York</hi> swore Allegiance to <hi>Henry IV.?</hi> is yielding to Force and
Power, quitting the Administration of the Government, and lea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving
the Throne, tho' with an intention to recover it again, when
he can, a submission? If it be, does not a King so far submit, when
he leaves his Country, without any legal Authority of Govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment,
and leaves his People in the hands of a prevailing Prince?
Is not this as much a submission, as if he had stayed at home, and
laid aside his Crown, and submitted to a private Life, without re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nouncing
his Right and future Claim; but if nothing be a submis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sion,
but renouncing his Right, and making a formal Resignation
and Conveyance of Power, I desire to know, how our <hi>Author</hi> will
prove, that the <hi>Israelites</hi> thus submitted to the <hi>Aramites</hi> and <hi>Moa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bites?</hi>
Or what other submission they made, but a bare yielding
to Force and Power? What other submission did the King, and
Princes, and People of <hi>Iudah</hi> make to the King of <hi>Babylon,</hi> when
they were carried away Captives to <hi>Babylon?</hi> And yet their sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mission
our <hi>Author</hi> confesses gave a legal Right.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>2dly,</hi> Can the submission of the King give a legal Right to the
Crown, without the submission of the People? If not, it seems the
People may have some right, if not to Government, yet to give a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>way
the Government of themselves. If the consent and submissi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
of a People can make a King, when they have none, why can
it not do so, when they are under a new Force and Power, which
is the same state, as if they had no King? for Power has an imme<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diate
effect, and will admit of no delays.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="18" facs="tcp:50779:11"/>
               <hi>3ly,</hi> Cannot every private Man, or any City or Garrison, when
they are overpowered, and cannot be relieved by their Prince, sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mit
for themselves to the Conqueror, without the submission of
their Kings? and do they not by such a submission, according to
the Laws of Nations, become the Subjects of the Conquerour, till
they are retaken? And why cannot a whole Nation in the same
circumstances do the same thing, though the King has escaped, and
does not, and will not submit to the Conqueror?</p>
            <p>
               <hi>4ly,</hi> For has a Nation no Right, when the King is gone,
to preserve themselves by making the best terms they can with
the new Powers? Must they ask leave of their Prince, whether
they shall continue a Nation, when he is gone? Whether they
shall submit to a new Prince, when he can protect them no longer?
All Mankind have this natural Right to submit for their own pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>servation,
and need ask no Princes leave to do it.</p>
            <p>I urge all this onely to shew, that there are such Cases, wherein
Subjects may submit without the submission of their Prince, and
when they do so, it gives that Prince a Right to govern them;
for they have made themselves his Subjects, and if the Case is such,
wherein they might lawfully do it, they confer a lawful Right,
though they cannot extinguish their former King's Claim by it, who
has not submitted.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>5ly,</hi> For what will our <hi>Author</hi> say to the submission of <hi>Iaddus</hi>
and the <hi>Iews</hi> to <hi>Alexander,</hi> while <hi>Darius</hi> was living, whose Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jects
they were, and who had not submitted? and yet they assert,
that by this means <hi>Alexander</hi> gained a lawful Authority over them,
and that they owed all the Duty and Obedience to <hi>Alexander,</hi>
which they formerly had done to the Kings of <hi>Babylon</hi> and <hi>Persia,
(Can.</hi> 31. pag. 67.) and then according to this <hi>Convocation</hi> the sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mission
of Subjects, without the submission of the King, gives a
lawful Authority.</p>
            <p>Our <hi>Author</hi> is much troubled about this Story of <hi>Iaddus</hi> and <hi>A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lexander,</hi>
               <note place="margin">
                  <hi>Answer,</hi> p. 3, 4, 5, 6, &amp;c.</note>
and spends several Pages to confute <hi>Iosephus,</hi> who is the
only Relator of it. I will not engage in this Quarrel, the Vindi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cation
of <hi>Iosephus</hi> as to this Story, being undertaken by a more
learned Pen, as I suppose our Author will know, before he will
see this. But this I must say, that if they part with this Story,
they lose so glorious a Testimony (as they used to account it) to
the indispensable obligation of an Oath of Allegiance, while the
King to whom we have sworn Allegiance lives, whether he be in
possession or out of it, that they will not find the like again in any
<pb n="19" facs="tcp:50779:11"/>
Records of Time: but it seems they are sensible <hi>Iaddus</hi> confuted their
sense of it himself, by submitting to <hi>Alexander,</hi> notwithstanding his
Oath of Allegiance, while <hi>Darius</hi> was living, and now they are willing
to part with it.</p>
            <p>Well,<note place="margin">
                  <hi>Ibid.</hi> p. 11.</note> but as he himself observes; the Dispute is not, whether the
Story be true or false, but whether the <hi>Convocation</hi> believed it: for if
they believed the Story true, by their Judgment on the case, we may
know what their sense was about this matter.</p>
            <p>This he grants, but <hi>says likewise, That their sense is not to be extended
beyond their words;</hi> and this I grant: <hi>nor are they to be made parties to
any more of the story, than they have inserted in their Book.</hi> But this I
deny; for if they believed any of the Story upon <hi>Iosephus</hi>'s Authority,
by the same reason they must believe all; and if they pass their
Judgment on a matter of fact, such wise Men ought to be presumed
to judge upon the whole matter of fact; especially when different cir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cumstances
will alter the nature of the Action.</p>
            <p>According to our <hi>Author</hi>'s Opinion, it makes a great difference in
<hi>Iaddus</hi>'s submission to <hi>Alexander,</hi> whether <hi>Darius</hi> were living or dead:
And can we think such wise Men as made up that <hi>Convocation,</hi> should
not consider this? though, as he says, they take no notice of it: And
if they did consider it, and took their Story from <hi>Iosephus,</hi> (and it
seems by him, they could have it from no other <hi>Author)</hi> it is plain,
they must believe <hi>Darius</hi> to be living, when <hi>Iaddus,</hi> who was his
Subject, and had sworn Allegiance to him, notwithstanding this sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitted
to <hi>Alexander:</hi> which shews what their Opinion was, That Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jects,
who had sworn Allegiance to their Prince, might yet, when un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der
Force, as <hi>Iaddus</hi> was, become the Subjects of another prevailing
Prince.</p>
            <p>What he mentions concerning <hi>Iaddus</hi>'s Answer to <hi>Alexander,</hi> I an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>swered
before in <hi>The Case of Allegiance,</hi> p. 8. and he has not thought
fit to make any Reply to it.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>But he adds,</hi>
               <note place="margin">
                  <hi>Ibid.</hi> p. 12.</note> Granting the Story true, it is not to the purpose, it is urged
for: <hi>that is, it will not justifie a Subject under an Oath of Allegiance
to submit to another Prince, while his own King is living; and his
reason for it is this: Josephus</hi> tells us, That God appeared to <hi>Jaddus</hi> in a
Dream, and warned him to submit to <hi>Alexander,</hi> and to meet him in that
solemn manner he did: so that this is a singular and exempt Case, and falls
within the circumstances of <hi>Iehu</hi> and <hi>Ahud.</hi>âIt was always the Cu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stom
in the <hi>Jewish</hi> Church, in Cases of great extremity and emergency, to
have recourse to God for some express Revelation, what they should do. And
here <hi>Josephus</hi> tells us, were all the Preparations to it: they fasted and prayed,
<pb n="20" facs="tcp:50779:12"/>
and the next Night God appeared to <hi>Jaddus,</hi> (however, as we have the Story
from <hi>Josephus,</hi> so we must take all from him, and he tells expresly that God
appeared to him) and ordered him so to do, and God's appearing and Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mand
stands upon the same Authority with all the rest of the Story. And
then it is wholly besides the purpose it is alledged for: For there is a wide dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ference
between acting by common and standing Rules, and by express Revela<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion.
And if these Gentlemen will shew us any express Revelation for what
they do, as <hi>Jaddus</hi> had, then they say something; but till they can shew
that, this Example of <hi>Jaddus,</hi> if it were true, will do them no service.</p>
            <p>We are now disputing about the sense of the <hi>Convocation,</hi> and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
must remember, that the <hi>Convocation</hi> does not assign this reason,
why <hi>Iaddus,</hi> after his Oath to <hi>Darius, submitted</hi> to <hi>Alexander;</hi> for they
make no doubt at all about the lawfulness of his submission, and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
never inquire into the reason of it, which they thought visible e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nough
in the force he was under. But I will take no advantage of this,
if he will but remember it, when we come to the Case of <hi>Iehoiada</hi> and
<hi>Athaliah.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>But the Answer to all this is plain: For as <hi>Iosephus</hi> tells the Story,
<hi>Iaddus</hi> never questioned, whether it were lawful for him to submit
to <hi>Alexander,</hi> when he was coming with a great Force to <hi>Ierusalem;</hi>
but his care was, how he might atone for his former contumacy, by
an early submission; and the Prayers and Sacrifices he commanded the
People to offer,<note place="margin">
                  <hi>Ioseph.</hi> l. 11. cap. 8.</note> were not to beg God's direction, whether he should
submit to <hi>Alexander</hi> or not, for that he was determined to do, but
that God would be favourable to his People, and deliver them from
the imminent danger they were in, from a provoked Conquerour;
and when God is said to appear to him in his Dream, he answered
no question about the lawfulness of <hi>submitting</hi> to <hi>Alexander,</hi> but direct<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
him, how to do it in such a manner, as should prevent the threatned
danger: that he should appear in his Pontificial Attire, in which, it
seems, God himself had formerly appeared to <hi>Alexander,</hi> and promised
him success over the <hi>Persians,</hi> by which <hi>Alexander</hi> knew, that he was
the Priest of that God, to whom he owed his Victories, and this
made him worship the High Priest, and shew all kindness to the <hi>Iewish</hi>
Nation. So that <hi>Iaddus</hi> had no Revelation of the lawfulness of <hi>sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitting</hi>
to <hi>Alexander,</hi> nor have we need of any; but we have the
Judgment of the <hi>Convocation</hi> upon this, which they intended as <hi>a
common and standing Rule.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>But the great instance our <hi>Author</hi> depends on, and doubts not to
carry the Cause by it, is the Case of <hi>Ioash</hi> and <hi>Athaliah.</hi> The Story
as it is related by the <hi>Convocation</hi> is this:</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="21" facs="tcp:50779:12"/>
               <q>After the death of <hi>Abaziah</hi> King of <hi>Iudah,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">
                     <hi>Convocat.</hi> ch. 23. p. 41.</note> his Mother <hi>Athaliah</hi>
finding his Children all to be very young, kill'd them all but the young<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>est,
and reigned by Usurpation six Years over the Land. The said
youngest Child (whose name was <hi>Ioash)</hi> was secretly conveyed away
by his Aunt <hi>Iehosabeth,</hi> his Father's Sister, and Wife to <hi>Iehoiada</hi> the
High-Priest; who kept him so secretly in the Temple, as that <hi>Atha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liah</hi>
the Usurper could never hear of him. Now after the said six
Years that <hi>Ioash,</hi> the true and natural Heir apparent to the Crown,
had been so brought up, he the said <hi>Iehoiada,</hi> being the King's Uncle,
and the chief Head or Prince of his Tribe, sent through <hi>Iudah</hi> for
the <hi>Levites</hi> and chief Fathers both of <hi>Iudah</hi> and <hi>Benjamin,</hi> to come
unto him to <hi>Ierusalem;</hi> who accordingly repairing thither, and be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
made acquainted by him with the Preservation of their Prince,
(as is aforesaid) and <hi>that it was the Lord's will that he should reign over
them;</hi> they altogether, by a Covenant, acknowledged their Allegi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance
unto him, as unto their lawful King; and so disposed of things,
as presently after he was Crowned and Anointed; which dutiful
Office of Subjects being performed, they apprehended the Usurper <hi>A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thaliah</hi>
and shew her, as before it was by the said States resolved. In
all the Process of which Action nothing was done, either by <hi>Iehoi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ada</hi>
the High-Priest, or by the rest of the Princes or People of <hi>Iu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dah</hi>
and <hi>Benjamin,</hi> which God himself did not require at their hands.
<hi>Ioash</hi> their late King's Son being then their only natural Lord and
Soveraign, although <hi>Athaliah</hi> kept him six Years from the Possession
of his Kingdom.</q>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>This is the Story, and their</hi> Canon <hi>upon it is this:</hi> If any Man there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
shall affirm, either that <hi>Athaliah</hi> did well, in murthering her Son's Chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren,
or that <hi>Jehoiada</hi> and his Wife did amiss in preserving the life of their
King <hi>Joash;</hi> or that <hi>Athaliah</hi> was not a Tyrannical Usurper, (the right Heir
of that Kingdom being alive) or that it was neither lawful for <hi>Jehoiada,</hi> and

of his Crown, to have joyned together for the overthrowing of <hi>Athaliah</hi>

Priest, both to inform the Princes and People of the Lord's Promise, that <hi>Jo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ash</hi>
should Reign over them, and likewise Anoint him, or that this Fact either
of the Princes, Priests, or People was to be held for a lawful Warrant, for any
afterward, either Princes, Priests or People to have deposed any of the Kings
of <hi>Judah,</hi> who by right of Succession came to their Crowns, or to have killed
them for any respect whatsoever, and to have set another in their places, ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording

thing else in the Old Testament did give then to the High-Priest any Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thority
to Dispute, Determine, or Iudge, whether the Children of the Kings
of <hi>Judah</hi> should either be kept from the Crown, because their Fathers were Ido<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lators,
or being in Possession of it, should be deposed from it in that respect, or in
any other respect whatsoever, he doth greatly err. <hi>I have transcribed this,
because we must have a little dispute about it, and it was fitting the
Reader should have both the Story and the Canon before him.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>Our</hi> Author'<hi>s Argument from this Story is this:</hi>
               <note place="margin">
                  <hi>Answer,</hi> p. 17.</note> It is plain the Convo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cation
does not conceive, that the Enjoyment of the Crown with all its Digni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties,
<hi>&amp;c.</hi> is that thorough Settlement, to which is due Subjection and Obe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dience
as to God's Authority. <hi>Athaliah</hi> personally enjoyed the Crown with
all its Dignities, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> and all Places of Trust and Power, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> were in her
hands, and at her disposal, and this also for no less a time than six Years, and
in as full and ample a manner, as any Usurper, or any rightful King ever
enjoyed them: but for all that the Convocation is so far from urging Obedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence
to her, as to God's Authority, that they expresly justifie the resisting, nay,
the slaying her. And this is a clear Demonstration, that by a thorough Set<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tlement
the Convocation does not mean a full Possession of Power meerly: for
they say, when a Government is fully settled, it ought to be obeyed, as God's
Authority, not only for Fear, but for Conscience sake: But they say also, that
when <hi>Athaliah</hi> was fully possessed of the Throne, she ought not to be obeyed,
but to be resisted and slain. And the Conclusion from these Premises is, That
to be fully possessed of the Throne, is not of it self to be so throughly settled as
to make it God's Authority, and Obedience to become a Duty.</p>
            <p>Now it were sufficient here to observe, that he has not given the
true Notion of <hi>a full and settled Possession;</hi> for he has left out the prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cipal
part of it, as I state it, <hi>viz. When the Estates of the Realm, and the
Great Body of the Nation has submitted to such a Prince:</hi> Which in the
Case of <hi>Antiochus</hi> is one thing,<note place="margin">
                  <hi>Convocat.</hi> p. 69.</note> the <hi>Convocation</hi> expresly makes necessa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry
to a thorough Settlement, <hi>The Government of that Tyrant</hi> (Antiochus)
<hi>being not then either generally received by Submission, nor setled by Continu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance:</hi>
though I cannot blame him for this, because the Author, whom
he answers, took no notice of it; but I must blame him for affirm<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing,
that the <hi>Convocation</hi> say, <hi>That when</hi> Athaliah <hi>was fully possessed of
the Throne, she ought not to be obeyed, but to be resisted and slain:</hi> for they
say no such thing, and though he may imagine this to be the Conse<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quence
of what they say, he ought not therefore to affirm, that they
said it, because he may mistake in his Consequence, and that he has
done so, shall presently appear:</p>
            <p>The <hi>Convocation</hi> says not one word of the thorough Settlement of
<hi>Athaliah</hi> in the Throne; but if we may learn the Sence of the <hi>Convo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cation</hi>
               <pb n="23" facs="tcp:50779:13"/>
(as this <hi>Author</hi> concludes we may) from what Bishop <hi>Buckridge,</hi>
               <note place="margin">
                  <hi>Answer,</hi> p. 27.</note>
a Member of that <hi>Convocation,</hi> has written in his Defence of <hi>Barclay,</hi>
they did not think her settled in the Throne: for when <hi>Bellarmin</hi> had
objected the quiet Possession of <hi>Athaliah</hi> for six Years, the <hi>Bishop,</hi> as
this <hi>Author</hi> cites him, answers, <hi>How quiet soever it was, it was violent,
for she was guarded with Souldiers;</hi> and affirms, that Athaliah <hi>had not
acquired a Right to the Crown,</hi> (I suppose he means only such a Right
as <hi>a thorough Settlement</hi> gives) <hi>neither by the Consent of the People, nor by
the Prescription of six Years:</hi> Six Years were not long enough for a Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>scription,
which he says must be a hundred Years; and the Consent
of the People, it seems, she had not, and therefore <hi>being a meer Usurper,
and no Queen, she might be Deposed.</hi> And thus his whole Argument is
lost. And here I must observe, that the <hi>Bishop</hi> allows, as the <hi>Convoca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion</hi>
does, that either the <hi>Consent of the People,</hi> or <hi>a long Prescription</hi> gives
a Right; that is, such a Right as makes Obedience due to Princes
thus settled without a legal Title: and therefore our <hi>Author</hi> greatly
prevaricates, when he pretends to give the <hi>Bishop's sence of a thorough
Settlement; that is, when a Right to the Government is acquired by a Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>scription,
and that is a long and uninterrupted Possession, joyned with the Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sent
of the People.</hi> The <hi>Bishop</hi> distinguishes between the <hi>Consent</hi> of the
People, and a long <hi>Prescription,</hi> and says that either of them will give
a Right: And our <hi>Author,</hi> though he pretends to give the <hi>Bishop's</hi>
sence, makes both of them together necessary to give a Right, <hi>a long
and uninterrupted Possession,</hi> which is what the <hi>Bishop</hi> calls <hi>Prescription,
joyned with the Consent of the People;</hi> so that he leaves out <hi>neither</hi> and
<hi>nor</hi> as insignificant Particles, and likes <hi>with</hi> better, as more agreeable
to his Design: and at this rate he may make <hi>Convocations</hi> and <hi>Bishops</hi>
speak his sence, when he pleases.</p>
            <p>But to gratifie our <hi>Author,</hi> let us suppose the <hi>Convocation</hi> did own <hi>A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thaliah</hi>
to have been as <hi>throughly settled</hi> on the Throne, as any Usurper
can be, while the right Heir is living; and then the Consequence is,
That the <hi>Convocation</hi> teaches that Kings and Queens <hi>de Facto,</hi> who
have all the Settlement that can be had without Right, may be Deposed
and Murthered by their Subjects: And will this <hi>Author</hi> say, that this
is the Doctrine of the <hi>Convocation?</hi> Do they not expresly warn us a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainst
believing any Person who <hi>shall affirm by all the Arguments which
Wit or Learning could devise,</hi>
               <note place="margin">Convocat. Car. 27<g ref="char:punc">âª</g> 26 <hi>p.</hi> 55.</note> 
               <hi>that God had called him to Murther the King</hi>
de Facto, <hi>under whom he lived?</hi>
            </p>
            <p>It seems then the <hi>Convocation</hi> made a great difference between the
Case of <hi>Athaliah,</hi> and other Kings <hi>de Facto,</hi> who had no better
Title, nor more thorough Settlement than she had, (if they thought
<pb n="24" facs="tcp:50779:14"/>
her settled in the Throne, without which Supposition our <hi>Author's</hi> Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gument
is lost) for they justifie the killing <hi>Athaliah,</hi>
               <note place="margin">Case of Al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>legiance, <hi>p.</hi> 34, 35.</note> and condemn the
murder of a King <hi>de Facto;</hi> and this I gave two accounts of in my
<hi>Case of Allegiance.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>1. All that this Story amounts to is no more than this: <q>That when
the legal and rightful Heir is actually possessed of his Throne, Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jects
may return to their Allegiance, and by the Authority of their
King prosecute the Usurper; for <hi>Ioash</hi> was first Anointed and Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>claimed,
before any one stirred a finger against <hi>Athaliah;</hi> now this
is a very different Case from raising a Rebellion against a Prince,
who is in possession of the Throne, to restore an Ejected Prince.</q>
            </p>
            <p>2. <q>But this was a peculiar Case; for God himself had Entailed
the Kingdom of <hi>Iudah</hi> on the Posterity of <hi>David;</hi> and therefore no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing
could justifie their Submission to an Usurper, when the King's
Son was found, to whom the Kingdom did belong by a Divine En<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tail:<note place="margin">1 Chr. 23. 5.</note>
and by this <hi>Iehoiada</hi> justifies what he did, <hi>Behold the King's son
shall reign, as the Lord hath said of the sons of David.</hi> Now when God
has Entailed the Crown by an express Declaration of his Will, and
Nomination of the Person or Family that shall Reign, (as it was in
the Kingdom of <hi>Iudah)</hi> Subjects are bound to adhere to their Prince
of God's chusing, when he is known, and to persecute all Usurpers
to the utmost, and never submit to their Government: But in other
Kingdoms, where God makes Kings and Entailes the Crown, not
by express Nomination, but by his Providence, the placing a Prince
in the Throne, and settling him there in the full Administration of
the Government, is a reason to submit to him, as to God's Ordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nance.</q>
            </p>
            <p>This our <hi>Author</hi> answers with great Triumph in his Postscript, <hi>(p.
4, 5.)</hi> but with how much Reason, I shall now examine; and I must
begin with his Answer to the second:</p>
            <p>
               <hi>This Distinction,</hi> (That God himself had Entailed the Kingdom of
<hi>Iudah</hi> upon <hi>David</hi>'s Posterity) he says, <hi>is not in the Convocation Book,
and so does not affect their Sence:</hi> I grant it, and therefore did not con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cern
the <hi>Convocation-Book</hi> in the Story, nor make any mention of it;
but only raised this Objection from the Story, and gave that Answer
to it, by which <hi>Iehoiada</hi> the High-Priest justified what he did: For
tho' the <hi>Convocation</hi> takes notice of this Story, yet they neither make
nor answer this Objection in direct Terms: They had another De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sign
in mentioning it, and fitted their Answers wholly to that, <hi>viz.</hi> to
prove against the <hi>Papists,</hi>
               <note place="margin">
                  <hi>Convocat.</hi> ch. 23. p. 41.</note> That <hi>no Priest in the Old Testament did ever
Depose from their Crowns any of their Kings, how wicked soever, or had a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny
<pb n="25" facs="tcp:50779:14"/>
Authority so to do.</hi> And because this Example of <hi>Iehoiada</hi> used to
be urged by them to this purpose, they shew that no such thing can be
proved from it.</p>
            <p>But tho' the <hi>Convocation</hi> does not answer a Question which they
never proposed, yet this is a good Answer to it, and agreeable to the
Sence of the <hi>Convocation</hi> in that place: for they take notice, that <hi>Ie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hoiada,</hi>
when he had sent <hi>to the Levites, and chief Fathers both of</hi> Judah
<hi>and</hi> Benjamin, <hi>acquainted them with the Preservation of their Prince, and
that it was the Lord's will, that he should Reign over them;</hi> which plain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
refers to that Divine Entail of the Crown upon <hi>David</hi>'s Posterity;
as <hi>Iehoiada</hi> expresly told them, <hi>Behold the King's son shall reign, as the
Lord hath said of the sons of David.</hi> So that it is evident, the <hi>Convoca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion</hi>
itself answers the Difficulties of this Story by the Divine Entail;
and it is as true and proper an Answer to that Question, Whether we
may Murther a King <hi>de Facto,</hi> to place the right Heir on his Throne,
since <hi>Iohoiada</hi> anointed <hi>Ioash</hi> and slew <hi>Athaliah?</hi> To say, That the Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vine
Entail of the Crown made a vast difference between the Case of
<hi>Athaliah</hi> and other Kings <hi>de Facto,</hi> who are settled in their Thrones;
as it is to that Question, Whether the High-Priest have not Authori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty
to Depose one King, and set up another, since <hi>Iehoiada</hi> actually did
so, anointed <hi>Ioash</hi> and killed <hi>Athaliah?</hi> To say, that this was done
not by any ordinary Jurisdiction, which the High-Priest had over
Kings, but in Obedience to God, who had Entailed the Crown on <hi>Da<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vid</hi>'s
Posterity.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>He proceeds,</hi> They do no not speak of this, when they call <hi>Athaliah</hi> an
Usurper, and justifie the Proceedings of <hi>Jehoiada</hi> and the People against her;
but the reason they give is general, The right Heir of the Kingdom being a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>live,
which extends to all Kingdoms, that are Entailed, and go by Succession.</p>
            <p>This <hi>Author,</hi> who would confine me so strictly to the Sence of the
<hi>Convocation,</hi> even where I don't appeal to it, makes very bold with the
<hi>Convocation</hi> himself: For they do not offer to justifie the Proceedings
of <hi>Iehoiada</hi> and the People against <hi>Athaliah,</hi> by saying, <hi>That the right
Heir of the Kingdom was alive;</hi> but only prove by this, that she was an
Usurper who had no legal Right to the Throne, the right Heir being
living: But if our <hi>Author</hi> will think again, I presume, he will own,
that they are two very different Questions, Whether such a Prince be
an Usurper; and whether he may be Deposed and Murthered? The
<hi>Convocation</hi> I'm sure makes them two Questions, when they will not
allow of the Murder of a King <hi>de Facto.</hi> But on the other hand, the
<hi>Convocation</hi> justifies <hi>Iehoiada</hi> from the express Command of God:<note place="margin">p. 24, 25.</note> 
               <hi>In
all the process of which Action nothing was done, either by</hi> Jehoiada <hi>the
<pb n="26" facs="tcp:50779:15"/>
High-Priest, or by the rest of the Princes and People of</hi> Judah <hi>and</hi> Benjamin,
<hi>which God himself did not require at their hands;</hi> Joash <hi>their late King's
Son being then their only natural Lord and Soveraign, although</hi> Athaliah
<hi>kept him for six Years from the Possession of his Kingdom.</hi> How did God
himself require this at their hands? Was it only by the Principles of
Reason and Natural Justice, in setting the right Heir upon the Throne?
No; by its being <hi>God's Will,</hi> and <hi>God's requiring it at their hands,</hi> they
plainly mean, GOD's entailing the Crown upon <hi>David</hi>'s Posterity,
which made it the Duty <hi>of</hi> Jehoiada, <hi>and the rest of the Princes, Levites
and People, to yeild their Subjection to their lawful King; and having done
so, and their King being in possession of the Throne, to joyn together for the o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verthrowing
of</hi> Athaliah <hi>the Usurper; and that</hi> Jehoiada, <hi>the High Priest,
was bound as he was a Priest, to inform the Princes and People, of the Lord's
purpose,</hi> (which can refer only to this Entail) <hi>that</hi> Jehoiada <hi>should Reign o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver
them, and likewise to Anoint him.</hi> Which contains a particular Ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stification
of all that was done; and all resolved into the Will and
Purpose of God, that <hi>Ioash</hi> should Reign; which was no otherwise
declared, but by God's Entailing the Kingdom upon the Posterity of
<hi>David.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>It was the Duty <hi>of</hi> Jehoiada <hi>and the rest of the Princes,</hi> &amp;c. <hi>to yeild
Subjection to their lawful King,</hi> who was Heir by Succession; for that
they expresly make equivalent in the Kingdom of <hi>Iudah to being Elect<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
and Named by God himself,</hi> (Can. 17. p. 28.) And therefore <hi>Ch. 19.
p.</hi> 30. affirm, That they should receive such Kings <hi>as sent to them by
God himself;</hi> which proves, that this cannot extend to Heirs meerly
by Humane Succession, which is not equivalent to God's Nomination.
<hi>Iehoiada sent thro'</hi> Judah <hi>for the Levites, and chief Fathers both of</hi> Judah
<hi>and</hi> Benjamin, <hi>to come to him to</hi> Jerusalem, (Ch. 23. p. 41.) and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>he
discovers the King's Son to them. Thus the <hi>Convocation</hi> says by the
Constitution of that Government it ought to be, that the Prince,
whom God had appointed, should be made known to the People,
and they should chearfully submit to him. <hi>(Ch. 17. p. 27.)</hi> and they
add, <hi>Afterwards also the like course was held upon the Death of every King,
to make his Successor known to the People.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Iehoiada, <hi>who was High Priest, gave this notice to the People, and
took a Covenant of them, and Anointed their King; and this also
the</hi> Convocation <hi>says was his Duty:</hi> As we have said of the People, That
when the Kings of <hi>Judah</hi> were to succeed one another, their Duty was to come
together with Ioy and Gladness, to receive them for their Kings, (as sent to
them by God himself) and accordingly to submit themselves unto their Autho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity
and Government: So at such times the Priests for the most part, besides
<pb n="27" facs="tcp:50779:15"/>
their general Duties, as Subjects, had some further Service to be then by them
performed; the parts of which Service are all of them manifest in the Ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vancement
of King <hi>Solomon</hi> to the Royal Throne of his Father <hi>David;</hi>
where the Priests, by King <hi>David</hi>'s direction, did give Thanks to God, and
prayer for King <hi>Solomon</hi>âand <hi>Zadock</hi> the High-Priest did himself A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>noint
him. <hi>I suppose our</hi> Author <hi>may by this time be satisfied, that
the</hi> Convocation <hi>resolves all into the Authority of a Divine Entail, and
makes a great difference between a Divine and Humane Entail.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>He adds, <q>And it is plain, they thought of no such Difference as
to this Matter; but that a thorough Settlement of a Government
(and though attained by the same ill means) was the same thing, and
had God's Authority in <hi>Iudah</hi> as well as any other Nation; as in the
instances of the <hi>Babylonians, Macedonians,</hi> and <hi>Romans,</hi> whose Govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
over the <hi>Iews</hi> was not attained by honester Means than <hi>Atha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liah</hi>'s,
and was as much contrary to the Entail upon <hi>David</hi>'s House,
as hers; and yet they justifie and require Obedience to them, but
justifie the slaying her: And therefore it is plain, that by a thorough
Settlement they do not mean a full Possession of Power in the King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom
of <hi>Iudah,</hi> as had the <hi>Babylonians, Macedonians,</hi> or <hi>Romans,</hi> nor
do they reckon God's Entail upon <hi>David</hi>'s Posterity any ground of
difference in this Matter, for the Government of <hi>Iudah</hi> by the <hi>Ba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bylonias,</hi>
was as much contrary to that Entail, as the Government of
<hi>Athaliah.</hi>
               </q>
            </p>
            <p>Now all this is answered in one word, from what I have before di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>scoursed:
The Entail God made upon <hi>David</hi>'s Posterity, did always
oblige the <hi>Iews,</hi> when they were at their own Choice, and had Pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er
enough to take the King, on whom God had entailed the Crown;
which was evidently their Case when <hi>Iehoiada</hi> anointed <hi>Ioash,</hi> and
slew <hi>Athaliah;</hi> but when they were under Force, (as they were un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der
the <hi>Babylonians, Macedonians,</hi> and <hi>Romans)</hi> no Entail, tho' made
by God himself could bind them; and then I hope it will be granted,
that no Humane Entails can bind any People, who are under Force,
if a Divine Entail can't do it.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>And thus our way is prepared to answer what he objects against the
first Account I gave of this Case of</hi> Athaliah, <hi>viz.</hi> That all that this
Story amounts to, is no more than this, That when the legal and rightful
Heir is actually possessed of his Throne, Subjects may return to their Allegi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance,
and by the Authority of their King prosecute the Usurper.</p>
            <p>Our <hi>Author</hi> answers,<note place="margin">
                  <hi>Postscript,</hi> p. 4.</note> 
               <hi>The Story amounts to a great deal more; and that
is, That Subjects may set the rightful Heir upon the Throne, altho' it be in
the actual possession of the Usurper; for so</hi> Iehoiada <hi>and the People did.</hi> It
<pb n="28" facs="tcp:50779:16"/>
is true, it does signifie something more with reference to <hi>Ioash,</hi> but I
had regard only to the Case of <hi>Athaliah;</hi> but yet it does not signifie
so generally, as he puts it; but it signifies only this, That Subjects
<hi>by the express Command and Authority of GOD</hi> (as the <hi>Convocation</hi>
teaches) may place the rightful Prince upon his Throne, though it be
possessed by an Usurper: And this will do our <hi>Author</hi> no service, for
it will not reach to all Hereditary Kings, but to those only of God's
Appointing and Nomination, or where God himself has made the En<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tail,
as it was in the Kingdom of <hi>Iudah.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>I shewed this was the Case here, that the rightful Heir was actually
possessed of the Throne;</hi> for <hi>Joash</hi> was first anointed and proclaimed, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
any one stirred a finger against <hi>Athaliah. To this he answers,</hi> But
is the Doctor sure, that <hi>Joash</hi> was actually possessed of the Throne? He was
anointed indeed, but is anointing actual possession? And it will not be easie to
prove it according to the Doctor's Notion of Possession, of having the whole
Administration of Affairs, and all the Authority of the Kingdom in his
hands.</p>
            <p>I reply: The <hi>Convocation</hi> arffims, That King <hi>Ioash was in possession
of his Crown,</hi> before <hi>Athaliah was slain;</hi> and I believe, if our <hi>Author</hi>
thinks of it again, he will confess, that <hi>Anointing</hi> gives actual Possession
to a rightful King, thÃ´ <hi>a thorough Settlement</hi> of his Government is ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cessary
to the full Possession of an Usurper: and the reason of this dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ference
is manifest; for where there is Right, nothing more is neces<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sary
to give Possession, but that Subjects actually own and recognize
that Right, and accept him for their King; for his Right makes their
Obedience a Duty, when he is in Possession, how weak and unsettled
soever his Government be: But when a Prince has no legal Right to
the Crown, nor consequently to the Obedience of his Subjects, it is
only a thorough Settlement, which makes Obedience a necessary
Duty.</p>
            <p>And yet if that will satisfie our <hi>Author,</hi> the whole Administration of
Affairs, and all the Authority of the Kingdom was then in <hi>Ioash</hi>'s hands,
and <hi>Athaliah</hi> had none of it: for all <hi>the Princes, and Levites, and People,</hi>
that is all who had the Administration of Affairs, and the Power of
the Kingdom in their hands, yeilded their Subjection to <hi>Ioash</hi> as to
their lawful King; and that put the whole Authority and Admini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stration
into his hands: and what Authority <hi>Athaliah</hi> had left, appear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
in her Tragical End.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>He proceeds:</hi> But howev<gap reason="illegible: missing" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>â¢</desc>
               </gap>r, who Anointed? and who Proclaimed him?
and who put him in Possession? Why truly no body else, but his own Subjects,
and those very Men that had lived six Years under the Usurper. And then I
<pb n="29" facs="tcp:50779:16"/>
perceive, that Subjects may stand by the rightful Heir against an Usurper,
though possessed of the Throne for some Years: But then where is that Fide<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lity,
Allegiance, and Obedience, that the Doctor says, we are bound to pay
to usurped Powers</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Answ.</hi> Truly just where it was before, in the <hi>Convocation Book,</hi>
and in the <hi>Scriptures,</hi> which requires our Subjection to the <hi>present
Powers,</hi> and in the reason and necessity of things; but this was an
exempt Case, upon account of a Divine Entail; and where God
himself has made the Entail, no Usurpation can cut it off, nor ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>solve
Subjects from their Duty to him, whom God himself has
made their King; but it is not so with humane Entails, of which
more presently.</p>
            <p>Now I said, that for Subjects to return to their Allegiance, and by
the Authority of their King to prosecute the Usurper, when the right<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful
Heir is actually possessed of his Throne, <hi>is a very different Case from
raising Rebellions against a Prince, who is in the possession of the Throne, to
restore an ejected Prince.</hi> To this he answers: <hi>Was not</hi> Athaliah <hi>in pos<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>session
of the Throne, when</hi> Jehoiada <hi>anointed</hi> Joash? I answer as I have
before done: She was in the actual and visible possession of the Throne,
but against a Divine Entail, and therefore her possession was a nullity,
and when they knew the King's Son was living, to whom by the Law
of God they were to submit, they were bound to look upon it as a
nullity, and not to consider her as their Queen; but this is not the
question; the question is, Whether <hi>Athaliah</hi> were possessed of the
Throne after <hi>Ioash</hi> was anointed, when <hi>Iehoiada</hi> gave Orders to kill
her: and that I suppose our <hi>Author</hi> will not say, that she was in pos<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>session
of the Throne, when the rightful Heir was actually possessed
of it.</p>
            <p>But, <hi>he says,</hi> the question is concerning Allegiance to an Usurper in the
possession of the Throne, and as to that there is no difference: For these pay as
little Allegiance to an Usurper, who anoint a King, and then depose him, as
those who do it to restore an ejected one: and I would fain know, what dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ference
there is (as to Allegiance to an Usurper) between anointing a new
King, and upon his Authority dispossessing an Usurper, and doing the same
thing upon the Authority of one already anointed.</p>
            <p>Now I grant, there is no difference between <hi>anointing a King, and
upon his Authority dispossessing an Usurper, and doing the same thing upon the
Authority of one already anointed,</hi> in such Cases wherein it is the Duty of
Subjects either to anoint a new King, or to restore an old anointed
King, in opposition to the Usurper, who is setled in the Throne;
<pb n="30" facs="tcp:50779:17"/>
but this is a Duty only, where the Usurpations, how <hi>thoroughly setled</hi>
soever it be, is against God's Entail, which was the peculiar Case of
<hi>Ioash;</hi> and yet even in this Case the <hi>Convocation</hi> thought it very con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>siderable,
that <hi>the Princes, Levites, and People, yielded Subjection to their
lawful King, and having so done, and their King being in possession of his
Throne, joyned together for the overthrowing of</hi> Athaliah <hi>the Usurper;</hi> if
the <hi>Convocation</hi> had not thought, that there was some difference be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween
killing <hi>Athaliah before</hi> or <hi>after</hi> the Anointing of <hi>Ioash,</hi> they would
not have laid so much stress upon the time, when she was slain; that
<hi>having so done, and their King being in possession of his Throne, they joyned
together for the overthrowing of</hi> Athaliah <hi>the Usurper.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>And I wonder our <hi>Author</hi> should perceive no difference between
these two: for though it had been the same thing to <hi>Athaliah,</hi> whether
she had been killed, <hi>before</hi> or <hi>after</hi> the Anointing of <hi>Ioash,</hi> yet it greatly
altered the nature of the fact; and that upon two accounts, both
with respect to the Authority, whereby it was done, and to the Cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>racter
of the Person, who suffered.</p>
            <p>The <hi>Convocation</hi> will not allow a private Man to kill a King <hi>de Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cto,</hi>
and that was the Case of the <hi>Iews</hi> during <hi>Athaliah</hi>'s Reign, before
<hi>Ioash</hi>'s Title was recognized, and he anointed, and placed on the
Throne; but when this was done, they had the visible and actual
Authority of their King, to slay the Usurper, which is a parallel Case
to that of <hi>Ahud</hi> and King <hi>Eglon.</hi> Before <hi>Ahud</hi> was made by God the
Judge and Saviour of his People, they teach, that it was unlawful for
him,<note place="margin">
                  <hi>Convocat.</hi> ch. 27. p. 52.</note> or any one else, to have killed King <hi>Eglon;</hi> but the Case was
altered, <hi>when God himself immediately had made him Iudge, and had gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven
him a full and absolute Authority, (independent upon any, but upon him
that gave it) to undertake any thing, that by God's direction appertained to
his place.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Thus whatever Authority <hi>Athaliah</hi> had before, when <hi>Ioash</hi> was a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nointed,
she sunk into the state of a Subject, and then to kill her, was
not to kill a Queen <hi>de Facto,</hi> but a Subject who had been an Usurper,
but now was a Subject again, and therefore no Fidelity, or Allegi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance
was due to her. This is the Case of <hi>Iehu,</hi> who was <hi>a Subject,</hi>
but commanded by God <hi>to be anointed King over</hi> Israel; <hi>and accordingly</hi>
Elizeus <hi>the Prophet caused</hi> Jehu <hi>to be anointed,</hi>
               <note place="margin">
                  <hi>Ibid.</hi> ch. 25. p. 46.</note> 
               <hi>and God's Message to be deli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vered
unto him; who presently upon the knowledge of God's Will, and the
submission of the Princes and Captains of</hi> Israel <hi>to him, as to their lawful
King, did put in execution the said Message, by killing</hi> Joram <hi>(before that
time his Soveraign,, but then his Subject),</hi> &amp;c. Now, I suppose, our <hi>Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thor</hi>
               <pb n="31" facs="tcp:50779:17"/>
will confess, that there is a difference between killing with Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thority,
and without; and between killing a Soveraign Prince,
and killing a Subject by the Authority of the Prince; and this was
the Case of <hi>Athaliah,</hi> when <hi>Ioash</hi> was anointed.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>The</hi> Convocation <hi>was very careful not to encourage Subjects to rise
up against their Prince, though he were but a King</hi> de Facto; <hi>and
therefore from these examples of</hi> Ahud <hi>and</hi> Iehu, <hi>expresly observe,
that</hi> God foreseeing in his heavenly Wisdom,<note place="margin">Ch. 27. p. 53.</note> and Divine Providence, what
mischief private Men, under the colour of these Examples, might otherwise
have pretended, or attempted against their Soveraigns (as being either discon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tented
of themselves, <hi>or set into</hi> some fury by other malitious Persons) he
did so order and dispose of all things, in the execution of these such his extra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ordinary
Iudgments; as that thereby it might plainly appear to any (that
should not wilfully hood-wink himself) never to be lawful for any Person
whatsoever, upon pretence of any Revelation, Inspiration, or Commandment
from his Divine Majesty, either to touch the Person of his Soveraign, or to bear
Arms against him; except God should first advance the said Person from his
private Estate, and make him a King, or an absolute Prince, to succeed his
late Master in his Kingdom or Principality.</p>
            <p>If our <hi>Author</hi> will not, yet I hope, all impartial Readers will think
this a sufficient Answer to the Case of <hi>Ioash</hi> and <hi>Athaliah.</hi> But how<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever
he will not give it over thus; but undertakes to prove, that <hi>my
Arguments will equally justifie submission to</hi> Athaliah <hi>in the Kingdom of</hi> Ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dah,<note place="margin">Postscript, <hi>p.</hi> 5.</note>
               <hi>notwithstanding such Entail, as to any Usurper in any other Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Well! and suppose he can prove it; what then? Did I ever deny
that it was lawful to submit to <hi>Athaliah,</hi> while she was possessed of the
Throne, and <hi>Ioash,</hi> the true Heir, concealed? Does he find in Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture,
that the Jews are condemned for submitting all this while to <hi>A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thaliah?</hi>
If any one should have been condemned for it, <hi>Iehoiada</hi> the
High-Priest was the Man, who knew that <hi>Ioash</hi> was living; and yet
for six Years together, while he thought fit to conceal this Secret,
he submitted himself to <hi>Athaliah,</hi> and acted under her Autho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity,
and neither blames himself, nor any of the Nation for doing
so.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Surely</hi> Iehoiada <hi>had not the same Notions of Loyalty, which our</hi>
Author <hi>has, for then he durst not have submitted to</hi> Athaliah, <hi>when
he knew</hi> Ioash <hi>was living, and was in his own keeping. For, (says
our Author) while</hi> the Government is as unjust as the Rebellion and En<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>croachment,<note place="margin">
                  <hi>Ibid.</hi> p. 3.</note>
a Man cannot justly become a Party to the Government, no more
than to the Rebellion, for they are both equally unjust; unless the stealing of a
<pb n="32" facs="tcp:50779:18"/>
Purse is very unjust; but the keeping it after it is stolen is very just.âHe
that partakes with Injustice (as he certainly does, that joyns with it) par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>takes
with the guilt too. And if the Power be unjust, then to abet, to defend,
support and maintain that Power, must be unjust likewise. <hi>And I add, to
do this for six Years is unjust likewise; and yet this</hi> Iehoiada <hi>did, and
is no where condemned for it.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>So that our <hi>Author</hi> mistakes the question: It is not enough for him
to prove, that my Arguments will justifie submission to <hi>Athaliah,</hi>
while she was in the possession of the Throne, and of the Power of
the Kingdom; for let the Entail be what it will, a Divine or Hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mane
Entail, it is always lawful to submit to Power; but the question
is, whether my Arguments give as irresistible Authority to <hi>Athaliah,</hi>
who usurped the Throne contrary to a Divine Entail, as they do to
other Kings <hi>de Facto,</hi> who are <hi>throughly setled</hi> in their Thrones, contra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry
to meer legal Rights, and humane Entailes; if they proved this,
I should confess my Arguments were naught, as proving too much;
but if they only justifie the present submission of the Jews to <hi>Athaliah,</hi>
while <hi>Ioash</hi> was concealed, and they thought all the King's Sons had
been cut off, I see no hurt in this: The Scripture does not condemn
them for it, and it is certain, they ought to be justified in it, and I
desire to know, how our <hi>Author</hi> will justifie them according to his
Principles.</p>
            <p>For we must observe, the <hi>Convocation</hi> does not meddle with that
question, when it becomes lawful to submit to usurped Powers, but
when it becomes our Duty: It is lawful to do it, when we are under
a Power, which we can't resist, but when such Usurped and Illegal
Powers are <hi>throughly setled,</hi> then it becomes <hi>our Duty</hi> to submit, and to
pay all that Obedience, which Subjects owe even to the most right<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful
Powers.</p>
            <p>Now we know, the general submission of the People is necessary
to a thorough settlement of such new Governments, and therefore if
such Governments may be setled without the sin of the Subjects, it
must be lawful in some Cases, to submit, before the Government be
setled; for the Government cannot be setled without their submissi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on:
but when the Government is setled by such submission, then
submission, which necessity justified before, becomes a Duty; and
those who would not submit at first, or might have refused to
do so without sin, when the Government is setled by a gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral
submission, are then bound in Conscience to submit them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="33" facs="tcp:50779:18"/>
The Question then between us is, or ought to be this, if he in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tends
to oppose me; Not whether the <hi>Iews</hi> might lawfully sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mit
to <hi>Athaliah,</hi> while she was possessed of the Throne, for this I
grant they might lawfully do; but whether they having sosubmitted,
and she being thoroughly setled in her Throne (for that our <hi>Author</hi>
will suppose) it were not as unlawful upon my Principles, for the
<hi>Iews</hi> to set up <hi>Ioash,</hi> and to kill <hi>Athaliah,</hi> as it is for any other Peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple
to Depose and Murther a King <hi>de facto,</hi> whose Government is
throughly setled among them. And here he takes notice of two
Arguments I make use of, <hi>the Argument from Providence, and from the
necessity of Government, for the preservation of human Societies,</hi> which, he
says, will equally serve <hi>Athaliah,</hi> as any other King or Queen <hi>de
facto;</hi> and if they will, I will give them up for lost.</p>
            <p>1. As for Providence;<note place="margin">
                  <hi>Postscript,</hi> p. 7.</note> the sum of all, he says, is this, That ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording
to my Principles, <hi>Athaliah</hi> was <hi>placed in the Throne by God,
by his Counsel, Decree, and Order, and peculiar Order;</hi> Well! I
must own it; for I know none but God, who can advance to the
Throne; and I know no more hurt in owning, that God exalted
<hi>Athaliah</hi> to the Throne, than that he exalted <hi>Baasha,</hi> who slew <hi>Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dab</hi>
the Son of <hi>Ieroboam,</hi> and Reigned in his stead; and yet God
himself, by his Prophet, tells <hi>Baasha, I exalted thee out of the dust, and
made thee Prince over my people Israel,</hi> 1 Kings 16. 2.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>And what does he prove from this?</hi> Now <hi>Athaliah (says he)</hi> had the
actual administration of Soveraign Power, and therefore according to the Doctor
she was Queen by God's Authority, tho' not by the Law of the Land; and Allegi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance
must be due to her, as well as to any other: And all the Doctor's Arguments
are as conclusive and valid for submission to <hi>Athaliah,</hi> as for submission to
any body else. <hi>Grant all this, and what then? Why then this justifies
the submission of the</hi> Iews <hi>to</hi> Athaliah, <hi>while she was possessed of the
Throne, and no rightful Heir appeared: And what hurt is there in
this? Will our</hi> Author <hi>condemn them for this submission? or does
the</hi> Scripture, <hi>or</hi> Convocation <hi>do it?</hi>
            </p>
            <p>If he would have concluded any thing to the purpose, he should
have said, <hi>And therefore it was unlawful for</hi> Jehoiada <hi>to have anointed</hi>
Joash, <hi>and to have killed</hi> Athaliah. But this he knew did not follow
from my Principles; for I expresly distinguish between God's ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king
Kings by <hi>a particular nomination,</hi>
               <note place="margin">Case of Al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>legiance, <hi>p.</hi> 11.</note> 
               <hi>as he made Kings in</hi> Jewry, <hi>and
entailed the Kingdom of</hi> Judah <hi>on</hi> David'<hi>s Posterity,</hi> and his making
Kings by his Providence, as he does in other Nations. Now what
I say about the Rights and Prerogatives of Kings advanced to the
Throne, and setled there by the Divine Providence, concerns only
<pb n="34" facs="tcp:50779:19"/>
such Kingdoms, where God makes Kings only by his Providence;
not such Kingdoms where God ordinarily makes Kings by a particu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lar
nomination of the Person, or by a Divine entail, which is equi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>valent
to a particular nomination: For this greatly alters the Case.</p>
            <p>To make this plain, let us consider the state of the Kingdom of
<hi>Iudah,</hi> and of the Kingdom of <hi>Israel,</hi> after the <hi>Ten Tribes</hi> were divided
from the House of <hi>David.</hi> God first made Kings by an express nomi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nation
of the Persons, as he did <hi>Soul</hi> and <hi>David,</hi> and afterwards en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tailed
the Kingdom on <hi>David</hi>'s Posterity; when the <hi>Ten Tribes</hi> were
divided from <hi>Iudah,</hi> he still reserved to himself the Prerogative of
nominating their Kings when he pleased; but yet he did not so
strictly confine himself to nominate whom he would have to be
King, or to an entail of his own making; but that he sometimes set
up Kings by his Providence, without a particular nomination, or any
successive right, as he did in other Nations; let us then consider what
the right of these providential Kings was in <hi>Iudah</hi> and <hi>Israel.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Now these Kings, when they were setled in their Thrones, had all
the rights of other Soveraign Princes of <hi>Iudah</hi> or <hi>Israel,</hi> excepting
this, that they were liable to be divested of their Kingdom by God's
nomination of a new King, or by the revival of an old Entail.
When God nominated any King, and gave command to his Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phets
to anoint him, it was always for life; and tho' during his Life
he might nominate another to succeed him after his death, as he
did <hi>David</hi> to succeed <hi>Saul,</hi> yet he never nominated another to take
his Life and his Crown from him: and when he had made a perpetual
Entail, tho' he might for a time interrupt the Succession, he did not
cut it off; but it was otherwise with meer providential Kings, as it
must necessarily be in such Kingdoms which were under the immedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ate
disposal and nomination of God: A new nomination, or the ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pearing
of the right Heir, put an end to their Reign. As for example.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Ieroboam</hi> was placed on the Throne of <hi>Israel</hi> by God's nomina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion,
and Reigned as long as he lived, but for his sins God would
not entail the Kingdom on his Family; but <hi>Baasha</hi> slew his Son
<hi>Nadab,</hi> and succeeded in the Kingdom, and was the first providen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tial
King of <hi>Israel</hi> without a Divine nomination or entail. <hi>Elah,
Baasha</hi>'s Son, was slain by <hi>Zimri,</hi> and the Children of <hi>Israel,</hi> with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out
any Divine appointment, made <hi>Omri</hi> King; <hi>Ahab</hi> his Son suc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceeded
<hi>Omri,</hi> and <hi>Ioram Ahab,</hi> who were all advanced by the Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vine
Providence, without God's nomination; but now their sins
being very provoking, God commands his Prophet to anoint <hi>Iehu</hi>
King over <hi>Israel,</hi> to destroy the Family of <hi>Ahab;</hi> and <hi>Iehu</hi> as soon as
<pb n="35" facs="tcp:50779:19"/>
he was anointed, immediately takes possession of the Kingdom, kills
<hi>Ioram,</hi> and destroys the House of <hi>Ahab.</hi> For tho' <hi>Ioram</hi> was advanced
by the Providence of God, and was the third successive King of
his Family, and therefore had a good right against all human claims;
yet he could have no unalterable right in the Kingdom of <hi>Israel,</hi> be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause
that Kingdom was at God's immediate disposal, when ever he
pleased to nominate a King. And this is the Reason of the different
behaviour of <hi>David</hi> and <hi>Iehu: David</hi> was anointed as well as <hi>Iehu,</hi> but
he never pretended to the Crown while <hi>Saul</hi> lived, because there was
then an <hi>anointed King</hi> on the Throne: But this was not <hi>Ioram</hi>'s case;
He had no more than a Providential Right, which in the Kingdom of
<hi>Israel</hi> must give place to God's anointing; and therefore <hi>Iehu</hi> was
King of <hi>Israel</hi> as soon as he was anointed, and <hi>Ioram</hi> was his Subject.</p>
            <p>And this was <hi>Athaliah</hi>'s case; She took possession of the Throne
by very wicked means, but must be allowed to be placed there by
the Providence of God; and if she had as <hi>thorow a settlement,</hi> as
other Usurpers can have, had a right to the submission and obe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dience
of the <hi>Iews,</hi> while it was not known that the King's Son
was living; but <hi>Iudah</hi> was an Hereditary Kingdom by God's en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tail,
and therefore as soon as the true Heir appeared, she fell from
her Power, as much by the express Ordinance and Command of
God, as <hi>Ioram</hi> did when <hi>Iehu</hi> was anointed; for a Divine Entail,
as the <hi>Convocation</hi> asserts, is equivalent to <hi>an express nomination.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>This shews a manifest difference between Kings set up by the Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vine
Providence in the Kingdoms of <hi>Iudah</hi> and <hi>Israel,</hi> which were
subject to the Divine Nomination, or to a Divine Entail; and King's
set up by the Providence of God in other Nations, where God
makes Kings only by his Providence: The first may be, and are de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>posed
when ever God nominates a new King, or the Right Heir
appears; tho' they had all the Rights and Settlement of the Regal
Power before; in other Nations, those Kings, who are placed in
the Throne, and setled there, are, and continue Kings, till the Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vidence
of God displace them again; for where Kings are made on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
by the Providence of God, they can be unmade by Providence too.</p>
            <p>Had our <hi>Author</hi> considered this, he would not have said, That <hi>it
is meer trifling to talk of God's entailing the Crown, as if God was tied any
more to the entails of his own making, than he is to humane Entails, and
his own Decrees and Orders would not cut off his own Entails as well as
those of Men.</hi> For tho God may cut off <hi>his own Entails,</hi> if he pleases,
yet Men can't, and the meer Events of Providence can never prove,
that God has done it; for we must never interpret providential
<pb n="36" facs="tcp:50779:20"/>
Events to contradict an express Revelation: And therefore, tho
the Providence of God in placing a King on the Throne in <hi>Iudah</hi> or
<hi>Israel,</hi> who neither was anointed by God's Command, nor had an
Hereditary Right by God's Entail, justified their Submission to
him; yet whenever God was pleased to anoint a new King, or to
discover their Hereditary Prince, and to put it into their Power to
place him on the Throne, the Right and Authority of these Provi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dential
Kings was at an end.</p>
            <p>And now there will be no great occasion to take much notice of
what he answers to my second Argument, <hi>From the necessity of Govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment,
to the Preservation of Humane Society;</hi> for I readily grant what he
contends for, That <hi>these Arguments will equally conclude for Submission to</hi>
Athaliah, <hi>as to any other Vsurper;</hi> and what then? The <hi>Iews</hi> did
actually submit to <hi>Athaliah,</hi> and this Argument from the necessity
of Government justifies their Submission. But our <hi>Author</hi> disputes,
as if it were manifest that the <hi>Iews</hi> did not submit to <hi>Athaliah;</hi> but
it is evident from the Story, that they did, and yet are not blamed
in Scripture for so doing; but I suppose his mistake is, that be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause
they owned <hi>Ioash</hi> for their King, when he was anointed by
<hi>Iehojada,</hi> and slew <hi>Athaliah,</hi> therefore they never submitted to <hi>A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thaliah</hi>'s
Government; as if they could not very innocently and law<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fully
submit to the Government of <hi>Athaliah,</hi> while they knew of
no other King they had, and yet own their King, who was their
King by a <hi>Divine Entail,</hi> when they knew him; but indeed, here is
the fundamental mistake of all, That he supposes the <hi>Iews</hi> all this
while knew, that <hi>Ioash</hi> the true Heir to the Crown was living, and
therefore out of Loyalty to their Prince, they did not all this while
submit to <hi>Athaliah;</hi> whereas it is evident from the Story, that they
knew nothing of this matter, till <hi>Iehojada</hi> sent for the <hi>Princes</hi> and
<hi>Levites,</hi> and discovered the King's Son to them; and I would de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sire
him to consider, how <hi>Athaliah</hi> should be ignorant of this for
six years, when all the People of <hi>Israel</hi> knew it; and yet, if he was
not guilty of this mistake, I know not what sense to make of what
he says, <hi>(p. 8.)</hi> about <hi>swearing an Oath of Fidelity to her, to defend
her against all Men, even against him whom they owned and acknowledg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
had a Right to the Throne;</hi> that is, against <hi>Ioash,</hi> who was their
Rightful King, but they could not own and acknowledg him
to be so, without believing him to be alive and safe: And yet,
if they knew nothing of <hi>Ioash,</hi> and did believe that the Royal
Line was extinct, I desire to know of our Author, by his own
Principles, had it been customary in those Days, what should have
<pb n="37" facs="tcp:50779:20"/>
hindred them to have sworn Allegiance to <hi>Athaliah?</hi> for he allows
possession to be something, when there is no better claim against it.
And yet though they had sworn Allegiance to <hi>Athaliah,</hi> they might
without Perjury have owned their lawful Prince, when <hi>Iehoiada</hi>
had discovered him to them; for no Oath can oblige against a Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vine
Entail; and therefore such Cases are always supposed to be ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cepted.</p>
            <p>I asserted in <hi>the Case,</hi>
               <note place="margin">Case of Allegi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance, <hi>p.</hi> 42.</note> 
               <hi>That Government and Allegiance are such rela<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tives,
as do</hi> mutuÃ² se ponere &amp; tollere, <hi>the one cannot subsist without
the other: if the Prince can't govern, the Subject can't obey; and therefore
as far as he quits his Government, he quits their Allegiance, and leaves his
Subjects, as he does his Crown, to be possessed by another, and must recover them
both together.</hi>
               <note place="margin">Postcript. <hi>p.</hi> 7.</note> This Our <hi>Author</hi> says, <hi>is as plain a fallacy, as ever he met
with,</hi> and proves from the Example of <hi>Ioash,</hi> that it is so; but I
have said so much already to that case, that I will trouble my Reader
no further with it. Divine and Humane Entails give very different
rights to Princes (as will appear more presently) and yet even in Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vine
Entails, it was lawful for Subjects to submit to, and obey Usur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ped
Powers, either when they were under force, or when they knew
not their Rightful King; that is, whenever their King could not
govern them.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>He says,</hi> By Government, I mean the actual administration of it; and then
Government and Allegiance are so far from being such Relatives, that they are
no Relatives at all; they are only the Acts of Relatives; and to say the Acts of
Relatives, are Relatives, is so far from being as certain as any Proposition
in Logic, that it is Logical Non-sense. <hi>Well!</hi> Logical Non-sense, <hi>I hope, is
the best sort of Non-sense however.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>But my meaning is plain enough, and certainly true, which is
as much, as any Proposition in Logic can be: By <hi>Government,</hi> I do
mean the <hi>Actual Administration of Government,</hi> not as that signifies the
particular Acts of Government; but the actual possession of Power
and Authority to govern: by <hi>Allegiance,</hi> I mean that Obedience and
Subjection which is due to Government; and if our <hi>Author</hi> will be
so severe, as not to allow me to call these <hi>Relatives,</hi> yet they are the
Relations which make the Relatives, and do <hi>mutuÃ² se ponere &amp; tollere;</hi>
for what is the relation of a King to a Subject? His Dominion and
Government: What is the relation of a Subject to a King? His due
Allegiance and Subjection: then Dominion and Government makes
a King, and Allegiance a Subject; and Allegiance has as necessary a
relation to Dominion, as a Subject has to a King; if there be no
King, there can be no Subject; if no Dominion and Government,
<pb n="38" facs="tcp:50779:21"/>
there can be no Allegiance. Paternity is the relation that makes a
Father, and Filiation a Son, and Paternity and Filiation have as
mutual and necessary a respect to each other, as Father and Son;
these are called by <hi>Logicians, Relative Acts,</hi> and why then may not I
call Government and Subjection <hi>Relative Duties,</hi> by which I explain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
what I meant by Relatives; but this I'm sure is only a Logical
Banter, and so let it pass.</p>
            <p>But as to the matter in hand, since we are got into <hi>Logic,</hi> I desire
to know of our <hi>Author,</hi> whether the Relative continues to be a Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lative,
when the relation is destroyed; for we are told, that the whole
nature of Relatives, <hi>relata secundum esse,</hi> (for I must speak cautiously)
consists in their Relation: if the Relation then of a King to his Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jects
be Dominion and Government, does he continue a King, when
he has lost his Dominion and Government? or do Subjects conti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nue
Subjects, when he ceases to be King? do they owe him Alle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>giance,
when he has lost his Dominion? that is, can one Relative
subsist by its self, without its Correlate?</p>
            <p>He tells us indeed,<note place="margin">Postscript. <hi>p.</hi> 10.</note> that <hi>the relation is only between King and Subject,
and the actual Administration of Government of the one hand, and paying Al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>legiance
on the other, are but the acts of that Relation, and consequential to
it, but are not Relatives themselves:</hi> But I desire to know, what he calls
the relation between King and Subjects; for King and Subjects are
not the relation, but Relatives; as Father and Son are Relatives,
Paternity and Filiation the Relation; now I desire to know what is
the Relation between these Relatives, King and Subjects? the par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticular
Acts of Government, and the particular Acts of Allegiance,
I grant, are but the Acts of that Relation, but still we want to know
what the Relation is, to which these particular Acts are consequential,
and let our <hi>Author</hi> think of anything else, wherein to place this Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lation,
if he can, besides actual Dominion, and Sovereign Power,
on the one hand, to make a King, and the obligations to Subjection
and Allegiance, on the other hand, to make a Subject: from whence
flow the particular Acts of Government and Allegiance: now if the
Relative ceases with the Relation, where actual Dominion and Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernment
ceases, the Kingship is lost, and the obligations to Subje<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction
and Allegiance with it. All that I know of, that can be said
in this Cause (and which those men must say, who make Allegiance
inseparable from Right) is only this, that the Relation continues, as
long as the <hi>fundamentum relationis,</hi> that whereon the Relation is
founded, continues; and that being a Legal Right, while this Right
remains, such a Legal King, though he be fallen from Power, is
<pb n="39" facs="tcp:50779:21"/>
King still, and Subjects are Subjects still, and owe Allegiance to
him.</p>
            <p>Now to shorten this Dispute, I shall only observe, That a Legal
Hereditary Right is not the <hi>fundamentum relationis,</hi> the foundation of
that relation, which is between Prince and Subjects, for then there
would be no foundation of this relation between Prince and Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jects
in any but Hereditary Kingdoms; for the same relation can
have but one foundation; and yet there are a great many ways
whereby Princes are advanced to the Throne; An Hereditary Right,
The Election of the People, The Nomination of God, A Divine Entail,
And Conquest, Which very much differ from each other; and if all
these be different Foundations, there must be different <hi>Kinds</hi> and <hi>Spe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cies</hi>
of Kingship; whereas the Relation between King and Subjects
is the same in all.</p>
            <p>And therefore we must find out such a foundation for this Rela<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion,
as will serve all Sovereign Princes, by what means soever they
are setled in the Throne; and that can be no other but the Autho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity
of God, by which Kings reign, and to which Subjects owe obedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence:
the several ways of advancing Princes to the Throne, are but
the several ways of investing them with God's Authority; but the
Authority of God with which they are invested, is the foun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dation
of this Relation; and this is not always annexed to a Legal
Right, but is always annexed to a full and setled possession of the
Throne. No man can have God's Authority, who has not the actual
Power and Authority of Government; for God's Authority is the
Authority of Government; and when Princes fall from Government,
so far they lose God's Authority, whatever becomes of their Legal
Right; and all <hi>Logicians</hi> grant, that Relations are dissolved, when
the foundation of such Relations cease. And therefore as in the nature
of the thing, Subjects cannot obey a Prince, when he can't command,
nor submit to him, when he can't govern; so when he falls from his
Government, and another Prince is setled in his Throne, the foun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dation
of this Relation at present ceases; for when God has taken
away his Government, he has taken away his present Authority to
govern; for God never gives the Civil Authority<g ref="char:punc">âª</g> without the Ci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vil
Sword.</p>
            <p>I grant in all other Relations, where the Relation it self does not
consist in the Authority of Government, nor the foundation of the
Relation cease by falling from the actual Authority of Government,
the Case is different, as between Parents and Children, Masters and
Servants, where the Relation is founded in Nature, or Purchase, or
<pb n="40" facs="tcp:50779:22"/>
Civil Contracts, under the superior direction and government of the
Civil Authority; tho the Master of the Family, as he says, be <hi>spirited
away, or taken captive,</hi> his Servants, and House, and Family, do not pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sently
fall to the lot of the next Possessor, but must be disposed of
by the Laws of the Countrey, and by the Authority of the Prince;
for such private and particular Interests are subject to publick Laws,
and a Superior Authority. But the Authority of God is at his own
disposal, and Sovereign Power and Dominion, to which the Divine
Authority is annexed, is the Relation of a King to his Subjects; and
when his Sovereignty is lost, the Relation is so far dissolved, and there
is no higher Tribunal to appeal to, but to that God who removeth
Kings, and setteth up Kings.</p>
            <p>And this shews, how inconsequent his Argument is, from the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>capacity
of a Subject to pay Allegiance, and a King to govern. <hi>If</hi>
(says he) <hi>a Subject be taken captive, or otherwise hindred from paying actual
Allegiance, is the Relation lost, and does he therefore immediately cease to be
a Subject? And therefore neither doth a King, if he be hindred from the actual
administration of Government, cease to be a King, but hath the same right to
our Allegiance, in, and out of possession.</hi> Now to wave all other Answers
(though, I suppose, our <hi>Author</hi> will not deny, that such a Captive
may become a Subject to another Prince) these two Cases are not
parallel; in the first Case, tho the Subject is taken Captive, yet the
foundation of the Relation is not destroyed, for his Prince is on his
Throne still, in the actual administration of the Government, tho he be
violently torn from him; so that this Relation may continue, because
he has a Prince to whom he is related: but when the Prince is fallen
from his Kingdom and Power, the foundation of the Relation is at
present destroyed; the Kingdom is translated to another Prince, and
the Subjects, and their Allegiance translated with it.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Our</hi> Author <hi>proceeds to argue from the Case of</hi> Ioash. The Doctor's
distinction <hi>(that is, about a Divine Entail)</hi> is against him. 'Tis true, God
did entail the Kingdom of <hi>Judah</hi> on the Family of <hi>David,</hi> and for that rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son
they ought not to submit to an Vsurper. But this is so far from being a
reason, why they may submit to one in other Kingdoms, where Entails are
made by Laws that it is a reason, and a very good one, why they ought not.</p>
            <p>But before we hear his Reason, I must observe that he mistakes
the use of my Distinction; which was not to prove, That because
God had entailed the Kingdom of <hi>Iudah</hi> on the Posterity of <hi>David,</hi>
and had reserved to himself a right in the Kingdom of <hi>Israel,</hi> to
nominate their King, and entail the Crown, when he pleased;
that therefore the Subjects of those Kingdoms might not submit to
<pb n="41" facs="tcp:50779:22"/>
any other Kings, whom the Providence of God placed in the
Throne, without such a Divine Nomination and Entail; for it ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pears
from what I have already discoursed, that they both actually
did, and lawfully might submit to such providential Kings, when
either there was no King by God's Nomination or Entail, or no
such King was known; but the use of the Distinction was to shew,
that in such <hi>Theocratical</hi> Kingdoms, where God challenged a peculiar
right to make Kings by his express Nomination or Entail, though
God may see fit sometimes to set a providential King upon the
Throne, yet whenever he nominates a new King, or discovers the
right Heir to whom the Crown belongs by a Divine Entail, the
Reign of such Providential Kings is at an end, and the Subjects
may and ought to depose or kill them, and own the King of God's
nomination: so that if he will prove any thing from my Distinction
with reference to other entailed Kingdoms, he must shew, that my
Distinction proves, that in such Kingdoms, where God makes Kings
only by his Providence, a Humane Entail of the Crown will justifie
Subjects in deposing and murthering a new King who is placed
and setled in the Throne by Providence, while the Legal King, or
Legal Heir is Living, as much as God's express Nomination or En<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tail
would justifie the deposing a Providential King in the King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>doms
of <hi>Iudah</hi> and <hi>Israel.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>And now let us hear his Reason:</hi> For <hi>(says he)</hi> God's entailing
the Crown of <hi>Judah,</hi> was the Law of that Kingdom in that respect; and
the people of other Kingdoms are as much bound to observe their own Laws,
as the people of Iudah were theirs. All Humane Laws that are just, bind
in Conscience, and (according to the Doctor's own Principles) these Laws
were made by God's Authority. So that the Doctor mistakes the Question;
we do not oppose Humane Laws to God's Authority, but we oppose Laws
which are made by God's Authority, and which are Rules to us, to Provi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence,
which is no Rule. When God entailed the Crown upon <hi>David's</hi>
Posterity, they had then a Legal Right to it, and so hath every Family in o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
Kingdoms, upon which an Entail is made by the respective Laws of the
Countrey.</p>
            <p>But what would our Author prove from this? That in every
Hereditary Kingdom the Legal Heir has a Legal right to the Crown,
as well as in <hi>Iudah?</hi> and did I ever deny it? or that the standing
Laws of every Countrey are the Rule for Subjects in setting up
Kings, when it is their own free Act and Choice; and who denies
this too? There is a Dispute indeed whether the Laws of <hi>England</hi>
do oblige Subjects in all cases to make the next Lineal Heir to the
<pb n="42" facs="tcp:50779:23"/>
Crown their King; but no man ever denied, but that in making
Kings, Subjects are bound by the Laws of the Land, when it is
their own free and voluntary Act. I am sure my <hi>Hypothesis</hi> is not
concerned in this Question, and therefore be it how it will, it can
prove nothing against me. Or would he prove, that when an Entail
is setled either by Divine or Humane Laws, God never interposes
by his Providence to set up a King, who has not this Entailed Le<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gal
Right? This was manifestly false, both in the Kingdom of <hi>Iu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dah</hi>
and <hi>Israel,</hi> which God had reserved for his own Nomination,
or Entail, and yet He set up several providential Kings, <hi>Athaliah</hi> in
<hi>Iudah,</hi> and <hi>Baasha,</hi> and <hi>Omri,</hi> and <hi>Ahab,</hi> and <hi>Ioram</hi> and others in
<hi>Israel;</hi> and in all other Kingdoms, at one time or other. Or would
he prove, that when God by his Providence has setled a Prince in
the Throne without a Legal Right, Subjects ought not to obey
him, and submit to him as their King? This is confuted by the
Examples of <hi>Iudah</hi> and <hi>Israel,</hi> who submitted to <hi>Athaliah,</hi> and their
providential Kings, who had no Legal Right, by a Divine Nomina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion,
or Entail, and are yet never blamed for it. Or would he
prove, that a Human Entail of the Crown does as much oblige Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jects
in Conscience to pull down a King, who is setled in his Throne
by God's Providence, with a National Consent and Submission, but
without a Legal Right, to set the Legal Heir on his Throne again,
as <hi>Iehoiada</hi> was, by virtue of the Divine Entail, to anoint <hi>Ioash,</hi> and
slay <hi>Athaliah?</hi> This is the single Point he ought to prove; but I do
not see that he offers any thing like a proof of it.</p>
            <p>The sum of his Argument is this; That a Human Entail of the
Crown, made by the Laws of any Countrey, does in all Cases,
and to all intents and purposes, as much oblige Subjects, as a Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vine
Entail, which is only the Law of the Kingdom too. <hi>For the
people of other Kingdoms are as much bound to observe their own Laws, as
the people of</hi> Judah <hi>were theirs.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>The Dispute in general about the Authority and obligation of
Humane Laws, is very impertinent to this purpose; for no man de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nies
it; But yet we think Divine Political Laws much more sacred,
and universally obligatory than any meer Human Laws, tho they
are made by men, who have their Authority of Government, and
consequently of making Laws from God; and I believe our <hi>Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thor</hi>
is the first man who has equalled Humane Laws, with those Laws
which are immediately given by God.</p>
            <p>But the Dispute between Divine and Humane Laws, and a Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vine
and Humane Entail of the Crown, are of a very different na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture,
<pb n="43" facs="tcp:50779:23"/>
though they be both the Laws of the Countrey for which
they are made, as will easily appear, if we compare God's making
Kings by a providential settlement of them in the Throne, with a
Divine and with a Humane Entail A Divine Entail is God's setling the
Crown on such a Family by the express Revelation of his Will; and
though God should after this, settle a Prince in the Throne by his
Providence, to whom the Crown did not belong by this Entail,
such a Providence would not justifie Subjects in submitting to such
a providential King, when it is in their power to set the right Heir
upon the Throne; for this would be to expound Providence against
the express Revelation of God's Will: But a Human Entail is on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
a providential settlement of the Crown on such a Family; and
what is setled only by Providence, may be unsetled by Providence
again; for where God makes Kings only by his Providence, he
can unmake them by his Providence also, and make new ones.</p>
            <p>This discovers the fallacy of what he adds; <hi>We do not oppose Hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man
Laws to God's Authority, but we oppose Laws that are made by God's
Authority, and which are a Rule to us, to Providence, which is no Rule.</hi>
Now I would ask our <hi>Author,</hi> Whether the Laws of <hi>England,</hi> which
entail the Crown, are not Humane Laws? If they be, I ask, Whether
they do not oppose these Humane Laws to the Authority of God in
making Kings by his Providence? for do they not refuse to obey a
King, whom the providence of God has placed and setled in the
Throne, upon a pretence that he is not King by Law? And then
I think, they give greater Authority to the Laws of the Land, than
to God in making Kings, which is to oppose Humane Laws to
God's Authority.</p>
            <p>To avoid this, he will not call them Humane Laws, but <hi>Laws
made by Gods Authority;</hi> but the Question is, Whether they are Hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mane
or Divine Laws? It is a childish piece of Sophistry, and argues
a great contempt of his Readers, to call Humane Laws, <hi>Laws made
by God's Authority,</hi> because Sovereign Power, which makes these
Laws, is God's Authority; as if there were no difference between
Humane and Divine Laws, because they are both made by God's Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thority;
though the one are made by the immediate Authority of
God, the other are made by men, who receive their Authority
from God; whereas in the first Case the Authority of God gives
an immediate Divine Authority to the Laws made by God, which
therefore are said to be made by God's Authority; in the other
case the Authority of God terminates on the Person, and does not
immediately affect his Laws; Sovereign Princes have their Autho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity
<pb n="44" facs="tcp:50779:24"/>
from God, but their Laws are the Laws of Men; and the
difference between them is this, that Divine Laws, which are
made by God himself, have a Superior Authority to Men, and to
all Humane Laws, though made by a delegated Authority from
God; for God grants Authority to Men only in subordination to
himself, and the Authority of his own Laws: He might as well
have said, That all the By-laws of a Corporation are the King's
Laws, because made by his Authority granted to them by Charter;
and therefore there is no difference between the private Laws of
the City, and the Laws of the Kingdom, as being both made by
the Authority of the King. This may satisfy our <hi>Author,</hi> That
though Humane Laws in some sense may be said to be made by
God's Authority, yet when men oppose a legal Entail of the Crown
to the Authority of God in making Kings, they oppose Humane
Laws to the Authority of God.</p>
            <p>Well! but <hi>these Law are our Rule;</hi> they are are so, when they are
not over-ruled by a Superior Authority; but that they may be by
the Authority of God: And <hi>the Providence of God is no Rule to us;</hi> If by
this he means, that we must not make Providence the Rule of Good
and Evil to us, <hi>i. e.</hi> that we must not think it lawful for us to do
whatever the Providence of God does, I grant it; for the Laws of
God are the Rules of Good and Evil, not his Providence: but if he
means, the Providence of God cannot direct our Duty cannot lay some
new Obligations on us, and discharge our old ones, this is manifestly
false in a thousand Instances; every new Condition Providence puts us
in, every new Relation it creates, it requires some new Duties, and lays
some new Obligations on us. I shall instance only in the Case before
us: If the Providence of God can remove one King, and set up ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther,
tho this does not alter the Duty of Subjects to their Prince, yet
it changes the Object of their Allegiance, as it changes their Prince:
the Laws of God prescribe the Duty of Subjects to their Prince, but
the Providence of God makes him.</p>
            <p>And now let us consider the opposition he makes between Hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mane
Laws of Entail, and Providence; for he confesses, they do op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pose
<hi>Laws made by the Divine Authority,</hi> that is, the Laws of the Land,
which entail the Crown, <hi>to Providence,</hi> or to the Providence of God
in making Kings: that is, they think themselves bound in Consci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence
to adhere to that King, tho out of possession, who by the Laws
of the Land has a legal Right to the Crown, against that King, who
is actually setled in the Throne by the Providence of God: Now
if we will consider the sense of things, and not the words, this is
<pb n="45" facs="tcp:50779:24"/>
no more than to say, that they oppose the Providence of God against
Providence; his former Providence against his later Providence;
that is, they will not allow the Providence of God to change and
alter, whatever Reasons the Divine Wisdom sees for it; but what
God has once done, that they are resolved to abide by, whatever
he thinks fit to do afterwards, which is to oppose God's Autho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity,
and to shackle and confine Providence, that it shall not alter
its usual methods in the Government of the World; or when it
has disposed of the Crown once, shall never be at liberty, while
that Family lasts, to dispose of it again to any other.</p>
            <p>For what are these Laws, which, he says, <hi>are made by the Divine
Authority,</hi> and are <hi>our Rule?</hi> They are the Laws of Succession,
which entail the Crown. And how does God settle the Crown on
any Family by such Laws? No otherwise but by his Providence, so
over-ruling the hearts and counsels of Men, as to consent to such an
Entail, which gives a humane Right to the Crown, and bars all
other humane Claim. So that an Hereditary King, by a humane
entail of the Crown, with respect to God, is only a Providential
King; as much a Providential King as the first of the Family was,
who obtain'd it by Election, or Conquest, or worse Arts, not by
God's express nomination of the Person: So that to opppose the
Laws of Entail made, not by God's immediate Authority, as they
were in the Kingdom of <hi>Iudah,</hi> but by the over-ruling influence
of Providence, against God's setting up a new King on the Throne,
by other Acts of his Providence, is to oppose Providence against
Providence; God's Providenee in setling the Crown in such a Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mily
by a legal Entail, against his Providence in setling a new King
upon the Throne: It is all but Providence still, and I desire to know
why the Providence of an Entail is more Sacred and Obligatory
than any other Act of Providence, which gives a Setled possession of
the Throne?</p>
            <p>
               <hi>What follows is pretty, and nothing more: The Land of</hi> Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>naan
<hi>was divided among the Twelve Tribes by God's express Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mand,
and this answers to God's Entail of the Crown on</hi> David'<hi>s
Family; the possession in all other Countries is only by Providence,
and this answers to a humane Right and Title to the Crown: Well!
there is something of likeness between them,</hi>
               <note place="margin">Postscript<g ref="char:punc">âª</g> 
                  <hi>p.</hi> 11.</note> 
               <hi>and what then?</hi> And
therefore according to the Doctor's way of reasoning, every Man who wrong<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fully
possessed himself of another Man's Estate in that Land <hi>(Canaan)</hi>
must be made to restore it; for God had expresly given it to the other, and
to his Family. But in all other Countries, if a Man by Providence get his
<pb n="46" facs="tcp:50779:25"/>
Neighbour's Estate, he must have it; for the event is God's Act, and it is
his evident Decree and Counsel that he should have it.</p>
            <p>Now the fundamental mistake, which runs through all these
kind of Arguments, is this; That they make the events of Provi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence
in private injuries, Thefts, Robberies, Encroachments of
one Subject on another Subject's Rights, to be the very same with
God's disposal of Kingdoms, and to have the same effects; where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>as
all private injuries are reserved by God himself to the correction
and redress of Publick Government, and Humane Courts of Ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stice;
and therefore his Providence has no effect at all on such
personal Rights; but the very nature of the thing proves, that
such disputes, which are too big for a legal decision, or any
humane Courts, for the decision of which, God has erected
no universal Tribunal on Earth, he has reserved to his own
judgment, such as the Correction of Sovereign Princes,
and the transferring Kingdoms and Empires; and here the
final determinations of Providence in setling Princes on their
Thrones, draws the Allegiance and Submission of Subjects after it;
and in such Cases God does not confine himself to determine on
the side of Humane Right, but acts with a Soveraign Authority,
and gives the Kingdoms of the World to whom he pleases, as he
can best serve the Wise, and many times the unsearchable designs
of his Providence by it; which shows how much our <hi>Author</hi> is
out, in applying what I said of God's making Kings, to God's
disposal of private Estates. <hi>It is to say, that God, as well as Men, is
confined to humane Laws;</hi> In making Kings, I said; <hi>In disposing of
Estates,</hi> saith our <hi>Author;</hi> as if <hi>disposing of Estates,</hi> and <hi>making
Kings,</hi> were the very same thing; whereas God has erected humane
Judicatures to Judge of the first, but has reserved the second to
his own judgment; and when God himself judges, he judges
with Authority, with Wisdom, with Justice, superior to all humane
Laws. Our <hi>Author</hi> might as well have said, That we must not
resist private Men, or Inferior Officers, when they are injurious,
because we must not resist a Sovereign Prince, when he illegally
oppresses us, as that we must not dispossess a private Subject, who
has injuriously possessed himself of our Estates, because Subjects
must not pull down a Prince, who is setled in the Throne with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out
a legal Right. The <hi>Poet</hi> would have taught him the differ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence
between these two Cases.</p>
            <q>
               <l>
                  <pb n="47" facs="tcp:50779:25"/>
Regum timendorum in proprios Greges.</l>
               <l>Reges in ipsos Imperium est Iovis.</l>
            </q>
            <p>Subjects are under the Government and Correction of Princes;
Princes under the Government of God.</p>
            <p>And besides this, according to my Principles, Kings must be <hi>thorough<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
setled</hi> in their Government before it becomes unlawful for Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jects
to dispossess them; and then if he will make the Cases paral<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lel,
He who unjustly seizes another Man's Estate, must be <hi>throughly
setled</hi> in it, before it becomes unlawful to dispossess him; but that
no private Man can be, who is under the Government of Laws,
and has not the possession of his Estate given him by Law; and
when he has, whether right or wrong, he must not be violently
dispossessed again; but in Causes superior to Laws, as the revolu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions
of Government, and the translations of Kingdoms are,
there may be a <hi>thorow settlement</hi> by a setled possession without Law;
and must be so, where Laws cannot determine the controversy,
that is, where there is no superior Tribunal to take cognizance
of it.</p>
            <p>So, that as our <hi>Author</hi> has stated the Case, it signifies nothing
to the present purpose; for whether private Mens Estates be set<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led
by a Divine or Humane Entail, it is the same case; if they
suffer any Injury from their Fellow-Subjects, they must seek
for Redress from publick Government; but I could have told
him a way, how to have applied this case to the purpose;
but then it would not have been to his purpose, but to
mine.</p>
            <p>In <hi>Canaan,</hi> where God allotted every Tribe and Family their
Inheritance, none could pretend a Right to any Portion of Land,
but what was allotted them: but in other Countries, which were
left in common, Possession and Occupation gave a Right. Thus
in <hi>Iudah,</hi> none had an ordinary Right to the Crown, but those
who were nominated by God, or had the Crown descended on
them by a Divine Entail; but in other Countries, Possession and
Occupation gave a Right to the Allegiance of Subjects.</p>
            <p>In <hi>Canaan,</hi> when God had setled such an Inheritance in a Fami<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly,
it could never be perpetually alienated; but tho it were sold,
it could be sold for no longer time than till the year of <hi>Iubilee,</hi>
when all Estates were to return to their old Proprietors again; but
in other Countries, Men may part with their Estates for ever. Thus
in the Kingdom of <hi>Iudah,</hi> tho God by his Sovereign Authority
<pb n="48" facs="tcp:50779:26"/>
might set up a Providential King, yet this did not cut off the En<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tail,
but when ever the true Heir appeared, Subjects, if they were
at liberty, were bound to make him King, and dispossess the Usur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per;
but in other Kingdoms, a Kingdom may be lost, as well as an
Inheritance sold for ever.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>In Answer to that Objection,</hi> That the Laws of the Land in such
Cases as these, are the measure of our Duty, and the Rule of Conscience;
and therefore we must own no King, but whom the Laws of the Land
own to be King, that is, in an H<gap reason="illegible: missing" extent="1 letter">

               <note place="margin">Case of Alleg. <hi>p.</hi> 51, 52.</note> That the Laws of the Land are the Rule of Conscience, when
they do not contradict the Laws of God; but when they do, they are no
Rule to us, but their Obligation must give place to a Divine Authority.
Suppose then there were an express Law, that the Subjects of <hi>England</hi>
should own no King but the Right Heir; and notwithstanding this Law,
(as it will sometimes happen, and has often happened in <hi>England)</hi> a Prince,
who is not the right Heir, should get into the Throne, and settle himself there;
if the Divine Law in such a Case commands us to pay all the Obedience and
Duty of Subjects to a Prince in the actual Possession of the Throne, and the
Law of the Land forbids it, which must we obey, the Law of God, or the
Law of the Land?</p>
            <p>To this our <hi>Author</hi> answers,<note place="margin">Postscript, <hi>p.</hi> 11.</note> 
               <hi>Where is this Law of God, that com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mands
us to obey Vsurpers? Where is it ever affirmed in Scripture in ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>press
Terms, or deduced from thence by evident Consequence?</hi> This I had
shewed before, and it is in my <hi>Boek</hi> still, and there he may see it.
But <hi>this Law had need be very clear and evident, and the Doctor had need
be very sure of it, when he builds not only his Book, but his Practice upon
it, in plain Contradiction (by his own confession) to the Laws of the Land.</hi>
But I never confessed, this was contrary to the Laws of the Land;
but on the contrary, that the Laws of the Land, if we will believe
Learned Judges and Lawyers, do allow and justify it; and I think
the Scripture is very plain in the case; and if he would give me
leave to be sure of any thing, I think I am pretty sure of it. But
he proves the Scriptures cannot be clear in the point, <hi>from the Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>troversies
about it, in the late dismal Times of Vsurpation;</hi> that is to
say, nothing can be clear in Scripture, which is matter of Contro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>versy;
and thus we must either be <hi>Scepticks</hi> in Religion, or seek
for an Infallible Interpreter. Thus Hereticks oppose the Articles
of Faith; thus Papists dispute against the Scriptures being the
Rule of Faith; and whither these Arguments will carry our <hi>Author,</hi>
I cannot tell, but they look very kindly towards <hi>Rome;</hi> and if that
be his Inclination, I can pardon his Zeal in this Cause.</p>

<hi>Grotius,</hi> who have both passed for learned Men? And they espi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
this Law before the time of <hi>Iohn Goodwin,</hi> as he may see, if
he pleases, in their <hi>Commentaries</hi> on <hi>Daniel,</hi> and the <hi>Romans;</hi> or
that he may not seek for it, I have given him a tast of their

espied this Doctrine, before <hi>Iohn Goodwin</hi> was thought of; what
<hi>Iohn Goodwin</hi> thought of this matter I cannot tell, for I am not
much versed in his Writings; but if some Men abused a true
Doctrine to wicked purposes, must we therefore deny the Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrine,
or rather vindicate it from such Abuses? But what
thinks he of the Primitive Christians, whose Sense he may
guess at, from what <hi>Grotius</hi> has cited; and their practice in
all the Revolutions of the Empire does more fully declare it;
for they always submitted to the Reigning Emperor, by what
means soever they gained the Throne; and that is an argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment,
that they owned the Doctrine, because they practiced it;
as our <hi>Author</hi> will quickly be informed by a Learned Pen.</p>
            <p>I grant indeed, That the Resolution of Conscience ought
not to depend on such Nicties of Law and History, as Learn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
Men cannot agree about; and that is a reason, why Legal
Rights and Titles should not be the Rule and Measure of
our Obedience to Princes, who are possessed of the Throne;
but is this a reason to reject the Directions of <hi>Scripture</hi>
               <pb n="50" facs="tcp:50779:27"/>
too, because some Men will dispute the plainest <hi>Texts?</hi> This
has nothing but either <hi>Scepticism</hi> or <hi>Infallibility</hi> at the bot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tom.</p>
            <p>Our <hi>Author</hi> proceeds to consider the Scripture-Testimonies,<note place="margin">Postscript, <hi>p.</hi> 12.</note>
which I cite in this Cause. And <hi>First,</hi> from the Old Testa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment,
<hi>That God giveth Kingdoms to whomsoever he will; that he
removeth Kings, and setteth up Kings,</hi> 4. Dan. 17. 2. 21, 37.
Now the whole of his Answer to this, is, That Usurpers are
no Kings; and therefore, tho God removes Kings, and sets up
Kings, he does not set up Usurpers; and the whole of his proof is,
that <hi>Athaliah,</hi> who was an Usurper, was no Queen. As for
<hi>Athaliah,</hi> I suppose our <hi>Author</hi> has enough of her already; She
was God's Providential Queen, tho an Usurper, as much as
<hi>Baasha</hi> was God's King. And to say, That a King without a
Legal Title, or an Usurper, who has a setled Possession of the
Regal Power, is no King, is Nonsense. For Regal Power and
Authority makes a King,<note place="margin">Aug. de Civitate Dei, <hi>l. 5. c.</hi> 12.</note> as St. <hi>Austin</hi> tells us, <hi>Regnum Ã  Regi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bus,
Reges Ã  Regendo;</hi> that a Kingdom is so called from Kings,
and Kings from Governing; it is certain, he who has the Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ercise
of the Regal Power and Authority, is King, whether we
will call him so or no; and he is no King, who has no Regal
Power, whatever his Title be. If this be not so, our Laws are
Nonsense, which distinguish between a King <hi>de jure</hi> and <hi>de facto,</hi> if
a King <hi>de facto</hi> be no King, tho it signifies one who is actually
King.</p>
            <p>But pray, what Sense does this make of what the Prophet
<hi>Daniel</hi> says, That <hi>God changeth times and seasons, removeth Kings, and
setteth up Kings?</hi> By <hi>Kings</hi> here, according to our <hi>Author,</hi> the Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phet
means not Usurpers, but Rightful and Lawful Kings; and
then the meaning is, that God removeth, or pulleth down
Rightful Kings, and that he setteth up Rightful Kings. Now,
as for setting up Rightful Kings, our <hi>Author</hi> likes it very well;
but how does he like pulling down Rightful Kings, which is
as much against Law and Right, as to set up Kings without
Right? And that it seems God does. He will not allow us to
pay Allegiance to a King, who is set up without Right; will
he then allow us to withdraw our Allegiance from a Rightful
King, whom God has removed and pulled down? If he won't,
as it is plain he won't, then God can no more remove a
Rightful King, than he can set up an Illegal Usurper; but when
<pb n="51" facs="tcp:50779:27"/>
the Prophet says, God removeth Kings, and setteth up Kings,
to reconcile it to our <hi>Author</hi>'s <hi>Hypothesis,</hi> the removed King must
signifie an Usurper, and the King set up, a Rightful and Legal
King. I doubt not but our <hi>Author</hi> would be ashamed to say this;
but whether he be or no, he dares not say it; for then he
must allow, that <hi>King</hi> may signify an Usurper, as well as
a Rightful King, which overthrows all he says, for then it is
reasonable to expound the Text of all Kings, whatever they be,
who are removed or set up.</p>
            <p>And this is evidently the Prophet's meaning, to attribute all
the changes and revolutions of Government, when ever they
happened, not to Chance or Fate, but to the Divine Provi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence,
that whenever we see one King removed, and another
set up, whoever they be, they are removed and set up by God,
<hi>who ruleth in the kingdom of Men, and giveth it to whomsoever he
will;</hi> Does <hi>whomsoever</hi> signifie those only who have a legal
Right? Does <hi>giving</hi> suppose an antecedent right in him to
whom it is given? Does <hi>giving to whomsoever he will,</hi> signi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fie,
giving it only to those to whom the Law gives it? Do
we use to say, a Man may give his Estate to whom he will,
when his Estate is entailed, and he cannot alienate it from
the Right Heir? We should think this a very absurd way
of speaking among Men; and yet thus our <hi>Author</hi> must ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pound
God's giving a Kingdom to whomsoever he will, to
signify his giving the Kingdom to the Right Heir. He may,
if he please, call this Expounding Scripture; but I doubt every
body else will give it some other name, and I hope he him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>self
upon second thoughts will be ashamed of it.</p>
            <p>But it is more absurd still, if we apply it to the occasion,
<hi>viz.</hi> those great Revolutions and Changes of Empires, which
the <hi>Prophet</hi> foretold, and which he attributes to God; and
when Kingdoms and Empires are overturned by violence, it
is nonsence to talk of God's setting up only Rightful Kings,
not Usurpers; when all those Revolutions were nothing else
but force and Usurpation: Men may talk of Law and Right of
Succession in a setled Government, but Kingdoms are not
transferred, nor Kings removed, nor set up by Law; and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
when the <hi>Prophet</hi> tells us with respect to such violent
Revolutions, That God changes times and seasons, that he re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moveth
Kings and setteth up Kings, an ingenious Man must
<pb n="52" facs="tcp:50779:28"/>
be hard put to it, to say, This is not meant of Usurpers, but
of Rightful and Legal Kings; whereas if but one of these
must be meant, we must expound it of such Kings, who
ascend the Throne by Force and Usurpation; and if when
God is said to remove Kings, he will allow this to be meant
of Rightful Kings, who were legally possessed, I wonder how
he should fancy, that those Kings who dispossess the rightful
Kings, and place themselves in their Thrones, should in his sense
be legal and rightful Kings too.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>My Testimony from the New-Testament is,</hi> Rom. 13. 1, 2. Let
every Soul be subject to the higher powers, for all power is of
God. <hi>Now by Powers,</hi> our <hi>Author</hi> says, <hi>I understand Vsurped as
well as Lawful Powers:</hi> I do so; by <hi>Powers</hi> I understand the
Powers in a setled Government, whatever their Claim and
Title be: He says, <hi>this is contrary to the current of all good In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terpreters;</hi>
That I deny: I have shewn him already, that I
have Mr. <hi>Calvin</hi> and <hi>Grotius</hi> on my side, and the Convocation;
and if that will not satisfy him, it is no hard matter to pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duce
more.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>My Reason,</hi>
               <note place="margin">Case of. Alleg. <hi>p.</hi> 18.</note> 
               <hi>he says, is,</hi> Because the Scripture makes no di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stinction
between Kings, and Vsurpers. <hi>One of my Reasons is,</hi>
That the Scripture has given us no directions in this case, but to
submit and pay all the obedience of Subjects to the Present Powers.
It makes no distinction, that ever I could find, between rightful Kings,
and Vsurpers, between Kings whom we must, and whom we must
not obey. <hi>These last words he conceals, because they Spoil all
his Argument: For he adds,</hi> I thought the Case of <hi>Athaliah</hi>
had been a distinction; and had this precept been given in those days,
I wonder whether any body would have doubted of whom it ought to
be understood, of <hi>Athaliah</hi> or <hi>Joash.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>But the Answer is plain, There was a distinction between
<hi>Athaliah</hi> and <hi>Ioash,</hi> That She was an Usurper, and He the
Rightful King; and I hope our <hi>Author</hi> had not that mean
opinion of me, to think that I made no distinction between
an Usurper and a Rightful King, with respect to their Usur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pation
and their Right; but I say, the Scripture makes no
distinction between a Rightful King and an Usurper, with
respect to the Obedience of Subjects, while they are setled in
the Throne; the Scripture does not tell us, that there are
some Kings whom we must obey, and other Kings, <hi>viz.</hi>
               <pb n="53" facs="tcp:50779:28"/>
Kings by Usurpation, whom we must not obey: And with
reference to this, the Case of <hi>Athaliah</hi> is no example of such
a Distinction; for the <hi>Iews</hi> were not forbid either by the
standing Law of the Kingdom, or by <hi>Iehoiada,</hi> to submit to
<hi>Athaliah,</hi> while she was possessed of the Throne, and <hi>Ioash</hi>
was concealed; but they actually submitted to her, and are
no where blamed for it: That <hi>Iehoiada</hi> afterwards anointed
<hi>Ioash,</hi> and slew <hi>Athaliah,</hi> was owing to the Divine Entail of the
Crown, and was peculiar to <hi>Iudah,</hi> and affects no other Provi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dential
Kings, who are setled in their Thrones. So that had this
Law been given to the <hi>Iews</hi> at that time, while <hi>Ioash</hi> was concealed,
it must have been expounded of <hi>Athaliah,</hi> who had possession of the
Throne; when <hi>Ioash</hi> was known, and anointed, it must have been
expounded of him, as having a Divine Right to the Throne of
<hi>Iudah.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>He proceeds;</hi> But (saith the Doctor) if the Apostle had inten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded
such a distinction; he ought to have said it in express words;
and why so, I pray? <hi>I gave him a reason for it, which he is
pleased to conceal;</hi> Why should we think the Apostle here intends
a distinction unknown to Scripture? had there been any such Rule be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
given, to submit to Lawful Powers, but not to submit to Vsur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pers,
there had been some pretence of understanding St. <hi>Paul</hi>'s All
Power, of all Legal Power; but there being nothing like this
any where else in Scripture, if he had intended any such distinction,
he ought to have said it in express words, or else no body could rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sonably
have understood him to intend this Precept of subjection to the
Higher Powers, only of Powers that had a Legal Right. <hi>This I
thought a very good reason, and did not expect to have been
asked for more, till this had been answered.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>But,</hi> says our <hi>Author, does not the nature of the thing sufficiently
distinguish it?</hi> The nature of the thing distinguishes between a
Legal King, and a Usurper, but the nature of the thing
does not prove, that Usurped Powers are not the Higher
Powers, and ought not to be obeyed; but, I think, proves
the quite contrary. But <hi>are there not several Rules about Right
and Wrong, which extend to all Persons and Cases?</hi> Yes, there
are; such is the <hi>Apostle</hi>'s Rule in this <hi>Chapter, to give to every
one their due;</hi> but then the Question returns, What is their
due? Whether Obedience and Subjection be not due to the
Prince, who governs, not to the Prince who does not, and
<pb n="54" facs="tcp:50779:29"/>
cannot govern, whatever his Legal Right to the Govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
be?</p>
            <p>But because this Argument of <hi>Right,</hi> and our obligations to
do right to every man, especially to Princes, is that whereon
this Controversie turns, I shall particularly, but briefly con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sider
it.</p>
            <p>The Argument is this. He who by the Laws of the Land
has a right to the Crown, has a right to our Allegiance;
and whether he be in or out of possession, to own any other
King, to submit and pay Allegiance to any other, though
actually possessed of, and setled in the Throne, is great inju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stice
to our natural Prince, and a violation of that precept, <hi>To
give to every one their due.</hi> And whatever force and necessity we
are under, we must not do so wicked and unjust a thing, to
preserve our selves, nay, to preserve the Nation from ruine.</p>
            <p>This Objection has been answered more than once in my
Case of Allegiance; but because I find some men very unwil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling
to understand it, I will try whether I can set it in a clearer
light. Now here are two things to be considerred. 1. The
Right to the Crown. 2. The Right to Allegiance.</p>
            <p>As for the first, the fundamental prejudice and mistake seems
to be this, That men make no difference between a Legal Right
to the Crown, and the Legal Right of Subjects to their E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>states:
and therefore think it as wicked and unjust, for Subjects,
whatever their Circumstances are, to own any other Prince, but
the Legal Heir, as it would be for Tenants to pay their Rent to
any but their true Legal Lord. But I apprehend a great dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ference
between these two Cases, and it is this; That in set<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling
an Estate, there is nothing more required but a meer Hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mane
Right; but to make a Legal King, besides an Humane
Right to the Crown, he must have God's Authority. There
is nothing but a Legal Descent, and a Legal Possession, that gives
Right to a Legal Estate, and therefore the Law must have its
effect, and is the only adequate Rule of Right and Wrong in
such Cases. And though the Providence of God allots mens
private Fortunes; though he makes rich, and makes poor;
yet he gives no man a Right to an Estate, which he has got
by Fraud, Injustice and Violence; nor exempts them from Le<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gal
Punishments and Prosecutions; but leaves all such meer Le<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gal
Rights, under the general influence of his Providence, to the
care of publick Government.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="55" facs="tcp:50779:29"/>
But now if a meer Humane Right cannot make a King,
but it is God's Authority which makes a King; if God re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>serves
this Authority in his own hands, to the free disposal of
his own Sovereign Will and Counsel, and does not inseparably
annex it to Humane Entails of the Crown; if God's Authority,
without a Humane Right, can make a King, but Humane
Laws cannot make a King without God's Authority; this may
satisfy us, that when God thinks fit to interpose his Authority,
a meer Legal Right is not a sufficient reason to adhere to a Prince
whom God has removed from the Throne, nor the meer want of
a Legal Right, a sufficient reason to disown a Prince, whom God
has set upon the Throne: If meer Law made a King, as it makes
an Heir to an Estate, it were very unjust in Subjects to own any
but a Legal King; but if the Sovereign Authority of God can
remove a King, who has the Legal Right, and set up a King, who
has no Legal Right, then meer Humane Laws are not the only
Rules of Right and Wrong in this matter: and there is no rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son
to charge any man, who upon these Terms submits to a new
Prince, with the least injustice, either in disowning his old Le<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gal
Prince, or in submitting to a new one.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Secondly,</hi> As for the Right to Allegiance, it was the great design
of my <hi>Book</hi> to prove, that Allegiance is not immediately due to a
Legal Right to the Crown, but to Government; and therefore a
Prince, who has a Legal Right to the Throne, but has it not, can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not
have a Right to my Allegiance, till he gains the Throne; and I
deny him no Right which he can justly claim, tho I deny my Allegi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance
to him, while he is out of the Throne: And methinks our <hi>Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thor</hi>
should have answered all that I said upon this Argument, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
he had so dogmatically told us, That <hi>the general Rules about
Right and Wrong, which extend to all Persons and Cases,</hi> made it need<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>less
for St. <hi>Paul</hi> to have told us, That by the <hi>higher powers,</hi> and <hi>the
powers that are,</hi> he meant only <hi>Legal Powers;</hi> for if Illegal Powers,
in his Sense, may be the <hi>highter Powers,</hi> and <hi>the Powers, that at
present are,</hi> who have the actual administration of Government,
and Allegiance be immediately due only to the Governing Powers;
then notwithstanding <hi>the General Rules of Right and Wrong,</hi> the <hi>Apostle</hi>
might mean our <hi>Author's Illegal Powers.</hi> I am sure the Reason of things
does not prove the contrary; for when the Allegiance and Obedience
of Subjects, is a Duty only for the sake of Government, for the
ease and safety of it, it is very strange that it should not be due to a
setled Government, but due to a Prince who does not, and can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not
Govern.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="56" facs="tcp:50779:30"/>
And if I may have liberty to dispute with this <hi>Author</hi> upon his
own Principles, I desire to know of him, Whether Allegiance be
due to any Prince upon any other account, than his being invested
with God's Authority? let him say it is at the utmost peril of his
Cause. How then does God invest any Prince with his Authority
of Government, whom he does not immediately nominate, as he
did in the Kingdom of <hi>Iudah?</hi> it must be either by annexing his
Authority to the Legal Office, or by placing such a Person on the
Throne, by what means soever he does it, or by both: And then
it is certain no Prince can have God's Authority, who is not in
possession of the Throne, and then no Allegiance can be due to him.</p>
            <p>If God's Authority be annexed to the Regal Office, a Prince
must be in the actual Administration of the Regal Office and Power,
before he can have God's Authority: as a man must be actually
married, before he can have the Authority which the Divine
Laws give to a Husband. If God's setling a Prince in the Throne,
gives him this Authority, then no Prince who is removed from
the Throne, can have God's Authority: And this is agreeable to
the Language of Scripture, when God is said, to <hi>remove Kings, and set
up Kings,</hi> which when it does not signifie the express Revelation of
his Will, but the Acts of his Providence, can mean no more, than the
removing one King from the Throne, and placing another in it;
as it is elsewhere expressed, <hi>He pulleth down the mighty from their seat,
and exalteth the humble and meek.</hi> The truth is, <hi>The Authority of Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernment
is always God's Authority;</hi> and that is the Reason Bishop <hi>O<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veral</hi>'s
<hi>Convocation Book</hi> gives, why any degenerate Forms of Govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment,
when throughly setled, must be reverenced and obeyed; <hi>be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause
the Authority so unjustly gotten,</hi>
               <note place="margin">Convocat. <hi>Chap. 28 p.</hi> 57.</note> 
               <hi>or wrung by force from the true and
lawful Possessor, is always God's Authority;</hi> which they offer no proof
at all of, but what is supposed in their Reason, that the Authority
of Government, when it is once setled, is God's Authority; and
then how those Princes, who, whatever their Right be, have no
Authority of Government, should have God's Authority, I cannot
guess: For to call a Right to the Crown, the Authority of Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernment,
is contrary to the Sense of Mankind, when they speak
of Sovereign Princes: for he has the Actual Authority, who ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tually
administers the Government; and it is Actual Authority,
which is God's Authority, not Authority in Fancy and <hi>Idea;</hi> for
God does not give Authority to govern, without the Power of
Government, which is a very fruitless and insignificant Autho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="57" facs="tcp:50779:30"/>
But to proceed, our <hi>Author</hi> proves by a parallel Case, that St.
<hi>Paul</hi> by the <hi>Higher Powers</hi> could mean only <hi>Lawful Powers, for the
Apostle exhorts</hi> (13. Hebr. 17.) <hi>Obey them that have rule over you,
meaning the Ministers of the Gospel; now the Apostle makes no distin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
between lawful Ministers and Intruders,</hi> and yet we must under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stand
it of lawful Ministers; and by the same reason, though St.
<hi>Paul</hi> makes no distinction between lawful and unlawful Powers,
yet he means only lawful Powers; for this is the force of his Argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment,
though he has not expressed it.</p>
            <p>But these Cases are by no means parallel. For the Apostle to
the <hi>Hebrews</hi> had no reason to make any such distinction, which
yet was necessary for St. <hi>Paul</hi> to have done, had he intended his
Precept of Obedience, should be understood only of lawful Powers.</p>
            <p>The <hi>Apostle</hi> to the <hi>Hebrews</hi> knew, who had the rule over them
at that time, that they were lawful Ministers, and exhorts the
<hi>Hebrews</hi> to obey them; and had he added such a distinction, it
would have insinuated, that he knew some among them, who
were not lawful Ministers, and such a Suggestion without naming
the Persons, would have made them jealous of them all, and spoil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
his Exhortation of obeying them: The <hi>Hebrews</hi> knew whom
St. <hi>Paul meant</hi> by those, who had the Rule over them, St. <hi>Paul</hi>
knew, they were such as ought to be obeyed; and therefore there
was no need here of any distinction between lawful Pastors, and
Intruders. But St. <hi>Paul</hi> gives a general Charge <hi>to be subject to the
higher Powers,</hi> and generally affirms, that <hi>all power is of God,</hi> and
therefore if he had not intended, that we should understand this as
universally as he expresses it, <hi>of all Powers,</hi> however they came by
their Power, he should have limited it to legal and rightful Powers.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>He adds,</hi> In short, the Dr's Reason is against him. There has ever
been a distinction in the World between Legal and Usurped Powers, and
'tis probable enough that St. <hi>Paul</hi> (who was so learned a Man) knew
it, and if he had intended to enjoin Obedience to Usurped Powers, 'tis
probable he would have said so in express terms, but since be never said
so, we have reason to conclude he never intended it.</p>
            <p>Now I doubt not but St. <hi>Paul</hi> did know this distinction between
Legal and Usurped Powers, and knew also, that the <hi>Pharisees</hi> made
this Objection against their Submission to the <hi>Romans,</hi> and for that
reason he affirms, that <hi>all power is of God,</hi> and that they must be
subject to the <hi>Higher Powers,</hi> without any distinction; which he
would not have done, if any distinction ought to have been made;
when he knew the dispute was about the <hi>Romans,</hi> whom they look<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
<pb n="58" facs="tcp:50779:31"/>
upon as Usurpers over <hi>Israel,</hi> who were God's peculiar People
and Inheritance: and yet though there was a distinction between
Legal and Usurped Powers, there was no distinction made in
point of Obedience to them, but only by the <hi>Pharisees;</hi> and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
with respect to the rest of the World, he ought to have made
this distinction in express words, if he intended any distinction
should have been made.</p>
            <p>I have insisted the longer on this, because it gives a full Answer
to his next Objection;<note place="margin">Postscripe P. 13.</note> that the Interpretation I give of the <hi>Convo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cation
Book, justifies an unreasonable and impious Doctrine, by making
the Acts or Permissions of Providence a Rule for practice, against Right
and Iustice.</hi> Now this, I confess, is a very unreasonable and im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pious
Doctrine, and were I sensible, that any thing I have said,
would justifie this Doctrine, I would immediately renounce it;
but I hope when our <hi>Author</hi> considers again, that I have evidently
proved, that the Interpretation I have given, is the true Sense of
the <hi>Convocation,</hi> he will be more favorable to it, for their sakes.
But I have already stated this matter about Right and Justice, and
have shewn the difference between the Right of private Men to
their Estates, and of Princes to their Thrones, and to the Allegi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance
of Subjects; between a Thief's taking a Purse, and an U<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>surper
a Crown, <hi>by the Providence of God;</hi> between the Provi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence
of God in such matters, as he refers to the Correction and
Redress of publick Laws, and publick Government, and what he
reserves to his own cognizance and disposal, as he does the Revo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lutions
of Government, the removing Kings, and the setting up
Kings.</p>
            <p>The truth is, our <hi>Author</hi> writes at that rate, that it is to be feared,
some People will suspect, that he does not believe a Providence,
or does not understand it, or has a mind to ridicule it. For let
me ask him, does God make Kings in <hi>England,</hi> or not? if he does
(which I hope our <hi>Author</hi> will grant, or he renounces the <hi>jure di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vino</hi>
with a witness) how does he make Kings? He sends no Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phets
among us to anoint Kings, and to tell us, whom he has no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minated
to Reign over us, and therefore he can make Kings no
other way among us, but by the Events of Providence: and how
does God make Kings by his Providence? truly this can be done
no other way, but by placing them in the Throne, and set<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling
them there with the general Consent and Submission of the
People: does then this Providential Settlement in the Throne,
which makes a King, invest such a King with God's Anthority?
<pb n="59" facs="tcp:50779:31"/>
if it does not, then it seems God makes a King without giving him
his Authority, makes a King without any Authority to govern,
which is a Contradiction; if he does, does not this make it the
duty of Subjects to obey such a King? Are not Subjects bound to
obey such Kings, as have God's Authority?</p>
            <p>Again, suppose a Prince ascends the Throne, and obtains the
Consent and Submission of the People, by the most unjust force,
and the most ungodly Arts, that can be thought on, who places
such a Prince on the Throne, if God don't? Our <hi>Author</hi> accord<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
to his Principles must answer, that by God's Permission he
Usurps the Throne, but is no King, much less a King of God's
making. Well, let him call him King, or Usurper, or what he
pleases, but it seems a Prince may ascend the Throne, and govern
a Kingdom for many years (it may be a hundred years, for so
long a Prescription our <hi>Author</hi> requires to give a Just Title to an
Usurper) without God's Authority; and then I desire to know,
whether God Rules in such a Kingdom, while an Usurper fills the
Throne; The reason of the question is plain, because the Prophet
<hi>Daniel</hi> pronounces universally, <hi>that God ruleth in the Kingdom of men,</hi>
and as a proof of it adds, <hi>and giveth it to whomsoever he will,</hi> and
then it should seem, that God does not Rule in these Kingdoms,
which he does not dispose of by his own Will and Counsel, which
he does not give to whom he will, but suffers Usurpers to take the
Government of them. For indeed will any Man say, that God
governs such a Kingdom, as is not governed by his Authority, or
Minister? Does Providence and Government signifie only his Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mission?
that God looks on, and sees Men snatch at Crowns, and
take them, and keep them, and exercise an Authority, which he,
who is the universal Lord of the World, never gave them? To re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>solve
Providence into a bare Permission, especially in matters
of such vast Consequence, as the disposal of Crowns, is to deny
God's Government of the World.</p>
            <p>But it is objected, that to say, that Prosperous Usurpers, when
they are setled in the Throne, are placed there by God, and have
his Authority, is to make God a Party to their Wickedness. Now
this is another Argument, not merely against God's making Kings,
but in general against God's Providence and Government of the
World: for if God cannot direct and over-rule the Wickedness of
Men to accomplish his own Wise Counsels and Purposes, without
being the <hi>Author</hi> of those Sins, whereby such Events are brought
to pass, there is an end of the Providence of God, or of his Holi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness
<pb n="60" facs="tcp:50779:32"/>
and Justice; for the most glorious designs of God's Grace and
Providence, have been accomplished by very wicked means, even
the Crucifixion of our <hi>Saviour</hi> himself.</p>
            <p>But to confine my self to our present Case of transferring King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>doms
and Empires, as it was in the four Monarchies. It is possi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble
this may sometimes be done by very honest means, but it is com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monly
done by great Injustice and Violence in Men, and yet God
very just and righteous in doing it.</p>
            <p>No Man, I suppose, will deny, but that God, as the Supreme
Lord and Sovereign of the World, may give the Kingdoms of the
World to whom he pleases, without doing Injustice to any Prince,
who can have no Right but by his Gift: No Man will deny, but
that God may be very just and righteous in removing some Prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces
from their Thrones, and in setting up others: And then the
Translation of Kingdoms, the pulling down one Prince, and set<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting
up another, is no act of Injustice with God; but is his Prero<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gative
<hi>as the King of Kings,</hi> and when it is done for wise, and holy,
and just Reasons, (as we ought always to presume of what God
does) is a plain Demonstration of the Wisdom, and Holiness,
and Justice of his Providence.</p>
            <p>The only dispute then can be, about God's bringing such Events
to pass by the Wickedness of Men; and what hurt is there in this,
if God can so over-rule the Ambition of Princes, or the Faction
and Rebellion of Subjects, as to do that in pursuit of their own
lusts, which God for wise and holy Reasons, thinks fit to have
done: It cannot be denied, but that God does permit Men to do
very wickedly, and if he can permit the Wickedness of Men with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out
being guilty of their Sins, I hope to direct and over-rule their
Wickedness to wise purposes, to bring Good out of Evil, and Or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der
out of Confusion, can be no blemish to Providence. indeed
I should be much puzzled to justifie the Divine Providence, in per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitting
the Sins of Men, especially such Sins, as do great mischief
to the World, were I not very well satisfied, that God over-rules
all to wise and good Ends.</p>
            <p>Let us suppose an Ambitious Prince spurred on with Fame and
Glory to grasp at an Universal Empire; our <hi>Author</hi> will not say,
but that God may permit this Man, to ravage and depopulate
Countries, to pull Princes from their Thrones, and to bring their
Kingdoms into Subjection to himself: such Men there are in all
Ages, did not God think fit to restrain them, and to fling Diffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culties
in their ways to make them tame and quiet. Now I would
<pb n="61" facs="tcp:50779:32"/>
ask any Man, which most becomes the Divine Wisdom, to suffer
such Men when they please to overturn Kingdoms, and to bring
horrible Desolations on the World, only to gratifie their own
Lusts; or to give the Reigns, and to give prosperous Success to
them, when he sees fit to new model the World, to pull down such
a Prince, or to chastise and correct such a Nation: I am sure this
much more becomes the Wisdom and Justice of Providence, than
a bare permission of such Violence, without any farther design,
which does not become the Wise Governor of the World. And if
God may permit such Wickedness and Violence without contribu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting
to their Sin, or being a Party to their Wickedness; much
more may he over-rule their Wickedness for wise Ends, make them
the Executioners of his Justice in punishing a wicked Age, and trans<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferring
Kingdoms; and then why may not God give them those
Kingdoms, which he has overturned by them? for I suppose, it is as
agreeable to the Sovereignty, Wisdom and Justice of God, to give a
Kingdom to a violent Usurper, as to suffer a wicked, impious, ty<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rannical
Prince to ascend the Throne, with a legal Title: and yet
this God often does, witness many of the <hi>Roman</hi> Emperors, whom
I know our <hi>Author</hi> will have to be legal Princes; and those who
will not allow them to be legal Princes, need not want Examples of
this nature in Hereditary Kingdoms.</p>
            <p>But our <hi>Author</hi> says, that to own an Usurper, who is setled in
the Throne by Providence, and to obey and submit to him as our
King, <hi>justifies an unreasonable and wicked Doctrine, by making the
Acts or Permissions of Providence, a Rule for practice against Right
and Justice;</hi> as for his <hi>Right and Iustice,</hi> it has been considered al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ready,
let us now consider how far the Providence of God may be
<hi>the Rule for practice.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>It is indeed an impious Doctrine to justifie every Action, and
every Cause which has success; God many times prospers very e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vil
Designs, when he can serve a good End by them; and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
to measure the good or evil of things by external success, to
conclude, that is God's Cause, which the Providence of God pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>spers,
confounds the difference of good and evil, and destroys all
the standing Rules of Right and Justice: but yet it is so far from
being an impious Doctrine, that it is a necessary Duty, to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>form
our selves to the Divine Providence, and to discharge those
Duties and Obligations, which the Providence of God lays on us,
according to the Nature and Intention of the Providence: and
thus the Providence of God in some sense may be the Rule of our
<pb n="62" facs="tcp:50779:33"/>
Practice, and may make that our Duty, which was not, and that
cease to be our Duty, which was our Duty before: and thus it al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ways
is when the Providence of God changes our Relations, or
Condition of Life; as to mention only our present Case, when he
removes one King, and sets up another; for he must transfer my
Allegiance, when he changes my King.</p>
            <p>The truth is, as far as I can perceive, the great, if not the only
fault of my Case of Allegiance, is this <hi>unreasonable and impious Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrine</hi>
of Providence: for some Men cannot endure to hear, that
God makes Kings by his Providence, for that argues there is a
God; others cannot bear the thoughts, that Kings Reign by God's
Authority, for then they cannot make and unmake Kings, as they
please; others will by no means allow, that the Providence of God
can make a King against the Laws of the Land, can remove a
rightful King, and set up a King without a legal Title, at least
not without the death or cession of the rightful King, or a hun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dred
years Prescription; but to say, that the Providence of God
gives his Authority to a King <hi>de facto,</hi> who is setled in the Throne;
this is <hi>an impious Doctrine.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>So that had I left out Providence, I might have had fairer quar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
on all hands, though in effect the thing had been the same,
and I had taught the same thing, <hi>viz.</hi> that when a rightful King
is dispossessed, Subjects may own and submit to the King, who is
setled in the possession of the Throne, which is all I undertook
to prove.</p>
            <p>Had I only said, that Conquest in a just War, by the Law of
Nations, gives a Right to the Conqueror, though the former King
be alive, and has made his Escape. Had I only said, that unjust
Force and Violence makes it lawful for Subjects to submit, when
the Prince cannot protect them, and such Submission and Consent
of the People settles a Prince in the Kingdom, I might have es<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>caped
very well, as others have done.</p>
            <p>Or had I only said, that the Laws of the Land allow and require
Subjects to pay Allegiance to a King <hi>de facto</hi> in possession of the
Crown, most of our <hi>Non-swearers</hi> themselves would have allow'd
this a good Plea, could I have persuaded them it was true; for
the Laws of the Land they must allow to be the rules and mea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sures
of our Allegiance.</p>
            <p>But now to add, that God by all these ways and means makes
Kings, and settles them on their Thrones, and gives his Authority
to them, this spoils all, and is an <hi>impious Doctrine:</hi> that is, any of
<pb n="63" facs="tcp:50779:33"/>
these waies will make very good Kings without God; but it is
a very wicked thing to say, that God makes them Kings, or gives
his Authority to them: For it is a dangerous thing to allow,
that God makes Kings, or that Kings have his Authority, or that
the Providence of God does not barely permit, but Govern all
the Changes and Revolutions of the World.</p>
            <p>But I had learnt from Scripture (and <hi>B.</hi> Overal'<hi>s Convocation
Book</hi> proves, that those learned Men were of the same mind) that
Kings are made only by God, and that it is God's Authority,
which makes them Kings; and therefore I could not think it
enough to say by what visible means Princes are advanced to the
Throne, without adding, that the Providence of God by these
means settles them in the Throne, and gives his Authority to
them, on which the true resolution of Conscience depends in
all such Revolutions: And if this be my only fault, that I assert
the Right and Prerogative of God in making Kings, and the
Wisdom and government of Providence in all the Revolutions
of States and Empires, I am contented to suffer obloquy and
reproach for maintaining such <hi>Impious Doctrines.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>Our</hi> Author in his Answer <hi>has another Argument to prove, that
we misrepresent the Sense of the</hi> Convocation, <hi>which he has thought
fit to leave out in his</hi> Postscript,<note place="margin">Ans. p 21, 22.</note> 
               <hi>viz. That</hi> the Interpretation we
give of it, is inconsistent with the main and Fundamental Doctrines
of the Convocation Book, viz. Passive Obedience and Non-resistance.</p>
            <p>But if the Convocation taught both (as they certainly did) it
is a sign, that whatever our <hi>Author</hi> thinks, or whatever he can
prove, the <hi>Convocation</hi> did not apprehend any inconsistency be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween
them. I observed in <hi>the Case, that the Doctrine of Obedience
and Allegiance to the Present Powers,</hi>
               <note place="margin">Case of Al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leg. p. 36.</note> 
               <hi>is founded on the same Princi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple
with the Doctrine of Non-resistance and Passive Obedience,</hi> viz.
<hi>That God makes Kings and Invests them with his Authority, which
equally proves, that all Kings who have received a Sovereign Autho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity
from God, must be Obeyed, and must not be Resisted:</hi> And there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
all setled Governments, as the <hi>Convocation</hi> asserts, having their
Authority from God, must be obeyed, for the same reason, for
which we must not resist Sovereign Princes, <hi>viz.</hi> because they
have their Authority from God; but this our <hi>Author</hi> thought fit
to pass over.</p>
            <p>For it is a plain Case, that <hi>Non-resistance</hi> and <hi>Passive Obedience,</hi>
can be due only to him who is our King, and if God can re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>move
one King, and set up another, <hi>Non-resistance</hi> must be Due,
<pb n="64" facs="tcp:50779:34"/>
not to the King, whom God has pulled down, but to the King
whom God has set up; and therefore he may harangue as long
as he pleases upon this Argument to no purpose, unless he can
prove, that God hath not pulled down one King and set up ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther.</p>
            <p>His next Argument against this Interpretation of the <hi>Convoca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
Book</hi> is this: That <hi>it reproaches the Virtue and Loyalty of those
admirable Men, who Suffered between the Years 42. and</hi> 60. And
therefore this cannot be the Sense of the <hi>Convocation;</hi> for no
doubt the <hi>Convocation</hi> in 603. had great regard to the Loyalty
of those who Suffered between 42. and 60; by a Spirit of Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phesie
I suppose.</p>
            <p>And here our <hi>Author</hi> grows very angry, both in his <hi>Answer</hi>
and <hi>Postscript,</hi> and gives many hard and spightful Words to his
Adversaries, but be that to himself, I am resolved not to be angry.</p>
            <p>This I answered at large in the <hi>Case of Allegiance,</hi> (p. 46. <hi>&amp;c.)</hi>
and shall now take a brief review of it.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>I said,</hi> it is a great Prejudice but no Argument; for if these Principles
be true, and according to these Principles they might have complied with
those Usurpations, that they did not, is no confutation of the Principles.</p>
            <p>He answers,<note place="margin">Post. p. 14.</note> 
               <hi>I thought an Argument from Example had been an
Argument, though not always a very good one;</hi> Right! but Example
is only a Prejudice, not an Argument against plain Reasons, which
cannot otherwise be answered; let Reasons be first answered, and
then when there is no Reason against a thing, the Examples of
great and wise Men without any other Reason carry some Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thority
with them: especially when we have other good Reasons
for doing any thing, Example gives some new strength to them;
and thus the Example of <hi>Iaddus</hi> may be an Argument, when o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
Examples are none: though he knows the Example of <hi>Iad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dus</hi>
was alledged by me only to prove the sense of the <hi>Convocation,</hi>
and how <hi>Iaddus</hi> himself understood his Oath of Allegiance to <hi>Da<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rius,</hi>
which is a very different Case from what he urges.</p>
            <p>But to let pass his transport of Zeal, and to forgive the froth
and folly of it, when he urges the Examples of these great Men,
there are many things he ought to have considered.</p>
            <p>As 1. He should have considered whom he reproach'd in all
this as well as whom he commended. He reproaches all those,
who in those times of Confusion submitted to the Usurped Pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers,
and lived quietly and peaceably under them, and yet the
King found a great many true Friends, and Loyal Persons, at his
<pb n="65" facs="tcp:50779:34"/>
return among those Men: He reproaches all those Loyal Persons
both of the Nobility, Gentry, and Clergy, who suffered chear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fully
under those <hi>Usurpations,</hi> and as chearfully comply with the
present <hi>Revolution,</hi> which, as I observed before, is an Argument,
that they make a great difference between these two Cases: But
if as our <hi>Authour</hi> argues, to justifie our present Submission and
Compliance be to reproach those <hi>Worthies,</hi> who suffered for their
King in that horrid Rebellion and Usurpation; then he must
upon his Principles accuse those <hi>Worthies,</hi> who suffered for their
King then, with falling from their Loyalty, by their present Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pliance.
He reproaches all the Nobility, Gentry, and Clergy,
who have now Sworn Allegiance to their present <hi>Majesties;</hi> and
tho the Clergy, he says, are only a Company of <hi>Weather-Cock Divines,</hi>
and therefore it is no great matter for them, yet I doubt the No<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bility
and Genty will not take it well from him, to be thought
<hi>Weather-Cocks,</hi> or less Loyal, than those who suffered for K. <hi>Charles</hi>
were. And if it moves our <hi>Author's Indignation to see the Worthies
of the World, and of our Church mocked and diminished, and repre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sented
as Fools and Knaves</hi> (which no body has done but himself)
a much cooler Man than he is, may be a little moved, if not
with Indignation, yet with Contempt, to see all our present <hi>Wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thies</hi>
in Church and State so maliciously libelled.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>2ly.</hi> If our <hi>Authour</hi> will argue from Examples, he ought not
only to consider what was done, but upon what Principles they
did it, whether they were all of our <hi>Authour</hi>'s mind, that it is ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>solutely
unlawful in any Case whatsoever, to submit to a Prince,
who is possessed of the Throne, while the legal King, or his true
Heir is living, tho dispossessed. It is probable some few might
be of this mind; but that this was their general sense, can never
be proved; and that it was, is very improbable; for it was neither
the Doctrine of the Church, nor the Law of the Land: And
yet if our <hi>Authour</hi> cannot prove this, he proves nothing to his pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pose;
if they did not act upon his Principles, though they suffer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
for their King then, they might have complied now, as some
of them have done, and yet don't think they have recounced the
true Principles of Loyalty by it.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>3ly.</hi> When he resolved to argue from Example, he should have
carefully considered, whether there are not more and greater
Examples on the other side, whether supposing the Case to be as
he represents it, there be any thing like it in all Story, either
sacred or profane, whether both <hi>Iews</hi> and <hi>Christians</hi> did not al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ways
submit to the present Powers, when the Government was
<pb n="66" facs="tcp:50779:35"/>
settled by what wicked means soever it began: But I shall not
enter upon this Argument now, which will be managed by a
more learned Pen.</p>
            <p>I shewed what a vast difference there was between the late
times of Rebellion and Usurpation, and this present Revolution;
this he cannot deny, but says, it makes no difference in the Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gument;
let us then try that.</p>
            <p>But to state the matter so plain, that our <hi>Authour</hi> himself, had
he never so much mind to it, shall not be able to mistake or mis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>represent
it, I must first premise, that they are two very differ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ent
Questions, as I have observed above, When it is lawful to sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mit
to Usurping Powers? and, When it becomes a Duty to do it?
It is lawful to submit, when we are under such force as can com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pell
us; it is our Duty to submit, when, as the <hi>Convocation</hi> says,
the Government is <hi>throughly settled;</hi> now while we are in this state,
that we are under mere force, but the Government not setled,
we may either submit or not submit without Sin; and then that
which must turn the Scale, are Arguments from Interest.</p>
            <p>Now, what I said upon this occasion in the Case of Allegiance,
had reference to both these, <hi>viz.</hi> That Subjects were not in those
days bound in Conscience to submit to these usurped Powers, and
not being bound in Conscience to do it, there were many reasons
which might move the Royal Party not to do it.</p>
            <p>Now this is so far from lessening and reproaching their Loyalty,
that it is greatly for the Commendation of it; that when they
were not bound in Conscience to submit to those Usurpations,
tho by Submission, our <hi>Authour</hi> intimates, they might have made
better Terms for themselves, yet they rather chose to venture
their Lives and Fortunes to restore the King, which is not, as our
<hi>Authour</hi> insinuates, <hi>to prefer their Interest to their Conscience</hi> in serv<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
the King; but where Conscience was not concerned to the
contrary, to venture their Interest<g ref="char:punc">âª</g> their Lives and Fortunes, to
restore the King. Tho Men are but Men, and if what I said be
true, that there were many Reasons which touched their Inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ests,
why they should not submit to those Usurpations; I cannot
see what Dishonour it is to them, to say that it may be supposed,
that the utmost Despair under a violent Usurpation, and the on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
possible prospect of bettering their Condition by the return of
the King, might, not influence their Consciences, but inspire and
quicken their Loyalty.</p>
            <p>Now that they were not bound in Conscience to submit to those
Usurpers, I proved, because their Government was never setled;
<pb n="67" facs="tcp:50779:35"/>
and tho the <hi>Convocation</hi> does not deny the lawfulness of submit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting
to Power before a Settlement, yet they do not make it a ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cessary
Duty, and matter of Conscience to submit, till the Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernment
is throughly setled.</p>
            <p>The <hi>Convocation</hi> alledges two ways, whereby a Government
wickedly and unjustly begun, may be throughly setled, <hi>viz.</hi> By
a general Submission, or by Continuance; that they had not
continuance enough to make a Settlement, I proved, because the
Government <hi>was frequently changed and new moddelled, which was
no Argument of Settlement;</hi> and as for Settlement by a general
Submission, they could not pretend to that, for they <hi>never had a
National Consent and Submission.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>That they had no such National consent, needs not be pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved
to any Man, who remembers the story of those days. I
suppose no man will pretend such a consent to the Government
of the <hi>Rump-Parliament,</hi> when all the Representatives of the Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
were flung out of the House, excepting those few <hi>Rumpers,</hi>
because they would not consent.</p>
            <p>Nor will it be pretended that <hi>Cromwells</hi> Dissolving the <hi>Rump-Parliament,</hi>
and summoning some select Persons out of every
<hi>County,</hi> nominated by himself and his <hi>Council</hi> of <hi>Officers,</hi> with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out
any Election of the People, to be the Representative of the
Nation, had a National consent: Nor had the Council of State
chosen by this Mock-House of Parliament, any greater Autho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity
than their Masters; nor did their Resignation of their Power
to <hi>Cromwell</hi> again give any Authority to him, or carry a Natio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal
Consent with it.</p>
            <p>Nor will it be pretended, that the <hi>Instrument of Government,</hi> a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>greed
on by <hi>Cromwell</hi> and his <hi>Officers,</hi> which made <hi>Cromwell
Lord Protector</hi> of the Three Nations, had any National Consent:
It is plain, it had no National Consent in framing it, and it
is as plain, that it was never afterwards confirmed by any Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tional
Consent and Submission.</p>
            <p>The <hi>Parliaments</hi> called according to the directions of this <hi>In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>strument,</hi>
never could make a National Consent or Submission;
for they were not chosen according to the ancient Customs
and Usages of the Nation, nor were they the <hi>Representatives</hi> of
the Nation, but only of a prevailing Party and Faction in it; for
by <hi>Article</hi> 14.<note place="margin">
                  <hi>Whit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lock</hi>'s Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>morials, <hi>p.</hi> 555.</note> it is provided, <hi>That all and every Person and Persons,
who have aided, advised, assisted, or abetted in any War against the
Parliament, since the first day of</hi> Jan. 1641. <hi>(unless they have been since
in the Service of the Parliament, and given signal Testimonies of their

good Affections thereunto) shall be disabled, and be uncapable to be ele<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cted,
or to give any Vote in the Election of any Members to serve in the
new Parliament, or in the three succeeding Triennial Parliaments.</hi> So
that a great part of the Nation were hereby wholly excluded from
choosing, or being chosen Members of Parliament: When they
were thus chosen, this Election did not make them Parliament-Men,
unless <hi>they were approved of by the major part of the Council,
to be Persons not disabled, but qualified as aforesaid.</hi> Artic. 21. When
they were thus chosen and approved, they had no Authority to
reject this new <hi>Model,</hi> but it is provided, <hi>Art. 12. That the Persons
elected shall not have power to alter the Government, as it is hereby set<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led
in one single Person and a Parliament.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>The</hi> first Parliament <hi>met</hi> Sept. 3. 54. <hi>and began to be very busie
about the new Government,</hi>

                  <hi>Ibid.</hi> p. 587.</note> 
               <hi>but the</hi> Protector <hi>sent for them to the</hi>
Painted Chamber, <hi>and taught them better,</hi> that the same Govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
that made them a Parliament, made him Protector, and that as
they are intrusted with some things, so is he with other things. That
there were some thing in the Government fundamental, and could not
be altered <hi>(tho this</hi> Instrument <hi>had no other Authority but his own,
and his</hi> Council <hi>of</hi> Officers) <hi>as</hi> 1. That the Government should be in
one Person, and a Parliament,âand therefore he was sorry to under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stand
that any of them should go about to overthrow what was so setled,
<hi>(it seems then this</hi> Parliament <hi>at the beginning was so far from
giving their Submission and Consent, that they were about to
overthrow this new Settlement)</hi> and to prevent such great Inconve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niences,
he was necessitated to appoint a Test, or Recognition of the Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernment,
which was to be signed by them, before they went any more
into the House, <hi>and it was this,</hi>
            </p>
            <p>I <hi>A. B.</hi> do hereby freely promise and engage my self to be true and
faithful to the Lord Protector, and to the Common-wealth of <hi>England,
Scotland,</hi> and <hi>Ireland,</hi> and shall not (according to the tenor of the
Indenture whereby I am returned to serve in this present Parliament)
propose or give any Consent to alter the Government, as it is setled in
one single Person and a Parliament. <hi>That day 130 Members sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>scribed
it, and took their Places in the House, how many more
did afterwards is not said.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>And yet this very <hi>Parliament</hi> spent near five Months in their de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bates
about the new Government, and the <hi>Protector</hi> was glad to
dissolve them at last; and this does not look like a National Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mission
and Consent: especially considering the <hi>Plot,</hi> which was
ready to break out upon it, and <hi>the Declaration of the free and well<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>affected
People of</hi> England,<note place="margin">
                  <hi>Ibid.</hi> p. 600.</note> 
               <hi>now in Arms against the Tyrant</hi> Oliver
Cromwell.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="69" facs="tcp:50779:36"/>
In the <hi>second Parliament Sept.</hi> 1656. many Persons who were re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turned
by the Country for Members were not admitted into the
<hi>House,</hi> as not approved by the <hi>Council,</hi> which occasioned their
publishing a <hi>Remonstrance,</hi>
               <note place="margin">
                  <hi>Ibid.</hi> p. 640.</note> subscribed by near one hundred of them,
the reading of which will satisfie any man, how far that new Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernment
was from having a National Consent and Submission.
But this is enough for my present purpose, to shew that those Usur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pations
were never setled by a National Submission and Consent,
but all the settlement they had was mere force: and now let us
hear what our <hi>Author</hi> says to this.</p>
            <p>As <hi>for the Government being frequently changed,</hi>
               <note place="margin">
                  <hi>Postscript</hi> p. 15.</note> he says, <hi>every one
of these changes was a settlement, if the Dr's notion of a settlement be
right:</hi> but it is plain according to my notion none of them were
settlements; for none of them had the general Consent and Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mission
of the People; and though the Power of the Nation was
for some time in their hands, the continuance of none of these
changes was long enough to make a Settlement by Prescription
without Consent.</p>
            <p>He adds. <hi>But as the National Consent in Parliament, that is indeed
part of our Constitution, but what is that to Usurpation, which may
Usurp as well upon all Branches of the Constitution as upon one.</hi> But I
do not urge <hi>a National Consent in Parliament,</hi> considered as part of
our <hi>Constitution,</hi> but barely considered as <hi>a National Consent,</hi> for a
National Consent and Submission is necessary to the settlement of
any new Government, and this must be declared by one means
or other. The Consent of a Parliament freely chosen by the Bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy
of the People, must be allowed to be a National Consent, and
that Consent the present Government has: but where there is no
Consent in Parliament, in a Nation which never gives their con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sent
any other way but by their Representatives, when a Govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
dares not call such a Parliament, nor ask their consent, or if
they do ask, are denied it; it is evident there is no National Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sent.
What he says indeed is true, that <hi>had</hi> Cromwell <hi>possessed him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>self
of the Authority of Kings, Lords and Commons;</hi> had he been <hi>set<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led</hi>
in this Possession by the general Consent and Submission of the
People; <hi>he had had God's Authority in all those respects, and ought to
have been obeyed;</hi> but without such a Consent, though the People might
for a while have silently submitted to Power, they were at liberty
to cast off the Yoke, when they had power and opportunity to do
it. This is my Notion of a <hi>thorough Settlement,</hi> to which he appeals;
and let any Man <hi>try, whether (as</hi> he says) <hi>it will fit</hi> Cromwell <hi>in
all respects, just as if it had been made for him,</hi> viz. <hi>When the whole
<pb n="70" facs="tcp:50779:37"/>
Administration of Government, and the whole Power of the Nation is
in the hands of the Prince, when every thing is done in his Name, and
by his Authority;</hi> had I added no more, the <hi>Author</hi> might have pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tended,
that the Government of the <hi>Rump-Parliament,</hi> and of
<hi>Oliver Cromwell</hi> had this Settlement, but what follows spoils this
Conceit, <hi>when the Estates of the Realm, and the great Body of the
Nation has submitted to him.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>So that here was no such Settlement of these Usurpations, as
could oblige Subjects in Conscience to obey them and to submit
to them; and when it was not matter of Duty and Conscience
to submit, I shewed that there were other very great Reasons, why
they should not submit; not such Reasons as ought to have over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ruled
their Consciences, had it been matter of Duty, for there are
no such Reasons to be had, but such as were very reasonable and
almost invincible Prejudices against Submission, when Conscience
was not concerned; and this answers all his little Objections.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>As,</hi> 1. The great Villanies of those days in an open and bare-fac'd
Rebellionâand in the barbarous Murder of one of the best Princes in
the Worldâ<hi>this, he says,</hi> makes no difference in my Arguments. What!
not to prejudice wise and good Men against all Compliances? For who
that could possibly avoid it, <hi>(that is, where strict Duty does not ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lige,
nor irresistible Force constrain)</hi> would submit to such Men?</p>
            <p>2. <hi>The barbarous usage the Kings Friends met with.</hi> This he con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fesses
<hi>makes some difference in point of Interest, but none in point of
Conscience;</hi> nor did I say it did, but it justly created a great Aversi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
to those Usurpations, and was a reason not to submit, when
they were not obliged in Conscience to do it, since all the Inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>est
they had in the World engaged them, not to settle by their
Submissions, but to do all they could to overturn those Usurpa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions.</p>
            <p>3. <hi>The Church of</hi> England <hi>was overturned,</hi> Bishops, Deans, <hi>&amp;c.</hi>
turned out, and their Lands and Revenues sold; the Loyal Clergy were
Malignants for what they had done, and had no way to keep their Liv<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings,
but by renouncing the Church of <hi>England.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>To this he answers; <hi>the Case is concerning Civil Government, not
Ecclesiastical.</hi> But yet whoever loves the Church, will not chuse
to submit (when they are not obliged in Conscience) to such
Usurpations on the State, as overthrow the Church: Whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
they were obliged to renounce Episcopacy or not, they saw
it destroyed, and not so much as an Indulgence allowed to the
Worship or Government of the Church of <hi>England.</hi> What he
adds, I would desire him carefully to consider, for it did not
<pb n="71" facs="tcp:50779:37"/>
concern them; <hi>that to be disabled to keep a Living, though a very
good one, is no reason to rebel against a settled Government. 4. The
whole Government in Church and State was overturned, which was
the fundamental Constitution of the Nation;</hi> but this, he says, <hi>is on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
changing the form of Government, as the Dr. knows the Convoca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
says, when such degenerate forms of Government are throughly
settled.</hi> I grant it, but when <hi>such degenerate forms of Government
are not throughly settled,</hi> the subversion of the fundamental Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stitution
of the Nation, is a reasonable prejudice against submis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sion,
when it is not a duty.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>His parting Objection is so very ridiculous,</hi>
               <note place="margin">Postscript. p. 15.</note> 
               <hi>that had he begun
with it, I should have thought he had only intended it for a jest,
but I am now so well acquainted with his way of reasoning, that
I am satisfied, he is capable of thinking it an argument; and it is
this.</hi> If possession of Sovereign Power contary to Law, be God's Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thority,
and ought to be obeyed, then whatever Sovereign Power a
Prince possesses himself of, is likewise God's Authority, and ought to
be obeyed.âIf therefore a Prince in a limited Monarchy resolves eo
be arbitraryâto make his will the Law, and to exercise an Illegal
Power, he must be obeyed as Gods Authority.</p>
            <p>But where do I say, <hi>that possession of Sovereign Power contrary to
Law is Gods Authority?</hi> He does not pretend, that I say it in ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>press
words, but this he supposes is the sense of what I say: But
I desire he would keep to my words, for I will answer for none
of his senses, unless I were better satisfied both of his understand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
and honesty. I say indeed, that a Prince who is settled in
the possession of Sovereign Power, though he have no legal Title
to the Crown, has God's Authority; and what then? therefore
<hi>the possession of Sovereign power contrary to Law is God's Authority;</hi>
how does this follow? cannot God settle a King upon the
Throne without a legal Title, but he must be presumed to give
him Authority, when ever he has power, to govern by an Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bitrary
will, against the Laws of the Land? cannot God make
a King, without giving him Authority to do all that he has power
to do?</p>
            <p>
               <hi>But</hi> the formal reason of obedience to such a Prince is because he
hath God's Authority, and the evidence that he hath God's Authority,
is because he is possessed of Sovereign Power. <hi>Suppose this, though
God's Authority be</hi> the formal reason of our obedience to a Prince,
<hi>yet it is not the Rule of our obedience, and therefore we are not
bound to obey every thing he commands, though he have God's
Authority.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <pb n="72" facs="tcp:50779:38"/>
The Authority of God is only an Authority to govern according to
the Laws of God and Nature, or the Laws of the Land; and tho
Sovereign Princes may have such an Authority, as must not be resisted,
yet in a limited Monarchy they have no more Authority from God to
transgress the Laws of the Land, than in an absolute Monarchy they
have to transgress the Laws of God and Nature. Indeed <hi>Arbitrary
Government</hi> is not the <hi>possession</hi> of <hi>Sovereign Power,</hi> which is <hi>God's Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thority,</hi>
but the arbitrary <hi>Exercise</hi> of it: And tho we must obey God's
Authority, it does not hence follow, that we must obey the Exercise
of Arbitrary Power.</p>
            <p>And yet I do not attribute Gods Authority (which we must obey
in Conscience) to the <hi>bare</hi> possession of Power, but to the <hi>setled</hi> pos<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>session
of it; that is, with the Consent and Submission of the People;
and could any Prince change a limited into an absolute Monarchy by a
National Consent, Subjects were then as much bound in Conscience to
submit to an arbitrary Power in all matters, which have no moral
evil in them, as they are now to obey the Laws; but then this would
not be an Authority against Law, but the Law would be changed:
Thus it is not yet, and we are in no danger now it should be so;
and therefore the Case of the <hi>Declaration,</hi> and of <hi>Magdalen-Colledge, &amp;c.</hi>
are very impertinently alledged by our <hi>Authour,</hi> and he had better re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>serve
them, till he can bring us under the Government of a <hi>French</hi>
Power.</p>
            <p>But do not I say, <hi>That when the Laws of the Land contradict the Laws
of God, they are no Rule to us, but their Obligation must give place to
Divine Authority.</hi> He should have cited the whole, <hi>That the Laws of
the Land are the Rule of Conscience, when they do not contradict the Laws
of God; but when they do, they are no Rule to us.</hi> So that the Laws of
the Land must be the Rule of our Obedience to Princes, unless they
contradict the Laws of God, and I do not know that any of our Laws
do that, and then there is no danger in a limited Monarchy, that we
should be obliged by God's Authority to obey Arbitrary Will and
Power.</p>
            <p>It is a certain truth, as our <hi>Authour</hi> must confess, that <hi>if the Laws
of the Land contradict the Laws of God, they are no Rule to us.</hi> But this
proves nothing in particular, without proving what Laws of the
Land are contrary to the Laws of God: If then he can prove, that
by the Law of God, we are bound to obey the Arbitrary Will of the
Prince against the Laws of the Land, whenever he will command things
against Law, and has power to <hi>crush us,</hi> if we will not obey, I will
readily grant, and so must he, that it is our duty to do it; but till he
prove this, he must not take it for granted there is such a Law, and
<pb n="73" facs="tcp:50779:38"/>
then we need dispute this matter no further at present. But what
he means by this Argument I cannot tell; if he does think, there
is such a Law of God, I suppose he intended in good earnest to prove,
that we must submit to the Arbitrary Will of our Prince against Law,
and to condemn the opposition that was made in the late Reign to
such Arbitrary Proceedings; if he did not believe there was any such
Law of God, how ridiculous was it to pretend, that we must submit
to Arbitrary Will and Power against Law, because <hi>when the Laws of
the Land contradict the Laws of God, they are no Rule to us.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>I shall only observe farther, that our <hi>Authour</hi> charges me with say<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
in the <hi>Case of Resistance, that this may easily be</hi> (that <hi>a Prince in a
limited Monarchy should resolve to be arbitrary) when he has all the Power
of the Kingdom in his hands, and must not be resisted.</hi> Whereas I bring
this in by way of objection against <hi>Non-Resistance,</hi> and only say, <hi>it is
possible,</hi> but shew by several Arguments how difficult it is, and that
the Doctrine of <hi>Non-Resistance</hi> does not destroy the distinction between
a limited and absolute Monarchy: But at this rate he uses to cite
Authours, that unwary Readers will easily be imposed on, if they
give too much credit to him.</p>
            <p>Thus I have particularly answered all the little appearances of Rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son
and Argument in the <hi>Postscript,</hi> and made it appear, that accord<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
to the Sense of the <hi>Convocation,</hi> those Princes who have no legal
Right, may yet have God's Authority, and have so, when their Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernment
is <hi>thoroughly setled.</hi> And now had been the proper time
to enquire what the <hi>Convocation</hi> meant by a <hi>thorough Settlement,</hi> but he
did not like this order, and therefore chose to begin with the Notion
of <hi>thorough Settlement;</hi> for when once it had appeared, that the <hi>Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vocation</hi>
spoke of the settlement of <hi>illegal</hi> Powers, he must have been
ashamed to have pretended, that they meant a <hi>legal</hi> Settlement, by ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quiring
a new <hi>legal</hi> Title, <hi>either by the death or cession of the right Heirs,
or by a long Prescription.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>I shall only add, that when the <hi>Convocation</hi> speaks of a Settlement,
they mean the Settlement of the Government <hi>within it self,</hi> not with
respect to foreign Force and Power; for so they express it, <hi>when they
have established any of the said degenerate Forms of Government amongst
their own People,</hi> and then the Government may be <hi>throughly setled</hi>
within it self, before it have a peaceable Possession and Settlement; so
<hi>Alexander</hi>'s Authority was setled at <hi>Ierusalem,</hi> before <hi>Darius</hi> was finally
conquered; and so are K. <hi>William</hi> and Q. <hi>Mary</hi> setled on the Throne,
notwithstanding all the expectations some have of a <hi>French</hi> Invasion
and Conquest.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="74" facs="tcp:50779:39"/>
And since our <hi>Authour</hi> insists so much upon a legal Settlement, Pos<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>session
of the Throne, with the Consent and Submission of the <hi>Estates
of the Realm,</hi> gives a legal Settlement in <hi>England,</hi> if we will believe
our best <hi>Iudges</hi> and <hi>Lawyers,</hi> as I shall be inclined to do, till I see a
fair Answer to what I have said in this Cause, in the <hi>Case of Alle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>legiance;</hi>
and then we have the opinion of our <hi>Lawyers</hi> for a <hi>Settle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment,</hi>
and of the <hi>Convocation</hi> for <hi>Obedience</hi> to a setled Government.</p>
            <p>For the Conclusion of his <hi>Answer,</hi> he alledges the Authority of
Bishop <hi>Andrews</hi> and Bishop <hi>Buckeridge,</hi> two Members of this <hi>Convoca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion,</hi>
               <note place="margin">
                  <hi>Answer,</hi> p. 27.</note>
and of Dr. <hi>Iackson,</hi> a very learned Divine, against that sense we
give of the <hi>Convocation.</hi> The thing then he is to prove from these
reverend and learned Men against our sense of the <hi>Convocation</hi> is this,
that those who ascend the Throne by Usurpation without a legal
Right have not God's Authority, and must not be obeyed; and that
such Princes can never, in the sense of the <hi>Convocation,</hi> be setled in
their Thrones, or have God's Authority, till they gain some new le<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gal
Right, by the <hi>Death or Cession</hi> of the rightful Prince, or by a <hi>long
Prescription:</hi> Let us see then, how he proves this to be the judgment
of these Learned Men.</p>
            <p>Now what he quotes from B. <hi>Andrews</hi> has not one word of this
matter. The whole of it is no more but this; that the Bishop will
not allow the Name of <hi>King</hi> to any but <hi>Kings of lawful and true de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>scent;</hi>
they are Kings, <hi>the they reign not,</hi> as <hi>Ioash was;</hi> others are no
Kings, but Usurpers, tho they reign, <hi>as Athaliah did;</hi> and what is
this to the purpose? Does not the <hi>Convocation</hi> allow <hi>Ioash</hi> to be the
true Heir, while he was kept from the Crown, and <hi>Athaliah</hi> an U<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>surper,
tho she reigned Six Years? Does not the <hi>Convocation</hi> call such
Kings, <hi>Kings de facto,</hi> which is a little softer Name than <hi>Vsurper,</hi>
but signifies much the same thing, <hi>viz. One who is possessed of the Throne
without a legal Right?</hi> And yet what the <hi>Convocation</hi>'s Doctrin was
about Obedience to such Kings, I have already proved; and Bishop
<hi>Andrews</hi> might be of the same mind, tho he would not allow them
the Name of Kings.</p>
            <p>But the <hi>Bishop</hi> will not allow, that such Kings <hi>reigned by God.</hi>
Right; but then he does not mean, that such Kings do not <hi>exercise</hi>
God's Authority; but that God did not by his <hi>antecedent Will and
Appointment</hi> place them on the Throne. Thus S. <hi>Chrysostom,</hi> on the
13. <hi>Rom.</hi> allows all Power and Authority to be of God, and to be
ordained by God, and therefore not to be resisted, whoever has it;
but yet will not say, that all Princes, who exercise this Power wicked<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
and tyrannically, whatever their Title be, are ordained of God:
He thought it a Reproach and Blemish to the goodness and justice of
<pb n="75" facs="tcp:50779:39"/>
Providence, to say, that wicked, impious, tyrannical Princes were
ordained by God, but yet granted that the Authority they exercised
was Gods, and must be obeyed: The <hi>Bishop</hi> and others will allow
what S. <hi>Chrysostom</hi> would not, That the most wicked Tyrants, who
have a legal Title to their Thrones, are ordained by God, but are
afraid to own, that Princes who ascend their Thrones by unjust and
wicked means, are set up by God; but it does not hence follow,
that they denyed their Power and Authority to be Gods, or that
Subjects ought to obey it. The <hi>Convocation</hi> it self affirms no more,
in that <hi>mighty place,</hi> as our <hi>Authour</hi> calls it, than that <hi>the Authority
which is exercised in those Governments, which begun by the Ambition of
Princes, or the Rebellion of Subjects, is always God's Authority, and
therefore can receive no impeachment by the wickedness of those who have
it, and therefore must be obeyed.</hi> So that Learned Men may differ in
this Point, whether illegal Usurpers are placed on the Throne by the
over-ruling Counsels and Appointment of God, or only by his per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>missive
Providence, and yet agree in the main Conclusion, That the
Authority they exercise, when setled in their Thrones, is God's Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thority,
and must be obeyed.</p>
            <p>We have a very express Determination of this matter by Doctor
<hi>Iackson,</hi> (to whom our <hi>Authour</hi> appeals) in that very <hi>Sermon</hi> to
which he refers; and tho the Passage be long, it is worth transcrib<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing,
and it is this:</p>
            <p>
               <q>But doth this Rule of our Apostle hold as punctually of the Magi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>strate,<note place="margin">
                     <hi>Iackson,</hi> Vol. 3. p. 963, <hi>&amp;c.</hi>
                  </note>
as of the Magistracy? Doth every one which resists the Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gistrate,
or Men invested with the power of Jurisdiction resist the
Ordinance of God as directly, or in as high a degree, as he that
resists the Power it self wherewith he is invested; as he that
seeks to overthrow the Magistracy? It is the Observation of
S. <hi>Chrysostom,</hi> and <hi>Oecumenius</hi> upon this place, that S. <hi>Paul</hi> does not
say, There is no Magistrate but from God, or that the Magistrates
that be, be ordained of God, but that there is <hi>no power which is not
from God,</hi> and that <hi>the powers that be, are ordained of God:</hi> That he
purposely speaks not of this or that Magistrate in particular, or of
the Person to whom the Power is annexed, <hi>sed de re ipsa,</hi> but of the
Power it self. But here a Man might well demand of them; is there
any Power here meant by the <hi>Apostle,</hi> which is not inherent in some
Mens Persons? Is there any Magistracy without a Magistrate? Or
how can the Power be resisted, unless the Party be resisted in whom it
is seated?</q> And so he goes on to prove that S. <hi>Paul</hi> meant the <hi>Magi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>strate,</hi>
even <hi>Nero</hi> himself, not merely the <hi>Magistracy:</hi> So that as Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gistracy,
<pb n="76" facs="tcp:50779:40"/>
or the power of jurisdiction is from God, and must be
obeyed, so must the Magistrate who has this Power. And yet in the
next Section he makes a great difference between <hi>the Power it self,</hi> and
the <hi>Acquisition</hi> or <hi>Exercise</hi> of Power, <hi>That our Apostle's Rule doth not
so punctually hold of the means or acquisition of Power, or of the exercise of
it, as it doth of the Power or Magistracy it self. Albeit the Power or Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gistracy
be always God's positive and primary Ordinance, al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ways
an effect of his gracious Providence, always a Blessing towards any
Land or People, or the Award of his antecedent Will: Yet the
manner of acquiring this Power, or the annexing it to this or that Person,
one or more, is not always the positive Ordinance of God, no effect
of his Bounty and Benignity, no consequent of his antecedent Will, but
sometimes rather the Award of his consequent Will, and an Act
at least permissive of his punitive Iustice.</hi> So that all Princes are not
from God, in the same sense that all Power is, but all Princes have
that Power, which is from God, and must be obeyed.</p>
            <p>His next Testimony is from Bishop <hi>Buckeridge,</hi> and he speaks exactly
the sense of the <hi>Convocation, that</hi> Athaliah <hi>had not acquired a Right to the
Crown, neither by the consent of the People, nor by the Prescription of
six years,</hi> which shews what his judgment was, that such an Usurper
as <hi>Athaliah,</hi> might acquire a Right to the Crown, either by the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sent
of the People, or by long continuance, as the <hi>Convocation</hi> asserts in
the case of <hi>Autiochus,</hi> the <hi>Bishop</hi> I think not with the same reason in
the Case of <hi>Athaliah;</hi> but whether his Application be proper or not,
his Doctrine is the same with the <hi>Convocation</hi>'s.</p>
            <p>Our <hi>Author</hi> did well to cite this passage honestly, but he did not
well to corrupt it with his Comment, as I observed before; for he
turns a Disjunctive into a Conjunctive: the Bishop says <hi>neither by the
consent of the People, nor by the Prescription of six years;</hi> which sup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poses,
that either the consent of the People, or a long Prescription
would give a Right, and he expounds it of both together, <hi>that a
right to the Government is acquired by a Prescription, and that is a long
and uninterrupted Possession, joyned with the consent of the People.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>His last Appeal is to Dr. <hi>Iaekson,</hi> and I allow the Doctor does say
what he quotes from him, <hi>that a mere Vsurper or a Tyrant by Title may
be resisted by violence even to Deposition or DeathâOur Author Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fesses</hi>
Dr. <hi>Iackson</hi> will not allow <hi>resistance to be made by every body, but
he says it with this qualification, save in the right and interest of the Right
Heir, Or by his Commission and Command;</hi> where he has turned the
Tables, and made a Conjunctive a Disjunctive, <hi>Or</hi> for <hi>And,</hi> little
Particles, which make no difference with our <hi>Author:</hi> But since he has
<pb n="77" facs="tcp:50779:40"/>
not thought fit to give us this entire <hi>Paragraph,</hi> I will do it for him,
and let the Reader judge, on which side Dr. <hi>Iachson</hi> is: it is this.</p>
            <p>So then a Tyrant or Vsurper may be Deposed or Resisted; but <hi>thus</hi> Resi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sted
or Deposed he may not be by every Man,<note place="margin">Pag. 965.</note> who knows him to be an Vsurper.
For a Man may trangress this Rule of the Apostle, and resist Gods Ordinance,
by resisting the Power, wherewith he is invested, though not simply by resisting
him <hi>(so that an Usurper has that power which is Gods Ordinance, and
must not be resisted by every body)</hi> Aliud est Magistratum esse, aliud est in
Magistratu esse, aut Magistratum gerere: it is one thing to be a ture and law<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful
Magistrate, another thing to bear or execute the Office of a true Magi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>strate.
The Acts of a false Magistrate or Intruder, whilst he is in Magi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stratu
in the Office it self, are of validity <hi>(let our</hi> Author <hi>remember
this too.)</hi> His Person is to be obeyed, not resisted by every Man, until he
be declared to be an Vsurper or Intruder by some higher Power or Authority.
Few Tyrants have gotten Investiture or admission to Royal Power by more
indirect means, thou <hi>Richard</hi> the third in this Kingdom did, yet many Acts
and Exercises of Royal Power, though proceeding from him, were legal
and of validity. Nor did they resist the Ordinance of God that bore Of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fice
under him, that obeyed his Summons, whether for Parliament, or
other business of State. <hi>(This confutes great part of our</hi> Author's
<hi>Book, and undermines the Fundamental Principles of it.) It had
been a sin for any man of his own private head to have
killed him,</hi> albeit all the space of his Reign he did resist the Ordinance
of God: for every man is not an Avenger of such as resist the Ordinance
of God: this belongs to the Higher Powers only, or unto them to whom the
Supreme Power is by right annexed. And so <hi>Henry</hi> of <hi>Richmond</hi> was
Authorized by Gods Ordinance to execute vengeance, or to bring condemna<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
on this Tyrant, which every one might not have done, which perhaps no
other might have done save only in his Right and Interest, and by his Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mission
and Command.</p>
            <p>Now who ever doubted, but that a rightful Prince, when disposses<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed
unjustly, may recover his Throne again if he can, and dispossess
the Usurper, or that those who lawfully receive Commission from
him, may lawfully fight in his quarrel: but the great question still
remains, whether Subjects may lawfully take Commissions from the
dispossessed Prince, to fight against the Prince, who is settled in the
Possession of the Throne; this Dr. <hi>Iackson</hi> does not say, and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
he can do our <hi>Author</hi> no service.</p>
            <p>His next citation from Dr. <hi>Iackson is the case of</hi> Jehoiada'<hi>s Deposing
of</hi> Athaliah, <hi>urged by the Papists for the power of the Pope to depose
Kings.</hi> But this he has so shamefully mangled, that a little discretion
<pb n="78" facs="tcp:50779:41"/>
would have taught him rather to have left it out, than to have betrayed
so much dishonestly in his quotations, I shall give the Reader the en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tire
passage.</p>
            <p>First, Jehoiada <hi>in that he was High-Priest, was a prime Peer in the
Realm of</hi> Judah, <hi>and invested with the power of Iurisdiction next in
order and dignity to the Higher Power.</hi> This our <hi>Author</hi> leaves out,
though very material, because it shews by what Authority he did it,
as the Ordinary Supreme Magistrate in the vacancy of the Throne;
that is, not merely in right of his Priesthood, as the <hi>Papists</hi> pretended,
nor merely as a Subject, but as being the Higher Power and Authori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty,
to whom the judgment of such matters belonged, as he had ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>served
before. And this is the very account the <hi>Convocation</hi> gives of
it,<note place="margin">Convoc. c. 23. p. 41.</note> that <hi>Iehoiada</hi> did this <hi>being the Kings Vncle, and the chief Head
and Prince of his Tribe,</hi> that is, not a private Subject, but a chief Prince
in the Kingdom of <hi>Iudah.</hi> The <hi>Doctor</hi> proceeds.</p>
            <p>Secondly, The Power Royal, or Supreme, was by right, <hi>by the ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>press
Ordinance and positive Law of God,</hi> annexed unto the Infant
Prince, <hi>whom</hi> Jehoiada'<hi>s Wife had saved from the Tyranny of</hi> Atha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liah,
as being next Heir now alive <hi>unto</hi> David. <hi>In the right of this
Prince, and for the actual annexion of the Supreme Power to his person
(unto whom it was</hi> de jure <hi>annexed)</hi> Jehoiada, <hi>being the chief Magi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>strate
in the vacancy, did by force and violence</hi> Depose her, who had
Usurpt the Royal Scepter <hi>by violence, and cruel Murder of her Seed
Royal.</hi> All these words, in a different Character, are left out by our
<hi>Author,</hi> and some of them very material ones, especially those, <hi>by
the express Ordinance, and positive Law of God,</hi> and the next Heir
now alive <hi>to David,</hi> which plainly refers to the Divine entail on <hi>Da<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vid</hi>'s
Family, and distinguishes this from the case of other Usurpers,
which is the very account the <hi>Convocation</hi> gave of it, as I shewed be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore,
and overthrows all that our <hi>Author</hi> has said about the case of
<hi>Athaliah,</hi> and for that reason he suppressed them, as any one will
easily guess. Thus he leaves out, Jehoiada <hi>being the chief Magistrate
in the vacancy,</hi> which shews this was an Act of Authority and Juris<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diction,
which private Subjects must not pretend to; and therefore
would not serve his purpose, and I believe by this time, he thinks he
had better have let it all alone.</p>
            <p>He concludes his Postscript with rage aud venom, and I have no
answer to that. I have indeed changed my Opinion about the Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thority
of Usurpers, who are setled in the Throne by the general
consent and submission of the People, and of the Estates of the Realm,
and I have Scripture and Reason, the Authority of the Church of
<pb n="79" facs="tcp:50779:41"/>
               <hi>England,</hi> and the Laws of the Land (for any thing our Author has
said to the contrary) to justifie this change; and I assure him, I will
change my Opinion in any thing else upon the same terms, and
despise his censures of my Honesty for doing so; and as for Autho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity,
I never pretended to any my self, and will never own any mans
Authority, much less my own Opinions, in opposition to Scripture
and Reason, the Church of <hi>England,</hi> and the Laws of the Land.
But what a charitable Opinion our Author has of the present Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernment,
and of all that comply with it, we may see in the Paral<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lel
he makes between my case and that of <hi>Hazael:</hi> as if swearing
Allegiance to King <hi>William</hi> and Queen <hi>Mary</hi> were as great, as noto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rious,
as self evident an impiety and wickedness, as all the villanies,
which the Prophet <hi>Elisha</hi> foretold <hi>Hazael,</hi> that he would be guilty of:
<hi>I know the evil that thou wilt do unto the Children of</hi> Israel,<note place="margin">2 Kings 8. 12.</note> 
               <hi>their strong
holds wilt thou set on fire, and their young men wilt thou slay with the
sword, and wilt dash their children, and rip up their women woth child.</hi>
But let our Author consider, who are most likely to be guilty of these
Villanies, those who quietly submit to the Government, which is
now setled among us, or those who are for overturning all by bring<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
in a <hi>French</hi> Power, to devour and consume with Fire and Sword,
and to enslave their Native Country: if this be Allegiance and Pas<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sive
Obedience, I am sure, what our Author calls Perjury and Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bellion
are the greater vertues.</p>
            <p>As for his parting Request, I do affirm it again, <hi>That I never was
factious against taking the Oaths, nor made it my business to dissuade men
from it; when my Opinion was asked, I declared my own thoughts, but
never sought out men to make Proselytes:</hi> and in this Profession I am not
afraid of his or any other mens memories so much as of their inven<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions,
for there are some great Wits among them. Let them pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duce
the man, if they can, whom I endeavoured to dissuade by word
or writing from taking the Oaths, where my Opinion was not first
asked; and if my Opinion had any Authority with them then, our
Author knows, it is more than it ought to have had, and that was
none of my fault; unless he means, that my Authority was consider<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able
against taking the Oath, but none for it; which is the way,
that all Parties and Factions judge of mens Authorities.</p>
            <p>But though our Author seems very well acquainted with the thing
called <hi>Faction,</hi> yet he is not willing to understand the word; and
therefore I must tell him, that when I say, <hi>I was never factious</hi> a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainst
the Oath, I do not mean, that I was never hearty and zealous
against taking the Oath; for I hope there may be Zeal without Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction;
<pb n="80" facs="tcp:50779:42"/>
or that when I was pressed to discourse the matter, I did not
talk with as much Warmth and Concernment as other Men.</p>
            <p>But Faction is quite another thing, it shews it self in Separations,
and Schisms, in Rancour and Bitterness, Envyings and Emulations,
in violent Oppositions to Government, in changing and confining
Friendships with a Party, in Censures and Reproaches, in stigmatiz<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
all Persons of another Perswasion, <hi>as perjur'd Knaves;</hi> whereas
tho there had been a material Perjury, a different Opinion may ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cuse
from formal Perjury; for no Man is formally perjured, who
does not know it: I shall not explain this by Instances; for if our
Author is for writing <hi>Secret Histories,</hi> I am not so at present. And
now I am at leisure to attend his motions, and to consider his threat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned
<hi>examination of all my arguments,</hi> whenever his <hi>due time</hi> for it
comes; and if he will promise to examine them well, before he an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>swers,
I shall expect to hear no more from him.</p>
