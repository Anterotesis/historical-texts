            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>

               <seg rend="decorInit">W</seg>HEN our Lord was about to ſend
his Diſciples forth into the World
to preach the Goſpel, he thought it
juſt and neceſſary to ſpeak of the
Dangers unto which they certain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
ſhould be expoſed by doing their duty, and
to prepare their minds againſt them; ſo that they
might neither be ſurpriſed by Tribulations and Suf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferings
when they came, nor ſink under them.</p>
            <p>And to enable them to deal with the moſt mali<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cious
Enemies of his Holy Religion, he commands
them to furniſh their Souls with two excellent Vir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tues,
Wiſdom and Innocence. They were to be
wiſe as Serpents, and as harmleſs as Doves. As
Wiſdom would cauſe them to decline and avoid
<pb n="6" facs="tcp:100076:5"/>
all needleſs hazards and difficulties; ſo Innocence
would make them gentle, and meek, and tender<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hearted,
and not apt to revenge injuries.</p>
            <p>But then that true Wiſdom which would ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cure
them from running into unneceſſary danger,
would likewiſe prompt them readily to encoun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
and ſubmit to thoſe pains, troubles, and hard<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhips,
which were neceſſary to eſtabliſh the Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venly
Doctrines of their Maſter; to endure ſmall
evils, to eſcape greater; and to lay down their
lives, rather than have both Soul and Bodydeſtroyed
for ever. And it muſt be a mighty encourage<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
to undertake the Office of Preaching the
Goſpel, which Chriſt had allotted them, that the
cruelty of their fierceſt Oppoſers could extend no
farther than the body: whereas <hi>that</hi> God, whoſe
meſſage they were to Publiſh, could deſtroy both
Soul and Body. <hi>And fear not them which kill the bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy,
&amp;c.</hi> From which words we may deduce ſeveral
Obſervations.</p>
            <p>(1.) That the Soul and Body are diſtinct Beings.</p>
            <p>(2.) That after the diſſolution of the Body, the
Soul doth live in the ſeparate ſtate.</p>
            <p>(3.) That nothing leſs than the Almighty Pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er
of God can deſtroy the Being of the Soul.</p>
            <p>We have a noble Argument before us, and
which the Infidelity of our times hath render'd ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry
neceſſary. It is our Soul, which makes us like
<pb n="7" facs="tcp:100076:5"/>
God, and ſuperior to other Creatures; and its
ſubſiſtence in the boundleſs Eternity, which ſhall
ſucceed our ſhort abode in this World. In treating
whereof, I ſhall endeavour to avoid all needleſs
Speculations, and confine my ſelf to thoſe Argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments,
which ſeem moſt clearly and ſtrongly to
prove the great Truths contained in the Text. The
Propoſitions I chiefly ſhall inſiſt upon at this time,
are theſe two:</p>
            <p>(1.) That the Soul and Body are diſtinct Beings.
(2.) That after the Diſſolution of the Body, the
Soul doth exiſt and live in the ſeparate State.</p>
            <p>(1.) That the Soul and Body are diſtinct Beings.
The very Argument our Lord uſes to perſuade the
Diſciples not to fear thoſe who can kill the Body,
reſts upon this Suppoſition, That the Soul and Body
are Beings diſtinct one from another. For if Men
had no Souls; or if the Soul was not a different
thing from the Body; or if other Men had as much
Power over the Soul as the Body, there would
be no Force in his Reaſoning. But to make this
Truth the more evident, I ſhall draw Arguments
from theſe three heads.</p>
            <p>(1.) From the diſtinct Properties of the Soul and
Body.</p>
            <p>(2.) From the Incapacity of Matter to think.</p>
            <p>(3.) From the difference every where ſuppoſed
in Scripture between the Soul and Body.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="8" facs="tcp:100076:6"/>
(1.) From the diſtinct Properties of the Soul and
Body. Now if we will give our ſelves leave a
little to contemplate our own Nature, we ſhall
diſcover in us Powers, Qualities, and Actions,
which are peculiar to the Soul, and quite different
from the Affections and Qualities which belong to
the Body. Eſſential Properties of the Soul are to
think, to underſtand, to will, to conſider, to judge,
and the like. But Inſeparable Properties of Body,
are length, breadth, thickneſs, ſize, ſhape, <hi>&amp;c.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>But as theſe things may be eſteemed Eſſential,
ſome to the Mind, and ſome to the Body; for if
either you ſever Thinking from the Mind, or Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tention
from the Body, you can have no Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ception
or Apprehenſion of the one, or the other;
So they are very diſtinct, not having the leaſt Affi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity
each with other; thus Conſideration, Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>membrance,
Judgment, Liberty, Conſcience, have
no Relation unto Body, and do not enter into
the Notion and Idea of it; neither doth Length,
Breadth, Size, Figure, Hardneſs, Softneſs, enter into
the Conception of a Soul; for we never ſpeak of
the length, or the ſhape, or the bulk, or the co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lour
of our Thoughts, ſince that would be abſurd
Speech, by which we could mean nothing.</p>
            <p>So that it is manifeſt, our Souls are diſtinguiſht
from our Bodies by Properties, which are peculiar
and eſſential to each of them; and that we have
<pb n="9" facs="tcp:100076:6"/>
as clear, full, and diſtinct Apprehenſions of the
Attributes that are Eſſential to the Soul, as of thoſe
which are inſeparable from the Body. For does
not every Man as plainly comprehend what is
meant by Thinking, Conſidering, and Judging,
as by Dimenſions, Motion, and Diviſibility in Bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dies?
<q>
                  <note place="margin">Euſeb. praep. Lib. XV. p. 810.</note> Every Man judges (ſays <hi>Atticus Platonicus</hi>)
that they are the Properties of the Soul, to deli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>berate,
to conſider, and after any manner to
think. For when he looks upon Body, and its
Powers, and likewiſe concludes, that thoſe kind
of Operations cannot belong unto Bodies, he pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſently
yields that there is in us ſome other Thing,
which does deliberate or adviſe, and that is the
Soul.</q>
            </p>
            <p>(2.) I argue that the Soul and Body are diſtinct
ſubſtances from the incapacity of matter to think.
All we know of the Nature and Qualities of Mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter,
we learn from its Operation on our Senſes;
for further than it acts upon ſome of our Senſes
we have no notice of it. But Matter can
no other way work upon our Senſes, but by
motion, which is the Cauſe of all that varie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty,
which ſhews it ſelf in bodies. If then Mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
can perceive and think, and all the Effects
and Changes in Matter be wrought by Motion,
then unto Motion muſt be aſcribed Thought
<pb n="10" facs="tcp:100076:7"/>
and Perception. But as nothing is more unlike
than Corporeal Motion and Cogitation, ſo it is
unconceiveable how one ſhould be the cauſe of
the other, that is, how ſtupid matter by any
degree of Motion communicated to it, ſhould
acquire a Power to conſider, reflect, and remem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber.</p>
            <p>The <hi>Epicureans</hi> indeed, who hold the Soul cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poreal,
to explain how Matter may perform the
Functions of the Mind, do teach that the Parts of
Matter which go to making a Soul, are light and
ſmall, and of a globular or round Figure. Juſt as if
a maſſy piece of Lead, when melted and form'd
into Bullets, was in a nearer capacity to think,
meditate, debate, and act like a Soul. But I
appeal to the common ſenſe of Mankind, whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
that Philoſopher has a right to call any Le<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gendary
Tale into queſtion, who can believe that
little balls of Matter, by being briskly moved,
can come to have Underſtanding, Will, and Judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment.</p>
            <p>Surely they ought to doubt of nothing, who
can be perſwaded that ſmall Bodies round, or of
any other ſhape, ſhould by juſtling and moving
one againſt another, be endued with Reaſon and
Wiſdom, and a Talent to diſpute concerning the
Nature of their own Beings; to raiſe Queſtions,
whether they are Matter or Spirit, bodily or in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>corporeal
<pb n="11" facs="tcp:100076:7"/>
Subſtances? And not only yield to, or re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiſt
the impreſſions of Objects preſent to them,
according to the acknowledged Laws of Motion,
but alſo reflect on the times long ſince paſt, and
meditate on thoſe which are to come, nay, ſtretch
out their conſideration to infinite Space, and eternal
Duration.</p>
            <p>But as the <hi>Epicureans</hi> would rid us of our Diffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culties
by aſſigning the Figure of the Parts, which
compound a corporeal Mind; ſo the <hi>Stoicks</hi> would
make the thing intelligible by deſcribing the kind
or ſort of Motion which cauſes Matter to think.
Now it's their Doctrine that the Soul is Fire, and
conſequently, that it performs its Office by ſuch
motion as is in Fire.</p>
            <p>But this is ſtrange Fire which gives us Under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtanding,
and yet no Light, whereby we may any
whit more eaſily conceive in what manner it is poſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſible
for Matter to think. For who can ſhew ſo
much as the ſhadow of an Argument to move a
ſober Man to conclude, That there ſhould be Rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſoning
Powers and Faculties any more in a Fire of
Coles, than in a lump of cold Clay; or that a Log
of Wood ſhould get ſenſe and underſtanding by
being put into a Flame.<note n="*" place="margin">Sive ani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ma, ſive ignis ſit a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nimus, e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>um jura<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rem eſſe divinum, Cic. Tuſc. quaeſt. lib. 1.</note> If Materialiſts will
make their Senſes, to which they ſo often appeal,
the Judges, they muſt confeſs, That the Natural
Effect of Fire is to ſeparate and rend the Parts of
<pb n="12" facs="tcp:100076:8"/>
Bodies aſunder, which action can bear no faint
reſemblance to the Thoughts, Deliberations, and
Judgments of the Soul, nor to that freedom of Will
with which it either ſets its Faculties on work, or
ſtops them.</p>
            <p>Theſe are ſome of the groſs and nauſeous Ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſurdities,

which, I begin with the Creation of Man.<note place="margin">Gen. c. 1. v. 26.</note> 
               <hi>And
God ſaid, Let us make man in our image, after our like<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs.</hi>
But man is not like God in reſpect of his
Body, becauſe God hath no body. Beſides, the
body in its nature is diviſible and corruptible: but
God without change or decay is eternally the ſame,
a Being for ever infinitely perfect. The ſimili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tude

               <pb n="14" facs="tcp:100076:9"/>
The diſtinction between Soul and Body may
alſo be obſerved from the manner wherein God
created Man. <hi>And the Lord formed man of the

            <p>In purſuance of our Argument it may here
be proper to obſerve, how difficult it will be for
them, who maintain that the Soul is only a mode,
accident, or quality of the Body, to give a ratio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal
account of Chriſt's words in our Text: <hi>Fear
not them which kill the body, but are not able to kill
the ſoul,</hi> &amp;c.</p>
            <p>According to theſe Philoſophers other men
may kill the Body, but are not able to hurt the
Accidents and Qualities of the Body, which they
are pleaſed to call the Soul. And yet it is moſt
certain, that men only can deſtroy the Accidents
and Qualities in Bodies, but cannot deſtroy their
Subſtance, which after all force uſed to it,
will ſtill ſubſiſt in other forms and ſhapes. In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſomuch
as they quite invert our Saviour's Doctrine,
it following manifeſtly from their Aſſertions, that
men have only power to kill the Soul, that is, to
deſtroy the Modes and Accidents in the Body, but
<pb n="16" facs="tcp:100076:10"/>
can do no injury to the Body or Subſtance it
ſelf.</p>
            <p>In one Inſtance more give me leave to ſhew
how repugnant theſe wild Opinions are to the
Chriſtian Religion: And it ſhall be in the Promiſe
of our Lord to the Penitent Malefactor, who was
crucified with him, <hi>to day ſhalt thou be with me in
paradiſe;</hi>
               <note place="margin">Luke c. 23. v. 43.</note> which in their ſenſe muſt be thus: While
the Body of this Sincere Penitent was on the Croſs,
or in the Grave, the Modifications and Qualities
of his Body were to attend our Saviour into Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>radiſe.
But I think only to name ſuch ridiculous
ſtuff is ſufficient to confute it; nothing being plainer
than that men muſt either part with theſe Princi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ples,
or the Doctrines of their Saviour, for they
can never conſiſt and agree together.</p>
            <p>(2.) That after the Diſſolution of the Body,
the Soul doth exiſt and live in the ſeparate State.
It appears from our Lord's words, <hi>fear not them
which kill the body,</hi> &amp;c. that he does rather ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe,
than go to prove the Immortality of the
Soul, which he took for a granted truth by them
ſteddily believed. And therefore it was not his
deſign to convince them, that the Soul does live
after its ſeparation from the body; but to ſhew
that it is ſuch a ſimple and incorruptible ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtance,
that nothing beneath Almighty Power
can deſtroy it.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="17" facs="tcp:100076:10"/>
But I fear a general decay of Faith and Piety
will not only juſtify, but make it requiſite, that
we ſhould endeavour to prove that fundamental
Doctrin <hi>of the immortality of the Soul,</hi> the truth
whereof our Lord ſuppoſed, while he was inſtruct<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing

            <p>(1.) The firſt Argument I ſhall uſe for the <hi>Im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mortality

taught openly, that the Soul
did periſh with the body: ſo that
it ſeemed neceſſary to have their
wicked opinions condemned by a
<note n="*" place="margin">Concil Lateran Seſſio 8. 19. Decemb. An. 1513.</note> Council. But notwithſtanding
theſe vain glorions perſons by vent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
ſuch ſtrange Notions, hoped to
have been accounted the only Maſters of Senſe and
Reaſon, yet by the judicious and ſtrong Confu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tations
of the worthy Men who anſwer'd their
<pb n="23" facs="tcp:100076:13"/>
Writings it does appear, that they were as weak
Philoſophers, as bad Chriſtians.</p>
            <p>But as thoſe who bid defiance to God, and ri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dicule
Religion, bear no proportion to the Bulk
of Mankind, ſo 'tis no wonder ſome ſuch ſhould
be found. For when Men abuſe the liberty God
has given them over themſelves, and by conti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nual
Debauchery weaken and corrupt their Facul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties,
it may ſo come to paſs, that they ſhall hard<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
form a true Judgment of any thing. Indeed,
a Mind enfeebled and clouded with the ſteams
of brutiſh Luſt is no more able to contemplate
the Glorious Nature of God, or to be affected
with pure and intellectual Pleaſures, than a Body
brought into the World without Eyes and Hands,
is capable to do the ordinary Works of Life.</p>
            <p>For Men may make themſelves
Monſters, as well as be born ſo;<note n="*" place="margin">Quid enim eſt tam falſum tamque abhorrens à vero, ut non ad id probandum argumen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ta excogitari queant?—Ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>que quicquam eſt tam abſurdum, quin dicendo probabile fieri; neque tam verum &amp; explora<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tum, quin dicendo in dubium vocari, aut etiam coargui queat. <hi>Muretus in Ariſt.

but then by the Example of a few
ſuch Monſters we ought not to
ſuffer either our Faith to be ſha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken,
or our Manners to be per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verted.</p>
            <p>Before I part with this Head, I would obſerve,
where Piety, and Virtue, and Wiſdom, have
thriven moſt in the Converſation of Men, and the
greater good they have done to the World, ſo
much the more firmly they have been perſwaded,
<pb n="24" facs="tcp:100076:14"/>
that their Souls ſhould ſubſiſt after they had left
their Bodies; and on the contrary, that there
hardly ever were found any much dipoſed to
ſcoff at Providence, and deny a Future State,
who had not been infamous Livers.</p>
            <p>A Heathen Philoſopher hath ſpoke of this Point
with ſo much Wiſdom and Piety, that I think it will
be no loſs of time here to preſent you with what he
hath ſaid, <q>
                  <note place="margin">Hieroc. in carm. Py<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thag. p. 165.</note> If Conſcience awaken in a bad Man a
ſenſe of his evil Deeds, which tortures his Mind,
and puts him in fear of Puniſhment in Hell, his
only remedy is to fly to Non-entity, or Not-being;
ſo he cures one Evil with another, ſupporting his
Wickedneſs by the Deſtruction of his Soul. He
gives Sentence of himſelf that after Death he ſhall
be nothing, to fly the Penalties of Future Judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment.
For a wicked Man will not have his Soul
immortal, that he may not ſubſiſt to ſuffer pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſhment.
He anticipates his Judge, by de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>claring
it is ſit that a wicked Soul ſhould be re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reduced
to nothing. But as through want of
Counſel he was drawn to Sin, ſo through Igno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rance
of the meaſure of Things he paſſes wrong
Judgment on himſelf. For the Judges of Spirits
departed, framing their Sentence according to the
Rules of Truth, do not judge it meet the Soul
ſhould be annihilated.</q>
            </p>
            <p>
               <pb n="25" facs="tcp:100076:14"/>
(2.) My next Argument ſhall be taken from
the fears Men have of Puniſhment after this
Life for their Sins. Sin troubles the Minds of
Men in ſuch inſtances, as the Law takes no no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tice
of; and in ſuch, which notwithſtanding they
are puniſhable by Law, yet were acted too-ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cretly
to be detected; and then alſo, when the
Offenders having fled their Country, were out of
reach of the Secular Judge. Such Perſons like<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe
have been perplext with the remembrance of
their Wickedneſs, whoſe height and power made
them ſtrong enough to break through the Laws,
and trample on them; in which ſeveral Caſes there
was nothing but the Natural Suggeſtions of Conſci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence
to terrify them.</p>
            <p>Now, whence can all this inward Trouble pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceed,
but from an invincible perſwaſion, that af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
Death will come Judgment. If any doubt this,
we may appeal to diſconſolate Sinners themſelves,
who often finding no eaſe in the buſineſs of their
Calling, in the Converſation of their Friends,
nor in the change of Company or Place, have been
driven to ſeek for relief of another kind, and to
apply themſelves to proper Perſons, unto whom
they may unburden their Souls, and confeſs their
ſecret Offences, hoping by their devout Prayers,
and ghoſtly Aſſiſtance, to procure ſome remedy
for their diſtreſſed Minds.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="26" facs="tcp:100076:15"/>
I may add, That ſo inſupportable have been the
Horrors of a wounded Conſcience, that men have
diſcloſed their capital Crimes to the Magiſtrate,
when they well knew it was his duty to puniſh
ſuch Criminals with Death. And the reaſon why
they expoſed themſelves voluntarily to Temporal
Death, was to eſcape Divine Vengeance in ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
World, which they of all things dreaded.
They did truſt, that having confeſt their Sin, and
repented of it, and made all the ſatisfaction they
could to Civil Juſtice, God would not enter in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to
Judgement with them, but out of his infinite
Compaſſion forgive them, and ſave their Souls
alive.</p>
            <p>Neither was the Courſe here taken to be impu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted
to Melancholy or Diſtraction, ſince experience
aſſures us, many hereby have quieted their Minds,
and found comfort in Death.</p>
            <p>Now, if the fears of what ſhall become of us
after Death, were the Effects only of the falſe
Principles which are owing to bad Education;
certainly they would not be ſo general, nor ſo
deeply rivetted in our Nature, nor ſo terrible, that
Men ſhould be willing to ſacrifice their Lives to
get rid of them.</p>
            <p>(3.) The third Argument I would urge for <hi>the
Immortality of the Soul,</hi> and that Men were not
<pb n="27" facs="tcp:100076:15"/>
made only to live here, is this, That there is no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing
in the World which fills the mind with ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tisfaction.
Men are always diſſatisfied with their
preſent Condition, and endeavouring to make
ſome Alteration in it; and after the Alteration is
made, they do not continue any long time pleaſed;
but rather diſcover that they have only changed
their old Grievances for new ones, and are di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſturbed
with a freſh ſet of Complaints.</p>
            <p>Thoſe who have the greateſt opportunities to
ſupply themſelves with the various pleaſures of
Senſe, ſhould, if any were, be eaſy in their En<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>joyments;
and yet experience declares, that what
lately they with much eagerneſs deſired, does pall
their Appetites, and grow flat and inſipid.</p>
            <p>It is well known that Men, who have had their
Treaſuries filled with Gold, who have command<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
Great and Victorious Armies, and conquered
and ruled over many Nations, have after the large
encreaſe of their Wealth, their Power, and their
Glory, upon little occaſions been diſturbed, and
diſcontented, and fallen into ſuch fits of Rage,
or Luſt, or Melancholy, as are in no wiſe conſiſtent
with true Contentment of Mind. And therefore
they ſtill poſt and preſs forward from one deſign to
another, but with the ſame diſſatisfaction; either
truſting thoſe who will deceive them; or ſtriving
to remove that which will never leave them;
<pb n="28" facs="tcp:100076:16"/>
or vehemently coveting what they ſhall never ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain.</p>
            <p>Now, what reaſon can be given why worldly
Goods ever ſhew better and greater at a diſtance,
than they prove in our Poſſeſſion, but this; that
they carry no proportion to the Appetites of the
Mind, which is of a Spiritual and Heavenly Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture,
and can never hope to receive adequate Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tisfaction
from any thing here below?</p>
            <p>Wherefore if theſe vaſt Capacities and Deſires
were placed in us by a Being of Infinite Wiſdom,
and if a Being infinitely wiſe can do nothing in
vain, then it follows, that our Souls were created
not only for this World, but to live in another,
where they ſhall converſe with, and enjoy ſuch
bright and glorious Objects, as will compleatly
gratify and delight them. And from hence I de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duce
a fourth Argument for <hi>the Immortality of the
Soul;</hi> viz.</p>
            <p>(4.) From the common appetite in Men to live
for ever, and in that Eternal State to poſſeſs the
chiefeſt good which will ſatiate the higheſt and
moſt extenſive Deſires of the Mind. Every Man
that comes into the World loves happineſs, and
would enjoy it eternally; it was not only the de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſire
of St. <hi>Paul to be diſſolved, and be with Chriſt;</hi>
but the wiſh of <hi>Balaam, to die the death of the righ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teous.</hi>
               <pb n="29" facs="tcp:100076:16"/>
He believed a future Life, and that good
Men ſhould be bleſſed in it, and he wiſht he might
have a ſhare of their Bleſſedneſs.</p>
            <p>We have had great experience of God's Good<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs,
who hath enriched us with many favours,
and therefore we ought to believe that he loves
us, and did intend good to us in the whole con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trivance
and conſtitution of our Nature, wherein
he only could put theſe unextinguiſhable Appe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tites
to live and ſubſiſt happily for ever, and to
partake of ſuch Felicity as this World does not af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ford,
and which indeed is no where to be found,
but in his infinitely perfect Being.</p>
            <p>Now he who loves us exceedingly well, and
of whoſe Bounty we have ſhared thus largely
already, would not have endued our Nature with
thoſe vehement Appetites, which, unleſs he be
pleaſed in fit time to give them ſatisfaction,
can only ſerve to diſtract and torture our minds,
and render us extremely miſerable. For ſuch a
Treatment would be not only inconſiſtent with
his infinite Wiſdom, which appears in every part
of the World; but repugnant to his boundleſs
Goodneſs, which always diſpoſes him to promote
the Happineſs, pity the weakneſſes, and ſupply the
wants of his poor Creatures.</p>
            <p>'Tis hope of enjoyment of Everlaſting Hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pineſs,
which makes us to bear Injuries, Pains, and
<pb n="30" facs="tcp:100076:17"/>
Loſſes patiently, and at length yield to the ſtroke
of Death with a willing and contented mind.
But had we reaſon to believe, that Death would
make an utter end both of Body and Soul, as
the conceit thereof all-along this Life would be
an intolerable burthen, ſo we ſhould leave the
world with deep Horror.</p>
            <p>But if there be a God; and that God is the
Author of our Nature; and the Author of our
Nature is infinitly Good, and always acts ſuitably
to that Goodneſs; and if it be the property of
infinite Goodneſs to beſtow all that endleſs Bliſs
and Felicity upon its Creatures, which it not on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
hath made them capable of, but which it hath
inclined their very Nature earneſtly to deſire and
hope for; then we may from hence, beyond
all queſtion and doubt, conclude the Immortali<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty
of our Souls. And our hope of a joyful E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ternity
can no where reſt ſo ſafely as upon the
Divine Goodneſs.</p>
            <p>(5.) I ſhall but name one Argument more,
tho it is of unconquerable Force, to prove the
future ſubſiſtence of the Soul; and that is Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vine
Providence which governs the World, pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerves
all things in their natural order, and ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerves
whatever is done upon Earth, to the end all
men may receive a Treatment from God, agree<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able
<pb n="31" facs="tcp:100076:17"/>
to their behaviour. That thoſe who love,
and fear, and ſerve God, may partake of the Glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries
with which he will reward the Heavenly<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minded;
and that they who neglect, and forget,
and diſhonour God, may be baniſht into outer
Darkneſs.</p>
            <p>That they who have done good in their Ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neration,
and ſhew'd pity to their fellow-crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures,
may obtain a Recompence; and they who
have been impure, and malicious, and have laid
wait for the righteous, oppreſt the poor, and not
ſpared the widow, may receive Judgment with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out
Mercy.</p>
            <p>But ſince this equal diſtribution of Rewards and
Puniſhments, which the Divine Juſtice does re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quire,
is not made in this world, we have full
aſſurance our Souls ſhall live in another, and there
have Judgment paſs upon them according to their
deſerts.</p>
            <p>It now but remains that I make a ſhort Refle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction
or two upon this Diſcourſe.</p>
            <p>(2.) If our Souls ſhall ſurvive our Bodies, it
ought not only to encourage us to be patient and
reſigned to the Will of God, under the great va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riety
of Troubles and Afflictions which happen in
this Life, but alſo to arm us againſt the fear of
Death.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="32" facs="tcp:100076:18"/>
Since Death only will lay open a paſſage for us
into another Life, which will infinitely ſurpaſs this
For as much as there we ſhall be deliver'd from
all thoſe things, which render our preſent con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dition
either dangerous or uncomfortable. We
ſhall no longer be expoſed to the Temptations of
wicked men, or of our own Luſts, now ſo dan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gerous
and dreadful to us, when admitted into the
Converſation of Angels and Souls made Perfect; we
ſhall not ſo much as ſuſpect treachery and wrongs
when out of reach of the Malice of Men
and Devils: we ſhall not fear Pains, and Diſeaſes,
wherewith it is not poſſible our incorruptible na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture
ſhould be affected; in a word, we never a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gain
ſhall be liable to the power of Death, the
King of Fears, for our Lord ſays we <hi>cannot die

their departure is taken for miſery, and their going from

they be puniſht in the ſight of men, yet is their hope full of
immortality.</p>
            <p>O deſirable Immortalicy! from the belief of
which not any Evil can come, no real Good can be
