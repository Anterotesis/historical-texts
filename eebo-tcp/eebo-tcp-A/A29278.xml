         <editorialDecl>
            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

                  <p>IT hath been the way of the Spirit, to ſhadow out under ſeverall Metaphors one and the ſame thing, to illuſtrate and ſet forth his mind the more clear thereby, as in the Revelations, and the Hiſtories of the life of Chriſt, many Parables diverſly ſet forth the ſame Kingdome, and viſions the ſame truth.</p>
                  <p>In this Book ye have the riſe, the fall, and reſtoration of the Goſpell Church, as ſet up among both Jews and Gentiles, moſt excellently predicted and ſhadowed out unto you.</p>
                  <p n="1">1. The Prophet begins with the Gentile Church, Ver. 1. <hi>Kiſſe me, &amp;c.</hi> Pſalm 2. Ver. 12. <hi>Servants were bound to their Maſter by a Kiſſe,</hi> in which ſhe begins to ſhew her love to her Lord, in deſiring love and ſign of favour from him, which is ſpiritually in Gods ſpeaking, love to her, and lovely of her; as after he calls her his Love, Dove and perfect one: as men ſhew an inward love, by an outward com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plement of a kiſſe, ſo God loves inwardly thoſe whom he ſpeaks well of, and unto, it being the firſt of her acquaintance with ſight of God.</p>
                  <p n="2">2. The reaſon why ſhe demands this favour is, becauſe therein ſhe apprehended an excellency above other things, for ſayes ſhe, thy loves are better then wine, wine is good, but the Church diſcernes an excellency in the loves of God, it's be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>yond all compare, which ſhews that Chriſt wins the ſoul to himſelf, by the inward excellency that appears to the creature to be in him. Ver. 3 <hi>Becauſe of the ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vour of thy good Oyntments.</hi> Here by Oyntments is meant the gifts of God, the human nature of Chriſt was indowed withall, who was anoynted with the Oyl of Gladneſſe above his fellows.</p>
                  <p n="2">2. Theſe did breath forth a ſweet ſavour from Chriſt, as from a Roſe with which the Church is greatly delighted to ſmell unto for refreſhment.</p>
                  <p n="3">3. The Excellency of Chriſt preached and revealed like precious balm powred out, perfumed the perſons hearts that heard it, as with divine odors.</p>

Therefore becauſe of the ſmell and ſavour of his Name and Gifts, the Vir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gins, that is, ſuch as are not yet united to Chriſt in the Goſpell way of marriage, both love and deſire him, as a husband to be injoyed by them.

                  </p>
                  <p n="1">1. In the words ſhe finds in her ſelf a backwardneſſe, a ſlowneſſe toward Chriſt, as the Lord reproved the Diſciples for being ſlow of heart to believe, ſo the Spirit manifeſts hers to her ſelf, within her, and reproves her.</p>
                  <p n="2">2. That it is the work of Chriſt to draw her violently to himſelf, from all, and againſt all difficulties and allurements of the world by his heavenly call:</p>
                  <p n="3">3. This was not in ſome, but the whole Church.</p>
                  <p n="4">4. Chriſt eaſily frees from delaies the delaying ſouls, and makes them find their feet to run after him, who by their delaies ſeem to fail them.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>The King brought me into his Chambers.</hi>

                  <p n="2">2. He brings her into his Chambers, which are the diſtinct adminiſtrations of the Goſpell, under which before ſhe never was, diſtinct from that. <hi>Cap.</hi> 8. <hi>ver.</hi> 2.</p>
                  <p n="3">3. On this ſay the Infants, we wil be glad in thee, not in our ſelves, or any thing elſe beſides thee.</p>
                  <p n="4">4. We ſay the young men will rejoyce, having an addition of joy in this ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cond adminiſtration added unto us, of what we had when in the firſt.</p>
                  <p n="5">5. We Fathers will remember thy love to us before and after calling, when In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fants, and when in their youth, which thought on and remembred, is better then wine, as naturall men ſolace their ſouls with wine, ſo do we with the thoughts of that love that is in thee to us, and hath been ſhewed us.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>The righteous, that is, all Believers love thee from the Child to the Man, grown up in thee.</hi>

The Church ſpeaks of Chriſt as her Love; he anſwers her love, and ſpeaks in love to her again; it was both anſwer and ſpeech alſo to the Churches he now teacheth, and the Church knows his voice from any other: He ſaith to her, <hi>Ariſe,</hi> that is, from thy earthly eſtate to a heavenly, from a ſervant to a Queen, from beggarly Rudiments, to Royal Ornaments Again he calls her to <hi>come away</hi>; the firſt ſhews how hardly the Iews were brought from their Ceremonies, or that they were firſt brought in part from that way of worſhip by Chriſt, and then fully afterward by his Apoſtles. The words in the Original ſignifie <hi>come from thy ſelf,</hi> firſt as natural, and ſecondly, as a member of the Iews Church; here Prophetical<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly is hinted at Chriſt calling, the Apoſtles call, the ſeventy's call at ſeveral ſeaſons.</p>

Chriſt as yet is without the Throne, but now he is about to make one for himſelf; which Throne ſhall be of the <hi>Wood of Lebanon</hi>: That is, the rule of Chriſt ſhall be that in the world was in the time of the Temples eſtate; it is of the <hi>Wood of Lebanon,</hi> and not a new Law to rule by.</p>
                  <p n="1">1. <hi>The Pillars of it are ſilver</hi>: The Law was divided into two Tables, which as Pillars hold up the Throne of Chriſt; for it is ſaid, <hi>The Throne is eſtabliſhed by Juſtice,</hi> and then ſaid to be <hi>ſilver</hi>; becauſe as Silver is to Gold, ſo is the Law to the Goſpel.</p>

                  <p n="3">3. <hi>The ſeat thereof was Purple</hi>: Purple being a rich and Kingly colour, did ſet out the Authority Chriſt had received from God to rule by, and that others had to rule under him.</p>
                  <p n="4">4. <hi>The middeſt of it was a Coal of Love</hi>: To ſhew, that that which was com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prehended within the Pillars of the Law, was <hi>Love</hi>; a Love like that of Fire, much water could not quench it; and that Gods Throne of Juſtice was full of Love to the Daughters of <hi>Jeruſalem</hi>; or that God ruled in a way of Love over Men, commanding love of men to himſelf and others.</p>

                  <p n="5">5. Chriſt would before the extremity of Apoſtacy have her open unto him, as in the admonition to the ſeven Churche, <hi>Rev. Cap.</hi> 2 <hi>&amp;</hi> 3. The laſt whereof, which was the time of this knocking, and was the Church eſtate of Leodicea, <hi>Rev.</hi> 3.</p>

                  <p>Chriſt would have awakned her, and have come in to her, and feaſted with her, and have reformed the corruptions come in upon her.</p>

                  <p n="2">2. His locks, which were thoſe believed on him in that corrupt age, were troubled with the drops of the night, which the then Doctrine was but as the drops of a cold Winter night to a mans head.</p>

                  <p>Note here, ſhe calls him, when he was gone to come again, or to know when he would come, or why he was gone, but ſaith the Text, <hi>he anſwered me not.</hi> She being thus crying after Chriſt, the Watchmen, the Prieſts of Antichriſts eſtate, here called the city, or falſe Church, they found her, that is, diſcern'd her oppoſition of their errors and love to the truth: Indeed ſo diligent and watchfull were theſe watchmen of the night eſtate, though it were dark, they would quickly eſpie and find them out, as a light is eaſie diſcerned in a dark place.</p>

               <p>Ver. 5. Who is this cometh up from the wilderneſſe.</p>
               <p>As I was ſlow writing theſe words, I find Mr. <hi>Brightman</hi> to hint hereon, that on this coming up out of the wilderneſſe, and in the other places of this book, is meant the reſtoration of the church, whoſe words I thought good to inſert, to take away the reproach that ſome may caſt upon the ground, and way I have here laid down, and uſed in the expounding this book, as of novelty, fancy, &amp;c. as ſilly men are wont to do.</p>
               <p>

               <p>And by who is this, <hi>cujus nominis eſt haec gens quae aſcend it è deſerto.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="1">1. When rather I underſtand it thus, that the church having been in the wilder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe, and the ſtate of the Law government loſt above 1200. years, &amp; the form vvhereof being unknown to the world, on Gods diſcovery of it men ſtand amazed, and cry out, <hi>who is this.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="2">2. This is clearly proved, in that the body of the Song contains á diſcovery of theſe eſtates, and of Chriſt their King, as of things hidden and unknown.</p>
               <p n="3">3· By the wilderneſſe is meant the ſtate of the world, oppoſed to the garden or church of God, which God in the Revelation calls the Antichriſtian eſtate, <hi>Rev.</hi> 12.6. where the woman the church is driven into the wilderneſſe, or world eſtate, Anti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chriſt baptiſm and church being no better then the reſt of the unbaptized world.</p>
               <p n="4">4. Out of this world of the Antichriſtian eſtate ſhall the Gentile church firſt aſcend, &amp; the Jews church eſtate aſcends out of the <hi>Mahometan</hi> world eſtate, being <hi>Gog</hi> &amp; <hi>Magog.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="5">5. The word ſignifies to aſcend, as alluding to the 37 <hi>Ezek.</hi> 1.12. when God brings the Iews out of their graves, and bone, and fleſh, and skin, and breath, by the miniſte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry, in the four winds come on them and reſtore them.</p>
               <p n="6">6. God here underſtands not any particular Nations or Churches, nor is it warran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>table to apply them ſo, the Scripture of the Old Teſtament, comprehending all under the two generall tearms of the Iews and Gentiles, it is true Prophecy ſpeaks of the ſtates of the world in particular, as the four Empires, and the ten Kingdomes, and their periods, but for the Church in Prophecy, the ſpirits purpoſe is after the call of the Iews &amp; Gentiles, before which they vvere two, but after ſpeaks of them as one, &amp; for that that of <hi>Paul,</hi> and <hi>Johns</hi> writing of particular Churches, and naming them warrants, not us; where that particular is not ſpoken of but generall only, ver. 8. of this chap. hath the ſignification of ſome high matter, of which I ſhall ſay ſomething when I come to ſpeak thereof.</p>
               <p n="8">8. <hi>Leauing on her belowed,</hi> that is, depending on the ſtrength, help, and power of Chriſt, to bring her thence againſt the povver of her oppoſers.</p>
               <p n="8">8. <hi>I raiſed thee up under the apple tree,</hi> by the apple tree is meant Chriſt, <hi>Cant.</hi> 2.3. the apple tree among the trees, Chriſt among other Kings, is as the apple tree among the fruitleſſe trees of the wood.</p>
               <p n="2">2. <hi>Under it,</hi> that is, Chriſt coming to take a people to himſelf in the vvay of the old Covenant nationally, the Iew grows jealóus, that God hath put him avvay, and taken a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nother people to himſelf, to vvife, vvhich raiſeth them up, <hi>Deut.</hi> 32.21. <hi>Rom.</hi> 10.19. <hi>Luke</hi> 15.28.29.</p>
               <p n="3">3. By <hi>I raiſed thee up,</hi> is meant Chriſt raiſed her up, who ſpeaks here, and the vvord is, <hi>I made thee to be raiſed up.</hi>

               </p>
               <p>Verſe 6. <hi>Set me as a ſeal upon thy heant</hi>; they are the words of Chriſt to the Church after he had raiſed her up, ſignifying that he deſired nothing of her for all he had done for her, but her love.</p>
               <p n="2">2. That he ſhould be the ſeal of her heart, whence ſhe ſhould let nothing go without his leave to any, nor to worſhip, love, or fear any beſides himſelf, all being to be ſhut up to him, and for him.</p>
               <p n="3">3. <hi>Set me as a ſeal upon thy ſeed,</hi> our tranſlation reads on thy arm, by the ſeal here I underſtand Baptiſme, which all the ſeed of the Church were to be ſealed with, that is ſet apart from others to Jeſus Chriſt; which time ſtate and work is foretold by <hi>John, Revel.</hi> 7.2. where the Man that God authorizeth in his name to conſtitute the church, is ſaid to be an Angel having the ſeal of God, who ſealed the Jews tribes, <hi>verſe</hi> 4. to the 8.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Note.</hi> The Reaſons why Chriſt requires the Church thus to ſet him as a ſeal on her heart, and on her children, are ſet down in that that remains of this <hi>verſe,</hi> and in the ſeventh <hi>verſe.</hi>

               <p>
                  <hi>Reaſon</hi> 2. Or thus, as if Chriſt ſhould ſay, my love to thee made me dye for thee, and now, if thou ſhouldſt not love me, and ſet me as a ſeal upon thy heart, it would prove again as ſtrong as death was to me, when I dyed.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Reaſon</hi> 3. Jealouſie is as the grave for cruelty, God is ſet forth to be a jealous God over the Jews in the firſt Covenant, Chriſt in the ſecond; but Chriſts jealouſie is of the heart, that the Church loves not ſo ſingly, cordially, ſpiritually, the Lord her huſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>band as ſhe ought.</p>
               <p>Which as the grave, he would devour all that in heart adulterated the Covenant, or Marriage-bed of Chriſt.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Reaſon</hi> 4. The coles thereof, are the coles that the fire <hi>Jah</hi> hath kindled, here ſome only uſe the word <hi>Jah</hi> as a Hebraiſme to ſet forth the greatneſs or vehemency of the flame of it, but I rather do thus underſtand them; the coles of this jealouſie are kindled by the fire or heat of zeal that is from <hi>Jah</hi> or <hi>Jehovah</hi> my God-head, to whom all is due, and with whom none is to be Corrival.</p>
               <p>Verſe 5. <hi>Many waters cannot quench love,</hi> in which Chriſt would again mitigate the expreſſion uſed before, in which his love as jealouſie was as fire, or a flame, coles, to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſume, a conſuming fire, &amp; now ſhews that many or much waters cannot quench his love, and whereas the Apoſtle ſaith, <hi>love covereth a multitude of ſins,</hi> ſo ſin like water here, though it abound in the Saints, yet it cannot quench the flame of Gods love, nor can the floods, that is, ſome exceeding gluts of ſin on ſome temptations, they neither can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not drown it, but love will exceed them, and be above them.</p>
               <p n="6">6. If a man would give all the ſubſtance of his houſe, with a lover, it would be ut<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terly deſpiſed, Chriſt applies moſt ſweetly in theſe words, to ſhew the effects of a faithful woman loving her husband, ſaying if a man would intice her to adulterate her husbands bed, and to offer to give her the ſubſtance of his houſe, ſhe would in deſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing, deſpiſe it that is exceeding, contemn him and them, now ſaith Chriſt, if a wo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man will do this for her husband that loves him, how canſt thou ſay thou loveſt me, and
<pb n="38" facs="tcp:103749:22"/>
not do the like, have not I deſerved more of thee then any man of any woman. Our or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinary Tranſlation to me ſeems ſtrange, I know no right ſenſe can be given of it, which ſaith, if a man would give all the ſubſtance of his houſe for love, it would utterly be deſpiſed.</p>
               <p n="1">1. As if the Church could not obtaine Chriſts love, or as if ſhe were to buy it.</p>
               <p n="2">2. As if Chriſt could not, or had not purchaſed the Churches love.</p>

               <p n="6">6. She hath no breaſts or true and lawfull Miniſtry, which cannot be the Iews ſpeak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of the Gentiles who had Miniſtry before them, nor do I think it to be the Gentiles ſpeaking of the Iews, but the Iews ſpeaking of ſome of their own Tribes.
