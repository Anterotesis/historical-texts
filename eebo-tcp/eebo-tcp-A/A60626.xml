         <editorialDecl>
            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

               <salute>Dear Friends,</salute>
            </opener>
            <p>IN the deep Senſe of that living Voice, which hath
called you out of Darkneſs, to the Light of Life;
there is ſomething upon me to communicate unto
you, for the furtherance of your Faith and mutual Joy,
and for the Settling and Eſtabliſhing your Hearts and
Minds in the Power of the Goſpel of Chriſt, which
hath been, and ſtill is preached unto you for Life and
Salvation; that as the Lord hath called you by his Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venly
Voice, ſo you may all obey from your Hearts that
bleſſed Doctrine, which by his Holy Spirit hath been
plentifully held forth amongſt you, unto Converſion, E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dification
and Comfort; that through your Obedience
you may witneſs the Lord to make choice of you, as a
peculiar People, to ſhew forth his Praiſe, and ſo make
your Calling and Election ſure, For though many
may be called, yet if they do not obey from the Heart
that Spirit by which they are called, they may not be
choſen; and ſo a Profeſſion of Truth may be held out
of the Life and Power of it; and you cannot but know
what all Profeſſions are, out of the Life and Power of
Truth; For when you were ſeeking after God in bare
Profeſſions, you could not find true Satisfaction to your
Souls; but were cumbred about many things, and want<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
One Thing that was only needful; and now the
Lord in his Mercy hath enlightened you with his true
Light, in which you ſee the many things, and their emp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tineſs,
<pb n="4" facs="tcp:93251:3"/>
and are come to know One Thing, which is the
Fulneſs, and in which ye have all Life, Power and Bleſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſings;
and ſo far as ye are come to witneſs the Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtance,
ye have the true ſavour of good Things in one
Thing, where all is contained; and it is the Love of
God unto you, that hath ſo diſpoſed your Hearts towards
himſelf, and as a Cord hath drawn you out of things be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low,
which are changeable, to a feeling of that which
is Immortal, and never changeth; and as the Love of
God is the ground of your change from things below
into things that are above, ſo it is a ſafe and ſure
Foundation for you to ſtand upon; for in it ſelf it doth not
admit of any Alteration, but is alwayes firm and ſure in
its own Nature and Life; and as ye are faſtened to it,
and ſtand upon it, you will find it to be a Rock of Strength
unto your Feet: And what can be more deſirable to
you, then the Thing that ye have ſound, the Thing
which in it ſelf is of an Immortal Nature, and yieldeth
Immortal Riches? can you fix your Eye <hi>upon any thing among
the many things,</hi> or <hi>upon all the many things,</hi> to deſire after any
one or all of them? Can you part from your Foundation,
which is ſure and ſafe, and is a Rock of Strength to your
Feet, to joyn or cloſe with any thing, or things, which are of
a lower degree in nature and quallity? Oh! no, my Friends,
your Safety is to ſtand in that which is ſafe in it ſelf; yea,
to ſtand in the Light, where the Love of God firſt reach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
unto you, and by which ye have felt the greatneſs
of his Power working in you; in that is your ſafety,
as being ſafe in it ſelf: For you may be tried with an
Hour of Temptation, but as you ſtand in the Light and
Power of God, ye will overcome it, and ſo you will feel
the Rock to be Strength to your Feet, that they may not

               <g ref="char:punc">▪</g> and by the mighty Power of God you will be kept,
<pb n="5" facs="tcp:93251:3"/>
as ye ſtand and abide in it, and the Hour of Temptation wil
paſs over; and ſo you will not fall into Snares to be en<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>tangled,
but walk in the pleaſant Path of Life to you
endleſs Comfort: For what were your dayes when ye
were cumbred about many things? Were they not full of
Trouble, Grief and Sorrow? Did not the Seed Mourn
whilſt ye were profeſſing God in that nature, which glo<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ried
in Appearance only? And did you not ten go a
a People bowed down under the Bondage of Corruption
And were not many of you in that time caſt down, as
a People without Hope? and were you not brought to lay
your Hands upon your Loines for very feebleneſs? And
was there not a ſecret Cry, <hi>That the Lord would appear, and
ſhew you his Salvation; and that he would guide and direct
you in the Way where you might find his Preſence?</hi> And how
wonderfully did God appear for you in that great Streight
as having regard to the <hi>Cry of the Poor and the Sighing of the
Needy?</hi> And how did he manifeſt his Light in you, to
give Light unto you? And did he not then ſend forth the
Meſſengers of his Covenant in the Spirit of firſt born
among many Brethren? And did not thoſe Meſſenger
declare the Way of God's Salvation to you, and ſound<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ed
Glad-tidings in your Ears? Did they not inſtruct
you into the Way of Life, Peace and Truth, and preach
the Light to be the Way that leadeth unto God? And
was not their Meſſage a faithful Teſtimony, that reach<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ed
the Faithful Witneſs in every Conſcience, and ſo la<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>boured
to bring all to the Witneſs in themſelves? And
when this Glad-tidings was ſounded in your Ears, and
that your Ears heard, and your Hearts believed; did you
not begin to ſee the emptineſs of all other pretended Meſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſengers,
and came to a feeling of God's Witneſs in your
own Conſciences, and ſo came to know the Thi<gap reason="illegible" extent="1 span">

               <pb n="6" facs="tcp:93251:4"/>
reprovable, and to learn of that which reproved? And
did not the Lord herein ſhew great Kindneſs unto you,
that when you were as a People without Hope in a wea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ried
Condition, then to appear to manifeſt the Way
of Life, wherein you might find Reſt to your Souls?
And hath not the Lord now ſhewed you a pleaſant Path,
where Mercy and Truth meets together, and where Righ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teouſneſs
and Peace embrace and kiſs each other? Oh!
<hi>never to be forgotten Mercies, but worthy to be had in Everlaſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
Remembrance:</hi> And ye are happy that keep in <hi>remem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brance</hi>
the Days and Times paſt, wherein God hath ſhewed
you Favour; for thereby you come to feel his Love, Mercies
and Favours to be more enlarged unto you; and as ye
are come out of the many things, and have found One
Thing to be the chiefeſt, ſo all mind to keep it as a Pearl
of great Price: For ye have found the Lord's Chriſt,
and the Lord's Chriſt is become your Strength, and Stay,
and Salvation; and this is very weighty to be felt upon
every ones Heart, <hi>That the Living God hath revealed his Son in
you, and that ye know him to be the Lord's Chriſt;</hi> this is that
alone in which your Peace and Felicity ſtandeth immuta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble,
and is of far greater worth and value then the many
things: And as in the Light ye have found the Riches
and Treaſures of an Endleſs Life, even ſo to keep in the
Light; and keep your Poſſeſſion, and be not drawn out
with any Whimſical Fancies and Conceits to loſe your
Poſſeſſion; it is the Word of the living God unto you all:
For the Lord hath ſhewed great Kindneſs unto you, that
ye might glorifie him in your Bodies, Souls and Spirits,
as being his, and ſo to Honour the Lord in all things,
for the exceeding Riches of his Kindneſs towards you:
for it is required of all, unto whom the Lord hath ſhew<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
Kindneſs, that they be found faithful, and ſo to behold
<pb n="7" facs="tcp:93251:4"/>
the Lord in his goings, and go with him, then all will
know the things that concern their Peace, and things
by which they may edifie one another, and ſo be a Help
and Comfort one to another, even as God is a Help and
Comfort unto them: For, how wonderful is the Work
which the Lord hath wrought for you in <hi>Egypt,</hi> and bring<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
you out of <hi>Egypt,</hi> and carrying you through many
Tryals, and delivering you from many Enemies; for the
Deliverer is come to open the Priſon Door, and ſet the
Captive at Liberty; yea, he is come who hath all Pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er
in Heaven and Earth, Chriſt Jeſus, the great Deliver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er,
the only <hi>Saviour, Preſerver, Sanctifier,</hi> and <hi>Juſtifier;</hi> and
ye that know his coming, ye are Witneſſes of the great<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs
of his Work, and of his Power, Might and Strength
in working; and ſo ye are ſenſible into what Root ye
are planted by the Right hand of the Almighty; and
ye know that ye ſpring up in his Life, as his Off-ſpring,
and that the Pluckers cannot pluck you out of his Hand;
for all have been plucking at you, but cannot pluck you
out of the Hand of your Planter; and ſo, he that hath
planted you into his Life, he keeps you from being pluck't
out of it; and it is his <hi>great Mercy unto you,</hi> in that he hath
planted you into ſuch a <hi>bleſſed Root,</hi> and raiſed you up into it,
and keeps you from being plucked out of it; here he gives
unto you eternal Life, that ye ſhould no periſh, but live for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever;
and ſo he hath choſen you, and ordained you to bring
forth Fruit, and that your Fruit ſhould remain; for Chriſt
Jeſus keeps you by his Power in your Plantation, and none
can pluck you out of your Plantation. Therefore all abide
in him, who is not of the World, but hath choſen you out of
the World; yea, I ſay, abide in him and your Fruit will re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>main,
and will not be ſhaken and ſpoiled with Storms and
Tempeſts, and ſo you will flouriſh like the <hi>Palm</hi> Tree, and
<pb n="8" facs="tcp:93251:5"/>
grow like the <hi>Cedars</hi> in <hi>Libanon:</hi> for you that truſt iu the Lord
and whoſe Hope the Lord is, you are as Trees planted by
the Waters; and that ſpread out their Roots by the Ri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vers,
and ſhall not ſee when heat cometh, but their
Leaf ſhall be green, and ſhall not be careful in the Year
of Drought, or in the Year of Reſtraint, neither
ſhall ceaſe from yielding Fruit: And ſo the Almighty
God hath choſen you in this day to bear the fruits of Righ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teouſneſs
in his Righteous Life, and by that Fruit ye ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour
the God of your Salvation, who keeps you in his
Life from being plucked out. And ſo all live in the
Faith, which in the Power of God ye have received;
keep in the Power that is able to keep you unto the End,
and ſo by Faith get Victory over the World, and pleaſe
God; and add to your Faith Patience, <hi>that ye may not
think the time long in which your Faith is trying:</hi> for the trying
of your Faith worketh Patience, to bring forth Fruit;
<hi>therefore let Patience have its perfect work, that ye may be entire,
lacking nothing;</hi> and as ye have purified your Souls in
obeying the Truth through the Spirit, unto unfeigned
Love of the Brethren, ſo let your Love be continued
as in the beginning; for Brethren, <hi>that keep the Faith,
they labour in the Love, which edifies the Body;</hi> and as ye
love the Brethren that keep the Faith, there will be no
entertainment for the Grudger and Evil Surmizer; for
where that ſpirit is entertained, it corrupts the mind with
Evil Thoughts and Self-Conceits, and that runs into
Self-Separation, Diviſion and Diſtraction; but as ye
walk in the Light you will feel the Love over all ſuch
things; and ſo love the Brethren, and one another un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feignedly,
and that is your Strength, by which the Pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er
of Darkneſs is to be overcome; for Unity in the Un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feigned
Love is the Strength of the Body, and ſo it is a
<pb n="9" facs="tcp:93251:5"/>
compleat Body under the Rule and Government of Chriſt
Jeſus the Head; and he in all things hath the prehe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minence
unto whom all belongs.</p>
            <p>And all walk worthy of the tender Mercies which
God hath largely manifeſted unto you; and take heed
of giving or taking any Occaſion of Offence, but all
mind your own Conditions and Concernments; and let
none be Wiſe in their own Eyes, but look upon them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves
with that Eye which can prefer another; for the
lowly Mind, that keeps in the Light, is preſerved in
the Love that thinketh no ill, and in Love is ready to
ſerve, and doth not ſeek to be a Maſter; for if ſuch a
thing doth at any time ariſe, Offences are at hand, and
that doth much hurt as it is put in practice; therefore
all avoid ſuch things, by living in the True Simplicity
and Peaceable Wiſdom, that ye may all keep the Faith
that works by Love, and edifies the Body; and ſo all
will live as Brethren, in a faithful Teſtimony to God's
Glory, and there his Preſence will be with you, and your
Joy will be full.</p>
            <p>And all keep down to the Power that keeps in the
Life, that all your words may ſavour of Life; for the
words of Life are Gracious words, by which Grace is
miniſtred to the Hearers; but where words ſwell above
the Life, they only influence upon the Affections, which
draweth out of the Peaceable and Quiet Habitation, and
from feeling the weighty Life in its Reſurrection, and
all ſuch Motions run whirling about in the Air, and that
ſtirreth up Tempeſts, where all are toſſed about with
Wind and Waves: Therefore all wait to be ſtayed
with the Power of God, which is the Anchor of the
Soul, both ſure and ſtedfaſt. For when the Life riſes,
<pb n="10" facs="tcp:93251:6"/>
it riſes with weight, and all that riſe in the Life, they
are ſound and weighty; for, they ſtand in the center of
Life, and are moved by the motion of it; and there
all are preſerved in Wiſdom and Underſtanding, and are
alwayes nouriſhed with the Nouriſhment that in the
Life is preſent, and ſo are alwayes living and fruit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful
in a certain ſtate; and here all come to be kept in
the true Tenderneſs and Sweetneſs, out of all Flattery
and Feignedneſs; for the Affections move uncertainly,
and never do eſtabliſh any in their goings, but ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times
will appear as living in the higheſt degree, and
then again will fall and dye, and be as nothing; and
that is an uncertain State, where none can ſtand ſure:
therefore all mind the Life, and the weighty ſavory words
of Life, that with the Life every one may be truly re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>freſhed,
comforted and ſtabliſhed.</p>
            <p>Oh Friends! Be ye all watchful to the Heavenly
Light, to be preſerved in the feeling of Eternal Life,
that ye may all follow the Lamb in his goings, and not
go into any thing that is contrary to him; for that draw<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth
a vail over the Life, and obſtructeth the Vertue,
and then the pettiſh part is ready to be exceptious, and
ſtreighten the Life, and the Unity in it, and ſo the evil
Eye comes to be opened, and the Whiſperer and Repor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
to be let at liberty, and then the Enemy works into
parties, to ſpoil the Heritage of God; and it is ſet much
upon me by the Spirit of the Lord to warn and exhort
all Friends, To be very circumſpect in all their wayes,
and to keep to the Light, by which they were firſt con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vinced,
and in which true Love aboundeth, that none
may run out, and grieve the Spirit of the Lord, and
<pb n="11" facs="tcp:93251:6"/>
bring Grief one upon anothet, but all keep in the good
Unity of the Spirit, which is the Bond of Peace, and
ſo all will underſtand what to joyn unto, and what to
ſtand at a diſtance from; for a good Underſtanding keep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth
good Order, and they that have attained to it,
they ſpeak with the Spirit and with an Underſtanding,
and pray with the Spirit and with an Underſtanding,
and ſing with the Spirit and with an Underſtanding,
and with the Spirit and with an Underſtanding God is glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rified;
and unto his Bleſſed Name and Power be Glory
forever, <hi>Amen.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>And Friends, Be very mindful in all things where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in
you are concerned, to anſwer the Lord in Obedience
and Faithfulneſs to the End, that your Hearts and Minds
may be conſtant to perſevere in the Way of Godli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs,
that in the Light you may feel the Strength
and Power of Life, to do the Will of God; and ſo
the Lord will keep you in his Way, as a People
that are ordered and diſpoſed in his Counſel, and you
will be as a <hi>Holy Generation,</hi> and a <hi>Royal Prieſthood,</hi> to
offer a living Sacrifice of Praiſe upon his own Altar:
For the <hi>Lord</hi> is exceeding good to all that faithfully
love him and ſerve him; he is nigh to help them where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in
his Name and Truth is concerned; for his Power
is as the Wings of an <hi>Eagle<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
               </hi> and where his Power
beareth up, there is no fainting, but a Faithful Conti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nuing
with Joyfulneſs, <hi>to ſerve Him unto the End.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Therefore, all keep in the <hi>Light,</hi> which the Meſſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gers
of the Covenant firſt preached unto you, and by
which your Hearts were touched and turned unto <hi>God;</hi>
abide in that, as being the one and only in which the
<pb n="12" facs="tcp:93251:7"/>
               <hi>Love, Life, Spirit, Power</hi> and <hi>Wiſdom of God</hi> reſteth;
for all reſteth in the <hi>Light,</hi> and in the <hi>Light</hi> all comes
to be witneſſed in one Nature and Beeing: and what<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſoever
would draw your Minds from the <hi>Light,</hi> under
any Colour or Pretence, let it not prevail over you,
but ſtand in the <hi>Light,</hi> and reſiſt it as your Enemy: For,
as the <hi>Light</hi> is only true, ſo there is to be an abiding in
it; for all that go from it, to find any thing true above
it, they err from the Faith, and wrong themſelves;
or, who go from the <hi>Light,</hi> to embrace the World, they
enter into the Houſe of Bondage; and where the Ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>my
ſo prevaileth over any, it is becauſe there is not
Faithfulneſs to the <hi>Light,</hi> For, if there be Faithful<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs
to the <hi>Light,</hi> the Wiles of the Enemy are diſcover<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed,
and Dangers prevented; for the <hi>Light</hi> lifts up it
ſelf as a Standard againſt the ſubtil Worker: And ſo
with the <hi>Light</hi> the Faithful are preſerved in their Faith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fulneſs,
to walk with God, and do his Will, and there
they grow in <hi>Grace</hi> and <hi>Godlineſs,</hi> by which the Truth is
Honoured.</p>
            <p>And herein the great Love of <hi>God</hi> is manifeſt to all
the Faithful, who are indeed his Choſen, and unto
whom his Arm is ſtretched forth for their Preſervation;
he only is the <hi>God</hi> of their Salvation, and in his <hi>Life</hi> he
cauſeth all his tender Plants to grow, and with his Ver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tue
he gives them Nouriſhment, to make them live and
be fruitful; yea, it is He, and none Elſe, he whoſe
Name endures forever; and all that wait upon him his
Grace falls upon them: Therefore truſt ye in Him,
whoſe Name is, <hi>I am, The Lord Strong and Mighty, The
Everlaſting Immortal God, The Power that is able to ſubdue all
things to it ſelf,</hi> by which ye may all feel the Reſurrection
<pb n="13" facs="tcp:93251:7"/>
of the Immortal Seed, and of the Seed to be born again,
and ſo as Heirs of <hi>Life</hi> to inherit <hi>Life,</hi> and in <hi>Life</hi> to
live, that the <hi>Alpha</hi> and <hi>Omega,</hi> the <hi>Beginning</hi> and <hi>End<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing,</hi>
may be your Reſt: And as ye all dwell in the
<hi>Light,</hi> you will be ſenſible of the Drawings and Lead<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings
of his Hand ſince the Day in which he firſt Ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peared
to you, and how he hath driven back Enemies
before you, and brought you forward into a Wealthy Place;
yea, a Place where ye have found durable Riches: and
keeping in the Weighty Power you will have a weigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty
Life, and ſo be found as ſuch that walk worthy of
the Vocation, unto which God hath called you; and
there you will know the goings on from one degree of
Godlineſs to another, unto the Perfect State in Chriſt
Jeſus, and ſo you will not haſtily flye up into the Air,
but learn your Goings by degrees, and walk ſafely, and
there your Way will be pleaſant to you, and your Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward
a Crown: for, who overcometh, the <hi>Lord</hi> will
Crown; the Overcomers muſt wear the Crown, as a
Token of their Victory over all things contrary to Truth
and Purity, and alſo, as their Glory before him who ſets
the Crown upon their Head; and ſuch Honour have all
the Saints: <hi>And ſo in the Power of God all get Victory, and
Overcome, that ye may wear the Crown.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>And all be mindful wherein ye are concerned one to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards
another in all things, that the Peace of <hi>God</hi> in all
your Hearts may rule, and that the pure Movings of
<hi>God's Power</hi> ye may all know in your Underſtandings, that
every one may know their going forth and coming in as
the Power ordereth, and then the Order will be kept,
and not broken; for if the true Power be not under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtood
<pb n="14" facs="tcp:93251:8"/>
in its Movings, but that another thing moveth
and acteth, that thing breaks the Order; and none do
keep the Order of the <hi>Goſpel,</hi> but who live in the
Power and underſtandeth the Motion of it; and ſo all
are to wait upon God, to underſtand his Counſel and
do his Will, and not follow their own Counſel, and do
their own Wills; for, if any do ſo, they will run into
Confuſion, aud come to nothing; but who ſtand in the
Counſel of the <hi>Lord,</hi> and do his Will, they ſerve him
in the order of his own <hi>Life,</hi> by which he hath Glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry:
And ſo all is to be kept down with the Power,
that nothing may be ſeen or heard but the pure Seed
in its own pure <hi>Life,</hi> and then you will feel what the
<hi>Lord</hi> makes up to himſelf, and what he caſteth out,
that muſt not come within the Borders of his Land,
nor within the Gates of his City, nor within the Doors
of his Houſhold and Family; but is ſeparated and caſt
out, as an unclean thing, which with his Jewels he will
not make up; For it is in the Seed that he planteth,
and buildeth, and maketh up his Jewels; and ſo he fit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
frames his Building together, and i<gap reason="illegible" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap> Him it grows
unto an Holy Temple, and there is the Habitation of
God through his Spirit; and ſo the Houſe is built upon
the Rock, and not upon the Sand; and the Houſhold
are fed with Bread of the fineſt Wheat, and not with
Husks and Chaff; and he is Lord and King in his own
Houſe, to Rule, Order and Govern his Houſhold; and
his Houſhold live in Order, and not in Confuſion, and
here ye will all have Reſt and fulneſs of Joy.</p>
            <p>Therefore, be Faithful to the End in all things, that
ye may Serve, Worſhip and Honour the God of all
Power and Greatneſs, that by your Faithfulneſs his
<pb n="15" facs="tcp:93251:8"/>
               <hi>Power</hi> and <hi>Greatneſs</hi> over all the Earth may be exalted,
and his Name ſet above every Name in its own Excel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lency.</p>
            <p>And ſo, in every good Word and Work be ye all
Fruitful, and walk in a Holy and Blameleſs Conver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſation;
that he, who is <hi>Life,</hi> may be known to be the
ROOT and TREE by the Fruit of Righteouſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs,
who is to Day as Yeſterday, and the ſame for
ever.</p>
            <p>And Friends, Be Careful to Honour <hi>God</hi> in all
things; for he Honoureth thoſe that Honoureth him:
And take heed that none Diſhonour <hi>God</hi> by fond Af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fections
one towards another; for if any go fondly to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether
upon the account of Marriage, they Diſhonour
<hi>God,</hi> and hurt themſelves: And none to be buſie in
making Motions between Party and Party, or to per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwade
any to change their Conditions, in which they
themſelves are ſatisfied to continue and abide; but let
every one feel the Truth in themſelves, and the Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vings
of it in their own Hearts, to diſpoſe them in ſuch
a Weighty Concernment, and then the <hi>Ordinance of God</hi>
will be known in the Covenant of Life; and ſuch
a Marriage will Honour God, as being Honourable in
the Undefiled Seed.</p>
            <p>And all keep your Judgment in the Power, Life,
and Wiſdom that judgeth Righteouſly, that you may
be able to diſcern and try ſpirits, whether they are of
God; and let no fair Shew or Appearance out of the
Life come over you to vail your Judgment and Diſcer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning,
nor no feigned Love or Humility ſway your Affe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctions;
<pb n="16" facs="tcp:93251:9"/>
for if any let in ſuch things, by letting out
themſelves to comply or joyn with them, they will let
Darkneſs over their Judgment, and loſe their Judge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment,
and then they cannot put a Difference between
the Precious and the Vile in a ſound Judgement, and
ſo may be taken and ſnared with a ſmooth formed ſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit
in Carriage or Words. Therefore all be mindful
and careful to keep Sound Judgment, that not any
thing, contrary to the Spirit and Life of God, may
come over you; but keep the Judgment of Truth up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
all, and ſet true Judgment over all; and do not
ſet a Byaſs upon your Judgment, to turn or wreſt you
aſide in Judgment; but all Judge in Truth and Righ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teouſneſs,
in which you will alſo feel the Mercy.</p>
            <p>And all keep in the Stayed Sollid Life, and let not
your Minds run after New Things, to draw you from
the Sound and Weighty Truth which you have ſeen,
and heard, and believed, but what is manifeſted unto
you, either by Word or Writing, let the Heavenly
Truth be Received, and Embraced, and Lived in, and
none to run after new things to forget the old; and
ſo you will all keep in mind the Sound and Whole<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſome
Doctrine, which hath plentifully been delivered
by Faithful Brethren, both by Word and Epiſtle; and
the Doctrine will abide and remain in you, and you
will abide and remain in the Doctrine: For, the preach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
of the Grace of God by Jeſus Chriſt is the Sound
and Wholeſom Doctrine, which all are to receive and
believe; and whether it be preached by Word or E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>piſtle,
it ſettleth and eſtabliſheth the Heart and Mind
of thoſe that receive it, and believe in it; and they come
<pb n="17" facs="tcp:93251:9"/>
to grow in Grace, which is the Doctrine preached un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to
them, and by them received and believed: And
ſo, Sound Doctrine maketh a Sound People; and you
that have received it, and believe in it, you are made
Sound by it; and whatſoever is manifeſt of that Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture,
as a renewing of the Teſtimony, it doth more
confirm you in the Doctrine which ye have already
received, but never draweth you from it; and ſo you
keep the Doctrine from firſt to laſt, and do not forget
any part of it: And you do well that keep in mind
the Sound and Wholſom Doctrine of the Goſpel, and
the Sound and Wholſom Exhortations with which ye
have been exhorted into Obedience and Faithfulneſs
in things pertaining to the Goſpel-Doctrine, and ſo
keepeth in the Goſpel-Fellowſhip and Order; yea, I
ſay, ye do well who are thus mindful of that Doctrine,
which in and by the Spirit of God hath been preach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
unto you; ye keep in that which is Sound and
Wholſom, aud out of that which Putrifies and Cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rupts,
and ſo come to live in the ingrafted Word, that
is able to ſave your Souls.</p>
            <p>And all Friends, Keep your Meetings in the Faith,
and hold faſt the Profeſſion of your Faith in all Meet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings;
and keep in mind the great Refreſhment with
which ye have been refreſhed in Meetings, and which
ſtill remains with all the Faithful; and watch againſt
that ſpirit and nature which at any time bringeth Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vineſs
and Drouſineſs upon you in Meetings; and
when you feel ſuch a thing coming upon you, do not
give way to it, to be overcome by it, but with the
Power of God reſiſt it in time, and ſo you will feel
<pb n="18" facs="tcp:93251:10"/>
the Power as a Spring of Living Water, to refreſh your
Souls.</p>
            <p>Oh! let your Dilligence be improved in Watchful<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs
and Perſeverance, that ye may all feel the Pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er
and Life over that which would at any time vail you
from beholding the excellent Glory and from perta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king
of the Heavenly and Living Vertue, that ſo you
may all feel the Arm which preſerveth, and drink at
the River which Refreſheth and Nouriſheth, that ye
may be Strong in the Lord, and in the Power of his
Might, and ſo be able to reſiſt and overcome the Ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>my
in all his Appearances. And in all your Meet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings
be tender over the Good one in another, that ye
may be a Comfort one to another; and ſo, in the
Peaceable Wiſdom to live and Glorifie God.</p>
            <p>And Friends, Do not run into Superfluities in Meats,
Drinks or Apparrel, to come under the Power of any;
but all wait to be preſerved in Sobriety, Temperance,
and Humility: And do not faſhion your ſelves like un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to
the World, in their Novelties and new Faſhions;
for they know not what to eat or drink, or put on,
and ſo are from that which ſhould lead them into Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lineſs
and Modeſty, and follow that which leadeth
them into Vanity and Folly; but do you dwell in the
Heavenly LIGHT, by which you may Adorn the
Bleſſed Goſpel, and Honour the Lord God of all your
Mercies.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="19" facs="tcp:93251:10"/>
Finally, Brethren, Fare-ye-well; Live in Peace,
and Truth, and Holineſs, and Righteouſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs,
and Godlineſs, and Love, and the God
of Love, and Peace and of all Heavenly
Vertues and Graces will be with you, into
whoſe Everlaſting Arms I commit you, and
in the Love of his Life I am dearly with you
all.</p>
