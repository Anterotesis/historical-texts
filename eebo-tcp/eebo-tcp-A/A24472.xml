            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

               <p>THe Engagement that happen'd between His Majeſty's Forces, Quarter'd at <hi>Reading,</hi> and the Prince of <hi>Orange</hi>'s Van-Guard (then paſſing thro' the Town) is variouſly Reported: But, according to the moſt credible Information, is Thus:</p>
               <p>That the Princes Army was there, and Quarter'd in the Town, is undeniable; and that <hi>Reading</hi>-Coach on <hi>Saturday</hi> Night ſtay'd, and allighted their Paſſengers, Five Miles off this ſide the Town, not adventuring to go any further.</p>
               <p>The ſame Night the King's Forces withdrew from the Town, forming themſelves into a Body, put themſelves in a poſture of Defence. On <hi>Sunday</hi> Morning, they were Aſſaulted by the <hi>Dutch</hi> Forces; where there was a hot Skirmiſh, and ſeveral Kill'd on both Sides. The Relation is differently Diſcours'd of; ſome advancing the Loſs on one Side to Thouſands, with unproportionable Loſs on the other. The moſt probable Account is of thoſe that came to the Markets of <hi>London;</hi> who relate, That they found ſeveral Perſons, as well as Horſes, lying Dead upon the Road, (they ſay) to the Number of 200. Amongſt theſe, it's Reported, was foond a <hi>Blue Garter;</hi> but of this, we will give a fuller Account in our next.</p>

               <p>THe Summ of 8000. Pounds being ſent to this Town, under a ſtrong Conduct, for the Paying of the Army, begot no ſmall Joy in the Hearts of the Soldiers; when, contrary to their Expectation, the next Morning it was diſtributed amongſt the Seamen and Officers of the Navy, then Riding in that Road, under the Command of the Right Honourable the Lord <hi>Dartmouth.</hi> This, as it had Animated the One, De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jected the other Party.

This loſs of ſo eminent a Swabber, gave Alarm to the whole Fleet, who gathering together in great Numbers, ſoon Reveng'd the Death of their Brother, by a mercileſs Slaughter of the <hi>Dear-Joys.</hi> The Lord <hi>Dover,</hi> Governor of the Town, having notice of this unhapy Tumult, apply'd himſelf with all Expedition and Zeal to prevent any fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther Miſchief. But all his Arguments cou'd not prevail, till the Right Honourable the Lord <hi>Dartmouth</hi> came a Shore, to Interpoſe between them.

He beg'd them, in the Name of the King, as they tender'd the ſafety of His Perſon, their Loyalty, or what elſe they counted dear, to ceaſe from any further Outrages on either ſide. But they ſtill per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiſted in their Violence, demanding the Perſons who were the firſt occaſion of this Tumult. He promis'd on the Word of a Peer, to ſee it done, which pacified for the preſent. In this conjuncture the Prince of <hi>Wales</hi> got ſafe to Town. But the Lord <hi>Dover</hi> not making good the Promiſe, the Town is ſince Blockt up, if not by this time Surrender'd.</p>
