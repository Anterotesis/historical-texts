            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            <p>THeſe Poetical Fragments, (except Three heretofore Printed) were ſo far from being intended for the Preſs, that they were not allowed the ſight of many Private Friends, nor thought worthy of it: Only had I had time and heart to have finiſhed
<pb facs="tcp:59457:4"/>
the firſt (which it ſelf according to the Matter and deſigned Method, would have made a Volume far bigger than all this, being intended as a thankful, Hiſtorical Commemoration of all the notable paſſages of my Life,) I ſhould have publiſhed it as the moſt ſelf-pleaſing part of my Writings. But as they were moſtly written in various Paſſions, ſo Paſſion hath now thruſt them out into the World. God having taken away the Dear Companion of the laſt Nineteen Years of my Life, as her ſorrows and ſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferings long ago gave Being to ſome of theſe Poems (for reaſons which the World is not concerned to know) ſo my grief for her Removal, and the Revived Senſe of former things, have prevailed with me to be paſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſionate in the open ſight of all.</p>
            <p>I confeſs that Paſſion is oft ſuch a hinderance of Judgment, that a man ſhould be very ſuſpicious of himſelf till it be laid: But I am aſſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red
<pb facs="tcp:59457:4"/>
that God made it not in vain; and that Reaſon is a ſleepy half-uſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſs thing, till ſome Paſſion excite it; and Learning to a man aſleep is no better for that time than Ignorance. And God uſually beginneth the a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wakening of Reaſon, and the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſion of Sinners, by the awaken<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of their uſeful Paſſions, their Fear, their Grief, Repentance, De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſire, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> I confeſs, when God awa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>keneth in me thoſe Paſſions which I account rational and holy, I am ſo far from condemning them, that I think I was half a Fool before, and have ſmall comfort in ſleepy Reaſon. Lay by all the paſſionate part of Love and Joy, and it will be hard to have any pleaſant thoughts of Heaven.</p>
            <p>In ſhort, I am an Adverſary to their Philoſophy, that vilifie Senſe, becauſe it is in Brutes, and am paſt doubt that the noble ſpirits of Sen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſitives are debaſed ignorantly, by
<pb facs="tcp:59457:5"/>
pretending Wits, that know not what they ſay or glory in. And humane Souls are not leſs ſenſitive for being rational, but are eminently ſenſitive: Yea, Reaſon hath in it more of eminent internal Senſation, than thoſe men think that debaſe Senſe. The Scripture, that ſaith of God, That he is <hi>Life</hi> and <hi>Light,</hi> ſaith al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſo, That he is <hi>Love,</hi> and <hi>Love</hi> is Complacence, and Complacence is Joy; and to ſay <hi>God is Infinite, Eſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſential Love</hi> and <hi>Joy,</hi> is a better no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, than with <hi>Carteſians</hi> and <hi>Coc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceians.</hi> to ſay that <hi>God</hi> and <hi>Angels,</hi> and <hi>Spirits,</hi> are but a Thought, or an <hi>Idea.</hi> What is Heaven to us if there be no Love and Joy?</p>
            <p>I will do my wiſe Friends, whoſe Counſel I have much followed, that Right as to acquit them from all the guilt of the Publication of theſe Fragments. Some of them ſay, that <hi>ſuch Work is below me;</hi> and thoſe that I think ſpeak wiſelier ſay, <hi>I
<pb facs="tcp:59457:5"/>
am below ſuch Work.</hi> Theſe I un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feignedly believe. I have long thought, that a <hi>Painter,</hi> a <hi>Muſician</hi> and a <hi>Poet,</hi> are contemptible, if they be not Excellent: And that I am not Excellent, I am ſatisfied: But I am more patient of contempt than many are. Common Painters ſerve for poor men's work: And a Fidler may ſerve at a Country-Wedding: Such cannot aſpire to the Attainments of the higher ſort: And the Vulgar are the greater number. Dr. <hi>Stillingfleet</hi> ſaith, <hi>I ſeldom follow my Friend's Advice:</hi> In this I juſtifie him: Though in other things my Adviſers contra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dict him.</p>
            <p>I know that natural temper mak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth Poetry ſavour to ſeveral Wiſe and Learned men, as differently as Meats do to various Appetites. I know ſuch Learned diſcreet men, that know not what a Tune is, nor can difference one from another.
<pb facs="tcp:59457:6"/>
I wonder at them, and oft doubt whether it be an <hi>Accident</hi> or an <hi>In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tegral</hi> of Humanity which they want. <hi>Annatus</hi> the Jeſuit in his An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwer to Dr. <hi>Twiſſe De Scientia Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dia</hi> commends his Poetry (for a Poem added in the end) in ſcorn, as if it were a diſgrace to a School Divine. I take one ſign of an Acu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men of Wit to make it likely that the man hath the ſame Wit for other work.</p>
            <p>For my ſelf, I confeſs that Har<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mony and Melody are the pleaſure and elevation of my Soul, and have made a Pſalm of Praiſe in the holy Aſſembly the chief delightful Exer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciſe of my Religion and my Life; and hath helped to bear down all the Objections which I have heard againſt Church-Muſick, and againſt the 149, 150 <hi>Pſalms.</hi> It was not the leaſt comfort that I had in the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſe of my late Dear Wife, that our firſt in the morning, and laſt in Bed
<pb facs="tcp:59457:6"/>
at night was a Pſalm of Praiſe (till the hearing of others interrupted it.) <gap reason="illegible: in gutter" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>et thoſe that ſavour not Melody, leave others to their different Ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>petites, and be content to be ſo far ſtrangers to their delights.</p>
            <p>Theſe Times have produced ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny Excellent Poets: Among whom for ſtrength of Wit, Dr. <hi>Abraham Cooley</hi> juſtly bears the Bell. I much value Mr. <hi>Woodford</hi>'s Paraphraſe on the Pſalms, though his Genius (or ſomewhat elſe) expound ſome Pſalms, ſo as the next Age will confute. A Woman's Poems, the Lady <hi>Katherine Philip</hi>'s are far above contetmp. But that is beſtto me which is moſt holy.</p>
            <p>I have known good men that were skilled in Muſick, and much delight<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed in it, and yet had a conceit that it was unlawful in a Pſalm, or holy Exerciſe: I ſo much differed from them, that I ſcarce cared for it any where elſe; and if it might not be

            <p>Sir <hi>Fulk Grevil,</hi> Lord <hi>Brook</hi> (a man of great note in his Age) hath a Poem lately Printed for Subjects Liberty, which I greatly wonder this Age would bear.

                  <l>Prepar'd my way, and call'd me to the place,</l>
                  <l>Where I muſt firſt proclaim his Saving Grace:</l>
                  <l>All things thou ſuitedſt fitly to my need,</l>
                  <l>Giving me freedom, ſeaſon, ground and ſeed:</l>
                  <l>Poor thirſty Souls, attend with greedy Ear,</l>
                  <l>Crowding in multitudes thy Word to hear:</l>
                  <l>Thy Mercy opening ſo wide a door,</l>
                  <l>Gave ſome firſt-fruits betimes, and hopes of more.</l>
               </lg>
               <lg>
                  <l>The various places where my Lot did fall,</l>
                  <l>Were all appointed to me by thy Call.</l>
                  <l>I never was to any of them brought,</l>
                  <l>By the Direction of my own forethought:</l>
                  <l>Much leſs was ever any by me ſought;</l>
                  <l>And leaſt of all, by price or bargain bought.</l>
                  <l>I nere found cauſe of one place to repent;</l>
                  <l>(Although my ſins in all I muſt lament.)</l>
                  <l>None were foreſeen; yet after ſeen to reaſon,</l>

But among all, none did ſo much abound,</l>
                  <l>With fruitful mercies, as that barren ground,</l>

                  <l>Mercies grew thicker there than Summer flowers:</l>
                  <l>They over-numbered my daies and hours:</l>
                  <l>There was my deareſt Flock, and ſpecial Charge.</l>
                  <l>Our hearts in mutual love thou didſt enlarge:</l>

                  <l>Who Lov'd and Hated, juſt as Satan bid them;</l>

            <l>Love is their Kingdom: it's a world of Love,</l>

            <l>Diſplay thy Love; ſhoot down thy vital Raies!</l>

            <l>MY <hi>firſt</hi> Birth-day brought forth a <hi>Man,</hi> in ſin:</l>
            <l>But one that could not work, nor go, nor ſpeak.</l>
            <l>My <hi>ſecond</hi> did a Life of Grace begin,</l>
            <l>But ſuch, alas, as yet's diſeas'd and weak.</l>
            <l>The <hi>third</hi> from fleſhly bonds will me releaſe,</l>
            <l>And bring me to the world of glorious Light:</l>

            <l>Why ſhould not Death then be a ſtraiter Door,</l>
