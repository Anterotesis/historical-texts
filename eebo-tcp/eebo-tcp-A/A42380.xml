            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

               <p>And Note, it was the Opinion of the<note place="margin">Nota.</note> Learned Sir <hi>Francis Bacon,</hi> That tho' the High-Conſtables Authority hath a more ample Circuit, he did not perceive that the Petty-Conſtable is ſubordinate to him, from any Commandment that proceeds from his own Authority: But it was uſed, That the Warrants and Precepts of the Juſtices be delivered to the High-Conſtables, who being few in number, might better attend the Ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtices; and then the High-Conſtables by virtue of ſuch Warrants (not their own Authority) make their Precepts over to the Petty-Conſtables. <hi>Bac. C. T.</hi> p. 22, &amp; 30. And this alſo ſeems to be only in ſome Caſes, as where they are ſummoned to attend the Juſtices to make their Preſentments, and the like.</p>
               <p>This ſeems to be the general Method,<note place="margin">Nota.</note> tho' in ſome large Pariſhes and particular Places, there are and may be ſeveral Officers called by the ſeveral names of <hi>Conſtable, Headburrough,</hi> and the like: And tho' theſe Inferior Officers be called by ſeveral names, yet their Offices in their ſeveral Precincts and Places are in effect one and the ſame the Name being only changed.</p>
               <p>However the Office of a Conſtable ſeem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth<note place="margin">Some Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtinction between theſe Offi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cers.</note> to be diſtinct, and of greater Authority than theirs; and ſome have held, That Headburroughs, Thirdburroughs, Borſhoul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders, Tithingmen, &amp;c. being appointed in a Town or Pariſh where is alſo a Conſtable, that they cannot principally meddle, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe

(in compariſon of them) the Conſta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bles are Head-Officers, and the others but as Aſſiſtants to the preſent Conſtable; tho' in the Conſtables abſence they are chiefly to attend the ſervice: And that there are many things which the Conſtable may do, wherein ſuch Headburroughs, Borſhoulders, &amp;c. cannot meddle.</p>
               <p>See <hi>Dalton</hi>'s <hi>Juſtice of Peace,</hi> ca. 1. fo. 34. <hi>Lamb.</hi> pag. 4. 6, 9. 51, 52, 53, 54, 55, &amp;c. See 1 <hi>Jac.</hi> ca. 7.</p>
               <p>And yet in Towns and places where there are no Conſtables, but only Headburroughs, Borſhoulders, Tithingmen, &amp;c. there their Power and Authority is declared to be equal to the Power of a Conſtable, and in all<note place="margin">Where their Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thority is all one and the ſame.</note> ſuch caſes and things their Office and Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thority are in a manner all one. And he that is ſworn the Tithingman, &amp;c. of any place, is in effect (with reſpect as aforeſaid) the Conſtable of the place: And that when any Staute doth appoint the Conſtable, or other Inferior Officers to puniſh Offenders, in ſuch caſe the Borſhoulder, Headburrough, Tithingman &amp;c. may do it, they being ſuppoſed to be Inferior Officers to the Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtables.</p>
               <p>By the Statute 14 <hi>Car. 2. cap.</hi> 12. it is<note place="margin">Nota.</note> Ordained, That upon the death or removal of any Conſtable out of the Pariſh, any two Juſtices may elect and ſwear a new one, to continue till the next Leet or Quarter-Seſſions; and then the Steward or Juſtices to approve of him, or appoint another: And if any ſuch Officer continue in his Office above a Year, the Juſtices of the

               <p>In ſome Caſes then the High Conſtable<note place="margin">Nota</note> may and muſt do more than the Petty-Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtable, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> And in ſome Caſes they have equal authority, and in other Caſes they are diſtinct; I ſhall therefore endeavour to ſhew, what all Conſtables either High, or Low, Burſholders, Headburroughs, Ty<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing-men, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> may and muſt do; what is their common or equal, and what their ſpecial or particular Duty and Authority.

            <p>The reſt is in general, to do and execute all other things belonging to the Office of a Conſtable, to the beſt of his power, know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge, and ability; and this again extends to his whole Office.</p>
            <p>I will firſt treat of theſe things which<note place="margin">Particulars of the Oath firſt treated of.</note> are particularized in his Oath, and next endeavour to ſhew all ſuch other things as belong to his Office.</p>

            <p>HAving ſpoken briefly in the <hi>IVth</hi> Chapter of the Conſtables Duty in executing the Juſtices Warrant, and how the Officer is bound at his peril, to take notice of the Authority and Juriſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diction of the Juſtices, I will here ſet down (as an <hi>Appendix</hi> to the former) ſome further Rules and Precedents touching the nature and effect of Warrants; which may be of good uſe to our ſeveral Officers, for whom this Treatiſe is intended.</p>

                  <hi>WHereas</hi> A. B. <hi>of your Town, the New Conſtable thereof, is (by reaſon of his Age and Impotency) very unable and inſufficient to execute the ſaid Place; Theſe are to require you, whoſe Names are hare<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>under written, to be before me at my Houſe at</hi> C. <hi>to Morrow</hi> [or ſuch other time as is convenient] <hi>by Ten of the Clock in the Morning, that I may make Choice of one of you to be Sworn, to undertake the ſaid Office.

               </p>
            </q>
            <p>Note, this Swearing of Conſtables, &amp;c. by the Juſtices, is only in caſe of neceſſity, and when 'tis long to the Quarter-Seſſions, or Leet.</p>
            <p>And though it may not be neceſſary for<note place="margin">Concerning Hand and Seal to a Warrant.</note> the Juſtices to put their Seals to theſe Sum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mons, which are directed to the Parties themſelves, not obliging them to act upon any other perſon or thing; Yet Note, that there is a neceſſity that the Juſtice of Peace do ſubſcribe his Name to his Warrant, commanding an Officer to act upon ſome other perſon or thing. Tho' to put his Seal in every caſe is not required; for in a Warrant of the Peace, or Good Behaviour it is thought not to be needful, nor where
<pb n="147" facs="tcp:108989:75"/>
an Act of Parliament ſaith, That the Juſtice by Warrant (or by Warrant under his hand) may do ſuch a thing: But where the Law ſays, that he may or ſhall do it by Warrant under his Hand and Seal, there it muſt be under his Hand and Seal, or it is not good. And it is now uſual and moſt ſafe for a Juſtice to put his Seal to every Warrant after this manner, <q>And hereof fail you not at your perils.</q>
            </p>
            <q>
               <p>
                  <hi>Given under our Hands and Seals</hi> [or<note place="margin">Day and Year of making the Warrant.</note> 
                  <hi>my Hand and Seal,</hi> as the caſe may be] <hi>this firſt Day of</hi> January, <hi>in the Third Year of the Reign of King</hi> William <hi>and Queen</hi> Mary, Annoque Dom. 1692.</p>
            </q>
            <p>
               <hi>Or thus;</hi>
            </p>
            <q>
               <p>
                  <hi>Sealed with our Seals</hi> [or <hi>Sealed with my Seal] and Dated the firſt Day of</hi> Janu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ary, <hi>in the Third year, &amp;c.</hi> Annoque Dom. 1692.</p>
            </q>
            <p>Note, That if the Warrant expreſs the place where it was made; as [<hi>Dated at</hi> D. <hi>and given under my Hand, &amp;c.</hi>] though it was not really Dated there; yet the War<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rant is good, and ſhall be taken to be dated where the Warrant doth ſay it was dated.</p>
            <p>The Rules that have been obſerved to the compleating a Juſtices Warrant, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by he Commands an Inferior Officer to do ſomething belonging to his Office, are as follow:</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="148" facs="tcp:108989:76"/>Firſt, That the Warrant muſt be plain<note place="margin">Rules.</note> and clear, and not ambiguous and doubtful, ſo that the Officer need not be forced to enquire what the Juſtice means.</p>
            <p>Secondly, That it be compleatly fill'd up, and not left with Blanks in it.</p>
            <p>Thirdly, The uſual form of the Warrant begins thus:</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Theſe are in Their Majeſties Names to require you, &amp;c.</hi> tho' it is ſufficient to ſay, <hi>Theſe are to require you;</hi> howbeit the War<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rant doth carry the more Majeſty in it, when thoſe Words are uſed in it.</p>
            <p>Fourthly, The Title of Direction, may either be above the Warrant thus;</p>
            <p>
               <hi>To the Conſtable of</hi> Dale.</p>
            <p>Or in the body of the Warrant thus;</p>
            <p>
               <hi>A. B. <abbr>Eſq</abbr> &amp;c. To the Conſtable of D. Whereas, &amp;c.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Fifthly, The Warrant may be directed, to any Officer, as the Sheriff, his Bayliffs, Conſtables, Tithingmen &amp;c.</p>
            <p>Or, <hi>To the Sheriff, and to all Bailiffs High-Conſtables of Hundreds, and Conſta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bles and Tithingmen of Towns and Pariſhes within the County of A. and every of them joyntly and ſeverally.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Or, it may be directed to theſe Officers and to others that are no Officers together.</p>
            <p>Or, to them that are no Officers alone thus;</p>
            <p>
               <hi>To A. B. and C. D. both of E. in the County of G. and to either of them.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>But this muſt be underſtood of Warrants of the Peace, Good Behaviour, and ſuch like
<pb n="149" facs="tcp:108989:76"/>
Warrants, wherein the Juſtice of the Peace is left at liberty, to direct his Warrant to whom he will. For if the Law doth direct him to whom to ſend his Warrant, (as di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vers Acts of Parliament do, ſome of them appointing him to direct his Warrant to the Conſtables, ſome to the Conſtables and Churchwardens, ſome to the Churchwardens, ſome to the Conſtables or Churchwardens, ſome to the Churchwardens and Overſeers of the Poor); in this caſe the direction of the Statute muſt be punctually purſued; for it is dangerous to vary from it ever ſo little.</p>
            <p>But where the Juſtice is left at liberty, to direct it to whom he pleaſes, it hath been thought the beſt way to direct it to a common and known Officer; which is the High-Conſtable of the Hundred, or Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtable of the Town, &amp;c.</p>
            <p>Sixthly, The Warrant for an Arreſt may be, to require the Officer to bring the Of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fender before the Juſtice that makes the Warrant, or before him or ſome other Ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtice of the County; and either way is good.</p>
            <p>Seventhly, In every Warrant of the Peace, or Good Behaviour, where Sureties are to be found, the Warrant ought to contain the ſpecial Cauſe or Matter, that the Party arreſted may provide Sureties: But if it be for ſome great Crime, the cauſe may be concealed.</p>
            <p>Eighthly, In every Warrant to command an Officer to carry a man to Gaol, 'tis
<pb n="150" facs="tcp:108989:77"/>
uſual to inſert a Clauſe to the Gaoler at the end of the Warrant to this purpoſe: <hi>That you him convey to the Common Gaol of this County, and him deliver to the Gaeler or his Deputy there, who are hereby required him to receive and detain, until he ſhall from thence be delivered by due courſe of Law.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>And note that 'tis uſual, and a good Cloſe of every Warrant ſent to an Officer, to require him to give an account how he hath executed it, in this manner: <hi>And that you be then there with this Precept, to give us an account of your Execution of it.</hi> Or thus; <hi>That you give me an account within 14 Days next following, of your Execution of my Warrant.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Ninthly, Note, there is very little diffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rence between a Warrant of Commitment and a Mittimus; for both are to do one thing, and they differ a little only in the Form.</p>
            <p>Tenthly, Where a Statute doth give Power to a Juſtice of Peace, to compel men to do any thing, he may ſend his Warrant, to require them to come before him; and if they refuſe, he may proceed at Law.</p>
            <p>Eleventhly, The Juſtices of the Peace may ſend their Warrants for any thing that doth relate to a ſpecial Seſſions, either to compel Appearance or Attendance there, or Execution of any thing there done, under their own Hands, or by the Clerk of the Peace, as the buſineſs of the Quarter-Seſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons is done.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="151" facs="tcp:108989:77"/>Twelfthly, Obſerve, That where a Statute is penned thus, that the Conſtables or Churchwardens (by a Warrant from a Juſtice of Peace) ſhall be enabled to do a thing; in this caſe the Juſtice may juſtifie the ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king of ſuch Warrant.</p>
            <div type="part">
               <head>Some Precedents of Warrants.</head>
               <p>1. WArrants and Precedents relating to the exerciſe of the Office of a Juſtice of Peace out of the General Seſſions, are of ſeveral ſorts, <hi>viz.</hi> They concern either <hi>Treaſons, Felonies, Miſpriſions, Praemunires, Forcible Entries, Forcible Detainers, Riots, Routs,</hi> and <hi>Unlawful Aſſemblies, Security of the Peace</hi> and <hi>Good Behaviour,</hi> or other Miſdemeanors or Offences of ſeveral ſorts.</p>
               <p>2. As concerning <hi>Treaſons</hi> and <hi>Felonies upon Information,</hi> made of any Treaſon or Felony committed, any one Juſtice of the Peace may direct his Warrant to the She<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riff, or to the High-Conſtables or Petty-Conſtables, or to all or any of them to make ſearch for the Traytors or Felons, and alſo for ſtoln Goods.</p>
