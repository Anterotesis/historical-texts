            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

                  <seg rend="decorInit">C</seg>Hrist in this saying, touch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
the sloath and sluggish<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness
of his, and did not
allow the fraud and sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tilty
of other: neither
was glad that it was indeed as he said,
<pb n="2" facs="tcp:33738:17"/>
but complained rather that it should be
so; as many men speak many things,
not that they ought to be so, but that
they are wont to be so. Nay this griev<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
Christ, that the children of this
world should be of more policy then
the children of light; which thing was
true in Christs time, and now in our
time it is most true. Who is so blind
but he seeth this cleerly, except per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chance
there be any that cannot di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>scern
the children of the world, from
the children of light? The children
of the world conceive and bring forth
more prudently, and things conceived
and brought forth, they nourish and
conserve with much more policy, then
do the children of light: Which thing
is as sorrowfull to be said, as it seems
absurd to be heard. When ye hear the
children of the world, you understand
the world as a father; for the world is
father to many children, not by the
first creation, but by imitation and love.
He is not only a father, but also the
son of another father. If you knew
once his father, by and by ye shall know
his children; for he that hath the de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vil
<pb n="3" facs="tcp:33738:17"/>
to his father, must needs have de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>villish
children. The devil is not only
taken for father, but also for Prince of
the world, that is, of worldly folk. It is
either all one thing, or else not much
different, to say, children of the world,
and children of the devil, according to
that that Christ said to the Jews, <hi>Ye
are of your father the devil;</hi> whereas
undoubtedly he spake to the children
of this world.—</p>
               <p>Then this devil being such a one as
can never be unlike himself; Loe, of
Envy, his welbeloved <hi>Lemmon</hi> he be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gat
the world, and after left it with
Discord at Nurse: Which world after
it came to mans state, had of many
Concubines, many sons, he was so
secund a father, and had gotten so ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny
children of Lady <hi>Pride,</hi> Dame
<hi>Gluttony,</hi> Mistress <hi>Avarice,</hi> Lady <hi>Le<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chery,</hi>
and of Dame <hi>Subtilty,</hi> that now
hard and scant ye may find any corner,
any kind of life, where many of his
children be not: In Court, in Cowl's,
in Cloisters, in Rochets, be they never
so white, yea where shall ye not find
them? Howbeit, they that be secular
<pb n="4" facs="tcp:33738:18"/>
and lay men, are not by and by chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren
of the world; not the children of
light, that are called spiritual, are
of the Clergy. No, no, as ye may find
among the Laity many children of
light, so among the Clergy (how much
soever we arrogate these holy titles
unto us, and think them only attribu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted
to us;<note place="margin">Mat. 5. 1 Pet. 2.</note> 
                  <hi>Vos estis lux mundi, peculium
Christi,</hi> &amp;c. ye are the light of the
world, the chosen people of Christ, a
Kingly Priesthood; an holy Nation,
and such other) ye shall find many chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren
of the world, because in all places
the world getteth many children.—</p>
               <p>These be our holy, holy men, that
say they are dead to the world, when no
men be more lively in worldly things,
then some of them be. But let them
be in profession and name farthest from
the world, most alienate from it, yea
so far, that they may seem to have no
occupying, no kindred, no affinity, no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing
to do with it; yet in their life
and deeds they shew themselves no
bastards, but right begotten children
of the world, as those which the world
long since had by his dear wife Dame
<pb n="5" facs="tcp:33738:18"/>
                  <hi>Hypocrisie;</hi> and since hath brought them
up, and multiplied to more than a good
many, encreasing them too much, albe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>it
they swear by all He-Saints and She-Saints
too, that they know not their
Father nor Mother, neither the <hi>world,</hi>
nor <hi>hypocrisie;</hi> as indeed they can sem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble
and dissemble all things, which
thing they might learn wonderful well
of their Parents. I speak not of all re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligious
men, but those that the world
hath fast knit at his Girdle, even in the
midst of their Religion.—</p>
               <p>And I marvel, if there be not a great
sort of Bishops and Prelates, that are
Brethren German unto these; and as a
great sort, so even as right-born, and
worlds Children, by as good Title as
they? But because I cannot speak of
all, when I say Prelates; I understand
Bishops, Abbots, Priors, Archdea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cons,
Deans and other of such sort, that
are now called to this Convocation, as
I see to intreat here of nothing, but of
such matters as both appertain to the
Glory of Christ, and to the wealth of
the people of <hi>England;</hi> which thing I
pray God they do as earnestly as they
<pb n="6" facs="tcp:33738:19"/>
ought. But it is to be feared, lest as
Light hath many of her Children here,
so the world hath sent some of his
whelps hither. I know there can be no
agreement betwixt these too, as long as
they have minds so unlike, and so con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary
Affections, and Judgments so ut<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terly
divers in all points: But if the
children of this world be either moe in
number, or more prudent than the
children of Light, what then availeth
us to have this Convocation? Had it
not been better, we had not been cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led
together at all? For as the children
of the world be evil, so they breed and
bring forth things evil, and yet there
be moe of them in all places, or at
least.—</p>
               <p>And as now I much pass not how you
were ingendred, or by what means ye
were promoted to those dignities that
ye now occupy, so it be honest, good
and profitable, that ye in this your con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sultation
shall do &amp; ingender. The end
of your Convocation shall shew what
ye have done; the fruit that shall come
of your Consultation, shall shew what
generation ye be of. For what have ye
<pb n="7" facs="tcp:33738:19"/>
done hitherto, I pray you, these seven
years and moe? What have ye ingen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dred?
What have ye brought forth?
What fruit is come of your long and
great Assembly? What one thing that
the people of <hi>England</hi> hath been the
better of an hair? or your selves either
accepted before God, or better dischar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ged
toward the people committed un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to
your cure? For that the people is
better learned and taught now, than
they were in time past, to whether of
these, ought we to attribute it, to your
Industry, or to the Providence of God,
and the foreseeing of the Kings Grace?
Ought we to thank you, or the Kings
Highness? Whether stirred other first,<note place="margin">Note, Doth not the King in his De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>claration do so.</note>
you the King, that ye might preach,
or He you by his Letters, that ye should
preach ofter? Is it unknown, think
you, how both ye and your Curates
were in a manner by violence enforced
to let Books be made by prophane and
Lay Persons, and sold abroad, and read
for the Instruction of the People? I am
bold with you, but I speak <hi>Latine,</hi> and
not <hi>English;</hi> to the Clergy, not to the
Laity. I speak to you being present,
<pb n="8" facs="tcp:33738:20"/>
and not behind you backs. God is my
witness, I speak whatsoever is spoken,
of the good will that I bear you: God
is my witness, which knoweth my heart,
and compelleth me to say that I say.</p>
               <p>Now I pray you, in Gods name,
what did you, so great Fathers, so many,
so long a season, so oft assembled toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther?
What went you about? What
would you have brought to pass; two
things taken away? The one, That
ye (which I heard) burned a dead man:
The other, that ye (which I felt) went
about to burn one being alive: Him,
because he did, I cannot tell how, in
his Testament withstand your profit;
in other Points, as I have heard, a ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry
good man, reported to be of honest
life, while he lived, full of good
works, good both to the Clergy &amp; also to
the Laity. This other, which truly never
hurt any of you, ye would have raked
in the coals, because he would not sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>scribe
to certain Articles, that took a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>way
the Supremacy of the King: Take
away these two noble Acts, and there
is nothing else left, that ye went about,
that I know, saving that I now remem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber,
<pb n="9" facs="tcp:33738:20"/>
that somwhat ye attempted against
<hi>Erasmus,</hi> albeit nothing as yet is come
to light. Ye have oft sit in Consultati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on,
but what have ye done? Ye have
had many things in deliberation, but
what one is put forth, whereby either
Christ is more glorified, or else Christs
people made more holy? I appeal to
your own Conscience.</p>
               <p>How chanced this? How came this
thus? Because there were no children
of Light, no children of God among
you, which setting the world at naught,
would study to illustrate the Glory of
God, and thereby shew themselves
Children of Light? I think not so:
certainly, I think not so. God forbid,
that all you which were gathered toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
under the pretence of Light, should
be children of the world. Then why
hapned this? why I pray you? Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chance
either because the children of
the world were more in number, in this
your Congregation, as it oft hapneth,
or at the least of more policy than the
Children of Light in their Generation.
VVhereby it might very soon be
brought to pass, that those were much
<pb n="10" facs="tcp:33738:21"/>
more stronger, in gendring the evil,
than these, in producing the good:
The children of light have Policy, but
it is like the policy of the Serpent, and
is joyned with dovish simplicity; they
ingender nothing but simply, faithfully,
and plainly, even so doing all that they
do. But the children of this world
have worldly policy, foxly craft, lion-like
cruelty, power to do hurt, more
than either <hi>Aspis</hi> or <hi>Basiliscus,</hi> ingen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dring
and doing all things fraudulently,
deceitfully, guilfully.—
The children of this world be like craf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty
Hunters, they be mis-named chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren
of light, forasmuch as they so hate
light, and so study to do the works of
darkness. If they were the children of
light, they would not love darkness. It
is no marvel, that they go about to keep
others in darkness, seeing they be in
darkness, from top to toe overwhelm<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
with darkness, darker than the dark<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness
of Hell. VVherefore it is well
done, in all Orders of men, but especi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally
in the Order of Prelares, to put a
difference between the children of
Light, and children of the world, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause
<pb n="11" facs="tcp:33738:21"/>
great deceit ariseth in taking the
one for the other. Great Imposture
cometh, when they, that the common
people take for the Light, go about to
take the Sun and Light out of the world.
But these be easily known, both by the
diversity of minds, and also their Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mors;
for whereas the children of light
are thus minded, that they seek—</p>
               <p>These worldlings set little by such
works as God hath prepared for our sal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vation,<note place="margin">Note.</note>
but they extol Traditions and
works of their own invention: The
Children of Light contrary.<note place="margin">Note.</note> The world<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lings,
if they spy Profit, Gains or Lu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cre
in any thing, be it never such a tri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fle,
be it never so pernicious, they
preach it to the people (if they preach
at any time) and these things they de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fend
with tooth and nail; they can
scarce disallow the abuses of these, al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>beit
they be intollerable, least in disal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowing
the abuse, they lose part of their
profit. The Children of light contra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry,
put all things in their degree, best
highest, the worst lowest. They extol
things necessary, Christian, and com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manded
of God. They pull down will-works
<pb n="12" facs="tcp:33738:22"/>
feigned by men, and put them
in their place. The abuse of all things
they earnestly rebuke.—</p>
               <p>Now to make hast,<note place="margin">O Glori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous zeal!</note> and to come som<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>what
nigher to the end, go ye to (good
Brethren and Fathers) for the love of
God, go ye to, and seeing we are as<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sembled,
let us do something whereby
we may be known to be the children of
light. Let us do somwhat, lest we
which hitherto have been judged chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren
of the world, seem even still to be
so. All men call us Prelates; then
seeing we be in council,<note place="margin">Excellent Counsel fit to be taken by this Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vocation.</note> let us so order
our selves, that as we be Prelates in ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour
and dignity, so we may be Prelates
in holiness, benevolence, diligence and
sincerity. All men know, that we be
here gathered, and with most fervent
desire they can, hale, breath and gape
for the fruit of our Convocation. As
our Acts shall be, so they shall name
us, so that it now lieth in us, whether
we will be called Children of the world
or children of the light. Wherefore
lift up your heads (Brethren) and look
about with your eyes, spy what things
are to be reformed in the Church of
<hi>England.</hi>—</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="13" facs="tcp:33738:22"/>
How think you by the Ceremonies,<note place="margin">Note.</note>
that are in <hi>England,</hi> oftentimes with
no little offence of weak consciences
continued, more often with superstition
so defiled, and so depraved, that you
may doubt whether it were better for
them to tarry still, or utterly to take
them away?<note place="margin">Note.</note> have not our fore-Fathers
complained of the Ceremonies, of the
superstitions, and estimation of them?
do ye see nothing in our Holy-dayes?
of the which very few were made at the
first, and they to set forth goodness,
virtue, and honesty. But sithence,
there is neither mean or measure in
making new Holy-dayes:<note place="margin">Was it not so of late.</note> as who say
this one thing in serving of God, to
make this Law that no man may work.
But what do the people on these Holy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dayes,
do they give themselves to god<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liness,
or else ungodliness? See you no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing
Brethren? if you see not, God
seeth: God seeth all the whole Holy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dayes
to be spent miserably in drun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kenness,
in glossing, in strife, in envie,
dansing, dicing, idleness, and gluttony.
Thus men serve the Devil, for God is
not thus served, albeit ye say ye serve
<pb n="14" facs="tcp:33738:23"/>
God; no the Devil hath more service
done unto him in one Holy-day then
on many working dayes; let all these
abuses be counted as nothing, who is he
that is not sorry to see in so many Holy-dayes
rich and wealthy Persons to flow
in delicates, and men that live by their
travel, poor men to lack necessary meat
and drink for their Wives and Chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren,
and that they cannot labour upon
the Holy-dayes, except they will be ci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted,
and brought before our Officials.
Were it not the office of good Prelates,<note place="margin">This winking caused God to open his eyes, and so sorely to visit us as of late.</note>
to consult upon these matters and to
seek some remedy for them? Ye shall
see (my Brethren,) ye shall see once
what will come of this our winking.</p>
               <p>What think ye of these images.—</p>
               <p>If there be nothing to be amended
abroad, concerning the whole, let every
one of us make one better. If there
be nothing at home or abroad to be
amended and redressed; My Lords, be
ye of good cheer, be merry: and at the
least because we have nothing else to
do, let us reason the matter how we
may be richer; let us fall to some plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sant
communication; after let us go
<pb n="15" facs="tcp:33738:23"/>
Home, even as good as we came hither,
that is right begotten Children of the
World, utterly Worldlings. And
while we live here let us all make boon
cheer. For after this life there is small
pleasure, little mirth for us to hope for,
if now there be nothing to be changed
in our factions.<note place="margin">1. <hi>Pet.</hi> 4</note> Let us say, not as St.
<hi>Peter</hi> did: Our end approacheth nigh,
this is an heavy hearing, but let us say
as the evil Servant said: It will be long
ere my Master come. This is pleasant;
let us beat our fellow Servants: let us
eat and drink with Drunkards. Surely
as oft as we do not take away the abuse
of things, so oft we beat our fellows.
As oft as we give not the people their
true food, so oft we beat our fellow.
As oft as we let them dye in supersti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion,
so oft we beat them. To be short,
as oft as we blind, lead them blind, so
oft we beat, and grievously beat our
fellows. When we welter in pleasures
and idleness, then we eat and drink
with Drunkards.</p>
               <p>But God will come, God will come, he
will not tarry long away. He will come
upon such a day as we nothing look for
<pb n="16" facs="tcp:33738:24"/>
him; and at such an hour as we know
not. He will come and cut us in
pieces. He will reward us as he doth
the Hypocrites. He will set us where
wailing shall be, my Brethren, where
gnashing of Teeth shall be, my Bre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thren.
And let here be the end of our
Tragedy, if ye will. These be the de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>licate
dishes, prepared for the world's
well-beloved Children. These be the
wafers and junckets provided for
worldly Prelates, wailing and gnashing
of Teeth: Can there be any mirth,
where these two courses last all the
Feast? Here we laugh, there we shall
weep; our Teeth make merry here,
ever dashing in delicates, there we
shall be torne with Teeth, and do no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing
but gnash and grinde our owne:
To what end have we excelled others
in policy: what have we brought forth
at last? Ye see Brethren what sorrow,
what punishment is provided for you,
if you be worldling? if ye will not
thus be vexed, be ye not the Children
of the world: if ye will not be the
Children of the world, be not stricken
with the love of worldly things, leane
<pb n="17" facs="tcp:33738:24"/>
not upon them, if ye will not dye eter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nally,
live not worldly. Come, go to;
leave the love of your profit, study for
the glory and profit of Christ, seek in
your Consultations,<note place="margin">Let the Bishops learn their duty from this blessed Saint.</note> such things as per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain
to Christ, and bring forth some<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing
at last that may please Christ.
Feed ye tenderly with all diligence the
Flock of Christ. Preach truly the word
of God, love the Light, walk in the
Light: and so be ye the Children of
Light while ye are in this world; that
ye may shine in the world that is to

               <head>Part of a Sermon preached by Mr.
Hugh Latimer at Paul's Church
in London, the Title of which
Sermon is The Plough.</head>
               <p>—I Told you in my first Sermon
(honourable Audience) that I
purposed to declare unto you two
<pb n="18" facs="tcp:33738:25"/>
Things. The one, what seed should
be sowen in Gods Field, in Gods
Plough-Land.</p>
               <p>And the other who should be the
Sowers. That is to say, what Doctrine
is to be taught in Christ's Church and
Congregation, and what men should
be the Teachers and Preachers of it.
The first part I have told you in three
Sermons past, in which I have essayed
to set forth my Plough, to prove what I
could do. And now I shall tell you
who be the Plowers; for Gods VVord
is a Seed to be sowen in Gods Field,
that is, the faithful Congregation, and
the Preacher is the Sower. As it is in
the Gospel,<note place="margin">Math. 13. 3.</note> 
                  <hi>Exivit qui seminat semi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nare
semen suum.</hi> He that soweth, the
Husbandman, the Ploughman went
forth to sow his Seed, so that a Preacher
is resembled to a Plowman, as it is in
another place; no man that putteth
his hand to the Plough and looketh
back, is apt for the Kingdom of God.
That is to say, let no Preacher be neg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligent
in doing his office. Albeit this
is one of the places that hath been
racked, as I told you of racking Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures.
<pb n="19" facs="tcp:33738:25"/>
And I have been one of them
myself, that have racked it, I cry God
mercy for it, and have been one of them
that have believed and have expounded
it against religious persons that would
forsake their Order which they had pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fessed,
and would go out of their Cloy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ster:
Whereas indeed it toucheth not
<hi>Monkery,</hi> nor maketh any thing at all
for any such matter. But it is directly
spoken of diligent preaching of the
Word of God: For preaching of the
Gospel is one of Gods Plough-works;
and the Preacher is one of Gods plough<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men:
Ye may not be offended with
my similitude, in that I compare prea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ching
to the labour and work of plow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing,
and the Preacher to a plow-man.
Ye may not be offended with this my
similitude; for I have been slandered
of some persons for such things. It hath
been said of me, Oh <hi>Latimer!</hi> nay, as
for him, I will never believe him while
I live, not trust him, for he likened our
ever blessed <hi>Lady</hi> to a <hi>Saffron. Bag;</hi> where
indeed I never used that similitude.—</p>
               <p>But in case I had used this similitude,
it had not been to be reproved, but
<pb n="20" facs="tcp:33738:26"/>
might have been without reproach: For
I might have said thus; as the Saffron-Bag
that hath been full of Saffron, or
hath had Saffron in it, doth ever after
savour and smell of the sweet Saffron
that it contained: So our Blessed La<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy,
which conceived and bare Christ
in her womb, did ever after resemble
the manners and vertues of that preci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous
Babe which she bare. And what had
our Blessed Lady been the worse for
this?—</p>
               <p>Ye may not then I say, be offended
with my similitude, because I liken
Preaching to a Plow-mans labour, and
a Prelate to a Plow-man.</p>
               <p>But you will now ask me, whom I
call a Prelate? A Prelate is that man,
whosoever he be, that hath a Flock to
be taught of him, whosoever hath any
spiritual Charge in the faithful Congre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gation,
and whosoever he be that hath
Cure of souls.</p>
               <p>And well may the Preacher and
Plow-man be likened together, First,
For their Labour in all seasons of the
Year; for there is no time in the year,
in which the Plow-man hath not some
<pb n="21" facs="tcp:33738:26"/>
special work to do; as in my Country,
in <hi>Leicestershire,</hi> the Plow-man hath a
time to set forth his Plow, and other
times for other necessary works to be
done.</p>
               <p>And then also they may be likened
together, for the diversity of works,
and variety of Offices that they have
to do.</p>
               <p>For as the Plow-man first setteth
forth his Plow, and then tilleth his
Land, and breaketh it in Furrows,
and somtime ridgeth it up again; and
at another time harroweth it, and clot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teth
it, and somtime dangeth and hedg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth
it, diggeth it and weedeth it, pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>geth
it, and maketh it clean: So the
Prelate, the Preacher, hath many, di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vers
Offices to do.</p>
               <p>He hath a busie work to bring Pari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>shioners
to a right Faith, as <hi>Paul</hi> cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leth
it; and not a swerving Faith, but
to a Faith that embraceth Christ, and
trusteth to his Merits, a lively Faith, a
justifying Faith, a Faith that maketh a
man righteous without respect of works
as ye have it very well declared in the
Homily.<note place="margin">Prelates have a busie work to do.</note> He hath then a busie work, I
<pb n="22" facs="tcp:33738:27"/>
say, to bring his Flock to a right Faith,
and then to confirm them in the same
Faith; now casting them down with
the Law and threatnings of God for sin;
now ridging them up again with the
Gospel, and the Promises of Gods Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vour;
now weeding them, by telling
them their Faults, and making them
forsake sin; now clotting them by
breaking their stony hearts, and by ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king
them supple-hearted, and making
them to have hearts of flesh, that is,
soft hearts, and apt for Doctrine to en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
in; now teaching to know God
rightly, and to know their duty to God
and to their Neighbours; now exhort<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
them, when they know their duty,
that they do it, and be diligent in it;
so that they have a continual work to
do. Great is their Business, and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
great should be their Hire. They
have great Labours, and therefore they
ought to have good Livings, that they
may commodiously feed their Flock:
For the Preaching of the Word of God
unto the People,<note place="margin">Straw<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>berry Preach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers once or twice a year.</note> is called Meat: Scri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pture
calleth it Meat, not Strawberries,
that come but once a year, and tarry
<pb n="23" facs="tcp:33738:27"/>
not long, but are soon gone; but it is
Meat, it is no Dainties. The people must
have meat that must be familiar and
continual, and daily given unto them
to feed upon. Many make a Strawber<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rie
of it, ministring it but once a year;
but such do not the Office of good Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lates:
For Christ saith, <hi>Quis (putas)
est Servus prudeus &amp; fidelis? Qui dat
cibum in tempore.</hi> Who, think you, is a
wise man, a faithful servant? He that
giveth meat in due time: So that he
must at all times convenient preach di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligently:
Therefore saith he, Who,
trow you, is a Faithful Servant? He
speaketh it, as though it were a rare
thing to find such a one; and as though
he should say, there be but a few of
them to find in the world: And how
few of them there be throughout this
Realm, that give meat to their Flocks,
as they should do, the Visitors can best
tell: Too few, too few, the more is
the pity, and never so few as now.</p>
               <p>By this it appeareth, that a Prelate,
or any that hath cure of souls, must di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligently
and substantially work and la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bour:
Therefore saith <hi>Paul</hi> to <hi>Timo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thy,
<pb n="24" facs="tcp:33738:28"/>
Qui Episcopatum de siderat, hic bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>num

                  <note place="margin">1 Tim. 3.1</note> He that desireth to
have the Office of a Bishop or Prelate,
that man desireth a good work: Then
if it be a good work, it is work; ye can
make but a work of it. It is Gods work,
Gods Plow, and that Plow God would
have still going: Such then as loyter,
and live idly, are not good Prelates or
Ministers. And of such as do not preach
and teach, God saith by his Prophet
<hi>Jeremy, maledictus qui facit opus Dei
fraudulenter,</hi> guilfully or deceitfully;
some Books have <hi>negligenter,</hi> negligent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly

how many such Prelates (Lord for thy

what shall we in this case do? Shall
we company with them? O Lord, for
thy mercy shall we not company with
them? O Lord, whither shall we flee

                  <hi>pauci vero E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lecti,</hi>

Here I have an occasion by the way,
somewhat to say unto you; yea, for
the place that I alleadged unto you be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
out of <hi>Jeremy.</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Ier. c. 48.</note> And it was spoken
of a spiritual work of God, a work that
was commanded to be done, and it was
of shedding-blood, and destroying the
Cities of <hi>Moab.</hi> For (saith he) cursed
be he that keepeth back his Sword from
shedding of blood. As <hi>Saul</hi> when he
kept back his Sword from shedding of
blood (at what time he was sent against
<hi>Amalek</hi>) was refused of God, for be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
disobedient to Gods Command<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments,
in that he spared <hi>Agag</hi> the
King: so that, that place of the Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phet
was spoken of them that went to
the destruction of the Cities of <hi>Moab,</hi>
among the which there was one called
<hi>Nebo,</hi> which was much reproved for
Idolatry, Superstition, Pride, avarice
Cruelty, Tyranny, and for hardness
of Heart, and for these sins was plagued
of God and destroyed.</p>
               <p>Now what shall I say of these rich
Citizens of <hi>London?</hi> what shall we say
<pb n="26" facs="tcp:33738:29"/>
of them? shall I call them proud men
of <hi>London,</hi> malicious men of <hi>London,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">
                     <hi>O London</hi> see thy self in this glass.</note>
merciless men of <hi>London?</hi> No, no, I
may not say so, they will be offended
with me then; yet must I speak, for is
there not reigning in <hi>London,</hi> as much

                  </note> as was in <hi>Nebo?</hi> Yes I
think, and much more too. Therefore
I say repent O <hi>London,</hi> repent, repent.
Thou hearest thy faults told thee, a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mend
them, amend them. I think if
<hi>Nebo</hi> had the preaching that thou hast,
they would have converted.</p>
               <p>And you Rulers and Officers, be
wise and circumspect, look to your
charge, and see you do your duties, and
rather be glad to amend your ill living,
then to be angry when you are warned
and told of your fault; what a doe
there was made in <hi>London</hi> at a certain
man, because he said (and indeed at
that time on a just occasion) Burgesses
(quoth he) nay Butter-flies. Lord! what
a doe there was for that word. And
yet would God they were no worse
then Butterflies. Butterflies do but
<pb n="27" facs="tcp:33738:29"/>
their nature, the Butterflie is not cove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tous,
is not greedy of other mens
goods, is not full of envy and hatred,
is not malicious, is not cruel, is not
merciless.<note place="margin">Note.</note> The Butterflie glorieth not
in her own deeds, nor preferreth the
traditions of men before Gods Word,
it committeth not Idolatry, nor wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>shippeth
false Gods; but <hi>London</hi> can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not
abide to be rebuked, such is the
nature of men, if they be pricked they
will kick, if they be rubbed on the
gall, they will winch: but yet they
will not amend their faults, they will
not be ill spoken of. But how shall I
speak well of them? if you could be
content to follow the Word of God,<note place="margin">Look to it Citi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zens.</note>
and favour good Preachers, if you
could bear to be told of your faults, if
ye could amend them when ye hear of
them, if ye would be glad to reform
what is amiss: If I might see any such
inclination in you, that you would
leave to be merciless, and begin to be
charitable, I would then hope well of
you, I would then speak well of you.
But <hi>London</hi> was never so ill as it is now.
In times past, men were full of pity
<pb n="28" facs="tcp:33738:30"/>
and compassion; but now there is no
pitty,<note place="margin">Is this amended at this day.</note> for in <hi>London</hi> their Brother shall
die in the streets for cold, he shall lie
sick at the door between stock and
stock, I cannot tell what to call it, and
perish there for hunger, was there any
more unmercifulness in <hi>Nebo?</hi> I
think not.</p>
               <p>In times past,<note place="margin">Iniqui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty aboun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deth and love waxeth cold.</note> when any rich men
died in <hi>London,</hi> they were wont to
help the poor Scholers of the Univer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sities
with exhibition. When any
man died, they would bequeath great
sums of money toward the relief of the
poor. When I was a Scholer in <hi>Cam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bridge</hi>
my self, I heard very good re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>port
of <hi>London,</hi> and knew many that
had relief of the rich men of <hi>London,</hi>
but now I can hear no such good re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>port,
and yet inquire of it, and hearken
for it; but now charity is waxen cold,
none helpeth the Scholer, nor yet the
poor.</p>
               <p>And in those dayes, what did they
when they helped the Scholers: <hi>Marry,</hi>
they maintained and gave them livings
that were very Papists and professed
the Popes Doctrine:<note place="margin">Oh shame.</note> and now that the
<pb n="29" facs="tcp:33738:30"/>
knowledge of Gods Word is brought
to light, and many earnestly study and
labour to set it forth, now almost no
man helpeth to maintain them.</p>
               <p>O <hi>London, London,</hi> repent, repent,
for I think God is more displeased
with <hi>London,</hi> then ever he was with the
City of <hi>Nebo.</hi> Repent therefore, re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pent
<hi>London,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Hearken <hi>London.</hi>
                  </note> and remember that the
same God liveth now that punished
<hi>Nebo,</hi> even the same God and none
other, and he will punish sin as well
now as he did then, and he will punish
the iniquity of <hi>London</hi> as well as he did
them of <hi>Nebo.</hi> Amend therefore.</p>
               <p>And ye that be Prelates look well to
your Office, for right prelating is buisy
labouring, and not lording. There<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
preach and teach, and let your
Plough be going. Ye Lords I say
that live like Loiterers,<note place="margin">Hear ye Bishops.</note> look well to
your Office, the Plough is your Office
and Charge, if you live idle and loiter,
you do not your duty, you follow not
your vocation, let your Plough there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
be going and not cease, that the
ground may bring forth fruit.</p>
               <p>But now me thinketh I hear one say
<pb n="30" facs="tcp:33738:31"/>
unto me, wot you what you say? is it a
work? is it a labour? how then hath
it hapned, that we have had so many
hundred years, so many unpreaching
Prelates, lording Loiterers, and idle
Ministers?</p>
               <p>Ye would have me here to make an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>swer,
and to shew the cause hereof?</p>
               <p>Nay, this Land is not for me to
plough, it is too stony, too thorny too
hard for me to plow.<note place="margin">Note.</note> They have so
many things that make for them, so
many things to say for themselves, that
it is not for my weak team to plough
them. They have to say for themselves
long customes, ceremonies, &amp; authority,
placing in Parliament, and many things
more. And I fear me this Land is not
yet ripe to be plowed.</p>
               <p>For as the saying is,<note place="margin">Prelacy hath lain a wither<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing this 20 years. It is ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ped it will not be so churlish as for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>merly.</note> it lacketh wither<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing:
this Geare lacketh withering, at
leastwise it is not for me to plow.</p>
               <p>For what shall I look for among
Thorns but pricking and scratching?
what among Stones but stumbling?
what (I had almost said) among Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pents
but stinging?</p>
               <p>But thus much I dare say, that since
<pb n="31" facs="tcp:33738:31"/>
lording and loitering hath come up,<note place="margin">Note.</note>
preaching hath come down, contrary
to the Apostles times, for they preach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
and lorded not; and now they lord
and preach not.</p>
               <p>For they that be Lords will not go
to plough; it is no meet office for
them, it is not seeming for their E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>state.
Thus came up lording loiterers,
thus crept in un-preaching Prelates;
and so have they long continued; for
how many unlearned Prelates have we
now at this day?</p>
               <p>And no marvel, for if the Plough<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men
that now be, were made Lords,
they would clean give over ploughing,
they would leave off their labour, and
fall to lording too outright, and the
Ploughstand. And then both Ploughs
not walking, nothing should be in the
common-weal but hunger.</p>
               <p>For ever since the Prelates were
made Lords and Nobles, the Plough
standeth, there is no work done, the
people starve.</p>
               <p>They hawk, they hunt, they card,
they dice, they pastime in their Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lacies
with gallant Gentlemen, with
<pb n="32" facs="tcp:33738:32"/>
their dancing minions, and with their
fresh Companions. So that ploughing
is set aside; And by their lording and
loitering preaching and ploughing is
clean gone.</p>
               <p>And thus if the Ploughmen in the
Country, were as negligent in their
Office as Prelates be, we should not
long live for lack of sustenance.—</p>
               <p>But they that will be true Plough<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men
must work faithfully for Gods-sake,
for the edifying of their Brethren.
And as diligently as the Husbandman
ploweth for the sustentation of the
body: so diligently must the Prelates
and Ministers labour for the feeding of
the Soul.</p>
               <p>Both the Ploughs must be still going
as most necessary for man.</p>
               <p>And wherefore are Magistrates or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dain'd,
but that the tranquility of the
Common-weal may be confirm'd li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miting
both Ploughs.</p>
               <p>But now for the fault of unpreaching
Prelates, me-think I could guess what
might be said for excusing of them.</p>
               <p>They are so troubled with Lordly li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving,
they be so placed in Palaces,
<pb n="33" facs="tcp:33738:32"/>
couched in Courts, ruffling in their
rents,<note place="margin">Note.</note> dancing in their Dominions,
burdened with Ambassages, pampring
of their panches, like a Monk that ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>keth
his Jubilee, mounching in their
mangers, and moiling in their gay
Mannors and mansions, and so trou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bled
with loitering in their Lordships
that they cannot attend it.</p>
               <p>They are otherwise occupied, some
in Kings matters, some are Ambassa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dours,
some of the privy Counsel,
some to furnish the Court, some are
Lords of the Parliament, some are
Presidents and Comptrollers of
Mintes.</p>
               <p>Well, well, Is this their duty? Is
this their Office? Is this their calling?
should we have Ministers of the
Church to be Comptrollers of the
Mintes? Is this a meet Office for a
Priest that hath cure of Souls, is this his
charge?</p>
               <p>I would here ask one question: I
would fain know who controlleth the
Devil at home at his Parish, while he
comptrolleth the Mint? If the Apostles
might not leave the Office of preaching
<pb n="34" facs="tcp:33738:33"/>
to be Deacons, shall one leave it for
minting?—</p>
               <p>In this behalf, I must speak to <hi>En<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gland;</hi>
Hear my Country <hi>England,</hi> as
<hi>Paul</hi> said in his first Epistle to the <hi>Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rinthians</hi>
chapt. 6. For <hi>Paul</hi> was no
sitting Bishop, but a walking and a
preaching Bishop: But when he went
from them, he left there behind him
the Plough going still, for he wrote
unto them, and rebuked them for go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
to Law, and pleading their causes
before Heathen Judges. <hi>I speak, saith
he, to</hi> your <hi>shame, is there not</hi> a Wise<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man,
&amp;c.</p>
               <p>So <hi>England,</hi> I speak it to thy shame,
is there never a Noble man to be a
Lord President, but it must be a Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>late?
is there never a Wiseman in the
Realm to be a Comptroller of the
Mint? I speak it to your shame, I
speak to your shame: if there be never
a Wiseman, make a Water-bearer, a
Tinker, a Cobler, a Slave, a Page
Comptroller of the Mint. Make a
mean Gentleman a Groom, a Yeo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man,
make a poor begger Lord Presi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="35" facs="tcp:33738:33"/>
Thus I speak, not that I would have
it so, but to your shame, if there be
never a Gentleman meet nor able to be
Lord President.</p>
               <p>For why are not the Noblemen and
Young Gentlemen of <hi>England,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Note.</note> so
brought up in knowledge of God and
in learning, that they may be able to
execute Offices in the Common<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>weal?</p>
               <p>The King hath a great many of
Wards, and I trow there is a Court of
Wards, why is not there a School of
Wards, as well as there is a Court for
their Lands; why are they not set in
Schools where they may learn? or why
are not they sent to the Universities,
that they may be able to serve the King
when they come to age.</p>
               <p>If the Wards and Young Gentlemen
were well brought up in learning and
in the knowledge of God, they would
not when they come to age so much
give themselves to other vanities. And
if the Nobility were well trained in
Godly learning,<note place="margin">Note.</note> the people would
follow the same train. For truly, such
as the Noblemen be such will the
<pb n="36" facs="tcp:33738:34"/>
people be, and now the only cause why
Noblemen be not made Lord Presi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dents,
is because they have not been
brought up in learning.</p>
               <p>Therefore, for the love of God, ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>point
Teachers and School-masters,
you that have charge of Youth, and give
the Teachers Stipends worthy their
pains, that they may bring them up in
Grammer, in Logick, in Rhetorick, in
Philosophy, in the civil Law, and in
that which I cannot leave unspoken of,
the Word of God.—</p>
               <p>It is as unmeet a thing for Bishops to
be Lord Presidents, or Priests to be
Minters, as it was for the Corinthians
to plead Matters of Variance before
Heathen Judges.<note place="margin">Note this ye No<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bles.</note> It is also a slander
to the Noblemen, as though they
lacked wisdome and learning, to be
able for such Offices, or else were no
men of conscience, and not meet to be
trusted.</p>
               <p>A Prelate hath a charge and cure
otherwise, and therefore he cannot
discharge his duty, and be a Lord Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sident
too; for a Presidentship requi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reth
a whole man, and a Bishop cannot
be two men.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="37" facs="tcp:33738:34"/>
A Bishop hath his Office, a flock to
teach, to look unto; and therefore he
cannot meddle with another Office,
which alone requireth a whole man. He
should therefore give it over to whom
it is meet, and labour in his own busi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness,
as <hi>Paul</hi> writeth to the Thessalo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nians:
Let every man do his own bu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>siness,
and follow his calling. Let the
Priest preach, and the Nobleman
handle the temporal matters. <hi>Moses</hi>
a marvellous man, a good man, <hi>Moses</hi>
was a wonderful fellow, and did his
duty, being a married man; we lack
such as <hi>Moses</hi> was. VVell, I would
all men would look to their duty, as
God hath called them, and then we
should have a flourishing Christian
Common-weal.</p>
               <p>And now I would ask a strange que<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stion?
who is the most diligent Bishop
and Prelate in all <hi>England,</hi> that
passeth all the rest in doing his
Office?</p>
               <p>I can tell, for I know him who it is,
I know him well. But now I think I
see you listning, hearkning, that I should
name him. There is one that passeth
<pb n="38" facs="tcp:33738:35"/>
all the other, and is the most diligent
Prelate and Preacher in all <hi>England:</hi>
                  <note place="margin">The De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vil a busie Preacher.</note>
And will ye know who it is? I will tell
you, it is the Devil: He is the most
diligent Preacher of all other, he's ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver
out of his Diocess, he is never from
his Cure, you shall never find him un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>occupied,
he is ever in his Parish, he
keepeth residence at all times, ye shall
never find him out of the way; call for
him when you will, he is ever at home,
the diligentest Preacher in all the
Realm, he is ever at his Plow, no Lord<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
nor Loytering can hinder him, he
is ever applying his business, you shall
never find him idle, I warrant you.</p>
               <p>And his Office is to hinder Religion,<note place="margin">Satan the great hinderer of Reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gion.</note>
to maintain Superstition, to set up Ido<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>latry,
to teach all kind of Popery. He
is ready as can be wished for, to set
forth his Plow, to devise as many ways
as can be, to deface and obscure Gods
Glory.</p>
               <p>Where the Devil is resident, and
hath his Plow going, there away with
Books, and up with Candles, away with
Bibles, and up with Beads, away with
the Light of the Gospel,<note place="margin">Note.</note> and up with
<pb n="39" facs="tcp:33738:35"/>
the Light of Candles, yea, at Noon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>daies.</p>
               <p>Where the Devil is resident, that
he may prevail, up with all Superstiti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
and Idolatry, Censing, Painting of
Images, Candles, Palms, Ashes, Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
water, and new Service of mens de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vising,
as though men could invent a
better way to honour God with,<note place="margin">Note.</note> than
God himself hath appointed.</p>
               <p>Down with Christ's Cross, up with
Purgatory Pick-Purse, up with him, the
Popish Purgatory, I mean.</p>
               <p>Away with Cloathing the Naked, the
Poor and Impotent; up with decking
of Images, and gay garnishing of stocks
and stones.</p>
               <p>Up with mans Traditions and his
Laws, down with Gods Traditions, and
his most holy Word.</p>
               <p>Down with the old Honour due to
God, and up with the new gods ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour.—</p>
               <p>But here some men will say to me,
What Sir, are ye so privy of the Devils
Counsel, that ye know all this to be
true?</p>
               <p>Truly I know him too well, and have
<pb n="40" facs="tcp:33738:36"/>
obeyed him a little too much, in con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>descending
to some Follies. And I
know that he is ever occupied, and ever
busie, in following his Plow. I know
by St <hi>Peter,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">1 Pet. 5.</note> which saith of him, <hi>Sicut

He <hi>goeth about like a roaring Lion,
seeking whom he may devour.</hi> I would
have this Text well viewed.—</p>
               <p>There was never such a Preacher in
<hi>England</hi> as he is: Who is able to tell
his diligent Preaching? who every day
and every hour laboureth to sow Cockle
and Darnel, that he may bring out of
form, and out of estimation, and room,
the Institution of the Lords Supper, and
Christ's Cross.—</p>
               <p>The Devil by the help of that <hi>Italian</hi>
Bishop yonder, his Chaplain,<note place="margin">Pope the Devils Chaplain</note> hath la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>boured
by all means that he might, to
frustrate the Death of Christ, and the
Merits of his Passion. And they have
devised for that purpose, to make us
believe in other vain things; as to have
Remission of sins for praying on Hal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowed
Beads, for drinking of the Back<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>house
Bole, as a Canon of <hi>Walton</hi> Ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bey
once told me, that whensoever they
<pb n="41" facs="tcp:33738:36"/>
put their Loave; of Bread into the O<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven,
as many as drank of the Pardon-Bole,
should have pardon for drinking
of it. A mad thing, to give pardon
to a Bole!—</p>
               <p>Wo worth thee, O Devil, wo worth
thee, that hast prevail'd so far, and so
long, that hast made <hi>England</hi> to wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ship
false gods, forsaking Christ their
Lord; wo worth thee Devil, wo worth
thee Devil, and all thy Angels.—</p>
               <p>When the Kings Majesty,<note place="margin">Note.</note> with the
Advice of His Honourable Council, go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth
about to promote Gods Word, and
to set an Order in matters of Religion,
there shall not lack <hi>Blanchers,</hi> that will
say, as for Images, whereas they have
been used to be Censed, and to have
Candles offered unto them, none be so
foolish to do it to the Stock or
Stone, or to the Image it self, but it is
done to God and his Honour before the
Image. And though they should abuse
it, these <hi>Blanchers</hi> whould be ready to
whisper the King in the ear, and to tell
him, that this Abuse is but a small mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter;
and that the same, with all other
Abuses in the Church, may be reform<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
<pb n="42" facs="tcp:33738:37"/>
easily; it is but a little Abuse,<note place="margin">Why our reforma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion is so imperfect</note> say
they, and it may be easily amended.
But it should not be taken in hand at the
first, for fear of trouble or further In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>conveniences;
the People will not bear
sudden Alterations, and Insurrection
may be made after sudden Mutations,
which may be to the great Harm and
Lofs of the Realm: Therefore all shall
be well, but not out of hand, for fear
of further business.</p>
               <p>These be the <hi>Blanchers</hi> that have hi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>therto
stopped the Word of God, and
hindred the true setting forth of the
same.<note place="margin">Note this wel.</note> There be so many put offs, so
many put by's, so many respects and
considerations of worldly wisdom.</p>
               <p>And I doubt not, but there were
<hi>Blanchers</hi> in the old time, to whisper
in the ear of good King <hi>Hezekiah,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Note.</note> for
the maintenance of Idolatry done to
the <hi>Brazen Serpent,</hi> as well as there has
been now of late, and be now, that can
blanch the abuse of Images as other like
things: But good King <hi>Hezekiah</hi> would
not be so blinded, he was like to <hi>Apol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lo,</hi>
fervent in Spirit, he would give no
ear to these <hi>Blanchers,</hi> he was not mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved
<pb n="43" facs="tcp:33738:37"/>
with these worldly respects, with
these prudent Considerations, with these
Policies, he feared not Insurrections
of the people.</p>
               <p>He feared not,<note place="margin">Note.</note> lest his people would
not bear the Glory of God; but he
(without any of these respects, or Po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>licies,
or Considerations) like a good
King, for Gods sake, and for Consci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence
sake, by and by plucked down the
<hi>Brazen Serpent,</hi> and destroyed it utterly,
and beat it to powder: He out of hand
did cast out all Images, he destroyed all
Idolatry, and clearly did extirpate all
Superstition.</p>
               <p>He would not hear these <hi>Blanchers,</hi>
and worldly wise men, but without de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lay
followeth Gods Cause, and destroy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth
all Idolatry out of hand.</p>
               <p>This did good King <hi>Hezekiah,</hi> for
he was like <hi>Apollo,</hi> fervent in spirit,
and diligent to promote Gods Glory.</p>
               <p>And good hope there is, that it shall
be likewise here in <hi>England;</hi> for the
Kings <hi>Majesty</hi> is so brought up in
knowledge, vertue and godliness, that
it is not to be mistrusted, but that we
shall have all things well, and that the
<pb n="44" facs="tcp:33738:38"/>
Glory of God shall be spread abroad
through all parts of the Realm,<note place="margin">Note, Who hindred a more perfect reforma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion.</note> if the
Prelates will diligently apply their
Plow, and be Preachers rather than
Lords.</p>
               <p>But our <hi>Blanchers</hi> which will be Lords,
and no Labourers, when they are com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manded
to go and be resident upon
their Cures, and preach in their Bene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fices,
they will say;</p>
               <p>What! I have set a Deputy there,
I have a Deputy that looketh well to
my Flock, who shall discharge my duty.
A Deputy (quoth he) I looked for
that word all this while. And what a
Deputy must he be, trow ye? Even
one like himself, he must be a Canonist,
that is to say, one that is brought up in
the study of Popes Laws and Decrees,
one that will set forth Papistry as well
as himself, and one that will maintain
all Idolatry and Superstition, and one
that will nothing at all, or else very
weakly, resist the Devils Plow; yea,
happy it is, if he take no part with the
Devil;<note place="margin">Little hope of good by Curates.</note> and where he should be an ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>my
to him, it is well, if he take not
the Devils part against Christ.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="45" facs="tcp:33738:38"/>
But in the mean time, the Prelates
take their pleasures, they are Lords, and
no Labourers; but the Devil is diligent
at his Plow, he is no unpreaching Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>late,
he is no Lordly Loyterer from his
Cure, but a busie Plow-man; so that
amongst all the Prelates, and among
all the pack of them that have Cure,
the Devil shall go for my money; for
he still applieth his Business. There<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
ye <hi>Unpreaching Prelates,</hi> learn of
the Devil to be diligent in doing your
Office. Learn of the Devil: And if
ye will not learn of God and good men,
for shame learn of the Devil; <hi>ad eru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bescentiam
vestram dico,</hi> I speak it for
your shame, if you will not learn of
God nor good men, to be diligent in
your Office, learn of the Devil.</p>
               <p>Howbeit there is now very good hope,
that the Kings Majesty being by the
help of good governance of his most
Honourable Counsellors, trained and
brought up in Learning and Knowledge
of Gods Word, will shortly provide a
remedy, and set an order herein; which
thing, that it may so be, let us pray for
him; pray for him good people, pray

               <p>But ye shall consider that the fore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>said

of all Scriptures, but only of those
which are of God written in Gods Book,
and all things which are therein,<note place="margin">Excellen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy of Gods Word.</note> are
written for our Learning. The Excel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lency
of this word, is so great, and of
so high dignity, that there is no earthly
thing to be compared do it.</p>
               <p>The Author thereof is great, that is,
God himself, Eternal, Almighty, ever<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lasting.
The Scripture because of him,
is also Great, Eternal, most Mighty,

               <p>There is no King, Emperor, Magi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>strate
and Ruler of what state soever
they be, but are bound to obey this
God, and to give credence unto his Holy
Word, in directing their steps ordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nately
according to the same Word:
Yea truly, they are not only bound to
obey Gods Book, but also the Ministry
<pb n="48" facs="tcp:33738:40"/>
of the same, so far as he speaketh sitting
in <hi>Moses</hi> Chair.—</p>
               <p>For in this world God hath two
Svvords, the one is a Temporal Svvord,
the other a Spiritual.—</p>
               <p>The King correcteth Transgresson
vvith the Temporal Svvord, yea, the
Preacher, if he be an Offender. But
the Preacher cannot correct the King,
if he be a Transgressor of Gods Word,
vvith the Temporal Svvord: But he
must correct and reprove him vvith the
Spiritual Svvord, fearing no man, set<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting
God only before his eyes, under
vvhom he is a Minister, to supplant and
root up all Vice and Mischief by Gods
Word.—</p>
               <p>Therefore let the Preacher teach, re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prove,
amend and instruct in Righte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ousness,
vvith the Spiritual Svvord,
fearing no man,<note place="margin">Hear ye Preachers</note> though death should

               <p>If he preach before a King, let his
matter be concerning the Office of a
King, if before a Bishop,—</p>
               <p>I have thought it good to intreat up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
these words following, which are
written in the seventeenth Chapter of
<hi>Deuteronomy,</hi> from Verse 14. down<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards.—</p>
               <p>As the Text doth rise, I will touch
and go a little in every place.—</p>
               <p>To have a King, the <hi>Israelites</hi> did
with much importunity call unto God,
and God long before promised them a
King, and they were fully certified
thereof, that God had promised that
thing: For unto <hi>Abraham</hi> he said,
<hi>Gen. 17. 6. Kings shall come out of thee.</hi>
These words were spoken long before
the Children of <hi>Israel</hi> had any King;
notwithstanding here yet God prescri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bed
unto them an Order, how they
should chuse their King, and what man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner
of man he should be, where he
saith, <hi>When thou shalt come,</hi> &amp;c.</p>
               <p>As who should say, O ye Children
of <hi>Israel,</hi> I know your nature right
<pb n="51" facs="tcp:33738:41"/>
well,—I know that thou wilt chuse a
King to reign over thee, and to appear
glorious in the face of the world, after
the manner of the Gentiles: But be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause
thou art stiffe-necked, wild, and
art given to walk without a Bridle or
Line, therefore now I will prevent thy
evil and beastly Manners, I will hedge
strongly thy way, I will make a durable
Law which shall compell thee to walk
ordinately, and in a plain way, that is,
thou shalt not chuse thee a King after
thy Will and phantasie, but after me,
thy Lord and God.</p>
               <p>Thus God conditioned with the
Jews, that their King should be such a
one as He himself would choose them.</p>
               <p>This was not much unlike a bargain
that I heard of late, should be betwixt
two friends for a Horse, the Owner
promised the other should have the
Horse if he would, the other asked the
price, he said 20. Nobles; The other
would give him but four pounds; the
Owner said he should not have it then,
the other claimed the Horse, because
he said he should have him if he
would.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="52" facs="tcp:33738:42"/>
Thus this bargain became a <hi>West<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minster</hi>
matter, the Lawyers got twice
the value of the Horse, and when all
came to all, two fools made an end of
the matter.</p>
               <p>Howbeit the Israelites could not go
to Law with God for choosing their
King, for, will they, nill they, their
King should be of his choosing, lest
they should walk inordinately—
for as they say commonly, <hi>Qui vadit
planè, vadit sanè;</hi> that is, He that
walketh plainly, walketh safely. And
the Jews were stiff-necked, and were
ever ready to walk inordinately. No
less are vve Englishmen given to unto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vvardness
and inordinate vvalking.—</p>
               <p>There is a great error risen novv:
dayes among many of us,<note place="margin">Let our wild Pha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>natiques observe this.</note> vvhich are
vain and nevv fangled men climbing
beyond the limits of our capacity and
vvit, in vvrenching this Text of Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture
hereafter follovving after their
ovvn Phansie and Brain, their errour is
upon this Text, 1 <hi>Sam.</hi> 8. 7. They
wrench these words after their own
fantasies, and make much doubt as
touching a King and his Godly
name.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="53" facs="tcp:33738:42"/>
They that so do, walk inordinately,
they walk not directly and plainly, but
delight in balks and stubble way. It
maketh no matter by what name the
Rulers be named, if so be they shall
walk ordinately with God, and direct
their steps with God, for both Patri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>arches
Judges and Kings had, and have
their authority from God, and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
Godly.</p>
               <p>But this is to be considered which
God saith,<note place="margin">Deut. 17. 15.</note> thou maist not set a stran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger

               <p>It hath pleased God to grant us a na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tural

Oh what a plague were it, that a strange
King of a strange Land, and of a strange
Religion should raign over us: where
<pb n="54" facs="tcp:33738:43"/>
now we be governed in the true Reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gion,
he should extirpe and pluck away
all together, aud then plant again all
Abomination and Popery, God keep
such a King from us.</p>
               <p>Well, the Kings grace hath two
Sisters,<note place="margin">
                     <hi>Latimer</hi> proved a true Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phet<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>

<hi>Elizabeth,</hi> which by Succession and
Course, are Inheritors to the Crown,
who, if they should marry with stran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gers,
what should ensue? God know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth.
But God grant (if they so do,
whereby strange Religion cometh in)
that they never come to coursing not
succeeding.</p>
               <p>Therefore to avoid this Plague, let
us amend our Lives, and put away all
pride, which doth drown men in this
Realm, at these daies; all Covetous<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness,
wherein the Magistrates and rich
men are overwhelmed, all lechery, and
other excessive vices, provoking Gods
wrath (were he not merciful) even to
take from us our natural King and Liege
Lord;<note place="margin">Note.</note> yea to plague us with a strange
King for our unrepentant hearts.</p>
               <p>Wherefore if as ye say,<note place="margin">The true Roaylist.</note> ye love the

               <p>
                  <pb n="55" facs="tcp:33738:43"/>
Now I hear all things shall be ended
after a Godly manner shortly. Make
hast, make hast, and let us learn to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vert
to repent and mend our lives: if
we do not, I fear, I fear, lest for our sins
and unthankfulness an hypocrite shall
reign over us.—</p>
               <p>Let us pray, that God maintain and
continue our Most Excellent King here
present.—</p>
               <p>He doth Rectifie us in the liberty
of the Gospel,<note place="margin">

stand.—</p>
               <p>He shall not prepare unto himself
many Horses, &amp;c. In speaking of these
Words ye shall understand, that I do
not intend to speak against the strength,
policy and provision of a King, but
against excess and vain trust that Kings
have in themselves, more then in the
living God, the Author of all goodness
and Giver of all Victory. Many Horses
are requisite for a King, but he may not
exceed in them, nor triumph in them
more then is needful, for the necessary
affairs and defence of the Realm.</p>
               <p>What meaneth it, that God hath to
do with the Kings Stable; but only he
<pb n="56" facs="tcp:33738:44"/>
would be Master of his Horses, The
Scripture saith: <hi>In altis habitat,</hi> he
dwelleth on high; it followeth, <hi>Hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>milia
respicit,</hi> he looketh on the low
things, yea upon the Kings Stables<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
and upon all the Offices in his
House.</p>
               <p>God is a great Grand Master of the
Kings house,<note place="margin">Let Courtiers observe this.</note> and will take account of
every one that beareth rule therein; for
the executing of their Offices, whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
they have justly and truly ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved
the King in their Offices, or
no.</p>
               <p>Yea, God looketh upon the King
Himself, if he work well or not. Eve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry
King is subject unto God, and all
other men are subjects unto the
King.</p>
               <p>In a King God requireth faith, not
excess of Horses, Horses for a King be
good and necessary, if they be well used,
but—</p>
               <p>Neither shall he multiply wives,
&amp;c.—</p>
               <p>Let us not think that, because we
read that Kings among the Jews had
liberty to take more wives than one,
<pb n="57" facs="tcp:33738:44"/>
that we may therefore attempt to walk
inordinately.—</p>
               <p>For Christ hath forbidden this unto
us Christians, and limiteth unto us
one wife only. And it is a great thing
for a man to rule one wife rightly and
ordinately; for a Woman is frail, and
proclive unto all evils; a Woman is a
very weak Vessel, and may soon de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive
a man, and bring him into evil.
Many Examples we have in Scripture,
<hi>Adam</hi> by <hi>Eve.</hi>—</p>
               <p>How did wicked <hi>Jezebel?</hi>—</p>
               <p>Therefore let our King, what time
his Grace shall be so minded to take a
wife, chuse him one which is of God;
that is, which is of the Houshould of
faith—And that shee be such a one
as the King can find in his Heart to
love, and lead his life in pure and chast
Espousage; and then shall he be the
more prone and ready to advance Gods
Glory, and to punish and extirpe the
great lechery used in this Realm.</p>
               <p>Therefore we ought to make a con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinual
Prayer unto God,<note place="margin">Our pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sent duty</note> for to grant
our Kings Grace such a Mate as may
knit his heart and hers, according to
<pb n="58" facs="tcp:33738:45"/>
Gods Ordinance and Law, and not to
consider and cleave only to a politique
matter or conjunction, for the enlarge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
of Dominions for surety and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fence
of Countries.—</p>
               <p>We have now a pretty little shilling,
indeed a very pretty one, I have but one
I think in my Purse, and the last day I
had put it away almost for an old
Groat, and so I trust some will take
them; the fineness of the Silver I cannot
see: but therein is printed a fine sen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tence,
that is,<note place="margin">A good wish.</note> 
                  <hi>Timor Domini fons sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pientiae.</hi>
The fear of the Lord is the
Fountain of wisdom. I would to God
this Sentence were printed in the heart
of the King in choosing his Wife and
all his Officers.</p>
               <p>For as the fear of God is <hi>fons sapien<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiae,</hi>
so the forgetting of God is <hi>

                     </gap>
stultitiae,</hi> the fountain of foolishness;
though it be never so politique.—</p>
               <p>Let the King therefore chuse unto
him a Godly wife, whereby he shall
the better live chast, and in so living<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
all Godliness shall increase, and righ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teousness
be maintained.</p>
               <p>Notwithstanding I know hereafter,
<pb n="59" facs="tcp:33738:45"/>
some will come and move your Grace
toward wantonness, and to the inclina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
of the flesh, and vain Affections.
But I would your Grace would bear in
memory, and History of a good King,
called <hi>Lewis</hi> (that travelled towards the
Holy Land) which was a great matter
in those dayes, and by the way sickned,
being long absent from his Wife, and
upon this matter, the Physitians did
agree, that it was for lack of a <hi>Woman;</hi>
and did consult with the Bishops there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in,
who did conclude, that because of
the Distance from his Wife (being in
another Country) he should take a
<hi>Wench.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>This good King hearing their Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clusion,
would not assent thereunto, but
said, he had rather be sick even unto
death, than he would break his Espou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sals.
Wo worth such Counsellors, Bi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>shops!
nay rather Buzzards.</p>
               <p>Nevertheless, if the King should
have consented to their Conclusion, and
accomplished the same, if he had chan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ced
well, they would have excused the
matter; as I have heard, one being re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proacht
for such Counsel given, he ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cused
<pb n="60" facs="tcp:33738:46"/>
the matter, saying, that he gave
him none other Counsel, but if it had
been his case, he would have done like<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wise;
so I think the Bishops would
have excused the matter, if the King
should have reproved them for their
Counsel: I do not read, the King did
so; but if he had, I know what would
have been their Answer, they would
have said, We give you no worse coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sel,
than we would have followed our
selves, if we had been in like case.</p>
               <p>Well Sir, this King did well, and
had the fear of God before his eyes.—</p>
               <p>Let the King therefore chuse a Wife
which feareth God, let him not seek a
proud Wanton, one full of rich Trea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sures
and worldy Pomp.</p>
               <p>Neither shall he multiply to himself too
much silver and Gold. &amp;c.</p>
               <p>He shall not multiply unto himself
too much Gold and Silver: Is there
too much think you for a King? God
doth allow much unto a King, and it is
expedient that he should have much;
for he hath great expences.—</p>
               <p>Necessary it is, that the King have a
Treasure alwaies in readiness for such
<pb n="61" facs="tcp:33738:46"/>
affairs as be daily in his hands: The
which Treasure, if it be not sufficient,
he may lawfully and with a safe Consci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence,
take Taxes of his Subjects; for
it were not meet,—</p>
               <p>But who shall see this too much, or
tell the King of this too much? Think
you any of the Kings Privy Chamber?
No. For fear of loss of Favour. Shall
any of his Sworn Chaplains? No.
They be of his Closet, and keep close
such matters. But the King himself
must see this too much, and that he
shall do by no means, with Corporal
eyes: Wherefore he must have a pair
of Spectacles, which shall have two
clear Sights in them; that is, the one
is <hi>Faith,</hi> the other is <hi>Charity:</hi> By them
two, must the King ever see when he
hath too much.—</p>
               <p>I will tell you, my Lords and Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sters,
this is not for the Kings Honour:
Yet some will say, Knowest thou what
is for the Kings Honour better than
we?</p>
               <p>I answer, the Kings Honour is most
perfectly painted forth in Scripture; of
which,<note place="margin">Note.</note> if ye be ignorant, for lack of
<pb n="62" facs="tcp:33738:47"/>
time, that ye cannot read it, though
your Counsel be never so politick, yet
it is not for the Kings Honour. What
his Honour meaneth, ye cantot tell.</p>
               <p>It is the Kings Honour, that his Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jects
be led in the true Religion: That
all his Prelates and Clergy be set about
their work, in Preaching and Studying,
and not be interrupted from their
Charge. Also it is the Kings Honour.—</p>

were good Preachers. I left out an Histo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry
then, which now I will tell you.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="63" facs="tcp:33738:47"/>
There was a Bishop of <hi>Winchester</hi> in
King <hi>Henry</hi> the Sixth's daies.—</p>
               <p>This Bishop was a Great man born,
and did bear such a stroak, he was able
to shoulder the Lord Protector; it
chanced the Lord Protector and he fell
out, and the Bishop would bear nothing
at all with him, but played me the <hi>Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trapa;</hi>
so—</p>
               <p>Was not this a good Prelate? He
should have been at home preaching in
his Diocess with a <hi>Wanniaunt.</hi> This
Protector was so Noble a Godly man,
that he was called of every man the good
Duke <hi>Humphrey:</hi> He kept such a
House,—.</p>
               <p>And the Bishop for standing so stiff<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
by the matter, and bearing up the
Order of our Mother, the Holy Church,
was made a Cardinal at <hi>Calice,</hi> and
thither the Bishop of <hi>Rome</hi> sent him a
Cardinals Hat: He should have had
a <hi>Tyburne</hi>-Tippet, a half peny Halter,
and all such proud Prelates.</p>
               <p>When he sitteth upon the Throne,
what shall he do? Shall he dance and
dally, banquet, havvk and hunt?</p>
               <p>No forsooth Sir.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="64" facs="tcp:33738:48"/>
What must he do then? He must
be a Student; not thinking, because he
is a King, he hath License to do vvhat
he vvill, as these vvorldly Flatterers are
vvont to say, ye trouble not your self,
(Sir) ye may havvk and hunt, and
take your pleasure; as for the guiding
of your Kingdom and People, let us a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lone
vvith it.</p>
               <p>These flattering Clavv-backs are Ori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginal
Roots of all Mischief; and yet a
King may take his Pastime in Havvking
and Hunting, or such like Pleasures, but
he must,—</p>
               <p>It follovveth in the Text, <hi>Deut. 17. 19.
He shall have it with him,</hi> in his Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gresse.—</p>
               <p>He shall read in it, not once a year,
but all the daies of his life. Where are
these Worldlings novv? these Blad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der-puft-up
vvily men?<note place="margin">Note,</note> Wo vvorth
them, that ever they vvere about any
King.</p>
               <p>But hovv shall he read this Book?
As the Homilies are read? Some call
them Homilies, and indeed so they may
be vvell called, for they are homely
handled.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="65" facs="tcp:33738:48"/>
For though the Priest read them ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver
so vvell, yet if the Parish like them
not, there is such talking and babling,
that nothing can be heard.</p>
               <p>And if the Parish be good, and the
Priest naught, he vvill so hack and chop
it, that it vvere as good to be vvithout
it, for any vvord that shall be under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stood.
And yet (the more pity) it is
suffered of your Graces Bishops in their
Diocess unpunished.</p>
               <p>But I vvill be a Suitor to your Grace,
that you vvill give your Bishops charge
ere they go home,<note place="margin">A good motion.</note> upon their Allegi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance,
to look better to their Flock, and
to see your Majesties Injunctions better
kept, and send your Visitors in their
Tayls, and if they be found negligent
in their duties, out vvith them, I re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quire
it in Gods behalf, make them
<hi>Quondams,</hi> all the Pack of them.</p>
               <p>But ye vvill say, Where shall vve
have any to put in their rooms?—</p>
               <p>Your Majesty hath divers of your
Chaplains, well learned men, and of
good knowlede, and yet ye have some
bad enough, hangers on the Court, I
mean not these,—</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="66" facs="tcp:33738:49"/>
What an Enormity is this in a Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stian
Realm to serve in a Civility,<note place="margin">Note.</note> ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving
the profit of a Provostship, and a
Deanry, and a Parsonage? But I will
tell you what is like to come of it: It
will bring the Clergy shortly into a ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry
Slavery. I may not forget here my
<hi>Scala Caeli,</hi> that I spake of in my last
Sermon; I will repeat it now again, de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>siring
your Grace in Gods behalf, that
you will remember it.</p>
               <p>The Bishop of <hi>Rome</hi> had a <hi>Scala coeli,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">It is now upon the matter a common Prayer matter.</note>
but his was a Masse-matter: But this
<hi>Scala Coeli</hi> that I now speak of, is the
true Ladder that bringeth a man to hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven:
The top of the Ladder, or first
Greese is this; <hi>Whosoever calleth on the
name of the Lord shall be saved.</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Rom. 10</note> The se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cond

Fourth Step, <hi>How shall they hear without
a Preacher?</hi> Now the nether end of
the Ladder is, <hi>How shall they preach ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cept

Ladder. So that we may go backward

               <p>Ever since the Bishop of <hi>Rome</hi> was
first in authority,<note place="margin">Note.</note> they have gone about
to destroy the Gospel, but God work<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth
wonderfully, he hath preserved it,
maugre all their hearts, and yet we are
unthankful, that we cannot consider it.</p>
               <p>I will tell you what a Bishop of this
Realm said once to me, he sent for me,
and marvelled, that I would not consent
to such Traditions as were then set out.</p>
               <p>And I answered him,<note place="margin">
                     <hi>Latimer</hi> desired Gods Word to be the Rule of reforma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion.</note> that I would
be ruled by Gods Book, and rather
than I would dissent one jot from it, I
would be torn with wild horses. And
I chanced in our Communication, to
name the Lords Supper: Tush, saith
the Bishop, What do you call the Lords
Supper? What new Term is that?
There stood by him a Dubber, one
Doctor <hi>Dubber,</hi> he dubbed him by and
by, and said, that this Term was sel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom
read in the Doctors. And I made
Answer, that I would rather follow
<hi>Paul,</hi> in using his Terms, than them,
though they had all the Doctors on
their side.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="68" facs="tcp:33738:50"/>
Why, (said the Bishop) cannot we
without the Scriptures order the peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple?
How did they before the Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture
was first written?</p>
               <p>But God knoweth, full ill yet would
they have ordered them.<note place="margin">Note.</note> For seeing,
that having it, they have deceived us,
in what case should we have been novv
vvithout it? But thanks be unto God,
that by so vvonderful a Miracle he hath
preserved the Book still.—</p>
               <p>It is in the Text, that a King ought
to fear God, he shall have the dread of
God before his eyes. Work not by
vvorldly Policy, for vvorldly Policy
feareth not God. Take heed of these
Clavv-backs, these venomous people,
that vvill come to you, that vvill fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lovv
you like <hi>Gnato's</hi> &amp; <hi>Parasites,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Note.</note> if you
follovv them, you are out of your Book,
if it be not according to Gods Word,
that they counsel you; do it not fo<gap reason="illegible" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>

any vvorldly Policy, for then you fear
not God.—</p>
               <p>But vvherefore shall a King fear
God? It follovveth in the Text, that
he may prolong his daies in his King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom.—</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="69" facs="tcp:33738:50"/>
Remember this, I beseech your
Grace; and when these Flatterers and
Flebergibs, another day shall come and
claw you by the back, and say, Sir, trou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble
not your self: What, shall you
study? Why should you do this or
that?</p>
               <p>Your Grace may answer them thus,
and say, What Sirra! I perceive you
are a weary of Us, and our Posterity:
Doth not God say in such a place, that
a King shall write out a Book of Gods
Law, and read it? Learn to fear God.
And why? That he, and his might
reign long. I perceive now, thou art a
Traytor.</p>
               <p>Tell him this Tale once, and I war<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rant
you, he will come no more to you,
neither he, nor any, after such a

               <p>And thus shall your Grace drive such
Flatterers and Claw-backs away.—</p>
               <p>You have heard how a King ought to
pass the time.—</p>
               <p>He may learn at <hi>Solomon.—:</hi>
               </p>
               <p>What was <hi>Solomons</hi> Petition? Lord,
said he, <hi>Da mihi cor docile:</hi> he asked
a docible heart, a wise heart, and wis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom
<pb n="70" facs="tcp:33738:51"/>
to go in and to go out.—</p>
               <p>So your Grace must learn how to do

               <p>Now when God had given <hi>Solomon</hi>

               <p>Would <hi>Solomon,</hi> being so Noble a

were poor, for as the Scripture saith,
they were together alone in a House,
they had not so much as one servant

               <head>Part of the Third Sermon of Mr.
Hugh Latimer, preached be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
King Edward.</head>
               <p>A Preacher hath two Offices. 1 To
Teach true Doctrine; 2 To
confute Gainsayers.—</p>
               <p>VVhy you will say, will any body
gainsay true Doctrine?—</p>
               <p>VVas there ever yet Preachers, but
there were Gainsayers.—</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Ieremy</hi> was the Minister of the true
VVord of God.—</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Elias</hi> had <hi>Baals</hi> Priests supported by
<hi>Iezebel,</hi> to speak against him.—</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Iohn Baptist,</hi> and our Saviour
Christ.—</p>
               <p>The Apostles had Gainsayers, <hi>Acts</hi>

28. 22. This Sect is every where spo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken
against.—</p>
               <p>In the Popish Masse time there was
no gainsaying.—</p>
               <p>So long as we had in adoration, the
Popish Masse we were then without
gainsaying.—</p>
               <p>VVhen Sathan the Devil hath the
guiding of the House he keepeth all in
peace.—</p>
               <p>VVhen he hath the Religion in pos<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>session,
he stirreth up no sedition, I
warrant you.</p>
               <p>How many dissentions have we heard
of in Turky,—look whether ye
hear of any Heresies among the
Jews.—</p>
               <p>And if ever concord should have
been in Religion, when should it have
been, but when Christ was here? Ye
find fault with Preachers, and say, they
cause sedition:<note place="margin">Note.</note> VVe are noted to be
rash, and indiscreet in our preaching:
yet as discreet as Christ was, there was
diversity.—</p>
               <p>There was never Prophet to be com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pared
to him, and yet there was never
more dissention, then when he was,
<pb n="75" facs="tcp:33738:53"/>
and preached himself.—</p>
               <p>This day I must do somewhat in the
second Office.—</p>
               <p>But first, I will make a short rehear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sall
to put you in memory.—</p>
               <p>The peevish people in this Realm,
have nothing but the King, the King in
their mouths, when it maketh for their
purpose. As there was a Doctor that
preached, the Kings Majesty hath his
Holy water, he creepeth to the Cross;
and then they have nothing but the
King, the King in their mouths.
These be they my good people that
must have their mouths stopt: but if a
man tell them of the Kings proceed<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings,
now they have their shifts and
their put ofts, saying we may not go
before a Law: we may break no or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der.
These be the wicked Preachers,
their mouths must be stopt, these be the
gainsayers.—</p>
               <p>Now to my confutation.</p>
               <p>There is a certain man that shortly
after my first Sermon, being ask't, if
he had been at the Sermon that day?
Answered, yea. I pray you said he, how
liked you him? Marry, said he, as I li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ked
<pb n="76" facs="tcp:33738:54"/>
him alwayes, a seditious Fellow
Oh Lord, he pinched me there indeed
nay,<note place="margin">Note.</note> he rather had a full bit at me
Yet I comfort my self with that, that
Christ was noted to be a Stirrer up of
the People.—</p>
               <p>It becometh me to take it in good
part, I am not better then He was.
In the Kings dayes that dead is, a many
of us were called together before him,
to say our minds in certain matters.
In the end, one kneeled me down,
and accused me of sedition, that I had
preached seditious Doctrine. A hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vy
salutation, and a hard point of such
a mans doing, as if I should name him,
ye would not think it. The King
turned to me, and said, what say you
to that Sir? Then I kneeled down,
and turned me first to mine accuser,
and required him; Sir, what form of
preaching would you appoint me to
preach before a King; would you have
me to preach nothing,<note place="margin">Note.</note> as concerning a
King in the Kings Sermon? have you
any Commission to appoint me what I
shall preach? Besides this, I asked
him divers other questions, and he
<pb n="77" facs="tcp:33738:54"/>
would make no answer. Then I turn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
me to the King, and submitted my
self to his Grace, and said I never
thought my self worthy, nor ever sued
to be a Preacher before your Grace,
but I was called to it, and would be
willing (if you mislike me) to give
place to my betters. For I grant there
be a great many more worthy of the
Room then I am; and if it be your
Graces pleasure so to allow them for
Preachers, I could be content to bear
their books after them.</p>
               <p>But if your Grace allow me for a
Preacher, I would desire your Grace to
give me leave to discharge my con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>science.<note place="margin">Note.</note>
Give me leave to frame my
Doctrine according to my Audience,
I had been a very dolt to have preached
so at the borders of your Realm, as I
preached before your Grace. And I
thank Almighty God, which hath al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wayes
been my Remedy, that my say<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings
were well accepted of the King,
for like a gracious Lord he turned into
another communication: it is even as
the Scripture saith: <hi>Cor Regis in manu
Domini,</hi> the Lord directeth the Kings
<gap reason="illegible" extent="1 word">
                     <desc>〈◊〉</desc>

                  <pb n="78" facs="tcp:33738:55"/>
Certain of my Friends came to me
with tears in their Eyes, and told me
they looked I should have been in the
<hi>Tower</hi> the same night.</p>
               <p>Thus I have been ever more burden<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
with the word of sedition.</p>
               <p>I have offended God grievously,<note place="margin">Note.</note>
transgressing his Law, and but for this
remedy and his mercy,<note place="margin">Confessi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of sin.</note> I would not
look to be saved.</p>
               <p>As for sedition, for ought that I
know, methinks, I should not need
Christ, if I might say so. But if I be
clear in any thing, I am clear in this,
so far as I know mine own heart, there
is no man farther from sedition then I;
which I have declared in all my doings,
and yet it hath been ever laid to me.<note place="margin">Note.</note>
               </p>
               <p>Another, when I gave over mine
Office, I should have received a pente<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>costal,
it came to the summe of fifty
and five pound, I set my Commissary
to gather it, but he could not be suffer'd,
for it was said a sedition would rise
upon it.</p>
               <p>Thus they burdened me ever with
sedition.</p>
               <p>So this Gentleman, cometh up now
<pb n="79" facs="tcp:33738:55"/>
with sedition: and wot ye what? I
chanced in my last Sermon to speak a
merry word of the new shilling (to
refresh my Auditory) how I was like
to put away my new shilling for an
old groat, I was herein noted to speak
seditiously—When I was in trouble,
it was objected to me that I was singu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lar,
that I took a way contrary to all.
Marry Sir, this was sore thunderbolts,
I thought it was possible it might not
be true he told me.—</p>
               <p>I have gotten one Fellow a Compa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion
of sedition; and wot you who is
my Fellow? <hi>Esai</hi> the Prophet. I
spake but of a little pretty shilling, but
he speaketh to <hi>Ierusalem</hi> after another
sort, <hi>Esai.</hi> 1. 21, 22, 23. and was so bold
to meddle with their coin.—</p>
               <p>Ah seditious wretch, what had he to
do with the mint.—</p>
               <p>Was not this a seditious Harlot,
to tell them this to their beards? to
their face.—</p>
               <p>I am content to bear the title of se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dition
with <hi>Esai.</hi> Thanks be to God
I am not alone.—</p>
               <p>In the latter end of my Sermon,
<pb n="90" facs="tcp:33738:56"/>
I rehearsed a parable of a wicked Judge.</p>
               <p>Belike good Judges were rare at that
time; and trow ye, the Devil hath
been asleep ever since? No, no,—</p>
               <p>The common manner of wicked
Judge, is neither to fear God or Man.
He considereth what a man he is, and
therefore careth not for man; He
seemeth to be in a protection <hi>t</hi> well
shall he escape? Ho, ho, <hi>Est Deus in
coelo.</hi> There is a God in Heaven, He
accepteth no persons, He will punish
them.—</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Cambises</hi> was a great Emperour, such
another as our Master is—</p>
               <p>It chanced, he had under him in one
of his Dominions, a Briber, a Gift<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taker,
a Gratifier of rich men, a Hand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maker
in his Office, to make his Son a
great man (as the old saying is, Happy
is the Child whose Father goeth to the
Devil) the cry of the poor Widdow
came to the Emperours ear, which
caused him to slay the Iudge quick, and
laid his skin in the Chair of judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment,
that all Iudges that should give
judgment afterwards should sit in the
same skin.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="81" facs="tcp:33738:56"/>
Surely it was a goodly Sign, a good<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
Monument, the Sign of the Judges
Skin; I pray God we may once see the
Sign of the Skin in <hi>England.</hi>—I do it
charitably, for the love I bear to my
Country. God saith, <hi>Ego visitabo.</hi> I
will visit. God hath two Visitations:
the first is, when he revealed his Word
by Preachers, and where the first is ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cepted,
the second cometh not; the
second Visitation is Vengeance. He
went to Visitation, when he brought
the Judges skin over his ears.—</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Germany</hi> was visited twenty years
with Gods Word, but they did not
earnestly embrace it, and in life follow
it, but made a mingle mangle and a
hotch potch of it.</p>
               <p>I cannot tell what, partly Popery,
partly true Religion mingled toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther.</p>
               <p>They say in my Country when they
call their Hogs to the Swine-trough,
come to thy mingle mangle, compyr,
compyr; even so they made mingle
mangle of it; they could clatter and
prate of the Gospel, but when all com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth
to all,<note place="margin">Note.</note> they joyned Popery so with
<pb n="82" facs="tcp:33738:57"/>
it, that they marred all together.</p>
               <p>We have now a first Visitation in
<hi>England;</hi> let us beware of a second.
We have the Ministration of his word,
we are yet well; but the House is not
clean swept yet.<note place="margin">Note.</note> God hath sent us a
Noble King in this his Visitation, let
us beware, let us not be unthankful and
unkind, let us beware of by-walking
and contemning of Gods Word.—</p>

               <p>I Remember well what St. <hi>Paul</hi> saith
to a Bishop, and though he spake it
to <hi>Timothy</hi> being a Bishop, yet I may
say it now to the Magistrates,<note place="margin">1 Tim. 5.</note> for all is
one case, all is one matter; <hi>Thou shalt
not be partaker of other mens faults,</hi> be
not hasty in making of Curates, in re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiving

either cannot, or will not do their duty;
do it not. Now me thinks it needs not
<pb n="83" facs="tcp:33738:57"/>
to be partakers of other mens sins, we
shall find enough of our own. And
what is it to be partaker of other mens
sins, if this be not, to make unpreach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
Prelacy, and to suffer them in their
unpreaching Prelacy?</p>
               <p>If the King and his Council should
suffer evil Judges to take Bribes, and
suffer the great to overgo the poor, and
should look through his fingers, to wink
at it, should not the King be partaker
of their naughtiness? And Why, is be
not Supreme Head of the Church?
What ! Is the Supreme a Dignity,
and nothing else? Is it not countable?
I think it will be a chargeable Dignity,
when account shall be askt of it.</p>
               <p>Oh! what advantage hath the Devil?

one of the Company brought this Sen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tence,
<hi>Nil melius quam laetari &amp; facere

marres all, I would <hi>bene</hi> were out, quoth
the merry Monk, for it importeth ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny

               <p>Indeed it were better for them if it
were out; and it were as good to be
out, as to be ordered as it is: it will
be a heavy <hi>bene</hi> for some of them, when

Are not they worthy double honour?
Is it not an honourable Order they
be in?</p>
               <p>Nay an horrible misorder, it is an
horrour, rather than an honour, and
horrible, rather than honourable, if
the Preacher be naught, and do not his

to wrestle for honour, that the Devil
may take his Pleasure.—</p>
               <p>Are they not worthy double honour?
Nay rather, double dishonour, not to

               <p>As for my <hi>Quondamship,</hi> I thank

their duty,<note place="margin">Note.</note> I would have no more <hi>quon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dams</hi>
as God help me. I owe them no
more malice than this, and that is none
at all.</p>
               <p>This Bishop answered his Chaplain,
VVell saies he, well, did I wisely to
day, for as I was going to the Sermon,
I remembred that I had neither said
<hi>Mass</hi> nor <hi>Mattins,</hi> and homeward I gat
as fast as I could, and I thank God, I
have said both, and let his unfruitful
Sermon alone.</p>
               <p>Unfruitful, saith one, another saith
seditious: VVell, Unfruitful is the best,
and whether it be unfruitful or no, I
cannot tell, it lieth not in me to make
it fruitful; and God work not in your
hearts,<note place="margin">Note.</note> my preaching can do you but
little good.</p>
               <p>I am Gods instrument but for a time,
it is he must give increase, and yet
preaching is necessary: For, take away
Preaching, and take away Salvation.—</p>
               <p>Christ is the Preacher of all Preach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers.—</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="88" facs="tcp:33738:60"/>
As wisely, as circumspectly, as he
preached, yet the Fourth Ground only
was fruitful; and if he had no better
Luck, that was Preacher of all Preach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers;
what shall we look for? yet there
was no lack in him, but the Ground.
And so now there is no fault in Preach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing,
the lack is in the People, who
have stony and thorny hearts. I beseech
God to amend them.</p>
               <p>And as for these Folk that speak a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainst
me, I never look to have their
good word so long as I live: yet I will
speak of their wickedness as long as I
shall be permitted to speak,<note place="margin">Note.</note> as long as
I live, I will be an enemy to it, no
Preachers can pass it over with silence.
It is the Original root of all mischief.</p>
               <p>As for me, I owe them no other ill
will, but I pray God amend when it
pleaseth him.—</p>
               <p>Oh that a man might have the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>templation
of Hell, that the Devil
would allow a man to look into Hell,
to see the estate of it, as he shewed all
the world, when he tempted Christ.—</p>
               <p>If one were admitted to view Hell,
and behold it throughly, the Devil
would say,</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="89" facs="tcp:33738:60"/>
On yonder side are punished Un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preaching
Prelates, I think a man
should see as far as a Kenning, and see
nothing but Unpreaching Prelates, he
might look as far as <hi>Calice,</hi> I warrant
you.</p>
               <p>And then if he would go on the other
side, and shew where Bribing Judges
are, I think he should see so many, that
there were scant room for any other:
Our Lord God amend it.</p>

                  <note place="margin">Note,</note> the right way to Hell, to be

               <p>If a Judge would ask me the way to

First, let him be a covetous man, let
his heart be poisoned with covetous<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness;

judgment. Lo, here is the Mother,

Messe; which (so God help me) if I
were Judge should be <hi>Hangum Tunum,</hi>
a Tiburn Tippet to take with him, and
it were the Judge of the Kings Bench,
my Lord chief Judge of <hi>England;</hi> yea,
and it were my Lord Chancellor him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>self,

               <p>And is it so, trow ye? are civil
Offices bought for money? Lord God!
who should have thought that?—</p>
               <p>God fore-fend that ever any such
enormity should be in <hi>England,</hi> that
civil Offices should be bought.—</p>
               <p>And if ye be a selling civil Offices,
ye are as they which fell their benefices,

               </p>
               <p>I marvel the ground gapes not, and
devours us. Surely, it is the great le<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mity
<pb n="92" facs="tcp:33738:62"/>
of God that suffers it. O Lord,
in what case are we.—</p>
               <p>There was a Patron in <hi>England,</hi> that
had a benefice faln into his hand, and a
good Brother of mine came to him, and
brought him thirty Apples in a dish,
and gave them to his man to carry them
to his Master; it is like he gave one to
his Man for his labour, to make up the
game, and so there was thirty one.
This Man cometh to his Master, and
presented him with the dish of Apples,
saying; Sir such a man hath sent you a
dish of fruit, and desireth you to be
good unto him for such a benefice.
Tush, tush, quoth he, this is no App<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>le
matter, I will none of his Apples.
I have as good as these (or as he hath
any) in my own Orchard.</p>
               <p>The Man came to the Priest again,
and told him what his Master said:
Then quoth the Priest, desire him yet
to prove one of them for my sake, he
shall find them much better then they
look for. He cut one of them and
found ten pieces of gold in it. Marry,

               <p>I Intend this day to intreat of a
piece of Scripture, out of the first
Chapter of <hi>Luke v.</hi> 1. 2, 3, &amp;c.</p>
               <p>I am occasioned to take this place
by a Book sent to the Kings Majesty
that dead is, by Master <hi>Pool.</hi> It is a
Text that he doth greatly abuse for the
Supremacy, he racks it, and violents
it to serve for the maintenance of the
Bishop of <hi>Rome.</hi>—</p>
               <p>The Text saith, the people pressed
upon him; so that Christ was in peril
<pb n="94" facs="tcp:33738:63"/>
to be thrust into the Pond. A won<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derous
thing, what a desire the people
had to hear our Saviour preach.—</p>
               <p>VVhere read you that a great num<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber
of Scribes and Pharisees, and Bi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>shops
followed him.</p>
               <p>There is a Doctor that writeth of
this place, his name is Dr. <hi>Gorrham,
Nicholas Gorrham:</hi> I knew him to be
a School Doctor a great while ago:
but I never knew him to be an inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preter
of Scripture, till of late; he saith
thus:</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Major devotio in laicis &amp; vetulis
quam in clericis.</hi> There is more devo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion,
saith he, in lay folk and old
wives, and in these simple and vulgar
people, then in the Clarks: they be
better affected to the Word of God,
then the Clergie. I marvel not at the
Sentence; but I marvel at such a Sen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tence
in such a Doctor. If I should
say so much, it would be said to me, it
is an evil Bird that defiles his own
nest.—</p>
               <p>Our Saviour had said, <hi>Luke</hi> 4. 43.
That he must preach the Kingdom of
God to other Cities also; For there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
am I sent,—</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="95" facs="tcp:33738:63"/>
Is it not a marvellous thing that our
unpreaching Prelates can read this
place, and yet preach no more then
they do? I marvel that they can go
quietly to bed, and see how he allu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reth
them by his example, to be dili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gent
in their Office.—</p>
               <p>The preaching of the Gospel, is the
power of God to salvation, to every
one that Believeth, <hi>Rom.</hi> 1. 15, 16.
Beware,<note place="margin">Note.</note> beware ye diminish not this
Office, for if ye do, ye decay Gods
Power.</p>
               <p>Christ saith, <hi>Jo.</hi> 3. 3. Except a man
be born again.—</p>
               <p>What is this Regeneration? it is
not to be Christned in water (as these
fire brands expound it) and nothing
else.</p>
               <p>How is it to be expounded then?
Saint <hi>Peter</hi> sheweth, 1 <hi>Pet.</hi> 1. 23, 24,
25. It is the circumstance, and colla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
of places that make Scriptures
plain. We are born saith he, not of
corruptible Seed, but of incorruptible,
by the Word of God.—</p>
               <p>By the Word of God, by the Word
of God preached and opened.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="96" facs="tcp:33738:64"/>
Thus cometh in our new birth.</p>
               <p>Here you may see how necessary this
Office is to our Salvation.</p>
               <p>This is the thing that the Devil
wrastleth most against: It hath been all
his study to decay this Office; he
worketh against it as much as he can,
he hath prevail'd too much, too much
in it.</p>
               <p>He hath set up a state of unpreaching
Prelacy in this Realm this seven hun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dred
years, a stately unpreaching Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lacy,
he hath made unpreaching Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lates.</p>
               <p>He hath stirred up heaps to persecute
this Office in the title of Heresie: he
hath stirred up the Magistrates to per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>secute
it in the title of sedition.<note place="margin">Note.</note> And
he hath stirred up the people to perse<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cute
it, with exprobrations and slan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derous
words—</p>
               <p>And with <hi>Impropriations</hi> he hath
turned preaching into <hi>private Masses;</hi>
if a Priest should have left Masse un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>done
on a Sunday within this ten years,<note place="margin">Note.</note>
all <hi>England</hi> would have wondred at it;
but they might have left off the Sermon
twenty Sundaies and never have been
<pb n="97" facs="tcp:33738:64"/>
blamed. And thus by these <hi>Impropri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ations</hi>
private Masses were set up, and
preaching of Gods word trodden under
foot. But what doth he now? he stirs
men up to outragious rearing of rents,
that poor men shall not be able to find
their children at the School to be Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vines.
What an unreasonable devil is
this? he provides a great while before
hand, for the time that is to come.</p>
               <p>He hath brought up now a most
monstrous kind of covetousness that
ever was heard of; he hath invented a
Fee-farming of Benefices,<note place="margin">Note.</note> and all to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cay
this Office of Preaching; insomuch
that when a man shall hereafter have a
Benefice, he may go where he will, for
any house he shall have to dwell upon,
or any Glebe-land to keep hospitality
withall; but he must take up a cham<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber
in an Ale-house, and there sit and
play at Tables all day. A goodly Curate.
He hath caused also Patrons to sell
their Benefices. Yea, what doth he
more? He gets him to the University
and causeth great men to send their
sons thither, and put out poor Schollers
that should be Divines: for their pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rents
<pb n="98" facs="tcp:33738:65"/>
intend not they shall be Prea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chers:
but that they may have a shew
of learning.</p>
               <p>But it were too long to declare unto
you, what deceit and means the Devil
hath found to decay the office of salva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion.—</p>
               <p>It is in the Text he taught sitting; Prea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chers
be-like were sitters in those dayes,<note place="margin">Math. 23.</note>
as it is in another place, they sit in
<hi>Moses</hi> Chair.</p>
               <p>I would our Preachers would Preach
sitting or standing one way or other.</p>
               <p>It was a goodly Pulpit that our Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viour
Christ had gotten him here, an
old rotten Boat. And yet he prea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ched
his Fathers will, his Fathers
message out of this Pulpit. He cared
not for the Pulpit, so he might do the
people good.</p>
               <p>Indeed it is to be commended;<note place="margin">Note.</note> for
the Preacher to stand or sit as the place
is, but I would not have it so supersti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiously
esteemed, but that a good Prea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cher
may declare the VVord of God
sitting on a Horse, or preaching in a
Tree.</p>
               <p>And yet and this should be done, the
<pb n="99" facs="tcp:33738:65"/>
unpreaching Prelates would laugh it to
scorn.</p>
               <p>And though it be good to have a
Pulpit set up in the Churches, that
the people may resort thither, yet I
would not have it so superstitiously
used, but that in a prophane place the
VVord of God may be preached some<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times.—</p>
               <p>To have Pulpits in Churches it is
very well done to have them, but they
would be occupied, for it is a vain thing
to have them as they stand in many
Churches.</p>
               <p>I heard of a Bishop of <hi>England</hi> that
went on visitation (and as it was the
custome) when the Bishop should come
and be rung into the Town, the great
Bells clapper was faln down, the ty-all
was broken, so that the Bishop could
not be rung into the Town. There
was a great matter made of this, and
the chief of the Parrish were much bla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med
for it, in the visitation. The Bi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>shop
was somewhat quick with them,
and signified that he was much offend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed.
They made their answers, and ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cused
themselves as well as they could,
<pb n="100" facs="tcp:33738:66"/>
it was a chance said they, that the clap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per
brake, and we could not get it men<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded
by and by, we must tarry till we
can have it done it shall be mended as
shortly as may be.</p>
               <p>Among the other there was one wi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ser
then the rest, and he comes to the
Bishop. Why (my Lord) saith he,
doth your Lordship make so great a
matter of the Bell that lacketh his clap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per;
here is a Bell (saith he) pointing
to the Pulpit, that hath lacked a clapper
this twenty years. We have a Parson
that fetcheth out of this benefice fifty
pound every year, but we never see
him.</p>
               <p>I warrant you the Bishop was an un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preaching
Prelate, he could find fault
with a Bell that wanted a clapper to
ring him into the Town; but he could
not find any fault with the Parson that
preached not at his Benefice.</p>
               <p>Ever this Office of preaching hath
been least regarded, it hath scant had
the name of Gods service. They must
sing <hi>Salve festa dies</hi> about the Church,
that no man was the better for it, but
to shew their gay coats and garments.</p>
               <p>

on a journey homeward from <hi>Lon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>don,</hi>

in the morning, because it was Holy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>day;
and me thought it was a Holy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dayes
worke, the Church stood in my
way. And I took my Horse and my
Company and went thither, (I thought
I should have found a great Company
in the Church) and when I came there,
the Church door was fast locked, I tar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ried
there half an hour and more; at the
last the Key was found, and one of the
Parish comes to me, and sayes; Sir,
this is a busie day with us, we cannot
hear you, it is <hi>Robin-hoods</hi> day. The
Parish are gone abroad to gather for
<hi>Robin-hood.</hi> I pray you let them not.
I was fain there to give place to <hi>Robin-hood.</hi>
I thought my Rochet should have
been regarded, though I were not, but
it would not serve, it was fain to give
place to <hi>Robin-hoods</hi> men.</p>
               <p>It is no laughing matter,<note place="margin">Note.</note> my friends,

Unpreaching Prelates. This Realm hath
been ill provided for, rhat it hath had

Bishops had been Preachers, there
should never have been any such thing;
but we have a good hope of better. We
have had a good beginning, I beseech
God to continue it. But I tell you, it
is far wide, that the people have such
judgments: The Bishops they could
