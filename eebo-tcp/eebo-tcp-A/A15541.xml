            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

(righte honora<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble

truly and wysely, that
the worlde is made for
man, and man is made
for god, to thende that
man may haue all plea<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>sure,
and god maye ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ue
all honour. Seinge
then, that such a creacio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> of man, and the world,
is thus framed by the myghtie finger of god, &amp;
man especially made for god: I doubte not, but
your honor beinge goddes liuely image vppon
earth, and fashioned to hys lykenes, concerning
the reasonable soule, as all others suche hys
creatures are: will remember for your parte, to
<pb facs="tcp:20795:3"/>
forsee and to doe your dutie from tyme, to time,
and indeuour youreselfe in all your actions to
haue god alwayes before your eyes, and to ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ercyse
your mynde all your lyfe longe, with all
godly practises, aswell in aduauncing religion,
to goddes glorye, as in dooyng Justice for ma<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>s
benefite, that god alone as hee is alwayes pray<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed
in Heauen amongst hys aungels, maye euen
so haue hys holy name onely honored here vpo<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
earth amongst hys people. But because mans
nature, throughe Adames falle, is altered
from that perfection, wherin it was at the first,
and is muche subiecte therfore to great corrup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cion
of lyfe and maners: It is to be feared, that
all men will not alwayes be myndefull of their
dutie, excepte they bee often warned and put in
mynde of that they oughte to doe, wherby they
maye consider still what they are. For by wan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting
the reme<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>brance and exercise of wel dooyng:
they may declyne from god, (a thing sone donne
where god is not feared) and so wallowe in syn<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ne,
the playne effecte of gracelesse people. For y<hi rend="sup">e</hi>
deuill beinge greate aduersarie to all goodnes,
(whom that auncient father of famouse memo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rie
Hughe Latymer, called the moste vigilant
byshop in hys vocation) is neuer ydle, but still
occupied and busie, in sowing cockle and darnel
amongst the good corne and pure wheate of the
lords haruest. So that yf their be not as quicke
wedyng hookes, &amp; as sharpe yron forkes; rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dye
at hande to clense the soyle from tyme to ty<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>me,
as the weedes are, and wilbee readye to
spring vp &amp; growe: in the ende all wilbe wedes,
and antichrist hymselfe will be lorde of the har<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ueste.
This muste I saye, that warenes in all
<pb facs="tcp:20795:3"/>
thinges is euermore very wisdome, &amp; of adui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed
dealynges comes perfection, and thinges
foreseene do always the lesse harme. For which
cause lawes are enacted, not onely to punishe e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uill,
when anye is committed, but also to preue<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t
euill not to bee committed at all, that men being
warned before hand, may take hede the rather,
how to offende lawes for feare of the sworde, &amp;
lyue in good order, to escape the seueritie, and
sharpe rodde of iustice. I doe wishe therefore
that man were as apte to doe righte, as hee is
readie to speake of right, and to be all together,
as he would seme to bee: least otherwise lawes
stand not in vaine, when great occasion geeues
iust cause of speedie redresse. And in thys behalf
magistrates are to be put in remembrance, that
they hauing gouernement and execucion of iu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stice
in their handes, maye bee good ryghters of
all wrong doynges, and iust dispensers of gods
lawe, and mans lawe, both to lowe and hyghe,
to ryche and poore, without any respecte or re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>garde
of parson. For most true it is, that where
iustice is dulie ministred, there is god moste
hyghly honoured, and sweete is that sacrifice to
god, whe<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> the lyues of lewde men are offered vp
to suffer paynes of death for wicked dooynges.
I will not speake to aggrauate execucion for
all mysdeedes, eyther seuerally or generally, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause
I thinke it both nedelesse, and a great fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lie
also, and a thinge almoste impossible for man
to hope by onely demau<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ding, to haue the amen<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>dement
of all thinges preciselye, that presentlye
are amysse: but thys I reache at, that where a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mongst
a no<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ber of gawles and great greefes in
thys common weale, there spredeth one especial
<pb facs="tcp:20795:4"/>
mischiefe as yll, nay woorse than anye plague:
my meaning is to sett all other faultes aparte,
and to disclose this one aboue the rest vnto your
Lordship, that by your honorable meanes and
great aucthoritye, it maye at the leaste bee some
what refourmed, yf not all together ame<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ded or
taken away. I do meane that ouglie, detestable
and hurtefull synne of  vsurie, whiche being but
one i<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> grossenes of name, caries many a mischief
linked vnto it in nature, the same synne beinge
nowe so rancke througout all Englande, not in
London onelye, that men haue all together for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gotten
free lending, and haue geuen themselues
wholye to lyue by fowle gayning, makinge the
lone of monye a kinde of merchandize, a thinge
directlye against all lawe, against nature, and a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainst
god. And what should this meane, that
in steade of charitable dealing, and the vse of al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mose
(for lending is a spice therof) hardenes of
harte hath nowe gotten place, and greedie gay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ne
is cheefelye folowed, and horrible extorcion
commonly vsed. I do verely beleue, the ende of
thys worlde is nyghe at hande. And the more
is thys euill to bee pitied, because men doe lulle
the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>selues with the exercise thereof in such sorte,
as thoughe there were none offense in it at all,
wheras amongst all other offenses next to Ido<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>latrie,
&amp; the renouncing of god, and hys magi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>strates
vpo<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> earth, there is none more heynous,
none more offensiue, and none more hurtfull, to
anye well gouerned common weale. For besi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>des
that the very sinne of vsurie, is expreslie for<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>bidden
by godds worde, aswel as either thefte,
aduowtrie, or whoredome: the countrey and
realme where thys offense is commonlie vsed,
<pb facs="tcp:20795:4"/>
cannot longe continue in prosperous wellfare.
And sorie I am to saye it, but I see it &amp; knowe
it ouerwel, and therefore I must needes saie it:
I do not knowe anye place in christendome, so
muche subiect to thys foule synne of vsurie, as
the whole realme of Englande ys at thys pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sent,
and hathe bene of late yeares. For men of
wealth are nowe wholy geeuen euery wheare
all together to idlenes, to gett their gaine with
case, &amp; to lyue by lending vpon the onely sweate
&amp; labour of others. Wheras god willeth euerye
man to lyue in hys vocation, and hee that will
not laboure eyther w<hi rend="sup">t</hi> body or minde, according
to his callyng rightly, should not eate at al, for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>biddi<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>g
men to make le<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ding a ki<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>de of liui<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>g. But
these men do not liue in any vocation, but being
the diuels knowe<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> apprentices in earth, &amp; bound
to doe, as hee woulde haue them: seeke when
they are dead to serue hym in hell, as I take it.
For god sayeth by hys prophete Dauid,<note place="margin">Psall. 15.</note> that he
shall neuer dwell in hys tabernacle, that hathe
put out hys mony for vsury. And therfore, whe<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ther
should suche men looke to goe, when they
are deade, but straighte to the diuell, seeynge in
earth they serue such a master.</p>
            <p>There bee two sortes of men, that are alwayes
to bee looked vpon very narrowly, the one is
the dissemblinge gospeller, and the other is the
wilfull &amp; indurate papistes. The first vnder co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lour
of religion, ouerthroweth all religion, and
bearing good men in hande, that hee loueth play<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>nesse,
vseth couertelie all deceypte that maye
bee, and for pryuate gayne, vndoeth the co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>mon
welfare of man. And touching thys sinne of v<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>surie,
none doe more openly offende in thys be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>halfe,
<pb facs="tcp:20795:5"/>
then do these counterfeite professours of
thys pure religion. The wilfull Romaniste, as
he professeth an hatred to thys religion, so ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uing
mischiefe boyling within hym, deuiseth by
indirecte meanes to aduaunce his welfare, that
hee maye haue monye in store againste a good
hower, suche as hee loketh for. So that betwixt
the secrete dissembler, and the open blasphemer,
the world is made a praye, and deuided betwixt
them, and god thereby moste hyghely dishono<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red.
Neyther doe either of these people followe
you for youre persone or vertue, but for youre
fortune and aucthority. Cicero sayethe wiselye,
holsome seueritie, doth greatly excede the vayne
shewe of folish pitie. Cleme<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>cie is good, I deny
not, but that is to bee vsed to good men, or else
towardes suche as of whome there is good ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pe
of theire better behauioure hereafter. But
where clemencie is altogether abused, and ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>keth
as it were an open waye to all lowsenes
in maners and carnall libertie of lyfe, there seue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritie
must needes stryke a stroke. For to what
ende are good lawes made, yf there bee no exe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cucio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
of them? As good pyke strawes, as make
lawes that want a magistrate, to see them well
kepte obeyed and fulfilled. For the lawe it selfe,
is a du<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>me magistrate to al men, wheras magis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trates
are a speakynge lawe to all people. And
therefore, as gouernours do submit themselues
to lawe, and lyue thereafter: so will the people
submitte themselues to gouernours and theire
doynges: suche force (lo) hath example of life,
especiallie in magistrates. Neyther are gouer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nours
priuate persons, to lyue honestly to them
selues onelye, but they are publique officers to
<pb facs="tcp:20795:5"/>
do good vnto many, and by wise aduise, to haue
care ouer them, that neyther will, nor can haue
care of themselues. And thys I saye, that like
as one maye bee a good magistrate to the peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple,
and yet no god man to hymselfe: euen so may
one bee a good man to hymselfe, and proue
no good magistrate to the people. And of these
two, lesse harme doth that man, who priuatelye
offendeth in hys lyfe: than hee that publikelye
offendeth in his charge. Nedeful therfore were
it, that all magistrates were good men in theire
offices, because the common welfare dependeth
vppon their wel doyng. And good it were also
neuer to remitte apparante greate faultes vnto
any person in aucthority. For the magistrate a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>busing
hys office, deserueth more punishmente
than doth the priuate personne. For as hee abu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>seth
hys charge, so doth hee deceaue hys trust, &amp;

doth discouer all, and god hath graunted thys
priuylege vnto prynces, that wicked attemp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tes,
shall neuer haue deepe roote. For although
wrong dealings maye be shrowded for a space,
and bee kepte vnder couerte: yet they will oute
at laste, and bee opened with shame, the rather
to set forth gods myghty iustice, and to aduaun<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ce
hys endelesse glorye</p>
            <p>Amongst the Romaynes, there were censo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>res,
appoynted as commissioners, to searche out
the doyngs of such as eyther had borne office, or
were notorious offenders: and finding any such
to bee faultie, they did streighte wayes remoue
<pb facs="tcp:20795:6"/>
them, and punish them with infamie. The same
order is yet vsed in Italie, Spayne, and Por<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tugale,
and good iustice done againste all vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iust
magistrates, and euil lawyers. And thus it
is. Such as ouer hastelye haue rysen to great
welth, haue ben sifted for theire life and doings
by commission, and stripped out of all, when
they were taken in a trippe. Now then, needes
must I saye thus at thys time, that amongst all
sortes of men, sinne aboundeth here for wants
of chastisemente, euill men beinge ouer ryfe, &amp;
good men ouer scante, such as shoulde do good.
Or els how is it, that vsurie amongst other syn<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>nes
(for I will at thys tyme say nothing of ma<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>gistrates)
is so vniuersally vsed, whiche ought
in any wise to be weeded out aboue all other fa<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

               </gap>
               <g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>tes.
For as I thinke, and must saye stil, vsurie
onely, is the cheefest cause of the greatest miserie
in thys lande, aswell to geeue occasion of great
waste, as also to make muche wante, and wil be
in the ende, the vndoynge of all, yf it bee not lo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ked
to in tyme. The Romaynes neuer began to
decaye, till vsurie lorded amongst them, for then
priuate gaine thrust oute common profite, luste
was holden for lawe, ydlenes more vsed then
labour, ryott in steede of diett, vice better regar<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ded
then vertue, no charitye at all, no loue be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>twixt
man and man, but euery man for hymself,
and the whorlepole of pride and ryote ouer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flowed
in all thynges, and in all places.</p>
            <p>Plato saieth, <q>there must bee three thinges in
euerie good state. A magistrate to gouerne,
lawes whereby to gouerne, and execucion of
lawes for maintenaunce of gouernement. And
Diogenes sayed well, where neither lawes
<pb facs="tcp:20795:6"/>
haue force, nor water hath course: there shoulde
no wise man willingly seeke to dwel.</q> For wher
euill men beare rule, (as it is alwayes, there
where lawes are stopped of theire ordinarie
course) there cannot anye good man haue place,
because they are alwayes contrarie. And thys
I saye, that in al common weales, it is as great
a blame not to cherishe &amp; mainteine the good &amp;
godly, as it is a great shame to suffer the offen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dor
&amp; wicked man to goe vnpunished. For both
must haue theire desertes, or else y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> state is not
iustely gouerned. And as weedes are to be roo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted
out of euery gardeine, so are good herbes to
be ofte<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> watred &amp; cherished stil, with good earth
or els they wil perish, and wyther soone away.
And amongest all others, I woulde the reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>giouse
learned men of thys lande, were so cheri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>shed
and esteemed, as they haue well deserued,
and together with theire good cherisinge, I
would theire good warninges were throughly
folowed. Yea I woulde they were better hol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>den
vp, in that which they haue mainteined and
professed in good learnynge: although their li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uings
and entertainements were not made mu<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>che
greater: The preachers I doe meane, &amp; the
godly ministers of this time, for they still ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>claime
maynely against sinne to discharge their
duties, they crie out continually against all vsu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rers
with open mouth, and in all their sermo<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>s,
and yet, what auailes it? nothing at al. The rea<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>son
is, for y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> the ciuil magistrate doth not ioyne
with them, and see that executed by censures of
the lawe, whiche they so earnestly rebuke in the
pulpite, and shewe foorth godds threates most
vehemently, for suche synnes so muche suffered,
<pb facs="tcp:20795:7"/>
and so lyttle punished. For what sayeth the lew<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>de
man, when the good preacher hath donne?
See howe properlye hee gyrdes at the matter,
yonder sellie man (sayeth hee) hath saide, but he
can do no more, thankes be to god. And fond is
y<hi rend="sup">•</hi> man, sayeth y<hi rend="sup">•</hi> vsurer to others, whatsoeuer
hee bee, that will not suffer a poore simple prea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cher
to haue his wordes, when others haue the
deedes, and lyue in all wealth and iolytye in
thys world. Lorde god send to Englande some
<hi>Solon,</hi> for thys redresse, who toke away the vsu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rers
bookes and their gaynes from them, &amp; for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>badde
such filthy lucre, &amp; brought in <hi>nouas tabulas,</hi>
whiche are sayde in greeke to bee <hi>Seiuachtheia,</hi>

               </note> as
who should say, an easement of a burdeine. For
that all debtours were discharged from all such
creditours that had lent theire money for vsury
and gayne, or at the least wise, were eased from
the vsurie of it. Thus did <hi>Solon</hi> in the detestacion
of vsury, a sharpe kynde of dealynge no doubte,
and a straunge: but in great diseases, sharpe cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rysiues
muste needes bee vsed, when lenitiues
will not serue. And shall I name one, that hath
bene in oure age, and wishe hym now a lyue, to
cure so great a cancre? Woulde god Englande
had a Cromwell, I will saye no more. I doe
reade, that long before the conquest, king <hi>Edgare,</hi>
that iuste gouernoure and seuere magistrate a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gaynste
all lewde officers and extorcioners in
thys lande, did amongst hys other good deedes
make proclamacion to haue al the wolfes killed
in Englande and Wales, because they were ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uenouse
beastes, and deuourers of sheepe and
other cattell, to the great harme and hynderaun<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ce
of hys subiectes. And to haue thys the better
<pb facs="tcp:20795:7"/>
done, hee appoynted manye to paye for theire fi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nes
and reuenues, wolfes heades yerelye: some
moe, and some lesse, and such as could not bring
wolfes heades in, payed theire fines and reue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nues
in mony. Now suche force toke thys good
order in this lande, that within a while, there
was not a wolfe to be had, neyther in Engla<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>d<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
nor yet in wales. And <hi>Laudvvallus</hi> prince of Wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>les
brought in 300. wolfes heades in one yeare
for hys tribute, which hee was bounde to pays
yerely. And afterwardes when no moe wolfes
heades were to bee had, hee payd to the kynge a
certayne yerely reuenue. Thys was a good dee<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>de
surelie, and a gracious proclamacion: for sin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ce
that tyme, whiche is sixe hundreth and odde
yeres past, no wolfes haue troubled this land.</p>
            <p>Nowe yf youre lordeship, with others could
procure by your good meanes, that in your ty<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>me,
there mighte bee neuer an vsurers heade in
England: I doe thinke you shoulde doe a grea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
good deede to thys lande, then euer was
doone by kyllinge of wolfes. For these bee the
greedie cormoraunte wolfes in deede, that ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uyn
vp both beaste and man, who whyles they
walke in sheepe skynnes, doe couertlye deuow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>re
the flocke of England, vnder coloure of their
wealth &amp; counterfeit honesty. And what if there
were therefore a lawe to searche out these hypo<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>crites,
and to vnuisar these maskinge minyons,
and suche as they bee, that make warre of sett
purpose against god and hys lawes, that stryue
so maynelye againste hys holye will and com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maundementes.
And the same lawe to be so exe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cuted,
that as wolfes haue bene ridd out of thys
lande, they shoulde all likewise either suffer the
<pb facs="tcp:20795:8"/>
paynes of death, or be banished thys realme for
euer, that there myght herafter no moe vsurers
bee found in Englande, than are wolfes to bee
had here at thys daye? I do thinke surely, this
woulde bee as swete a smelling sacrifice in the
sight of god, as euer was offered since Engla<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>d
was firste conuerted to the faithe. Kynge <hi>Dauid</hi>
praiyng god to sende vnto his sonne <hi>Salomon</hi> iud<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gement
and righteousnes, saieth that hys sonne
being assisted by the myghty power of god, shal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bee
honored of all princes vpon earthe, because
hee should deliuer the people fro<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> vsury. A great
good deede no doubt, and worthy of such great
honor as <hi>Salomon</hi> afterwardes enioied, and a ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rie
meete example for al princes to followe, that
they mighte haue like honor. And touchinge
a lawe to bee made, I doe not see, but it is as
necessary to haue one against vsurers as against
theues, and a great deale more. For theues stea<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>le
manye tymes for necessitie, wheras vsurers
robbe and vndoe all men, for greedy gluttonye.
The one stealeth a crowne in the hyghe waye,
the other robbeth men in the hyghe streate, of al
that they haue: the one stealeth a little, to sustey<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ne
nature: the other scratcheth vp the whole
treasure of England, to serue hys owne coue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tous
and wretched desire, to the vtter vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>doynge
of thousandes. Therfore it were good,
these vsurers were all gone one waye or other,
out of thys realme, for here in Englande they
do no good at al, nay, they doe all the myschiefe
that is donne, and wilbe the cause of vtter ruine
to thys lande, yf they bee not taken vpp in time,
and cutt shorter by the heades. Good men ther<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
must haue this care to sifte out lewde men,
<pb facs="tcp:20795:8"/>
and till gouernours geue good example of good
lyfe, euill men will co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>tinue to be euill stil. But if
this lawe seeme blodie, although the hanging of
poore wretches for small matters, is counted
nothing blodie at all: then woulde I, that the
olde lawes of England were put in execucion,
such as are called kyng Edwards lawes, or the
common lawes of England, whereof one was,
that the goodes of an vsurer after hys decease,
should turne to the benefite of the prince, when
twelue men had founde by proofe, that the par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie
deceased was an vsurer in his lyfe time. For
in those dayes, no enquiry was made by verdict
so long as a man lyued, whether he was an vsu<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>rer
or no: but y<hi rend="sup">•</hi> matter was referred wholly to
y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> ecclesiasticall lawes during me<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>s lyues. This
I thinke would make the fewer vsurers, when
twelue men shoulde bee triers after their de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceases
what trade they vsed in theire lyfe, and
finding them by profe to haue committed vsury
(whiche as <hi>Glanuil</hi> sayeth,<note place="margin">Glann. l<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

to geeue vp straight wayes the dead mans
goodes from hys heyres, executours and assig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nes,
to the prince and gouernour of the lande.
But some will saye, yf the lawes were put in
execucion, it would turne to the hurte of all me<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>,
for that none would lend hereafter to anye bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>die,
eyther more or lesse, and nede there wilbee
alwayes, as there hathe been heretofore. I do
aunswere, and saye, that the hungry desyre of
man, dothe enforce neede manye tymes further,
then there is cause of neede in deede, seekynge
for a great deale more in all thinges, than natu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>re
craueth. To whose sufficience, if mans gredy
<pb facs="tcp:20795:9"/>
appetite, could aunswere, and yelde themselues
content, with the blessed frute of this lyttle pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>radise
of Englande, one man shoulde haue little
cause to borrowe of an other. Or if they had can
se (as I cannot deny but neede may bee, &amp; that
great neede sometymes,) yet yf men were en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vred<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
with the feare of god, and acquaynted to
lende freely, and to doe to others, as they would
that others should doe to them: I woulde not
doubte, but that charitie would abound vniuer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sallye,
and the moste would bee as loth to lende
for gayne, as theye would bee loth to kill, or to
murder a man by the hyghe waye side. And I
truste also that men woulde then as fast runne
from a knowne vsurer, as they would flie nowe
from a madde dogge, or rather from the diuell
hymselfe, if they sawe hym in hys likenes. But
what doe these worldlings now a dayes? They
doo not lende to helpe the neede of others, but
to benefite themselues, and wher they finde the
greatest vnthrifte, that hath landes, or other ly<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uinges
lefte vnto hym: there they wilbe moste
redie, to feede hym in hys ryott and vimecessa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rie
expences, makynge theire gayne to bee hys
chiefest hurte, yea a greater hurte in deede, then
all hys wilfull and folish charges otherwise, as
maye well appeare in the discourse of thys my
deuised booke. Wheras they that feare god, and
wil bee suche men in deede, as they would seme
to be, should not deale in thys sorte, but follow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
theire trade, in what vocation soeuer it be,
oughte to helpe the needie and worthie parson,
with some parte of those goodes, that they ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ue
lawfullie gotten by theire trade and maner
of liuyng, whereby they maye receiue vsurie at
<pb facs="tcp:20795:9"/>
godds handes, who dothe geue an hundred for
one, to all them that geue or lend frely for hys
sake. Thus I haue boldlye, and I trust with
godds spirite moued your honor to loke well
to your charge and calling, desiring you to take
in good parte my good meaninge, for my desire
is, that my naturall countrey, might bee parfite
and blessed, without daunger of euill, or infec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
of mischefe, to corrupt this state, or destroy
thys noble land. And the boulder I am to deale
thus with your honor before others, because I
haue knowne you, and that noble race of youre
brethren, euen from theire yonge yeares. And
with your honor, and that famous erle of War<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wike
deceased, and your noble brother, nowe
earle of Warwike lyuinge, I haue had more
familier conference, then with the rest: and espe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cially
with your honor (I doe thanke you most
humblie therefore) I haue had sufficient proofe
of youre carefull mynde, euen in reading not o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nely
of the latyn, but also of the Italian good &amp;
and sounde wryters, to knowe and to vnder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stande
the best vsed gouernement, and the chefe
lawes that haue ben made in all ages. And as
youre mynde hath bene thus godly enclyned to
knowe, so it appeareth very wel, you haue euer
had a good mynde, to put youre knowledge in
practise. And this must I saye, that godds pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uidence
is greatly shewed in thys behalfe, and
the queenes maiesties blessed estate most euide<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ly
appeareth to bee the stronger, in that it hathe
pleased her hyghnes, to haue chosen so stayed &amp;
so discrete a noble man, as you are, to deale in
the affaires of the state. For I knowe, and
therfore wil not feare to saye, that you haue ben
<pb facs="tcp:20795:10"/>
next to the Queenes maiesties most mylde and
gracious disposition, a great helpe and meane
of thys most calme and mercifull gouernement,
a thing so ioyfull to all good people as nothinge
can be more: although it hath playnely falle<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> out
in profe, that both the Queenes mercie &amp; your
nature hath ben greatly abused, and the princes
goodnes especially moste vnthankfully recom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pensed.
Whereupon her maiestie hath ben enfor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ced
much against her nature, to vse the sworde,
a thinge so needefull when gentle meanes wil
not serue, that without so doing no state coulde
stande, nor man could lyue. And such hath thys
world ben, is, and wilbee euer, that princes vpo<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
cause must doe, &amp; in reason are bound to do that
whiche they would not of themselues doe, yf it
were not for very necessity, to auoyde a greater
inconuenience. And therefore are counsellours
about a prince, that they might alwayes geeue
the best counsel, and procure thereby the safety
both of prince and state, that when clemencie
will not serue, they maye vse the contrary. But
amongst all other needefull aduertisements, I
do wishe that your honor and others of youre
callinge shoulde neuer at any tyme lett slippe a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nye
good occasio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> offerd for the welfare of Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lande,
muche lesse to bee carelesse in that greate
trust, which is committed vnto you. And ther<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
as the master of a shippe, hath euer an eye
to keepe a righte course, a phisicion alwayes a
good mynde to heale hys paciente, a capitayne
euermore a carefull heade, to gette the victory:
euen so my good lord, I pray god you may be a
faythfull counsellour to the prince, and a wat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chefull
magistrate to the people, to the aduaun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cement
<pb facs="tcp:20795:10"/>
of godds moste holy worde, and for the
welfare of thys lande. And so to care for the
whole bodie of the state, that whilest you take
the defense of some one parte, you do not leaue
other partes of the state vndefended or smallye
estemed. Thus yf you doe, as I pray god you
maye doe, and I hope in god, you will do no
lesse: I do well assure my selfe, that vsurie a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mongest
other faultes will no more shewe her
face hereafter in Englande, than the starynge
Owle, will loke vpon the bright sunne, or the
fearefull mouse, abyde the wilie catte. And I
hope, that by such good meanes, thys noble real
me will greatly florishe, and the people will be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come
euery daye better and better: and in might
waxe stronge: in riches, plentiful: in renow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ne,
famous: in vertue, honest, and in religion
zelous. All whiche blessed and happy welfare,
god graunte for hys sonnes sake Jesus Christ,
in whom your honor, &amp; al others do lyue, moue,
and haue a being, whose name bee therefore
praysed for euer. Amen. From the
Queenes maiesties hospital at

haue you to doe, to wrastle thus with vsurye?
what will you geat by it, not a peny the more
wilbe lent you for making any suche booke,
be you wel assured: nay, you shall the rather
want, when you would haue, trust vnto it vp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on

iumped withal by some men, for dealinge in
this sorte with matters of vsurye. Well I am
sorie to offende any, and surelye my mynde is
to do good vnto al. For I protest before god I do
<pb facs="tcp:20795:11"/>
not mean euill to any man, but wish the best I
ca<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, to one &amp; other. And sorie I am, that good
meanyng &amp; wel, should be hurtfull to me, or
offensiue to any body else. And yet such is the
worlde, the galde horse will not be rubde: men
that are most faulty, can least abide rebukes,
and plain men for telling trueth, many times
beshrewe them selues, being wel assured, that
it is as certayn a thing, as it is a common say<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing,
<hi>Veritas odium parit,</hi> Trueth purchaseth
hatred. I knowe in deede that playnenesse of
speache, and freedome of tongue, in decyphe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ryng
sinne, and aduancing vertue, are not the
best waies to thriue by, for it is not rare, that
many a man hath com to great wealth, which
neuer knew what vertue nor honesty me<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t in al

vowed, neuer to be of that religion, that smel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leth

Alexa<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>der, then poore with Christ. A horri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble
kind of speache, fyrst money say they, and
then honestie will follow of course: for what is
wisedome, learnynge or honestie? It is money
(man) say they, that makes a man to be taken
for wise, honest, valiant, mightie, yea, and for
a kinges fellowe too. This opynion haue many
<pb facs="tcp:20795:12"/>
men, and I feare it be the creede of the worlde

and shall not bee worth a grote here af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter,
yf wicked mammon or mans malyce bee
euer of power to keepe me vnder. And then
had it not ben a great deale better for mee, to
haue played and done nothinge, then thus to
take paynes, and lose al thinges? Well, of thys
one thinge I am wel assured, that god will not
forsake them, that put their trust in hym, but
wyll rewarde them more largelye then mans
wil is to geue or his power to get. And I hope
better of their courtesies, then to haue such dis<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>curtesy

he that wil do as I haue sayd, he shalbe richer
tha<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> the proudest of the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> al. And let the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> not saye
that I am suche an enemye to vsurie that I
will haue none at all to bee vsed. For I am an
vsurer my selfe so farre forthe as I am able, I
woulde they knew it, and I will teache others
to be greater vsurers then I am my selfe, and
shewe them how to gaine more in a daye, then
others are able to geat in seuen yeres. Do ther<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
O ye men of this worlde, as I shall teache
you, and you shallbee suche men, as hereafter
you wil blesse me. Le<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>d to your poore neighbors
<pb facs="tcp:20795:12"/>
in time of their great neede, for gaine on gods
name, and put out your money to them for v<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>surie,
in suche sorte of vsurye I meane, as god
hathe commaunded you to vse, and you shall
yerely, daylie, and howerly reape infinit gain.
For as god is better able to rewarde you then
man: so will he for his promise sake, make you
recompe<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ce with encrease infinytely. And as he
saieth, if you geue but a draught of water in
his name, and for his sake, you shall not lose
your reward. The iust man is ful of compassi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on,
as the Prophet Dauyd sayethe, and dothe
lend. Be you therefore iust men, O ye world<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>linges,
and let others haue that to occupye,
which lyeth idle by you, and lend freely, not
hopinge somuche as for the principall agayne,
that you may heape gayn to your selues, from
god plentifullie. For I tell you, this is a spiri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tual
vsury, which is the right vsurie in dede,
and suche as Christ woulde haue vsed in the
19. chapiter of the gospell after Saint Mathew
where he sayethe. Why wouldest thou not put
out my mony to the banker? that is, why didst
thou not bestowe my grace and my gifts to the
profite of others, by communicating the same
among them? Thus spiritual vsurie is called
<pb facs="tcp:20795:13"/>
the multiplicacion of the giftes, and graces of
god. Thus by a litle trauaile, a man may win
an hundred fold meede in heaue<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>. Who would
not labour in time of haruest to gette in corne?
And what other thi<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>g is this world the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> an har<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>uest
for good me<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, to gleane the poore into their
barnes. And be it, that the party vnto whom
you haue le<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t is poore &amp; not able to repay you,
yet you are sure of this, the partye that borro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wed,
will thanke you, if there be any honesty
in him at all, and wyll desire god to rewarde
and prosper your doings, &amp; god will heare his
prayer that is not hable to paye. And is not
this a good reco<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>pence? But be it that some one
being able to pay, is yet not onely vntha<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>kful
in words, but defraudeth you in dede of your
owne: as you maye haue your remedy against
the man, so assure your selfe that god euen in
such cases will reward you, with his grace &amp;
mercie without any asking or prayer made to
him at al. For it is thus written in the booke of
Iesus of Sirach. <hi>Qui facit misericordiam foe
nerat proximo.</hi> He that vseth pity and com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>passion,
doth lend vpo<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> vsurie to his neighbor,
and god wil pay that vsurie him selfe. And
therefore it is saide farther in that chapiter.
<pb facs="tcp:20795:13"/>
There be many which are not glad for to lend,
not because of euill, but they feare to lose the
thinge that they did lend. Haue thou pacie<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ce
herein O man with the simple (saith the text)
and withholde not mercie from him, helpe the
poore for the commaundements sake, and let
him not go empty from thee because of his ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cessitie.
Leese thy money for thy brother and
neighbours sake, and burye it not vnder a
stone where it rusteth and corrupteth. Gather
thy treasure after the commaundements of the
highest, and so shall it bring thee more profite
then golde. Lay vp thy almes in the hande of
the poore, and it shall keepe thee from al euill.
Thus farre Iesus the sonne of Sirache with a
great deale more, full of muche comfort, for al
those that lende their money out, to receiue v<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>surie
at gods hands. Whiche vsury god grant
all men may vse dayly and howerlye to theire
Christian bretheren: for their rewarde shal be
great in heauen, that for Christes sake lende
freely vnto men vpon earth. Neyther is heare
any losse to him that lendeth in such sorte, but
rather vnspeakable gayne, suche as neyther
hart can thinke, nor tongue can vtter, nor eye
hath seene. If a man in this worlde gayne a
<pb facs="tcp:20795:14"/>
pound for a peny, it is thought a wonder, and
yet god geueth to them, that geue for his sake,
thousandes more then is gayned in thys pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>porcion.
For he geeueth for transitorie trashe,
eternal treasure: for bryttle mettall, assured
welfare: for money, mercie: for golde, al good<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nes:
and for this fraile worlde here, the world
that neuer hath ende hereafter.</p>
            <p>Thus you see, thys vsurye is good and prayse
worthye, suche as will heape more treasure to
man in one moment, then al the golde moun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teth
vnto, that all the Banquers haue in the
wide worlde besides. Happye is he therefore,
that is suche an vsurer, and I praye god al
men maye be suche vsurers hereafter in dede.
For whatsoeuer men lose by thys meanes vp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pon
earthe, they are sure to finde the same a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gaine
in heauen. And what losse I pray you
hathe hee, that when hys debtour faylethe
hym, god receyueth hym? and when the deb<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tour
payethe not, god payethe the debte for
hym? An happye eschaunge no doubte, saye
I, yea and a blessed alteracion. The poore
man is bounde to paye, and god is hys su<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ertie,
and wyll paye the debte hymselfe, yf
<pb facs="tcp:20795:14"/>
the poore man bee decayed, and not able to
aunswere the summe: yea let men bee neuer
so vnthankefull, god wil for his promise sake
paye all mens debtes. And because a manne
maye bee the surer, god layethe in a pawne,
whyche is his heauenly gospel, than the which
no greater nor surer gayne can bee layde oute
for mans behoofe vpon earthe. We see if a man
neede moneye in this worlde, and hath a kno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wen
riche man to bee his suertie, euerye man
is readye to lende for gaine. And is the lorde
of heauen and earthe, he that made the world
and all that therein is, a poore man in your
sight my ryche masters? wyll you not truste
hym, that made you al of nought? that gaue
you freely all that you haue, and wythoute
whom you can haue nothynge? that suffereth
the Sunne to shyne vpon you throughe hys
mercye, that sendethe rayne in due season,
that rulethe the heauens, and the course ther<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of,
for your onelye benefyte? And doubte you
nowe good sirs, that thys lorde of oures, being
lorde of all lordes, is not a sufficyent suertye
to paye vnto you youre owne agayne, and to
recompence you to the vttermoste farthynge?
<pb facs="tcp:20795:15"/>
If the seruant shoulde mistrust his iust mas<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ster,
the tenaunt his good landlorde, the sonne
his louing father, it woulde be thought, that
any of these were lewd folke in their so doing.
And shall wee not thinke them most worthye
of blame, that mistruste the goodnes of god,
who is master, lorde, and father ouer all crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures
liuinge, and the onely creator of man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kinde,
by whom all creatures breathe, lyue
and haue their being, and without whom all
flesh is nothing but confusion, shame, and the
verye outcastes of thys wretched worlde?
But now, touching the co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>pany that is to talk
in this treatise, you shall vnderstande gentle
reader, that no man, nor yet any profession or
callinge is especially touched in thys reporte
that I haue to make, but onelye a rehearsall
made of speache that hath passed. Whyche I
thought good for the varietie thereof, and for
the better setting forthe of gods glorye, to com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mit
to writing, and so to the printe, that all
men may see and reade the matter, and ther<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vpon
doe, as god shall geue them grace. Theire
names I haue geuen vnto them in greeke and
Englishe, callinge the preacher, <gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap>
whiche I doe englishe, Ockerfoe, as enemye to
<pb facs="tcp:20795:15"/>
vsury. The merchant I do name, <gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap>
whom I doe tearme, Gromel gayner, and for
shortnes, write him sometime Gromel, calling
him moste by the name of merchaunte. The
Ciuilian, <gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap>, and so aduocate or Ci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uilian.
The Lawyer, because I knowe tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>porall
lawe is whollye against vsurie, asmuch
as the Cannon lawe, or scripture it selfe: I doe
christen him, <gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap>, counting him heare
in deede not muche better then a petye fogger
in lawe, as one that sometimes hath studied a
litle lawe, beeinge yet neuer allowed in anye
Inne of Court or Chauncery for his learninge,
and assuring my selfe that no vtter barrister,
muche lesse any Counsellor in lawe, wyll al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowe
his opinion: callynge hym Lawyer not<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>withstanding,
for modestie sake, because the
other name is odious, and none woulde wyl<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lingly
in dede be tearmed as they are, especi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally
when the name concerneth eyther wyt or
learning. And yet to see the worlde, none are
so readye to defend vsurie as those are, that
haue the least vnderstandinge in any profes<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sion.
And so I am bolde to vse this name pety
fogger, whom for curtesie sake, and for good
manner, I doe call Lawyer, althoughe noe
<pb facs="tcp:20795:16"/>
lawyer in deede, doth or wil allowe of vsury,
but the vnlearned onelye that presume often<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times
to deale in higher matters, then the el<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der
and wiser sorte of men wyllingly doe, or
dare affirme certeinly vpon their knowledge.
God be mercyful vnto vs, &amp; make one and o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
of al professions, good vsurers in the lord,
that we may lend plentyfully and freely, and
trusting in gods goodnes maye receiue reward
at his hande in that daye. And thus til then
fare you wel in Christ Iesu, to whom be al ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nor
praise and glory for euer &amp; euer Amen.</p>

            <sp>
               <speaker>Merchant,</speaker>
               <p>Nay,
yf you bee dysposed to talke, I pray you
pause the matter tyll after dynner, and
then we will spende time, accordinge to
poyntment, for an hower or two in my
gardeyne, where yee shall haue a plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sant
sweete arbour to sitt in, I thanke
my sweete wyfe heare for it. In the
meane season, let vs bee frendly merye,
and vse oure cheere as god hathe sent it,
for in good soothe you are welcome at a
word. I did looke for mo gheastes, and
amongest others, for master doctour of
the Arches, but he had rather bee at hys
ordinarye in the Arches amongest hys
fellowes my masters the doctors there,
then at thys kynde of dyet, howebeit I
thinke hee will not fayle me in the after
noone, for wote ye what master prea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cher,
<pb facs="tcp:20795:21"/>
I haue desired hym of purpose to
come and vse conference with vs, if you
be so conte<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ted.</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>Preacher.</speaker>
               <p>I am well con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tented
syr wyth your appoyntment.
Hereupon the merchant tooke his place
and called hys gheastes vnto hym, and
as merye as a Pye, made them verye
good cheare. And all the dynner tyme
was passed ouer, with none other talke,
but of the good order of the Cytie, and
what an honorable state it was, and
howe chrystendome through, the lyke
cheere was not at an officers boorde, as
y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> lord maiors table caried, for that was
specially the honor of Engla<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>d, al which
speache was soothed almoste by euerye
body, &amp; gloriouslye extolled for that pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sent.
The Lawyer amongest all o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers
at that table, had most talke, as he
that thought himselfe moste woorthye,
for as hee had a good readye wytte, so
wanted hee neyther boldnes, nor vtte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rance
to set it foorthe, as commonlye la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wyers
haue plenty of bothe. The Prea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cher
hauing his head hammeryng vpon
another steethy, vsed seldom any speach
<pb n="3" facs="tcp:20795:21"/>
but lifting his eies often to heauen, see<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med
to sitt in some mislykinge wyth the
world, as I take it. Notwythstanding,
hee was remembred by the merchaunt,
master Lawier, and others to be merye
as they were. When dynner was done,
the Lawyer forgate not to put the mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chant
in minde of hys gardeyne &amp; faire
arbour, who commaunded his kinsman
&amp; apprentise to prouide cushyns, and to
make all thinges ready. And so the rest
of the gheastes being curteously dispac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ched,
they three wyth one or two others
of the house being there, and the appren<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>tise
standynge by, after the merchaunt
had saide somewhat of hys comelye ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bour
and gardeine, and they also allo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wed
verye well the beautye of it, the
Preacher, domping in a deepe concept,
as one caried with the zeale of god, and
beynge asked what hee thought of the
worlde, began in thys maner.</p>

               <p>No, not weary of the world, but

after a sorte somewhere, but yet I saye,
we are not cleare from other faults that
are greate and horrible ynough, and I
thinke the lyke not vsed in other coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>treys.
This must I say of other natyo<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>s,
they are more vnwillinge to offende in
those thinges that hurte a comon weale
then we are. As, looke what generallye
is noysome to the state, noe man wyll
seeke to geat by lycence, nor otherwyse
by dealynge agaynst the common wel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fare,
because they preferre the wealth of

yea positiue laws and statutes
are better obeyed abroade in all states,

example in following y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> lawes, of theire
countreye, and lesse offende the state,
then our great men and gouernours in

co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>monly will rather sterue then steale,
and here in England, he that can robbe

felowe. Againe, they doe lesse oppresse
theire neyghbours elswhere, theye are
more temperate in their speache, &amp; more

And, y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> which greeueth me most in thys

and I cannot excuse Englande, but yet
I will not so accuse my countreye, that
I will make it altogeter woorse then o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers.
The Flemynges and hyghe Al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maines
are subiect most to dronkennes,
the Italyan to reuenge wronges by
murder, and otherwyse to synne horri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bly
in suche sorte, as is not to be named,
although that same haynous filthynesse
is not onelye vsed there. The Frenche

man, with glottony, in stede of hospita<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>litie,
with much theft to sette foorth his
brauerie, and sometimes treason for de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sire

               <p>My desire is, y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> England might
be most perfect and without any faulte,
if it were possible, &amp; would Christe there
were none other fault in England then
gluttony in the moste, thefte in manye
meane men, and treason in some greate
folke. But I saye there wanteth chary<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie,
without which, there cannot be per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fection
in anye man: for lette there bee
neuer so greate appearaunce of vertue
<pb n="9" facs="tcp:20795:27"/>
otherwise, in whom soeuer charitie ys
wanting, there cannot be any vertue at
all, and therfore saint Paule saith. <hi>Valct
fides in Christo,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Galath. 5.</note> 
                  <hi>quae per charitate<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> operatur,</hi>
That faith in Christ is of force that wor<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>keth
by charitie, as who shoulde saye,
where charitie wanteth, fayth is of no
value, let men bragge and talke neuer
so muche of their beliefe. For as saynt
Paule sayth, likewise in an other place.
Though I speake wyth the tongues of
men and angels and yet haue no loue,<note place="margin">1. Corinth. 13.</note>
I am euen as a sounding brasse, or as a
tyncling cymball, and though I coulde
prophesy, and vnderstande all secretes,
&amp; all knowledge, yea if I had all fayth,
so that I coulde moue mountaynes out
of their places, and yet had no loue, I
were nothing. And though I bestowed
all my goodes to feede the poore, and
though I gaue my bodye euen that I
burned, and yet had no loue, it woulde
profit me nothing. Loue suffereth long,
and is curteous, loue enuyeth not, loue
doth not frowardly, swelleth not, dea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leth

but reioyseth in the truth, suffereth all

that prophesyeng fayle, eyther tongues
shall sease, or knowledge vanish away,
yet loue fayleth neuer.</p>

that you shake the bloode of some, tyll

althoughe I knowe howe to geate a

and to keepe it also. But I praye god,
if your tale bee longe, that I fall not a

hoate, and it is in the afternoone, in
whyche tyme my pastyme is to nodde a
lyttle, yf frendes or other busynes let
mee not, for the phisician telleth me, it
doth mee good, so I doe not sleepe too
muche, but take a nappe. And to tell
you truthe, I doe loue a dyshe of good
meate well. And wee merchauntes
must fare well by order, because yt is
the honour of the Citie, especiallye yf
wee beare offyce, and truely good meat
ys well bestowed on mee, for I furnysh
wyth it, I haue <hi>Corpus cum causa,</hi> as
you may see, stuffe and lyning it is that
<pb facs="tcp:20795:32"/>

wherefore makinge no conscyence of

aduenture it all in merchaundizes be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>yonde

eyther by shipwracke, or by Pirates, or
by euill factours, that all will come to
nought. Perhappes you woulde haue
mee aduenture at home, I will do so a
lyttle, but because wares ryse and fall
<pb facs="tcp:20795:33"/>
and no man ys certeynlye assured of
gayne: I will vse one trade that shall
wythout all doubte bringe me certeyne
gayne, although I sleepe vppon the one
syde, and that is wyth puttinge my mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ney
forth for interest, and taking good
assuraunce. There is no suche gayne
in tradynge, nor yet so certayne, and
were it not better to haue a great gayne
and a certeyne, wythout trauayle, and
wythout toyle, rather then to stande to
an vncerteyne gayne? which as it will
neuer be so great, as the verye lettynge
out of my money will make it, so ys it
gott with muche hazarde of lyfe, and
greate disquietnes of mynde and body.
I am young and gladlye woulde I

which I take to bee a good gaine.</p>

foure hundreth pounde, whiche is mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ueilous

               <p>And the shillinge pennie for a moneth,
yeldeth for the loane of an hundreth

because this matter is of great weyght,
and requireth a long discourse, good yt

so farre from god, and all godlinesse,
alacke the pitye therefore, when our

forsooth, to colour their doynges, wyll

Wherby this is a manifest reason

that the wicked men of thys worlde,
feare more penall statutes, and positiue

wherein they shewe them selues to bee

may saye, and iustifie it also, that suche
are they whome god hath forsaken, the

ordeyned for the Diuell and his angels
to be tormented in hell fier for euer, for
what can be worse, then the vserer, who

to saint Paules saying:<note place="margin">Paul. 2. Eph. 3</note> who wil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leth

couetouse, that they mynde no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thynge
in the world, but onely money,
and therefore cannot talke willynglye
of any other matter, but of setting forth
theire money for gayne, and desyringe
<pb facs="tcp:20795:49"/>
still that others maye want, that theyre
gayne maye be the greater, for conscy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence
they haue none, no more then
dogges. And better for a good mea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nynge
man, to bee cast headlonge into
prison, &amp; there to bee fast cheyned with
irons, then to come into their bondes:
for a man being imprisoned, maye by
some one meanes or other, gett out,
but beyng once in the vsurers danger,
it is not possible to gete out, but still hee
is assured to bee in, more and more, like
as a birde, beynge taken wyth lyme
twigges, the more shee struggleth to
gett out, the more shee is lymed and
entangled fast, so the poore man, the
more he dealeth wyth vsurie, the more
he is wrapped in Darbyes bandes, as
they saye, and at lengthe vtterlye vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>donne.
And thys ys the occasion of dy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uerse
bankeruptes, of manye decayed
gentlemen, that are compelled for lyfle
to sell theire landes awaye, and of a
number of honest occupyers, that by
those meanes are vtterly vndone, bothe
they, theire wyues, and their chyldren.
<pb n="32" facs="tcp:20795:49"/>
I do knowe, there bee other meanes
that bringes manye a man to pouertye,
as namelye, excessyue fare, gorgeous
apparell, keepynge of ouer manye ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uauntes,
playinge at dyce and cardes,
hauntynge of harlottes, and vnnecessa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rye
liberalitie, more vsed in England,
then elswhere. And yet will I saye, all
these sett togeether, haue not more har<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med
some men, and the moste of men,
then thys filthye vsurye hath doone.
And my reason ys thys: A man taketh
vpp a thousande poundes at one tyme,
and payeth for the same, twentye, thyr<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tye,
naye shal I saye fourtie, in the hun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dred
sometymes, and still runneth vpon
vsurie, by the space of fiue or sixe yeres,
yea, perhappes tenne yeres, payinge
vsurie vppon vsurie, whych after twen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie
pounde in the hundreth pound, com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>meth
to two thousand pounde, after ten
yeres, wyth the pryncipall, and so four<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie
in the hundred, amounteth to fower
thousand pounde in tenne yeres, wyth
the principall, nowe this borrower tri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>umpheth
for a tyme, but when he shall
<pb facs="tcp:20795:50"/>
come to paye the principall, and the vsu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rie
vppon vsurie, then he feeleth there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vpon
suche a smarte, that he is wroung
to the bones. And then forsooth awaye
goeth hys lande, and all that euer hee
hath, to master vsurer. I knowe a gen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tleman
borne to fiue hundred pounde
lande, and entring into vsurie vppon
pawne of his lande, did neuer receyue
aboue a thousa<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>d pound of nete money,
and within certeyne yeres, ronnynge
stil vpon vsurie, and double vsurie, and
vsurie vpon vsurie: the merchantes ter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>myng
it vsance and double vsance, by a
more clenly name, he did owe to ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ster
vsurer fiue thousand pound eat the
last, borowyng but one thousand pou<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>de
at first, so that his land was clean gone,
beynge fiue hundreth poundes inhery<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance,
for one thousande pound in mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ney,
and the vsurie of the same money,
for so fewe yeres, and the man nowe
beggeth. I will not saye, but this gen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tleman
was an vnthrift dyuers waies,
in good cheere, naye in euill cheere, I
may call it, in wearing gaye and costly
<pb n="33" facs="tcp:20795:50"/>
apparell, in roystynge wyth many ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uauntes
mo then needed, and wyth
mustrynge in monstrous greate hose,
in hauntynge euill companye, and las<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>shynge
out fondlye and wastfullye at
cardes and dyce, as tyme serued. And
pet I do saye, he loste more by the vsu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rer,
then hee did by all those vnthriftye
meanes: for his vayne expences was
not much more, then a thousand pound,
because hee had no more: whereas the
vsurer had not only his thousand pou<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>de
agayne, but fower tymes more, whyche
is fiue thousande pounde in the whole, &amp;
for want of this payement the fiue hun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dred
pounde land was wholy his. And
this gayne onlye he had for tyme. They
saye tyme is precious. Hee may well
saye, tyme was precious to hym, that
payed so deerely for it, or rather the vsu<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>rer
maye saye, that tyme was verye
precious to hym that tooke so muche
vnto hym. Nowe lorde god, what a
straunge thinge is this, that god suffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring
the sunne to shyne vpon vs freely,
and the ayre to bee comon to all, as well
<pb facs="tcp:20795:51"/>
poore as rych, wythout anye gayne ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king,
that we not considering so liberal
a goodnes of god, should so farre be fro<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
charitie, that we will fell tyme &amp; ayre so
deerely, hauing it of god so freely. Assu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>redly
suche caterpillers vpon earth, are
accursed of god aboue, because thei haue
no property of god in them belowe. For
god geueth power for y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> sunne to shyne,
sendeth rayne in due season, appointeth
the starres to keepe their courses, and al
for the behoofe and benefit of man: and
man onely, I meane the vsurer, is ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mie
both to god &amp; man, and will in no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thinge
folowe, neyther the example of
god, nor yet his blessed commaunde<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment,
nor feare his bitter threates, nor
yelde to any lawe. Therefore I say stil,
vsurers be diuels and no men, traitors
to theire creator, disloyall members to
his commaundements, caytifes to their
kynde, rebelles to theire countrey, and
enemies to their owne soules. But you
will saye, all vsurers be not of one sort,
some take lesse, and some take more. In
dede (I speake by wordly respect) I may
<pb n="34" facs="tcp:20795:51"/>
saye with the philosopher, there are de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>grees
of comparison in some sinne, and
yet I must saye, he that taketh ouer and
aboue that he lendeth, is an vsurer, and
so a synner before god: as he that stea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leth
but a penny by the hygh waye, is a
theefe aswell as he that stealeth an hun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dreth
pound, &amp; worthy to be ha<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ged ther<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore,
although the losse is not so greate
to the owner, but that is no matter, the
entent &amp; euill mynde is all one. And so
the vsurer that taketh lesse, because hee
woulde seeme honest, shall go to the di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uell,
because he hath wittinglye sinned
against god, aswell as the other that ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>keth
more, for that the law sayeth plain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lie,
thou shalt not take any thyng, ouer
&amp; aboue that thou hast lent. And he shal
dye the death aswell, he that hath killed
one man, as he that hath killed twenty,
because the lawe sayeth:<note place="margin">Exod. 20.</note> thou shalt not
kyll. Lykewyse he that offendeth wyth
one maryed woman, and that but ones,
is aswel an aduouterer, as that man is,
that hath offended dyuerse tymes with
many, because the lawe sayth, thou shalt
<pb facs="tcp:20795:52"/>
not co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>mytt aduouterie, whiche is then
co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>mitted, when any one man offendeth
with another mans wife. Lesse taking<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>
excuseth no man, when god forbiddeth
all maner of takyng. And often tymes,
he that taketh lesse, woulde haue more,
if he coulde gett it. I must not be wyser
then the holy ghoste, and therfore, what
soeuer I do fynde there, I will folowe it
playnly, wythout any addyng or dimi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nishing.
And so, where Christe willeth
vs not to looke for anye gayne at all,
what gayne shoulde we haue? Let len<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dyng
be a lending, as it shoulde be, that
is to saye, free, simple, and for charityes
sake, and as the nature of lendynge is,
wythout anye thinge at all, more then
the principall: for if I do take more, I
do not lende, as I am commaunded,
but I do contract, &amp; bargayne for myne
owne couetouse gayne onely, contrarye
to gods good will, &amp; commaundement,
and agaynst all lawe. Ezechiell sayth, if
I do take any thing ouer and aboue my
lone,<note place="margin">Ezechiell. 18.</note> I shall not liue the lyfe, but dye.
Therefore I woulde wishe all men, to
<pb n="35" facs="tcp:20795:52"/>
take good heede, what they do, and not
to flatter them selues wyth vayne glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ses,
and imaginations, as though they
mought in some case, &amp; in some respects
take an ouerplus, with a clere conscie<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ce.
I for my parte, woulde not take a penye
more then I did lende, for all the goods
in the worlde. For I knowe there is no
meane in this vyce, more then there
is in murder, thefte, or whoredom. And
therefore I saye, and maintayne it con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stantlye,
that all lendyng in respecte of
tyme, for any gaine, be it neuer so litle,
is vsurie, and so, wickednes before god
and man, and a damnable deede in it
selfe: because wee are commaunded to
lende freely, and to looke for nothynge
ouer, and aboue that we lend. But as I
sayed before, this vsurie is the daughter
of couetousnes, a monstrous daughter
I say, of an horrible fowle foster dame.
<hi>Seneca</hi> saieth wisely, <hi>Auarus nil rectè
facit, nisi cum moritur.</hi> The couetous man
doth nothing well, but when he dyeth,
whyche sentence may moste aptlye bee
saide of the wretched vsurer, who in his
<pb facs="tcp:20795:53"/>
lyfe time, is the cause of all hurte, for by
leauyng his goods behynde, there maye
some good come by hys deathe, when
his wealth is dispearsed abroade emon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gest
others, and hys vnmercifull dea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lyng
brought to an ende. Wee do all
feare the plague merueylously, and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>syre,
that bothe citye and countrey may
be cleane rid of it, and yet what a blesse
were it to thys whole realme, if in one
yere, there were an vniuersall murren
of all the vsurers in England. Murren
quod one, why that is a death proper to
beastes. Alacke good man, I haue fay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led
in my Rhethoricke, and yet I praye
you, what are these vsurers other then
beastes? for they liue lyke beastes, and
dye like beastes, and why shoulde I not
wyshe vnto suche brute carons a caro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niouse
death, meete to theire condicion,
since they will not repent and amende
their sinfull lyuing, by no warning nor
threatning of man nor god, that can be
deuysed.</p>
               <p>To lende freely is a kynde of liberali<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie
&amp; bountifulnes, when a man depar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teth
<pb n="36" facs="tcp:20795:53"/>
from his owne, to helpe his neigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bours
want, wythout any hope of lucre
or gayne at all, for he is benefited, that
borroweth, and feeleth greate comforte
in his great neede, wheras lending for
gayne, is a chiefe branch of couetousnes
&amp; makes him, that before might haue
ben counted bountifull, to be now reco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned
a greedy gayner for him selfe, see<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king
his own welfare vpon good assu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rance,
without any care at all what be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cometh
of his neighbour, gnawing him
vnmercyfully, to satisfie his own wret<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ched
&amp; most greedy hunger, directly tur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nynge
a moste bewtifull vertue, into a

is a manifest &amp; voluntarye knowen
thefte, which men do vse knowinglye &amp;
wyttingly, for eyther they think they do
euil, &amp; forbeare it neuer a whit, or (that
which is worst of all) they thinke they
do well, and so by oft vsing of this fil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thines,
do lull them selues in sinne with

wretched wyckednesse, and horryble
dealynge.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb facs="tcp:20795:54"/>
Christ for his bitter passion be merciful
vnto vs, and geue vs his feare, that we
may liue after hys lawe, and folowe his
holye will, for surely, as we lyue now,
eyther the byble is not gods worde, or
els we are not of god, such contrarieti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>is
betwene our lyues, and our lessons.
The scripture commaundeth,<note place="margin">Exodus 20</note> thou shalt
not steale, thou shalt not kyll, thou shalt
not commytt aduoutery, thou shall not
beare false witnesse, thou shalt not lend
out thy money for gayne, to take any<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thinge
for the lone of it, and yet we doe
all these thinges, as though there were
neyther scripture, that forbad vs, nor
heauen for vs to desyre, nor hell to es<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chewe,
nor god to honor, nor diuell to
dread. And this laste horrible offence,
which I count greater, or as great, as
any of the rest, is so common emongest
vs, that wee haue no sense to take yt
for synne, but count it lawfull bargai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nynge,
and iudge them goodlye wyse
men, that hauynge great masses of
money by them, will neuer aduenture
anye iott thereof in lawfull occupying,
<pb n="37" facs="tcp:20795:54"/>
eyther to carrye out our plentye, or to
bringe in our want, as good merchants
vse, and ought to doe, but lyuinge idle
at home, will sett out theire money for
profite, and so enrych them selues wyth
the labour and trauayle of others, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> selues none other, then droanes
that sucke the honney, whyche other
paynefull Bees gather wyth their con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tynuall
trauayle of dyuers slowers in
euerye fielde. And whether these men
be profitable, or tollerable to a common
weale, or no, I reporte me to you? Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sydes
that, god doth vtterlye forbidd
them, whose commaundement ought to
bee obeyed, yf we be Christians, and of
god, as we professe to be. And therefore
for my parte, I will wyshe some penall
lawe of death to be made, against those
vsurers, aswell as agaynste theefes or
murtherers, for that they deserue death
muche more then suche men doe, for
these vsurers destroye and deuour vp,
not only whole families, but also whole
countreys, and bring all folke to beg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gerie,
that haue to do wyth them. And
<pb facs="tcp:20795:55"/>
therefore are muche worse then theefes
or murtherers, because theire offence
hurteth more vniuersallye, and tou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cheth
a greater nomber, the one offen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dynge
for neede, and thother vpon wil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fulnesse,
and that whych is woorst, vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der
the coloure of frendshippe, mennes
throtes are cutt, and the dooers coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted
for honest and wyse men amongest
others that haue so vngodlye geathered
goods togeather. What is the matter
that Jewes are so vniuersallye hated
wheresoeuer they come? For soothe,
vsurie is one of the chief causes, for they
robbe all men that deale with them, and
vndoe them in the ende. And for thys
cause, they were hated in England, and
so banyshed worthelye, wyth whome I
woulde wyshe all these Englishemen
were sent, that lende their money or o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
goods whatsoeuer for gayne, for I
take them to be no better then Jewes.
Nay, shall I saye? they are worse then
Jewes, for go whither you wil through
out Christendom, and deale with them,
and you shall haue vnder tenne in the
<pb n="38" facs="tcp:20795:55"/>

what losse, daunger, or hinderaunce so<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>euer

can these men be of god, that are so farr
from charitie, that care not howe they
get goods so they may haue them.</p>
               <p>O lorde haue mercy vpon vs, and deale

You haue sayde muche, and verie
godlye, but whether politiquelye, and
altogether aptly, I cannot constantlye
affirme, for that I see all comon weales

otherwyse then you preache. And there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
I must thinke you take the scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures

accordyng to the very meanynge of the

not in you preachers to iudge precyselie
what vsurie is. For as diuynes cannot
tell what hearb is best for euery disease,
but the phisicions that are best practised,
and acquaynted therewyth: so it ys not

            <sp>
               <p>AS your professio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> is diuinitie, so your
whole sermon soundeth of god, and
doth requyre so muche of man, as man
is not able to perfourme. Happy is the
that commeth nyghest, but assuredlye
he neuer lyued, that either hath done, or
can do, or shalbee able hereafter to doe
that which you haue vttered. You begin
with loue, and make loue the perfection
of the lawe, and here you bring the com<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>maundment,
that man must loue god a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>boue
all thynges, &amp; his neyghbour as
him selfe. What man euer lyued, that
did, or was able to perfourme this law<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>none
surely, sauyng Christe onely, and
therefore, because of our impossibilitie,
Christe came in fleashe in the fulnesse
of tyme, to appease the wrathe of hys
father for synne, and to satisfy the law,
whyche els coulde neuer haue beene
perfourmed, so that in Christe onelye
is our iustification, as I haue hearde
you full often preache.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb facs="tcp:20795:58"/>
Therefore, whereas you saye, no man
shoulde lende for anye gayne, and that
all men shoulde lende freelye to them
that haue neede wythout anye respects
of profite, I do thynke you do deale o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uer
precyselye, and goe about to brynge
men to that strayghtnes, as they neuer
were in, at anye tyme. For as I heare
some saye, vsurie is neuer hurtful, but
when it vyteth, otherwyse, it may be al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowed
and suffered. For if I doe lend<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>
money to hym, that hath neede, and can
proue that for wante of the same money
I haue susteyned greate losse, or if my
debtour do breake daye wyth me, when
I looke to haue it at the tyme apointed,
and so am endaungered to my neygh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bour,
for my necessarye payementes,
whyche of ryght he claimeth at y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> tyme:
it were good reason, that my debtour
beare my losse, rather then I should sus<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain
harme or danger for my good will.
And reason it is, y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> euery man haue his
own, or els it were better holding fast &amp;
to be sure, then to lend and lose all. For
whatsoeuer you say of loue towards our
<pb n="41" facs="tcp:20795:58"/>
neighbour, me thinketh no man should
loue his neighbour better then him self,
which they seeme to doe that lende to o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
frely, and want them selues. And I
haue hard say, that <hi>Charitas incipit a se.</hi>
Charitie beginneth first at it selfe. And
vse we not in common phrase to saye?
Neare is my coat to my skinne, but my
shirt is nerer. As who should say, I wil
be a frend vnto my neyghbor, and help
him so muche as I am able, but I wyll
not so helpe him by S. Marie, as I will
harme my selfe: which is not gods will
that I shoulde doe. You haue heaped a
nomber of scriptures together, alleaged
doctoures, and brought forthe reasons,
for y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> detestation of vsurie, wherein you
haue done well, but better you shoulde
haue done, in my mind, if you had wei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
vsury more straightely by the rule of
charitie, and not directly to call al those
vsurers, that take any thing more then
they haue lent, for so the case may falle
oute, that he sinneth who hath borowed,
yf he will not make recompence: ther<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
in such cases, circumstances ought
<pb facs="tcp:20795:59"/>
to be considered, &amp; so iudgment geeuen
vpon y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> mater. Neither ought I to deale
with all men in one sorte, for as there be
three sortes of dealings amongest men,
that is, gift, bargaininge, and lending:
so are there three sorts of men, the stark
begger, the poore houshoulder, and the
rich merchant or ge<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>tleman. To the first
I ought to geue freely, not onely to lend
freely, to the second I ought to lend, ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
freely or mercifully, with the third
I may deale straightly, and aske myne
owne with gaine, as I take it, without
offence to god, or man: for when I deale
with him that maketh gaine of my mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ney
with his trade and occupyinge, and
is well able to pay me againe, being en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riched
by my meanes cheefelye, whye
should not I in reason, haue part of his
aduauntage, when by my goods hee ys
growen riche? for be it that two, three,
or fowr, be in consort, wherof two puts
forth theire money, and the other twoe
vse their laboure and industrye, for en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>creasinge
the same money, by lawefull
trade, ys it not reasonne that these al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>though
<pb n="42" facs="tcp:20795:59"/>
they be idle at home, who haue
disbursed large sommes of money to ad<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>uenture
freely with others should haue
reasonable gayne with them: God for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bidde
els. But you wil saye perhappes,
this is no vsury. I cannot tell what you
call vsurye, these menne doe lende and
thother doe borrowe, and enter into
good handes, first to restore the prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cipalle,
and nexte to promise and coue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nante
for such competent gaine, as they
shalbe able to make and shewe vppon
theyre accompte. It is no reason that e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uery
manne shoulde be an occupier, or
merchant aduenturer, a chopper, or a
changer: but good it is that fewe deale
for money, and then shall many thriue
and not that euery bodye shoulde bee a
doer for him selfe that scant one manne
can liue for another. Therefore I think
it good, that when a man hath iij. or iiij.
thousand pounds liyng by him, to geue
some to the poore &amp; needy beggers, and
in lending frely to help the orphans, wi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dows
&amp; strangers, &amp; with y<hi rend="sup">•</hi> rest to make
his own certein gain for his adua<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ceme<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t
<pb facs="tcp:20795:60"/>
amongest the riche occupiers &amp; welthy
cobbes of the worlde. For surelye I am
of this minde, that where no bittinge is,
there is no vsurie, and where both par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties
do gayne, ther ought to be conten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tacion
of mynd, and good agrement on
both parties. Some therbe that say, all
vsury is against nature, wheras I thi<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>k
cleane contrarie, for if vsurie weare a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainst
nature, it should be vniuersallye
euell, but god hath said, y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> to a stranger
a man may put out his mony for vsury,
but it it had bene againste nature, god
would not haue graunted that libertie.
So that I take it to agree both with law
and nature, that I shoulde do good vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to
him, that doth good vnto me, or els I
shoulde be vnthankefull, than which,
there cannot be a greater or more hor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rible
fault vpon earth, and rewards ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uen
for good turnes done, or pleasures
receiued for benefites bestowed, are so
common, that who so offendith herein,
is pointed at and counted a churle, and
shall after want when he woulde haue.
Moreouer, who may not giue his owne
<pb n="43" facs="tcp:20795:60"/>
frely, or what is he that wil not, or may
not take any thing that is geuen? what
is more fre then gift? or what is he that
will shew such discurtesy not to receiue
a gift, when it is freely offred? &amp; what
other thing do they that seke to borrow
money, but entreate merueilouslye and
offer frankelye for the time &amp; vse of mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ney.
Moreouer, it is not against the Ro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>main
lawes of the Emperoures, but ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
allowed, not onely suffered as you
master doctor can best tell, by lawes of
your Code and made by the Emperour
Justiniane, the best prince that euer ly<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ued.
Yea the cannon lawe it self semeth
to suffer it in the title of vsurye, as you
knowe better than I can tell. Euen in
gods lawe if I be not deceiued, vsury is
not forbidden.<note place="margin">Luke 19.</note> For is it not in S. Lukes
ghospell that god said, he would come &amp;
aske the mony lent with the vsury, bla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ming
him that did not put it fourth for
gaine.<note place="margin">Deut: 24.</note> And in Deutronomie it is plain.
Thou shalt not lend to thy brother for
gaine, but to a stranger. The common
lawe of England is not against all vsu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rye
<pb facs="tcp:20795:61"/>
neither in suche sorte, and so pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cise
lye, as you take vsurye. And Sta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tutes
there haue beene, that haue per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitted
vsurie, which I woulde they had
contynued to auoide further euell, for
(as we say) better it is to suffer a mis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chiefe,
then an inconuenience. But to
reason this matter further, yf I lende
vnto a manne my plate for fiue or sixe
monethes I may lawefullye take gaine
onely for the lone, and no man will say
black is mine eye, and yet if I doe take
for money, by and by they will make
an outcry and call men vsurers there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore,
where at I meruaile greatly. For
a man (as I take it) maye more benefite
him selfe with an hundrede markes in
money, then he canne do withe an other
mans bason or ewer of an hundrede
markes value. And yet lending of mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ney
is called vsurie, and lendinge of
plate for gaine to haue the same plate
againe is no vsurie at all. Yet further, if
I lend one a thowsand pounde in gold,
for pompe sake onelye to shewe at the
banke (as they vse in Italye and other
<pb n="48" facs="tcp:20795:61"/>
countreis) or otherwise, to make some
beleue they haue somuch of theire own,
it ys not denied, but I maye receaue
gaine for the same, hauinge my prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cipall
returned vnto mee in the same
fourme and manner as I did lende it:
and yet if I shoulde haue lent so muche
mony of good wil, &amp; suffred the partye
to occupye the same for his own benefyt,
restoringe vnto mee the value thereof
withe some ouerplus or gayne, then by
and by I shoulde bee called an vsurer.
And what yf one I pray you be an occu<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>pyer,
&amp; wanting mony come to me, that
am an occupier also, and desire to borow
largelye: if I bargaine with him to haue
parte of his gayne, yf hee make anye,
or otherwise doe couenaunt, that yf the
lendynge of thys shall bee anye hynde<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>raunce
to my occupyinge, to gette some
bargayne, whiche I shall perhappes
mysse, and proue yt playnely, because
my mony ys out of my hande: may not
I in bothe these cases take vsurye wyth<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out
daunger of the lawe, or offence to
god? yes withoute doubte I ma<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>e.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb facs="tcp:20795:62"/>
And yet to lend money simplie is coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted
vsury, wheras there is no man that
lendith but susteineth losse, for the want
of it, because he might better benefit him
self by empolying it in diuers wais, the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
to suffer it to be in an other mans ha<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ds,
besides the danger that maye happen,
when a mans money is out of his own
handes, for surer it cannot be, then in a
mans own possession. Then away with
this precisnes on godes name, to make
euery lending for gaine to be plaine v<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>surie
and that on penie ouer is sinne be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
god, which neither I, nor yet mas<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
merchaunt here, can wel beleue ful<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly,
for I would haue althings weighed
by reason in matters of contractes and
bargaines, and not so to minse things,
as though there weare no meane, for I
do not take vsury to be, as whoredome
or theft is. In these sinnes there is no
meane to make any vertue, for he that
offendith but once in whoredome, is an
offendour, and he that stealeth neuer so
little, is a theif, and neither of their do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>inges
in any respect, or by any circum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stance
<pb n="45" facs="tcp:20795:62"/>
is or can be good, wheras the len<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>dinge
of mony or other goods, for gain
may be verye beneficiall vnto him that
boroweth, as for example. A manne is
bound to pay 300.<abbr>li.</abbr> at a certaine day, or
els he looseth perhaps 40.<abbr>li.</abbr> good land,
weare it not charitie and a good dede to
helpe this man, that his lande shoulde
not be loste for euer? and none offence
neither, as I take it, to do a good turne,
and to receiue an other. I wil go nerer.
Be it ther were a great dearth of corn &amp;
I haue plenty lying by me, wear it not
better for me charitably to lende corne,
to the poore &amp; nedy for their sustenance
and relief, and so to receiue somewhat
in gaine at the yeres end, then to suffer
them to want and vtterly to perish? Of
two euells, the lesse is to be preferred, y<hi rend="sup">•</hi>
is, better it wear to lend for gaine, then
to suffer my euen christian to dy for hun<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ger.
And if I be not deceiued, this is S.
Agustines opinion, who allowethe of
gaine in such time of necessitie, rather
then the people shoulde sterue. Yea the
Emperour Iustinians law is (as I am
<pb facs="tcp:20795:63"/>
enformed) yf I lend one ten bushells of
wheate, and the borrower of him selfe
withoute any stipulation or bargayns
made, doe barelye promise me twelue
bushelles for the same at the next har<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ueste,
I maye lawfullye demaunde the
same, and by action recouer it, if it bee
denied me. And, as I vnderstand, there
bee of your doctours who write vppon
the canon lawe, that affirme the lesse e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uell
to be chosen before the greater, ye,
euen in that case of dearth and extreme
famine. Therefore I am still of this
mind, when none hath harme but both
receiue benefites: there is none offence
committed, but rather great goodnes v<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed.
You talke much of charitie, you be<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>gin
with loue: I would you weighed al
causes aswell by the rule of charitie, &amp;
referred al thinges to charitie, by iudg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
&amp; discrecion, as you haue well spo<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ke<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
of charitie, &amp; then this great talke ne<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ded
not. For surely wher charity is not
hindred, there is no vsury co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>mitted, such
vsury onely beeing forbidden that brea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>keth
charitie &amp; decaiethe the loue of my
<pb n="46" facs="tcp:20795:63"/>
neighboure by extreame cutting &amp; exces<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>siue
taking. And who wil not be greued
when he is ouerlaid with intollerable v<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>sury,
that, do what he can, ye trauasil he
and trade he neuer so muche, the biting
vsurie wilbe lorde in the ende of all his
gaines what soeuer. And this it is, that
offendith god, whe<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> the idle Epicure and
licencious vsurer doth wholy gain, and
the true dealing trader or occupier doth
begge his breade in the end, notwithsta<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
                  <g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ding
his greate industry &amp; iust dealing.
Ye I say further, that neither theaft nor
aduowtry, nor yet murther wear to be
cou<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ted sinnes, if y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> rule of charity were
not broken. For in all these hainous of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fences,
charytie ys decaied, and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
they are deadly synnes, and so ys
vsury when it biteth and by that means
breakithe charitye: otherwyse yt ys no
vsurye, if my neighbour feele no smart
nor losse, nor yet ys hyndered there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>with,
for the end and fulfillynge of the
lawe ys charytye. And where charytie
is kepte, I say still, there ys no offence
made, nor yet synne commytted.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb facs="tcp:20795:64"/>
Now therfore you must either proue e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uery
vsury, be it neuer so litle, to breake
charitie: or els I will saye still, y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> where
charitie is not broken (as I say it is not
when my neighbour feeleth no harme)
there is no offence co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>mitted, before ey<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
god or man. You haue saide verye
well against couetousnes, the roote of
all euell, and surelye there cannot bee a
worse man, then y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> couetous man, for he
maketh his money his god, and so com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitteth
idolatry, as S. Paul saith. But
I will not say, that euery vsurer is a co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uetous
man, but onely the vnmercifull
and cuttinge vsurer, y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> hath no loue nor
charitie in him in the world, and careth
not, whoe be vndone, so he may gaine.
This is hee that godd and man abhor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rethe,
that scripture and all lawes doe
and euer haue condempned, for moste
wicked &amp; abhominable. And mark wel
the place of Ezechiell the 18. chapter. and
especially the 22. and there you shall see
that the prophete doth expresly crye out
of couetousnes, after he hath condemp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned
vsury, as who should say, that coue<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>tousnes
<pb n="47" facs="tcp:20795:64"/>
is the chefest cause, of this hor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rible
vsurye, because it consumeth &amp; vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>doeth,
as many as deale therewith, and
yet what is he, that will saye, that he is
vndon by his neyghbor, because he hath
borowed many hu<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>dred pounds of him,
and hath paide ouer and aboue the prin<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>cipall,
to his creditor for euery hundred
one penye by the yere? or who wil saye
that such a creditour is a couetous man,
or a biter, or an offendour of gods lawe
&amp; mans lawe that taketh for euery 100<abbr>l.</abbr>
but one selye penye. This is rather a
Stoiks paradore, &amp; an extrauagant im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>magination
then any true assertion in
doctrine, as I take it. Let vs go to the
very word of vsury in the hebrue tong.
It is calledde a bitinge, of this woorde
Neshech, whiche is nothinge else but a
kind of bityng, as a dog vseth to bite or
gnawe vpon a bone, so that he that by<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teth
not, doth not co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>mit vsurye: for vsu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rie
is none other thinge, than a bitinge,
as I saide of the verye Etimologie and
proper nature of the woorde, otherwise
it cannot be called Neshech, as the He<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bricians
<pb facs="tcp:20795:65"/>
say, and so call vsury of biting
onely: And the Tigurine translation
hath in Exodus. <hi>Non inferes morsum fratri
tuo,</hi> Thou shalt not bite thy brother,
where as other translatio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>s haue, <hi>Non foe

                  </gap>, whiche is a

worde is. And I pray you what a prety
babe is that, when an hundred poundes
bringe fourth one single penye? I here
say some call vsury a monstrous beaste
<pb n="44" facs="tcp:20795:65"/>
because she bringethe foorthe monsters
from time to time, by excessiue encrease
of gayne: Alacke what a pretye mon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ster
is this or what biting, or what gain
can it be to any mans hurt, when one re<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ceiueth
a single peny, or an halfe penye
or a farthinge, or the fourthe parte of a
farthing, or what you will, be it neuer
so little (for all is one to the deuines &amp;
precise preachers) for the borowinge of
an hundred pounds for a yere? for this
kinde of bytinge is noe greater harme
then is a flea bytinge, nor so much ney<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther,
and therfore not fit to be spoken of
now. God make al thinges straight and
vpright that are croked or awrye, and
then the truthe may bee knowne and so
lowed, as god hath expresly commaun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded
with out this burdening and ouer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>charginge
of mens consciences, &amp; woun<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>dinge
them in such sort, y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> a man cannot
almost tel what to do. In dede I wil not
deny but that we oughte rather to geue
then to lende, and rather to lende frelye
then to demaunde gaine for loue: but
thys I saye, as I am not bound to geue
<pb facs="tcp:20795:66" rendition="simple:additions"/>
frankely to euery man that askethe, no
more am I bound to lend frely to euery
man, that woulde borrowe, but accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding
to the circumstances of time, par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son,
cause, place, and occasion, I maye
bestowe my goods and distribute suche
wealthe as god of his goodnes hath al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowed
me to occupy, and geuen me leue
to vse, as the stewarde of his houshold,
and if some one man pay moderately o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uer
and aboue, for that whiche he hath
borrowed, I say it is no offence before
god, as I take it. And recompense is al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowed
for beneefites donne, saye what
you will, or at the leaste wyse, no man
ought to fare the worse for his well do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>inge,
or to be a looser for his lendinge,
which many men shold do, if they were
not considered. You say you will not be
wyser then the holy ghost, I would not
wish you so to be, but rather I pray god
you might be half so wise, as the holye
ghoste is, for I beleue verelye, the holy
ghost neuer so ment, as you speake, or
else surely I must say that the worlde is
in a strange case. Yea I will say further
<pb n="49" facs="tcp:20795:66"/>
yf that weare true, the world could not
be as it is, neyther coulde man liue, for
what reason is it, that I shoulde lende
freely to euery man a like? for whereas
ther be three men come vnto me at one
time, as I said before, the starke begger,
the poore housholder, and the great rich
merchant, or great landed gentleman,
lord or knight, and al they three would
haue money, or borrowe money of mee
at one time, shall I vse them all a lyke,
and in one sorte of charitie? I do thinke
no reason, nor lawe of god, or man wil
enforce me to it, and therefore I thinke
you diuines, doe not well obserue cir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cumstances,
when youe will that the
very bare letter shalbe plainelye taken
as it lieth, and in one sorte or manner to
be applied to all men, without regarde
of circumstance, degree, estate, or con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dicion,
of any one. what? not a penny
of no man whatsoeuer he be? it is stra<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ge
and without the compasse of my vnder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>standinge,
and surely in my conscience,
without the meaning of the holy ghost,
for if you will take all texts of the scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture
<pb facs="tcp:20795:67"/>
so precisely, how aunswere you to
this, <hi>Omni paetenti abs te dato.</hi> Geue to e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uery
man that asketh of thee. I pray you
whoe euer did, or was able or thought it
meete to geeue to all that aske: For then
whosoeuer goeth abroade, yf he caryed
neuer so much out with hym, hee might
perhappes come home with an empty
purse, if his disposicion were knowen,
and if hee did so from daye by daye by a
certeine space, he might perhaps begge
as fast of those in thend as they did begg
of him at y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> beginning. Besides that, in
geuing without discrecion, you shal of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tentimes
more offend god in bestowing
almes vpon some, then you shoulde doe
in holding your handes, for that in ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uinge
to loyterers &amp; vagabonds, whom
you knowe not whether they haue nede
or noe you do rather maintaine them in
their idlenes, then benefit their pouerty,
&amp; offende god highly because you geue
w<hi rend="sup">t</hi>out choise or iudgement, for whiche
you shal aunswer another day. It is wri<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ten

Likewise it is saide by Christe, ye haue
hearde howe it was saide to them in the
olde time. Thou shalt not forswere thy
selfe, but shalt perfourme thine othe to
god,<note place="margin">Exodus. 20.</note> but I say vnto you, swere not at al,
neither by heauen for it is godds seate,

&amp;c. wherin all swearing is forbid<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>den,
and yet to take an othe before a ma<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>gistrat,
is not against god. The co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>mau<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>d<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ment
saith, Thou shalt not kill, &amp; yet it
is not forbidden to the magistrat, to vse

neither is any man forbidde<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> to kil, in his

that he may with force withstand force.
Ther be diuers such texts which I could
allege &amp; proue, whiche if they were not
otherwise vnderstoode then the bare
words do beare, would bring great con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fusion
withe them, and suche inconueni<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ences
also, as no reason nor law would,
coulde, or might allowe in any wise.</p>
               <p>Therfore I say, Christ neuer so ment as
you do vnderstande, say you what you
will. Besides this, such straight and pre<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>cise
<pb n="55" facs="tcp:20795:68"/>
prohibitio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>s do great harme, for they
open a way to the euel, who will hardly
be brideled by anye lawe, to doe and to
deale with al men excessiuely, and hin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der
the good, that would deale charita<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>blye,
and yet for want of a warraunt in
law, dare not meddle at all, and so the
poore do perish, that else might be hol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pen
and relieued vpon paiment of mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derate
vsance. And see what commethe
of this precise restrainte, men now can
get no money, but after xxx. or xx. at the
lest in the hundred, wheras if ther were
a reasonable stint, all such as haue nede
should fare the better, money would be
more common, and the couetous man,
woulde the soner bee brideled, from ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kinge
excessiue gaine, but manye men
are of such nicenes, and so far of from
yelding to a good acte, to be made to the
common profite of all, that they had ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
one gained a thousand pound with
out lawe, than get one hundred pounde
with lawe, such as might be made with
a good conscience. You talke that gaine
takinge for lendinge onely is flat vsu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rie
<pb facs="tcp:20795:69"/>
as though anye manne tooke gaine
for lending onely, and not for other res<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pectes,
as that his moneye is out of hys
hande, which els might be employed, &amp;
being in another mannes keping, is in
daunger of loosing, that otherwise was
safe &amp; sure enoughe when it was in his
own hands. And lastly, such losse or hin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deraunce
perhaps might come vnto him
for want of his owne ready money, as
some man at a time would geeue for so
muche moneye, so muche lande vpon a
great extremitie and present neede. As
who is not subiect to suche accidentes by
warre, sicknes, imprisonment, trouble,
and displeasure that maye happen to a
mans vtter vndoing, if he do not auoid
the sodeine harme and present daunger
that ha<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>geth ouer his head. And whether
shall a man goe or flye, or how shal one
seke to help him selfe y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> hath no money.
Therefore that saying is impertynent &amp;
void of reason, that men do commonlye
receyue gayne for onely lending, &amp; not
rather in respect of the harme y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> myghte
happen, or the profit that doth cease whe<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
                  <pb n="52" facs="tcp:20795:69"/>
a man is without hys moneye: or els to
take a neighbourly part of the gain, that
the debtor might geat. Noe surely, wise
men of al ages &amp; times y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> haue rated the
proporcion of taking, haue not stinted y<hi rend="sup">•</hi>
same, because men onely haue lent, but
because of the interest &amp; gaine that dothe
or might happen to the lender, yf he had
the vse him self &amp; employing of his own
money. And therefore, say as it pleaseth
you, I wil hold with them, that bargain
for moderate gaine, mary in al co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>tracs
&amp; bargains I would haue plain dealing
without cheuisance or colourable deuy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ses,
not as many vse to do. There was
a statute made <hi>Anno Henrici septimi</hi> 3. to
meete with certaine cheuisaunces, but
the same was repealed, &amp; an other made
in the tenth yere, wher brokers are met
with all, and suche as will haue the be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nefyt
of mens landes, mortgaged tyll
they be payde suche money as they lent,
where the lent money is forfeyted. But
because it is hard to make any such good
lawes, but the malice &amp; cunning of man
will practise to breake the same, by some
<pb facs="tcp:20795:70"/>
skilfull sleight especialy when it tendith
to the benefitte of man: therfore in my
simple iudgement I doe muche comend
that law, which was made in 37. <hi>Henry.</hi> 8
where none were suffred to take aboue
10.<abbr>li.</abbr> in the hundred vpon lone, eyther
for wares, or for money, and sory I am
that the same law was repealed by y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> sta<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>tute
of <hi>Anno 5. Ed.</hi> 6. whiche statute al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>though
it bear a colour of godlines, and
seemes to be grounded vppon religion,
yet I doubte muche therof, and I think
verely it is made againste all pollecye, &amp;
therefore yt weare good that a parlya<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment,
had wyse regard to haue it abroga<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ted,
for the statute seemethe to say, that
all gaine had for the vse of money, in
what sorte soeuer it be, is plain vsury,
&amp; vtterly forbidden. And yet what shall
I say? where charitie is kept, ther is no
vsury co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>mitted: for what if I say, I will
freely lend vnto my frend if he wil bere
with me in a certaine aduenture, if any
losse happen, shall I call that vsury? or if
one do brek day with me, &amp; I sue him for
damages, because I haue forborne my
<pb n="53" facs="tcp:20795:70"/>
mony a longe time: will anye man call
suche dealinges vsury? god forbid. Or
be it that the most of my goods are abrod
and I doubt of the good successe and spe<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>die
retourne of them, yf he that borrow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth
will beare proporcionablye after 10.
or 12.<abbr>li.</abbr> in the hundred, for my damages
sustained, yf any such misshap doe fail,
then I shalbe contented to do him good,
otherwise I would be very loth to helpe
him and hurt my selfe, which I should
do, yf I lent my goods and afterwards
being vndone throughe aduenturinge,
coulde haue none to beare my losses, is
this any vsury to make such a counea<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t?
I do not thinke so. I will put you an o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
case. A merchant dieth and leuethe
to his wife 500.<abbr>li</abbr> in nete mony, and no
more of any other substance, and to sixe
yonge children that he had with her 200<abbr>l</abbr>
for euery one of them, when they bee of
yeres: how shall this wife liue that kno<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>weth
no trade? how shall these children
be mainteined till they bee of yeares, &amp;
haue ther stock wholy deliuered to them
neither she nor they haue anye arte or
<pb facs="tcp:20795:71"/>
neither she nor they hauing any arte or
knowledge to get their liuinge by? And
is it reasou that the stocke should runne
stil without profyt, and euery one decay
and be vndone thereby? now god for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bid.
And surely except they may be suffe<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>red
to put forthe their money for reaso<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nable
gaine, I cannot see how it can bee
otherwise with them. And therefore I
would haue all thinges weighed by rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son,
and the state of daunger better con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sidered
then it is, without this precise v<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sage
to forbyd gayne vpon money alto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether
vpon paine of deadly sinne. For
I doe not thinke that the wydowe and
her children shoulde offende god, yf o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers
wil geue reasonably for the vse of
her money, to maynteyne her selfe and
her children. And wel do I allow the vse
of London, for Orphanes money to bee
yerely payd. I wil goe farther.</p>
               <p>A yonge man hath been waytinge on a
gentleman in his Chamber, &amp; seruinge
long gotte a litle money togeather: the
gentleman his master dyeth, the felow
hath no frendes, and master can hee get
<pb n="54" facs="tcp:20795:71"/>
none, the worlde is harde and men are
mistrustfull, digge or delue he can not,
and occupacion hath he none, because he
was brought vp only as a seruing man,
and to begge is ashamed, yea and if he
dyd so, hee shoulde haue nothing geuen
hym, but bee whipped for hys labour as
a vagabonde, and if hee shoulde steale,
there is noe mercye but hanging: Now
what shal he doe? spend vpon the stock,
and suffer all goe to waste? so maye hee
soone come to noughte. Better it were
for hym, as I take it, to put out his mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neye
for some gaine that his stocke may
bee whole, and hee mighte lyue till hee
espyed a tyme to bestowe hys moneye
vpon some one thinge or other, for hys

to good bargaines that may happen.</p>
               <p>There is is a Shippe wrack, and goods

I may gette for a hundreth pounde and
wilbe worth two hundreth pou<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>d to me,

money I haue none excepte I borrowe,
what a foole weare I not to get 20<abbr>l.</abbr> in y<hi rend="sup">•</hi>
hundred, to gaine almost 200<abbr>l.</abbr>? many
suche thinges maye profitably happen
with in the compas of a yeare, but let all
these matters goe. Be it that I haue lent
money my selfe freely, and lookinge to
haue it at my daye, coulde not get it,
but taried three or foure monethes for it
after the daye, and so was disappointed
to satisfye my creditours, is it reason y<hi rend="sup">t</hi>
I who lent frely and of good wil, should
sustaine any losse for my free harte and
kinde dealinge? our law granteth good
remedy, and I thinke in your lawe mas<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ter
Ciuilian there is good redresse, for
suche offences. Again, if I let one kepe
my mony, and y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> said man doth employ
the same money without my knowledg
for encrease: is it not reason y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> I should
haue parte of his gaine? who will deny
this vnto me? I am well assured, that
you master Ciuilian wil not say the con<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>trarye,
and thus you se, that mony get<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teth
money, and that lawfully, for loke

<pb n="55" facs="tcp:20795:72"/>
in right demaund for myne owne bee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hoofe
the encrease that commethe of it.
I praye you answere me in this, what
if the debtour doe faile, and play bank<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rupte?
in what case am I then, for my
kinde hart and charitable dealing? were
it not good then that vsury might bee y<hi rend="sup">t</hi>
price of suche perill as may happen, and
soe I to haue somewhat, rather then to
lose all, as in lending 88.<abbr>l.</abbr> to take a bill
for 100<abbr>l.</abbr> that y<hi rend="sup">•</hi> casualtie of losse may be
recompensed with the certentie of gain,
for a man maye lose all, and therfore it
is good to be sure to gaine somewhat be
fore hand. Ther is a saying in your law

my parte, am againste you all that wyll
haue no vsury, or will make the gayne

               <p>YOur foundation sir, that you firste
laid to proue your matter with all, ys
not good, nor sownde, so that your buyl
dinge can not stande, but must needes
fall to the grounde, for thus you saye:
vsurie ys not hurtfull, excepte it bee by<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting.
I do aunsweare, whosoeuer stea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leth
but one peny from a riche man, is
a theefe before god, and yf hee steale
twelue pence or aboue, hee shalbe han<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ged
by the lawes of the land, as you best
knowe, and yet you will saye: and all
<pb n="59" facs="tcp:20795:77"/>
men knowe, that here is no byting, but
the matter is this. The lawe hath sayd,
thou shalt not steale, for hee that steleth
bee it more or lesse, ys a theefe, because
hee taketh an other mans goods felo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niously
against hys will, being forbid<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>den
both by God and man so to do. Eue<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
so saye I, whosoeuer taketh but one pen<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ny
of gayne by couenante ouer &amp; aboue
hys principal, for y<hi rend="sup">•</hi> vse only of lending,
&amp; in respect of tyme, he is an vsurer, al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>though
here seemeth no bytinge at all.
For God hath saide. Thou shall not a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gree
to take by couenaunte, any thinge
ouer and aboue thy principal, and ther<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
it is synne, beyng expresly forbidde<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
as theafte ys, and so not to bee vsed a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mongst
christians, for therfore is vsu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry
called a byting, because creditours
are commonly vnmercifull, &amp; care not
what they geate, and who<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> they vndoe,
&amp; so they doe byte &amp; greeue poore men
very sore, yea they make riche me<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> ofte<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
                  <g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tymes

to cutte of all byting, &amp; the colour ther<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of
(for yf you geeue then an inche, they

hys people, to take any gayne at all
for lone, y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> rather to induce men to chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stian
charitye, that is, to lend freely, to
helpe the needy, &amp; to doe as they woulde
bee done vnto, yf the case weare theirs.
Now when you allege that you cannot
haue your money at your dayes appoin<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ted,
and therfore in reason you shoulde
haue a recompence: I doe not deny, but
that they who kepe your money longer
from you, than by couenaunte was a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>greed,
are to aunsweare for it, and in al
lawe and reason, must paye your dama<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ges
and interest of your money, for so
long tyme holden from you agaynste
your will, for herein he doth you appa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rant
wrong: and couenaunte was there
none for gayne to bee reaped vpon the
principall, so that thys is no vsurie, but
hee onely to bee blamed, and to bee pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nished
by the purse <hi>quantum tua interest,</hi>
for witheholding your proper goodes
fro<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> you, for so much time, against your

tenne or twelue in y<hi rend="sup">•</hi> hundred, &amp; no vsu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rie
herein co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>mitted at all. Your distin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction
of three sortes of men, and three
sortes of dealing, is rather politick than
christian, rather wordely, than diuyne,
although som diuynes be of your mind,
but they speake of their own heades, w<hi rend="sup">t</hi>
                  <g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out

holde, for you ought to lend freely vnto
all men, riche &amp; poore, lord &amp; gentlema<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>,
kyng &amp; Caysar, for that god being the
lord of the ryche, aswell as of the poore,
hath vtterly, &amp; precisely forbidden all v<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>surie
amongst all men, that are of the

will saye, y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> ryche men are no christia<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>s,
or not godds people, the whych I trust,
you wyll not so muche as think, muche
lesse affirme y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> same by speach. And your

none themselues, &amp; so to reape in co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>mon
y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> gayne, that they might make by their

full yf you deale for assured gayne, by

<pb facs="tcp:20795:79"/>
aswel contented to beare with all losses
that might happen, as to reape certayne
gayne, for in so doing, where the gayne
is vncertaine, &amp; none assured co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>tract ma<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>de

vsurie. To do good, I grau<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t is natural,

gaine by lending money is vnnatural,
wicked &amp; monstruous, what gayne, or

borrowing: for your mind &amp; intente of
lending, must be to helpe, &amp; not to reape
benefyte by hym that gaineth by borro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wing
of your money: for be it your fre<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>d
were like to lose a 100. li. la<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>d, for not pay<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ment
of 300. li. &amp; one vnderstanding hys
neede, &amp; the daunger that hee ys in, do
lend hym 360. li. in money, to saue hys
100 li. la<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>d, that els would bee lost, taking

the whole, &amp; hauing his la<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>d in mortga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ge
for a yere for his own especial profit,
&amp; to y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> vtter vndoing in tyme, of y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> poore

his own co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>moditie, so did he deserue no
thankes at all. And where the gentlema<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
                  <pb n="62" facs="tcp:20795:79"/>
did owe before 360 li. hauing receiued of
the vsurer no more then 300 li. now you
to shewe your selfe a more merciful ma<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>,
will helpe thys gentleman better chea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pe,
after 15 li. in the hundred, criyng out
of that other cutte throte (as in deede,
one vsurer cannot abyde an other, and
euery one will crye out againste his fe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowe
vsurer) and so you will take hys
lande on gods name, for assurance into
your handes, hauing a ful intente with
your selfe to bee Lord of all that he hath
in the end, for except hee paye you when
you see your time, you wil haue it all in
deede. Nowe thys gentleman, hauing
payd 20. li. in the hundred, and to you a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gayne
15. li. hee is to repaye 105. li. ouer &amp;
aboue the 300. li. that hee borrowed for
two yeares onely, his debte rising after
twoo yeres 105. li. aboue the pryncipall.
And nowe for feare the Chauncerie, or
thexchequer, or any other courte should
remedy thys mischiefe, for takynge so
muche land for so lyttle money, you wil
bee contented, that hee shall still paye 15.
li. by the yeare for euery hundreth, tyll
<pb facs="tcp:20795:80"/>
it come to the quarter, or halfe value of
the gentlemans land, and then you will
lend no more, except you may haue all
your money, which hee is euer the lesse
hable to paye, the longer y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> he boroweth
vpon vsurie, and so in effecte, the poore
gentleman loseth hys hundreth pound
lande for euer, for the onely borowinge
of 300. li. in mony, and the forbearing of
the same mony, for fyue or syxe yeres,
or there about. Is thys charitie? is thys
loue? is this godlynes? had it not be<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> bet<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ter
for the gentleman to haue solde hys
la<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>d out right at the first, and so perhaps
to haue receyued 2000 li. and vpward at
the leaste for it, than thus to leese if for
300. li. with the vsurie of fyue or sixe yea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>res?
Thys is the goodnes and naturall
dealinge of vsurers with playne mea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nyng
men, god turne their hartes, and
send them better mindes. But to colour
your doynges the more, you saye fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther,
that thys ouerplus take<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, is neither
against nature, nor against lawe, for yf
it were agai<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>st nature say you, it shoulde
bee forbidden vniuersally, wheras god
<pb n="63" facs="tcp:20795:80"/>
hath geeuen leue to lend money to the
straunger for gayne. I doe answere,
that vsury in his own nature, is vniuer<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>sally
hurtfull and against nature, as all
the morall preceptes are, and yet god
may permit or alowe the vse of it, as he
liked wel, that the Israelites should rob<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>be
the Egyptians, and yet theafte ys
dampnable, and against nature, &amp; vni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uersally
forbidden, where god hath not
allowed of it. To worship ymages, is al<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>so
forbidden, as a thing agaynst god &amp;
nature, and yet god suffered the Cheru
bins to bee erected, &amp; allowed of the bra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sen
serpent, but particular Images per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitted
by God, must not exclude vni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uersall
lawes. And you know, we lyue
by lawes, and not by examples.</p>
               <p>You say further, that thys ouergayne
is a reward geuen, and reward may be
taken for good turnes done. In deede
yf you would stand to the curtesy of the
lender, and not hope for gayne, yf anye
thing came vnloked for, or vnhoped of,
I do thinke you might take some small
present with a safe conscience, but those
<pb facs="tcp:20795:81"/>
rewardes and giftes that you receyue,
are enforced payments, and by former
contracts and couenauntes assured, for
els you would not lend money: &amp; there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
you geeue a wrong name to youre
vsurie gaynes, to call them giftes or re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wardes,
for they are rather compulsorie
debtes, and violent bargaynes made, a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainst
the will altogether (as God kno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>weth)
of the needy and poore borrower:
for in deede necessitie maketh men ofte<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
tymes, both to pray hartely, and to paye
dearely, that woulde els full gladly bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rowe
freely. Yea blame them not, that
beinge dryuen to an extremitie make
greater offers, then they are well hable
to perfourme, or to beare the burthen of
them, because neede maketh the olde
wife to trotte. And what though world<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lie
lawes in some respecte, doe allowe
thys cheuisaunces to auoyd further in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>conueniences,
as single whoredome in
some places is tollerated, y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> men might
kepe their wyues to them selues in bet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
safety: yet god forbiddeth expressie,
aswell the one as the other. And therfore
<pb n="64" facs="tcp:20795:81"/>
where Lawes are made against godds
lawes, they are euermore vngodly and
wicked, what colour or glose soeuer you
doe sett vppon them. And what thoughe
charitie bee cold, what though men will
not lend freely, shal therfore men bee a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowed
or suffered to lend wickedly? Bet<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ter
the world were ouerwhelmed, and
mankind wholie destroyed, rather than
synne should openly bee mainteyned, &amp;
god thereby altogether defaced. And
where you seeme to saye, that godds
lawe doth allowe it, in the nyneteene
chapiter of sainct Luke, I woulde you
and all others committed such heauenly
vsurie, and mocked not at those ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lents,
whiche god lendeth man to bes<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>towe,
for so you shoulde be godds good
seruaunts, yf you bestowed your ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lentes
committed to your charge accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dingly.

common lawe of England, did euer bea<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>re
with vsury, although some statutes
haue tollerated vsurie. I doe know that
kinges in all ages haue banished vsury
out of thys land, aswell before the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quest
as synce, &amp; amongst the rest, king
Edgare did vtterly forbidde all vsurie.
And since the conquest, king Edward
the first, who did send out of this realm,
aswell suche bankers, as came from the
pope Gregorie the tenth, called <hi>Caursini</hi>
and were brought in by one Stephan,
the popes chapleyne, in the time of hys
father kynge Henry the thirde, as all
maner of Jewes at that tyme, with
whome the Realme was merueslously
pestered and oppressed also with vsurie,
theyr proper arte and profession, wher<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>soeuer
they dwell, who surely doe very
well obserue their lawe, for they taking
<pb n="65" facs="tcp:20795:82"/>
al Christians to bee straungers to them
do lende to them for gaine wheresoeuer
they be dwelling, neuer lendyng one to
an other, otherwise then freely, without
hope to receiue any gaine at al of them.
Your argument of plate, is of no force,
for plate weareth &amp; consumeth away, &amp;
commeth oftentimes broken, and is at
his perill that letteth it to hire, &amp; must be
retourned in the same fourme as it was
delyuered: whereas money returneth
without losse in the same kinde onely, &amp;
of the same quantity &amp; value, &amp; hauynge
chaunged the propertie, is at his perill y<hi rend="sup">t</hi>
hath borowed it. And likewise, le<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ding of
diuers coynes of golde &amp; muche money
to a ba<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ker, to receiue the self same form
againe, may bring gain without vsury:
but this is not properly called <hi>Mutuum,</hi>
a le<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ding, but rather <hi>Commodatum,</hi> a let<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting
to hyer, because the property is not
altered, but abideth still in hym that did
let it to hier, who must abide the peril of
it, if any mishappe doe chaunce other<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wyse
then well, without hys faulte that
tooke those goods to hyer.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb facs="tcp:20795:83"/>
Your couenanting and bargayning to
haue parte of the gayne, by your money
lent: with allegation, that you myghte
lose in a bargayne for not hauinge the
said money, doth shewe that you goe a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout
nothinge more, then to cloke vsu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rye,
and to maynteine the practise of it,
by all the shiftinge and colourable mea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nes
you canne. And if you saye, there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
you wyll not lende, because you
maye not make your owne gayne, I
saye vnto you, that then you are an vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mercifull
man, and no seruant of god:
in that you tourne your countenaunce
from him, and will not lende him mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ney,
that beinge an honest man doth of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fer
to put you in good assuraunce for
restitucion. And still you woulde haue
vsury to be a lawfull trade, and for no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thinge
will you agree that vsury should
bee <hi>simpliciter</hi> a sinne, as whoredome,
aduowtry, and theaft are, and yet god
dothe so name it. Agayne, your lending
to an other, to saue his la<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>d, and to bene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fit
your selfe thereby, is no thank to you
at all, but a deuelish and a couetous act,
<pb n="66" facs="tcp:20795:83"/>
directly against god, notwithstandinge
the good whatsoeuer it bee, that youre
neighbour receiueth thereby. And what
though your neighbour bee saued from
famyne, in tyme of extreme dearthe by
lending him corne, then to receyue an
ouerplus at tweluemoneth after, yet
are you wicked that did lend for gayne,
when men had most nede of helpe &amp; free
reliefe. And belike it is you and such o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers,
that are the cause of such dearth:
for nothinge causeth dearth of al things
so muche as vsurye, for by vsury the pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces
of wares are raysed, victualles are
the dearer, and they that would labour
&amp; turn vp the ground, cannot for want:
wheras the welthy folke that haue most
money, liue most idely, w<hi rend="sup">t</hi>out doing any
thing els, but making money of money,
an euill dishe of meate for hym to feede
vpon that is an hungred, &amp; yet surelye a
thing most mete for vsurers to eat vpo<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>.
Yea I wold y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> al vsurers had none other
foode to nourish their earthly bodies w<hi rend="sup">t</hi>
                  <g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>al,
when they were most hungry, and to

Thou dyddest thurste to drynke golde:
which golde the Persians in dede moul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted
and powred into his mouthe, when
he was dead and slain in battaile. Now
Sir I pray you, who speketh more with
charitie? hee that counselleth all men to
lende freely, or he that wylleth all men
to make gayne of their money? Surely
I will say, when you seeke your owne
gayne cheeflye, there is no charitie nor
loue in you at al, although you take but
moderate gaine: for not onely bytynge
vsury, but all vsury is against charitie,
because it is iniurius, sinful &amp; directly a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainst
god, euen as theafte is, bee it ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uer
so lytle. But styll you runne to dy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minyshe
thys offence, wyth shewinge
that a peny vpo<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> 100.<abbr>l.</abbr> biteth not. Wel,
I saye vnto you it is an iniurye, it is a
wrong, it is a thinge forbidden by god,
and therefore a synful deede, saye you
what you wil. Ther is differe<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ce in dede
betwyxte the byting of a dogge, and the
bytynge of a flea, and yet althoughe the
flea doth the lesse harme, yet y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> flea doth
<pb n="67" facs="tcp:20795:84"/>
byte after her kynde, yea and drawethe
blood too. But what a worlde is thys,
that men wyll make synne to bee but a
flea bytynge, when they see gods word
dyrectlye agaynste them? And thus you
runne to the propertie of the word, and
so trye it in diuers languages, whyche
in deede signifieth a bytynge.</p>
               <p>And nowe you tryumphe and say your
pleasure, that a manne maye bee a lytle
naughte, so that hee bee not altogeather
starke naught: wel, god gaue this name
in diuers languages after this sort, that
suche vyce myghte bee the more abhor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red.
For as spoylynge is forbydden, so
is pyckyng also, and although in mans
iudgement, the one bee lesse then the o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther,
yet before god hee is a transgres<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sour
of the whole lawe, and as gyltye
of death and dampnation that hath pye<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ked,
as he that hath spoyled. And so in
vsurye it is to bee sayde, aswel hee shall
dye the deathe and not lyue that hathe
taken lytle, as hee that hathe taken a
greate deale, because the lawe of god
hath forbydden al maner of vsury what
<pb facs="tcp:20795:85"/>
soeuer, and wyll not in anye wise that
anye thynge shall bee taken ouer and a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>boue
the pryncipall lone. For gods will
is, that lendynge shoulde bee vsed, as it
ought to bee, that is to saye, freely with
out hoape of any gayne at al, that chari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie
thereby might be the oftener excerci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed
betwixt man &amp; man. But you ca<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> not
abide this charitable dealyng, &amp; therfore
comming to the greeke and latin word,
whiche bothe doe signifie a birthe, you
make a iest of the lytle pretye babe that
100.<abbr>l.</abbr> bringeth foorthe but a bare peny.
Wel, I wyll tell you, howe litle soeuer
you thynk it to be, it is the babe of dark<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse,
and it is inoughe to bringe you to
hell fier. You measure things by the va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lue,
and not by the breach of gods law.
Adam and Eue thought it a small fault
to eate of the forbidde<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> frute in paradise,
and yet you see what followed of it.</p>
               <p>They lost euerlyuing ioy by it, they felt
the smarte of this miserable world, and
were banished out of gods presence, and
all theire posteritie after them foreuer,
had not Christ of his mercye in the ful<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nes
<pb n="68" facs="tcp:20795:85"/>
of tyme, been our Redemer and ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peased
the wrathe of oure heauenlye fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther.
So that the thynge it selfe, is not
so muche to be respected, as the doynge
of it against gods will and commaun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deme<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t,
who forbiddeth al sinne. And al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>though
it maye be thought, that I am
somewhat nice and minse the matter o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uer
finely: yet let men remember what
they ought to doe, and what god requi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reth
of them, &amp; I doubt not, but they wil
think that I haue said litle inough. And
now you returne to your three sortes of
me<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>: vnto the which I say vnto you, y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> in
gods presence &amp; before his maiesty there
is no respect of persons, that are of one
faith, and as wel do you commit vsurye
in lendynge to a king for gaine, as you
do in lending to a poore wretched man,
although you do not bite so much y<hi rend="sup">•</hi> one
as the other, because vsury is forbidden
in al degrees, say what you wil. Neither
are circumstance, time, place, nor perso<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
to be considered in lending for vsury, no
more the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> in the very nature of robbing:
Mary, if you would le<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>d frely it were an
<pb facs="tcp:20795:86"/>
other matter, for then I would wyshe,
and it is reason also, that euery man had
the chiefest regarde to the poore and ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dye
person. Your allegacion of those
textes: Geue to euery body that asketh,
and praye euer, and pray wythout ceas<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>singe,
and be alwaies glad, doe nothing
hynder, but that all vsurye is dampna<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble:
for althoughe those textes are to be
compassed within certain boundes, and
haue their lymytacion by circumstaun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces
as reason woulde, and gods worde
in other places dothe verye well allowe
thereof, yet all manner of vsurye is al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wayes
euill, be it neuer so lytle, because
the lorde god hathe playnelye and ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preslye
sayde it, and that the contrarye
cannot otherwise be gathered in scryp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture.
And so I saye of all your other
textes that you doe afterwards inferre,
theye haue theire proper interpretacion
and restrainte: and yet taking ouerplus
for lending, it is alwaies synful, because
there is noe interpretacyon nor confe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rence,
of any text in scripture to make it
otherwise. But still to maynteyne your
<pb n="69" facs="tcp:20795:86"/>
argume<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t, you say that men do not take
money for lending, but because they lose
their gaine in the meane season, y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> theye
do lend, &amp; sustein losse &amp; harme perhaps,
for that their money is out of their ha<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ds.
Thus I see you seeke to mocke w<hi rend="sup">t</hi> god,
for I say plainelye vnto you, you ought
not for any respect put your moneye to
gaine by lendinge it. But accordinge to
your profession, you bring out your sta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tutes
of 37. <hi>Henrici.</hi> 8. where vsury is tol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lerated,
if it be not aboue. 10.<abbr>l.</abbr> in the hu<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
                  <g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dred,
&amp; this statute you do lyke wel, but
the statute of. 5. Edw. 6. you like not at
al, wher vsurie is altogether forbidden.
Well I am cleane contrary to you: for
I like king Ed. statut best of al, because
it is agreeyng to gods word, and I can
not in any wise allow or like king Hen<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ries
statute, because it is againste gods
worde to haue any such toleratio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> in any
Christian common weale, no more then
theafte, aduowtery, or murder are to be
winked at. On you go still, &amp; put thys
case. You haue a great adue<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ture beyond
the Seas, &amp; stande in hazard of your re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turne,
<pb facs="tcp:20795:87"/>
as you thinke: as who doth not?
You sai thus to your fre<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>d. If your goods
come home safe, you shalbe in good case
to help a gentleman, or your neighbor
at a pynche, Marye otherwise, if by mis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hap
your goods do perish, then are you
cast so behynde hand, that you shal sca<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t
be hable to holde vppe your head, muche
lesse be hable to helpe others. Therefore
yf your frende (say you) will beare wyth
suche losses vppon your aduenture, as
may casually happen after the rate of 12.
or 14. in the hundred, for so muche as he
shall borowe, then will you bee conten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted
to deale w<hi rend="sup">t</hi> hym, otherwise you will
keepe somewhat in stoare against foule
weather, &amp; not depart with that, whiche
you haue in assured possessyon to haue
nothing for your labor. This (as I do re<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>member)
is your speach, wherunto I do
a<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>swer. If you wil aswel take nothing at
al, if no losse doe happen to you in your
aduenture, as bee assured to haue some<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing,
yf any mishap do chaunce, &amp; deale
plainly in your doinges w<hi rend="sup">t</hi>out fraude or
couin: then I do think it is no vsury for
<pb n="70" facs="tcp:20795:87"/>
you to make such a bargain, because the
gain aswel as y<hi rend="sup">•</hi> losse are both vncertein.
After this you put foorthe a matter as
though it weare a pitiful case. A wydow
hath left her by her husba<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>d. 500.<abbr>l.</abbr> in mo<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ney,
&amp; for sixe small children that cannot
help the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>selues 200.<abbr>l.</abbr> for euery one, to be
payd vnto them when they be of yeres,
&amp; you say what shal y<hi rend="sup">•</hi> wydow do? How
shal these children bee kept: neyther she
nor her children hauing any trade, to en<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>crease
or maintain their substance. And
therfore what other thi<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>g should be don,
but to let out their moneye for reasona<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble
gain, rather then the wydow &amp; chyl<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren
should perishe, &amp; their goods waste
awaye? I do aunswer still, that noe vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lawfull
trade is to be vsed, to aduaunce
welfare. Neyther doe I allowe of your
order in London for orphanes money,
because it hath no grounde vppon gods
woorde, but rather vtterlye forbidden:
for god hathe no regarde to these circu<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
                  <g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>staunces
and pitifull cases, but wylleth
all men to lyue as he hath commaunded
by lawful trade, and in his feare. And if
<pb facs="tcp:20795:88"/>
the vsurers money is dampnable which
is bestowed for redeeming of captyues
from the infidelles, and marying of fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>therlesse
maydens: what shall wee saye
of this money, whiche is geeuen for the
maynteyna<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ce of orphanes &amp; widowes?
Is not the case all one? And is there noe
way I praye you for orphanes and wy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dowes
to thriue by, but onelye with go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ynge
alwayes into the deuils dungeon,
and seekyng out these croked corners of
wicked ockre and dampnable vsurye?
Is there noe way to be vsed by frends,
with buyinge or sellyng to doe good to
this widowe or her yong babes? Is ther
no ferme to bee bought for moneye? Is
there no occupying that will doe good,
but onely flatte vsurye, a thinge so vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>knowen
heretofore, as nothinge lesse
knowne, and being knowen, so abhor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red,
as noe man coulde abide them that
were knowen manifest vsurers.</p>
               <p>Nowe lorde god haue mercy vppon vs,
what a worlde is this?</p>
               <p>You put an other case of a seruing man
that hath no trade to liue by, because he
<pb n="71" facs="tcp:20795:88"/>
hath been brought vppe onely to wayte
vpon a gentleman, and to doe nothinge
els, and because his master is dead, and
hee can gette no seruice to liue by, you
will in anye wise, that whereas he hathe
a lytle money lying by him, he may liue
by the gaine thereof, by puttinge it oute
for tyme. I do aunswer, that he oughte
not so to do, because god would not haue
him so to doe. And for this matter I wil
allege vnto you Saint Augustines say<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>inge
vppon the psalme in thys wyse.
<hi>Audet etiam faenerator dicere &amp;c.</hi>
                  <note place="margin">August.</note> The v<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>surer
also presumeth to say,<note place="margin">Psalme. 128.</note> I haue none
other trade to liue by: so may the strong
theefe saye when he is taken by y<hi rend="sup">•</hi> throte
wyth the maner; so maye the burgeler
saye, when he is laide hande on, in com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mytting
burglarye, so maye the bawde
saye, that sellethe yonge maydes to bee
common harlottes, so may the sorcerer
saye, when he or shee enchaunteth euill
things, and selle their enchauntments.
And whatsoeuer like thyng wee should
go about to forbid, they might all aun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>swer,
they had none other waye to lyue
<pb facs="tcp:20795:89"/>
by, and to finde them selues, as thoughe
that this were not chieflye to bee puny<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>shed
in them, because they haue learned
the arte or occupacion of lewdnes to get
their lyuing by it, and wil thereby feede
them selues, whereby they offend hym,
by whom wee al are fedde. Thus farre
Saint Augustine.</p>
               <p>For your Shipwrack, thus I aunswer.
That wher you pay ten in the hu<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>dreth,
poore folke shall fare the worse, for whe<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
you make your sale, they shall paye for
your vsurye to the vttermost, and your
suite obteyned, you shallbee aunswered
your money and your vsury, to the last
farthing by them that shall deale wyth
you: and so poore folke shall alwayes
be racked, and the common weale here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by
shall feele great smart thorough this
wicked vsury. You say farther, if one de<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>posite
his money to an other man, and
the same man doth encrease it, without
your knowledge, that then it is reason
you shoulde haue the gayne. I do grant
this to be true, &amp; verye reasonable also:
For as master Ciuilian knoweth better
<pb n="72" facs="tcp:20795:89"/>
then I doe, the moneye that was put in
an other mans hand to keepe, is his that
did deposite it, and not his that had the
keeping of it. So that if the moneye had
been lost by some great mishappe with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out
anye playne negligence, or knowen
follye of the keeper, the owner shoulde
haue borne the losse, and not the keper
of the sayd money. A good lesson to tea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>che
hym and others, that put suche men
in trust, to make choyse of a better here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>after.
Then if the losse should be his that
was the owner, it is good reason, and
a thynge also agreeable to nature, that
the gayne likewise shoulde be hys, that
was lorde of that moneye, whereof the
encrease dyd growe, and wythoute the
whiche anye gayne coulde not els haue
been made at all.</p>
               <p>But styll to helpe your selfe, you bryng
in a croked questyon, and caste beyond
the Moone, askynge: what if the debtor
shoulde fayle, as manye tymes theye
doe, and then all ys gonne: weare yt
not reason to bee assured of some gayne
before hande, for feare of suche harme?
<pb facs="tcp:20795:90"/>
I do aunswer, that you wilbe sure to do
harme, vpon the casualtie of harme, that
might happen, which is vngodly in you
to doe, for that you witting and willing
do offend against your own conscience.
At last you come to breaking of daies &amp;
forfeyture of obligacions, and thynke
you haue wrong if you may not take v<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sury,
for wantinge your moneye a mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neth,
two or three after the day: I do say
vnto you, as I haue saide before, that in
this case you may lawfullye aske inte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rest,
and god forbid but you shoulde bee
considered for y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> time, because you haue
susteined losse through breache of coue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>na<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t
&amp; are dysappoynted thereby to your
great hinderaunce, as it maye fall out.
And no reason it is that you should lose
for an others benefit, and feele smart of
your owne goods, when an other shall
repe profit by it against your own good
will, for your great good will erst she<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wed
vnto hym before. Neyther can this
be any vsury at al, because ther was no
bargaine for any ouerplus to be had for
the receipt of that money, if it were paid
<pb n="73" facs="tcp:20795:90"/>
at the daye, but onely a forfeyture of a
bond, for not keeping touche, the bene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fites
whereof, the lawe doth cast vppon
euery body, where couenauntes be not
perfourmed: and good reason it is, that
it should so bee, so the bondes bee reaso<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nable,
and the forfeyture not excessiue.
At the last you come to a rate, &amp; woulde
in any wise haue ten or twelue vpo<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> the
hu<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>dred, eyther appoynted or tollerated,
aswell for common benefite, in dealing
betwixt man and man, as also for stop<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ping
the couetousnes of greedy cormo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rantes,
whose insatiable myndes no co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
                  <g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uenient
gaine will satisfie, and thys you
thinke very good for all partes. But I
am not of your mynde, because god is
against you, and therfore I doe abhorre
all toleracion of vsurie: much lesse will
I euer yeld to any allowing of it at all,
but rather I would wishe, that there
were as straite lawes to forbid vsurie,
as there bee to forbid felony or murder,
that charitie the rather by thys meanes
myght abounde vniuersally, and men
myght lend to all men freely, as god
<pb facs="tcp:20795:91"/>
hath commaunded, &amp; nature requireth,
for surelye I doe thinke, that charitye
waxeth coulde in thys age, for want of
knowledge, not but that preachers dea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>le
with thys matter, as much as with a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny

not perfetlye knowe, or at the leastwise
are not fully persuaded, that all vsurie
is synne, as theaft, murder, and other
offenses are, wythout blaunchyng or
te<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>pering of it at all, for no doubte, yf me<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
did knowe yt in deede to bee so heynous
a synne as it is: I doe thinke verely, yf
there were any feare of God in them at
all, they would not bee so euill as they
are nowe, nor so harde harted, to with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>drawe
theire christian charitie, from
theire brethren as they doe, and to run<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ne
hedlonge into so bottomlesse a gulfe
of all wickednes and abhominacion,
the true knowledge and consideracion
of whith offense, I pray god, may enter
into all mens harts, that they maye the
rather amend theire liues, thorough cha<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ritable
dealing, with theire deare bre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thren
in Christ, to the hyghe honor of
<pb n="74" facs="tcp:20795:91"/>
god, and to the great aduauncement of
hys moste holy will.</p>
               <p>And now to you, master merchant, I
pray you hartely, remember god in the
middest of your occupiyng, &amp; deale not
willyngly againste hys wyll. Yf one
should call you theefe or murtherer, I
knowe you wold bee very angry, and
yet hee that proueth you an vsurer, ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>keth
you ten times woorse the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> a theefe,
&amp; as euill as a murtherer, yea thys will
I saye, yt weare better to winke at a hu<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
                  <g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>dreth
pickpurses in London, and lesse
harme should they do, then to suffer the
wringing of twentie knowne vsurers,
for a man may keepe hys purse fro<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> pic<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kynge
and cutting, and yf one shoulde
lose it, there were but so much gonne, &amp;
a man would bee wyser afterward, and
others would take heede by hys exa<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ple:
but from an vsurer, none can bee ridde
that hath nede, beinge once entred: for
hee will not leaue a man, till hee haue
gnawin hym, euen to the very bones,
that hee is not woorth the ground hee
goeth on. But to your reasons, you saye
<pb facs="tcp:20795:92"/>
yf the assurance of gayne bee taken a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>waye,
there can bee no trade nor bar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gaining
amongst men at all. Sir, I doe
not see that any man forbiddeth you to
make gaine of your own lawfully: Ma<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ry
to bee a tyme seller, to gayne for da<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>yes,
monethes and yeares, and to make
the sunne shyninge, which god sendeth
so freely vnto vs to be the frute of your
occupiyng, and to make mony of mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny,
for the very acte of lending: these
dealinges I do saye, are most abomina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble
in the sight of god and ma<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>. Yea with
what face or countenaunce I pray you,
can we looke vpon the sunne, that do so
abuse such a light sent vnto vs fro<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> god?
Or how can we number our dayes and
yeres with a cleare conscience, that doe
thus moste horriblye defile good tyme
with our lewde dealyngs. For wheras
wee shoulde the rather loue one an o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther,
seing god doth loue vs all, and sen<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>deth
thys bryghtnes to shyne ouer vs
for all our comfortes and welfare, and
many fayre yeres, to enioye gods bles<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sings
vppon erth: we turne the benefite
<pb n="75" facs="tcp:20795:92"/>
of thys lyght, and thys tyme, to the vt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
vndoing of thousands our deare bre<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>thren,
makynge the sunne shinynge,
and continuance of yeares, dayly to en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crease
our cofers moste vnlawfullye, to
the decrease of all others, that haue to
deale with vs: For surely, thys kynd of
lendinge for gayne, is the vndoing of
all occupiers, and the distructiou of tra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>de:
because me<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> that buy deere, must sell
deare, or els beare the losse themselues,
as they often doe, and so are vndone in
the ende. Besydes thys, there is a great
inequalitie, betwirt the lender and the
borrower, wherein the iust proporcion
of mans conscience ys broken: for why
should one haue more for hys gooddes
than they are woorth, or rather why
shoulde one haue for nothinge, more
than hys pryncipall? For when I haue
borrowed mony, the property is in me,
and I am lord of it, and so much as com<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>meth
to my ha<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>des in money or goodes,
I oughte in ryghte to repaye the value
of yt at a tyme appointed, and no more
than it was woorth at the tyme of de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liuering.
<pb facs="tcp:20795:93"/>
For yf one take more than
hys pryncipall, in respect of tyme, he
taketh that, which is none of hys, which
is playne theafte, and a deede contrary
to nature, yea it is both agaynst gods
lawe, and mannes lawe to. Nowe the
harme that ensueth herof, is very great,
for the most parte of men are hereby in
suche sorte oppressed, as the welth of the
world commeth to the handes of a fewe
ydle wretched caterpillers, that doe no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thinge
in the world but eate vpp whole
townes, countries and kyngdomes. It
is written.<note place="margin">Sap. 11.</note> Sap. 11. Thou O god hast or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deyned
all thinges in measure, nomber
and weight, now then, he that will not
deale iustly, according to measure, num<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ber,
&amp; weight, y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> same ma<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> is not worthy
to lyue vpon earthe, for that hee doth
wounde hys owne conscience witting<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lie,
offendeth god greuouslie, and brea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>keth
the lawe wickedlie. And what mea<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>sure
I pray you, doth the vsurer keepe,
that taketh more than he layed out? for
one pecke lent, twoo, for hys owne
agayne, more than hys own agayne,
<pb n="76" facs="tcp:20795:93"/>
by a quarter, yea some times, more then
halfe. For a pecke of wheat le<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t, a bushel
at the yeres ende: And what reason is
thys, that for one pecke lente, a man
should haue more than one peck again,
which was hys owne before, for more
than a mans one, no man should haue
by all lawe of ryght, conscience, and iu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stice.
And where you saye, that men wil
not lende freely, and therefore it were
necessarie, men shoulde bee suffered to
lende for gayne, lest otherwise the more
parte of men shoulde sterue for wante:
Firste I saye, yf euery man would liue
in hys trade and calling, as hee oughte
to doe, in the feare of god lawfullye,
there woulde bee moneye ynough, and
men shoulde not wante of other mens
plentye that lyue so godlye. Agayne I
do saye, this is a pitiful hearing amonst
christians, and a great token of vnbe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>life
and gentilytie, when we are so vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>willing
to lende freely, seyng god hath
commaunded vs so expresly. And surely
yf we lyued, as wee ought to doe, there
woulde bee free lendinge, and great
<pb facs="tcp:20795:94"/>
plentie of money euery where. And tou<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ching
the necessitie you speake of, that
men should therfore be suffered to lend
for gayne, lest otherwise the most parte
of them should starue for wante: I tell
you plainely, you speake in this behalf,
rather like a man, that can better dea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>le
with drosse and money, than iudge
of god reason, or anye godlynes at all:
For by such your speache, couetousnes
shoulde bee holden for good, because
the ryche will not bee liberall, and ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uowtrie
shoulde bee estemed equall to
chastitye, because many men will not
forbeare theire neighbours wyfe. But
sir, both you and wee all, ought to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sider
not what is donne, but what of
ryghte oughte to bee donne, &amp; so farre
to deale, as wee maye, and are allowed
to doe by god, and good lawes. And I
saye further, yf vsury were felonye,
and the prince entituled to the offen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dors
goodes, and no fauour shewed,
there woulde bee store of money, the ra<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ther,
through the great occupiyng that
men woulde vse, hauinge goddes bles<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sing
<pb n="77" facs="tcp:20795:94"/>
and ynough, when all vnlawfull
tradinge were vtterly forbidden, vpon
suche paynes. Neyther oughte men to
make the most of theire owne, that they
can, as you saye, otherwise then by
lawe they maye: for soe, the euill wo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man
maye saye, that because her bodye
is her own, shee maye doe with it what
shee list, and company with whome she
pleaseth for her best profit and auayle,
wheras god hath commaunded, that
euery body should keepe hys owne ves<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sell
pure, vnto holynes, because we are
all the images of god, created to hys li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kenes.
And thus beinge forbidden to
deale vnlawfullye, yf doth not followe
that buiynge and selling are by thys
meanes taken from you, nor yet ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chaunging
one thing for an other, bar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red
any thinge at all. But to lend con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary
to the nature of lending, whiche
shoulde bee free, and to make an other
contracte, than euer god or nature diui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed,
to aduaunce youre gayne thereby
moste vngodlie: surely suche kynde of
dealing, I must needes saye, is vtterlie,
<pb facs="tcp:20795:95"/>
and cheefely forbydden, vpon payne of
dampnacion. But to haue youre vnlaw<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>full
doynges borne, which all you al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lege,
that you doe lend to the prince, in
tyme of neede, and that the nobility and
gentlemen are much ayded by your len<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>dinge,
and that neede wilbee alwayes,
and men shall euer haue neede: I will
aunswere you, cursed bee that lending,
that maketh y<hi rend="sup">•</hi> borrower goe a begging,
that vndoeth the state, that destroyethe
nobilitie and gentlemen, that dryuethe
the prince, to seeke ayde of her subiectes
by parliament, to pay her debtes. For it
is you vsurers, and none other, that
bringe the prince behynd hand, with ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kinge
twelue and fowrteene in the hun<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>dred.
A straunge people, that take vsury
of their prynce, beyng theire assured de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fense,
theire louinge nurse, and theire
chiefe safegarde. But you will saye,
your merchandize, and your occupiyng
shall decay, if youre money he oute of
your handes, &amp; therfore you must, for
very necessity make mony of your mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny,
or els haue it in your own vse, other
<pb n="78" facs="tcp:20795:95"/>
wyse you cannot liue. Then I see well,
you wil not losse, for y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> prince to gayne,
whatsoeuer charges her maiestie suftey<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>neth,
as of late her maiesty did, in sup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pressing
those godlesse traitors, &amp; Roma<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>niste
rebels of the North, to her immor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tal
fame: you still wilbee gainers vpon
the queenes coste &amp; expe<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ces, vnnaturall
subiectes I must call you, &amp; vnmercifull
citezens, that wil haue such certayn gay<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ne,
vpo<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> mony so well bestowed, for the
welfare &amp; safety, not onely of all youre
goodes, but of all youre lyues And here
you make a great matter of youre len<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding,
others haue le<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t sir, aswell as you,
&amp; more the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> you to, &amp; yet were they lew<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>de
men notwithsta<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ding, &amp; banished the
Realme for their vsury. The Jewes I
meane in king Edward the first dayes,
dwelling in the olde Jurie, did lend in a
greater quantity, &amp; better cheape to the
kynge, than the Englishe men did. But
what tha<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ke is y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> to the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, or to you either,
that le<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>d vngodly for gaine &amp; profit one<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly.
And where you talke of nede &amp; wa<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t,
that want must be, &amp; men shall alwaies
<pb facs="tcp:20795:96"/>
haue neede: I doe assure you, in myne
opinio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, thys your vnmercifull vsury, is
the cheefest cause of all wa<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t &amp; nede. And
shal I saye as I thinke? It was one of y<hi rend="sup">e</hi>
greatest causes of the last rebellio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, next
after their horrible lothinge of holsome
religion: for had not men payd vnmer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cifully,
for that which they borrowed, &amp;
growne therby so depe in debt, through
vsury, that they were not hable to paye
theire creditours: they would neuer so
desperately, as I think, haue withdrawe<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
themselues, some of the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> I meane, from
the obedience of theire souerayne ladye
and prynce. And therefore I say, theire
neede, which did growe through vsury,
was after a sorte, y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> cause of their naugh<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ty
doyngs. And of thys, they may tha<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ke
some of you gredy merchants, &amp; others,
whome no reasonable gayne, otherwise
can suffise, but still are heaping gayne
vpon gayne, thys waye &amp; that waye de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uowringe
noble men, and gentelmen,
euen to the very hard bones, till theire
goodes and landes be quyte and cleane
made awaye, and they, as boyd of wel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fare,
<pb n="79" facs="tcp:20795:96"/>
as you are of honesty. You cal this
City, the quenes chamber: yf you co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nue
still as you doe, you will perhaps
turne it to a cha<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ber in deede, yea a cham<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ber
onely, &amp; no Citie, &amp; a very smal row
me for Engla<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ds welfare. God bee mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cifull
vnto vs, and graunte charitie and
loue amongst vs, that wee may saye, as
sainct Ambrose sayeth of Theodosius
the emperour,<note place="margin">Ambros. in morte<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> Theod.</note> in a funeral sermo<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>. Who
feinyng the sayde emperour to bee as<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ked
of the Aungels in heauen, what hee
dyd vpon earthe, made the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> aunswere,
no more but thys, <hi>Dilexi,</hi> I loued, which
loue in deede, is the fulfillyng of the
Lawe. And so I pray god, wee all may
make that reckennyng, when we shall
come to that generall audite in the lat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
daye, that euery one maye saye truly
and vnfaynedly <hi>Dilexi,</hi> I haue loued.
But you saye, thexchange is lawfull,
and that trade, you do vse moste com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monly,
in le<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ding and putting out youre
money, as it goeth vsually in the stree<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>te,
and thys you saye, no man can misli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ke:
I do answere: Would god you vsed
<pb facs="tcp:20795:97"/>
thexchange, as yt should be vsed in dee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>de,
and made it not a cloake for vsurie,
geuing a good name to a naughty dede
for as you doe vse it now, it is none o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther,
then flatt vsurie, colorably cloked,
vnder the name of exchaunge. I cannot
deny but thexcha<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ge is good, whe<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> euery
man helpeth hys eauen christian, to ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ue
the same value in an other place, dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bursed
to hym here at home, and deale
so truly with his neighbour, as he wold
that hys neyghbour should deale wyth
hym selfe in the like case. But thexchan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ge
is now vsed onely for gaine to them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selues,
and not for good to others, to be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nefite
themselues chefelie, and not to
helpe theire neighbours neede. Yf mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chants
weare as they should bee: that is
to saye, freshe occupiers, and aduentu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rouse
dealers in other countryes, like
merchauntes, they myghte serue prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces
necessities, and furnishe theire Am<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bassadors,
with value for value, at an
equall rate, wythout making merchan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dizes
of money, the most diuelish diuise,
that euer was inuented by man, to vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>doe
<pb n="80" facs="tcp:20795:97"/>
all states and countries. The excha<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
                  <g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ge
is then offensiue, when more is recei<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ued
in respecte of tyme, than was deliue<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>red,
and therfore to speake how the ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>change
ryseth or fauleth, is nothing els
to saye, but that good men must bee for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ced
to paye, according to the couetous
mans desyre, that regrateth all golde &amp;
syluer into hys hands, to make a scarse<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie,
and holding the masse in his power,
will not let go any parte of yt, wythout
excessiue retorne, and so cause men to
pay in respect of the moneth, more than
they should doe to receyue vpon y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> sight,
w<hi rend="sup">t</hi>in three or fowr daies after y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> excha<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ge
is made. And I pray you, how is measu<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>re,
weight &amp; nomber kept in thys kynde
of dealinge, excepte you will saye, y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> ty<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>me
must be rekened as a parte of youre
gayne, whiche dealinge is vnlawfull,
and forbidden by god. Therefore lett
euery man geue value for value, pound
for pound, ounce for ounce, as thynges
are woorth, and then iust proporcion is
kepte, as it shoulde bee, and euerye
<pb facs="tcp:20795:98"/>
mans necessitie serued a ryghte with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out
vnlawfull gayning, in respecte of
tyme. As for example. Yf fowere oun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces
of English moneye, whiche is one
pound weight, or twe<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ty shillings tale,
bee worth 23. S. 4. <abbr>d.</abbr> flemysh in pounde
weight, or pound tale, then let thexcha<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
                  <g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ge
haue so muche and no lesse in Flaun<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ders,
and let hym not paye any thynge
ouer and aboue, for any respecte, either
of tyme, charges, or for anye other con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sideracion
whatsoeuer. But you saye,
that yf trading for money vpon money
bee a hurtefull thing, and an offence to
god, the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> is buiyng and selling also vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lawfull.
God forbidde. And thys is my
reason. In buiyng &amp; selling, your gay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ne
is not alwayes certayne, as it is in
vsurie: for he that buieth lande thys day
for fiue hundreth poundes, shall not al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>waies
be sure to gaine a hu<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>dreth pou<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ds
by the bargayne, but sometyme hee lo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>seth,
and can not haue hys own againe,
wheras the vsurer is alwayes suer to
gaine, whosoeuer loseth, hauing good &amp;
sufficient assurance alwayes for hys
<pb n="81" facs="tcp:20795:98"/>
money. I grau<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> euery ma<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> may make
the best of that, whiche hee hathe in hys
owne possession, by lawefull trade and
iust dealynge, as the lawes of god and
manne haue ordeyned: but alwayes I
woulde wishe, that charitie shoulde bee
vsed euer in bargayns. And in any wise
I woulde haue thys vngodlye and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uilyshe
deuise to gette money with mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ney,
to bee vtterly banyshed, a thinge so
mo<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>strous in nature, as if thorns should
beare figges, or stones shoulde brynge
foorthe liuelye creatures. But what
dothe not the vnsaciable greedynesse of
man deuyse, and imagyne wyth hym<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>self,
to encrease wealth, and to heape vp
ryches togeather? And especyally what
do couetous merchants leaue vnsought
or vndone, to get goods into their han<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>des?
a kynde of vermine so wedded to
scrape vppe money, that many of them
oftentymes falle oute with the dearest
frindes they haue, for the value of a pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny.
And rather then they will yeeld wil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>linglye
to anye losse, they will take such
paynes, that all worldlye wealth is not
<pb facs="tcp:20795:99"/>
so much worth. I pray god y<hi rend="sup">•</hi> some of the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
do not prefer money before god &amp; theire
own soule health. I haue read in an olde
writer vpon y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> law, y<hi rend="sup">•</hi> thinketh it a thing
almost impossible for these worldly mer<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>chants
to be good christians. Belike hee
speketh it be cause merchants are co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>mo<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
                  <g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
geuen to vsury, &amp; sunken so deepe in
couetousnes, y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> theye are drowned in it.
Which vice in dede, is y<hi rend="sup">•</hi> roote of al euil,

but rather being most miserable &amp;
hu<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>gry, by a certain strange gredy desire
to hepe them together, are swalowed vp
w<hi rend="sup">t</hi> the vnsaciablenesse therof, &amp; cast hed<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>long

you are a professor in them bothe.

            <p>YOu looke for more at my hande, then

muche to confute any of your opinions
expreslye, although I maye incidently,
<pb facs="tcp:20795:101"/>
&amp; by the way touch some thing perhaps,
that hath been said. And yet thus much
I saye vnto you, you shall rather heare
what I haue read &amp; gathered of others,
then knowe mine opinion directly, tou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ching
the very precisenes of al vsury, so
long as mine oration shal continue, al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>though

In the meane season, I praye you haue

into fiue or sixe seuerall partes.</p>
            <p>1 And first I wil shew what vsurye is,
&amp; where, that wee may know certaynly

            <p>2 Agayne, I wyl shew that the same

               <pb facs="tcp:20795:102"/>
6 Lastlye I doe mynde vppon farther
conference, &amp; priuate debating to shewe
myne opynion, what is expedient to bee
donne at this time. Usurie commethe of
the latin worde <hi>Vsura,</hi> and according to
the nature thereof, it is called so, of the
vse that men haue of thynges borowed.
It is called in greeke a byrthe, because
that moneye bringeth moneye.</p>
            <p>In the Hebrue tongue, it is called a by<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting,
because they that borowe and pay
ouer and aboue the principall, more the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
they borowed, in the ende shal be bitten,
with suche want and penurye, that the
byting of a serpent, or venemous beast,
cannot bee more hurtfull to a mans bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dye,
then the borowing of moneye, for
gayne is hurtful to a mans welfare and
possessions: For as poyson wastethe the
bodye, so dothe vsurie consume a mans
goods. Thus muche for the propertie of
the worde, as in effecte hathe ben sayde
before.</p>
            <p>Nowe,<note place="margin">14 q. 3. vsura.</note> touchynge the definition of vsu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rie
according to the scholemen, it is said
to bee againe that commethe thoroughe
<pb n="85" facs="tcp:20795:102"/>
lendinge by couenaunt, or by chiefe en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tent
or purpose. As for example, I doe
lende to receiue more then I layde out,
I doe couenaunt to haue more, and my
chiefe purpose in laying out my moneye
is, by my principal to e<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>crease my stock,
and hoape by my lending, to receiue an
ouer plus: for where these three thyngs
concurre togeather, lending, gayne, &amp; a
pryncipall or chiefe purpose to encrease
welfare, in suche dealings, vsury is al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>waies
moste certainly knowen.<note place="margin">Imola in Cle ment. 1. de v<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>suris. 19. coll. vers. querit hic pet. de an char in repet. reg. &amp; pecca ti venia in. 1. 9. principali.

doe define vsurie thus.</p>
            <p>Usurye is whatsoeuer is taken for lone
aboue the principall.</p>
            <p>Usurie is a certayne gayne due, or ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>acted
for lendinge, or by couenant agre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
vpon. S. Barnard saieth, that vsurie
is a lawefull thefte, or a thefte in lawe,
the Ciuil lawe it selfe, or rather the Em<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>peror
Iustinians statute, tellyng before
hand what is entended, that is to robbe
by order &amp; sufferance of lawe. Usurye is
also saide, to be the price of tyme, or of
the delaying, or forbearing of moneye.
<hi>Melancthon</hi> dothe define vsurye in thys
<pb facs="tcp:20795:103"/>
sorte.</p>
            <p>Usurye or fenorye is a gayne demaun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded
aboue y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> principal,<note place="margin">Bernardus in libro de cura rei familiaris Gl. in L. in fraude<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> ss. fis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>calibus F. de iure fisci, Io<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>an. de prat. in L. qui procu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rator de pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cur.</note> onely for the be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nefite
or pleasure shewed in lendynge.
Wherein mee thinketh <hi>Melancthon</hi> hath
very well and playnelye sayde, what is
vsurye: so that, whosoeuer lendethe hys
money, or putteth out the same to haue
gayne onelye for the verye lone of the
said money, is an vsurer vndoubtedly,
and suche a one as ought by good lawes
to be punished. So that by this definiti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on,
euery receiuing aboue the principal,
is not vsury. As if I doe borowe 100.<abbr>l.</abbr> of
a merchant that tradeth and occupiethe
and the merchant doe freely lende mee
the same money for a yeare, afterward
yf the merchant do proue vnto mee, that
the want of his saide 100.<abbr>l.</abbr> was greatlye
hurtful vnto him, I ought to make him
a recompence. And suche allowaunce of
his losse or hinderaunce, ought not to be
counted vnlawfull and vsurye: when
one dothe not bargaine to receyue more
then he lent, only for y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> le<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>dyng, althou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ghe
the borower was not any time anyt
<pb n="86" facs="tcp:20795:103"/>
euident or effectual hinderer of his gain
or welfare. But of this kinde of le<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>dings
and other like, we will talke more here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>after
in a more apte place. I truste you
knowe by these fewe woordes, what v<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>surie
is. It foloweth, that I shew, wher<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in
vsurye is occupied.</p>
            <p>And I say first, there cannot bee any v<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>surye,
where lending is not: and le<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ding
consisteth vpon three things, that is nu<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
               <g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber,
weight, and measure. As for exam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple,
money, leade, corne, the first is nu<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
               <g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bred,
the seconde is weyghed, the thirde
is measured, and so likewise of all other
thynges that are in such sorte vttered.</p>
            <p>Lendynge moreouer is sayd to be, whermy
goods are made thine, called in latin
<hi>Mutuum,</hi> that is to say, mine, thine, and
so thou arte lorde and owner, and haste
the possession of them, that thou mayest
dispose of them as shal like thee best, res<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>toringe
vnto mee agayne, not the very
selfe same thynge in hys owne propre
nature, without alteracion or chaunge
of the shape, fourme or quality (for so it
weare no lending, but a letting to hier)
<pb facs="tcp:20795:104"/>
but so muche in value of the same kind:
as if I shoulde lende my frende 100.<abbr>l.</abbr> in
moneye of diuers coynes, hee may paye
the value in money at the yeares ende,
although not the verye selfe same &amp; pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per
coyne. And so likewise I maye saye
of corne, oyle, wyne, spyce, leade, tinne
brasse, or anye thinge els that is eyther
measured, or weighed. And vsury is not
onely in moneye, but also in wares and
merchandises, suche as maye be consu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med
or spent by vsinge of them.</p>
            <p>But some to auoid vsury wil say then, y<hi rend="sup">•</hi>
they wil not lend, but let to hyer, which
I woulde they dyd in deede, and not say
it onely, for then the perill shoulde bee
theirs, that doe lette it to hyer, and not
the hirers, or els it is nothynge to hier.
For if I doe hyer a horse to iourney for
a seuennight, and the horse without any
fault at all on my parte, doe dye before
I doe retourne: the losse shalbe his, that
did let the horse vnto me for hyer, and
not mine that did take the horse to hier,
excepte an expresse couenaunt bee made
to the contrarye: Whereas in lendinge
<pb n="87" facs="tcp:20795:104"/>
it is cleane contrarie. For I being lorde
of an other mans goods, by the vertue
of borowing, must aunswere the gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral
summe: which neuer dieth whatso<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>euer
become of mye perticuler receipt:
no, not althoughe theeues robbed mee
immediately, or that mye house weare
burned, and so I vtterlye vndoone. And
this muste I performe by order of all
lawes, although no couenant bee made
at all to saue the creditoure harmelesse,
for hee must haue hys owne principall,
without anie contradiction. And there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
let the vsurer saye what hee will, yf
he doe put forth hys money to be sure of
it agayne, he dothe not let it to hyer, nor
yet vseth anye other contract at all, sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uing
onely lendinge, let hym colour it
by neuer so manye deuises, as by bar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gaine
and sale, and vtteryng of wares,
or anye other shift whatsoeuer. And be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause
you shall fully and perfectly per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiue,
what lendinge is, and what let<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting
is, knowe you that when a deliue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry
is made of goods lent, (for withoute
deliuering there can be no lending) then
<pb facs="tcp:20795:105"/>
he that hath thus borowed the same, is y<hi rend="sup">•</hi>
proprietarie, the verie true owner, and
lorde of all, to dispose of them freelye as
hee liste, for his owne vse and benefite:
beynge bounde notwithstanding, to res<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tore
at a tyme appoynted, so muche and
no more in value, as he hathe receyued,
so that these goods seeme to bee lent for
hys benefyte and profite that borowed
them, not for hys gaine or aduauntage,
that did lend them. And hereby common
societie is the rather mainetayned be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>twixt
man and man, mutuall frendship
better encreased, and christian charitie
much exercysed, when the wealthy man
hathe thys care, to helpe his needye and
poore neighbour, and lendeth freely and
chieflye for his profit and auaile. Nowe
letting to hier, is for gaine, and especiall
profite, and the thinge put forth to hier,
ys styll his that did let it out, called in la<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>tine
<hi>Locatio,</hi> so that if by summe greate
myshap the same bee destroyed, loste, or
co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>sumed away through casualty, either
of fier or water: he y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> did let those goods
or chatels out to hyer, abideth al y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> peril,
not he that tooke them to hyer.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="88" facs="tcp:20795:105"/>
There is, also <hi>Commodatum,</hi> a lendinge
without alteracion of the propertie, the
owner remayning still lorde of that hee
did lend, &amp; this lending is free without
any gain at al. Thus you see by my sim<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple
learning &amp; vnderstanding, what let<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>tyng
is for hyer, what le<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ding is for vse,
to haue the verye selfe same againe, and
what free lending is for charity, to haue
the same kinde, &amp; how euery one of these
should be vsed, &amp; how a man maye dys<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerne
lendinge for vse, from lettinge to
hyer, &amp; lending to haue y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> same kynde a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gaine,
&amp; what difference ther is betwixt
<hi>Mutuum, Locatio,</hi> &amp; <hi>Commodatum.</hi> And be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sides,
what is the verye naturall and
proper definicio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> of vsury, by me set forth
before, according to y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> iudgement of ler<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned
men, in al ages. But now y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> I haue
shewed vnto you what vsury is, &amp; wher
in manifestly inough, as I trust, &amp; with
as great shortnes as I could: I will de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clare
vnto you, y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> the same is euil, vngod<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ly
&amp; wicked, &amp; so forbidden because it is
euil, &amp; not therfore euil, because it is for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bidden,
&amp; by what laws it is forbidde<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, &amp;
for what causes. Where no charitye is,
ther is no vertue.
<pb facs="tcp:20795:106"/>
but in the vsurers harte there is no cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritie:<note place="margin">Ioan. de lig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>na in C. na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uigati. Bald. in ius de v<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>suris, et in L. cunctos popu los vers. quae ro primo C. de suma Trini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tate.</note>
therefore the vsurer is voide of
vertue. Yf the vsurer had charytye hee
woulde haue compassion of his poore &amp;
needye neighbour and ayde his want to
his power, as by gods law he is bound.
But the remorse of conscience is not in
him, but onelye a desire to enriche hym
selfe, which is a wicked entent and mea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nyng,
and directly against god: for god
not only by his commaundements wil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leth
one to help an other, and to relieue
the poore, but also he sheweth his boun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tifulnes
vniuersally of his mere grace,
sufferynge the sunne to shine ouer all,
sending weather in due season, blessing
the grounde with all kinde of frute and
goodnes for mans behoofe, wherein is
shewed an example for vs to follow: that
as god of his free mercye, is good to all
beinge our creatour, so man shoulde be
charitable one to an other, in frank ay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinge
his fellowe creature. And as a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mongste
all vertues, there is none that
goethe so nyghe to the goodnes of god,
as liberalitie: so no vice is so farre from
<pb n="89" facs="tcp:20795:106"/>
god as is couetousnes, wherof spri<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>geth
vsurie, and all other myschiefes vpon
earthe. And as these that cannot geeue
with their ease, and yet doe lend freely,
are good members of god, so they, that
wil neyther geeue nor lende freely, are
the verye members of the deuill. Euill
therefore is vsurie, when it hyndreth
charitie, and hathe no sparke of goodes
grace in yt, but onely a desire to vndoe
all, and to diuise that the wealth of the
woorlde myght bee in fewe mens han<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>des:
as what other do thys caterpillers,
and enemyes to all contries, and kyng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>domes,
but heape welth to themselues,
from others, without charitye or respect
of man or god? yea both againste man
and god: in all that euer they may. And
therefore, who can saye otherwyse, but
that vsurie is euill, when it bringeth all
myschiefe with it, And therefore it hath
ben forbidden in all ages, and almoste
by all lawes vniuersally.</p>
            <p>First, the woorde of god is directlye
againste all vsurie and vsurers, and
doth not onely forbidde the same synne,
<pb facs="tcp:20795:107"/>
but threateneth deathe and dampnation
to them that vse it, as master Ockerfoe
hath very well declared, in hys godlye
oracion, and therefore I neede not to
make dubble inculcation.</p>
            <p>The canon lawe,<note place="margin">14. q. 3.</note> doth straitely and
playnely forbid vsurie, not onely in the
decrees, but also in the decretales in
Serto, and in the Clementynes, and
doth appointe very great punishments,
and dyuers, for them that are noto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rious
vsurers, as you shall heare more
at large hereafter, when I come to my
laste diuision. And touching the prohibi<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>tion
by the canon lawe, you shall here,
what the woordes are.</p>
            <p>No man shal enter in to holy orders,<note place="margin">33. D. maritu<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>.</note>
or bee of the ministerye, that by lawe is
conuicted and found to haue put his mo<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ney
to vsury. And in an other place: wee
do ordeyne, that no vsurer shalbee made
one of the cleargie.<note place="margin">D. 46. Sedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tionarios.</note> And the reason is in
the glose, that such me<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, because they are

is playne, with thys reason alled<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ged,
that no couetous man, or suche as
followeth hys owne greedy desire, for
worldlie goodes, should bee of the cler<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gie,
because they do easely fwarue from
Justice, and from all ryghte and well

in a decree,<note place="margin">Consiliu<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> Ni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cenum. 18.</note> of the Nicene cou<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>cell, which

degraded from all theire degrees of ec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clesiasticall

because they haue sought to lyue by fyl<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thye

is sayde, that suche as followe greedilye
worldly gayne, cannot serue god faith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fully.
And fo throughout, there are di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uers
distinctions, directly against vsury
and auarice.</p>
            <p>It followeth in the decrees, by the

            <p>Pope <hi>Leo</hi> dothe also forbid the same
offense in the laytie, beinge verye sorys
that any christian should bee an vsurer,
saiynge, that the clergy ought to bee the
more sharply punished for such offense,
because all others shoulde bee the more
afrayde to offend, whe<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> the clergy is not

            <p>Yea the Decrees do further saye,<note place="margin">14. q. 5.</note> that
no almes oughte to bee geeuen, of euill

gotten, than by vsury: but because you
master preacher haue sayd your minde
herein somewhat largely, I will not
<pb facs="tcp:20795:109"/>
saye anye more.</p>
            <p>And now, that I haue shortly vttered,
what is sayd in the decrees of the canon
lawe, you shall see, that the decretales
likewyse, and <hi>Clementynes,</hi> are directely
againste vsurie. And therfore, I would
not haue men altogether to be enemies
to the canon lawe, and to condempne
euery thinge there written, because the
popes were aucthours of the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, as though
no good lawe coulde bee made by them,
which god forbid, should eyther bee spo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken,

that there are some suche lawes,
made by the Popes, as be righte godly,
saye others what they list, whome fewe
things can please, although they bee ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uer
so well setteled and diuised, that are
not inuented and made first by themsel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ues.
But left them goe, and goe we to
the matter. In the decretales, in the cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>piter

of my diuision. And now last in the Cle<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>mentine

               <note place="margin">Clementine.</note> the fyfth, by

that hereafter will sett forthe, or bee ay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dors,

and wicked lawes, as you shall
heare more at large, when I come to
speake of punishme<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t appoynted against
vsurers. Neither shoulde wee so muche
hearken, what worldlie princes or magi<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>strates
haue donne for worldly pollicie,
as to looke, what god and Christe, the
hyghe magistrate of all hath done &amp; for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bidden,
and folowe that, as which wee
are bounde to followe, vppon payne of
dampnation. And according vnto that,
I doe reade of a Christian Emperour,
called <hi>Leo,</hi>
               <note place="margin">Hermenopo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lus, lib. 3. tit. 7.</note> who made a statute (as <hi>(Her<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>menopolus</hi>
declareth) agai<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>st vsury, which
for the woorthynes and godlynes ther<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in,
I thought good to Englishe woorde
<pb n="95" facs="tcp:20795:110"/>
for woorde as followeth.</p>
            <p>Although many of our auncestours ha<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ue
thought, y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> lending for vsury mighte
be admitted, and onely for that the cre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ditours
were so harde, and as men loth
els to lend: yet we haue thought it most
vnworthy amongst christians, &amp; to bee
vtterly abhorred &amp; eschewed, as a thyng
forbidden by the lawe of god. Therfore
our maiesty doth commaunde, that it be
not lawfull for anye man, to take vsury
for anye cause, leaste whyles wee goe a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout
to keepe the lawes and statutes of
men, wee doo transgresse therby y<hi rend="sup">•</hi> lawe
of god, but whatsoeuer anye man doth
take, the same shalbe reconed into the
principall.</p>
            <p>Thus you see thys christia<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> emperour,
after Justinia<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> and others, hauing more
respect to god, tha<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> to any polycie of ma<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>:
doth expresly forbidd vsury: &amp; fearing to
blaunche the wrytynge of god, and for
policye, to depraue a veritye, folowethe
the playne woordes of god, neither ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding
therto, nor diminyshing anye iot
thereof, as by the lawes hee was com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maunded.
<pb facs="tcp:20795:111"/>
Besides thys, the generall
cou<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>selles are directely against vsurers.
The causes that haue moued wyse and
godly men to deteste vsury, besides the
plaine prohibition, are diuers and sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stancial,
and therefore woorthy to bee
considered most diligently.</p>
            <p>The Jewe, that hath vsed thys horri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble
sinne most aboue all others, &amp; might
lawfullye vse the same, before Christs
comming, vpon any straunger, as ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pereth
plaine in Exodus, hath so robbed
the christians wheresoeuer hee came, y<hi rend="sup">•</hi>
his euill lyuinge seene, hee is banished
out of the most places in christendome,
and worthely: for surely that common
weale and country, cannot long stande
in prosperous estate and welfare, wher
mercha<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ts, &amp; all others, become vsurers,
And no better do I call the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> Jewes,
yea worse tha<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> any infidel, that witting<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
lyue by the onely gayne of their mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ney.
The causes that moue me, are these
Firste, the vsurer ys an idle man, hee
doth not trauayle, nor labour by sweate
of hys browes, to aduaunce hymselfe,
<pb n="94" facs="tcp:20795:111"/>
and hys countrey, but vseth the paynes
and troubles of others, to hys greate
gayne, without anye paynes takyng of
hys parte at all. And therfore, yf all
shoulde doe, as the vsurer doth, y<hi rend="sup">•</hi> grou<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>d
shoulde lye vntilled, no trade of mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chandize
shoulde bee vsed, nor yet occu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>piyng
maynteyned, for the vse of man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kynde.
For what follye weare it for a
man, eyther to delue, or digge, to passe
the seas with perill, to woorke in anye
mysterye or handie crafte: when hee
maye, with ease liyng on the one syde,
without labour, toyle or daunger, gete
more vnto hym, with ease and certain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie,
than the best labouring man, with
all his trauayle, or the greatest mercha<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t
liuynge with all hys paynes, throughe
vncertainty, hauing lyke wealth to be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gynne
as they haue, were euer hable to
geate. For what is hee liuyng that in a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny
trade, or trafique, can assure himselfe
yerelye, of euery hundreth poundes, to
gayne by his occupiynge twelue poun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>des,
without anye perill or daunger,
Whereas the vsurer, will be assured of
<pb facs="tcp:20795:112"/>
so much, and more a great deale euery
yere, let y<hi rend="sup">•</hi> world goe which way it wil,
to the great hurte and vndoyng, not o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nely
of those with whome hee dealeth,
but also, to the distruction of the whole
countrey where hee dwelleth. For besi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>des
that hee heapeth muche wealthe to
hymselfe, by such vnlawful meanes, he
bringeth a dearthe also of all thynges,
through hys excessiue dealing. For whe<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
hee taketh so deare for hys moneye, yt
must needes followe, that as others do
buy, so they muste sell. And therfore,
when one taketh a hundreth poundes,
to paye twentye poundes, ouer or
more than hee borowed, that same man
in vttering of hys wares, must so selle,
that hee must paye hys creditours, and
lyue also, whiche hee cannot doe, except
hee selle hys wares very deare, that hee
maye paye all that hee oweth, and gette
some what ouer, to mainteine him selfe
and hys familie. For yf hee doe not ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ke
of hys wares, the some of sixe score &amp;
tenne pounds at the yeares end, which
notwithstanding are no more woorth,
<pb n="95" facs="tcp:20795:112"/>
betwixt man and man, than one hu<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>dred
poundes at the first buiynge, hee is like
to leaue hys occupiynge shortly, and to
shutt vpp hys doores for euer. Therfore
you see, that the vsurer is the occasio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> of
all dearth and want, that happeneth to
a common weake. And thys is one of the
cheefest occasio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>s of all your bankruptes
nowe a dayes, and decayed gentlemen,
that haue borrowed mony, and taken
wares so deerely, that the very vsury in
time hath wholie eaten them vpp, &amp; vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>donne
them for euer. But woe worthe
that man, that hath so oppressed hys bro<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ther.
God is not mocked, and his woord
shalbee founde true, to theire dampna<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
for euer, except they doe amende in
tyme, and call to god for grace. God or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deyned
lending for maintenaunce of a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitye,
and declaration of loue, betwixt
man and man: wheras now lending is
vsed for pryuate benefit and oppression,
&amp; so no charitie is vsed at all, as thoughe
there were no god to iudge, nor lyfe to
come. I doe meruayle, to see so manye
theues hanged, &amp; so many vsurers liue:
<pb facs="tcp:20795:113"/>
For before god, the greatest theefe and
rauener, that can bee in a common
weale, ys the vsurer, and the woorste
man that liueth. And I am of master
Ockerfoes opinion, and thinke it were
better, that all Englande had one thou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sande
knowen theues, than one hun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dred
knowen vsurers. For the theefe,
may by diligence be eschued, and light<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
he harmeth but one man at once: but
the vsurer cannot bee auoyded: for the
vsurer bearethe the contenaunce of an
honest man, and is commonly taken, to
bee the best man in his paryshe. Yea hee
is often in aucthoritye, and dealeth as
though it were by lawe, being none o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
than a lawful theefe, creepinge in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to
credite wher<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap> gayne is to bee made, &amp;
vse the helpe of brokers, to serue hys
purpose. And thys ys very true, hee vn<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>doeth
as many as hee dealeth with all,
vnder the coloure of amitie &amp; lawe. And
surely, yf a man bee once in the vsurers
net, it is a great grace of god, if hee doe
euer escape hys handes, without vndo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>yng.
Therfore, vnhappy are they that
<pb n="96" facs="tcp:20795:113"/>
fall into the vsurers snares, or haue to
do with them, for as the caterpiller con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sumeth
the frute of the tree, so doth the
vsurer destroye the substance &amp; credit of
man. And the worst of all is this, that a
man is vndon, before he knoweth he is
euel dealt with all, beynge persuaded,
that all is to hys benefyte, till he be not
woorthe the ground hee treadeth vpon.
And therfore, the dealing of an vsurer,
is compared to the byting of the serpent
called <hi>Aspis.</hi> For as sainct Chrisostome
sayeth, vpo<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> the fyfty of sainct Matthew,
where mention is made of borrowing,
(as you master Ockerfoe haue partlye
touched): The money of the vsurer, is li<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ke
the bityng of the <hi>Aspis:</hi> for hee that
is stroken by that serpe<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t, feeleth therof a
certein pleasaunt ytche, wherby hee fal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leth
a sleepe, &amp; so through y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> plesauntnes
of his sleepe, he dieth in pleasure, for the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
the poyson goeth by a lyttle and a little
through all y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> partes of y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> body. So after
y<hi rend="sup">•</hi> a man hath take<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> mony vpo<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> vsury, &amp; ly<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ueth
plesauntly therwith for a tyme: at
le<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>gth, y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> vsury perceth so throughout all
<pb facs="tcp:20795:114"/>
his goodes moueable &amp; vnmouable, y<hi rend="sup">•</hi> al
his la<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ds, &amp; liuings, are not hable to paye
his debts. As I haue knowe<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> som, &amp; part<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lye
you, master Ockerfoe, spake of the
like, that hathe borrowed vppon 100. li.
lande, neuer improued onely 300. li. in
money, paiyng deepe vsurie, be you as<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sured,
and at length paide so longe (and
yet in no longe tyme neither) that hys
whole debte, through vsury, came to a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>boue
2000. markes: and so he lost (to saye
in effect) a hundred pound land, for 300.
li. in mony. A pityful case, and woorthy
to bee punished wyth horrible deathe.
Hereof commeth decay of good houses,
and wracking of the people, throughe
this deuouring caterpillers, which bei<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>g
not many, in respecte of all others: doe
gather the goodes of infinyte persones,
into theire owne handes. And so the co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
               <g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mo<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
weale is weakened, &amp; whole townes
destroyed, through the couetous vsurer.
For when they haue gotten whole ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nours
and townes into theire handes,
they are sorye, that anye shoulde dwell
there, but them selues. And so they
<pb n="97" facs="tcp:20795:114"/>
rid awaye in time the poore tenauntes
and suffer them to begge, and to dye for
hunger, and for tillage, vse shepegates,
wher no me<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> are mainteyned, nor house
holden, but all ouerthrowne: &amp; in steede
of houses, desert places to bee seene, and
wilde solytarines for beastes to raunge
in, and to feede vpon, cattaile and shepe
occupyinge the places of manye a good
honest meaninge man. So that by these
twoe idle occupacions, great vsurye and
manye flockes of sheepe and heardes of
beastes, this noble Countrey is made in
a maner a forest, and brought to greate
ruyn and decay, thorough dyspeoplyng
of men, ouerthrowing of townes, and
oppressyng of the poore, w<hi rend="sup">t</hi> intollerable
vsury. And I pray you, what is more a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gai<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>st
nature, the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> money should beget
or bri<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>g forth money? which was ordei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned
to be a pledge or right betwixt man
&amp; man, in contracts and bargayning as
a iuste measure and proporcion in bar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gayning,
and not to encrease it selfe, as
a woman dothe, that bringethe foorthe a

<hi>nubibus</hi> sayeth, that such money which
bringeth forth money is a swelling mo<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
               <g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ster,
waxing euerye moneth bigger one
then an other, and so horrible swelleth
from time to time, as no man by wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>des
is able to vtter, contrary to nature,
order, &amp; al good reason. And what equa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lytye
is in bargaynynge I praye you,
when the one partie is famished, and y<hi rend="sup">e</hi>
other is hoggesty fed? Justice is none o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
thinge then a certeine euenhode or
equalitie, and therefore they that do not
in their dealings, vse an equal property,
do not vse Justice. Now in vsurye, you
may well saye, there is noe euenhode at
all, for the lender receiuethe more then
he lent. As after he hath le<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t, he receiueth
his principal againe, which is the equa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>litie
in law, then he taketh an ouerplus
for nothing, that is to say, gayne aboue
<pb n="98" facs="tcp:20795:115"/>
hys pryncipall, yea, and excessyue also,
whiche is a great disproporcion &amp; plaine
inequalitie, for why shoulde anye man
gayne, for the onely lendinge? He hath
hys owne agayne, without any losse, or
hinderaunce at all. And what will hee
haue more? his owne he hath with tha<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
               <g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kes,
and more then his owne he should
not aske. If hee receiue not as good mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ney
as he lent, and of the same value, he
may wel complaine, but when he hathe
his owne againe, wythoute losse, and
 w<hi rend="sup">t</hi> thankes toe, what can he haue more?
In lending he looseth the property, and
vse for the time, and is noe lorde of hys
owne for the season, and what will hee
haue when hee hathe departed with his
owne for tyme? for nothynge, some<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thinge?
for a shadowe a perfite bodye?
for moone shyne in the water, a mans
whole treasure? I speake of those nowe
that for lendynge of money onelye (all
other respectes and considerations set
asyde) wyll haue moneye for their mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ney,
yea, &amp; a great deale for a litle respi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting
of time, in forbeari<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>g their moneye,
<pb facs="tcp:20795:116"/>
a wicked kinde of men, and the vnpro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fitablest
wretches that liue. Doe not
these worldlinges see, that god of hys
goodnes, hathe freely geuen this world
for man to vse and occupye onelye, to
acknowledge theire creatour, &amp; to loue
their brethren. Doth not y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> sunne shyne
vpon vs freelye? the ayre is open to vs
all, and wee breathe, thoroughe goddes
great mercy, the tyme endureth for our
benefite? And wil these idle men sell the
sunne, the ayer, and the tyme for theire
proper gayne? howe can hee bee of god
that so dothe. God geeueth, and the vsu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rer
withholdeth, god openeth his ha<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ds,
and the vsurer is straite handed, god is
free, the vsurer is harde. God lendethe
life and liuing for loue, the vsurer gai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neth
al that he maye for lone, yea hee ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>keth
mens hartes (as I might saye) out
of theire bodies. So that I maye well a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uowe,
that lyght and darkenes, whyte
and blacke, trueth and falshood, heauen
and hell: are not so contrarye and so dis<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>tant,
as god and the vsurer, yea so farre
of is it, that anye man shall take gayne
<pb n="99" facs="tcp:20795:116"/>
for money,<note place="margin">Cap. sup. ext. de vsuris. 13. q. 1. 2. &amp; i<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bi Augusti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nus.</note> as it is forbidden to do anye
good work, for vsurie. As that a stock of
money should run for y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> helping of yong
occupiers, to marry poore maydens, to
relieue the poore and afflicted in euerye
towne &amp; parishe that be not able to helpe
the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> selues, or to redeeme captiues from
the Infidels: al these good deedes I say,
are forbidden to bee done by the waye of
vsurie. And therfore, whereas there are
in Italy, <hi>Montes pietatis,</hi> that is to say,
mountes or bankes of charitye, places
where great summes of moneye are by
legacies geuen, for reliefe of the poore,
to borowe vpon gages, and to paye one<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lye
after three or fower in the hundred
at the most, to mayntayne the officers,
and to beare the charges of such an erec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted
mount for euer: the law doth plain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lye
condempne all suche doynges to bee
vsurye, and therfore much more should
vsurye be abhored, that is excessyue and
lent onely for greedye lucre and priuate
gayne. Then if we loue to liue together
in a common societie, as brethren ought
one with an other, and wyll that coue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tousnes
<pb facs="tcp:20795:117"/>
the roote of all euil, as you haue
well said master Ockerfoe, bee banished
out of England. Let vs agree, that noe
vsurer maye cary estimacion (as by law
and right they ought not to haue anye)
but he with hart abhorred, and by order
punished as he ought to be, and to pray
that god maye inspyre the magystrates
hartes, to prouide good and holsome re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>medye
against suche wicked and vngod<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ly
doinges. Thus muche touchinge the
second parte of my diuision: in al which
talke, I haue folowed the course of my
profession, and vsed such speache, as the
authors and writers thereof, haue geue
occasion of such like matter.</p>
            <p>3 In the thirde part I will open diuers
contractes and bargaynes that are vsed
to auoide vsurye.</p>
            <p>I haue neede of money, and deale wyth
a broaker, hee aunswereth me, that hee
cannot helpe me with moneye, but yf I
list to haue wares, I shall speede. Well
my necessitie is great, he bryngeth mee
blotting paper, pakthreede, fustia<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>s, cha<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
               <g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lets,
haukes bels, &amp; hoodes, or I wote
<pb n="100" facs="tcp:20795:117"/>
not what: I desire hym to make sale for
mine aduantage, askyng what he thin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>keth
willbe my losse, he aunswereth, not
paste twelue pounde in the hundred.
When I come to receiue, I do finde y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> I
lose more then twentye in the hundred
(yea, woulde god that none had loste
more) I beinge greeued w<hi rend="sup">t</hi> my losse, doe
charge the broaker, and saye, that I wil
not receiue the money wyth suche losse,
the merchaunt aunswereth, that he wyl
not take his wares againe, and hauing
my bille, careth not what become of me
that haue borowed: this is called a dou<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ble
stoccado, that is to saye, the stycking
blowe, or the double stabbe. For at the
firste, the poore gentleman is borne in
hande, there is no money to be had, but
is promised wares, to auoyde, or rather
to mocke the daunger of the statute (but
god is not mocked) and so wyth thys
cruell blowe of wares, hee is made be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leeue
that they will falle out not aboue
twelue pound, or 20. marks at the most,
but when hee commethe to receiue the
nete money, y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> merchant &amp; broker being
<pb facs="tcp:20795:118"/>
agreed togeather, he is stabbed at the ve<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ry
hart, paying somtimes twenty pou<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>d,
nay shal I say thirty pound, I would it
had been noe more with some, a wicked
and a most horrible cruel dealinge: and
once in for a hundred pound, he can ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uer
come out cleare againe, til hauynge
mortgaged his landes, (whiche is y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> next
parte to be played and practised) hee bee
forced in the ende, to sell the same oute
right. And so betwene the merchaunt &amp;
the broaker, the poore gentleman is
caught in the Cony clapper, to liue with
the losse of thirty pound in the hundred
at the least. And yet if there were plaine
dealyng, in the matter, it were the more
sauourye: but the merchaunt is agreed
with the broaker, to buy his own wares
agayne, and to paye 70.<abbr>l.</abbr> for that which
the gentleman must paye him a hu<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>dred
pound for, at the yeres ende. Is not this
vsury? is it not vsurye thynke you, in y<hi rend="sup">e</hi>
deuils name? Now surely vnhappye is
hee that dealeth with such diuelish mer<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>chaunts
or others whatsoeuer, for of all
cutthrotes in the world, these are the ab<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>solute
<pb n="101" facs="tcp:20795:118"/>
horrible, and most detestable mo<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
               <g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sters
that liue. And god kepe all playne
and true dealing men from the dangers
of all suche false and craftie hipocriticall
harlottes, and greedye cormorantes in
a common weale. And yet these fellows
that thus doe, carie the countenance, as
though they were as honest men as the
honestist, and are not ashamed to looke
an honest man in the face, neyther yet
to take office vpon them, because theye
florishe with the goods of thys worlde,
and are wealthye: whereas if theye had
their due merite, they should bee exalted
for their worthines, to hang on the gal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowes,
rather then to bee thought meete
of estimation, or to beare office as some
of them doe, in anye good gouerned co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
               <g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon
weal. Thus master mercha<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t when
he hathe robbed the poore gentleman, &amp;
furnisht him in this maner to get a litle
apparel vpo<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> his back, girdeth hym with
this frompe in the taile. Lo sayethe hee,
yonder goeth a very strong stowt gen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tleman,
for he cariethe vpon his backe,
a faire manour, land and all, and maye
<pb facs="tcp:20795:119"/>
therefore wel be standerd bearer to any
prince christian or heathen. Alack what
handling is this? Is here mercye, chari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie,
or loue, is this merchantly dealing?
would these merchaunts bee so vsed, as
they vse others? doe they as they would,
be done vnto? These be marmaides, not
merchants, singing sweetely to confusi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on.
Merchants I saye, that make armo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny
for the deuill, no better, nor more to
bee esteemed, then ribaldes &amp; common
bawdes, that put forthe yong gyrles to
sale, and make merchaundises of them,
to wynne treasure to theire purses. As
<hi>Archidiaconus</hi> saieth. An other hath a pa<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>tente
of fortye pounde by the yeare, and
commeth in time of hys great neede, to
borowe a hundred pounde for the yere,
making a bargaine and sale wyth thys
condicion, if he doe not repaye the same
100.<abbr>l.</abbr> within the yere, that then the said
patente shalbe forfeyted for euer: and if
the patentee doe dye within the yere, the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
the merchant to haue his owne moneye
agayne, and so muche of the patent as
was in time runne out, and very strong
<pb n="102" facs="tcp:20795:119"/>
bondes and suerties offered therefore.</p>
            <p>The merchaunt seeing the necessitye of
the poore gentleman, will not deale ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cepte
he may haue the whole yeres pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fit
of the patente assured vnto him, whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
the patentee die or liue: and farther
couenaunteth that the patentee shal not
within the yeare offer to paye the pryn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cipall,
to saue anye parte of the annuitie
for that yeare, and to haue it fiue yeres
together, for none payment of the prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cypall,
and so hee is content, otherwise
hee will not deale. The poore compel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led
gentleman beeinge dryuen to thys
necessitie, either for the better aduaun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cing
him self to serue his prince &amp; coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trey,
aswel abroade as at home, &amp; called
perhaps thereunto, or otherwise, for his
necessary affairs at home, to saue hi<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> self
fro<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> prese<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t misery, yeldeth wholy to thys
cruel contract, &amp; vnmerciful bargayne:
And so hauing done in deede his seruice
abrode, for benefit of y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> realm, &amp; welfare
of y<hi rend="sup">•</hi> mercha<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ts chiefly, returneth after y<hi rend="sup">e</hi>
yeare paste, about one moneth or some<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>what
more, at what time offeringe to
<pb facs="tcp:20795:120"/>
paye the principall, and so to be ridde of
thys bytinge vsurie, had muche a doe to
haue that moneth forgeuen vnto hym,
notwithstanding his absence oute of the
land, in the necessarie affaires of y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chants
them selues, as wel for the safety
of their liues and liberties, as for theire
proper goods and merchandises. A man
woulde haue thought that forty pounde
gayne, had been sufficient for one yeare
and a moneth, for the lone of a hundred
pound. These dealings I do assure you,
are not to be liked, tendyng to the vtter
discreditinge of merchants wholye: for
besides that they are bytynge, they are
vncharitable, vnmercifull, and altoge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
wicked, stretching to the vtter des<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>truction
not onelye of whole families,
but also of good common weales.</p>
            <p>I come to an other man, and borrowe
forty pound of him for three monethes,
and do promise to geue his wife a gown
of satine, or an amblyng gelding for his
or her ridinge, without any expresse co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uenaunt
in writing, this is playne vsu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry,
although for his lendyng, hee dothe
<pb n="103" facs="tcp:20795:120"/>
not receiue anye thinge that is paide by
number, weight or measure. Yet foras<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>muche
as he receiueth a value aboue the
principall, he is an vsurer.</p>
            <p>I bynde my land woorth twenty pound
by yere to a man for a hundred pounde
in money for a yeare, and doe not passe
it by bargayne and sale: If the creditour
doe take the reuenues of the land at the
yeares ende and his pryncipal, he is an
vsurer.</p>
            <p>Bee it that a man lendethe an hundred
pound freelye, and hopeth assuredlye to
haue some thankfull recompence at the
yeres ende, because he is a man able to
doe him good dyuers wayes, wythoute
which hope he would not haue lent his
money: vndoubtedlye y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> same man is an
vsurer before god, and thys is called
<hi>Mentalis vsura,</hi> an vsurie of the mynde,
when one hopeth for gayne although no
contracte be made.</p>
            <p>What if one lend money in hope to get
an office, assuredlye the same man is an
vsurer?</p>
            <p>What if one lende a man moneye for a
<pb facs="tcp:20795:121"/>
certaine time, because the same manne
should speke a good word for him, or do
hym a certayne pleasure, it is a ruled
case, that for asmuche as a couenaunt is
past, it is vsurie.</p>
            <p>I do lend you 100.<abbr>l.</abbr> that you shal doe as<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>much
for me, when I shal demaund it of
you: this is vsurye, because a contract is
simply made, without anye addicion of
time appoynted, whereas if I had asked
so much at the yeres end, then it had ben
no vsurye, but permutacion, when one
good turne of lyke value is done for an
other, and the time knowen certeinly.</p>
            <p>A lorde dothe lende hys tenauntes mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ney,
wyth thys condicion, that they shal
ploughe hys lande, whether dothe hee
commyt vsurye or noe? I doe aunswer,
that yf hee doe not paye them for theire
labour, but wil take the benefit of their
labour, for the vse of his money, hee is
an vsurer.</p>
            <p>I woulde borowe, and one sellethe vnto
me wares, for more then they be worth,
(by the halfe) hee is an vsurer that so
selleth.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="104" facs="tcp:20795:121"/>
I doe bargayne with a man for sixe mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nethes,
and deale as straitlye with hym
as I can for hys wares: when the bar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gayne
is done, I doe offer hym his mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ney
presently, so that he will deducte af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
ten pound in the hundred pound for
sixe monethes. I am an vsurer in so do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ynge.</p>
            <p>I do buy tymber, bricke, or stone, of a
man to delyuer the same at suche a time
and place, and to pay hym for the same,
I doe borrowe so muche vppon vsury.
Whether shal the saide man not deliue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rynge
my stuffe at my tyme and place

therfore no lending can be presupposed.</p>
            <p>In Uenyce, Flore<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ce, &amp; Genua, diuers
heretofore haue had pe<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>sions, some for e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uer,
some for lyues, for somes of mony
disbursed to the benefite of theire Citie:
In all whiche cases, there is no vsurye,
<pb facs="tcp:20795:124"/>
&amp; yf any one buy their rightes or titles,
hee is no vsurer neyther.</p>
            <p>I seeke an office, whiche I cannot ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ue,
excepte I doe paye a certeyne some
of money: to auoyde thys paymente, I
doe lend, for two three or fower yeres a
grosse some, because I will not pay the
sayde moneye: In thys doynge is v<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sury.</p>
            <p>I do pawne an howse, with an orchard
for certayne mony, the creditour hath y<hi rend="sup">e</hi>

an vsurer, except hee wil restore the pro<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>fites,

            <p>A gentleman, or lorde hath a manor
stocked, with thyrty mylche kyne, and
700. sheepe, valued at 300. markes, or
there about, as they are the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> to be bought
and solde: Thys manour hee would let
out, with the stocke, for ten yeares, to re<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ceyue
the olde rent of hys manour, &amp; 30.
poundes yerely beside, for his stocke, &amp;
at the tenne yeres ende, eyther to haue
at hys owne choyce hys cattell, of like
goodnes and value, as hee did lett them
<pb n="107" facs="tcp:20795:124"/>
out, or els 200. pounds in money for the
cattell: the question is, whether there is
any vsury, in thys kynde of dealinge or
no? First, ther is a lending, because the
farmour hath propertie in the cattell,
and maye alter them, as hee list, for his
best auayle, paiyng hys yearely rente
for them, and restoring so good cattell,
at the tenne yeares ende, as hee before
receyued. Agayne, hee must aunswere
the cattell at the tenne yeares ende, and
paye rente yearelye for tenne yeares,
although the cattell dye all, the very
firste yeare: so that I thinke, thys lorde
or gentleman, that thus seketh hys cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tayne
gayne, and principall, to bee sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>felye
retourned vnto hym, is an vsurer
colorably, to the hurte and vndoynge
many tymes of poore farmours. Yet
some saye, that here is <hi>locatio,</hi> whiche ys
a letting to hyre, and therefore no vsu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry.
As yf a man should let out his how<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>se
for tenne yeres to haue hys howse a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gayne,
or hys horse for a seuen nyghte,
to haue hys sayde horse agayne, with
profite, but I am not of that mynde, for
<pb facs="tcp:20795:125"/>
when a thing is lett out, the tenaunt for
the tyme can not alter the property, and
geue an other thing of like value, but he
must returne the same agayne, in the
same goodnes, as hee did receiue it, bee
it eyther house, horse, or any other thing
else. And therefore I saye, thys is vsu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rie,
because the principal (the losse wher<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of,
was at the bourowers perill) muste
alwayes bee restored wholly, with a cer<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ten
ouerplus and gayne, for the tyme
that it is forborne. And then, if thys bee
true, what saye these gyld halles, these
colleges, these abbotes in tymes paste,
and these bishoppes also, that haue lett
out Lordshippes, with the stocke, for a
yerelye gayne, in suche sorte as I haue
before declared? God bee mercifull vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to
vs: the deuill teacheth the woorld ma<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ny
wayes, for men to come the sooner
to hym.</p>
            <p>And other tricke I haue to shewe,
whyche is verye straunge: for by thys
newe deuised practise, men will not,
for any thinge seme to be euill, and yet
they wilbee euill in deede, and lyue as
<pb n="108" facs="tcp:20795:125"/>
wickedlye as any other, and thus it is.
A Northren gentleman of good welth,
cometh to London, with 1000. li. in hys
purse, &amp; would fayne encrease hys mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ney,
but hee woulde not be knowne for
any thing, to be an vsurer, because he is
a gospeller in shewe, and would not for
hys good wil be take<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> otherwise, during
thys good tyme. And what doth thys
man? He commeth to a broker, &amp; sayeth,
that one John Clarke hath ready mony
in good store, and woulde put it out for
gayne, yf hee coulde fynde a good man:
Mary sayeth the gentleman, the partye
will not lend to anye bodye, except I be
bound my selfe for his safe receiuing a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gayne
of hys mony. And thus y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> gentle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man
is bou<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>d, to hys nyckenamed man,
for hys own mony, who hereupo<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> requi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reth
(for the more coloring of the mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter)
bondes of the borower, to saue hym
selfe harmeles, against thys counterfet
John Clarke. The Broaker bringeth
good men, &amp; good assurance, to saue the
gentlema<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> harmeles, and the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> ge<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>tlema<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>

<pb facs="tcp:20795:126"/>
hys men, to take y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> name of John Clark
vpon hym, and causeth the wrytynges
to be made in John Clarkes name, and
the money to be repaide, at the sayd scri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ueners
house, at sixe moneths, or twelue
moneths, as they can agree, after twen<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ty
poundes in the hundreth, and that in
the presence of the sayde gentleman, or
hys attorney in that behalfe appointed.
Here is a tryme fetche, to mocke god, &amp;
the Exchecker with all, if it were possi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble:
but god is not mocked, howsoeuer
thexchequer is abused: but such cunning
dealinges, in the ende will haue shame
ynough, of suche theire counterfeyt do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ynges,
and dye in hell fyer at the laste.</p>
            <p>But will you see an other fetche, and
not by the name of John Clarke, but by
one y<hi rend="sup">•</hi> in lawe can do nothing? A ge<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>tel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man,
a lawier, a merchaunt, a yeoman,
or what shoulde I call hym, holdethe of
my ladie, and therefore will not bee
one of these wyse worldly men himself,
but is contented, that my mystres hys
wyfe, shall go to the deuyll, if shee lyste.
And therfore geeueth her leaue, to put
<pb n="109" facs="tcp:20795:126"/>
out hys money, in a straungers name,
sometymes more, and sometymes lesse.
And be it neuer so lyttle that is le<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t, and
y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> partie neuer so poore that boroweth,
yet shall it not go foorth, with her good
will, but with the retorne, many tymes
of y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> shillinge peny for a moneth, which
is one hundred for an other by the yere.
Merciful god, who would haue thought
that y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> deuill could haue had such power
in a woman: nay, who would not haue
thought it, considering their myserable

and forgeeue all men, and graunt
that both man and woman, maye agree
alwayes in one harte and mynde, to

they all, are very fewe in deede, &amp; maye
bee easely packed vp, al the whole packe
of them, in a very small rowme. What
shyftes are not vsed, for men to goe
streight to the deuill? Thys one I will
tell you, and no more, and yet I feare
me, I haue tolde ouer manye, for some
will learne to bee naught, by the onely
hearing of these sleightes, and therfore
ignorance in euill thynges, is alwayes
good, but the deuill will teache them
euery hower, although I sayde neuer a

            <p>A merchant, or an other man, woulde
fayne goe for an honeste man, and yet
woulde needes bee nought in deede, &amp;
therfore, when one commeth, to borow
mony of him, and offreth to paye for it:
mary fye vppon vsury, sayeth hee, but
thys will I saye to you, sayeth the mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chaunte:

&amp; I promyse you, I will speake to him,
<pb n="110" facs="tcp:20795:127"/>
but I will not take a peny of you. The
party, who is sayde to haue borowed
thys money, hath not borowed one pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nye,

one stuffe or chaffer for an o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther.
As if one had clothes, &amp; wanted le<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther,

haue linnen, or hauing flesh, would ask
bread for it in exchaunge. These things
were straunge, and I saye vnpossible to

woulde sende for the exchaunge of my
want, an other maye haue the same as<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>well
as I, and hee want that whiche I
woulde haue. And therfore money was
first deuised to be coyned, of the fynest &amp;
purest mettals, to be the measure wher<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by
the price of all thinges might bee set,
and to mayntayne a certayne euenhode

same to haue his standinge valuation,
only by publique aucthoritie: to the end,
that all things mighte equallye passe by

money is vsed for y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> passing of exchange
betwene partie and party, countreye &amp;
countrey, as I haue said before, and wil
say more hereafter.</p>
            <p>Thirdlye, money is vsed as a chatell, or
a moueable possession, and to be solde by
the wayght, after so much the ounce, as
commonly all kinde of coyne is solde at
<pb facs="tcp:20795:131"/>
smythes stalles, whiche seemethe to bee
contrary to the natural institucion, and
first inuencion thereof: because it is no
ware or merchandise, and therfore not
to bee prysed aboue hys publique estima<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>cion,
excepte it bee solde as bullion, and
not as currant money or coyne.</p>
            <p>And nowe, woulde god our merchants
that professe trade and exchaunge, were
so skilfull in their calling as they ought
in al good right to be. For surely the ig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>norance
of them, bringethe kingdomes
and states manye times to great ruyne.
For if they wil be exchangers in deede,
they muste knowe perfitely the value of
our coyne, and compare the same wyth
other foreine moneye. And as they bar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gayne
with others abrode, so they must
be assured to haue somewhat more then
the value of our curraunt moneye, for
thinges whiche they sell vpon a price, or
els the realme and they bothe shall lose
in the ende. As for example. One buyeth
clothe in Blacwel hall, for. iiij. <abbr>l.</abbr> x.s. in
Angels, which holde .xxxvi. carrets fine,
saue three graines of alley, or eighteene
ounces fine siluer. The same cloth to be
<pb n="114" facs="tcp:20795:131"/>
solde in Spayne, is to be rated at so ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny
duckets as hold .xxxvi. carets of fine
golde, saue three graynes of alley, or at
so manye royals of plate, as holde .xviij.
ounces of fine siluer, after twoe carrets
of fine golde to euery ounce of fyne sil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uer.
And in making sale of thys cloth, it
is wisedome to take so muche ouer &amp; a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>boue
these carrettes or ounces, as bothe
may beare a mans charges, and bring a
reasonable gayn. And so in al other cou<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
               <g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tries,
and for euerye prynces coine, the
valuacion of oure commodities shoulde
be made after the like rate, with a reaso<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nable
ouerplus to lyue and gayne by.
And in thexchaunge of coynes, yf oure
men woulde obserue and compare eight
carrettes of fine golde, or fower ounces
of fine siluer for y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> pound starlyng here,
with the forein coin beyond seas, eyther
duckets or Philips Caisars, or ani other
straunge coyne, and euer bee well assu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red
to take sowhat ouer. After this pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>porcion
and balance once made, Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lishmen
no doubt would be Lords of y<hi rend="sup">t</hi>
coin in al places, wher they had to deale.
<pb facs="tcp:20795:132"/>
This is by the waye of a glaunce to my
masters the merchants. But now to my
purposed diuision of y<hi rend="sup">•</hi> ba<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>kers art &amp; their
profession. Thexchaunge is saide to bee
deuided into two kyndes.</p>
            <p>1 The firste wherof is called exchange
real, or thexcha<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ge made to y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> last minut.</p>
            <p>2 The second is thexchange by billes,
whiche is after twoe sortes. But first for
thexchaunge reall, you shal vnderstand
y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> then it is vsed, when the banker or ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chaunger
receiueth money of any perso<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
in one coyn, to delyuer vnto hi<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> straight
wayes money of an other coyne. As for
siluer, golde: for shillinges, groates: for
groates, pence: for pence, halfe pence:
whiche is called exchaunge to the laste
minut. Or els when bullion is deliuered
for currant money, or when one taketh
vpon him to deliuer coyne, in one coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>try,
to receiue coin of an other straunge
countrie, accordinge to iuste &amp; publique
valuacion equallie of such bullion coin,
or money whatsoeuer, which maner of
exchaunge is nowe quite out of vse.</p>
            <p>Exchange by billes after the first sort, is
<pb n="115" facs="tcp:20795:132"/>
when money is deliuered in one coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trey
plainly and simply, without colour
or fraud, and billes deliuered and recei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ued
for the payment againe of the same,
in an other countrey, accordinge as mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ney
is currant, by merchants valuation
betweene those countreis. And this kind
of exchaunge maye properlye bee called
merchandizing exchange, because mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chantes
doe onely themselues, sette and
appoint the prices and values of money
to exchaunged. And therfore, when any
man will deliuer in London to any mer<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>chant
a summe of lawful money of Eng<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>land,
to receiue in an other forein coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trey,
somuch in value as the said sume of
English money shallbe esteemed to bee
worth, by merchauntes valuation after
theire exchaunge from London, in the
money of that countrey, where the par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie
which deliuered the money wil haue
it payde againe: there must be first a co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
               <g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>posicion
and compacte made, for the va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lue
of the money, and a certain distance
of time agreed vppon, and limitted for
the payment agayn of the saide money,
<pb facs="tcp:20795:133"/>
in a foreine countrey where y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> deliuerer
or the borower of the money, wyll haue
it restored and payde agayne. For the
better vnderstandynge and meanynge
hereof<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> thus I saye. A certain man doth
borow here in London of a merchaunt,
a hundred pounde Englishe, to paye the
value thereof againe at Antwarpe, ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording
as thengshe moneye is currant
and valued by merchaunts in theire ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chaunge,
from London to Antwarpe.
Here it is requisite, that the borower do
resorte, and haue accesse to suche as bee
brokers and solicitours betweene party
and partie, for makynge of thexchange,
of whom hee shal learne what thenglish
pound is worth and esteemed from Lo<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
               <g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>don
to Antwarpe in Flemyshe currant
moneye, for what soeuer dystaunce of
tyme, he wil take it vppe. Now graunt
that the Englishe pounde, thus exchan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ged
from London to bee payde in Ant<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>warpe

               <g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pacte

money is paide at London, and billes of

and this is their kinde of exchange. And
now let vs examine whether this bee v<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>surie
or not. All learned men doe deter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mine
and consent, that vsurie is co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>mit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted
onely, where lending and borowing
is, and that when anye ouerplus or ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cesse

                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>ase is vsury.
First it appeareth in this first sort of ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>change
by billes, that there was payd at
London, one hundred pound onely, and
no more of good and lawfull money of
England to receiue by excha<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ge at sight
in Antwarpe, fower and xx. s. Flemishe
for thenglishe pounde, whyche was so
perfourmed and payde by the taking vp
againe of the same money, to be rechan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ged
back againe at sight, to London. So
that there was payde to the partye that
first l<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>
               <g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t the moneye, about the summe of
a hundred pound sixtene shillings eight
pence or a 101.<abbr>l.</abbr> fiue shillinges lawefull
moneye of Englande. Whiche is an en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crease
or gayne growynge to the lender
of his money, to y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> value of sixteene shil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lings
and odde moneye, or of twentye
shillings and odde money, onely for the
tarying and forbearinge of his moneye
twelue or foreteene daies. Whiche ouer
gayning, and excessiue takynge in thys
sort, is in my opinion, most biting vsu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rie.
And yet is thys kynde of exchange,
moste commonlye vsed at this daye a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mongst
<pb facs="tcp:20795:135"/>
all the merchants of Europe, &amp;
had in great estimacion, and commen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded,
as a thinge moste necessarie and a
very ready mean to serue mens turnes
with all, at all times, when theye neede.
And yet in deede it is an extreme vsury,
yea, and suche a Moth, as he that vseth
it, will sooner bee consumed that waye,
then by anye meanes els in the worlde,
especially by the rechaunge backwarde,
whiche is euer hurtful, costly, and very
chargeable.</p>
            <p>The seconde kynde of billes or mercha<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
               <g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dising
exchaunge, maye bee called se<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>ke
and drye exchange, and is practised whe<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
one doth borrowe money by exchaunge
for a strange Region, at longer or shor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
distaunce of time, to serue his turne
the rather thereby, not myndynge to
make anye reall payment abroade, but
compoundeth with thexchanger to haue
it returned backe agayne, accordyng as
thexchaunge shall passe from thence to
London, for suche distaunce of time as
they were agreed vpo<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>. And yet to colour
this matter, there shall billes of excha<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ge
<pb n="118" facs="tcp:20795:135"/>
be deuised, &amp; sent to some of his frendes
that lent the money by exchaunge, with
letters of aduise, to return the byls back
againe, and a testimoniall howe the ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chaunge
commeth from thence, at suche
dystaunce of time, as he aduertised him
of, by his letters. Which retourninge of
billes by testimoniall, doth euer cost the
partye that dealeth with this sorte of ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chaunge,
after the rate of sixteene and
twenty in the hundred for the yere. And
oftentimes, such alteracion of exchange
may chance by scarcitie, or aboundance
of money (whereof the banker will take
aduauntage) that it standeth y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> borower
sometime aboue fiue and twenty or thir<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ty
in the hundred pound for y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> yere. And
bylles by this kynde of exchaunge are
made on gods name, for a colour onelie
to get the parties hand to them, to shew
(if neede be) that suche moneye so lente,
was taken vp for him by exchaunge, the
said billes being neuer sent out of Lon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>don:
to thende that the party who vseth
his money in this sort, may haue his re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>coning
geeuen him to paye as the rate &amp;
<pb facs="tcp:20795:136"/>
course of thexchaunge: hathe paste al the
while hee hathe the vse of that moneye,
which shall falle out noe lesse then after
the losse of twenty in the hundred pou<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>d
for the yere: or perhaps (as the drye fros<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie
charitie of the lender, shalbe moued)
after xxv. or .xxx. in the hundred pound,
because the tasking, and limitting ther<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of
resteth altogether in the bankers ha<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>d.
Thys drye kynde of exchange is vtter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lye
to bee abhorred, for that it is none o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
then a manifest cankered vsurye,
and therefore hath been heretofore for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bidden
by actes of parlyament: as may
appeare in the reigne of two noble prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces
kyng Henry the seuenth, and kynge
Henry the eight, of most famous memo<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ry.
And yet al this notwithstanding, the
merchants wil say, that they commit no
vsurie, by suche kinde of dealinge, al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>though
the lender by exchaunge bee al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wayes
for the moste parte a verye great
gayner. And the reason is, the vncer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainty
of gaine, and doubtfulnes of pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fite,
for that thorowe the alteracion of
thexchange, y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> deliuerer or lender of mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ney,
<pb n="119" facs="tcp:20795:136"/>
maye chaunce to susteyn losse som<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times:
and therfore this aduenture and
hazarde considered in the exchange they
say, there is no vsurie at all. But this is
no sownde reason of theires, but rather
a meere cloake, to colour theire conyng
deuises with al: because that in this se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>conde
kinde of exchaunge, thexchanger
or lender of moneye, is commonlye hys
owne bayly, and taxethe the borowers
losse, accordinge to his priuate commo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ditie
and gayne, who wylbe well assu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red
to be no loser, no more then hee that
putteth forthe his money vppon playne
vsurie, and bargayneth alwayes for pre<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>sent
gaine before hande. And althoughe
the banker perhappes bee not so fullye
assured of his gayne, as the vsurer com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monlye
is: yet it is a hundreth to one, y<hi rend="sup">t</hi>
by the course and order of thexchaunge
the deliuerer of money, shalbee no loser
in the end, but rather a gayner, because
the price of moneye by exchaunge from
London to Antwarpe, is euer dearer &amp;
higher by three pence or fower pence in
the pound, then it is from thence to Lo<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
               <g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>don,
<pb facs="tcp:20795:137"/>
at whatsoeuer descrepance of time,
the exchaunge be made. And therefore y<hi rend="sup">e</hi>
gayne thereby is in deede very certaine
to them, let them saye what theye list. I
graunt stil, that real exchange is honest
and lawfull, where money is deliuered
to be payde againe at sight, or at twoe
or three monethes, accordinge to y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> iust
and publyque valuation of moneye, to
what Countreye soeuer thexchaunge ys
made. But this kynd of exchange plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>seth
not merchants, the same hauing no
such sauor of lucre and gayne, as the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chaunge,
and the drye exchaunge haue:
whiche twoe kindes of dealyng, are ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rye
hurtfull to al occupiers, and destroy
all trade, when suche often returnes are
made of money, eyther the one waye or
the other. And therefore the exchange in
these daies, is no other thing then a cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taine
couetouse negotiacion, a greedye
kynde of choppinge, &amp; a colourable ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner
of chaunginge, or rather a certayne
deuise of buying and sellynge of coyne
and money, by waye of commutacion &amp;
exchaunge, which maye aptely be called
<pb n="120" facs="tcp:20795:137"/>
mercha<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>dising excha<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ge, as I haue decla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red
before, y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> same bei<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>g fou<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>d out by cha<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ce
&amp; fortune, &amp; at length by experie<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ce redu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ced
into such an arte, as is altogether a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainst
nature. For y<hi rend="sup">•</hi> occupiers thereof
doe geeue and sell moneye for moneye,
whiche was not inuented and ordeyned
to that ende, that eyther it should price it
selfe, by it selfe, or bee valued &amp; estemed
by waye of merchaundise, but that al o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
thinges shoulde receiue their prices
and value of it. And the valuation of mo<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ney
to proceede, and haue alwaies esty<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>macyon
from publique authoritie, and
the same to be perpetual and vnchange<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able,
according to a knowne standarde.
Wheras the merchant exchaunger sel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lethe
as it were, the valuation and rate
of moneye, makynge at all times, what
price he listeth: wherin he transgresseth
publique order, against al equitie &amp; com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon
iustice, practising vnder the colour
of exchaunge and rechange all the mys<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chiefe
that vsurers can deuise. And for
the closer &amp; more secrete handeling of
the same, the excha<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>gers haue imagined
<pb facs="tcp:20795:138"/>
certeine distinctions of time, to bleare &amp;
stoppe mens eies from spying their pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tensed
vsuries, &amp; counterfeyt dealings.
For when a man wyll borowe moneye
by bill of exchaunge, he is asked and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maunded,
whether hee wyll haue it at
sight, vsaunce, or double vsaunce? which
three varieties of time, bee the three dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stances,
chiefly vsed amongst mercha<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ts,
and exchaungers now a daies, although
there be manye other. And then if from
London money go by exchange at sight
for Antwarp, for xxiiij. s. the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>glish pou<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>d,
it shal go at vsance, which is a moneths
time, at xxiiij. s iiij.<abbr>d.</abbr> and at double v<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sance,
which is ij. moneths time, at xxiiij
s. viij.<abbr>d.</abbr> oftentimes at more, but seldom
times at lesse. So that for the forbearing
of a hundred <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>. pound for one moneth,
there is gotten fiue nobles, and for the
forbearing of it two monethes, there is
gotten, three pound sixe shillings eight
pence. And therefore it were as good, at
the least it were al one thinge, to say to
him that will borowe moneye by thys
exchaunge: sir, ye shall geeue mee for a
<pb n="121" facs="tcp:20795:138"/>
monethes forbearing of a hu<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>dreth pou<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
               <g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>des,
three and thyrtye shillinges and
fower pence, and for twoo monethes,
three poundes sixe shillinges and eighte
pence starlinge. And yf a hundreth
poundes bee taken for sighte, whiche is
commonlye not passing fower or fiue
dayes respicte, betwixt London &amp; Ant<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>warpe,
there is likewise gaine reaped,
more or lesse, or els men will not deale.
All whiche considered, whoe can excuse
this kinde of trade from vsurie? because
the ba<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ker, or deliuerse of mony, maketh
hys gayne before hande: setting seueral
prices vpon hys moneye deliuered for
euery distance of time. And so receiueth
more againe, then hee firste disbursed,
onely for lending of it, and for the de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>laye
of tyme, in forbearing hys money:
making other mens necessities, to serue
hys greedie couetousnes, coloured with
these straunge, and vnwonted termes
of diuersities of tymes. Wherein y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> igno<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>rant
and vnskilfull of thys kynde of tra<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>fique,
haue supposed some reasonable
<pb facs="tcp:20795:139"/>
cause, to lye hydden, for takynge suche
gayne and profite, as redoundeth to the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
by the said exchange. But in very dede,
there is no reasonable cause at all, but a
very flatt lending of mony, for luker &amp;
gayne, as all vsurers co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>monly doe. And
therfore, I can not iudge, but both these
sortes of exchaunges, aswell exchaunge
by bylles, as seeke and drye exchaunge,
are the very practises of vsury, vnder y<hi rend="sup">t</hi>
colour and tytle of exchaunge: wyshing
that no such cutting exchaunge, shoulde
bee vsed or borne withall, in anye well
gouerned and christian commo<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> weale.
But yet, because merchauntes, whiche
haue an intercourse and trade of occu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>piynge,
betwene countrie and country,
many tymes, for the furthering of their
busines, or for the benefitinge of some
mans necessitie, seeme to haue neede of
exchange: it is not forbidden, but that
they maye vse reall exchange alwayes,
before specified, so the same bee doone
without fraude, for one to serue an o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers
turne, leauing that subtill inuen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cion
<pb n="122" facs="tcp:20795:139"/>
of three distances of tyme, bargay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning,
as it were, for gredy gayne, and
gaping after profit vnlawfully, by let<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting
foorth theire money. And surelye
merchauntes should not lyue by gayne
of monye, but by gayne of wares, and
yet not sellynge tyme therein neyther:
but folowing a knowne lawfull trade,
for the maintenaunce of common socie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty,
doynge as they would bee done vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to,
and helping one an other charitably
as neede shall iustly require, and tyme
gyue oportunitie. Thus if merchaunts
would deale plainely, and simply gay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ne
without seking further aduauntage,
and sellyng for tyme as they could pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sently,
it wer charitable, it were honora<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ble,
it were profitable for al estates, yea
it would be the vniuersal benefite of Eu<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>rope,
to shaduauncement of all welfare
&amp; plenty. Wheras now, through theyre
vnmercifull dealings, in this theire bi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting
&amp; cutti<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>g excha<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ge in respect of time,
they destroy many honest men, &amp; vndoe
princes, that borowe mony of the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> after
<pb facs="tcp:20795:140"/>
that sorte, &amp; so bering all thinges at last
to vtter confusion. God open the eyes of
christian prynces, to redresse thys euill,
the onely inuencion of the deuill, to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stroye
all charitie, that in right shoulde
bee vsed betwixt man and man.</p>
            <p>The yong kyng of Portugale, beeing
about 19. yeres olde, thys January last,
hauing had the absolut gouernement of
hys kyngdome, synce the fowerteene
yere of hys age, according to the cyuill
lawe, doth deale seuerely at thys tyme
against offendors, &amp; especially againste
such as are hurtefull in theire trades to
the publique benefite of hys people.</p>
            <p>And whereas, amongst other gawles
of hys countrie, hys maiestie vnderstan<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>deth
by some godly men, that y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> exchan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ge
in hys realme is muche abused, and
practised amongst merchants there, for
gredy gaine onely: hys hyghenes hath
forbidden by proclamacion, vpon great
paynes (as I am enformed) that no ban<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ker,
or other whatsoeuer hee bee, shall
geeue anye billes of exchaunge, for any
<pb n="123" facs="tcp:20795:140"/>
maner of gayne at all: no not so muche,
as to haue consideration, for the charge
of keeping theire bookes and cassiers.
But yf anye man bee disposed to geeue
hys billes of exchaunge for anye place,
or by anye maner of wayes, hee muste
geeue oute the same freely, without ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kyng
any one peny for hys paynes, ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kyng
onely value for value, and no pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nye
ouer at any hande. For yf he doe o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>therwise,
hee incurreth straight wayes
a great penalty: the weight whereof, he
shall feele, bee he well assured. For this
must I saye, that I haue not seene better
Justice doone, nor lawes better execu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted
in anye place in Christendome, then
in Portugal. God graunt Justice els
where in euery place, y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> vsury amongst
other offenses, maye be at the last in no
place at all. And would god, that men
would ones leaue crafte, and vse playn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse,
and gett wealth vnto them law<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fully
as they oughte to doe, and in good
conscience. For suerly as men do now
lyue, especially in this matter of exchan<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ge,
<pb facs="tcp:20795:141"/>
they doe make the name of exchan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ge,
to serue their wicked purposes, en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>termedling
in the righte of princes, for
theire owne gayne, beyng lordes of coy<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ne,
to the great shame of all princes and
states. For wheras all kynges and go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uernours,
should sett a certayne rate v<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pon
theire coyne, and no man so hardye
to ouerualue the same: these bankers,
these money men, and these merchants
doe sett what price they list of moneye,
and make it eyther of hyghe value, or
meane value as they please, for theire
owne singuler commoditie and priuate
gaine. A tyme was, when prynces only
did deale with the valuation of money,
and exchaunge of the same. As firste the
coyne was rated in al cou<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>tries, at a cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tayne
value, by publique order and auc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thoritye
from the prince and state. And
then none gayned, by any exchaunge of
monye: for the value beinge knowne,
none would geue more, yea none durst
geue more. And especially in England,
in the fiue and twentye of kynge Ed<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>warde
<pb n="124" facs="tcp:20795:141"/>
the thirde capit. xij. Thexchange
was not vsed by anye subiecte, but by
the kynge onelye, vppon payne of for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feiture
of the money so exchanged. The
same lawe was likewise vsed in kynge
Rycharde the seconds dayes, and in the
thirde yeare of kynge Henrye the se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uenth,
and then did all states florishe.
For the stranger bringing in hys wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>res
into thys realme, did firste paye his
custome, by hys ofte trafikynge, and
emploiynge the moneye that he recea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ued
here vpon the commodities of thys
lande: and so paiynge custome, depar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted
home to hys country agayne, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out
cariyng anye money awaye at all
by exchange, excepte vpon great cause.
For if there were not sufficient commo<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>dities
here in wares, hee made hys ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>change
then with the kynges officers,
and none others. So that it was know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>en
certainely to the prince and officers,
what exchaunge hee made, and vppon
what cause. And then was no fraude v<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed,
yea in those dayes, merchauntes
<pb facs="tcp:20795:142"/>
were beneficiall to the prince, profita<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble
to theire countrie, and wealthye to
themselues, with ofte trading, muche
barattinge, great changing, and spee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy
sellynge of theire wares, with the
commoditie and chaffer of other coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tries.
Synce whyche tyme, the mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chants
seyng great gayne before theire
eyes by thexchange, beganne to flatter
prynces, and made offer, to lend them
great summes of moneye vppon theire
neede, if they would suffer them, to vse
thexchange one with an other. And so
they entred into a fraternitye, to haue
the exchange, amongst themselues, and
agreed vppon fower standinge ban<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kes,
to serue the pleasure of all princes.
That is to saye, at Antwarp, Lions, Ue<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>nice,
and Rome: who hauing in all these
places certayne priuileges graunted vn<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>to
them, for theire securitie (for other<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wise,
it were hyghe treason, to enter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>medle
with the valuacion of coynes, a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gaynste
the leaue of prynces) they
gaue newe valuacions to coyne, for
<pb n="125" facs="tcp:20795:142"/>
theire priuate gayne, callinge it permis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sion
money, makynge a greater value
of the coyne, then it was in hys owne
nature, &amp; by publike aucthoritie agreed
vppon: takynge occasion vppon discre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pances
and distances of tyme, and pla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ce,
to make the money dearer or chea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per,
as they pleased amongst themsel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fes:
and that after three maner of wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>yes,
at sighte, at vsance, and double v<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sance,
as is sayde before. And from these
fower places, other cityes tooke exam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple:
as London, Ciuil, Lisbone, Parys,
Roane, and Bridges, and vsed the sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>me
permission exchange, as the other
fower standing bankes did. And thys
is strange, to see a diuersitie of payme<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t
from one place to an other of equall dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance.
As for example. From Antwarpe
to London, thexchange hath been twoo
and twentye shillinges tenne pence, at
sighte: and from London to Antwarpe
agayne, it was straight wayes three &amp;
twenty shillinges. Likewise the exchan<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ge
from London to Roane, for a french
<pb facs="tcp:20795:143"/>
crowne, was fiue shillinges eighte pen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces
or tenne pence at the moste, and im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mediately,
from Roane to London, thex<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>change
was agayne sixe shillinges, or
fiue shillings eleuen pence at the least.
By whyche examples it appeareth, that
one some of moneye, of one sorte and
kynde of coyne, hath twoo pryces, and
twoo valuacions at one tyme exchan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ged,
for one distance of tyme, differing
onely, by the diuersitie of place &amp; coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trye.
Thus wee see, what merchandizes
men make of moneye, and alter coy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nes,
valued by publicke aucthoritie, to
bee of what pryce they list, for theyre
owne pryuate gayne and commoditie.
And synce thys permission exchaunge
hath ben vsed, playne dealing, and cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritable
lendinge hath bene forgotten,
bullion hath not bene brought into this
lande, artificers haue decayed, the prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces
custome in all countries hathe been
muche lessened, all lawfull tradinge,
nothinge so muche vsed, good occu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>piynge
townes haue come to ruyne,
<pb n="126" facs="tcp:20795:143"/>
and the great transportinge of wares
from one countrie to an other, nothing
so frequented amongst merchauntes,
as hath bene heretofore. And last of all,
the pryce of all wares by thys mea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nes,
hath been greatly enhaunced. And
will you see, when thexchaunge is most
vsed. Thus it is. Wher plentie of wares
is to bee solde, and good is to bee done
with the buiynge of them: thyther is
money sent in great abundance to buy
the same, and the same money rysethe
streight to a greater value, when anye
one wyll borowe to paye presente mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ney
for merchaundizes. And thus the
merchauntes paiynge for moneye af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
fifteene in the hundreth at the leaste,
although hee make a good market for
hymselfe, yet hys owne country men
shall feele a smart, when hee commethe
to sell the sayde wares at home. For
hee will so hyghten the pryce of hys
wares, that hee will lose nothynge by
thexchange at all. And so the poore chap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man,
and the playne meaning man,
<pb facs="tcp:20795:144"/>
shall paye for hys exchange euery pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nye,
besydes the gayne that the seller
will make for hys owne lyuynge. And
thys is the reason, that wares waxe
deerer in thys age, then they haue done
heretofore, onely through the deuelishe
and wicked merchaundize exchaunge.
Nowe lorde god, what meane prynces
to bee thus abused, to suffer priuate
men, to sett pryce of theire publike coy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ne,
and to make it oftentymes, to bee
more woorth, by permission exchaun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ge,
then by nature it is possible to bee:
suffering them, to change the course of
nature, as thoughe a pounde weighte,
should be more weightie then a pound,
or a pounde tale, more than a pounde
tale, or an ynche more than an ynche,
or a barley corne, more than a barley
corne. And thys I vnderstande, that cer<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>tayne
riche bankers, agreing together,
and takyng vp great masses into theire
handes, can make what value they list,
of money: for moneye must bee had,
what shifte soeuer men doe make, and
<pb n="127" facs="tcp:20795:144"/>
paye they neuer so deere, they will ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ue
it, rather then fayle of theire purpo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>se,
for wa<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t. And thys is the reason, that
not onelye great merchauntes, but also
great princes and kynges, are manye
tymes bankruptes, through the excessi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ue
paiynge for money borowed, vnder
the name of exchaunge. But moneye
was not firste deuised for thys ende,
to bee marchaundize, but to bee a mea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sure
and a beame, betwixte man and
man, for the buyinge and sellinge of
wares. And so euerye man to receyue
moneye in value, for the goodnes and
pryce of hys wares, and not that men
shoulde make money of money: a thing
so contrarye to nature, as nothinge can
bee more, and the onelye ruyne of all
trade, throughout the moste parte of
thys knowne worlde. Thus I talke,
and spende wynde in vayne, for you
master merchaunte, stande still vppon
thys, that no order can bee taken for
thexchange, because of the vncertayne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tye
of it, whiche ryseth and fallethe, as
<pb facs="tcp:20795:145"/>
the searsetye or plentye of moneye is.
And what is the cause of all thys? sure<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lye
the greedynes of man, and the coue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>touse
desyre, whiche hee hath to enry<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>che
hymselfe, by hooke or crooke. Nowe
Lord for hys mercyes sake, is there no
waye to temper thys vnsaciable desyre
and gredy couetousnes. Well, howsoe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uer
men wilbee euill, it is not good for
others to lulle them in theire euill, or to
allowe of synne: but alwayes to speake
against vice, as god hath commaunded,
and to referre the punishmente thereof
to hys iustice, in due tyme to bee minis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tred.
But I am afrayde, I haue been o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uerlonge,
in thys tediouse cause, and
hyghe mysterye of merchants occu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pacion:
and therefore I will speake no
more thereof, but shewe you now wher
no vsurye ys at all, and that in dyuers
contractes, and so declare the difference
betwixt interest and vsury.</p>
            <p>I doe buye lande of my frende for a
certayne summe of money, and of like
value to the lande, with thys condicion:
<pb n="128" facs="tcp:20795:145"/>
yf hee bringe me the money agayne, at
anye tyme, hee shall haue hys lande a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gayne.
I beyng lawfull owner of thys
lande by bargayne and sale, maye sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fely
enioye the frutes and rentes of the
same landes, without anye suspicion of
vsurye committed, and the rather for
that I haue payde the iuste value. And
(as I haue often sayde heretofore) vsu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rie
cannot bee, but where lendinge is,
&amp; the propertie altered, and the vse also
of the thynge lent, consumed. Nowe
then, hee that hathe gotten landes by
bargayne and sale in thys sorte, al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thoughe
hee haue promised, to sell backe
agayne the sayde landes, for the sayde
moneye: yet is hee true owner thereof,
and may take the fruites, without daun<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ger
or offense to god or man.</p>
            <p>Alwayes prouided, that these dealings
bee not vsed for colorable cheuisaunces,
to make indentures of bargayne and
sale, onelye for vsurie to bee exercysed,
and to auoyde thereby the daunger of
lawe. Now thys fraude &amp; thys sleyght,
<pb facs="tcp:20795:146"/>
maye bee easelye espied, yf the maner
of dealynge, bee well and aduisedlye
looked vnto. As thus. Yf the man that

it is lykely that hee seeketh the
gayne of hys monye, by the rent of that
lande, and hys monye also, when it is
offerde. Agayne, yf the moneye payde,
bee muche lesse than the lande bought:
it is moste like, there was no playne
meanynge of anye bargayne and sale,
but a deuyse, to auoyde the daunger of
lawe, and so to make gayne, by the pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fite
of the meane yssues of the lande, a

no ryghte or lawfull buiynge, where

If a merchant that liueth by his occupy<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ing
and trade, shall susteine eyther losse
for wantinge his moneye (in due tyme)
or feele hynderance of gayne, because
hys money is out of his hand: It is eue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rye
mans parte, to be thankfull, and to
remember y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> harme, that the merchaunt
hathe felt, and especyally yf the debtour
doe breake daye in not payinge of that,
which was freely le<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t vnto him, he ought
to satisfie the merchaunt to y<hi rend="sup">•</hi> vttermost,
or els hee is no good man. And to shewe
last of all, the difference betwixt interest
and vsurie, although it litle needeth, for
that the examples heretofore declare the
matter plainlye inough, for you muste
vnderstande, that vsurie is onely geuen
for the onelye benefite of lendynge for
time. Whereas interest is demaunded
when I haue susteyned losse through an
<pb facs="tcp:20795:151"/>
other mans cause, and therefore <hi>inter est
mea,</hi> that is to saye, it behoueth me, or it
belongeth to mee, or it is for mine auail,
or it is reason, that I bee aunswered all
losses and dammages, that I haue sus<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teyned
thoroughe an other mans cause,
aswell for the gayne that els I myghte
haue had by my moneye, if touche had
beene kepte, as for the losses susteyned
thoroughe an other mans faulte, that
hathe not paide mee myne owne in dew
tyme. And therefore al lawes do allow,
that men maye haue theire dammages
awarded vnto the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>. And in so doynge, an
equalitie and iuste proporcion is obser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ued
in thys sort, that whereas one hath
had benefite by mee, I shoulde likewise
susteyne no harme by hym, muche lesse
bee vndone for my well doinge, and hee
to waxe riche by my losse, that ment so
well towardes him. Thys ys agreeing
to all lawes and to naturall equytye, to
iustyce and to reason. And the name of
interest is laweful as the whyche seketh
onelye equalytye: whereas the name of
<pb n="134" facs="tcp:20795:151"/>
vsurye is odyous, vngodly, and wycked
as y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> whych seeketh al inequalitie, wher
by countryes and kyngdomes and all
good gouerned common weales, are of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten
tymes destroyed and vtterlye ouer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>throwne,
when the most doe starue, and
the fewest doe gain. And thus although
a man maye demaund interest in some
respecte, and for cause after the lone of
hys money: yet can hee not certeinelye
expresse y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> value before hand, or by anye
former contract, demau<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>d gayn for lone.
The laste part of my diuision, touchethe
the punishment of vsurers, and the al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>legatyon
of examples in all ages a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gaynste
vsurye, wherein I will bee as
shorte as I maye shewe my selfe: for I
feare mee, I haue wearied you all wyth
my tedyous talke, but suche a plenty<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full
fielde: howe maye it be lightly ran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ged
ouer? Wyth that they all said, they
weare rather refreshed then wearyed,
sauinge that the griselye merchant was
put to hys noddes now and then, wher<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>fore
sayde hee, it is good to cutte shorte.
<pb facs="tcp:20795:152"/>
And hereupon I wished bothe hym and
all others, not to geeue occasion, &amp; then
men woulde speake the lesse againste v<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>surie.
But nowe, as things go, y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> hoat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>test
wilde fier that is, is to litle, and not
hoate inoughe against vsurers, because
they swarme so muche, and are so horri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble
in their dealinges euery where. For
if I shoulde deuise to doe one a notable
displeasure, whereby to bringe hym to
vtter confusion: I coulde not set a better
frame for him of mischiefe, then to lend
hym great summes of money, vpon ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rye
good assurance to pay deepe vsurye
therfore, &amp; to forfeit great bonds therw<hi rend="sup">t</hi>
               <g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>all,
if the money bee not payde. And I
pray you, hath not this deuise ben prac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tised
with some thriftelesse enheryters,
and wastful gentlemen, of our countrey
to feede them with money vppon deepe
vsurye, and that in statute merchaunt,
vpon excessiue, and almost horrible pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nalties,
that lands worthe tenne thou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sa<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>d
<abbr>l.</abbr> haue ben forfeited for not paying
a thousa<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>d in moneye, the breache of the
statute beinge fower thousand pounde,
<pb n="135" facs="tcp:20795:152"/>
whereas the simple gentleman neuer
borowed in his life y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> nete summe of v.
hundred pound, in al y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> world? Beware
therefore how you borow vpon vsurye,
you that woulde thriue, and beware of
bondes: for surely whatsoeuer hee bee,
y<hi rend="sup">•</hi> vseth customably to borowe for gaine,
and will easely enter into great bondes,
he cannot thriue or come forward by a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nye
possible meanes, althoughe hee had
the high fauour of his prince, or y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> welth
of a Duke: suche a deuouring beast, and
consumynge woorme is vsurie, where
once it taketh place, &amp; hath made a deepe
entrie. Therefore no maruail if y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> laws
do prohibite it vpon great paines, which
I will touch in as few words as I can.
First the woord of god (as master prea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cher
hath saide very well) forbiddeth the
same expresslly in <hi>Deuteronomie, Exodus</hi> &amp;
<hi>Leuiticus.</hi> And the psalme saies. He shall
e<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ter into gods tabernacle, that hath not
lent his money for vsury. And in y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> eigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teene
of Ezechiel, all people are forbyd<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>den
to take more then theye lende: And
suche are excluded from god that take
<pb facs="tcp:20795:153"/>
any ouerplus. The general counsel cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led
<hi>Nicenum Consiliu<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
               </hi> doth vtterlye forbid
vsurie vpon great paines, but that stret<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cheth
to the cleargy. The Ciuil law dyd
neuer expresly allowe of vsury, neyther
was it possible by lawe to alter nature.
For vse can not be assygned vnto those
thyngs whiche are wasted w<hi rend="sup">t</hi> the onely
occupying of them, as wine, oyle, corne
and money are: and therefore cruell are
they that seeke to seperate the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> from the
propertie. For he that hath borowed any
thing, and so is lord of the same, by ver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tue
of hys borowynge (as all borowers
are) he hath y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> vse of the thing borowed,
which doth consume away with the bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rowing,
&amp; cannot in any wise be sepera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted
from y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> property. And therfore y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> Ci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uil
law, did rather vse a shift by caution
of bonde or oblygatyon after a certayne
time, for the lord to recouer by, that had
le<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t out his goods to an other ma<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, whiche
stoode him in steede of the property, al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>though
by duitie of nature and right, he
coulde make no clayme at all to receyue
any vse or benefite of that, which he did
<pb n="136" facs="tcp:20795:153"/>

               <p>A riche vsurer,<note place="margin">A notable ta<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>le, fitte for an vsurer to knowe.</note> beinge notorious, and
therfore often warned to amende, and
yet amending neuer the more (as many
that come to sermons, are neuer the bet<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ter)
departed this world: where, &amp; when
I cannot tell (for the booke goethe not
so farre, eyther for time or place) But
after the man was dead, his kynsemen,
that succeded him, (as ryche men wante
none) desired to haue hym buryed in the
parish church, before the hygh altare on
goddes name. The person being a zea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lous
godly man, would not burye hym
at all, no not in the churchyarde, muche
lesse in the churche, or at the hygh altar.
His kynsemen hereupon, being greatly
dismayde, offered largely to haue thys
<pb facs="tcp:20795:155"/>
fauour: but al would not serue. At le<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>gth
vnderstandinge that the person had an
asse, whiche broughte hys bookes from
hys parsonage dailye to the churche, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
a prety distance in sonder, they pol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>litikelye
desired, to obtayne thys fauor
for hym, that as his asse did dayly carrie
hys seruice bookes to the churche, so it
would please hym, that for thys one ty<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>me,
the quick asse, might take payne, to
carye thys dead asse in a coffyne, with
thys condicion, that wheresoeuer y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> asse
stayed, there the bodie should be buried,
persuading themselues, that as the asse
by an ordinarye course, vsed euery daye
to go from the parsonage to the church,
with a burden of bokes vpon his backe,
so of course, hee woulde take the same
waye, with this dead mans corps, being
cheasted, euen straighte to the churche.
The priest, vpon theire importune suy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>te,
was contented that the asse shoulde
deale in thys matter for the vsurer, and
bee hys dumme iudge: who, when hee
had the cheasted bodye vppon hys back,

to reuiue your wittes, and to quicken

               <p>A certayne famous preacher,<note place="margin">A tale, of a merchaunt in London.</note> a man
most zelous in religion, and therewith
so vehement agaynst synne (as I know
fewe hys lyke within thys land) made a
sermon, not many yeres past at Pau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>les
crosse: whiche sermone was wholye
agaynste vsurye, wherein hee shewed
hymselfe, both very well learned, and
also ryghte godlye, and (as I thinke) hee
dyd good to some. The same Preacher
dyned the same daye, eyther with the
maior or sherif, or some other mercha<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t:
but whyther, I cannot wel tell. And co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ming
to dinner, the partie dyd welcome
hym, as it seemed, hartely: and glosed
yet in dede, as it fell out afterward, sai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ynge
that hee doubted not, but hee had
done great good that daye, in speaking
so muche againste vsurye, and therfore
<pb n="141" facs="tcp:20795:158"/>
thanked hym. Where upon an other fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mylier
acquaintaunce of the sayde mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chaunte,
sayd vnto hym serretly. What
meane you sir, to geeue thys man so
great thankes, for speakyng so much a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainst
vsurie? I doe not knowe hym in
London, that gayneth more by hys mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ney

you speake eyther holowly, or not

you are a foole. I do thanke him, &amp; tha<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ke
hym agayne, for wote you what? The
fewer vsurers that hee can make, the
more shalbee my gayne: for then, men
shall chefely seeke me out. For doe you
thinke, that hee can persuade me, to lea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ue
so swete a trade, for a fewe woordes
of hys trolling tong? No by the roodes
bodye can hee not: and therfore I will
clawe him, and saye wel might he fare,
and godds blessing haue he too. For the
more hee speaketh, the better it itchith, &amp;
maketh better for mee. Thus you see,
that notwithstandinge the straightenes

agaynste them, saiynge that vsu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rie
is a gaynefull piracie, contrarye to
nature, vpon the lone of any thing, that
consisteth vppon weighte, measure and

doe thinke it not to be synne, to le<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>de for

yf hee do thinke it to bee synne and

it is impossible, by the order and
course of nature, that once one, shoulde
bee twise one: whiche the vsurers goe
about to make, heapinge and gathering

the malyce of man seekethe not to ouer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>throwe?
Wherefore <hi>Tiberius Caesar,</hi> to
remedy this euill, and because he would
not that there shoulde bee any vsury oc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cupyed
at al, did put a maruelous masse
of money in banke to the summe of <hi>mil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lies
sestertium,</hi> which as <hi>Budaeus</hi> sayeth, a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mounteth

pound sterlinge, and toke order, that e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uery
man should haue credyte for three
yeres without paying any vsurie there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
at all, so that the debtour were able
to put in a sufficient pawne or suerty, to
y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> double value of that hee borowed. And
last of al, not onely all maner of vsurye
was forbidden by diuers edicts &amp; procla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>macions,
but also al maner of exchange
<pb facs="tcp:20795:163"/>
for gain:<note place="margin">Cornelius Ta<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>citus.</note> for (as <hi>Cornelius Tacitus</hi> saieth)
thys canker of vsurye, is an olde veno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mous
sore, and is the chiefest hed &amp; cause
of rebellion and variance in countreys,
and therfore it was altogether banished
in the olde time, when leaste corruption
of lyfe appered amongst men. <hi>Iulius Cae<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sar</hi>
made a lawe, that whatsoeuer was
payde aboue the pryncipall for the very
lone, the same shoulde bee defalked out
of the principall, and noe manne to bee
charged with more, then with that only
which was meerely borowed. There is
a constitucion in the name of the Em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peror

if any man did vse this trade secretly, or
by any colourable meanes, and thereof
was conuicted: he loste by and by all his
goods, aswel immoueable as moueable,
the same to bee as an excheate confysca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted
to the Emperours Exchequer. And
yet, if the same offendour had a wife, she
had the thirde parte of his goods assyg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned
to her: so that shee tooke a corporall
othe, and dyd sweare that her husbande
<pb n="146" facs="tcp:20795:163"/>
vsed this kind of vsury, altogether with
oute her consent or knowledge. But yf
shee refused to take this othe, then were
al the goods of this man straight waies
forfeyted as I sayde, and he excommu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nicated
from the company of Chrystian
men, tyll hee had made amendes, and
was becom a new man, according to the
prescript order of the lawe.</p>
               <p>The Germanes dyd not knowe in the

               <p>The Lacedemonians dyd bannysh vsu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rye

whereas al Egipt was sore ouerlayd w<hi rend="sup">t</hi>

Amongst others, <hi>Agis</hi> Duke of the La<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cedemonyans,
is so thought to haue ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted
vsury, that he burned all the vsurers
bookes with a flaminge fier, in the open

<hi>Cato</hi> beinge a sharp and seuere man, did

to pasture wel, that is, to haue good pas<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turinge
for cattell. Beynge asked what
was the seconde point, he aunswered, to
pasture sufficiently well: that is to saye,
<pb n="147" facs="tcp:20795:164"/>
not to ouerlay the pasture. Being asked
what was the thirde, he sayde: to clothe
well, that is, not to exceede in apparell.
And asked what was the fowerthe, hee
said, to till the ground: that is, to main<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teyne
husbandrye, for plentye of corne.
Last of all, beyng demaunded what hee
thought of lending money for vsury, he
aunswered, marye what is it (quod he)
to kill a man? shewynge by this, that v<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>surye
is a very murderer of mankynde.
<hi>Tullie</hi> in his first booke of offyces, com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pareth
the vsurers to vile artificers, that
geat their wealth by lying deadlye and
vtterynge falsehed to saue them selues
from famine. And with the vsurer, hee
reconeth tolletakers, customers, &amp; suche
money officers, that pille and polle both
prynce &amp; people, wheresoeuer they beare
aucthoritie. <hi>Aristotle</hi> saieth, that vsurers
and baudes maye well goe together, for
they gayne by filthy meanes all y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> theye
geat.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Plato</hi> that diuine Philosopher, and most
Christian writer, in his fift booke of la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wes,
or of lawe makinge, as he geeueth
<pb facs="tcp:20795:165"/>
the title, warneth among other thinges
that no body whatsoeuer he bee, that wil
beare the face of an honest man, do lette
out his money for vsurye or gaine. And
saith farther, if any do put forth his mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ney
for vsurie, it shalbe well allowed in
him that so boroweth, if he neuer pay the
principal again, much lesse the vsury ri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sing
therupo<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>. If this <hi>Plato</hi> were now ly<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uing,
&amp; had y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> place of a councellor to her
maiestie, &amp; would mainteine such an ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gument,
many riche vsurers would vt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terly
cry out vpon suche a magistrate.</p>
               <p>Ther is a boke in greeke of <hi>Plutarches</hi>
doyng against vsurie, in which he cou<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
                  <g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>celeth
al men not to borow vpon vsury,
&amp; therewith dothe condempne the whole
manner of lendinge for gaine. And hys
reasons be these.</p>
               <p>1 It is against the rule and order of na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture,
that nothing should brynge forthe
somthing for y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> le<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ding. Besides this, the
property of the goods is an other mans
&amp; not mine, &amp; so it is nothing to me, and
therfore against nature that any thyng
should come of nothing, which is y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> gain
<pb n="148" facs="tcp:20795:165"/>
ouer &amp; aboue the principal.</p>
               <p>2 It taketh away also fro<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> poore, their
chiefest comfort, &amp; that is, the quyetnes
of their mynd, which theye cannot haue
when theye are forced to bee carefull to
aunsweare the byting vsurie, ouer and
aboue the principal howsoeuer they doe
speede.</p>
               <p>3 It deuoureth gayne before it can bee
gotten, takynge vsurye in the hundred
and not vpon the hundred, as these wic<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ked
wretches doe.</p>
               <p>4 It enforceth those that paye deepe v<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>surie,
to take vp vpon double vsance, so
that the more they borrowe, and the lo<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
                  <g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger
they tarrye: the nygher theye are to
vtter destruction. And sayethe hee, these
vsurers are lyke vnto these great raue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nynge
foules called <hi>Harpiae,</hi> that weare
sent from the gods (as y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> poets do faine)
to deuower blynde <hi>Phineus</hi> meate from
hym, so often as anye was layde before
hym, because he had at the request of his
seco<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>d wife, being stepmother to his two
childre<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, by his first wife <hi>Cleopatra,</hi> yelded
to y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> plucking out of hys childrens eyes:
<pb facs="tcp:20795:166"/>
so the vsurers do deuower all y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> goods y<hi rend="sup">t</hi>
any ma<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> hath, as those vgly beasts did eat
<hi>Phincus</hi> meat fro<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> him whe<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> he was blind.
5 Lastlye, hee condempneth all vsurye
for this reason, because that all men for
the moste parte, doe borrowe to satisfye
theire sinfull luste, and fonde desire, in
vayne expences and needelesse cost and
charges. And therefore he willeth suche
as wilbe vnthrifts, that they do not bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rowe
vpon vsurie, and so paye moneye
for money, the woorst bargayne that a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nye
man can make: but rather that they
doe sell their landes out right, to get for
them what they can at the firste, because
they shal haue more that way by a great
deale, then by the vsurer, who wil make
them lose al for a lytle, and to sell theire
la<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ds altogether, for a trifle, as I knowe
dyuers men haue done in thys realme.
Thus farre <hi>Plutarche,</hi> that great lerned
Clarke. Yea, what godly wyse ma<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> was
there euer, that did not enueigh agaynst
vncharitablenes, and beat downe vsury
flatte to the grounde, by all waies possi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble?
yea what tyme, what gouernment,
<pb n="149" facs="tcp:20795:166"/>
or what state is or hathe beene, that dyd
not abhorre thys vgly monster and Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terpiller
vsury? And to come home after
the rehersal of so many forein &amp; strange
decrees, not only by princes in al ages,
but also by priuate lerned me<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> i<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> al times.
Dyd not the Emperoure <hi>Charles</hi> of fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mous
memory, in Anno 1530. assemble a
dyet at <hi>Augusta</hi> in high Almain, &amp; there
conclude by thaduyse and assent of the
whole Empire, that no maner of co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>tract
y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> had any felowship with vsury, should
bee allowed? but rather that all vsurye
shoulde be auoided for euer, and bee ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uer
more vsed. And if anye were founde
to haue made anye suche contracte, the
same man strayght wayes forfett to the
magistrate and ordinary Judge, the fo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>werth
parte of hys principall summe, so
put forthe to vsurie. And if y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> magistrate
were negligent in this behalfe, &amp; would
foreflowe to punyshe suche offendours,
the Emperours procurator had auctho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritie
to call the officer before him, and to
punyshe him wyth forfeyture of two or
three markes of pure golde.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb facs="tcp:20795:167"/>
In oure time, that godlye prince kynge
Edwarde the sixt, yea godly may I wel
call hym, dyd make an acte of Parlya<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment,
that noe man might put oute hys
money for any gaine at all, neither dy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rectlye,
nor indirectlye, and appoynted
paynes against thoffendours in that be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>halfe,
as you master temporall Lawyer
knowe better then I. Thus I haue led
you a long waye in worldlye punyshe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments,
aswell by the Canon lawes, as
by the Emperours laws, which are cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led
Ciuyll, and the statutes also of dy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uers
other countreis and natyons. But
lorde, what are these punyshementes in
comparison of gods sharp rodde and se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uere
iudgement in the life to come? The
scrypture of god you haue partly heard,
but the threates and punishements per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>happes,
you do not wel remember, nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
haue I a<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>plified them, as they are to
be vttered. But lorde god, what a diffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rence
is there betwixt the punyshments
of thys life, and the sharpe vengeance of
god in the life hereafter, as you master
Preacher haue often sayde? The paines
<pb n="150" facs="tcp:20795:167"/>
in this life, are in deede but transitorye
and for time: but the paines in that life,
are perpetual, and shal neuer haue end.
Yea, such and so horrible shall the smart
bee, as noe mouthe can vtter, nor tong
expresse: a bottomlesse hell, a deuouring
furnace, and a fier vnquencheable, pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pared
for the deuill and his angelles, to
burne foreuer with tormentes eternall.
God bee mercyfull vnto vs, and holde
hys holy hande ouer vs and defende vs.</p>
               <p>And nowe commethe to my mynde, a
matter moste needefull to bee spoken of
after such heates of speach vsed agaynst
the vsurer,<note place="margin">Whether y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> bo<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>rower bee an offendoure as the vsurer is.</note> and that is, whether hee that
payeth vsurye bee an offendour or noe?
For some thinke that because there can
bee noe vsurye wythoute borowynge,
these therefore that borow, are in fault,
as they which do geue cause of this hor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rible
offence, seekynge out these money
men, &amp; so after a sort, do compel the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> to be
vsurers, y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> els wold not put out their mo<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ney,
if they were not merueilously e<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>trea<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ted
therunto, &amp; knew not vnto who<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> they
<pb facs="tcp:20795:168"/>
might lend. I do aunswere, that euerye
borower doth not sinne, because it is an
inuoluntarie action, and muche against
the borowers will, to paye money vpon
vsury, who woulde rather wyth all hys
harte, borow freelye, and pay nothinge
for the lone then otherwise. Yea, it is as
muche agaynste his will, to pay vsurye
for money, if he might haue it freely: as
that mans deede is inuoluntarye, whoe
being in a shippe, and in great peril, cas<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teth
his goods that are in the sayd shyp,
into the main sea, to saue himself harm<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>les,
by lightening the ship for the tyme.
And as he that being set vpon by theues
in the high way, geueth his purse frely,
rather then hee woulde haue hys throte
cutte violentlye, and yet god knowethe
it is muche against his will to part with
his money: Euen so the poore nedy man
boroweth, that seeth hymselfe readye to
starue, except hee be presently relieued,
who yeldeth rather to be half vndo<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, for a
time, in hope to recouer himself againe,
by some odde meanes hereafter, the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> suf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fereth
himself to be vndone, both he and
<pb n="151" facs="tcp:20795:168"/>
his for euer, for want of present reliefe.
Againe wher thentent is not euil, nor y<hi rend="sup">•</hi>
minde consenting to sinne, as allowing
it, but rather altogether vnwillynge to
yeelde thereunto, as vnto sinne: whoe
can say that he offendeth, whose mynde
is sounde, pure, and vndefiled. And ys
there anye so madde to thynke, muche
lesse to saye, that he had rather wyth all
his hart pay for y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> lone of money, then to

This case is likewise to bee proued true
in an other matter, betwixt the landlord
and the tenaunt: for the landlorde maye
so oppresse hys tenaunt, wyth takynge
a great fine, and enhaunsing his rents,
that he may vndoe the poore<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> tenant for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>euer,
and so commit deadlye sinne, and
yet the poore tenaunt nothing to be bla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med.<note place="margin">Ext. de locat.</note>
For god knoweth he woulde haue
had hys farme better cheape, and haue
payde lesse rent with all hys harte,<note place="margin">Bart. L. vlt.</note> yf it
had so pleased his landlord.<note place="margin">Cod. De indic<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ta viduitate tollenda.</note> Thus wher
the reason in offending betwixt twoe is
not like, the punishment should not ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tend
to the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> both.<note place="margin">C. super 10.</note> And of this opinion are
diuers Doctors,<note place="margin">Ext. de vsuris</note> as <hi>Archidiaconus, Imola
Laurentius de Rodolphis</hi> wyth others. Al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>beit
ther be, that are of a co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>trary mynd,
&amp; would haue y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> receiuer, to be cou<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ted an
offendor, aswel as y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> le<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>der, &amp; yet not eue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry
receiuor neither, but suche as borowe
<pb n="153" facs="tcp:20795:170"/>
to spend wantonly and vnthriftely, and
induce them, to lend for gayne, that else
haue not vsed so to do, nor would not yf
they had not been greatly constrayned,
and almost driuen to lend, against their
wils. Such borrowing in deede, by such
men, semeth to induce others to synne,
and they themselues doe sinne, that doe
thus borowe, to serue theire lust and co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uetouse
desyre, not he that boroweth to
gayne honestly, and saue himselfe from
staruing. And therfore, as I would not
haue vnthriftes to borrowe, so would I
haue lenders to take hede, what maner
of me<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> they be, vnto whom they doe le<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>d,
and not respect so muche their owne co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
                  <g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>modity,
by gettinge of vnthriftes into
their daunger, as the benefyte of them,
and hys great necessity, vnto who<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> they
are desyred to le<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>d. For surely they do of
fende much, that are ouer hastie in len<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding,
when they see present gayne com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ming
to themselues, and vtter vndoing
readye for others. And thus, as I haue
sayd some what of borrowers, excusing
some from synne, and accusing others
<pb facs="tcp:20795:171"/>
of synne: so will I speake of theire mise<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry
that are driue<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> to borrowe. And thus
I saye, hee that wanteth, and is forced
to craue, must of necessitie be dryuen to
fawne, to flatter, to lye, to submyt hym<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selfe
to an other mans will, &amp; to speake
oftentimes against his own conscience,
and so to falsifie hys fayth all together.
Such a one is not meete to be trusted in
matters of weight, concerning the sta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>te,
especially yf hee bee greatly in debte
through loose dealings. For men being
needy, will commonly yelde to muche
euil, before they will starue: &amp; yet not al
poore men are vnfitte for aucthoritie,
but some more fitte tha<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> some ryche me<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>.
Such onely are vnfit as are in daunger
to others for debt, into y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> which they are
falle<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, through theire owne foly, &amp; know
not how to paye y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> same agayne, by any
good or lawful meanes. And thys is ve<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ry
pityful to heere, y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> hee who is once in
miserable debt through vsurie, ca<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> neuer
gett out again, except some great good<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nes
do happe<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> vnto hym. For y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> more he
borroweth vppon vsurye, the more hee
<pb n="154" facs="tcp:20795:171"/>
oweth still, so that hys myserie is infy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nyte,
hys losse still encreasynge, &amp; hym
selfe decaiynge and consuming awaye,
as waxe or butter, melteth at the sunne.
For as time goeth away, and tarieth no
man, so the vsurer taketh euer the bene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fite
of tyme, and gayneth by course of
the sunne, by a cleane contrarie waye to
all others. For wheras y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> sunne helpeth
housbande men in theire haruest, &amp; at
these tymes, whe<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> they take paynes and
trauayle for theire liuynge: the vsurer
getteth gayne throughe tyme by verye
ydlenes, a fytte man to be openly whip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ped
for a commun rogue.</p>
               <p>They therfore, that would bee without
daunger of suche deuils, and not stande
in neede of them, lett them somewhat
harken to me, and they shalbee eased by
gods grace. I woulde haue euery bodye
lyue in order, folowe hys vocation, bee
not wastefull, spende nothing vaynelie,
looke twise vppon theire money before
they laye it out, and that theire expen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ses,
doe not excede theire reuenues, but
rather to lyue vnder than aboue theire
<pb facs="tcp:20795:172"/>
degree, remembringe alwayes, that in
sparing is great gettynge. Thus shall
they haue the lesse neede to borowe, a
better harte to lyue, and a more quyet
conscience to god warde, whe<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> they shal
spende of their owne, and owe nothing
to any bodye, but good wil and charity:
And I tell you, it is a true saiynge, <hi>faelix
qui nihil debet,</hi> happy is hee that oweth
nothyng, hee sleapeth sounde sleapes, he
taketh lyttle thought, and so passeth the
course of hys lyfe, with muche ioye and

               <p>There ys a pleasaunt tale, in one of <hi>A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ristophanes</hi>
Commodyes, whyche I wyll
shewe vnto you, and somewhat enlarge
it for myne own pleasure, the rather to
refreshe youre wyttes, with some mery
matter, who<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> I haue thorowly weried, I
am afrayde, with a longe discourse.</p>
               <p>Thys <hi>Aristophanes,</hi> beynge the moste
pleasau<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t deuiser of Commodies and en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terludes
that euer wroate, hath one com<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>modie
amongst the rest, whiche hee inti<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>tuleth
<hi>de nubibus,</hi> of the clowdes, and he
deuised it, at the requeste of <hi>Socrates</hi> ene<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>myes
<pb n="155" facs="tcp:20795:172"/>
to mocke hym thereby, and to
bring hym in hatred with the people,
as one, that broughte into the Ci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tye,
worshyppynge of newe goddes.
And amongst other thynges, hee brin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>geth
in one <hi>Strepsiades,</hi> an aged man, all
together shipwracked by frayghting w<hi rend="sup">t</hi>
vsury, who offered hymselfe, to bee one
of <hi>Socrates</hi> schollers, to learne thereby y<hi rend="sup">•</hi>
rather of him, the waye and maner how
to deceiue hys creditours, &amp; not to paye
them theire monethes vsurie, whiche
was vsual amongst y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> Grecians, to paye
theire creditours, at the begynnynge of
euery newe moone. Unto who<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>e, when
<hi>Socrates</hi> made aunswere, that hee coulde
not geeue hym any counsell to deceyue
hys creditours, hee called hys wyttes to
hym, as one that was brought to an af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terdeale,
and desired <hi>Socrates</hi> to tell him,
yf that way were not good, whiche hee
had deuysed, for (quod he) I haue found
out a waye, that I shalbee eased of my
burden. As for example. What yf I buy
a witche of <hi>Thessalia,</hi> and by her enchan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tements
doe fetche the moone oute of
<pb facs="tcp:20795:173"/>
heauen, and bringe it awaye, and after<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wardes
enclose it in a case of glasse, and
so kepe it, as I woulde keepe a flee in a
boxe. And what good (sayethe <hi>Socrates)</hi>
woulde that bee to the? Mary, quod
<hi>Strepsiades,</hi> if the moone doe neuer ryse
agayne, I shall neuer pay myne vsurie.
And why so, sayethe <hi>Socrates,</hi> forsoothe
(quod he) because men paye theire vsu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rie
euer, at the begynnynge of the news
moone, and not before. Thus you see,
to what a straunge shifte thys poore
man was dryuen, euen to plucke by
violence; the moone out of heauen, for
hys helpe. And of truth y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> witche did her
best, and began to charme the moone,
which when the creditour vnderstoode,
hee was put in such a peltinge chafe, as
was wonderful to heare: and accusinge
thys poore debtour of enchauntement,
wente hymselfe to an other wytche, not
onelye to keepe the moone from com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ming
out of heauen, but also to hasten
the course of it faster, that he myght the
sooner haue hys moneye.</p>
               <p>But lord what a trouble was the moo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ne
<pb n="156" facs="tcp:20795:173"/>
put vnto, betwene these two wit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ches?
what stormes and tempestes dyd
ryse? what horrible wynde did blowe?
what great rayne did fall? what floodes
ensued euery where? what countries
were almoste drowned and vnder the
water in manye places, as of late it was
here with vs? At what time, I feare me,
some faythlesse people were yeldinge
themselues to the dyuels deuocyon, to
bringe theire wicked purposes aboute:
and I thinke, it was some vsurers prac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tyse,
to hasten the yeare forwarde. But
all thys I haue hytherto rehearsed, to
shewe the myserable state of poore deb<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tours,
and the greedye desire of wic<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ked
creditours, that like as the one for
mere necessitye was dryuen to a mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ueilous
rare shyfte, to auoyde hys debt
and the penaltie thereof: so the other of
an vnmercifull crueltie, sought as ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tremely,
to hasten the retorne of hys
moneye, by the swyfte course of the
moone. Thys impossible dryfte, and
vnnaturall fetche that the poore man
<pb facs="tcp:20795:174"/>
was put vnto, proceded vpon the vncha<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ritable
dealinges of the vsurers in those
dayes. For whosoeuer failed of paiyng
hys debte and vsurie, the firste daye of
the newe moone (for so the Grecians &amp;
olde Romaynes also did lend, from mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neth
to moneth, and for no lo<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ger time)
the partie vppon an execucion, was by
and by taken, and bound with a corde,
and so committed to prison,<note place="margin">Caelius Rho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diginus. lib. 12 &amp; 20. de ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>xis, &amp; necte<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>

and rotte, eyther at hys owne charges,
or els, yf hee had not wherewith to find
himselfe, the creditour gaue hym a little

much onely as would fynd nature, and
so he lyued in that miserye, till he dyed.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Septimius Florens</hi> reporteth, if one man
were a debtour to many, hys body was
geeuen vnto them, to bee equally cut in
peces, and wheras hee had not to paye
in his purse, hys quartered body should
paye for all, to geue a terrour to others,
how to breake with theire creditours, &amp;
as thys was amongst the Romaynes,
so the Grecians vsed the same.</p>

and so haynous &amp; hurtfull hee found

certayne moderate stay, or meane rate.
Therfore, wee commaunde those noble
me<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, that are Erles, or their betters, that

that do aduenture their goodes beyond

demaunde by firme promise, to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceyue
twelue in the hundred, and in no

hee shall not haue any benefite, by actio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>

a drynkynge peny, or a trifle for theire
pleasure. Or that they will bee allowed
for brocage money, or to the scryuener,
for wryting of thindentures, or for any

bee done, the principal debte shalbe dimi<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>nished

matter, and in fauour of thys lawe, ther
is amongst others one <hi>Carolus Molineus,</hi>
a Frenche man, a notable lawyer vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>doubtedly,
and one that lately lyued, &amp;
such a one as shoulde seeme to bee of a
most godlie spiryte, referringe all hys
doynges to charity, whiche (hee sayeth)
yf it bee kepte amongst men, there can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not
bee anye vsurie committed. For as
you master lawyer haue sayd to master
Ockerfoe, so longe as neyther parte ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>keth
harme, but rather profyt, and is the
better for suche their tradinge, how can
it bee countted an offence to god? Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cepte
<pb facs="tcp:20795:178"/>
you will saye, that therfore it is an
offence, because god hath expreslye for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bidden
it? which if it be so in deede, then
there is no remedie to the contrary. For
looke what god forbiddeth, no man
should allowe. But herein <hi>Molinaeus</hi> de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sireth
an interpretacion, and saieth that
vsurye is not forbidden, but where cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritye
is broken, and my neyghboure
da<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>pnefied by some exaction. And wher
it is sayde, that therefore wee shoulde
not le<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>de for gayne, because <hi>Christ</hi> saieth,
<hi>Mutuum date nihil inde sperantes,</hi> Here
hee speaketh not of vsurie, sayeth he, but
of restitucion of the pryncipall agayne,
or a like good turne. And that thys is
true, it semeth most euident to hym, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause
<hi>Christ</hi> speaketh there, against those
onely, that geeue vnto them as good a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gayne,
which thyng heathe<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> men and sin<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ners
doe. But the seruauntes of <hi>Christe</hi>
shoulde lende, and not loke at all for the
principal agayne, as who shoulde saye,
they shoulde lende to the poore &amp; needie
without all hope, to haue theire owne a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gayne.
And therefore <hi>Christ</hi> requireth of
<pb n="161" facs="tcp:20795:178"/>
his disciples, a greater perfection and
righteousnes, then the gentyles or hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>then
doe shew. That is to saye, that they
lende to the poore and needye with thys
mind and intent, that although y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> poore
men are neuer lyke to restore penye a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gaine,
yet they may be glad and readye
to helpe their needye neighbour at al ti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mes,
for gods sake. And so farre vnlike
it is, that suche a good turne shoulde bee
l<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>st and dye: that god him selfe wil geue
a more plentyfull rewarde, when man
doth looke for the lesse rewarde of men.
Therefore as Christ will not, that anye
man shal lend vnto those onely, that are
able to repay them againe, but rather to
haue an eye, how to do good to our nee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy
and poore brother, then to looke that
our lent money bee in safetie, &amp; in a sure
hande: So if my neighbour and brother
be not in suche neede, but that hee maye
with his ease paye, not onely the princi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pall,
but also geue me somewhat for my
good will and frendshyp, god dothe not
forbid any suche dealinge. As lykewyse
god did not forbid a man to ask his own
<pb facs="tcp:20795:179"/>
agayne by order of lawe. But Christes
meanyng and intent is, that we should
alwaies haue regard vnto charitie, &amp; to
consider the state &amp; case of oure brother.
And Christ doth shew ther at large, how
wee shoulde vse the poore, which eyther
at all bee not able to paye vs, or elles
wyth theire ease cannot conuenyentlye
answeare the debte in time. Therfore it
is not agaynste charitie to take any ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner
of vsurye sayeth he: but to take with
the hurte and losse of my brother, that is
it, whiche is offensiue and dysallowed.
For yf thy brother do gayne any thinge
by thy moneye, and hee thereof do geue
thee parte, thou doste take parte of the
blessinge of god, and not anye parte of
an other mans good. Neither ought the
offence of vsurye bee measured by the
quantitie of that whyche is taken, but
by the harme and losse which thy neigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bour
hathe susteyned, so that the same
quantitie of takynge do not exceede, the
boundes lymytted by the polytique la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wes:
shewynge that noe man shall for
anye cause whatsoeuer, take ouer and
<pb n="162" facs="tcp:20795:179"/>
aboue twelue pounde in the hundred
and yet not all neyther, canne take
twelue in the hundred, but the mercha<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
                  <g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tes
onely that do aduenture their goods
ouer Seas, and into farre countreys,
hazardynge their wares by aduenture.
Others shall take but eyght, and some
but sixe in the hundred by <hi>Iustinians</hi>

               <p>  I would
haue it free for euery man, without any

anye money at all, that there might bee
a rate appoynted, beyonde whyche, noe
man shoulde passe. Marye. I would that
the merchant should lende at all times,
and for all causes, for twenty if they list
in the hundred, wythout contradiction,
although he do not hazard, nor adue<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ture

no charitie, no loue, hee would haue the
most y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> is possible to be had, &amp; so woulde
haue it at libertie, which is worst of all.
For then wheras some men would wil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lingly
lend for .x. or xij. at the most: he w<hi rend="sup">t</hi> 
others would engrosse to them selues al
the moneye that they coulde geate after
that rate, and so when scarcitye came,
they woulde put the same moneye oute
agayne for fifteene, naye for twentye.
Whyche weare a cruell dealynge and
a crafty practise also: not vnlike to those

For so these subtyll and deceyptfull

can geate after .x. or twelue in the hun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dred
and so put it out straight waies a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gaine
as I here say, for fifteene, nay xx.
and more in the hundred: a wicked and
a most vnchristian engrossing, and god
<pb n="164" facs="tcp:20795:181"/>
forbyd that you or anye man should doe
so. Touchyng your gentle moderatyon

he taketh nothing ouer. This is a righ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teous
man, he shall surely liue sayth the
lorde god. If hee nowe geat a sonne that
is a murtherer, a shedder of blood. If he

doe one of these things (thoughe hee doe

<pb facs="tcp:20795:183"/>
diuers thinges, and by them I do iudge,
of thys texte twyse rehearsed whyche
is, hee that lendethe freelye, and ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>keth

man, he shall surelye lyue. But hee that
lendeth vpon vsurye, and takethe anye
more ouer: shall this man liue? he shall
not liue. I woulde anye of vs weare so
well learned, as to vnderstande the He<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brue.
For I thynke thys matter weare
soone ended. The greatest clerkes as
<hi>Leo Iudas, Oecolampadius</hi> and others, doe
not turne this place into latin out of the
Hebrue in suche sort as wee do expound
it in Englishe. For in steede of the olde
translation <hi>plus,</hi> whiche is more, they do
translate <hi>super abundantiam,</hi> that is ouer
abundance, or ouer excessiue, whiche in
deede is wicked and dampnable to doe.
For then men are bitten, &amp; oppressed,
and not when anye smal tryfle is taken
ouer. The lyke that is sayd agaynste v<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>surye,
is sayd also in the same text twise
of hym that geenethe hys debtoure hys
pledge agayne. The same man is rygh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teous,
<pb n="166" facs="tcp:20795:183"/>
hee shall surelye lyue sayethe the
lorde. But hee that geeueth not the deb<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tour
hys pledge againe, shall that man
lyue? Noe. hee shall not lyue. Nowe I
praye you sir, howe will you expounde
thys texte? hee that geeueth, or geeueth
not the debtour hys pawne againe, shal
euerye man lendynge vpon a pawne to
anye one whatsoeuer hee bee, geeue hys
pawne agayne beynge not able to paye
the debte? In good soothe, then men bee
more then madde, that wyll redeeme
theire pawnes, when Ezechiel wylleth
that euerye creditour shall delyuer to e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uerye
debtour his pawne agayne, or els
hee shall not lyue. Assuredlye me thyn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>keth

wee are all gathered together in his ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lie

neuer in anye worlde, as I thinke. And
what other thing is this, than wilfullye
to warre with god, and vtterly to defie
his holy lawes? to offende of sett purpo<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>se
agaynst the holy ghost, and so to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dempne
oure sowles eternally? The
word of god ys true for euer. And these
scriptures that I haue alledged, are
gods owne woordes, whiche yf you wil
not beleue and followe, you shall all pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rishe
euerye one of you, and bee damp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned
for euer. And as surely as god ly<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ueth,
I saye still vnto you. No vsurer
shall enter into the kyngdome of hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uen,
except hee doe repent vnfaynedly,
and call to god for grace. And like as he
is a theefe, that stealeth but one halfe
peny, with a felonyous entente, so is he
an vsurer, that by contracte taketh but
one halfe peny, ouer and aboue the prin<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>cipall,
<pb facs="tcp:20795:189"/>
in respecte of tyme, and both are
deadly synners before god. For le<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ding
must bee free, without anye thynge ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kyng
ouer, by couenaunte made before
hande, or els it is no lending, but an o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
kynde of contracte wythout name,
neuer yet vsed, no nor possibly, as I ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ke
it, to bee vsed by anye lawe, being all
together agaynst reason, lawe, and na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture.
For no man can reasonably and
dutifully make anye writinge, to haue
more then is hys own in ryght to haue.
And what ryghte hath any body to that
which is an other mans? as al ouerplus
is, being no parte of the principal lone?
Or what man can put that in wrytyng,
whiche is an other mans goodes, for
hymselfe to recouer, as hys owne pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per
lent goodes? And yet these vsurers,
to benefite themselues, will bee noto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rious
lyers, for they will saye, yea and
haue it put downe in writinge also, that
they lent a hundreth poundes, when in
deede they neuer deliuered aboue <hi>80.</hi> li.
or perhaps some smal portion ouer. And
here they shewe playnelye, whose scho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lers
<pb n="172" facs="tcp:20795:189"/>
they bee, namelye the very children
of Sathan, for he is a lyer, &amp; the aucthor
of lyes. So that suche, as will nedes ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ue
gayne for tyme, and forbearing pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sent
payement, bee the gayne neuer so
lyttle, do not onely destroy altogeather
that louing, charitable and free trade of
borrowing and lending, which oughte
to be amongst men, but also shewe the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
                  <g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selues
to bee very lyers, both in woorde
and wrytinge, puttinge that in their ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligacion,
whiche they dyd neuer lende.
And now, yf a man would reason with
them of the tyme, I pray you let vs con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sider
of it a lyttle. Hee that borroweth,
is Lorde of the thinge borrowed, imme<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diatlye
after that it ys deliuered vnto
hym. And then, yf thys vsurer will bee
payde for the deliuering of hys moneye
in respecte of tyme, he must be aunswe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red
for so muche tyme, whyle hee is in
deliuering of the money, for immediat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
after the money is deliuered, it is no
more hys, that did lende it, but strayght
wayes it is hys that hath borrowed it.
And what reason is it, that a man shall
<pb facs="tcp:20795:190"/>
paye vsurie, for halfe an howers forbea<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ring
of his mony? Yea many tymes not
halfe a quarter of an hower, althoughe
the payement be a hundreth poundes, if
it were in soueraignes of one coyne.
And why should anye man pay for no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing,
some thing, as they do, that paye
for the lone of mony any thinge ouer &amp;
aboue the principal? For, as master Ci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uilyan
hath well sayd, the vse cannot be
seperated from the thinge, and then hee
that hath the vse of a thinge, and so the
propertie by vertue of borrowing, howe
can it bee, that any man can aske anye
thyng of hym for nothynge, seeynge he
is Lorde of all, by vertue of hys bor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rowinge
for the time? Againe, by what
lawe, or ciuill vnderstandinge, should
anye one haue an other mans goodes
for naught, as they haue that reape the
frute of an other mans labour and indu<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>strie,
for the onely lone of money, which
being once lente, is none of hys, for the
tyme that hee dyd lende it, but hys pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perlie,
that did borrowe it, who must in
reason haue all the profite alone, yf any
<pb n="173" facs="tcp:20795:190"/>
can bee gott with that mony, for the ty<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>me
hee hath the vse of it? Thirdlye, who
did euer see coyned siluer, and curraunt
money growe, which must nedes so do,
yf it should bring an ouerplus or encrea<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>se
agayne, for the verie acte of lending?
A thing so much against nature, as no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thinge
can be more repugnaunt or con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trarye.
Then yf we be reasonable men,
lett vs lyue accordynge to reason, and
haue an especiall regarde aboue all
things, to god aboue, who seeth al our
follies, and forbiddeth so expresly these
merchauntes of tyme, and these sellers
of sunne and moone, as hee forbiddethe
nothing more, willing all men to deale
freely in theire lendynge, as hee dothe
freely suffer the sunne shynynge, the
moone and starres to haue theire cour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>se,
and the worlde to continue, with sea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sonable
weather and tyme. But vsu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rers
commonly stand vpon these poin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tes,
that where charitye is not broken,
and that both parties doo feele no har<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>me,
but rather gayne, and where men
doe to others as they would haue others
<pb facs="tcp:20795:191"/>
do to them. Here cannot bee (say they) a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nye
vsurye committed at all, these res<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pectes
beinge had. I doe aunswere that
there is no charitie, where priuate gaine
is chefely sought, without any especiall
regard to the profite of my neyghbour,
whiche playnelye appereth in all them,
that lett out their money for vsury. For
weare they sure, that they shoulde not
reape any gaine at all by theire money,
they would neuer helpe the necessitie of
theire poore neyghbour, although hee
were in neuer so great extremitye. And
what charitye call you thys, when a ma<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
chefelye seeketh hys owne auayle? And
although hee take but lyttle, yet hys de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sire
is forbidden, and therfore synneful.
Agayne, bee it that both the borrower,
and the le<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>der are gayners, shall the acte
of vsurie therfore bee counted lawfull?
Nowe god forbid, for howsoeuer they
twoo doe speede, the common weale as<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>suredly
smarteth, and playne dealinge
men that vse no suche trades, shall feele
want hereby, when they haue neede to
buy anye thing for theire owne proui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sion
<pb n="174" facs="tcp:20795:191"/>
and maintenau<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ce of theire famely,
for by these meanes, both wares, and all
kynde of victualles waxe deere. And
how can it bee otherwyse? For the man
oftentymes that taketh money vpp by
interest, paiyng after twelue or fifteene
vpon the hundred, or perhaps in the hu<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
                  <g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dred,
which is more, is an occupier him
selfe, eyther a victualer, or artificer, or a
merchaunte. Nowe how can hee make
vp hys money agayn at the yeares end,
and lyue to thryue, excepte hee will sell
hys wares after twenty in or vpon the
hundred to hym that commeth to buy?
And then do you not see very playnely,
that the common weale smarteth, and
euery particuler man of what estate or
condicion soeuer he bee, is hereby gre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uouslie
wronged and pynched?</p>
               <p>Nowe, yf an ydle gentleman doe hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pen
to paye this vsurie, his lande in the
ende, by oft vsing thys trade, payeth for
all, and he and hys begge theire breade
at laste. And is not then the common
weale muche woorse, when a landed
gentleman of an auncient house per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>haps
<pb facs="tcp:20795:192"/>
is eaten vp by an vsurer, and so
hys howse decayed for euer, &amp; hys poore
tenaunts racked and hayled with incu<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
                  <g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bes
and fynes vpon the vsurers firste
entrance, and possession takynge of the
land? But forsooth, the vsurer will still
replye and saye, that he hath donne to
others, as hee would haue others doe to
hym, yf he hymself had ben in like case.
Neyther is it a small pleasure (as hee
saieth) to saue a mans land from forfey<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture,
so that he hath not offended either
god or man, because he hath fulfilled the
lawe of nature, by thys hys maner of
doynge. But god knoweth how theui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>shely
thys vsurer speakethe in thys be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>halfe.
For let him imagyne, that he him
selfe were very poore in deede, and dry<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uen
by extremitie to borrowe moneye,
for redeming of lande, or else to loose a
good lordship, for a smal portio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> of trea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sure:
woulde hee (thinke you) hauinge
suche great neede, rather paye vsurie
for the lone of moneye to redeme hys
lande, than to haue it freely lent hym?
I am well assured, hee woulde neuer
<pb n="175" facs="tcp:20795:192"/>
doe so. For who is hee, that woulde not
rather haue it geeuen hym, than lent
hym? or who woulde not rather trauai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>le
without a burthen vppon hys backe,
then with a burthen? or who would not
haue the sweete, and auoyde the sower?
or who would not receyue an hundred
poundes, to paye so muche and no more
at the yeres end, rather the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> to paye a hu<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
                  <g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>dreth
and twenty pou<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ds, for a hundreth
poundes at the twelue monethes ende,
as they commonly doe, eyther more or
lesse? Then let vs leaue these dissem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>blinge
speaches hereafter, and away on
goddes name with all gayne takynge
for tyme, because it is both hurtfull to a
common weale, vncharitable to oure
neyghboures, and also forbydden by
goddes woorde, as you haue hearde
at large, vnto whose sharpe voyce and
seuere commaundement wee oughte to
geeue good eare, and to bee alwayes o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bedient,
euen because he onely hath said
it, although there were none other mat<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ter
in it. And let not the vsurer saye,
that hee saueth the gentlemans lande,
<pb facs="tcp:20795:193"/>
for it is he, and none other, that causeth
hym to make hys la<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>d awaye almoste for
nought, who yf hee had not dealte, with
suche cutthrotes, hee had neuer been so
greate an vnthrifte, nor so wastefull in
hys expenses, nor so readye to mortga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ge
hys ryght of enheritaunce, which he
shall neuer bee hable to redeme, beinge
once faste lapte in the vsurers bandes.
But the vsurer wil not bee aunswered,
for any thing that can bee sayde against
hym, standinge still in thys opinion w<hi rend="sup">t</hi>
himselfe, that hee deserueth great than<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kes,
because he doth forbeare hys mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ney
for a yere or two, till the borrower
be hable to make better shifte, for rede<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mynge
hys lande. Unto whome I doe
aunswere still, because he is so importu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ne,
that he doth no good to y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> borrower,
but encreaseth hys harme, making him
euerye daye lesse and lesse hable to paye
hys debtes. In deede I muste saye, and
cannot deny, but that the vsurer forbea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reth
hys mony, sometymes for twoo or
three yeres, but that is to his great gay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ne,
&amp; to the borrowers bitter paine. For
<pb n="176" facs="tcp:20795:193"/>
in the ende, y<hi rend="sup">•</hi> vsurer hath done no more
than thys, that hee hath onely respited y<hi rend="sup">e</hi>
debtours certayn vndoynge, for a yere,
twoo or three, and then, bee hee well as<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sured,
hee shalbee vndone, without all
remedy. As the cat, that playeth with a
mouse a whyle, to eate her vp in y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> ende:
or like as yf a prynce shoulde saye to an
offender, he is contented to pardon him
lyfe for a monethe, but at the monethes
ende, hee will that he shall then dye as<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>suredly,
and lyue no lo<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ger. Euen so the
vnmercifull vsurer, will forbeare for a
yere or two, to cut the borrowers throte
at laste, for when these two yeares are
ones paste, hee will not fayle to doe hys
feate. A gentle dishe of fauour, god kno<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>weth,
suche as I am well assured, they
woulde bee loth to haue the like them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selues.
Repent therefore, O ye vsurers,
for gods anger against sinne, although
it bee slowe, yet it is certayne, and the
slownes oftentymes is recompensed,
with the heuy weighte and greatnes of
payne when it comes. And yf thys bee
not true whiche I doe saye, touchynge
<pb facs="tcp:20795:194"/>
gods anger agaynste tyme sellers, then
is the woorde of god, both false and vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>true,
whiche were horryble blasphemye
to saye. In whiche woorde of god, these
straighte prohibitions are enacted and
made, threatening lawes agaynste all
vsurie, that men shoulde the rather vse
charitye one to an other. But I thinke,
there is none of you all, that denyeth y<hi rend="sup">e</hi>
scriptures, or thinketh them to be false,
for so you shall denye god, and renoun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ce
vtterlie the knowledge of hym. For
by them hee ys knowne, as whiche doe
geue testimonie of hym. And surelye I
doe wonder, that the worlde shoulde so
muche choake men, that they wil so far<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>re
forgeate god, as that they contempne
hys holye lawes. For wheras in all o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
offenses men are thought, through
frayltie to breake the lawe, It seemeth,
y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> in thys matter of vsury, they stand w<hi rend="sup">c</hi>
god in it, that it is none offense at al, al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>though

and that is accompted for law<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full,

it appeareth howe needefull it is for

thynges, leaste by euill custome, theye
haue no sence in sinne, but throughe er<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ror
walow in al wickednes. It is an old

the company of the godlye, &amp; acquaint
themselues wyth the woorde of god.</p>
               <p>And in this matter, what can bee more
plaine then y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> whiche Christ saieth in S.
<hi>Luke.</hi> Lend one to an other, hopinge for
nothing ouer &amp; aboue that you did lend:
whereby not onely al contractes and v<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>suries
vpon lone, in respect of tyme are
forbidden, but the very hope also to loke
for a good turne agayne, or any thynge
<pb facs="tcp:20795:195"/>
els ouer &amp; aboue the principal is vtterly
barred and cleane taken away. Neither
is your exposicion sound master Ciuilia<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
in this behalfe, that would haue Christs
meaning to be, that men shoulde neuer
looke for their principal againe. For the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
Christ myght haue saide, geeue freelye,
whereby is included a cleare renou<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>cing
to aske backe a gyft geeuen, whereas in
lending, it was neuer so mente in com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon
reason, that a man shoulde neuer
hope to haue his owne againe. Neyther
wil men leese theire principall, excepte
some great matter moue them, as thex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>treme
pouertie of the partye, or some o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
like thynge. For althoughe goods
lent be not his that did lend them for the
tyme they were borowed, yet when the
daye of the retourne commethe, for re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>payment:
hee maye wyth good conscy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence,
aske his owne agayne. And there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
suche gloses are vayne, and to noe
purpose, and yet bee it that your exposi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cion
were true, thus then I reason. Yf
god requireth suche perfectyon in man,
<pb facs="tcp:20795:195"/>
not to aske his principal againe, when
he hath once lent it oute of hys handes:
muche more then dothe god forbyd all
manner of ouerplus in takyng for lone
more then the verye pryncipall. So that
expounde thys texte as you wyll, it ys
rather agaynst you, then wyth you, and
requyrethe in all constructyons a free
lendynge. Agayne, in <hi>Ezechiel</hi> amonge
other thynges, god sayethe there, as
you haue hearde before, hee that hathe
not lent for vsurie, and hathe not taken
anye thynge ouer and aboue, that hee
dyd lende, the same personne is a iuste
manne, hee shall lyue the lyfe sayethe
the lorde. Whereas on the contrarye
part it is said in the same chapiter.</p>
               <p>Hee that dothe lette oute hys moneye
or goods for vsurye and taketh more, or
an ouerplus, shall than man lyue say<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ethe
the lorde? Noe, hee shall not lyue,
but shall dye the deathe, and hys bloud
shall bee vppon hym, whereby it appea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rethe
that anye thynge taken ouer, is
dampnable aswell as excesse.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb facs="tcp:20795:196"/>
Yea, any thi<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>g aboue y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> pri<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>cipal is excesse,
because it is an iniury or wrong don to
an other man, by usurying his goods, &amp;
so a dedly sinne. Neyther did those tra<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>s<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lators
<hi>Leo, Iudas, Oecolampadius,</hi> &amp; others
vnderstande thys text otherwise then I
haue said, although you master Ciuilia<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>,
do not so take the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, who i<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> their other wri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tings,
did vtterly condempne al maner
of vsurye. And <hi>Luther</hi> (amongst others)
is so vehement against al vsurye what<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>soeuer,
as he was neuer more veheme<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t
against the Pope himself, &amp; al his coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terfeit
holines. And let not this imagy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nacion
hinder you, to thynke as manye
doe, that no vsurie is committed but vp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
the poore, because the scripture say<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth,
thou shalt not put out thy money to
thy poore brother for vsury. For it is al<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>so
saide in <hi>Deuteronomie.</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Exod. 22</note> Thou shalt not

al lending to any Christian be he neuer
so rich, is vtterly forbidden, except a bro<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ther

Then seing the scripture is so plaine, &amp;
<pb n="179" facs="tcp:20795:196"/>
so vnderstoode by the auncient fathers,
and by manye good men of thys tyme,
what mean you to seeke suche out leaps
of libertie, by wreasting of gods word,
to your wilfull lust &amp; sensuall pleasure?
Those other learned menne whom you
named <hi>Caluin</hi> &amp; <hi>Bucer,</hi> did somewhat en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>large
this law by a charitable exposicio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>,
for the hardnes of mens hartes void fro<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
mercy, and also for very necessitie sake,
to helpe the needye banyshed men then
dwelling amongst them, not but y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> they
woulde haue al men lend freely, as god
hath commaunded. And yet what war<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rantie
haue they for so expoundynge the
scriptures of god? But goe we on. The
lord god saieth in his x. commandemen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tes.
Thou shalt not couet thy neighbors
goods, his oxe, his asse, or any thing els
that is thy neighbours. And what other
thing I pray you, do these vsurers that
take ouerplus, but couet their neighbors
goods? for theirs it is not, because they
did lend it, and more then they did lend,
they should not haue in right, so y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> theye

yea, so horrible is this sinne, y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> amongst

Al this notw<hi rend="sup">t</hi>standing, these wise world<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ly
riche men (to cloke their sinne) and to
beare out the matter, as though their do<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ings
were lawfull) do deuise policies a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainst
god, and seeking to mitigate of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fences,
teache god what hee hathe to

                  <g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>treis,
and muche merueled by strangers

is so seuerely punished here in Engla<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>d.
But suche deuises are wicked policies &amp;
fetches directly against al godlines. For
Saint <hi>Paule</hi> saieth,<note place="margin">Paulus ad E<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>phes. 5. ad He<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>br. cap. 12</note> that no fornicatour,

<pb n="181" facs="tcp:20795:198"/>
to knowe a faithful christian from

can neuer be thought a good christi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>an.
For they y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> are of god, do those thin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ges

whiche is the fruite of loue, commau<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ded
likewise. Then what shal I saye to those
men of the world, that handle gods do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings,
so as they make no sinne to seeme
wher great &amp; horrible sinne is: seekyng
by turnes and twines of texts to cloke &amp;

Lawier, who for y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> you seme lerned,
do seeke to infecte y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> corrupte natures of

of their heads, that custome and tribute
were not due to the prince, there be that
woulde geeue eare vnto you: for all the
worlde is geeuen to harken after theire
owne profite. And badde is that counsell
<pb facs="tcp:20795:199"/>
which they will refuse to followe, when
gayne may rise thereof, without danger
or hazard of temporall lawe to punyshe
them, let gods lawe bee neuer so strong
against them. And you, master Ciuilia<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>,
although you haue saide muche and ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry
well, but especially out of the Canon
lawe: Yet I doubt of your constant abi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding,
in the very practise and true the of
this cause, that is to say, simplie to geue
your eare to gods woorde, if the matter
shoulde bee determined by your iudge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment.
For I feare me, you wyl beare w<hi rend="sup">t</hi> 
gloses, and winke at these worldly and
politike deuises, which are inuencyons
of the deuill to destroy man, &amp; to brynge
hym to euerlastynge dampnacion. And
yet god forbyd, that anye man shoulde
seeme to make hym selfe wyser then the

Lawyers of thys tyme, and wyth

Well, I wylnot stande vpon their mea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ninges,

are deedes accursed, although in appea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>raunce

               <p>For god sayeth.<note place="margin">Hoc tantum facies, Deute ro. 12.</note> Thou shalt not do that

doe thou that onely which I commaund

in his oration against y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> Jewes,
sayth thus in Englishe. Of a trueth that
whiche is done accordyng to the will of

it is altogether plesaunt &amp; acceptable be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
god. Contrarywyse, whatsoeuer is
don besides the word of god, and other<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wise
then he will haue it done, thoughe
it bee esteemed as a thynge acceptable

to deale vpon any deuocion or good in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tente
whatsoeuer more or lesse in gods
cause, then they are expreslye commaun<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>did

sent to kinge Saule, as messenger from
god, who saide in this maner. Thus sai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth
the lorde of hosts. I haue called that
to thy remembrance which Amelech did
to Israel, how they lay in waite for the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>,
in the way as they came out of Egypte.
Nowe therfore go and smyte y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> Amele<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chites,
and destroy ye all that perteineth
to them, and see you haue no compassyo<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
on them: but slaye bothe man and wo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man,
infant and suckling, oxe &amp; sheepe,
camell and asse. Now when Saule had
this commaundement, hee sette foorthe
with .200000. footemen, and .20000. men
of Iuda. But he dyd not fulfill the lords
commau<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>dement. For after he had slain
the Amelechites, hee tooke Agag theire
kinge aliue, and left of the sheepe and of
the oxen, and fat thinges, &amp; the lambes,
and all that was good and woulde not
destroy them. Whereupon the worde of
the lorde came vnto Samuell sayinge.
<pb n="183" facs="tcp:20795:200"/>
It repenteth me, y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> I haue made Saule
kinge, for he is turned from me,&amp; hathe
not perfourmed my commau<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>dementes,
so y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> he lost his kingdom by this means,
for that he of a good intente, spared the
kynge, and saued the fatte oxen &amp; shepe,
to offer sacrifice vnto y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> lorde, vnto who<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
Samuel saide. Hathe the lorde as great
pleasure in burnt sacrifices &amp; offerings,
as he hath, that thou shouldest obey hys
voice? Behold, to obey is better then of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fering,
and to geue heede, is better then
the fatte of Rambes, for to be rebellious
is as the sinne of witchcrafte, and dyso<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bedience
is wickednesse and Idolatrye.
Because therefore thou haste caste a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>waye
the woorde of the lorde, therefore
hath the lord cast awaye thee also, from
being king. Thus you se men must not
fansie to them selues a certeine manner
of dealing for respect or pity, or to mity<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gate
offences, &amp; so to despice gods com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maundement
with their deuised Imagy<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>nacions,
but rather to doe neither more
nor lesse, then that onely which god hath
commaunded to be done. And therefore
<pb facs="tcp:20795:201"/>
in your iudgementes and sentences of
lawe, I pray you master Ciuilian, haue
god and his worde alwayes before your
eies, that you lawyers, maie say and do
the trueth according to his worde.</p>
               <p>And you master merchant vnto whom
god hath le<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t great treasure of this world
(for I tell you, you are but his steward)
call to god that he will lende you grace
in the middest of your welth to learne &amp;
knowe him aright: let not wealth choke
your iudgement and cloye your vnder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>standing.
Beware how you cloke with
god, do not vnder colour of bargayne &amp;
sale, practise vsury as most me<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> do. Ther
be plaine waies for men to take, whiche
are and hath ben euer allowed. And this
I say, he that liueth in his vocacion tru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lye
and iustlye, is an honest man. That
Grocer who sellethe holsome wares w<hi rend="sup">e</hi>
good conscience, is to bee well esteemed.
The Draper that dealeth lawfullye, de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>serueth
credite. The true Taylor, is an
honest man in his callinge. The Golde<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>smith,
the Mercer, and the Haberdasher
are all to be well liked, &amp; so all others of
any occupacio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> liue iustly i<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> their trade.
<pb n="184" facs="tcp:20795:201"/>
A mercha<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t of whatsoeuer callyng he is,
is to be acco<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>pted for honest, if he lyue w<hi rend="sup">t</hi> 
good fame &amp; name, by his lawful trafik,
or occupacion. But I pray you, of what
occupacion is goodman vsurer, or who
would gladly be called one of y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> vsurers

occupied, &amp; euery one to folow
his lawful vocacion, rather the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> to trade
by this lewde craft or kinde of liuynge.
Some lerned fathers, yea, &amp; some great

But I am not altogether of y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> minde, es<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pecially

their allowed trades, as I haue said, are
honest, iust, vpright, &amp; worshipful, &amp; not
inferiors to other men of anye callinge.
True it is, were are al sinners more and

neede to call to god for mercy.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb facs="tcp:20795:202"/>
And assured we are that god beynge the
searcher of our hartes, wyll take an ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>compte
of al our doings. Wee haue but
a time and a course to runne, let vs take
that right way for our race, whiche god
hath made playn and open for vs by his

and readie alwaies to geue some porcy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
of that bountifulnes, which god day<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
and infinitely of his free mercy pou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reth
vpon vs. And as reasonable men
let vs consider, that ryghteousnes esta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>blisheth
kingdomes, and charitable dea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lings
maynteineth states: whereas v<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>surye
the daughter of couetousnes, the

and assured waye, that dangerously ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uenture
the seas, and so the Quene shal
lose her gayn and right of enheritance,
and the state shalbe vndon. The plough
man will no more turne vp the ground
for vncertayne gayne, when hee maye
make an assured profite of hys money,
that lieth by hym. The artificer wil leue
hys woorkynge. The clothier will cease
hys makynge of clothes, because these
trades are paynefull and chargeable:
yea all men will geue themselues who<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lie
to lyue an idle life by there money, if
they haue any. And although al can not
haue mony, yet yf al those y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> haue mony
will lyue by y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> lone thereof, all will be
marred in y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> end. And amongst others,
the gentelman will no more professe
armes nor chiualrye, to aduaunce hys
welfare, but selling hys landes will ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ue
double gayne by hys moneye, and so
geeue ouer howsekepinge all together,
takynge a chamber in London or else

countrie, as wee see they doe now com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monlye,
the more is the pitie, and the

greater is theire shame, yea the noble
man will no more defend the widowe &amp;
fatherles, nor yet do iudgement and iu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stice,
but lyue by hys filthye gayne, and
lose therby hys dignity and estimacion,

great dearthe will ensue of all thinges,
as you see, and misery will fall vpon vs
vniuersally, for y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> fewe men will woor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ke,

And what good I pray you will
mony doe then, when we haue neyther
meat to eate, nor clothe wherwith to co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uer

not so much as the butcher, the baker, or

whatsoeuer, hauing neuer so lytell

<pb n="186" facs="tcp:20795:203"/>
as manye already are, yf thys

lett, why they shoulde not all bee vsu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rers,
aswell as others, yf the same maye

a surer and easyer, and a more gayne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full
trade cannot bee vppon earth, then
to gett mony, with the lone of monye
onely. And who doth not loue ease and
gaine, yf they may be had both together?
So that I say, yf thys geere take place v<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niuersallie,

at the last, with all theire trauaill,

<pb facs="tcp:20795:204"/>
they laboure for the vse of others, that
doe nothing themselues but loyter, and
with ease make mony of mony. An alcu<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>mye
founde out by the deuill, to distroy
all trade in the worlde when none haue
anye thinge but themselues. But theire
rewarde in the ende shalbe death euer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lasting,
excepte they doe amende. It is
written in <hi>Solinus, de mirabilibus mundi,</hi>
that in the islande Sardinia, there is a
well, whereof yf a trewe man doe drin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ke,
hys eye syght straight way waxethe
cleare, but yf a false harlot doe but supp
of it, hee waxeth starke blynde oute of
hande, althoughe hee dyd see neuer so
well before. Nowe happye were Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lande,
yf all the conduites in London
dyd runne with suche water. And yet
what dyd I saye, I woulde thinke
London then, and England also would
bee moste vnhappy. For yf it were so,
wee shoulde haue so manye blynde
men in the Citye and countrye, that
there woulde scante bee founde guydes
sufficient to leade them in the streates,
<pb n="187" facs="tcp:20795:204" rendition="simple:additions"/>
and hyghe wayes, when theye shoulde
seeke to goe abroade. The morall of
thys saiynge is, that good men haue
the grace of god, and see hym in hys
glorie, wheras euill men are starke
staring blynde, through their folye and
wickednes. And of thys sorte are there
manye companies blynde in thys land,
as the clergye with simonye, merchaun<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>tes
with vsurye, iudges with bryberye,
great men with extorcion, and the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon
sorte with micherie. God bee mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cifull
vnto vs, and sende vs of hys gra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ce.
But sayeth the couetous man, seing
you goe harde to worke with vs, and
wyll not suffer vs to make anye gay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ne
at all of oure moneye, but restray<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ne
vs vtterlye from aduansynge oure
wellfare, wee will not lende at all
hereafter, because wee will not of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fende.
Euell sayde of you, say I, when
god commaundethe the contrarye, and
by youre woordes you bewraye what
you are, men graceles no doubte, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>oute
affection or charytye, and people
<pb facs="tcp:20795:205"/>
voyde of all loue. Sainct <hi>Paule</hi> sayeth,
vnthankefull, harde harted and vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mercifull,
and so the children of perdi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cion.
Yf you woulde haue sayde, you
woulde not lend to all them that would
borowe of you, I wold haue holden wel
with that sayinge. For I promise you,
it is an offence to lende to some, and a
maintenaunce of their follie. And ther<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore,
they doe wel, that are not ouer ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stie,
or rather ouer gredy to lende with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out
great cause and good consideracion
had before. For indeede men should ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
lende to helpe others, then seeke
gredelye to enriche themselues, because
it is properlie the nature of lendinge,
(beynge a certeine kynde of almese) to
helpe the necessity of oure neighbours,
with parte of oure plentye, as occasion
doth serue. Whereas lending for gay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ne
without good cause had of an others
neede: maketh wanton princes to seeke
needelesse warre, noble men riotous to
spende without reason, yong gentleme<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
vnthriftie to bring all to naughte, after
<pb n="188" facs="tcp:20795:205"/>
they are newly come to theire landes, &amp;
so to take the verye hyghe waye to vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>doe
themselues for euer: as euery day if
doth appeare, not onelye in gentelmen,
but in some greate states and Lordes of
thys lande, the more is the pitye. And
suerly, he is farre from thrifte, whatsoe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uer
hee bee, that boroweth vpon vsurie
without great cause, and rather woulde
hee seme to bee that which he is not, tha<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
to bee in deede and in outwarde shewe,
that whiche hee is. And no doubt, wan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tonnes
broughte in thys follye at the
firste, that men with theire maskynge
maners and greate braueries, shoulde
seme for a time to be ioly felowes, wher
as at length they discouer themselfes, &amp;
are become woorse than naughte. And
therfore they doe euill, that make a cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tayne
gayne of lending, to the vndoing
of others, wheras lendinge shoulde bee
for charitie sake, and not to mainteyne
the outragiouse excesse and foolishe ry<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ot
of manye adeuise vsed more here in
England, than in any place els, that I
knowe in Christendome. For yf mony
<pb facs="tcp:20795:206"/>
might not so sone bee had of those coue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tous
vsurers moste men woulde lyue
within theire boundes, and leaue theire
wanton apparell, theire vnnecessarye
feastynge, theire fond gamnynge, and
theire lewde hazarding of great wealth
and reuenues without all wytte, vpon
a mayne chaunce at dyce, or vpon a car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>de
or twoo at primero, and other vayne
diuelishe games. For so these vnthriftes
maye haue mony to serue theire lustes,
&amp; to hazarde their chaunce, they care not
what to paye. And thus they being ouer
laden with a mayne losse, and most cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tayne
debte to the vsurer before hande,
doe sett vppon blynd fortune afterwar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>des
all that they haue, and are vndoone
before they are a ware, onely by the v<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>surers
dealinges, although they bee no
great losers, neyther at dyce, nor yet at
cardes. But you will saye, and proue it
to, that many haue bene made with pai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ynge
vsurie, gettinge great welth into
theire handes, and at the leaste haue sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ued
themselues from imprisonement, &amp;
vtter vndoynge. Unto thys I do aun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sweare,
<pb n="189" facs="tcp:20795:206"/>
as hee that came into a churche,
&amp; sawe it full of Images made of waxe,
asked the cause of suche a sighte. Unto
whom one answered, that these people,
whome these waxen images did repre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sente,
were saued from drowninge, by
calling vpon our ladie: Nay then (quod
hee againe) wher be the images of those
I pray you, that called vppon our ladie,
and were drowned notwithstandinge
And so saye I, yf some one man haue
gott good by vsurie, and hath been ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>de
thereby, how many thousandes haue
had mischiefe, &amp; been vtterlie vndon by
vsurie. Wel, well, saye you stil, &amp; replie
as you please, yf the world go so w<hi rend="sup">t</hi> vs y<hi rend="sup">t</hi>
le<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ding for gayne muste clerelye bee re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>strayned,
and that vpon paine of death,
as we wolde haue it: farewell then all
hope to borrowe any moneye herafter.
Unto thys I aunswere, and I thinke
cleane contrarie, especially if men will
conforme themselues to the lawe of na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture,
and lyue as they ought to doe vp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rightelie
in theire vocation, and remem<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ber
there is a god. For then plentie will
<pb facs="tcp:20795:207"/>
folowe, and good cheape will bee of all
thyngs, whe<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> euery man lyueth vprigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>telye
in his callinge &amp; profession as god
hathe appoynted, and forsake these vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lawfull
shyftes, and so charitye wyll a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bounde,
and no man can wante, that
being honeste hath any neede, say you
what you wil. Mary vnthriftes, and sus<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>pected
men, maye perhaps fayle by these
meanes, and be dryuen to trust to their
own, when none will lende vnto them.
And suerlye I woulde wyshe that len<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding
were chefely to the needy &amp; thryf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie
parson that wil trulie gett his liuing
with the sweate of hys browes, &amp; paye
that agayne faithfullye, which hee hath
ones borrowed. But to say you wil not
lend to any body at al, because you can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not
bee suffered to make gayne of your
money, and so to do as muche as in you
lieth to destroye occupiyng: that I saie,
is an vnmerciful saiynge, and directlye
against god. And yet say what you wil,
yf the lawes of god in this behalfe were
straightelye executed againste vsurie,
there woulde bee for all thys lending
<pb n="190" facs="tcp:20795:207"/>
ynoughe, suche lendinge I meane as
is needefull, and in charitye oughte to
bee vsed. Yea, I will saye more, rather
then men wil suffer theire wares to lye
deade by them, and theire goodes not to
bring foorthe anye encrease at all: they
will hazarde theire wealth into cheap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mens
handes, and yong occupiers, and
bee contented, aswell to aduenture the
losse or perill of their ware, as to assure
themselues of currante gayne, and cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tayne
profite. And so doynge they maye
boldlie put foorth theire substaunce for
others to occupie, vpon such charitable
dealing. And althoughe fewe perhaps
will trade in thys sorte, that is aswell
to hazarde losse, as to assure themselfes
of gayne: yet the world wilbee the bet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter,
wares will waxe more cheape, dea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>linges
wilbee more vpright, and fewer
men will breake, when suche christian
charitie is commonly vsed, both in mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derate
takynge of gayne, vpon charita<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble
forbearing for a tyme, till men may
make mony, and frendly bearing with
losses, when any suche doe happen. And
<pb facs="tcp:20795:208"/>
amo<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>gst honest and godly men, I know
there will neuer bee wante of charitie.
And happy were England, yf all men
were honest, for then lawes wer neede<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lesse,
and suche euill as thys had, neuer
neede to bee feared: as for euill men, it
were good to ridde the world of them, if
it were possible, and to deuise by lawes
that none should liue, muche lesse come
to wealth by such vnlawfull wayes, for
that they onely and none others, are the
cause of all dearthe and wante in thys
worlde. Thus when euery man lyued
vpryghtely within hys boundes and cal<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ling,
vsing suche trade as hee oughte to
doe, plentie woulde soone appeare in all
places, and god would blesse the worlde
also with encrease muche. And doe not
thinke that you are to be excused, when
you doe lend to the riche, where it may
seme you haue not oppressed, and so not
deale with the poore, for feare he should
bee oppressed, for I tell you, you shoulde
lende to all that haue neede, of what es<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tate
condicion or liuing soeuer they be,
poore or ryche. And fonde is thys ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gumente
<pb n="161" facs="tcp:20795:208"/>
that you haue often vsed, of
which many do take fast holde. It is not
lawfull to take vsurie of the poore, ther<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
a man may take vsury of the riche,
for by the like reason one may thys ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gue:
It is not lawfull to vexe a poore
man by lawe, therefore it is lawfull to
vexe or to trouble a riche man by lawe.
None, eyther riche or poore, yonge or
olde, lowe or bye, should be troubled or
vexed at all, or by anye maner of mea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nes.
Regarde alwayes must bee had to
the common weale, that no harme doe
come thereunto, by anye vnlawful dea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lynges,
and not whether thys man, or
that man bee wronged or no. For so it
may fall out that your neyghboure vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to
whome you haue lent mony for gay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ne,
fealeth no harme thereby, and yet
assure your selfe, the co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>mo<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> weale smar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teth
by suche vnlawfull dealinges, as I
haue often heretofore sayde. And there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
the Ciuilians sayeth, <hi>Interest reipub.
vt quisque resua rectè hoc est, honestè &amp; le<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gitimè vtatur.</hi> It is for the behoue of the
common weale, that euerye man do vse
<pb facs="tcp:20795:209"/>
hys own thynges rightfully, that is (as
I take it) honestely and lawfullye. And
thys is that <hi>aequum &amp; bonum,</hi> that eauen
hode, and ryghte balance dealinge, so
much commended by all lawes, thys is,
I saye, that christian charitie, which see<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>keth
nothing of her own, but those thin<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ges
that are of <hi>Iesus Christ.</hi> And is it so
straunge a thinge for men to borrowe
freelie in thys worlde? I am not verie
olde, and yet I haue knowne manye in
my dayes, that haue borrowed freely
great masses of moneye of diuerse men,
and some agayne that haue borrowed
small summes freely of a great sorte, for
no peny vsurie at all? Good men can no
more bee without charitie, than fyer ca<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
bee without heate. And therefore, let vs
pray, that good men chefely may enioy
the frutes of the earthe, yea lett vs all
that bee badde, consider thys one thinge
w<hi rend="sup">e</hi> our selues, that nought we brought
with vs into thys worlde, and noughte

               <p>I haue longe studyed the Ro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maine

is somewhat encreased by
them. But woulde god I had more ear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nestly
studied the verye texte of the olde

I should the rather haue gathered most
true knowledge: but also I should haue
ben more mortified, by a great deale the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
I am. It is vnspeakable, what good they
do reape, to their soules health, that doe
daylye and howerly, meditate the very
letter and text of the scriptures.</p>
               <p>And I thanke you most hartelye master
Preacher, for your good zeale and ear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nest
care, to sifte out the truethe of thys
matter, whiche I doe thynke, &amp; am ful<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
perswaded, that you haue founde out
<pb n="194" facs="tcp:20795:211"/>
according to gods most holy will. And
I praye god moste hartely, that I maye
be a true follower, of all that you haue
sayd, and neuer consent in hart to lend
moneye for gayne, nor yet to allowe of
them that are knowen vsurers.</p>
               <p>I do knowe certeinly, that to lend free<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
is a naturall contracte commaunded
by god, and allowed by man, and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
to be done and vsed of all men: but
to lende for gayne is a suspected kind of
dealynge, and therefore to bee blamed
whatsoeuer colour I doe sette vppon it.
And the wise man sayeth, <hi>Quae dubitas
ne feceris,</hi> neuer doe that, whereof thou
doest stand in doubt. And therefore by y<hi rend="sup">e</hi>
leaue of god, I wyll neuer deale other<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wise

as gods word &amp; my conscie<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ce shal di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rect

to borowe of mee, yf I be able to
lende, and maye forbeare my money or
goods without any my great hi<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>dera<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ce.
The Ciuill lawe, is a wise studie, &amp; full
<pb facs="tcp:20795:212"/>
of pollicie, whiche I haue euer wel liked
because of the natural &amp; good reaso<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>s y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> it
carieth in shew. But I must say nowe,
that the wisedome of man, is folishnesse
before god, and vayn are all those spea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ches,
that are vsed to blau<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ch gods grou<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>

rules, beinge the onelye vndoubted
trueths chiefly to bee followed of al god<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lye
&amp; Christian people. And for my part
I am gladde that god hath touched mee
thus muche to renounce mans reason,
and to followe his most holy will, which
I will hereafter embrace, by his especy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>all
fauour and mercye, and preferre the
truethe of hys woorde, before all other
learninge whatsoeuer, and confesse in
hart, that al lending of money or wares
for any gayne, whatsoeuer in respecte of

deede before god and man.</p>

               <p>It is euill striuinge againste a
knowen trueth. And wo be to him that
doth anye thing against hys conscience.
I haue hearde muche, and somewhat I
knowe, and althoughe naturall reason
and mans policie, haue caryed me oute
<pb n="195" facs="tcp:20795:212"/>
of the waye, yet I thanke god my con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>scyence
dyd neuer accuse mee. For I
thoughte assuredlye, that whatsoeuer I
did in this behalfe, so that charitie hadde
been kept, and no harme in appearance
committed, nor offence notoriously kno<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>wen:
that al then had been well. But I
doe see it is cleane contrary, and I con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fesse
my selfe to haue erred, for whyche
I am sorie. And nowe I perceiue y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> man
must not seke to seeme wyser then god,
nor yet deuise doinges for his owne ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cuse,
accordynge as hys fonde brayne
might imagyne. For I doe nowe plain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lie
finde, that euen the verye sufferance
of vsurie, although it were for a meane
rate: is not only forbidde<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> by god, which
is chiefely to be noted, but also hurtfull
to a state, and cause of muche dearthe &amp;
scarcitie, whiche is pitifull to bee seene.
Therefore I doe wishe, that wee might
all lyue as god hathe commaunded vs,
and not fansie vnto oure selues, suche a
kinde of dealynge and lyuinge as god &amp;
nature haue alwaies forbydden. Oure
lawe is plain inough against this sinne,
<pb facs="tcp:20795:213"/>
yf we were as good execucioners therof
as the lawe geueth aucthority. But our
countreye disposicion is rather to make
laws, then to keepe laws, yea rather the
lawe is vsed to enriche lawiers, then to
execute the iustice of lawe.</p>
               <p>Holy king Edward as they call him, he
y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> was before Willia<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> Co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>queror, among
other his good lawes, did in the .37. law
that hee made vtterlye forbyd vsurers,
and woulde not that anye suche shoulde
tarrie wythin this Realme. And if anye
weare conuycted to haue exacted vsu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rye,
he shoulde loose all hys goods, and
after that be estemed as an outlaw. The
said king Edward did further say, y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> hee
did here it reported in y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> court of Fra<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ce,
when he was ther, y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> vsury was thought
to bee the roote of all other sinne &amp; mys<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chiefe
whatsoeuer. After this, in Henry
the secondes time, I do remember what
<hi>Glanuill</hi> chiefe.<note place="margin">Glanuil. lib. 7 Cap. 16.</note> Justyce of Englande in
those dayes wrytethe, whiche I thynke
not amisse to make knowen for oure a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mendement.
In the seuenth booke wher
he speaketh of inheritances, of last wils
<pb n="196" facs="tcp:20795:213"/>
and testamentes, hee sayeth amongst o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
things, in the sixteeneth chapiter of
that booke, that all the goods of an vsu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rer,
whether he dye makyng a wyll, or
not making a wil, are proper to y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> king.
And yet no man so longe as hee lyuethe
was euer wonte to bee appealed or con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uicted
of vsurie. But amongst other en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quiries
for the kinge, it is vsed to be en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quired
vpon, and proued by twelue law
full men that dwell nyghe hym, vpon
their othes, that a certeine man died an
vsurer, whyche thynge being proued in
open courte, al the moueable goods and
chatelles that weare the vsurers owne,
at the tyme of hys decease, shall be sea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed
for our soueraigne lorde the king, in
whose handes soeuer the sayde goods or
chatelles shall be founde, and the heire
of the same vsurer shal be dysherited for
y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> self same cause, according to the law of
the Realme, &amp; the land shall returne to
the lord or lords agayn, from whence
it came. Al which notw<hi rend="sup">t</hi>sta<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ding, it is yet
thus to be vnderstoode, yf any ma<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> hath
ben an vsurer in his life time, and ther<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of
<pb facs="tcp:20795:214"/>
was openly and notoryouslye fames
so to bee: and after repented hym selfe
before his deathe, and did penance ther<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore,
whiche can not be without restitu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cion,
his goods shall not be within com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>passe
of the lawe agaynste vsurers. And
therfore it must be wel knowen by good
and sufficient tryal, that one dyed as an
vsurer, to make the lawe determine vpo<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
him, as against an vsurer, &amp; to dispose of
his goods, as vpo<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> goods of an vsurer.
Thus far <hi>Glanduil</hi> in y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> place, who in his
x. booke &amp; third chapiter, sheweth plain<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ly
what vsurie is, and thus hee sayeth.
Thinges are due vpon lendinge, when
anye man dothe trust an other, in those
thynges that doe consist vpon number,
weight, and measure. Therfore when a
man hath lent anye suche thinge, if hee
that hath so lent it, doth take any thyng
ouer and aboue his lone, he committeth
vsurie in so doing. And if he depart this
world so offending, he shalbe condemp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned
as an vsurer, by the lawe of y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> land,
as before more at large hathe ben decla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red.
According vnto this law, <hi>Mathewe

to bee kepte at Douer, and in other pla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces,
wher it best pleased his grace, as in

so y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> vsurie by that means was
vtterlye banyshed from amonge y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon
people. But how the kings exchan<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>gers
vsed the matter, I know not. This
I knowe well, the fewer that vse thex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chaunge
in manner as it is nowe vsed
amongst merchauntes, the better it is
<pb n="198" facs="tcp:20795:215"/>
for the state &amp; commo<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> profit of this la<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>d.
But I for greedy desire of profite, haue
forgot all these thinges, and seeing how
lothe men are to lende, thought it better
euen against gods law &amp; our lawe also,
according to y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>mon maxime, to suffer
rather a mischief, then an inconuenie<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ce.
But I see now that suche proposicyons
are wicked and dampnable,<note place="margin">Roman. 3.</note> for no euill
must be eyther donne, or suffered to bee
done, that good maye come thereof, as
you master Preacher haue very godly
saide vnto vs, out of gods moste holye
worde. I do reade that in the .47. yeare of
kynge Henrye the thirde, a ryot was
commytted against the Jewes, and fiue
hundred of the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> slain, &amp; thoccasion of this
ryot was, for that one Jew would haue
forced a Christyan man to haue geeuen
vnto him more then twoo pence for the
vsurye of twenty shillings by y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> weke.
For y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> Jewes had licence from the king
to take two pence in the pounde, for the
weekes lendynge, which is forty pound
and more by the yere vpon the hundred,
a deuelishe vsury no doubt, and worthy
<pb facs="tcp:20795:216"/>
of all death, wythoute al peraduenture.
And great pitie that any prince shoulde
euer yelde to suffer anye suche spoyle or
theft amongst good subiectes. These Ie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wes
are gone. Would god the Christy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans
remayninge, and our country men
at this time dyd not vse theire fashyons.
I for my parte wilbe from hencefoorthe
a moste deadly enemy againste all vsu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rers,
and willingly I will not eate nor
yet drink with any of them. And I pray
you master Merchant, if heretofore you
haue taken any enboldening to commit
vsurie through any qualification that I
haue vsed, contrary to law which I pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fesse,
and against my conscience: do you
from henceforth amende it, and amende
your selfe by my warnynge, and beare
not your selfe vpon mee, nor yet vppon
the lawe that I professe. For both I wil
discharge my selfe before god, and thys
good companye of anye suche mainete<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>naunce
and declare vnto you, that not
onelye the lawe whiche I professe, is a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gaynste
it, but also my conscyence con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dempneth
me of suche tolleratinge. For
<pb n="199" facs="tcp:20795:216"/>
the whiche I am right hartely sorie, and
doe nowe constantly affirme that al le<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ding
for gaine in respect of time, is both
against gods lawe, and oure lawe, and
is a mischiefe most hurtfull to all states,
and the principall cause of all want and
scarcitie in any common weale, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>soeuer
it hathe once gotte a footing and
is eyther allowed or suffered. And for
your good cheare, I thanke you moste
hartely. And nowe will I saye, thys is
the best dinner that euer I came at in al
my life. And I pray god it may be so vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to

you I am nowe become through y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> same
(as I trust) a new man praysed be god,
and you therefore. And nowe I doe as<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>muche
abhorre to lend money for gaine
hereafter, as I doe abhorre to steale by
the hyghe waye, or to murder any man
violentlye for his goods, which god for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>byd
<pb n="200" facs="tcp:20795:217"/>
that euer I shoulde thinke or minde
to doe. And you master Lawyers bothe
of you, haue wel put me in remembra<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ce
that my goods are not myne to bestow,
after my deth, if I should die an vsurer.
Lorde god, yf the prynce woulde take
aduauntage of all suche as haue offen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded
in this behalfe<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> manie should begge,
that howe are braue. And yet marke
gods iudgement. You shall hardlye see
an vsurers issue prosper wel, but eyther
the partye comes to an euyll ende, or
the goods are lewdlye wasted awaye.
Mercye, mercye, therefore Lorde god,
and I truste assuredlye that vpon myne
vnfeyned repentaunce, god wyll bee
mercifull vnto mee. Restitucyon I had
neede to make, and I wyll so doe by
gods grace, as I can. Euill is that pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nye
gotten, whiche bringeth dampnati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on,
and vnhappie is he, that for greedie
desire of this world, doth leese the ioyes
of heauen. It had been my part, hauing
had such wealth, to haue vysited the pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sons,
where men lie long for smal debt,
and haue beene oppressed wyth vsurye,
<pb facs="tcp:20795:218"/>
to their vtter vndoing: to haue ayded y<hi rend="sup">e</hi>
poore housholders, the fatherlesse chyl<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren
and the widowes. But hereafter I
will vysite Christ more often in hys af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flicted
me<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>bers, and lend freely by gods
grace, to suche and so many, as I shalbe
able and know to be honest godly men,
and relieue them chieflye, and make also
restytucyon vnto them whom I haue
most oppressed, and get my goods here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>after
by lawfull meanes. Wee all feare
the plague merueilously here in Londo<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>,
and desire god that the Cytye maye bee
cleared of it, but what a blesse weare it,
to the City, and realme also (as I reme<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
                  <g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber
you said before master Preacher) if
in one yeare god would take al vsurers
away, and cleare this lande of such vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mercyfull
men. I for my part knowyng
that I doe knowe, rather then I wyll
hereafter make gayne of my goods or
moneye, for the verye lone thereof, in
respecte of time, I wyll suffer a thousa<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>d
deathes in this worlde, to saue my soule
the rather in the worlde to come. Yea,
none of myne shal euer haue my fauor,
<pb n="201" facs="tcp:20795:218"/>
that will take that waye, for I knowe
thys lyfe is but a passage, and stewar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>des
wee are all, (as you haue well sayd
master preacher), to make an accompte
of our former lyues, and to shewe how
faithfully wee haue bestowed those ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lentes,
which god of hys goodnes hath
vouchsafed to bestowe upon vs. For yf
wee haue bene euill officers, woe is our
hyer, wheras otherwise hauing faith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fullie
discharged our duties, god is iust,
and will rewarde the faithfull for euer,
according to hys promise, throughe the
merites of Jesus Christ, who bee pray<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed
therefore.</p>

of Israel, and holy bee hys name, bothe
nowe and always hereafter. I am hart<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lye
glad before god, that I haue lyued
vntill thys daye, to see suche a conuer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sion
of you my deere brethren, and grea<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ter
ioye I knowe ther wilbe in heauen,
for the recouering of so fewe lost shee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pe,

praye god that all others maye take ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ample
of you, and vpon gods good
<pb facs="tcp:20795:219"/>
warnyng folowe those thinges in theire
conuersacion of life, that you haue now
professed to doe during your lyues. And
thys I saye, hee that lyueth to dye well,
shall dye to lyue better. Nowe, god for

            <head>¶A conclusion to the lo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uing
Reader.</head>
            <p>GEntle reader, and deere countrie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man,
I haue in some parte layde
open (as maye appeare) the doinges &amp;
dealinges of thys worlde. And muche
speache hath passed diuerselye betwixte
parties, &amp; great heate hath ben vttered,
aswell in defense of cloked euill, as in
rebuke of knowne sinne, the most &amp; the
worst, lykynge that always best, which
is cheefely for theire purpose, bee it ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uer
so bad. At the last, an agreement is
made (as you see) and all reconciled to
god, as people much ashamed of sinne,
and men most sorie for their by past fo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lies.
The merchaunt, as it seemeth, will
no more deale vnlawfully, but vse hys
trade in good order, and in suche sorte,
as to good conscience and gods lawe is
agreable. The lawiers, aswell Ciuilian
as temporall, shewe themselues morti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fied
persones, and will neuer geeue oc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>casion
(so muche as in them lyethe) for
any to offende by their example. And all
<pb facs="tcp:20795:220"/>
thys goodnes commeth through y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> prea<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>chers
godly and zelouse dealing. And is
all thys trewe (sayth one) that wee shall
haue suche a worlde hereafter, as there
wilbee neyther euill lawier, nor yet euil
merchaunte? For aunswere I saye, god
knoweth onely, what wilbe hereafter.
I haue made but onely a rehersall of an
assemblie, whiche I will not sweare to
bee trewe neyther, for all the goodes in
Englande, and yet I wishe the same
had been trewe, especially for the latter
parte of theire agreement, let their for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer
lifes bee, as they will be, whiche I
thinke are woorse than I haue sayde.
For neither tongue can vtter, nor pen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ne
expresse at ful, the euii of this world.
And yet I haue said so much euery way,
as I was hable to saye, &amp; as my leasure
serued. And an easie matter it is, to tell
a tale, or to make a tale of any ma<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, or of
any matter eyther to or fro: but the har<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>dest
piece of worke of al is this, for men
to bee, as they woulde seeme to bee. For
who woulde not seeme very honeste in
outwarde apparaunce, and yet who is
<pb facs="tcp:20795:220"/>
perfectly honest in very deede? I haue
concluded of these men, as I woulde
it were, or had ben at the first, and so al
thyngs after much talke are lapped vp
as you see, with a ioyful ende, but whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
it will fall oute so or no hereafter,
god knoweth, and not I. Therefore
I shal tell you a shorte mery tale, some<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>what
to the purpose of thys last speach &amp;
compounded agreement.</p>
            <p>About xvi. yeares past, at my beeinge
in Rome (where I was forth comming
afterwards, agaynst my will god kno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>weth)
ther was warre betwixt the pope
<hi>Paulus quartus,</hi> &amp; the Emperour <hi>Charles,</hi>
for the kyngdome of Naples, the pope
himselfe beynge a noble man by byrthe,
of the house of Carraffa in Naples, and
the chiefe aucthor and beginner of this
warre, as one that hated the emperour
most deadly, for putting to death an vn<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>cle
of the sayde popes, vpon the rebellio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
made by the prince of Salerne &amp; others,
to restore the Napolitanes to their aun<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>cient
liberties, &amp; free gouernement of
that kyngdome. In this tyme of warre,
<pb facs="tcp:20795:221"/>
duke of Alua being not farre of, with a
mayne power, against the pope, &amp; fren<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>che
kynge, who tooke hys parte, duke
Guyse being general then for the fren<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>che
armie, the holy father did sett forth
in prynte, a certayne prayer for peace,
and commaunded that all prestes w<hi rend="sup">t</hi>in
their paroches, should cal the people to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether,
&amp; exhorte them to pray for peace.
Amongst whom, one pryest of a certay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ne
paroche there, seynge the people as<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sembled,
began to declare vnto them
the holy fathers will, whiche was, that
they should all praye together for a spe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>die
peace. And when they were thus de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>noutelie
gathered together, &amp; warned to
praye, the priest saide thus, after many
speaches past before. Good brethre<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, you
see I muste doe as I am commaunded,
I can not doe otherwise, &amp; therfore I ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>horte
you eftsones, &amp; I pray you hartely
praye for peace. But thys I will saye
vnto you before hande, yf you haue any
peace at all, w<hi rend="sup">t</hi> all your prayers, I will
geeue my head. For howe can it bee o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>therwise,
whan he y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> is the aucthor, &amp; the
<pb facs="tcp:20795:221"/>
onely deuiser of thys warre, doth requi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>re
you to praye for peace, who myght ha<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ue
it, when hee list, yf he would be quiet
hymselfe: But I knowe hee will not, &amp;
therefore your prayers wilbe in vayne,
&amp; yet pray sirs for maner sake. A straun<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ge
speache of a parishe pryest in Rome,
who was well punished for hys labour,
bee you well assured.</p>
            <p>And now, what yf I sayde, that these
merchaunts and lawyers, notwithstan<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ding
their solempne vowes, will not be
so good, as they seeme to haue made pro<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>myse
vpon this last agrement? I thinke
yf I layd a good round wager of mony
vpo<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> this matter (for other things I will
not hazarde) there be thousands in Eng<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>land,
that woulde bee my halfe. Men be
worldely, selfe louers, geuen for y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> most
parte to euil, full of hypocrisie &amp; dissimu<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>lation,
&amp; very loth to do good, whe<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> they
see no profite folowe, and vnwyllynge
to be such, as they are bounde and com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maunded
to bee. An easie matter it is, to
renounce synne by wordes or outward
promise, and betwixt doyng &amp; saiynge,
<pb facs="tcp:20795:222"/>
there is greate oddes. The worlde is
full of sweete entisyng baytes, and
man is made of fleshe, subiect euer to all
temptacion of thys worlde. And yet
shal not I wishe and praye that al thin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ges
may bee wel, although it bee almost
impossible, to haue perfection and soun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>denes
of lyfe in all men, and amongest
all states? God forbidde else, and well I
knowe, that the prayer of good men,
is of great force before god. Therfore I
desire all the good true seruauntes of
god, to ioyne in prayer with me, that al
folke may amende theire lifes in euery
vocation, and that the kingdome of god
maye come hastelye amongst vs, &amp; hys
glorye appeare for the speedye succour
of his chosen people, and perfite ending
of all thynges, with most ioyful trium<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phe:
which god graunte, for the merites
of Christ hys sonne, our onely media<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tor
and sauiour. Amen.</p>
