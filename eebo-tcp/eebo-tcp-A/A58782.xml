         <editorialDecl>
            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            <p>THis little Piece is dedicated to you by a true Lover of
your Souls, being an Abstract with Remarks, of an
excellent Sermon formerly preached by your now Reverend
Doctor, as a Test of whose Veracity this is presented to you.
And as it is hoped you will be careful to examine the Doc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trines
of your Preachers by the Word of God, the holy Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures,
which is the prime and chief Rule to try the Doctrines
of Men by (like the noble <hi>Bereans,</hi> who search'd the Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures
whether those things were so; <hi>i. e.</hi> Whether the Doc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trines
of the Apostles did agree with that Rule and Standard,)
so likewise that you will consult as a subordinate Rule, the
Books and Writings of your said Reverend Doctor (to whose
Conduct you have resign'd your Souls) which he made and
wrote before these Backsliding and Apostate Times; wherein
Men have learn'd to prevaricate, and prefer their Interest to
their Duty, (your Spiritual Guides themselves having stum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bled
and fallen,) that you may be the better able to judg
whether he gives you the true Interpretation of the holy
Text, according to the Analogy of Gospel Faith and Man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ners,
or preaches <gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap>, <hi>another Gospel,</hi> which will
Anathematize an Apostle or an Angel, it being your Duty to
hold fast the Form of sound Words, and to be Followers of
Men as far as they are of Christ.</p>
            <p>You'll pardon this Address, coming from one who seeks not
yours but you; and who is,</p>

that he could meet with, of Dr. <hi>Scot</hi>'s excellent and famous Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon

that out of an honest and charitable Design for the publick Good,
to make this <hi>Abstract</hi> of the most remarkable Passages in it. <hi>And
I pray God</hi> (to use the Author's Words in his Epistle Dedica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tory
with a little Alteration) <hi>it may answer my honest Inten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion,
which is to do Good to the World by it, to open the
Eyes of those miserable misled Souls that in numerous Droves
have been seduced into Faction and Disloyalty and to direct
their wandering Steps into the Paths of Righteousness, Peace,
and Obedience.</hi>

            <head>An Abstract (with Remarks) of Dr. Scot's
Sermon, preached at Chelmford Assizes,
on Rom. 13. 1. Let every Soul be subject
to the Higher Powers, &amp;c.</head>
            <p>HEre is the Extent of this Duty,<note place="margin">Pag. 1.</note> it is to <hi>every
Soul;</hi> that is, to every Man, of what Order,
or Degree, or Quality soever; whether he
be High or Low, Rich or Poor, Spiritual
or Secular, none are exempted, <hi>Let every Soul be sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject;</hi>
without any exception either of St. <hi>Peter</hi> and
his Successors, or of the Body of the
<note n="*" place="margin">
                  <hi>Qu.</hi> Whether the People then have Power to depose their Lawful Sovereign, and elect a new King? and whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther to do so, is not Popery?</note>People; for the Reason extends
equally to both, because <hi>the Powers
that are are ordained of God;</hi> they
are by God's Commission, and rule
by his Authority; and therefore
neither the <hi>Bishop</hi> of <hi>Rome,</hi> nor the
<hi>Majority</hi> of the <hi>People,</hi> can claim
exemption from this Duty of Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jection,<note place="margin">
                  <hi>Qu.</hi> Whether the Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vention then did not set themselves above God?</note>
without arrogating to them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves
an Authority superiour to
Gods.</p>
            <p>You have here the Matter of this Duty, and that
is to be <hi>subject;</hi> in which comprehensive Phrase is
included the whole Duty of Subjects to their Princes
and Governours, honouring their Persons, reverencing
their Authority, <hi>assisting</hi> them against their Enemies,
defending the Rights of their Government, and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>scientiously
rendering to them their Customs and
<pb n="2" facs="tcp:98670:4"/>
Tribute, but more especially and particularly it in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cludes
our free and ready Submission to them in
yielding a chearful Obedience to their Commands, so
far as we can innocently and consistently with our
Duty to God; and where we cannot, in patiently un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dergoing
all those Pains and Penalties they shall think
meet to inflict on us for our Disobedience, in suffer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
their unjust Persecutions without murmuring or
clamour, without disturbing their Government, or
resisting their Authority, or endeavoring to repel their
Force with Force, but meekly submitting our Cause
to God, who is the Patron and Protestor of oppressed
Innocence.</p>
            <p>This Duty of Subjection to our Superiors,<note place="margin">Pag. 8.</note> implies
our meek and patient Submission to the Penalties of
their Laws, when upon a full Perswasion of the un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lawfulness
of them we cannot actually comply with
them; for when the Commands of our Prince do in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terfere
with the Commands of God, it is an undoubted
Rule, That <hi>we must obey God rather than Man:</hi> But
then at the same time that our Allegiance to the
Throne of Heaven obliges us to refuse <hi>Active</hi> Obe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dience
to our temporal Prince, it indispensably obliges
us to render <hi>Passive,</hi> and not to use
any Violence against him,<note place="margin">
                  <hi>Qu.</hi> How faithfully Dr. <hi>Scot,</hi> and his Swearing Bre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thren, have observed this Doctrine?</note> though
it be in the Defence of our Estates,
or Liberties, or Lives, or which
ought to be dearer than all, our
Religion; for the just use of Vio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lence
is founded in a just Authority over the Person
upon whom it is exercised, and supposes a Right in
him that uses it to call the Person to account against
whom he uses it, and punish him according to his
<pb n="3" facs="tcp:98670:4"/>
demerit, without which Right the use of Violence is
an injurious Outrage and Oppression; but Sovereign
Princes are in their several Dominions next to and
immediate under God, the most high Sovereign of
the World, and therefore having no Authority but his
above them, are accountable only at his Tribunal;
so that for Subjects, in any Case whatsoever, to offer
Violence to their Prince, is to usurp the Throne, and
invade his Sovereign Tribunal; for in offering Vio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lence
to them we claim a Superiority over them, and
in so doing impiously trespass upon the Peculiar of the
Almighty, and arrogate his Divine Prerogative of be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
King of Kings, and Lord of Lords: For since
God alone is placed above them, as being the sole
King of Sovereign Kings, how can we assume Supe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riority
over them, without setting our selves in the
Place of God? Unless therefore we will render our
selves guilty of the highest Affront to, and Propha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nation
of, the Divine Majesty, we have no other Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>medy,
when ever we are reduced to that Extremity,
as that we cannot obey our Prince without disobeying
God, but to discharge our Duty couragiously, and
faithfully, and meekly, and quietly to submit to the
unjust Persecutions of our Prince, referring our Cause
to that Sovereign Tribunal before which Princes and
Peasants must one day give Account together, for
every unjust and unrighteous Action. And though this
may seem a hard Chapter to those who consider only
one side of the Case, yet there is nothing more ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parent
than that the Liberty of resisting Princes would
prove a far greater Mischief to the World than all the
Cruelties and Oppressions of the most barbarous Ty<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rants;
for what though there was never any Gover<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour
<pb n="4" facs="tcp:98670:5"/>
so wise and good as not to be chargable with
some Faults and Miscarriages, we ought to consider
that our World must be govern'd by Men, and not
by Angels, and that perhaps there never was any Law<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful
Prince so bad, the Benefits of whose Government
did not far outweigh the Mischiefs of his Tyranny;
and therefore it is wisely eligible for us rather to
suffer a less Evil than to deprive our selves of a greater
Good.</p>
            <p>The third and last Consideration in this Duty,<note place="margin">Pag. 12.</note> 
               <hi>viz.</hi>
the Object of it, <hi>the Higher Powers;</hi> by which its
evident we are to understand the Persons of Sovereign
Princes and Governors,
and not the Laws and
Constitutions, as some of
<note n="*" place="margin">Of which Number the Bishop of St. <hi>Asaph,</hi> even Dr. <hi>Scot.</hi> being Judg, is to be reckon'd; who, in his Discourse of <hi>God's Ways of disposing of Kingdoms,</hi> Pag. 7. expounds <hi>Rom.</hi> 13. 1. after a new Fashion, putting Kingdoms for Kings, and resist<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing their Laws for resisting their Persons; whereas the latter is a Crime, whilst the former may be a Virtue; or else the Three Children in <hi>Daniel</hi> sinn'd, and were, according to that Author, damn'd. His Words are these, Pag. 7. <hi>The Powers that be are of God;</hi> that is, The several King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>doms and States, even all that are in the World, all have their Authority from God. And whosoever disobeys or resists the publick Order and Government of the Kingdom, or State where he lives, he disobeys or resists the Ordinance of God; and <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap>, he shall be called to Account for it, or as it is in our English Bible, <hi>shall receive to himself damnation.</hi>
               </note>our Republican Doctors
pretend; for this Epistle
was writ either under
<hi>Claudius</hi> or <hi>Nero,</hi> whose
Wills were the only Laws
they govern'd by, and yet
these were the Higher
Powers to whom the A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>postle
requires our Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jection;
and those whom
he here calls the <hi>Higher
Powers,</hi> in the third Verse
he calls the <hi>Rulers,</hi> and
in the fourth Verse he
tells us that this Higher
Power is the <hi>Minister of
God, a Revenger to exe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cute
Wrath upon him that
<pb n="5" facs="tcp:98670:5"/>
doth evil,</hi> which must necessarily be meant of the Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernors,
and not of the Laws; and accordingly St. <hi>Pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter</hi>
thus explains it, 1 <hi>Pet. 2. 3. Be subject to every
Ordinance of Man for the Lord's sake, whether it be to
the King, <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap>, as Supreme,</hi> which is the very
Word that is used here for the <hi>Higher Powers;</hi> so
that by the <hi>Higher Powers</hi> here, must be meant the
Person or Persons that are rested with the Supreme

            <p>Now the Supreme Power to which we in this Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
owe subjection is the King,<note place="margin">Pag. 13.</note> whom our Laws do
declare and recognize to be our Supreme and Sovereign
Lord; for so, for instance, the Statute of Premunire
declares, That <hi>the Crown of</hi> England <hi>is in no earthly sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jection,
but immediately subject to God in all things touching
the Regality of the same.</hi>—And in other Laws it
is declared to be High Treason to Levy Arms against
the King, either within or without the Realm, and
that it is unlawful for both or ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
Houses of Parliament to raise
or levy War offensive or defensive
against his Majesty,<note place="margin">
                  <hi>Qu.</hi> Then whether the Convention did act honestly and consistently with their Duty, to raise such immense Sums, to levy War against the King in <hi>Ireland?</hi>
               </note> or his Heirs
and Lawful Successors; and that it
is not Lawful upon any pretence
whatsoever to take Arms against
the King,<note place="margin">
                  <hi>Qu.</hi> Whether to take Arms against the King is not now thought and pronoun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ced lawful, the Law being abrogated that made it un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lawful?</note> and that we are to abhor
that traiterous Position of taking
Arms by his Authority against his
Person, or against those who are
commissioned by him.</p>

of our Sins, God should permit us to be so far infa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tuated,

to cross a pile with a Company of beggarly Male-con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tents

selves into present and certain Mischiefs to prevent fu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture

            <p>Consider,<note place="margin">Pag. 25.</note> That upon our faithful Subjection to
our Prince, the Safety of our Religion depends; for
<pb n="8" facs="tcp:98670:7"/>
there is nothing iu the World can more indanger our
Religion than our making it a pretence for Rebellion;
for hereby we inevitably expose it to the hatred of
Princes, and do what in us lies to arm their Power
against it; for by our Actions we do in effect make
this open Declaration to them. <hi>Sirs, To tell you plain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
you may thank our Religion for our Disobedience; we
would be Loyal, but it will not suffer us; and therefore
ye were best have a care of it, it will undermine your
Thrones, and will one time or other arm the hands of
your People against your Persons and Dignities:</hi> When
therefore we set up our Religion against our Gover<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nours,
we force them in their own Defence to set
themselves against it, and to endeavour as far as in
them lies to root it out of the World; and if being
provoked by our Sedition they should ever draw their
Swords against it, it may thank us for it, who first
began the Quarrel, and gave the Challenge, and did
in effect declare by our Actions, that unless they for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ced
us to lay down our Religion, our Religion would
force them to lay down their Crowns; yea, and
though we should succeed in our Rebellion, and prove
too hard for our Governours, yet first or last our<note n="*" place="margin">Tho I hope, and I heartily with, that Dr. <hi>Scot</hi> may prove a false Prophet as to what he predicts in this Paragraph of the direful Effects of a <hi>Religious Rebellion,</hi> yet should it happen (which God avert) that our Religion should at last smart for it, that it should be rooted out of the World, and have its dismal Funeral Exit (which some holy learned Men, who perhaps by the Spirit of Prophecy did foresee this wretched Rebellion, have pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dicted, as Dr. <hi>Plumè</hi> observes in his Preface to Dr. <hi>Hacket</hi>'s Sermon, Pag. 15. last Paragr.) whom may we thank for it, but these Members of the Church of <hi>England</hi> who have succeeded in their Rebellion, which the Doctor, and his prevaricuting Brethren, by false Oaths, wicked Prayers, and Setitious Anti-Gospel Preachings have promoted and abet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted. But though the Argument which the Doctor suggests to a highly provoked Prince be so genuine and natural, as to put him upon the most tremondous Instances of Indignation and Revenge; yet 'tis not to be doubted, but that the Innocent, yea, and the Penitent too (if they are not too late so, like the harden'd Sinner who spurns at the Bowels of Mercy, and defies a Pardon, until the time of Justice, the hour of Vengeance surprize and overtake him) will find a kinder Usage from the Justice and Clemency of a Prince, who has signaliz'd himself to be a true English-man, a Father of his Country, and of the forgiving Race.</note> Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion

Lastly,<note place="margin">Pag. 28.</note> Consider that if we of this Nation had no
other Motive, yet in meer gratitude we stand obliged
to render our faithful Subjection to our Prince; for
considering with what an easy and indulgent Govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment,
and with what a Succession of excellent Princes
God Almighty hath blessed us, I know no Nation un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der
the cope of Heaven that may be so happy as our
selves, if we please; for as our Government is, in the
Frame and Constitution of it, a most easy Yoke, and
gentle Burthen, so, for sundry Ages, we have had
Princes as gentle and gracious as our Governments;
Princes that have studied our Ease and our Happiness,
and that have in nothing so much exceeded as in their
Mercy and Indulgence towards us.</p>
            <p>Not to mention that pious and every way incom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parable

And then that Reverend Author proceeds to give

And now to him (that is, King <hi>Charles</hi> the Second)
in despite of all the Hellish Machinations of a restless

               <hi>Rightful Lord</hi>

to make us amends for the

indeed considering the Great and
Princely Virtues which adorn his
Mind, and shine through the whole
Sphere of his Activity, we have all the Encouragement
in the World to promise our selves a Continuance of
those Halcion days, under his happy Influence, if by

of Temper; if from the fair Conjunction of all these
