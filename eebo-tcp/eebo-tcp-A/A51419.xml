            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>

The Pious and Religious Reader,
Grace and Peace in Christ Jesus.</head>
            <p>
               <seg rend="decorInit">T</seg>He matter subject of this Treatise being yet
in suspense, and to be determin'd <hi>de fu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture,
viz.</hi> What Ecclesiasticall Govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
is to be judged to be, <hi>according to the
Word of God,</hi> in respect of the office it self,
and also the <hi>Best</hi> in respect of its use: Af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
that, upon more and more deliberation,
I had perfected my conlusion, the saying of <hi>Augustine</hi> came in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to
my mind, <hi>He that concealeth a truth, and he that teacheth
a falshood are both guilty: the first because he will not profit;
the other because he intendeth to hurt and delude:</hi> which I
apprehend as a double caution, both of not publishing any Uto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pian
Ecclesiasticall form of Government of mine own forging,
as also, of not stifling, by my silence, a form truly Apostolicall.</p>
            <p>Which Resolution, notwithstanding, I did not adventure to
take, before that I was fortified in my perswasion by a general
consent of Protestant Divines of reformed Churches, and among
others, in some principal points appealing to the Divines of the
Church of <hi>Geneva;</hi> Nor yet do we so much insist upon their
Confessions as upon their Proofs, especially being grounded up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
two infallible foundations. The first, the general verdict
of Antiquity, as well Doctrinall as Historicall: Though
we should not name that general Council of <hi>Calcedon</hi> con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sisting
of 630 Fathers, which by one Canon decreed it to be a
Sacriledge to presse down a Bishop into the degree of a Presby<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter.
The same Council that did also ordain another Canon,
which was then the very break-neck of Romish Popedome.</p>
            <p>
               <pb facs="tcp:108873:3"/>
2. The Authenticall Texts of Scripture so far as thereby to
demonstrate Christ his own approbation of Episcopal Prelacy
after his Ascension in the Churches of <hi>Asia:</hi> in one whereof
without all contradiction was one <hi>Polycarpus</hi> Bishop and
Martyr.</p>
            <p>As for the Churches, whereof we are to speak, the Tractate
hath been undertaken in behalf of Protestant Churches, which
practice at this day the same Prelacy under these two divers
names of Episcopacy and Superintendency, as much exceeding
the number of those which are destitute of Bishops, yet so, as
justly condemning the Romish Hierarchy (rather Tyranny)
poysoned with most grosse Idolatry; and not so onely, but so
far opposite to the Episcopacy which we defend, that it is a
false Usurpation, that all Bishops be originally deduced from
the Pope, and dependant upon him. Other Churches destitute
of Bishops we differ from, yet not so (far be it from us) as not
to account them essential Churches of Christ, but to whom as
formerly, we do desirously give the right hand of Brotherly
fellowship; to joyn against the common and grand adversary
in the Romish <hi>Babylon.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Concerinng other points circumstantial we have provided,
that our Method be with coherence, our Styl plain and even,
our Allegations direct and punctual, our Authors justly approve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able,
our Taxations toothless, and our Inferencies brief, perti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nent
and consectary.</p>
            <p>As for you (good Christian Reader) his hope is, that he
shall not need the use of the Apostles Expostulation, saying,
<hi>Am I your enemy because I tell you the truth?</hi> And his prayer
to God shall be to protect and blesse you, to the glory of his
saving Grace in Christ Jesus, that he also will distribute to this
our lacerated Church, some portion of that his peerlesse Legacy
left unto his Apostles, when he said, <hi>My peace I leave with
you,</hi> by vertue whereof, we may with one heart and mind faith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fully
worship God in Spirit and in Truth.</p>

an agreement in the thing signified, there ought not to be any

               </p>
               <p>First is from the original occasion, whereunto he alludeth,
even the contention in the Church of <hi>Corinth,</hi> when<note n="c" place="margin">Hieron. in 1. Tit.

                  <hi>That the
words of the Apostle will not suffer me</hi> (saith he) <hi>to doubt but
that alteration was made in the dayes of the Apostles,</hi> and his
confirmation is as doubtlesse; namely, because no man can pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duce
any other original of the questioned Schisme and con<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>tention.
This is a chief point, and therefore we desire to
hear what<note n="e" place="margin">Videlius in Epist. Ignat. ad Philadelphenses, cap. 14.

say unto it. He handleth the matter accurately, which is to
be reserv'd to its proper place. In summe, out of <hi>Ignatius</hi> the

                  <hi>talking of a</hi> prophecy of a future contention which should

of Antiquity of more esteem, then the Epistle of <hi>Clement</hi> unto
the Corinthians. <hi>Then;</hi> That this was brought to light by a
learned Gentleman <hi>Mr.</hi> Patrick Young: <hi>and lastly for the
matter it self,</hi> That there is a common and promiscuous use of
the word Presbyter and Bishop.</p>
               <p>We shall answer punctually to every one, <hi>viz.</hi> The <hi>Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phecy</hi>
maketh for us, the <hi>Epistle</hi> much more, the <hi>Publisher</hi> also
as much as can be desired, and that Objection of the indiffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rency
of the Words of <hi>Bishop</hi> and <hi>Presbyter</hi> is scarce worthy
the mention.</p>
               <p>We begin with the <hi>Prophecy<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
                  </hi> The <hi>Prophecy</hi> was only,


<pb n="22" facs="tcp:108873:15"/>
that there should be in time to come, <hi>a contention about the
word Bishop.</hi> If we should ask our Opposites, when this conten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
was first known in times of old, they would be loth to tell
us, knowing right well, that it was first raised by one <hi>Aerius,</hi>
of whom <hi>Epiphanius</hi> and <hi>Austin</hi> have<note n="*" place="margin">See above.</note> told us, that he broke
out into Schisme, and<note n="*" place="margin">See above.</note> 
                  <hi>because he could not obtain to be
made a Bishop,</hi> did therefore spurne against Episcopacy,
teaching, saith St. <hi>Austin, that there ought to be no difference
between Bishops and Presbyters;</hi> therefore thus they may see
the Prophecy fulfilled, both when, and in whom, if they like
it. But if any shall boast, that it is fulfilled now by their pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sent
Opposalls against Episcopacy, after that it hath had ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>probation
with a continuall use universally in the Churches of
God: Then have we nothing else to reply, but what the spirit
of God, from the pen of the holy Apostle, putteth in our
mouth; <hi>If any be contentious</hi> (saith he) <hi>we have no such cu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stome,
nor the Churches of God,</hi> whereby the wilfully conten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tious
maketh himself an adversary to the Churches of God, and
consequently no way acceptable to God himself.</p>
               <p>The second point which we are to discerne, is that, which
they call identity of names of <hi>Bishops</hi> and <hi>Presbyters:</hi> they
should have called it community of names, especially know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
that there is no more identity in the words <hi>Presbyters</hi> and
<hi>Bishops,</hi> then there is between the letters of <hi>P.</hi> and <hi>B.</hi> But
this was a lapse: Therefore to our matter in hand. We an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>swer,
that meer names and words make but verball conse<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quences,
to which we oppose a reall and Logicall consequence
<hi>à paribus,</hi> thus: For of the very Apostles of Christ one insti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led
himself <hi>Co-presbyter,</hi> another himself <hi>Presbyter,</hi> a third
himself <hi>Deacon,</hi> who are all common names with others that
were not Apostles; and notwithstanding, the Apostles them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves
in respect of their offices and Functions were Gover<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nours
over Presbyters: which sheweth that the enterchange<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ablenesse
of names cannot conclude an indifferency of degree.
But this <hi>

                     </gap>rambe</hi> will be sodden once again, when we shall be

and deeds,</hi> namely concerning this <hi>Clement?</hi> Not only that
he maintained the distinct degrees of Episcopacy, but that also
he was distinctly above Presbyters, a Bishop himself. Yet
should not our Opposites pose us in that, where<note n="a" place="margin">Vedelius. Exercit. 8. ad Mariam in Ig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>natium, cap. 3.

a Professour of <hi>Geneva</hi> gave them (if they have read him)
some satisfaction; shewing, <hi>that as soon as</hi> Clemens <hi>remained
the sole Adjutour of the Apostles after</hi> Linus <hi>and</hi> Cletus, <hi>the
name of Bishop was given unto him, and not attributed to any
Presbyter, or Presbyters in the Church of Rome.</hi> So he. Is not
this to the point; the distinguishing of times doth solve many
doubts. It is meet now at length we hear <hi>Clemens</hi> him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>self
speak. <hi>Clement</hi> immediately after his relation of the afore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>said
Prophecy, addeth, saying concerning the Apostles,<note n="b" place="margin">Clement ad Corinth. Epist<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> p. 57. <gap reason="foreign">

                  <hi>for
this cause, they having a perfect foreknowledge, constitu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted
the aforesaid, and left a description of Officers and Ministers
in their course, who after that they themselves should fall asleep,
other Godly men might succeed and execute their function.</hi> So
<hi>Clement.</hi> Whence it is evidently collected, that Bishops were
the successours of the Apostles, because a Role and Catalogue
of Bishops is frequently had in Ecclesiasticall stories, lineally
deduced from the Apostles, as the most of the learned Prote<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stants
of the Reformed Churches have ever confessed. But if
our Opposites cannot prove the like Catalogue of Presbyters
of a primitive and right line of descent, then are they wholy
to yeeld the cause, and that even by the judgment of <hi>Clement,</hi>
which is now ready to be furthermore confessed by the exact
learning of the Publisher of <hi>Clement.</hi> This Gentleman, our
Opposites call Learned, we owe him an higher Title, even one
exquisitely learned; he commenting upon the same Epistle of
<hi>Clement,</hi> now objected against Episcopacy, teacheth that the
right word <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap> agreeth with the word <hi>census</hi> in <hi>Tertullian</hi>
by whom it appeareth, that it was a custome in Apostolicall
Churches to make a Role (for this word he held not unfit) of
the order of Bishops to bring them unto their first originall,
even as, saith <hi>Tertullian, Polycarpus,</hi> was from <hi>John</hi> the Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stle
in the Church of <hi>Smyrna,</hi> and <hi>Clemens,</hi> in the Church
of <hi>Rome,</hi> from <hi>Peter,</hi> speaking even of this our <hi>Clemens,</hi> and


<pb n="24" facs="tcp:108873:16"/>
addeth of others; <hi>and others</hi> (saith he) <hi>whom the Apostles
constituted Bishops, from whom others might deduce their tra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ductions
and offsprings;</hi> what is, if this be not, an inexpugnable
convincement of our Opposites to prove Episcopacy to be of
an Apostolical Ordination? Yet is not this all.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Clement</hi> is further represented unto us by the same learned
Publisher, as one register'd and enroll'd by antiquity as Bishop
of <hi>Rome,</hi> in the Catalogue of the same Bishops lineally descen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded
from the Apostles, whether in the first, second or third
rank, it matters not; and the doubt, such as it is, is solved
in the Margent by our foresaid <hi>Geneva</hi> Professour: And for

which our Opposites have objected against us; which if you

                  <p>In the Book of Revelation, Christ by his <hi>Angel</hi> (properly

expoundeth their meanings; <hi>seven starres</hi> to signifie
<hi>seven Angels of the seven Churches;</hi> and <hi>seven candlesticks,</hi>
to betoken the <hi>seven Churches,</hi> vers. 20. By and by, descend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
to particulars, he directeth his several Epistles to the
several seven Angels of the seven Churches, beginning at the
Church of <hi>Ephesus,</hi> saying, <hi>Write to the Angel of the Church of
Ephesus,</hi> and so of the rest. These are our Texts, which we
are, in discussing these our differences, to insist upon.</p>

                  <p>We readily grant, that whatsoever matter was written to
these Angels concerning either themselves or others, were by
them to be communicated severally to the Churches, and all
the faithfull as they were interested therein, according to that
<hi>Epiphonema,</hi> severally applied in every Epistle thus; <hi>[He

is, whether each of these Angels of the Churches were

We are therefore according to true method: first, to

But, in the first place, be it known that our Opposites in
their negatives are distracted into three Opinions. One sort,
by the word <hi>Angel,</hi> will have understood <hi>the whole Church
collectively,</hi> as well Laitie as Clergy. Not so, say the second

its neither so nor so; but by Angel is meant one indi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vidual

                  <p>THis indeed is the common exposition of our opposites,
whereunto our objectours adhere, upon, as they call
them <hi>firme Arguments,</hi> as first; <hi>Our first Argument,</hi> say they

                  <p>
                     <hi>Our second Argument</hi> (say they) <hi>is drawn from the Phrases
even in this very book of Revelations,</hi>
                     <note place="margin">Smect. vindi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cation.</note>

                     <pb n="40" facs="tcp:108873:24"/>
Rome <hi>called a Beast with ten heads, which proveth that the
Angell might be taken collectively.</hi> Is this all! Master <hi>Meade</hi>
(say they) <hi>one better skil'd in the meaning of the Revelation,
then our adversary, said, that the word Angell is commonly</hi> [if
not alwayes] <hi>in the Revelation taken collectively.</hi> So they.
This saying have I diligently sought after, but it fled from me:
But yet I shall be content to be satisfied of Mr. <hi>Meade</hi> his
meaning from his other sayings more obvious unto me, to shew,
that he hath not been rightly understood by these obje<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctours.
For <hi>Collectively,</hi> properly taken, is a word compre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hending
a multitude without distinction of persons, as Christ
in his Lamentation said, <hi>[O Hierusalem, how oft would I have
gathered thy Children, but tho<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                           <desc>•</desc>
                        </gap> wouldst not]</hi> where the words
singular <hi>Thou, and Thy,</hi> do here comprehend all the Citizens
of <hi>Hierusalem</hi> without distinction. Had Master <hi>Meade</hi> this
collective sense? He sheweth the flat contrary, <hi>Apoc. 9. 14.</hi>
[four Angells] <hi>These four</hi> (saith he) <hi>were put for Nations,
which they were thought to Govern.</hi> So then, they did repre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sent
Nations, as notwithstanding to be distinctly their four
Governours. Next upon <hi>Revel. 14 6.</hi> [I saw another An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gell
flying] <hi>We are to call to mind</hi> (saith he) <hi>that which be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
was</hi> cap. 7. <hi>shewed: that the Angells of like Visions de re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>present
them, of whom they have Government wheresoever.</hi>
And again upon vers. 7. <hi>The flying Angell is ruler, not onely of
men, but also of a more eminent ranke.</hi> So he. If that our Ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jectours
had (according to Master <hi>Meade's</hi> direction) but cal'd
to minde his own explanations, they might have easily per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived
he said no more, then as if we may grant that under the
word Angell, to whom the Epistle is in speciall directed, are
implyed all those who are concern'd therein. But how? Not
by alteration of his person, but by communion of interest, for
which cause Master <hi>Beza</hi> accknowledged him the President
over others, even as many other Protestant Divines are ready
to do, and that as exactly as either we can desire, or our Op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>posites
mislike, when we come to discharge the affirmative
point.</p>
                  <p>Two Answers we wish our Opposites to take into their se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cond


<pb n="41" facs="tcp:108873:24"/>
thoughts; One, as they have presented him by way of
comparison, as <hi>better skill'd</hi> in the Book of the Revelation
then his adversary: the other, as he is to be singly respected,
and in his own worthinesse. To the first we say, that compa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rison
might well have been forborne, which now provoketh
us to another comparison, between him and one as dear to
our Opposites as any other, whom they know to have been
as conversant in the Book of the Revelation altogether, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in
he, notwithstanding, after the second and third Chapters,
hath been so far from the collective interpretation of the
word Angell, that he hath not any where, as we can find,
set it down as comprehending any Multitude, nay in many
places he expresseth by name the individual persons them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves,
or some <hi>Individuum Vagum</hi> signified thereby, some sin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gular
notable one.</p>
                  <p>The consideration of Master <hi>Meade</hi> his worthinesse and
judgement touching Episcopacy, would be had the rather,
because we have read the Translation of his Book authoriz'd
in this manner, <hi>It is Ordered by the Committee of the Commons
House in Parliament, that the Book entituled, The Key of the
Revelation, be printed.</hi> So they. Which Key doth unlock unto
us his judgement in behalf of Episcopacy, to be so fully
according to the word of God, that part. 1. <hi>c. 4. v. 67. p. 35.
The four and twenty Elders</hi> (saith he) <hi>compasse next about the
throne, which represent the Bishops and Prelates of the Chur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ches,
and do answer both in place and order to the Levites and
Priests in the Camps of</hi> Israel, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> Thus Master <hi>Meade,</hi> so
commended by our Opposites themselves, who if they shall
approve his Key in this point, it is well, we in imparting thus
much unto them have but done our duty.</p>

but he saith not likewise that the seven Starres are the seven

do not signifie seven individual Pastours. So they. Whose Te<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nents

a Mystery; Secondly, that the Mystery signified thereby
is this, <hi>that the word Angel is not individually, but collectively

                     </gap>, that is a word not expres<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed
following upon course in the understanding of any ratio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal
Reader. As for example: If any one of our Opposites

the black Horse and the white, omitting in the second place
the word Horse, which word doth follow in course of com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon
understanding; yet his man should bring only the
black, but not the white, might his excuse have been, It
was a Mystery?</p>
                  <p>Secondly, were it that a Mystery should be imagined
therein, yet that denial of the word Angel, to be an indivi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dual

                  <hi>through his whole Commenta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries
upon the same Book, taketh the word Angel so far indi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vidually,
as to enterpret it of some one person, either expresly by
name, or else equivalently by an</hi> Individuum vagum <hi>as thus,
some not able one, or the like.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>In the second place, we do appeale to the Texts them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves
to give a sufficient taste; for oftentime the Angels are
reckoned seven, and after distributed ordinatively into first,
second, third, and so till the seventh, as plainly as one can
reckon the seven dayes in the week, Chap. 15. and 16.
Afterwards we have recited one Angel having the Key of the
bottomlesse pit, Chap. 20. was there need of a Collectively
understood multitude of Angels to keep one Key? The like
may be said of a mighty Angel for delivering a little booke,
Chap. 10. 1, 2. Besides the Angel whom <hi>John</hi> is said to have
worshiped, Chap. 22. will they say this Angel also to com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prehend
a Multitude? Then might the Angel reply, have you
forgot when I said to John, <hi>I am thy fellow Servant,</hi> but five
words, and every one an Individuall.</p>
               <p>Thirdly, to return to the questioned Text, whereas some
of the Angels are commended for notable vertues, and as
much condemned for some notorious vices; they that think
that all the same vices and vertues did as well imply every
Pastour in all the Colleges of the seven Churches, may as well
conceive, that where the deformities are noted in any Cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poration,


<pb n="50" facs="tcp:108873:29"/>
therefore every person in it is equally flat-nosed,
crook't-legged,
bald-headed, and the like,</p>
               <p>Lastly, the Angels and Churches being both reckoned distin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctly
seven times, that there should be a Collective number of
the Order of Pastours, without so much as any insinuation of
distinguishing them either from Angels, or Churches; have
they any Key to unlock such a Mystery? From this kind of
reasoning, we passe unto an evidence of no lesse importance,

               <head type="sub">That Christ himself shewed his approbation of the Prelacy
which the foresaid Angels had in their severall Churches.</head>
               <p>THere was yet never either favourites to Episcopacy, nor
opposites against it, but have granted, that whatsoever
the Government was meant in these seven Churches, it had
the approbation of Christ by the tenour of his Epistles writ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten
unto them. First from the words of the Chap. 1. 1. <hi>[The
Revelation of Jesus Christ sent by his Angel to his Servant
John]</hi> to acknowledge the Epistles to have been dictated
by Christ himself, conveied by an Angel to <hi>Iohn,</hi> and as it fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>loweth
in the second and third Chapters, distributed by <hi>Iohn</hi>
to the severall Angels, and communicated to the Churches.
After this, by the vertue of the same letters, an inquisition is
made, (as it were a Visitation kept) upon every Angel of the
Churches, concerning the discharge of their offices; wherein
two of them are found of weight and commendable, the
other five, more or lesse criminally deliquents, yet so, as to
manifest a justification of the Offices. The approbation of the
function is seen, not only (which reason none can deny) by
Christ his commending their <hi>diligence, zeal, and faithfull<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse;</hi>
but even likewise in his processe of <hi>convictions, repre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hensions,
and denuntiations</hi> against their <hi>remissenesse, dissolute<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse,
and faithfulnesse</hi> of others; but how? certainly, so that
the condemnation of their vices and abuses argued an appro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bation
of their Offices and Functions, because it was done, not
with an absolute intent to remove them at the first, but onely
to reforme them, and continue them upon their Reformation;
therefore was it said from Christ to one, <hi>Repent, or else, &amp;c.</hi>
Chap. 2. 5. &amp; 16. to another, <hi>Repent, if not, I will come against
thee,</hi> and the like; this we see was no deprivation of the Of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficers
at first, much lesse abolition of the Offices which were
to continue from age to age.</p>

directing his letters unto them thus indefinitly, without any

be conceived to have understood any other thereby, but
such as by some degree of eminency were distinguishable from
all the rest of the Churches that were in <hi>Asia,</hi> and in some sort
also did comprehend all the rest under them.</p>
            <p>For taking <hi>Asia</hi> here in that stricter sense, wherein the New
Testament useth it, as denoting the <hi>Lydian Asia</hi> alone (of the
circuit whereof I have treated<note n="f" place="margin">Disquisit. touching the <hi>Asia</hi> properly so called, &amp;c. chap. 2.</note> elsewhere more particularly)
it is not to be imagined, that after so long pains taken by the
Apostles and their disciples in the husbanding of that part of
the Lords vineyard, there should be found no more but <hi>seven</hi>
Churches therein, especially since S. <hi>Paul</hi> that<note n="g" place="margin">1 Cor. 3. 10.</note>

               <hi>a great door and effectu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>all

<note n="i" place="margin">Act. 19. 10, 20.</note> 
               <hi>all they which dwelt in</hi> Asia <hi>heard the word of the Lord Ie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sus,
both Iews and Greeks; so mightily grew the Word of God
and prevailed.</hi> Which extraordinary blessing of God upon his
labours, moved the Apostle to make his residence<note n="k" place="margin">Act. 20. 18. 31.</note> in those

            <head>The Apostolicall Institution of
EPISCOPACY; deduced out of
the premises, by W. C.</head>
            <p>
               <seg rend="decorInit">I</seg>F we abstract from Episcopall government
all accidentals, and consider onely what is
essentiall and necessary to it; we shall find
in it no more but this: An appointment
of one man of eminent sanctity and suffici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ency
to have the care of all the Churches,
within a certain Precinct or Diocesse; and
furnishing him with authority, not absolute or arbitrary, but
regulated and bounded by lawes, and moderated by joyning to
him a convenient number of assistants. To the intent that all
the Churches under him may be provided of good and able Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stours:
and that both of Pastours and people conformity to
lawes and performance of their duties may be required, under
penalties, not left to discretion, but by law appointed.</p>
            <p>To this kind of government I am not by any particular in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terest
so devoted, as to think it ought to be maintained, ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
in opposition to Apostolick institution, or to the much
desired reformation of mens lives, and restauration of Primi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tive
discipline, or to any law or precept of our Lord and Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viour
Jesus Christ: for that were to maintain a means con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary
to the end. For obedience to our Saviour is the end for
which Church Government is appointed. But if it may be
demonstrated, or made much more probable then the contra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry,
as I verily think it may: I. That it is not repugnant to


<pb n="78" facs="tcp:108873:43"/>
the government setled in and for the Church by the Apostles.
II. That it is as complyable with the reformation of any
evill which we desire to reform either in Church or State,
or the introduction of any good which we desire to intro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duce,
as any other kind of government; And III. That there
is no law, no record of our Saviour against it: then I hope it
will not be thought an unreasonable motion, if we humbly
desire those that are in authority, especially the High Court
of Parliament, that it may not be sacrificed to clamour, or
over-born by violence: and though (which God forbid) the
greater part of the multitude should cry, <hi>Crucifie, Crucifie,</hi>
yet our Governours would be so full of Justice and cou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rage,
as not to give it up untill they perfectly understand con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerning
Episcopacy it self, <hi>Quid mali fecit.</hi> I shall speak at
this time only of the first of these three points: That Episco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pacy
is not repugnant to the government setled in the Church
for perpetuity by the Apostles. Whereof I conceive this which
followes as clear a demonstration, as any thing of this nature is
capable of.</p>
            <p>That this government was received universally in the Church,
either in the Apostles time, or presently after, is so evident and
unquestionable, that the most learned adversaries of this go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernment
do themselves confesse it.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Petrus Molinaeus,</hi> in his book <hi>De munere postorali,</hi> pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>posely
written in defence of the Presbyteriall government, ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>knowledgeth:
That presently after the Apostles times, or
even in their time (as Ecclesiasticall story witnesseth) it was
ordained, That in every City one of the Presbytery should be
called a Bishop, who should have preheminence over his Col<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leagues;
to avoid confusion which oft times ariseth out of e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quality.
And truly this form of government all Churches every
where received.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Theodorus Beza,</hi> in his Tract <hi>De triplici Episcopatus ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nere,</hi>
confesseth in effect the same thing. For having distin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guished
Episcopacy into three kinds, <hi>Divine, Humane,</hi> and
<hi>Satanicall,</hi> and attributing to the second (which he calls <hi>Hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mane,</hi>
but we maintain and conceive to be <hi>Apostolicall)</hi> not


<pb n="79" facs="tcp:108873:43"/>
only a priority of order, but a superiority of power, and au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thority
over other Presbyters, bounded yet by lawes and ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nons
provided against Tyranny: he clearly professeth, that of
this kind of Episcopacy is to be understood whatsoever we
read concerning the authority of Bishops or Presidents (as
<hi>Justin Martyr</hi> calls them) in <hi>Ignatius,</hi> and other more anci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ent
Writers.</p>
            <p>Certainly from<note n="*" place="margin">To whom two others al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>so from <hi>Gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>va</hi> may be ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded: <hi>Daniel Chamierus</hi> (in Panstratia, to<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, 2. lib. 10. cap. 6. sect. 24.) and <hi>Nicol. Vedelius</hi> (Exercitat. 3. in epist. Igna<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tii ad Phila<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>delph. cap. 14. &amp; Exercit. 8. in epistol. ad Mariam, cap. 3.) which is fully also de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monstrated in the former Treatise, by the testimo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nies of those who wrote in the very next age after the Apostles.</note> these two great defenders of the Presby<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tery
we should never had this free acknowledgement, so pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>judiciall
to their own pretence, and so advantageous to their
adversaries purpose, had not the evidence of clear and unde<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niable
truth enforced them to it. It will not therefore be ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cessary
to spend any time in confuting that uningenuous asser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
of the Anonymus Authour of the Catalogue of Testimo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nies
for the equality of Bishops and Presbyters, who affirmes,
That their disparity began long after the Apostles times: But
we may safely take for granted that which these two learned
Adversaries have confessed; and see, whether upon this foun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dation
laid by them, we may not by unanswerable reason raise
this superstruction.</p>
            <p>
               <q>That seing Episcopall Government is confessedly so anci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ent
and so Catholique, it cannot with reason be denyed to be
Apostolique.</q>
            </p>
            <p>For so great a change, as between Presbyteriall Govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
and Episcopall, could not possibly have prevailed all
the world over, in a little time. Had Episcopall Govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
been an aberration from, or a corruption of the Govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
left in the Churches by the Apostles, it had been very
strange, that it should have been received in any one Church
so suddainly, or that it should have prevailed in all for ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny
Ages after. <hi>Variâsse debuerat error Ecclesiarum: quod
autem apud omnes unum est, non est erratum, sed traditum.</hi>
Had the Churches err'd, they would have varied. What
therefore is one and the same amongst all, came not sure
by errour, but tradition. Thus <hi>Tertullian</hi> argues very pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bably
from the consent of the Churches of his time, not long


<pb n="80" facs="tcp:108873:44"/>
after the Apostles, and that in matter of opinion much more
subject to unobserv'd alteration. But that in the frame and sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stance
of the necessary government of the Church, a thing al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wayes
in use and practice, there should be so suddain a change
as presently after the Apostles times, and so universall, as re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived
in all the Churches, this is clearly impossible.</p>
            <p>For what universall cause can be assigned or fained of this
universall Apostasie? you will not imagine that the Apostles,
all or any of them, made any decree for this change, when they
were living; or left order for it in any Will or Testament, when
they were dying. This were to grant the question; to wit,
that the Apostles, being to leave the government of the
Churches themselves, and either seeing by experience, or fore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>seeing
by the Spirit of God, the distractions and disorders
which would arise from a multitude of equalls, substituted Epi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>scopall
government instead of their own. Generall Councells
to make a Law for a generall change, for many ages there was
none. There was no Christian Emperour, no coercive power
over the Church to enforce it. Or if there had been any, we
know no force was equall to the courage of the Christians of
those times. Their lives were then at command (for they
had not then learn't to fight for Christ) but their obedience
to any thing against his Law was not to be commanded (for
they had perfectly learn't to die for him.) Therefore there was
no power then to command this change; or if there had been
any, it had been in vain.</p>
            <p>What device then shall we study, or to what fountaine
shall we reduce this strange pretended alteration? Can it
enter into our hearts to think, that all the Presbyters and
other Christians then, being the Apostles Schollers, could be
generally ignorant of the will of Christ, touching the necessi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty
of a Presbyteriall government? Or dare we adventure to
think them so strangely wicked all the world over, as against
knowledge and conscience to conspire against it? Imagine
the spirit of <hi>Diotrephes</hi> had entered into some or a great many
of the Presbyters, and possessed them with an ambitious desire


<pb n="81" facs="tcp:108873:44"/>
of a forbidden superiority, was it possible they should attempt
and atchieve it once without any opposition or contradicti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on?
and besides that the contagion of this ambition should
spread it self and prevail without stop or controule, nay,
without any noyse or notice taken of it, through all the
Churches in the world; all the watchmen in the mean time
being so fast asleep, and all the dogges so dumb, that not
so much as one should open his mouth against it? But let us
suppose (though it be a horrible untruth) that the Presbyters
and people then were not so good Christians as the Presby<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters
are now, that they were generally so negligent to retain
the government of Christs Church commanded by Christ,
which we now are so zealous to restore: yet certainly we
must not forget nor deny that they were men as we are. And
if we look upon them but as meer naturall men, yet know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
by experience how hard a thing it is even for policy
arm'd with power by many attempts and contrivances, and
in a long time to gain upon the liberty of any one people,
undoubtedly we shall never entertain so wild an imaginati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on,
as that among all the Christian Presbyteries in the world,
neither conscience of duty, nor love of liberty, nor averse<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse
from pride and usurpation of others over them, should
prevail so much as with any one, to oppose this pretended
universall invasion of the Kingdome of Christ and the liberty
of Christians.</p>
            <p>When I shall see therefore all the fables in the <hi>Metamor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phosis</hi>
acted and prove stories; when I shall see all the De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mocraties
and Aristocraties in the world lye down and sleep,
and awake into Monarchies: then will I begin to believe that
Presbyteriall government, having continued in the Church
during the Apostles times, should presently after, against the
Apostles doctrine and the will of Christ, be whirl'd about
like a scene in a masque, and transformed into Episcopacy.
In the mean time, while these things remain thus incre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dible,
and in humane reason impossible; I hope I shall have
leave to conclude thus. Episcopall government is acknow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledged


<pb n="82" facs="tcp:108873:45"/>
to have been universally received in the Church,
presently after the Apostles times. Between the Apostles
times and this presently after, there was not time enough for,
nor possibility of, so great an alteration. And therefore there
was no such alteration as is pretended. And therefore Epi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>scopacy,
being confessed to be so ancient and Catholique,
must be granted also to be Apostolique. <hi>Quod erat demon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>strandum.</hi>
