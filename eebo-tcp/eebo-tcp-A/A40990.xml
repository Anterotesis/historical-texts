         <editorialDecl>
            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            <head>The PREFACE.</head>
            <p>THE Reader may, perhaps,
think it ſtrange to find, in
this Diſcourſe, a mixture of Gar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dening
and Geometry; theſe ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving
had hitherto but little com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>munication
with each other. But
ſuch is the wonderful extent of
Mathematicks, that very few
Arts can be named, but what
may be, by a due Application of
them, in a great meaſure im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proved.
At leaſt I hope Expe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rience
will make this plain, in
the very caſe we have under
conſideration.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="viij" facs="tcp:49276:5"/>
I might have publiſhed on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
that part of this Diſcourſe,
which could be underſtood by e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>very
body; or elſe have placed
the Mathematical part, wholy
by it ſelf. But it was hard to
ſeparate them, without an inju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry
to both. And I thought it
better, that whoever dos not care,
for what relates to Geometry,
ſhould be deſired, from hence, to
read only what the Table, or Mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gin,
will ſhew him to be moſt for
his uſe.</p>
            <p>And, leſt the niceſt Reader
ſhould have yet any occaſion to
complain, and think it too great
a trouble, for him to chuſe what
<pb n="ix" facs="tcp:49276:5"/>
he may read, and what he may
paſs over, I have all along ſet, in
the Margin, ſome Commas, over
againſt ſuch places, as any one,
not skilled in the Mathematicks,
may freely avoid. I muſt how<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever
except the two or three firſt
Sheets, which were already Prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted,
before I thought of this Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtinction.
The remaining Diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>courſe,
tho ſome few Words in it
may not be underſtood, by ſuch
as are unacquainted with the
common Terms of ordinary Arts,
will, I hope, neither prove te<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dious,
nor offenſive, to any Lovers,
of Gardening; even Ladies them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves
not excepted. Where I
<pb n="x" facs="tcp:49276:6"/>
have uſed a double row of Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mas,
I deſire to have no other Rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders,
but ſuch as have ſtudyed, to
a great degree, either Natural
Philoſophy, or Mathematicks,
or both.</p>
            <p>It was requiſite that this The<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ory
ſhould not appear, without
its Demonſtration; that ſo the
Curious might know the Ground,
it is built upon; and ſatisfie
the reſt of the World, that here
is no deſign laid, to impoſe upon
them; but, on the contrary, ſuch
hopes offered, of an extraordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nary
Succeſs, in raiſing good and
early Fruits, unleſs the Seaſons
be too much wanting, as amount
<pb n="xj" facs="tcp:49276:6"/>
almoſt to an intire certainty.
Neither could the Directions,
that were to be given, be fitly ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſed,
without borrowing from
Geometry, and ſome other Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thematical
Sciences, their pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per
Language.</p>
            <p>I have endeavoured to be as
ſhort, as I poſſibly could: and there
are ſome places, where, if one
reads faſt, he will hardly con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive
the whole extent of the Diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>courſe.
Such are, for inſtance, the
places, where I ſpeak of Reme<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dies
againſt Winds. That very
brevity, for which diſcerning
Men are uſed to expreſs ſo great
an Eſteem, will make a ſecond
<pb n="xij" facs="tcp:49276:7"/>
reading pleaſanter, leſs trouble<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſom,
and more profitable, whene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver
it will be neceſſary: and will
help to find eaſily, and within a
little compaſs, the Directions
uſeful to Practice.</p>
            <p>As to the Style, I am ſorry to
find ſo very few Words, and not
one Sentence, to have been al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tered,
by ſuch, as were at the
trouble to peruſe my Manuſcript.
But the Example of the Illuſtri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous
Monſieur <hi>Hugens,</hi> who pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liſhed
in French his Theories of
Light and Gravity, tho he was
no perfect Maſter of that Lan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guage,
makes me hope that any
faults, in the Style, will be for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>given
<pb n="xiij" facs="tcp:49276:7"/>
me, eſpecially by Engliſh
Men; who, of all Nations, have
leaſt to reproach me withal, that
I ſhould offer to write this Trea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiſe
in Engliſh. If it be well re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived,
perhaps a ſecond Editi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
may be more accurately pen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned.</p>
            <p>Moſt Countries may reap ſome
Advantage, by the Theory, which
I ſhall propoſe: but eſpecially
ſuch, as have more than 45 De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>grees
Latitude. This compre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hends,
in our Europe, all <hi>En<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gland,
Scotland,</hi> and <hi>Ireland;</hi>
moſt part of <hi>France; Holland,
Flanders, Germany, Switzer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land;</hi>
the North part of <hi>Italy;
<pb n="xiv" facs="tcp:49276:8"/>
Hungary, Sclavonia, Tranſil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vania,
Moldavia  Poland,
Denmark, Sweden, Muſcovy;</hi>
and ſeveral other Countries of
leſs note: but with ſome diffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rence.
Of theſe Countries, ſuch,
as lie more to the South, may ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pect
to have, with our Walls, ſome
excellent Figs, and Grapes, &amp;c.
with ſome of the Fruits of hotter
Climates. But as one goes more
Northwards, tho here and there
ſome new Sorts of Fruits be met
withal, yet fewer and fewer
good Fruits will, by degrees, be
left, eſpecially of thoſe Kinds
that require a great deal of
Heat; till at laſt moſt Fruits, by
<pb n="xv" facs="tcp:49276:8"/>
the help of Sloping Walls, will on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
ſhew better their Shape and
Bigneſs, and perhaps ſomething
of their Flavour, without ever
coming to a perfect maturity. For
I do not doubt but that, even in
thoſe unhappy Climates, the na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tural
Productions, which they
have, will be much mended, by our
Inclining Walls. Southwards of
45 Degrees Latitude, I can no
more reckon, in the North Hemi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſphere,
whole Countries, as con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerned
in this Diſcourſe; but only
ſome particular places, upon Hills
and Mountains; or elſe ſome pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culiar
ſorts of Fruits; of which
ſome may be made forwarder,
<pb n="xvj" facs="tcp:49276:9"/>
without any prejudice from the
Increaſe of Heat; and others may
be tranſported, from hotter Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tries:
Or laſtly, ſome peculiar
Expoſitions; which being yet too
cold, as, for inſtance, the North
Expoſitions, may be helped, as
much, as one pleaſes, by duly
inclining their Walls.</p>
            <p>As our Theory is not reſtrained
to Europe, nor to Countries on this
ſide the Equinoctial Line; ſo it is
not proper only to Men of great E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtates:
but whoever is able to have
a Wall, about his Garden, may,
in ſome proportion, injoy the Ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vantage,
that ariſes from it. 'Tis
true I have principally conſidered
<pb n="xvij" facs="tcp:49276:9"/>
how large Gardens, for Fruit,
might be made uſeful, handſome,
and ſtately. And this being the
hardeſt part, and including all
the Directions, neceſſary to thoſe,
that can be but at a ſmall Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pence,
what I had more to ſay, in
reference to them, was the leſs
conſiderable. No body therefore
ought to complain, that I forgot
his Caſe.</p>
            <p>It is not juſt that we ſhould lay
open thoſe rich Preſents, which
the Author of Nature offers us,
without expreſſing a due Senſe of
His Magnificence and Greatneſs.
Who can avoid admiring that
Supream and Infinite Wiſdom,
<pb n="xviij" facs="tcp:49276:10"/>
which makes every where ſuch an
immenſe variety, of moſt graceful
and excellent Productions, to co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver
the whole Face of the Earth,
and to ſpring out of the very
Ground? From thence it is that,
notwithſtanding their different
Proprieties, they all draw won<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derfully
their Life, and the Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit
that animates them; to the
Amazement of any, that conſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders
this ſurpriſing Operation.</p>

FRUIT-WALLS IMPROVED,
BY INCLINING THEM TO THE HORIZON:
OR A WAY
TO BUILD WALLS FOR FRUIT-TREES,
Whereby they may receive more Sun-ſhine and Heat than ordinary.</head>
            <p>
               <seg rend="decorInit">A</seg>FTER all the Application of ſo
many Men in all Times and
Countries to Agriculture, one
would ſcarce have thought there
was yet left ſo notable and ſo
very obvious an Improvement
of it as that I am a going to propoſe.<note place="margin">Idea of ſlo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ping Walls for Fruit.</note> It con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiſts
in building Walls for Fruits, Grapes &amp;c,
not in a perpendicular Situation, as is common<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
done, but ſo ſloping, thô otherwiſe ſtraight
and plane, as to receive the Beams of the Sun,
<pb n="2" facs="tcp:49276:19"/>
not only for a longer time, but alſo with a much
fuller and better Expoſition.</p>
            <p>It will appear that this way of building Fruit-Walls
will be very advantagious, if we compare
perpendicular Walls in ſeveral Countries and Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſitions
with one another, and with ſloping
Walls: examining withal ſome of their moſt
conſiderable Proprieties.</p>
            <p>South-Walls are commonly reckoned to be
the beſt for Fruits.<note place="margin">Defects of perpendicular South-walls.</note> But in theſe Climates, and
much more in hotter Countries, when the Days
are ſomething long, and the Heat of the Summer
is in its greateſt ſtrength, it is late before the Sun
ſhines upon them, and the Sun leaves them as
early in the Afternoon. When it is about Mid-day
the Sun is ſo high, that it ſhines but faintly
and very ſloping upon them; which makes
the Heat to be much the leſs; both becauſe a
ſmall quantity of Rays falls then upon theſe
Walls; and becauſe that very quantity acts with
a kind of glancing; and not with full force. Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
or after Noon the Rays come yet upon our
ordinary South-walls with more obliquity.<note place="margin">Perpendicu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lar South-walls, Eaſt-walls, and Weſt-walls compared to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether.</note>
            </p>
            <p>In the North part of <hi>France</hi> Eaſt Walls are
looked upon as almoſt of the ſame goodneſs for
Fruit as South-walls: which proceeds more from
the Defect I have noted in South-walls, than from
any particular Excellency in thoſe facing the Eaſt.
And accordingly South-walls are here, and in all
<pb n="3" facs="tcp:49276:19"/>
other cold Climates, much the beſt of the two.
Weſt-walls in <hi>France,</hi> as well as here, are but in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>different,
thô they have the like Expoſition to
the Sun as Eaſt-walls. I take the reaſon of
this difference between Eaſt-walls and Weſt-walls
to be partly becauſe in the Morning the Air is
purer, and that the Sun ſhines oftener and ſtrong<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er
than in the Afternoon; and meets with the
Dew while it is yet freſh upon Plants, whoſe mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
it revives after a long reſt, and as it were
a refreſhing Sleep. But the chief cauſe of it muſt
be attributed to the coldneſs of the Air in the
Morning, that checks the Vegetation, till the pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſence
of the Sun revives it; which it dos much
ſooner and much more effectually on the Eaſt-wall
than on the Weſterly. In the Afternoon
the Heat of the Air is great every where; and
Heat alone, without any Sun-ſhine, is able to
make Plants vegetate, thô not ſo perfectly.
Which, if it were not ſufficiently known, might
be eaſily evinced from what is obſerved in Sum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer
in the Fields, when the Sun happens not to be
ſeen for ſome Weeks together. I ſaid that the
Sun ſhines ſtronger in the Morning than in the
Afternoon, thô it be hotter in the Afternoon than
in the Morning. But this is not becauſe the Sun
in the Afternoon ſhines with more force; but be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe
it continues to act upon an Air already
warmed with the impreſſion of the Morning
<pb n="4" facs="tcp:49276:20"/>
Sun. In order to be ſatisfied in it, one may,
when the Days are long, compare nicely the
Effects of a burning Speculum at 5, 6 and 7 a
Clock in the Morning, with its Effects at 7, 6
and 5 in the Afternoon. For the like reaſon it
is much warmer a Month or two after than a
Month or two before the Summer Solſtice; thô
we cannot but ſuppoſe the Sun to ſhine ſenſibly
with the ſame force at equal diſtances from the
Tropick.</p>
            <p>Conceive a perpendicular Wall with Trees a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt
it.<note place="margin">Perpendicu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lar Walls compared with Sloping Walls.</note> It is evident that it is expoſed only to
one half of the viſible Sky. And the point to
which it is directly expoſed falls upon the Hori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zon.
To which point ſhould we ſuppoſe the Sun
to be ſomething near, one half of the time it
would be under the Horizon, and the other half it
would ſhine but weakly thrô ſo great a depth of
Air.</p>
            <p>But if we ſuppoſe the ſaid Wall remaining on
the ſame place to be inclined, with the Trees a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt
it, ſo as to become elevated only 45 De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>grees
upon the Horizon, and to have the Trees
on its upper ſide; the Wall in that ſituation will
be expoſed to three quarters of the viſible Sky:
and the point to which it is directly expoſed will
be 45 Degrees high. To all the Neigbourhood
of which place if the Sun happens to come, it muſt
needs act from thence upon the Wall with a con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiderable
<pb n="5" facs="tcp:49276:20"/>
force. And ſo far the advantage of ſlo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ping
Walls is already plain and obvious, without
any Calculation.</p>
            <p>Now if we proceed farther, and bring the
matter to a Calculation, according to ſome Prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciples,
which ſhall be explained in a proper place,
and which moſt Mathematicians will admit of;
we ſhall not only ſay that there is a great advan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tage
in ſloping Walls; but we may alſo ſhew
in Numbers, ſometimes exactly, ſometimes by
a near Computation, the Increaſe of Heat we ſhall
have, by uſing them rather than perpendicular
Walls.</p>
            <p>Thus,<note place="margin">The ſame done in a par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticular Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ample for the Equinox;</note> for Inſtance, if in the Latitude of 52½ De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>grees,
which is more Northerly by one Degree
than <hi>London,</hi> a South-wall, very ſmooth and e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven,
be ſo leaning as to have its Plane paſſing
thrô the Pole of the World; which ſloping for
many Fruits is not altogether the beſt that might
be aſſigned; the Action of the Sun upon it in an
Equinoctial Day will be to the Action of the
Sun in the ſame Day upon an ordinary upright
South-wall (ſuppoſing it alſo to be ſmooth and e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven)
as 100 to 63. And theſe Numbers we
can eaſily continue with exactneſs to many more
places at pleaſure. So then here the Heat of the
Sun is increaſed ſomething more than in the pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portion
of 3 to 2 (not to ſay of 11 to 7) above
what it is in the perpendicular Wall; which is very
<pb n="6" facs="tcp:49276:21"/>
conſiderable. But that Increaſe will be yet great<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er
and greater, as the Sun comes to have a greater
Northerly Declination.</p>
            <p>For in the Summer Solſtice the Action of the
Sun,<note place="margin">and for the Summer Sol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtice.</note> upon that even and ſmooth ſloping Wall, will
be increaſed ſo as to be upon one account more
than 3½ times greater than the Action upon the
perpendicular Wall. Beſides another very con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiderable
addition of Heat, which would make
that Action from 3½ to become 4½ times greater,
were it not that ſomething is to be ſubſtracted
from this laſt number, upon the account of the
Light of the Sun not coming ſo freely thrô a
greater depth of Air: which Correction has no
place in the Equinoctial Day. However we may
ſuppoſe the Heat, in the Summer Solſtice, to be
about fourfold what it would have been upon the
perpendicular Wall.</p>
            <p>This Increaſe of Heat is ſo extraordinary,<note place="margin">The reſult of which ſhews the great ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vantage of Sloping Walls.</note> and
for above two Months the Sun keeps ſo very near
the Tropick, <hi>viz.</hi> within a diſtance from it of
3½ Degrees, that ſeeing what our South-walls are
already able to do, I do not doubt but ſuch a
Wall as this would make Grapes, and Figs, and
other Fruits equal here in goodneſs to thoſe of
ſome much hotter Climates.</p>
            <p>Yet I confeſs this improvement for Fruit-Walls
is not like to be ſo uſeful here as in <hi>France,</hi>
               <note place="margin">What Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tries they are beſt for.</note> or
thoſe other Countries where they enjoy the ſight of

being had every where to the natural productions
of the place.<note place="margin">A good Cul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture is neceſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſary for them to have their full effect.</note> Nor do I look for any excellent
effect from it, unleſs the Trees or Grapes be rai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed
from the beſt Kinds, and the Soil be good
and deep, and the Trees and Vines be governed
and cultivated by a skilful Artiſt. It is too com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon
here to leave theſe Plants to themſelves, and in
a manner without any Culture. Whereas, beſides
the neceſſary care of Pruning them duly, they do
not think it too much, even in Latitudes where
they have not the ſame occaſion for thoſe foreign

do it at leaſt four or five times in a Year.</p>
            <p>Leſt thoſe that deſire good Fruits, and are no
proper Judges in an Inquiry that depends ſo much
on Geometry, ſhould look upon what I have
ſaid as a bare Speculation, I will make them ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quainted
with the following Story. By which
it will appear, that as we have already our Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flexions
and Calculations of our ſide, ſo we are
not altogether deſtitute of Experience.</p>
            <p>Having explained to a Perſon of Quality the
preſent Invention of Sloping Walls,<note place="margin">An Inſtance from Expe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rience of the uſefulneſs of Sloping Walls.</note> I received for
anſwer, that upon a Sloping Wall, which I ſaw
ſince, and I will deſcribe by and by, there grew
ſome Years ago Grapes equal in Goodneſs to
thoſe that grow in <hi>France.</hi> This Wall was no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing
but a facing of Bricks laid flat (and by
<pb n="8" facs="tcp:49276:22"/>
conſequence only two or three Inches thick) up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
a natural ſlope of Earth, about ſeven or eight
Foot high. It was of very many Years ſtanding,
yet extreamly ſound and intire; except in ſome
few places, where the Brick it ſelf was mouldered
away. It had been made only becauſe (being
very near and directly oppoſite to the Houſe) it
was thought to be handſomer than the naked
Earth. It made an Angle of about 60 De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>grees
with the Horizon; and was expoſed not di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rectly
to the South, but ſeveral Degrees Weſtward.
The Soil is not extraordinary. The Houſe was but
low, but it muſt needs ſhade that place a great
part of the Day. There has been added ſince
ſome pretty high Buildings to both ends of the
Houſe, which Buildings by their ſhade have in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tirely
ſpoiled the ſaid Vine, ſo that it has been
pulled up. I felt the Bricks of that Slope one Day,
when the Sun ſhone almoſt perpendicularly up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
them, and they were exceeding hot. But
thoſe Noble Perſons, to whom the Houſe be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>longed,
thought the goodneſs of the Grapes
might ariſe from the Soil; and forgetting the
Expoſition, they never tryed to recover their
loſs by another Sloping Wall, for which the
Ground would have afforded them abundance of
convenient places.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="9" facs="tcp:49276:22"/>
And thus we have not only a notable Experi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence
for us;<note place="margin">How Sloping Walls may be built with little charge:</note> but we ſee alſo how eaſily and how
cheap our Sloping Walls may be built, without
any danger of their tumbling down, as our Gar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>den-walls
are apt to do. But this being a very
material Point, and conſidering that moſt People
may think it either very chargeable, or very im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>practicable,
to build a Sloping Wall, let us a lit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle
inlarge upon it.</p>
            <p>I conceive then that the facing the Slope of Ter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>raſſe
Walks, either with a Brick-wall, ſuch as I
juſt now deſcribed, or elſe with a Wall twice, or
at moſt three or four times as thick is the beſt, ea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſieſt,
and handſomeſt way of building our Inclining
Walls. Whoſe name ought not therefore to
miſlead one ſo far, as to make him think, that we
would propoſe the building of a thick Wall ſlo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ping
and incompaſſed on both ſides with Air.
The thicker Walls are propereſt when they are
leſs ſloping: for ſo their ſtrength may better ſerve
to keep the Terraſſes from breaking out. It is
not required we ſhould lay the flat ſides of the
Bricks perpendicularly to the plane of our Wall:
but it will be more proper to lay them parallel to
it: So that each Bed or Floor of Bricks, of which
our Wall is compoſed, may be only two or
three Inches thick. And thus the Joynts of the
Bricks may be ſo diſpoſed as to leave no room for
Plants or Inſects to come out of the Ground.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="10" facs="tcp:49276:23"/>
After having explained a better way,<note place="margin">And how far the Roofs of Houſes might ſerve inſtead of Sloping Walls.</note> 'tis hard<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
worth our while to obſerve that the Roofs
of long and low Buildings in the Country, and
even the Roofs of Houſes in great Towns, might
alſo conveniently be made to ſerve for Sloping
Walls; eſpecially if ſome regard were had to it
in building. So, for inſtance, in the Country
the Roof of a long Building might on one ſide
be brought as low as the very Ground. And
thus Trees and Vines, eſpecially the laſt, might
be made to grow againſt the Roof, without ſpend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
their very ſtrength in growing up to an im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moderate
height. In Cities, where they uſe
ſometimes to make one Roof to ſerve many Hou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes
of one ſide the Street, one might, between
the Garret Windows, cut out in the Roof a re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctangular
Space, of the ſame height and breadth
with the Space the Windows take up; and from
within one might ſlide up to that Space a ſquare
Box full of Earth, of a fit Figure and bigneſs to
ſtand handſomly between the Windows. This
Box being ſupported at ſome height from the
Floor, one need not fear any inconveniency from
the Water's dropping out: which, in caſe it ſhould
do, might be received in ſome Veſſels. It is ſo
eaſie to prevent the Rain from running in, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween
the Roof and the Box, that it is to no
purpoſe to inlarge upon it. Out of theſe Boxes
one might raiſe ſome excellent Trees and Vines,
<pb n="11" facs="tcp:49276:23"/>
and ſpread them upon ſome Frames diſpoſed a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt
the Roof. And this, beſides the more ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtantial
Advantage of yielding a conſiderable
quantity of Fruit, would alſo prove a delightful
Ornament to that part of our Buildings, which
ſeems to want it moſt. However at <hi>London</hi> the
Smoak of Sea-coal is much to be feared; ſince
it both takes off the ſtrength of the Sun, and dos
ſettle upon Trees, where its great acrimony muſt
needs be unnatural and pernicious. But I muſt
give over and leave the Application of this Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrine
to every body's Induſtry.</p>
            <p>I need not mention that, in the making our
Bricks, ſome holes may be made in them to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive
Pegs of Wood to ſerve as neceſſity ſhall re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quire:

that ſuch Walls as theſe, having no Foun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dation,
leave in the Earth more room for the
Roots of our Trees; and are cheaper built and
leſs apt to fall. If they be not made both ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceeding

that they will compreſs ſo much the Ground un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der

as to the manner of building our Walls.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="12" facs="tcp:49276:24"/>
Let us now ſee, as far as we can, how we may
chuſe, in any Latitude, the propereſt Elevation for
our South Wall, and for the Fruit we deſign to raiſe.</p>
            <p>In order then to determine what Slope is beſt
to give,<note place="margin">Rule for de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>termining the quantity of the Incli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nation of Slo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ping South-Walls.</note> in cold and temperate Countries, to our
South-wall, I look for the Sun's Meridian Alti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tude
at leaſt ten Days, or a Fortnight, or three
Weeks, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> before the latter half of the Fruit of
the Kind I deſign to have uſes to be ripe: and
then I make the Complement of that Altitude,
to 90 Degrees, the meaſure of the Elevation of
the Wall above the Horizon. However I would
not be tyed by this Rule, but that I might alter,
upon the leaſt conſideration, the ſloping of the
Wall by ſeveral Degrees; eſpecially if one be a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fraid
of taking in too much Heat. And if the
Sun's Declination, belonging to the Meridian Al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>titude
found by the Rule aforeſaid, ſhould be o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>therwiſe,
I commonly reduce it ſo (in our Nor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thern
Climates) as to make it fall in the Space,
which is from the Equator to the Parallel that
goes thrô the <hi>16th</hi> or <hi>20th</hi> Degree of North
Latitude. The longer the Fruit is a growing
ripe, and alſo the more diſtance of time there is
between the firſt and the laſt ripe Fruit of the
ſame Tree, the more Days would I allow back<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards
in the finding the Sun's Meridian. Altitude,
and Declination: Indeavouring by this to make,
for the moſt part, the ſtrongeſt Heat of all to fall
<pb n="13" facs="tcp:49276:24"/>
ſomething before the middle of the ripening time.
For the Degree of Heat, that ariſes barely from
the Expoſition, is during many Days ſenſibly the
ſame, and as it were at a ſtay, when it is at the
greateſt. And we muſt, for the moſt part, indea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vour
that, when our Tree makes an end of yielding
its Fruit, eſpecially if this be about the latter end
of the Year, the Sun may already, by changing
its Declination, have been withdrawing it ſelf
ſome 5, or 10, or 15 Degrees from the Line
perpendicular to our inclined Plane. Thus all
the while the Fruit is growing ripe it will in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>joy
the greateſt Heat.</p>
            <p>But let us inquire more particularly after the
Limits of the Elevations of South-walls: ſo that
we may reſolve to keep them, in each Climate,
within the two Extreams we ſhall find.</p>
            <p>I ſhould not eaſily chuſe to make any where,
except perhaps in extraordinary high Grounds,
the South-wall more ſloping than an Elevation
of about 30 or 40 Degrees upon the Horizon
would make it to be. For, thô a great obliqui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty
of the Wall would not hinder. Vegetation, but
rather, for ought I know, forward it; yet, our ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perience
in this kind being ſo very narrow I can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not
know otherwiſe, than by gueſs, how the Eleva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions
of only 10 or 20 Degrees upon the Horizon
would agree with Plants. However ſuch ſmall
Elevations are not fit for South-walls, in theſe
<pb n="14" facs="tcp:49276:25"/>
Countries.<note place="margin">Of Sloping-Walls in ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry hot Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tries.</note> But, if there were any uſe for our
South-walls in the Torrid Zone, as there may
poſſibly be for thoſe Fruits, which, being peculiar
to that Climate, require alſo a great deal of Sun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhine
to bring them to perfection, eſpecially in
the higher Situations, upon ſome Hills or ſome
Mountains, I ſhould even there chuſe not to
give theſe Walls leſs than 40, or 45 Degrees
Elevation: which ſloping would perhaps give
but too much Heat. For there is ſome reaſon to
doubt whether it would not ſcorch any Plant
whatſoever, that is ſet, in theſe hot Countries, a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt
a Wall very much inclined. So I ſhould
leave the moſt ſloping South-walls for the Cli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mates
that have about 40, or 45 Degrees Lati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tude:
and not uſe them there neither, but upon
Mountains, or for the Plants of hotter Countries.
In <hi>Iſeland,</hi> which is placed under the Polar Cir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cle,
the inclined South-walls muſt make an
Angle of more than 46 Degrees, and leſs than
66½ Degrees with the Horizon. Generally, in all
the temperate Zone, I ſhould limit the Elevation
of the South-wall between 30 and 66 Degrees.
Theſe ſeveral Conſiderations muſt be duly weigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
together, as well as the tenderneſs of your
Plants, in order to chuſe a properer Elevation. But
a ſmall errour in this is not of great conſequence,
if you intend to raiſe all the Heat poſſible. For

The ſecond Column gives the greateſt, and
the third Column the leaſt Elevation of the
South Wall upon the Horizon. The fourth Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lumn
gives the ſame leaſt Elevation, with ſome
Corrections, that are not made in order to in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>creaſe
the Heat, but, at the expenſe of ſome Heat,
to give (in ſmaller Latitudes) more Elevation
to the Wall. The fifth Column gives only the
middle Numbers between thoſe of the ſecond

or another more than 10 Degrees. The Table
was made from this Rule, That the Elevation of
the South Wall, in temperate Countries, ought,
<pb n="16" facs="tcp:49276:26"/>
in order to make the moſt of the Sun's Heat,
neither to be more than the Height of the Pole,
nor leſs than the Height of the Pole wanting 20
Degrees.</p>
            <p>So then the ſecond and fourth Column may
pretty well ſerve, eſpecially in great Latitudes,
for Limits of the Elevations of our warmeſt
South Walls.<note place="margin">It is difficult to determine thoſe Limits in very hot Countries.</note> But the Elevations, for hotteſt
Countries, cannot be ſo well determined, till
Experience has taught what may and what may
not be done there. In thoſe hot Climates the Rule
I gave juſt now is of little or no uſe. For it
ſuppoſes that Fruits are ripe by the end of <hi>Octo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber,</hi>
or long before. But in the Torrid Zone we
may have Fruits all the Year round. In great
Latitudes the Sun in Autumn and Winter ſhines
ſeldom, and always thrô a great depth of Air;
which inclines one to neglect that inſignificant
Sun-ſhine, and to make the moſt of the Sun-ſhine
in the Spring and Summer; by keeping the South
Walls, as our Rule does, rather more ſloping than
they needed have been otherwiſe. But pretty
near the Equator the Sun comes every Day to a
conſiderable Height. And that invites one not
to neglect the Sun-ſhine ſo much during Autumn
and Winter, and by conſequence to make there
the Walls rather leſs ſloping. Which the ſcorch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
Heat requiring alſo, all theſe Reaſons ſeem
to prove that the South Walls muſt again grow
<pb n="17" facs="tcp:49276:26"/>
rather more upright, as one comes nearer the E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quator.
For let it ever be remembred to conſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der
whether the Climate, the height of the Situ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ation,
the Soil, the Expoſition, the Nature of
your Plants, and the Seaſon of their growing be
ſuch as to permit you to give your Sloping
Walls the moſt Heat you can procure.</p>
            <p>As to the Uſe of the Table,<note place="margin">The Uſe of the Table.</note> the Fruits that ri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pen

the greateſt Elevations; thoſe that ripen in

and ſuch as grow ripe in <hi>April, Auguſt,</hi> and <hi>Sep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tember,</hi>
require ſome middling ones. But if any
Fruit, ſuch as Peaſe &amp;c, are to grow ripe in
<hi>March,</hi> they require again the greateſt Elevati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons.
Now all this is ſaid upon ſuppoſition
that you are in no fear of procuring too much
Heat. And this is what we can at preſent de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>termine
about the Limits of the Elevations of
South Walls.</p>
            <p>Before we proceed farther,<note place="margin">Vines are commonly planted up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on a riſing Ground well expoſed.</note> ſhould not we re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>late,

of the Ground, conſonant to the Theory I have

the leſs charge will be required. In the making

Earth muſt be carefully gathered along the Ridge
of each Walk, there to receive and nouriſh the
Roots of our Trees. Neither is it neceſſary to
be very curious in keeping your Terraſſes, or
Sloping Grounds, ſtraight and parallel. But you
may follow the winding of the Hill, provided
it keeps within the extent of good Expoſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions:

one might have it at the top of all from ſome
rows of Trees.</p>
            <p>I will here add ſome Reflexions, I chuſe a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mong
a great many, by which we may farther
compare Inclined Walls with perpendicular ones.
For I ſhould ſwell this to an unreaſonable Bulk,
<pb n="21" facs="tcp:49276:28"/>
ſhould I ſpeak of all the Calculations I have
made relating to this matter.<note place="margin">A perpendi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cular Wall in no Countrey ſo hot as a Sloping Wall proper to the Place and Expoſition.</note> I ſhall only then
obſerve that, from the Equator to the very Pole,
that is in the whole Terreſtrial Globe, I find
not one Place, and not one Expoſition what<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſoever,
in which a perpendicular Wall is ſo hot
as a Wall ſloping to a proper Degree for the
Expoſition.<note place="margin">The North Expoſition is made tolera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble by a Slo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ping Wall.</note> And, whereas the North Expoſiti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
is utterly naught, in our ordinary manner
of building perpendicular Walls, if in the Lati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tude
of 51½ Degrees a North Wall be elevated
only 38½ Degrees upon the Horizon, it will in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>joy
the Sun, thô much ſloping, for every Minute it
can ſhine in the whole half Year, from the Spring
Equinox to the Autumn Equinox. But during
the two Months and three Days about the Sum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer
Solſtice it will injoy the Sun with an Eleva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion,
or Inclination, ever greater than of 20 De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>grees:
which gives more than the ninth part of
the full Action of the Sun. And for ought I ſee
that may be near as much as our ordinary
South Walls do then receive. This might ſerve
for the Summer Fruits that are ripe about the
end of <hi>July,</hi> and for raiſing of Peaſe, &amp;c.
For thô one would not chuſe to build ſuch a
Wall without ſome neceſſity, or ſome other con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiderable
advantage, yet having it at hand one
would not leave it without uſe. The North
Expoſition dos mend very faſt as the Countrey
<pb n="22" facs="tcp:49276:29"/>
lies more Southerly: And above all others it dos
require, in temperate Countries on this ſide the
Equator, Walls with a very ſmall Elevation,
ſuch as 25, or 30, or 35 Degrees. So then
we find that even the very worſt of perpen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dicular
Walls may become tolerably good, if
they be made ſloping.</p>
            <p>It will appear, by the ſequel of this Diſcourſe,
how many Advantages, beſides the bare Increaſe
of Heat, do follow our building of Sloping
Walls: But one of them lies already too obvi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous
not to be ſpoken of here.</p>
            <p>I ſay then that this Contrivance ſeems to be
of an extraordinary conſequence,<note place="margin">
                  <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>ſe of Slo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ping Walls for having Fruits, Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lons &amp;c, ear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly and tho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>roughly ripe.</note> for the raiſing
of all ſorts of Fruits ſomething earlier than
we uſe to have them, and for their perfect ripen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing:
And that it may prevent ſome of thoſe,
that are fond of Fruits, from falling into the
Diſeaſes that uſually follow the eating Fruit not
thoroughly ripe. I expect from theſe Walls
ſuch Melons, and Figs, and Grapes, as, I think,
have never been ſeen in this Country. I forbear
ſpeaking of other Fruits; but ſhall only ſay that,
if we had once ſome excellent Kinds of Trees rai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed
by this Method, we might not need to ſend
for new Graffs again to <hi>France.</hi> And if, the
Summer being extraordinary wet and cloudy,
our Sloping South Wall ſhould bring forth but
indifferent Fruits, yet even then thoſe Fruits will
<pb n="23" facs="tcp:49276:29"/>
be more tolerable than ſuch as we gather from
our ordinary Walls. But all this will become
more evident, when the Principles I build upon
ſhall be laid down.</p>
            <p>There is yet ſomething I have to ſay, both
in reference to the propereſt matter to build
our Walls withal, and to ſome other circum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtances
in the manner of building.</p>
            <p>As to the propereſt Matter for our Walls,<note place="margin">Walls of Bricks are beſt in <hi>En<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gland.</hi>
               </note> I
think Brick to be much better, in this Countrey,
than Stone: becauſe they grow hotter, and keep
much longer the Heat. By which means they
do ſtill warm the Plants a good while after the
Sun is hid under a Cloud, and, in a manner, loſt
to other Walls. I know nothing<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> that is more
convenient than they are, or of a better Shape for
our purpoſe. The biggeſt and thickeſt Bricks
will be beſt: And I ſhould chuſe, as I ſaid be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore,
to diſpoſe them ſo that they might appear
by their broadeſt ſides. Thus the Wall will be
cheaper, the Bricks will be apt to grow warmer,
and, their Interſtices being fewer and leſs deep,
there will be leſs room to take care of againſt In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſects
finding a ſhelter there.<note place="margin">Of Walls of Slate, or of any dark co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>loured Stone, whether na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tural or pain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted.</note> Walls of Slate, or of
any dark coloured Stone, whether natural or paint<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed,
will alſo be very good. For theſe Colours
imbibe the Light, or Heat, much more than
Colours that are whiter.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="24" facs="tcp:49276:30"/>
Our Walls ought not to have any Building
raiſed from the top of them;<note place="margin">Sloping Walls not to be clogged with any Shade, except perhaps in Winter, or when the Sun is very low.</note> nor any other
Shade caſt upon them in Vegetating time, by
the Interpoſition of any thing ſtanding, on ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
ſide of them, between them and the Sun.
But if they be deprived of the ſight of the
Sun, while it is only within a few Degrees from
the Horizon, the loſs is not conſiderable, and
abundantly made up, if, at the ſame time, they
be ſecured from Winds.</p>
            <p>The Foundation,<note place="margin">Sloping Walls may aſcend ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liquely upon a Hill; and the uſe of making them ſo.</note> or rather Bottom of Slo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ping
Walls needs not be horizontal; but it
may aſcend obliquely upon a Hill by ſome
Degrees. Which is of ſome conveniency for
the running off of the Water, and for the chu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing
a South Expoſition upon a Hill that looks
to the South-Eaſt, or South-Weſt, or to any o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
point, either between, or, at leaſt, not much
above 45 Degrees diſtance from theſe places. For
the moſt part of the Spring and Summer ſuch a
Wall will injoy as much Sun, as if the Founda<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
had been horizontal; but the Ground at
the Foot of it will injoy leſs. And this is
what I had further to mention as to the way of
building our Sloping Walls.</p>
            <p>I have ſeen,<note place="margin">Many Slopes in ſeveral Gardens are ready made, and fit for Sloping Walls.</note> in many Gardens, and other pla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces,
ſome Slopes of Earth ready made, and fit
every way for Trees to grow againſt them, if
they had been but faced with Bricks. But they
<pb n="25" facs="tcp:49276:30"/>
lay neglected, perhaps becauſe the good Uſe
that might be made of them was unknown.</p>
            <p>If any were apt yet to think that there can
be no great difference between two South Walls,<note place="margin">The goodneſs of a Wall proved ow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing in a great mea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure to the Expoſition.</note>
of which the one receives the Light of the Sun
much fuller and longer than the other; let
them conſider that, upon the very ſame Soil,
the South-ſide of a Wall is as good for Fruit
as the North-ſide is bad. That the Eaſt-ſide
of another Wall is very good, at leaſt in <hi>France,</hi>
and the Weſt-ſide but indifferent. Which di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſity
can certainly be attributed to nothing
but the Expoſition; and makes it more than
probable that by ſo much as this is mended,
by ſo much Fruits ought to be more perfect.</p>
            <p>I have given to this Theory ſome of the
Commendations it juſtly deſerves,<note place="margin">The Author's Deſign in commending this Theory.</note> knowing how
hard a matter it is to perſuade People to go out

to be much inferiour to ſome Meditations of a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nother

            <p>
               <pb n="26" facs="tcp:49276:31"/>
If the vegetation of Plants did only depend
upon the Sun-ſhine coming freely to them, there
would be but little occaſion left for any farther
Improvement.<note place="margin">The Advan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tage for Ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>getation of a cloſe and warm Air; and of ſmall and narrow Gardens.</note> But it is well known that a
warm and pretty cloſe Air, well ſheltered from
Winds, thô not ſo much expoſed to the Sun, in
a word, ſuch an Air as is found in the Gardens
at <hi>Paris,</hi> and other great Cities where they do
not burn Sea Coal, dos often bring forth better
Fruit than will be found in other places, in the
Neighbourhood, thô better expoſed. However,
at the ſame time that we get wholly the advan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tage
of Sloping Walls, we may alſo keep all
others, and ſecure thoſe Walls from cold and
dangerous Winds. This makes me recommend
Gardens of but an indifferent bigneſs, with
high Walls to them: being willing to pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chaſe
a cloſe Air with ſome little loſs of Sun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhine.
But if the Gardens be very narrow, as
I ſhould for the moſt part chuſe, the Walls may
be leſs high. The breadth of your Gardens ought
not be the ſame in all Expoſitions. And it is
of great conſequence that the length of very nar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>row
Gardens be from Eaſt to Weſt, and not
from North to South. In diſpoſing thus the
length of the Garden, the Wall may be from 8
or 10, to 15 Foot, or a little more, in the Slope:
the breadth of the Garden, or Earth, between
the Walls, from 11 or 12, to 50 or 100 Foot:
<pb n="27" facs="tcp:49276:31"/>
and the length as great as you pleaſe. But the
ſmalleſt Breadths are beſt: And thoſe, as I ſaid,
do not ſo much require high Walls: and by con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſequence
will not be ſo chargeable. In Gardens
that run from North to South, a very ſmall
Breadth will be as prejudicial as it is good in Gar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dens
that run from Eaſt to Weſt. For it is eaſie
to ſee that, in theſe laſt, the Shade of the long
Walls upon each other is but little, in vegetating
time; and falls either upon the ſhorteſt Days,
or upon ſuch Moments as the Sun is but low
and weak. But, in Gardens that run from North
to South, and are of the ſame breadth with the
former, the Shade is more conſiderable. <hi rend="margSglQuotes">And
I find that ſuch Gardens, having an Eaſt Wall
and a Weſt Wall, each with an Elevation of 30
Degrees, and each of 7 Foot in perpendicular
Height, muſt be 68 Foot wide, from Wall to
Wall, if you will that neither Wall ſhould take
from the other the ſight of the Sun, but when
it is leſs than 5 Degrees high.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Leſt any one ſhould wonder at this extraordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nary
narrowneſs, which dos often turn what we
called a Garden into a narrow Walk, I will
ſhew that I do not chuſe it without ſecuring that
great advantage of a warm and cloſe Air: In or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der
to which I give here the Section of a Walk,
or narrow Garden for Trees, whoſe length runs

Elevation of 45 Degrees. That Elevation is good
for thoſe Trees, whoſe lateſt Fruits are ripe near
the <hi>20th</hi> of <hi>September,</hi> 
               <hi rend="margSglQuotes">when the Sun is about 3
or 4 Degrees South Declination: at which time
the Sun is already withdrawn about 10 Degrees
from the perpendicular to the Wall AB.</hi> Let
the perpendicular Height BC of your Wall be
for Inſtance, of 7 or 10 Foot; <hi rend="margSglQuotes">which will give
9<g ref="char:decimalL">⌊</g>9, or 14<g ref="char:decimalL">⌊</g>1 Foot in the Slope AB, and 7 or
10 Foot in the horizontal Line AC.</hi> Let the
Line AD be in the Plane of the Equator: and
it will make here at <hi>London</hi> an Angle of 38½
Degrees with the horizontal Line AE. Make
the Breadth of your Walk the narroweſt you
can. Allow, for Inſtance, four Foot to the
Ground that is to receive the Trees, and to be
now and then cultivated: three Foot to the Walk
or Path; which ought, of right, to be dug up
every Winter: four Foot more to another Line
of cultivated Ground. So you will have 11
Foot for the whole Breadth of your Walk AE.
Draw from the top B of your Sloping Wall an
horizontal Line BDG. Draw alſo the Sloping
Line EG, repreſenting your North Wall, and
make it, if you pleaſe, parallel to the Plane of
the Equator; or rather, if you think fit, make
it yet more inclined to the Horizon, I mean
<pb n="29" facs="tcp:49276:32"/>
more approaching to it, by ſome 10 Degrees.
Make the tops of your Terraſſes GH, BI, of what
Breadth you pleaſe; ſuppoſe of 1, 2, or 3 Foot.
But they muſt be broader if you intend them
for Walks. Draw the new Slopes HK, IL, ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
parallel to BA, GE, or elſe with what al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teration
you think convenient. And ſo you have
two Terraſſes; to which you may, upon the
ſame Level, and at convenient Diſtances, add
as many more as you pleaſe. Now it is evi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent
that the Heat of the Sun, being at the
ſame time reflected, in the Spring and Summer,
by both the Walls, will warm extreamly the
Air ABGE; and, in all probability, give a much
cloſer Heat than is in great Cities: eſpecially if,
to break the Winds, you have, from diſtance
to diſtance, another Teraſſe running from North
to South,<note place="margin">and that they be not expo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed to Winds.</note> between thoſe I have deſcribed. Theſe
Terraſſes have a double advantage againſt Winds,
in that they receive them more ſloping, and alſo
reflect them upwards: So that the firſt Terraſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes
are a pretty good Shelter to defend the fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowing
ones. If the Ground be falling or hang<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
towards the South, the top GH might be
kept lower than the top BI; or the contrary
done if the falling be to the North and but
little. For I would chuſe, except in hot Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tries,
to avoid any other North Expoſition.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="30" facs="tcp:49276:33"/>
In caſe you ſhould deſire to make your Walls
higher, you might, for inſtance, increaſe by a
quarter the Lines in each of the Figures; or elſe
increaſe them in any other ſuch proportion; and
keep the ſame Inclinations as before. <hi rend="margSglQuotes">So you
might make AB of 13<g ref="char:decimalL">⌊</g>2 Foot, and AE of 14<g ref="char:decimalL">⌊</g>7
Foot; or elſe AB of 18<g ref="char:decimalL">⌊</g>8 Foot, and AE of 14<g ref="char:decimalL">⌊</g>7
or 20 Foot.</hi> Only the cultivated Ground
needs not exceed 5 or 6 Foot; and the Path
may be accordingly increaſed as it lights.</p>
            <p>On the other hand,<note place="margin">Terraſſes to be made high<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er when they are far aſun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der.</note> in caſe your Walk be
made a pretty deal wider, it would, at the ſame
time, be proper that your Sloping Walls ſhould
be made higher, thô in a leſs proportion than
the Walk is increaſed. And this is in order to
procure more cloſeneſs to your Air, and to
have both more Sun-ſhine and a better Shelter
againſt Winds. So, for inſtance, if you make
your Walk four times as broad as it was ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſed
in the ſecond and third Figures, and
your Wall higher only in the proportion of
4 to 3 than it was already, the Foot of your
Wall would not, after that change, loſe half
the Sun-ſhine it ſhould have loſt before. And
the Sun, of which it would be deprived, being
ever very low and oblique, it would yet a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mount
to much leſs as to the loſs of Heat: Eſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cially
almoſt all that loſs falling upon the
ſhorteſt Days, and coming to nothing near the
Equinox.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="31" facs="tcp:49276:33"/>
But thoſe extraordinary Banks would per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>haps
be more chargeable,<note place="margin">Roofs may be uſed inſtead of Terraſſes.</note> as they would alſo be
more laſting, than two bare Roofs, like thoſe of

uſe. The greater thoſe Banks or Roofs are, the
greater is the quantity of Rain brought to the
Foot of them; and the cloſer and ſtronger is
the Heat. Unleſs, for the conveniency of a Garden

whole Diſcourſe.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="32" facs="tcp:49276:34"/>
Let me firſt mention one very conſiderable
Objection,<note place="margin">Sloping South Walls expo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed to the miſchiefs of latter Froſts, unleſs pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vented.</note> againſt our Sloping South Walls, in
thoſe cold Countries, where the paſſage, from
cold to fair Weather, is not, as in <hi>Denmark,</hi>
quick and certain; but the Air is ſubject, as here,
to ſome returns of Froſt, after it has been fair for
a good while. And that is, that the Heat of
theſe Walls will probably make the Bloſſoms
of ſome Trees to come out too ſoon, and ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe
them to an evident danger of being ſpoiled
by the latter Froſts. To this Objection I have
little to ſay, but that it dos already grant a great
deal in favour of our Walls: and that we may
take our chance, as others do; there being but a
few Days more of danger, for our South Walls,
than for thoſe of other people; whoſe Bloſſoms
are like enough to be ſpoiled when ours are.
Let us alſo remember that, in thoſe Climates,
a kindly and natural forwardneſs, together with
a perfect maturity, owing not to our artificial
Fires, but to the light of the Sun, is hardly to
be had, but at the rate of running that hazard.
Let us then, as I ſaid, try our Fortune; and
in the mean while uſe,<note place="margin">Of Remedies againſt an early Vege<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation and Winds.</note> if we think fit, all the
Remedies Agriculture dos afford, to keep back
this early Vegetation, and to prevent the miſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chiefs
of Froſt: for which I refer you to the pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per
Authors.<note n="*" place="margin">
                  <hi>See La</hi> Quintinye.</note> However here is an eaſie Remedy
we may uſe, not only againſt this too great for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wardneſs,
but alſo againſt Winds.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="33" facs="tcp:49276:34"/>
Suppoſe we make but few parallel Terraſſes,
all of them running from Eaſt to Weſt, for in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtance,
but two, or four, &amp;c. Let, in the II Fi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gure,
AB repreſent the South Wall of the Nor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thermoſt
Terraſſe,<note place="margin">Fig. II.</note> and EG the North Wall of
the Southermoſt Terraſſe. Prolong upwards,
indefinitly, the Lines AB, EG, in M and N; and
prolong alſo the Horizontal Line EA Northwards
in O, and Southwards in P. You may fill all the
Angle MAO with Trees, and very tall and thick
Hedges &amp;c, without any injury to the South
Wall AB, and the Angle NEP, without any in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jury
to the North Wall GE. And yet both the
Walls AB and EG will, for ſix Months together,
enjoy the Sun-ſhine, for twelve Hours or more.
Now this Remedy is better againſt Winds, and
againſt the forwardneſs of bloſſoming, than a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt
the forwardneſs of Fruits; and, by con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſequence,
is ſo much more to be valued. Thus
ſeveral Ridings might be made in a large Foreſt;
provided the Ground were not already worn out;
or that it were put in heart again.</p>
            <p>Another Objection againſt our Sloping Walls,<note place="margin">Sloping Walls are expoſed to one ſort of white Froſts.</note>
is, that in the Spring, in ſome cold Mornings,
the Dew may ſometimes fall, in great plenty,
upon the Bloſſoms, and there freeze, as it falls;
which might endanger them, and blaſt all our
hopes. I confeſs, I do not know how far this
miſchief is to be feared. But this I may ſay,
<pb n="34" facs="tcp:49276:35"/>
that, in the coldeſt part of the Spring, the Sun
ſhines upon our Terraſſes, from the time it be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gins
to be ſome few degrees high; and, by con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſequence,
ſoon after the Dew is fallen. So that
there will be no time, at leaſt in fair Weather,
without which we have commonly no Dews,
for much harm to be done: Eſpecially the Va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pours,
or Steams, that ariſe from the Ground,
being more like to diſperſe in the Air, than to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>denſe
againſt our Trees; as I ſhall explain hereaf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter.
However this inconveniency being already
too much felt in ordinary Gardens, the Remedies
againſt it are found, and well known; at leaſt
by ſuch as raiſe ſome early and tender Plants, at
the latter end of Winter.</p>
            <p>Our Walls are alſo more expoſed to Storms,<note place="margin">They are much expo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed to Hail.</note>
and Hail, than ordinary Walls. Yet this ought
not to deter us. For we ſhall not have this
accident every Year, at ſuch times, when we
may fear it. And, if we ſhould have it, yet it
is to be ſuppoſed that many of our Fruits will
eſcape being ſpoiled. Neither is it impoſſible to
cover ſuch Trees, as are moſt precious, when
there is any proſpect of a Storm.</p>
            <p>I expect ſome will object alſo,<note place="margin">Of the Trees growing ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liquely to the Ground.</note> that, the natu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral
poſture of Trees being to grow upright,
their leaning againſt a Bank will be like to
diſagree with their Vegetation. But this Obje<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction
has not that ſtrength in it, which is in the
<pb n="35" facs="tcp:49276:35"/>
former; and might well have paſſed under ſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lence.
For it is a common thing, in our Gar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dens,
to force Trees into a Figure not at all
natural to them. And even Trees, that grow in
the open Air, have ſome of their Branches bend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
downwards; and moſt of them in a man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner
parallel to the Horizon. It was ordered
wiſely, for the beauty and ſtability of Trees,
but not for their fruitfulneſs, that they ſhould
naturally grow upright. Now theſe firſt con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiderations
ceaſing, in an Inclined Wall, I do not

            </p>
            <p>It has been twice objected to me that the
dampneſs of the Ground would probably ſpoil
the Fruits growing againſt our Sloping Walls.
Which makes me take notice of this Objection,
for otherwiſe I ſhould have neglected to give
it an anſwer. I ſay then that either this incon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venience
is not at all to be feared; or, if it be,
that the Remedies are obvious and eaſie. I do
not fear it in ſuch Terraſſes as thoſe of the II,
III, and <hi>XIth</hi> Figures; eſpecially when they are
well expoſed. For I cannot ſee what mighty
ſtore of Dampneſs can come, or be kept there;
ſince water naturally runs off of ſuch heaps. But
as to the lower Terraſſes of the firſt Figure, if
one or two beds of Bricks be not enough, at
leaſt three or four ſuch Beds, and what elſe one
<pb n="36" facs="tcp:49276:36"/>
pleaſes underneath, will be ſufficient to make the
Wall remain dry at the outſide. Moreover it
is not neceſſary that the Fruit ſhould touch the
very Wall. But in caſe it ſhould grow too
cloſe againſt it, a thin Slate, or a ſmall Ring,
of any proper matter and ſhape, will eaſily keep
it from the Terraſſe. After all I think Expe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rience,
to which I muſt appeal, will add no
ſtrength to this Objection.</p>
            <p>Some have urged,<note place="margin">Of their be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing expoſed to Mice and Ants, <hi>&amp;c.</hi>
               </note> againſt our Walls, that our
Fruit will be eaten up by Mice, or by Ants, &amp;c.
Thô I might ſay that all other Trees are ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſed
to this very miſchief; for 'tis known that
thoſe Mice and Ants can eaſily creep upon them,
yet to this, and all other Objections, I will give
but one general Anſwer.<note place="margin">Of all other Objections a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt them.</note> I ask whether the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>convenience
that is objected be real, neceſſary,
general, and unavoidable? or elſe whether it be
not, in a great meaſure, imaginary? I ask whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
there be no Remedy left againſt it to our
Care and Induſtry? I ask, when all is granted
to the Objection that can be given it, whether
there will be nothing at all left for us, but
Trees without Fruit? 'Tis true that I ought
by ſo much more to fear the reſort of Inſects
to our Fruits, as they are like to prove more
excellent than others are. But it is well for us
that the firſt Inventers and Improvers of Arts
have not at all been moved by ſuch Objections
<pb n="37" facs="tcp:49276:36"/>
as theſe. Are they greater than ſuch as may
be made againſt a Countrey-man, who would
ſow his Grounds? How is he ſecured againſt
the vexations of troubleſom Neighbours, a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt
the Invaſions of an Enemy, the miſchiefs of
Civil Wars, the unfaithfulneſs of Servants? How
can he depend upon fair and ſeaſonable Weather;
without too much Drought or Rain, without
Hail and Storms and ſtrong Winds? May not
his Seed be eaten up in the Fields; may not his
increaſe be ſtolen away from him; or deſtroyed
by numberleſs ſorts of Inſects? What ſhall I ſay
of the miſchiefs of Fire? What of Taxes and
Tithes? What of the price of Rents and Leaſes?
What of ſelling one's increaſe to ſuch as will not,
or cannot, pay their Debts? What of all other
fears and troubles that may come upon this poor
Countrey-man? Yet for all this our Fields are
ploughed, we are nouriſhed, and our Barns
are filled with Grain. Such is the Profuſion,
with which God Almighty provides for us,
that, after all deductions made, we have enough
to bleſs his Munificence, and to live with plen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty.</p>

great, to expreſs the whole Heat upon the Slo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ping

the middle Number between thoſe being 4<g ref="char:decimalL">⌊</g>02.</p>
            <p>This Method, which is clear and eaſie, is ſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficiently

greater, between the Heat for the Sloping

            <p>In the Latitude of 45 Degrees <hi rend="margDblQuotes">TL becomes

So the Heat is already 6¼ times greater for the

Addition of Heat MVI, which is very conſidera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble.
For the whole Space ITV is about 8½ times
bigger than MTL. The Middle between thoſe
two Numbers is 7⅜. On the Equinoctial Day
the Heat is exactly doubled. The immediate
Action of the Sun upon the Walls, without a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny
regard to the Heat reflected from the Ground,

not become equal for both the Perpendicular

            <p>By this it appears that our Walls are not

becauſe without them Fruits can hardly
be very good. In <hi>France</hi> &amp;c, they cannot fail
of producing moſt excellent Fruits, of the Kinds
that require a great deal of Heat, they being

of the Atmoſphere. The middle Number is
5⅕ or thereabouts. In the Equinox the Propor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion

               <hi rend="margSglQuotes">In the IX and X Figures AB is a ſtrong
Poſt faſtened upright in the Ground; whoſe
upper end B is ſhaped into an Hemiſphere,
or rather into a Part of a Sphere, yet ſomething
bigger. Upon B there reſts a ſtrong piece of
Oak, CC; in the middle of which there is a
concave Place, ſo made as to fit the Figure of
B, and to leave the liberty of turning and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clining
the Box ſeveral Degrees to and fro. The
concave Surface will be great enough, if it con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tains
the half of the Surface of an Hemiſphere.
D is the Box it ſelf; which is ſomewhat long,
and ſo ſhaped that the Sun may ſhine pretty
fully upon the foreſide of it. To the two ſides
<pb n="57" facs="tcp:49276:46"/>
of the Box, and to the Piece CC, are faſtened
two inclined Pieces of Timber EF, EF, almoſt
parallel to one another; and upon theſe, cloſe
by the Box, another pretty long horizontal
Piece of Timber GG. The remaining Pieces
GF, GF; GF, GF; FF; EG, EG; EE, are ſo diſpoſed as
to give much Strength to the whole Frame. Up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
the Part GFFG I place a Floor of Boards,
and the Piece GG jets out ſome two or four In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ches,
from that Floor. I uſe both the Piece
GG, and the Floor of Boards, for the Founda<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
of my inclined Brick Wall; to which I
give a thickneſs equal to once or twice the thick<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs
of a Brick, according to the Weight as I
deſire it ſhould have. Under the Box are yet
two ſtrong parallel Pieces of Timber HH, run<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning

made firm together, at both their Ends, by two

riſes ſeveral Pieces HK, HI; which being faſten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed

at or near the upper End of the Floor or Frame,
help to bear it up. In the Pieces HH there might
be ſome holes, at proper diſtances from each o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther,
for two Iron Pegs, one of each ſide the
Poſt AB, to keep, at your pleaſure, the whole

done more conveniently with Cords. For from

keep the whole Engine firm in any poſition.
In the making of it it muſt be ſo proportioned,
in all its Parts, that the Center of Gravity may
fall under B, but withal near it. And ſo it will
be proper that the Floor be not exactly flat,
but convex. The Addition of ſome movable

a kind of plain Border, with an Inclination to
the Floor, of about 45 Degrees every where:
which Border, by its Reflexion, would much
increaſe the Heat, and make it cloſer; giving

might perhaps be covered with Lead, either
painted dark or black, or not painted at all.
But I am apt to think it would give, in ſome

            <p>One advantage of Movable Walls is that
they may,<note place="margin">Advantage of mova<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble Walls a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt ſtorms and winds.</note> at any time, be turned from Storms,

They might beſides, when the Sun is ſtrong,
and the Fruit grown large, be ſometimes preſent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
ſide ways to the Sun, that it may ſhine fully

            <p>As to our former Sloping Walls,<note place="margin">Of the Rain falling upon Sloping Walls.</note> it remains
yet to order them ſo that we may not be trou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bled

the Grounds AMN, EPO pretty dry: and the
Path NO may be made falling, in order to
bring the Water to ſome Drains, where it may
be loſt. In an extraordinary wet Weather, one
might uſe ſome ſlight Boards, like QR, and
place them ſo, near the Foot of the Sloping
Wall, that they might receive the Rain at
their upper end, in order to convey it to the
bottom NO. For this purpoſe it is proper that
there be a very ſmall jetting out in the Wall,
to which the Boards may be cloſely applyed.
Or rather one might, at firſt, fix in the Wall a
long and narrow piece of beaten Lead, which
neceſſarily receiving the Rain, would eaſily
bring it to the upper Surface of the Boards, or
to ſome Gutters placed along the Wall, which
<pb n="61" facs="tcp:49276:48"/>
would be much convenienter than the Boards;
and would eaſily convey the Water to ſome o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
Gutters that ſhould make it fall upon the
Bottom NO. The Slope MN, receiving ſo
directly the Sun-ſhine upon it, will help ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry
much to heat the Ground NMA; and by
conſequence will, in ſome meaſure, forward
Vegetation. The Bottom NO, which is to ſerve
for a Path or Walk, muſt be raiſing near the

The two Terraſſes being farther from one ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther,

let the Section of our Walk, in the eleventh

You may remember how, ſpeaking to the
firſt Figure, I did chuſe, in the ſide of a nar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>row
Vale, a pretty ſteep Hill well expoſed;
which I did ſhape into ſeveral Terraſſes, one
above another.<note place="margin">Idea of a pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved ſloping Ground up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on a Hill, to be uſed in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtead of Ter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>raſſes with Sloping Walls.</note> I don't know but that, keep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
to the like Idea, it may ſucceed pretty well,
eſpecially about 45 Degrees Latitude, to chuſe
that Hill very ſteep, to take it almoſt as Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture
dos give it us, and to pave it all over
with Brick laid flat, except ſome Holes of an O<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>val
Figure, about ſix or ſeven Foot long, and
about four Foot broad. Theſe Holes are each
to receive at the Top of them a Tree, whoſe
Branches muſt be made to ſpread upon the pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving
of Bricks. The greateſt Diameter of the
Ovals ought to be horizontal. They muſt be
diſpoſed with as much regularity as poſſible.
They will look handſomer, and will be more
equally divided, and lie more convenient for
the ſpreading of the Tree, and to receive all the
Rain, if they be Checker-wiſe; as you ſee them
in the twelth Figure.<note place="margin">
                  <hi>Fig.</hi> XII.</note> But they will lie ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing
more conveniently to turn off the Rain,
if they be above one another. However it ſeems
there is no great danger to be feared, from too
much Rain, in a Hill ſo well expoſed to the
Sun; and where an extraordinary quantity of
Rain will not fail to find its way down, or
will ever be eaſily turned off. The uncover<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
<pb n="63" facs="tcp:49276:49"/>
Earth muſt be dug as often, as it is con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venient.
The Bricks will grow very hot, by

Depth about the Ovals. It is eaſie to or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der
it ſo that either all the Rain ſhall run into
the Ovals, or moſt of it run down at the ſides
of them, according as your Climate or the Sea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon
requires. As to the Charge, both in Bricks
and Mortar and Day-labour, it will come, for
each Tree, to much leſs than half the correſpon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent

they have have had no occaſion to think

that our Invention required but an ordinary Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pacity,
to light upon it; and even but an indiffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rent
Skill in Geometry, to examine and eſtabliſh
it upon its true Principles.</p>
            <p>I muſt here repeat again and again,<note place="margin">Caution a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt too much Heat Sloping Walls are like to pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cure.</note> that I have,
in this Diſcourſe, indeavoured to increaſe the
Sun's Heat to an extraordinary degree: and this,
I hope, I have found how to do effectually. But
it is eaſie in hot Climates, and in ſome light and
dry Grounds, and in the governing of tender
Plants, to err by an exceſs of Heat. If any
body ſhould fall into that Errour, it muſt be
by his own fault. He may take as much and
<pb n="71" facs="tcp:49276:53"/>
as little, as he pleaſes, of that degree of Heat,
which is to be had by our Sloping Walls. Thô
accommodating my ſelf to the Climate of <hi>En<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gland,</hi>
where too much Heat is hardly to be fear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed,
I may perhaps have ſometimes ſpoke, as if
one were always to take the moſt. However a
pretty good Remedy, againſt too much Heat,
is to keep conſtantly the Ground ſufficiently wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tered:
So that the Trees being conveniently full
of moiſture, their Fruits may be ſo much the
farther from being ſcorched and dryed up. And
here I may obſerve by the by, that if our Ter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>raſſes
be ſo broad as to have, at the top of them,
a little Rivulet, or Aqueduct, it will be very
eaſie from thence to water them on both ſides.
But this is perhaps above the Circumſtances of
an ordinary Gentleman's Eſtate. The ſame con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veniency
for watering would be found, in the
ſteep Hill of the twelfth Figure,<note place="margin">

you are unwilling to have all the Heat it dos
give, you may keep your Trees upon ſome

the rough Wall receives more Heat, while the

than the ſmooth Wall, when the Sun ſhines near
full upon both. For my part I think the

it ſeems to have more Heat in all, and looks
much neater, but becauſe it gives no ſhelter to

            <p>This comparing together of perpendicular and

            <p>In the Tract of this Diſcourſe,<note place="margin">Of ſome o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther Advan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tages of Slo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ping Walls:</note> I have, in ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veral
places, ſhewn ſome of the Advantages we
get by uſing Sloping inſtead of perpendicular
Walls. I will now run over ſome other Advan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tages,
that are yet untouched, or elſe not fully
treated of.</p>
            <p>Our Sloping Walls injoy much more the
benefit of the Dew and Rain's falling,<note place="margin">In reference to Dew and Rain; eſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cially as to the Eaſt Wall.</note> than
other Walls can do. And the Eaſt Sloping
Wall will not have, as the perpendicular, that
great fault of keeping the Rain from its Trees.
<pb n="87" facs="tcp:49276:61"/>
The conſequence of this will eaſily be perceived,
by thoſe that complain ſo much of the Drought
incident to their Eaſt Walls.</p>
            <p>It is a common fault,<note place="margin">In reference to Froſt occa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſioned by the Earths tran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpiring ſonte moiſture:</note> in all perpendicular
Walls, that the Ground being wet, and tran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpiring
much humidity, this will ſtick upon the
tender Bloſſoms, and in cold weather cover them
with Froſt, and deſtroy them. If our Sloping
Walls do not intirely prevent this, they cannot
but do it at leaſt in a great meaſure: the very
ſloping of the Tree turning it from thoſe Steams,
and giving room for them to diſſipate themſelves
in the Air.<note place="margin">Or by the cold Vapours in the Air dri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving with the Wind, and ſticking upon Trees.</note> In like manner our Terraſſes will
have an advantage in reference to Froſt, occa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſioned
by the cold Vapours in the Air driving
with the Wind and ſticking upon Trees. For
one Terraſſe dos defend, in a great meaſure, the
following Terraſſes againſt this Accident.</p>
            <p>By our Theory the Extent of thoſe Places,<note place="margin">The growing of Fruits ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tended to more Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tries and Places.</note>
where ſeveral Fruits do grow, will be much in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>larged.
And not only two Zones of ſome Miles,
or perhaps of ſome Degrees, round the whole
Earth, one of each ſide the Equator, will be
made able to produce, for inſtance, ſome good
Grapes, whereas they afforded before only ſome
bad or indifferent ones. But in Countries, where
Vines do grow plentifully, if you mark upon the
Hills, or Mountains, thoſe Limits, where Vines
do begin to be but bad or indifferent, even a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt

Walls built after the ordinary way; you
may often take in yet a great deal more of Ground,
with ſeveral Country Houſes and Towns in it,
and have there ſome excellent Vines, by the help
of Sloping Walls. What is here ſaid of Vines
is, in like manner, eaſily underſtood of other
Trees.</p>
            <p>So then whereas every Climate in <hi>Europe</hi> be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gins
to loſe ſome ſorts of Fruits, for want of
Heat and Time to ripen them; we may every
where open our Gardens to receive thoſe Fruits,
which hitherto we have been unable to have,
thô our near Neighbours Southwards did raiſe
them, with no extraordinary trouble.</p>
            <p>And not only the Places for the growing of
Fruits are inlarged,<note place="margin">And the time of their Ripeneſs, and uſe for Men, to more Days in the Year.</note> but ſo are the Times alſo, in
which we may injoy them. This advantage a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riſing

than we could have them otherwiſe.<note place="margin">Ordinary Walls com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pared among themſelves, and with Slo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ping Walls, as to the for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wardneſs of their Fruits.</note> For ſince at
<hi>Paris</hi> the Fruits of good Eſpaliers are ſomething
ſooner ripe, than thoſe of Standard Trees; and
theſe laſt are ſooner ripe, than thoſe of Dwarf
Trees: And, among the Eſpaliers, thoſe of the
South and of the Eaſt begin to give ſome ripe
Fruits about eight or ten Days ſooner than thoſe
of the Weſt, and about, at leaſt, fifteen or twen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty
Days ſooner than thoſe of the North; is it
not eaſie, from thence, to conclude that our
<pb n="89" facs="tcp:49276:62"/>
Sloping South Walls and Eaſt Walls will give
their Fruits conſiderably ſooner, than ordinary
Walls can do?</p>
            <p>The Certainty of our latter Fruits coming to

            <p>Walls may not only be ſo expoſed,<note place="margin">Slopes of Earth for ſmaller Plants.</note> and ſo
inclined, as to make ſeveral ſorts of Trees, grow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing

Ground it ſelf may be ſo ſhaped, into Slopes
and Terraſſes, as to bring early ſome of the ſmall<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eſt
ſorts of Plants, as Strawberries, Sallets &amp;c.
And as for ſuch Plants,<note place="margin">Of the divi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding a main Slope into many ſmall ones.</note> as caſt a pretty deal of

                  <hi>Fig.</hi> XV.</note> as you ſee in the fifteenth Figure.</p>
            <p>In the like manner we might eaſily ſo ſhape
the large Furrows of our Fields,<note place="margin">Of ſhaping the Level or ordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nary Ground, into very large Furrows running Eaſt and Weſt, with a gentle Slope South<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards, and a ſteep one North<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards, or contra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rywiſe; in order to increaſe or di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miniſh a little the Sun's Heat.</note> or the Surface
of our other Grounds, as to have them expo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed
to the Sun, with the ſame Obliquity, as
the level Ground of any Country, not above
10 or 15 Degrees more to the South, or North,
than we are our ſelves. For inſtance, in the
Latitude of <hi>London,</hi>
               <note place="margin">
                  <hi>Fig.</hi> XVIII.</note> the Ground will have the
<pb n="90" facs="tcp:49276:63"/>
ſame Expoſition to the Sun, as the level Ground,
in the Latitude of 45 Degrees, if going from
South to North, you make, ſuppoſe for five
Yards together, your Ground to riſe by an An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gle
of 6½ Degrees, in a Slope expoſed exactly to
the South; and then you make your Ground to
fall as much towards the North, by a Slope as ſteep
as it can conveniently be, ſuppoſe of 35 or 40
Degrees: and then you begin again another long
and gentle Slope towards the South, for five
Yards together, to be followed as before, by a
ſhort and ſteeper Slope towards the North; and
ſo on. See the eighteenth Figure. Thô we do
not, by this, give the ſame Weather, or Heat, to
the Climate, nor the ſame Strength, or Weak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs,
to the Sun, as there is in a Country, where
its Rays do not paſs thrô ſo much or ſo little
Air; yet at firſt ſight it ſeems to be of ſome
conſequence for Agriculture, both in cold and in
hot Countries; and I could not forbear pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſing
it to the conſideration of the Curious.
If, in our Example, we do not get that degree
of Heat, they have naturally in the Latitude of
45, ſuppoſing both Countries equally cloudy;
yet, with the very Numbers I gave, we may
poſſibly reach, upon our Ground, the Heat,
which they have in 48 Degrees Latitude; and
we may yet come nearer the Heat, which the
Ground has in the Latitude of 45, if we
make our Slope, that looks to the South, a
<pb n="91" facs="tcp:49276:63"/>
little ſteeper; raiſing it, for inſtance, 10 or 12
Degrees above the Horizon. There is ſome
Ground loſt here, thô not very much. As to
the Trouble it is not greater than we ſee Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trey-men
take, to make the Water to run off
their Fields. And we have this conveniency, that
we may give our Slopes only what Breadth we
pleaſe; ſuppoſe as much as will reſult from the
ſtrength of a Man to throw, with a Shovel, the
Earth from him. But the broadeſt Slopes are
beſt.</p>
            <p>Thus we may help and increaſe a little,<note place="margin">Application of this Pra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctice to <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>ſe.</note> by
the ſhape of our Ground, the Heat of the Sun;
or elſe we may abate a little from it. And by
conſequence we may fit our Lands the better, to
bear any Plants we have a mind to raiſe. This
may ſerve to guide ſuch as would plant ſome Vines
in their Country, whether it be naturally a little
too hot or too cold. For it will either lead them,
as daily Experience dos others, to chuſe a Ground
fitly expoſed and inclined for their purpoſe: or
elſe, if their Ground be not proper, it will let
them ſee a poſſibility and a Method, with a lit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle
trouble, to make it ſo.</p>
            <p>Every body knows what great difference of
Heat and Vegetation there is,<note place="margin">Of the dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ference of Heat, upon the North and South ſide of Moun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tains, Hills and Downs.</note> in the ſame Cli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mate,
between the North and South ſide of great
Mountains; and the like is, in ſome meaſure, ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerved,
at much ſmaller diſtances, in our Hills.
I remember that travelling once in <hi>England,</hi> in
<pb n="92" facs="tcp:49276:64"/>
Summer, over ſome Downs, which had but an or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinary
Declivity, one could plainly perceive, by turns
that the Air became of a ſuddain much warmer,
when the Declivity was towards the Sun; and
colder, when it lay from it. Yet the Sun be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
high then did ſhine upon the whole Ground.
In any Shade,<note place="margin">The Heat of the Air in a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny place dos not very ea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſily ſpread into the next Air.</note> and even in our Woods, thô the
communication be ſo open with the very next
Air, warmed immediately by the Sun, and its
Rays are let in at ſeveral places, yet the cool<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs
is very ſenſible; the Heat ſpreading from
the ambient Air, with leſs eaſe, than one is apt
to think. Theſe conſiderations incline me to be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve
that, by this ſhaping the Ground, there
may be ſomething done for the benefit of ſmaller
Plants, eſpecially in a cloſe place, or calm wea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther,
when the reflected Heat may not be blown
away from the Ground that reflects it. For it
ſeems each Surface of Ground makes then, cloſe
about it, as it were a peculiar Climate.</p>
            <p>And this is farther confirmed,<note place="margin">Nor the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flected Heat ſpend it ſelf ſo faſt, but that it may be ſtrongly felt.</note> by the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon
Experiment we have, how much hotter it
is, in Summer, near a South Wall, or a row of
Houſes, that look to the South, when the Sun
ſhines full againſt them, than in any other place,
where the Light of the Sun comes with the ſame
Liberty. For it is plain the reflected Heat, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
thus perpetually ſupplied from the Sun, dos
not ſo much ſpend it ſelf, into the open Air,
<pb n="93" facs="tcp:49276:64"/>
but that it may be ſtrongly felt, at ſome di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtance,
all along the place that reflects it.</p>
            <p>I cannot here but mention what I heard a
learned Gentleman ſay, who has been in the
<hi>Weſt-Indies.</hi> He aſſured that upon their Moun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tains,
according as one goes up higher and high<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er,
and the Heat dos become leſs, one finds, by
degrees, very many of our European Plants na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turally
growing; the Mountains always giving
them, in ſome peculiar places, as it were different
Climates, fitted to their ſeveral Natures. So then,
as the Diminution of Heat makes the Ground
naturally to bring forth the Plants of colder
Countries: ſo, on the other ſide, the Increaſe of
Heat, which in a great meaſure lyes in our pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er,
muſt needs fit our Grounds, and Gardens,
for an eaſie and natural Production of the Plants
of ſuch Countries, as are hotter, only to a cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain
degree, than ours.</p>
            <p>The uſe of Sloping Grounds, for ſmaller Plants,
is pretty well known already; eſpecially beyond
Sea. And as for theſe Climates, not to men<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion

               <note place="margin">An Account of a Slope where extra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ordinary Strawberries are ſaid to grow.</note> I have

It happens pretty often that the Sun dos
ſhine only ſome part of the Day;<note place="margin">Advantage of Sloping Walls, in ſuch Days as the Sun is ſeen for ſome Hours only.</note> which

&amp;c: If it be the beſt perpendicular Wall, in your
Climate, you may make ſeveral other Expoſitions
not to be inferiour to it, by inclining the Walls,
as much as is neceſſary. And further, ſuppoſe
Experience has taught, in your Country and
Situation, the beſt Eaſt-South-Eaſt Wall, for in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtance,
to be, for ſuch a kind of Fruits, that, which
is elevated 75 Degrees upon the Horizon; you
<pb n="95" facs="tcp:49276:65"/>
may give ſuch an Elevation to another Wall, in
another given Expoſition, as will receive an equal
Degree of Heat with the former.</p>
            <p>Very few Grounds have ſo much good Earth,<note place="margin">Advantage of Terraſſes with Sloping Walls, in re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ference to a ſufficient quantity of good Earth, which is eaſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly procured.</note>
as is neceſſary for Fruit Gardens. The charge of
bringing ſome, from another Place, is very great:
And, unleſs one fetches it from far, there will
probably be, too near the Garden and the Houſe,
ſome large unſightly place left in a manner bar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ren
and deſolate. Neither is it practicable to
take away the good Earth, from ſome Parts of
your Garden, to bring it to ſome other Parts;
except as far as your Alleys, and ſuch other
Places, will give leave. But, in a Garden for
Fruit, made as I ſhall preſently deſcribe, one may
find, upon the Spot, ſo much good Earth, as
will much more than double the natural Depth,
there was of it before; thô you ſhould plant
your Lines of Wall Trees, in the middle of a
plat of good Ground, eight or nine Foot wide.
And all this may be done, without altering at
all the Beauty or Symmetry, of your Diſpoſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion.</p>
            <p>The ſixteenth Figure is the Ground Plat of
a Garden for Trees,<note place="margin">
                  <hi>Fig.</hi> XVI.</note> made up into Terraſſes.
It is an exact Square of 470 Foot on each ſide:<note place="margin">Deſcription of a Garden for Fruit, ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to the preſent The<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ory.</note>
that Figure not being ſo offenſive, in our Diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſition,
as it is in that which is common. If
you would have a bigger Garden you may keep
<pb n="96" facs="tcp:49276:66"/>
the ſame Breadth, and add two, or four, or
ſix, or eight Terraſſes more &amp;c, and order it
ſo that the Door may ſtill remain in the mid<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dle.
If you deſign to have a ſmaller Garden,
you may make the Length of your Terraſſes
leſs, by 50, or 100, or 150 Foot. And if
you would have it ſmaller yet, you may, inſtead
of ten Terraſſes,<note place="margin">The <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>ſe of making the outſide Wall thicker at bot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tom than at top.</note> make only eight, or ſix, &amp;c. The
outſide Wall is about 10 Foot high; and broad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er
at bottom, than at top. The Breadth at
bottom is 3 or 4 Foot. The Breadth at top
might be made of 8 Inches; and it would be
better yet, if the Wall ended there into a ſharp
Edge. The ſides of the Wall are plane; and ſo
they muſt needs be ſomewhat Sloping. Thô
this may perhaps ſeem to be of little conſequence,
yet I do not doubt but it will be a conſiderable
advantage for this Wall, to injoy thus the Sun,
near the Solſtice, for about half an hour, or an
hour, longer of each ſide, than it could other<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe;
and at the ſame time to injoy it more
fully. To which advantage there muſt alſo be
added that of a greater Solidity; which will
make the Wall to be more laſting, and ſeldom
to want any Reparations. On the inſide of this
Wall is a Line of four or five Foot of cultiva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted
Ground;<note place="margin">A kind of Chanel, or Ditch, to keep the Gar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>den from too much Water.</note> then an Alley round the Garden,
and a Chanel, or deep Trench, that may ſerve
for a Drain to the Garden. I did ſuppoſe in
<pb n="97" facs="tcp:49276:66"/>
the Figure that this Canal was faced on each ſide,
with a competent perpendicular Brick Wall. But
it ſhould always have ſome Water, whoſe Sur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>face
ought to be about three or four Foot lower
than the Level of the little Walks. One or two
of thoſe little Wind Mills, that turn alone to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards
the Wind, and are ſo common in the
Fields in <hi>Holland,</hi> might ſerve to empty this
Ditch, leſt it ſhould grow too full; and, if one
would, they might alſo ſerve to diſtribute the Wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
of it to any other place, or to the Alleys, in or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der
to water the Trees. Thoſe Wind Mills might
be placed either within or without the Garden;
as you think it moſt convenient. The Breadth
of the Canal muſt be conſiderable, if you de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſign
it for ſtate and ornament; but it may be
little, if you deſign it chiefly for uſe. Unleſs
the neceſſity of having ſome Earth from thence,
for the Terraſſes, makes you to chuſe a large
Canal. Under the Middle of the Alleys, a croſs
the whole Garden, ſhould be as it were a Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon-ſhore,
to receive all the ſuperfluous Water
of the Alleys, and to carry it into the Ditch.
And, if one ſuch Common-ſhore was not ſuffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cient,
one might have two placed at equal di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtances,
from the Middle of the Alleys; ſo as to
leave between them about half the length of the
Alleys, or very little more. After the Ditch
comes a little Path, and a Line of cultivated
<pb n="98" facs="tcp:49276:67"/>
Ground. Then the Slope of the main Terraſſe
round the Garden. Then an Alley at the top
of it. Then the inner Slope of the main Terraſſe.
The reſt are the leſſer Terraſſes, with their re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpective
Slopes on each ſide; their Thickneſſes
at top; the cultivated Grounds at the foot of
them, and the little Walks between. The Door,
and Bridge, and main Staires, to get up the main
Terraſſe, and leſſer Staires, to go down from it
into the Alleys, are eaſily perceived in the Fi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gure;
whoſe particular meaſures are as follows
hereafter.<note place="margin">Meaſures of the Slopes, which are reſpectively made equal. But being made diffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rent they may be better fit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted for ſeve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral Fruits.</note> Thô the Sloping, in all the little
Terraſſes, have been made the ſame, and ſuch
as are propereſt for latter Fruits, yet it would be
more convenient to have them ſomething diffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rent.
The perpendicular Height of the Terraſſes
is 8 Foot. The Slopes that look to the South
are elevated 51 Degrees 30 Minutes, above the
Horizon. Thoſe that look to the Eaſt 45 De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>grees.
Thoſe that look to the Weſt 35 Degrees
22 Minutes. And thoſe that look to the North
28 Degrees 53 Minutes. The Height of the
South Walls taken along the Slope is 10 Foot
2¾ Inches. That of the Eaſt Walls 11 Foot 3¾
Inches. That of the Weſt Walls 13 Foot 10
Inches. And that of the North Walls 16 Foot
6¾ Inches. The Baſes of the Slopes that look
to the South, to the Eaſt, to the Weſt, and to
the North have in Breath 6 Foot 4⅓ Inches, 8
<pb n="99" facs="tcp:49276:67"/>
Foot, 11 Foot 3¼ Inches, and 14 Foot 6 Inches.
The Door is towards the Eaſt.</p>

The total Sum of Trees is 1595.<note place="margin">3½ Vines to be ſubſtituted for one Tree.</note> And for
one Tree, that takes up 8 Foot Space, you may

               </gap> Vines. But if the
Ground be very good the Number of Trees will
be leſs.</p>
            <p>So then our Garden might hold 1300 ordinary
Trees,<note place="margin">General Sum of ordinary Trees and Vines in the Garden.</note> and 1000 ordinary Vines; or 1400 ordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nary
Trees, and 680 ordinary Vines. And from
thence muſt be eſtimated the Number of its Fruits.</p>
            <p>But it would be very unwiſe to make ſuch
high Terraſſes,<note place="margin">Of Terraſſes for Vines on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly.</note> to ſerve for Vines only. For
that Plant being of ſuch a Nature,<note place="margin">Vines ought to be kept ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry low.</note> as not to do
well in theſe Countries, if it be ſuffered, as it is
too often done, to ſpend its ſtrength in nouriſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing

Directions, that adviſe us to keep it ſo low,<note place="margin">La Quinti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nye.</note> as
to give, for inſtance, to Muſcat only the Height
from three Foot to five. A Terraſſe for Vines
would then be great enough, unleſs I miſtake in
drawing this concluſion, if it was but half as high
as thoſe I have deſcribed. Neither would it be
neceſſary to allow more than half the Breadth,
we did give to our Alleys, or very little beſides.
And ſince this great narrowneſs might prove trou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bleſome,
becauſe of the Rain, I would in build<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
the Terraſſes ſpare, within, and at a good
Depth under each of them, a little paved Ditch,
to carry off the Rain at both Ends, and to keep
the Alleys clear of too much Water. The ſame
<pb n="108" facs="tcp:49276:72"/>
might alſo be conveniently done, in building any
Terraſſes, thô never ſo big.</p>
            <p>But,<note place="margin">Of a large Terraſſe par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted into two for Vines.</note> if you think it too improper, to have
in one Garden a mixture of large and ſmall Ter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>raſſes,
you might cut one great Terraſſe ſo, as
to afford, in the middle of its Height, a Step
for another row of Vines; as you ſee in the
ſeventeenth Figure.<note place="margin">
                  <hi>Fig.</hi> XVII.</note> I ſhould however, upon
many other Accounts, and alſo for fear of the
Vines of the lower part of the Terraſſe intangling
with thoſe of the upper part, rather chuſe to have
a whole Garden for Vines, excepting only the
bad Walls in it: And ſuch might be, after ſome

the outſide to be only of 240, or 300 Foot.</p>
            <p>Now,<note place="margin">The Garden will not hold ſo many Trees, as it would, if they were to keep within the ordinary Size.</note> as I did already intimate once before,
our Garden will probably not hold ſo many
Trees, as are ſet down in the laſt Table. For
there being more room with our Walls, than
with the ordinary ones, for the ſpreading and
growing of the Roots round about, they will
make their Trees undoubtedly to grow bigger,<note place="margin">The Trees in it will grow very large and why:</note>
and larger every way. The beſt Fault, in de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>termining
the Diſtances, between the Trees, is
to make them too big at firſt;<note place="margin">And muſt be far aſunder:</note> for fear of the
Confuſion, and want of Fruitfulneſs, that at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tends
thoſe Diſtances, when they are made too
ſmall. However in this we find a new ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vantage
of our Gardens; ſince a ſmaller Num<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber
<pb n="109" facs="tcp:49276:72"/>
of Trees will garniſh the ſame Extent of
Walls,<note place="margin">Yet will not yield a leſs Crop of Fruits.</note> and give no fewer Fruits, than a great<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er

lies in gueſſing at the Diſtances we muſt chuſe.<note place="margin">A gueſs at their Diſtan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces.</note>
For my part I would, for the firſt Tryal, if the

as the Diſtances,<note place="margin">

big Trees and little Trees together;
unleſs the Wall were, at leaſt, twelve Foot

            <p>We muſt take notice here that the <hi>Paris</hi> Foot,<note place="margin">Proportion of the <hi>London</hi> Foot to that of <hi>Paris.</hi>

            <p>I have drawn,<note place="margin">A Draught of the Gar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>den in Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpective.</note> with a great deal of care, ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording
to the Rules of Perſpective, in a large
Print by it ſelf, the Elevation of the South-Weſt
Corner of our Garden.<note place="margin">Pag. 1.</note> Any body may judge,
by the effect of this Figure, particularly with hi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding
the lower part, whether Sloping Walls and
Sloping Trees will be much offenſive to the
Eye. For my part I think it may be a queſtion
whether an ordinary Fruit-Garden, with perpen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dicular
Walls, can ever be made to look ſo plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſant,
<pb n="110" facs="tcp:49276:73"/>
and ſo full of a regular and ſtately variety,
as I find the Figure to be. That ſtatelineſs is
altogether owing to thoſe great and maſſy Ter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>raſſes,
which, in our Draught, overrule, as it
were, and maſter the whole; and have an
effect like to that of very large Columns, in
our Buildings. They have beſides, from ſo
many Trees ſet againſt them, in a regular or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der,
that Airineſs and Gayity, which ariſe in our
Architecture, from abundance of proper Orna<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments.
The Canal is made broader than ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording
to the meaſures of the Ground Plat. It
will not only be nobler, if it be very broad;
but, if you have no natural riſing, in the midſt
of your Ground, it may yield alſo the Earth ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſary
for the Terraſſes, without ſinking the
level of the Garden. The Figure will help to
conceive how ſome Roofs might be uſed, inſtead
of Terraſſes.</p>
            <p>If the Garden be very large,<note place="margin">Diviſion of a large Gar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>den, by ſome Canals, into four or ſix<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teen little Gardens, or any other Number.</note> and you are at a
loſs where to have all the Earth, that would be
required; even thô you ſhould pretty much in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>creaſe
the breadth of your Canal; keep the out<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ermoſt
ſquare Terraſſe untouched; and in the
middle of your Ground Plat, draw, from ſide
to ſide, a large Canal, like a Croſs, ending
at the four ends perpendicularly againſt the main
Terraſſe.<note place="margin">This will yield the Earth neceſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſary for the Ter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>raſſes.</note> This new Canal will give the Earth
you want: And each of the four Diviſions of
<pb n="111" facs="tcp:49276:73"/>
the Garden muſt be finiſhed by it ſelf, according
to the Idea I have followed, in the ſixteenth Fi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gure.
Only the new Terraſſes, that go round
the inner half of the four Diviſions of the Gar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>den,
and make up the Banks of the new Canal,
ſhould not be ſo large, as the main Terraſſe.</p>
            <p>After the ſame way, if the Extent of the Ground
was extraordinary great, and there was yet ſome
Earth wanting one might again, by four new
Canals like a Croſs, ſubdivide each of the four
laſt Diviſions: which would give ſixteen ſmall
Gardens in all.<note place="margin">And either give diffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rent Ponds for ſeveral ſorts of Fiſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>es: Or elſe open the Way, by Boats, a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mong the Gardens:</note> If theſe Canals be deſigned for
ſeveral Ponds, where you may keep different
ſorts of Fiſhes, they need not have any commu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nication
one with another. But if you would
have the liberty of going every where, with Boats,
among the Gardens, it will be ſufficient, if all
the Canals be opened, and continued into one
another, along that Branch of the main Croſs,
which the Bridge dos come up to: excepting
only that part of the main Terraſſe, the Bridge
ends againſt.<note place="margin">Aud leave alſo a Foot Way into them all.</note> Thus you might go, at your plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure,
either with a Boat, or walking, to any one
particular Garden. As the outer Terraſſes are
made leſs and leſs, according as their Length de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>creaſes,
ſo ſhould alſo the Canals be made leſs
and leſs broad. Now, by ſuch Canals, your
Garden might be divided, not only into four
or ſixteen ſmaller Gardens, but into any other
Number.</p>

Thô ſuch large and magnificent Gardens can
only be the Work of Princes,<note place="margin">Any ordina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry Gentle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man may have a few Terraſſes, or Slopes, well expoſed.</note> and other Great
Men, or of powerful Societies; yet there is no
ordinary Gentleman, that is able to have a Gar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>den,
but may, according to his ability, and the
Directions I have given in other places of this
Diſcourſe, have one or more Terraſſes, or Slopes,
well expoſed, of what length he can afford:
So that he may have, againſt them, a com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>petent
number of Vines, and other Trees. And
whereas they ſay now, for inſtance, I have got fifty
Yards of very good Wall; they may ſay here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>after,
to a greater commendation of their Gar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dens,
I have raiſed 30 or 40 Yards of a Sloping
South Wall.</p>
            <p>It may happen that,<note place="margin">A Tryal of Sloping Walls not to be depended upon, unleſs made by a very good Artiſt.</note> upon ſome Tryals made
by an unskilful Artiſt, our Walls may ſeem not
to be of any uſe, for the Production of good
Fruits. But ordinary Agriculture dos not now
thrive equally, in everybody's hands. And whilſt
a diligent and underſtanding Country Man is
largely repaid for his Care and Induſtry, the
unskilful often ſees himſelf deceived in his hopes.
There will ever be a juſt diſtinction, between
thoſe that act by the certain Principles of an Art
grounded upon Nature, and ſuch as act in a
great meaſure by chance. The ſame Inſtruments,
according to the ſeveral Applications that are
made of them, being managed by two ſeveral
<pb n="113" facs="tcp:49276:74"/>
Hands, produce often both what is deſervedly
admired of one ſide, and what is as deſervedly de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpiſed
on the other. In a word, I do not hope,
by this Theory, to make all Gardeners equal a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mong
themſelves. But I give them, in all Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tries,
an eaſie,<note place="margin">A good Cul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture more ſignificant than a good Expoſition.</note> and natural, and very great In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>creaſe
of the Sun's Heat; which may often aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure
them of an extraordinary Succeſs; thô with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out
excluding the neceſſary Care and Skill, which
after all is the moſt ſignificant Part.</p>
            <p>If what I have been propoſing might,<note place="margin">Sloping Walls very neceſſary, while our Summers continue to be ſo cold.</note> at any
time, have been acceptable and uſeful to Man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kind,
it muſt certainly be ſo now. Every body
has been ſenſible, for theſe twelve or fifteen
Years, of a very great, and, as ſome think, un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>accountable
Change in our Seaſons. Our Sum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mers
are much colder than they were; and 'tis
but ſeldom they bring us any Thunder. Their
Influence is felt in many of the Productions of
the Earth; particularly in all ſorts of Fruits,
that come late in the Year: for ſuch have no
Heat to bring them to perfection. And the un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſettledneſs
of our Springs commonly deſtroys
the very firſt hopes we have, at the bloſſoming
of our Trees. The cauſe of this Change, in our
Seaſons, is often the Subject of common Diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>courſe:
And it is no wonder to ſee how wide and
empty the gueſſes of moſt people are, upon that
matter. This is certain, and was made out
<pb n="114" facs="tcp:49276:75"/>
heretofore paſt diſpute,<note place="margin">The cauſe of that change in our Sea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons referred to a Pheno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>menon like Smoak, that incompaſſes the Body of the Sun, and is ſeen to ſpread an ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceeding great way from it.</note> that from the Year 1683
downwards, and I ſay now even to the preſent
time, the Sun has been in the very Middle, or
Center, of a thin Miſt of a prodigious Extent;
<hi rend="margSglQuotes">which, incompaſſing the whole Body of the
Sun, ſpreads near the Plane of the Ecliptick, ſo as
to reach almoſt the great Orb of the Earth; re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſembling
much, in its Figure, an ordinary O<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cular
Glaſs, or Lens, equally convex on both
ſides. Its Thickneſs or Opacity (not where it
is greateſt, but where we may begin to ſee it,
when the Night is already become dark) is like
that of the Tail of a Comet, or the Milky
Way. But it is yet conſiderably greater, juſt
in the Line that paſſes from the Earth thrô
the Body of the Sun.</hi> Whoever has ſeen this
Vail, that is ſpread between the Sun and us, will
eaſily grant that it muſt needs take off ſome part
of its Heat. There has not yet been found, at
leaſt as far as I know, any other old Footſtep
of this ſtrange Phenomenon, but that in 1660,
Mr. <hi>J. Childrey,</hi> in his <hi>Britannia Baconica,</hi> has
printed that he had obſerved it ſeveral Years to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether,
and he deſired Aſtronomers to mind it.
Thus much ſeems very poſſible, that it might be
many Years unobſerved in the Sky, and perhaps
have continued for ſome Ages, without being
minded. But the very change in our Seaſons
ſeems now to be a Proof, that it has either not
<pb n="115" facs="tcp:49276:75"/>
been at all, in former times, unleſs we ſhould
find in Hiſtory ſuch another Series of cold Sum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mers,
or at leaſt that it is has not been ſo thick,
or has not laſted ſo long,<note place="margin">The Ori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gine of that Smoak.</note> as at preſent. The
true Syſtem of the World having at length been
diſcovered, by the immortal Mr. <hi>Newton,</hi> we may
perhaps gueſs more exactly, than heretofore, at
the natural Cauſes of this Appearance. <hi rend="margSglQuotes">It ſeems
then, at leaſt, the outſide of it, to ariſe from
ſome Fumes, or Exhalations, which the Sun
throws up, with an equal Strength, and the
greateſt it can, all about its Body, perpendicu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>larly
to the ſeveral points of its Surface. And
the Sun revolving at the ſame time, about its
Axis, in ſome 25 Days, occaſions the ſpread<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
of that Smoak, near the Plane of the Sun's
Equator, much farther than it dos towards the
Poles. The Parts of Smoak, whoſe Swiftneſs
is not ſo great, do not riſe ſo high; and per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>form
all their Motions, within the Body of the
Phenomenon; not being able ever to come
near its Extremity. And, ſuppoſing ſeveral

removed, going from that ſide, you intend to
favour, towards the other; provided it dos yet
bear directly over ſome part of the Bottom.
<pb n="119" facs="tcp:49276:77"/>
And this will make that ſide the ſteeper, which
probably you deſign for the outſide of your Gar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>den.</p>
               <p>The broader your Wall is at Bottom the bet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
it is for Vegetation; but the charge is alſo
greater. 2½ or 3 Foot may be a competent
Thickneſs. The Height will be well from 8 to
10 or 11 Foot. A higher Wall would be more
chargeable, and, unleſs the Breadth at bottom
be alſo increaſed, it would be leſs hot, and
would not laſt ſo long.</p>
               <p>Walls of darkeſt Colours are beſt.</p>

parts the Earth and the Wall,<note place="margin">Fig. <hi>XX.</hi>
                  </note> be perpendicular
to the Horizon; which will make the other ſide
of the Wall ſo much the more Sloping. And let
the ſeveral Beds of Bricks, which make up your
Wall, be, not Horizontal, but a little leaning
towards the Terraſſe. So the Wall will be a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble

               <p>Let the Earth of all your Terraſſes,<note place="margin">Let the Earth of the Terraſſes be throughly ſetled.</note> or other
Sloping Grounds, which you intend to face, be
throughly ſetled, or well beaten, before you

               <p>If you would have a Terraſſe, with ſolid Walls

               <p>If your Terraſſe be very Sloping on both

               <p>Terraſſes that are flat at top,<note place="margin">Of a broad Terraſſe and how it may be made;</note> with a Walk

Such are thoſe that run from North to South, or

               <p>You might alſo have a Wall breaſt high,<note place="margin">

of one ſide of the Terraſſe;<note place="margin">

ſpare ſome charge, and be pleaſanter in walking.
<pb n="121" facs="tcp:49276:78"/>
This is very proper,<note place="margin">And when the Terraſſe runs from Eaſt to Weſt.</note> when your Terraſſe runs
from Eaſt to Weſt: for thus your South Wall,
having at the Top of it the Wall breaſt high,
your North Wall will have a more proportiona<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble
Height for Trees. See the Figures quoted in
the Margin.</p>
               <p>The Ground of your Alleys may be made
Sloping by ſome 5 or 10 Degrees &amp;c,<note place="margin">The Ground of Alleys for Fruit may be made Sloping towards the South.</note> towards
the South: which will expoſe it better to the
Sun; and cauſe the Water to run more towards
the North Wall, or worſt ſide; and make the
Ground near the South Wall to be the dryer. This
will be particularly proper for Vines, which thrive
beſt in a pretty dry Ground; and for a Country
ſubject to much Rain.</p>
               <p>Your North Wall might be left bare,<note place="margin">The North Wall may be left bare, and Herbs ſown at the foot of it:</note> without
any Trees; which would make the reflected
Heat to be much the ſtronger, upon the South

Wall, might be ſown ſome Plants that require,
in your Climate, in the Spring and Summer,
much Sun Shine, and a Ground not very dry.
Such might be ſome Strawberries, or any other
ſmaller Plants, that are common in Gardens.
So then one ſide of your Alleys may be for
Fruit,<note place="margin">Or elſe the Earth be kept reſting, in or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der to renew that of the South Wall.</note> and the other ſide for all ſorts of Herbs. But,
if you think fit, the Earth of the North ſide may

               <p>
                  <pb n="122" facs="tcp:49276:79"/>
You may order,<note place="margin">Slopes prefer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red to Walls.</note> after the manner I have ſaid,
whatever Walls, or Terraſſes, you build; pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fering
always a Terraſſe, with a Slope on each
ſide, faced with Bricks, to an Earth, or Slope,
walled on one ſide, and only faced on the other:
as this muſt be preferred to a ſimple Wall, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out
any Earth.</p>
               <p>I need not ſay that,<note place="margin">If you can have but one Slope, give it the beſt Expoſition.</note> if in your Garden you
will have but one Slope, it ſhould be againſt the
beſt Wall, and reach the very Top.</p>
               <p>A Garden may very properly be ſurrounded
by a Slope of Earth,<note place="margin">Of a Slope round the Garden.</note> walled on one ſide, and fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ced
on the other; the Wall being at the outſide
of the Garden. But, if you pleaſe, you may not
make the Slope, that would look to the North.</p>
               <p>If you will be at a greater Expence,<note place="margin">Of a Terraſſe round the Garden.</note> you may
have a flat Terraſſe round your Garden. Or
elſe,<note place="margin">Of more Ter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>raſſes in the Garden.</note> before your Slope, that looks to the South,
build a ſharp Terraſſe, having the whole length
of your Garden. The ſame you might do along
your Slope, that looks to the North. And ſo
you might have as many Terraſſes, as you pleaſe.
But it is beſt not to part them, by a Garden be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween,
but to keep them all together; becauſe
they will be thus better ſheltered againſt Winds.</p>
               <p>A flat Terraſſe is that,<note place="margin">Of Flat and Sharp Ter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>raſſes.</note> which has a convenient
Walk at the Top of it; whether it be walled
or only faced on both ſides. A ſharp Terraſſe
is, for the moſt part, only faced on both ſides,
<pb n="123" facs="tcp:49276:79"/>
and ends at Top, as it were into an Edge; there
not being Room enough for a Walk. It may
alſo be walled on one ſide, and only faced on the
other. The ſame may be ſaid of a Flat Ter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>raſſe.</p>
               <p>A Sharp Terraſſe is preferable to a Flat Ter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>raſſe
for Cheapneſs. A Flat Terraſſe is prefer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able
to a Sharp Terraſſe for State, and for the
convenience of the Walk it affords.</p>
               <p>If your Climate be ſubject to very dangerous
Winds;<note place="margin">Deſcription of a Walk very well ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cured from Winds.</note> from which your Walls muſt be ſecured

place, two Terraſſes, running exactly
from Eaſt to Weſt,<note place="margin">
                     <hi>Fig.</hi> II. III<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
                  </note> like thoſe of the ſecond and
third Figure. I have no new Directions to give,
about the Inſides of thoſe Terraſſes. They muſt
be faced with Bricks; and, the Side expoſed to
the South being uſed for Fruit, the North Side
may either wholly reſt, or be employed as you
think fit. But, as to the Outſides, theſe not
being deſigned for any uſe, you may make them
as ſteep as you pleaſe. Then you may fill the
whole Spaces, comprehended by the indefinite
Lines, or rather Planes, AM, AO; EN, EP, continu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
as far as you think fit, with Trees, and very
tall and thick Hedges  or with Buildings,
and whatever elſe is able to ſtop the Wind. Both
the Ends of the Alley muſt be ſtopped, by a
croſs Terraſſe each; and, at their outſide, the
<pb n="124" facs="tcp:49276:80"/>
ſame care muſt be taken for a Shelter, of very
tall Hedges and Trees, againſt Winds.</p>
               <p>Thus the Walk, between your Terraſſes, will
be ſheltered, as much as poſſible, and the Heat
in it will be very cloſe, and the Sun Shine, that
is loſt, will be inconſiderable.</p>
               <p>I do not mean only that ſuch Buildings and
Plantations, as I ſpoke of, may be made about
your Walk, to ſecure it from Winds: but that
you may alſo take your advantage of Buildings
already made, and of Trees already planted, e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven
of thoſe of a Foreſt, to make your Alley
between them, and to ſecure it, by the Shelter
they will afford.</p>
               <p>The Roots of the Trees,<note place="margin">Of the Diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſition the Roots ought to have, in a Tree that is to be planted againſt a Sloping Wall.</note> we are to plant a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt
our Sloping Walls, ſhould not be diſpoſed
after the ſame way, as if the Walls were per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pendicular.
If there be but one Root, it is beſt
placed, when it makes an Angle, with the Body
of the Tree, equal to the Angle of the Sloping
Wall, with the Cultivated Ground. And then
ſuch a Root, being turned from the Wall, will
be Horizontal. But, thô the Root made a
ſmaller Angle with the Tree, yet there will be
commonly ſome poſition, where it will natural<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
place it ſelf, in your Cultivated Ground, in
an Horizontal Situation. But this muſt be done
with judgment, ſo that the Roots, of different
Trees, may not too much intermix.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="125" facs="tcp:49276:80"/>
If there be but two Roots in your Tree, when
they are oppoſite, and both Horizontal, place
them parallel to your Sloping Wall. If they be
not directly oppoſite, they will be beſt, when
they both bend a little downwards, from the Bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy
of the Tree. And you will eaſily find what
Situation is beſt, for the Tree, with keeping its
Body parallel to the Situation it is to have, and,
at the ſame time, turning the Tree about its own
Axis. After the ſame way, whatever be the num<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber
of your Roots, and their Situation, you will
know how to place the Tree, if you indeavour
to find how all the Roots, without running too
deep; from the places, which are heated by the
Sun, can beſt remain under Ground: eſpecially
under the Cultivated Ground, which receives more
the benefit of the Dew and Rain and Sun Shine,
than that which is under the Wall. And, when
the Roots are long and pliant, you may place
them; at your pleaſure, in a Situation parallel to
the Surface of the Ground, or to the Plane of
the Wall; according as they are near the one or
the other of thoſe.</p>
               <p>The Fruits that grow pretty high,<note place="margin">Deſcription of a Ladder to be uſed a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout Sloping Walls.</note> from your
Cultivated Ground, will require that you ſhould
have<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> in order to gather them, a Ladder ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>what
particular, with two Arms at the upper
End, by which it may be kept from the Wall,
and from the Trees. And ſuch a Ladder, being
<pb n="126" facs="tcp:49276:81"/>
once fixed, will be near parallel to the Wall;
and will ſerve to gather at once all the ripe
Fruits in that place; or to do all the neceſſary
Work about the Trees, be the Wall never ſo
high; till you remove the Ladder, to another
part of the Wall.</p>
               <p>Some Harbours,<note place="margin">Of Harbours and Summer Houſes, in our large Gardens.</note> Cabinets, or Summer Houſes,
in our large Garden, might be very well placed
at the four Corners. They ſhould have the
full Breadth of the Alleys, or rather more; ſo
that they may face the middle of them directly.
And the Walks may be continued into one ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther,
by cutting a round Space, from the Corner
of the Canal. I have drawn, in one of the Cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ners
of the ſixteenth Figure,<note place="margin">
                     <hi>Fig.</hi> XVI.</note> ſome pointed Lines,
which ſhew how I mean thoſe Summer Houſes
ſhould be made; and what changes they will
give, both in the Alleys and Canal, and in the
Corners of our main Terraſſe.</p>
               <p>Smaller Harbours, or Grottos, may be made
under the Terraſſes; and may ſerve for ſhelter
againſt Storms, and for Store-Houſes for our
Fruits: not to keep them there for a good while;
but to lay them up, till they be carried to a more
convenient Place. They may be of about ten
Foot Square; and have their Floor lower than
the Ground: and cauſe no other change, in the
outer Part of the Terraſſes, but that a Way
muſt be cut to them, along that Corner of the
<pb n="127" facs="tcp:49276:81"/>
Walk, which is expoſed to the North Weſt. They
muſt have a good deal of Air from the Door &amp;c.
And, according as you would have them dry, you
may have, under your Trees, in the South Wall, a
ſmall Window, of a convenient bigneſs, ſo much
raiſing from the Wall, as to exclude the Rain.
And, if you fear leſt you Harbour, or Store-Houſe,
might prove too damp, you may make
it narrower, and ſpread it under a greater length
of the Terraſſe. This will give you the liberty
of making the Floor higher, and level with your
Alley, or raiſed above it, by two or three Inches,
or more.</p>
               <p>One is not apt to think that a Brick Wall,<note place="margin">Of Orna<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments of Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chitecture, in a Wall alto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether ſmooth.</note> al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>together

and Windows, ſhould be capable of ſome pret<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty

But one might alſo imploy Bricks of different
Colours and Sizes. What is done in the Fron<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiſpiece,
for imitating an Architrave, Freeſe and
Corniſh, might alſo be done for Pilaſters, and
for large Partitions between them, like the Square
Frames of our Wainſcot, or like our Windows.
I ſay this, after having tried it, and perceived that
even the <hi>Schizzos</hi> I made looked noble and pretty;
and imitated our good Architecture, beyond what
I could have expected, without having any thing
either Gottick or Fanciful. The Example you
have, in the Frontiſpice, is very much inferiour
to what might have been done, if there had been
more Room. And not only the Modillons, of
the fineſt orders, might be eaſily imitated; but
ſo might alſo the Triglyphes, and Metopes, of the
Dorick.</p>
