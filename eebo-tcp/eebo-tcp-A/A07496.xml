         <editorialDecl>
            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            <p>
               <seg rend="decorInit">C</seg>Ourteous Reader, before thou enter vpon this Discourse, either to read or to censure, I haue to admonish thee of two things. First, for the manner of writing, thou maist easily see it, to bee fitted for the Pulpit. And indeed, so it was, that hauing diuerse yeeres since deliuered some few out of this text, to mine Auditory: I did lately (vpon warning giuen) take it once againe in hand, and alter, change, correct, and enlarge it, till I brought it to this quantitie in which it is<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> so preparing it for a more noble Audience. Then finding it be ouerlong to be rehearsed at once, I was constrained againe to Epitomize it. Here therefore hast thou (and that is the second thing whereof I aduertise thee) at large the whole body of that Discourse, whose
<pb facs="tcp:1546:6"/>
Epitome was rehearsed in publique. So that if a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny thing, seemed to them that heard mee eyther obscure, or too slightly passed ouer in the deliue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry, here may they helpe themselues to vnderstand my meaning. For the matter I shall not neede to tell thee, that it is needfull in respect of the times, wherein the words of our Sauiour are seene fulfil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led, <hi>For because iniquitie doth abound, the loue of ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny waxeth cold.</hi> And how many are there daily, who either fall backe to Popery, and Aegyptian<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>palpable superstition, or else turne open rebels by Atheisme? And well may we thinke that when the Sonne of man commeth, he will scarce finde faith vpon earth. Who is there, therefore, except that vnprofitable seruant that hid his Talent in a Napkin, but will be willing to set to his helping hand, if not to stay all, yet to preserue some from Apostasie? Hence commeth it, that now lately there haue beene more Sermons and Tractates publisht concerning this sinne of Apostasie, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in these few yeeres, than were in many ages here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tofore. So that now it might seeme as superfluous for an after-commer, to deale in this subiect, as to take in hand new Arguments for Popery: All which haue bin so often vrged by Schoole-men, alledged by Catholikes, re-assumed by Popish Priests, painted ouer by Iesuits, that a man might sooner hope for holesome meate to be made of Cole-worts, twise or thrise sodden, than to find a new, and not here-to fore answered Argument. So here: Yet since the gifts of men are diuers (albeit they proceed from the same spirit) what hindreth
<pb facs="tcp:1546:6" rendition="simple:additions"/>
but that still men may bee doing, and doe well, since the end of their Action, is the glory of God?</p>
            <p>Concerning this present Tractate, what it hath, not to be found in the former, thou thy selfe (good Reader) vpon tryall wilt easily perceiue. In reading of which, if thou be such a one who knowest me not, It is well, goe on and try the spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rits: If such who doest know mee, yet doe me the curtesie, to withdraw thy selfe from considering my meane-nesse, and looke onely vpon the cause. Consider the waight of Reason, which I haue al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledged. For if thou shouldest either like the worse of this, in respect of mee, or esteeme better of an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>other, in respect of his person, not regarding what force of Argument we doe either of vs alledge: thou maist easily erre, as who indeed doest pinne the truth of God vpon the sleeue of man.</p>
            <p>To conclude then, if thou be judicious, reade, censure, and correct, I giue thee free libertie For I will not my selfe, be tyed to this that I haue de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liuered, if I see better reason to evince it, than is brought to confirme it. But if thou be one, who either doest, or justly maist suspect thy iudgement, reade, but leaue censuring to others. Howsoeuer it bee, whosoeuer thou art, conceiue thus of mee, that my desire was to haue deliuered the Truth, and nothing but the Truth. So wilt thou, I hope, commend me and my labours to the blessing of God in thy prayers: And cause mee to rest</p>

               <hi>
                  <seg rend="decorInit">M</seg>ARVAILE</hi> not (deere Christians and courteous Readers) that so many lear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned diuines and holy minded men, bestow so much paines, and spend so long time, in so sad and vnpleasant a subiect as this is; searching and desirous to define what the impardonable sinne against the holy Ghost should be: For euen as the best and most approued Phisitians doe more busie themselues in studying those mala<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dies, which are most incurable, rather then those, for which euery emperick hath a medecine in readinesse, and cach one amongst them proueth himselfe in his skill, if hee haue sound out eyther some especiall Antidote to preuent, or some singu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lar remedy (if not perfectly to cure, yet) to ease and aswage the tormenting paines of such desperat disseases as aflict men most, as well with the feare of imminent death, as with the sence of present dolours: Euen so, for as much as all heede is to be giuen, and all diligence carefully vsed, that no man (if it be possible) dash vpon this Rocke, nor fall into so deuouring a deepe; many students in diuinitie, enflamed with zeale, care, and loue vnto mens saluation, refuse no paines, nor think any labour grieuous, by night or day, if they may be so happie,
<pb facs="tcp:1546:8"/>
as to giue warning betimes, and so preuent any mans relapse, or falling away: And for as much as many true hearted Christians, vpon a tendernesse of Conscience, through Satans illusions, are often troubled with a feare of hauing offended in this kinde: And others againe, in a continuall securitie, for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>saking their first loue, reuolt and fall off, by little and little, from the practise of sincere Piety, taking the high way to E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>picurisme, and denyall of their profession, and so come neere and into great daunger of finall relapse at lest, if not of an ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tred also, and despight of that holy truth which they once pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fessed: therefore good men willing to comfort the one, with solid euidence of Gods word, and to reclaime and saue the o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther from the perill of so irrecouerable a fall, doe labour in this sad subiect, that by an exact deciphering of that mortall sinne, both might finde fit instruction, whilest the one may see how farre they are from it, and the other perceiue how daun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gerously they hasten towards it.</p>
            <p>Now as men are diuersly affected, some with feare, and some with presumption (as I haue shewed) so likewise we may finde very great, (yea too much) variety of opinion amongst writers concerning this sinne, some supposing it to be so rarely and seldome admitted, as scarce three examples or foure can be produced since the beginning of the World, others make it so frequent and vsuall, as almost all that finally fall from their Faith and holy profession, are supposed, by them, to sinne in this kinde.</p>
            <p>Againe, some are of opinion, that only God can discerne, who they be, that sinke and are drowned in this gulfe; as if he had not reuealed any certainty concerning this matter, and thereupon shunne and reiect all meditation vpon this point, and Argument, as vaine and vncertaine. I am not worthy neyther will I take vpon me to censure great and learned men, but let it be seriously considered, how much and how often mention is made in Gods word, of this fearefull fall and dire<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full plight, that men are brought into thereby, and we may ea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sily guesse that the Lord would not haue vs vtterly ignorant of it: And let vs weigh and obserue the fruit, and great be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nefit
<pb facs="tcp:1546:8"/>
which Gods people, by a sober and wise meditation hereof may reape, and it may be iudged, that their labour is commen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dable, who warily and with iudgement, write and preach to that purpose For, as Mariners cannot easily shunne the gulfe nor rock, except they know (or at lest can guesse) whereabouts the daunger is; No more is it likely that a Christian professor should liue absolutely without the perill or feare of this, so fearefull a sinne, in some probable sort, vnlesse he be warned thereof by such as doe study the point of purpose.</p>
            <p>It is more then manifest, that the danger of such a relapse is very great, and that our vigilancy and care of auoiding it ought to be no lesse, and lastly considering the drowsie securitie of this age, the present decay of zeale, the vtter neglect of the meanes to quicken it, that no argument is of more necessary and profitable vse to be preached or published, then this at this time, wherein many hanging, as it were, in suspence and ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pectation, are ready, whatsoeuer shall ensue, with <hi>Demas</hi> to embrace the present world, and so politickly, in the meane while, doe carry themselues, that which way soeuer they shall hereafter thinke good to incline, yet they shall not be deemed Apostataes: But let them for all that (as it were vpon this publique warning) examine themselues, whether their hearts and Consciences bee not plainely and euidently euinced of the truth of the Gospell, against Atheisme, Papisme, Turcis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>me, Iudaisme, or whatsoeuer Gentilisme, or other sect, and if so, then consider, whether the reuolt from the knowne truth, will not prooue as haynous a fault in Gods sight, for all their couert carriage, as heauy a clogge to their Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sciences, as deepe a downefall from Grace, and as wilfull a losse of the tast of the power of the world to come, as if they had professed it in the forwardest manner, or rather let them feare lest, whilst they (in worldly wisedome) vsing cautelous circum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>spection to prouide for a change, doe not palpably bewray, that they receiue not the loue of the truth, together with the know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge thereof, and so declare plainly, that they are of the num<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber of those, vpon whom God, in his iust iudgement, will send strong delusion to beleeue lies. The Scribes and Phari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sees
<pb facs="tcp:1546:9"/>
neuer vndertooke the profession of Christ, as of the pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mised Messias; yet because they were euidently conuinced by his word and workes, that he it was, that was to come, Christ spareth not to call their wilfull reluctation and opposi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion against him, blasphemie against the Spirit; And I could wish, that such wary walkers in neutralitie, would vouchsafe to peruse this short treatise, which tendeth to admonish them at least, that they outstand not the time of Grace, but rather feare, least being forsaken, and lest in a Reprobate sence (when they would) they shall not bee able to embrace and apply to themselues, what they once knew and had learned and so fall to despight both God and good men. This let all men know and take notice of that no time nor age since the dayes of the A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>postles, hath beene more likely to bring forth plentie of pec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cants in this kinde, then this we liue in. First, knowledge did neuer so abound, not onlie amongst the learned, but euen a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mongst the lay-vulgar, by the cleere light and plentifull prea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ching of the Gospell<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> Secondly, this knowledge hath begotten an vniuersall profession and forme of outward Godlines, wher<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by men giue consent to the Truth, preached and manifested vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to them. Thirdly, this generall consent hath bred a forward<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse in many, shewing in probabilitie their hearts affected with that which they professe, and to haue attained a taste of the heauenly gift, as the Apostle speaketh: From such a de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gree and measure of knowledge and Grace, if any should fall as (if greater heede be not taken) it may be feared s<gap reason="illegible" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>me will, especially, if that should come to passe, which those Politicians before spoken of doe prepare for, and want of zeale in others doth deserue. How deepe should they sinke into this Dunge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, and how neere might we iudge them vnto this sinne? Cast your eyes back a little, and looke vnto the Histories of former times, and for want of other bookes concerning more ancient a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ges of the primitiue Church, take notice only of the defection after King <hi>Edwards</hi> daies: How many seeming forward professors, during the liberty of the Gospell (in a moment al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>most) not only forsooke their sinceritie, but also became vio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lent persecutors of that themselues professed, whose desperate
<pb facs="tcp:1546:9"/>
ends in that their wilfull Apostasie, without any remorse at all pronouncing damnation vpon themselues, with horrible blas<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phemies, and he<gap reason="illegible" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>lish despight against God, declare manifestly, that their fall was scarefull, and their sinne vnpa<gap reason="illegible" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>donable. Now, although we haue none other cause (blessed bee God) giuen to vs, to feare or suspect any such defection or change, but only our owne sinnes, deseruing such a plague, yet are not their labours vaine and to no purpose, which giue warning be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore, that men looke to their standing, and take heede that they fall not. Sathan is subtle, and mens hearts are deceipt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full out of measure, and some without any such cause giuen, may be taken with a sudden spirituall Apoplexie, and fall headlong at once, not only into the loue and practise of sensu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>alitie, but also into the hatred of that grace of God, which teacheth them to deny all vngodlinesse, and worldly lusts, and to liue Godly, righteously and soberly in this present world.</p>
            <p>And some others, though they fall not at once, like a man that flingeth himselfe downe headlong from the top of a Rocke or steeple, may be so carelesse of their estate, as by insensible back sliding, through the deceiptfulnesse of sinne, they may depart away from the liuing God, and being once gone, fall into <hi>Saul</hi> his case the sonne of <hi>Cis,</hi> who quite berest of the spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit of Grace, had an euill spirit sent to terment him. Or be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come like the Apothecaries Gl<gap reason="illegible" extent="1 letter">

                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>uours that exhort, admonish, and rebuke be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore hand, may truely be said to be the Antidotes, and blessed meanes of preuention, and they that desire to stand and not to fall, ought to vse them reuerently, and with thankes to God, who, of his infinite mercies, vseth mens ministeries vnto the preseruation of mens soules.</p>
            <p>And to the end that all true holy-minded Christians may better keepe watch and ward against Satans sleights and sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tleties, this one secret is worthy obseruing: To take great heede continually by all meanes, to nourish and increase the
<pb facs="tcp:1546:10"/>
peace of Conscience, and ioy in the holy Ghost. For as these are the last and principall graces men attaine vnto by the prea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ching of the Gospell, so are they the first, which such as fall a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>way doe commonly loose, whereupon the blessed Apostle, with very great reason encouraging the <hi>Philippians</hi> against imminent troubles assureth them, that the peace of God which passeth all vnderstanding <gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap> shall be a guard or Garison to their hearts, and to their minds, implying, that peace with God, and ioy in the holy Ghost, are present rewards of holinesse, effects of true Faith and Repen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance, earnest pennies of the rewarde to come, and therefore principall encouragements vnto Constancie and Perseuerance in all well d<gap reason="illegible" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>eing, wherefore in a word, this is it I would say, that our aduersary the Deuill will especially labour, and vse his whole cunning, to bereaue men eyther, of these, very Gra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces themselues, or of the sence of them, which is easily done by drawing them into wilfull sinnes, which defile the Conscience, and disturbe the peace therof. Vpon the losse of the reward (as labourers and souldiers doe more negligently applie themselues when they are doubtfull of their pay<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> so) men grow lesse care<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full of holy duties, and doe not so much delight in them; why? But euen because, by the defiling of their Consciences, they doe not finde their wonted comfort in such exercises: So the meanes of renewing their Repentance dis-vsed, or lesse fre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quented, by neglect of the meanes the heart growes into hard<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse, sinne into custome, and disquietnesse of Conscience into a <gap reason="illegible" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>umbdnesse or <hi>non-sense,</hi> then must needes both Faith and Hope faile, the losse whereof, that it might be lesse felt<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> Satan offereth carnall delights in sensualitie and pleasures, then God and the world to come beginne to be forgotten; sinceritie and strictnesse of Life beginne to be intollerable; Loosenesse and liberty plausible, admonitions odious, all manner of lewdenesse iustifiable, Gods word hated, and messengers persecuted, and how little differeth this fearefull reuolt, from the sinne against the holy Ghost? The effect whereof, and iust punishment can be none other but finall despayre in the man, and horrible blasphemies against God and his Christ, with a despighting of
<pb facs="tcp:1546:10"/>
his spirit of Grace, and so at last euerlasting torments in hell fire. Behold then both the ladder (as I may say) whereby menascend, and the rope, whereby they fall or descend into this Dungeon; men climbe, and attaine to some taste and smack of the powers of the world to come, which I call peace of Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>science, and ioy in the holy Ghost, by these steppes. First, their mind and vnderstanding, by the preaching of the word, is en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lightened with the knowledge of the Mysterie of Christ. Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>condly, the will and reason consenteth. Thirdly, the heart imbraceth and applieth vnto a measure of Faith, and of Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pentance. Fourthly, the affections beginne to frame into obe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dience. Fiftly, the life and conuersation is fashioned to the outward forme of Godlinesse. Sixtly, the Conscience is at peace and the inward man ioyeth: Now the manner of relapse, or descent, is downe the same way. Ioy and peace of Conscience are lost through some wilfull sinne. Secondly, the life and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uersation growes worse and worse. Thirdly, the affections are altered from delight in holinesse, and loosed from obedience. Fourthly, Faith fayleth, and Repentance giuen euer. Fiftly, the benefit by Christ, despised. Sixtly, a great decay of know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledg followeth, through the contempt of the meanes, and so the man is giuen vp vnto a Reprobate sense, whereby God and goodnesse and all their worshippers despighted and persecuted: As euery one therefore loueth his soule, and longeth for salua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion in Christ, and delighteth in the assurance thereof; so let him beware and take heed of defiling and disquieting his cosc<gap reason="illegible" extent="1 letter">

two (whom he dares trust, and thinketh able, by his or their counsell and godlinesse, to helpe) into what temptation hee is fallen, that he may not beare the brunt of the assault alone: And whatsoeuer befaileth, let him not flie to carnall delights, or worldly myrth and vanitie for remedy, which brings a for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>getfulnesse of this guiltinesse, and so a secure benummednesse of Conscience, to his vtter vndoeing, rather then a true cure and helpe for his dangerous disease, vse only those meanes which may recouer true peace of Conscience with God, and the battaile is sought, and the field wonne: For very often times, as by euil Chyrurgerie, acurable wound groweth to a gangren, euen so the wound of Conscience, which might haue beene to the increase of Grace, and better certaintie of saluation, by forsaking the true and right cure, becommeth desperat carnae<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>

               </gap>ly experience of those that haue to deale with af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flicted Consciences. First, that such as feare least they haue thus sinned, are vndoubtedly as yet, free from this sin, or from falling <gap reason="illegible" extent="3 letters">

Thirdly, that who so hath a desire to be reconciled to God, and could wish himselfe par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>doned, shall surely obtaine pardon, if he seeke it at Gods hand, according to his word. Fourthly, that whosoeuer would not that another should fall into his wretched plight and condition, hath <gap reason="illegible" extent="1 letter">

Seuenthly, If any place of Scripture or po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sition of Gods word, doth minister more consolation or com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fort, or on the other side, more affright or terrifie then another, there is still place for the working vpon the Conscience, by the word, which is quite taken away in the case of the sin against the holy Ghost. Lastly, if all, or most of the speeches of the party affected, concerning God, and Christ, and his Church, be not blasphemous, or if the offender could not wish them blasphemies (it may be a fearefull and a damnable case) but it is not fully this desperat and impardonable sinne: But let no man trust in himselfe, or in his owne strength of recouering, to giue way willingly, no not vnto the least sinne, for Satan (as is said) is subtle, and we are weake and foolish, and God is not bound to attend vs, but we him.

By which wordes hauing intimated a difference of sinnes, and thereby gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uen just occasion of a doubt, of a question, he annexeth the solution, the answere of it in this Text, shewing plainely, that there is a sinne vnto death, for which hee will not haue prayers to be made, <hi>There is a sinne vnto death, I say not that thou shouldest pray for it.</hi>

that it should haue beene lost againe, and so the Popes Kitchin haue wanted fire, fuell, and other vtensilles, it was conuenient, nay, in a manner necessary, that some sins should be accounted veniall, that so, though a man should die in them without repentance, yet there might be some hope to helpe him: But not daring to make all sinnes veniall, lest they might seeme to haue reversed the judgement of God, they left some to be mortall.

               <p>First, enquire what this sinne is which is against the<note place="margin">1</note> Holy Ghost.</p>
               <p>Secondly, why it is so mortall.<note place="margin">2</note>
               </p>
               <p>Of both these with as much briefenesse and plaines as such a matter will giue leaue.</p>
               <p>For the first, I take it for granted that all men doe easily vnderstand that this Sinne (which nowe wee seeke) is no sinne of Infirmity; nor of Ignorance: but it must needes bee a sinne of a Presumptuous minde, a sinne with an high hand: so that onely among them will wee looke. There is a sinne against knowledge, <hi>When the seruant knoweth his masters will, and doth it not.</hi> Well may our sinne comprehend this vnder it, but all sinne against knowledge is not this sinne. There is a sinne against conscience, when notwithstanding the conscience like Gods solliciter <note n="c" place="margin">Surdo verbert coedit.</note> secretly checketh them yet on they goe still, this is worse then the former, but yet neither can it bee that which we seeke, vnlesse wee would enwrap <hi>Dauid</hi> in it. There is a sinne of Presump<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion <note n="d" place="margin">Perk. <hi>Case cons.</hi> lib. 1. cap. 2. §. 3.</note> proceeding from pride, and arrogancie, <hi>wilful<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse and haughtines of heart:</hi> which both wilfully and contemptuously causeth a man to sinne against God. <hi>wilfully,</hi> as presuming vpon Gods mercy and his owne future repentance, <hi>Contemptuously,</hi> as despising and con temning the Law of God. These are great, grosse, and grieuous, especially if the particular sinne be either I<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dolatrie which is the forsaking of God, or witch-craft, which is a ioyning Couenant with Satan. In these, to sinne against knowledge, against the checke of consci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence, presumptuously, wilfully, and contemptuously, is a sinne that may make the earth to tremble, and the hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uens
<pb n="8" facs="tcp:1546:17"/>
to sweat with amazednes, that <hi>earth should thus transgresse against heauen, man against God.</hi> Yea it may on a suddaine set a man into a stound, and driue his thoughts to a perplexitie to consider what further de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gree of sinne there can bee founde or thought of, into which the Sonne of <hi>Adam</hi> may slip or plunge himselfe.</p>
               <p>But let vs wade a little deeper, <hi>Origen</hi> (as <note n="c" place="margin">Bellar. lib. 2. De Poenit. cap. 16.</note> 
                  <hi>Bellarmine</hi> alledgeth) thought that euery sinne committed against the Law of God after Baptisme, was the sinne against the Holy Ghost, not farre from this were the <hi>Novati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans,</hi> But <hi>Athanasius</hi> doth well refute this opinion: first because our Sauiour doth accuse the Pharisees of this sinne, who yet neuer were Christians nor baptized, whereas the opinion of <hi>Origen</hi> doth suppose a prceden<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cie of baptisme in those who may fall into this Aposta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sie. Secondly, Because then it woulde followe that all sinnes committed by Christians shoulde bee sinnes of this nature, as beeing committed after the Sacrament of Baptisme: which to hold, what were it else, but to barre vp the gates of heauen against all Christians what soeuer, for who is there that sinneth not, and sinneth not grieuously at one time or other? Truth it is that Christians falling into sinne, doe sinne against the grace of God receiued, But wee seeke out one speciall sinne which in a principall maner and for some speciall con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sideration is called the Sinne against the Holy Ghost. such is not each sinne committed after Baptisme.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Augustine,</hi> standeth for finall Impoenitencie (<hi>viz.</hi>) when men die without repentance. Certainely I can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not but much commende the censure that <hi>Bellarmine</hi> passeth vpon this opinion, <note n="f" place="margin">Haec vera est sententia, quate<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nus docet fina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lem Impoeniten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiam esse aliquod peccatum in spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritum sanctum: sed non lefendi potest si velit hoc esse proprium peccatum. Lib. 2 de Poeni. cap. 16</note> 
                  <hi>This is true</hi> (sayth hee) <hi>so farre forth as it teacheth that finall impoenitencie is some spe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciall sinne against the holy Ghost, but it cannot bee defended, if hee woulde haue this impoenitencie to bee that peculiar and proper sinne which wee feeke for.</hi> But I more commende his Reasons, First, Because finall Impoenitencie, is not blasphemy, but onely a certaine circumstance in euery
<pb n="9" facs="tcp:1546:17" rendition="simple:additions"/>
sinne, whereas our sinne is a blaspheming sinne as heereafter shall appeare, in which respect it is called blasphemie against the Spirit. Secondly, This finall Impoenitency is not committed till death, for which cause it is called finall, (<hi>viz.</hi>) which continueth to and in the ende (I suppose) to distinguish it from the other Impoenitencie (a species of sinne of malice) which ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to their doctrine may bee forgiuen in this life; but the sinne against the Holy Ghost is committed in this life, the which hee confirmeth, first by the practise of our Sauiour who taxed the Pharises at that time li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving and like enough to liue longer, Secondly by the text of <hi>Paul</hi> to the <hi>Hebrues</hi> 6. Necessarily to bee vnder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stoode of men liuing, vnlesse wee woulde make <hi>Paul</hi> speake thus, <hi>It is impossible that the dead should be renewed by repentance:</hi> which how vnbeseeming so great an A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>postle it were, iudge yee. Lastly by this text of <hi>Iohn,</hi> the which indeede speaketh of a man seeing his brother sin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning, and not of one knowing or hearing that hee hath sinned: whereupon he concludeth that our sinne is not finall Impoenitencie, which not before death, and hardly then, can bee seene and discerned.</p>
               <p>A third opinion holdeth the sinne against the Holy Ghost, to be any sinne of malice: This is the common opinion receiued from the Schoolemen, and by the Papistes much magnified, Let vs (if you please) fetch it from the originall.</p>

Thirdly,<note place="margin">Invidentia <gap reason="illegible" extent="1 letter">

               </p>
               <p>Secondly, Further, if we well consider of it, we shall easily see that this <hi>Propositum non revertendi,</hi> Purpose to continue still in sinne without repentance, is such a dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>position as cannot sinke into the heart of a man, and therbe setled, vnlesse the Iudicial act of God do proceed against a man for former sinne.

               <p>Thirdly, Once more heare what <hi>Stella</hi> sayth concer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning Impenitencie (which among all the sixe is that which most pleaseth the <hi>Rhemists,</hi> and which they doe most easily grant to be the sinne against the holy Ghost) <note n="b" place="margin">Non est verisi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mile, tot p<gap reason="illegible" extent="1 letter">

               </p>
               <p>The next couple are, <hi>Impugnation of the knowne truth,</hi> and <hi>Envying of Gods graces bestowed vpon the brother-hood.</hi> These two come somewhat neere, especially, if wee re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>member their <hi>Genus,</hi> which is <hi>Peccatum ex malitia,</hi> Sinne grounded vpon malice.

               <p>Now for the last couple, viz. <hi>Desperation</hi> and <hi>Presum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ption.</hi> These cannot be that sinne which we seeke for.

For either <hi>Beza</hi> meanes no more then this, that it is di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rectly and immediately against God, as the breaches of the first Table, not mediately as the breaches of the second.

               <p>And certainely, I fully beleeue that this sinne against the holy Ghost doth necessarily suppose the knowledge

                  <hi>Saul, Iudas, Alexander the Copper-smith, Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rius, Francis Spira,</hi> and <hi>Iulian</hi> the Apostata; All these made profession of the Gospell before they fell away. And by name <hi>Iulianus</hi> was well grounded in the Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stian Religion, knew the truth of the Gospell, was bap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tised, yea, and publiquely did make profession of it, and yet through the perswasions, inticements, and allure<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments of those wicked Philosophers, <hi>Libanius, Iambli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cus,</hi>
                  <pb n="22" facs="tcp:1546:24"/>
and others, he fell away and became a most cruell persecutor. This is one sort: Another there is, which haue certaine knowledge of the truth, but yet haue not giuen their names to professe it, but doe hate, perse<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cute, and blaspheme it, calling it erroneous, haereticall, and diabolicall; Such were the <hi>Pharisees,</hi> against whom our Sauiour Christ disputeth, <hi>Mat.</hi> 12. Who albeit they did know this to bee truth which Christ taught, knew that he was the <hi>Messiah,</hi> that his miracles were wrought by the finger of God, yet of an obstinate, enui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous, and malitious minde resisted, contradicted, and blasphemed. Such were some of <hi>Stephens</hi> accusers, they knew the truth of that he taught, yea, and were convic<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted in their consciences, so that they could not resist the spirit by which he spake. But the most manifest ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ample is in Satan and his Angels. For though he know the truth, that is, That Christ is God, the Sauiour of the world, that all felicitie is to be hoped from him alone: yet still he doth resist slander, and blaspheme the truth<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> and hauing maliciously rejected it himselfe, doth labour by all meanes, to bring men into the same state of con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demnation. Hence come all heresies which doe oppose the Truth: Hence come Atheisme and Epicurisme, whereby all care of Religion is cast off. Yea, which is most of all to be wondered at, albeit he knoweth that his wickednesse falleth still vpon his owne pate, yet he doth still resist because he will resist. To wind vp this point, All they who fall into this sinne first of all doe attaine to a certaine and assured knowledge of the truth, though all doe not professe it. Yea, and which is more, it is no swimming motion, but a full perswasion, <note n="g" place="margin">Therefore <hi>Beza</hi> transla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teth that <gap reason="foreign">

This if you will remember, you shall not neede to feare the enticing words of mans wisedome, which cunning seducers vse to beguile vnstable soules.

                  <hi>prorsus lapsi,</hi> if they fall a way, <hi>id est,</hi> altogether, totally. For reason willeth that the fall bee as generall as the grace receiued.

                  <hi>Antithesis,</hi> and opposition betwixt the grace of God bestowed vpon him, and this his fall. So that if the grace be generall as wee heard before, so al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>so must be the falling away.</p>
               <p>The summe of all this is, It is not a particular lapsing, sliding, falling, but a generall and vniuersall falling a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>way. Not the Eclipsing, or clouding of the sunne, but the full setting, yea, such a setting as admitteth no ri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sing, aeternall night.

it. In a word, it is not <hi>Deliquium animi,</hi> a fayling, or swooning, but <hi>seperatio animae,</hi> a separation, a plaine death, a totall, generall, and vniuersall Apostasie.</p>
               <p>Two wayes is this Apostasie said to bee vniuersall, first, Simply, when men doe cast off all Religion, re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nounce the truth wholly, altogether contemning both it, and all that belongeth to it, to their might, opposing, hating, blaspheming, and persecuting all that professe, and fauour it. Of this kind were those in the Primitiue Church, who revolted to Paganisme, and Gentilisme, as did <hi>Iuliaa</hi> the Emperour: and as many doe question<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lesse, who liue among the barbarous Turkes, and leau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing their former profession, doe turne Turkes, and em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brace their abhominations: and some that abide in the bosome of the Church, who fall away to plaine A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>theisme.</p>
               <p>Secondly, Consequently when men doe fall away and renounce some maine fundamentall poynt of the Gospell; the which being violently opposed, doth in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed by consequence strike at all the rest. Such was the Apostacie of <note n="y" place="margin">

               <p>Last of all, in <hi>Saul, Iudas, Iulian,</hi> and the like, their action must needs be simply voluntary, in that they had time of Deliberation. For the Apprehension of good doth not worke so effectually vpon the will as doth the Apprehension of euill. And therefore those passions which doe apprehend good, doe not take away Electi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on and Deliberation, but doe allow men sufficient time to thinke of all inconveniences, and giue them libertie to resolue whether they will doe so or no. Whereas those passions which doe apprehend euill, doe not so easily suffer a man to consult, and therfore if these cause not involuntary actions, much lesse doe the former.</p>
               <p>Whereby you see the difference betwixt the fact of <hi>Iudas,</hi> and the fall of <hi>Peter.

doe define it. Now who seeth not, that if this bee Impaenitency, and Impaenitency the sinne against the holy Ghost, and the sinne against the holy Ghost, a sinne vnto death; what a strong and inexpugnable ground here is for Popish Paenance? The same is there here for Commutation of Paenance, for if this sinne be remissible, but not <hi>de sacile,</hi> easily, then must there come a good round portion to the Priest for a gentle Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mutation. Some such reason as this, I guesse moued the holy Fathers of shrift, to magnifie this exposition that <hi>Aquinas</hi> giueth of Irremissible, or else this: As one well obserueth in their handling of <hi>Mat.</hi> 12. they follow S. <hi>Augustine</hi> walking alone, rather then Hillary, <hi>Ierome, Chrysostome</hi> and other, for what reason he knoweth not, vnlesse it be for that, here, <hi>Augustine</hi> went farthest from the words and sence of the Scripture: So I may say here, I see not why this should please them better than the other, vnlesse it be for that it goeth farthest from the words and sence of the holy Scripture.</p>
               <p>But to let these passe, come we to those Reasons which more Orthodoxall writers will afford vs, the which for my memories sake I will reduce to three heads. Some are drawne from the <hi>Obiect.</hi> Some from the <hi>Nature.</hi> Some from the <hi>Punishment</hi> of this sinne. The Obiect against which this sinne doth bend it selfe, is externally, the Gospell: Internally, the spirit of Grace, that worketh by the Gospell.</p>
               <p>First then it being a sinne against the Gospell it must<note place="margin">Gospell.</note> needes be Irremissible: For, what is the Gospell but the word of Grace, the ministration of Life, declaring vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to man (in himselfe lost) a way by which he may re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turne to his former estate of Grace and Glory. Now so long as there is not the knowledg of the Mediator, and of this meanes of recouery, the words of the Lord haue place. <hi rend="sup">q</hi> 
                  <hi>Shall they fall, and not arise? Shall they</hi>

                     </gap> 4</note> 
                  <hi>turne away, and not turne againe?</hi> But when once the meanes of recouery by the Gospell is neglected, con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>temned,
<pb n="45" facs="tcp:1546:35"/>
and despised, then is there no place for remis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sion: So long as there is not the knowledge of the Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diator, it seemeth impossible that the creature should Ir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>recouerably fall from the Creator.</p>
               <p>And herein certainly is there one maine difference, betwixt the fall of <hi>Adam,</hi> and the fall of the Angels. <hi>Adam</hi> fell by misperswasion, being deceiued by the ly<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing suggestion of the spirit of error: <note n="r" place="margin">D<hi rend="sup">•</hi>. <hi>Field</hi> of the Church <hi>li.</hi> 1. <hi>cap.</hi> 3.</note> But the Angels being intellectuall spirits, dwelling in heauenly places, in the presence of God, and light of his countenance, could not sinne by error or misperswasion, but of pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>posed malice, which is the sinne against the holy Ghost, and is Irremissible. <hi>Adam</hi> falling from the knowledg of the Law, fell recouerably: They falling from the knowledge of the Gospell, fell Irrecouerably: For vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derstanding of this. I praesuppose, that God did signi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fie to the Angels these points at once. First, that their Righteousnesse consisted in their Obedience. Second<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, that the acceptance of their obedience should bee through Christ. Christ, I say, who in fulnesse of time was to be incarnate, and to take, not the nature of An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gels, but of man, and by the personall vnion of the two natures in his one person, lift vp the humanitie aboue the nature of Angels, and so remayning one indiuidu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>all person, to be the head of the Church. Thirdly, that from this person should be expected, all good whatsoe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uer, so that what good soeuer the creature was to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiue, they were to receiue it from God only, in the name of this mediator, this being the summe of the Gos<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pell, no doubt, was deliuered to them<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> and so in a man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner the whole will and councell of God, both of Law and Gospell, and that by a shorter and neerer way than man is capable of; they hauing <note n="s" place="margin">Field ibidem.</note> the fulnesse of intelle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctuall light<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> so that when they take view of any thing, they see all that pertaineth to it, whereas man findeth but one thing after another.

it, partly puffed vp with pride, in respect of the excel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lency of their owne nature, scorning to be accepted in any but themselues; partly enuying so great glory to the nature of man, disdayning to bee subiect to Christ, as man, and to stand obliged to him for all benefits; alto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether refused to be obedient to this ordinance of God, and so refused as that they chose rather to leaue their first estate, and their heauenly habitation, than to agree and subscribe, and submit themselues, to this aeternall and immutable decree of God. And which is yet more plaine to manifest their sinne, to be the sinne against the holy Ghost: They fell, hauing receiued the knowledg of the whole worke of the three persons, for, and vnto the Angels. First, of God the Father, creating and gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uing a Law, and taking exception against their disobe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dience. Secondly, of God the Sonne, in whom only stood reconciliation and acceptance, through his obe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dience, more worth and honorable to God the Father, than that of all the creatures, both Angels and men. Thirdly, of God the holy Ghost, by whose power and grace only, is possibility for any creature, man or An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gell, to stand or recouer. This in modesty may we be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leeue to haue beene the fall of Angels, whose sinne is Irremissible as is this our sinne in man, because it is an Apostasie from the Gospell.</p>
               <p>Secondly, as against the Gospell, so against the Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit,<note place="margin">Spirit.</note> which worketh grace by the Gospell. The Schoole<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men said not nothing, inascribing <hi>Power</hi> to the Father, <hi>Knowledge</hi> to the Sonne, and <hi>Grace</hi> to the holy Ghost. Against the Father men sinne of infirmitie, against the Sonne of Ignorance, and these two are remissible. But against the holy Ghost men sinne of malice, and this is irremissible. But I would rather haue said thus: That in regard these men sinne against the spirit (<hi>id est,</hi> the pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per effect and worke of the spirit in them) their sinne must needs be <hi>irremissible,</hi> because there is not another person in the Trinitie, whereby they might receiue
<pb n="47" facs="tcp:1546:36"/>
grace, and arise to Repentance: For God the Father be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stowed Innocencie and righteousnesse vpon the crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture at the first, by which he might liue. This being lost, God the sonne came to repaire it, and to restore vs to our former estate, and he indeed paid the price of our redemption. But man being in the state of nature could haue no benefit by it. Then came the holy Ghost and regenerated and quickened man, and taught him what Christ had done for him, what is the vertue of his death and passion, yea, the spirit also applieth the bloud of Christ, and by it washeth and purifieth the heart of man, and so sanctifieth both body and soule. Hitherto you see how still as man profiteth not by the former grace, there is yet another person in the Trinitie who by a se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cond worke can make the first effectuall. But now, when it is come to this, that the worke of the spirit is resistell, and impugned, so that these three persons haue giuen him over<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> there is none other meanes for him to reco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver. For to whom should hee goe when these forsake him? Where may he finde a Physitian, if these con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clude his wound is incurable?</p>
               <p>Where are you all you grand Imposters of the world? You strict defenders of the Intercession of Saints and Angels? Now come forth and helpe. Here, here is place for the Indulgences of your Popes, the merits of your Saints, the intercession of your Angels. Here is a man forsaken of God, out of all hope of heauen, can you now cure him? If there be any Deity in your Saints, any Divinitie in your Angels, any hope, any helpe, any me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit, any mercy, any vertue, any power, now let them shew it; Let them recouer this forlorne man out of the gulfe of hell, restore him to his former estate of grace: reforme his will, cure his affections, renew his minde, create a right spirit within him, in a word vendicate him from everlasting perdition, and destruction.

(least of all) euill; so the more excellent that the good is which it opposeth, the more exorbitant is it and abho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minable. When as therefore the affection that should keepe vs from evill, is perverted to keep vs from good: When this peruerted affection is directed, nay, vomi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted forth against God, his Church, his truth, his seruants, those that professe the name of Iesus: how wicked, how pestilent is this alienation? What hope of pardon can there be to such a one? Or which way might one deuise to care him? Though the disease be dangerous, yet if the Patient be willing to be healed, haue an affectionate loue to his Physitian, there may bee some hope: But when hee groweth to be peevish, loatheth his foode, quarrels with his friends, hateth his Physitian, resisteth his Physicke, who can helpe it if he goe to his graue, &amp; that speedily? So here, when man growes to this passe that he crucifieth againe the sonne of God, trampleth vnder-foote the bloud of the new Testament, doth de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>spight to the spirit of grace, and thus professeth himselfe an open enemy, and adversary: What can remaine, but a fearefull looking for of judgement, and violent fire, which shall devoure the adversaries?</p>

               <p>Some there are, which make a nice distinction be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>twixt Totall and Finall recidivation: and I deny not, but the termes are different: but experience teacheth, and the Scripture confirmeth, that in substance they are not much different. For where there is a Totall, there is also a finall losse of grace. Witnesse the euill Angels who hauing once totally lost their grace, haue lost it for euer. Witnesse <hi>Adam,</hi> who hauing once lost <hi>Originall righteousnesse</hi> totally, lost it also finally: God indeede doth sanctifie particular persons, but not the <hi>Humane nature</hi> in generall any more.

               <p>You haue heard the nature of the sinne which pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ueth it to be irrecouerable.

Not the plenary penalty of it, but the praeparatiue; not that which hereafter is to be ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pected, but some of that which in this life is executed and inflicted: So much of it I meane as conducteth to this end, to proue it to be Irremissible.</p>

For to what cause should they be denyed the Churches prayers, which are many times a meanes to worke repentance in men, and to procure pardon for them, but onely because God doth not entend to haue any mercy on them?

               <p>The <hi>Assumption</hi> also is as cleare, for notwithstanding the false Interpretation of the Iesuits, yet it hath beene prooued before that these words of S. <hi>Iohn, I say not that thou shouldest pray for it,</hi> are a direct prohibition, inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dicting and forbidding any prayers to be made for him that sinneth vnto death.

Secondly, nor handled his owne cause. Thirdly, nor was inflamed with inconsiderate and rash zeale. So iust we doe.</p>
               <p>In the practise of Anathematizing, and Imprecation,<note place="margin">What is to be obserued in Imprecation.</note> there must be obserued: First, <hi>The person accursing,</hi> that he be a man of knowledge, wisedome, and discretion; that so he may wisely vnderstand the condition of the person to be accursed, the spirit that moueth him, the end which he propoundeth to himselfe, and the time when he is to doe or not to doe it.

               <p>To shut vp this point, since now the gift of discerning spirits, which was in the Apostolicall Church, is gone, and men haue their zeale mingled with much choller, stomacke, anger and hatred, therefore it is good: First, to vse only a generall forme of Imprecation contayned in the Scripture, against all incurable enemies, and so leaue the application of it to God, whose hand will find out all those who hate him; and not as the custome of the<note n="e" place="margin">Mentioned by <hi>Calum</hi> in his Commone in <hi>Psal.</hi> 109<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> 6.</note>

The wrath and iudgement of God, who hath thus appointed that they, who doe sinne against the holy Ghost,</hi> id est, <hi>willingly, doe fall from, and doe oppose the doctrine of the Gospell, should be giuen vp to a Reprobate minde, and barred from all Repentance:</hi> So that the peruersenesse of the Deuills will, proceedeth not simply from the Immobility of their Nature; but from the wrath of God, and his iust iudgement, who for that their sinne<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> hath so forsaken them, that, whereas of themselues, they are neuer able to repent, now they neuer shall returne to God, nor euer change their will.</p>
               <p>The same is the case of these men, they hardned their hearts before, and would not heare; now God doth<note place="margin">How God doth harden their hearts.</note> harden their hearts, as he did <hi>Pharaohs,</hi> that they may not be moued from their opinion: partly by Satan whom he commandeth to tempt, yea to rule in them,
<pb n="58" facs="tcp:1546:42"/>
yea, to possesse them with the spirit of madnesse: God neyther strengthening against him, nor any whit weak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning the power of Satan; and hence at the length pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceedeth that setled purpose in man, neuer to Repent, but obstinately to continue in his malicious persecuting and blaspheming, into which, certainely I beleeue, man could not slip, before this iudiciall act of God hath pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceeded thus against him.</p>
               <p>The last, and mayne reason, for the Irremissiblenesse<note place="margin">Impanitency.</note> of this sinne, is their wilfull impaenitency which speedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly followeth vpon their hardnesse of heart: They can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not, they will not Repent, and this is the chiefe reason. For the Scripture saith not that it is <hi>Impossible that they should be forgiuen,</hi> for there is mercy store in God, and merit sufficient in Christ to purchase pardon for it, vp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on Repentance, but <hi>It is impossible that they should be re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>newed by Repentance,</hi> and why impossible? First, they are punished with finall blindnesse, and hardnesse of heart. Secondly, they will not, they refuse it. Third<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, Repentance is wrought by the Spirit. Fourthly, grounded on the death of Christ, which they cast off: So that it is impossible that euer they should Repent, and, consequently, impossible that they should be for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>giuen, but remaine guilty of an <note n="g" place="margin">

               <p>If any should obiect the example of <hi>Esau,</hi> who see<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med exceeding paenitent, and shed many teares: Or of <hi>Iudas,</hi> who as the Text sayth, <hi>When he saw what was done repented himselfe.</hi> The answere is ready, first, <hi>In generall,</hi> For that was no true conuersion or repentance, but it was an argument of that anxiety and trouble of mind, which now in their extremitie did presse vpon them, causing them indeed to looke at that which in their se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>curitie they had neglected. Neither indeed did they implore and desire it, but howle and cry for the losse of it, or for the feare of the future punishment. Secondly,
<pb n="59" facs="tcp:1546:42"/>
In particular: <hi>Esau</hi> sought not repentance with teares, he found no place for that: but he sought <note n="h" place="margin">So readeth the <hi>Geneuab</hi> Translation, therby helping the vnderstan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding of the place: for should the Relatiue <gap reason="foreign">

                        </gap>.</hi> Whether of both these wee take, it skilleth not much: it is certaine that by Repentance is not meant a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny sorrow of mind in <hi>Esau.</hi>
                  </note> 
                  <hi>it, id est,</hi> the blessing, a matter of no moment with yelling &amp; how<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling, to seeke for the blessing without true repentance: Sorry for the losse, not for the cause of the losse: But had he bestowed those teares, those cryings in seeking a place for repentance and sorrow for his sinne, then might he perhaps haue found that that he sought for and desired.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Iudas</hi> also indeed repented, as sayth the Text, <hi>id est,</hi> did something that a <hi>Repenting man would doe,</hi> he brought againe his ill gotten goods: but his behauiour, and the event shewed that this was no true repentance. For why did he not ioyne himselfe to the Apostles? Why did he not labour to be reconciled to the Church? Why did he <note n="i" place="margin">Aug. de Serm. Dom. in Monte.</note> sooner runne of desperation to the rope, and hang himselfe, then of humility to aske pardon? These are no tokens of Repentance, but of an Impae<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nitent and desperate minde.</p>
               <p>Truth it is indeede, that he confessed his fault, and cleered the Innocency of Christ, and thereby in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed did aggravate his owne sinne: and herein I per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>swade my selfe he shewed greater signes of Repentance than euer since did any such Apostata: But giue mee leaue to put this <hi>Quaere, Whether,</hi> there were not some speciall occasion which wrung these words from <hi>Iu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>das?</hi> This we know, that as the Lord Iesus was inno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cent in very deed, so it was fitting that his innocencie should be sufficiently testified. Whence it came that nothing could be proued against him, the witnesses were detected, the accusers agreed not: <hi>Pilate</hi> percei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ued that for enuie the high Priests had deliuered him vp to him, and therefore proclaimed him innocent: <hi>Pi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lates</hi> wife also being admonished in a Dreame, did giue the like testimony of him. So that now <hi>Iudas</hi> onely remained of all them who had an hand in betraying Christ, and on whom a suspition might rest, that hee
<pb n="90" facs="tcp:1546:43"/>
knew more by Christ than any of the other, in that hee was his Disciple, and daily conuersant with him, and so might be thought to haue sufficient cause to doe that which hee did: Wherefore to the end that nothing might bee wanting: I take it, as <hi>Iudas</hi> like <hi>Balaam</hi> to blesse the people, so he to witnesse this poynt of inno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cency, rather enforced by the over-ruling prouidence of God, than voluntarily mooved.</p>
               <p>And this seemeth to mee to haue beene the occasion of that fact of <hi>Iudas:</hi> which seemeth to perswade vs of his Popish repentance, in contrition, confession, and satisfaction. Thus haue you heard the reasons for the second maine point deliuered, which proue it (and I hope sufficiently) both, that it is &amp; euer shal be irremissi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble; as being a sinne against the Gospell, and against the spirit; being a witting, wilfull, malicious, totall Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stasie: punished, and that iustly, with deprivation of the Churches prayers, with <hi>Imprecations, Hardnesse of heart and finall Impaenitencie.</hi>

                  <hi>But if the Lord shall</hi> (<hi>as it were</hi>) <hi>with his finger point forth such an offendor, then this place of</hi> Iohn <hi>teacheth vs what to doe in such a case,</hi> viz. <hi>we must not pray for him.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>So then the whole answere. I suppose may be thus de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clared. 1. For matter of Imprecation, we are to obserue all the cautions that were before mentioned, and not suffer our selues to be drawne to that in particular. Nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther doe I hold it fitting, even in the vrging of these common <hi>Anathema's,</hi> mentioned in Scripture, to haue any priuate intention. 2. For praetermitting such in our prayers, this precept might most happily bee obserued, when the gift of discerning spirits was in the Church. 3. Though we cannot obsolutely determine and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clude, that such a one hath sinned thus desperately, yet may we haue sufficient ground for a strong coniecture, which may suffice to cause vs to passe ouer such in our particular prayers, and to leaue them to God. Neither are we to be blamed (though wee should erre in this poynt) since that our end is good, and his sinne deser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ueth such a punishment, and wee can haue no Faith to pray for him.</p>
               <p>Still the first question, How these may bee discerned doth rest vnsatisfied. To which I answere, that abso<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lutely to determine of such a one is very difficult, nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther is there any sufficient marke, but the event, <hi>viz.</hi> Fi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nall impaenitency: But the grounds of suspition are such as these.</p>
               <p>First, <hi>Prophanenesse,</hi> which kicketh and spurneth a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainst<note place="margin">The ground<gap reason="illegible" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap> of strong con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iecture.</note> all the workes of the Spirit, all duties of holinesse, no grace, no thanksgiuing, no humiliation, not a good word, but this mans dislike is seene, yea, such a dislike as manifesteth an heart full fraught with malice, choa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king and damming vp all passages of Grace, thus plaine<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly doth he professe his cankered heart, and spitefull ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lice
<pb n="64" facs="tcp:1546:45"/>
against the spirit of Grace.</p>
               <p>Secondly, when a man reioyceth not in any one truth reuealed in the Scripture, concerning the sal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uation of man, but rather doth question it, doubt of it; yea, to his power, doth impugne and resist it.</p>
               <p>Thirdly, enuying the grace and happinesse in which another standeth: It was a bad signe in <hi>Kaen,</hi> who en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uied his brother, because the Lord accepted the Sacri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fice of <hi>Abel</hi> rather than his: But it was a worse signe in <hi>Saul,</hi> who knowing that <hi>Dauid</hi> was the man in whom the kingdome should be established, did fret and grudge, murmur and repine against it, labouring by all meanes, to ouerthrow the decree of God. So when men come to that passe, that, hauing receiued in them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selues, the seale of Gods curse euerlasting vpon their soules, they cannot endure to heare that any should fare better then they doe, but rather wish that all might with them be damned, it is a shrewde signe of an Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stata.</p>
               <p>Fourthly, Blasphemy against God, whom hee ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teth and accuseth as an vniust Iudge, in that the Lord hath giuen him vp to the power and dominion of Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>than.</p>
               <p>Fiftly, want of good affections, when hee neyther loueth good, nor desireth it, but rather continueth in a violent hatred and malice against God, the which also breaketh forth against those who labour his good, his conuersion, his saluation; whom he cannot abide, but hateth and detesteth.</p>
               <p>These are vehement causes of suspition, when a man bewrayeth his malice against the Spirit of Grace, when he impugneth each poynt of the Gospell, when hee pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fesseth an enuying of Grace, and Gods fauour towards any, when he spareth not to blaspheme the God of hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uen, when he is altogether destitute of all good affecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, it is ten to one this mans case is desperate, and I may iustly leaue such an one to the iudgement of God;
<pb n="65" facs="tcp:1546:45"/>
and as to imprecatio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> I dare not proceede, because I may fayle in the vnderstanding of his cause: Yet since I can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not haue faith, nor warrant to be heard, I dare not by name recommend his cause, absolutely, in my prayers and supplications.</p>
               <p>On the contrary side, we may more easily obserue<note place="margin">Persons in whom this sin is not.</note> in whom this our sinne is not. First, being a <hi>generall A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>postasie,</hi> it is not in those who hold fast the foundation, and reioyce in the knowledge of the truth: Much lesse in those, who labour against corruption; least of all, in those who hold on a constant course in holy exercises. These may be in great offences, but of this they are not guilty.</p>
               <p>Secondly, being a <hi>oalicious opposition and persecution</hi> of the truth: It is not in those who hunger and thirst after Righteousnesse, not in those who loue any of the good meanes of Saluation: Much lesse in those who doe loue the brethren for the truths sake.</p>
               <p>Thirdly, being <hi>voluntary,</hi> it is not in them who are afrayde of it; not in those, who albeit, their hearts per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>haps are hardened, yet this disposition of their heart doth not please them: Wherefore let this be the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fort of all poore soules, who are vehemently troubled with this feare, lest they haue thus fallen; They may be ouercome by many weakenesses, but yet into this sinne they are not fallen. Yea, hearken to this, all you that are weary and heauie laden, so long as you stand in feare of falling into it, be assured for your comfort, you are far from it: Wherefore let not the Deuill (busie though he be) perswade you, that so you haue offended, for it is but an <note n="u" place="margin">See <hi>Downam</hi> his Christian Warfare, <hi>part.</hi> 1 <hi>lib.</hi> 3. <hi>c.</hi>
                  </note> illusion, yea, a stratagem of Satan where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by hee laboureth to make shipwrack of your soules.</p>
               <p>Now to stop our Censure: This is not the sinne of such, who neuer attayned to the knowledg of the Truth; neyther Turkes nor Infidels, neyther Atheists nor Epicures, neyther <hi>Pharaoh</hi> nor <hi>Rabshekah,</hi> neyther <hi>Herod</hi> nor <hi>Pylate</hi> did or could euer fall into it: A curse
<pb n="66" facs="tcp:1546:46"/>
indeede and an heauy one, hath gone out against them, and all like to them; bondslaues are they of Satan, and strangers from the Common wealth of Israell; Aliens from the couenant of Grace, but yet an heauier curse is for those who haue sinned this sinne, and far more mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>serable is their estate.</p>
               <p>Secondly, Not of all that fall being constrayned through feare in the time of persecution. Thirdly, No not of all that doe persecute the Truth, vnlesse they be found to carry a malicious minde, against, not only man, but God.</p>
               <p>The next vse is for exhortation, to take heede of<note place="margin">Vse. 2.</note> falling into this; there is no recouery, it is like the lawes of hell, if once man be slipt downe thither, there is <gap reason="foreign">

                  </gap> a great gulfe to hinder all passages of re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turne. Wherefore it is the wisedome of a Christian to to take heede how he traceth in these steps, for the paths thereof are the paths of death.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Quest.</hi> What are the steps and degrees of this de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>scension, by which a man doth decline till hee come to this finall Apostasie?</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Resp.</hi> In the answering of this we are to distinguish, for there are two kindes of this Apostasie, or falling a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>way; not much vnlike to the two kindes of Epilepsy, or falling sicknesse, which the Physitians haue obser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ued: The one, is seated eyther in the brayne, or the heart, and this taketh suddenly, and so suddenly, that wheresoeuer it taketh them it casteth them into the fire, or into the water, bereauing them of all meanes to help themselues: The other beginneth in the externall parts, as in the Armes or Legs, and here by frication it may be stayed, at least wise, some time gayned, that the parties may prouide for their owne security. Euen such is our Apostasy, there is a praecipitation, when a man doth suddenly fall headlong into this sinne, and of this there can be giuen, no signes nor degrees. Of this kinde was the sin of the Angels, who suddenly fell in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to
<pb n="67" facs="tcp:1546:46"/>
this Apostasie, in which they are. There is also a cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tayne Pedetentim, and leasurely declining, so that from one step to another doth a man descend till he come to the gates of death.</p>
               <p>Neyther is this distinction so newly deuised, but that it hath beene disputed in the Schooles. <hi>Aquinas</hi> 
                  <note place="margin">Aquin. 22. 4. 14. Art. 4.</note> a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mong other questions of this subiect, moueth this. Whether a man may (<hi>primo</hi>) at the first, fall into this, and sinne against the holy Ghost? He is a Schooleman and his answere is not to seeke; his answere is this. That two wayes may a man sin against the holy Ghost.

                     </gap>.</note> by a wilfull reiecting of that, by which he might bee kept from sinne; and of this he saith that, howsoeuer it doth most an end praesuppose former sinnes (viz. that men walke in the counce<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ll of the vngodly, and stand in the way of sinners, before they sit downe in the seate of the Scornefull) yet he affirmeth, that it is possible, that at the first a man may thus sinne; and that (saith he) for one or all of these causes. First, for the freedome of his will. Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>condly, for many praeceding dispositions. Thirdly, for some great motiue. Fourthly, for the weakenesse of affection to that that is good: Whereupon he inferreth that this hardly or neuer befalleth those who haue at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tayned to any good perfection, according to the saying of <note n="z" place="margin">Non arbitr<gap reason="illegible" extent="1 letter">

                  <hi>Origen,</hi> in briefe his answere is this, that against the holy Ghost by finall Impaenitency, man cannot sinne at the first, but to this he commeth, by a long series, and order of precedent sinnes; but by contempt and reie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cting of those <note n="a" place="margin">What these meanes are, is declared <hi>pag.</hi> 6</note> meanes of Grace which should keepe men from falling, as also by blaspheming the Spirit of Grace, he may. Wherefore, since we haue reiected his final Impenitency (wherin notwithstanding to the pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pose of the minde, though not to the extent of the act, he alloweth a praesentany lapse) not alowing it to be a

species of this sinne, and only doe allow the other two branches, viz. a malicious and contemptuous abnegati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of the truth, and reiection of the Sacrifice of Christ (the only effectuall meanes to withdraw vs from sinne) together with the blaspheming of the Spirit of Grace.

Adde to this, that by how much their vnderstanding is the better infor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med, so much more free is their will, of a sudden to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liberate what is to be done.</p>
               <p>And if it be safe to instance in particulars, this prae<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cipitation is specially performed by abnegation, and ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iuration of the knowne and professed Truth: For, though all abnegation of the truth be not this sinne, nor doth bring it forth; yet, when a man doth deny and forsweare the Truth, that Truth, which heretofore hee hath prosessed, then many times the Lord doth in iu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stice, giue such an one ouer to hardnesse of heart, and a Reprobate sense: So that hauing fallen from the pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fessing of the Truth, he doth also loose all loue and li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king
<pb n="69" facs="tcp:1546:47"/>
of it, and neuer aspireth to any loue of the same a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gaine, and who knoweth not, that, howsoeuer the Lord had mercy vpon <hi>Peter,</hi> yet hee was in the ready way vpon that his abiuration?</p>
               <p>Now for the other kinde of Apostasie, which by steps declineth and from one degree falleth to another giue me leaue to put here a <hi>Quare,</hi> whether it may not bee thus described?</p>
               <p>First, he looseth his holinesse, and sanctity of life,<note place="margin">Degrees of falling.</note> to which he had attayned, viz. Externall: which <note n="e" place="margin">2 Pet. 2. 20.</note> 
                  <hi>Peter</hi> calleth the escaping of the filthinesse of the World, This is the last steppe to which he commeth; and that hee commeth to this, the zeale <note n="f" place="margin">2 Kin. 10. 16.</note> of <hi>Iehu,</hi> the <note n="g" place="margin">Mar. 6. 20.</note> reue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rence of <hi>Herod,</hi> the Repentance of <note n="h" place="margin">Ion. 3. 5. 6.</note> Nineueh, the <note n="i" place="margin">1 Sam. 28. 3.</note> re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formation of <hi>Saule,</hi> the goodnesse <note n="k" place="margin">2 Chro. 24. 2.</note> of king <hi>Ioash,</hi> doe plainely shew; here he beginneth to fall, loosing this, the which is done by deceitefulnesse of sin, which ouertaketh and beguileth him with profit or pleasure, or by some other meanes.</p>
               <p>Then doth God in Iustice giue him ouer to Sathan to be hardned in heart, that so the meanes of saluation cannot worke vpon him, Sathan hauing this power giuen him, worketh effectually, prompting and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sinuating into his heart (as hee did into the heart of <hi>Pharaoh</hi>) diuers Reasons, why hee should not heare the word, nor feare the threatnings: nor regard the iudgements, tush (saith he) what, haue not the best had their falls? Did not <hi>Peter</hi> deny his Master? <hi>Abra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ham</hi> lie? <hi>Dauid</hi> commit adultery? And <hi>Lot</hi> incest? The Righteous, doth he not fall seauen times a day, and yet riseth againe? Was not the repentance of the theef effectuall to his saluation? Knowest thou not that at <hi>what time soeuer a sinner doth repent him of his sinne,</hi> hee shall surely liue? Thus doth he lull the man asleepe, yea, hee sends him like <hi>Ionah</hi> to the bottome of the shippe to sleepe, ouerwhelmeth him with security.</p>
               <p>Secondly, Hereupon he becommeth peruerse, and fro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward,
<pb n="70" facs="tcp:1546:48"/>
and backward to goodnesse, growing into a dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>like, an hatred against it. Nay, taketh occasion (like <hi>Pharaoh</hi> vpon the speech of <hi>Moses</hi> to afflict the Israe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lites, so he) by the Ministers admonition and reproofe to be more perverse and froward: And <note n="l" place="margin">Sicut ignis quanto amplius ligna susceperit in majorem fla<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
                     <g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mam erigitur: sic anima mala quanto magis veritatem au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dierit, eo ampli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>us in malitiam excitatur. Chrysost. in Math. 22.</note> as the fire by the heaping of wood encreaseth the flame: So this mind encreaseth in wickednesse, by how much the more it heareth the word of truth. Thus <hi>Iudas</hi> covetous by na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, being reproued by Christ, proceedeth further to betray his Master. If he cannot finger the box of oint<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment to make money of that, he will sell his Master, and make money of him. Thus hee proceedeth in mis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chiefe.</p>
               <p>Vpon this God taketh away the joy that he had be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore: For before this he ioyed in his knowledge, <note n="m" place="margin">Mat. 13. 20.</note>

This God taketh away from him, he being vnworthie of it in respect of his vnholy and wicked life: For his conscience telleth him, that hee hath neither part nor portion in it.</p>
               <p>Thirdly, Then doth he willingly cast away the faith which he had, <hi>viz.</hi> a Temporary one, as appeareth <hi>Mat.</hi> 13. 21. which includeth an historicall knowledge, with a confused application. This hee doth willingly cast away, neither doth he hold and professe any fun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>damentall point of the Gospell, because the Scripture hath reuealed it: For when he cannot find the truth of it himselfe, <hi>viz.</hi> That the precious promises doe bring such ioy and comfort as he heareth deliuered, presently he calleth into question whether there be such or not, yea, and concludeth with the prophane <note n="n" place="margin">

And thereupon counteth the bloud of the new Testament an vnholy thing, meerely deriding and mocking those, who ascribe so much vnto it: and for himselfe is an vt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter enemy to the same.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="71" facs="tcp:1546:48"/>Hereupon doth God iustly confound his knowledge, darkning his cogitation, blinding his mind, and his vnderstanding, that seeing he would not vse that know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge that he had, he shall loose much of it, or at least be confounded in it: And indeed how can it bee but that euen his knowledge should much decay, since neyther God blesseth it, nor he vseth meanes to keepe it?</p>
               <p>Fourthly, He doth now voluntarily fall away euen from that ciuill honesty which the light of nature doth teach men: willingly wallowing in all manner of wic<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kednesse and pollution with greedinesse: not without spite and malice, seeking hereby (if it were possible) to be reuenged of God, who hath reiected him, still by his vitious and abhominable life, prouoking him to an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger, thus despiting the spirit of grace.</p>
               <p>Whereupon the Lord doth presse his conscience with feare and terror, affecting it with the sensible feeling of Gods heauy wrath vpon his soule: yea, euen setting him forth as a vessell prepared for destruction: causing his soule and conscience to witnesse so much against him, and at certaine times making him to feele most horrible terrors and convulsions.</p>
               <p>Fiftly, Then growes he to impenitency, to fretting, to murmuring and reluctation against God, maliciously opposing himselfe against his Maiesty: yea, hating him whom he can conceiue none otherwise then a righteous judge to condemne him. Hence it commeth, saith<note place="margin">

<pb n="72" facs="tcp:1546:49"/>
but onely breaketh forth into blasphemous, and reui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling speeches against the Almightie.</p>
               <p>Then at the last doth God set the brand of destructi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on vpon him, taking from him all hope of pardon, and so leauing him to Sathan to be brought home by finall Impaenitencie, and desperation, to finall destruction.</p>
               <p>Thus we see from the beginning to the ending, there<note place="margin">Correllar.</note> is (as it were) a certaine Reluctation and striuing of the creature against the Creator, seeking still to goe beyond God, and from one point to another, to despite and malice him and his iust proceedings.</p>

               <p>1. <hi>Saul</hi> looseth his holinesse of life.

               <p>Then God giueth him vp to the euill spirit, who wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>keth vpon him, indeed strangely, but effectually, dri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving him into many strange and vncot<gap reason="illegible" extent="3 letters">

               <p>The punishment of this hath euident confirmation, For how bitterly &amp; sorely did the Lord presse his con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>science, especially, when <note n="*" place="margin">1 Sam. 28. 5.</note> he saw the host of the Phili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stims, and at such time as the Lord denyed to answere him eyther by <hi>Urim,</hi> or by Prophets: as also when Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tan in the person of <hi>Samuell</hi> did reckon vp his faults, and prophecie his destruction.

Not in respect of the exter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nall signe, (though many did looke no further) but in the same as a type of the euer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lasting kingdome of the Messiah. Last of all, note this, that when the ten Tribes, did rouolt from the house of <hi>Dauid,</hi> and chose <hi>Ieroboam</hi> King, they are dealt withall, (<hi>Hos.</hi> 1.) as with an adulterous woman: The matter is this: God had set vp his King, vpon the holy hill of <hi>Zion,</hi> that is, establisht the kingdome in the house of <hi>Dauid.</hi> And had by this meanes, tyed the house of Israell to that family, from the which they might not depart, without manifest reiecting the Ordinance of God. By all which it is manifest that <hi>Daud</hi> was a type of Christ, and his kingdome a type of Christes kingdome, and the Rejectors and persecutors of him, the persecutors of Christ.</note> Now it is euident, that <hi rend="sup">a</hi> 
                  <hi>Dauid</hi> was a type of Christ, and his kingdome a type of the kingdome of Christ. And the outward saluatio which the people did receiue from
<pb n="76" facs="tcp:1546:51"/>
                  <hi>Dauid</hi> was a type of the spirituall saluation performed by the Messiah. Yea, all the hope of deliuerance, was to be expected, according to the Lords ordinance, from that family. Yea (which is more) the faithfull also did know so much, <hi>Lam.</hi> 4. 20. Moreouer, it is worth the noting, that after the anoynting of <hi>Dauid, Saul</hi> of him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selfe did obtaine no notable victory: but eyther <hi>Dauid</hi> was the principall, as in the battell with <hi>Goliah:</hi> or the sole Agent, as when he was <hi>Sauls</hi> Captaine: Yea, once in the time of his troubles he saued <hi>Keilah,</hi> and chased the <hi>Philistims.</hi> For else <hi>Saul</hi> fought no battell till the last, which he lost: Indeed it is mentioned that<note n="b" place="margin">1. Sam. 23. 28</note> 
                  <hi>Saul</hi> went against the <hi>Philistims,</hi> at what time he was vpon the poynt to take <hi>Dauid,</hi> but there is no mention made of <hi>Sauls</hi> preuailing against them. Further it may seeme that by a common fame and speech of the people, <hi>Dauid</hi> was accounted the King, from whom the <hi>Philistims</hi> had heard it, and thereupon reported to <hi>Achish,</hi>
                  <note n="c" place="margin">1. Sam. 21. 11.</note> 
                  <hi>is not this Dauid the King of the Land?</hi> And certainely it is not vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>likely but that the best men did depend vpon him as their King, and therefore when <hi>Keilah</hi> is in danger, they come to him, not to <hi>Saul.</hi> Neither was this vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>knowne to <hi>Saul,</hi> who, by his<note n="d" place="margin">1. Sam. 24. 21</note> owne confession knew that <hi>Dauid</hi> should be King, and that the kingdome of <hi>Israell</hi> should be established in his hand, yea, he prophe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cieth of his preuailing, and prosperous affaires, and therefore exacteth an oath of <hi>Dauid,</hi> that he would not destroy his seed after him, nor abolish his name out of his fathers house.</p>
               <p>So that all this being laid together, it is manifest, I hope, that <hi>Saul</hi> cannot wash his hands of this crime, nor proue himselfe innocent in this fact: but must suffer himselfe to bee ranked with <hi>Iudas, Iulian,</hi> and other wretched Apostata's.</p>
               <p>The blessed Apostle S<hi rend="sup">t</hi>. <hi>Iames</hi> speaking of them, who<note place="margin">Transition.</note> to the naked and destitute of dayly foode, doe say<note n="e" place="margin">Iam. 2. 16.</note>

In respect of both these, remember <hi>Lots wife.</hi> A great sinne, Recidiuation, Apostasie; A great punish<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, present vengeance.

                  <hi>It is a fearefull thing to fall into the hands of the liuing God.</hi> For that ground, which hauing drunke in the rayne that falleth vpon it, beareth nothing but Bryars and Thornes, is reiected, and is nigh vnto cur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sing, whose end is to be burned. <hi>Heb.</hi> 6. 8.</p>
               <p>Secondly, <hi>Grieue not the holy spirit of God, &amp;c.</hi>
                  <note n="*" place="margin">Eph. 4. 30.</note> as did the <note n="k" place="margin">Psay 63. 10. Psal. 95. 10.</note> Israelites in the Wildernesse, fourtie yeeres, least the Lord sweare against you also in his wrath, that you shall not enter into his rest. First, <hi>The spirit of God is the seale of our Redemption,</hi> therefore grieue him not, neyther by neglecting assurance when thou mayst haue it: (<hi>To day if ye will heare, harden not your hearts, to day, while it is called to day, heare his voice</hi>) nor in wilfull doubting of that assu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rance recorded in the word. This spirit, which is the seale of our <hi>Redemption,</hi> is the spirit of God, therefore grieue him not; Of God our Creator, whose glory we are to set forth; Of God our <hi>Redeemer,</hi> who hath enlar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ged our feete out of the snares of Satan; Of God the Iudge and auenger of all those who shall vexe his spirit. Thirdly, <hi>The spirit of God,</hi> is an holy spirit; Holy in his essence; Holy in his operation, therefore grieue him not, neyther by neglecting the duties of holinesse, in hearing the word: For what knowest thou O man, whether euer thou shalt heare it more? And perhaps
<pb n="79" facs="tcp:1546:52"/>
thou mightst at that time haue hard that, that might haue done thee good for euer. Not by resisting, or at lest, not listening to the good motions w<hi rend="sup">ch</hi> the spirit doth put in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to thine heart, much lesse by wilfull falling into any sin! O take great heede of this, for what knowest thou (wretched man) whether euer thou shalt come out of the same againe? Thou hast not Repentance in thine owne hand; yea, what knowest thou whether this bee not the first steppe that thou steppest on to finall Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stalie.</p>
               <p>Thirdly, <hi>Holding faith and a good Conscience,</hi> In which<note place="margin">1 Tim. 1. 19.</note> words the Apostle doth exhort <hi>Timothy</hi> to stand manful<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly against all lets and impediments, and being called to the ministery, to fight a good fight, <hi>id est,</hi> to bee vigilant and diligent in his office; vigilant, to watch against all enemies; diligent, to expell them: And not without cause doth he thus stirre vp <hi>Timothy,</hi> for the office of the ministery is a kinde of warfare, in which Sathan, He<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reticks, Schismaticks, lewde-liuers, and false brethren doe in hostile manner oppose the Church of God; A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainst all which, the Ministers, who are the Ancient<note place="margin">Antesignani &amp; duces, Calu.</note> bearers and Captaines, must oppose themselues. Now that he may the better make resistance, and performe the office of his Ministery with ioy, the Apostle sheweth with what armour it is fit that he should bee furnished, viz. Faith, and a good Conscience. Faith, that is to say, wholsome doctrine, which, <hi>cap.</hi> 3. 9. he calleth the mistery of Faith, the mistery of godlinesse, that is, the doctrine of the Gospell, which must bee kept in a pure Conscience. And certainely those two are wonderfull requisite in a Minister; Faith, and a good Conscience, nor are they of lesse consequence for euery Christian. I can compare them to nothing so well, as to a precious pearle, and a rich carquenet, both must bee regarded. Faith, the doctrine of the Gospell, the forme of whol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>some words; a rich pearle, an incomparable treasure, better than thousands of gold and siluer, wherfore how
<pb n="80" facs="tcp:1546:53"/>
much ought we to feare lest it should bee taken from vs? For what is this wholsome doctrine, but like the starre that led the wisemen to Christ, which when they lost, into what by paths were they driuen, and how much trouble ere they found it againe? So here keepe the patterne of wholsome words, and it will guide you in the right way, suffering you to decline neyther to the right hand nor to the left, neyther to suspition nor to prophanenesse, neyther to Schismes and Heresies, nor to Atheisme and Epicurisme. This is the precious pearle. The rich Carquenet is a good Conscience, a pure Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>science; in this must we keepe Faith, else it will bee lost. For whence commeth it that so many continually doe reiect the truth, and fall into wicked sects and damna<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble heresies, but because they were not carefull to keepe the sound doctrine in a pure Conscience? and therefore God iustly punished their hypocriticall dealing with this iudgement, sending them strong delusions, that they should beleeue lies, who delighted not in the Truth<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> Two fearefull examples doth <hi>Paul</hi> here alleadge, of two men who casting away the Carquenet, lost also the Pearle; putting away a good Conscience, as concerning Faith, made shipwrack, <hi>id est,</hi> were quite depriued of it: For (saith <hi>Beza</hi>) they who keep not a good Conscience doe also by little and little, loose the gift of vnderstan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding. Wherefore loe here another excellent meanes to preuent Apostasie, <hi>Hold Faith,</hi> depart not from it, for whatsoeuer is not of Faith is sinne; keepe a good Conscience vnspotted vndefiled, transgresse not against that, keepe the forme of godlinesse and deny not the power thereof: As we professe to know God, so in workes deny him not; for what is the end of the Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mandement, but loue out of a pure heart, and of a good Conscience, and of Faith vnfayned?</p>
               <p>But amongst all the parts of holy Scripture, there is not any one booke, so well furnished with variety of exhortation, tending to stirre men vp to perseuerance,
<pb n="81" facs="tcp:1546:53"/>
and to take off reuolting, as the Epistle to the Hebrews, wherein the Author doth <hi>hoc agere,</hi> in a manner ayme at nothing else, wherefore whatsoeuer prescripts of Phi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sick I haue else to giue, shall thence be deducted.<note place="margin">

Three reasons, I suppose, may be giuen, why <hi>Paul</hi> instanceth rather in Fornication, for the second Table, than any other sinne. First, Our bodies are the Temples of the holy Ghost, and fornication is a sinne against a mans owne body, by this then, should the habitation of the holy Ghost be defiled, his Temple prophaned, yea, and himselfe driuen forth by our vncleanenesse, and pollution. Secondly, Fornication is a sinne of a plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sing nature, to voluptuous persons, and they who place happinesse in pleasure, doe most easily yeelde to this sin, and hauing once yeelded, it is so clammy, that, like pitch or birdlime, it sticketh and cleaueth to them; and so cleaueth, that it rather brings them to renounce the Gospell, and the doctrine of it, then to giue ouer this filthinesse and vncleanenesse. Thirdly, Fornication found in any member of the Church, is such a sinne, as may not be tolerated in the congregation without ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nifest danger of infection, so that in necessity the Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gregation must proceede to excommunication <note n="n" place="margin">

A good Caueat for hypocrites, who desire not sinceritie, but onely make a faire outward shew, to please the world, They loue the prayse of men more then the prayse of God; Certainly these men are all of them subiect to this sinne, and may as well come to it as <hi>Iudas, Iulian,</hi> or any of the rest, <note n="y" place="margin">

               <p>First, You heard the explanation of the Text, by ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>seruing the terme vsed, and the number insinuated. Then did I propound the two maine parts of my Dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>course, wherein, first, I sought out the sinne what it was, secondly, Searched it, to see why incurable? In the dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quisition, hauing found it to bee the sinne against the holy Ghost, wee passed by those sixe kindes reckned by the Schoolemen, and prooved by Argument, both in generall against them all, and in particular against each, that no one of them is that sinne which we sought for. The which at the length was defined to be <hi>a generall A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>postasie of a man fallen from the knowne Truth, euen to a ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>licious persecution, and blaspheming of the same;</hi> the which words I reduced to three heads, first, <hi>The whence, viz.</hi> from the knowne truth, <hi>The truth of the Gospell, not of the Law.</hi> Secondly, <hi>The whether,</hi> to a malicious persecuting and blaspheming. Thirdly, <hi>The motion,</hi> a voluntary and vniuersall <hi>Apostasie.</hi> In searching the deadlinesse of the
<pb n="86" facs="tcp:1546:56"/>
wound, I found it to be therefore called a sinne vnto death, because it is irremissible. The which was confir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med by Scripture, and reason. Reason drawne, first, From the Obiect, it being a sinne against the Gospell, and against the spirit. Secondly, From the nature of it, In that it doth <hi>wittingly, willingly, maliciously, totally</hi> op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pugne and resist the meanes of pardon. Thirdly, From the punishment of it, it being depriued of the Chur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ches prayers, and rewarded with Imprecation by men, Hardnesse of heart by God, and Impaenitency by it selfe. The Vse of all was, First, For examination and tryall, where were discouered certaine grounds of sus<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pition, causing a man iustly to be suspected for an Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stata. Secondly, For admonition and exhortation, to take heede of it, where also were described the degrees by which man relapseth into this sinne, and also now lastly some Preseruatiues were prescribed to keepe men from <hi>Apostasie</hi> and <hi>Recidiuation.</hi> In all which discourse, might I bee so happie, as to haue neither troubled your patience with things impertinent, nor to haue praeter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitted ought that was necessary; <hi>Salomon</hi> in all his roy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>altie could not finde more contentment then I in mine endeuours. But if I haue beene too prolixe, impute it to the matter, if too concise, impute it to the time: Howsoeuer, let God be glorified, that man may bee comforted. Now vnto him that <hi>is able to keepe vs that we fall not, and to present vs blamelesse before the pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sence of his glory with ioy:</hi> that is, to God one<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly wise our Sauiour, bee glory, and ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iestie, and dominion, and power, both now, and for ever.</p>
