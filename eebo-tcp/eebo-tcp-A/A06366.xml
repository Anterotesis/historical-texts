         <editorialDecl>
            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

doubt not, but that in the ſequel
of thoſe proceedings vvhich
haue paſſed, ſince the death of
the late King Our moſt hono<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red
Lord, and Father, you haue euidently ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeru'd,
how Marſhall <hi>D' Ancre</hi> and his wife, a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>buſing
Our minoritie, and the power which of
long time hee poſſeſſed with the Queene our
<pb facs="tcp:9299:3"/>
moſt honoured Lady and Mother, did practice
to vſurpe the whole authoritie of our State, to
diſpoſe abſolutely of all affaires, and to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mooue
all meanes, from our comming to the
knowledge or vnderſtanding thereof; A diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeigne
which they ſo wrought and effected,
that hitherto Wee carried but onely the bare
Name, and title of a King: They condemning
it as a capitall crime in any of our Officers or
Subiects (when they did viſite vs in particular)
to entertaine vs with any ſerious diſcourſe.
Which God of his infinite bountie giuing Vs
the grace at laſt to diſcerne, and pointing out
vnto Vs as it were with his omnipotent finger,
the imminent perill that hung ouer Our per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon,
and State, through ſuch an inſatiable and
irregular ambition; Wee gaue teſtimonie at
length of our apprehenſion in this point, and
of the ſingular deſire Wee had, to take requi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſite
and due order for the ſame: Yet were Wee
enforced in all our exterior actions, to diſguiſe
and couer that, which inwardly in heart Wee
determin'd and reſolued vpon, while it might
pleaſe the ſame our good GOD to open Vs a
fit way, and conuenient opportunitie, to ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ply
thereunto ſome preualent remedy. Vpon
<pb facs="tcp:9299:3"/>
theſe intentions, not many daies ſince, it fel out,
that ſundry perſons, both of Our capitall Citie
of Paris, as alſo others of diuerſe parts of Our
Kingdome, taking occaſion, of the ſaid Mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhall
<hi>D' Ancre</hi> his abſence (who was gone into
Normandie, vvith a deliberation there to ſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iourne
for ſome time) addreſſed them-ſelues
to the Queene Our ſaid Lady &amp; Mother, and
to ſuch Miniſters as the ſaid Marſhall and his
wife had eſtabliſhed, (who vnder them, at their
will and pleaſure, ſhould carry and ſway all pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceedings
within this State) and effectually layd
open their reaſons to them, why it was moſt
neceſſary and expedient, that Wee our ſelfe
ſhould readily and ſeriouſly aſſume the ſole
Adminiſtration of our weightie affaires; other<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe,
that our Realme which now began to riſe
and reuolt in all parts by meanes of this vvant
and defect, could not auoyde an abſolute and
lamentable ſubuerſion.</p>
            <p>Whereof Marſhall <hi>D' Ancre</hi> hauing been ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uertiſed,
and returning with all expedition, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gan
to employ his power and policy, not one<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
to ſtop the courſe of theſe prouident pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſitions
and ouertures, as repugnant to his
owne ends, but further he reſolued to depriue
<pb facs="tcp:9299:4"/>
Our ſelfe of all meanes to put them in practice,
by certain counſells and courſes, which I think
yet more fit to conceale, than publiſh. All
which being comne to Our perfect vnderſtan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding
and notice, and conſidering that beſides
the danger of Our perſon, the mortall hatred
that almoſt all our good ſubiects and ſeruants
did beare towards the vſurped and inſolent au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thority
and gouernement of theſe people,
would in ſuch ſort exaſperate, and obdurate,
the mindes of men within Our kingdome, as it
would be in danger to growe to an vnquench<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able
flame and combuſtion:</p>
            <p>Moued I ſay, by theſe iuſt, and moſt weigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie
conſiderations, &amp; by the heauenly inſtinct,
that God vpon this occaſion put into Our
heart: Wee reſolued to ſecure Our ſelfe of the
perſon of the ſaide Marſhall <hi>D' Ancre,</hi> giuing
expreſſe charge to <hi>Sieur de Vitry</hi> Captaine of
Our Guards, to apprehend and arreſt him
within Our Caſtle of the Louure. The which
Our pleaſure hee intending to put in execu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion,
the ſaid Marſhall (who according to his
accuſtomed manner, had many followers a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout
him) himſelfe with ſome other of his com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pany,
made offer to reſiſt: wherupon, certaine
<pb facs="tcp:9299:4"/>
bullets were diſcharged; of which ſome light
on the ſaid Marſhall, ſo as hee remain'd dead
vpon the place.</p>
            <p>Afterwards, Wee cauſed his wife to be ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reſted,
and alſo his aboue mentioned Miniſters;
hauing furthermore entreated the Queene
Our ſaide Lady and Mother, to bee con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tent
that from thenceforward, We might take
the gouernement of Our State into Our owne
hands, and ſo labour to diuert from it thoſe
extreamities and miſeries, whereinto it hath
beene plunged, by the ſiniſter counſels which
ſhee formerly had made vſe of. The accom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pliſhment
of which buſineſſe Wee hope, God
of his gratious goodnes will the more readily
grant Vs, in that all our intentions haue no o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
ayme or ſcope, but his glorie, and the
good of Our ſubiects. Which We thought good
to aduertiſe you of, to the end you may make
it knowne through all your precincts; adding
to theſe formerly ſpecified, any other reaſons
you ſhall thinke fit and conuenient, for con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taining
euery man within the bounds of obe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dience
and dutie; Taking vigilant care, that
none may riſe, or mutine, within Our ſaid ter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritories,
&amp; that nothing may diſturb the peace,
<pb facs="tcp:9299:5"/>
and quiet, which We deſire to haue maintain'd.
But if there be any that haue Complaints, or
Requeſts to make, let them bee aſſured, that if
they repaire to Vs, by thoſe mediations and
waies, that ſubiects ought to vſe, when they
would petition to their King, they ſhall al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>waies
find Vs enclining to whatſoeuer ſtandeth
with reaſon, or iuſtice.</p>
            <p>This Action hath here beene ſo approued
and allowed, that here is nothing but applauſe,
and euery mans benediction vpon Vs for the
ſame, becauſe We attempted it in ſo due and
neceſſarie a time: and We hope it will receiue
no leſſe approbation in other places. In the
meane while, Wee haue writ to all our Lieu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tenants,
and Generalls of our Armies, to keep
them ſtill afoot, that if occaſion ſerue, We may
imploy them againſt thoſe, that will not ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>knowledge
