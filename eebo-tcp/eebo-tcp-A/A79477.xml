            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

For this end and purpoſe, I made an humble Motion to you, that you would ſeriouſly conſider what Points we muſt ſtand upon, and what Errours we muſt Proteſt againſt, that ſo there might be a more speciall and punctuall</hi> Covenant of Peace <hi>drawn up, ſubſcri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bed, nay ſealed,</hi> and King and Parliament might Victoriouſly <hi>joyn in an happy</hi> Union <hi>againſt the Antichriſtian Faction,</hi> this in England, <hi>which is</hi> intimately Confederate with that in Ire<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land, <hi>and equally Rebellious againſt the</hi> Kings <hi>Authority in His higheſt Court of Juſtice.

by a thorow Reformation: <hi>The Authour of that Book did not ſet himſelf to dispute with Turks, or Jews, or groſſe Papiſts, but with ſome treacherous Reconcilers, who under</hi> colour of Pacification, <hi>and ſome pretence of a</hi> moderate Reformation, <hi>would take away</hi> half Chriſt <hi>at leaſt, and</hi> three quarters of our old Creed, <hi>as if they could make us amends, by giving us</hi> a New one, <hi>and we might</hi> Covenant to tear Chriſt and his Goſpel to pieces for Peace ſake. <hi>The Proteſtants talked much of the Cauſe of Chriſt (ſaith the ſame Authour) as long as they had</hi>

His ſecond Chapter concerns</hi> Juſtification, <hi>and he would have us conſider, that it is not enough to ſay,</hi> we are juſtified by Faith, <hi>but we muſt ſay,</hi> we are juſtified by Faith, becauſe Chriſts righteouſneſſe is imputed, and our ſins are not im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>puted to us that beleeve. <hi>We muſt not deny our Regeneration, and yet we muſt not confound it with our juſtification. We muſt obey God with all our heart, and all our ſtrength, and yet we muſt not plead any other obedience</hi> for our Juſtification <hi>at the Tribu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nall of God, ſave the obedience of Ieſus Chriſt. Our good works ſhall be rewarded, that's encouragement enough; but the reward is grounded upon a free Pardon, and a gracious acceptation: if we were not firſt juſtified, our works would not be accepted, nor re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>warded; Becauſe our perſons are accepted in Chriſt, therefore our works are rewarded for Chriſt; that imperfect righteouſneſſe of works which we have, doth wholly depend upon the righteouſneſſe
<pb facs="tcp:112095:5"/>
of faith; now the imperfection of our righteouſneſſe is pardoned, the ſincerity of our obedience is accepted, and yet we are not juſtified by our own ſincere obedience, no not in part, but are onely (and whol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, becauſe perfectly) juſtified by the compleat and perfect obedience of Ieſus Chriſt. We muſt then truſt with our whole ſoul to the obedience of Ieſus Chriſt, and not truſt at all to any good quality infuſed into us, or good works wrought by us, for our Iuſtification: This is the pure Proteſtant Religion, commended to us in the ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cond Chapter. In his third Chapter, he doth largely explain the of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fice, and uſe of Faith, becauſe Faith is the inſtrument of our ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtification, and we can never keep the unity of Faith in the bond of Peace, if we do not agree about the Nature, or the Offices, and uſe of Faith.

Let the fear of God preſerve thee from all falſe fears. <hi>Timor Dei efficit ut caetera non timeantur.</hi> Fear not them that kill the body, but fear him who can caſt thy ſoule and body into Hell, yea feare him. Doſt thou not be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leeve a Reſurrection? why then doſt thou fear them that kill the body? ſhew me an army that can keep my body from riſing, or my ſoul from aſcending, &amp; I will be afraid of them.</p>
            <p>My ſecond Encouragement is taken from Gods dealing with <hi>Babylon</hi> of old. I ſhall not tell you any long ſtories out <note place="margin">2.

            <p n="1">1. God did dry up <hi>Euphrates,</hi> a river ſo deep and ſwift, that the <hi>Babylonians</hi> laughed at all the attempts of any ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>my that ſhould go about to take their City, and yet <hi>Babylon</hi> was ſoon taken, when God did but ſay to the deep, <hi>Be dry, Iſai.</hi> 44. 27.

And will not God plead the cauſe of his Evangelicall <hi>Sion?</hi> will he not dry up the <hi>Euphrates,</hi> the Sea of <hi>Rome,</hi> and all her ſprings? Yes ſurely, God doth intend to dry up the <hi>Romiſh Euphrates, Revel.</hi> 16. 12. The River is not now ſo deep, it doth not overflow the banks ſo far as it hath done of late dayes; we have gained much ground from the <hi>Romiſh-ſea.</hi> Let us look to our <hi>Banks,</hi> and keep what we have gained.</p>

            <p n="4">4. God did diſcover all the hid treaſure, and ſecret wealth of <hi>Babylon,</hi> Iſai. 45. 3.</p>

            <p>It is certain, that God loves his <hi>Evangelicall Sion</hi> as well as he loved the <hi>Iewiſh Sion,</hi> and he hates the <hi>Romiſh Babylon</hi> more then ever he hated the <hi>Aſſyrian Babylon:</hi> let us then depend upon the love and power of God, the promiſes of the Goſpel, the wiſdom and fidelity of Chriſt, for the de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtruction of <hi>Romiſh Babylon.</hi> The time will not permit me to ſpeak diſtinctly of thoſe ſeverall Heads: Yet take a third Encouragement.</p>

God will in due time make his enemies know that his Church hath an husband which will maintain her cauſe, &amp; avenge her quarrell. The effectuall power, and watchfull providence of Ieſus Chriſt, is conſtantly imployed for his Churches good; the ſeven Hornes of the Lamb are ſtronger then the ten hornes of the Beaſt. S. <hi>Iohn</hi> doth deſcribe Chriſt by the Similitude of a Lambe with ſeven hornes and ſeven eyes, to note his power, and providence, Rev,. 5. 6.

I muſt beg time to prove what I ſay, it is a weighty truth, and we know not how ſoon we may be called to ſeal this truth with our deareſt blood. The Apoſtle proves it un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deniably, by ſundry arguments, in the Epiſtle to the <hi>Hebrews,</hi> in the 7. 8. 9. and 10<hi rend="sup">th.</hi> Chapters. I will pitch upon the tenth, becauſe there you have the ſumme of all. There is no other Sacrifice which can take away ſin, but the Sacrifice which Jeſus Chriſt himſelf offered upon the Croſſe; read the tenth verſe. <hi>By the which will we are ſanctified through the offering:</hi> of what? of a wafer-cake? no, <hi>of the body of Ieſus Chriſt:</hi> But how often muſt his body be offered? <hi>once for all,</hi> not as often as there is a Maſſe, but <hi>once for all.</hi> But who muſt offer the body of Chriſt? why, Chriſt himſelf, <hi>this Man,</hi> verſe the 12<hi rend="sup">th.</hi> a Maſſe-Prieſt cannot offer up the body of Chriſt, for Chriſt is both Prieſt, and Sacrifice. But may not a Maſſe-Prieſt offer ſome other ſacrifice for ſinnes? No, there is but <hi>one ſacrifice for ſinne,</hi> ver. 12. <hi>But this man after he had offer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed one ſacrifice for ſinnes,</hi> and that <hi>one ſacrifice</hi> is to be but <hi>once offered;</hi> the Apoſtle repeats this, that we might not for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>get it, this ſacrifice was offered <hi>once for all,</hi> verſe 10. <hi>once for ever,</hi> verſe 12. <hi>once for all ſinnes, once for all times,</hi> it is of perpetuall vertue and merit, once for ever: Is not that plain and full? Oh but Chriſt is gone to heaven, and we are not yet perfected. Why vain man, Chriſt hath finiſhed his work, and therefore is gone to heaven, he is <hi>ſate down,</hi> ver. 12. and he hath done his work, or elſe he would not ſit down, he hath not left any part of the Service to be perfe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cted by a Maſſe-prieſt, and therefore do not expect to be perfected by any other offering in the Maſſe, or out of the Maſſe: read the 14. verſe, <hi>For by one offering he hath perfected
<pb n="34" facs="tcp:112095:23"/>
for ever them that are ſanctified: Ye are ſanctified by that one offering,</hi> verſe 10. and <hi>perfected</hi> by it, verſe 14. But who is the witneſſe of this truth? why, the <hi>Holy Ghoſt,</hi> in the very next verſe, the 15<hi rend="sup">th.</hi> verſe; <hi>Whereof the Holy Ghoſt alſo is a witneſſe to us.</hi> Judge now, whether they that did bear wit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe to this truth, be not Co-martyrs with the Holy Ghoſt, and therefore Co-heirs with Jeſus Chriſt. You ſee what reaſon we have to Proteſt againſt that <hi>Babylonian</hi> ſacrifice in the Maſſe. You have now received the knowledge of this truth, and if you <hi>ſinne wilfully after you have received the knowledge of the truth,</hi> it is principally meant of this truth, <hi>there remains no more ſacrifice for ſinne,</hi> becauſe ye have wil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fully and maliciouſly rejected the <hi>Onely All-ſufficient</hi> Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crifice of Jeſus Chriſt, truſting upon ſome other Sacrifice, that of the Maſſe, or the like, and done deſpite to the Spirit, by a moſt malignant contempt of the witneſſe of the Spirit. What argument can be more prevailing, to perſwade us to hold faſt the Profeſſion of our Faith, <hi>the Proteſtant Faith,</hi> leſt we fall from a coldneſſe and neutrality in Religion, into a deſperate malignity, and unpardonable Apoſtaſie.

For when men doe wilfully let fall any truth, God doth uſually give them up to beleeve lyes. Thinke ſadly of this buſineſſe; beleeve it, no buſineſſe is of higher concernment, you had need have a Choice Committee of both Houſes, and an Aſſembly of learned, pious, and experienced Divines, to conſult about it; till Articles of agree<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment are drawne up, it is impoſſible we ſhould ever agree, and therefore there is no way like this to ſettle truth and peace at once, and make them greet and kiſſe each other.
